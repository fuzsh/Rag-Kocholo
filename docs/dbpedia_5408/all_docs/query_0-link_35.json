No funding was received for this update.\n\nNo commercial sponsor had any involvement in the design and conduct of this review, namely collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, decision to submit, review, or approval of the manuscript.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank all participating patients and staff of the clinics of emergency medicine, internal medicine, and departments of clinical chemistry from all participating hospitals for their most helpful support during the individual studies. We also wish to thank the following people for commenting on the draft protocol: Hayley Edmonds, Anette Holm, Renato Seligman, Richard Shoemaker, and Roger Damoiseaux; and for reviewing the draft review we wish to thank Anne Lyddiatt, Noorin Bhimani, Anette Holm, Renato Seligman, Mark Jones, and Roger Damoiseaux. We also thank Qing Wang (for translating Chinese articles) and Benjamin Kasenda (for helping with quality assessment of trials in which the primary investigators were involved).\n\nVersion history\n\nPublished\n\nTitle\n\nStage\n\nAuthors\n\nVersion\n\nDifferences between protocol and review\n\nWe changed the co‐primary endpoint of combined disease‐specific failure at 30 days (mentioned in the protocol) to setting‐specific treatment failure at 30 days as defined above for reasons of standardisation across trials. We limited the analysis of the secondary outcome number of 'sick days' (days with restricted activities from the ARI within 14 days following randomisation) to the primary care trials because other trials did not assess this outcome.\n\nIn addition, based on referee comments during the initial editorial process of the initial review (Schuetz 2012), we added further sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our results. Specifically, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials with low adherence to PCT algorithms (< 70%) or not reporting adherence. We also performed sensitivity analyses with respect to methodological quality criteria (allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment). We further performed a sensitivity analysis excluding trials with a follow‐up time for mortality different than one month. We conducted meta‐analyses with aggregated data of included trials to further investigate heterogeneity (inconsistency measure I2 statistic and Cochran Q test) of intervention effects and trial subgroups based on adherence to PCT algorithms.\n\nKeywords\n\nMeSH\n\nMedical Subject Headings Check Words\n\nHumans;\n\nPICOs\n\nPICOs\n\nPopulation\n\nIntervention\n\nComparison\n\nOutcome\n\nThe PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\nSee more on using PICO in the Cochrane Handbook.\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nSummary of findings for the main comparison.
