        "text": "From the Earth to the Moon\n\nâTo Shiver the Skyâ is an oratorio about the history of flight, and mankind's quest to conquer the heavens. Told through the words of 11 of our greatest astronomers, inventors, visionaries and pilots, it charts our relentless need to explore the universe, defy our earthly bonds, reach for the face of God, and ultimately claim our place among the stars. It's sung in a panoply of languages: English, Latin, Italian, German, French, Polish, Russian, and Sanskrit.\n\nA Brief History of Classical Music\n\nOne of the more unique features of 'To Shiver the Sky' lies in its orchestration; to parallel the march of aviation progress across the centuries, the musical language similarly evolves through the many eras of classical music: ranging from medieval to classical, impressionism to romantic, modern to post-classical.\n\nThe Biggest Voices in the World\n\nRecorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, Christopher's new album features a star-studded cast of guest artists, including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by Christopher Tin), Royal Opera Chorus, Danielle de Niese, Pene Pati, ModernMedieval, Pembroke College Girl's Choir, and Anna Lapwood. It's Christopher's major label debut, after signing to Universal's Decca Gold label.\n\nBreaking Records\n\nFor the first time ever, he funded the album with a Kickstarter campaign designed to bring his fans closer to the creative process. Featuring rewards like backstage passes to his conducting debut at Carnegie Hall, and attending the recording sessions at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, the original fundraising goal of $50,000 was reached within the first 36 hours. By the time the campaign ended, $221,415 was raised, shattering the all-time record as the highest-funded classical music Kickstarter campaign ever."
