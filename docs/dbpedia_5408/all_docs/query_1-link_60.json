A burgeoning and undeveloped scene, the 300+ logos are often naive and amateurish in quality and look and provide the perfect follow up to the similar logos in the previous zine. Be sure to back-up that brain as halfway through the zine gets ‘hacked’ and overtaken by logos and graphics from the underground hacker and warez scene!!\nMeasuring at 10x14cm and printed on 70 g/m² EOS bible print paper and with red glue binding.\nShipping Info / All products on Klasse Wrecks Bandcamp page sent by unregistered air mail from United Kingdom. Klasse Wrecks is not responsible for lost or damaged goods. Registered post with tracking number available via klassewrecks.com and will result in higher postage costs. Due to unreliable locals postal systems, Klasse Wrecks takes no responsibility for items sent to Russia and Brazil. \nReturn Policy / Klasse Wrecks is not responsible for items damaged in transit.
