        "text": "GHRS Spectra of the Very Low Mass Star VB 10 (M8 Ve)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLinsky, J. L.; Wood, B.; Brown, A.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nWe report on ultraviolet spectra of the M8 Ve star VB10 = Gl 752B, probably the coolest and lowest mass star observed so far in the ultraviolet. This star is of great interest because it lies almost at the end of the main sequence where stars are thought to be fully convective and solar-type dynamo processes should not be present. On 1994 October 12 we observed the brighter companion Gl 752A (M3 Ve) and then offset to VB10. Both stars were observed with the G140L grating on the HST Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph. The spectrum of Gl 752A shows the expected transition region lines of solar-type stars consisting of C III 1175 Angstroms, H I Lyman-alpha , N V 1240 Angstroms, O I 1304 Angstroms, C II 1335 Angstroms, Si IV 1400 Angstroms, C IV 1550 Angstroms, He II 1640 Angstroms, and others. The spectrum of VB10, on the other hand, provided a surprise. Our spectra of this star consists of 11 integrations, each of about 5 minutes duration. The first 10 integrations show no emission features with very small upper limits to the surface fluxes in the transition region lines. The last integration, however, shows strong emission in the C II, Si IV, and C IV lines, which we interpret as a flare. The VB10 spectra imply that there is little if any continuous heating of the transition regions of the very coolest M dwarf stars. Instead, there is only transient emission during major realignments of the magnetic field. By contrast, hotter stars show continuous emission in the transition region lines, indicating a continuous heating process or a large number of small flares (microflaring). This change in behavior may be due to the absence of radiative cores in the coolest M dwarfs and the inability of the solar-type alpha -omega dynamo to operate in stars without an interface between a radiative core and a convective envelope. Our data indicate that the coolest M dwarfs nevertheless do have magnetic fields. This work is supported by NASA Interagency Transfer S-56460-D to the\n\nStellar Activity at the End of the Main Sequence: GHRS Observations of the M8 Ve Star VB 10\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLinsky, Jeffrey L.; Wood, Brian E.; Brown, Alexander; Giampapa, Mark S.; Ambruster, Carol\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe present Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph observations of the M8 Ve star VB 10 (equal to G1 752B), located very near the end of the stellar main sequence, and its dM3.5 binary companion G1 752A. These coeval stars provide a test bed for studying whether the outer atmospheres of stars respond to changes in internal structure as stars become fully convective near mass 0.3 solar mass (about spectral type M5), where the nature of the stellar magnetic dynamo presumably changes, and near the transition from red to brown dwarfs near mass 0.08 solar mass (about spectral type M9), when hydrogen burning ceases at the end of the main sequence. We obtain upper limits for the quiescent emission of VB 10 but observe a transition region spectrum during a large flare, which indicates that some type of magnetic dynamo must be present. Two indirect lines of evidence-scaling from the observed X-ray emission and scaling from a time-resolved flare on AD Leo suggest that the fraction of the stellar bolometric luminosity that heats the transition region of VB 10 outside of obvious flares is comparable to, or larger than, that for G1 752A. This suggests an increase in the magnetic heating rates, as measured by L(sub line)/L(sub bol) ratios, across the radiative/convective core boundary and as stars approach the red/brown dwarf boundary. These results provide new constraints for dynamo models and models of coronal and transition-region heating in late-type stars.\n\nWhite Dwarfs in Star Clusters: The Initial-Final Mass Relation for Stars from 0.85 to 8 M$_\\\\odot$\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCummings, Jeffrey; Kalirai, Jason; Tremblay, P.-E.; RamÃ­rez-Ruiz, Enrico\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe spectroscopic study of white dwarfs provides both their mass, cooling age, and intrinsic photometric properties. For white dwarfs in the field of well-studied star clusters, this intrinsic photometry can be used to determine if they are members of that star cluster. Comparison of a member white dwarf's cooling age to its total cluster's age provides the evolutionary timescale of its progenitor star, and hence the mass. This is the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) for stars, which gives critical information on how a progenitor star evolves and loses mass throughout its lifetime, and how this changes with progenitor mass. Our work, for the first time, presents a uniform analysis of 85 white dwarf cluster members spanning from progenitor masses of 0.85 to 8 M$_\\\\odot$. Comparison of our work to theoretical IFMRs shows remarkable consistency in their shape but differences remain. We will discuss possible explanations for these differences, including the effects of stellar rotation.\n\nThe Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA). Finding transiting exoplanets around bright (mV < 8) stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTalens, G. J. J.; Spronck, J. F. P.; Lesage, A.-L.; Otten, G. P. P. L.; Stuik, R.; Pollacco, D.; Snellen, I. A. G.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis paper describes the design, operations, and performance of the Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA). Its primary goal is to find new exoplanets transiting bright stars, 4 < mV < 8, by monitoring the full sky. MASCARA consists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational since February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile (operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. Both MASCARA stations are equipped with five interline CCD cameras using wide field lenses (24 mm focal length) with fixed pointings, which together provide coverage down to airmass 3 of the local sky. The interline CCD cameras allow for back-to-back exposures, taken at fixed sidereal times with exposure times of 6.4 sidereal seconds. The exposures are short enough that the motion of stars across the CCD does not exceed one pixel during an integration. Astrometry and photometry are performed on-site, after which the resulting light curves are transferred to Leiden for further analysis. The final MASCARA archive will contain light curves for 70 000 stars down to mV = 8.4, with a precision of 1.5% per 5 minutes at mV = 8.\n\nThe M-type stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Hollis Ralph; Querci, Francois R.; Jordan, Stuart (Editor); Thomas, Richard (Editor); Goldberg, Leo; Pecker, Jean-Claude\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe papers in this volume cover the following topics: (1) basic properties and photometric variability of M and related stars; (2) spectroscopy and nonthermal processes; (3) circumstellar radio molecular lines; (4) circumstellar shells, the formation of grains, and radiation transfer; (5) mass loss; (6) circumstellar chemistry; (7) thermal atmospheric models; (8) quasi-thermal models; (9) observations on the atmospheres of M dwarfs; and (1) theoretical work on M dwarfs.\n\nThe origin of the Crab Nebula and the electron capture supernova in 8-10 M solar mass stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNomoto, K.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe chemical composition of the Crab Nebula is compared with several presupernova models. The small carbon and oxygen abundances in the helium-rich nebula are consistent with only the presupernova model of the star whose main sequence mass was MMS approximately 8-9.5 M. More massive stars contain too much carbon in the helium layer and smaller mass stars do not leave neutron stars. The progenitor star of the Crab Nebula lost appreciable part of the hydrogen-rich envelope before the hydrogen-rich and helium layers were mixed by convection. Finally it exploded as the electron capture supernova; the O+Ne+Mg core collapsed to form a neutron star and only the extended helium-rich envelope was ejected by the weak shock wave.\n\nTHE SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD. XXVI. AP Col: THE CLOSEST (8.4 pc) PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE STAR\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRiedel, Adric R.; Henry, Todd J.; Jao, Wei-Chun\n\n2011-10-15\n\nWe present the results of a multi-technique investigation of the M4.5Ve flare star AP Col, which we discover to be the nearest pre-main-sequence star. These include astrometric data from the CTIO 0.9 m, from which we derive a proper motion of 342.0 {+-} 0.5 mas yr{sup -1}, a trigonometric parallax of 119.21 {+-} 0.98 mas (8.39 {+-} 0.07 pc), and photometry and photometric variability at optical wavelengths. We also provide spectroscopic data, including radial velocity (22.4 {+-} 0.3 km s{sup -1}), lithium equivalent width (EW) (0.28 {+-} 0.02 A), H{alpha} EW (-6.0 to -35 A), vsin i (11 {+-} 1moreÂ Â» km s{sup -1}), and gravity indicators from the Siding Spring 2.3 m WiFeS, Lick 3 m Hamilton echelle, and Keck-I HIRES echelle spectrographs. The combined observations demonstrate that AP Col is the closer of only two known systems within 10 pc of the Sun younger than 100 Myr. Given its space motion and apparent age of 12-50 Myr, AP Col is likely a member of the recently proposed {approx}40 Myr old Argus/IC 2391 Association.Â«Â less\n\nThe stellar wind of an O8.5 I(f) star in M 31\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHaser, S. M.; Lennon, D. J.; Kudritzki, R.-P.; Puls, J.; Pauldrach, A. W. A.; Bianchi, L.; Hutchings, J. B.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe rediscuss the UV spectrum of OB 78#231, an O8.5 I(f) star in the Andromeda galaxy M 31, which has been obtained with the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope by Hutchings et al. (1992). The spectrum has been re-extracted with better knowledge of background, calibration, and scattered light. The empirical analysis of the stellar wind lines results in a terminal velocity and mass loss rate similar to those typically found in comparable galactic objects. Furthermore, a comparison with an FOS spectrum of an O7 supergiant in the Small Magellanic Cloud and IUE spectra of galactic objects implies a metallicity close to galactic counterparts. These results are confirmed quantitatively by spectrum synthesis calculations using a theoretical description of O-star winds.\n\nMonitoring pulsating giant stars in M33: star formation history and chemical enrichment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJavadi, A.; van Loon, J. Th\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 (Triangulum). A new method has been developed by us to use pulsating giant stars to reconstruct the star formation history of galaxies over cosmological time as well as using them to map the dust production across their host galaxies. In first Instance the central square kiloparsec of M33 was monitored and long period variable stars (LPVs) were identified. We give evidence of two epochs of a star formation rate enhanced by a factor of a few. These stars are also important dust factories, we measure their dust production rates from a combination of our data with Spitzer Space Telescope mid-IR photometry. Then the monitoring survey was expanded to cover a much larger part of M33 including spiral arms. Here we present our methodology and describe results for the central square kiloparsec of M33 [1-4] and disc of M33 [5-8].\n\nStem cells. m6A mRNA methylation facilitates resolution of naÃ¯ve pluripotency toward differentiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeula, Shay; Moshitch-Moshkovitz, Sharon; Dominissini, Dan; Mansour, Abed AlFatah; Kol, Nitzan; Salmon-Divon, Mali; Hershkovitz, Vera; Peer, Eyal; Mor, Nofar; Manor, Yair S; Ben-Haim, Moshe Shay; Eyal, Eran; Yunger, Sharon; Pinto, Yishay; Jaitin, Diego Adhemar; Viukov, Sergey; Rais, Yoach; Krupalnik, Vladislav; Chomsky, Elad; Zerbib, Mirie; Maza, Itay; Rechavi, Yoav; Massarwa, Rada; Hanna, Suhair; Amit, Ido; Levanon, Erez Y; Amariglio, Ninette; Stern-Ginossar, Noam; Novershtern, Noa; Rechavi, Gideon; Hanna, Jacob H\n\n2015-02-27\n\nNaÃ¯ve and primed pluripotent states retain distinct molecular properties, yet limited knowledge exists on how their state transitions are regulated. Here, we identify Mettl3, an N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine naÃ¯ve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts and naÃ¯ve embryonic stem cells are depleted for m(6)A in mRNAs, yet are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their naÃ¯ve state and, subsequently, undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the postimplantation stage, which leads to early embryonic lethality. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naÃ¯ve pluripotency-promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence naÃ¯ve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.

Edward\n\n1995-01-01\n\nObservations of the resolved stars in dwarf galaxy GR 8, obtained over the period 1980 February to 1994 March, are presented. Thirty-four separate epochs were searched for variable stars, and a total of six were found, of which one has Cepheid characteristics. After correction for Galactic extinction this single Cepheid yields a distance modulus of m - M = 26.75 +/- 0.35. This corresponds to a distance of 2.24 Mpc, placing GR 8 near the Local Group (LG) zero-velocity surface. The other five variable stars are very red, and possibly have long periods of order 100 days or more.\n\nFar-infrared properties of flare stars and dM stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMullan, D. J.; Stencel, R. E.; Backman, D. E.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nResults are reported from a search of the IRAS data base for flare stars and for a control sample of dM stars. At 12 microns, 70-80 percent of both samples have been detected. The K-12 colors of flare stars are significantly different from those of dM stars: for a given K magnitude, a flare star is about 70 percent brighter at 12 microns than a dM star. At 100 microns, 27 percent of the flare stars which are sources at 12 microns have been detected, while none of the comparable dM stars has been detected. Implications for microflaring are discussed.\n\nCENSUS OF BLUE STARS IN SDSS DR8\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nScibelli, Samantha; Newberg, Heidi Jo; Carlin, Jeffrey L.; ...\n\n2014-12-02\n\nIn this work, we present a census of the 12,060 spectra of blue objects (moreÂ Â» $$(g-r)_0<-0.25$$) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8). As part of the data release, all of the spectra were cross-correlated with 48 template spectra of stars, galaxies and QSOs to determine the best match. We compared the blue spectra by eye to the templates assigned in SDSS DR8. 10,856 of the objects matched their assigned template, 170 could not be classified due to low signal-to-noise (S/N), and 1034 were given new classifications. We identify 7458 DA white dwarfs, 1145 DB white dwarfs, 273 rarer white dwarfs (including carbon, DZ, DQ, and magnetic), 294 subdwarf O stars, 648 subdwarf B stars, 679 blue horizontal branch stars, 1026 blue stragglers, 13 cataclysmic variables, 129 white dwarf - M dwarf binaries, 36 objects with spectra similar to DO white dwarfs, 179 QSOs, and 10 galaxies. We provide two tables of these objects, sample spectra that match the templates, figures showing all of the spectra that were grouped by eye, and diagnostic plots that show the positions, colors, apparent magnitudes, proper motions, etc. for each classification. In conclusion, future surveys will be able to use templates similar to stars in each of the classes we identify to classify blue stars, including rare types, automatically.Â«Â less\n\nThe first transition Wolf-Rayet WN/C star in M31\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShara, Michael M.; MikoÅajewska, Joanna; Caldwell, Nelson; IÅkiewicz, Krystian; Drozd, Katarzyna; Zurek, David\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThree decades of searches have revealed 154 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M31, with 62 of WC type, 92 of WN type and zero of transition-type WN/C or WC/N. In apparent contrast, about two per cent of the WR stars in the Galaxy, the LMC and M33 simultaneously display strong lines of carbon and nitrogen, I.e. they are transition-type WN/C or WC/N stars. We report here the serendipitous discovery of M31 WR 84-1, the first transition star in M31, located at RA = 00h43m43{^s.}61 Dec. = +41Â°45'27{^''.}95 (J2000). We present its spectrum, classify it as WN5/WC6, and compare it with other known transition stars. The star is unresolved in Hubble Space Telescope narrow-band and broad-band images, while its spectrum displays strong, narrow emission lines of hydrogen, [N II], [S II] and [O III]; this indicates a nebula surrounding the star. The radial velocity of the nebular lines is consistent with that of gas at the same position in the disc of M31. The metallicity at the 11.8 kpc galactocentric distance of M31 WR 84-1 is approximately solar, consistent with other known transition stars. We suggest that modest numbers of reddened WR stars remain to be found in M31.\n\nBe Stars in M31\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeters, Matthew L.; Wisniewski, John; Choi, Yumi; Williams, Ben; Lomax, Jamie; Bjorkman, Karen; Durbin, Meredith; Johnson, Lent Cliff; Lewis, Alexia; Lutz, Julie; Sigut, Aaron; Wallach, Aislynn; Dalcanton, Julianne\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe identify Be candidate stars in M31 using two-epoch F625W + F658N photometry from HST/ACS+WFC3 combined with the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) Catalog. Using the PHAT catalog allows us to extract stellar parameters such as surface temperature and gravity, thereby allowing us to identify the main sequence B type stars in the field of view. Be candidate stars are identified by comparing their HST narrow-band HÎ± excess magnitudes with that predicted by Kurucz spectra. We find 314 Be candidate stars out of 5699 B + Be candidate stars (5.51%) in our first epoch and 301 Be candidate stars out of 5769 B + Be candidate stars (5.22%) in our second epoch. Our Be fraction, while lower than that of the SMC, LMC, and MW, is possibly consistent with the fact the M31 has a higher metallicity than the other galaxies because Be fraction varies inversely with metallicity. We note that earlier spectral types have the largest Be fraction, and that the Be fraction strictly declines as the spectral type increases to later types. We then match our Be candidate stars with clusters, establishing that 39 of 314 are cluster stars in epoch one and 36 of 301 stars are cluster stars in epoch two. We assign ages, using the cluster age to characterize cluster Be candidate stars and star formation histories to characterize field Be candidate stars. Finally, we determine which Be candidate stars exhibited disk loss or disk growth between epochs, finding that, of the Be stars that did not show source confusion or low SNR in one of the epochs, 65 / 265 (24.5%) showed disk loss or renewal, while 200 / 265 (75.5%) showed only small changes in HÎ± excess. Our research provides context for the parameters of candidate Be stars in M31, which will be useful in further determining the nature of Be stars. This paper was supported by a grant from STScI via GO-13857.\n\nMassive Stars in M31\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLomax, Jamie R.; Peters, Matthew; Wisniewski, John; Dalcanton, Julianne; Williams, Benjamin; Lutz, Julie; Choi, Yumi; Sigut, Aaron\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMassive stars are intrinsically rare and therefore present a challenge to understand from a statistical perspective, especially within the Milky Way. We recently conducted follow-up observations to the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey that were designed to detect more than 10,000 emission line stars, including WRs, by targeting regions in M31 previously known to host large numbers of young, massive clusters and very young stellar populations. Because of the existing PHAT data, we are able to derive an effective temperature, bolarimetric luminosity, and extinction for each of our detected stars. We report on preliminary results of the massive star population of our dataset and discuss how our results compare to previous studies of massive stars in M31.\n\nCARBON-TO-OXYGEN RATIOS IN M DWARFS AND SOLAR-TYPE STARS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNakajima, Tadashi; Sorahana, Satoko, E-mail: tadashi.nakajima@nao.ac.jp, E-mail: sorahana@astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\nIt has been suggested that high C/O ratios (>0.8) in circumstellar disks lead to the formation of carbon-dominated planets. Based on the expectation that elemental abundances in the stellar photospheres give the initial abundances in the circumstellar disks, the frequency distributions of C/O ratios of solar-type stars have been obtained by several groups. The results of these investigations are mixed. Some find C/O > 0.8 in more than 20% of stars, and C/O > 1.0 in more than 6%. Others find C/O > 0.8 in none of the sample stars. These works on solar-type stars are all differential abundance analysesmoreÂ Â» with respect to the Sun and depend on the adopted C/O ratio in the Sun. Recently, a method of molecular line spectroscopy of M dwarfs, in which carbon and oxygen abundances are derived respectively from CO and H{sub 2}O lines in the K band, has been developed. The resolution of the K- band spectrum is 20,000. Carbon and oxygen abundances of 46 M dwarfs have been obtained by this nondifferential abundance analysis. Carbon-to-oxygen ratios in M dwarfs derived by this method are more robust than those in solar-type stars derived from neutral carbon and oxygen lines in the visible spectra because of the difficulty in the treatment of oxygen lines. We have compared the frequency distribution of C/O distributions in M dwarfs with those of solar-type stars and have found that the low frequency of high-C/O ratios is preferred.Â«Â less\n\nMASCARA-1 b. A hot Jupiter transiting a bright mV = 8.3 A-star in a misaligned orbit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTalens, G. J. J.; Albrecht, S.; Spronck, J. F. P.; Lesage, A.-L.; Otten, G. P. P. L.; Stuik, R.; Van Eylen, V.; Van Winckel, H.; Pollacco, D.; McCormac, J.; Grundahl, F.; Fredslund Andersen, M.; Antoci, V.; Snellen, I. A. G.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe report the discovery of MASCARA-1 b, which is the first exoplanet discovered with the Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA). This exoplanet is a hot Jupiter orbiting a bright mV = 8.3, rapidly rotating (vsiniâ > 100 km s-1) A8 star with a period of 2.148780 Â± 8 Ã 10-6 days. The planet has a mass and radius of 3.7 Â± 0.9 MJup and 1.5 Â± 0.3 RJup, respectively. As with most hot Jupiters transiting early-type stars, we find a misalignment between the planet orbital axis and the stellar spin axis, which may be a signature of the formation and migration histories of this family of planets. MASCARA-1 b has a mean density of 1.5 Â± 0.9 g cm-3 and an equilibrium temperature of 2570+50-30K, that is one of the highest temperatures known for a hot Jupiter to date. The system is reminiscent of WASP-33, but the host star lacks apparent delta-scuti variations, making the planet an ideal target for atmospheric characterization. We expect this to be the first of a series of hot Jupiters transiting bright early-type stars that will be discovered by MASCARA.

We present the results of a search for members and extratidal cluster halo stars within and outside of the tidal radius of these clusters in the LAMOST Data Release 1. We find seven candidate cluster members (inside the tidal radius) of both M3 and M13, respectively. In M3 we also identify eight candidate extratidal cluster halo stars at distances up to Ë9.8 times the tidal radius, and in M13 we identify 12 candidate extratidal cluster halo stars at distances up to Ë13.8 times the tidal radius. These results support previous indications that both M3 and M13 are surrounded by extended stellar halos, and we find that the GC destruction rates corresponding to the observed mass loss are generally significantly higher than theoretical studies predict.\n\nStar Formation in M 33 (HerM33es)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKramer, C.; Boquien, M.; Braine, J.; Buchbender, C.; Calzetti, D.; Gratier, P.; Mookerjea, B.; RelaÃ±o, M.; Verley, S.\n\n2011-11-01\n\nWithin the key project \"Herschel M 33 extended survey\" (HerM33es), we are studying the physical and chemical processes driving star formation and galactic evolution in the nearby galaxy M 33, combining the study of local conditions affecting individual star formation with properties only becoming apparent on global scales. Here, we present recent results obtained by the HerM33es team. Combining Spitzer and Herschel data ranging from 3.6 Î¼m to 500Î¼m, along with H i, HÎ±, and GALEX UV data, we have studied the dust at high spatial resolutions of 150 pc, providing estimators of the total infrared (TIR) brightness and of the star formation rate. While the temperature of the warm dust at high brightness is driven by young massive stars, evolved stellar populations appear to drive the temperature of the cold dust. Plane-parallel models of photon dominated regions (PDRs) fail to reproduce fully the [C ii], [O i], and CO maps obtained in a first spectroscopic study of one 2' Ã 2' subregion of M 33, located on the inner, northern spiral arm and encompassing the H ii region BCLMP 302.\n\nMechanism of mRNA-STAR domain interaction: Molecular dynamics simulations of Mammalian Quaking STAR protein.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Monika; Anirudh, C R\n\n2017-10-03\n\nSTAR proteins are evolutionary conserved mRNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression at all stages of RNA metabolism. These proteins possess conserved STAR domain that recognizes identical RNA regulatory elements as YUAAY. Recently reported crystal structures show that STAR domain is composed of N-terminal QUA1, K-homology domain (KH) and C-terminal QUA2, and mRNA binding is mediated by KH-QUA2 domain. Here, we present simulation studies done to investigate binding of mRNA to STAR protein, mammalian Quaking protein (QKI). We carried out conventional MD simulations of STAR domain in presence and absence of mRNA, and studied the impact of mRNA on the stability, dynamics and underlying allosteric mechanism of STAR domain. Our unbiased simulations results show that presence of mRNA stabilizes the overall STAR domain by reducing the structural deviations, correlating the 'within-domain' motions, and maintaining the native contacts information. Absence of mRNA not only influenced the essential modes of motion of STAR domain, but also affected the connectivity of networks within STAR domain. We further explored the dissociation of mRNA from STAR domain using umbrella sampling simulations, and the results suggest that mRNA binding to STAR domain occurs in multi-step: first conformational selection of mRNA backbone conformations, followed by induced fit mechanism as nucleobases interact with STAR domain.\n\nCD8+ memory T-cell inflation renders compromised CD4+ T-cell-dependent CD8+ T-cell immunity via naÃ¯ve T-cell anergy.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Aizhang; Freywald, Andrew; Xie, Yufeng; Li, Zejun; Xiang, Jim\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWhether inflation of CD8 + memory T (mT) cells, which is often derived from repeated prime-boost vaccinations or chronic viral infections in the elderly, would affect late CD8 + T-cell immunity is a long-standing paradox. We have previously established an animal model with mT-cell inflation by transferring ConA-stimulated monoclonal CD8 + T cells derived from Ova-specific T-cell-receptor transgenic OTI mice into irradiation-induced lymphopenic B6 mice. In this study, we also established another two animal models with mT-cell inflation by transferring, 1) ConA-stimulated monoclonal CD8 + T cells derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein-specific T-cell-receptor transgenic P14 mice, and 2) ConA-stimulated polyclonal CD8 + T cells derived from B6.1 mice into B6 mice with irradiation-induced lymphopenia. We vaccinated these mice with recombinant Ova-expressing Listeria monocytogenes and Ova-pulsed dendritic cells, which stimulated CD4 + T cell-independent and CD4 + T-cell-dependent CD8 + T-cell responses, respectively, and assessed Ova-specific CD8 + T-cell responses by flow cytometry. We found that Ova-specific CD8 + T-cell responses derived from the latter but not the former vaccination were significantly reduced in mice with CD8 + mT-cell inflation compared to wild-type B6 mice. We determined that naÃ¯ve CD8 + T cells purified from splenocytes of mice with mT-cell inflation had defects in cell proliferation upon stimulation in vitro and in vivo and upregulated T-cell anergy-associated Itch and GRAIL molecules. Taken together, our data reveal that CD8 + mT-cell inflation renders compromised CD4 + T-cell-dependent CD8 + T-cell immunity via naÃ¯ve T-cell anergy, and thus show promise for the design of efficient vaccines for elderly patients with CD8 + mT-cell inflation.\n\nChemical composition of stars in globular clusters: M5, M13, and M3\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPilachowski, C.A.; Wallerstein, G.; Myckky Leep, E.\n\nThe composition of giant stars in the globular clusters M3, M5, and M13 have been determined by detailed model atmosphere analysis; the average iron deficiencies relative to the Sun are -1.55, -1.33, and -1.42, respectively. Oxygen is overabundant relative to iron in M3 and M5 but not in M13. Differences in the oxygen abundance can account for variation in horizontal-branch morphology; clusters of intermediate metallicity with high oxygen have red horizontal-branch stars, and those with low oxygen have only blue horizontal-branch stars Z/sub cno/ is the second abundance parameter.\n\nMASS OUTFLOW FROM RED GIANT STARS IN M13, M15, AND M92\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMeszaros, Sz.; Avrett, E. H.; Dupree, A. K.\n\nChromospheric model calculations of the H{alpha} line for selected red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the globular clusters M13, M15, and M92 are constructed to derive mass loss rates (MLRs). The model spectra are compared to the observations obtained with the Hectochelle on the MMT telescope. These stars show strong H{alpha} emissions and blueshifted H{alpha} cores signaling that mass outflow is present in all stars. Outflow velocities of 3-19 km s{sup -1}, larger than indicated by H{alpha} profiles, are needed in the upper chromosphere to achieve good agreement between the model spectra and the observations. ThemoreÂ Â» resulting MLRs range from 0.6 x 10{sup -9} to 5 x 10{sup -9} M {sub sun} yr{sup -1}, which are about an order of magnitude lower than predicted from 'Reimers' law' or inferred from the infrared excess of similar stars. The MLR increases slightly with luminosity and with decreasing effective temperature. Stars in the more metal-rich M13 have higher MLRs by a factor of {approx}2 than in the metal-poor clusters M15 and M92. A fit to the MLRs is given by M-dot (M {sub sun} yr{sup -1}) = 0.092 xL {sup 0.16} x T {sup -2.02} {sub eff} x A {sup 0.37}, where A=10{sup [Fe/H]}. Multiple observations of stars revealed one object in M15, K757, in which the mass outflow increased by a factor of 6 between two observations separated by 18 months. Other stars showed changes in MLR by a factor of 1.5 or less.Â«Â less\n\nRR Lyrae Stars in M4\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuehn, Charles A.; Moskalik, Pawel; Drury, Jason A.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nObservations by Kepler/K2 have revolutionized the study of RR Lyrae stars by allowing the detection of new phenomna, such as low amplitude additional modes and period doubling, which had not previously been seen from the ground. During campaign 2, K2 observed the globular cluster M4, providiing the first opportunity to study a sizeable group of RR Lyrae stars that belong to a single population; the other RR Lyrae stars that have been observed from space are field stars in the galactic halo and thus belong to an assortment of populations. In this poster we present the results of our study of the RR Lyrae variables in M4 from K2 photometry. We have identified additional, low amplitude pulsation modes in both observed RRc stars. In 3 RRab stars we have found the Blazhko effect with periods of 16.6d, 22.4d, and 44.5d.\n\nUV habitable zones around M stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuccino, Andrea P.; Lemarchand, Guillermo A.; Mauas, Pablo J. D.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nDuring the last decade there was a change in paradigm, which led to consider that terrestrial-type planets within liquid-water habitable zones (LW-HZ) around M stars can also be suitable places for the emergence and evolution of life. Since many dMe stars emit large amount of UV radiation during flares, in this work we analyze the UV constrains for living systems on Earth-like planets around dM stars. We apply our model of UV habitable zone (UV-HZ; Buccino, A.P., Lemarchand, G.A., Mauas, P.J.D., 2006. Icarus 183, 491-503) to the three planetary systems around dM stars (HIP 74995, HIP 109388 and HIP 113020) observed by IUE and to two M-flare stars (AD Leo and EV Lac). In particular, HIP 74995 hosts a terrestrial planet in the LW-HZ, which is the exoplanet that most resembles our own Earth. We show, in general, that during the quiescent state there would not be enough UV radiation within the LW-HZ to trigger the biogenic processes and that this energy could be provided by flares of moderate intensity, while strong flares do not necessarily rule-out the possibility of life-bearing planets.\n\nLuminosity Classes of M-Stars in the SAO Catalogue\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobertson, T. H.\n\n1986-08-01\n\nA list of potential M dwarf stars was compiled from a magnetic-tape version of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory star catalogue (SAO) (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 1966) using an assumed thickness of 600 pc for the galactic plane as suggested by Nunez and Figueras (1983). Calculations of the number of M stars brighter than various limiting magnitudes based on known luminosity functions of dwarf and giant M stars show that the vast majority of sample stars are probably M giant stars rather than M dwarf stars having low transverse velocities. Analyses of the distribution in galactic longitude and latitude as well as the kinematic properties of this sample and of data from other published sources supporting this conclusion are also presented.\n\nA SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY OF MASSIVE STARS IN M31 AND M33\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMassey, Philip; Neugent, Kathryn F.; Smart, Brianna M., E-mail: phil.massey@lowell.edu, E-mail: kneugent@lowell.edu, E-mail: bsmart@astro.wisc.edu\n\nWe describe our spectroscopic follow-up to the Local Group Galaxy Survey (LGGS) photometry of M31 and M33. We have obtained new spectroscopy of 1895 stars, allowing us to classify 1496 of them for the first time. Our study has identified many foreground stars, and established membership for hundreds of early- and mid-type supergiants. We have also found nine new candidate luminous blue variables and a previously unrecognized WolfâRayet star. We republish the LGGS M31 and M33 catalogs with improved coordinates, and including spectroscopy from the literature and our new results. The spectroscopy in this paper is responsible for the vastmoreÂ Â» majority of the stellar classifications in these two nearby spiral neighbors. The most luminous (and hence massive) of the stars in our sample are early-type B supergiants, as expected; the more massive O stars are more rare and fainter visually, and thus mostly remain unobserved so far. The majority of the unevolved stars in our sample are in the 20â40 M {sub â} range.Â«Â less\n\nChlorine Isotope Ratios in M Giants and S Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaas, Zachary; Pilachowski, C. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nChlorine is an odd-Z, light element that has been poorly studied in stars. Recently, the first stellar abundance measurements of the isotopologue 35Cl were made and the 35Cl/37Cl ratio was derived in RZ Ari (Maas et al. 2016). Additional abundance measurements are necessary to understand the Galactic chemical evolution and complex nucleosynthesis of Cl. The Cl isotope ratio in particular is important in distinguishing contributions from different nucleosynthesis sites to the surface abundances of stars. For example, current nucloesynthesis models predict that both isotopes of Cl are produced primarily during core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with the energy and progenitor mass impacting the isotopic ratio of the ejected material. In addition to CCSNe, 37Cl is formed by the s-process both in massive stars and in AGB stars, and 35Cl may be produced from neutrino spallation. Understanding the formation of the Cl isotopes is also important to studies of the interstellar medium (ISM). A range of Cl isotope ratios mainly between 2 - 3.5 have been measured in star forming regions, in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars, and in proto-stellar cores using Cl bearing molecules. Additional measurements of the Cl isotope ratio in nearby stars will test nucleosynthesis models and allow comparisons with the range of isotope ratios observed in the ISM.We build on the results of Maas et al. (2016) by measuring the Cl isotope ratio in six M giants and four S stars using R~50,000 resolution spectra from Phoenix on Gemini South. We find no significant difference between the average Cl isotope ratios in the M stars and S stars and our measurements are consistent with the range of values seen in the ISM. We also find the average Cl ratio to be larger than the predicted isotope ratio of 1.8 for the solar neighborhood. Finally, two S stars, GG Pup and WY Pyx, show anomalously strong HCl features with equivalent widths ~3-5 times larger than the HCl features of other stars of\n\nThe circumstellar dust envelopes of red giant stars. I - M giant stars with the 10-micron silicate emission band\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHashimoto, O.; Nakada, Y.; Onaka, T.; Kamijo, F.; Tanabe, T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nSpherical dust envelope models of red giant stars are constructed by solving the radiative transfer equations of the generalized two-stream Eddington approximation. The IRAS observations of M giant stars which show the 10-micron silicate emission band in IRAS LRS spectra are explained by the models with the dirty silicate grains with K proportional to lambda exp -1.5 for lambda greather than 28 microns. Under the assumption of steady mass flow in the envelope, this model analysis gives the following conclusions: (1) the strength of the silicate emission peak at 10 microns is a good indicator of the mass loss rate of the star, (2) no stars with the 10-microns silicate emission feature are observed in the range of mass loss rate smaller than 7 x 10 to the -8th solar mass/yr, and (3) the characteristic time of the mass loss process of M stars does not exceed a few 10,000 years.\n\nStellar model chromospheres. XIII - M dwarf stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiampapa, M. S.; Worden, S. P.; Linsky, J. L.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nSingle-component, homogeneous model chromospheres that are consistent with high-resolution profiles of the Ca II K line calibrated in surface flux units for three dMe and 2 dM stars observed at quiescent times are constructed. The models reveal several systematic trends. Large values of the ratio of T(min) to T(eff) are derived, indicating a large amount of nonradiative heating present in the upper photospheres of M dwarf stars. It is also found that the lower chromospheric temperature gradient is similar for all the M dwarf stars. Since for the models here the chromospheric K line emission strength is most sensitive to the total amount of chromospheric material present within the approximate temperature range T(min)-6000 K, increasing the emission strength is not simply due to increasing chromospheric temperature gradients. It is also found that both the electron density and electron temperature at one thermalization length in the K line below the top of the chromospheres are greater in the dMe stars than in the dM stars. The M dwarf models here have microturbulent velocities between 1 and 2 km/sec, which are much smaller than for solar chromosphere models.\n\nThe Nature of VeLLOs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuard, Tracy L.; Pound, Marc W.; Mundy, Lee; Dunham, Michael\n\n2018-01-01\n\nVery Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are young stellar sources that are defined by luminosities less than 0.1 solar luminosity and rising mid-infrared spectral energy distributions. But, what exactly are they? Brown dwarfs or low-mass stars in formation? Systems exhibiting low accretion rates? Extremely young objects? We have completed an ALMA survey of 33 candidates in the nearby Serpens, Ophiuchus, and Lupus star-forming molecular clouds. Continuum emission at 1.3 mm, consistent with the presence of an inner envelope and/or disk, was detected toward 17 candidates, with at least 6 of these candidates exhibiting CO outflow emission, suggesting ongoing formation. We will present these observations and results, and discuss their implications concerning the nature of VeLLOs.\n\nVLA observations of dwarf M flare stars and magnetic stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWillson, R. F.; Lang, K. R.; Foster, P.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe VLA has been used to search for 6 cm emission from 16 nearby dwarf M stars, leading to the detection of only one of them - Gliese 735. The dwarf M flare stars AD Leonis and YZ Canis Minoris were also monitored at 6 cm and 20 cm wavelength in order to study variability. Successive oppositely circularly polarized bursts were detected from AD Leo at 6 cm, suggesting the presence of magnetic fields of both magnetic polarities. An impulsive 20-cm burst from YZ CMi preceded slowly varying 6-cm emission. The VLA was also used, unsuccessfully, to search for 6-cm emission from 13 magnetic Ap stars, all of which exhibit kG magnetic fields. Although the Ap magnetic stars have strong dipolar magnetic fields, the failure to detect gyroresonant radiation suggests that these stars do not have hot, dense coronae. The quiescent microwave emission from GL 735 is probably due to nonthermal radiation, since unusually high (H = 50 kG or greater) surface magnetic fields are inferred under the assumption that the 6-cm radiation is the gyroresonant radiation of thermal electrons.\n\nLong-lasting stem cell-like memory CD8+ T cells with a naÃ¯ve-like profile upon yellow fever vaccination.\n\nPubMed\n\nFuertes Marraco, Silvia A; Soneson, Charlotte; Cagnon, LaurÃ¨ne; Gannon, Philippe O; Allard, Mathilde; Abed Maillard, Samia; Montandon, Nicole; Rufer, Nathalie; Waldvogel, Sophie; Delorenzi, Mauro; Speiser, Daniel E\n\n2015-04-08\n\nEfficient and persisting immune memory is essential for long-term protection from infectious and malignant diseases. The yellow fever (YF) vaccine is a live attenuated virus that mediates lifelong protection, with recent studies showing that the CD8(+) T cell response is particularly robust. Yet, limited data exist regarding the long-term CD8(+) T cell response, with no studies beyond 5 years after vaccination. We investigated 41 vaccinees, spanning 0.27 to 35 years after vaccination. YF-specific CD8(+) T cells were readily detected in almost all donors (38 of 41), with frequencies decreasing with time. As previously described, effector cells dominated the response early after vaccination. We detected a population of naÃ¯ve-like YF-specific CD8(+) T cells that was stably maintained for more than 25 years and was capable of self-renewal ex vivo. In-depth analyses of markers and genome-wide mRNA profiling showed that naÃ¯ve-like YF-specific CD8(+) T cells in vaccinees (i) were distinct from genuine naÃ¯ve cells in unvaccinated donors, (ii) resembled the recently described stem cell-like memory subset (Tscm), and (iii) among all differentiated subsets, had profiles closest to naÃ¯ve cells. Our findings reveal that CD8(+) Tscm are efficiently induced by a vaccine in humans, persist for decades, and preserve a naÃ¯veness-like profile. These data support YF vaccination as an optimal mechanistic model for the study of long-lasting memory CD8(+) T cells in humans.

The low masses and luminosities of M-dwarf central stars make them very attractive for such exoplanetary hunts. The habitable zone of M dwarfs is close to the star due to their low luminosity. Thus possibly habitable planets will have short orbital periods, making their detection feasible both with the transit method (used by Kepler, K2 and soon with TESS) and with the radial velocity approaches. Yet habitability on a planet likely requires both solid surfaces and atmospheres, but also a favorable radiation environment. It is here that the M-dwarf central stars raise major theoretical puzzles, for many of them exhibit remarkably intense and frequent flaring, despite their modest intrinsic luminosities. The super-flares release their energy both in white light and in X-rays, and can be thousands of times brighter than the strongest solar flares. Such striking events must have magnetic origins, likely from fields built by convective dynamos operating in their interiors. Further, recent observations suggest that the surface of some M stars is carpeted with magnetic fields of 3 kG or more. Such field strengths are reminiscent of a sunspot, but here instead cover much of the stellar surface. With M stars now taking center stage in the search for Earthlike planets, it is crucial to begin to understand how convective dynamos may be able to build intense magnetic fields involved with super-flares and vast star spots, and how they depend upon the mass and rotation rate of these stars. We propose to use major 3-D MHD simulations with our Anelastic Spherical Harmonic (ASH) code to study the coupling of turbulent convection, rotation, and magnetism within full spherical domains such as the interior of an M dwarf. This permits the exploration of the magnetic dynamos that must be responsible for the evolving magnetism and intense activity of many M dwarfs\n\nOngoing Massive Star Formation in the Bulge of M51\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLamers, H. J. G. L. M.; Panagia, N.; Scuderi, S.; Romaniello, M.; Spaans, M.; de Wit, W. J.; Kirshner, R.\n\n2002-02-01\n\nWe present a study of Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations of the inner kiloparsec of the interacting galaxy M51 in six bands from 2550 to 8140 Ã . The images show an oval-shaped area (which we call the ``bulge'') of about 11''Ã16'', or 450Ã650 pc, around the nucleus that is dominated by a smooth ``yellow/reddish'' background population with overimposed dust lanes. These dust lanes are the inner extensions of the spiral arms. The extinction properties, derived in four fields in and outside dust lanes, are similar to the Galactic extinction law. The reddish stellar population has an intrinsic color of (B-V)0~=1.0, suggesting an age in excess of 5 Gyr. We found 30 bright pointlike sources in the bulge of M51, i.e., within 110-350 pc from the nucleus. The point sources have 21.48<m2550<22.0. These objects appear to be located in elongated ``strings'' that follow the general pattern of the dust lanes around the nucleus. The spectral energy distributions of the pointlike sources are compared with those predicted for models of clusters or single stars. There are three reasons to conclude that most of these point sources are isolated massive stars (or very small groups of a few isolated massive stars) rather than clusters:1. The energy distributions of most objects are best fitted with models of single stars of MV between -6.1 and -9.1, temperatures between 4000 and 50,000 K, and with 4.2M*<200 Msolar.2. In the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram the sources follow the Humphreys-Davidson luminosity upper limit for massive stars.3. The distribution of the sources in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram shows a gap in the range of 20,000Kstars, but not of clusters.We have derived upper limits to the total mass of lower mass stars (M*<10 Msolar) that could be\n\nDramatic increase in naÃ¯ve T cell turnover is linked to loss of naÃ¯ve T cells from old primates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nÄiÄin-Å ain, Luka; Messaoudi, Ilhem; Park, Byung; Currier, Noreen; Planer, Shannon; Fischer, Miranda; Tackitt, Shane; Nikolich-Å½ugich, Dragana; Legasse, Alfred; Axthelm, Michael K.; Picker, Louis J.; Mori, Motomi; Nikolich-Å½ugich, Janko\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe loss of naÃ¯ve T cells is a hallmark of immune aging. Although thymic involution is a primary driver of this naÃ¯ve T cell loss, less is known about the contribution of other mechanisms to the depletion of naÃ¯ve T cells in aging primates. We examined the role of homeostatic cycling and proliferative expansion in different T cell subsets of aging rhesus macaques (RM). BrdU incorporation and the expression of the G1-M marker Ki-67 were elevated in peripheral naÃ¯ve CD4 and even more markedly in the naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells of old, but not young adult, RM. Proliferating naÃ¯ve cells did not accumulate in old animals. Rather, the relative size of the naÃ¯ve CD8 T cell compartment correlated inversely to its proliferation rate. Likewise, T cell receptor diversity decreased in individuals with elevated naÃ¯ve CD8 T cell proliferation. This apparent contradiction was explained by a significant increase in turnover concomitant with the naÃ¯ve pool loss. The turnover increased exponentially when the naÃ¯ve CD8 T cell pool decreased below 4% of total blood CD8 cells. These results link the shrinking naÃ¯ve T cell pool with a dramatic increase in homeostatic turnover, which has the potential to exacerbate the progressive exhaustion of the naÃ¯ve pool and constrict the T cell repertoire. Thus, homeostatic T cell proliferation exhibits temporal antagonistic pleiotropy, being beneficial to T cell maintenance in adulthood but detrimental to the long-term T cell maintenance in aging individuals.

In each case, two distant companions with colors and brightnesses consistent with M dwarfs co-orbit the hot Jupiter planet host as well as one another. Our adaptive optics images spatially resolve the secondary around WASP-12, previously identified by Bergfors et al. and Crossfield et al. into two distinct sources separated by 84.3 Â± 0.6 mas (21 Â± 3 AU). We find that the secondary to HAT-P-8, also identified by Bergfors et al., is in fact composed of two stars separated by 65.3 Â± 0.5 mas (15 Â± 1 AU). Our follow-up observations demonstrate physical association through common proper motion. HAT-P-8 C has a particularly low mass, which we estimate to be 0.18 Â± 0.02 M â using photometry. Due to their hierarchy, WASP-12 BC and HAT-P-8 BC will enable the first dynamical mass determination for hot Jupiter stellar companions. These previously well studied planet hosts now represent higher-order multi-star systems with potentially complex dynamics, underscoring the importance of diffraction-limited imaging and providing additional context for understanding the migrant population of transiting hot Jupiters.\n\nThe Massive Star Content of Circumnuclear Star Clusters in M83\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWofford, A.; Chandar, R.; Leitherer, C.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe circumnuclear starburst of M83 (NGC 5236), the nearest such example (4.6 Mpc), constitutes an ideal site for studying the massive star IMF at high metallicity (12+log[O/H]=9.1Â±0.2, Bresolin & Kennicutt 2002). We analyzed archival HST/STIS FUV imaging and spectroscopy of 13 circumnuclear star clusters in M83. We compared the observed spectra with two types of single stellar population (SSP) models; semi-empirical models, which are based on an empirical library of Galactic O and B stars observed with IUE (Robert et al. 1993), and theoretical models, which are based on a new theoretical UV library of hot massive stars described in Leitherer et al. (2010) and computed with WM-Basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001). The models were generated with Starburst99 (Leitherer & Chen 2009). We derived the reddenings, the ages, and the masses of the clusters from model fits to the FUV spectroscopy, as well as from optical HST/WFC3 photometry.\n\nObservation and modelling of main-sequence star chromospheres - XIV. Rotation of dM1 stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoudebine, E. R.\n\n2010-09-01\n\nWe have measured v sin i for a selected sample of dM1-type stars. We give 114 measurements of v sin i for 88 different stars, and six upper detection limits. These are the first measurements of v sin i for most of the stars studied here. This represents the largest sample of v sin i measurements for M dwarfs at a given spectral type. For these measurements, we used four different spectrographs: HARPS (ESO), SOPHIE (OHP), ÃLODIE (OHP) and UVES (ESO). Two of these spectrographs (HARPS and SOPHIE) are particularly stable in wavelength since they were designed for exoplanet searches. We measured v sin i down to an accuracy of 0.3kms-1 for the highest resolution spectrographs and a detection limit of about 1kms-1. We show that this unprecedented accuracy for M dwarfs in our data set is possible because all the targets have the same spectral type. This is an advantage and it facilitates the determination of the narrowest line profiles for v sin i ~ 0. Although it is possible to derive the zero-point profiles using several spectral types at a time. These values were combined with other measurements taken from the literature. The total sample represents detected rotation for 100 stars (10 dM1e and 90 dM1 stars). We confirm our finding of Paper VII that the distribution of the projected rotation period is bimodal for dM1 stars with a much larger sample, i.e. there are two groups of stars: the fast rotators with P/sin i ~ 4.5d and the slow rotators with P/sin i ~ 14.4d. There is a gap between these two groups. We find that the distribution of stars as a function of P/sin i has two very abrupt cuts, below 10d and above 18d. There are very few stars observed out of this range 10-18d. We also observe that the distribution increases slightly from 18 to 10d. We find that the M1 subdwarfs (very low metallicity dwarfs) rotate with an average period of P/sin i ~ 7.2d, which is about twice faster as the main group of normal M1 dwarfs. We also find a correlation for P/sin i to\n\nModelling the dynamo in fully convective M-stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYadav, Rakesh Kumar; Christensen, Ulrich; Morin, Julien; Wolk, Scott; Poppenhaeger, Katja; Reiners, Ansgar; gastine, Thomas\n\n2017-05-01\n\nM-stars are among the most active and numerous stars in our galaxy. Their activity plays a fundamentally important role in shaping the exoplanetary biosphere since the habitable zones are very close to these stars. Therefore, modeling M-star activity has become a focal point in habitability studies. The fully convective members of the M-star population demand more immediate attention due to the discovery of Earth-like exoplanets around our stellar neighbors Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1 which are both fully convective. The activity of these stars is driven by their convective dynamo, which may be fundamentally different from the solar dynamo due the absence of radiative cores. We model this dynamo mechanism using high-resolution 3D anelastic MHD simulations. To understand the evolution of the dynamo mechanism we simulate two cases, one with a fast enough rotation period to model a star in the `saturated' regime of the rotation-activity realtionship and the other with a slower period to represent cases in the `unsaturated' regime. We find the rotation period fundamentally controls the behavior of the dynamo solution: faster rotation promotes strong magnetic fields (of order kG) on both small and large length scales and the dipolar component of the magnetic field is dominant and stable, however, slower rotation leads to weaker magnetic fields which exhibit cyclic behavior. In this talk, I will present the simulation results and discuss how we can use them to interpret several observed features of the M-star activity.\n\nStatistical studies of superflares on G-, K-, M- type stars from Kepler data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNotsu, Yuta; Maehara, Hiroyuki; Honda, Satoshi; Notsu, Shota; Namekata, Kosuke; Ikuta, Kai; Nogami, Daisaku; Shibata, Kazunari\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFlares are thought to be sudden releases of magnetic energy stored around starspots. Recent space high-precision photometry shows âsuperflaresâ, 10-104 times more energetic than the largest solar flares, occur on many G, K, M-type stars (e.g., Maehara+2012 Nature). Harmful UV/X-ray radiation and high-energy particles such as protons are caused by such superflares. This may suggest that exoplanet host stars have severe effects on the physical and chemical evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres (cf. Segura+2010 Astrobiology, Takahashi+2016 ApJL).We here present statistical properties of superflares on G, K, M-type stars on the basis of our analyses of Kepler photometric data (Maehara+2012 Nature, Shibayama+2013 ApJS, Notsu+2013 ApJ, Canderaresi+2014 ApJ, Maehara+2015 EPS, Maehara+2017 PASJ). We found more than 5000 superflares on 800 G, K, M-type main-sequence stars, and the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare energy (E) shows the power-law distribution with the index of -1.8 -1.9. This power-law distribution is consistent with that of solar flares.Flare frequency increases as stellar temperature decreases. As for M-type stars, energy of the largest flares is smaller compared with G,K-type stars, but more frequent âhazardousâ flares for the habitable planets since the habitable zone around M-type stars is much smaller compared with G, K-type stars.Rotation period and starspot coverage can be estimated from the quasi-periodic brightness variation of the superflare stars. The intensity of Ca II 8542 line of superflare stars, which is measured from spectroscopic observations with Subaru Telescope, has a well correlation with the brightness variation amplitude (Notsu+2015a&b PASJ).Flare frequency has a correlation with rotation period, and this suggests young rapidly-rotating stars (like âyoung Sunâ) have more severe impacts of flares on the planetary atmosphere (cf. Airapetian+2016 ApJL). Flare energy and frequency also depends\n\nSystemic effects in naÃ¯ve mice injected with immunomodulatory lectin ArtinM\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOliveira Brito, PatrÃ­cia Kellen Martins; GonÃ§alves, Thiago EleutÃ©rio; Fernandes, FabrÃ­cio Freitas; Miguel, Camila Botelho; Rodrigues, Wellington Francisco; Lazo Chica, Javier EmÃ­lio; Roque-Barreira, Maria Cristina\n\n2017-01-01\n\nToll-like receptors (TLR) contain N-glycans, which are important glycotargets for plant lectins, to induce immunomodulation. The lectin ArtinM obtained from Artocarpus heterophyllus interacts with TLR2 N-glycans to stimulate IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells and to drive the immune response toward the Th1 axis, conferring resistance against intracellular pathogens. This immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated by subcutaneously injecting (s.c.) ArtinM (0.5 Î¼g) in infected mice. In this study, we evaluated the systemic implications of ArtinM administration in naÃ¯ve BALB/c mice. The mice were s.c. injected twice (7 days interval) with ArtinM (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 Î¼g), LPS (positive control), or PBS (negative control) and euthanized after three days. None of the ArtinM-injected mice exhibited change in body weight, whereas the relative mass of the heart and lungs diminished in mice injected with the highest ArtinM dose (5.0 Î¼g). Few and discrete inflammatory foci were detected in the heart, lung, and liver of mice receiving ArtinM at doses â¥2.5 Î¼g. Moreover, the highest dose of ArtinM was associated with increased serum levels of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and globulins as well as an augmented presence of neutrophils in the heart and lung. IL-12, IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-10 measurements in the liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and lung homogenates revealed decreased IL-10 level in the heart and lung of mice injected with 5.0 Î¼g ArtinM. We also found an augmented frequency of T helper and B cells in the spleen of all ArtinM-injected naÃ¯ve mice, whereas the relative expressions of T-bet, GATA-3, and ROR-Î³t were similar to those in PBS-injected animals. Our study demonstrates that s.c. injection of high doses of ArtinM in naÃ¯ve mice promotes mild inflammatory lesions and that a low immunomodulatory dose is innocuous to naÃ¯ve mice.

The anomalies observed in high excitation lines in RX Pup of He II, N III], N IV], O III], C III], C IV and Si III] that show split line profiles, multiple component Doppler displaced components, and broadened blue wing emission structure in N III] and N IV] suggest motion in circumstellar material. In contrast, high dispersion UV spectra of RW Hya reveal narrow high excitation emission lines that give no suggestion of macroscopic motions in the circumstellar gas. We wish to extend observations of a selected number of symbiotic stars observed previously but in low resolution, to high dispersion in order to determine if particular M-type symbiotic stars exhibit anomalies in their line profile. As such, symbiotic stars exhibiting velocity structure in emission lines may form a subset of objects that are characterized by mass motions in their circumstellar envelops that create high excitation emission. UV line and continuum emission from other M-type symbiotics may arise from mainly photo-excitation processes that results from the intense radiation field associated with the hot secondary companion.\n\nStar-forming Environments throughout the M101 Group\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatkins, Aaron E.; Mihos, J. Christopher; Harding, Paul\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present a multiwavelength study of star formation within the nearby M101 Group, including new deep HÎ± imaging of M101 and its two companions. We perform a statistical analysis of the HÎ±-to-FUV flux ratios in H II regions located in three different environments: M101's inner disk, M101's outer disk, and M101's lower-mass companion galaxy NGC 5474. We find that, once bulk radial trends in extinction are taken into account, both the median and scatter in F HÎ± /F FUV in H II regions are invariant across all of these environments. Also, using Starburst99 models, we are able to qualitatively reproduce the distributions of F HÎ± /F FUV throughout these different environments using a standard Kroupa initial mass function (IMF); hence, we find no need to invoke truncations in the upper-mass end of the IMF to explain the young star-forming regions in the M101 Group even at extremely low surface density. This implies that star formation in low-density environments differs from star formation in high-density environments only by intensity and not by cloud-to-cloud physics.\n\nAges of M Dwarf Stars from their Alpha Enhancement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMuirhead, Philip Steven; Veyette, Mark\n\n2018-01-01\n\nM dwarf stars dominate stellar populations, and recent results from NASA's Kepler Mission suggest rocky planets are abundant around M dwarf stars. With so many planets orbiting M dwarfs, exoplanet scientists can now turn to questions about their history and evolution. Unfortunately, measuring fundamental properties of M dwarfs is challenging for a variety of reasons. I will discuss the importance of near-infrared spectroscopy in this effort. With high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy covering Y to K band, we can measure detailed fundamental properties of low-mass stars. With new techniques to measure stellar alpha and iron abundances, we can begin to measure the most challenging fundamental property of M dwarfs: their age. These efforts are even more exciting in the coming years, when the TESS spacecraft is expected to discover five times as many planets orbiting low-mass stars as Kepler.\n\nMassive pre-main-sequence stars in M17\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamÃ­rez-Tannus, M. C.; Kaper, L.; de Koter, A.; Tramper, F.; Bik, A.; Ellerbroek, L. E.; Ochsendorf, B. B.; RamÃ­rez-Agudelo, O. H.; Sana, H.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe formation process of massive stars is still poorly understood. Massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) are deeply embedded in their parental clouds; these objects are rare, and thus typically distant, and their reddened spectra usually preclude the determination of their photospheric parameters. M17 is one of the best-studied H II regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young stellar population. We have obtained optical to near-infrared spectra of previously identified candidate mYSOs and a few OB stars in this region with X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. The large wavelength coverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the photospheres and circumstellar disks of these candidate mYSOs. We confirm the pre-main-sequence (PMS) nature of six of the stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii that are consistent with being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a remnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the double-peaked emission lines provide an opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles in the disks. We compare the observed properties of this unique sample of young massive stars with evolutionary tracks of massive protostars and propose that these mYSOs near the western edge of the H II region are on their way to become main-sequence stars ( 6-20 Mâ) after having undergone high mass accretion rates (á¹acc 10-4-10-3Mâyr-1). Their spin distribution upon arrival at the zero age main-sequence is consistent with that observed for young B stars, assuming conservation of angular momentum and homologous contraction. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory at Paranal, Chile (ESO programmes 60.A-9404(A), 085.D-0741, 089.C-0874(A), and 091.C-0934(B)).The full normalised X-shooter spectra are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/604/A78\n\nDeriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters.

This study is the fifth of a series that investigates the degeneracy and stochasticity problems present in the determination of physical parameters such as age, mass, extinction, and metallicity of partially resolved or unresolved star cluster populations in external galaxies when using HST broad-band photometry. Aims: In this work we aim to derive parameters of star clusters using models with fixed and free metallicity based on the HST WFC3+ACS photometric system. The method is applied to derive parameters of a subsample of 1363 star clusters in the Andromeda galaxy observed with the HST. Methods: Following Paper III, we derive the star cluster parameters using a large grid of stochastic models that are compared to the six observed integrated broad-band WFC3+ACS magnitudes of star clusters. Results: We show that the age, mass, and extinction of the M 31 star clusters, derived assuming fixed solar metallicity, are in agreement with previous studies. We also demonstrate the ability of the WFC3+ACS photometric system to derive metallicity of star clusters older than 1 Gyr. We show that the metallicity derived using broad-band photometry of 36 massive M 31 star clusters is in good agreement with the metallicity derived using spectroscopy.

Near-infrared colors have been measured for numerous infrared sources around the O-type star Herschel 36 (O7 V), the brightest source in the field and main responsible for the nebula ionization. Several of those IR sources are identified as HÎ± emission stars from narrow-band Hubble Space Telescope images, and some of them display a knotty shape, characteristic of proplyd-like objects. Based on the NIR color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, we also identified dozens of NIR excess sources which %we selected as are prime candidates to be intermediate and low-mass pre-main-sequence stars. Additionally, we present preliminary results of the spectroscopic confirmation of some T Tauri stars among these objects, based on spectra recently obtained with the 6.5-m Magellan telescope at LCO.\n\nWASP-12b AND HAT-P-8b are members of triple star systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBechter, Eric B.; Crepp, Justin R.; Matthews, Christopher T.\n\n2014-06-10\n\nWe present high spatial resolution images that demonstrate that WASP-12b and HAT-P-8b orbit the primary stars of hierarchical triple star systems. In each case, two distant companions with colors and brightnesses consistent with M dwarfs co-orbit the hot Jupiter planet host as well as one another. Our adaptive optics images spatially resolve the secondary around WASP-12, previously identified by Bergfors et al. and Crossfield et al. into two distinct sources separated by 84.3 Â± 0.6 mas (21 Â± 3 AU). We find that the secondary to HAT-P-8, also identified by Bergfors et al., is in fact composed of two starsmoreÂ Â» separated by 65.3 Â± 0.5 mas (15 Â± 1 AU). Our follow-up observations demonstrate physical association through common proper motion. HAT-P-8 C has a particularly low mass, which we estimate to be 0.18 Â± 0.02 M {sub â} using photometry. Due to their hierarchy, WASP-12 BC and HAT-P-8 BC will enable the first dynamical mass determination for hot Jupiter stellar companions. These previously well studied planet hosts now represent higher-order multi-star systems with potentially complex dynamics, underscoring the importance of diffraction-limited imaging and providing additional context for understanding the migrant population of transiting hot Jupiters.Â«Â less\n\nSTAR CLUSTERS IN M33: UPDATED UBVRI PHOTOMETRY, AGES, METALLICITIES, AND MASSES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFan, Zhou; De Grijs, Richard, E-mail: zfan@bao.ac.cn, E-mail: grijs@pku.edu.cn\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present homogeneous UBVRI photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg{sup 2} along the galaxy's major axis. Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the UBVRI bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published UBVRI photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz photometry for complementarymoreÂ Â» purposes, as well as Two Micron All Sky Survey near-infrared JHK photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated PARSEC simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our Ï{sup 2} minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters (31%) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 (56%), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters (<1 Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clustersâboth open and globular clustersâin M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are log (M {sub cl}/M {sub â}) = 4.25, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects.Â«Â less\n\nA heating mechanism for the chromospheres of M dwarf stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiampapa, M.

P.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe atmospheric structure of the dwarf M-stars which is especially important to the general field of stellar chromospheres and coronae was investigated. The M-dwarf stars constitute a class of objects for which the discrepancy between the predictions of the acoustic wave chromospheric/coronal heating hypothesis and the observations is most vivid. It is assumed that they represent a class of stars where alternative atmospheric heating mechanisms, presumably magnetically related, are most clearly manifested. Ascertainment of the validity of a hypothesis to account for the origin of the chromospheric and transition region line emission in M-dwarf stars is proposed.\n\nThe Distribution of Massive Stars in M101\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBibby, J.; Shara, M.; Zurek, D.; Crowther, P.

We find that within it's large star-forming complex NGC 5462 WR stars are preferentially located in the core whilst RSGs are found in the halo, suggesting two bursts of star-formation. A review of our WR candidates reveals that only Ë30% are detected in the archival broad-band ACS imaging whilst only Ë50% are associated with HII regions.\n\nThe Star Formation History in the M31 Bulge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Hui; Olsen, Knut; Lauer, Tod; Saha, Abhijit; Li, Zhiyuan; GarcÃ­a-Benito, Ruben; SchÃ¶del, Rainer\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present the study of stellar populations in the central 5.5' (Ë1.2 kpc) of the M31 bulge by using the optical color magnitude diagram derived from HST ACS WFC/HRC observations. In order to enhance image quality and then obtain deeper photometry, we construct Nyquist-sampled images and use a deconvolution method to detect sources and measure their photometry. We demonstrate that our method performs better than DOLPHOT in the extremely crowded region. The resolved stars in the M31 bulge have been divided into nine annuli and the color magnitude diagram fitting is performed for each of them. We confirm that the majority of stars (>70%) in the M31 bulge are indeed very old (> 5 Gyr) and metal-rich ([Fe/H]Ë0.3). At later times, the star formation rate decreased and then experienced a significant rise around 1 Gyr ago, which pervaded the entire M31 bulge. After that, stars formed at less than 500 Myr ago in the central 130\" . Through simulation, we find that these intermediate-age stars cannot be the artifacts introduced by the blending effect. Our results suggest that although the majority of the M31 bulge are very old, the secular evolutionary process still continuously builds up the M31 bulge slowly. We compare our star formation history with an older analysis derived from the spectral energy distribution fitting, which suggests that the latter one is still a reasonable tool for the study of stellar populations in remote galaxies.\n\nThe solar neighborhood, 1: Standard spectral types (K5-M8) for northern dwarfs within eight parsecs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHenry, Todd J.; Kirkpatrick, J.

All known main-sequence stars north of -25 deg and with M(sub V) greater than or = 8.00 have been observed, resulting in 92 spectra. Based upon the stellar system density to 5 pc, we estimate that approximately 35 systems in the 8 pc sample are 'missing.' In an effort to reveal these systems, we use an empirical spectral type-M(sub V) relation to estimate distances to additional stars that may lie within 8 pc.\n\nMulti-epoch BVRI Photometry of Luminous Stars in M31 and M33\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMartin, John C.; Humphreys, Roberta M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe present the first four years of BVRI photometry from an on-going survey to annually monitor the photometric behavior of evolved luminous stars in M31 and M33. Photometry was measured for 199 stars at multiple epochs, including 9 classic Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), 22 LBV candidates, 10 post-RGB A/F type hypergiants, and 18 B[e] supergiants. At all epochs, the brightness is measured in the V-band and at least one other band to a precision of 0.04-0.10 mag down to a limiting magnitude of 19.0-19.5. Thirty three stars in our survey exhibit significant variability, including at least two classic LBVs caught in S Doradus-type outbursts.

Methods: The gravitational collapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Mâ is investigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and terminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass had been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk formation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations, while the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a stellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto the star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted energy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion wherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein all accretion energy is radiated away. Results: Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs depend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid accretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars. In the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high photospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the contrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar evolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets the floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold accretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are relatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded phase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Mâ. When compared with published observations inferring a fraction of VeLLOs in the\n\nThe habitability of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShields, Aomawa L.; Ballard, Sarah; Johnson, John Asher\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe prospects for the habitability of M-dwarf planets have long been debated, due to key differences between the unique stellar and planetary environments around these low-mass stars, as compared to hotter, more luminous Sun-like stars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field.\n\nM Stars in the TW Hydra Association: A Chandra Large Program Survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPunzi, Kristina; Kastner, Joel; Principe, David; Stelzer, Beate; Gorti, Uma; Pascucci, Illaria; Argiroffi, Costanza\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe have conducted a Cycle 18 Chandra Large Program survey of very cool members of the $\\\\sim$ 8 Myr-old TW Hydra Association (TWA) to extend our previous study of the potential connections between M star disks and X-rays (Kastner et al. 2016, AJ, 152, 3) to the extreme low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function. The spectral types of our targets extend down to the M/L borderline. Thus we can further investigate the potential connection between the intense X-ray emission from young, low-mass stars and the lifetimes of their circumstellar planet-forming discs, as well as better constrain the age at which coronal activity declines for stellar masses approaching the H-burning limit of $\\\\sim$ 0.08 M$_{\\\\odot}$. We present preliminary results from the Cycle 18 survey, including X-ray detection statistics and measurements of relative X-ray luminosities and coronal (X-ray) temperatures for those TWA stars detected by Chandra.

We present a critical discussion of M star properties that are relevant for the long- and short-term thermal, dynamical, geological, and environmental stability of conventional liquid water habitable zone (HZ) M star planets, and the advantages and disadvantages of M stars as targets in searches for terrestrial HZ planets using various detection techniques. Biological viability seems supported by unmatched very long-term stability conferred by tidal locking, small HZ size, an apparent short-fall of gas giant planet perturbers, immunity to large astrosphere compressions, and several other factors, assuming incidence and evolutionary rate of life benefit from lack of variability. Tectonic regulation of climate and dynamo generation of a protective magnetic field, especially for a planet in synchronous rotation, are important unresolved questions that must await improved geodynamic models, though they both probably impose constraints on the planet mass. M star HZ terrestrial planets must survive a number of early trials in order to enjoy their many Gyr of stability. Their formation may be jeopardized by an insufficient initial disk supply of solids, resulting in the formation of objects too small and/or dry for habitability. The small empirical gas giant fraction for M stars reduces the risk of formation suppression or orbit disruption from either migrating or nonmigrating giant planets, but effects of perturbations from lower mass planets in these systems are uncertain. During the first ~1 Gyr, atmospheric retention is at peril because of intense and\n\nThe wind of the M-type AGB star RT Virginis probed by VLTI/MIDI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSacuto, S.; Ramstedt, S.; HÃ¶fner, S.; Olofsson, H.; Bladh, S.; Eriksson, K.; Aringer, B.; Klotz, D.; Maercker, M.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nAims: We study the circumstellar environment of the M-type AGB star RT Vir using mid-infrared high spatial resolution observations from the ESO-VLTI focal instrument MIDI. The aim of this study is to provide observational constraints on theoretical prediction that the winds of M-type AGB objects can be driven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close environment (about 2 to 3 stellar radii) of the star. Methods: We interpreted spectro-interferometric data, first using wavelength-dependent geometric models. We then used a self-consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a time-dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particles to reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements of RT Vir. Since the hydrodynamic computation needs stellar parameters as input, a considerable effort was first made to determine these parameters. Results: MIDI differential phases reveal the presence of an asymmetry in the stellar vicinity. Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence of aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (<5 stellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a self-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be present in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m baseline visibility measurements around 9.8 Î¼m. This gives additional observational evidence in favor of winds driven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close vicinity of an M-type star. However, other sources of opacity are clearly missing to reproduce the 10-13 Î¼m visibility measurements for all baselines. Conclusions: This study is a first attempt to understand the wind mechanism of M-type AGB stars by comparing photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements with state-of-the-art, self-consistent dust-driven wind models.

A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe present time-series BVI photometry for the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6402 (M14). The data consist of â¼137 images per filter, obtained using the 0.9 and 1.0 m SMARTS telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The images were obtained during two observing runs in 2006â2007. The image-subtraction package ISIS, along with DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME, was used to perform crowded-field photometry and search for variable stars. We identified 130 variables, eight of which are new discoveries. The variable star population is comprised of 56 ab-type RR Lyrae stars, 54 c-type RR Lyrae, 6 type II Cepheids, 1 W UMa star, 1 detached eclipsing binary, and 12 long-period variables. We provide Fourier decomposition parameters for the RR Lyrae, and discuss the physical parameters and photometric metallicity derived therefrom. The M14 distance modulus is also discussed, based on different approaches for the calibration of the absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae stars. The possible presence of second-overtone RR Lyrae in M14 is critically addressed, with our results arguing against this possibility. By considering all of the RR Lyrae stars as members of the cluster, we derive < {P}ab > =0.589 {{d}}{{a}}{{y}}{{s}}. This, together with the position of the RR Lyrae stars of both Bailey types in the periodâamplitude diagram, suggests an Oosterhoff-intermediate classification for the cluster. Such an intermediate Oosterhoff type is much more commonly found in nearby extragalactic systems, and we critically discuss several other possible indications that may point to an extragalactic origin for this cluster. Based on observations obtained with the 0.9 m and 1 m telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile, operated by the SMARTS consortium.\n\nMASS OUTFLOW AND CHROMOSPHERIC ACTIVITY OF RED GIANT STARS IN GLOBULAR CLUSTERS. II. M13 AND M92\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMeszaros, Sz.; Dupree, A. K.; Szalai, T.\n\nHigh-resolution spectra of 123 red giant stars in the globular cluster M13 and 64 red giant stars in M92 were obtained with Hectochelle at the MMT telescope. Emission and line asymmetries in H{alpha} and Ca II K are identified, characterizing motions in the extended atmospheres and seeking differences attributable to metallicity in these clusters and M15. On the red giant branch, emission in H{alpha} generally appears in stars with T {sub eff} {approx}< 4500 K and log L/L {sub sun}{approx}> 2.75. Fainter stars showing emission are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or perhaps binary stars. The line-bisector for H{alpha} revealsmoreÂ Â» the onset of chromospheric expansion in stars more luminous than log (L/L {sub sun}) {approx} 2.5 in all clusters, and this outflow velocity increases with stellar luminosity. However, the coolest giants in the metal-rich M13 show greatly reduced outflow in H{alpha} most probably due to decreased T {sub eff} and changing atmospheric structure. The Ca II K{sub 3} outflow velocities are larger than shown by H{alpha} at the same luminosity and signal accelerating outflows in the chromospheres. Stars clearly on the AGB show faster chromospheric outflows in H{alpha} than RGB objects. While the H{alpha} velocities on the RGB are similar for all metallicities, the AGB stars in the metal-poor M15 and M92 have higher outflow velocities than in the metal-rich M13. Comparison of these chromospheric line profiles in the paired metal-poor clusters, M15 and M92, shows remarkable similarities in the presence of emission and dynamical signatures, and does not reveal a source of the 'second-parameter' effect.Â«Â less\n\nM stars as targets for terrestrial exoplanet searches and biosignature detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nScalo, John; Kaltenegger, Lisa; Segura, AntÃ­gona; Segura, Ant Gona; Fridlund, Malcolm; Ribas, Ignasi; Kulikov, Yu N; Grenfell, John L; Rauer, Heike; Odert, Petra; Leitzinger, Martin; Selsis, F; Khodachenko, Maxim L; Eiroa, Carlos; Kasting, Jim; Lammer, Helmut\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe changing view of planets orbiting low mass stars, M stars, as potentially hospitable worlds for life and its remote detection was motivated by several factors, including the demonstration of viable atmospheres and oceans on tidally locked planets, normal incidence of dust disks, including debris disks, detection of planets with masses in the 5-20 M() range, and predictions of unusually strong spectral biosignatures. We present a critical discussion of M star properties that are relevant for the long- and short-term thermal, dynamical, geological, and environmental stability of conventional liquid water habitable zone (HZ) M star planets, and the advantages and disadvantages of M stars as targets in searches for terrestrial HZ planets using various detection techniques. Biological viability seems supported by unmatched very long-term stability conferred by tidal locking, small HZ size, an apparent short-fall of gas giant planet perturbers, immunity to large astrosphere compressions, and several other factors, assuming incidence and evolutionary rate of life benefit from lack of variability. Tectonic regulation of climate and dynamo generation of a protective magnetic field, especially for a planet in synchronous rotation, are important unresolved questions that must await improved geodynamic models, though they both probably impose constraints on the planet mass. M star HZ terrestrial planets must survive a number of early trials in order to enjoy their many Gyr of stability. Their formation may be jeopardized by an insufficient initial disk supply of solids, resulting in the formation of objects too small and/or dry for habitability. The small empirical gas giant fraction for M stars reduces the risk of formation suppression or orbit disruption from either migrating or nonmigrating giant planets, but effects of perturbations from lower mass planets in these systems are uncertain. During the first approximately 1 Gyr, atmospheric retention is at peril because of\n\nStudying RR Lyrae Stars in M4 with K2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuehn, Charles A.; Drury, Jason; Moskalik, Pawel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObservations by Kepler/K2 have revolutionized the study of RR Lyrae stars by allowing the detection of new phenomena, such as low amplitude additional modes and period doubling, which had not previously been seen from the ground. During its campaign 2, K2 observed the globular cluster M4, providing the first opportunity to study a sizeable group of RR Lyrae stars that belong to a single population; the other RR Lyrae stars that have been observed from space are field stars in the galactic halo and thus belong to an assortment of populations. We present the results of our study of the RR Lyrae variables in M4 from K2 photometry. We have identified additional, low amplitude pulsation modes in the two observed RRc stars. In three RRab stars we have found the Blazhko effect with periods of 16.6 days, 22.4 days, and 44.5 days.\n\nDemonstrating the Likely Neutron Star Nature of Five M31 Globular Cluster Sources with Swift-NuSTAR Spectroscopy\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMaccarone, Thomas J.; Yukita, Mihoko; Hornschemeier, Ann; Lehmer, Bret D.; Antoniou, Vallia; Ptak, Andrew; Wik, Daniel R.; Zezas, Andreas; Boyd, Padi; Kennea, Jamie;\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe present the results of a joint Swift-NuSTAR spectroscopy campaign on M31. We focus on the five brightest globular cluster X-ray sources in our fields. Two of these had previously been argued to be black hole candidates on the basis of apparent hard-state spectra at luminosities above those for which neutron stars are in hard states. We show that these two sources are likely to be Z-sources (i.e. low magnetic field neutron stars accreting near their Eddington limits), or perhaps bright atoll sources (low magnetic field neutron stars which are just a bit fainter than this level) on the basis of simultaneous Swift and NuSTAR spectra which cover a broader range of energies. These new observations reveal spectral curvature above 6-8 keV that would be hard to detect without the broader energy coverage the NuSTAR data provide relative to Chandra and XMM-Newton. We show that the other three sources are also likely to be bright neutron star X-ray binaries, rather than black hole X-ray binaries. We discuss why it should already have been realized that it was unlikely that these objects were black holes on the basis of their being persistent sources, and we re-examine past work which suggested that tidal capture products would be persistently bright X-ray emitters. We discuss how this problem is likely due to neglecting disc winds in older work that predict which systems will be persistent and which will be transient.\n\nDemonstrating the likely neutron star nature of five M31 globular cluster sources with Swift-NuSTAR spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaccarone, Thomas J.; Yukita, Mihoko; Hornschemeier, Ann; Lehmer, Bret D.; Antoniou, Vallia; Ptak, Andrew; Wik, Daniel R.; Zezas, Andreas; Boyd, Padi; Kennea, Jamie; Page, Kim L.; Eracleous, Mike; Williams, Benjamin F.; Boggs, Steven E.; Christensen, Finn E.; Craig, William W.; Hailey, Charles J.; Harrison, Fiona A.; Stern, Daniel; Zhang, William W.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe present the results of a joint Swift-NuSTAR spectroscopy campaign on M31.
