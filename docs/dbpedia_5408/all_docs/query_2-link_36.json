        "text": "The proposed study aims at analysing a sub-urban sector in the historic centre of Qualiano, located in the province of Naples (Italy), in order to assess the seismic vulnerability of the main typology classes (masonry and reinforced concrete) in the study area and the consequent expected damage scenarios. The typological and structural characterisation of the investigated area is done through the CARTIS form developed by the PLINIVS research centre together with the Italian Civil Protection Department. Subsequently, the vulnerability simulation analysis is carried out by means of a quick methodology integrated into a GIS tool in order to identify the structural units (S.U.) most susceptible at damage under seismic events. Furthermore, in order to take into account the possible damage scenarios, a parametric analysis is performed using a seismic attenuation law in order to obtain the maximization of the expected urban losses. Finally, the site and topographical local conditions, whic...\n\nWithin the frame of the SISPYR project (Seismic Information System for the Pyrenees, 2009-2011), a seismic risk evaluation of seismic risk is presented for a cross-border zone in the Pyrenees (Saint-Beat and Luchon in France and the Val d&#x27;Aran in Spain) is presented. This area has been selected because of recent seismic activity and the importance of tourism in this region. The vulnerability of existing buildings is assessed by using the vulnerability indices proposed by the RISK-UE project. This method is based in vulnerability classes ...\n\nThis article studies the effects of the soil data and exposure data of residential building inventories, as well as their spatial resolution, on seismic damage and loss estimates for a given earthquake scenario. Our aim is to investigate how beneficial it would be to acquire higher resolution inventories at the cost of additional effort and resources. Seismic damage computations are used to evaluate the relative influence of varying spatial resolution on a given damage model, where other parameters were held constant. We use soil characterization maps and building exposure inventories, provided at different scales from different sources: the European database, a national dataset at the municipality scale, and local field investigations. Soil characteristics are used to evaluate site effects and to assign amplification factors to the strong motion applied to the exposed areas. Exposure datasets are used to assign vulnerability indices to sets of buildings, from which a damage distrib...\n\nStatistics on energy use and built density portrays Colombo as the largest consumer of energy and most significant producer of waste heat in Sri Lanka, and the city is facing extensive growth permitted by current development plans. However, Colombo Core Area is threatened by Urban Heat Island effect (UHI). Anthropogenic heat impact on UHI is crucial and its future trends need to be studied before facilitating further development. In this paper we use Local Climate Zone classification to typify the study area into zones of similar climate. This is then integrated with population data, building electricity consumption and vehicle counts to map anthropogenic heat emission at local scale, under current and projected land-use change in Colombo. Results reveal that building waste heat makes the highest impact, in comparison to vehicle and metabolic heat. Thus, building density change, electricity consumption in each building and projected land use change, could have greater impact on anth..."
