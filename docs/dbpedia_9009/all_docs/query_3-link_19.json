Tut tut.Advanced dataNPC ID9856\n\nGraves are objects that appear upon a player's death after visiting Death in Death's Office. These appear either at the spot the player died or outside the instance; a grave will not appear if the content has an Item Retrieval Service (e.g Zulrah).\n\nIf the player dies while having an active gravestone already, the items in their inventory are deposited in the previous gravestone, regardless of where the gravestone is or where the player dies, and no new gravestone is created. Entrana is an exception; dying with a grave on the island will move it to the spot the player died. Graves are indicated on the minimap with a gravestone icon.\n\nPlayers have 15 minutes after respawning to return to their grave and collect any items that were not protected on death. The 15-minute timer does not count down when a player is logged out or idle for more than 10 seconds, unless they have certain interfaces such as the bank window open. The player can find the gravestone in any world, not only the world they died in.\n\nNormally there is a limit of 56 for a single type of unstackable item to accumulate in the gravestone before the rest are sent to Death's Office. Certain unstackable items that would benefit players stockpiling 56 will instead go directly from the gravestone to Death's Office upon death, effectively limiting the gravestone to storing 28 of any one of these items. These include Unpowered orb, Pure essence, bones, metal ores, metal bars, and planks. If a player dies while their existing grave only contains these types of items, and their death doesn't send anything new to the gravestone, it will disappear regardless of its remaining time.\n\nGraves can be accessed from a distance of up to 7 tiles away. Items worth less than 100,000 are returned for free, but items worth more have a reclamation fee depending on the item's value. This fee is capped at 500,000 for graves. After 15 minutes, leftover items will be sent to Death's Office where the reclamation fee is 5% but items will be stored indefinitely. Ironmen get a 50% discount when reclaiming items either from their grave or Death's Office.\n\nThe angel aesthetic for the gravestone can be bought at Death's Office for 200,000. This change is purely cosmetic and gives no additional benefits. If you change your gravestone back to the basic gravestone you will have to pay the 200,000 fee again if want to change your gravestone to the angel aesthetic once more.\n\nChanges[edit | edit source]\n\nTrivia[edit | edit source]"
