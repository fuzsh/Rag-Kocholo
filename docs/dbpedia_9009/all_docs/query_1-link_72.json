        "text": "Tab/Accordion Items\n\nA Qualified Veteran\n\nAny former member of the U.S. Armed Forces whose service on active duty, other than for training, was terminated under honorable conditions.\n\nA veteran who is entitled to retired pay for non-regular service (i.e., service in the Reserve Components or Army or Air National Guard) or a veteran who would have been entitled to retired pay for non-regular service, but for the fact that the person was under 60 years of age.\n\nNorth Carolina Resident\n\nOnly those veterans who are legal residents of North Carolina (1) at the time of death, (2) for a period of at least 10 years, or (3) at the time the veteran entered the Armed Forces of the United States are eligible for interment.\n\nDependent(s)\n\nThe spouse, widow or widower of a qualified veteran or a minor child who is unmarried and dependent on the qualified veteran at the time of death. For purposes of definition, a \"minor child\" includes a child under 21 years of age or under 23 years of age if pursuing a course of instruction at an educational institution approved by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition, an unmarried adult child of a qualified veteran who became permanently incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability before attaining the age of 18 years is also eligible.\n\nDocumentary evidence is required to provide proof and substantiate military service, residence, marriage and children as well as dependency disability. It is the responsibility of the veteran, his survivors or legal representative to furnish any evidence necessary to establish the eligibility of the veteran or the family member before interment in a North Carolina State Veterans Cemetery can be approved and accomplished.\n\nThe primary document used to verify honorable military service is the DD Form 214. The DD Form 214 is more commonly called a discharge or \"Report of Separation from Active Duty.\" Other forms of proof may be acceptable pending verification. Veterans who are unable to locate their DD Form 214 should contact the local veteran's office or the nearest state veterans service office for assistance in obtaining a replacement copy.\n\nVerification of residence at time of entry into military service is documented on the DD Form 214. Residence at time of death and 10-year residency can be verified by North Carolina tax records, voter registration, personal income tax or property tax, employment or educational records, official records from U.S. government, state or municipal agencies.\n\nThe primary source for verification of a spouse is a marriage certificate. Dependent children may be verified by a birth certificate or other legal documents, such as adoption papers.\n\nA letter is required from the dependent's physician certifying the dependent became permanently incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability before attaining the age of 18 years. Medical records and other documents will be considered only as supporting or corroborating documents.\n\nThere is no charge for the gravesite or necessary interment services for a qualified veteran. There is however, a burial fee for an eligible spouse or family member.\n\nOnly government furnished headstones will be authorized for use in State Veterans cemeteries. There is no charge for installing the headstones. Government headstones are ordered from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs after consulting with the surviving family members.\n\nGraveside services are not permitted. Committal services will be held in the chapel or at a committal shelter on the cemetery grounds. All services are 30 minutes long. Family members and other attendees are required to exit the cemetery when the service ends. Family members may return to the gravesite after the burial of the casket or urn is complete and the area is cleared of all equipment and materials."
