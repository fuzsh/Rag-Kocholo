        "text": "In order to ship your records to you in the safest way possible, and to\n\navoid seam splits, we recommend removing the record from the jacket when shipping. That said, we will never open sealed records and do this without your permission. If you would like your records shipped to you this way, please add this option to your cart at checkout.\n\nUnfortunately we can not offer refunds or replacements based for items that have been seam split in the shipping process. The best way to defend against this happening is to allow us to open your record ahead of time and place it inside of a free protective poly sleeve.\n\nWant to see how we ship? Look for a video below!\n\nFree Shipping offer applies to US orders only. We will choose the most economical way to ship your items. If you have preorders in your cart, and opt for free shipping, all items will ship with the last remaining preorder in the order. Turntables/Speakers/Consoles are not eligible for free shipping.\n\nAll domestic Vinyl orders ship via USPS Ground (with the exception of PO Boxes, APO/FPO where we must choose USPS) for a flat rate of $7.99 + $2 for each additional item. We take great care in our packaging to ensure orders arrive to you quickly and safely. Most orders are shipped within 24 hours of your order being placed (with some exceptions, e.g. post RSD when we have a massive influx of orders) and are packaged in Whiplash LP mailers that are specifically designed to protect your records. We use 100% recyclable packing materials, from paper tape to HexcelPack, to do our small part to cut out single-use plastics.\n\n***Please note that we are not responsible for stolen packages and are not able to refund you for your purchase if your package was stolen after delivery. While we can help you file a claim, if UPS or Fedex deliver your package and take a proof of delivery photo, it is unlikely they will reimburse the missing package.\n\nInternational Orders: Please note that taxes, fees and duties are worked into your shipping fees at checkout. We know and agree that international shipping rates are incredibly expensive. Unfortunately at this time we do not feel that USPS is a reliable option for us to ship international orders so our prices exclusively reflect those of UPS or Fedex. Please reach out to us with any questions."
