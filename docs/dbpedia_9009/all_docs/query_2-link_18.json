        "text": "The geography of New Orleans is a driving factor in why above-ground tombs exist in the iconic city. When the French originally settled in New Orleans in the early 18th century, the city was surrounded by bodies of water including the Mississippi River, Lake Borgne, and Lake Pontchartrain. Being surrounded by all these bodies of water lead the city to have a high-water table. The dangers of trying to bury someone in an area with a high-water table could lead to flooding of the graves or the coffin even being displaced.\n\nThe unique challenges posed by geography and multi-cultural influences over the centuries helped shape New Orleans into a unique melting pot. You can find touches of French, Spanish, African, Caribbean, and Creole culture from buildings to food to the way the dead are buried. So it’s not just the high-water table but cultural traditions that played a role in above ground burial. The unique above-ground tombs have been the backdrops of famous movies like Easy Rider and CSI: New Orleans. Famed author Anne Rice was allegedly inspired by the Lafayette #1 cemetery when conceiving Lestat’s tomb and writing the 1995 novel Memnoch the Devil. Also, because Voodoo has such a strong presence in New Orleans, in both history and legend, the cemeteries were often associated with Voodoo. The idea of writing XXX’s on tombs became connected with legends of Marie Laveau, famed 18th Voodoo priestess, and was perpetuated by New Orleans tour guides. Even now, cemeteries can still be targets for vandalism and there is expected etiquette to follow when visiting one."
