        "text": "Researching a cemetery can be lots of work but very informative and entertaining. The shape and material of the stone, its design, and the inscription are all clues to history. Use this outline as a guide.\n\nClues from the cemetery:\n\nHow old is the cemetery? What is the oldest recorded tombstone? What type of cemetery is it? What people are buried at this location? Talk to the caretaker about the records that they keep.\n\nClues from tombstones:\n\nLog shaped - Member of Woodmen of the World\n\nBadge on it - Civil War Veteran\n\nReligious markings may indicate religious preference or church membership\n\nMarkings may indicate person's occupation, interest or hobby\n\nInscriptions - dates, names, sex, marriage status\n\nReading the Hard-to-Read tombstone\n\nJust putting water on a tombstone will often make it more readable.\n\nCleaning the tombstone to bring out words or images with shaving cream is preferable to many other cleaning agents. However, even shaving cream can be acidic and detrimental to the stone.\n\nMaking a rubbing of the tomb is an excellent way to study inscriptions, however even chalk may be damaging to a stone. Taking a photograph of the tomb may suffice. Photographs will be better on overcast days. Tip: a friend can hold a mirror to light up the stone. The added light may make your picture come out better.\n\nDifferent types of cemeteries\n\nThe church cemetery - Often located near the church and is private church property.\n\nThe public cemetery - Owned by a town, city or county and open to the public.\n\nThe private cemetery - Owners and/or caretakers are usually listed at the cemetery entrance. This restrictive cemetery could be owned and operated by a lodge, a community organization, the military, or a specific family.\n\nThe ethnic cemetery - Could be private or public and overlap one of the other types but owned and operated to support one religion.\n\nThe mass grave - A common grave for a group of people, often victims of a disaster.\n\nCommercial cemetery - These are for profit and are nondenominational.\n\nCemetery Records\n\nFamily Bibles are considered a primary source.\n\nCemetery Deeds are given to the purchasers of the plot.\n\nChurch Burial Records must keep a recording of burials.\n\nCemetery information is considered a secondary source because the information has been drawn from another source. The records where this information originated are the primary sources. Most cemeteries create at least three basic records: a chronological record of burials, a ledger that shows the identity and date of the plots, and a deed to the lot. Funeral homes may have helpful documents.\n\nCheck Historical Society\n\nVisit computer Web sites like Find-A-Grave (http://www.findagrave.com)\n\nInterview senior members of the community\n\nVisit land offices\n\nLocating a grave\n\nLate 19th century or later\n\nLocate the cemetery using a county map with cemetery locations.\n\nUncover oral history through relatives or friends\n\nUse death certificates and obituaries\n\nCheck for funeral Home records\n\nVisit a local or state historical society\n\nCheck with local genealogical organizations\n\nVisit a local public library\n\nEarly 19th Century or before\n\nFind out where they died\n\nDo an online search at Family Search (www.familysearch.org)\n\nAfter locating the cemetery\n\nCopy the dates of the marker\n\nWhat is the location of the grave from the entrance?\n\nIs there any artwork?\n\nBe aware of any mistakes that may exist on the marker\n\nNote the placement of graves in relation to each other\n\nOrganize your documents or records\n\nAs Artifacts\n\nTreat the headstone with respect\n\nDon't do anything to the stone (some compounds may be harmful)\n\nTake photographs to study later\n\nTake notes - sketch the location\n\nStones may not be present before the mid 1800s; inscribed stones were initially limited to affluent families\n\nLate 1850s cemeteries used deeds, records, and agreements\n\nLook for multiple graves with the same surname indicative of family members\n\nMake note of any symbols, images, inscriptions or epitaphs\n\nTaking a field trip to a cemetery (visit the classroom lesson Taking a Field Trip for more information.\n\nAlways check with a cemetery's caretaker to make sure that it is permissible for the entire class to visit. Inquire about the possibility of your class doing rubbings of the stones, if you are planning for your class to participate in this activity.\n\nProper Conduct for cemeteries\n\nBe generally respectful and unobtrusive\n\nAvoid loud talk and behavior that might be disturbing to those in mourning\n\nNotice there are different rituals for different cultures, but be sure students don't interrupt any ceremonies\n\nFollow posted rules\n\nNever enter a closed cemetery\n\nDon't bring pets into the cemeteries\n\nDon't walk directly on the graves. Many traditions interpret this as disrespectful\n\nNever disturb the soil\n\nDon't run in the cemetery and watch where you are going\n\nWatch and listen (wildlife, snakes, and insects may be problems)\n\nDon't eat or drink in the cemetery. You want to leave it as you found it\n\n*A note to students: Do not investigate a cemetery or any other private setting alone. Remember that there is safety in numbers.\n\nGo to PBS Teachers for more than 3000+ lesson plans and activities."
