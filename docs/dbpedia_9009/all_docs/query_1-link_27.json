        "text": "“Sacrifice, suffering, and grief are synonymous with war. A nation of families, friends and citizens, mourning the loss of their loved ones, need closure in order to start their grieving process. They need a place that represents this loss and celebrates the service and sacrifice that protect the liberties of free nations. Special days were dedicated for paying tribute to those who served since the earliest days of U.S. history. Yet, at the beginning of the 20th century, there remained no singular place for Americans to visit in order to pay tribute to those who gave all. Considering the amount of sacrifices made throughout U.S. history, it seemed natural when the U.S. Congress enacted legislation following World War I to dedicate such a place. “We have had no national expression of any sort since the war ended that would give the people an opportunity to show their appreciation of the services over there of the young manhood of the nation and it seems to me it would be a very fine thing for Congress to make some provision for a ceremony that would give the people of the country an opportunity to do that.”\n\nGeneral of the Armies John Pershing (Reference- tombguard.org)\n\n“On the morning of October 24, 1921, the French people began to gather near the town square in front of the Hôtel de Ville. Although the ceremony would not take place until 11:00AM, many were present to pay their respects. The original plan provided for an American officer to make the selection, much like the British, but at the last minute a non-commissioned officer was chosen by Major General Harry Rogers: he wanted someone that possibly served beside the Unknown Soldier in the trenches. Sergeant Edward F. Younger, of the Army of Occupation on the Rhine (assigned to the 50th Infantry), was designated to make the final selection: He was the recipient of two wound chevrons (precursor to the Purple Heart) and had fought on many of the same battlefields that the unknown candidates possibly fell. This ceremony, though simple was most impressive. While a French military band played, Sergeant Younger slowly entered the room where the four caskets were placed. Passing between two lines formed by the officials he silently advanced to the caskets, circled them three times and placed a spray of white roses on the third casket from the left. He then faced the body, stood at attention, and saluted. He was immediately followed by officers of the French Army who saluted in the name of the French people.”"
