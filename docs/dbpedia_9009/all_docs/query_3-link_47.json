        "text": "The buried man lay upon a bed of down cushions in a coffin placed in a wooden chamber – a so-called chamber-grave. At his feet lay two axes. On the coffin lid a bronze bucket, two wooden buckets and a large wax candle had been placed. The man wore costly clothing decorated with purple and red silk, as well as embroideries in red and blue. It is not known whether the deceased was Christian or pagan. The motifs on the one axe can be interpreted as both of these, but the large candle is probably a Christian symbol. The fine quality of the furnishings shows that the deceased presumably belonged to the circle around King Harald Bluetooth.\n\nThe farmer’s heavy-handed digging was followed up by an archaeological excavation, from which new information about the grave came to light. Mammen is, apart from the chamber-grave, also known for a hoard find made at the same time at a gravel quarry near the village."
