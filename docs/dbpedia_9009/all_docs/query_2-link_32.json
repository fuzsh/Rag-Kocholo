        "text": "How deep graves are dug at a burial site will depend on local practice and where you live, despite the expression of \"6 feet under\" as a common euphemism for death. It is based on the idea that the standard depth of a grave is 6 feet, but some graves in a cemetery may be 2 feet or 4 feet deep.\n\nStill, there are a lot of theories and explanations about the belief that graves are always 6 feet deep. Some of the ideas about how 6 feet became a norm for burials are more plausible than others.\n\nThis article will discuss the possible origins of the \"6 feet under\" belief. It also discusses cultural practices and legal regulations for modern burial.\n\nHow Deep Are Graves?\n\nThere is no nationwide rule that says graves must be 6 feet deep. Regulations on how deep graves are can vary from state to state and city to city. For the most part, graves dug today are not 6 feet deep.\n\nThe state of New York, for example, lacks a statewide grave-depth rule. New York City, though, requires at least 3 feet between the ground surface and the top of a casket or coffin. If the body is in a concrete vault, it needs to be just 2 feet below ground.\n\nIn neighboring Pennsylvania, the top of a vault or grave liner has to be at least 1.5 feet below ground. When there is no vault or grave liner, there must be 2 feet between the top of the casket and the surface.\n\nIn Texas, graves must be deep enough so that the coffin is covered by 2 feet of soil. Two feet is also the rule for \"green\" or natural burials, where there is no coffin.\n\nAn exception is double- or even triple-depth plots. In these plots, caskets are \"stacked\" vertically in the same gravesite. A single grave in one of these plots might be 7 to 12 feet deep.\n\nBurial depth also may be determined by cultural or religious practice. Islam, for example, calls for a depth of at least half the average height of a man or more.\n\nWhere Did “6 Feet Under” Come From?\n\nThe idea that graves should always be 6 feet deep has been around for a long time. There is no agreement about where this idea came from. Here are a few theories about why people may have decided to bury their dead 6 feet deep.\n\nThe London Plague of 1665\n\nIn 1665, London officials issued a pamphlet they hoped would help stop an outbreak of the plague or Black Death. Some people think this was the origin of the 6-foot standard.\n\nThe Lord Mayor of London ordered that all \"graves shall be at least 6-foot deep\" under the presumption that doing so would prevent the spread of disease. Unfortunately, the pamphlet didn't explain the reason for the 6-foot mandate.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this probably isn't the origin of the 6-foot standard.\n\nBetween 1665 and 1666, there were an estimated 100,000 plague victims. Many were buried in mass graves called \"plague pits.\" These graves were sometimes 20 feet deep or more.\n\nThe orders also didn't say in force long. This is because the outbreak quieted in 1666 after the Great London Fire. It's not likely, then, that the \"6-foot requirement\" had enough time to become a tradition.\n\nGravedigger Safety\n\nSome people think 6 feet was just a matter of safety. Deeper graves might need bracing to prevent cave-ins. This would be especially true if the soil was sandy.\n\nAverage Gravedigger Height\n\nThe depth could have also made grave digging easier. At 6 feet, an average-sized gravedigger could still toss dirt out with a shovel. He could also get in and out without a ladder.\n\nTo Prevent Disturbing the Corpse\n\nGrave robbery or \"body snatching\" was a serious problem during the early 1800s. This was especially true in England and Scotland.\n\nMedical schools in these places needed bodies for anatomical study. Some people met the demand by digging up fresh corpses.\n\nCemeteries had a lot of ways to deter grave robbers, including:\n\nHeavy stone slabs\n\nStone boxes\n\nLocked above-ground vaults\n\nMortsafes, iron and stone devices used to protect graves\n\nPeople may have also buried bodies 6 feet deep to help prevent theft.\n\nThere was also concern that animals might disturb graves. Burying a body 6 feet deep may have been a way to stop animals from smelling the decomposing bodies.\n\nA body buried 6 feet deep would also be safe from accidental disturbances like plowing.\n\nTo Prevent the Spread of Disease\n\nPeople have not always understood how diseases spread. During disease outbreaks, they may have feared that bodies could transmit disease.\n\nWhile it is true that some illnesses like cholera and tuberculosis can infect people who handle bodies, this is not true for other diseases like bubonic plague.\n\nStill, this may be one of the reasons why people thought bodies should be buried 6 feet deep.\n\nFolklore/Rule of Thumb\n\nAn old \"rule of thumb\" says graves should be as deep as the deceased is long. This rule of thumb has unknown origins.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the average male was 5.48 feet tall. It's possible, then, that 6 feet was just a good rule of thumb.\n\nSummary\n\nIt's not clear where the \"6 feet under\" idea came from. It might have been for the safety of the gravedigger, or to make grave digging easier. People may have also believed it would keep bodies from being disturbed or prevent the spread of disease."
