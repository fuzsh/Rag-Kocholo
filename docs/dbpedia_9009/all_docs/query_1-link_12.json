        "text": "Don Graves is the 19th Deputy Secretary of Commerce.\n\nGraves serves as the Economic Growth Coordinator for Puerto Rico, overseeing a whole-of-government effort to support the economic recovery and long-term growth of the archipelago, and is also a Commissioner of the Helsinki Commission, formally known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nGraves brings decades of experience in the private sector, government, and nonprofits to the Department of Commerce, including as an entrepreneur. Most recently, he served as Counselor to President Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. Prior to that, Graves served as Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Responsibility and Community Relations at KeyBank.\n\nDuring the Obama-Biden Administration, Graves served as Deputy Assistant to the President and Domestic and Economic Policy Director for then-Vice President Biden. He was previously appointed by President Obama as Executive Director of the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and led the federal government’s efforts in the economic recovery of the city of Detroit. Graves also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Small Business, Community Development, and Housing Policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, where he oversaw the CDFI Fund, the $4 billion Small Business Lending Fund, and the $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative. He was also the U.S. Federal Representative to the G7 Task Force on Social Impact Investment.\n\nHe has also served on the Board of Directors of the MetroHealth Foundation, the FDIC’s Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion, the Board of Trustees of the Community Reinvestment Fund, the Policy Advisory Board of the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, the Board of Visitors of the Cuyahoga Community College, the Advisory Board of the Commission on Economic Inclusion, and as Co-Chair of Cleveland Rising.\n\nGraves has a rich family history connected to the Commerce Department. His four-times great-grandparents built a successful horse and buggy taxi business in Washington that once stood at the site of the Department’s headquarters. Their son went on to own a premier hotel just blocks away and become one of our nation’s first Black patent-holders through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nGraves holds a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and History from Williams College and a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center, where he received the Dean’s Award.\n\nDownload Deputy Secretary Graves' Official Photo"
