        "text": "When you put a loved one to rest at a burial site, the last thing you think of is that you may have to move the grave at a later date. The idea is for them to rest in peace in a tranquil burial ground. Even though it’s only biological remains, and the eternal rest is symbolic, the consecrated ground of a cemetery is an ideal space for family and friends to visit the deceased person and honor their memory.\n\nDisturbing this space and having the remains exhumed and moved may seem like an awful thing to do. The thought of it is just too much for many to consider, not to mention the costs involved. However, moving a grave and remains to a new plot is far more common than one would assume, and there are many reasons why a family may wish to do so.\n\nThis article looks at why it may be necessary to move a grave space, how much it costs to move a grave, the steps to take, the legalities behind the process, and any alternatives you could consider.\n\nReasons For Moving a Grave to a Different Cemetery Plot\n\nMoving a casket and the remains of a beloved relative to a new plot can be an emotional process, and it’s not to be taken lightly. However, there are several compelling and legitimate reasons why many families choose to do this; for example:\n\nFamily matters\n\nKeeping a family and its members close to one another is one of the most common reasons for moving a loved one’s grave. If a family moves to a different state, they may wish to bring their family members to the new family plot so they can all be buried in the same state. Or, if they buy a new burial plot for future burials, they may wish to relocate the casket to the new plot.\n\nGeneology\n\nFamilies who do genealogical research may discover a “lost” relative and wish to move them closer to the rest of the family. Research may also reveal families buried in gravesites at old burial grounds that are not well-marked or recorded. In this case, the family may wish to relocate the casket and remains of the loved one to a new cemetery and give them a proper burial.\n\nCrowding\n\nIf a cemetery becomes too crowded, families may choose to find a new cemetery plot in another location so the entire family, and future generations, can be buried in the same area.\n\nTo honor veterans\n\nSometimes the government allocates a new location officially dedicated to honoring those who served the country. War veterans who qualify for burials in an official burial plot may be exhumed and moved.\n\nPerhaps the person felt uncomfortable talking about death, and their wishes only come to light later. Family dynamics may have changed, or the cemetery can no longer accommodate your loved one. Whatever the reason is to move a grave, it should be done respectfully and without disturbing others in the same cemetery. However, it’s not always possible or appropriate to do so.\n\nWhen Moving a Grave is Not Appropriate\n\nMoving the remains of a beloved relative to a different cemetery is not always the best decision. It might not be practical if the person was buried longer than a decade ago. It’s essential to consider the condition of the remains, the casket, the grave liner, and other elements that may be present.\n\nThe local climate affects biological remains and caskets; the material the casket is made of will determine its longevity. Chemicals in the soil and those used in the embalming process can also cause the casket and remains to wither away faster, especially a wooden casket. Liners made of stone or concrete can last longer, but biodegradable materials succumb to the ground over shorter periods.\n\nIf there is not much left to move, it may not be worth the emotional impact it could have on loved ones and the costs and planning involved in the process. Generally, it’s best to avoid a re-burial if the original burial took place longer than ten years ago.\n\nHowever, it may still be possible. With the correct state permits and assistance from the proper authorities, you could still move the deceased loved one’s biological remains to a new plot.\n\nIt’s important to note that biological remains pose a potential public health hazard, no matter long the deceased has been buried. The move must be done with proper planning and the necessary paperwork and can be expensive with transportation fees, funeral home expenses, and other costs that could mount up.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Move a Grave?\n\nBefore starting the process, there are several legal actions to take, and every step comes with associated costs. Just like funeral planning, moving a casket and remains to a new burial site involves hiring professionals. You’ll need to spend money on religious officials and funeral homes if you arrange a funeral.\n\nMoving a grave requires an exhumation license, state permits, and other paperwork that could become costly. Proper authorities, under the direction of an environmental health officer, have to oversee the process of having the body exhumed, and you have to have a funeral director present. There are also the costs of the vehicle you use to move the remains to a new gravesite and other additional expenses like a new casket and new headstone.\n\nIt can cost anything between around $8,000 and $20,000 to move a grave from one cemetery to another. If the new burial plot is overseas or in a state that’s far away, it could be even more costly. Before deciding whether it’s the right thing to do, it’s essential to consider these potential costs and the many steps required to move a casket and remains from one grave site to another.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide for Moving a Grave to Another Cemetery\n\nMoving a grave to a new location involves several steps. Not all of these steps can be taken care of by your local funeral home, which may have helped you with the initial burial. Depending on where the new plot is located, you’ll need to consider different laws and requirements. Here are the steps you should take:\n\n#1. Contact a funeral home and a funeral director\n\nAlthough you can undertake the process yourself and get the necessary paperwork done, it’s a good idea to talk to a funeral director at your local funeral home. Since you’ll need to have a funeral director present during the process anyway, it’s worth asking for guidance.\n\nFuneral homes will know more about local requirements and service providers. Having a funeral director who is used to dealing with death with you during this complicated and emotional process can make it a lot easier. They are not only there for funeral planning and taking care of those who have recently passed; funeral homes can also assist with body transfer plans.\n\n#2. Apply for the exhumation license\n\nBefore making firm plans for moving the grave, you must get an exhumation license. This legal permit allows you to exhume remains and move them. The legalities around obtaining state permits will vary, pending on which state and city you’re in. You have to be the legal next-of-kin of the deceased and have a written agreement from the burial authority and the owner of the grave plot,\n\nThe first step to starting the application is contacting the cemetery where the deceased is buried. If it is a church cemetery or has a religious association, you will need additional permission from religious officials.\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you may need to obtain an exhumation license from the probate court. There’s usually a fee that varies depending on the state. To find information about this, check your local government website. The death and bereavement department should have all the information you need.\n\n#3. Arrange for the remains to be transported\n\nBefore you start exhuming the buried remains, you should have a transportation plan in place. If the re-interment plot is nearby, it may be as simple as renting a hearse through a local funeral home or cemetery. If the new plot is far away, you’ll most likely require a container truck.\n\nIt’s also important to talk to the new cemetery so they can prepare for the arrival, re-interment, and grave closing.\n\n#4. Exhume the body\n\nAfter you’ve arranged for a hearse, overland carrier, or container truck to transport the remains, it’s time for the exhumation. The cemetery will do the process with a funeral director present. Sometimes, the funeral home will also arrange for a local health official to be present.\n\nIt’s up to you whether you want to be there during the exhumation. Understandably, it can be difficult to watch the process if someone close to you is being moved from one cemetery to another.\n\n#5. Move the body to the new plot\n\nAfter the exhumation, it’s time to move the body to where it will be buried again. Ensure the hearse, overland carrier, or container truck is ready to pick the remains up after the exhumation. The first stop is a funeral home. It may be necessary to get a new casket for the deceased loved one at this time. After the funeral home takes care of the new interment or funeral planning, the casket will be transported to the new gravesite.\n\nTransportation is usually the most time-consuming part of moving a grave, and it can be an expensive process. Help from a funeral home is invaluable during this part of the process.\n\n#6. Bury the body in the new plot\n\nAfter all the previous steps, you are finally ready to bury your loved one at the new gravesite. This can be simple interment or a traditional burial with a memorial service. Although the process can be highly emotional, it is usually easier to do funeral planning if you are prepared for it and it’s not brought on by a sudden loss of a loved one.\n\nThe family may choose to honor the deceased with a new headstone at their final resting place, so it’s important to factor this into the overall costs.\n\nLegalities of Grave Moving\n\nSomething else to consider is that there may be legalities to consider when moving a grave from one cemetery to another. All living heirs must be consulted if the deceased’s will hasn’t been processed yet. If anybody objects to the exhumation license, it can’t happen legally.\n\nCemetery managers and funeral home directors will require a written agreement for the exhumation and re-interment of the grave. Most professionals in the industry are well-acquainted with the rules and laws associated with moving a grave.\n\nAlternatives to Moving a Grave\n\nIf anybody in the family does not agree with moving the grave, or if it is not affordable or achievable, it may be necessary to consider alternative options that are more practical.\n\nThere are other ways to honor the legacy of the deceased loved one without going through the trouble and expense of moving the entire vault and its contents from one site to another. Many families choose to opt for a more accessible alternative.\n\nA family may agree to install a new headstone at a new site without moving the entire grave. The headstone could provide information about the actual location of the deceased to help alleviate confusion in later years. You’ll still need to purchase a new grave plot and headstone at the new cemetery, but this is a significantly less expensive process.\n\nAnother heartfelt option is erecting a family plaque in honor of deceased family members. You can keep the plaque at the family home, a cemetery, or a local park. If your dearly departed loved one was a nature lover, you could create a memorial garden with benches where family and friends can spend peaceful moments honoring them.\n\nFinding Peace\n\nIn a perfect world, we will all be buried in a tranquil resting place soon after we pass away and remain there indefinitely. Unfortunately, this is not always possible, and the person may have to be buried again in another location.\n\nMoving a grave is not something to be taken lightly, but there are legitimate reasons why many families choose to go through with it. The important thing is to respond to these changes with sensitivity. It can be a respectful process and bring closure to families in various ways.\n\nWhether you’re moving a grave for the dearly departed to be buried closer to family or your hand is forced due to cemetery overcrowding, the steps in this article are an excellent starting point. We hope that it will help you ensure your deceased loved one will rest in peace wherever their final resting place is."
