Silver Strand Beach in Oxnard, California was the birthplace of Nardcore. The band recorded studio versions of several early songs with Cruz, however the early momentum was somewhat derailed by inner turmoil and it led to him leaving the group in 1983, leaving Toucher to take over vocals just as the band was starting recording of Plug In Jesus for Mystic Records. Several more albums followed, including the Burn EP. This Island Earth,and Wreckage in Flesh, which were subsequently released on Death Records/Metal Blade Since that time Slayer covered the Toucher penned \"Mr. Freeze\" on their Undisputed Attitude album.The Dr. Know song \"Piece of Meat,\" written by Toucher and Cruz, is used on the 1998 (season two) South Park episode entitled \"Clubhouse.\"Dr. Know still managed another record, entitled Father, Son, and Holy Shit! and toured the West Coast with Stäläg 13 and Ill Repute.May 2010, Dr. Know with Hernandez and Cruz played a final gig.

He later lived at Dial House, which since 1967 has been a self-sustaining anarchist-pacifist intentional community in Epping Forest, Essex; it was here where he met Penny Rimbaud, one of the founders of the Dial House project.[3]\n\nIgnorant and Rimbaud went on to co-founded the anarcho-punk band Crass in 1977.[4][5][6][7] After Crass stopped performing in 1984, he has worked with other groups including Conflict, Schwartzeneggar, Stratford Mercenaries, and Current 93 as well as being an occasional solo performer.\n\nOn 24 and 25 November 2007 he performed Crass's entire The Feeding of the 5000 live at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, backed by guest musicians.[10][11] Other members of Crass were not involved in these concerts. \"I acknowledge and respect Steve's right to do this\", Rimbaud said, \"but I do regard it as a betrayal of the Crass ethos\".[12] Ignorant had a different view; \"I don't have to justify what I do. (...) Plus, most of the lyrics are still relevant today. And remember that three-letter word, 'fun'?\"[12] He moved to the Norfolk coast in 2007 where he volunteers as a lifeboatman.[13]\n\nWhile stranded in Sydney, Australia after a tour, Steve Ignorant, Carol Hodge and Pete Wilson came up with an idea for a new band, a more contemplative band backed by acoustic instruments. Thus Slice of Life was born. They performed for the first time at Wellingborough, UK on 25 October 2013.

Cancer said via her MySpace page: \"I'm building this to keep the spirit of 45 Grave alive, introduce its magic to new fans, and as a personal commemorative of my best memories being the driving force and front person of 45 Grave\".

Their debut album Abominator was released in 2013 through Monsterman Records, Doyle's own label.[1]\n\nAfter having formed his own band Gorgeous Frankenstein in 2007[2] and releasing an eponymous album on Glenn Danzig's record label Evilive, Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein had to deal with many lineup changes that finally led him to start over with a new project.\n\nIn agreement with Alex Story (the last vocalist of Gorgeous Frankenstein),[3] Doyle's new project was eponymously named \"Doyle\". Along with these two founding members, the group's first lineup included drummer Dr. Chud (ex-Misfits, Michale Graves era) and bassist 'Left Hand' Graham, (ex-Graves and Gorgeous Frankenstein)[4]\n\nIn 2014, Dr. Chud left the band shortly before Doyle's first \"Annihilate America Tour\" and was replaced by Anthony \"Tiny\" Biuso (former drummer of T.S.O.L., The Dickies and Hed (pe)) in August.[5]\n\nShortly after, \"Tiny\" stated that he would no longer be playing with the band, and would not continue on the remainder of the tour. He was replaced by drummer Brandon Pertzborn (Black Flag 2014–2016) just before hitting the road for the \"Abominator Tour 2015\" in March.[6]\n\nInterviewer: Stig Stench\n\nProduction by: Digital VooDoo,\n\nProduced by Marko Olsen and Philco Raves\n\nEdited and Mixed by Marko Olsen\n\nIntro/Outro Music by: Marko Olsen\n\nStig interviews Tony Adolescent of the Adolescents and the Flower Leperds originally aired August 26th 2014\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nPerforming with the Adolescents on the 2010 Warped Tour\n\nBackground information\n\nBirth name | Anthony Brandenburg\n\nAlso known as | Tony CadenaTony MontanaTony AdolescentTony Reflex\n\nBorn | February 24, 1963\n\nOrigin | Oakland, California, United States\n\nGenres | Punk rock\n\nOccupation(s) | Musician, songwriter, poet\n\nInstruments | Vocals\n\nYears active | 1979–present\n\nAssociated acts | Adolescents, Abandoned, White Flag, Sister Goddamn, Flower Leperds, ADZ, Sun & Sail Club\n\nAnthony Brandenburg (born February 24, 1963[1]) is an American musician best known as the lead singer for the punk rock band the Adolescents.
