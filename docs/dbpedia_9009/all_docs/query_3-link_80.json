        "text": "The marker usually states the name of the person who died and the dates of birth and death, and may include other personal information, images, or a quote, called an epitaph.\n\nTypes Of Headstones\n\nHeadstones come in a number of styles, including:\n\nFlat markers, sometimes called “grass markers,” which lie flat on the ground at the head of the grave, flush with the grass\n\nBevel markers, usually about 8 inches thick, which lie flat on the ground at the head of the grave and rise above the grass\n\nSlant markers, sometimes called “pillow stones,” usually about 18 inches tall, which sit flat on the ground with the front of the stone angled back, creating a wedge shape\n\nMonuments, commonly referred to as “headstones,” which are tablets standing upright out of the ground.\n\nLedgers, which are usually about 8 inches thick, lie flat on the ground and cover the entire grave. Ledgers may be engraved and used as the headstone itself, or they may also include a monument at the head of the grave.\n\nHeadstone Features\n\nMost headstones are generally made of either granite or bronze, or a combination of the two. Granite ranges in color from grays to pinks to black and browns. Engraving is often available in a variety of typefaces and styles. Monument headstones come in many different shapes and styles, ranging from more traditional rectangles to elaborate sculptures. Flat markers may be entirely flat or have built-in flower vases.\n\nRelated Article: Green Headstones and Grave Markers\n\nWhere To Purchase Headstones\n\nHeadstones can be purchased from cemeteries, funeral homes, third-party retailers, or online retailers. Remember that because cemeteries are not covered by the Federal Trade Commission’s Funeral Rule, the cemetery may not accept a headstone purchased elsewhere or may charge a fee for bringing in or installing a headstone you purchased somewhere else.\n\nCost\n\nThe price of headstones is generally calculated by weight; therefore, the larger the headstone, the more expensive it will be. The price of a headstone usually does not include any “additional features,” including engraving or adding a custom features, including a photo or image. If you are purchasing a headstone from a third-party or online retailer, the cost of shipping the headstone may also be quite high, as shipping costs are commonly calculated by weight.\n\nCemetery Rules And Requirements\n\nEvery cemetery has rules around the types of headstones it allows, including rules regarding headstone style, size, and features. Before shopping for a headstone, find out what the rules are at the cemetery you are working with. In addition, many cemeteries have relationships with headstone vendors that they will require you to work with. These requirements will inform your purchasing decisions.\n\nRelated Article: Cemeteries\n\nPersonal Advocacy\n\nMany cemeteries prefer that you purchase a headstone from them directly, or from one of their approved vendors. If you will be purchasing a headstone from a third-party or online retailer, make sure the cemetery will allow you to do so, and look into any fees the cemetery might charge for bringing in or installing a headstone you purchased elsewhere."
