        "text": "Coastal Bend State Veterans Cemetery in Corpus Christi\n\nVisit our Facebook Page\n\nThe Coastal Bend State Veterans Cemetery in Corpus Christi opened on Dec. 14, 2011. It is the fourth TSVC built and run by the Texas Veterans Land Board, under the Texas General Land Office. The current size of this cemetery is 54 acres with the potential for up to 31,500 burial plots.\n\nThis cemetery includes a covered, open-air structure for committal services, a visitor's center, a computer kiosk for locating specific graves, an assembly area for special occasions, such as Memorial Day observances, an avenue of flags and a memorial walkway for future monuments.\n\nTexas State Veterans Cemeteries are special resting places, close to home, where friends, family and fellow Texans can honor Texas Veterans. The sacrifices they laid upon the altar of freedom will never be diminished or forgotten.\n\nTexas State Veterans Cemeteries are built through a partnership between the State of Texas and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and are managed by the Texas Veterans Land Board. The burial benefits at this cemetery include a gravesite in any one of the open cemeteries with available space, opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care, a government headstone or marker, a burial flag, and a Presidential Memorial Certificate, at no cost to the family.\n\nAny member of the United States Armed Forces who dies while on active duty or any Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable may be eligible for burial in a national cemetery. Veterans whose only active duty service was for training while in the National Guard or Reserves are not eligible unless there are special circumstances (e.g., death while on duty or as a result of training)."
