        "text": "Like most things in Tunic, the Hero's Grave is more than meets the eye. Praying at this gravesite will transport you to a different world where you're surrounded by clouds and pedestals that are just beyond your reach and at the center, a large stone statue built in your image.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere are 6 Hero's Grave locations throughout the world of Tunic and each location corresponds to a particular pedestal in this spirt world. On top of each floating pedestal will be one of the 6 items you use to gain buffs in the game: Health, Potion, Defense, MP, Stamina and Attack.\n\nAt first glance there doesn't seem to much you can do here but you'll need to return to this mysterious place to restore your body after you've returned all 3 keys to the Sealed Temple and explored the Cathedral.\n\nThis guide will show you where to find all 6 Hero's Grave locations in Tunic and what buff item they correspond to. You don't need to find the Hero's Grave locations in any particular order so feel free to explore as you see fit. If you're trying to get your bearing on what warp location is nearest to a Hero's Grave, there's a dedicated Warp Hub manual page that spells it out pretty clearly. Most Hero's Graves are marked on the maps in your manual -- just look for the candle icon -- but remember that there is no map in the manual for the East Forest.\n\nLooking for something in particular? Click on the links below to jump to a specific section:\n\nHero's Grave: East Forrest\n\nHero's Grave: Eastern Vault\n\nHero's Grave: West Garden\n\nHero's Grave: The Monastery\n\nHero's Grave: The Great Library\n\nHero's Grave: The Swamp/The Cathedral\n\nHero's Grave 1: East Forest (Attack)\n\nThe first Hero's Grave is one you've already visited before. This Hero's Grave is located in the East Forest, where you first found the sword. Praying at this Hero's Grave location will allow you to collect the broken tooth, the attack buff item.\n\nThere's just one catch: the miasma is blocking both regular entrances from the overworld to the East Forest, making it impossible to travel to the Hero's Grave on foot.\n\nHere's how to access the East Forest when you're in spirit form: the solution is that you can warp there from any pedestal. Travel to the warp hub and spot this disconnected path to the right. Use your crown's power and you can warp across the gaps and access a yellow warp pad all the way over to the right:\n\nYou'll arrive in the East Forest right near the Fox statue. In case you don't remember, the Hero's Grave is marked by the wooden sign to the east.\n\nFollow the path and fight or avoid the snipers you run into. You can easily speed across and ignore all enemies and pray (press and hold A for three seconds) at the Hero's Grave to get to your upgrade item.\n\nHero's Grave 2: Eastern Vault (Health)\n\nThe second Hero's Grave site can be found in the Eastern Vault. Fast-travel to the Interior of the Eastern Vault where you fought the Siege Engine boss and then run back out through the golden doors. Run out of the Eastern Vault and once you're in the courtyard, head right until you reach the next area. The Hero's Grave will be at the end of the trail. Pray to this gravesite by pressing the A button and you'll be taken to the spirit world where you'll collect the health buff item, the pink flowers.\n\nHero's Grave 3: West Garden (Defense)\n\nThe third Hero's Grave can be found in the West Garden. From the entrance, make your way down until you see a set of stairs leading up onto a wide empty area. In the center you'll find the Hero's Grave. Kneel before the grave to teleport to the spirit world where you'll find the defense buff item, the fox statue.\n\nHero's Grave 4: The Monastery (Potion)\n\nThe fourth Hero's Grave will be found at the end of the Monastery, where you found the Scavenger's Mask. The easiest way to reach this one will be to first go to the Top of the Mountain and then take the hidden path on the right side of the Mountain Door. From there, run all the way down then follow the grassy path up and cross the wodden bridge. Follow the path behind the column and then climb up the rope to reach the exit of the Monastary. Once inside, climb down the wooden ladder and pray to the Hero's Grave to obtain the potion buff item, pink powder.\n\nHero's Grave 5: The Great Library (Stamina)\n\nThe fifth Hero's Grave can be found inside the Great Library. Fast travel there using the golden teleporter and then run back to the large room at the beginning of the library with the two winding staircases. The Hero's Grave will be in the center. This gravesite will take you to the spirit world where you can find the stamina buff item, blue mushrooms."
