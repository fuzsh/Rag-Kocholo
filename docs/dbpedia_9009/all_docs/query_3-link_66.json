        "text": "Welcome to Graceland Cemetery and Arboretum\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGraceland Cemetery is one of Chicagoâ€™s finest hidden treasures. On the North Side, amongst the everyday hustle and bustle, lies a serene yet vibrant park-like cemetery.\n\nLocated between two major Chicago cross streets, Clark & Irving Park, Graceland Cemetery is the final resting place to many prominent Chicago figures, including athletes, politicians, industrialists and many of the finest architects of the last century. Designed by visionary landscape architects, including O.C. Simonds, Graceland both serves as a glimpse into the past and a beautiful place for the future. Even with all of its 150 years of history, Graceland Cemetery is still an active cemetery and arboretum.\n\nGraceland Cemetery is pleased to announce our new online burial search and tour feature. We hope this will help anyone visiting Graceland, as well as those seeking genealogical information.\n\nPlease visit the following link to begin your search today:\n\nhttp://www.gracelandcemetery.org/burial-search"
