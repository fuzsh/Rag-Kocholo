        "text": "Any nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure.\" - Abraham Lincoln\n\nOverview\n\nOn May 30, 1986, Governor Thomas H. Kean dedicated New Jersey's first state-operated veterans' cemetery as \"a lasting memorial to those men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country's honor and freedom.\" On January 3, 1989, the cemetery was named for the principal guiding force behind its development U.S. Army Brigadier General William C. Doyle.\n\nThe facility was funded jointly by the state and federal governments and is managed by the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. It is open to eligible New Jersey Veterans; residents who are members of the Armed Forces or reserve units on active duty at the time of death; certain dependents and certain merchant marines and civilians who have been awarded veteran's status. Rules and eligibility requirements were established within the guidelines of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Washington, D.C.\n\nThe cemetery is located in Arneytown, North Hanover Township, Burlington County on Province Line Road, which intersects Route 664 to the north of the cemetery and Routes 537 and 528 to the south. Its central location, 15 miles southeast of Trenton, makes it easily accessible from the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and Interstates 195 and 295.\n\nThe cemetery is a contemporary memorial type with all grave markers flush with ground level. It covers 225 acres and was designed to accommodate 171,000 veterans and their family members.\n\nTo provide privacy and protection from the elements for the bereaved, a chapel and committal service shelter are provided. The United States and New Jersey State flags are flown in the front court of the chapel in tribute to all veterans buried in the cemetery.\n\nProfessional, compassionate service to the bereaved is the concern of the experienced staff who are ready to provide assistance and comfort to the family in their time of need.\n\nThere is no finer tribute or more appropriate final resting-place for New Jersey's valiant heroes than in a cemetery dedicated to them.\n\nAs a state shrine, Doyle Cemetery honors the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces. Approximately 13 burials occur each business day and the cemetery is visited by thousands of visitors each year."
