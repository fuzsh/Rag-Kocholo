        "text": "This page is for noncitizens in the United States who need to travel outside of the United States because of an emergency and are seeking a travel document to authorize their return.\n\nIf you are already outside the United States and need to return, but do not have your reentry permit, Green Card, or advance parole document because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, see Form I-131A, Application for Travel Document (Carrier Documentation) page.\n\nOverview\n\nIf you are currently inside the United States and need to leave the United States because of an emergency, you should know what documents you will need to reenter the United States. You also should understand whether leaving the United States could negatively affect your immigration status or pending applications for immigration benefits.\n\nIf you are returning to the United States after temporary travel abroad, you generally must have in your possession either:\n\nA valid entry document, such as a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) or nonimmigrant visa; or\n\nA valid and unexpired travel document, such as a reentry permit, refugee travel document, or advance parole document.\n\nYou generally need to apply for and obtain a travel document before you leave the United States. You may request a travel document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.\n\nFor more information, see the Travel Documents page.\n\nExpedited Processing of an Application for Travel Document\n\nIf you have a pressing or critical need to travel and must leave the United States by a certain date, we encourage you to submit a request to expedite your pending application at least 45 days before the date you intend to leave, if possible.\n\nYou may ask us to expedite adjudication of your Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, by calling the Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833) or by asking Emma. (You can access Emma by clicking on the Ask Emma icon on the top right of this page.) If you have a USCIS online account and access to secure messaging, you may submit your request there by selecting “expedite” as your inquiry type. You will be asked to upload documents in your online account to support your request.\n\nYou may ask USCIS to expedite the following types of travel documents:\n\nAdvance parole documents for noncitizens in the United States seeking to return after temporary travel abroad (including advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents);\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS) travel authorization documents;\n\nReentry permits; and\n\nRefugee travel documents.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Expedite Requests page and the USCIS Policy Manual Expedite Requests guidance.\n\nEmergency Issuance of Travel Documents\n\nIf you are in the United States and have a pressing or critical need to travel outside the United States in less than 15 days, USCIS may issue an emergency travel document. USCIS may issue an emergency travel document for an:\n\nAdvance parole document; or\n\nTPS travel authorization document.\n\nExamples may include:\n\nA requestor who has a pressing or critical need to travel to obtain medical treatment in a limited amount of time.\n\nA requestor who has a pressing or critical need to travel due to the death or grave illness of a family member or close friend.\n\nA requestor who timely applied for a travel document and requested expedited processing, but their case remains pending, and they now must travel within 15 days for a pressing or critical professional, academic, or personal commitment.\n\nTo ask about emergency processing of a travel document, call the Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833) or request an appointment through My Appointment. If your situation qualifies for emergency processing, we will schedule an appointment for you with a local field office.\n\nRequired Documents\n\nIf you have an appointment with a USCIS field office for emergency issuance of a travel document, you should bring:\n\nA completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, with any applicable filing fee (Note: Even if you already have a pending Form I-131, you still need to file a new Form 1-131, with fee, if applicable, during your local field office appointment.);\n\nEvidence to support eligibility for the travel document (see the form filing instructions);\n\nEvidence to demonstrate the pressing or critical need to travel (see the Expedite Requests page); and\n\n2 passport-style photos.\n\nAny documentation in a language other than English must include a full certified English translation."
