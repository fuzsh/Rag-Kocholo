        "text": "Eligibility for burial in a national cemetery\n\nTo qualify for burial in a national cemetery, a veteran or their dependents must meet the VAâs eligibility requirements.\n\nVeterans - Check for eligibility based on the veteranâs discharge status and when and where they served.\n\nFamily members - Spouses may qualify even if the veteran they married died and the spouse remarried. Both minor and unmarried adult children who qualify as dependents of a veteran may also be eligible for burial.\n\nGet more information about who is eligible for burial in a veterans cemetery.\n\nPre-apply for burial in a national cemetery\n\nYou can find out in advance if you can be buried in a veterans cemetery. Follow the steps to apply for pre-need eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery.\n\nYou may apply online or download and mail your application [PDF, 136KB] to:\n\nNCA Intake Center\n\nP.O. Box 5237\n\nJanesville, WI 53547\n\nIf the VA approves your application, you will receive a pre-need decision letter. Share this letter with your family to make the burial process easier.\n\nSchedule burial in a national cemetery\n\nThe burial scheduling process depends on if the deceased person previously received a pre-need decision letter.\n\nVarious U.S. states and government agencies, including the VA, maintain veterans cemeteries where your loved one may be eligible for burial. Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' & Airmen's Home National Cemetery are maintained by the Department of the Army. Find a list of national cemeteries in the U.S. from the National Cemetery Administration.\n\nKeep in mind that the VA cannot guarantee burial in a specific cemetery.\n\nScheduling with a pre-need decision letter\n\nIf there is a pre-need letter, a loved one or funeral director can request the burial. Call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at 1-800-535-1117.\n\nScheduling without a pre-need decision letter"
