Discovering how to find a personâs grave can seem like a daunting task. Because family trees can become complicated or lost, it may be difficult for you to locate the grave for each and every one of your loved ones. However, there are resources available to help you find a personâs grave.\n\nÂ© Steve Allen / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can start by sleuthing your family tree. There are websites like Ancestry.com that will make the process much easier for you, but it will cost you a fee.\n\nCollect vital information to find a personâs grave\n\nIf you are hoping to find the grave of a specific relative, then you will need to have some vital record information:\n\nFull name (first, middle, last)\n\nDate of birth\n\nDate of death\n\nLocation of death\n\nYou can find full names and birthdates on family bibles or baptismal and census records. Ask the members of your family if they have any old family documents. Sometimes, the abbreviations can be difficult to decipher. This list of genealogy abbreviations can help.\n\nThe date and location of death can be found in local newspaper obituary archives. Most archives have been converted into digital files and can be easily found through the newspapersâ websites.\n\nIf youâre really lucky, you will already have the birth and death certificates of the loved one in question and can set off to find the grave without needing to seek out other documentation.\n\nUse vital information to find a personâs grave\n\nArmed with the proper vital information, you can now take a few different routes to find a person's grave:\n\nContact funeral homes that were in business during the time of death and see if they have any records of your ancestor: In most cases, you will be told which cemetery to search.\n\nContact the city or county clerkâs office: Ask for the Vital Records Department. If you get a recording, leave a message and wait seven to ten days for a call back. (In some states, like Arizona, vital records are private or sealed and you need to prove you are a relative of the deceased and pay a fee for any information.)\n\nGo online to a burial website dedicated to locating gravestones: BillionGraves.com and FindAGrave.com are the two leading sites for this purpose. Volunteers take photos of gravestones and regularly upload them to both of these sites. Simply enter the vital information and the site will tell you where a person is located and will usually include a photo of the gravestone.\n\nHow to find a person's grave after you find the cemetery\n\nOnce youâve established whether the person was cremated or buried and which cemetery contains the grave, take the time to look up the cemeteryâs website. Most modern cemeteries have websites with maps making relatives and family plots easy to find. If the cemetery is small and has no website, you will need to contact the caretaker or administrator and ask them for the location of the grave.\n\nKeep in mind, no two cemeteries are the same. Because plots are purchased and families are often buried together, you will find that there is no logical pattern to where grave sites are located.\n\nThe standard cemetery map breaks down locations into blocks, lots, and sections. These numbers can be found engraved on the side of most gravestones. For example:\n\nThe red area indicates that a grave would be located in block 1, lot 4, section 6 of the cemetery.\n\nAfter you have found the resting place of your lost relative, you may choose to lightly clean the headstone with a dry brush, trim grass, plant flowers, do charcoal rubbings, take photos, or just visit on Memorial Day.\n\nDo not use cleaning agents on gravestones because headstones are porous and can be easily damaged by chemicals.\n\nCheck here to learn more about genealogy."
