        "text": "A man retraces the footsteps of his lost love. David embarks on a journey to the troubled heart of India, where his girlfriend Mumtaz was last seen. Her death has hit him hard. Mumtaz was a photographer. David’s only remaining clue as to how she spent her final days is one of her photos which depicts a small boy. In search of the boy, he meets the ageing, cynical Dr Sharda whom he asks for help. But before long David finds himself confronted with Sharda’s dark past - a past that Mumtaz documented in her photographs. It transpires that Sharda is the commander of a camp where boys are trained to fight the exploitative state.\n\nWhen one of the boys deserts, the collective anger of the group turns against the boy’s brother, Krishna. At the same time, Radha, a young girl fleeing violent attacks on her village, reaches the nearest town. Set against the backdrop of a left-wing uprising, Dust walks the line between the world of memory and the brief sparks of a possible future and creates a multilayered portrait of people caught up in an inhumane conflict.\n\nby Udita Bhargava\n\nwith Morten Holst, Vinay Pathak, Abu Bakr Golu, Kalyanee Mulay, Babita Goyal, Meghna Agarwal, Amrita Bagchi Germany / India 2019 Hindi, English 80’ Colour World premiere\n\nWith\n\nMorten Holst (David)\n\nVinay Pathak (Dr. Sharda)\n\nAbu Bakr Golu (Krishna)\n\nKalyanee Mulay (Radha)\n\nBabita Goyal (Young Radha)\n\nMeghna Agarwal (Radha's Friend)\n\nAmrita Bagchi (Mumtaz)\n\nCrew\n\nWritten and Directed by Udita Bhargava Cinematography Philipp Meise Editing Anders Villadsen Music Alexandra Barkovskaya Sound Design Persefoni Miliou Sound Alexandra Praet Costumes Nandita Shah Make-Up Franziska Mayntz Assistant Director Aakash Jamra Production Managers B.
