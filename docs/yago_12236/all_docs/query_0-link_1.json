You can watch it on vimeo, though, if you're interested and I would highly recommend it!\n\nThe quiet dialogues and the breathtaking cinematography along with the beautiful soundtrack and the set design were so aesthetically pleasing to me, I could watch it again right now. I also really love apocalyptic movies where the focus is not the tragedy itself (we never get to know what actually happened here) but the aftermath; how people adapt and live on in the new world.\n\nThe depiction of the deserted landscape, where every street, car and house seems to have been overgrown and forgotten, and the feeling of complete solitude is what really got under my skin. The codependency between the twins, which was really well portrayed, also stems from the fact that there's no one else around anymore."
