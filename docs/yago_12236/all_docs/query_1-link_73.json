        "text": "Hit video game franchise Just Cause has gotten a new lease on life.\n\nThe video game from Square Enix and Avalanche Studios has landed at Universal Pictures with Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto set to helm the adaptation.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nBox Office: John Krasinski's Ryan Reynolds Starrer 'IF' Improves to $35M Opening for No. 1 Finish\n\nEva Mendes Jokingly Reveals Why She's OK With Ryan Gosling Kissing Emily Blunt in 'The Fall Guy'\n\nBox Office: 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' Climbs Higher to $58.5M U.S. Opening, $131.2M Globally\n\nKelly McCormick and David Leitch, the producing duo behind the studio’s The Fall Guy and Nobody, will produce through their 87North banner. The company has a first-look deal with Universal.\n\nAlso producing are Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen. The team is already involved in the video game space with adaptations of the Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog titles.\n\nSince its 2006 debut, the video game puts players on deadly missions as Rico Rodriguez, an operative who is a regime change specialist. Armed with a grappling hook and wingsuit, he goes on race-against-time missions to stop The Black Hand, a lethal mercenary group.\n\nA feature adaptation spent the better part of a decade being developed by Constantin Film and saw creatives such as Brad Peyton and Derek Kolstad fly in and out before the rights eventually lapsed.\n\nUniversal jumped at the chance for the adaptation, as the studio sees the title as part of the rising wave of video game adaptations that seem to be supplanting the superhero genre at the box office. In 2023 alone, the studio found hits with The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy’s, which grossed over $1.4 billion and $290 million respectively in the global box office.\n\nDan Jevons will executive produce. Max Jacoby will overseeing the project for 87North. Senior vp of production development Ryan Jones and director of development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio.\n\nSoto’s Blue Beetle was the first major superhero movie to center on a Latino hero and garnered positive reviews when it was released last year. He is currently in prep for action movie The Wrecking Crew for Amazon MGM that will star Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista. He is also co-writing a Transformers spinoff with Marco Ramirez that he may direct for Paramount.\n\nSoto is repped by CAA and Redefine Entertainment.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter"
