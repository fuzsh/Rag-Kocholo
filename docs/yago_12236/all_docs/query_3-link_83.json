        "text": "“I just fundamentally disagree with Jonathan on this,” Cohen said on the podcast “Unholy: Two Jews on the News.” The conversation with Cohen begins at the 29:22 mark. “My support for Israel is unwavering. I believe very strongly that the war and the continuation of the war is the responsibility of Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization which continues to hold and abuse the hostages. And which doesn’t use its tunnels to protect the innocent civilians of Gaza, but use it to hide themselves and allow Palestinians to die.”\n\nHe continued, “John has the right to say what he wants to say, but I don’t agree with what he said.” Still, Cohen did not sign onto the letter condemning the speech. It has not been confirmed whether Cohen was approached to sign.\n\nThe official X account of the Auschwitz Memorial in Poland weighed in four days after Glazer’s speech. “In his Oscar acceptance speech, Jonathan Glazer issued a universal moral warning against dehumanization,” Auschwitz Memorial Director Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywiński wrote. “His aim was not to descend to the level of political discourse. Critics who expected a clear political stance or a film solely about genocide did not grasp the depth of his message. ‘The Zone of Interest’ is not a film about the Shoah. It is primarily a profound warning about humanity and its nature.”\n\nAs of this writing, Glazer himself hasn’t spoken publicly since the Oscars.\n\nThe full text of the letter is below:\n\n“We are Jewish creatives, executives and Hollywood professionals.\n\n“We refute our Jewishness being hijacked for the purpose of drawing a moral equivalence between a Nazi regime that sought to exterminate a race of people, and an Israeli nation that seeks to avert its own extermination.\n\n“Every civilian death in Gaza is tragic. But Israel is not targeting civilians. It is targeting Hamas. The moment Hamas releases the hostages and surrenders is the moment this heartbreaking war ends. This has been true since the Hamas attacks of October 7th.\n\n“The use of words like ‘occupation’ to describe an indigenous Jewish people defending a homeland that dates back thousands of years, and has been recognized as a state by the United Nations, distorts history.\n\n“It gives credence to the modern blood libel that fuels a growing anti-Jewish hatred around the world, in the United States, and in Hollywood. The current climate of growing antisemitism only underscores the need for the Jewish State of Israel, a place which will always take us in, as no state did during the Holocaust depicted in Mr. Glazer’s film.”"
