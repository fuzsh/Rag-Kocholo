M. Coetzee novel In the Heart of the Country. The film was shot in Spain and is a French-Belgian production.[1] The film was selected as the Belgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 58th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[2] It won the Silver Lion prize, awarded to the best first or second major work by a director, at the 1985 Venice Film Festival. The jury recognised Jane Birkin's performance as amongst the best of the year, but decided not to award a best actress prize because all of the actresses they judged to have made the best performances were in films that won major awards.[3]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of submissions to the 58th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nList of Belgian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
