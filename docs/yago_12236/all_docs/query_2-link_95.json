Between agricultural weekend work and partying, dealing with other adolescent boys and girls, one kiss can make a big difference. The urge to fit in, to uphold image, and peer pressure makes the boys both having to make choices that will affect their friendship.",

        "text": "Ugh. I felt this. Especially for both of the main characters.\n\nThis was more about best friends and their relationship. Granted they experimented and that’s what friends sometimes do.\n\nIt just sucks how Alko was torn between his asshole, homophobic, toxic friends and his true friend who happens to be gay.\n\nThe story of a lot of confused guys.\n\nAre you willing to go up against society for a person or go up against a person because of society. Alko chose the latter. But was the affirmation and support of the society worth it more than a friend. By the end we can see he regretted his choice but it was too late to turn back what has been done. Can't fault Alko tho as he was pressured to do something that would save him from humiliation, in turn sacrificing his friend to save his own skin. Be warned that this short is brimming with toxic masculinity."
