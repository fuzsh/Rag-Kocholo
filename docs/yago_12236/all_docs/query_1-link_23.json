        "text": "As noted in last Monday’s post, December is going to be the month of obscure films here. I’ve been compiling a list of films I want to see with under 1,000 IMDb votes, and alongside each title I’ll include the number of votes, as of this writing, in square brackets. I’ll even divide the films into tiers based on their number of votes, though just what application such tiers would have is at the moment unclear:\n\nDiamond: 0-100 votes\n\nGold: 101-250 votes\n\nSilver: 251-500 votes\n\nBronze: 501-750 votes\n\nHonorable Mention: 751-999 votes\n\nThe films I see will be a mix of first-time views and rewatches, of films I own on VHS and DVD, as well as films available via streaming or elsewhere online. I hope to unearth a few hidden gems, but also to find some real dreck. It’s been a while since I’ve seen any.\n\nI’m starting with a double-feature DVD Warner Brothers put out in 2009, containing two movies with a combined 640 votes on the IMDb—you might wonder why they bothered, but I scored a used copy for a whole dollar and here we are. And I began by watching the more obscure of this obscure pair…\n\nThe Great Bank Hoax (1977) – *** [144]\n\nThere’s a promising idea at the heart of The Great Bank Hoax; the managers of a small-town bank discover that someone—they don’t know who—has embezzled $109,000 from them, and to cover up for their own incompetence, decide to stage a robbery. And only after the robbery has occurred does the embezzler come forward: it’s the chief clerk of the bank, who had taken the money only to prove some kind of a point about how easily it could be done. And things only get more complicated from there, as greed and guilty consciences duke it out amongst the growing number of participants.\n\nAnd it’s got quite a solid cast, with Ned Beatty, fresh off an Oscar nomination, as the bank’s controller, Burgess Meredith, fresh off two consecutive nominations, as the bank’s VP, Richard Basehart (past his peak but still a respected character actor) as the bank’s president, Michael Murphy as the local pastor, Arthur Godfrey in a small role as the kind of pillar of the community who doesn’t really do anything but does it with dignity, and Paul Sand as the clerk who finds himself in an ever-more complicated position. Oh, and Constance Forlund as an insurance agent who wants to live beyond her means, and Charlene Dallas (who’s coincidentally in another film I’ll probably watch this month) as a teller at the bank with a trick or two up her own sleeve.\n\nBut the film never quite comes together, and maybe another look at that cast of characters gives you a hint as to why. Or maybe another look at the poster, which tries to be a bit funny and a bit sexy and a bit weird. Or maybe a rundown of the titles the film bore before it was officially released: Remember Those Poker-Playing Monkeys, Shenanigans, and The Great Georgia Bank Hoax. They all suggest a film that can’t quite decide what it wants to be, what tone it wants take, or which story it wants to tell.\n\nMuch of the time it seems to be aiming for a satire on society. But other times it seems to be a bit of a farce (Basehart’s penchant for fainting, the scene of him and Meredith on a tandem bike). And of course, it’s also trying to be a caper film. And while it mainly focuses on the three bank managers and the clerk, the teller becomes a more prominent character as the film goes on. And the insurance agent is set up to be a major supporting character, but she mostly disappears after the first act. And there’s yet another character who pops up near the end (played by Alex Primrose), who the film seems to be setting up as a major figure in the third act, but who doesn’t really do anything.\n\nThat’s an awful lot for a film that runs just 89 minutes to have on its plate, and it ends up being something of a mess. There are a number of twists and turns as the plot thickens, and by the end you might not really be sure who was up to what or why. It doesn’t help that it’s never quite as clever or as funny as it seems to want to be; there’s a lot of promise and just not that much payoff.\n\nMost of the fault probably has to lie with writer-director Joseph Jacoby. Jacoby’s had an odd little career, making only five films over a nearly 40-year span; first there was the softcore drama Shame, Shame, Everybody Knows Her Name, then the comedy-drama Hurry Up, or I’ll Be 30 (probably best known for being one of Danny DeVito’s earliest films), then this film, then a long hiatus until 1995’ Davy Jones’ Locker, a hour-long children’s special featuring the Bil Baird marionettes, and finally 2008’s A Case of Mistaken Identity?, about Jacoby’s attempts to track down his unknown father.\n\nIt’s a curious little body of work, and one that’s drawn a bit of notice (he merited a MoMA retrospective some years back), but based on Hoax, it’s not especially surprising he never hit the big time. His staging lacks much flair, and he doesn’t get that much from most of the cast, who tend to underplay when a little more vigor would be welcome. His writing, as noted, doesn’t help much; he does craft a few good scenes, especially when the managers are trying to make sense of it all, but it’s missing a certain spark. Arthur B. Rubinstein’s score tries to add a touch of humor to the proceedings, but it feels forced.\n\nThe cast is mostly fine, but nothing special; Beatty is low-key to the point of blending into the scenery, Basehart mostly just moans and swoons, and Sand is a fairly average nebbish. But Meredith is a pip as the wily old VP, the kind of man who rarely says anything outright, but implies beautifully. You get the feeling he was prepared to pull off a robbery (mock or not) long before the opportunity presented itself, and when the others begin to have doubts and crises of conscience, he keeps a cool head and puffs his cigar. He easily walks off with the film.\n\nNot that the rest of the film poses much of a challenge. It’s not bad, I should note; it’s quite watchable, and when Meredith is around it can be actively enjoyable. But you have to wonder if it got whittled down in the editing, or if the script just read better than it played. But that question, and the questions of it came to be made, how Warner Brothers came to distribute it (it seems to have been independently produced and acquired by them after playing some festivals), and just what the hell Joseph Jacoby’s career trajectory is about remain mysteries to me.\n\nScore: 68\n\nThe Great Bank Robbery (1969) – ** [496]\n\nIf The Great Bank Hoax had a solid pedigree, The Great Bank Robbery’s lineage was downright sparkling. First, there’s the cast: Zero Mostel, Kim Novak, Clint Walker, Claude Akins, Akim Tamiroff, Larry Storch, John Anderson, Sam Jaffe, Mako, Ruth Warrick, John Fiedler, Norman Alden, and Elisha Cook Jr. Then there’s the crew: screenwriter William Peter Blatty, composer Nelson Riddle, songwriters James Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp, and veteran TV and occasional film director Hy Averback. It’s a film with talent to burn.\n\nAnd burn it does, because it’s an astonishingly unfunny film. Oh, it could’ve been worse—it could’ve been even more offensive, even more incoherent, even more wasteful of its cast—but it’s quite un-good enough. It has that most lethal quality of comedies, that ability for the viewer to sense how desperately the actors are trying to sell the material. You can get marks for trying that way, but you almost never get laughs.\n\nAt some point in the late 19th century, in the Texas town of Friendly, there’s a bank no one can rob; its security system was designed by bank robbers (it involves iron gates and Gatling guns), and it has a secret basement vault where numerous robbers have stashed their loot. Naturally, the film revolves around the efforts to rob this bank, but there’s a twist: there are three groups trying to rob the bank, and they all try to do so on the same morning. Mayhem ensues.\n\nThe first group comprises a bogus preacher (Mostel), his alluring assistant (Novak), an explosives expert (Fiedler), an artist (Jaffe), and a digger (Peter Whitney). The second is a Mexican gang led by a patriarch (Tamiroff) and his bumbling, desperate-for-approval son (Storch). The third is backed by law enforcement trying to get evidence of the bank’s criminal activities, and comprises a Texas Ranger (Walker), a Secret Service agent (Mako), and a group of Chinese railway workers. There’s also a paranoid bandit (Akins) and his nervous partner (Cook), a local woman (Warrick) desperately in love with Mostel, and a balloonist (Alden).\n\nIf that sounds like a lot to keep straight, it is, and the film doesn’t really manage to do so, nor does it give most of these characters anything really worthwhile to do. There are some good moments and promising elements, like Mostel covering up the sounds of tunneling by leading the church’s children’s choir in a knockabout musical number, “Rainbow Rider,” a clear successor to “Swinging on a Star,” which Van Heusen co-wrote a quarter of a century previous. And there’s one line I actively liked: as Mostel’s gang is trying to escape via balloon, he asks the less-than-competent Alden, “Can you still get us to California?” After a beat, Alden replies, “Would you settle for Oklahoma?”\n\nBut for the most part, it’s a lot of flailing farce, half-baked characters and storytelling, and jokes that just fall flat. More than that, it has a rather dark streak, possibly betraying Blatty’s hand: the film opens with a robbery during which quite a few presumably innocent characters are shot, and later a major supporting character is rather unceremoniously gunned down. This wouldn’t be an issue if the film knew how to handle it, but Averback plays it all so broadly and breezily that it just doesn’t work. And nothing could salvage the squirm-inducing racial caricatures, most notably Storch’s absurdly tacky performance.\n\nIndeed, the performances do fairly little to help. Mostel is watchable as ever, but he basically settles for playing Max Bialystock in a cassock. And Walker gives a game performance as the hunky, slightly dense Ranger, who has to spend much of the film posing as a laundryman. But Novak, who had already begun to dial down her acting career for personal reasons, seems embarrassed by the material and gives a strange, overly mannered performance; the film tries to attribute some of the character’s eccentricities to a penchant for peyote candy, but bungles getting any humor out of it—though it tries, in a scene where she feeds Walker some of her edibles and he forgets his own name. No one else is especially good, and some are fairly bad; Akins in particular feels out-of-place in a broad comedy.\n\nThe Great Bank Robbery, as I noted, could’ve been worse. Most of the time it just plain doesn’t land, and that’s quite bad enough for a comedy. It does have a decently classy production, but when the material is so lacking, or when it devolves into such sloppy chaos in the end as this film does, class counts for very little.\n\nScore: 49\n\nRed Garters (1954) – *** [319]\n\nRed Garters begins with the following notice:\n\nYou are about to see a new kind of “western.”\n\nWe hope you won’t take it too seriously, because our story takes place in a land that never existed, called,\n\nLimbo County, California.\n\nAfter a brief musical number and the opening credits, we get another:\n\nmany people have said:\n\n“THE MOVIES SHOULD BE MORE LIKE LIFE”\n\nand a wise man answered: “NO!\n\nLIFE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THE MOVIES”\n\nWhether these were intended all along or inserted at the insistence of a nervous studio I can’t say, but they suggest Paramount lacked much confidence in the film’s unique style. Not so much the fact that it’s a comic Western—or even so much that it’s a self-conscious send-up of a the genre—but the fact that it all takes place on bizarre, stylized settings, where buildings have no walls (and what would hang on a wall hangs in mid-air), where the skies and ground are bright yellow (blue at night), and the saloon is a stage and bar set against a sea of red.\n\nThe effect is essentially that of a stage set, and according to the IMDb, it was meant to be seen in 3D, which would make watching the film like watching a live show. It was never released as such, and audiences at the time didn’t take to the film’s form or content, and an Oscar nomination for Color Art Direction notwithstanding, it’s been mostly forgotten and not highly regarded by those who have seen it.\n\nBut honestly, I quite enjoyed it, though I’ll admit it’s far from a great film. The story is pretty slight: a young gunslinger, Reb Randall (Guy Mitchell) comes to Limbo County to find out who killed his brother, arriving just as the town is having a barbecue to celebrate his death. He stirs up trouble right away without meaning to, flirting with Susana (Pat Crowley), whose highly protective guardian, Jason Carberry (Jack Carson), is the de facto leader of the place. He then outdraws Jason and matches local tough guy Rafael Moreno (Gene Barry) in a fight; they become best friends in the process. Meanwhile, Bostonian Judge Winthrop (Reginald Owen) has come to town with his niece Sheila (Joanne Gilbert) in tow, to investigate the lawlessness of the West.\n\nJason insists there’s none to speak of, simply that the people of Limbo County live by the “code of the West,” which essentially dictates that a man take the law into his own hands. Ergo, Reb is quite free to find and kill the man who killed his brother. But Calaveras Kate (Rosemary Clooney), the star performer at the saloon and Jason’s girlfriend (although he flirts with every girl he encounters), is getting quite tired of all the bloodshed, and intends to do something to stop it, the code be damned. When Reb discovers that Rafael had a shootout with his brother the night he was killed, they reluctantly agree to duel, but Kate intervenes at the last second.\n\nThe rest of the film follows the town’s attempts to force Reb and Rafael to follow the code, Reb’s romance with Susana, Rafael’s romance with Sheila, Kate’s romance with Jason, building up to the revelation of the real villain—and, this being a comedy, a happy ending for the lovers.\n\nThe story is really mostly there to frame the song-and-dance numbers; many of them center around Clooney, of course, including the title number, the torch song “Bad News,” and the very solid ballad “Brave Man.” But there’s also Mitchell’s theme song “A Dime and a Dollar,” Gilbert’s solo “This is Greater Than I Thought,” and a comic duet for Clooney and Mitchell, “Woman and Man.” And there are several big dance sequences, including an all-too-brief bit with Buddy Ebsen and the saloon’s chorus girls. The songs aren’t incredibly memorable for the most part, but they’re tuneful and performed with vigor.\n\nIndeed, the film as a whole is played with high spirits. Clooney is brassy and snarky, Carson is oafish and blustering, Mitchell is boyishly cheerful, and so forth. The acting isn’t great, but everyone involved seems to have had a good time, and we have fun watching them, just as I (and connoisseurs of scenography) will enjoy looking at the sets and costumes in glorious Technicolor. It’s just a lively, fun, eye-filling little movie.\n\nBut it should’ve been even better, and Michael Fessier’s script is what really holds it back. The dialogue itself is mostly fairly flat; it’s too wordy and not pointed enough for the send-up of Western tropes to really catch fire. And there are a few elements which age pretty badly; early on, we see a young boy playing with a pistol and complaining that he’s being punished for “shootin’ up the schoolhouse.” Obviously no one died, but it’s pretty hard not to squirm at the line nowadays.\n\nAnd there’s the character of Minnie Redwing (Cass Daley), a Native American woman who provides some of the broader humor in the film—although it’s worth noting that, on the whole, she and the other Native characters seem to be full and equal members of the community. But Daley was white and plays the role in heavy red-face, and there’s just no getting past it. She gives a spirited performance and mostly avoids out-and-out caricature, but the very conception of the character dates the film in ways one shouldn’t overlook.\n\nStill, with those caveats, I mostly really enjoyed Red Garters. It’s a film that’s greater than the sum of its parts, mainly thanks to the sheer zest of it all. It’s a hard film to recommend broadly, but it’s certainly worth a look for Western buffs and anyone who likes these singular anomalies of the studio system.\n\nScore: 76\n\nHit! (1973) – *** [462]\n\nHit! had been on my to-watch list for some time, and I majorly lucked out when I found a used copy for a couple of dollars. But until I found out that it met my criteria for obscurity, I hadn’t especially prioritized actually watching it. And having done so…I can’t say I was missing all that much, although it’s a passable slice of slam-bang schlock.\n\nAmerican agent—probably CIA, but it’s never specified—Nick Allen (Billy Dee Williams) wants revenge after his teenage daughter dies of a heroin overdose. But he doesn’t want to go after local pushers; he wants to cut the supply off at the source by taking out the top members of the Marseilles syndicate. His boss (Norman Burton) refuses to support him, so Nick goes rogue, assembling his own team of specialists, who have their own reasons for revenge on the drug trade:\n\na former Navy frogman (Richard Pryor) whose wife was killed by a junkie;\n\na prostitute who speaks perfect French (Gwen Welles) and is addicted to heroin;\n\na middle-aged couple (Sid Melton and Janet Brandt) who are implied to be former Mossad or Shin Bet agents and whose son died of an overdose;\n\na college professor and former sniper (Paul Hampton) who’s apparently lying on his tax returns;\n\nand a Chicago cop (Warren Kemmerling) who’s a surveillance whiz and is fed up with pushers getting off on technicalities.\n\nThe film then follows their training, Nick’s attempts to evade the agents sent to stop him, and (after a hiccup or two) the mission itself, which features deaths by stabbing, shooting, poisoning, harpooning, and a rocket launcher.\n\nThe third act is the best part of the film; director Sidney J. Furie stages the action with vigor and a dash of violent flair. The villains aren’t so vividly drawn that we’re glad to see them taken down, but we’re glad for the heroes, more or less. The third act is also, for the most part, the least dependent on the script, and since the script is pretty lacking, that’s all for the better. There are some good set pieces and effective moments earlier on, but none of it—nor the third act itself, if we’re being really honest—is all that memorable, and the script, an amalgam of The French Connection, Dirty Harry, and The Dirty Dozen, is heavily to blame.\n\nThe characters, for the most part, just don’t have that much to them. For most of them, that isn’t a fatal flaw; they’re the colorful supporting characters in a team-on-a-mission picture, and they only need a scene or two to reveal any greater depth. But with Nick it’s a different matter, because it would really behoove the script to give him a few more dimensions than it does. Nick does some pretty manipulative things to get his crew on his side: he taunts Welles with the horrors of withdrawal, takes Pryor to the prison where his wife’s killer is being held and lets him whale on the man for a bit, and hires a young man to pose as a junkie to pull at Melton and Brandt’s heartstrings. He also, after a scene or two of brooding silence over his daughter’s death, switches into a sly, slick, smooth-talking mode, and stays there for most of the rest of the film, save a few moments of righteous anger.\n\nAll this would be less of a problem if the film interrogated his behavior, made him more of an antihero a la Popeye Doyle or Harry Callahan, or just developed him better so that his emotional gear-shifting would be smoother. But he’s unequivocally the good guy, a little bit of a hard-ass at times but ultimately in the right, and fully justified in getting that pesky rule-of-law out of the way so he can pursue justice. And if that ever went down smoothly, it sure doesn’t now.\n\nWilliams gives a solid, charismatic performance, but he doesn’t fill in what the script is missing. Pryor ends up stealing the show, doing pretty well in his dramatic moments (he would indeed prove to be a solid dramatic actor when he had the opportunity) and pulling off some funny ribald riffs, which I have to assume were improvised. Welles is decent, Melton and Brandt provide a layer of endearing Jewish personality, and Kemmerling is enjoyably competent, even as he’s frustrated by the lack of good hamburgers in France (reputedly an inspirational for the “Royale with cheese” exchange in Pulp Fiction). The acting keeps the film more or less afloat.\n\nAnd from a technical standpoint it’s fine, with John A. Alonzo’s cinematography and Lalo Schifrin’s score adding some pizzazz; however, the soundtrack tends to be mixed too low or is too full of background noise, because I found a lot of the dialogue hard to understand, a problem compounded by the DVD’s lack of subtitles. Not that the dialogue is so incredible, but it did make some plot points hard to grasp without rewinding. Given the film’s considerable running time (135 minutes), watching it requires a bit of a time investment.\n\nWhether or not you want to make that investment may depend on your fondness for the cast or the genre; it’s decently exciting and moderately engaging, but there’s not much to make it truly memorable. And when you factor in the hilariously brazen product placement for McDonald’s, you’ve got a film which feels all too much like a product of The Man. Compared to the great Detroit 9000 from the same year, a film that’s thoughtful and dynamic, this one feels too shallow and generic. But it’s not bad for what it is—just not that good.\n\nScore: 67\n\nBirch Interval (1976) – *** [40]\n\nIn 1947, young Jesse (Susan McClung) is sent to live with her mother’s family in the town of Birch Interval, Pennsylvania, in or near the Amish country (though her family isn’t Amish). She has idealized memories of Birch Interval and her family from past visits, but the more complicated reality gradually makes itself felt, especially when her non-conformist uncle Thomas (Rip Torn) goes off on his own, deepening the rift between him and his wife Marie (Ann Wedgeworth), while putting pressure on Pa Strawacher (Eddie Albert), especially when the locals start signing a petition to have Thomas committed.\n\nAs with most such coming-of-age stories, there are lessons to be learned, and here Jesse learns that the adults around her are human and fallible, that good intentions don’t always produce good results, that values can be expressed in different ways—that there is more than one way to help someone. And also that it is very hard—nearly impossible—to help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.\n\nWhen the film stays focused on the family, it mostly works, but it tries to fit in a bit too much of the rest of the community. There are several subplots that aren’t fully developed, most prominently the tensions over the school board’s efforts to force the Amish community to send their children to public school; in one scene, Pa defends the rights of the Amish to the local authorities. But it’s dropped partway through, as is Jesse’s crush on Amish farm boy Josh (Doug Fishel Jr.). Likewise, there’s a plot thread about Jesse’s cousin Samuel (Brian Part) befriending a local practitioner of folk magic (Anne Revere in her final role), whose house later burns down. She insists on looking after herself rather than staying with neighbors…and that’s the last we see of her.\n\nThere’s also a scene where Jesse is waylaid by several local boys who tie her to a tree and attempt to molest her, and a Boo Radley-ish local girl (Robin Strosnider) who sets her free. The assault is quickly forgotten about and the girl never reappears. The film simply bites off more than it can chew, and given that Joanna Crawford, who wrote the source novel, also wrote the script, it’s possible she was trying to get in as much of her book as possible. (I found a copy of the book online with a laudatory quote on the cover from Harper Lee, deepening the Mockingbird connection).\n\nAt other times, however, the film makes effective use of ambiguity, as in the question of whether Thomas is truly mentally ill, or just how close Marie and local lawman Charlie (William Lucking) are. And in keeping with the theme of Jesse’s realizing the full scope of the adults’ humanity, there are intriguing shades to the characters; while we’re meant to sympathize with Thomas, he’s also clearly not an easy man to live or be married to, and we can sympathize with Marie’s frustrations as well. We can understand how Pa wants to do the right thing, but also struggles with the pressures of society. And we can see how Samuel has inherited some of Thomas’ defiant nature.\n\nSo for the target audience (10-14, I’d think), there’s definitely some good points for discussion and reflection. But how does the film work for adult audiences?\n\nFairly well, if not seamlessly. One can certainly appreciate the acting; McClung is pretty solid, especially in the scene where Jesse attempts to confront Charlie, and Albert is properly grandfatherly while also showing Pa’s struggles with his conscience. But it’s Torn who gives the most impressive performance; he played plenty of notable character parts in big films, but it was in smaller films like this, Payday, and Heartland where he really got to show off his talents. A man with ample demons of his own, Torn was ideally cast as a man who just doesn’t fit in to society, who can’t give his family the attention they deserve, who feels the need to go off on his own for a couple of months to get his head straight, whatever distress it causes his them. Torn doesn’t soften Thomas’ edges, but plays him with the right sense of humanity to allow us to understand him—at least as much as he wants to be understood.\n\nThe film is also fairly well made; Urs Furrer’s cinematography makes pleasant use of the setting and seasons (the poster is inaccurate, as the film covers more than just the summer), and Leonard Rosenman’s score is effectively Coplandesque. Delbert Mann’s direction is fairly unremarkable, but he was a never a great director (he may have won an Oscar for Marty, but the direction wasn’t that great; it was all about the writing and the main performances). Really, the guiding behind the film was producer Robert B. Radnitz, who produced a number of family films in the 60s and 70s. His masterpiece was 1972’s lovely Sounder (which got a Best Picture nomination), but Birch Interval is a solid chapter in his now largely forgotten career.\n\nScore: 74\n\nThe Loon’s Necklace (1949) – ***½ [26]\n\nWhen the Canadian Film Awards began in 1949, the pickings for Canadian films to award were so slim that they gave Film of the Year to this 10-minute short, which I can only assume haunts the memories of many Canadians who saw it in their youths; its folkloric story and brevity make it ideal for enriching young viewers, and the vivid, often surreal imagery makes it ideal for terrifying them.\n\nBased on a legend of the Tsimshian people, set in what is now British Columbia, the story tells of an aged medicine man, Kelora, who has gone blind and spends most of his time sitting in the sun, listening for the cry of his father, the loon. Although he is widely derided by his wife and neighbors, he defends his village from wolves one difficult winter by use of a dentalium necklace and a magic bow and arrow. Later, he sets out, as he has done before, to the find the loon; he does so, and asks for his sight to be restored.\n\nThe loon has Kelora ride on his back as he swims across a lake, plunging under the waters multiple times until the blindness is washed away. A grateful Kelora tosses his necklace to the loon, and a few shells scatter across his back, resulting in the white neckband and white spots the loon now bears.\n\nAlthough the film reputedly takes a few liberties with the original legend—though as with most such stories there is no one true version but many variants—the real appeal is in the use of authentic native masks; we are told that they are quite old, but that “their colors have not been retouched.” The evidence suggests no retouching was necessary.\n\nLike the use of masks in the 1957 film of Oedipus Rex, the use of masks here enhances the mythic nature of the material. But here, director F.R. Crawley (a rather legendary figure in the history of Canadian cinema) adds a fair amount of cinematic flair on top of that, with the masks representing wolves and spirits surging at the camera in a way which could hardly have failed to sear itself into the memories of Canadian children. And the masks themselves are simply beautiful to look at, reflecting the imagination and craftsmanship of the original artists. The stylized painted backdrops are quietly effective.\n\nCrawley’s direction isn’t seamless, as the actual direction of the masked figures is a touch clumsy (the film seems to have been shot on a very cramped stage), and the use of occasional mutterings and moans on top of the narration and other sound effects (wolf howls, bird calls, etc.) is more distracting than anything. And there’s the whole question of authenticity in the use of the masks and the adaptation of the legend, but I can’t speak with any authority on that.\n\nThe Loon’s Necklace isn’t one of the great shorts, but it’s a good one, a good film for young viewers and a solid one for anyone interested in folklore or indigenous Canadian art. Canadian cinema is its own fascinating thing, and I intend to check out more of it. This is a good place to start. (If only I could get ahold of Crawley’s Amanita Pestilens…)\n\nScore: 77\n\nMan on a Swing (1974) – *** [387]\n\nFrank Perry had a very odd career, making his feature debut with 1962’s David and Lisa, one of the earliest truly independent films to break into the Oscar race, earning him a nomination for Best Director (well, he got it, I wouldn’t necessarily say he earned it). But he wouldn’t really try to break into mainstream filmmaking for some time, first with 1968’s The Swimmer (a strange, enigmatic film) and then with Last Summer and Diary of a Mad Housewife, which earned Oscar nods for acting in consecutive years, and then working fairly consistently until 1975’s Rancho Deluxe, after which he went six years between films, returning with none other than Mommie Dearest. He made four more films, the last a documentary on his battle with cancer, before his death in 1995.\n\nI’ve only seen a handful of his films (David and Lisa, The Swimmer, Mommie Dearest, and this one), but he seems to have had a predilection for stories about characters as much at odds with their own natures as their external opponents. Man on a Swing may not fit this mold perfectly, but in the simmering anger of Cliff Robertson’s driven, frustrated, alcoholic police chief, and in the violent trances Joel Grey’s self-professed clairvoyant throws himself into, you can see Perry’s pet themes at work.\n\nLee Tucker (Robertson) is the chief of police in a smallish town, investigating the murder of a popular young teacher who was found in the front seat of her own car; it’s later revealed she was killed play strangulation and her body placed in the car afterwards. Tucker becomes fixated on the investigation, which takes a toll on his personal life—he drinks more heavily and his relationship with his pregnant wife Janet (Dorothy Tristan) suffers. There are suspects—one of the victim’s exes, a local sex offender recently released from prison—but the case soon stalls.\n\nThen Tucker is contacted by Franklin Wills (Grey), a local factory worker who claims to be clairvoyant and wishes to help with the case. Tucker is skeptical, but Wills soon displays knowledge of the case that would suggest he really does have a gift…or he’s the murderer. The rest of the film focuses on Tucker’s tense relationship with Wills, his efforts to learn about parapsychology, and his growing frustration at not being able to solve the case. He eventually does…but things are hardly wrapped up neatly by the time the credits roll.\n\nMany reviews of Swing cite its ending as a major shortcoming, and I have to agree. An ambiguous ending for this kind of story, especially in the mid 70s, was inevitable, but the film goes for a far less compelling ambiguity than I was expecting; it’s less a statement on the elusiveness of the truth than a feeling of having missed the line of dialogue or visual detail that would have cleared everything up. And it’s hard to figure out just what to make of the final shot: in retrospect it feels almost like a sequel hook, but it was probably just meant to induce a sense of lingering unease. It’s not a catastrophic ending, but it really doesn’t feel like it worked the way they wanted it to.\n\nUp until then, the film is fairly effective, with palpable tension, solid direction from Perry, good cinematography by Adam Holender (there’s one shot, with a neon sign reflected in the windshield of Tucker’s car, that’s legitimately great), a creepy, low-key score by Lalo Schifrin, and good editing by Sidney Katz, blending flashbacks and the present quite gracefully in the early scenes and subtly suggesting the passage of many days later on. It’s the script, by David Zelag Goodman (based on the murder of Barbara Ann Butler and its investigation), that ultimately falls short, trying to blend the paranormal, a murder mystery, and a battle of Wills (pun reluctantly intended) between the two main characters, but ultimately not sticking the landing.\n\nThe two lead performances definitely help; Robertson is quite good at simultaneously suggesting a genial middle-American steadfastness and a brooding intensity, and if he doesn’t handle the more explosive scenes that well, that’s arguably more because of Goodman’s script than his acting. As for Grey, he’s quite good as well, but the role and the performance seem a bit too calculated at times to give him a showcase (and possibly earn him a second Oscar); his balletic trances and soft-spoken eccentricity are certainly intriguing, but it’s hard not to feel like we’re expected to find them intriguing. He definitely gives the role his all, even drooling while lying on the floor after one of his most intense trances, but he’s just a little too self-consciously showy for my taste.\n\nI may return to Man on a Swing someday; it has enough good elements and I’ve read enough praise of it (much of which compares it to Zodiac, which I still haven’t seen) to induce me to give it another chance. But for now, I think it’s an intriguing film which, in the final analysis, doesn’t rise above that."
