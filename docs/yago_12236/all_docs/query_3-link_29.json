        "text": "Ángel Manuel Soto, known for his work on Blue Beetle and Charm City Kings, is set to direct Universal Pictures’ upcoming film based on the popular video game franchise Just Cause.\n\nThe Just Cause movie will be produced under the expertise of Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, whose credits include high-octane action films like The Fall Guy, Bullet Train, Nobody, and Violent Night. They will produce through 87North, which holds a first-look deal with Universal. Additional production support comes from Story Kitchen’s Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson — the team behind the adaptations of Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog. Dan Jevons will serve as the executive producer, with Max Jacoby overseeing the production for 87North.\n\nThe Just Cause games explained\n\nDeveloped by Avalanche Studios and published initially by Eidos Interactive and later by Square Enix’s External Studios, the Just Cause video game series offers players expansive open-world action-adventure gameplay. Set across various island nations, the series includes four main games: Just Cause, Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3, and Just Cause 4. Each title immerses players in the role of overthrowing authoritarian regimes. By mid-2018, the Just Cause series had achieved significant commercial success, shipping over 15 million copies globally.\n\nIn the Just Cause series, players step into the shoes of Rico Rodriguez, a secret agent from the fictional country of Medici, which is the focal setting in the third installment. Rico’s skill set includes walking, swimming, jumping, and handling various weapons, enhancing the player’s ability to engage with the game’s world both on foot and via a range of vehicles. The series’ name, “Just Cause,” is a nod to the real-life U.S. military operation in Panama.\n\nÁngel Manuel Soto is currently directing The Wrecking Crew for MGM/Amazon, featuring stars Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista. Alongside his directing duties, Soto is co-writing a Transformers spin-off with Marco Ramirez, with plans to direct this project for Paramount. Previously, Soto directed Blue Beetle for Warner Bros. and DC, showcasing his ability to handle high-profile cinematic projects.\n\nStay tuned for the latest news regarding Ángel Manuel Soto’s Just Cause movie!"
