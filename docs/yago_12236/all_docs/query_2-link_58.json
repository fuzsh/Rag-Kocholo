        "text": "Congratulations! Why did you make your film?\n\nMy co-writer and I had both recently gone through breakups and we were very interested in the role memory plays in relationships of all kind. It's common knowledge that memory is subjective, but we don't discuss how malleable it can be. And yet we base so many decisions on what we remember and take them as facts. I wanted to explore the way one woman was coping with her memories of a relationship while the breakup is fresh and she is in that period of wondering what she could have done different and wishing she could go back and fix things. I love the idea of technology as a form of wish fulfillment and wanted to touch on the way in which something as fragile as memories can affect everything.\n\nImagine I’m a member of the audience. Why should I watch this film?\n\nWhenever you remember something, your recall is based on the last time you thought about it, which inevitably morphs at each recollection. Plentiful examples exist of people believing in incidents or events that never happened after seeing images or hearing stories. Just recently, DNA evidence exonerated a woman who still firmly believes she committed a crime she actually had no part in after years of being told that she was guilty and looking at the evidence. What if you could technologically harness this ability to create memories – it may very well happen in the near future. Even if the process fell under rules and regulations, there are always opportunists looking for unconventional ways to achieve their goals. If someone is at all interested in the role memory plays in our day-to-day lives, they will enjoy exploring its impact through this heightened and personal lens.\n\nHow do personal and universal themes work in your film?\n\nThis is an unusual love story about how far someone is willing to go to secure their ideal relationship. Katrina is a deeply emotional person who believes she is always right and knows what’s best for those in her life. Her attempt to right the course of her relationship with illegal memory implants falls into a grey area: the moral ambiguity of acting from a place of pain and hurt and in favor of love and destiny. While touching on the power memory exerts over our daily lives and how we put such weight in something so transient, it also opens up questions of power dynamics present in any relationship and flips many conventions on its head. In the media, we often see women at the whims of men in romantic partnerships, but here the woman is the one to act with total authority. It calls to attention to how women must often go to great lengths to achieve the goals society thinks they should possess and the stock others put in one’s romantic status when you are a woman in your late 20s and early 30s.\n\nHere, the audience witnesses a specific event in these characters’ lives, while also gaining an understanding of the greater context. Is there anyone who hasn’t wished they could rewrite the past and obtain a better outcome? Imagine a couple waking up and one party knows what has transpired, and how the drama will unfold with this new balance in place and with one party privy to an unfathomable secret. What is the aftermath of what might happen if you reimagine the past in order to change keep your significant other’s heart?\n\nHow have the script and film evolved over the course of their development?\n\nI was set on writing something in the black market of memory insertion technology before I landed on the idea of this script, and the framework of one woman trying to fix a relationship. The main struggle was adding in moments where she was able to remain somewhat sympathetic, and the script evolved to show that the protagonist was acting from a place of love and hurt.\n\nWhat type of feedback have you received so far?\n\nI have received varied feedback, based on the emotional response people have had watching the short. Some people are wildly uncomfortable by the conceit, others have discussed that they wished they could use the technology. Each response has sparked an interesting debate about the way our brains work and are constantly changing.\n\nHas the feedback surprised or challenged your point of view?\n\nAt times viewers have given their ideas and musings on where the story progresses after the short, what happens to the characters. I have heard suggestions and ideas that have completely surprised me, especially in thinking about the evolution from the short into a feature.\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve by having your film more visible on www.wearemovingstories.com?\n\nI am hoping to gain wider exposure for the film as well as for myself as a director. I hope that people watch the short and are inspired to have some of the conversations I've been a part of because of it. Also, I think there are many ways in which this short could evolve into something larger, and I would love to find someone to champion it in that way.\n\nUnforgettable\n\nHoping to fix a failed relationship a young woman kidnaps her ex-boyfriend and subjects him to technology that alters his memories in order to rebuild the foundation of their partnership and get their lives back on track.\n\nLength: 6:29\n\nDirector: Sabrina Jaglom\n\nProducer: Sabrina Jaglom, Ethan Webman, Rishi Rajani\n\nWriter: Sabrina Jaglom, Rishi Rajani\n\nAbout the writer, director and producer:\n\nSABRINA JAGLOM is a LA-based writer, director, and producer.
