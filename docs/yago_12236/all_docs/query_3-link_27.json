Favorites: Jurassic Park (1993), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Toy Story (1995), The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Bio: 2021 Spring Hill College graduate who enjoys to play games and watch movies. I have been a huge movie buff since around 2013 and I joined this website in May of 2016. My favorite types of films are action, sci-fi and animation, but I watch all kind of films. In fact, I did my senior seminar on a magazine reviewing films and television that were on streaming services. My criteria on rating a film is the quality of the film and how much I enjoyed it.  My scale from 1 to 10 and 1 to 50: 1 (1-5): Unwatchable. The worst of the worst. 2 (6-10): Painful. Either too boring or too inept. 3 (11-15): Terrible. A couple of redeeming qualities, but the film is not worth watching. 4 (16-20): Subpar. Watchable but unremarkable. 5 (21-25): Average. Movies that I feel are very middle of the road with. 6 (26-30): Decent. An enjoyable film, but nothing amazing. 7 (31-35): Good. Some flaws hold it back from reaching its full potential, but it is still worth watching. 8 (36-40): Great. An awesome film that overcomes its issues. 9 (41-45): Excellent. A terrific film with only one or two minor issues that I can recommend to anyone. 10 (46-50): Phenomenal. The best of the best. A link to my magazine: Stream-A-Zine",

He’s going to try to cause chaos.”\n\nCooper takes his ecstatic daughter Riley to a concert held by Lady Raven for making good grades. When they get there, Cooper notices the concert is heavy on security. He learns that the concert is a trap to catch a serial killer who is predicted to attend the concert. Cooper takes a lot of measures to find a potential…\n\n“There is nothing in the desert and no man needs nothing.”\n\nA group of scientists and astronauts board on the research vessel Prometheus to learn more about the beginning of human life. On the moon LV-233, they search for the potential creators of humanity: The Engineers, a humanoid alien race. When the crew arrives on the planet, they learn that the planet is full of hostile alien life and their discovery could put the human race at risk.\n\nI am…\n\nFollowing her mother’s death, Gretchen moves with her father and her stepmother and half-sister in a remote Bavarian Alpine town. There, they meet the jovial Herr Konig who oversees the hotel the family is helping build. He gives a job to Gretchen at the front desk of the hotel. The longer the family stays, the stranger situation gets for the teen as she sees her sister suffer a mysterious seizure and gets attacked by a hooded woman while bike-riding home.…\n\n“Look, we know the title of this thing so I know what you're wondering: how are we gonna do this without dishonoring Logan's memory? Well, I'll tell you how. We're not.”\n\nWell, at least he’s honest.\n\nSix years after Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has a quieter life as a car salesman, but he is not that happy. His birthday is crashed by the Time Variance Authority who offer to bring him into a world where he will be recognized, but…\n\nAfter having to wait for weeks for this film to play near me, I have finally gotten a chance to go out and see Damien Chazelle's La La Land. And after seeing it, I can honestly say that it was absolutely worth the wait because this film is phenomenal in just about every way. The story is engaging, the script and writing is brilliant, the characters are lovable, the soundtrack is masterful, the performances are terrific and Ryan Gosling and…\n\nAs far as the DC cinematic universe goes, it is a very mixed bag for me. I don't think the films are complete and utter failures like many people do, but they have been very disappointing to me. I like Man of Steel, I don't like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and I consider Suicide Squad to be a guilty pleasure of mine, but I don't think it is a very good movie. After the last two misfires, I…"
