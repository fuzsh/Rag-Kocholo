        "text": "Submarine has landed worldwide distribution rights to the documentary feature Pretty Ugly: The Story of the Lunachicks with Concord Originals on board to finance and produce, it was announced today by Josh Braun and Dan Braun, co-founders of Submarine, and Sophia Dilley, SVP Concord Originals. Chronicling the Lunachicks, the seminal, feminist NYC punk band, the rollicking music documentary will have its world premiere at DOC NYC on November 10. The film is directed and produced by Brooklyn-based filmmaker Ilya Chaiken, whose directing credits include the Sundance and TIFF title Margarita Happy Hour and Liberty Kid, which was theatrically distributed by Kino Lorber and now streaming on Max.\n\nPretty Ugly: The Story of the Lunachicks is executive produced by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, who directed and produced the Academy Award-nominated RBG and Amazon’s Peabody Award-winning film My Name is Pauli Murray; and Concord Originals’ Sophia Dilley, Charles Hopkins and Bob Valentine; with Concord Originals’ Wesley Adams and Quíle Gomez serving as associate producers. Concord Originals is financing the film.\n\nSubmarine is co-repping worldwide rights with CAA Media Finance and will introduce the music documentary ahead of its world premiere later this week at DOC NYC.\n\n“We thought we knew a lot of bad-ass feminists, but when Ilya introduced us to the Lunachicks, we were blown away. Come to think of it, the word bad-ass might have been invented to describe the Lunachicks, as well as the director of this riotous, illuminating, inspiring documentary,” said Julie Cohen and Betsy West.\n\n“I’ve been a devoted Lunachicks fangirl since I lucked into their very first show in 1988 when we were all teenagers. In making Pretty Ugly, I wanted not only to revive the Lunachicks experience, but to tap into their saga of enduring friendship, survival, and triumph – a universal story that I believe will resonate with audiences of all generations,” noted director Ilya Chaiken.\n\n“We fell in love with this fantastic story about the trailblazing Lunachicks, who were not afraid to speak their minds! Ilya has captured the humor, energy and grit of the 80s and 90s punk scene as we follow the queens of punk rock on their journey full of high-octane performances and triumphant moments as the band navigates personal and professional obstacles – it’s an entertaining ride that will make you, if you aren’t already, a punk rock fan,” said Sophia Dilley, SVP Concord Originals.\n\n“We are unbelievably excited to be working on this amazing film about an amazing incendiary band with the dream team of Ilya Chaiken, Betsy West and Julie Cohen. Pretty Ugly: The Story of the Lunachicks is quite simply a music doc that rocks hard in every way and we can’t wait for the world to see it,” added Submarine’s Dan Braun.\n\nPretty Ugly: The Story of the Lunachicks follows the Lunachicks, the influential punk band renowned for their unabashed humor and unwavering pro-women ethos. The band made their mark on NYC’s underground music scene in the ‘90s with songs like “Fallopian Rhapsody” and “Bitterness Barbie,” and performed with No Doubt, Green Day, The Offspring, The Go-Go’s, NOFX, Rancid, The Ramones, Rev Horton Heat, Warped Tour (main stage), L7, The Buzzcocks and Joan Jett. Facing casual sexism and outright misogyny at every turn, the Lunachicks never took their rightful place in the punk pantheon but they’ve maintained a rabid fanbase. A rollercoaster of drugs, romantic entanglements and creative conflicts led to their breakup decades ago – now, can they reunite for one last show?\n\nThe deal was brokered by David Markman from DLA Piper LLP (on behalf of Concord Originals).\n\n# # #\n\nABOUT SUBMARINE\n\nSubmarine is a hybrid sales, production and distribution company run by twin brothers and co-founders Dan Braun and Josh Braun.
