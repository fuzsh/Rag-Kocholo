        "text": "There is no fee to apply. Your organization should submit their request to us using MyTax Illinois or at the address located at the end of this section. If eligible, IDOR will issue your organization a sales tax exemption number (e-number). The sales tax exemption may take up to 90 days to process and it is not retroactive. Your organization must give this number to a merchant to make purchases tax-free.\n\nProperties of religious, charitable, and educational organizations, as well as units of federal, state and local governments, are eligible for exemption from property taxes to the extent provided by law. The organization must apply for the exemption with the County Board of Review which reviews the application and forwards it to the Illinois Department of Revenue for the final administrative decision. For information contact the County Board of Review.\n\nWho qualifies for a property tax exemption?\n\nYour organization must\n\nbe an exclusively beneficent and charitable, religious, educational, or governmental organization, and\n\nown the property that is used exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, or governmental purposes and not leased or used for profit,\n\nto qualify for a property tax exemption.\n\nWho doesn't qualify for a property tax exemption?\n\nSome organizations do charitable work but aren't primarily organized and operated for charitable purposes. Therefore, they don't qualify for this exemption. These include civic and fraternal organizations, such as\n\nAmerican Legions,\n\nAmVets,\n\nChambers of Commerce,\n\nElks Clubs,\n\nLions Clubs,\n\nRotary Clubs,\n\nVeterans of Foreign Wars, and\n\nUnions and trade associations.\n\nHow does an organization apply for a property tax exemption?\n\nTo apply, your organization should complete one of the following three applications, available from the chief county assessment officer (CCAO).\n\nCharitable organizations should complete Form PTAX-300, Application for Non-homestead Property Tax Exemption. You must include copies of\n\nProof of ownership, (deed, contract for deed, title insurance policy, condemnation order and proof of payment, etc.)\n\nA picture of the property,\n\nAny leases or contracts on the property, and\n\nA notarized affidavit of use of the property.\n\nEducational and governmental organizations, other than federal and state agencies, should also complete Form PTAX-300. The required attachments are listed on that form.\n\nFederal and state agencies should complete Form PTAX-300-FS, Application for Federal/State Agency Property Tax Exemption. The required attachments are listed on that form.\n\nReligious organizations should complete Form PTAX-300-R, Application for Religious Property Tax Exemption. The required attachments are listed on that form.\n\nOnce you've completed the application, submit it, along with all required documents, to the county board of review. The board will hold a hearing and evaluate all the information submitted before making a recommendation.\n\nAll the documents are then forwarded to IDOR for a final determination. This decision is final unless a formal hearing is requested by the applicant or another party to the matter.\n\nDo you need additional property tax exemption information?\n\nContact us by\n\nPhone: 217 785-2252\n\nMail :\n\nILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES 3-520\n\n101 WEST JEFFERSON STREET\n\nSPRINGFIELD IL 62702"
