We allow each student to assert individualized knowledge that contributes to a collective understanding” (Takacs, 2003, p.28 ).”\n\nPositionality refers to where one is located in relation to their various social identities (gender, race, class, ethnicity, ability, geographical location etc.); the combination of these identities and their intersections shape how we understand and engage with the world, including our knowledges, perspectives, and teaching practices. As individuals and as instructors, we occupy multiple identities that are fluid and dialogical in nature, contextually situated, and continuously amended and reproduced (Alcoff, 1988 ).\n\nTake a moment to think about how your positionality influences all aspects of your course design, delivery, and assessment, including:\n\nWhat is taught (content);\n\nHow it is taught (practices and activities);\n\nWhat is evaluated and how (assignments, etc.).\n\nWe invite you to purposefully share some of these reflections with your students to model reflexivity and intentionality and help foster a diverse and inclusive learning community that signals to students that they all belong, have value, and offer unique perspectives.\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nOne way to think about your positionality is in relationship to the land and to the Indigenous stewards of these lands. We encourage you to resist token gestures by writing a personal and meaningful land acknowledgement that you can include in your syllabus, share in the beginning of class, and engage with at different times during the semester. You can even co-write a land acknowledgment with your students for the course, situating yourselves and the university in relation to the land, settler-colonialism, and Indigenous futurities.\n\nAccording to Native Land Digital, while a brief acknowledgement may work for some groups, others wish to add more intention and detail to acknowledgements. To thoughtfully prepare an in-depth acknowledgement requires time and care. You may find it helpful to reflect on and research questions such as:\n\nWhy am I sharing this acknowledgement? Why am I choosing this medium/context to do this?\n\nHow does this acknowledgement relate to the event or work I am doing?\n\nWhat is the history of this territory? What are the impacts of colonialism here?\n\nWhat is my relationship to this territory? How did I come to be here? How did I or my ancestors come to be here? Have my ancestors always been here? What does this mean to me? How do I remain accountable?\n\nWhat are your ethical and political commitments and obligations to this land and Indigenous Peoples?\n\nWhat intentions do you have to disrupt and dismantle colonialism beyond this territory acknowledgement?\n\nPositionality Statement (syllabus):\n\nDiscussing your positionality with your students can be a great way to model reflexivity, especially as it relates to your teaching philosophy, research, and scholarship. Further, as argued by Harrington (2020) “reflecting on your positionality as an instructor can be a powerful strategy for student success, especially if you think about how your lived experiences shape what you do in the classroom and how those actions may or may not be supporting the success of students in your class who often have very different lived experiences.” Your positionality statement can be shared on your syllabus, on OnQ, or verbally during the first day of class. For those of us struggling to find icebreakers, this can be a great way to connect on a deeper level with your students. Here are some prompts that can help guide your statement:\n\nWhat social identities—race, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, religion, ability and so on—do I identify with and how significant is each identity to how I teach?\n\nWhat type of training and experiences do I have? How have they shaped who I am professionally, and how might they impact how students relate to me and my teaching style?\n\nWhere do I know from? How was my discipline developed? What role did my discipline play in reifying dominant ideologies or worldviews? What role do I play in this work? In what ways do I challenge or divest from some of these practices? Why or why not?\n\nWhat elements of my identity, experiences, and worldviews shape my:\n\nTeaching philosophy, course design, teaching practices, and content\n\nResearch\n\nScholarship\n\nInside Higher Ed Article: Reflect on Your Positionality to Ensure Student Success\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n\nTeaching philosophy statements are living documents that grow, change, and evolve alongside your teaching practices and experiences. They are integral parts of teaching dossiers used for hiring, as well as tenure and promotion. They can also be shared in syllabi to invite students to know you and your teaching methods better. The primary goal of a teaching philosophy statement is for the reader to understand the intentional choices you make in your pedagogy.\n\nCore components of your own positionality, where you know from, and where you are situated in relation to other knowledges, and in relation to your discipline should be reflected in your teaching philosophy. Some considerations can include:\n\nDescribing your teaching values and beliefs\n\nExplaining what you hope to achieve in your teaching\n\nDescribing your teaching context, including the elements of your discipline that are most salient to your teaching approach.\n\nDefining what good teaching is to you, and why you have developed or adopted this style in your own practice.\n\nIncluding statements about:\n\nWhat your teaching ‘looks’ like; why you do it that way; how well it works\n\nValues that inform your teaching and how those values manifest themselves in the classroom\n\nTeaching and assessment methods used and their purpose\n\nYour own perceptions of your teaching strengths, limitations, and plans for ongoing professional development\n\nFor more information on teaching dossiers:\n\nTeaching Dossier: Queen's University, Centre for Teaching and Learning\n\nCreating a Teaching Dossier: Waterloo University, Centre for Teaching Excellence\n\nUsing the Positionality Exercise with your Students\n\nUsing the positionality exercise with your students can be a great way for them to reflect on their social locations and consider how they impact what they know and how they know in ways that would otherwise go unnoticed. This exercise can also be used to show how identities, social locations, and/or how one understands oneself can shift across time and space.\n\nStudents can create:\n\nMindmaps or social identity timelines of their lives, highlighting what age they may have come to learn about one (or more) aspect of their identity, or when they may have been socially confronted about how they may or may not be perceived (i.e. gender, race, ability, class etc.).\n\nEntry or exit tickets: a reflection at the beginning and/or end of class, encouraging students to consider how social locations impact their knowledge, experiences, etc.\n\nPlease note that these exercises should not be graded as they comprise one’s journey of self-exploration. Alternatively, Educational Developers at the Centre for Teaching and Learning can help you create rubrics for you to assess your students’ process, or for your students to self-assess their own process in fulfilling this assignment.\n\nMapping Social Identity Timeline\n\nReferences:\n\nAlcoff, Linda.
