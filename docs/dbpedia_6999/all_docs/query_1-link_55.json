They may have problems with schoolwork, communication or behaviour. Parents can get help and advice from specialists, teachers and voluntary organisations.\n\nWhat 'special educational needs' means\n\n'Special educational needs' is a legal definition and refers to children with learning problems or disabilities that make it harder for them to learn than most children the same age.\n\nHow schools can help children with special educational needs\n\nA school can usually provide help and sometimes uses specialists. If your child has special educational needs, they may need extra help:\n\nwith schoolwork\n\nreading, writing, number work or understanding information\n\nexpressing themselves or understanding what others are saying\n\nmaking friends or interacting with adults\n\nbehaving properly in school\n\norganising themselves\n\nThey might have sensory or physical needs that affect them in school.\n\nYour child's progress\n\nChildren progress at different rates and have different ways in which they learn best. When planning lessons, your child's teacher will take account of this by looking carefully at how they organise their lessons, classroom, books and materials.\n\nThe teacher will choose suitable ways to help your child learn. If your child is making slower progress or having particular problems in one area, they may be given extra help or different lessons to help.\n\nJust because your child is making slower progress than you expected or the teachers are providing different support, help or activities in class, this doesn't necessarily mean that your child has special educational needs.\n\nGetting help for your child\n\nYour child's early years are a very important time for their physical, emotional, intellectual and social development. When the health visitor or doctor makes a routine check, they might suggest that there could be a problem. If you have any worries of your own, you should ask for advice right away.\n\nYou should ask your child's class teacher, the person in the school responsible for helping children with special educational needs or the headteacher.\n\nYou could ask them if:\n\nthe school thinks your child is having problems\n\nyour child is able to work at the same level as others of the same age\n\nyour child is already getting extra help\n\nyou can help your child\n\nIf the school agrees your child has special needs in some areas, they'll use a step-by-step approach to meeting these.\n\nSpecial educational needs: a step-by-step approach\n\nIdentifying special educational needs in under fives\n\nGetting help for children under five with special educational needs\n\nTalking to your child's school\n\nThere are some basic principles that everyone involved in your child's education at school will consider:\n\nif your child has special needs, these should be met and they should receive a broad, well-balanced and relevant education\n\nyour views should always be taken into account and the wishes of your child should be listened to\n\nyour child's needs will usually be met in a mainstream school, sometimes with the help of outside specialists\n\nyou should be consulted on all the decisions that affect your child\n\nyou have a vital role to play in your child's education\n\nSpecial educational needs - A guide for parents\n\nMore useful links\n\nBenefits and financial support\n\nCaring for a child with disabilities"
