        "text": "When learning to drive we are taught to not just check our mirrors, but to also turn and check our blind spot before changing lanes. We do this so we can be sure that things are actually as they appear in our mirror, that we haven’t overlooked or missed something before we make a change. Of course, there are people who fail to do this from time to time and the run the risk of hurting themselves and the people they overlooked who were driving beside them. Applying this analogy to the field of Student Affairs, our institutions are the cars, we are the drivers, and unfortunately, our marginalized and oppressed students are often positioned in our blind spot. Despite our best intentions, we may check our mirrors and think we have made a good decision to change lanes, but we forget that mirrors only reflect our perspective. Sometimes we need to actually turn our heads and double check.\n\nI recently presented at an inclusion and equity summit on a topic I have been mulling over for over five years now. My presentation, The Customer is Always White: How the Customer Service Model Overlooks Inclusive Equity in Favor of Financial Equity focused on the gaps in the use of the customer service philosophy in Student Affairs. Higher education has slowly begun to merge into the customer service lane. There is no deficit in opinion pieces citing a response to millennial desires or competitiveness between institutions. However, having spent most of my professional career in housing and residence life, I began to notice a pattern, even across multiple institutions, in the demographic of those who were able to fully utilize customer service. Moreover, I noticed that certain students, those who were white, middle/ upper class, 2nd or 3rd generation; were more likely to utilize loopholes that using a business philosophy, such as customer service, in education inevitably creates.\n\nOne section of data missing from the articles and opinion pieces on the merits of using a customer service philosophy in higher education is who exactly our customers are or if our practices are equitable. Initially, I did look to see if there was anything addressing the trend I was seeing, but was unable to find anything substantial. Therefore, I pulled from business, sociology, psychology, and student affairs to support my theory: that the customer service model is not accessible to low income, first generation, or students of color due to a cultural mismatch.\n\nWithout getting too deep into theory and research, what I am theorizing is best explained in an example that may seem familiar to many other student affairs professionals:\n\nTwo students: Student A is a white, middle class, third generation, freshman. Student B is a Latino son of migrate workers, first generation, freshman. They both receive a bill from the university they believe is incorrect, both appeal and both are denied.\n\nNow, this is the place where identity and privilege affect the outcome.\n\nStudent A’s father calls the director of the department, requests a refund, and despite missteps by student A that created the charge, they are granted a refund.\n\nMost of us in student affairs have seen this happen before. This is an example of what articles condemning the customer service philosophy are referring to; giving a student what they want simply because they demand it. On the surface, this does not seem like a discriminatory practice, more like an unethical one. However, I argue that exclusion is not simply closing doors, but hiding them so others do not know they exist. That is how we fail student B.\n\nStudent B cannot afford the charge, does not pay, and his account is delinquent.\n\nThis fine, depending on the policy at the university, could keep Student B from returning the following year or even obtaining transcripts to transfer. Student B’s education has been halted at all points. The question may remain why student B didn't follow Student A’s steps to have the charge removed. There are several possible reasons I cover in the presentation, but one reason we don't consider is a culture mismatch. The greatest barrier is student B isn’t even aware something as easy as a parent phone call or call to the president is all it would take to resolve this. He is operating in a culture very different from his own. A culture based on white, middle class, college educated norms. The loopholes in higher education’s customer service are cultural capital. They are passed on from parents who attended college, know the system, and know the power of their own influence. This applies to many other parts of student success as well: knowing you can appeal a grade, request accommodations in class or in the residence halls, even knowing the difference between a W or an F. We could say things in the mirror are closer than they appear and take a positive spin on this. We could say that because our marginalized students are playing by the rules, often against other students who are not, and are still successful that they should be celebrated. However, in reality, we lose many students from our most marginalized populations along the way, sometimes over something as small as a $50 charge.\n\nOur first generation, low income, and students of color come into the university system facing many disadvantages most universities predict and attempt to address. We create bridge programs, peer mentor groups, and encourage participation in multicultural student groups. However, there are barriers embedded into many of our systems and practices that sit in the same blind spot as our disenfranchised students, they are invisible to us. The route becomes so familiar, even to those of us who identify as part of a disadvantaged group, that we do not think about the turns and shortcuts. Because of our viewpoint, as the driver who has been down this road often many times before, both the route and the destination seem obvious. As student affairs professionals and change agents, it is our responsibility to pay attention and recognize roadblocks that even our students don’t see. This means we have to stop to ask why we take the path we do, sometimes take a new route, and make sure to turn our heads to check our blind spot."
