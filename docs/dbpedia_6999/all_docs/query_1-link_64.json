        "text": "The best way to fight invasive species is to prevent them from occurring in the first place.\n\nYou can help stop the introduction and spread of invasive species. Help protect native plants and animals by following these six easy guidelines:\n\nVerify that the plants you are buying for your yard or garden are not invasive. Replace invasive plants in your garden with non-invasive alternatives. Ask your local nursery staff for help in identifying invasive plants!\n\nWhen boating, clean your boat thoroughly before transporting it to a different body of water.\n\nClean your boots before you hike in a new area to get rid of hitchhiking weed seeds and pathogens.\n\nDon’t “pack a pest” when traveling. Fruits and vegetables, plants, insects and animals can carry pests or become invasive themselves. Don't move firewood (it can harbor forest pests), clean your bags and boots after each hike, and throw out food before you travel from place to place.\n\nDon’t release aquarium fish and plants, live bait or other exotic animals into the wild. If you plan to own an exotic pet, do your research and plan ahead to make sure you can commit to looking after it.\n\nVolunteer at your local park, refuge or other wildlife area to help remove invasive species. Help educate others about the threat. You can even volunteer with The Nature Conservancy."
