        "text": "Body: Who Dances? The Dancer!\n\nImagine a body moving with rhythmic purpose and motions, usually performing to music. That’s dance. Sounds simple, right? Dance critic Walter Terry put it best this way:\n\n“No paints nor brushes, marbles nor chisels, pianos or violins are needed to make this art, for we are the stuff that dance is made of. It is born in our body, exists in our body and dies in our body. Dance, then, is the most personal of all the arts . . . it springs from the very breath of life.”\n\nThe human body is what others see when they look at dance. Sometimes the body is still; other times, it may be in motion. A dancer can use the whole body, or emphasize individual body parts, when moving.\n\nWhen you watch dance, try to notice the position of the body. Is it symmetrical, with the right and left sides doing the same thing, or not? What shape is the body making? Are the shapes sharp and angular, or soft and rounded? Is the body curved, twisted, or straight?\n\nJust as some colors in a painting may be more vibrant than others, you may notice dancers who have exceptional body control. They have worked hard to train their bodies (essentially their instrument of expression) to achieve superior balance, strength, and agility. Pay extra attention to how dancers use their breath when working through a dance phrase, or series of movements.\n\nDancers use their bodies to take internal ideas, emotions, and intentions and express them in an outward manner, sharing them with others. Dance can communicate this internal world, or it can be abstract, focusing on shapes and patterns.\n\nIn this excerpt from George Balanchine’s Apollo, you can see how the dancers use individual body parts to create a beautiful effect in space. The three ballerinas touch their toes to the male dancer’s hand, and then link their arms through his.\n\nAction: The Dancer Does What? Moves!\n\nAction is any human movement involved in the act of dancing. What do dancers do? They move—this is the action they perform. Movement can be divided into two general categories:\n\nNon-locomotor or axial movement: Any movement that occurs in one spot including a bend, stretch, swing, rise, fall, shake, turn, rock, tip, suspend, and twist.\n\nLocomotor movement: Any movement that travels through space including a run, jump, walk, slide, hop, skip, somersault, leap, crawl, gallop, and roll.\n\nAction includes small movements like facial expressions or gestures, as well as larger movements like lifts, carries, or catches done with a partner or in a group. “Action” is also considered the movement executed as the pauses or stillness between movements.\n\nDancers work together with a choreographer to practice and refine the action of the dance. When the action has been “set,” or finalized, the dancers must memorize their movement sequences in order to be able to perform them.\n\nWatch the Mark Morris Dance Company perform L’Allegro il Penseroso ed il Moderato. The action of the dance includes slaps and claps, falls, prances, jumps in place, as well as turns from side to side.\n\nSpace: Where Does the Dancer Move? Through Space!\n\nWe’re not talking about the final frontier here! We’re talking about where the action of dance takes place. Dance moves through space in an endless variety of ways.\n\nTo better explain, here are some ways a choreographer or dancer thinks about space:\n\nLevel: Is the movement on the floor or reaching upward? Are they performed high, medium, or low?\n\nDirection: Does the movement go forward, backward, sideways, right, left, or on a diagonal?\n\nPlace: Is the movement done on the spot (personal space) or does it move through space (general space, downstage, upstage)?\n\nOrientation: Which way are the dancers facing?\n\nPathway: Is the path through space made by the dancers curved, straight, or zigzagged? Or is it random?\n\nSize: Does the movement take up a small, narrow space, or a big, wide space?\n\nRelationships: How are the dancers positioned in space in relationship to one another? Are they close together or far apart? Are they in front of, beside, behind, over, under, alone, or connected to one another?\n\nThe list above helps us understand how to think about movement through space. Imagine how many ways you could perform a simple movement, like clapping your hands if you ran it through the different concepts listed above. Remember, space can be both indoors and outdoors, and some dances are created with specific spaces in mind.\n\nThe action in Paul Taylor’s dance Esplanade is very simple, consisting mostly of walking and running. Notice how the concept of space is explored in a variety of ways as the dancers constantly change direction and orientation. Their relationship to one another also keeps shifting. At times, they form two lines passing through one another. At other moments, they move in unison. Watch for both straight and curved pathways and think about how many ways the choreographer was able to manipulate the element of space.\n\nEnergy: How? The Dancer Moves Through Space and Time With Energy!\n\nSo now we have bodies moving through space and time. Isn’t that enough? Not quite. We need the fifth and last element of dance—energy.\n\nEnergy helps us to identify how the dancers move. What effort are they using? Perhaps their movements are sharp and strong, or maybe they are light and free. Energy also represents the quality of the movement—its power and richness. For choreographers and dancers, there are many possibilities.\n\nThe effort the dancers use can communicate meaning, depending on the energy involved. A touch between two dancers may be gentle and light, perhaps indicating concern or affection; or it may be sudden and forceful, indicating anger or playfulness. Energy is crucial in bringing the inner expression of emotion out to the stage performance.\n\nSome ways to think about energy are:\n\nAttack: Is the movement sharp and sudden, or smooth and sustained?\n\nWeight: Does the movement show heaviness, as if giving into gravity, or is it light with a tendency upward?\n\nFlow: Does the movement seem restricted and bound with a lot of muscle tension; or is it relaxed, free, and easy?\n\nQuality: Is the movement tight, flowing, loose, sharp, swinging, swaying, suspended, collapsed, or smooth?\n\nThe element of energy is important in this performance of dance team Kaba Modern. The dancers use a sharp, percussive attack, and have pauses between movements that break the flow. Kaba Modern, like other Hip Hop groups, has a sense of weight. They bend their knees and frequently move to the floor."
