        "text": "Environmental education is a process that allows individuals to explore environmental issues, engage in problem solving, and take action to improve the environment. As a result, individuals develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions.\n\nThe components of environmental education are:\n\nAwareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges\n\nKnowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges\n\nAttitudes of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality\n\nSkills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges\n\nParticipation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges\n\nEnvironmental education does not advocate a particular viewpoint or course of action. Rather, environmental education teaches individuals how to weigh various sides of an issue through critical thinking and it enhances their own problem-solving and decision-making skills.\n\nThe National Environmental Education Act of 1990 requires EPA to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy. EPA established the Office of Environmental Education to implement this program."
