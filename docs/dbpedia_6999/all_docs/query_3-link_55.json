        "text": "Social Constructivism\n\nCognitive Constructivism\n\nRadical Constructivism\n\nKnowledge is created through social interactions and collaboration with others. Knowledge is constructed through mental processes such as attention, perception, and memory. Knowledge is constructed by the individual through their subjective experiences and interactions with the world. The learner is an active participant in the construction of knowledge and learning is a social process. The learner is an active problem-solver who constructs knowledge through mental processes. The learner is the sole constructor of knowledge and meaning, and their reality is subjective and constantly evolving. The teacher facilitates learning by providing opportunities for social interaction and collaboration. The teacher provides information and resources for the learner to construct their own understanding. The teacher encourages the learner to question and reflect on their experiences to construct their own knowledge. Learning is a social process that involves collaboration, negotiation, and reflection. Learning is an individual process that involves mental processes such as attention, perception, and memory. Learning is an individual and subjective process that involves constructing meaning from one’s experiences. Reality is socially constructed and subjective, and there is no one objective truth. Reality is objective and exists independently of the learner, but the learner constructs their own understanding of it. Reality is subjective and constantly evolving, and there is no one objective truth. For example: Collaborative group work in a classroom setting. For example: Solving a math problem using mental processes. For example: Reflecting on personal experiences to construct meaning and understanding.\n\nConstructivism Teaching Philosophy\n\nConstructivist learning theory underpins a variety of student-centered teaching methods and techniques which contrast with traditional education, whereby knowledge is simply passively transmitted by teachers to students.\n\nWhat is the role of the teacher in a constructivist classroom?\n\nConstructivism is a way of teaching where instead of just telling students what to believe, teachers encourage them to think for themselves. This means that teachers need to believe that students are capable of thinking and coming up with their own ideas. Unfortunately, not all teachers believe this yet in America.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the teacher is to create a collaborative problem-solving environment where students become active participants in their own learning.\n\nFrom this perspective, a teacher acts as a facilitator of learning rather than an instructor.\n\nThe teacher makes sure he/she understands the students” preexisting conceptions, and guides the activity to address them and then build on them (Oliver, 2000).\n\nScaffolding is a key feature of effective teaching, where the adult continually adjusts the level of his or her help in response to the learner’s level of performance.\n\nIn the classroom, scaffolding can include modeling a skill, providing hints or cues, and adapting material or activity (Copple & Bredekamp, 2009).\n\nWhat are the features of a constructivist classroom?\n\nA constructivist classroom emphasizes active learning, collaboration, viewing a concept or problem from multiple perspectives, reflection, student-centeredness, and authentic assessment to promote meaningful learning and help students construct their own understanding of the world.\n\nTam (2000) lists the following four basic characteristics of constructivist learning environments, which must be considered when implementing constructivist teaching strategies:\n\n1) Knowledge will be shared between teachers and students.\n\n2) Teachers and students will share authority.\n\n3) The teacher’s role is one of a facilitator or guide.\n\n4) Learning groups will consist of small numbers of heterogeneous students.\n\nWhat are the pedagogical (i.e., teaching) goals of constructivist classrooms?\n\nTo provide experience with the knowledge construction process (students determine how they will learn).\n\nTo provide experience in and appreciation for multiple perspectives (evaluation of alternative solutions).\n\nTo embed learning in realistic contexts (authentic tasks).\n\nTo encourage ownership and a voice in the learning process (student-centered learning).\n\nTo embed learning in social experience (collaboration).\n\nTo encourage the use of multiple modes of representation, (video, audio text, etc.)\n\nTo encourage awareness of the knowledge construction process (reflection, metacognition).\n\nBrooks and Brooks (1993) list twelve descriptors of constructivist teaching behaviors:\n\nEncourage and accept student autonomy and initiative. (p. 103)\n\nUse raw data and primary sources, along with manipulative, interactive, and physical materials. (p. 104)\n\nWhen framing tasks, use cognitive terminology such as “classify,” analyze,” “predict,” and “create.” (p. 104)\n\nAllow student responses to drive lessons, shift instructional strategies, and alter content. (p. 105)\n\nInquire about students’ understandings of the concepts before sharing [your] own understandings of those concepts. (p. 107)\n\nEncourage students to engage in dialogue, both with the teacher and with one another. (p. 108)\n\nEncourage student inquiry by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions and encouraging students to ask questions of each other. (p. 110)\n\nSeek elaboration of students’ initial responses. (p. 111)\n\nEngage students in experiences that might engender contradictions to their initial hypotheses and then encourage discussion. (p. 112)\n\nAllow wait time after posing questions. (p. 114)\n\nProvide time for students to construct relationships and create metaphors. (p. 115)\n\nNurture students’ natural curiosity through frequent use of the learning cycle model. (p. 116)\n\nCritical Evaluation\n\nConstructivism promotes a sense of personal agency as students have ownership of their learning and assessment.\n\nThe biggest disadvantage is its lack of structure. Some students require highly structured learning environments to be able to reach their potential.\n\nIt also removes grading in the traditional way and instead places more value on students evaluating their own progress, which may lead to students falling behind, as without standardized grading teachers may not know which students are struggling.\n\nSummary Tables\n\nBehaviourism Constructivism Emphasizes the role of the environment and external factors in behavior Emphasizes the role of internal mental processes in learning and knowledge creation Knowledge is gained through external stimuli and observable behaviors Knowledge is actively constructed by the individual based on their experiences Teachers are the authority figures who impart knowledge to students Teachers are facilitators who guide students in constructing their own knowledge Students are passive receivers of knowledge and respond to rewards/punishments Students are active participants in constructing their own understanding and knowledge Observable behavior and measurable outcomes Internal mental processes, thinking, and reasoning Evaluation is based on observable behavior and measurable outcomes Evaluation is based on individual understanding and internal mental processes Classical and operant conditioning, behavior modification, reinforcement Problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, cognitive apprenticeship\n\nConstructivism Cognitivism Emphasizes the active role of learners in constructing their own understanding Emphasizes the role of internal mental processes in learning and the acquisition of knowledge Knowledge is actively constructed by the learner based on their experiences Knowledge is a product of internal mental processes and can be objectively measured and assessed Teachers are facilitators who guide learners in constructing their own knowledge Teachers are experts who provide knowledge to learners and guide them in developing their cognitive abilities Students are active participants in constructing their own understanding Students are receivers of knowledge from teachers and use their cognitive abilities to process information Active construction of knowledge based on experiences Internal mental processes and information processing Evaluation is based on individual understanding and internal mental processes Evaluation is based on objectively measurable outcomes and mastery of specific knowledge and skills Problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, cognitive apprenticeship Information processing theory, schema theory, metacognition\n\nFAQs\n\nReferences\n\nArends, R.
