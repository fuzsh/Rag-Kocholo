        "text": "A liberal arts education challenges you to consider not only how to solve problems but also trains you to ask which problems to solve and why, preparing you for positions of leadership and a life of service to the nation and all of humanity. We provide a liberal arts education to all of our undergraduates, including those who major in engineering.\n\nAs President Christopher Eisgruber, Class of 1983, stated in his 2013 installation address: “[A] liberal arts education is a vital foundation for both individual flourishing and the well-being of our society.”\n\nA commitment to the liberal arts is at the core of Princeton University's mission.\n\nThis means:\n\nPrinceton is a major research university with a profound and distinctive commitment to undergraduate education.\n\nOur curriculum encourages exploration across disciplines, while providing a central academic experience for all undergraduates.\n\nYou will have extraordinary opportunities at Princeton to study what you are passionate about and to discover new fields of interest.\n\nStudents who elect to major in the natural sciences or engineering, for example, also take classes in history, languages, philosophy, the arts and a variety of other subjects.\n\nYou could major in computer science and earn a certificate in theater. Or major in African American studies and earn a certificate in entrepreneurship. Many other options are possible through the range of Princeton's concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs.\n\nYou will be exposed to novel ideas inside and outside the classroom that may change your perspective and broaden your horizons.\n\nWe value learning and research as a source of personal discovery and fulfillment — as a pleasurable and enlightening experience in its own right. But it is also a means to an end, in preparing you to live a meaningful life in service to the common good.\n\nYour Princeton education will facilitate your progress along whatever path you choose to pursue, and you will continually rely on what you learned here in your career and in your life.\n\nOur graduates are prepared to address future innovations and challenges that we may not be able to even imagine today."
