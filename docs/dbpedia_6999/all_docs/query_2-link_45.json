        "text": "I'd also agree that its mostly behavior influence from early childhood through teenage years. You don't see too many 6 year olds feel the artist calling. But what you do see is a desire among those who were \"oppressed\" in some sort of way as a child look for an outlet with which they can express their emotions. On the same hand though you also have people who were encouraged to express their emotions through writing and art as children.\n\nFrom those simple examples I'd say that two \"naturally instinctual\" methods of feeling a strive for artistry are:\n\n1. Oppression. The fact that we can't have something makes us want it more for some reason, especially if we know we're being oppressed. If as a child you were not provided, or even denied, an outlet for creative expression, and you witness others with this privelige, you yearn that much more to do it. I feel this method goes hand in hand with complex emotions. Most people on a basic level need/want sympathy. When people make emotional art they generally wish to share it with others to get feedback/understanding that is basically sympathy.\n\n2. Encouragement. When you start something early as a child usually you develop a talent for it. People like to do things they're good at. With it comes praise and prestige for actions that require minimal work.\n\nI'm sure there's more, and I'm being overly general.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that I do not believe that people are intrinsically artistic. People I consider TRUE artists are those that don't just create something new, they create a NEW WAY of creating something new.\n\nSculpture, Paint/Drawing, Music, Writing, and Physical Expression (like a wordless play) seem to be the only methods anyone uses anymore. Its all just modifications of the same thing (which can be creative).\n\nBut find me someone who invented a new method of creating art, and he is the true artist.\n\nI think that the concept of entropy might be interesting for you to pursue.\n\nThere are no \"driving forces\" in the universe, there are forces, but it is energy that is behind the application of these forces. Whenever a useful form of energy is used to cause any sort of change, the amount of available \"useful\" energy in the universe becomes less.\n\nThe growing amount of \"energy unavailable for work\" (or \"useless energy\") is known as \"entropy\" (that is not exactly correct, but close enough for the layperson), and the fact that entropy is always increasing in the universe is what's known as \"The Second Law of Thermodynamics.\"\n\nThis law also stipulates that all systems will spontaneously move from a state of order to a state of chaos. But small localities ( for example, the Earth) can actually appear to move from a state of disorder to a state of higher order (for example, evolution of the species). This is possible due to a large input of energy from outside (the sun, specifically). But as the Earth increases in order, the sun (and universe) is increasing in entropy.\n\nMaking something out of nothing, making order out of chaos, is a human endeavor. It is like a fight against entropy. But in creating a local little pocket of order, somewhere (usually spread throughout the sky in the form of slightly warmer air) (no this is not global warming!) we have caused entropy to increase.\n\nChi Meson said:\n\nI think that the concept of entropy might be interesting for you to pursue.\n\nThere are no \"driving forces\" in the universe, there are forces, but it is energy that is behind the application of these forces.

With your urging I will pursue it further.\n\nI find it interesting that you were the only person who responded by pointing me in this direction. I have a strong background in psychology and philosophy, but I wasn't looking for human theories of why things work the way they do. I was looking for--and I apologize if I didn't ask the question correctly--a possible explanation of human behavior as a direct or indirect result of a physical law of the universe.\n\nIf there is one governing law of the universe that connects all things in it--and I believe that's true although I cannot tell you why, blame it on Jung's theory of the collective unconscious--then if gravity controls the direction that rivers flow, and plants grows in the direction of the sun's rays, wouldn't it follow that the behavior of human beings would also be controlled or at least heavily influenced by these same physical laws?\n\nPerhaps because man can provide sufficent opposing action to entropy he's driven to accomplish many things that seem illogical or impractical. Maybe the endeavors that make the least sense to most people are actually the most effective weapons against entropy while at the same time the least understandable, which is perhaps why the geniuses of any given age are so highly misunderstood, unappreciated, maligned, marginalized, and only after they are gone, recognized for their brilliance."
