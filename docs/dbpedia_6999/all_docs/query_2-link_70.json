        "text": "Welcome to the United States Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA). The SNCOA is the third level of Air Force enlisted professional military education. The Academy is the single in-resident school for Airmanship 800 (formerly known as the AF Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy) and Airmanship 900 (formerly known as the Chief Leadership Academy) located at Kisling Hall on Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, Alabama. Our facility is dedicated to our third Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, CMSgt Richard D. Kisling, who was the driving force and staunch advocate of enlisted professional military education.\n\nOver 25 Academic days, A800â€™s curricula is designed to prepare our Active Duty, Air Reserve Component, Sister Service and Allied/Partner Nation Senior Noncommissioned Officers in the ranks of E7/E8 to lead the force in the employment of air and space power in support of US national security objectives and interests. We do this by focusing on Senior Enlisted Leader Organizational Leadership Environments, National, Military & Air Power Strategy, and Integrated Deterrence & Strategic Competition.\n\nChief Master Sergeant Joshua R.

SMSgts must attend A800 before 1 year time-in-grade. Note: Senior noncommissioned officers who complete a resident sister service equivalent course or Joint Special Operations Forces Senior Enlisted Academy will receive enlisted professional military education credit for completing resident Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy. Graduates of sister service and joint equivalent courses may opt, based on their priority level and on a space-available basis, to attend Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy.\n\nAFPC/EPME selects regular Air Force Airmen for resident enlisted professional military education attendance based on grade, date of rank, priority, and eligibility.\n\nPriority 1: SMSgts by seniority (based on date of rank, total active federal military service date, pay date and date of birth).\n\nPriority 2: MSgts selected for promotion to SMSgt (based on date of rank, total active federal military service date, pay date and date of birth).\n\nPriority 3: MSgts (non-selects to SMSgt) based on promotion board score (highest to lowest).\n\nPriority 4: Eligible Air Force and Department of Defense and other civilians, sister service and international students on a space available basis.\n\nThe A800 schoolhouse plays no part in student selection.
