The Academy is the single in-resident school for Airmanship 800 (formerly known as the AF Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy) and Airmanship 900 (formerly known as the Chief Leadership Academy) located at Kisling Hall on Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, Alabama. Our facility is dedicated to our third Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, CMSgt Richard D. Kisling, who was the driving force and staunch advocate of enlisted professional military education.\n\nOver 25 Academic days, A800’s curricula is designed to prepare our Active Duty, Air Reserve Component, Sister Service and Allied/Partner Nation Senior Noncommissioned Officers in the ranks of E7/E8 to lead the force in the employment of air and space power in support of US national security objectives and interests.
