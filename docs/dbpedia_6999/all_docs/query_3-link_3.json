        "text": "Constructivism is the theory that says learners construct knowledge rather than just passively take in information. As people experience the world and reflect upon those experiences, they build their own representations and incorporate new information into their pre-existing knowledge (schemas).\n\nRelated to this are the processes of assimilation and accommodation.\n\nAssimilation refers to the process of taking new information and fitting it into an existing schema.\n\nAccommodation refers to using newly acquired information to revise and redevelop an existing schema.\n\nFor example, if I believe that friends are always nice, and meet a new person who is always nice to me I may call this person a friend, assimilating them into my schema. Perhaps, however, I meet a different person who sometimes pushes me to try harder and is not always nice. I may decide to change my schema to accommodate this person by deciding a friend doesnâ€™t always need to be nice if they have my best interests in mind. Further, this may make me reconsider whether the first person still fits into my friend schema.\n\nConsequences of constructivist theory are that:\n\nStudents learn best when engaged in learning experiences rather passively receiving information.\n\nLearning is inherently a social process because it is embedded within a social context as students and teachers work together to build knowledge.\n\nBecause knowledge cannot be directly imparted to students, the goal of teaching is to provide experiences that facilitate the construction of knowledge."
