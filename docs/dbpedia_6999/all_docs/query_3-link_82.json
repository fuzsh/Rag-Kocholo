        "text": "About the ACT Test\n\nThe ACT® test motivates students to perform to their best ability. Test scores reflect what students have learned throughout high school and provide colleges and universities with excellent information for recruiting, advising, placement, and retention.\n\nMany times, students who are not considering higher education rethink their plans when they see their ACT test results. This is especially true for underrepresented students. To support college and career planning, the ACT also offers a career exploration component to help students identify career options.\n\nWho Typically Takes the ACT\n\nThe ACT test is designed for the 10th, 11th, and/or 12th grade levels to provide schools and districts with the data necessary to position students for success after high school.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMore than 1.34 million students in the 2022 high school graduating class took the ACT test.\n\nACT test scores are accepted by all four-year US colleges and universities, including highly selective institutions.\n\nThe ACT is not an aptitude or an IQ test. Questions are directly related to what students have learned in high school courses.\n\nThe ACT is administered both nationally and internationally each year, with additional state and district test dates.\n\nThe ACT is approved for use in state models for federal and state accountability.\n\nACT College and Career Readiness Standards\n\nThe standards are empirically derived descriptions of the essential skills and knowledge students need to become ready for college and career, giving clear meaning to test scores and serving as a link between what students have learned and what they are ready to learn next.\n\nWhen students take the ACT test, high school educators and counselors receive valuable information for guidance and curriculum development. K-12 professionals use ACT reports to:\n\nGuide students toward college and career readiness\n\nAssist students with college and career planning\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of instruction\n\nPlan changes and improvements in curriculum\n\nThe ACT Test User Handbook\n\nThis handbook offers educators the most comprehensive information for K-12 professionals about the ACT test. In addition to detailed information about updates to the test, accommodations, and reports, the handbook offers helpful tips about:\n\nPreparing for and Taking the ACT\n\nACT Reports and Services\n\nUses of ACT Data\n\nACT Scores\n\nWhat the ACT Measures\n\nThe ACT contains four multiple-choice tests—English, mathematics, reading, and science—and an optional writing test. These tests are designed to measure skills that are most important for success in postsecondary education and that are acquired in secondary education. The score range for each of the four multiple-choice tests is 1–36. The Composite score is the average of the four test scores rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe ACT English test puts an examinee in the position of a writer who makes decisions to revise and edit a text. Short texts and essays in different genres provide a variety of rhetorical situations. Passages are chosen for their appropriateness in assessing writing and language skills and to reflect students’ interests and experiences.\n\nThe ACT mathematics test assesses the skills students typically acquire in courses taken through grade 11. The material covered on the test emphasizes the major content areas that are prerequisites to successful performance in entry-level courses in college mathematics. Knowledge of basic formulas and computational skills are assumed as background for the problems, but recall of complex formulas and extensive computation are not required.\n\nThe ACT reading test measures the ability to read closely, reason logically about texts using evidence, and integrate information from multiple sources. The test questions focus on the mutually supportive skills that readers must bring to bear in studying written materials across a range of subject areas. Specifically, questions will ask you to determine main ideas; locate and interpret significant details; understand sequences of events; make comparisons; comprehend cause-effect relationships; determine the meaning of context-dependent words, phrases, and statements; draw generalizations; analyze the author’s or narrator’s voice and method; analyze claims and evidence in arguments; and integrate information from multiple texts.\n\nThe ACT science test measures the interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills required in the natural sciences. The test presents several authentic scientific scenarios, each followed by a number of multiple-choice test questions. The content of the test includes biology, chemistry, Earth/space sciences (e.g., geology, astronomy, and meteorology), and physics. The questions require you to recognize and understand the basic features of, and concepts related to, the provided information; to examine critically the relationship between the information provided and the conclusions drawn or hypotheses developed; and to generalize from given information to gain new information, draw conclusions, or make predictions.\n\nThe optional ACT writing test is an essay test that measures writing skills taught in high school English classes and entry level college composition courses. The test consists of one writing prompt that describes a complex issue and provides three different perspectives on the issue. You are asked to read the prompt and write an essay in which you develop your own perspective on the issue. Your essay must analyze the relationship between your own perspective and one or more other perspectives. You may adopt one of the perspectives given in the prompt as your own, or you may introduce one that is completely different from those given.\n\nComplete information about the ACT test is available in the technical manual.\n\nACT High School Report\n\nThe ACT High School Report provides comprehensive information about a student's needs, interests, background, and abilities. The report includes the following sections:\n\nIdentifying Information\n\nScores and Predictive Data\n\nCollege Readiness\n\nInformation about Colleges\n\nCollege Selection Items\n\nEducational and Vocational Plans\n\nEducational Needs and Interests\n\nInterest Inventory Scores and Map Regions\n\nYou can also see the questions that students answer when they register to take the ACT test:\n\nFor training on how to use data from the ACT test for advising and curriculum development, see the list of available videos, webinars, and workshops that ACT offers.\n\nElectronic Score Reporting\n\nData from the ACT High School Report are available in ASCII flat file format, delivered online for high schools and districts to import into any system set up to receive the data. Records are available on demand as scores are released. Data is also provided for the current testing year as well as three previous testing years.\n\nThe current High School Record Layout (xlsx) is the key to interpreting the file you receive from ACT. It identifies location, field name, and field content for each data element.\n\nTest Prep\n\nHelp your students do their best on test day!\n\nACT offers numerous ways for students to prepare for test day, including:\n\nThe Official ACT Self-Paced Course, Powered by Kaplan — Bite-sized, on-demand lessons offer the perfect mix of structure and flexibility.\n\nThe Official ACT Live Online Class, Powered by Kaplan—A whole team of expert teachers keeps you engaged in a virtual classroom.\n\nThe Official ACT Subject Guides - Individual prep books perfect for students who want to practice a specific subject to improve their test scores.\n\nThe Official ACT Prep Guide—An ACT-authorized prep book, with three practice tests, each with an optional writing test, plus access to hundreds of additional questions online.\n\nPreparing for the ACT—This free booklet includes helpful test information, a complete practice test, and a sample writing prompt.\n\nSample Test Questions—Practice questions to give you a taste of what to expect on the ACT test.\n\nLive and On-Demand Webinars - Choose from live and recorded webinars to help make the most of your ACT test prep options.\n\nACT Online Prep\n\nHelp your students prepare for the ACT test.

Because these institutions, as well as the examinees, rely on the integrity of ACT test scores, ACT takes seriously the importance of reporting valid test scores.\n\nIn addition to conducting our own internal score reviews, ACT regularly receives inquiries from college admissions officers, high school counselors, and others who have concerns about an individual examinee's score.\n\nScore Inquiry\n\nYou can report concerns using ACT's Score Inquiry form. ACT will review the inquiry and investigate the validity of the scores. If you prefer, you may submit an inquiry anonymously online or by calling 855.382.2645 to use our dedicated Test Security Hotline.\n\nIf ACT initiates a score review, ACT will notify the examinee directly. For privacy reasons, ACT generally does not discuss the details of a score review with anyone other than the examinee unless the examinee expressly authorizes us to do so by executing an Authorization to Release Personal Information form.\n\nOnly official score recipients will receive notice of ACT’s decision regarding the validity of the scores. For your institution to be an official score recipient, the examinee must request that ACT send the score report to your institution. An examinee can send official scores by logging into his/her ACT web account and choosing \"Send Your Scores.\"\n\nFor complete details of ACT's score review process, please see Procedures for Investigating Testing Irregularities and Questioned Test Scores (PDF).\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAuthorization to Release Information (PDF)\n\nProcedures for Investigating Testing Irregularities and Questioned Test Scores (PDF)\n\nContact Test Security"
