        "text": "What many researchers in scientific laboratories fail to understand is they have brought a faulty premise into the laboratory with them. Many scientists in these research facilities have been taught from their earliest education that ultimate truth cannot be discovered and the wonders they see in the microscope are all a product of random chance. Truth is approached as a moving target and all that is in the world has no ultimate purpose beyond what the person at the microscope can muster.\n\nDr. Lindsey went on to state,\n\n\"For many years, doctors took the evolutionary perspective on tonsils, believing they were a useless leftover organ from our distant past. As a result they would remove them at the slightest provocation (which in many cases resulted in causing other problems).\"\n\nNow science has discovered that the tonsils are a part of the immune system--we don't understand fully how they work, but they have a role in the body's disease prevention. As a result, now doctors are much more \"pro-tonsil\" and will not remove them unless there are very significant reasons. If we want the best results we should tint our research with the creation perspective. Even if we don't understand entirely the function of an organ, the fact that God put it in the human body means that it must have value and we can continue to search for that value as opposed to labeling it worthless. This has certainly proved true in the case of the tonsils.\n\n\"Science\" always meant \"knowledge\" until its 19th century relegation to that which can occur only naturally without outside influence. This was done to exclude creationism from science classrooms. At any rate, the \"scientific method\" means to observe, to test, to repeat, etc. Knowledge which can be obtained in this manner is said to be \"scientific.\"\n\nA creation scientist does not have to apologize because he believes the Bible. Evolutionists believe in things they cannot prove by the scientific method. It is logical to make the assumption that the God who created the universe would be able to state facts about that world in His Word to man. A proof of this is as man's knowledge (those things he can observe and test) expands, he finds more and more scientific truths abound in Scripture.\n\nDr. Lindsey continued:\n\nScientific research has documented that the chemicals responsible for blood clotting in a new born baby reach a peak on the eighth day after birth--and it is interesting and more than coincidental that the mandate in the Bible was to circumcise a male on the eighth day. Here we see what I call scientific biblical information lining up with modern day scientific discovery. When God wrote the Bible, even if He did not go into total detail regarding science, what He did say on the subject is absolutely accurate and true and truth has practical value and application. On the other hand, if something is not true, as in the case of evolution, then its application is not only going to be impractical, but harmful.\n\nDr. Lindsey's comments sound like a modern day version of Psalm 36. We see this in a study of Psalm 36 which contrasts the differences between the evolutionist with \"no fear of God before his eyes\" (Psalm 36:1) and the creationist. Remember, the \"fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy is understanding\" (Proverbs 9:10).\n\nIt could be said the creationist believes, \"In Thy light shall we see light\" (Psalm 36:9).\n\nThe End Result of \"Nothingness\"\n\nThe person in Psalm 36 who does not fear God ascribes to the first tenet of the Humanist Manifest II, which is the hallmark of evolution: \"No God will save us, we must save ourselves.\" The Psalmist gives insight into the heart and mind and actions of a person who does not fear God: \"The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good\" (Psalm 36:3). Iniquity is an interesting Biblical concept, broad in its meaning and destructive in its consequences. Dr. James Strong, in his Concordance of the Bible, describes the \"iniquity\" of Psalm 36 thus: \"from a word meaning to 'pant,' hence to exert oneself, USUALLY IN VAIN, TO COME TO NAUGHT, nothingness\"\n\nThis word is translated as several other words in the Old Testament that give insight into the character of a person who has no fear of God: \"False, unjust, unrighteous, vanity, evil or wicked.\"\n\nThe difficult thing for most Christians to realize is that vanity (iniquity) is not neutral in its Biblical sense. It is DESTRUCTIVE. One may think of a vain idea as being empty or perhaps without effect. But one must look at the effects of emptiness in order to gain an understanding of the destructiveness of what the Psalmist calls vanity. If a person chooses to reject God and embrace untruth, then he, by Biblical definition is called \"vain\" or \"evil\" or \"wicked.\" The Bible speaks of this type of person: \"Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion\" (Isaiah 41:29). \"When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth\" (Proverbs 11:7). \"The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish\" (Proverbs 10:28). No matter what the expectation of a person who begins with untruth, the end of unbelief is not productiveness, rather it is to perish.\n\nEvolution is the Counsel of the Wicked\n\nWhen Solomon spoke of vanity, he coupled the meaning with \"leading astray.\" Jeremiah also speaks of this: \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain (lead you astray): they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord\" (Jeremiah 23:16). This \"vision of their own heart\" was not some ancient idea dead and buried in the time of Jeremiah. These false prophets were in the business of keeping people from knowing the one true God. Evolution's primary foundation stone is just that; there is not one true God. Proverbs 12:5 says \"the thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.\" Evolution is deceitful because it is not true and can be defined as the \"counsel of the wicked.\"\n\nWhen the Psalmist asked in Psalm 14:4 \"Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?\" the word he employed for \"iniquity\" is the same as the \"words of iniquity and deceit\" mentioned in Psalm 36. \"Knowledge\" in Psalm 14:4 is knowledge of the Lord and the Psalmist is saying that the choice is between a knowledge of the Lord or iniquity. The Psalmist then says these people \"eat up my people (God's people) as they eat bread\" (Psalm 14:4). Turning one's back on the knowledge of God destroys not only learning, it destroys people.\n\nHow Does This Relate to Educating Children?\n\nFurther light is shed on the devastation of iniquity elsewhere in the Psalms: \"He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail\" (Proverbs 22:8). This verse is speaking of the education of children. When one \"sows iniquity\" or in essence pulls God out of the picture, then he can reap only vanity--or destructiveness. Under these circumstances the \"rod\" of correction will not be applied for godly training, but in anger, and it is doomed to \"fail.\"\n\nIt can be concluded that iniquity and untruth are an exertion for nothingness or toward failure. It's the \"no win scenario.\" It is like a self-collapsing hole that is not only worthless in itself, but becomes destructive and self-perpetuating in its influence. Note, for instance, Proverbs 17:4, \"A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.\" An evil person will listen to lies. Not only does a lie corrupt the thinking to begin with, (as in the evolutionary lie), but after the person believes the lie, it snares him into believing other lies.\n\nAlthough the above commentary may sound pretty bleak, it does give some insight into why the children of our society seem to have no hope. They have been fed the lie of evolution and its destructive influence is filtering through to every area of their life.\n\nPsalm 36 also gives the other side of the issue. It speaks of one who believes God as Creator:\n\n\"O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life\" (Psalm 36:6-8).\n\nThe Bible: More Than Just Another Book\n\nThe Bible says \"the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\" By contrast, the wicked don't even know what they stumble at. (Proverbs 4:18). In order to recognize error, one must have a strong working knowledge of truth.\n\nExperts decry the present state of our educational system and develop and redevelop methods of education. People wonder why children of past generations were better educated, better thinkers, inventors and responsible citizens. It certainly isn't because those generations had the wealth of technology we have today, or better or bigger libraries. It isn't because their facilities were large or because their teachers were specialists in their respective fields.\n\nThe reason the children of past generations had a brighter future is because Psalm 36 is true. \"In Thy light (the Lord's light), we shall see light.\" It has only been in recent generations that the Bible has been banned from the educational process. When truth is pulled from the foundation of education, then there can be no true illumination, only destruction. Lindsey sounds a warning about what will happen if the evolutionists continue to have control of our educational system:\n\nI have read articles by evolutionists who have taken their theory to the logical scientific conclusion as a scientific tool. They believe if evolution could turn molecules into man, there should be no problem so difficult it cannot correct. If evolution, by accident, can do what all the scientists in the world with their laboratories and modern technology cannot do (create life in all its forms) then evolution should certainly be able to solve all the much simpler problems in the world around us.\n\nThese evolutionary authors have recommended that we stop doing some of the things we are doing and wait on evolution. Why preserve the environment or some particular ecological niche when we are just preserving the inferior? The logic of an evolutionist would conclude that since evolution has done a better job than man ever could, we should stand back and let nature take its course. Basically stated, they believe the world will accidentally get better and better.\n\nThe Truth is Useful, Error is Useless\n\nLindsey concluded:\n\nThe problem with this random chance approach to improving the real world is that scientifically it does not work. In the history of science, there has never been documented a single problem which has been solved by evolution. Real scientific observations tell us that accidents always result in chaos and cause problems. If you want things to improve, it takes deliberately imposing plan and purpose on the circumstances. As a problem solving tool, time and chance are useless. Let me emphasize again--if something is true it will be useful, and if it is not true, it will be useless.\n\nNo one will argue that the goal of education is to produce useful, productive, fulfilled human beings. If that goal is to be accomplished, then one must look to the foundation upon which that education is built.\n\nIf religious books are not widely circulated among the masses in this country, I do not know what is going to become of us as a nation. If truth be not diffused, error will be; If God and His Word are not known and received, the devil and his works will gain the ascendancy; If the evangelical volume does not reach every hamlet, the pages of a corrupt and licentious literature will; If the power of the Gospel is not felt throughout the length and breadth of the land, anarchy and misrule, degradation and misery, corruption and darkness will reign without mitigation or end. -- Daniel Webster."
