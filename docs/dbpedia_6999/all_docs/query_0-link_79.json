Please visit the eproxy website (https://eproxy.utexas.edu/) for instruction on how to gain access to pay your student’s tuition and/or housing and dining bills.\n\nInstallment Plan\n\nThe minimum amount to confirm your attendance is $1,500 for Texas residents and $5,000 for non-residents. The remaining balance of your tuition bill is due on the 12th class day. If you choose to not pay the remaining amount on the 12th class day, you will automatically put on an installment plan and incur a $15 fee.\n\nView payment deadlines.\n\nPay by Mail\n\nChecks may be mailed, but payment must be received in our office and posted to the student’s account by 5 p.m. on the payment deadline, or registration may be canceled.\n\nMake checks payable to “The University of Texas at Austin.”\n\nBe sure the student’s full name and UT EID are on the check.\n\nMultiple checks should be mailed together to ensure proper and timely posting of the payment.\n\nNote: Payment for University Extension classes must be sent to the University Extension office.\n\nOur Mailing Addresses\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\n\nStudent Accounts Receivable, Main 4\n\n110 Inner Campus Drive, Stop K5308\n\nAustin, TX 78712-1669\n\nPay with Scholarship\n\nZero Bill\n\nIf you have a zero ($0.00) tuition bill, you still need to confirm your attendance by clicking the “Confirm Attendance” button on My Tuition Bill before the 5 p.m. deadline on your payment due date, or your classes will be canceled.\n\nCheck to see whether you are eligible for a tuition exemption, rebate or waiver\n\nPay with a Tuition Loan\n\nIf you need assistance paying your tuition bill on time, short term tuition loans are available for the remaining balance of your tuition bill.\n\nTo apply, go online to Tuition Loans on UT Direct.

Please click here for further assistance on timing and paying your bill with financial aid.\n\nOutside Scholarships\n\nThe majority of private donor scholarships are disbursed through the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA). In most cases, scholarship donors will send checks directly to the university for processing, but not always. Tuition will be adjusted after OSFA processes the scholarship.\n\nMail outside scholarships to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid at:\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n\nAttn: EMBS\n\n1616 Guadalupe, Mail Stop E3700\n\nAustin, TX 78701"
