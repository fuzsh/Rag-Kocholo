        "text": "Independent Home School\n\nRegistering as an independent home school means that the student’s parent or legal guardian is the teacher of record and is responsible for ensuring all educational requirements are met under the law. To independently home school in Tennessee, parents or legal guardians must possess a high school diploma or a high school equivalency credential approved by the state board of education and must submit an Intent to Home School form to the school district where the family resides. Parents may withdraw their child to independent home school at any point during the school year. To continue operating as an independent home school, a new Intent to Home School form must be submitted before the start of each school year. Students graduating from an independent home school receive their diplomas and transcripts from their parent-teacher.\n\nIndependent home school students must take the TCAP assessment in grades five, seven and nine.\n\nEach Tennessee school district has a home school coordinator whose responsibilities include assisting families with compliance for independent home school.\n\nChurch-Related Umbrella School (Category IV)\n\nA church-related “umbrella” school is a satellite program offered by some Category IV non-public schools. “Umbrella” or satellite programs allow parents or legal guardians to participate as a teacher in the church-related school under the supervision of the school’s director. Under Tennessee state law, parent-teachers are subject to the requirements established by the church-related school for home-school teachers. Additionally, parent-teachers whose students are in grades nine through twelve (9-12) must possess at least a high school diploma or a high school equivalency credential approved by the state board of education.\n\nAn Intent to Home School form is not required for students enrolled in a church-related school because these programs are approved non-public schools. However, upon withdrawal from public school, parents or legal guardians may be required to provide proof of enrollment in the church-related school to the local school district. As a non-public school, the church-related umbrella school is responsible for student record-keeping and testing requirements. Students graduating from an umbrella school receive their diploma and transcripts from the church-related school at which they are enrolled.\n\nTo access a list of state-approved Category IV church-related umbrella schools, visit the Non-Public Schools webpage and click on the current Non-Public Schools List. Umbrella programs are identified in the first column titled “Home School Umbrella.”\n\nAccredited Online School (Category III)\n\nAn accredited online school is a Category III non-public school that is accredited by a Tennessee State Board of Education (SBE) approved regional accrediting agency.\n\nAn Intent to Home School form is not required for students enrolled in an accredited online school because these programs are approved non-public schools. Instead, parents or legal guardians must provide proof of enrollment to the local school district. As a non-public school, the accredited online school is responsible for student record-keeping and testing requirements. Students graduating from an accredited online school receive their diploma and transcripts from the online school where they are enrolled.\n\nA complete list of Category III accredited online schools, including a list of approved regional accreditors is available below. It is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian to ensure that their student has been enrolled in an online school that is approved in Tennessee.\n\nAccredited Online Schools List (08/05/24)\n\nSBE Policy 3.500"
