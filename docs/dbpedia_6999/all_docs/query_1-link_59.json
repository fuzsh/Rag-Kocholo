        "text": "Educational Services: NAICS 61\n\nAbout the Educational Services sector\n\nThe educational services sector is part of the education and health services supersector.\n\nThe Educational Services sector comprises establishments that provide instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects. This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and training centers. These establishments may be privately owned and operated for profit or not for profit, or they may be publicly owned and operated. They may also offer food and/or accommodation services to their students.\n\nEducational services are usually delivered by teachers or instructors that explain, tell, demonstrate, supervise, and direct learning. Instruction is imparted in diverse settings, such as educational institutions, the workplace, or the home, and through diverse means, such as correspondence, television, the Internet, or other electronic and distance-learning methods. The training provided by these establishments may include the use of simulators and simulation methods. It can be adapted to the particular needs of the students, for example sign language can replace verbal language for teaching students with hearing impairments. All industries in the sector share this commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of instructors with the requisite subject matter expertise and teaching ability.\n\nNorth American Industry Classification System\n\nThe educational services sector consists of a single subsector, Educational Services: NAICS 611. Data published under either the sector or subsector classification are included in the tables below. The subsector consists of these industry groups:\n\nElementary and Secondary Schools: NAICS 6111\n\nJunior Colleges: NAICS 6112\n\nColleges, Universities, and Professional Schools: NAICS 6113\n\nBusiness Schools and Computer and Management Training: NAICS 6114\n\nTechnical and Trade Schools: NAICS 6115\n\nOther Schools and Instruction: NAICS 6116\n\nEducational Support Services: NAICS 6117\n\nWorkforce Statistics\n\nThis section provides information relating to employment and unemployment in educational services. While most data are obtained from employer or establishment surveys, information on industry unemployment comes from a national survey of households. The following tables present an overview of the industry including the number of jobs, the unemployment rate of those previously employed in the industry, job openings and labor turnover, union membership and representation, data for occupations common to the industry, and projections of occupational employment change.\n\nEmployment, Unemployment, and Openings, Hires, and Separations\n\nData series Back\n\ndata Apr.\n\n2024 May\n\n2024 Jun.\n\n2024 Jul.\n\n2024\n\nEmployment (in thousands)\n\nEmployment, all employees (seasonally adjusted)\n\n3,857.0 3,851.9 3,853.4 3,846.2\n\nUnemployment\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n2.3% 2.8% 5.3% 5.6%\n\nJob openings, hires, and separations (in thousands)\n\nJob openings\n\n226 197 162\n\nHires\n\n70 84 115\n\nSeparations\n\n72 133 143\n\n(Source: Current Employment Statistics, Current Population Survey, Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey)\n\nUnion Membership and Representation\n\nData series Back\n\ndata 2020 2021 2022 2023\n\nUnion membership and representation\n\nMembers of unions (percent of wage and salary workers)\n\n13.5% 12.9% 12.4% 12.9%\n\nRepresented by unions (percent of wage and salary workers)\n\n15.5% 15.2% 14.4% 14.8%\n\n(Source: Current Population Survey)\n\nEmployment by Occupation\n\nData series Employment,\n\n2023\n\nEducation administrators, elementary and secondary school\n\n297,070\n\nElementary school teachers, except special education\n\n1,406,220\n\nMiddle school teachers, except special and vocational education\n\n625,650\n\nSecondary school teachers, except special and vocational education\n\n1,038,950\n\nTeacher assistants\n\n1,141,550\n\n(Source: Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics)\n\nProjections\n\nFor projected (future) employment estimates, see the National Employment Matrix, which includes employment estimates by industry and occupation for educational services.\n\n(Source: Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections)\n\nEarnings and Hours\n\nWeekly earnings by union membership status are shown.
