        "text": "Psychology is a relatively young discipline, but psychologists have introduced many different ways of thinking about the human mind and behavior since its inception. When psychology first emerged as a science separate from biology and philosophy, the debate over how to describe and explain the human mind and behavior began.\n\nStructuralism was psychology's very first school of thought and was advocated by the founder of the first psychology lab, Wilhelm Wundt. Almost immediately, other theories began to emerge and vie for dominance.\n\nIn the past, psychologists often identified themselves exclusively with one single school of thought. Today, most psychologists have an eclectic outlook on psychology. They often draw on ideas and theories from different schools rather than holding to any singular perspective.\n\nLet's explore some of the major schools of thought that have influenced our knowledge and understanding of psychology to better understand its past and present.\n\nThe Structuralist School of Psychology\n\nStructuralism is widely regarded as the first school of thought in psychology. This outlook focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components. Major thinkers associated with structuralism include Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener.\n\nThe introspective experimental technique used by the structuralists involved having trained observers examine their inner responses. Using this approach, also known as experimental self-observation, experimenters like Wundt trained people to analyze their thoughts as carefully and objectively as possible.\n\nWhile these methods were understandably not the most empirically rigorous, the structuralist school of thought played an important role in the development of experimental psychology.\n\nThe Functionalist School of Psychology\n\nFunctionalism formed as a reaction to the theories of the structuralist school of thought and was heavily influenced by the work of William James. It functioned on the mind's functions and adaptations.\n\nIn a functionalist approach, for example, instead of trying to understand the underlying processes that cause mental states, the focus would be on understanding the function that those states serve. Gaining a better understanding of the purpose would allow psychologists to understand how the mind allows people to respond and adapt to their environments.\n\nThe functionalist school was interested in the purpose of thoughts and behaviors, whereas structuralism was concerned with the elements that make up consciousness. While functionalism largely disappeared as a school of thought, its influence persisted in applied psychology, behaviorism, and educational psychology.\n\nThe Gestalt School of Psychology\n\nGestalt psychology was a school of psychology based upon the idea that people experience things as unified wholes. This approach to psychology began in Germany and Austria during the late 19th century in response to the molecular approach of structuralism.\n\nSome thinkers associated with the Gestalt school of thought included Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka.\n\nSome examples of Gestalt thinking include explanations for optical phenomena, such as visual illusions. Wertheimer described the phi phenomenon by observing how alternating railway lights created the illusion of movement. The phenomenon suggests that a succession of images seen in rapid sequence are perceived as moving.\n\nThe Behaviorist School of Psychology\n\nBehaviorism became a dominant school of thought during the 1950s. It was based upon the work of thinkers such as John B. Watson, Ivan Pavlov, and B. F. Skinner.\n\nExamples of behavioral theories that emerged during this time include:\n\nClassical conditioning: This is a type of learning that involves associating a previously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response. For example, pairing the sound of a bell with the presentation of food. After an association is formed, the previously neutral stimulus will produce the same response as the natural stimulus.\n\nOperant conditioning: This type of learning involves using rewards and punishments to create an association between the behavior and the consequences of that behavior.\n\nThe behavioral school of psychology significantly influenced the course of psychology. Many ideas and techniques that emerged from this school of thought are still widely used today. Behavioral training, token economies, aversion therapy, and other methods are frequently used in psychotherapy and behavior modification programs.\n\nThe Psychoanalytic School of Psychology\n\nPsychoanalysis is a school of psychology founded by Sigmund Freud. This school of thought emphasized the influence of the unconscious mind on behavior. Other major psychoanalytic thinkers included Anna Freud and Otto Rank and neo-Freudians such as Erik Erikson, Alfred Adler, and Karen Horney.\n\nFreud believed that the human mind was composed of three elements: the id, ego, and superego.\n\nThe id consists of primal urges.\n\nThe ego is the component of personality charged with dealing with reality.\n\nThe superego is the part of the personality that holds all the ideals and values we internalize from our parents and culture.\n\nFreud believed that the interaction of these three elements led to all of the complex human behaviors.\n\nOther important theories within the psychoanalytic school included the idea of the conscious and unconscious, Freud's psychosexual approach to personality development, and the concept of life and death instincts.\n\nMany traditional Freudian approaches to treatment are no longer in favor, but modern psychoanalytic therapy continues to play an important role in psychology today. Research has shown that using self-examination can play an important role in emotional growth and that it can be an effective treatment for a number of conditions, including depression and anxiety.\n\nThe Humanistic School of Psychology\n\nHumanistic psychology developed as a response to psychoanalysis and behaviorism. The development of this school of thought in psychology was heavily influenced by the work of humanist thinkers such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Clark Moustakas.\n\nHumanistic psychology instead focused on topics such as:\n\nBecoming a fully functioning person: A person who is in touch with their innermost desires and trusts their own instincts\n\nIndividual free will: The capacity that individuals have to make choices, select courses of action, and control their own lives\n\nHierarchy of needs: A theory introduced by Maslow suggesting that people were motivated by a series of increasingly complex needs, starting with their basic physiological needs up to the need to achieve an individual's full potential\n\nPeak experiences: Moments of pure, transcendent joy that play an important part in the reaching self-actualization\n\nSelf-actualization: A state of reaching one's full potential\n\nThe Cognitive School of Psychology\n\nCognitive psychology is the school of psychology that studies mental processes, including how people think, perceive, remember and learn. As part of the larger field of cognitive science, this branch of psychology is related to other disciplines such as neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics.\n\nCognitive psychology emerged during the 1950s, partly as a response to behaviorism. Critics of behaviorism noted that it failed to account for how internal processes impacted behavior.\n\nExamples of theories that grew out of the cognitive school of thought include:\n\nStages of cognitive development: A theory proposed by Jean Piaget, which suggested that children go through a series of progressive stages of intellectual development.\n\nSociocultural theory: This theory, introduced by Lev Vygotsky, looked at how the interaction of cultural and social factors contributed to cognitive development.\n\nInformational processing theory: This theory suggests that the mind functions much like a computer to process and interpret information about the world.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was also heavily influenced by this psychological perspective. CBT is an approach to treatment that focuses on how automatic negative thought patterns influence behavior and psychological problems.\n\nBiological Psychology\n\nBiological psychology, also known as biopsychology or behavioral neuroscience, is a school of thought that focuses on how biological factors influence mental processes and human behavior. Topics of interest in this school of thought include genetics, brain structure, hormones, and neurotransmitters.\n\nThis school of thought takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating aspects of psychology, biology, and neuroscience. Using these methods, researchers investigate how biological and psychological factors interact to influence people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nThis school of thought emphasizes the study of the biological causes of mental health conditions. For example, psychologists working in this area might focus on the biological and genetic factors that play a role in causing mental disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Treatments rooted in this approach may focus on medications that help improve neurotransmitter balances to address brain abnormalities.\n\nTakeaways\n\nWhile some schools of thought have faded into obscurity, each has had an influence on the course of psychology's development. Some more recent schools of psychology, including behaviorism and cognitive psychology, remain highly influential.\n\nToday, many psychologists do not align themselves solely with a single school of thought. Instead, they may take a more eclectic approach, drawing upon many different perspectives and theoretical backgrounds."
