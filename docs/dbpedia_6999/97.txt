7 Ways Education Powers a Better World

Here are seven ways the power of education makes the world better:

Education Spreads Awareness

It Helps Us Stand Up Against Wrong And For The Right

It Helps Progress

It Gives Us a Healthier Lifestyle

Helps Us To Be More Productive

It Helps Us Connect Across Borders

It Gives Empowerment

1. Education Spreads Awareness

Blind faith and superstitions are what bog down society. People misled by false beliefs do more harm than good to society. Education helps us question, gives us an analytical mind, and helps us reject superstitions. An educated mind asks for logic and scientific reasoning behind all actions.

2. It Helps Us Stand Up Against Wrong And For The Right

Education helps lower the crime rate. That’s because the educated can differentiate between what’s right and what’s wrong. Research has shown that increasing the high school completion rate by just 1 percent for all men ages 20-60 would save the U.S. up to $1.4 billion per year in reduced costs from crime. This is true for other regions as well.

3. It Helps Progress

Better education opens up a host of opportunities and this is especially relevant in the times we live in where technology and education ensure that opportunities are not bound by geography.

4. It Gives Us a Healthier Lifestyle

Better-educated people tend to live longer and have better lifestyles. For example, research conducted in central European OECD countries has shown that a 30-year-old tertiary-educated man can expect to live eight years longer than a 30-year-old man who has not completed upper secondary education. While a tertiary-educated woman can expect to live four years longer than a woman without an upper secondary education.

5. Helps Us To Be More Productive

It is a fact well known that the more degrees you have, the better would be your economic performance. There is a deep connection between education and productivity and in this age where there is competition at every turn, education is what will help an industry and subsequently a nation, to flourish.

6. It Helps Us Connect Across Borders

Digital education has helped achieve this. Education has given students from across borders opportunities to connect and communicate and work towards building a better future and a better world. For example, a professor in America can help inspire a student in Afghanistan to study and travel the world, and help herself and a whole generation after her, to lead a better life.

7. It Gives Empowerment

Education helps turn weakness into strength. Education gives us the confidence to stand up for ourselves. It improves our decision-making capabilities, makes us mobile, and gives us access to social networks. For those seeking assistance in academic endeavors, various paper writing services are available online to provide support. Many types of research have proven that in countries where women are subjected to gender bias, education helped them stand up against marital violence, improved their decision-making capabilities, and helped them take charge of their own lives.
