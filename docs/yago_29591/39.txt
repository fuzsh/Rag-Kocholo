Dimitri Marick is making a comeback to "All My Children."

The Online Network announced on Monday that Michael Nader will reprise his role on the June 3 episode.

"I got a call from executive producer Ginger Smith who said Prospect Park is relaunching 'All My Children' online. She said, 'We'd love for you to come back.' And I said, 'You want me, you got me.' Being back, is like being home," Nader said in a statement.

Apparently, Brooke English (Julia Barr) will offer Dimitri a job as the head of one of Chandler Enterprises new divisions, Chandler Media, which he will gratefully accept.

Nader first appeared on the soap in 1991 and later became a power couple with grande dame Erica Kane (Susan Lucci).

Since leaving the show in 2001, Nader has appeared on "Law & Order: SVU and "Cold Case." Previously, he appeared "As the World Turns," "Dynasty" and "Magnum P.I."

New episodes of "All My Children" are available Monday-Thursday via The OnLine Network, Hulu and Hulu Plus.
