        "text": "I’ve been wanting to write something about ALL MY CHILDREN for quite awhile, but it’s been difficult for me to accept that it’s actually coming to an end. Today. ALL MY CHILDREN is ending today. What a sad sentence to write.\n\nCreated by soap legend Agnes Nixon, ALL MY CHILDREN debuted on ABC on January 5, 1970. Even if you’ve never seen an episode of the soap, you at least know its most famous resident, Erica Kane, portrayed by daytime queen Susan Lucci. As with all of her daytime dramas, Nixon sought to create a show grounded in humanity and social issues. ALL MY CHILDREN was the first show to discuss the Vietnam War in depth, and most famously, it was the first television series in daytime or primetime to feature a legal abortion. Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter were daytime’s first African American supercouple. Bianca Montgomery (Erica’s daughter) and Lena Kundera were the first characters to share a same-sex kiss in daytime. ALL MY CHILDREN has held a significant place in pop culture and television history for 41 years.\n\nI’ve been watching ALL MY CHILDREN for about 20 of those years. Maybe longer. People don’t believe me because I’m only 25, but what can I say? My mother stayed at home when I was young, and if I wanted to spend time with her between noon and 3 p.m. on weekdays, I had to watch soap operas. Therefore, I became addicted to ALL MY CHILDREN, ONE LIFE TO LIFE and GENERAL HOSPITAL at roughly the age of 3. I’ve fallen away from all three soaps at different points, and I would always eventually come back. But a few years ago, I stopped coming back to ALL MY CHILDREN except to watch a few episodes here and there when an old character returned.\n\nI can tell you the exact storyline that made me turn away, and I know its the same storyline that turned others away as well. Remember that historic abortion I just mentioned? In 1973, Erica Kane was married to Dr. Jeff Martin when she became unexpectedly pregnant. Erica didn’t want her modeling career to end, so she had an abortion without telling Jeff. Nothing ever stays secret for long on a soap opera, and eventually everyone found out about the abortion once Erica developed an infection from the procedure. The storyline immediately took on historical significance and was cited and lauded for decades.\n\nAll that was destroyed in 2005 with Erica’s “unabortion.” That’s right. We found out that Dr. Greg Madden, the doctor who was supposed to perform Erica’s abortion, was so obsessed with Ms. Kane that he removed the embryo from Erica’s uterus and implanted it into his wife’s. Fast forward to 2005, and meet Josh, the son that Erica thought she had aborted in 1973. But the revisions didn’t stop there. Suddenly, Erica was saying that the reason she had the abortion was because she was scared and confused. The real reason she had her abortion (to protect her modeling career) was swept under the rug, forever changing the character of Erica Kane. And that’s when ALL MY CHILDREN lost me. Sure, I tuned in during Dixie’s numerous returns and when Jesse and Angie reunited after everyone believed Jesse had been dead for 20 years. But I never stuck around for long. Even a hardcore soap fan like myself has a breaking point. By the way, the show ended up killing off Josh in 2009. How pointless.\n\nI don’t want to focus too much on the negative today because I truly do love ALL MY CHILDREN. There are so many characters that I have loved and followed for 20 years, and it’s hard to believe we won’t be seeing their stories anymore. Soap operas are not written to end, so it’s been strange watching storylines wrap up and (gasp!) people actually getting happy endings. Yes, Prospect Park has plans to move ALL MY CHILDREN online, but I can’t imagine that the Pine Valley that we see a few months from now will be the same Pine Valley we see today. Vets like Susan Lucci (Erica Kane) and Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) won’t be moving online. Other actors like Jacob Young (JR Chandler) and Debbie Morgan (Angie Hubbard) are moving on to other soaps. I can only assume that Prospect Park’s ALL MY CHILDREN will be filled with recasts and young actors who won’t need to be paid as much. I hope I’m wrong. Despite my bleak predictions, I applaud Prospect Park for recognizing the entertainment value of soap operas and for doing something to save soaps from being lost forever.\n\nSo as ALL MY CHILDREN closes out its 41-year run on ABC, I’m reflecting on some of my favorite moments and storylines from the two decades I have been a fan of this soap opera. In no particular order:\n\n– Susan Lucci finally won the Daytime Emmy in 1999 after 19 nominations. I totally cried. And I just cried again watching this video. It really is delightful. Even Oprah is thrilled!\n\n– Erica Kane finally married Jackson Montgomery in 2005. Even though she’s had seven other husbands, he’s the man she was always meant to be with.\n\n– Haley and Mateo fell in love on screen as their portrayers, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, fell in love off screen. I was 9 or 10 and was obsessed by the fact that they were together in real life.\n\n– Erica’s daughter Bianca developed anorexia in 1997. I was 11 years old, and I now realize what an important storyline that was for me to see at that age.\n\n– Erica married Dimitri Marick twice in the 1990s. In between, she stabbed him with a letter opener because she was having hallucinations of her rape at age 14. Despite the stabbing and the affairs, I LOVED them.\n\n– Stuart Chandler’s wife Cindy died of AIDS, leaving him to care for her son, Scott. Apparently Cindy died in 1989, so either I have an amazing memory, or I saw clips of her death at a very young age. I swear I remember watching this happen.\n\n– Julia Santos’ face was scarred when a chandelier fell on her during a tornado. She ran away and fell in love with Noah Keefer. I was only 8 years old, but I remembering absolutely loving these two together.\n\n– GENERAL HOSPITAL’s Anna Devane was revealed to be alive on the wrong soap. I’ll always be resentful that Anna and Robin had their reunion in Pine Valley instead of Port Charles.\n\n– Simone Torres, one of my favorite characters who never got enough screen time, was murdered by the Satin Slayer in 2006. She had a fun relationship with Tad Martin that I always wished would have become something more.\n\n– Bad boy Ryan Lavery and Hungarian princess Gillian Andrassy fell in love, but then Gillian died tragically. Like “We’re about to leave for our honeymoon, but whoops, you got shot in the head first” tragically.\n\n– Bad boy Leo du Pres (Josh Duhamel!) and bad girl Greenlee Smythe fell in love, but then Leo died tragically. So much tragedy all the time on these soaps.\n\n– Tad fell off a bridge into a raging river and was presumed dead. I for real thought he was dead and was a very sad child.\n\nThose are some moments that stand out to me. And now I realize I’ve gone this entire post without expressing my undying love for Adam Chandler. That is tragic!\n\nI’d be interested to see what moments stand out to other fans. If you have ever been a fan of ALL MY CHILDREN at any point in your life, please share some memories in the comments. And I encourage you to not only watch today’s episode but also every episode from this week, which you can find here.\n\nI leave you all with the following poem written by Agnes Nixon for the All My Children photo album in the opening credits. And I would just like to say thank you to Agnes and to all the actors, writers and fans who have kept ALL MY CHILDREN alive for 41 years. And thank you to those who are trying to keep this great drama alive even longer. If soap operas have taught me anything, it’s that anyone can come back from the dead. ALL MY CHILDREN can do it, too.\n\nThe Great and the Least,\n\nThe Rich and the Poor,\n\nThe Weak and the Strong,\n\nIn Sickness and in Health,\n\nIn Joy and Sorry,\n\nIn Tragedy and Triumph,\n\nYou are ALL MY CHILDREN."
