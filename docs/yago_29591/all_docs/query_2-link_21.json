        "text": "Oct. 2, 2001\n\nAll My Children Fan Luncheon\n\nJohn Callahan told the crowd that he doesn't know if he and expectant wife Eva LaRue Callahan will have a boy or girl, but \"I hope it will be a Callahan,\" he joked. I sent Michael Nader (ex-Dimitri) out of town.\" Callahan, of course, referring to the time his on-screen brother slept with Edmund's missus, Maria. Callahan wasn't the only one thinking of the ousted actor. A contingent of Michael Nader Loyalists sported \"Bring Back Michael Nader\" tags and were armed with a new petition.\n\nBack To Top\n\nJuly 31, 2001\n\nHope For Michael\n\nThanks so much for the Michael Nader interview [ in the July 3, 2001 issue]. It took a lot of courage to face the public head-on. He knew he had a problem and that he needed help. Now that he is in recovery, each day will be a plus for him. Hopefully, all of the fan support he has will help him to keep his attitude up. We are looking forward to seeing him again on AMC. But only when he is ready!\n\nDianne Mills, via email\n\nBack To Top\n\nSoap Opera Update - July 17, 2001\n\nIs The Real Dimitri Returning?\n\nMichael Nader's legal problems were the reason he left All My Children . With those problems now taken care of, will the show want him to return? Nader has no hard feelings about AMC temporarily recasting his role. He feels he failed the show, the show didn't fail him, and he would return if asked. AMC recently wrote his character off when Dimitri and Alex left town, but that doesn't mean he can't return...with Nader in the role.\n\nBack To Top\n\nJune 28, 2001:\n\nLeeza Gibbons: \"The handsome daytime star goes from playing a count to pleading guilty to a count of drug possession. Barry Nolan has more on Michael Nader's personal struggle.\"\n\nNolan: \"The news in February was grim. The wildly popular star on All My Children had been busted for selling cocaine. Nader lost his job and then dropped out of sight.\"\n\nWinkel: \"He needed something like this dramatic arrest for him to really hit bottom.\"\n\nNolan: \"Gabrielle Winkel spoke exclusively with Michael Nader for the upcoming issue of Soap Opera Weekly . Nader burst on the scene as Dex on Dynasty in the 80's. Then a DUI arrest in 1997. Seventeen years of sobriety blown in an instant.\"\n\nWinkel: \"He started to drink again...and then his mother died and at that point the pain was so great he turned to cocaine.\"\n\nNolan: \"In the weeks to come the once dashing Dimitri looked drawn and tired. In the wee hours of February 24th, the Soap star showed up at this seedy after-hours bar.\"\n\nWinkel: \"The police came in with guns and it turned out he was with an undercover cop. Early press reports were that he sold coke to the cop. It was just shared.\"\n\nNolan: \"After a long night in jail, Nader checked himself into rehab and he told Gabby Winkel he credits co-star Mark Consuelos with helping him through some of his darkest hours.\"\n\nWinkel: \"He (Mark) was really there for Michael. He said, 'Look you've got a problem. You've got to deal with it.' He was very encouraging.\"\n\nNolan: \"Today Michael confesses to watching his old friends on All My Children , including his Dimitri replacement. ABC has said it would consider Nader's return after his treatment, but for now the actor spends time with his teenage daughter and hopes someday to return to the small screen.\"\n\nLeeza Gibbons: \"That's really tough. I wish him well.\"\n\nBack To Top\n\nJune 25, 2001:\n\nHis arrest on cocaine charges cost him his job, now he talks about his drug problem and his downfall.\n\nQuoting Michael Nader, \"I lost 20 pounds. Drugs and alcohol take your spirit.\"\n\nThat was the soap star's emotional statement about his arrest. He was alleged to have sold drugs to an undercover cop, those charges were dropped. A ten year veteran of All My Children , Nader was replaced by another actor and checked himself into the Hazelden clinic and denies rumors that he is HIV positive.\n\nHe comes clean about his arrest and addiction in next weeks Soap Opera Weekly . He credits the arrest with getting him back on track and Mark Consuelos with getting him into rehab.\n\nMichael's castmates say they'd love to see him back soon. [They show Julia Barr and Michael E. Knight at the Emmy's.] Julia Barr says, \"I think he is really getting his act together.\" Michael E. Knight says, \"We hope he is in a place where he is safe. And we can't wait to get him home.\"\n\nMichael's character will be written out of the soap. They are sending him on a long vacation.\n\nBack To Top"
