        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. At what location did we first see Alex?\n\nAnswer: Pine Valley Airport\n\nAlex arrived in Pine Valley under sad circumstances since her husband, Dimitri, had collapsed on the plane en route to Pine Valley. Dimitri was rushed to the hospital, from the airport, and Alex was right behind him. Veteran soap opera actress, Finola Hughes, originated the role of Alex Devane.\n\n2. Alex did not object to Dimitri having an open casket \"funeral.\"\n\nAnswer: False\n\nDimitri's family was planning to have an open casket \"funeral' after his \"death\" but Alex immediately objected to the plans. Edmund asked her who she was and she introduced herself as Alexandra Marick and that she had just married Dimitri. The real reason why Alex objected to this arrangement was due to Dimitri being alive and, had the \"funeral\" been open casket, his family would know the truth about him being alive. Alex's objective was to secretly treat Dimitri due to how he had a rare brain disorder.\n\n3. Who was the first one to inform Edmund that Alex may have a shady history as a doctor?\n\nAnswer: David Hayward\n\nEdmund started to wonder about Alex since she remained a mystery, so he informed David about her and her career as a doctor. Edmund asked David if he could find some of Alex's patients since he was investigating the cause of Dimitri's \"death.\" David told Edmund that he would be lucky to find any of Alex's patients alive. However, Alex was never disciplined for any wrongdoing.\n\n4. Alex pushed a man named Geoffrey Ashford down a flight of stars since he killed his daughter. Who was his daughter?\n\nAnswer: Cassandra\n\nAlex's past came back to haunt her when she started having visions of a man named Geoffrey Ashford. Geoffrey was someone who had a daughter named Cassandra and Alex befriended her. It turned out that Geoffrey killed Cassandra and Alex wanted to make him pay. She pushed him down a flight of stairs, one night, and he died.\n\n5. What branch of medicine did Alex Devane practice?\n\nAnswer: Neurology\n\nAlex was introduced as a world renowned neurosurgeon and Dimitri went to see her when he started to have some serious health symptoms. She diagnosed him as having a rare neurological disorder and promised him she would help find a cure to it. When she practiced medicine in Pine Valley, it was as a neurosurgeon. Another \"AMC\" character that was a neurosurgeon was Dr. Maria Santos Grey.\n\n6. Anna Devane is the only sister Alex has.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nFor some time on \"AMC\", it was believed that Alex only had one sister, that being her twin Anna Devane (Finola Hughes portrayed this character on \"General Hospital\" from 1985 to 1992 and on \"AMC\" from 2001 to 2003). However, Alex and Anna's nephew, Aidan, came to town and it was revealed that he was the son of their sister, Lindsay. Anna, Alex, and Lindsay also have a half brother, Gabriel.\n\n7. What was the name of the man who tried to kill Alex in mid 2000?\n\nAnswer: Guy Donahue\n\nAlex was, one day, held hostage by someone and she overpowered him with martial arts moves. She started to look into her past some more and a man named Guy Donahue came to work at Wildwind (where she was staying). Guy was hired by Alex's aunt, Charlotte, to kill Alex but Alex wound up killing him. Hunt Block portrayed Guy Donahue.\n\n8. In the Fall of 1999, Alex was riding one of Edmund's horses and he had to be put down. What was the name of the horse?\n\nAnswer: Maximilian\n\nAlex started to take up horseback riding as a hobby and she rode one of Edmund's horses, Maximilian, one day. Maximilian became injured and Edmund came by to take a look at him and he realized that Maximilian could not survive. He put him to sleep and Alex was devastated.\n\n9. What was the name of the foundation that Alex founded in Dimitri's \"memory\"?\n\nAnswer: The Andrassy Foundation\n\nAlex and David came up with an idea to create a foundation in Dimitri's \"honor\" after he had supposedly died. They decided to name it The Andrassy Foundation (Andrassy was Gillian's last name and Gillian was a distant cousin of Dimitri's). Dimitri did eventually come back from the dead and, despite this, The Andrassy Foundation continued to function.\n\n10. Alex left town in July of 2001 for which European nation?\n\nAnswer: Hungary\n\nAlex and Dimitri got a phone call about a mysterious relative, but they did not say who it was. They decided to pack up and leave town to go head to Hungary. They said goodbye to their loved ones and went to go live at Dimitri's estate, Vadzel, in Budapest.\n\nSource: Author CAGuy0206\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor Gamemaster1967 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
