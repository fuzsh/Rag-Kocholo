Though loving, the Harts keep her adoption a secret from Kendall and, as a child, she learns she was adopted when she overhears them discussing it. Having felt displaced all her life, Kendall unseals her adoption papers where she learns her lifelong idol is her birth mother, Erica Kane. Longing for her approval, Kendall arrives in Pine Valley as a teenage runaway but keeps her true identity as Erica’s daughter a secret at first. Erica hires Kendall as her personal assistant. Mona, Erica's mother, recognizes a birthmark on Kendall’s neck and realizes Kendall is Erica’s baby girl she had Erica give up for adoption to the Harts after she had held Kendall as a baby. Mona secretly reveals to her friend, Nick, that Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by movie actor Richard Fields. Meanwhile, Kendall reveals to Myrtle that Erica is her mother and begs Myrtle to keep her secret. She only wants to be Erica’s daughter and to tell her the truth on her own time. Being jealous of the attention her half-sister Bianca Montgomery receives after a horse riding accident, Kendall reveals the truth to Erica and Erica welcomes Kendall into her life as her daughter.\n\nReaching out to Kendall, Erica invites her to live with her and they work on their mother-daughter relationship. Kendall and the other Kane women celebrate Erica’s marriage to Dimitri. They all work to grow as a family. Kendall and Bianca bicker, each feeling jealous of the attention the other sister receives from Erica. Bianca destroys Kendall’s bridesmaid dress and Kendall manipulates Bianca, ignoring her sister’s calls when Bianca locks herself inside a crypt until she reveals her sister's location. As Kendall and Erica work on their relationship, Kendall later wonders who her biological father might be. Erica tries to protect an unaware Kendall from the painful truth of who he was but, after Kendall begs to know, she reluctantly reveals it, distressing Kendall. Despite promises to drop the subject and repeated warnings from Erica against finding him, Kendall decides she needs to confront her biological father and resolves to find him. Her step-father, Dimitri, offers to help Kendall find him and Kendall develops a crush on her step-father. When they find Richard Fields, he deceives Kendall by lying to her that he never raped her mother and spins a fairytale version of that night. Kendall, desperate to believe she was not conceived in rape, makes herself believe him. When Erica learns that Kendall went against her warnings about Fields and her husband helped her daughter find him, she is furious and leaves Wildwind, demanding a divorce from Dimitri.\n\nWeeks later, when Alice calls Kendall and asks her to return to Florida, Kendall asks Erica for another chance. Erica gently implores her daughter to stop hurting herself and return to the Harts after explaining that, despite her efforts, she can no longer try to be the fantasy mother Kendall dreamed her to be. Kendall is shattered by this and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her step-father, having mistaken his paternal feelings for her as attraction. Dimitri explains he only loved her as a daughter. After he rejects her, Kendall is distraught and turns to her friend, a medical student from Hungary named Anton Lang, to talk. She loses her virginity to him that night when they sleep together. Upset by the possibility of being pregnant, Kendall goes to her mother the next morning and says Dimitri raped her. Enraged, Erica accuses Dimitri of raping her daughter and, overcome with memories of her own rape, stabs him with a letter opener believing him to be Fields.\n\nWhen Erica’s trial for stabbing Dimitri comes around, Kendall is called as a witness. On the stand, Kendall lashed out at Erica. She incriminates her mother by saying she stabbed Dimitri out of jealousy because of the attention Dimitri had showered on her. Kendall falsely tells the jury the only thing she told Erica was that she had unprotected sex with Anton and was scared that she was pregnant. However, after Kendall brings Fields into her life in Pine Valley (believing his lies that he is not dangerous, loves her, and she is unable to accept people trying to caution her against him), she is horrified to catch him trying to molest her sister and stops him, saving Bianca before any assault occurs. Devastated to accept Fields raped her mother, Kendall turns against him and apologizes to Erica. She recants her former testimony. The DA charges her with perjury and Kendall is sentenced to 30 days in a minimum security prison, where she has the most unlikely of cellmates: Janet Green.\n\nNot knowing who Janet really is, Kendall fills her in on all that happened in Pine Valley and, though she is upset at first when she learns who Janet really is, the two become friends. Anton proposes to Kendall while she is in jail and Kendall accepts. However, when a writer named Del Henry proposes the idea of a tell-all book about her mother to Kendall, Anton threatens to call of their engagement if she continues to scheme. Dimitri learns Anton is his son but keeps this secret. Upon Kendall’s release, she and Anton return to Wildwind where they find Julia. Kendall and Julia begin a rivalry over Anton. Dimitri hires Kendall as his assistant on the condition she stop her schemes against her mother. However, Kendall is hurt over her relationship with Erica and secretly agrees to write the book about her mother with Del.\n\nKendall realizes Janet is going by an alias around town in an attempt to be with her daughter, Amanda. Janet confronts Kendall, fearful that she would break her cover. Janet asked Kendall to promise to never tell anyone about her disguise and explains her love for Amanda. Kendall promises. She told Janet she would never do anything to separate a mother from her child, wanting a close relationship with her own mother, Erica. The two become close friends.\n\nWhen Kendall's grandmother, Mona Kane Tyler dies, Kendall is deeply affected and attempted to pay her respects, only to be confronted by Erica, who mistakenly believes that Kendall is faking her grief and had come to cause a scene. Despite Kendall's heartfelt confessions, Erica orders her to leave. Later, when visiting Mona's grave, Kendall gets into another argument with Dimitri, which climaxes when Kendall demands to know why he still protects Erica after she stabbed him. Kendall resumes sabotaging her mother’s relationship with Dimitri and continues her work on the tell-all book with Del. When Del gets sick, Kendall supports him and they become friends. However, the book is discovered later that month. Anton leaves Kendall.\n\nFrustrated, Kendall tries a few ways to get Anton back, including faking a pregnancy and faking a suicide attempt. This fails so Janet tells Kendall she should lie to Anton that Dimitri is his father. When Kendall tells this “lie” to Anton, Anton doesn’t believe her and repeats it to Dimitri. Dimitri confirms he is Anton’s father. Furious, Anton finds Kendall and they marry to get revenge on their respective parents. Dimitri disowns Anton over his marriage. Anton’s mother, Corvina, talks Kendall into stealing a letter claiming Dimitri and Corvina were switched at birth. This would make Corvina, Anton, and (by marriage) Kendall the heirs to the Marick fortune. They find the leopard, supposed to contain the letter, empty so they forge the documents themselves and plant it at Wildwind. When the plot is discovered, Anton ends his marriage to Kendall.\n\nDel and Kendall’s friendship blossoms into a romance. Always believing in Kendall’s goodness, he helps her to let go of her anger at Erica and the Harts. Kendall is devastated when her father, Bill Hart, dies of a heart attack. She decides to return to Florida to be with Alice, and Del asks to go with her. Before Kendall leaves, she apologizes to Erica and mother and daughter make peace. Erica forgives Kendall and gives her Mona’s ring, hugging her as she wishes Kendall to be happy. Kendall returns in early 2002 under a new actress, Alicia Minshew.\n\nKendall Quotes\n\nKendall: I didn’t mean to cause trouble. Honest.\n\nKendall: I didn't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted them to accept me.\n\nKendall (to Erica): You got here pretty quickly. Your broom stick must be turbo-charged.\n\nKendall (to Dimitri): I'm the little gift from God she never told you about. I'm her first born.\n\nKendall: You put it in the paper that I’m your daughter.\n\nErica: I did. Is that alright with you?\n\nKendall: Thank-you! I will never forget this as long as I live.\n\n(Kendall complains to Erica about Anton)\n\nKendall: He's always following me! Every time I turn around or go outside, he's on my heels! The garden, the stables, he's always there, gawking, asking millions of questions! It's just unnatural!\n\nAnton: She's imagining things!\n\nKendall: I was in the kitchen, minding my own business-\n\nAnton: I wanted coffee!\n\nKendall: Yes, he drinks gallons of coffee so he can stay awake all night so he can shadow me!\n\nErica: I have a great idea! Let’s all go get some de-caf.\n\nKendall to Erica: I’m not going anywhere. If you don’t want me here you’re going to have to throw me out.\n\nKendall to Edmund: Am I so terrible for wanting to grieve for one of the only people who ever loved me?!\n\nKendall (about Erica): I'm ready to drive the final nail in her coffin.\n\nKendall (to Del): I count, Del, and I won’t be overlooked or ignored. People are going to stop and listen to me. For once in my life, I am going to be the center of attention. When that happens, I can stop living in my mother’s shadow and finally get on with my life.\n\n(Kendall is upset to hear about Erica’s accident but bumps into Noah on the way to her room)\n\nKendall: You, an orderly? You, up to your dreads in bed-pans. How very perfect.\n\nNoah: Shedding tears over your mama ain't dulled your fork tongue.\n\nKendall (in her apology letter to Erica): Maybe that same little voice inside me is the same one you heard when you were my age and that same voice driving you to be the best you can be is the same one driving me to be the best I can be.\n\nKendall to Del (after she and Erica make peace): She forgives me. My mother forgives me.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar on her AMC Days\n\n\"I chose to see Kendall as misunderstood, which was how, as an actress, I justified her actions - and I did.“ (Teen Queen; Soap Opera Digest, 1994)\n\n“She loves Anton because he takes care of her, but I think deep down she knows she doesn’t love him the way she should. She’d like to experience that mad, passionate chemistry. More than anything, Kendall wants Erica to love her.” (Daytime’s Hottest Young Stars; Soap Opera Magazine, 1994)\n\n\"I didn't know when I auditioned for Kendall that she would turn out to be who she is. I had heard rumors, but everybody was denying it. Besides, I was scared enough just to be working with Susan and then when they told me I would be playing her daughter, I was like, 'What? Daughter? Me?' I remember on my first day when I walked into the rehearsal hall, Susan and Michael were rehearsing a scene. I was very nervous. I kept thinking, 'What if I'm really bad and they fire me?' I just snuck in the back and tried to blend in with the coffee machine, when all of a sudden, Susan said, 'Hold it, we need to stop for a minute. Then she walked over to me and said, 'Congratulations! I'm very glad you're here.' She put her arm around me and said, 'Don't worry, nobody bites.' And then she introduced me to everyone who was there. She really did help me and always made sure I was okay during my first couple of weeks when I was still unsettled. Both Susan and Michael made me feel comfortable.\" (Learning Life’s Lessons; Daytime TV, 1993)\n\n“They (the fans) have a good time with (Kendall). They say Kendall is a young Erica, but I don’t remember a young Erica: I wasn’t born yet. I do know that Kendall and Erica are both very headstrong, very determined and very self-centered. I think they’re very much alike.” (Soap Opera Digest, 1994)\n\n\"I think that's what's the most fun about (Kendall). She's unpredictable, and it allows me to play different aspects of her. She's weak, she's strong, she needs men, she doesn't need men.\" (Star of the Year, 1994: AMC’s Sarah Michelle Gellar; Soap Opera Magazine, 1995)\n\n\"I was on All My Children while trying to graduate high school.\"\n\n\"I seduced my stepfather, and when he wouldn't sleep with me, I slept with the stable boy, cried rape, and my mother stabbed him with a letter opener. Then I went to jail for perjury, burned my parents' divorce papers, and locked up my little sister. I think that was all in the first week.\" (Buffy is Sweet, 16, and Slaying Vampires; The New York Times, 1997)\n\nFans on SMG as Kendall\n\n\"Sarah is a Genius Actress.
