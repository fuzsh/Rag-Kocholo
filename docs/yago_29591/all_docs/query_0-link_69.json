        "text": "General Hospital spoilers and rumors tease that Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader) may be headed to the United States wanting revenge for Alexandra Marick’s (Finola Hughes) death at the hands of her sister Anna Devane (Finola Hughes)! Although Dimitri was said to have divorced Alex in a 2019 General Hospital episode when Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) requested some records about Alex from him, in a more recent episode when he is packing a flash drive to send to Peter August (Wes Ramsey) he is shown wearing a wedding ring; so they may have reconciled before her death.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers – Alexandra Devane Was The Love Of Dimitri Marick’s Life\n\nLongtime General Hospital fans who followed Finola Hughes over to All My Children will recall that it was a very different Alexandra Marick who married Dimitri Marick. She was a neurologist who developed a miracle cure for a deadly neurological disease that Dimitri had contracted. She also saved Anna’s life, after tracking her down in the Canadian wilderness, being cared for in a remote cabin by an old man named Bart (Ralph Waite). Dimitri and his half-brother Edmund Grey (John Callahan) followed, bringing Bart and Anna back to Pine Valley and the Wildwind Estate where Dimitri lived.\n\nHowever, prior to saving Anna, Alex started having disturbing memory flashes of a life she couldn’t quite place and experiences she wasn’t sure were hers; Edmund, being an investigative reporter, tried to help her dig up her past but it was sealed by the British government. General Hospital fans will recall that Alex and Anna were subjected to memory mapping, and these had to be the result of that.\n\nIt was discovered that a woman named Charlotte Devane (Samantha Eggar) had separated Anna and Alex at birth, Anna having been raised by their real mother and Charlotte raising Alex. Charlotte was married to a relative of their father, Thomas Devane (uncast character) and was also a drug lord and a DVX spy! She brainwashed Alex to believe she was Anna, to impersonate Anna, and also to kill Anna! However, it was after all this that Alex ultimately saved her sister’s life. This was the Alex that Dimitri fell in love with!\n\nGH Spoilers – Dimitri Marick Never Remarried After Marrying Alexandra Devane\n\nEven though All My Children viewers know Dimitri was married several times prior to marrying Alex, he never remarried even though as of 2019 he had referred to Alex as his ex-wife. He may have not divorced her after all, even though she’s been in prison a few times and has been a drastically different Alex than she was in Pine Valley. This could be the result of the brainwashing returning; she, like Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) may have never successfully recovered!\n\nDimitri may have realized this and either they did not complete their divorce or he stood by her and they reconciled in between their prison stints! Dimitri was once a friend to Anna, and cooperated when Robert requested records on Alex, but now that she is dead, it may have wounded Dimitri emotionally to the point that he is no longer stable! Dimitri was once a powerful man who lived on a vast estate and was considered royalty in his native country as Count Andrassy. If Dimitri did indeed stand by Alex even through her recent years when she turned evil and possibly to her former brainwashed states, he may indeed seek revenge for her death!"
