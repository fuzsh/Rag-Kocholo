Whether a daytime soap or prime time drama, those who worked on shows like these have a special bond across the genre.\n\nAlthough not directly related to GH, General Hospital news reports confirm a fellow soap star has recently passed away. Michael Nader, who was best known for starring in the 1980s prime time drama, Dynasty as Dex Dexter, and his iconic role as Dimitri Marick on ABC’s, All My Children. Nader landed the role in which would forever be remembered as Erica Kane’s (Susan Lucci) husband. This became his most popular role. In the early 70s, Nader played Kevin Thompson on, As The World Turns.\n\nIt has been reported that Michael Nader died at his home in North Carolina on August 23rd, after fighting his battle with cancer. Nader’s wife, Jodi Lister, along with their family dog, Storm, was with him in his final moments. Michael was 76 years old.\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers reveal Jodi Lister broke the news to Michael Fairman, stating, “With heavy heart, I’m sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael,” Lister told Fairman. “We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted. Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms virtual event to help raise funds for Long-Covid research. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nMichael Nader has left behind his wife of 18-years, Jodi Lister, his stepmother Lillian, sister Stephanie, daughter Lindsay, ex-wife Robin, son-in-law Trevor, granddaughter Juniper, and dog, Storm."
