Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms virtual event to help raise funds for Long-Covid research. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nArleen Sorkin, Days of Our Lives Vet and Original Harley Quinn, Dead at 67\n\nBob Barker, Legendary Price Is Right Host, Dead at 99\n\nWWE Wrestler Bray Wyatt Dead at 36 - Cause of Death Revealed\n\nThe actor passed in his Northern California home, with Lister and their rescue dog Storm by his side.
