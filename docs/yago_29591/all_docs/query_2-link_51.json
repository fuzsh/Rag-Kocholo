        "text": "EAGLE-eyed viewers might have experienced an eerie sense of deja vu while watching last week’s season premiere of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”\n\nIt could have been that Dracula (Rudolf Martin) was once again mesmerizing helpless heroine Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar).\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, you thought you saw Dracula’s face before.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Gellar and Martin have worked together before, when Gellar played Erica Kane’s (Susan Lucci) scheming daughter, Kendall, on “All My Children” and Martin played Anton Lang, Count Dimitri Marick’s (Michael Nader) son.\n\nI put a call in to the busy Martin to ask how it felt to be working again with Gellar.\n\n“It was funny, seeing her once again after having not worked together in so many years,” he said. “[It was] very strange to all of a sudden be facing each other under totally different circumstances.”\n\nHow so?\n\n“Well, there’s not much biting and blood in daytime,” said Martin, who couldn’t really recall any special anecdotes from his days with Gellar on “AMC.”\n\n“It was so long ago,” he said. “I certainly remember starting, and the actors were always nice to me. It was a real learning experience. I wasn’t on very long, just the right amount of time and then I was out.”\n\nAfter leaving “AMC,” Martin has played Nicolai Krasnikov on Showtime’s “Beggars & Choosers,” a fictional series about the television business in L.A.\n\n“It’s sort of like ‘The Larry Sanders Show’ in the way it transcends the business and we can make fun of things that go on in real life,” he said.\n\n“My character comes in when this network decides to do a miniseries on the life of an alleged young Russian mobster.\n\n“They buy the rights to my story and when the actor portraying me gets killed I end up playing myself and get into all sorts of trouble, going on talk shows and the like.”\n\nMartin is also appearing in the 20th Century Fox film “Bedazzled,” in which he portrays a worker on a Colombian drug lord’s hacienda who becomes the nemesis of his boss (Brendan Fraser).\n\nHe will also be playing Dracula in the USA movie “Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula.”\n\nSpeaking of the Dracula legend, will Dracula be back on Buffy?\n\n“Well the thing is, Buffy herself says Dracula always comes back,” Martin said. “But I don’t know anything about this – nothing!”"
