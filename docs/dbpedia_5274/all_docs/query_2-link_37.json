        "text": "Allergies—Products that are currently manufactured by Crayola (not including products manufactured under license) do not include any of the following ingredients that are associated with common allergies: peanuts, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, eggs, or milk. Gluten (wheat flour) is an ingredient in Crayola® Dough. Other Crayola modeling materials, including Model Magic® modeling material, Model Magic Fusion™, Modeling Clay, and Air-Dry Clay are gluten-free. These products are produced on the same machinery. Although the machines are cleaned prior to the start of each production run, there is a slight possibility that trace amounts of gluten from Crayola Dough may be present in the other modeling materials. For information regarding specific ingredients or allergic concerns, please call our Consumer Affairs department at 1-800-272-9652 weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM EST.\n\nCrayola Color Explosion™ and Color Wonder™—Wash hands well with soap and water after use.\n\nCrayola Fabric Crayons or melting Crayola crayons—Whenever crayons are heated for an arts & crafts project, melt crayons in a well-ventilated area.

They would disintegrate when exposed to moisture.\n\nCrayola Dough—contains gluten (wheat flour) as an ingredient.\n\nCrayola Air-Dry Clay, Crayola Model Magic and Model Magic Fusion do not contain gluten (wheat flour). However, they are produced on the same machinery as Crayola Dough which does contain gluten. Although the machines are cleaned prior to the start of each production run, there is a slight possibility that trace amounts of gluten from Crayola Dough may be present in the other modeling compound products. For information regarding specific ingredients or allergic concerns, please call our Consumer Affairs department at 1-800-272-9652 weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM EST.\n\nCrayola Washable Paints—Not for use as body/face paint.\n\n3-D glasses—Should only be used for viewing 3-D images. Do not wear for long periods of time or while performing physical activities.

There is a possibility that photosensitivity may occur in children who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.\"\n\nScissors—\"ATTENTION: The cutting edges of scissors are sharp and care should be taken whenever cutting or handling.\" Blunt-tip scissors should be used only by children 4 years and older. Pointed-tip scissors should be used only by children 6 years and older.\n\nSilly Putty®—\"Direct contact can cause product to stick to hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes.

Keep uninflated balloons away from children. Discard broken balloons at once.\" Mylar® balloons may be used with children younger than 8 years.\n\nFeathers, fabric, and raffia should not be used in crafts that are wearable costumes or masks, due to flammability risks.\n\nFunctional sharp points or edges—\" CAUTION: Crafts that involve use of a functional sharp point should not be done by children under 4 years.\" (For example, use of staples, chenille stems/pipe cleaners, wire, pins, jewelry backings, sewing needles, or push-pins/thumb tacks.) Close adult supervision is required and adult assistance may be needed. Under no circumstances should open-blade craft knives or carving knives be used by a child of any age or used near children.\n\nMagnets—\" WARNING: Only use common magnets that have a weak attractive force, for example, magnetic tape or flexible refrigerator magnets. Never use permanent, high-attractive-force magnets, for example, rare earth magnets or magnets used in motors.\" If magnets being used are small parts,\n\n\" WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD—Small parts. Not for children under 3 years.\"\n\nMirrors, picture frames, and clay pots—Close adult supervision is required when children use craft materials that could shatter or break.\n\nHandheld mirrors, picture frames with glass, ceramic pots, and similar breakable items may be used only by children 8 years and older.\n\nFor children 7 years and younger, use unbreakable materials such as wood or sturdy plastic picture frames, unbreakable mirrors, and plant pots that will not shatter into sharp edges.\n\nModeling tools—Use the least dangerous point or edge sufficient to do the job. For example, toothpicks, craft sticks, plastic knives and forks, and cookie cutters can cut or carve modeling materials.\n\nPlastic bags—\" WARNING: Plastic bags can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation, keep bag away from babies and children.\"\n\nProtective coating & fixatives—Avoid using spray paints, solvents, and nail polish as fixatives for any craft. Instead, laminate with clear plastic adhesive paper such as Con-Tact® paper, coat with a diluted mixture of equal parts Crayola School Glue and water, blend paint with Crayola Tempera Mixing Mediums, or coat with a nontoxic acrylic glaze, as suitable for the project.\n\nRecycled household items—Whenever a Crayola arts & crafts project involves recycled materials, any item that has sharp edges or potential for hazardous exposure must be avoided. Additional safety guidance for use of recycled materials in arts & crafts projects:\n\nRecycled cardboard tubes—should be paper towel tubes, gift-wrap tubes, or long cardboard tubes that can be cut to any length. Health professionals caution against using recycled toilet paper tubes for arts & crafts projects because of potential fecal contamination.\n\nRecycled containers—must be clean and safe. Do not use containers that contained bleach or other harmful chemicals (for example, household cleaners or dishwasher and laundry detergents.) Do not use recycled metal cans that have sharp edges (for example, lids removed by household can openers.)\n\nRecycled egg cartons—Foam cartons must be washed with hot soapy water prior to use. Cardboard egg cartons cannot be sufficiently cleaned and should not be used.\n\nRecycled foam produce trays—should be washed in hot, soapy water. No meat or poultry trays should be used.\n\nRecycled shower curtains—should not be used as drop cloths for arts & crafts projects. Instead use old beach towels, tablecloths, or bed linens to cover surfaces.\n\nSponges, foam, and other expandable materials—Should not be used with children 3 years old and younger.\n\nString, raffia, lacing, yarn, ribbon, and similar materials—Close adult supervision is essential whenever children use these string-like materials.\n\nChildren 3 years and younger should not be given any string-like material that is longer than 12 inches.\n\nWhen crafts are to be worn around the necks of children 8 years and younger, attach the ends of the string-like material with clear adhesive tape, which allows easy release of the bond. When crafts are to be worn by children older than 8 years, the ends may be tied or knotted.\n\nWindows—Be sure windows are securely closed and locked before decorating. An adult must closely supervise the activity.\n\nWood products—By its nature, wood is rough and may contain splinters or sharp points."
