        "text": "DIY Alphabet Crayons\n\nThese DIY Alphabet Crayons are so cute, and your kiddos are going to love playing with them! They also make great party favors or gifts.\n\nWouldn’t it be cute to give your kid or their friends a personalized set of crayons that spells out their name?!\n\nOr a whole alphabet set for them to play with!\n\nSupplies:\n\nalphabet mold– this is the exact one I used\n\ncrayons – shop Michaels here, or Amazon here\n\nglitter – shop Michaels here (this is the glitter I used), or Amazon here\n\ncraft knife – shop Michaels here, or Amazon here\n\nDisclosure: My posts may contain affiliate links. If you buy something through one of those links, you won’t pay a penny more, but I may receive a small commission, which helps me keep this blog up and running, and partially supports my Coke Zero addiction. This includes links to amazon.com, because I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.\n\nInstructions:\n\nWatch the video below to see how easy it is to make these crayons, or scroll below the video to read the instructions.\n\nStep by step instructions:\n\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees.\n\nPick out all of the crayons you want to use. It doesn’t matter if they are already broken, or still whole. This is a great time to use all of those little left over pieces of crayons that your kids don’t use because they’re broken.\n\nSeparate the crayons into color families.\n\nPeel all of the paper off of the crayons. It’s very time consuming to peel them by hand, so I used a craft knife to cut the paper, and then pulled it off. Please be careful cutting the paper off – those craft knives are very sharp!\n\nBreak all of the crayons into small pieces. Each full crayon should be broken into 4-5 small pieces. Just use your hands to break them into small pieces – no knife needed for this part! Yay!\n\nI decided to add glitter to these crayons to make them even cuter. Just sprinkle the glitter into the bottom of the letter molds.\n\nPut the crayon pieces into the letter molds. I did my letters by color family. So one letter might have shades of pink/red, and one might be shades of blue, etc. But you could definitely do rainbow crayons, or a blue/green mix, or whatever you want. Sometimes I stood the crayon pieces up vertically, and sometimes I laid the pieces down flat. I was not anal about how I did it. The main thing you need to concentrate on is filling the mold completely, with no empty gaps.\n\nPut the letter mold on a cookie sheet.\n\nPut the cookie sheet in the oven. These will take about 10-15 minutes. You want to keep an eye on them, and pull them out when the wax is completely melted. (The pic below is after 7 minutes in the oven)\n\nAfter the wax is fully melted (mine took 15 minutes), pull them out of the oven and set the cookie sheet on a trivet so they can cool off and set up.\n\nAfter they are fully cooled off, pop them out of the silicone mold. I waited a full 24 hours to pop them out of the mold. To take the crayons out, just pull the silicone mold back and pull the crayon out. You do not have to be too gentle with the molds.\n\nWoo hoo! You’re done, and you have adorable alphabet crayons!!!\n\n*To wash the molds, I just washed them by hand with warm, soapy water. Then they can be reused again!\n\nWhile you’re here, check out some of my other popular crafts!\n\nDIY Shaker Tags\n\nDIY Shaker Bookmarks\n\nDIY Pom-Pom Peace Sign Wreath\n\nHow to Make a Pom-Pom Pillow\n\nHand Stamped Book Stacks\n\nHow to Hand Knit a Chunky Blanket\n\nHow to Hand Knit a Pillow\n\nNever miss a post!"
