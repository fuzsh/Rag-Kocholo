        "text": "“Write the story only you can tell. Oftentimes those stories are the ones inspired by your own experiences.” – Hanh Bui.\n\n“Don’t be afraid of the terrible first draft! So much of writing is really rewriting.” – Traci Huahn.\n\n“While it’s important to practice and improve your craft, it’s equally important to venture out into the world and experience life.” – Michelle Jing Chan.\n\n“Don’t be embarrassed about being a beginner….A pre-published writer is a real writer, with real work to do.” – Kate Jenks Landry.\n\n“If you want to deepen the heart in your writing, think about what you do day-to-day that’s core to who you are.” – Sylvia Chen.\n\n“Draw every day. Don’t just draw for the social media likes. Draw for yourself. It’s not about impressing others; it’s about staying true to what you love.” – Fanny Liem.\n\n“Rejection is part of writing, not to mention a part of life. You have to put yourself out there. This business is full of opportunities for rejection, so start embracing them early on. Rejection means you are writing – a place to find joy.” – Stephanie Wildman.\n\n“Nothing is easy at first but when your work comes from the heart, everything gets easier.” – Estafanía Razo.\n\n“Find yourself a trustworthy group of critique partners whom you can depend on.” – Kim Hoa-Ung.\n\n“Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed about your writing voice, thinking it might not sound like ‘real’ writing. The words you choose, the way you put sentences together, and the thoughts you include in those sentences come from who you are. That’s good enough. The world needs your voice!” – Jody Jensen Shaffer.\n\n“The things that make your art unique are also what make you as a person unique–a collection of life experiences, world view and identity, and personality quirks. If you are putting those things into your work, you’ll stand out as an artist. Let those experiences guide your creative decisions. There’s only one you. The closer your art gets to that core, the more it will stand out.” – Christopher Silas Neal.\n\n“Read your work out loud, ideally to someone.” – Basil Sylvester and Kevin Sylvester.\n\n“If you write and illustrate, then doodle your characters while you’re writing. It helps you better understand your characters.” – Kevin Sylvester.\n\n“Don’t try to conform or force yourself into a mold. The key is to create art that brings you joy and ignites your excitement. By following your artistic instincts and drawing what genuinely makes you happy, your unique style and direction will naturally emerge from your passion.” – Vivan Mineker.\n\n“Recognize that time spent not physically writing, like planning a story or mulling over an idea, is still part of the process.” – Sara Truuvert.\n\n“Pour as much time into your own life as you do your work! My greatest inspirations come when I am away from my desk and I have found that taking the time to step away from drawing is one of the most essential parts of my practice.” – Michelle Theodore.\n\n“Sometimes your best next story can surprisingly come from everyday elements in your life. Your inspiration can come in the most unexpected ways at the oddest times.” – Sylvia Chen.\n\n“Keep practicing what you are trying to achieve. I never went to art school, but took classes through Storyteller Academy and watched tutorials on YouTube.” – Kim Hoa-Ung.\n\n“Draw and write what you’re interested in because when you do, it’ll show up in your work.” – Benson Shum.\n\n“Remember that you are on your own journey and it’s not a straight shot. Much like your art, the end is not always what you expect.” – Tyler Charlton.\n\n“It’s ok to take the winding road – you don’t have to get there right away.” – Jack Wong.\n\n“The art of writing is never a waste of time or effort. You don’t need to worry about what it will become. Just participating in the act of writing itself gets your creativity in motion.” – Karen Greenwald.\n\n“It’s easy to get stuck because we want our work to be perfect. Relax! Experiment! Don’t be afraid to create something terrible, or to try something in a different way.” – Kate Jenks Landry.\n\n“Read as much as you can and read widely. Pay attention to and be curious about what’s happening around you or to you, from headlines, to conversations on the subway, to the texture of whatever you’re touching right now, to the way your voice changes when you pick up the phone. Remember that your perspective and your practice are worthy of respect, including your own.” – Sara Truuvert.\n\n“Your best work comes from the joy of creating. If you’re not having fun and pleasing yourself with what you create, stop and figure out why.” – Tyler Charlton.\n\n“Focus on your positives rather than spending your time and energy on negatives like comparison with others. The business side of trying to get and remain published can be disheartening. Actively choosing to fill your time with fulfilling, positive endeavors and people will leave you happier especially since all negatives can’t be avoided.” – Paul Coccia.\n\n“Don’t shy away from talking about your unique identity or struggles. Writing your truth will always resonate with readers. It helps heal others and yourself, too.” – Kaz Windness.\n\n“It’s unlikely you’ll come up with an idea that no one has had before. If you have two distinct interests (e.g. you’re into science and ballet), that combining those two interests could be something that not everyone sees.” – Jack Wong.\n\n“To aspiring picture book authors who are not also illustrators: It’s crucial to leave room for the illustrator to participate, not just in the look of the book, but in the actual storytelling and character design.” – Kate Jenks Landry.\n\n“Lifting other illustrator voices in the spirit of community and camaraderie—as opposed to competition—fuels strong partnerships that will endure far beyond the blip of a social media post.” – Lori Steel, Red Fox Literary agent\n\n“Consistent daily efforts at improving your craft and sharing that journey is your challenge. Most illustrators just want to draw and avoid the rest.” – Christopher Thornock.\n\n“Read like a writer. Find mentor texts and analyze how they are constructed and why they are successful.” – Ronnie Diamondstein.\n\n“Write every day, whether you feel like it or not. Even on days when you think every word is awful, it’s something to come back to and edit the following day.” – Daphne Benedis-Grab.\n\n“Always be curious and be a lifelong learner. So many doors can be opened to you if you’re willing to put in the work to investigate and find out about things.” – Teresa Robeson.\n\n“Some advice for young illustrators, especially recent graduates, is to avoid comparing yourself to your peers and setting unrealistic expectations.” – Angela Poon.\n\n“Whether you are young or old, remember who you are on the inside. Discover and nourish those facets of yourself that are ready to shine, and take action!” – Molly Ruttan.\n\n“Your story is unique and special and has never been told before. The world will be better if you share it.” – Daphne Benedis-Grab.\n\n“Writing prompts are an amazing way to compel your imagination to work.” – Heather Camlot.\n\n“Accept that there is no easy way to be published. Five different authors will tell five different stories to explain their success.” – Karen Henry Clark.\n\n“Publishing is a long-game business, so patience, perseverance, and passion will steer you to finding that just-right partnership you’re hoping to find!” – Lori Steel, Red Fox Literary agent\n\n“Find what you love and try to put it into everything you do.” – Billy Yong.\n\n“Write something that makes you laugh.” – Josh Funk.\n\n“The path can be long and winding. There are very few ‘overnight success stories!'” – Adriana Bergstrom\n\n“Don’t say “I’m going to be a writer.” Say, “I am a writer.” And then keep writing and revising, and paying attention to the world around you.” – Carmella Van Vleet\n\n“Read Ann Whitford Paul’s Writing Picture Books to grasp how many plates you must spin to write a successful manuscript.” – Karen Henry Clark.\n\n“Look up the works of those you admire and study them! You’ll grow in leaps and bounds the more you study/practice.” – Billy Yong.\n\n“If you love rhyme and want to sell books in rhyme, take the time to learn how to do it well. Don’t just assume you know what you’re doing because you ‘just hear it in your head.'” – Rebecca Gardyn Levington\n\n“Find a critique group with members who know more than you.” – Karen Henry Clark.\n\n“Illustrators: take care of your physical health as much as you can. Listen to your body. Take steps to recover and stretch, and adjust your setup if you need to.” – Adriana Bergstrom\n\n“Keep looking, keep drawing. Experiment, don’t be precious and don’t worry if not everything’s perfect – just keep doing it!” – Kate Kronreif.\n\n“Cast a larger net for art inspiration. Go to the museum, get inspired by musical theatre, fall down the rabbit hole of Victorian fashion or hip-hop music or cave paintings….That can all become fertile ground to draw inspiration from.” – Kaz Windness.\n\n“Exercise! Your meat shell needs care and loving attention. If you neglect your body, you’ll eventually find art-making much harder to do. So get out there and touch grass!” – Billy Yong.\n\n“Try not to compare yourself, your work or your journey to anyone else’s. No one can tell the stories you tell or make the art you make, so trust yourself and your instincts.” – Lisa Anchin.\n\n“Be sincere with yourself in your writing and art.” – Zahra Marwan.\n\n“Children’s books is a career that requires a deep and abiding passion. It’s not like in the movies where you have a book idea one day and get a huge book deal the following week and save the family farm from foreclosure.” – Kaz Windness.\n\n“Everyone starts with bad writing. Every single writer, every single time – no matter how long they’ve been doing it. You can’t avoid your own bad writing. You can’t go around it or over it or under it. You have to go through it. Just get it onto the page or screen. You can always fix it later! Don’t let the fear of bad writing stop you from writing. Remember: you can’t fix what isn’t there.” – Troy Wilson.\n\n“Children’s books is a career that requires a deep and abiding passion. It’s not like in the movies where you have a book idea one day and get a huge book deal the following week and save the family farm from foreclosure.” – Kaz Windness.\n\n“Write what you want to write, because as you move through the publishing process, it will become incredibly important for you to truly believe in your work.” – Anna Lazowski.\n\n“Comics should be fun for both the creator and the reader, so make sure to enjoy the process and don’t stress out about getting it right the first time.” – Ken Lamug.\n\n“Write anything and everything.” – Jake Maia Arlow.\n\n“Read lots and write lots. Whenever I feel at a loss for ideas or creativity, I find the best way to refill that well is to read.” – Graci Kim.\n\n“Sharing your experiences from a place of authenticity helps in creating a story that will educate as well as entertain.” – M.O. Yuksel.\n\n“Have patience, work hard, show your work, look at art, explore life, challenge yourself, communicate with a group of people you admire. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes.” – Hatem Aly.\n\n“Read widely across genres, even ones you don’t think you’ll enjoy. Some of my favourite reads in the past have been ones I never thought I’d like, and some of my best ideas have come from being inspired by things other authors have written.” – Graci Kim.\n\n“Picture books are visual storytelling, and it’s helpful to be knowledgeable about illustration even if one doesn’t illustrate.” – M.O. Yuksel.\n\n“I think the best work comes from the heart and writing about what you care most about in the world. My advice is to write about what you are passionate about – write the books you want to see in the world.” – Charlotte Offsay.\n\n“My advice for young illustrators: spend as much time drawing and developing your craft as possible, but also make time for other hobbies and interests as these will inform your work, too!” – Katie Rewse\n\n“Write from the heart. Find the thing you are passionate about and write that story. When you write with passion, people usually get it!” – Chrystal D. Giles.\n\n“READ. There is a world for you out out there. Books can help you connect with it, even if you’re feeling closed in and isolated. Books can also help open up your mind.” – Kevin Sylvester and Basil Sylvester\n\n“Read across lots of different genres, styles cultures, and eras. What made an impact on you – what kept you entertained? Is it description? The way characters speak? Humor? Remember how you felt listening to those stories (or reading them) and let those feelings inspire you when you start to write.” – Eden Royce.\n\n“Keep drawing! every day you draw, paint, or sketch, you get better, and it really does show after a time.” – Joelle Murray.\n\nWhen picking a topic for picture books, always keep the age of your reader in mind. If you’re writing about a particular issue, choose issues that connect with their age group experience. – Shelli R. Johannes.\n\n“If I could give advice to young writers, I’d tell them to be patient, to read a lot, and to just live life in general — it provides great inspiration!” – Christina Li.\n\n“Writing is not like Math. There are skills to learn, yes, but writing is NOT right or wrong. It doesn’t need correcting. It needs polishing so that your stories shine, and others can enjoy them too.” – Erin Dealey.\n\nGetting blocked or struggling with a scene? Think about the emotional truth of the scene. What emotions is the plot driving towards? – Christina Li.\n\n“My main advice: just keep going. Believe in your work because only you can do work like you. Practice, network and get your work out there – you will be found.” – Ellie Arscott.\n\n“Don’t talk about writing a book ‘someday.’ Make writing a priority. Someday is NOW.” – Erin Dealey.\n\n“There are only TWO things you need to know if you want to be an author: 1. The alphabet, and 2. How to tell a good story.

Your mind is always at work, whether you realize it or not.” – Sue Lowell Gallion.\n\n“I think it is always more important to focus on what you draw, instead of how to draw~ introduce your own favorite things to the audience, you will grow your technique along the way.” – Lisk Feng.\n\n“…We all must do battle with the nemesis that intends to bring us down. But word by word, line by line, we can persist. That is no small thing.” – Karla Valenti.\n\nKnow that your dreams can come true….even if people say it’s a long-shot. I’m living proof. – Marcie Colleen\n\nTo young illustrators: pursue an illustration style that inspires and excites YOU. Not everyone will appreciate your style of work, and that’s ok. Keep exploring, keep drawing, keep experimenting. – Shannon O’Toole\n\nPersevere. You never know which query will hit on the right time, right publisher, right theme. Meanwhile, research publishing houses and educate yourself on the industry. Join groups like CANSCAIP and SCBWI. – Caroline Fernandez\n\n“Write about things you’ve personally experienced. These are the things you can best and most authentically write about, and that you are likely more interested in working through. Your deep knowledge and passion will come through to agents and editors.” – Bev Katz Rosenbaum.\n\n“If you truly love to write, you should keep writing no matter what because you can never predict when you will published.” – Teresa Robeson\n\n“Don’t be afraid to fail (epically)! You grow by trying new things, stagnate if you don’t.” – Paul Coccia\n\nStay positive! There are so many naysayers who will tell you why you can’t do something or how hard it is to get your work published. Don’t be one of them. If this is what you want to do, this is what you do. Period. – Pat Cummings\n\n“Keep your eyes on your own page. In this business, it can be so hard to keep that green-eyed monster in check. Remember that rejection is part of the game. Celebrate what you can. Also, remember that if you’ve published something, you’ve changed someone’s life.” – Bev Katz Rosenbaum.\n\nOur job as writers isn’t so much about telling kids how to get somewhere but rather that they CAN get somewhere; they just need to keep going. – June Smalls\n\nDo things that invigorate and scare you.

One question can make all the difference. – Nancy Tupper Ling\n\nRead good books! Read good books that are like the kind of books you want to make. Then draw or write as much as you can. It all comes down to absorbing good stories, good art, and then practicing your own writing and drawing. – Jen Betton\n\nWrite. All the time. The more you write, the better you will get.

But what can you perfect if you have nothing on the page to revise? – Helaine Becker\n\nDon’t be afraid to be weird. – Kari Maaren\n\nIf you are just getting started, practice by drawing anything you like!

Sometimes, it’s time to move on. – Kate Blair\n\nPersistence and patience are invaluable in this business. – Pat Cummings\n\nBe patient, define success by your growth, and enjoy the journey.

Sure, it’s good to hone your craft, but don’t limit yourself to one genre and style. – Nancy Tupper Ling\n\nIf you love writing, WRITE. Not a day goes by when I don’t write.

Tell that story or draw that illustration that only you can do, and share it with others. – Sylvia Liu\n\nDon’t worry about coming up with the most original idea in the world. As long as you write from your own experiences and from the heart, your story will be different enough. – Dorian Cirrone.\n\nEven if you don’t think you want to be a writer, aim to write well. Writing is all about communicating and the more effectively we’re able to make ourselves understood, the more successful we are in relating to other people. – Ruth Spiro\n\nGet to know people in your field and show them the best of YOU. – Andrea Zuill\n\nIf thinking about stories and writing them down makes your inner self go ‘squee!’ then that’s all you need. So ignore those who say you can’t. Charge forth and just have fun; it’s where you’re meant to be. – Nicole Winters\n\nCarefully study your favorite artists & writers, see how they do what they do. – Kevin Sylvester\n\nEvery writer needs to take some basic business and sales courses.

Have an art/writing smörgasboard! you never know what sort of art or writing style you will love and shine in until you try it. – Jaime Temairik\n\nTo really make it in this business of writing, it takes more than talent.

You’ve got to write, and write a LOT. – Rob Sanders\n\nIf you get stuck while writing, write ANYWAY, even if it means writing about how stuck you are. Just write whatever comes to mind. – Kat Yeh\n\nWhile it’s important to learn and refine your craft, it’s just as important to find your own unique voice. – Jodi Moore\n\nMake your decisions, all of them, for a REASON. – Samantha Berger\n\nBe open to the vision others have for your book. – Vijaya Bodach\n\nFor non-fiction writers: Fact-check everything. Not only do mistakes undermine a story, but they misinform rather than educate the reader. – Heather Camlot\n\nLearn how to see the first solution but then set it aside until you’ve had a chance to explore other possible solutions. Tthen pick the best option and run with it. – Molly Idle\n\nLet everything else go and write with great joy…and a pen. A pen definitely helps. – Donna Gephart\n\nGo to the library and check out stacks of children’s books, study the pacing. There is a heartbeat and rhythm that great books share, no matter when they were published. – Brian Won\n\nWriting is hard work – but so is everything else. If you’re willing to work at it – and throw out whatever doesn’t fit, a hundred times in a row if need be, eventually you will create something of value. Be brave. BE determined. And at all times, be close to chocolate. – Helaine Becker\n\nEveryone has her or his own path. – Christian Trimmer\n\nDon’t believe your reviews — either good or bad. – Jane Yolen\n\nSeek a balance in your creative work and daily life that’s not only sustaining, but life-giving. – Eliza Wheeler\n\nIt’s really about discovering who you are, and what stories you want to tell. – Patricia Storms\n\nTry different styles, genres and voices.

They will show up in your writing. – Lauren McLaughlin\n\nFive letters, sound like “light”…WRITE! Do it every day. Do it for fun. – Christopher Cheng\n\nBe an immovable force.

It’s about daily baby steps and planting a small seed that grows gradually. – Eliza Wheeler\n\nRead as much as you can, for pleasure and for craft. – Cheryl Rainfield\n\nDon’t start out trying to be totally unique and breaking all the rules.

Give yourself a break and take it slow. – Andrea Zuill\n\nAlways find time to PLAY and HAVE FUN when you write. – Samantha Berger\n\nPicture book writers & illustrators: look at foreign picture books.

Simple focus on YOU: what you have to say and how you want to say it. – Lee Wardlaw\n\nYoung children are born naturals at noticing and observing. As writers, we need to nurture that skill. Our job is to go beneath the surface, beyond labels and first impressions. – Tricia Springstubb\n\nSet regular, realistic deadlines for yourself. – Joyce Wan\n\nWrite every day. Revise your work. Be patient. Don’t give up. – Laura Boldin-Fournier\n\nDon’t dumb down words or ideas. Respect language. It’s incredible. – Samantha Berger\n\nGet out there and meet other writers and creators. The camaraderie and support of a network of peers is invaluable. – Lisa Dalrymple\n\nEmbrace rejection. It is okay to hear “no thank you”. It helps light that creative fire and you learn from it. Not everyone is going to love your story. – Russ Cox\n\nLearn from the masters, but then respectfully ask them to leave your studio. – Alice Ratterree\n\nKnow that books are not just written, but rewritten. – Jane Yolen\n\nWrite what you’d want to read. – Josh Funk\n\nAll you can do, and all you must do, is to write the stories only you can tell. – Lauren McLaughlin\n\nGet honest feedback from other writers. – Cheryl Rainfield\n\nGo outside. Inspiration comes out “out there” more often than not. – Maral Sassouni\n\nRejection is part of the job. It’s one reason I have a picture of a ballerina on my office wall. It motivates me to remember how much hard work is required to be a professional. – Kate Dopirak\n\nTry not to be too obsessed with what is selling in ‘the market.’ – Patricia Storms\n\nYou never know unless you try to write. – Timothy Young\n\nDo your best, and then relax. Let this process loop and loop. Enjoy the journey. Because, really, why else are we doing this? – Maple Lam\n\nWrite about things that matter to you. – Patricia Newman\n\nWrite the emotional truth of what you want to know. – Donna Gephart\n\nTurn off the modern world and go outside. There are stories outside your house and studio waiting to be heard and told. – Russ Cox\n\nReaders need to be able to care about the subject of the book. Always put yourself in a reader’s chair and ask yourself the questions that a reader might ask. Then answer them. – Helaine Becker\n\nGet your first draft done. Accept that it’s a process. It’s okay that it’s not perfect. You’re making building blocks and you don’t know what pieces you need yet. – Arree Chung\n\nIf you’re going to be a writer, you gotta write. – Greg Pincus\n\nI think creative people often feel overwhelmed and paralyzed by self-doubt and the emptiness of a blank page. THINK BIG, ACT SMALL, but ACT nonetheless-ONE STEP AT A TIME towards your goals. – Joyce Wan\n\nJoin a critique group that provides a safe environment in which to share new ideas, ask those silly questions, and learn about the industry. – Susan Del Rizzo\n\nThere are days where we all feel like untalented hacks. All of us. And it’s really important to remember this.. – Samantha Berger\n\nDon’t listen to the “no”-it-alls. Only you can tell your own story. And the world needs to hear it. – Jodi Moore.\n\nNo matter how unfair and just-plain-wrong the comments from your critique partner/agent/ editor seem to be—there is usually truth in every critique. It’s your job to pull out the ‘why’ of their reactions. – – Hélène Boudreau\n\nNever stop honing your craft. – Henry Herz\n\nFind your voice … how do you do that? By drawing and learning and imitating and seeking critique and then finally becoming unconscious of your style. Then you have found your illustration voice. – Hazel Mitchell\n\nRead widely and wildly. Never condescend. – William Alexander\n\nYou positively, absolutely have to be a reader to be a writer. – Claire M. Caterer.\n\nLet people critique your work (and I don’t just mean your mom). – Chelsea Pitcher.\n\nWrite with emotional honesty, hope and respect. – Stephanie Burgis\n\nGet through English class but know that the real world just wants a good story, and isn’t as worried about brilliantly placed semi-colons and properly argued theses. – Tim Federle\n\nDon’t get too hung up on what you think is your first truly viable/sell-able manuscript. – Audrey Vernick\n\nStop wondering what they want. Stop looking at other people’s work. Make the art that is YOU. The art that you were born to make. – Kelly Light\n\nNo matter how good you think your idea is—the next one could be better. – Hélène Boudreau"
