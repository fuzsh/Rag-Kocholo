That graphic is why the change starts with you. 👀 How you see the world impacts how you move within it... 👀 How you see opportunities/challenges... 👀 How you see people... ...is all painted with *your colors* ⚫ Are you painting with just black & white? 🔘 Shades of gray? 🌈 The Crayola 8-pack? How much color - how many concepts, types of people, circumstances different from your life... how many alternative perspectives have you invited into your palette? When you challenge yourself to *see* more or different, *feel* more or different, *behave* with a greater range - you paint with more colors. You can operate within a bigger world in a bigger, more impactful way. If you want growth, clean up the biases, assumptions, and limiting beliefs that limit your palette. An entire color wheel awaits 🎨 *graphic text inspired by the lyrics of Hate You by Jungkook #mindset #emotionalintelligence #selfawareness #curiosityunleashed #growthmindset\n\n💌 **Reader's Submission from the Grit and Grace Community**: Hello, dear #GritAndGraceTribe, Ever had a canvas presented to you, marred with splatters and streaks? I did. Not a physical one, but the canvas of life. It was at a time when every phone call brought bad news, every letter was a bill or rejection, and every reflection in the mirror questioned my worth. Life's unfairness was that messy, chaotic canvas. In one of those reflective moments, a quote wrapped around my thoughts: _\"Life's unfairness is the canvas; your actions are the masterpiece.\"_ This was my cue. Instead of lamenting the dark patches, I chose to pick up the brush and paint my story. To reframe challenges as opportunities, to see the splatters as abstract art. My journey of reframing led me to various inspirations, one of which was a collection of stories and lessons – a lot like the tales we share here. Among them, I chanced upon a [book](https://amzn.to/48cj711) that spoke of life's canvases and how the brave hearts crafted them into art. If your canvas feels a bit tangled and chaotic now, remember you hold the brush. And if you've painted over life's unfair splatters to create something beautiful, reach out and DM us. Let's celebrate the masterpieces we create amidst chaos. #PaintingLife #Resilience #LifeJourney #GritAndGraceStories #MasterpieceInTheMaking #ShareYourStory"
