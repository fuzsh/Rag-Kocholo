        "text": "There's plenty of great upcoming Xbox Series X games to watch for in 2024. From high-octane FPS titles to rollicking action-adventures, upcoming horror games, and the long-awaited Star Wars Outlaws, the litany of new games for 2024 is bound to boast something for everyone.\n\nWhile many of the new Xbox games listed below have been given release dates, there are plenty others we're waiting to hear about as the year unravels. We're talking everything from upcoming Xbox exclusives to cross-platform gems available to PC players via Xbox Game Pass, as well as a host of in-house titles from Xbox Game Studios. Kept in good company by the upcoming Bethesda games and upcoming Ubisoft games on the horizon, it's hard not to get hyped for the exciting year ahead.\n\nWe'll be keeping this list regularly updated as release dates or delays are announced or revealed, but keep reading to find the upcoming Xbox Series X games for 2024 you can't afford to ignore.\n\n2024\n\nVisions of Mana\n\nRelease date: August 29, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nAn all-new entry in the Mana series, Visions of Mana, is on the way from Square Enix. An action-RPG, Visions of Mana follows protagonist Val as he protects his childhood friend that's been chosen as something called \"the Alm of Fire\" and must make their way to the Tree of Mana.

Set between the events of Star Wars: Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws will let us explore planets new and familiar as protagonist Kay Vess. We've since seen a massive gameplay reveal, and now that we have an official release date on the books, it won't be long before we'll be exploring the Outer Rim in this awesome upcoming Star Wars game.\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch Champions\n\nRelease date: September 3, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Unbroken Studios\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nHere's your chance to catch the Golden Snitch for yourself! Blissfully rectifying one of the most glaring Wizarding World absences in Hogwarts Legacy, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is landing on PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC this year, with PS Plus members seemingly playing for free up to September 30. Get ready to grab your broom and take to the skies as a team player and vie for victory against your opponents. Whether you're a cunning Slytherin or wise Ravenclaw, it's time to prove yourself on the pitch once and for all – no protection charms from Snape allowed.\n\nThe Casting of Frank Stone\n\nRelease date: September 3, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nUntil Dawn and The Quarry developer Supermassive Games is making the new narrative game The Casting of Frank Stone, which is made in partnership with Behaviour Interactive and set in the universe of the popular horror multiplayer game Dead by Daylight. In the game, Frank Stone's shadow is said to hang over the town of Cedar Hills, and \"a group of young friends\" explore how that legacy has left long-lasting scars. The good news is that it's coming out just before Halloween as well, so let the spooky times begin!\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n\nRelease date: September 9, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Saber Interactive\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nSaber Interactive is bringing us a new Warhammer 40K action-adventure with Space Marine 2. With the galaxy in peril and worlds falling, you play as a Space Marine who sets out to the help the Imperium against Tyranid hordes. We got our first look at the gameplay for the upcoming entry during the Game Awards 2022,\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio\n\nRelease date: October 11, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Atlus\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nAnother offering from the Persona series developer, Metaphor ReFantazio certainly looks set to offer everything you'd expect from an Atlus game. The anime fantasy RPG is coming later this year, and it's looking like everything a Persona fan could possibly want. With on-screen dialogue and player choice-led branching pathways, you'd be forgiven for not knowing where to look while watching the trailer.\n\nNew World: Aeternum\n\nRelease date: October 15, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Amazon Games\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nA hit PC MMO is getting a console remaster and update in New World: Aeternum. Amazon Games is bringing the dark fantasy action-RPG to Xbox Series X and PS5 this October, and PC players will also be treated to the new-and-improved version that now features a solo play option for those of us less fond of playing well with others. According to the press release, New World: Aeternum boasts \"exciting new features for players on all platforms, including New World’s first-ever large-scale player vs. player zone, a challenging 10-player raid, end-game solo trials, an upgraded leveling experience, new character archetypes, a revamped dialogue system, and much more.\" Sounds good? See you out there on October 15.\n\nSonic x Shadow Generations\n\nRelease date: October 25, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Sonic Team\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nSonic and Shadow are retuning in Shadow x Sonic Generations, an upcoming Xbox game coming to Series X and One. The mischievous hedgehog duo is back and zanier than ever, taking on a host of new platforming, pinball, and racing adventures to keep you buzzing for hours. The release date was announced at Summer Game Fest, meaning it won't be long now until we can jump into the fray for ourselves and see what SEGA's finest has in store for us this time.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nRelease date: October 25, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Treyarch, Raven Software\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThe wait is over, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 marks the first COD game to launch as a Microsoft-owned product. Heading into war has never looked more explosive, dynamic, or frenzied for it, featuring a campaign mode as well as multiplayer and co-op antics to get stuck into when Black Ops 6 launches on Xbox Series X this October. Come on, you don't really need to know much more than that, right?\n\nLife is Strange: Double Exposure\n\nRelease date: October 29, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Deck Nine Games\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nMax Caulfield is reprising her role as muse in Life is Strange: Double Exposure. The brand new narrative adventure sees the heroine from the first game all grown up, but things are not going well for the college student as she is forced to confront a brand new mystery. Max's best friend, Safi, is found dead, and now her dormant powers will come in handy once more. It's safe to say we're chomping at the bit for this upcoming Xbox game, so it's just as well we won't be waiting much longer for it thanks to the October 2024 release date.\n\nSlitterhead\n\nRelease date: November 8, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Bokeh Game Studios\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nThe makers of Silent Hill are bringing us grisly delights in Slitterhead. Bokeh Game Studio showed off more of its gnarly upcoming horror game at Summer Game Fest, as well as a November 8 release date that means we'll get to experience all its grotesque glory just days after Halloween this year. The latest trailer shows busy city streets one moment, heads sprouting tentacles and extra mouths the next. Something about its garish comic book-style artwork is speaking to me already, so this is one to pick up after you finish off Silent Hill 2 remake if you can't get enough messed up Japanese body horror.\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n\nRelease date: November 12, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Quebec\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is going to deliver something that Assassin's Creed fans have been asking after for nearly 15 years – an adventure across Feudal Japan. Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey, is set to make it happen, promising that Assassin's Creed Red will allow us to live out a shinobi fantasy and a samurai one through its dual-protagonists: Yasuke, the first Black samurai, and stealthy shadow Naoe.\n\nAvowed\n\nRelease date: November 12, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Obsidian Entertainment\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nAvowed is a brand new title from Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind The Outer Worlds and Fallout New Vegas. This is another first-person RPG that will no doubt build on the studio's penchant for epic adventures filled with memorable characters and a hint of the silly. We're off to a fantasy world called Eora for this one, and it looks pretty darn impressive, if much darker in tone than we'd usually expect from Obsidian. You've got magical abilities, a really cool sword and you will find yourself facing some seriously big monsters by the looks of things too.\n\nSTALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl\n\nRelease date: November 20, 2024\n\nDeveloper: GSC Game World\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nAfter years of anticipation and delays, developer GSC Game World is finally return to return us to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is one of the year's most exciting first-person shooters, a frightening and fierce adventure where you'll need to use every resource at your disposal to survive challenging encounters with survivors and anomalies alike. The game is set to launch into Game Pass on September 5, 2024.\n\nTBC 2024\n\n33 Immortals\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Thunder Lotus\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\n33 Immortals is a new co-op roguelike experience from Spiritfarer developer Thunder Lotus that, as the name suggests, supports 33-players in match raids. With various builds to choose from, you'll take on the role of damned souls who set out to rebel against God's judgement. The online multiplayer aims to encourage players to collaborate and work together through runs against enemy hordes.\n\nArk 2\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Studio Wildcard\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nArk 2 is the sequel to one of the best survival games ever made, Ark: Survival Evolved. This time around it could be that the game will lean a little more into its story, particularly with Vin Diesel starring and onboard the dev team. Otherwise though, expect more of the same dinosaur taming, surviving but in a bigger, beautiful world than ever before.\n\nClockwork Revolution\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: inXile\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nA brand new upcoming RPG from the Wastelands team, Clockwork Revolution was announced at Xbox Games Showcase 2023. The trailer shows a steampunk-infused world that feels both historical and futuristic, complete with blimps overhead alongside floating steam trains weaving through the cityscape. It looks an awful lot like BioShock: Infinite in more ways than one, but we're still keen to see more from this first-person gunslinging adventure in the coming months.\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nIt's been many moons since we had a fresh trip to Thedas, so the news that Dragon Age 4 is coming is certainly exciting. Now officially called Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we do know that Solas will be returning as the upcoming adventure's antagonist while the likes of Lace Harding and Varric are showing face as companion and supporting character respectively. We finally have a release window that pegs it for an imminent launch later in 2024, so now, it's just a matter of waiting out our next big RPG adventure in Thedas.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Team Cherry\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThe long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's Metroidvania action-adventure is officially coming. Taking on the role of Hornet, the princess, and protector of the Hallownest, we'll get to explore a new haunted kingdom. After being captured, you'll have to fight through enemies and solve mysteries as you set out on a pilgrimage. With the chance to see new lands, use new powers, and more, Hollow Knight: Silksong's appearance during the Xbox and Bethesda showcase confirmed it will be coming to Game Pass.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: MachineGames\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle is a brand new Indiana Jones game set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, in development at MachineGames. Everything we have seen of this new Xbox Series X game looks absoloutely fantastic, with the Wolfenstein studio nailing the essentials: humor, heart, and a lot of whipping/punching/shooting Nazis in locations all around the world. It looks delightful, and we can't wait to learn more.\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Warhorse Studios\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nUpcoming RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 looks set to up the ante when it comes to dynamic first-personal melee action, all set against the backdrop of medieval Europe. Henry is getting back into the saddle as our leading man, out seeking vengeance for his family, only this time he's looking a lot sharper and all the more capable for it thanks to the refined visuals in KCD2.\n\nWarhorse is presenting an experience that looks set to challenge our expectations in every way, from its biting British humor to the weighty first-person combat, meaning this is one upcoming Xbox Series X game worth jotting down. It's not got a first release date yet, but with a ballpark estimate pinning it down for later in 2024, you'll want to keep your eyes peeled for more news soon.\n\nNeva\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Nomada Studio\n\nGame Pass: N/A\n\nFrom the makers of Gris comes Neva, a stunning 2D side-scrolling adventure that blends platforming with a spellbinding narrative of one woman's bond with her wolf. We got a closer look at it during Summer Game Fest 2024, from the lush environments to puzzling platforming moments were teamwork is the name of the game as our heroine Alba has to work in tandem with her four-legged friend, Neva. Story-wise, we're still none the wiser, but this is one upcoming Xbox Series X game that looks worth all the mystery.\n\nReplaced\n\nRelease date: TBC 2024\n\nDeveloper: Sad Cat Studios\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nReplaced is set in a 2.5D sci-fi retro-futuristic world where you play as Reach, an artificial intelligence that's trapped in a human body against its own will. As an action platformer, Sad Cat Studios describes Replaced as an experience that \"combines cinematic platforming, pixel art and free-flow action combat\" that's set in an alternate take on the 1980s.\n\nUnknown 9: Awakening\n\nRelease date: Fall 2024\n\nDeveloper: Reflector Entertainment\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nSpirit-jumping action-adventure game Unknown 9: Awakening is landing on Xbox Series X later in 2024. Summer Game Fest 2024 treated us to a substantial look at its blend of cinematic narrative meets nail-biting third-person combat. With the addition of what looks like the ability to haunt your enemies, Unknown 9: Awakening looks and feels like a blend of the best Assassin's Creed games and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. Only time will tell, and with a ballpark release window slated for Fall 2024, we won't have to wait long to find out for ourselves.\n\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2\n\nRelease date: Fall 2024\n\nDeveloper: The Chinese Room\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nThe original game was a slightly ramshackle but beloved cult classic that was more or less ‘Deus Ex but Vampires’. This takes the same idea but updates it to a modern setting where 'The Masquerade' - the rules by which vampires stay hidden - has been broken upheaving the brittle peace between numerous factions, each with different skills and abilities. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is about crafting a supernatural character whose abilities shape your approach to its open missions - you can fight, sneak, or talk your way through a world of turf wars, subterfuge and political machinations, with you actions affecting everyone around you.\n\nTBC 2025\n\nCivilization 7\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Firaxis Games\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nEight years since the last game, it's good to know that the next installment in the Civilization series is on the way. While our first look was minimal, we do know that Civilization 7 will launch consecutively on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in 2025. The stunning teaser trailer shown at Summer Game Fest 2024 hints at a story of evolution, growth, and the passage of time, so get ready for a return to one of the best 4X games ever come 2025.\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: id Software\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nHave you ever wanted to load a shotgun with human skulls, crush them up, and fire the shards at your enemies? In Doom: The Dark Ages, that'll be more than possible. The new Doom game blew us away at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, showing off its gnarly FPS action in an explosive reveal trailer that has become the stuff of legends already. We'll be keeping an eye on this one as we head into the new year, but for now, it's good to know that 2025 marks the year we'll get our hands on this upcoming Xbox game that launches day-one on Game Pass.\n\nFable 4\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Playground Games\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThe wait for news was more than worth it after Fable started the Xbox Games Showcase 2023 off strong. Fable 4 sees the series' trademark British, tongue-in-cheek humor is returning, and we can't wait already. We've had our first look at the fantastical world of Albion as it stands in the new game, and with Richard Ayoade showing up as a hero-grabbing big boss, it's safe to say Playground looks set to impress us when it launches in 2025.\n\nGTA 6\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Rockstar Games\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nRockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 is coming in 2025, and it's set to bring us back to Vice City. Set in the present day, the latest Grand Theft Auto installment is set to push the boundaries of open world game design, leveraging the power of the Xbox Series X to deliver a crime story led by new protagonist Lucia – a criminal who is trying to survive the chaos of the sunshine state.\n\nLost Records: Bloom & Rage\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Don't Nod\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nThe folks behind Life is Strange are back at it again with Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, the first entry in a new \"Lost Records\" universe for the developer. The teaser doesn't give too much away beyond the fact that it's a \"story-driven journey\" that takes place 27 years after an incredible summer back in 1995 that ultimately leaves them sharing a secret – one seemingly so serious that they've not been in contact with each other since.\n\nMixtape\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Beethoven and Dinosaur\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\n90s tunes, skateboarding, and the ravages of youth. That's the vibe Mixtape wants to encapsulate when it launches in 2025. Set against a soundtrack of veritable bangers, each one unlocking a core memory from the hazy days of youth, Mixtape is one for the nostalgic 80s and 90s kids who still hold their battered old Walkman in the highest regard (as well as the skateboarding scars to prove their mettle). Life is Strange fans, look no further.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nWe've had our first big look at Monster Hunter Wilds, and it's a doozy. This upcoming Xbox Series X game is landing at some point in 2025, and is a brand-new title in the storied franchise. The first trailer hints at larger-than-life foes, hunting parties, unique challenges, and harvesting and upgrading equipment – none of which is terribly surprising.\n\nSouth of Midnight\n\nRelease date: TBC 2025\n\nDeveloper: Compulsion Games\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nA new entry from the We Happy Few developer, South of Midnight is an upcoming Xbox Series X game with an as-yet-unconfirmed release date. It was announced during this year's Xbox Games Showcase, and the creepy art style and web-spinning we've seen from the trailer is enough to have us excited already. This is the first we've heard from Compulsion Games since Microsoft acquired the studio in 2018, so it's definitely one to watch out for.\n\nTBC\n\nAssassin's Creed Hexe\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nAssassin's Creed Codename Hexe is the most mysterious upcoming Assassin's Creed game, with Ubisoft Montreal having only teased a vibe and location. Looking at the first trailer, it would appear that the vibe is super creepy, while the setting is rumored to be 16th Century Europe as it was becoming enveloped in the devastating witch trials. Codename Hexe is in development at Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Ubisoft Montreal, so we're certainly excited to see what the team can come up with this time.\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nAssassin's Creed Infinity isn't a game, per se, but rather the connective tissue that will bring all future flagship Assassin's Creed games together. At least, that's what Ubisoft is teasing. Codename Infinity is said to act as an interactive hub of sorts and, not unlike the Animus itself, it will allow players to connect more seamlessly with all corners of history. We're still waiting for more info on this one, but *we expect it to launch in tandem with Assassin's Creed Shadows.\n\nContraband\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Avalanche Studios\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nFrom the creators of Just Cause comes Contraband. This is a brand new, open-world, co-op game that is set in the fictional world of Bayan during the 1970s. This smugglers paradise is a bit of a mystery at present, as is the core gameplay, so watch out for more details on this upcoming Xbox Series X game.\n\nDune: Awakening\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Funcom\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nDune: Awakening is a new survival MMO set on Arrakis that will see you trying to make it on the harsh, sandy planet alongside thousands of other players. As a massively multiplayer experience with survival elements, you'll be building shelters to weather sandstorms, and trying to avoid sandworms lurking beneath the surface as you hunt down spice.\n\nEverwild\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Rare\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nEverwild is a brand new IP from Rare – the developer behind Sea of Thieves, Banjo-Kazooie, Battletoads, and more – and all we have so far is one trailer. It's filled with colorful and fantastical creatures that interact with humans cautiously in a slightly otherworldly setting. It's not clear yet what kind of game it'll be, but there's clearly a threat from predators in this world too. Whatever form it eventually takes, it's clear that this upcoming Xbox Series X game is going to be a beauty.\n\nGears of War: E-Day\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: The Coalition\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nGears is back, but it's not Gears of War 6 like you might have hoped for. Instead, Gears of War: E-Day is rewinding the clock to give us a prequel of the very first game, featuring plenty of returning faces. The reveal trailer shown at Xbox Games Showcase blew us away, so now, it's just a matter of waiting out for some more intel before we get back into the action with some fan favorites.\n\nJurassic Park: Survival\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Saber Interactive\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nJurassic Park: Survival is a single-player action-adventure game starring Dr. Maya Joshi, an InGen scientist stuck on Isla Nublar. While the island and company will be familiar to fans, the game will feature an original narrative-driven adventure with a mixture of stealth and action in order to evade dinosaurs and survive the dangerous park.\n\nMass Effect 5\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Bioware\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nAfter much praying to the video game gods, there is, in fact, a new Mass Effect game en route. Technically Mass Effect 5, it's looking likely that it will pick up after the events of Mass Effect 3 - if the trailer clues are anything to be believed. Info is scarce right now, but it's all looking very promising indeed for Mass Effect fans.\n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Konami\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nNews of Konami's MGS3 remake caused major hype when Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was announced as part of the PlayStation Showcase 2023. The game is said to be a faithful reimagining of the 2004 action title, and with no platform exclusivity, we can expect to see it on Xbox Series X in the hopefully not-too distant future. There's no confirmed release date as yet, but we're crossing our fingers that it could come as soon as 2024.\n\nMarathon\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Bungie\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nA classic extraction shooter is getting a fresh lick of paint, as Bungie pivots from its Destiny 2 and Halo IPs to revive this 90s gunslinger. The announcement trailer for Marathon shows a litany of brightly-suited characters wielding some impressive weapons, looking not unlike battle royale hero shooters akin to Fortnite or Apex Legends. We don't yet know when the title is expected to launch, but it's one to watch for 2024 and beyond.\n\nOD\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThe long-rumored Xbox game from Hideo Kojima, OD \"explores the concept of testing your fear threshold,\" according to the announcement, as well as \"what it means to OD on fear.\" It's described as a new form of media somewhere between a game and movie, and features popular actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schaffer, and Udo Kier in lead roles. Did we mention Jordan Peele is involved?\n\nPragmata\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nGame Pass: No\n\nPragmata feels like if someone took Kojima's Death Stranding and somehow made it even weirder - especially from this early look at the game. Clearly set in New York, the game sees some sort of spacesuit-wearing traveller looking out for a young girl, and eventually taking her to the moon. Holographic cats, robots, and a weird dystopian vibe run throughout, even suggesting the world the characters are existing in isn't even real. We're intrigued by this one.\n\nProject 007\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nAlthough not much is known about Project 007 yet, it's exciting to think that a brand new James Bond game is in the works. In development at IO Interactive (of Hitman fame), the game is an entirely original James Bond story focused on his origins. Aside from that though, it's a mystery that we can't wait to hear more about.\n\nPerfect Dark\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: The Initiative, Crystal Dynamics\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThis one came as quite the surprise at the Game Awards 2020 - there's a new Perfect Dark game en route from new Xbox Game Studios developer, The Initiative. Rather than another remaster, this is a reboot of the series that keeps the secret agent gameplay and our hero, Joanna Dark, into an eco sci-fi tale set in the near future. Expect plenty of spy gadgets, some gloriously hybrid buildings, and some aliens along the way.\n\nRoutine\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Lunar Software\n\nGame Pass: TBC\n\nRoutine is a brand new survival horror game from developer Lunar Software. If that name sounds familiar, it's because Routine was actually announced a decade ago. The studio announced it, showed a little of its haunting sci-fi world to the public, and then disappeared from the face of the planet. We're happy Routine is back though, because between the low-fi tech you'll need to wield to survive, some genuinely awe-inspiring environments, and hellishly creepy androids, this looks like an unmissable horror game. Routine doesn't have a release window, but it is set to launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Game Pass.\n\nState of Decay 3\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Undead Labs\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nState of Decay is back with the third entry in the zombie survival-horror series. Cleverly called State of Decay 3. Currently in early development, it's looking to bring fans the 'ultimate' zombie survival sim, and from the looks of the first trailer, it's going to brutal. Zombie deers, folks. Zombie deers. Graphically the game looks fantastic, so expect things to be even more gruesome than ever before.\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDeveloper: Obsidian Entertainment\n\nGame Pass: Yes\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2 is a bit of an enigma. While we know it exists and it's had its first trailer, it was more a piss-take of classic game trailer format rather than revealing anything about the game itself. So we'll have to wait for more on this one that will deliver a \"new solar system, new crew, same outer worlds\"."
