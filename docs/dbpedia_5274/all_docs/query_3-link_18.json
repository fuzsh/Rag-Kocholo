        "text": "LEOMINSTER — Sixteen-year-old Nigel O’Neill was inspired to give back by collecting used, unwanted, and broken crayons for The Crayon Initiative, which melts them down, remakes them and distributes them to hospitalized children.\n\nHis crayon collection box will be in the Martin T. Feldman Children’s Room at the Leominster Public Library through Oct. 31. The Leominster High School junior said he was inspired to do the good deed because of his Aunt Erin Benoit, an art teacher at the Applewild School Devens campus.\n\n“She began collecting crayons at her school and she had an extra collection box, so that’s where I got the idea to start participating with the initiative,” Nigel said.\n\nHe began collecting crayons over the summer at the Little Bee Bookshop in Ayer, where his mother sells items from her small business.\n\n“I got a great response and collected over 10 pounds of broken and unwanted crayons,” Nigel said of the bookshop collection. “I thought Leominster library would be a great collection spot, so I contacted one of the librarians and they agreed to keep a collection box in the children’s room until the end of October. I’ve already picked up several bags and boxes from the library and was told by the librarians that it’s been very well received by the community.”\n\nAccording to The Crayon Initiative, millions of pounds of crayons are discarded every year, resulting in a waxy sludge that clogs landfills and never biodegrades. Nonprofit organization founder Bryan Ware came up with the idea that discarded and broken crayons could be put to good use and went about figuring out how to melt them down and create new crayons.\n\nAfter consulting an occupational therapist, Ware gave the new crayons a unique design – large and three sided, not round – so they are easy for kids to grip and can’t roll off hospital trays. The organization is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and currently sends free crayons to over 240 children’s hospitals across the U.S.\n\nNigel said he’s happy to be a part of reducing waste and upcycling — and that “it feels great to know that so many people care about the initiative and are willing to donate to the cause.”\n\n“I like how the crayons I’ve collected aren’t going to landfills but are going to kids who are hospitalized instead,” he said. “I’m so happy with how it’s been going, and I look forward to seeing how many more crayons I can get by the end of the month.”"
