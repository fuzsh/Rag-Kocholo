This is a great time to take a moment to consider what your environmental footprint is, and perhaps even do a little activity like this DIY Earth Day Crayon Craft with your kids. Today I’m sharing a fun free printable and craft for you to do with your kids to celebrate Earth Day.\n\nDIY Earth Day Crayon Craft\n\nOne of the big messages of environmental responsibility has always been to reduce, reuse, recycle, so my activity goes along with that slogan. We’re going to make some earth day crayons from old broken blue and green crayons, then place them on a cute printable that is perfect for giving as a classroom gift or for friends.\n\nDIY Earth Day Crayon Craft Tips\n\nMuffin Baking Pan – I purchased a muffin tin for $5 so I wouldn’t have to use our food-use one. It’s up to you what you want to do. I really wanted the clean smooth edges which is why I purchased the tin. I’ve heard before that you can line the tin cups with foil, but I worried about whether the foil would get bent into the crayons. It was worth $5 to have a dedicated crayon-making tin. If you use a silicone one, the crayons will pop right out.\n\nCrayons (Blues and Greens) The idea is to use up old crayons, but if you’re wanting to make this craft and you don’t have enough old crayons, then you can purchase sets of green or blue crayons.\n\nOven\n\nStart off by collecting as many blue and green crayons as you can, then remove all the paper wrapping from them. It works best if you have a variety of blues and greens, not all the same color. You’re going to break them up into small pieces, about 3/4″ pieces.\n\nMelt in the oven – complete directions below on the How-To Card, which you can print off like a recipe card.\n\nAllow cooling for about an hour.\n\nPlace in the freezer to help the wax contract, which allows for easy removal.\n\nHow to Make Earth Day Crayons\n\nYield: 12\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nActive Time: 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 25 minutes\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nEasy Earth Day Activity for Kids\n\nMaterials\n\nGreen and Blue Crayon bits\n\nWhite Cardstock\n\nMuffin Tin - an old one.\n\nTools\n\nScissors\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat your oven to 280 degrees.\n\nRemove any paper from crayon bits.\n\nAdd your crayon pieces to the tins, I put around 15-20 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces in each cup. The more you put in, the thicker the final crayon will be which will help prevent breaking.\n\nBake for 10-12 minutes.\n\nCarefully remove from oven and allow to cool for about an hour.\n\nPlace in the freezer for about an hour. This will help contract the wax from the sides of the tin and the crayons will pop out. Just be sure you are careful or they could break when you flip them over to drop out. Perhaps you’ll want to use a cookie sheet on top of the tin when you flip it, so the crayons only just drop out.\n\nAllow them to rest for a couple of minutes then use a towel (paper towel or old towel in case of crayon marks) to remove condensation from the crayon.\n\nAffix them with some tape to this cute Earth Day printable, and you’ve created a fun craft while also reusing something old!\n\nNotes\n\nEarth Day Printable has been updated to reflect no date so they can be used year after year.\n\nDid you make this project?\n\nPlease leave a comment on the blog or share a photo on Instagram\n\nHow to Print Earth Day Crayon Printable\n\nYou’ll need:\n\nInkjet printer\n\nWhite Cardstock\n\nEarth Day Printable – Find it here!\n\nDownload Undated Earth Day Printable Here.\n\nHope you enjoy this fun Earth Day craft and that it helps you teach and remind your kids to be kind to our environment!\n\nFor more family fun, check out my posts about Campfire Conversation Starters, School Lunch Ideas, and my Big Hero 6 Family Night Dinner.
