        "text": "I wouldn't say Olivia is now destined to be a scientist or great inventor, but I know she had fun on her first visit to Toddler Time at the Museum of Science and Industry, better known as MOSI.\n\nAt first I thought MOSI was more of a place for school-age children, but now I wish I had started taking my 14-month-old even earlier. It's not just the museum that we enjoyed; it was the special programs for newborns through preschoolers.\n\nToddler Time, for ages 1 and 2, is offered every Monday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. It features a weekly craft or activity that's linked to science, although pretty loosely.\n\nOne week it may be finger painting with \"lava\" and another it's making toy telephones out of empty frozen orange juice containers. The program gained steam in October, after Minute Maid awarded a $50,000 grant to MOSI to finance more early childhood development programs.\n\n\"Children participating in these programs are more socially developed,\" said Maxine Duke, who plans early childhood education. \"Skill levels are being enhanced in all areas _ motor skills, social skills, color recognition.\"\n\nMOSI also offers Little Explorers, a program broken down into two classes _ one for 3-year-olds and young 4-year-olds and another for older 4-year-olds and 5-year-olds. It's offered on Monday and Tuesday mornings at various times depending on the age group.\n\nLittle Explorers get more of a lesson than the younger toddlers. Instead of finger painting with lava, they might actually make a volcano out of clay. On \"edible earth works\" day they made dirt pudding with Oreos and Gummi Worms. For their \"lots of layers\" class they poured various colors of sand into a glass bottle to make a layered work of art.\n\n\"You have to bring it down to a more simplistic level, but you'd be amazed what these 3- and 4-year-olds understand,\" Duke said. \"For the 1-year-olds it's more basic things, like sight recognition, terms and learning that lava is red.\"\n\nMOSI also features a Kids In Charge Club every Friday for newborns through 5-year-olds and their favorite adult. From 11 to 11:30 a.m. they explore science through singing, dancing, storytelling and crafts.\n\nBecause February was dubbed Inventors Month on the day we went to Toddler Time, the children were learning about crayons and how they're made.\n\nFirst we colored then painted over drawings to see how the crayon texture shows through. Then we made a \"crayon cookie\" by breaking crayons, peeling the paper off and collecting the colored remnants in a cut-off frozen orange juice container. (No coincidence that it was Minute Maid.) Our activity coordinator baked the concoction for about seven minutes then cooled it for 20, and we ended up with a multicolored cookie-shaped crayon.\n\nOur 2{-year-old friend, Jacob, who joined us at Toddler Time, loved the activities. He proudly displayed his painting and excitedly broke and peeled the crayons for his crayon cookie.\n\nOlivia enjoyed the coloring but spent more energy trying to eat the broken crayons. But fortunately the program takes place in the Kids In Charge Gallery, which offers plenty of entertainment when the children want to take a break from their crafts.\n\nOn her first trip around the room, Olivia barely stayed at anything more than 10 seconds because there was so much to explore.\n\nThere's a miniature space shuttle, a wooden car and a paddle boat. The little kitchen is complete with plates and plastic food, and the wooden trees have peepholes in the trunks. One corner of the room, covered with mats, has plenty of books and 20 different bins full of things a child can stack, roll, link, touch or squeeze.\n\nIn the two hours we visited, there were as few as three children and as many as 12. But it seemed Olivia and Jacob always had plenty of room to play or make their crafts.\n\nJacob's mom, Heather Henderson, said she got ideas for other crafts _ like making scratch-and-sniff cards with food coloring and crayons _ to try at home.\n\n\"I would definitely come again,\" said Pam Cazes, who lives in Hunter's Green and brought her 22-month-old son Brett to Toddler Time. \"I think it's very age appropriate. I like that they can do their own individual project, and it's a good way for parents to be involved in something their children make.\"\n\nWhether it's an economical way to spend a morning depends on if you're a member of MOSI. Members get into Toddler Time for free. They pay $20 a month or $6 a week for Little Explorers and $2 per visit for the Kids in Charge Club.\n\nNon-members pay $25 a month or $8 a week for Little Explorers but have to pay full admission ($8 for adults, $5 for children) for Toddler Time and admission plus $2 for the Kids in Charge Club.\n\nA family membership costs $50 and offers unlimited free admission, five free tickets to the MOSIMax theater and discounted tickets after those five are used up."
