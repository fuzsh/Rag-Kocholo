        "text": "First the stuntman John Bernecker died in July after a fall on the set of “The Walking Dead” in Atlanta. Then two weeks ago, Joi Harris died during a motorcycle stunt while filming “Deadpool 2” in Vancouver, British Columbia. Two days later, Paramount Studios announced it had halted filming of “Mission Impossible 6” because Tom Cruise had broken his ankle during a stunt.\n\nThe rash of accidents has made manifest the dangers of stunt work. But there have been few successful pushes over the years to further regulate the workplaces of stunt professionals, who, like circus acrobats, build careers atop a good measure of calculated risk.\n\n“People imagine, ‘Oh well, they get hurt and that’s what they signed up for,’ which is an absurd presumption,” said Andy Armstrong, a stunt coordinator involved in two of “The Amazing Spider-Man” movies. “You’d be surprised by how lax all the rules about these things are.”\n\nUnlike the rules that govern mining and construction, there are no specific federal regulations for many professions like stunt work, just the more general rules that protect all employees from hazards. Few states have regulations specific to the industry, though California, with its history of moviemaking, does prescribe what is allowed in stunts involving helicopters and explosives, for example.\n\nAnyone who questions whether stunt work deserves a more focused set of rules enters a debate, ongoing for years, between those who say not enough has been done to protect workers and those who say they do not see any need for further intervention.\n\n“The regulations cover the majority of hazards I’m aware of,” said Eric Berg, deputy chief of research and standards for the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. He said that the standards covering workplace hazards across a wide range of industries are sufficient for the film industry.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
