        "text": "This research engages a combined qualitative methodology of arts-informed research and critical descriptive ethnography to study thirteen adolescent artists with autism as they engage in art making across multiple art education contexts. This study revealed the perceptions of stakeholders about art and autism that informed the access these adolescent artists had to art education and art materials. These perceptions included varying ideas of competence, ability and struggle associated with an identity as 'autistic'. In the examination of these adolescents' experiences the engagement with art making and the role of art in the lives of these artists is explored. It is shown that art functions as communication and a way of connecting to the world around them, acting as a form of literacy through the visual text of their artwork. This study offers a paradigm for inclusive art education that operates within the social model of dis/ability and considers strategies for full inclusion with art curriculum and art materials. Recommendations for families, art teachers of students with autism and art teacher preparation are provided.\n\nThis paper aims to explore art therapy methods that are able to become one of the complementary media to improve the communication skills of children with autism; explain concretely the contribution of art flexibility as a complementary media in communication therapy for autistic children; and explain the integration of the principles of therapy. These three topics will be explored using a number of theories about art therapy that have developed, as research beginning on the development of methods of art therapy and art education for autistic children. The approach in this study uses the method of content analysis of the phenomenon of art therapy, which is implemented as a perspective to see the phenomenon of art education for autism in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2019. This study begins with a study of the development and patterns of art therapy which has been going on in Indonesia. Afterward, the current foothold of art therapy will be known, and able to explain the reasons related t...\n\nCan we see art differently? Can others see and experience art as autistic, or non-neurotypical artists do? An autistic, Richard Boswell is someone who thinks and sees differently, navigating through environments that inundates his senses with pictures, sounds, and people that forces him to interpret data his mind isn’t wired for. Boswell’s brain turns these encounters into patterns, repetitions and layers of interactions that are realigned along lines of information and detail he experiences as art. As visual artist, Boswell relies on these intangible phenomena to guide him in translating a non-verbal language to a visual language. In his process of art making, the origins of memory and the material Boswell uses briefly suspend familiarity, the experience is peripatetic.\n\nThe subproject \" The Artistic Creation Process in the Development of Person with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\" stems from a larger project entitled \"Teacher Training: The Importance of Art Education in the Development of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\" The former project explored how art contributes to the development of individuals with ASD through evidence-based research. With a focus on action research, similar workshops were proposed for two children with ASD, resulting in two case studies. The workshops were formulated with practices in the field of visual arts, using the Reggio Emilia methodology to provide a space for valuing the creative process. The research highlights how the creative process is fundamental to the acceptance of differences in an individual's identity. Building on the theories of philosopher Gilles Deleuze and contributions from art educator Fayga Ostrower, knowledge from the workshop experiences was explored, with the aim of restructuring an educational vision of how the creative process and artistic knowledge contribute to valuing and respecting differences within education.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate how nature-inspired art education might foster a sense of connectedness and collaboration in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (hereinafter knows as ASD) in a day program. While many studies have uncovered such beneficial art education for children with ASD, there has been little research attempted for adults with ASD. Through a single instrumental case study the participatory researcher, an art educator in a day program for adults with ASD, explores the impact of a unit of nature-inspired collaborative art making on both the participants in the day program and on their paraprofessionals. Of particular interest to the researcher is if time spent in the natural world creating art could decrease the challenging behaviors, anxiety, and stress levels of adults with ASD through assisting them to experience a connection with nature. Also addressed in this research is how this experience could simultaneously increase a connection with others ...\n\nBackground: Art therapy with an autistic person with learning disabilities: communication and emotional regulation. Context: This study focuses on a six-week art therapy programme with an autistic adult, who also has a learning disability, anxiety, and sensory processing disorder. Can art therapy be an effective therapeutic modality to help them develop their communication and emotional regulation abilities? Approach: A single-case study approach was used and contextualised using the 'Interactive Square approach' introduced by Bragge and Fenner ([2009]. The emergence of the 'interactive square' as an approach to art therapy with children on the autistic spectrum. International Journal of Art Therapy, 14(1), 17-28.). An open-ended interview was conducted and utilised an arts-based narrative inquiry to code the data from the interview. Using Lieblich et al. ([1998]. Narrative research: Reading, analysis, and interpretation. Sage Publications, Inc.) model of narrative analysis. Outcomes: The study found that art therapy could contribute to the development of communication skills for the client and assist with emotional regulation strategies. While humour and the spontaneous element of the art materials also had a beneficial impact. Conclusions: Art Therapy can thus reduce the need for avoidant coping strategies and cognitive suppression, which lead to increased anxiety and externalising behaviour. Implications for Research: These findings highlight important conclusions, and more art therapy research with autistic people with learning disabilities is warranted. Plain-language summary This article examines the initial impact of art therapy with an adult diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study investigated whether art therapy could be an effective way of helping that person with communication and managing their emotions. The first part of the research was to gather data from the art therapy sessions. Based on the interactive square analysis method introduced by Bragge and Fenner ([2009]. The emergence of the 'interactive square' as an approach to art therapy with children on the autistic spectrum. International Journal of Art Therapy, 14(1), 17-28.). The second part of the research was to hold an audio interview with the client and analyse the recording using Liebmann's ([2008]. Art therapy and anger. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.) model of narrative analysis. The findings found that art therapy contributed to the development of communication skills. The sensory qualities of the art materials encouraged communication. Art therapy could help a person to understand and manage their emotions. This study highlights important conclusions that can help autistic people with learning disabilities."
