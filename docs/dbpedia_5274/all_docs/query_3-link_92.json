        "text": "Born to Invent Games :-)\n\nBulent always loved to play games he created on his own. On the left hand side you can see him playing as an American Indian in early 1980's.\n\nAfter he became literate, he designed his first games. Those games were very simple, like Space Trip game. He drew circles with the help of a coin and write some notices in those circles, like \"Your spacecraft has been broken, draw 6 or return to the beginning.\" :-)\n\nLater, he designed lots of games such as European War, Houseworks, Athletics and played with his family members.\n\nAfter he became a grown-up, he decided to share his games more than his family members and founded Crayon Games.\n\nNowadays, he is a really busy man. He studies Ph.D. in Istanbul Technical University on \"Scenario Planning\". He works as Marketing Manager in Turkey's largest retailer Migros-Turk. Also he follows every football match of Fenerbahce Istanbul. And usually, he hosts his friends and play board games for hours.\n\nÂ© 2006 Bulent Dolek"
