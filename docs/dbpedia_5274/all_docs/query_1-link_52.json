        "text": "A\n\nabstract\n\nadj. Generally means simplified instead of detailed. In the context of games, it is an overloaded term which usually means \"without theme or story\" or \"not highly detailed; simple, elegant rules without lots of chrome\" but \"abstract\" also sometimes used to mean \"pure strategy (no randomness)\" Often used as opposite of thematic. See the term abstract strategy game and article Abstract Strategy.\n\nabstract strategy game\n\nn.\n\n1) A game generally limited to two players and perfect information (i.e. no randomness) often with incidental or irrelevant theme. (Chess does have a theme, but it can be ignored. A bishop is just the name of a piece that moves diagonally.)\n\n2) A game with no theme.\n\naccessory\n\n(BGG usage) Accessories are items that are used in games, but do not add rules or change game play. For example, a collection of upgraded components is an accessory. An accessory must be specific to a game to receive an entry. Accessories not specific to a game can be found in Miscellaneous Game Accessory, Miscellaneous Card Game Accessory, and Miscellaneous Miniatures Game Accessory.\n\nacting game\n\nn. A game where players must represent another/perform theatrically.\n\naction point allowance system\n\nPlayers get a certain number of action points each turn to spend on executing actions of their choosing, where actions have varying action point costs.\n\naction selection\n\nA game mechanic where a player selects an action to perform from a menu (possibly changing) of possible choices.\n\nalpha player\n\nAlso called, \"Quarterbacking\" and \"leader effect.\" In a derogatory sense, it is where one player tends to take the lead and may boss others around, telling them how to play. This has been a common complaint to Cooperative games in general. In a positive sense, it can also refer to a true leader who would listen to the group and guide them to consensus, share insights, teach others to see the angles and develop a team mentality.\n\nAmeritrash\n\nn. A catchphrase for \"American style boardgames\". In general, this means games that emphasize a highly developed theme, player to player conflict, and usually feature a moderate to high level of luck. Examples of classic Ameritrash games include Axis & Allies, Dune, Cosmic Encounter, Talisman, and Twilight Imperium. See the Ameritrash page for more information.\n\nanalysis paralysis (AP)\n\nn. When overanalysis and mini/maxing increase the downtime in a game beyond a desirable level. Sometimes abbreviated as ap in the forums. (See also overanalyze)\n\narea control game\n\nn.

A game that features players bidding on resources as the main mechanism. Also called a bidding game. Examples: Modern Art, Ra\n\nB\n\nBBG\n\nn. A common error made when referring to this website BoardGameGeek - should be BGG.\n\nbalance\n\n1. n. The way in which elements of a game are equalized relative to each player. Often balance is established by giving all players similar starting positions and maintained by using mechanisms to hurt the apparent leader or help the likely loser.\n\n2. n. The state of a game where equally skilled players have a roughly equal chance of winning the game regardless of starting position, turn order, etc. Does not imply equality between the sides--a game like Ogre, where one side has a single huge tank vs. a side with many small ones can be considered balanced if both sides have an equal chance of winning.\n\n3. v. To modify the opening setup of a game in order to create a more equal starting position. Bidding for sides and the pie rule are common ways of balancing a game.\n\nbeer & pretzels game\n\nn. A game so random that long-term strategies are nearly impossible, and with such a goofy theme that it is played as a humorous diversion rather than a real competition. Frequently these games feature several mechanisms that can interact with each other in surprising ways. Wiz-War is an example of a beer & pretzels game. (See also light)\n\nbetting\n\nRisking valuables (usually currency) in the hopes of winning more, based on the terms of the bet. This game mechanism generally increases the air of tension in a game, and is often employed for precisely that reason.\n\nBGG\n\nn. A short form used when referring to this website BoardGameGeek. The short URL for BoardGameGeek is bgg.cc.\n\nBGG Patron\n\nn. See patron.\n\nbidding game\n\nn. See auction game.\n\nbits\n\nn. The assorted components used to play a game.

This promotes \"fog of war\" as the identities/strength of each unit in concealed. Typically, blocks are also rotated to show their current strength on the top edge allowing an elegant method of \"step losses\". Columbia Games publishes most of their wargames as block games--though other companies are starting produce them. Well-known block wargames are Napoleon, Hammer of the Scots, East Front (and expansions).\n\nbluff\n\nv. To give a false impression of the value of hidden items in one's possession (such as cards) or one's intentions. This can either be explicitly by direct statement or implicitly through actions in the game. Poker is the best known bluffing game.\n\nBPA\n\nn. Abbreviation for Boardgame Players Association (see http://www.boardgamers.org).\n\nbroken\n\nadj. (usually applied to a game) Having problems that result in a disappointing play experience.

See http://www.brettspielwelt.info\n\nC\n\ncard drafting\n\nn. a game mechanic where the primary way players acquire cards is by selecting them from a face up display. Designer Alan R. Moon has designed many games using this mechanic. Examples: Union Pacific, Freight Train, Ticket to Ride, Alhambra, Thurn and Taxis\n\nn. a game mechanism where players select cards from a subset of the available cards to form a deck or hand or to select the next card to play. Examples: Fairy Tale, 7 Wonders, and Agricola (variant), where a hand of cards is passed around and players select individual cards before passing the cards remaining in the hand. Magic: The Gathering (multiple variants) and Race for the Galaxy (variant) where players draft cards to form decks that they then use to play the game.\n\nCCG\n\nn. Abbreviation for Collectible Card Game. This type of game uses a basic rule structure and a large assortment of cards which each have characteristics that contradict or supplement the basic rules. Each player selects a number of cards that they own to create a deck which they use in the game. This allows players to predetermine their strategies. The game rules define how many cards must be used and how many copies of each single card are allowed. Cards are sold in \"booster packs\". Packs contain a fixed number of cards and usually include one \"rare\" card, some \"uncommon\" cards, and the bulk of the pack contains \"common\" cards. Rare cards are generally more powerful or efficient than uncommons or commons, which can lead to the problem that the person who has spent the most money on cards wins. The original collectible card game was Magic: The Gathering. Its incredible success spawned dozens of copycat games. Some were good; many were awful. Other examples are Middle-earth, Pokemon and Netrunner\n\nCDG\n\n1. n. Abbreviation for Card Driven Game, typically in reference to wargames that use cards to drive the action.\n\n2: n. Many wargamers restrict the use of the term to games that in the family of games that specifically, the cards are for one of following:\n\n- Operation Points for generic actions like activating units for movement/combat, adding reinforcement units or exerting political control of a region, etc.\n\n- Event (usually represent a specific historic event).\n\nExamples: We the People, Hannibal, Paths of Glory, and Twilight Struggle.\n\n3. n. Abbreviation for Collectible Dice Game. For examples, see Geeklist - Collectible Dice Games. See also, Collectible Card Game.\n\nchit / counter\n\nn. Small, usually square piece of cardboard that represents a unit or a game element. Commonly found in wargames. The terms chit and counter are often used interchangably.\n\nchrome\n\nn. A superfluous mechanism or components added to a game to add a feeling of theme. Like the chrome on a car--chrome really isn't necessary, but it may make the game more fun. Example: In WW2 infantry game, adding rules to cover the exceptional heroics of Audie Murphy.\n\ncloser\n\nn. A game with very simple rules and strategies that does not require deep thought and can be used at the end of a gaming session, when everyone’s brain is worn out. (See also light)\n\nCOIN\n\nn. Refers to the Series: COIN (GMT).\n\ncollectible game\n\nn. a game where the pieces (usually cards or miniatures) are sold in randomly sorted packages. The purchaser usually does not know which cards/miniatures they are buying. Since each player will usually have a different selection of cards/miniatures, in theory, the players should face interesting strategic challenges and find it interesting to trade with other players. In practice, the game takes over often the player with the most toys wins.\n\ncomputational\n\nadj. Overtly using mathematics to determine victory conditions. (See also dry)\n\ncooperative games\n\nGames where all players work together on the same team, trying to beat the built-in artificial intelligence of the game system.

Abbreviation for Combat Result Table. Common wargame term. A table that summarizes various possible results of a combat taking into account attack strength (often as a ratio of attack value/defense value) in a each column of the table and the possible values of a di(c)e roll in each row of the table.\n\nD\n\nD6\n\nn. Common abbreviation for 'six-sided die'. Similarly D8 refers to 'eight-sided die'. d10, d12, and d20 are also common terms. A pair of six-sided dice is sometimes called 2D6. These abbreviations are most common in RPGs and wargames.\n\ndeck building game\n\nn. a game featuring a mechanism where players each play from their own deck of cards but, through the course of the game, additional cards are selected for inclusion in the players' decks which will be drawn and used in future reshuffles of the deck. Often these games require players to discard their hand each turn forcing a high rate of card turnover. The founding father of this genre is Dominion with many examples following including Puzzle Strike, Nightfall, A Few Acres of Snow, and Thunderstone.\n\ndesigner game\n\nn. synonym for German game This term emphasizes the credit usually given to designers of such games, unlike mass-market games which usually credit only the publisher.\n\ndexterity game\n\nn.

Dice is the plural form. Example: One die is used in Ludo, while two dice are used in Parcheesi.\n\ndice-fest\n\nn. 1. A game that uses a whole bunch of dice to determine game outcomes. 2. A game that has a very random nature because of die results.\n\ndice drafting\n\nn. A game mechanism where players acquire dice by selecting them from a common visible pool. This mechanism is similar to card drafting, except that the dice pool is usually reset each round. Examples include Troyes, La Granja, and Castle Dice. Dice drafting is distinct from dice bag building games in which players buy dice to build a personal dice pool.\n\ndice game\n\nA dice game is a game where rolling dice is a primary feature. Examples of dice games include Can't Stop, Excape, and Sharp Shooters. Merely because a game has dice does not make it a dice game, the game must have its primary focus on rolling the dice for game-play.\n\ndice rolling\n\nDice rolling is a mechanism for a wide variety of games. In games that feature dice rolling, one to many dice are rolled and used in a variety of ways, including determining movement, determining results from a combat table, or for compared against other die rolls as combat strength. Merely because a game has die rolling does not make it a dice game.\n\ndowntime\n\nn. The time that a player spends doing nothing while waiting for other players to complete their turns. (See also player interaction)\n\ndungeon crawl\n\nA type of scenario in fantasy role-playing games in which heroes navigate a labyrinthine environment, battling various monsters, and looting any treasure they may find.

A person that likes to spend most of his or her free time playing games.\n\ngamers' game\n\nn. The phrase \"gamers' game\" refers to games which are heavier, more mathematical, or otherwise less accessible (longer, more fiddly, more rules) than standard games. This designation has gained use with the rise of Euro Games as a way to differentiate heavier, longer titles from the normally family friendly, lighter games of that school. While the qualifications for this designation are contentious, a few relatively safe examples are: Die Macher, Roads & Boats, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons, The Republic of Rome and Dune.\n\nn. ‘gamer’s game’ is any game that demonstrates an elongated learning and experience curve, requiring multiple plays for the acquisition of strategic and/or tactical efficiency.\n\ngamey\n\nadj.

Good example are:\n\n\"factor counting\" where an attacking player will move his units to avoid wasting attack points on unfavorable attacks (Moving a stronger unit in to get a 15:5 (or 3:1 ratio) rather than 14:5 (which rounds down to 2:1)\n\n\"soaking off losses\" where a defender, if he can choose which units will take losses/be eliminated, will pair off a strong unit with weak ones, so the weak ones will \"take the hit\" so the strong unit can survive and remain at full strength.\n\ngateway game\n\nn. A game with simple rules that are easy to teach non-gamers in order to attract new players into boardgaming as a hobby.\n\nGBG\n\nn.

(Wings of War (even without physical miniatures) is a good example--the maneuver cards are used to measure the movement of each plane.\n\nmultiplayer game\n\nn. A game with 3 or more players. Used in this sense mainly because there are fundamental differences between 2 player games and games that use 3 or more (diplomatic elements, choosing whom to attack or interfere with, kingmaking, ganging up on the leader, etc.) and is less cumbersome than \"3 or more player games\"\n\nO\n\nOLGS\n\nn.

If it is too poor, and the first player will be at a disadvantage. Called the \"pie rule\" because it is analogous to \"You cut, I choose\" method of splitting a pie between siblings.\n\nplayer interaction\n\nn.
