        "text": "Teaching Shapes in Preschool\n\nPRESCHOOL MATCHING SHAPES ACTIVITIES\n\nLearning the names of shapes helps form a healthy foundation in geometry. As children learn to name the shapes, they can begin to describe them using important math vocabulary.\n\nPreschool learners need lots of opportunities to explore shapes in order to become comfortable recognizing and naming them. They should spend time making shape crafts for kids, identifying shapes around them, playing with blocks, and making patterns with shapes.\n\nChildren should be exposed to important math vocabulary while learning shape names and discussing shape properties:\n\nSide\n\nCorner/vertice\n\nCurved\n\nStraight\n\nSymmetry\n\nEven if students do not use the vocabulary themselves, hearing adults talk about shapes using the correct vocabulary will help them as they mature.\n\nCrayon Shape Matching Cards Printable Game\n\nPrepping the Match the Shapes Printable Activity\n\nPrint the match the shapes for preschool game on the white side of the scrapbook paper (or on card stock).\n\nCut the shapes apart.\n\nI like to laminate matching games to extend their life, and to prevent them from bending and ripping. This is optional, though!\n\nPlaying The Shape Matching Game\n\nThere are different ways to play this back-to-school theme preschool game!\n\nClassic Memory Match: Turn over two cards at the same time. If they match, you get to keep them and turn over another set of crayons to try again. If they don’t match, you turn them back over in their original spot and play continues with the next player. Play continues until the crayon box cards have all been matched with a shape card.\n\nShapes Sort: When students have mastered the names of all the shapes, you can use the cards to sort shapes by characteristics.\n\nCurved lines vs. straight lines\n\nSpecific number of sides or corners\n\nFind blocks to match each shape card\n\nMatching: Some students aren’t ready to match by memory. However, you can provide the shapes cards face-up for students to match with a crayon box card.\n\nMore Crayon-Themed School Activities\n\nYou don’t have to stop at shapes! Consider incorporating a first-day-of-school theme into your lesson plans for the entire fall season! Here are some crayon crafts and activities to get you started.\n\nExtend the Activity:\n\nCrayon Resist\n\nGive children a specific shape(s) to color thoroughly, then explore the magic of watercolors as they resist the wax of the crayon.\n\nMelted Crayon Art\n\nUse old bits and pieces of crayons from yesteryear. Place them in muffin tins to melt into multicolored “crayon cookies.” Crayon shavings melt nicely between two pieces of waxed paper. You can place a cutout shape on top as a seasonal craft (leaves, Christmas stockings, candy cane, turkey, pumpkin, etc.)\n\nCrayon Sorting and Counting\n\nCrayon sorting and counting: Use those fresh crayons to sort by color, or to count into groups of numbers 1-10.\n\nTry These School Theme Activities Next\n\nFree School Theme Missing Numbers Task Cards\n\nPrintable School Scavenger Hunts\n\nBack to School Theme Printable Number Posters\n\nMore Hands-On Shape Ideas\n\nYou’ll love these shape resources as well"
