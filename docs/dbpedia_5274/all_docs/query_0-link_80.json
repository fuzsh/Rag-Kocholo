        "text": "The whole point behind the teamwork-building activities is to ensure that the whole team heads unite in the same direction, work together, and get to know each other better. There are also many fun team-building activities and games, like Quizbreaker or Murder Mystery on the Train.\n\nWhat are team building activities?\n\nAccording to Indeed, âTeam building is defined as the process of using daily interactions, activities, and exercises to organize a group of people into a cooperative and cohesive group.â\n\nThe main goal of team building is solidifying work and personal relationships among employees through activities such as games, meetings, or events.\n\nThrough team building, companies can provide employees with a stress-free environment to improve communication, boost motivation, and improve individual and team skills.\n\nWeâll cut to the chase and trial run these 40+ games and activities for you and your team. Then, weâll cover why these social and fun activities are useful to foster team bonding.\n\nA. 17 Activities for remote teams\n\nThis chapter will focus on team-building activities that can be done remotely.\n\nCurrently, most people work remotely, and according to Gomada:\n\nOver 80% of employers and employees believe creating a sense of community at work is essential.\n\nEmployees think that team-building activities can improve the remote work experience.\n\n52% of workers think company culture is as essential in remote work as in the office.\n\n78% of people are looking for a more supportive work culture.\n\nOnly 33% of companies hold simple team-building activities such as virtual coffee and tea breaks.\n\n41% of workers find adapting to the companyâs culture hard during remote work.\n\nEvery company could benefit from implementing remote team-building activities.\n\nThis chapter will provide a comprehensive guide to remote team-building activities, helping you to identify and select the ones best suited for your team.\n\nWeâve chosen to categorize each activity and showcase the following:\n\nThe type of activity\n\nIts main focus\n\nThe time needed to pursue this activity\n\nThe medium you need (indoors/outdoors)\n\nThe tools youâll need\n\nWhen itâs best to do this activity\n\nWhether itâs free or paid\n\nWe have created a table that summarizes each activity. Further details about each activity will be presented in the second part of this chapter.\n\nIce breaker activities\n\nWhen working online, it is common to experience delays due to technical issues or participants being late. To make the most of this idle time, using icebreakers to engage your team and create a positive atmosphere before moving on to more complex activities is helpful.\n\n1. Opening questions\n\nWhy: it loosens up the atmosphere and helps the team catch up on each otherâs lives\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 5 minutes\n\nWeâre starting with the most obvious one on purpose. Not because itâs a no-brainer but because how you start a meeting sets the tone for how it unfolds.\n\nSo, allow your team to make small talk here and there, as this loosens up the atmosphere and helps them catch up on each otherâs livesâsomething thatâs a given in an office but not in a remote environment.\n\nKeep it casual and do it right after you enter the video conference. Or, lay out a few organized questions in a collaboration tool as reference points. Here are our favorites:\n\nWhat was the last dish you cooked?\n\nWhat new excellent TV series/anime/films have you discovered over the weekend?\n\nHave you been on a trip lately? If yes, where and how was it?\n\nThis activity is a quick and fun way for your team to bond before a meeting. Use this time to relax to focus on the work discussion afterward entirely.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nBonding\n\nFree\n\nEasy to implement\n\nGood destresser\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nTime-restricted\n\nIt might get repetitive if done constantly\n\nIt might not include everyone equally\n\n2. Online riddle\n\nWhy: it boosts team focus\n\nYouâll need: Slack, Paymo, riddles\n\nTime: 10-15 minutes\n\nItâs important to remember that not everyone who attends meetings is fully energized. Some may have just woken up, others may be struggling with their kids, and some might still be thinking about their next task.\n\nBring everyoneâs focus to the meeting with riddles. Find them on your own, or go to Riddles.com for examples and inspiration (they come with answers). When youâve found one, log in to a work management platform like Paymo and discuss with your team to see who can crack it first.\n\nThis simple exercise kicks our brain gears, ensuring weâre giving our undivided attention to whatâs next.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nBonding\n\nFree\n\nEasy to implement\n\nExercises problem-solving skills\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nInconsistent engagement\n\nCan amplify competition, leading to animosity\n\nTime-constrained\n\n3. Word association\n\nWhy: it helps your team focus before a meeting\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 10-15 minutes\n\nThis is another excellent activity to help your team focus before a meeting, only more inclusive and straightforward. Ask your colleagues to summarize the meeting topic in one word â nothing less.\n\nFor example, you might be holding a meeting about your companyâs positioning, so you ask your team to pick one word that best describes it. They could answer with âstrong,â âinconsistent,â and âwork-in-progress.â\n\nNo matter the answer, this exercise allows you to discover the viewpoints of your colleagues and the assumptions that led to these summaries in the first place. Ultimately, you want to clarify issues or goals before diving into the meeting agenda.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nInclusive\n\nFree\n\nEasy to implement\n\nTeam bonding\n\nIt might help achieve future goals faster\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nMight get repetitive\n\nIt might lead to disagreements\n\nIt might get you more stressed if you see it as a task\n\nIt might feel tense if workers take the answers personally\n\n4. Birth map fun facts\n\nWhy: it positively impacts decision-making and creativity and helps you learn about each otherâs culture\n\nYouâll need: Slack, Map of the World image\n\nTime: 10-15 minutes\n\nWorking in a distributed team positively impacts decision-making and creativity in general, as team members with diverse personalities and perspectives can bounce off each other to arrive at never-before-thought solutions.\n\nDownload a map of the world and upload it to a collaboration tool. Then, ask colleagues to point out where they were born and list a few fun facts about it.\n\nSome might be fanatic supporters of their hometown (me included), so let them go the extra mile and present a one-page slider. For instance, did you know that Oradea is the home of the third-largest synagogue in Europe?\n\nThis activity can be an excellent opportunity to learn about each otherâs culture and allow everyone to bring in their unique quirks.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nYou get to know your colleagues on a personal level\n\nIt might spark interesting discussions leading to new and creative work strategies\n\nFree\n\nacquire general knowledge about different cultures\n\nget to know your team better â it helps you plan vacations and time off beforehand based on their specific culture or religion\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nSome teammates might not be comfortable sharing personal information\n\nIt might lead to disagreements due to different cultural beliefs\n\nTime constrained\n\nIt might be hard to implement and include everyone in the activity\n\n5. Open mic\n\nWhy: fosters sharing mutual hobbies and primes the team to contribute more deliberately.\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 15-20 minutes\n\nRemember how you and your classmates stood in a circle in kindergarten and took turns reciting poems and doing gigs? This time, itâs not so embarrassing, I promise.\n\nGive each team member a chance to take the stage for 1-2 minutes before a meeting, with breaks of 15 seconds between performances.\n\nDuring this time, they can sing a song, joke, show off their knife cooking skills â whatever rocks their boat.\n\nThe purpose of this icebreaker is to share mutual hobbies and small guilty pleasures that, in return, will prime the team to contribute more deliberately.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nEngaging\n\nBlows the steam off before a stressful meeting\n\nEasy to implement\n\nPositively impacts team contribution\n\nBonding\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might be stressful for introverts\n\nYou might face video connection problems\n\nIf the group does not know each other on a personal level, it might come off as awkward\n\nYou might not have a hidden talent\n\nIt can be an anxiety booster if you are not an extrovert\n\n6. QuizBreaker\n\nWhy: it helps get to know your team better\n\nYouâll need:Â an email address for each person on your team\n\nTime:Â 3 minutes per week\n\nGroup size:Â 3 to 50\n\nQuizBreaker is a weekly quiz delivered by email; its primary goal is to get to know your team better. Itâs online, simple, fun, and itâs not time-consuming.\n\nThe participants respond to icebreaker questions and attempt to identify who gave each response. For instance, did Sarah or Rob indicate that their preferred TV series is Game of Thrones?\n\nTo set up your account, invite each person on your team to your QuizBreaker account and have them answer at least five icebreakers.\n\nThe quiz will then start going out automatically every Friday afternoon or at a time of your choosing.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nEasy to implement\n\nTeam bonding\n\nSimple and fun\n\nInteractive\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nSome people might forget to attend the activity\n\nIt can get repetitive if done too often\n\nTime constrained\n\nTeamwork activities\n\nNow that youâve warmed up, itâs time to consider some team-building activities that will strengthen the bond between team members and improve overall cohesion.\n\nYouâll know youâre successful when you feel a greater connection with your colleagues, even from miles away.\n\n7. Personality test (MBTI)\n\nWhy: it helps find out where your teamâs strengths and weaknesses lie and know yourself and your teammates better\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 30 minutes\n\nHow well do you know your colleagues professionally? Iâm not talking about their LinkedIn activity or latest credentials but about their preferred way of communicating, handling conflict, and overall team contribution.\n\nFind out by taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test. The original one capitalizes on Carl Jungâs theory that four psychological functions influence our behavior: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking.\n\nThese are further translated into four categories that, when combined, result in 16 personality types.\n\nPlease take the survey at www.truity.com âwe found this to be the most user-friendly oneâto get an accurate profile of your personality type.\n\nYou will find out where your strengths and weaknesses lie, which characteristics make you compatible with other types, and how to deal with them. If you want to throw in some fun, google your type followed by âfamous people.â Iâm ENTP, the same as Celine Dionâalthough I suck at singing.\n\nThis test can also help you to introspect and learn more about your current needs and advantages related to your specific type and boost your best skills.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nMotivation booster\n\nCan eliminate conflict through better knowing how to respond to each colleague in any situation\n\nImprove communication\n\nGet a better view of the teamâs skills as a whole and bank on each individualâs skills\n\nIt might help you create a personal development plan\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nThis might lead to stereotyping\n\nIt might not be fully comprehensive since it doesnât consider all the layers of someoneâs personality.\n\nSome colleagues might not agree to share personal information.\n\n8. Office trivia\n\nWhy: it stimulates your team and reinforces your company values\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 30 minutes\n\nCompetition in the proper context can be stimulating. Especially when itâs about reinforcing your company values and ensuring everyone practices them.\n\nPlay the virtual, more dynamic version of the traditional office trivia for this. Prepare between 20-25 more or less serious questions about your company, like âWhen was it established?â, âWho are your ideal customers?â or âHow many people called Andrew are there?â. You get it. Only this time, youâre also giving hints like a first letter, multiple-choice, or numbers to create confusion.\n\nHereâs the fun part. Group all the participants into teams of 3, with a representative who will use a buzz-like sound to alert you when they have the answer. The buzzing sound has to be chosen at the beginning and canât be changed later. Note that someâlike a chicken squeakâcan steal some laughs from the others and buy you more time. The team with the most correct answers wins. Entertainment is guaranteed while youâre doing an enjoyable value check!\n\nIf you like this, youâll probably want to try other virtual trivia games.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nReinforces company values\n\nInteractive\n\nTeam bonding\n\nFree\n\nFun\n\nEncourages strategic communication\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might cause performance anxiety\n\nIt might be hard to include in a stressful workday, defeating its purpose\n\n9. Fake podcast\n\nWhy: it builds empathy\n\nYouâll need: a video/audio recording tool, Google Drive\n\nTime: 1 hour\n\nWorking in a cross-functional team makes putting ourselves in our colleaguesâ shoes hard. During the handoff process, hiccups are likely to occur. As a marketer trying to communicate with developers or vice versa, itâs important to be cautious when drawing conclusions to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nDuring this virtual activity, pair up team members with one another and have them interview each other about their job roles and responsibilities. The interviews (no longer than 10 minutes) must be recorded in audio or video format and uploaded on a shared platform so the whole team can access them. Prevent this from happening, and host a fake podcast.\n\nThis exercise builds a lot of empathy. Everyone discovers what a usual workday looks like for each of their colleaguesâno more blaming the marketers for âslacking offâ or the developers for âdelayed updates.â\n\nIt will make you understand that weâre all in this together, working together to steer the boat in the same direction.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nTeam bonding\n\nIncreases empathy\n\nYou might come up with new strategies\n\nFree\n\nEngaging\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might be hard to include in a stressful workday, defeating its purpose\n\nIt might lead to animosity\n\n10. Share a goal\n\nWhy: it creates a foundation of trust and support and helps the team rely on each other\n\nYouâll need: Slack, Paymo\n\nTime: 20-30 minutes\n\nFormal policies donât necessarily translate into a trustworthy team. Instead, strong teams are built on trust and support inside and outside work.\n\nEncourage your colleagues to share their personal goals with the team, including why they are essential and when they want to achieve them, even if they are not work-related.\n\nThen, ask about their progress as theyâre approaching deadlines. You can keep lists in a collaboration tool so theyâre always visible.\n\nYes, having your dreams visible in plain sight is a little scary. But there are benefits on both sides.â Dreamersâ get the much-needed help and support from people close to them, whileâ supportersâ learn more about the true nature of their colleagues outside work.\n\nWe become more accountable as a team when we rely on each other to keep moving forward. We strive for this as we are expected to work together to accomplish tasks.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nTeam bonding\n\nParticipants get to practice their soft skills\n\nTeam accountability\n\nIt helps you have a better overall final goal view\n\nGreat motivator\n\nParticipants might empower and help each other reach their primary personal and professional goals.\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nNew employees might find it hard to open up\n\nSome colleagues might be apprehensive about sharing their goals\n\nIt might feel too personal to share non-work-related goals\n\n11. Pancakes vs. Waffles\n\nWhy: it helps understand how your team perceives your unique attributes against similar solutions and whether you need to change your strategy to create a better space in your customersâ minds.\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool.\n\nTime: 40-45 minutes\n\nPancakes vs. Waffles is a collective game with low stakes, gradually growing in importance the longer you play it.\n\nHereâs how it works. Keeping pancakes or waffles as a team would be best, eliminating the losing word.\n\nEach team member can support their choice with arguments, but in the end, the majority has to rule over one word to go on with.\n\nNext, add a new contender. Say Pancakes vs. Snickers, Snickers vs. Salads, Salads vs. Festivals, Festivals vs. Ski Resorts. You get the point.\n\nThe stakes grow higher with every round. Hereâs where it gets interesting: what if you add a product feature and compare it to a similar one of your competitors, say, Time tracking vs. Random screenshots or two competitors facing each other?\n\nIt is vital to assess how your team views your distinctive qualities compared to other options to determine if adjustments to your approach are necessary to improve your standing in the minds of your customers.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\npractice critical thinking skills\n\ngreat way to loosen up during a stressful workday\n\npractice creative thinking\n\nfree\n\npractice your competitive spirit\n\ngreat opportunity for debates\n\nmight lead to finding long-term solutions\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nPlayers might get misunderstood, leading to anxiety or animosities\n\nSome players might feel left out\n\nJust for fun activities\n\nYou canât always keep a straight face at work, even from home. Otherwise, you risk bringing yourself on the verge of burnout. Get a little bit childish on purpose and blow some steam off with the following activities.\n\n12. Meme contest\n\nWhy: a lighthearted activity for relaxation\n\nYouâll need: Paymo board\n\nTime: 15-30 minutes\n\nYouâll love this meme contest if you enjoy shooting paper balls with your colleagues at an improvised hoop (usually the office dustbin).\n\nThe virtual game consists of 4 rounds, each with its topic, to see who can find the best memes online.\n\nYou must log in to Paymo and create a workflowÂ with five columns for each round, including a warm-up one. Then switch to the Board view and have each colleague add their memes to a card and their name.\n\nOnce youâve done this, upvote the person with the funniest meme by reacting with a thumbs-up emoji. The person who wins the most rounds becomes the Troll King Of The Internetâat least on your team!\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nA fun way to blow some steam off\n\nInteractive and personal â but not personal enough that your colleagues would disapprove\n\nIt might create laughs, which will boost the overall mood of the workday\n\nFree\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might not lead to substantial strategic improvements in the workplace\n\nItâs not necessarily linked to anything work-related, and that might not sit well with the CEOs since they might not see any value in this activity\n\n13. Take a pic of your desk\n\nWhy: it helps understand the personality and quirks of your teammates better\n\nYouâll need: Slack, a camera\n\nTime: 5 minutes\n\nYouâre forced to keep your desk clean inside an officeâat least out of common sense and respect for others. This means no scrambled post-its, overlapping coffee rings, or pizza leftovers from last weekendâs DOTA.\n\nAt home, though, you can be as laid-back as you want to. Work next to your cat, have a few Christmas lights hanging to remind you of the holidays, or let the dishes pile up until somebody picks them up.\n\nShare a pic of your workstation on Slack to keep things fun. Then, brag about the chaos almost swallowing you or your unique setup. In return, this will spark serious laughs and legit reactions to question your interior design skillsâand sanity.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nFun\n\nIt might motivate you to clean your desk, leading to further achievements or even creating a professional growth plan.\n\nYou might bond with your colleagues through your quirks, such as merchandise of your favorite TV shows or bands.\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might be too personal for employees to share their specific home office location\n\nThis might lead to privacy issues if the picture is taken from a broader view and gets into the wrong hands.\n\n14. Share an everyday music playlist\n\nWhy: a better grasp of your colleagueâs personality\n\nYouâll need: Spotify\n\nTime: n.a. (can be done async)\n\nWho doesnât enjoy a fair share of music during work? I thought so. This studyÂ has investigated the effects of background music on performing repetitive tasks, showing that 90% of the surveyed people are more productive when they listen to music.\n\nWith the science in place, itâs time to pair it with tech. Use Spotify to create a shared playlist that each team member can listen to and contribute to. Jazz it up for a mellow feel when you need to get into the zone or sprinkle it with electronic beats to get work done. Hereâs what we peeps at Paymo listen to.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nBonding\n\nYou get to know your colleagues better â music has a deep and personal meaning for each individual\n\nIncreases productivity\n\nDecreases stress\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nYou might need a Spotify subscription\n\nSome colleagues might not use Spotify (paid or free), so it might not be as interactive as other activities\n\n15. MTV Cribs: Work from home edition\n\nWhy: it brings your team closer, even when theyâre miles away or youâve never met in person\n\nYouâll need: a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: 1 hour\n\nRemember MTV Cribs? How was every celebrity trying to impress the viewersâprimarily teenagers, myself includedâwith their ginormous houses and lavish lifestyles? Leaving aside the showâs snobbiness, this is the perfect exercise to bring your team closer, even when theyâre miles away or youâve never met in person.\n\nHave each of them give a fun, creative, â90s-style tour of their house or workstation in a way that reflects their personality. Youâll learn more about your colleagues by observing them in their ânaturalâ environment and even discover common hobbies like a love of desk cacti or the fact that you both pet a corgi. The virtual game also comes with a few hidden benefits. It urges some to tidy up a bit, while others can raise the bar for the rest with matching outfits or easter eggs.\n\nThe pros and cons of this activity are the same as the âTake a pic of your deskâ ones; the main pro is that it brings the team together, and the worst con is that it can lead to privacy issues.\n\n16. Remote Work Bingo\n\nWhy: it helps the team stay focused during meetings\n\nYouâll need: a bingo card, a video conferencing tool\n\nTime: n.a. (can be done async)\n\nDid somebody say BINGOOOO? I used to play it in college, shouting âfull-lineâ or âbingoâ across the tables filled with complimentary tea and coffee to keep the gamblers pinned the whole night. You can play a remote work-themed one with your team. This will allow you to experience this game without having to experience the hassle of a lousy cafeteria.\n\nStart with the bingo card below and cross off the squares once you hear someone say the exact words or you happen to be doing one of the same activities during a video call, like wearing sweatpants.\n\nThe first one to complete the card wins, although your colleagues will enjoy themselves even if they share everyday things theyâve crossed off together. So, please keep it in close reach and brag about your record while doing video meetings to spice up the atmosphere.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nFun and engaging\n\nCreates a positive atmosphere\n\nBonding\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might be off-putting to some since they might associate it with gambling (and with grannies)\n\nProblem-solving activities\n\nEncouraging your team to work together effectively can be challenging. Consider implementing problem-solving activities encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones and work towards a shared objective. Some of these activities require little logistics and time. Others are more elaborate and involve prolonged states of focus.\n\n17. Murder Mystery on the Train\n\nWhy: you build strategies and connections\n\nYouâll needÂ a smartphone\n\nTime: 90 min\n\nThisÂ murder mystery team-building activity combines an engaging challenge with a twist! When the session starts, the Event Manager will brief the group virtually, providing intel about the murder.\n\nYouâll virtually travel back in time to the 1920s to solve this murder case thatâs on the move.\n\nTeams must use their smartphones to work through the evidence by tapping on the interactive map and objects.\n\nWhile picking up clues, participants must also use video and augmented reality on their smartphones to collect intel and determine who the killer is. The winning team will be the one who finds the killer and scores the most points.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nextremely engaging and creative â this will lead to more people wanting to join and interact\n\ndevelops problem-solving skills\n\npromotes strategic thinking â it might lead to some of them being implemented in your daily tasks\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nIt might get too competitive\n\nIt might be hard to organize\n\nyou might face connection problems since this game is played on a smartphone\n\nsome colleagues might not have a modern phone, which this game requires\n\nOur top picks\n\nWe concluded this chapter with our top picks, reinforcing why they might be the easiest to implement and how they could help with team bonding and actual work environment improvement in the long run.\n\nWe will also include the activities we do not recommend and why.\n\nMurder Mystery on the Train\n\nThis activity develops your problem-solving skills and promotes strategic thinking while being extremely engaging and fun.\n\nIt promotes bonding, but it also entices you through competition. While it might seem like a fun first-hand activity, it could lead to task and work dynamic improvement in the long run.\n\nOpening questions\n\nThis team-building activity is the easiest to implement. Communication is vital in relations, whether they are work-related or not.\n\nThis is a quick and easy task that can be done often and has the potential to strengthen team relationships and increase focus.\n\nNatural communication that does not feel forced is one of the most critical assets for a happy team and a great work environment.\n\nThis activity deserves one of our top spots due to how many benefits it can bring, considering how easy it is to implement.\n\nPersonality test (MBTI)\n\nEngaging in this activity can contribute to your growth both in your professional and personal life.\n\nIt has many aspects that, if used correctly, can tremendously help with the following:\n\nTeam bonding\n\nProfessional growth\n\nAcquiring new skills\n\nsetting and adapting a workstyle that fits each member of the team\n\nWe do not recommend\n\nMTV Cribs: Work from home edition\n\nTake a pic of your desk\n\nThe possible benefits of these team-building activities can be outweighed by the negatives they can bring.\n\nIn an era with so many privacy issues due to security breaks and a lack of strictly implemented privacy policies online, you should be careful of what media you share.\n\nWith that being said, MTV Cribs: Work from Home edition and Take a pic of your desk could lead to some privacy issues if you are not fully knowledgeable of how to protect your security and shared data.\n\nIf, nevertheless, you choose to implement these activities, train your employees beforehand to:\n\nDo not show personal data in these pictures and videos â this includes IDs, family photos, contracts forgotten on the table, packages that show a specific address, written-down passwords, etc.\n\nFor the âTake a pic of your deskâ activity, try to avoid showing the outside view of your home through windows, mainly if your office has a clear view of your front porch â these can easily be tracked, and they can disclose your location\n\nfor the âMTV Cribs: Work from home edition,â DO NOT SHARE YOUR HOME ADDRESS and blur out everything personal\n\nB. 28 In-person activities\n\nMany studies have shown that implementing fun and engaging activities during or after a workday increases productivity exponentially.\n\nUnlike their remote counterparts, people who work in the office might find it harder to distress since they work in a more professional environment.\n\nThey do not have their cat or favorite couch around to get their mind off work and release their anxiety in stressful situations.\n\nAll of the âhomeyâ vibes you might miss in your work environment can easily be implemented with the help of your colleagues and some easy-to-follow team-building activities.\n\nAs in the previous chapter, we will incorporate and categorize all of the activities in the table below:\n\nSocial activities\n\nWhy: these social activities employees to relax, socialize, and build positive relationships, fostering team bonding\n\nTime: varying\n\nGroup size: teams of all sizes\n\nHere are ten suggestions for social teambuilding activities:\n\n18. Organize a âDesk Pet Dayâ\n\nEncourage employees to bring their pets to work for a day to create a fun atmosphere in the office. Caveat: make sure team members are on board and that you also account for potential allergies to animal fur.\n\n19. Plan a âLunch and Learnâ\n\nHost a lunch and learn where employees can share their skills and knowledge with each other. A lunch-and-learn activity helps build teamwork and encourage professional development. Plus, itâs great for networking and offering a great place for mentoring.\n\n20. Host a cooking showdown\n\nHost a cooking competition where employees can showcase their culinary skills. A cooking showdown can be a great way to bond over food and try new recipes.\n\nAlternative: It could be a culinary fusion night, where everyone brings ingredients from different cultures and cuisines, using the spices and ingredients to create unique dishes, from re-imagined sushi or pot pies to everything-but-the-kitchen-sink pizzas.\n\n21. Start a âTourist Walkâ\n\nGrab your team, establish an itinerary, and visit unknown places, hidden gems, or cultural/historical places. It could be your local folk museum, an art gallery, or other culturally significant places. Have a dedicated tour guide, or be the groupâs connoisseur with the fun facts.\n\nAlternative: âCountryside walk.â If possible, get outside and enjoy nature with a countryside walk to reduce stress and promote physical activity.\n\nBonus: gamify the experience through orienteering, where team players have to find their way with the help of a map or GPS.\n\n22. Organize a scavenger hunt\n\nA scavenger hunt is a great social activity where employees can work together to solve clues and complete challenges. It can take as little as one hour and can be held both indoors and outdoors.\n\nAlternative: The hunt could take place on a Sports Day, like basketball, soccer, pickle ball, or even relay races.\n\n23. Prepare a wine-tasting event\n\nOrganize a wine-tasting event where employees can sample wines and learn about winemaking. Itâs not only fun but also an educational experience.\n\nCaveat: do account for teetotalers and other abstainers, making sure it doesnât fall on specific religious holidays.\n\n24. Host a theme outfit extravaganza\n\nEither organize a âDress Like Your Favorite Decade,â go for a Halloween theme, don some historical fashion, and have everyone share their fashion with a dash of fun and laughter.\n\nAlternative: have a Karaoke night, a lip-sync contest, or a talent show thatâs fun and encouraging. Bonus: end the event with an awards night, where you recognize employees for their hard work and achievements.\n\n25. Gift a wellness or spa package\n\nNothing beats rest and relaxation, and itâs a great way for your team to socialize informally. Here are other ways to gift your employees and boost employee satisfaction and retention by showing appreciation.\n\n26. Organize seminars and workshops\n\nYou could invite well-known speakers to give talks or hold seminars. Bonus: involve employees who are good communicators to show and tell an interest or passion project.\n\nAlternative: host a stand-up comedy night.\n\n27. Spearhead a one-time volunteering gig\n\nBe it a blood drive, donating clothes or toys, doing a park clean-up, or serving at the local kitchen soup, volunteering can reflect positive values you want to instill in your team.\n\nCaveat: consider the degree of commitment and the fact that some might have conflicting schedules or prior engagements. One-off experiences are great because you donât want the team to take on more work upon themselves.\n\nIce Breaker games\n\n28. Campfire/Memory Wall\n\nWhy: a great solution to popularizing Kanban methodology within your team\n\nYouâll need:Â a whiteboard, sticky notes, markers\n\nTime:Â 30-45 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â 8-20\n\nInstructions:Â Jot down between 5-10 work-related words on sticky notes like âFirstâ day at work,â âTeamwork,â âSide projects,â or âCelebrations.â\n\nPlace the sticky notes on one side of the whiteboard to be visible to the team.\n\nNext, gather your colleagues in a circle and ask a volunteer to peel off a word to share an experience.\n\nOnce done, they can post it on the other side of the whiteboard to mark the beginning of a story thread. The others can think of similar stories and develop their own words.\n\nThey can stick them on the whiteboard to continue the story thread or pick a word that already exists if nothing pops up in their minds.\n\nThe goal is to create interconnected stories that act as the campfireâs archive.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nTeam bonding\n\nEntices creative thinking\n\nEveryone feels heard, making teammates prone to contribute more in the long run.\n\nCons of this activity\n\nIt might be hard to find time in a workday to pursue this activity â organize it beforehand\n\n29. Office Trivia\n\nWhy: it tests your teamâs observation skills and sparks serious laughing sessions\n\nYouâll need:Â 20-25 index cards\n\nTime:Â 30 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â Unlimited\n\nInstructions:Â Who knows most about your office? Find out through a simple team-building activity like trivia. Think of 20-25Â fun icebreaker questions about your workplaceâs small details that can go unnoticed. âWhich movie is featured on the conference roomâs poster?â âWhat color does the coffee machine have?â âHow many people named âAndrewâ work in the company?â âHow many people are using Windows PCs?â etc.\n\nThis will test your teamâs observation skills and spark serious laughing sessions. Remember not to ask questions that are too personal and would put a team member into an embarrassing situation, like âWho has the biggest mouth in the office?â.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nYou get to know more about the company and their values\n\nImproves your observation skills\n\nFun\n\nTeam bonding\n\nBoosts staff morale\n\nCons of this activity\n\nTime-restricted\n\nSome people might not find it engaging\n\nMight get repetitive\n\n30. Trading Cards\n\nWhy: it gives everyone a visual snapshot of each player while sparking conversations\n\nYouâll need: index cards, markers\n\nTime: 10-15 minutes\n\nGroup size: Unlimited\n\nInstructions: Remember baseball or Pokemon trading cards?\n\nFor this fun team-building activity, youâre the one whoâs being âtraded.â\n\nGive out large-scale index cards and markers to each team member. Ask them to create a personal trading card of themselves, with their name, self-portrait, nickname, and one fact about them that everyone is less likely to know about.\n\nThen, have the cards go from one person to another in no particular order.\n\nParticipants can hold onto a card if they find its facts exciting and want to know more about it from its owner.\n\nThe excellent exercise gives everyone a visual snapshot of each player while sparking conversations.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nFun\n\nGreat for stress relief\n\nEngaging\n\nGreat conversation starter\n\nYou get to know more about your team members in a fun and exciting way\n\nCons of this activity\n\nSome employees might find it too personal\n\nTime constrained\n\nIt can exacerbate animosities between employees who are not so fond of one another\n\n31. Penny for Thought\n\nWhy: it loosens up the atmosphere, brings a sense of familiarity among the team, and helps with future conversations\n\nYouâll need: pennies or any coins with listed years, box, or bucket\n\nTime: 10-15 minutes\n\nGroup size: Unlimited\n\nInstructions: It might be challenging to start working on a project without properly knowing your colleagues. To loosen up the atmosphere quickly:\n\nGather coins with listed years on them to have one for each member.\n\nDrop them in a box or bucket.\n\nCheck every coin so the dates are not older than the youngest team member.\n\nHave each team member draw a coin and share a memorable moment from their lives that happened in the year when the coin was minted.\n\nThis brings a sense of familiarity among them and smoothens future conversations.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nteam bonding\n\nincreases long-term productivity\n\nit brings a sense of familiarity between the team\n\ndecreases stress\n\nCons of this activity\n\nTime constrained\n\nIt might bring back some bad memories for some players, leading to them having a bad mood throughout the day.\n\nIt might lead to a lack of productivity during the day due to employees being stuck in a loop of reminiscing.\n\n32. M&M Arm Wrestle\n\nWhy: it loosens up the atmosphere\n\nYouâll need:Â a bag of M&M\n\nTime:Â 15 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â 4-20\n\nInstructions:Â Ask the participants to pair up and assume an arm-wrestling position. They can either stand on the floor or at a table. Whenever they pin down their partnerâs arm, they win a point.\n\nThe goal is to earn as many points as possible before the time goes out â usually 10 seconds. Youâll notice that people will focus more on competition and wrestle arms with each other (Win-Lose situation) rather than work together and win points for both sides (Win-Win situation).\n\nGive them a couple of extra rounds to figure it out for themselves. The bottom line is that winning at all costs, even at your co-workerâs stake, is counterproductive.\n\nBut wait, where do M&Mâs come into play? The participants will get an M&M candy for each point earnedâa great incentive for kids and adults. And you can use them during all activities for team building.\n\nPros of this activity:\n\nenticing\n\nfun\n\ncompetitive\n\nincreases focus\n\nreleases stress\n\nCons of this activity:\n\nit might lead to injuries\n\ntime-constrained\n\nit might not bring many work-related benefits long-term\n\nYou can also play this team activity using Skittles instead of M&M, just like our clients at Flourish Marketing did.\n\nStrategic team-building activities for small groups\n\nAt first glance, these activities may seem like icebreakers, but they have a more critical purpose. They help employees develop a shared identity by exploring their thoughts on the company and what shapes their opinions.\n\n33. All the News\n\nWhy: helps spot hidden opportunities or threats and instills a sense of loyalty, as each team member feels appreciated and has a stake in the companyâs development.\n\nYouâll need: newspapers, a whiteboard, tape, scissors, markers\n\nTime: 60 minutes\n\nGroup size: 6-20\n\nInstructions:Â Have you always wanted to quickly peek into your employeesâ minds to see how they perceive the company? Nowâs your chance.\n\nTo do this group team building activity, divide people into teams of 3 or 6, preferably by department.\n\nGive each team a newspaper and ask them to create headlines about what they think the company or the department will achieve.\n\nThere are no rules in particular. They can paste newspaper clippings or write the headlines directly on the whiteboard.\n\nWhen the timeâs up, teams pin up their work and discuss each idea to see if theyâre feasible or not.\n\nThe exercise is excellent for spotting hidden opportunities or threats. It also instills a sense of loyalty as each team member feels appreciated and has a stake in the companyâs development.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nthis might lead to new strategies being implemented\n\nthis leads to better long-term communication\n\nteam bonding\n\nit might refresh the views of the team and also of the company on how to approach different strategies and tasks\n\nCons of this activity\n\nThis might lead to disputes\n\nIt might be hard to implement during the workday due to the time needed for this activity.\n\n34. Mad Lib Mission Statement\n\nWhy: it makes everyone aware of your companyâs values\n\nYouâll need:Â paper, pens\n\nTime:Â 45 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â 6-20\n\nInstructions:Â Building a brand is problematic if the world doesnât know what you stand for. Thatâs why you have the mission statement: to convince others about what your product or service can (and canât) do and why you matter.\n\nLike in the previous activity, divide your team into groups of 3 to 6, then grab a copy of your mission statement for each team so they can replicate it.\n\nThe team that comes up with the most accurate mission statement wins. Itâs also perhaps an opportunity to change your old one or make everyone aware of your companyâs values.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nit helps identify the best and worst team strategies\n\nit might help you distinguish yourself from the competitors\n\nreduces stress\n\nimproves analytical thinking\n\nit might help you find specific solutions for current problems\n\nimproves leadership skills\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit might get too competitive\n\nthis might lead to disagreements rather than debates\n\nintroverts might be less engaged in this activity\n\n35. Company Concentration\n\nWhy: develops agility and observation spirit and gives new hires a fun yet quick way to learn more about the company\n\nYouâll need:Â index cards\n\nTime:Â 45-60 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â Unlimited\n\nMuch like the âConcentrationâ game from childhood, where you flipped over two cards simultaneously to find the matching pairs, this activity demands agility and observation spirit.\n\nCreate a deck of cards with photos or words about your company. These might be photos of your team, logos, products, or value statements.\n\nFace all the cards down, then split the group into teams. Each team has to take turns and lift only two cards at a time to see if they match.\n\nThe one that finds all the pairs in the shortest time wins. The activity is ideal for new hires who need a fun yet quick way to learn more about the company. But it isnât limited only to them. Senior hires can also improve their knowledge and stay updated with the latest organizational changes.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nimproves company knowledge both for new and senior employees\n\nentices competitive spirit\n\nimproves the agility and observation spirit of the players\n\neasy way to learn more about the companyâs values\n\nrelaxing\n\nbonding\n\nfun\n\nCons of this activity\n\nnot extremely engaging\n\nit might get repetitive\n\nit might be hard to implement in a workday\n\n36. Group Timeline\n\nWhy: a great starting point for debates concerning how you collaborate as a team\n\nYouâll need:Â a pinboard, pins, paper, pens\n\nTime:Â 60 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â 5-8\n\nInstructions:\n\nOn the pinboard, draw a blank timeline.\n\nRemember to date it back to when your oldest employee was born or the company was founded.\n\nAdd years to it, then write down on paper slips the most critical company dates (like when it was founded, merged, etc.).\n\nPin them to the corresponding year.\n\nAsk your team members to think about 3 or 4 events that marked their lives (like graduating college, moving abroad, having a child, etc.) and pin them on the timeline when they occur.\n\nThe activity brings into perspective the gap between generations. Itâs a great starting point for debates concerning collaborating as a team.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nlearn more about both the company and each team memberâs values, aspirations, and identity\n\ngreat debate starter\n\nimproves team collaboration\n\nentices competition\n\nCons of this activity\n\nIt might get too personal for some employees\n\nIt might be hard to implement in a workday\n\nProblem-solving activities\n\n37. Bridge Build\n\nWhy: it develops communication skills, problem-solving, and creative thinking; promotes active listening, team communication, and creative thinking; fosters cooperation and teamwork\n\nYouâll need:Â building materials (like legos, toy bricks, straws, marshmallows, etc.), tape, paper, pens, and sheets.\n\nTime:Â 50 minutes\n\nGroup size:Â 8-16\n\nInstructions:Â Warm up with this game before entering meetings requiring severe brainpower.\n\n1. Split the group into two teams.\n\n2. Then explain how to build half of a bridge with the materials provided.\n\nWhen finished, the bridges should be similar in design and connection â the trick is they canât see each otherâs bridge, so theyâll have to rely on verbal communication.\n\n3. Remember to set the room up first and place the sheets to divide them.\n\n4.

Their task? To create a 4â5-minute skit using those objects.\n\nThe gist is that nobody knows whatâs in the bags. This encourages using everyday objects as replacements for different terms (a pair of glasses can act as a bicycle, for example).\n\nRemember that each team member needs to be the speaker at least once.

Their task is to form a perfect square together.\n\nOnce theyâre done, they can take off their blindfolds and see what theyâve accomplished.\n\nIf the results are sloppy and thereâs enough time, give them a second chance to do it better.\n\nYou can also increase the difficulty by muting a random participant or changing the shape (a star or a square, for example).\n\nThe challenge demands increased collaboration and trust since the muted person has to rely on something other than sight and verbal communication to perform their job.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nit involves physical activity\n\nchallenges and promotes all types of communication\n\nyou get to learn how your colleagues solve problems when faced with difficulties\n\ngreat way to come up with creative problem-solving ideas\n\nteam bonding\n\ndevelops cooperation skills and team trust\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit might lead to minor injuries\n\nit might be hard to include some players who often encounter perception difficulties, are scared of the dark, or are claustrophobic\n\nit might be tricky to implement if you choose to do this activity during work hours if your office does not have an outdoor space\n\n45. Robots\n\nWhy: itâs a great way to see how your team works together in an uncontrolled environment, and it develops active listening skills\n\nMain focus: bonding\n\nYouâll need a rope to mark the start line, blindfolds, and a âbombâ in the form of a ball.\n\nTime: 30 minutes\n\nGroup size: 6-12\n\nInstructions: This group team-building activity is a great way to see how your team works in an uncontrolled environment.\n\nThe objective? To communicate in such a way as to retrieve a fake âbombâ before the other teams. Each team contains 3 to 5 members. There are three key roles to remember:\n\nRobot (1) â stands blindfolded in front of the start line, facing the bomb, and is the only one allowed to move.\n\nCommunicator (2) â stands behind the line and doesnât face the activity area or the robot.\n\nObserver (3) â stands in front of the communicator facing the activity area but is not allowed to talk.\n\nThe team game begins with the observer, who can use any other communication channel to signal the direction to the communicator.\n\nThe communicator, in return, has to interpret those signals and give instructions to the robot to retrieve the bomb.\n\nAs a facilitator, your goal is to observe how each communicates verbally and nonverbally.\n\nPay special attention to the robots when it comes toÂ active listening.\n\nThis team activity is excellent for people who want to understand Scrum mechanics better.\n\nRobots might represent the Scrum team that carries out the sprints. The communicator is the Scrum Master, who acts as a servant-leader for the Scrum team. Meanwhile, the observer resembles the Product Owner, who prioritizes product specifications and coordinates the Scrum team.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nit involves physical activity\n\nchallenges and promotes all types of communication\n\nyou get to learn how your colleagues solve problems when faced with difficulties\n\ngreat way to come up with creative problem-solving ideas\n\nteam bonding\n\ndevelops cooperation skills and team trust\n\ndevelops active listening\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit might lead to minor injuries\n\nit might be hard to include some players who often encounter perception difficulties, are scared of the dark, or are claustrophobic\n\nit might be confusing for colleagues who are neurodivergent\n\nit might be tricky to implement if you choose to do this activity during work hours if your office does not have an outdoor space\n\nProblem-solving activities\n\n46. Gutter Ball/Pipeline\n\nWhy: it improves mind-body coordination and concentration, it develops and improves problem-solving skills, it promotes team communication and bonding along with creative thinking\n\nMain focus: fun, competition, bonding\n\nYouâll need half pipes, marbles,\n\nTime: 45-60 minutes\n\nGroup size: 8-15\n\nInstructions: This exercise aims to cross marbles of different sizes from one side of the field to the other without touching the grass.\n\nHow? Through short lengths of half pipes.\n\nEach team member gets one and has to balance it so that it passes down seamlessly.\n\nHereâs the trick. The facilitator, you, in this case, can add obstacles between the start and endpoints to make the activity more challenging.\n\nYou can even come up with additional rules that require team members to take turns or to remain with both feet on the floor.\n\nBreak the group into teams, let them devise a plan, and then time how long it took for the marbles to pass down.\n\nThe team that keeps the marble going for the longest time wins.\n\nA small word of advice: try to make the race hard, but not impossible, so each team member knows what they can achieve as a group.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nengaging due to its active nature and exciting gameplay\n\nimproves mind-body coordination\n\nimproves concentration\n\ndevelops and improves problem-solving skills\n\npromotes team communication and bonding\n\npromotes creative thinking\n\npromotes out-of-the-box views regarding problem-solving that can be used in the long run for project development\n\nCons of this activity\n\nmight get frustrating\n\nsome teammates might not be able to participate due to health-related issues\n\n47. Web of Wools\n\nWhy: it helps to understand that the team couldnât have been successful without everyoneâs contributions\n\nMain focus: competition, bonding\n\nYouâll need:Â yarn\n\nTime:Â 30 min\n\nGroup size:Â 9-12\n\nInstructions:Â Break the group into teams of equal numbers.\n\nThen, have each team form a web of wools. The more intricate, the better.\n\nHere comes the best part: switch the teams, so everyone has a different web than their own.\n\nEach team should then blindfold a team member and have them untangle the web following only their verbal instructions. The first team to do it wins.\n\nSounds easy, right? In reality, itâs not.\n\nYou have to give concise advice and be receptive enough to follow your colleagues and instincts â should you be the one whoâs blindfolded.\n\nPros of this activity\n\npromotes the idea of working together to reach a common goal\n\ndevelops problem-solving skills â you get to find how to approach new ideas and solutions when faced with difficulties\n\nteam bonding\n\nengaging due to its active nature and exciting gameplay\n\nimproves mind-body coordination\n\nimproves concentration\n\ndevelops active listening skills\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit might lead to minor injuries\n\nit might be hard to include some players who often encounter perception difficulties, are scared of the dark, or are claustrophobic\n\nit might be confusing for colleagues who are neurodivergent\n\n48.

For example: âCongratulations! Youâve won 30 minutes of additional break on Monday!â\n\nYou can make this activity thematic and include treasures linked to specific holidays.\n\nFor example, an Easter-themed scavenger hunt in which you include treasures such as easter eggs, chocolate eggs, or little bunny figurines.\n\nNext, place your treasures in a hidden area and develop your map. Trace a map that includes the brief locations of the treasures, and donât forget to give some additional clues as to where the objects could be found and which specific object could be found in each area â you can phrase these clues as riddles for more engaging gameplay.\n\nYou can find some great templates of scavenger hunt mapsÂ here.\n\nDivide the players into teams, ensure each team has the same number of players, and give each team a printed copy of the map.\n\nThis activity aims to find as many treasures as possible in the 60-90 minutes of gameplay.\n\nPros of this activity\n\nexponentially improves team bonding\n\nplayers might feel more motivated and more engaged in this activity due to the small rewards found in each treasure\n\npromotes physical activity\n\ndevelops and improves strategic thinking\n\nyou practice communication skills\n\nboosts overall team morale\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit might imply some costs depending on what treasures you choose\n\nit might be hard to organize\n\nit might lead to injuries\n\nit might become exhausting\n\nit is quite time-consuming\n\nSporting activities\n\nThese activities are specifically designed to get you moving.

Paintball\n\nWhy: it promotes a healthy lifestyle and physical activity, develops and improves strategic thinking, facilitates communication, boosts overall team morale, exponentially improves team bonding, and develops leadership skills\n\nMain focus: fun, competitive\n\nYouâll need:Â a paintball range or field ticket, equipment\n\nTime:Â Depends on how much the session takes â usually a few hours\n\nGroup size: 6-10/ 50 vs 50\n\nInstructions:Â\n\nWhen you think of outdoor team-building activities, paintball is often one of the first that comes to mind.\n\nIt is so widespread, and most times, it will be one of the first activities designated as a top contender in a planned team-building trip because of its engaging and enticing nature.\n\nIf you want to pump up the adrenaline and are considering a more complex and unusual approach for a teambuilding activity, paintball is the way to go!\n\nThe basic strategy of this game implies two teams that try to eliminate each other by throwing paintballs at a specific target, in this case, your adversaries.\n\nThe end goal of this activity is to eliminate as many adversaries as possible within the given time limit.\n\nThe more in-depth rules of this game will be explained at the paintball range you chose before starting the activity.\n\nPros of this activity\n\npromotes a healthy lifestyle\n\npromotes physical activity\n\ndevelops and improves strategic thinking\n\nyou practice communication skills\n\nboosts overall team morale\n\nexponentially improves team bonding\n\ndevelops leadership skills\n\nrelieves stress\n\nimproves and develops problem-solving skills\n\nCons of this activity\n\nit is more expensive than the rest of the activities on this list\n\nit requires specific organization and locations; you cannot plan this as fast as the rest of the activities on this list\n\nit might lead to injuries if you do not wear your equipment right â hitting paintballs might hurt\n\nOur top picksÂ\n\nOutdoor Scavenger Hunt\n\nThis activity is just as engaging and beneficial as paintball, but itâs much easier to organize and more cost-effective.\n\nIt has all the valuable benefits of an outdoor team-building activity, such as:\n\npromoting physical activity\n\nteam bonding\n\nimproving strategic thinking\n\nboosting morale\n\nRobotsÂ\n\nIf you want to enhance your teamâs active listening, cooperation, trust, and problem-solving abilities in the long run, implementing the game âRobotsâ is a great idea.\n\nOther outdoor ideas\n\nWant to get out of the office altogether? Try other outdoor team-building activities like building a real campfire, going rafting, or doing a scavenger hunt â depending on how adventurous your team feels. You could even pair these with a social cause, as our clients at MECLABS participated in a beach cleanup with their families.\n\nWhy are team-building activities important?\n\nTeam building activities are a great way to get to know your colleagues personally.\n\nThis can enhance the teamâs dynamic and productivity because:\n\nyou learn each team memberâs best and worst skills\n\nyou get to know more about each otherâs personalities\n\nyou can observe how everyone behaves in an unconstrained environment (the introverted team member may surprise everyone by excelling as a team leader)\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nyou can learn each team memberâs most vital soft skills\n\nyou can boost team productivity by using and integrating everyoneâs best skills in the work environment\n\nyou will know where every individual member needs improvement â you can help them evolve and adapt\n\nyou will have more insights on how to manage the team in the future better\n\neveryone will exercise their adaptability â this will enhance the teamâs work quality\n\nteams get a better understanding of what is truly the key to success\n\nBefore we move forward, please keep in mind that:\n\nTeam building activities for adults are not a one-time silly event but an ongoing process. Their aim? To build trust between team members and ensure everybody is heading in the same direction following a shared set of values.\n\nSuccess doesnât depend on the number of hours spent at the office but on the quality of your work. In turn, this stems from your well-being. A high workload can cause fatigue and burnout in the long run. Resting has advantages; it helps you see problems differently and more creatively.\n\nTechnology giants and start-ups, in particular, have already adopted this mindset, providing office perks and socializing events through free lunches, ping-pong tables, hackathons, and regular parties.\n\nThey realized early on that efficiency and performance are linked with a stress-free work environment where everybody is content and gives their best.\n\nStudies and surveys on the benefits and importance of team building further solidify this.\n\nTeamstage has put everything in perspective with their survey. Here is the data they gathered:\n\nNearly 75% of employees see teamwork and collaboration as essential.\n\nTeam building can improve work ethic and innovation up to 10 times.\n\nOver 50% of employees have stayed at a company because they felt like part of a team\n\n75% of staff say teamwork and collaboration are crucial to corporate success.\n\n75% of staff say teamwork and collaboration are crucial to corporate success.\n\nCompanies with a fully engaged workforce are capable of generating twice the revenue.\n\nBenefits of team building activities\n\nNot everyone is keen on participating in team-building activities. Reasons like âI could get many things done during this timeâ or âThis is childish and unimportantâ are often brought up regarding this topic.\n\nTry to assure them that this experience will be fun and lighthearted from the get-go. Show them pictures and videos from previous team buildings to lure them in.\n\nOnce they have a clear picture of what team building implies, they will be way more likely to see the benefits of this activity.\n\nTeam building activities benefit both the employee and the employer since better performance and employee satisfaction drastically improve and solidify Company Culture.\n\nTeam building is essential in an environment where only 23% of workers feel like their engagement matters (as shown in the graph provided by Gallup).\n\nWhy? Because it makes employees feel heard and essential to the team and consequently to the outcome of their projects and work.\n\nIt also allows them to discover the more humane side of their company and what they truly value, both personally and professionally.\n\nAccording to the statistics conducted by TravelPerkÂ on Team Building, as of 2023, â81% of respondents are organizing more face-to-face events compared to the last 12 months.â\n\nThis tactic seems to be appreciated by employers and employees since, according toÂ TravelPerk, most of them do wish to adopt it as much as possible in the future, âHalf of the respondents said theyâre planning team-building activities, while 46% are planning after-work socials, and 44% are planning workshops.â\n\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we will present some specific benefits of team-building activities.\n\nIncreased trust\n\nFun team-building activities can be used in the workplace to build trust. People who trust their colleagues in character and capability are more willing to step out of their comfort zone and pursue a common goal. They have each otherâs back, so they donât need to worry about someone constantly checking their work. Instead, they rely on each of their coworkersâ strengths and build something more significant together than they would have done alone. Nobody wants to work with semi-strangers theyâre afraid of. Gary Vee sums it up better: âPeople work much better when you deploy honey instead of vinegar.â\n\nConstructive criticism\n\nRefers to the courage to speak your mind without fearing the consequences. This means you can share information freely, even when wrong, and pick up someoneâs brain effortlessly. Sure, mistakes can and will happen, but itâs better to rely on a supportive team that points you in the right direction instead of one who will keep the score.\n\nA leaner and faster onboarding\n\nWeâre talking about helping new hires adapt to the company culture. The sooner you help them understand company roles and procedures and meet their coworkers in person, the faster they will become ready to work and contribute meaningfully. Get this part right, and you have a higher chance of retaining valuable talent for extended periods.\n\nImproved performance\n\nSolidify your team through trust. The benefit of a unified team will be seen in their future performance.\n\nWhy? Because understanding your teamâs assets and aspirations will result in higher productivity levels and better team engagement.\n\nDiscovering hidden talents and skills\n\nYour coworkers are your allies in a team environment. You can discover some of their best soft skills through team-building activities and implement them in your work routine.\n\nTip: Try to observe your colleagues during these activities, remark\n\nWho is the best listener?\n\nWho communicates the tasks coherently and clearly?\n\nWho is the best leader?\n\nThese new-found skills can lead to different benefits, such as\n\nPromotion possibilities\n\nBetter team environment\n\nIncreased productivity\n\nLess time spent on tasks\n\nUnwind â discover new problem-solving techniques\n\nWhen faced with deadlines and stressful tasks, your team might not work at its full potential.\n\nThese team-building activities can boost your future performance by providing a stress-free, low-pressure environment where you can think clearly and creatively.\n\nThis can increase your problem-solving skills in a work environment and lead to a more creative approach to solving issues.\n\nCreatives are quickly sapped of their creative juices. To reduce some of that pent-up stress if youâre working in one of those demanding firms, opt for one of the best project management software for a creative agency that helps automate your work and track time so that you can focus on meaningful work.
