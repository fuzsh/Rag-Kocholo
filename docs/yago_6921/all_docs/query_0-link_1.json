        "text": "By Alice L. And Greg E. Luckhardt\n\nHistorical Vignettes - Martin County\n\nA Mini-Series of Interesting Stories, Forgotten Facts\n\nIn the 1940s, movie star, Jon Hall and his wife, singing sensation, Frances Langford, fell in love with the Jensen Beach area and purchased a 260-acre tract of land on which they built their dream home. Situated between the Indian and St. Lucie Rivers, in a region known as Mt. Pizgah, it would become their legal residence.\n\nJon, having been raised on the island of Tahiti, decided the major theme of the home and estate would be that of the South Pacific islands, which was also favored by Frances. Jon compared their home and the Stuart / Jensen Beach area as offering all that Tahiti has, from coconuts, oranges, hibiscus and great fishing to the good weather.\n\nHe was born Charles Felix Locher, in California on Feb. 26, 1915. His father, Felix, was Swiss-born and mother, Frieda, was a Tahitian princess. By the early 1930s Jon was making Hollywood movies, mostly adventure stories. He married Frances Langford in 1934 and throughout the 1940s he starred as the athletic handsome man in several action films.\n\nHowever in the 1950s, a new television series, 'Ramar of the Jungle', was offered to and accepted by Jon in which he would play Dr. Tom ?Ramar' Reynolds, a white ?medicine' doctor in Africa. The weekly 30-minute adventure series was set in the jungles of the Dark Continent, but actually, all the scenes were filmed in locations in the United States, some of which were along the South Fork of the St. Lucie River and in other locations near Hall's Jensen Beach home. Most of the filming in Martin County took place in early 1954.\n\nWith the huge success of 'Ramar of the Jungle', Jon Hall was more in demand for movie parts in Hollywood than ever before. However, being on a national television series, which was made especially for young audiences, he had a large fan base of children. When youngsters recognized him, he was sometimes asked, \"Why aren't you in Africa?\" His reply, \"I had to fly the film back.\" The hit show generated the marketing of numerous products relating to the series, including puzzles, coloring books, toy guns, safari hats and suits, a toy village with plastic natives and animals as well as an adventure board game.\n\nUnfortunately Jon's tropical home life ended when he and Frances divorced in August 1955. She remained in Jensen Beach, but he returned to California. Jon Hall died Dec. 13, 1979, in California, but his film legacy as ?Ramar of the Jungle' will surely live on and is no doubt fondly remembered by most any boy who grew up in the 1950s."
