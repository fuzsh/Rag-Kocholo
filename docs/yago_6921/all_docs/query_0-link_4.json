        "text": "En Castellano\n\nJon Hall\n\n(1913-1979)\n\nHall was the co-star of Maria Montez in the most popular movies in Technicolor which were made between 1942 and 1945. He was born in Fresno, California (USA) on February 23rd, 1913, his real name was Charles Hall Locher, and he began his artistic career in 1935.\n\nIn some ocassions he used the name of:\n\nLloyd Crane\n\nCharles Locher\n\nHe was married with Raquel Torres and Frances Langford.\n\nBefore working with Maria, he had been the co-star of Dorothy Lamour in The Hurricane. In the 50s he was the star of a TV series called RAMAR OF THE JUNGLE, after that, he retired of the artistic activities and he became a business man. He killed himself on December 13th, 1979, in North Hollywood, California, USA.\n\nFrom:\n\nhttp://us.imdb.com/Bio?Hall,+Jon+(I)\n\nInterred at Forest Lawn (Hollywood Hills), Los Angeles, California, USA, in the Court of Liberty, same row as Buster Keaton.\n\nTo end the weakness and suffering due to cancer of the bladder, Jon Hall shot himself in the head at the age of 66.\n\nSon of actor Felix Locher.\n\nJon was married three times, two of them to entertainers: singer Frances Langford and actress Raquel Torres. His third wife was a psychiatrist whom he married in 1969. They lived in Los Angeles with her two sons and a daughter.\n\nBiography from Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia:\n\nBrawny, athletic leading man who was once crowned \"the King of Technicolor\" (his queen was Maria Montez), Hall started in films as a bit player billed under his own name. The dark-haired, handsome actor worked his way up to substantial roles in Here's to Romance, Charlie Chan in Shanghai (both 1935), The Lion Man and The Mysterious Avenger (both 1936), among others, before being cast as Dorothy Lamour's sarong-clad native lover in John Ford's The Hurricane (1937), a huge success. As Jon Hall, he became a leading man, and freelanced for several studios, appearing in South of Pago Pago, Kit Carson (both 1940), Aloma of the South Seas (1941), and Eagle Squadron (1942), before being paired with exotic Maria Montez in a Technicolor spectacle for Universal, Arabian Nights (1942). Escape-hungry wartime audiences made it a big hit, and Universal kept the Hall-Montez team together in White Savage (1943), Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Cobra Woman, GypsyWildcat (all 1944), and Sudan (1945). When the formula finally petered out, Hall's star began to wane.\n\nHe made several Westerns, among them The Vigilantes Return (1947), Deputy Marshal (1949, costarring then-wife Frances Langford), and When the Redskins Rode (1951), before starring as \"Ramar of the Jungle\" in a 1952-54 syndicated TV series, some episodes of which were cut together and released as feature films. Overweight and lethargic, he never regained his box-office standing, although he did stay in the movie business by renting out some expensive photographic equipment he'd collected over the years. He also directed one film, The Beachgirls and the Monster (1965, aka Monster from the Surf Hall married actress Raquel Torres in 1959, and shot himself to death after spending several months in bed following an operation for bladder cancer.\n\n*\n\nPICTURES\n\n*\n\nFILMOGRAPHY\n\n01.
