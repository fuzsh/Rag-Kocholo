        "text": "Frances Langford, who died on Monday aged 92, was a big band singer in a series of Hollywood musicals, but earned a special place in the hearts of American servicemen by performing in combat zones with Bob Hope during the Second World War, and later in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.\n\nKnown as the \"Florida Thrush\" because listeners were astonished that such a powerful voice could emanate from a girl of 5 ft 1 in tall, she would sweetly sing the ballad I'm in the Mood for Love in a way that reminded GIs of the girls they had left at home - and had them singing along with her. At the next moment she would switch to a rousing You are My Lucky Star, which she later claimed had led thousands of girls to drop their factory tools to try their luck in Hollywood.\n\nFor Hope, Frances Langford was one of his \"three gipsies\" (along with the bulgy-eyed comic Jerry Colonna, a singer of On the Road to Mandalay, and Tony Romano, a guitarist and arranger) who were prepared to travel anywhere with him. But there were occasions when her enthusiasm got the better of her, as when she hitched a ride in a fighter plane with a pilot who attacked a Japanese ship.\n\nHope denied that she had been seen in a clinch in the air; but, the dubiousness of the incident notwithstanding, it drew a flood of publicity which led to the pilot appearing on stage with her.\n\nSuch experiences led Frances Langford to be offered a regular column by the Hearst newspaper chain. Called \"Purple Heart Diary\", this recounted her life on tour and included interviews with such minor members of the show as Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Ricky Nelson. In 1951, she starred in a film of the same name.\n\nBut the disadvantage in later life was that she was always better known for playing herself than for any role she might be given.\n\nA carpenter's daughter, she was born Frances Newbern on April 6 1913 in Citrus County, Florida. She had hoped to become an opera singer, but dropped out of music college after a throat operation changed her voice.\n\nHer first break came in New Orleans at 16, when her mother convinced the crooner Rudy Vallee to listen to her. He invited young Frances to sing on his radio show and helped her to get a start in New York, where she was briefly in the Broadway musical Here Goes the Bride. She then moved to California, where she appeared on Louella Parsons's radio show Hollywood Hotel before making her her first film, The Subway Symphony (1932). Some 30 pictures followed, in most of which she sang and often appeared as herself.\n\nFrances Langford was in Rambling Round Radio Row No 5 (1933) with Vera Van and the Happiness Boys, and Every Night at Eight (1935), which starred George Raft. In the latter she formed a trio with Alice Faye and Patsy Kelly, and also sang I'm in the Mood for Love for the first time on film.\n\nIn the same year she sang You are my Lucky Star; Broadway Rhythm; and Hooray for Hollywood in Broadway Melody of 1936, in which she appeared alongside Jack Benny, June Knight and Robert Taylor.\n\nShe was also a vocalist on Dick Powell's weekly radio show, appeared in Palm Springs (1936), with David Niven, and Born to Dance (1936) with James Stewart and Virginia Bruce. She had the lead role in Hit Parade of 1937 (1936), and was with Buster Keaton, Johnny Weissmuller and Betty Grable in Sun-Kissed Stars at Palm Springs (1936). She then partnered Dick Powell in the screen version of his radio show, Hollywood Hotel (1937).\n\nFive years later, she made an appearance in the showy Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney, before playing the lead alongside Robert Taylor in the crime thriller Mississippi Gambler (1942), and starring in the musical western Cowboy in Manhattan (1943).\n\nAfter the war ended, Frances Langford played a singer in Beat the Band (1947) with the virtuoso drummer Gene Krupa, starred with her husband Jon Hall in the western Deputy Marshal (1949), and had a television show with Don Ameche. Her last film of note was The Glenn Miller Story (1953), in which James Stewart played the band leader.\n\nFrances Langford was married three times. Her first husband, Hall, had been married to the actress Raquel Torres. When Frances Langford's marriage to Hall broke up after some 20 years later he went back to Raquel Torres, and Frances Langford married Ralph Evinrude, a manufacturer of outboard motors.\n\nThe couple settled in Florida to start a marina, Polynesian restaurant and gift shop, the \"Frances Langford Outrigger Resort\" near her 400-acre estate at Jensen Beach.\n\nAfter her television variety programme, The Frances Langford Show, ended in 1960, she became more interested in sailing and fishing, though she would occasionally perform a few numbers at the restaurant.\n\nFollowing Evinrude's death, Frances Langford married Harold Stuart, an assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, with whom she enjoyed sailing from Florida to Canada aboard her 110 ft yacht."
