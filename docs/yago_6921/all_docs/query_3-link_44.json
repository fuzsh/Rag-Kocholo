        "text": "Forthwith, a time traveling narrative of selected interesting facts and trivial information from an era long ago, including a mini-timeline of notable events in Martin County.\n\nRoy Baker, Sheriff in ‘53\n\nIn January, 1953, Roy Baker was sworn in as the fifth sheriff of Martin County, having resigned as Stuart Chief of Police in March 1952 to seek that office, replaced by Joe Crutchfield, a highway patrolman.\n\nBefore the creation of Martin County in 1925, the region was within the boundaries of Palm Beach County, the first sheriff being George Baker in 1909, succeeded by son, Robert, neither related to Roy Baker.\n\nLangford-Hall Park\n\nA new 20-acre park on SR A1A between Rio and Jensen Beach was dedicated on Friday, Feb. 27, 1953. The famous movie and television stars, Frances Langford and husband, Jon Hall, gifted the land in 1950 on the condition that the community donate $1,000 a year to its development as a park, with required maintenance for a period of 10 years.\n\nLangford-Hall Park Association held fund-raising events to meet its monetary goal. The park featured a baseball field with bleacher seating for 2,500 spectators, completed in time for the dedication. A double-header softball game was played after the ceremony, with speeches and the Stuart High School Band in attendance to entertain the crowd of 1,000 people.\n\nStuart traffic signal, a necessity\n\nBelieve it or not, there was no traffic signal at the intersection of State Road 76 (Kanner) and U.S. 1 until March 1953.\n\nWith several previous accidents, the intersection was considered a hazard as most drivers waited impatiently to safely enter the highway. The 3-way signal was only the third traffic light for the city of Stuart.\n\nStuart Training School grads\n\nThere were only 10 graduates from Stuart Training School at ceremonies, June 2, 1953.\n\nThose receiving diplomas included: Carl Jackson, Harold Jackson, Eugene Brown, Issac Mackey, Lucille Scott, Dorothy Taylor, Lola Willis, Deborah Robertson, Emma Holland and Annie Mae Gilbert, Valedictorian.\n\nCost of post office mailbox increases\n\nEffective, July 1, 1953, by decision of the U.S. Post Office Department, the rental rate for individual mailboxes would be increased for the first time since 1907.\n\nThe 2,014 boxes in Stuart, based on size, ranged from $1.10 to $4.50 each, for a three-month rental period.\n\nStuart Chamber of Commerce Building\n\nThe Stuart Chamber of Commerce’s $15,000 newly constructed one-story building officially opened Aug. 3, 1953, at the southwest corner of U.S. 1 and 4th Street.\n\nDesigned by architect, Bert D. Keck, with landscaping provided by the Stuart Garden Club, its modern appearance featured a front facade of red brick salvaged from the demolition of the Shepard home on Frazier Creek.\n\nTown of Jupiter Island\n\nIn the early 1950s, Stuart was the only incorporated city in the county, but that situation would change with the creation of the Town of Jupiter Island, incorporated in 1953.\n\nBand director-go-round\n\nMartin County High School band director Roger Dancz resigned in 1953, to enlist in the U.S. Army, with a two-year leave agreement from the school system while he served in the military.\n\nPerry D. Alexander, 28, was hired as replacement, effective Sept.1, but submitted a resignation to the superintendent on Tuesday morning,Sept. 8, stating personal reasons. Those band students must have been a ‘pugnacious group,’ as commented by a news reporter.\n\nAlexander and wife, Marla, moved to Miami where he would work for the North Miami Water Department.\n\nA new director, 26-year-old Jerry D. Gwinn, from West Virginia, assumed the position a few weeks later, resigning in ‘54 to be replaced by Asa Duncan for the school year, 1954-‘55.\n\nHowever, upon returning to Stuart as per agreement, Roger Dancz would be reappointed band director, July 14, 1955, but he too resigned, July 19, less than a week later to accept a music professorship at the University of Georgia.\n\nDuncan was then asked to continue as director, which he accepted.\n\nCivic Center at 10th Street\n\nOpening ceremonies for a newly constructed civic center at 10th Street in East Stuart were held March 21, 1954. The $3,600 facility, opposite the baseball field, had been planned since July 1953, approved by the City Commission to provide a recreational and educational outlet for teenagers or adults.\n\nWSTU, Stuart's first radio station\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the construction permit with use of call letters WSTU, for Lester M. Combs and Reginald B. Martin, July 9, 1954, to operate a radio station in Stuart.\n\nThe offices and 150-foot transmitting tower were located on A1A north of the Roosevelt Bridge. Combs announced that the broadcast would cover the area from Fort Pierce to Jupiter Inlet, westward beyond Tropical Farms and \"plenty of sailfish\" in the ocean. Programming was to be local and “homey” dedicated to public service.\n\nThe first broadcast, 1450 AM on the radio dial, was Dec. 9, 1954 at 6 p.m., regular daily hours being 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m..\n\nNOTE: Online with this vignette is a mini-timeline covering local events 1950-1954.\n\nPart 1 of Time Traveling 1950-1954 ran last week.
