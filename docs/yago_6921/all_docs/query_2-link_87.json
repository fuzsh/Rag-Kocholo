        "text": "Jon Hall, the actor who played the hero opposite Dorothy Lamour in the original “The Hurricane,” filmed in 1937, died yesterday at his North Hollywood home of gunshot wounds that were apparently self‐inflicted, according to a spokesman in the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. Mr. Hall was 66 years old. His body was discovered by a sister, who said that the actor had been under treatment for cancer.\n\nThe actor was known for his roles in films with jungle or South Pacific themes. He made his movie debut in 1935 in “Charlie Chan in Shanghai,” but his first major role was in “The Hurricane,” the Samuel Goldwyn film that made him a star.\n\nMr. Hall later starred with Maria Montez in a number of adventure films at Universal, among them “Arabian Nights,” “White Savage,” “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” “Gypsy Wildcat” and “Sudan.” His other films included “Eagle Squadron,” made in 1942, and the 1944 musical “Lady in the Dark,” starring Ginger Rogers. Mr. Hall also played the title role in “Ramar of the Jungle,” a 1950's television series.\n\nThe actor was born in Fresno, Calif., as Charles Loeher, and grew up in Tahiti, the son of an ice‐skating champion and Tahitian woman whom he once described as a descendant of Tahiti's royal family. Asked just after the opening of “The Hurricane” about his plans for the future, he said: “Well, I want to keep making pictures, of course. About one a year. That will take six months’ hard work. And then I would like to get a boat, and collect load of congenial friends, and sail to Tahiti for six months. That would be the perfect life.”"
