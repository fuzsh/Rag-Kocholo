        "text": "About Frances Langford\n\nFrances Newbern Langford\n\nBorn: April 4, 1913 Lakeland, FL\n\nDied: July 11, 2005 Jensen Beach, FL\n\nFrances Langford was a successful singer and entertainer during the \"Golden Age of Radio, who went on to star in several movies and travel the world with Bob Hope and the USO entertaining the troops. Born Julia Langford, she originally trained as an opera singer, but as a young girl she required surgery on her throat, and as a result was forced to change her vocal style to a more contemporary big band, popular music style.\n\nFrances attended Lakeland High School and later Southern College. She has one brother, James and a sister, Alma. Frances began singing for radio during the early 1930s, and while singing at a local Tampa Bay radio station in 1931, band leader Rudy Vallee invited her to become a guest on his radio show, where she made her first national broadcast in New Orleans. Through Vallees show, she began to establish a following and win acclaim in the Vaudeville scene, even earning a contract with staion WOR in New York. After graduation from Southern College, Frances signed with NBC.\n\nAfter a brief stint in the Broadway musical \"Here Goes the Bride\" in 1931, she moved to Hollywood. Frances made her first appearance on the silver screen in the1932 musical short, The Subway Symphony. She made her film debut in Every Night at Eight in 1935, co-starring with Alice Faye. It was in this film that she introduced what would become her signature song, \"I'm In The Mood For Love\".\n\nFrom there, she began appearing frequently in films including Broadway Melody of 1936, The Collegiate, Palm Springs, Born to Dance and Busby Berkeleys Hollywood Hotel.\n\nWhile working in Hollywood, Frances continued as a radio star, regularly performing on Dick Powell's radio show from 1935 until 1938.\n\nFrances married her first husband, actor Jon Hall, in Prescott, Arizona on June 4, 1938. Jon was the part-Tahitian nephew of James Norman Hall, the co-author of the book \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". His film debut was in John Ford's The Hurricane, based on another book by Charles Nordoff and James Hall.\n\nOn January 4, 1939, Frances was signed to the Texaco Star Theater. As she rose to fame, Frances became one of the first recording stars signed to Decca records. She recorded a number of Hapa Haole numbers backed by Hawaiian musicians. Other Decca artists included: Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, the Andrews Sisters, and Judy Garland.\n\nIn 1940, Frances was cast in the film version of the George Abbot Broadway Musical, Too Many Girls, starring Lucille Ball, Eddie Barcken, Richard Carlson and Ann Miller.\n\nThe Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts\n\nIn 1941, Frances replaced Judy Garland on Bob Hopes radio show and during World War II she performed frequently with Hope entertaining the troops. The tours began stateside but soon expanded to Great Britain followed by Africa and then Italy. Bob Hope referred to Frances as, one of his three gypsies, along with comic Jerry Colonna and guitarist Tony Romano. Even with her hair swept up in a bandanna, the singer was a glamorous vision of home and became known as the \"Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts.\" Although frightened at times, being in combat zones, she always said that the greatest thing in her life was entertaining the troops. In an interview with the Palm Beach Post in 2000 she explained, Id sing a song, and I could just see the guys getting this far-away expression. I knew they were going home in their minds.\n\nIn 1942, Frances starred in Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney, in which she performed the popular song \"Over There\".\n\nIn 1944 she toured the Pacific Theater with Hope and in Feb 1944, while on Guadalcanal, she met Lt. Col. Robert Westy Westbrook. While celebrities were forbidden from getting rides in fighter planes, he managed to fit tiny Frances (just over 5 ft. tall) in the rear of his P-38 cockpit and took her for a ride.\n\nOn August 14, 1944, Frances and a number of entertainers including Hope, Colonna and dancer Patty Thomas, were onboard a Catalina flying boat returning to Sydney, Australia from Guam when the plane experienced mechanical problems. The pilot ordered the passengers to jettison their luggage to lighten the aircraft. Among the baggage thrown out were their wardrobes and several crates of whiskey. The plane landed safely on the Camden Haven River near the small town of Laurieton, Australia.\n\nHer association with Bob Hope and the USO continued through the Korean and Vietnam wars. In 1989, she once again joined Hope for a USO tour.\n\nAfter the war ended, Langford wrote a daily newspaper column, \"Purple Heart Diary,\" about her war experiences and later starred in a movie of the same name. Frances worked for several years on Spike Jones' Chase and Sanborn Show before being teamed with Don Ameche in 1951 for a shortlived television program, The Frances Langford/Don Ameche Show, which was spawned off of their successful radio series The Bickersons (where the duo played a feuding couple similar to Ralph and Alice Kramden of The Honeymooners).\n\nLangford was also the host of two self titled variety television programs: Frances Langford Presents, in 1959 and the Frances Langford Show in 1960.\n\nA Polynesian Paradise\n\nAlthough Langford and her husband Jon Hall purchased land in Jensen Beach, FL and began developing the retreat that would become the Outrigger Resort, the couple divorced on August 27, 1955, before the resort was built.\n\nFrances married for the second time on Oct 5, 1955, taking outboard motor heir Ralph Evinrude as her husband. Ralph was the son of Ole Evinrude, creator of the first mass marketed outboard motor. Following his fathers death in 1934, Ralph took the reins of the company as president at the age of 27. During World War II, Ralph put in 12 to 14 hour days managing the companys production of war equipment. Ralph and Frances met while she was singing in a nightclub in Milwaukee and were married on his 118-foot yacht named Chanticleer at Port Washington, NY. The couple traveled extensively and the yacht was their second home.\n\nAfter retiring from Hollywood, Frances dreamed of transforming her 57-acre plot of land in Jensen Beach, FL into a Polynesian paradise. She and Ralph met with Ed Lawrence, a noted designer of Polynesian effects and creator of the Don the Beachcomber restaurants, and convinced him to design her resort. Frances and Ralph opened the Outrigger Resort in Jensen Beach, FL in 1961.\n\nThe Outrigger Resort featured 27 rental units, a 26 slip marina and a Polynesian style restaurant and bar, where Langford frequently performed. Evinrude died in 1986.\n\nPhilanthropic Local Legend In 1994 Frances married Harold Stuart, who had been assistant secretary of the United States Air Force under President Harry S. Truman. The celebration took place on Hutchinson Island and was attended by Bob Hope. She and Harold spent much of their time on her yacht Chanticleer.\n\nIn 2002, Frances Langford was inducted into Floridas State Womens Hall of Fame.\n\nHere in Martin County, Frances Langford was a local hero and philanthropist. She supported many worthy causes in the area including donating the land and paying for improvements at Langford Park in Jensen Beach. She generously supported such causes as The Historical Society of Martin County, Martin Memorial Medical Center, and The Florida Oceanographic Society. She foot the bill for the local 4th of July fireworks celebration numerous times and was the yearly Grand Marshall for the Boat Parade, always leading the procession in her yacht the Chanticleer. She died at her Jensen Beach, FL home after suffering from congestive heart failure, at age 92.\n\nFrances Langford has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
