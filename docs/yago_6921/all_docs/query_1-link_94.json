        "text": "Frances Langford, whose steamy rendition of I'm in the Mood for Love captivated American soldiers when she was part of Bob Hope's USO tours during World War II, died today at the age of 92.\n\nLangford had been ill with congestive heart failure and died at her home in Jensen Beach, said her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr.\n\nLangford, a recording artist, radio star and actress from the 1930s to 1950s, joined Hope's troupe to boost wartime morale at military bases and hospitals in Great Britain, Italy, North Africa and the South Pacific. She also entertained new generations of soldiers in Korea and Vietnam.\n\nEven with her hair swept up in a bandanna, the 1.55-meter tall singer was a glamorous vision of home and became known as the Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts.\n\nHer trademark was I'm in the Mood for Love, written for her for the 1935 movie Every Night at Eight.\n\nLangford appeared in 30 Hollywood movies, including Broadway Melody, Yankee Doodle Dandy and The Hit Parade. She played herself in her final film, 1954's The Glenn Miller Story.\n\nShe was also known for her role as the insufferable wife, Blanche, opposite Don Ameche on the popular 1940s radio comedy The Bickersons.\n\nShe recalled in interviews decades later that entertaining the troops \"was the greatest thing in my life.\"\n\n\"We were there just to do our job, to help make them laugh and be happy if they could,\" Langford told The Associated Press in January 2002.\n\n\"She was a charming person, very warm-hearted,\" said Crary, who had known her for more than 70 years. \"She was very interested in other people and appreciative of their interest in her.\"\n\nLangford was born April 4, 1913, in Lakeland, her family said. She was discovered by bandleader Rudy Vallee when he was in Florida for a performance, and he invited her to be a guest on his radio program.\n\nAfter a brief stint in the Broadway musical Here Goes the Bride in 1931, she moved to Hollywood, where she appeared on Louella Parsons' radio show Hollywood Hotel and began to appear in movies.\n\nShe was singing on Hope's Pepsodent Show when he held his first military program at March Field in Riverside, California, in 1941. The response was so positive he continued broadcasting from training bases and asked Langford to join him. Soon there were enough soldiers overseas to bring his variety show to them.\n\nLangford wrote a daily newspaper column, Purple Heart Diary, about her war experiences and later starred in a movie of the same name.\n\nHer first marriage was to actor Jon Hall, who appeared in films such as The Hurricane and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.\n\nAfter World War II, she was singing in nightclubs when she met outboard motor heir Ralph Evinrude. They married in 1955 and moved to her 160-hectare estate in Jensen Beach, 160 kilometers north of Miami.\n\nThe couple built a Polynesian-themed restaurant and marina on the Indian River called the Outrigger Resort. She entertained locals and celebrities, including Hope, until Evinrude died in 1986 and she sold the property.\n\nLangford kept up her pastimes of boating and sport fishing and her collection of mounted tuna, marlin and other fish adorns the wall of the Florida Oceanographic Society's visitor center in nearby Stuart that is named after her.\n\nIn 1994, she married Harold Stuart, assistant secretary of the Air Force under Harry Truman. They spent summers on Canada's Georgian Island, travelling from Florida aboard her 34-meter yacht.\n\nShe is survived by her husband. She had no children.\n\n- AP"
