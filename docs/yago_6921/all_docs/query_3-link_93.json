        "text": "Attention Seniors!! Civics Exam Study Guide!\n\nIn 2017, the Alabama Legislature passed a law that requires public high school seniors to pass an American civics test as part of the requirements for graduation. Pursuant to statutory requirements, the test questions are the 100 questions about American history and government on which the U.S. citizenship and naturalization exam is based. Graduating Seniors must answer 60 test questions correctly in order to pass, and students may take the test as many times as necessary. The test is scheduled at AHS to be taken during the first two days of the academic year.\n\nThis study guide is designed to prepare you for the civics test. See below for the link.\n\nClick here for the Civics Exam Study Guide.\n\nPSAT/NMSQT\n\nAttention 11th and 10th graders! The PSAT / NMSQT is administered once per academic year at AHS. This yearâ€™s test is scheduled for Saturday, October 26, 2024, 8:00 a.m. until noon. As a reminder, only current 11th graders are eligible to qualify for the National Merit Scholarship Program. Payment and registration may be made via My School Bucks; the cost is $30.00. The deadline for payment and registration is Sunday, September 1, 11:59 p.m. CST. Note: The online payment serves as your registration.\n\nPlease see below the QR code that has the direct link to the fee for this test:\n\nPowerSchool Parent App\n\nAttention AHS Parents! If you are experiencing issues with the PowerSchool Parent app, it may well be time to reset your password. You will need to log into the web-based Parent portal (using a browser window), reset your password there, and then the app should work again. Should you still continue to experience issues, delete the app from your cell phone and then load it again. Please note that for a more complete and informative experience in the Parent Portal, parents should use the URL to access the Parent Portal and not the app. The app does not work as well as the website. Thank you for your patience."
