        "text": "Frances Langford, who has died aged 91, was one of the last links with the Glenn Miller band. She was also one of the dwindling number of singers from the big band era - certainly one of the last from an age when big swing outfits would go into a loud, brassy routine and then, as the notes subsided, a girl in a glittering dress, with its swinging skirt, would walk to the microphone and warble a chorus or two of Moonlight Serenade or It's Magic, while dancers smooched as they almost listened.\n\nBut Langford was different in several ways. For one thing, she could act, or at least could be called on to act. For another, she kept going into her 80s - if not singing, then talking about the people with whom she had once sung. Not just Miller, but Dick Powell, Rudy Vallee, the Les Brown Band and, above all, Bob Hope - with whom she performed to troops in the second world war, Korea and Vietnam, and, with whom, on more than one occasion, came under enemy fire.\n\n\"The most exciting, the most rewarding, the most thrilling days of my life,\" she once told me. \"There is nothing, but nothing, like an audience of fighting men. Even if you didn't always sing the music they loved at home - and Vietnam was in the middle of the rock era, and I was not - they appreciated you as coming from home.\"\n\nLangford was born Frances Newbern in Lakeland, Florida, and from the moment she first stepped in front of a band, she became known as the Florida Thrush. She originally hoped to go into opera, but a throat operation while she was still a teenager changed her voice.\n\nShe made her first professional appearance in 1930, at the age of 16, on a tiny local radio station at Tampa, Florida, and was heard by Vallee, one of America's first crooners - a cult figure, whose principal gimmick in those pre-microphone days was to sing into a large horn. He promptly offered the young Frances a spot on his networked radio show.\n\nIt was the first link in a chain that led to stardom, both on and off the dance-band platform. In the George Raft-Alice Faye film, Every Night At Eight (1935), Langford was seen singing I'm In The Mood For Love. Movie producers decided they were in the mood to see and hear more of this 5ft 1in-tall girl with the rounded face. She was not conventionally pretty - her eyes could look a little too far apart and her mouth too large - but her voice was made for a film age that specialised in her kind of velvet singing style.\n\nSimultaneously with making films like I'll Reach For A Star and Hollywood Hotel (both 1937), the same year Langford was starring regularly in Dick Powell's radio show, also called Hollywood Hotel. Altogether, she was to make 28 films, usually appearing as herself or as someone very much like her. Among them were Romance And Rhythm, Dreaming Out Loud and Too Many Girls (all 1940), All American Co-Ed (1941) and Danger On The River (1942).\n\nHer really big film break came with James Cagney's epic biography of George M Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), in which Langford joined Cagney in a war-bond-selling scene, singing Over There. The film was followed by Combat America!, Never A Dull Moment and Irving Berlin's all-soldier show, This Is The Army (all 1943). Then, between 1943 and 1946, came a virtual catalogue of the smallish musicals so popular with wartime audiences, in Britain as well as America: Cowboy In Manhattan, Career Girl, Girl Rush, Dixie Jamboree, Radio Stars On Parade and People Are Funny.\n\nLangford's last movie appearance was one of her most memorable - singing with the filmed version of the US army air force band in the hit 1954 biopic, The Glenn Miller Story. It seemed to give the wrong impression that she and Miller were regular colleagues, but that did not matter, since it also gave the perfectly accurate impression that entertaining troops was the most important thing Langford felt she could do.\n\nHer appearances with Bob Hope started in 1941, the year of Pearl Harbor, when he first began his troop concerts, and she started appearing regularly on his radio show. She toured the war zones in Africa and Italy before going with Hope to the Pacific. She also caused a storm by hitch ing a ride in a P38 Lightning fighter, something strictly against military rules - especially when the plane went into action, strafing a beached Japanese ship.\n\nLangford was a regular guest on the Spike Jones radio show in the late 1940s and early 50s, and briefly co-hosted an early television programme, The Frances Langford-Don Ameche Show (1951-52); in the 1940s, she had played the insufferable wife, Blanche, in their radio show, The Bickersons. In 1960 came her own Frances Langford Show, and she had an NBC radio show called Drene Time, named after a popular American hair shampoo of the 1940s.\n\nLangford was also a successful businesswoman. She owned the Frances Langford Outrigger Resort, at Jensen Beach, Florida, where she gave live performances after finishing her concert tours in the mid-1960s.\n\nShe was married three times: to actor Jon Hall, from 1938 to 1955; to Ralph Evinrude, from 1955 until his death in 1986; and to Harold Stuart, assistant secretary of the air force under President Harry Truman, whom she married in 1994 and who survives her."
