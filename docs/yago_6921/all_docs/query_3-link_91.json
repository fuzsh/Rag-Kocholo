        "text": "Each month, a new route is organized around Sconce and Devon and Vicar Water Country Park. Participants can bask in the sunshine and explore the parks’ natural environments, while Park Rangers share fascinating insights about the nature and wildlife that can be spotted. Discover what this season brings to the area and get answers to any questions about the incredible biodiversity and wildlife that thrive here.\n\nThe guided walks offer a fantastic chance for anyone eager to learn more about the nature and wildlife in the district. Whether you’re already well-versed in the local environment or just beginning to explore it, expert Rangers will ensure everyone discovers something new! They are also a great way to stay updated on park events and developments, ensuring local communities remain well-informed and engaged.\n\nCouncillor Emma Oldham, Portfolio Holder for Biodiversity and Environmental Services at Newark and Sherwood District Council said: “These guided walks are such a wonderful addition to Sconce and Devon and Vicar Water Country Park and summer is the perfect time to embrace the lovely weather and enjoy our beautiful natural surroundings.”\n\n“These walks not only allow us to connect with nature but also to learn about the incredible biodiversity and wildlife that thrives in our parks, they make such a great space for our health and wellbeing, whether it’s through socialising, relaxing or just for exercising.”\n\n“Our Park Rangers are incredibly knowledgeable about our parks, and I really encourage everyone to join these guided walks. It’s a great opportunity to learn from them, connect with nature, and enjoy some fresh air while getting active!”\n\nTo cover a variety of routes in both parks, and to suit a range of residents, the walks will rotate in length from short, to medium to long each month.\n\nGuided walks at Sconce and Devon Park will take place on the first Tuesday of every month, while Vicar Water Country Park’s walks are on the third Tuesday of every month, both from 9am to 10.30am. Everyone will meet at each park by the Park Ranger’s office next to the Rumbles Café. To take part, booking is required through the Council’s website:\n\nSconce and Devon Park: www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/sconceanddevon\n\nVicar Water Country Park: www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/vicarwater\n\nVicar Water Country Park has been recognised as a Green Flag Award-winning Park for a number of years and is located in Clipstone on the site of a former colliery. Over the years the park has transformed into a thriving green space for visitors to enjoy, with an abundance of biodiversity and wildlife too. The heathland, woodland and grassland, and lake all provide homes and food for a variety of wildlife, including kingfishers, herons, water scorpions, frogs and newts, emperor dragonflies, green woodpeckers, and more.\n\nSconce and Devon Park, also a Green Flag Award winner, is Newark’s largest open space and home to a variety of habitats including riverside, pastures, woodlands, grasslands and an orchard. Although some rare plant species, such as the flowering rush, are found in the park, the greatest feature is the diverse range of species within such a small area. The area is rich in a variety of plant life from tall oaks to small herbs and grasses. Butterflies and dragonflies are in abundance. A range of birds including kingfishers, swans and thrushes can be spotted."
