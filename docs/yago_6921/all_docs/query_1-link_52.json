        "text": "Joseph P. Yozzo\n\nJoe Yozzo was born in Rome, NY, and began performing music in 1933. His first teacher was the legendary Enstacio\n\nPinti, director of the Rome White Band. Initially playing tuba, Joe switched to string bass in 1939.\n\nIn 1943 Joe Yozzo went into the Army.

Joe has also played for 26 shows with Jack Benny and sat in with such bands as Glenn Miller, Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Frankie Carl, and Les Brown.\n\nJoe continued to perform after his discharge from the military until 1960, when, shattered by the loss of his 11-month-old son, he put down his string bass. Urged on by Rocky Cole and Patti Page, Joe began performing again. He played bass with Johnny Salerno’s band for 36 years, and eventually performed with the Sal Alberico band and the No Name Band. As Joe says, “Music has been a lot of my life, and I have made a lot of good friends over the years.”\n\nJo Ann Krant Geller\n\nJo Ann Geller was born in Chester, Pennsylvania and graduated from Chester High School.

But upon hearing a missionary speaker, she discarded her plan and completed her education as a teacher.\n\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University in 1900, Welthy became a teacher at Rosebud College, a one-room school in Haverstraw, New York, where she was in charge of 15 students. She sailed to China in 1906 and became the headmistress of the Bao Lin School in Nanchang Province, which was the only school for girls in the province of 45 million people. She was committed to the idea of women’s independence and she encouraged her girls to develop into new, modern Chinese women, often against the wishes of their traditional parents. She returned to the United States in 1917 and became a YWCA war worker and the editor of World Neighbors, a Methodist mission magazine.\n\nIn 1924 she married Frederick Bohn Fisher. Both the Fishers were well respected by Gandhi and other prominent leaders of the Indian Independence Movement. Upon his death in 1938, she wrote his biography and studied educational systems throughout the world. She lectured throughout the U.S. on women of the world and Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. Six weeks before his death in 1947, Gandhi asked her to return to India and continue her work on education in India’s villages. At the age of 73, she returned to India in 1952 to work with Frank Laubach, Christian Evangelical missionary and literacy pioneer. Deciding that literacy training linked with agricultural and industrial development was a key strategy to eradicate poverty; Welthy broke with Laubach and founded Literacy House at Allahabad. In 1956, Literacy house moved to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where it became famous for its effectiveness and its House of Prayer for All People.\n\nWelthy and her fellow literacy pioneers started two non-profit organizations, World Education and World Literacy in Canada. She was closely involved in both organizations for many years, either as President or an advisor. Throughout her nineties she traveled throughout the world and made her final trip to India as a government guest in 1980, shortly before her death at the age of 101. Fisher was honored by the Indian government, which based its village literacy programs on her ideas, and issued a stamp in her likeness.\n\nJane Taylor\n\nJane Grace Taylor holds a Masters in Illustration from Syracuse University. She taught at Rome Free Academy for\n\nmany years.

She teaches workshops and classes at the Rome Art and Community Center and the Kirkland Art Center.\n\nShe is treasurer of the Central New York Watercolor Society, President of the Rome Art Association, long time member of the Sumi-e Society of America, the Utica Art Association, and Artists of Mohawk Valley. She is active in three forms of Martial Arts, a black belt in American Karate, a black belt in Aikido, and has begun training in Iaido (Japanese Sword).
