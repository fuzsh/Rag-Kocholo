        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by PsychFugue\n\nI spent most of my life growing up in Jensen Besch, I witnessed firsthand how the system worked when we completed the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for Martin County as mandated by the State of Florida in 1978.. it was designed to control growth.. its since been manipulated by developers who care less about the area, just profits..\n\n\n\nI like the controlled growth approach to things in Martin County but at the same time I don't understand the strong resistance to some projects.\n\nCurrently Pitchford's Landing is occupied by RV's that in my opinion don't look great and presumably add traffic to the community. Then there was a plan to replace the RV park with nice single family homes and townhouses. On the net I don't see how the new development adds significantly to area traffic since it's replacing the RV's and it would add nicer homes to the community, yet the project faced significant resistance.\n\nI've also noticed several of the old motels in Jensen have been converted into drug rehab centers. If the community was a little more developer friendly could the community have had nice homes built instead of drug rehab centers occupying the old dated motel buildings?\n\nThen there is the City of Ocean Breeze that the community was terrified would be taken over by developers when it went into bankruptcy. Instead we get a community of manufactured homes built tightly on top of each other. The new manufactured homes look better than the old mobile homes but the way they are all built on top of each other doesn't look great. It looks like the houses you used to stack tightly together on the Monopoly board game. Maybe if they get some nice landscaping between the homes the appearance will improve.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by runswithscissors\n\nAlrighty then.\n\nEven though ONE PERSON, a C list celebrity, thinking she had the right to \"keep HER piece of paradise in perpetuity\" is the definition of GREED.\n\nAnd if she wanted to do that, she had legal vehicles to do so. But she didn't. She CHOSE to sell the property and put the money towards the trust in her name - a LEGACY.\n\nSo who's \"GREEDY\"?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Frances Langford did much more than sell a piece of property and reportedly used many different vehicles to accomplish her goal of supporting her community. You may not agree with all of them but your broad brush view of her generosity does not appear to be supported by fact and comes across as decidedly mean spirited:\n\nFrances Langford married three times. Her first husband (1934–55) was actor Jon Hall. In 1948, they donated 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land near her estate in Jensen Beach, Florida, to the Martin County Board of County Commissioners, which named it Langford Hall Park. Located at 2369 N.E. Dixie Highway, just south of the Stuart Welcome Arch, it is known today simply as Langford Park and is one of the county's major parks.[4]\n\nIn 1946, Langford was honored by the hometown of her youth, Lakeland, Florida, for her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) and her music and acting career. The City of Lakeland dedicated the Lake Mirror Promenade as the Frances Langford Promenade. The Promenade was originally built in 1928 and was designed by renowned landscape architect Charles W. Leavitt of New York.\n\nAfter leaving Hollywood life, she kept up her pastimes of boating and sport fishing. As a nightclub singer in 1955, she married Outboard Marine Corporation President Ralph Evinrude. They lived on her estate in Jensen Beach and built a Polynesian-themed restaurant and marina on the Indian River they named The Frances Langford Outrigger Resort, where Langford frequently performed. Locals and celebrities flocked to the site. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, she married Harold C. Stuart, who had served as Assistant Secretary for Civil Affairs of the United States Air Force (1949–51) under President Harry S. Truman. They spent the summers at Baie Fine in Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada. They journeyed to the Bay, from their home in Florida aboard their 110-foot yacht \"The Chanticleer\", which was a popular tourist attraction when moored at the Outrigger Resort. Stuart survived Langford (who had no children) and died in 2007 at the age of 94.\n\nLangford was a supportive member of the Jensen Beach community and constantly donated money to the community. She was a great philanthropist and her generosity to the Florida Oceanographic Society located on Hutchinson Island, Stuart, Florida was well known. The site provides education and research of the ocean, reefs and environment in the Florida area. The visitor's center bears her name and also houses some of her artifacts. Her collection of mounted tuna, marlin and other fish adorn the walls."
