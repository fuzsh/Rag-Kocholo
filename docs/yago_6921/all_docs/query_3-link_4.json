        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Charles Locher in Fresno, California, on February 26, 1915, matinee idol Jon Hall was raised in Tahiti and educated in England and his father's native Switzerland. He stumbled into an acting career while in his late teens and signed a contract with Warner Bros. after being spotted in a play in 1934. While the Warner Bros. contract went nowhere, he landed a supporting role in his first film, the poverty row romance Women Must Dress (1935; with Minna Gombel) using his real name. More programmers followed, including Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935; with Warner Oland) and The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937; with Karen Morley). With the production of his first important film The Hurricane (1937; with Dorothy Lamour), he changed it to Jon Hall. In June 1938, Hall married popular radio singer Frances Langford. In the early 1940s, Hall's career gained further momentum at Universal; he starred alongside Maria Montez in six Technicolor fantasies, including Arabian Nights (1942; Universal's first three-strip Technicolor production), White Savage (1943), and Cobra Woman (1944). Wildly popular with war-weary audiences, the press dubbed Hall and Maria Montez the King and Queen of Technicolor.\n\nLEFT and CENTER A: Beefcake photos of Jon Hall. CENTER B: With first wife Frances Langford at Ciros in 1954. RIGHT: Being interviewed by William Lundigan during a film premiere in the 1940s\n\nAlthough induction into the Army threatened to derail Hall's career momentum, he was discharged after six months due to gall bladder problems. Unfortunately, much like old Technicolor stock, after the end of World War II Hall's career began to fade, along with that of Maria Montez. Other wartime movie stars suffered similar fates. Nonetheless, he continued to work, mostly in westerns and jungle adventure films. From 1952 to 1954, he starred in the syndicated TV series Ramar of the Jungle, which proved very popular with children. In addition to owning the show, Hall also profited from prolific merchandising. Several Ramar films followed, which were merely spliced episodes of the series. After the show ended, Hall mostly concentrated on business interests rather than acting.\n\nthe films of jon hall\n\nThe Lion Man (1936)\n\nFrom the low-budget adventure The Lion Man\n\nThe Hurricane (1937)\n\nLEFT: Hall as Terangi in the action romance The Hurricane, perhaps Hall's best film.

CENTER and RIGHT: With Peter Lorre\n\nThe Beach Girls and the Monster (1965)\n\nFrom Hall's last film, The Beach Girls and the Monster\n\nlater years\n\nHall's marriage to singer Frances Langford ended in 1955 after 17 years of marriage, yet they parted friends. After the cancellation of his TV series Ramar of the Jungle, Hall put his film career on the back burner, focusing instead on his photographic equipment business that specialized in underwater cameras. His business venture proved very successful, as he rented underwater equipment to film studios and occasionally supervised underwater sequences. Hall considered marrying starlet Carol Brewster in the late 1950s, but in February 1959, he married the beautiful 1930s Mexican actress Raquel Torres, who was then the widow of producer Stephen Ames. The couple had a rocky marriage and divorced in 1963, remarried, and divorced again in 1967. In 1964, he began production on his final film, The Beach Girls and the Monster, a film in which he acted and also is credited with directing. He married once more, in 1969, but this marriage ended as well. By the late 1970s, Hall was suffering from bladder cancer; to end his pain, he took his own life on December 15, 1979, at the age of 64. He was survived by his sister, with whom he was living."
