        "text": "What is a Dwarf Galaxy?\n\nDwarf galaxies are appropriately named. Regular galaxies can be hundreds of light-years in diameter, but dwarf galaxies are typically just a fraction of the size. For example, our own Milky Way is a pretty average-sized galaxy; it’s about 100,000 light-years across and is thought to contain more than 100 billion stars.\n\nIt’s still believed they form when larger galaxies interact with one another, but rather than being the cores of galaxies that lose the tug-of-war, it’s thought they’re formed from stars that were originally a part of a galaxy’s general population.\n\nAs the two galaxies slowly pass each other in space, their interaction causes streams of stars to be pulled away from their host galaxy. These stars then cluster together to form the dwarf galaxy.\n\nSo what makes the Canis Major dwarf galaxy stand out from the crowd?\n\nIs the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy Actually Galactic?\n\nThe Canis Major dwarf galaxy isn’t the largest of the dwarf satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way. That honor belongs to Antlia II, a dwarf galaxy roughly 9,500 light-years in diameter and over 400,000 light-years away.\n\nThat particular dwarf galaxy wasn’t discovered until 2018 and prior to that, the largest known dwarf galaxy was the Sagittarius Dwarf. Discovered in 1994, the Sagittarius Dwarf is about 8,500 light-years in diameter and is located over 65,000 light-years away.\n\nThe Sagittarius Dwarf orbits the galaxy at a distance of about 50,000 light-years and has completed at least ten orbits in its lifetime. During that time, it’s thought the dwarf galaxy has disrupted stars at the heart of the Milky Way, sparked star formation, and may even be responsible for the Milky Way’s spiral arms.\n\nOn the plus side, northern hemisphere observers have access to M79, a magnitude 8 globular in the constellation Lepus, the Hare. You can find it within the same binocular field of view as both Nihal (Beta Leporis) and Epsilon Leporis, but you’ll need a telescope to track it down.\n\nAll this being said, the Canis Major dwarf galaxy is not without its controversy, as its status as a dwarf galaxy has been called into question. More specifically, it’s also known as the Canis Major Overdensity, as some astronomers believe these stars don’t form a dwarf galaxy at all but are part of a warped section of the galactic disc instead.\n\nEither way, time is running out, as it will eventually merge with our own galaxy, and the stars that once formed it will become citizens of the Milky Way. As spectacular as this sounds, if you’d like to see this for yourself you’re out of luck, as it won’t be happening for another billion years or so!"
