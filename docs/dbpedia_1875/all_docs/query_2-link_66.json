        "text": "Baby Boom Galaxy is a Starbust / Emission-Line Galaxy located in the constellation of Sextans in the equatorial region. Baby Boom Galaxy is not a Messier Object and doesn't have a Messier Number. The galaxy is separate and distinct, not in Milky Way galaxy or The Solar System.\n\nNothing indicates Exoplanets with or without Alien life forms orbiting any of the many stars the galaxy has. No one has ever travelled to or sent a probe to Baby Boom Galaxy, as the galaxy is too far away for current technology. No one will probably ever visit the galaxy unless they could create a Wormhole, given the distance involved.\n\nWhen we observe the Baby Boom Galaxy, we are not looking at it as it currently appears but as it used to appear millions or billions of years ago, given how long light to reach us from there.\n\nBaby Boom Galaxy Facts and Figures\n\nKey Facts\n\nName:\n\nBaby Boom Galaxy\n\nType:\n\nStarbust / Emission-Line Galaxy\n\nConstellation:\n\nSextans\n\nRight Ascension (R.A.) :\n\n10 00 54.52\n\nDeclination:\n\n+02 34 35.2 (Dec.)\n\nRadial Velocity (km/s):\n\n280963\n\nSources and Dates\n\nSource\n\n: Simbad\n\nModified Date:\n\n24thJuly 2024\n\nPublished Date:\n\n31st March 2023"
