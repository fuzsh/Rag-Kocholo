        "text": "On this page, some pictures and background info on our Milky Way galaxy and its companions. This information is nowhere near complete, was collected from various sources on the internet (e.g. the picture-of-the-day archive and the Anglo-Australian Observatory) and is provided ``as is''. Note that most pictures are copyrighted.\n\nA fisheye view of the Southern Sky\n\nCredit and Copyright: G. Garradd\n\nFrom horizon to horizon, the night sky above Loomberah, New South Wales, Australia was photographed by astronomer Gordon Garradd on March 22, 1996. Garradd used a home made all-sky camera with a fish-eye lens, resulting in a circular 200 degree field of view. This gorgeous sky view is dominated by the luminous band of the Milky Way cut by dramatic, dark interstellar dust clouds. Along with the bright stars of our Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud is visible at the upper right (about 1 o'clock) and the long, lovely, bluish tail of comet Hyakutake can be seen toward the bottom of the image, near the bright star Arcturus. Bright city lights from nearby Tamworth glow along the Northwestern horizon.\n\nThe Milky Way Galaxy - A spiral galaxy, type SBbc, centered in Sagittarius\n\nCredit: W. Keel (U. Alabama in Tuscaloosa), Cerro Tololo, Chile\n\nThe sky toward the center of our Galaxy is filled with a wide variety of celestial wonders. Most are visible with only binoculars. Constellations of nearby stars include Sagittarius, Libra, Scorpius, Scutum, and Ophiuchus. This regions contains many nebulae, open clusters and globular clusters. It also contains Baade's Window.\n\nThe Milky Way is the galaxy which homes our Solar System together with at least 200 billion other stars and their planets, and thousands of clusters and nebulae including at least almost all objects of Messier's catalog which are not galaxies on their own (the only possible exception may be M54 which may belong to SagDEG, a small galaxy which is currently in a close encounter with the Milky Way, and thus our closest known intergalactic neighbor). All the objects in the Milky Way Galaxy orbit their common center of mass, called the Galactic Center (see below).\n\nAs a galaxy, the Milky Way is actually a giant, as its mass is probably between 750 billion and one trillion solar masses, and its diameter is about 100,000 light years. Radio astronomial investigations of the distribution of hydrogene clouds have revealed that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy of Hubble type Sb or Sc. Recent evidence, particularly from the DIRBE instrument aboard COBE, convincingly shows our galaxy to be a barred (SB) rather than a regular spiral (S).\n\nCredit: COBE/DIRBE - NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nAs we are situated within the outer regions of this galaxy, only about 20 light years above the equatorial symmetry plane but about 28,000 light years from the Galactic Center, the Milky Way shows up as luminous band spanning all around the sky along this symmetry plane, which is also called the \"Galactic Equator\". Its center lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, but very close to the border of both neighbor constellations Scorpius and Ophiuchus. The distance of 28,000 light years has recently been confirmed by the data of ESA's astrometric satellite Hipparcos.\n\nMilky Way pictures are wide-field exposures. Besides being attractive and often colorful, they are often suited to view the Milky Way objects (including nebulae and star clusters) in their celestial surroundings of field stars.\n\nBelow we give some data for the Galactic Center:\n\nRight ascension 17 : 45.6 (h:m) Declination -28 : 56 (d:m) Distance 28 (kly) The Galactic North Pole is at: Right ascension 12 : 51.4 (h:m) Declination +27 : 07 (d:m)\n\nOur Sun, together with the whole Solar System, is orbiting the Galactic Center at the distance given, on a nearly circular orbit. We are moving at about 250 km/sec, and need about 220 million years to complete one orbit (so the Solar System has orbited the Galactic Center about 20 to 21 times since its formation about 4.6 billion years ago).\n\nConsidering the sense of rotation, the Galaxy, at the Sun's position, is rotating toward the direction of Right Ascension 21:12.0, Declination +48:19. This shows that it rotates \"backward\" in the Galactic coordinate system, i.e. the Galactic North Pole is actually a physical South Pole with respect to galactic rotation.\n\nThe coordinate data given here were extracted from the online coordinate calculator at Nasa's Extragalactical Database (NED).\n\nThe Lund Observatory map of our Milky Way Galaxy\n\nCredit: Knut Lundmark, Copyright: Lund Observatory\n\n7,000 Stars And The Milky Way\n\nThis panorama view of the sky is really a drawing. It was made in the 1940s under the supervision of astronomer Knut Lundmark at the Lund Observatory in Sweden. To create the picture, draftsmen used a mathematical distortion to map the entire sky onto an oval shaped image with the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy along the center and the north galactic pole at the top. 7,000 individual stars are shown as white dots, size indicating brightness. The \"Milky Way\" clouds, actually the combined light of dim, unresolved stars in the densely populated galactic plane, are accurately painted on, interrupted by dramatic dark dust lanes. The overall effect is photographic in quality and represents the visible sky. Can you identify any familiar landmarks or constellations? For starters, Orion is at the right edge of the picture, just below the galactic plane and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are visible as fuzzy patches in the lower right quadrant.\n\nCompare this drawing with:\n\nA photographic mosaic of the Milky Way\n\nMilky Way photomosaic, contributed to the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures.astro by Lloyd Johnson\n\nA Magellanic Mural\n\nCredit: W. Keel (U. Alabama in Tuscaloosa), Cerro Tololo, Chile\n\nTwo galaxies stand out to casual observers in Earth's Southern Hemisphere: the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). These irregular galaxies are two of the closest galaxies to our Milky Way Galaxy. Recent observations of the LMC (on the left) have determined that it is on a nearly circular orbit around our Galaxy, and have even helped in the determination of the composition of dark matter in our Galaxy. The above photograph spans 40 degrees. Visible on the lower left of the LMC is the Tarantula Nebula (in red). In the foreground to the right of the SMC is globular cluster 47 Tucanae, appearing here as a bright point of light.\n\nThe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds\n\nCredit & Copyright: D. Malin (AAO), AATB, ROE, UKS Telescope\n\nAlmost unknown to casual observers in the northern hemisphere, the southern sky contains two diffuse wonders known as the Magellanic Clouds. The Magellanic Clouds are small irregular galaxies orbiting our own larger Milky Way spiral galaxy. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), pictured here, is about 250,000 light years away and contains a preponderance of young, hot, blue stars indicating it has undergone a recent period of star formation. There is evidence that the SMC is not gravitationally bound to the LMC.\n\nAAO image reference UKS 14.\n\n(c) Anglo-Australian Observatory/Royal Observatory, Edinburgh Photograph from UK Schmidt plates by David Malin, text ) David Malin.\n\nThe image in this page was obtained by David Malin with the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

They were certainly known since the earliest times by the ancient southerners, but these people produced little documents which are still preserved. So it was Magellan and his discovery expedition who brought them to our knowledge in 1519.\n\nBoth Magellanic Clouds are irregular dwarf galaxies orbiting our Milky Way galaxy, and thus are members of our Local Group of galaxies. The Large Magellanic Cloud, at its distance of 179,000 light years, was longly considered the nearest external galaxy, until in 1994, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy was discovered at only about 80,000 light years. (Our current distance value takes into account the corrected Cepheid distance scale based on the Hipparcos satellite data published in early 1997.)\n\nLMC is less than one tenth as massive as the Milky Way; even so it contains the equivalent of over ten billion solar masses of material in the form of stars, gas and dust. The nearness of the LMC ensures that it is well resolved into stars in quite a modest telescope, and deep photographs reveal it to be a highly complex system with large numbers of clusters, nebulae and dust clouds scattered apparently at random across the face of the galaxy. Although a small irregular galaxy, the LMC is full of interesting objects including diffuse nebulae (especially the Tarantula Nebula, NGC 2070 / 30 Doradus -- the bright red patch at the eastern end of the galaxy --, a giant H II region), globular and open clusters, planetary nebulae, and more.\n\nLeft: Credit: D. Malin (AAO). LMC showing Supernova SN1987A in its full splendor, and the same patch of sky prior to the explosion. Right: Credit: P. Challis (CfA)/ HST. Ten years after the SN explosion the expanding ejecta eerilly glow in the dark. The two outer rings consist of gas ejected by strong winds from the stellar surface in an earlier stage, before it exploded.\n\nOn February 24, 1987, supernova 1987A occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which was the nearest observed supernova since Keplers, which occured before the invention of the telescope. Supernova 1987A, peculiar and of type II, was one of the most interesting objects for the astrophysicists in the 1980s (some even say of this century).\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC\n\nIrregular Galaxy SMC, the Small Magellanic Cloud (NGC 292) in Tucana\n\nRight Ascension 0 : 52.7 (h:m) Declination 72 : 50 (deg:m) Distance 210.0 (kly) Visual Brightness 2.3 (mag) Apparent Dimension 280 x 160 (arc min)\n\nLike its larger apparent neighbor, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud was certainly known to the ancient southerners, but became known to us only when Magellan went on his journey around the world, in 1519. The main body of the Small Magellanic Cloud has been assigned NGC 292 in Dreyer's catalog, which is now sometimes used for this galaxy. In addition, many clusters and nebulae which are members of this galaxy have been given their own NGC numbers.\n\nThis galaxy looks like a peace of the Milky Way for the naked eye. It orbits our Milky Way galaxy at about 210,000 light years distance, which makes it the third-nearest external galaxy known (after the LMC and the 1994 discovered Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy). Our current distance value takes into account the corrected Cepheid distance scale based on the Hipparcos satellite data published in early 1997.\n\nThe SMC is of irregular type. It may be a distorted barred disk, deformed by the tidal gravitational forces of Milky Way and LMC, but this is not sure. It contains several nebulae and star clusters which can be seen in photographs and through telescopes.\n\nIt was the Small Magellanic Cloud where Miss Henrietta Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relation of Cepheid variables, which is since then the most reliable method available for determining large cosmic distances.\n\nNewly discovered neighbours, hidden behind the Milky Way\n\n(Dwingeloo I, Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical, Antlia Dwarf Spheroidal, Argo Dwarf Irregular, Cepheus I, Pegasus Dwarf Elliptical)\n\nRecently a couple of companion galaxies have been discovered that had been hiding behind the dust and gas clouds of the Milky Way disk. Dwingeloo I and its companion Dwingeloo II were discovered in 1994 when astronomers pointed the Dwingeloo 25m radio telescope at the Milky Way. They are located behind the Milky Way at a distance of about 5 times further away than the Andromeda Galaxy, M31.\n\nAlso in 1994, a group of english astronomers discovered a galaxy that was located close to, but not entirely extinguished by, the interstellar matter in the Milky Way disk. That galaxy, the Saggitarius Dwarf Elliptical, turns out to be the closest companion of our Milky Way at a distance of only 24 kilo-parsec, about half the distance to the LMC.\n\nThis dwarf galaxy remained undiscovered -- despite its enormous extent on the sky of 5 x 10 degrees -- because it can only be detected as a slight enhancement of the density of stars on the sky; the actual surface brightness of this galaxy is very low.\n\nIn its orbit around the Milky Way, it has probably reached its closest distance to the Milky Way center right about now, and there is strong evidence of graviational interaction: our Milky Way is slowly ripping apart this poor dwarf and it may not survive for many more orbits.\n\nIn 1997 the same group of astronomers discovered a similar dwarf galaxy in the constellation of Antlia. It is comparable to the 9 similar companions of the Milky Way, but is interesting in that it is neither orbiting our Milky Way nor the Andromeda Galaxy, M31, but instead moves about freely in the Local Group of galaxies. The Antlia Dwarf contains only about a million stars and appears a rather large globular cluster.\n\nA second discovery was announced during the same press conference of a dwarf irregular galaxy in the constellation Argo. This Argo Dwarf, however, contains both a young and an old stellar population, and it is now known to contain quite a lot of neutral hydrogen gas as well. It was concluded therefore, that this galaxy must be more distant, at the edge or just beyond, of the Local Group. It is an example of a Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy.\n\nStill newer is the discovery of a big, but faint, galaxy named Cepheus I. It is located outside our Local Group at a distance of 6 Mega-parsec, or 9 times the distance to M31. It was discovered with the Radiotelescope at Dwingeloo. Despite its large mass in neutral hydrogen, it emits surprisingly little light. That is why, originally, it was thought to be much closer to our Milky Way.\n\nCredit: E. Grebel (U. Washington), P.
