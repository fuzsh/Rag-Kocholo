This review focuses on the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium of those dwarfs that are known to host significant amounts of gas and dust. The neutral and ionized gas components and the impact of the dust will be discussed, as well as first indications for the existence of active nuclei in these sources. Cosmological implications are also addressed, considering the primordial helium abundance and the similarity of local Green Pea galaxies with young, sometimes protogalactic sources in the early Universe.

Whether the Cusp-core problem reflects our insufficient grasp on the nature of dark matter, of gravity, on the impact of baryonic interactions with dark matter at those scales, as included in semi-analytical models or fully numerical codes, the solutions to it can point either to the need for a paradigm change in cosmology, or to to our lack of success in ironing out the finer details of the ΛCDM paradigm.

Their existence is not expected by the current galaxy formation simulations in the standard dark matter-based cosmology. On the contrary, modified gravity offers a promising alternative: the objects in the disks of satellites are tidal dwarf galaxies, that is, small galaxies that form from tidal tails of interacting galaxies. After introducing the topic, we review here our work on simulating the formation of the disks of satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The initial conditions of the simulation were tuned to reproduce the observed positions, velocities and disk orientations of the galaxies. The simulation showed that the galaxies had a close flyby 6.8 Gyr ago. One of the tidal tails produced by the Milky Way was captured by Andromeda. It formed a cloud of particles resembling the disk of satellites at Andromeda by its size, orientation, rotation and mass. A hint of a disk of satellites was formed at the Milky Way too. In addition, the encounter induced a warp in the disk of the simulated Milky Way that resembles the real warp by its magnitude and orientation. We present here, for the first time, the proper motions of the members of the disk of satellites of Andromeda predicted by our simulation. Finally, we point out some of the remaining open questions which this hypothesis, for the formation of disks of satellites, brings up.

In particular, we aim to focus on gas-poor dwarf galaxies. One of the most promising solutions to this cold dark matter small-scale issue is the stellar feedback, but it seems to be only designed for gas-rich dwarfs. However, in the regime of classical dwarfs, this core mechanism becomes negligible. Therefore, it is required to find solutions without invoking these baryonic processes as dark matter cores tend to persist even for these dwarfs, which are rather dark-matter-dominated. Here, we have presented two categories of solutions. One consists of creating dark matter cores from cusps within cold dark matter by altering the dark matter potential via perturbers. The second category gathers solutions that depict the natural emergence of dark matter cores in alternative theories. Given the wide variety of solutions, it becomes necessary to identify which mechanism dominates in the central region of galaxies by finding observational signatures left by them in order to highlight the true nature of dark matter.
