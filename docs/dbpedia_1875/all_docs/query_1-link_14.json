INTRODUCTION\n\nWhile observing the Andromeda Nebula with a fine 18-ft telescope ... I saw another small nebula about one minute in diameter which appeared to throw out two small rays; one to the right and the other to the left.\n\nG-J-H-J-B Le Gentil de la Galazière, October 29, 1749\n\nRemarks on the Nebulous Stars (1759)\n\nTo the rest of the Universe, the Local Group is an ordinary collection of dwarf galaxies dominated by two giant spirals. But to Earthbound astronomers interested in galaxy evolution, the Local Group is particularly special. The dwarfs of the Local Group provide a uniquely well-studied and statistically useful sample of low-luminosity galaxies. Indeed, virtually all currently known dwarfs less luminous than MV ~ -11.0 are found in the Local Group (Whiting et al 1997). Dwarf galaxies represent the dominant population, by number, of the present-day Universe (Marzke & Da Costa 1997), and they were almost certainly much more numerous at past epochs (Ellis 1997). Studies of nearby clusters (Phillips et al 1998 and references therein) suggest that the summed optical luminosity of all dwarfs may rival that of the giant high-surface brightness galaxies in these environments. If low-luminosity galaxies are universally dominated by dark matter (DM) to the extent Local Group dwarfs may be (Section 6), they could account for a large fraction of the mass of galaxy clusters and perhaps the entire Universe. The dwarf galaxies of the Local Group offer the best opportunity to study a representative sample of these important but, by nature, inconspicuous galaxies in detail.\n\nDwarf galaxies are known to exist in large numbers in other environments, particularly nearby groups (Karachentseva et al 1985, Miller 1996, Côté et al 1997), and clusters (Sandage & Binggeli 1984, Sandage et al 1985b, Ferguson & Sandage 1991, Phillips et al 1998). But there are fundamental reasons why the dwarfs of the Local Group remain especially important:\n\nWhat is the relationship, if any, between dwarf irregular (dIrr) and dwarf spheroidal/dwarf elliptical (dSph/dE) galaxies? The Local Group contains a unique mixture of low-luminosity galaxies of both types that provide some ways to address this question (e.g. Bothun et al 1986, Binggeli 1994, Skillman & Bender 1995).\n\nLow-luminosity dwarfs tend to be metal poor (Section 5); thus, the low-luminosity dwarfs in the Local Group represent a sample of galaxies that is still largely composed of nearly primordial material. Dwarf galaxy abundances are typically determined from their HII regions, but only in the Local Group can we also obtain reliable abundances from resolved stellar populations. The large luminosity range of Local Group dwarfs makes them excellent labs to study how other fundamental parameters vary with luminosity, such as DM content, the interstellar medium (ISM) properties, and star-formation history.\n\nDwarfs are the simplest galactic systems known. However, Local Group dwarfs are plainly telling us that \"simple\" is a relative term. The star- formation and chemical-enrichment histories of these galaxies are complex, varied, and in most cases triggered and sustained by as-yet unknown mechanisms (Section 6). The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is capable of reaching the main-sequence turnoff of the oldest stars in galaxies throughout the Local Group (Gregg & Minniti 1997), so these galaxies will likely remain for some time the only well-defined sample for which we can derive complete star-formation histories.\n\nDwarf galaxies may be among the darkest single galaxies known (Section 7). They play an important role in addressing the DM problem, having already placed interesting constraints on the nature and distribution of DM, and even whether the DM paradigm is valid for these systems (Ashman 1992, Mateo 1997). The Local Group currently provides our only opportunity to measure the internal kinematics of ultra-low-surface brightness dwarfs.\n\nThere is considerable evidence of ongoing, past, and future interactions between Local Group dwarfs and larger galaxies (Section 8), which may have helped assemble the larger Local Group galaxies over time. Recent measurements of the star-formation histories, space motions, three-dimensional shapes, and detailed internal kinematics of some of these interacting dwarfs in the Local Group offer new constraints on the dwarf/giant relationship and interaction models (Mateo 1996, Unavane et al 1996).\n\nI have two principle goals for this review. First, I present here a set of tables that aim to provide a summary of basic observational data for all of the currently known Local Group dwarf galaxies. These tables also highlight areas where fundamental observations are lacking or remain of poor quality. My second goal is to illustrate ways in which studies of Local Group dwarfs offer unique opportunities to understand galaxy evolution, DM, galaxy interactions, and the relation between stellar populations and the ISM. At the start of most sections, I cite specialized reviews pertinent to the topics that follow. Some recent general reviews relevant to Local Group dwarf galaxies include those by Hodge (1989), Gallagher & Wyse (1994), Ferguson & Binggeli (1994), Binggeli (1994), Skillman & Bender (1995), Da Costa (1994a, b, 1998), Grebel (1997). I have also found the proceedings of three recent meetings to be particularly helpful: the CTIO/ESO workshop on the Local Group held in La Serena, Chile, in 1994 (Layden et al 1994); the ESO/OHP workshop on dwarf galaxies in France in 1993 (Meylan & Prugniel 1994); and the Tucson workshop on the Galactic halo and in honor of George Preston (Morrison & Sarajedini 1996).\n\nSOME WORDS ABOUT THE TABLES AND NOMENCLATURE The tables are meant to be self-contained with complete notes and references. Although the data are presented in a uniform format, the tables are all based on a large, inhomogeneous set of independent studies. Many entries are subjectively weighted mean values of the results from independent sources. Galaxies are listed in order of increasing right ascension in all the tables. I try to provide realistic estimates of the 1 errors. Where possible, the errors are taken from the original source, or they reflect the scatter of independent results. In several tables and one figure, errors were omitted for photometric results if 0.04 mag. ASCII files containing most of the information in the tables are available via anonymous ftp at ftp://ra.astro.lsa.umich.edu/pub/mateo/get/LGDtables.dat .\n\n\"Transition\" galaxies are the five objects listed in Table 1 as dIrr/dSph systems. Sandage & Hoffman (1991) referred to such galaxies as \"mixed-morphology\" systems. The non-dIrr galaxies of the Local Group may or may not belong to a single family; hence, when I wish the discussion to include M32 (a dE system) and the five transition galaxies, I use \"early-type\" galaxies."
