        "text": "Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy Antlia Dwarf (PGC 29194), type dE3, in Antlia\n\nRA:\n\n10 : 04.1\n\nDec:\n\n-27 : 20\n\nType:\n\ndE3\n\nRV:\n\nDistance:\n\n4600 kly\n\nApparent Dimension:\n\n2.0 x 1.5 arc min\n\nDiameter:\n\n5.5 kly\n\nBrightness:\n\n14.8 m_vis\n\nAbs. Mag:\n\nMass:\n\nDiscovered by Corwin, de Vaucouleurs and de Vaucouleurs in 1985.\n\nAntlia dwarf has been discovered by research students Alan Whiting and George Hau of Cambridge University (England) when visually inspecting UK Schmidt Telescope photographic survey plates; the discovery was announced on April 10, 1997 (see Whiting et.al. 1997). Within this work they also found the nearby probable non-member Argo Dwarf galaxy.\n\nWhile it was the Cambridge team who identified this galaxy as a Local Group member candidate, it had been discovered previously by Corwin et.al. (1985). Also, it had been previously cataloged by Feitzinger and Galinski (1985) where it is No. 256, and by Fouque et. al. (1990) as PGC 29194. None of these references, however, led to its identification as a potential Local Group member.\n\nThe membership of this galaxy in the Local Group is still subject to current research and discussion. The Antlia dwarf is a member of a small group of galaxies around NGC 3109, which also contains the dwarf galaxies Sextans A and Sextans B. The group of Mike Irwin in Cambridge have it as a Local Group member, and Mateo (1998) counts it to the NGC 3109 subgroup of our small cluster of galaxies. On the other hand, van den Bergh (1999) takes this for a small but independent nearby group of galaxies, the nearest neighbor to our Local Group.\n\nAntlia Dwarf page within the MAA Constellations & Stars pages Antlia Dwarf Galaxy by FORS1 on VLT UT1, ESO Press Photos 10a-d/99 (slide)\n\nReferences:\n\nH.G.
