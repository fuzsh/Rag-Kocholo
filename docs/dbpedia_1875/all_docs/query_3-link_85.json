        "text": "Â This thesis focuses on modeling the complex internal structure of dwarf galaxies. Dwarf Â galaxy is the most frequent type of galaxy in the universe. It is dominated by the dark Â matter and thus naturally becomes the best targets for testing the dark matter theories. Â The work I did focuses on the observations of the dwarf galaxies and infers the underlying structures using the observational data from several sky surveys. Â\n\nIn the first project, I infer the 3D shape of the dwarf galaxies around the MW. I com bine the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) DR8 photometry with Gaia photometry to study the 3D structure of Bootes I, Draco, Ursa Minor, Sextans and Sculptor Â dwarf galaxies using blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars as distance indicators. I construct a new colour-absolute magnitude of BHB stars that I use to measure the distance Â gradients within the bodies of the dwarf galaxies. I detect a statistically significant non zero gradient only in Sextans and Sculptor. Through modelling of the gradient and 2-D Â density of the systems using triaxial Plummer models, I find that the distance gradients Â in both dwarf galaxies are inconsistent with prolate shape but compatible with oblate or Â triaxial shapes. In order to explain the observed gradients, the oblate models of Sextans Â and Sculptor need to have asignificant intrinsic ellipticity larger than 0.47 for Sextans and Â 0.46 for Sculptor. The flattened oblate shape may imply a significant anisotropy in the velocity distribution in order to be consistent with the lack of significant velocity gradients Â in these systems. Â\n\nIn the next project, I look at a specific system: the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and M54. Â I present results from simultaneous modeling of 2D (projected along the line of sight) Â position, proper motion and line-of-sight velocity for Gaia- and APOGEE-observed stars Â near the centre of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. I use a mixture model Â that allows for independent sub-populations contributed by the Sgr galaxy, its nuclear Â star cluster M54, and the Milky Way foreground. I find an offset of 0.295 Â± 0.029 degrees between the inferred centroids of Sgr and M54, corresponding to a (projected) Â physical separation of 0.135 Â± 0.013 kpc. The detected offset might plausibly be driven Â by unmodelled asymmetry in Sgrâs stellar configuration; however, standard criteria for Â model selection favour our symmetric model over an alternative that allows for bilateral asymmetry. I infer an offset between the proper motion centres of Sgr and M54 of Â [âÂµÎ± cosÎ´,âÂµÎ´] = [4.9,â19.7] Â± [6.8,6.2] Âµas yrâ1, with magnitude similar to the covariance expected due to spatially-correlated systematic error. I infer an offset of 4.1Â±1.2 km Â sâ1 in line-of-sight velocity. Using inferred values for the systemic positions and motions Â of Sgr and M54 as initial conditions, I calculate the recent orbital history of a simplified Â Sgr/M54 system, which I demonstrate to be sensitive to any line-of-sight distance offset Â between M54 and Sgr, and to the distribution of dark matter within Sgr. Considering Â the case that the centroids of M54 and Sgr currently are offset by â² 0.7 kpc, I find that Â if Sgrâs dark matter halo has the central âcuspâ that characterises cold dark matter halos, Â then M54 is currently approaching apocentre of an orbit (within Sgr) that is gradually de caying due to dynamical friction. If Sgrâs dark matter halo has a âcoreâ of uniform central Â density, then M54 is currently near pericentre of an orbit that is, as expected from previous work, relatively unaffected by dynamical friction. Finally, if the centroids currently Â are offset by â³ 0.7 kpc, (thus dominated by an offset in line-of-sight distance), then the Â calculated orbits would imply that M54 fell into Sgr within the past 200 Myr.
