        "text": "Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy number density and are crucial for our understanding of galaxy evolution. They tend to have the least star formation per unit mass of any systems, making them interestingly pristine tests of small-scale cosmology. The surface-brightnesses of dwarfs (especially those at cosmological distances) makes them largely invisible in current large-scale surveys. The discovery of faint dwarfs has, therefore, been limited to the Local Group, where they can be detected in resolved stellar counts.\n\nGiven the dearth of dwarfs outside the local neighbourhood in past surveys, this regime remains largely unexplored, at least from a statistical point of view (and certainly from the point of view of probing the evolution of the dwarf population with redshift). Why is their star formation so inefficient? Does the molecular-cloud model of star formation break down in the dwarf regime? Do stars and AGN drive outflows in these systems? Does reionization photo-evaporate gas in the smallest dwarfs? Perhaps not unexpectedly, many of the tensions between our theoretical paradigm and observations lie in this regime, e.g. the overprediction of dwarfs in simulations (the 'substructure' problem) or the discrepancy between the luminosity of predicted and observed dwarfs (the 'too-big-to-fail' problem)."
