        "text": "Ex-Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in a interview describes the days’ priors to the execution as characterized by “indecision” and “fear” by the new establishment about what could happen after Saddam Hussein’s death.\n\nSaddam Hussein did not have to die. At least not for the Americans, who had requested an extension of fifteen days from the scheduled date for Saddam’s execution and refused, until the end, to deliver the rais into Iraqis’ hands. Neither for Qatar and UN Security Council which, with Washington’s support, already negotiating the price for the dictator, that should be expatriated the same day of his execution.\n\nTo reveal these new details is the former Iraqi premier Nouri Al-Maliki, who in a recent interview describes the days priors the execution as characterized by “indecision” and “fear” by the new establishment about what could happen after the tyrant’s death. Many within Iraq were against the death of the Rais indeed. Amongst them, the former Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and the then Minister of Justice, who refused to sign the order.\n\nWhy were they eager to kill the tyrant?\n\nAccording to some, the answer should be sought in the rules of international law that prohibits the death penalty for defendants above the age of seventy. Saddam was 69 years old, and any lag in the trial could have saved the Iraqi Rais from the gallows.\n\nFor others, the truth lies in Teheran, the great puppeteer of the post-Saddam phase. Iran with the death of the dictator has gained ample room for manoeuvre to increase his influence in the country and eliminated a likely icon for the Sunni resistance. In retrospect, an unwise decision. The ghost of Saddam Hussein continues to inspire terror."
