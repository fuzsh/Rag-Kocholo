        "text": "Washington D.C. October 18, 2005 - The National Security Archive today posted a series of declassified U.S. intelligence documents and other U.S. agency reports on Saddam Hussein's human rights abuses, one of which is the subject of the first trial of Saddam which begins tomorrow in Iraq. The first set of charges concerns Saddam's responsibility, along with seven co-defendants, for the 1982 massacre of 143 Shiites in Dujail, a town 35 miles north of Baghdad, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Saddam. Procedures for the trial are the subject of significant controversy, as reported by the New York Times' John Burns today. The Archive's posting gives a preview of the evidence that the U.S. government may be providing to the trial process.\n\nSaddam may face up to a dozen trials for crimes alleged to have been committed by his regime - among them the gassing of Kurds in Halabja and the suppression of a Shiite uprising in the south. However, in September it was reported that the Iraqi government may waive further proceedings if Saddam is convicted in the first trial, a conviction which could bring the death penalty. (Note 1)\n\nDuring his years in power, the U.S. Intelligence Community produced estimates and studies of Iraq's foreign and defense policies, its military capabilities and activities, and analyses of the regime's domestic policies and actions. Other U.S. agencies, both before and after the termination of Saddam's rule, also produced reports on the regime's internal activities.\n\nThe collection below contains a number of documents produced by U.S. agencies over the last thirty years concerning the Iraqi regime's policies and activities directed at maintaining itself in power and eliminating or neutralizing opposition to the regime.\n\nDocuments\n\nNote: The following documents are in PDF format.\n\nYou will need to download and install the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view.\n\nDocument 1\n\nNIO/Middle East\n\nThe Implications of the Iran-Iraq Agreement\n\nMay 1, 1975. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nThis State Department- CIA- Defense Intelligence Agency analysis explores the implications of the March 1975 agreement between Iran and Iraq on border issues. One result of the agreement was Iran halting aid to the Kurdish forces who opposed the Iraqi regime. A key element of the study is an examination of the impact of the agreement on the Kurds' ability to oppose the regime\n\nDocument 2\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nNIE 36.2-1-79, Iraq's Role in the Middle East\n\nJune 21, 1979. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nWhile this national intelligence estimate focuses primarily on external affairs it also deals with topics such as the nature of the regime and regime politics. Its principal judgments include the observation that \"Iraq's Ba'athist leaders are determined to perpetuate themselves in power, to impose their national, socialist, and secular philosophy on the country\" and \"The 40-year-old civilian Saddam Husayn is likely to succeed the ailing President Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr …\"\n\nDocument 3\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nSNIE 34/36.2-82, Implication of Iran's Victory Over Iraq\n\nJune 8, 1982. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nThis special national intelligence estimate explores both the domestic and foreign implications of Iran's apparent (in 1982) victory over Iraq in their then two-year old war. Included in the estimate is an analysis of Iranian and internal challenges to Saddam's role and the likely nature of a successor regime.\n\nDocument 4\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nSNIE 36.2-83, Prospects for Iraq\n\nJuly 19, 1983. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nThis estimate also explores the domestic and foreign implications of Iraq's continued war with Iran. Two sections deal with the domestic impacts - one focuses on economic issues, the other on the political impact of the war. The political impact section examines regime weaknesses and strengths, possible succession scenarios, and opposition groups. The estimate's key judgments included the belief that \"Saddam will remain in power for the two-year period of this Estimate, but in our judgment his regime has become more brittle. It is more … dependent on fear as an instrument of control …\"\n\nDocument 5\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n\nIraq: Foreign Intelligence and Security Services\n\nAugust 1985. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nA key factor in Saddam's ability to maintain power were the regime's intelligence and security services. This appears to be the only one of the CIA's \"Foreign Intelligence and Security Service\" studies to be officially released. It focuses on the functions, organization, and administrative practices of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, Director of Military Intelligence, and the Directorate General of Security, as well as key personalities.\n\nDocument 6\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n\nPolitical and Personality Handbook of Iraq\n\nJanuary 1991. Secret\n\nSource: CIA Electronic Reading Room\n\nIn the summary to this study, it is noted that Saddam had built a powerful, centralized political machine with only himself and a few trusted family members and lieutenants making virtually all policy decisions. The handbook's main body contains a section on Saddam's Iraq which covers the country's social structure and identity, the structure of the government, the Ba'ath Party and the security services. Other topics examined in the handbook include the men around Saddam, his inner and outer circles, and key military commanders.\n\nDocument 7\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n\nIraq: Domestic Impact of the War\n\nJanuary 25, 1991. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nThis report, by the CIA's Office of Near Eastern and Asian Analysis, was written soon after the initiation on operation Desert Storm in January 1991. Among the domestic impacts it considers are the economic consequences as well as the political climate.\n\nDocument 8\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n\nIraq: Implications for Insurrection and Prospects for Saddam's Survival\n\nMarch 1991. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act\n\nThis analysis, also produced by the agency's Near Eastern analysis office, focuses solely on the prospect that Saddam would survive the aftermath of Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf War. It begins by noting that Saddam \"faces his most serious political challenge in more than twenty years of power.\" It examines possible outcomes to the insurrection as well as scenarios for a coup.\n\nDocument 9\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nSNIE 36-2-91, Iraq: Saddam Husayn's Prospects for Survival Over the Next Year\n\nSeptember 1991. Secret\n\nSource: CIA Electronic Reading Room\n\nSix months after the CIA's Near Eastern analysis office completed its assessment of Saddam's prospects for survival the entire Intelligence Community produced a Special National Intelligence Estimate on the same topic. In a memorandum included as a preface to the main body of the estimate, acting director of central intelligence Richard Kerr informed readers that \"the key value of this paper is its appraisal of the intense internal and external pressures on the regime in Iraq.\"\n\nDocument 10\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nNIE 92-7, Saddam Husayn: Likely to Hang On\n\nJune 1992. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act\n\nThe title to this 1992 national intelligence estimate provided the Intelligence Community's conclusion as to Saddam's immediate prospects. The body of this estimate discussed how Saddam was 'tightening his grip' and 'extending his reach in the South' and putting 'pressure on the Kurds.' It concludes with a discussion of why Saddam's survival over the near term was judged likely.\n\nDocument 11\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency, Special Intelligence Memorandum\n\nHumanitarian Situation in the Marshes, August 20, 1993\n\nAugust 20, 1993. Top Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nThis special intelligence report notes that deteriorating living conditions in Iraq's southern marshlands had prompted some Iraqi Shiites to flee to Iran or to locations elsewhere in Iraq and that \"Baghdad continues to deny the UN and international relief organizations access to the marshes.\"\n\nDocument 12\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nNIE 93-42, Prospects for Iraq: Saddam and Beyond\n\nDecember 1993. Secret\n\nSource: Freedom of Information Act Request\n\nAmong the key questions examined in this late 1993 national intelligence estimate were the prospects for the survival of Saddam's regime, the impact of sanctions and diplomatic isolation on Saddam's survival, the most likely means of regime change, the characteristics and policies of likely successors, and the prospects of political stability after Saddam. It includes the observation that the Intelligence Community did not \"anticipate receiving significant intelligence indications that a successful coup is imminent,\" since \"any group of anti-Saddam conspirators that cannot keep their plot secret from US intelligence is not likely to keep it secret from Saddam's security services.\"\n\nDocument 13\n\nDepartment of State\n\nSaddam Hussein's Iraq\n\nSeptember 1999. Unclassified\n\nSource: Department of State\n\nThis heavily illustrated Department of State publication was aimed at the American public and international audiences. It explores the impact of sanctions, Iraqi obstruction of the oil-for-food program, regime misuse of resources, repression of the Iraqi people, and war crimes committed by the regime.\n\nDocument 14\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\n\nPutting Noncombatants at Risk: Saddam's Use of \"Human Shields\"\n\nJanuary 2003. Unclassified\n\nSource: Central Intelligence Agency\n\nThis unclassified Intelligence Community study examines Saddam's use of both foreigners and Iraqis as human shields. Specific topics include the manipulation of Iraqi and foreign volunteers, and placing Iraqi civilians and civilian facilities at risk.\n\nDocument 15\n\nU.S. Agency for International Development\n\nIraq's Legacy of Terror: MASS GRAVES\n\nJanuary 2004. Unclassified\n\nSource: Agency for International Development\n\nIn the aftermath of the end of Saddam's regime mass graves were uncovered at numerous sites in Iraq. This Agency for International Development publication shows the location of the graves, which British Prime Minister Tony Blair estimated contained the bodies of as many as 400,000 Iraqis, and discusses the history involved as well as including stories of the survivors.\n\nNote"
