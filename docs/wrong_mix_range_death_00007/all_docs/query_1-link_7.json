        "text": "\"Saddam is responsible for the killing of thousands of his own people and he deserves to die. I have no sympathy for him or other Arab dictators. I hope he will be put on trial and executed. This should be a lesson for other corrupt and tyrant Arab leaders. I hope the Iraqi people will now be able to live in peace because they have suffered for a long time under Saddam and his sons.\"\n\n--Michael Hanna a 28-year-old engineer and Palestinian Arab in the West Bank, Israel, The New York Sun, 12/15/03\n\n\"Thank you Bush. I shall be playing my trumpet until the dawn.\"\n\n--Wasam Adain, a 23-year-old music shop owner in Baghdad, The Daily Telegraph (London), 12/15/03\n\n\"Finally I am happy. Dont be scared, theyre only fireworks.\"\n\n--Najim Fukkar, 13, setting off a handful of squibs with a horde of other children in Baghdad, The Daily Telegraph (London) 12/15/03\n\n\"This nightmare is gone once and for all. Celebrations are taking place throughout the country from the north to the south.

And even Iraqi journalists covering the press conference which broke the news to the world cheered, punched the air and shouted 'Death to Saddam.' Some of the pressmen  who had been tortured by the dictator's henchmen  burst into tears. One former victim of Saddam, Ali AlBashiri, from Kirkuk, said: This is the joy of a lifetime. I am speaking on behalf of all the people that suffered under his rule.\"\n\n--Tony Leonard, Daily Star, 12/15/03\n\n\"I'm very happy for the Iraqi people. Life is going to be safer now. Now we can start a new beginning.\"\n\n--Yehya Hassan, a Baghdad resident, The Guardian (London) and agencies, 12/15/03\n\n\"In the northern city of Kirkuk, rumours of his capture sent people streaming into the streets. Cars honked their horns and played loud music and sweets were given out to children waving green ribbons.\"\n\n--Rory McCarthy in Tikrit and agencies in Baghdad, The Guardian (London) 12/15/03\n\n\"The devil is caught, his regime is finished. Everyone knew what he did to the Kurdish people.\"\n\n--Salahadin Mohammed, The Guardian (London) and agencies, 12/15/03\n\n\"This is the joy of a lifetime. I am speaking on behalf of all the people that suffered under his rule.\"\n\n--Ali al-Bashiri, The Guardian (London) and agencies, 12/15/03\n\n\"I cried with happiness. He was not a real human, he was some kind of creature. He lived in that palace without any idea how real people had to live. Now we must see him in a court. But I do not want him executed. He should suffer, just as the Iraqi people suffered under him. I want to tell you we are so grateful for what the Americans have done.\"\n\n--Media Ali, a 19-year-old law student in Iraq, The Guardian (London) and agencies, 12/15/03\n\n\"We are celebrating like it's a wedding. We are finally rid of that criminal.\"\n\n--Mustapha Sheriff, a Tikrit resident, The Advertiser (Australia), 12/15/03\n\n\"This is the joy of a lifetime.

The entire community is happy. We are going to celebrate with fireworks. This is a big day for Iraqi people all over the world and marks the turning point in the h istory of our country. This should improve security in Iraq as many people still believed he was waiting to come back. Now they will believe his era is over. We really do have something to celebrate. It is the wish of all Iraqis that Saddam Hussein should be publicly tried for all his crimes inside Iraq.\"\n\n--Professor Nadir Ahmad, a member of the group Iraqi Exiles in the UK, said of the Iraqi exile community in Manchester, Belfast News Letter (Northern Ireland), 12/15/03\n\n\"The initial impact of the news in Baghdad yesterday was encouraging, with volleys of traditional celebratory gunfire rippling into the air over the Iraqi capital as the word spread among the population that their former ruler and longtime oppressor was finally in custody. For a people traumatised by more than two decades of Saddams rule, the reality of his fall was always tinged with the fear that he might return to wreak vengeance on those he judged to have betrayed him.\"\n\n--Analysis by Ian Bruce, The Herald (Glasgow), 12/15/03\n\n\"It will be a new start for peace. This is a new day for the country. Saddam should at least get the death penalty.\"\n\n--Said Jassim al-Yasseri, 34, the imam of a Shiite mosque in Iraq, The New York Times, 12/15/03\n\n\"Obviously, were generally happy that this is an end of an era. A brutal dictator has been consigned to the dustbin of history.\"\n\n--Riadh Muslih, editor of Al Shorouq, an English/Arabic newspaper in Vancouver, The Vancouver Province (British Columbia), 12/15/03\n\n\"There is some good news. New stores have opened their doors, many of them selling once banned goods like satellite dishes. U.S. officials helped issue new Iraqi bank notes, in part to curb rampant counterfeiting. Electricity is becoming more stable, and Baghdad's telephone service should finally be restored to prewar levels by early next year.\"\n\n--Kevin Whitelaw, U.S. News and World Report, December 8, 2003\n\n\"For many Iraqis, living standards have shot up. Labourers get double their pre-war wages, many other public-sector workers between four and ten times more. The electricity supply, though still erratic, is back roughly to its pre-war level, after briefly surpassing it. Most important, oil production is heading for its pre-war level of 2m barrels a day, and is supposed to reach 2.8m b/d in April.\"\n\n--The Economist, December 6, 2003\n\n\"The Americans did well. They freed people from terror and fear.\"\n\n--Amina Mohammed Aziz, a Kurdish Iraqi who lost four sons and everything she owned in the mass genocide campaign in the Kurdish region of Iraq, The Los Angeles Times, December 5, 2003\n\n\"Now we're getting recognition and attention. Before, we were playing in the dark.\"\n\n--Nobar Adnan, violinist in the Iraqi Symphony Orchestra in Baghdad. The orchestra struggled to survive during Saddams regime because of restrictions on music and instruments by the Iraqi government and UN, The Washington Post, December 5, 2003\n\n\"After 1979, when Saddam Hussein took power, we went through a catastrophe. All aspects of culture were neglected.\"\n\n--Mohammed Amin Ezzat, conductor of the Iraqi Symphony Orchestra, The Washington Post, December 5, 2003\n\n\"Of course, we are delighted Saddam Hussein is gone, but that shouldn't mean that people should be breaking the law. If I arrest a thief or vandal, that is good for Iraqi society.\"\n\n--Mohammed Mothair, a 17-year veteran of the Fallujah police, The Boston Globe, December 4, 2003\n\n\"I'm glad they're [the Americans] here. I want them to stay. All we want is peace of mind. It's only the dishonest Iraqis who want the Americans to leave. They want the freedom to rob and steal again.\"\n\n--Muhammad Shakir Jaafar, a Sadr city resident and business man, Knight Ridder Tribune, December 4, 2003\n\n\"Saddam used to say 'the problem is in your head, so we will chop it off.' No problem. That's what we are doing to him.\"\n\n--A supervisor of the construction company taking down the large bronze statues of Saddam in Bagdad, Agence France Presse, December 3, 2003\n\n\"Americans and Iraqis cheered as soon as a crane lifted the frowning bronze bust and began lowering it gently to the ground.\"\n\n--Joel Brinkley, The New York Times, on the removal of Saddam statues from the old palace, December 3, 2003\n\n\"Taking Saddam down from his palace, that means a lot to us. This is a once-in-a-lifetime job.\"\n\n--Iraq contractor, after his company removed large bronze busts of Saddam Hussein from the palace, New York Times, December 3, 2003\n\n\"The truth is, Saddam gave us nothing but cruelty, he looked after nobody but his own family. He was a tyrant. He gave us nothing.\"\n\n-- Muhammad al-Hussein, 60, a farmer in Amiriya, Iraq, The New York Times, December 1, 2003\n\n\"There is much heartfelt gratitude to the Americans for toppling the monster . . .\"\n\n--Najlaa Kamil, a 32-year-old linguist in Iraq, refering to Saddam Hussein, The Boston Globe, November 29, 2003\n\n\"They [Iraqis] have never been so free and prosperous, and they expect things will get better still. There's been banking and currency reform, with lines of credit now readily available. Markets are thriving, property values are rising. Welcome novelties include free speech and almost 200 periodicals; Internet cafes, bloggers, and cellphones are everywhere. About 90,000 Iraqis are policemen or soldiers, a number growing all the time . . . The Iraqi Provisional Government is gradually acquiring power and capabilities, and one day in the not so distant future will become independent.\"\n\n-- David Pryce-Jones, The National Review, November 24, 2003\n\n\"The dining table this year is much better than last. It includes meat every day. On top of everything, there is freedom.\"\n\n--Fahem Malek, a retired general who has seen his pension quadruple since Americans replaced Saddams government, Associated Press, November 23, 2003\n\n\"We should have had such freedoms under Saddam. Saddam always tried to step on our traditions.\"\n\n--Jawad al-Hassab, 42, writer and director of a Shiite play that would have been banned during Saddam, Chicago Tribune, November 23, 2003\n\n\"Gone are the days when Iraq's Shiites were denied the right to practice their traditions and tens of thousands of people were killed and imprisoned by a brutal government that viewed them as a threat. Instead, in mosques across Baghdad, young Shiite boys sing tarteel--the words of the Koran--in choirs that were prohibited during Hussein's reign. Women form religious study groups. Books on religion once read in secret are for sale in the market.\"\n\n--Deborah Horan, Chicago Tribune, November 23, 2003\n\n\"It's [new play in Baghdad] a great opportunity. Before, we were afraid even to have books about Imam Hussein. We would buy a book, read it quickly and sell it.\"\n\n--Iman Abdel Hassan, an actress who is now in a show about an important figure in Shiite religion without punishment from Saddams government, Chicago Tribune, November 23, 2003\n\n\"This country was under 35 years of suppression, torture, intimidation. Now it is recovering and every day it is better.\"\n\n--Dr. Said Hakki, senior adviser to Iraq's Ministry of Health, St. Petersburg Times (Florida), November 23, 2003\n\n\"Most of the people in this city, they want to give the Americans a chance. But there are bad people, Saddams people, and they do not.\"\n\n-- Khalat Awad, an Iraqi man wounded in the blast, New York Times, November 21, 2003\n\n\"We have a circulation of 50,000 in Baghdad, another 15,000 in Basra, each edition carrying 12 pages of foreign and Arab news and eight of local news. Its good to feel like a real journalist at last.\"\n\n--Saad Al-Bazaz, editorial supervisor of the Al-Zaman newspaper in Iraq speaking on the new freedom of Iraqi press; Robert Fisk, Op-ed, The Capital Times, November 20, 2003\n\n\"My own suffering began 22 years ago. Every day, until the [Coalition] soldiers come, I cry. From the moment the soldiers entered the city, they opened my eyes. Saddam had a file on me, and no one would hire me for fear they would be arrested along with me. I did not have long to live in Saddams eyes. Now I am free.\"\n\n--Zena, 28, who wanted Americans to know how grateful she was for the Coalition victory against Saddam in Baghdad, Knight Ridder Newspapers, November 20, 2003\n\n\"A lot of families do not have fathers or husbands because of Saddam Hussein. Women are taking their rightful places with men, to help rebuild our country. I believe if a woman is efficient, she will shoot like a missile to the top of success.\"\n\n--Asma Tome, 27, a physician and a member of the Kademiyah city advisory councils subcommittee on women and childhood, Knight Ridder, November 20, 2003\n\n\"With little fanfare, Iraqis in the 85 neighborhoods of Baghdad already have made history. For the first times in their lives, they voted by raising their hands for representatives. Now they are learning how to govern and trust in their own leadership instead of a dictators.\"\n\n--Lee Hill Kavanaugh, Knight Ridder Newspapers, November 20, 2003\n\n\"In Baghdad today, there are scores of newspapers and nearly as many political parties. For the first time in 35 years the basic issues facing Iraq can be loudly debated in public rather than fearfully whispered behind closed doors. Iraq today is a success.\"\n\n--Jalal Talabani, Iraqi Governing Council President, The Wall Street Journal, November 20, 2003\n\n\"Right now, the burden on us is to teach them about humanity. Even now, there are mothers fearful of asking about their loved ones who disappeared six months ago, for fear they (the mothers) will be killed like it was before. We are teaching them to trust that those days are forever gone. We have much work ahead.\"\n\n--Zena, 28, who is involved in the advisory council for the city of Kademiyah in Iraq, Knight Ridder Newspapers, November 20, 2003.\n\n\"I like what I read. We appreciate Mr. Bush. Were all waiting for the fruits of change.\"\n\n--Karal Nadji, a Shia street vendor who sells shoes, speaking on the pro-coalition and anti-Saddam graffiti in Baghdad, Newsday, November 19, 2003\n\n\"Down Saddam the infidel and long live Bush the believer!\"\n\n--Graffiti slogans on a Baghdad wall, Newsday, November 19, 2003\n\n\"I believe absolutely in democracy. The people have a hunger for democracy, for the person who will represent them.\"\n\n--Mohammed Baqir Nasseri, a cleric in southern Iraq, The Washington Post, November 17, 2003\n\n\"I am very happy and proud. The dream of the Iraqi people has been achieved today.\"\n\n--Jalan Talabani, Kurdish leader of the Iraqi Governing Council, on the new timetable for Iraqi sovereignty, Australian Financial Review, November 17, 2003\n\n\"Perhaps I will be in Parliament myself. Why not?\"\n\n-- Sheik Thair Kamiz Thari al-Zuba'i, a 76 year old cleric who wants to correct the years of injustice brought onto his family under Saddams rule, The Boston Globe, November 17, 2003\n\n\"It's not the most important thing -- a missed chance or a goal. It's much more important to bring some good news to the world over Iraq. And to play soccer here -- a Peace Game -- is the good news.\"\n\n--Bernd Stange, Iraqi soccer coach, after winning the \"World Peace Game\" in Australia, Agence Free Presse, November 16, 2003\n\nNo to terrorism, yes to freedom and peace.\"\n\n--Banner at an Iraqi march to express solidarity with foreign troops after suicide bombing at Italian base, Agence France Presse, November 15, 2003\n\n\"Freedom has come; I can now speak openly what's on my mind.\"\n\n--Taleen Shehranian, oboe player in the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, Associated Press, November 15, 2003\n\n\"God bless the police.\"\n\n--Iraqi shopkeeper, shouting at Iraqi police officers who conducted morning raids in Baghdad, The New York Times, November 15, 2003\n\n\"Mister good!\"\n\n--Iraqi children, in broken English, to British soldiers in Basra, The Boston Globe, November 11, 2003\n\n\"We used to sit and dream about people with satellite television. Now I have it so the kids can watch sports. Before I had a wreck of a car. Now I bought a nice used one. We fixed up the house, too. I guess I'm rich.\"\n\n--Mohamed, a schoolteacher, whose salary rose from $30 a month to $300 under the Coalition Provisional Authority, The New York Times, November 11, 2003\n\n\"I am amazed. It is even better than before.\"\n\n--Abdul Ghani Yousef, manager of the newly reopened Sinjar Cement Factory, built by Iraqi contractors, which is more productive now then during Saddams rule, The Washington Post, November 10, 2003\n\n\"The rumbling, rust-colored cement factory tucked into a valley in the northwest corner of the country here stands as a monument to the success of the reconstruction effort. Burned and looted in the aftermath of the war, it was up and running again by mid-September. . . . With the help of $ 10,000 from the U.S. military, and $ 240,000 left over in factory bank accounts, they [Iraqi contractors] used scrap electronics, tore up one production line to get parts for the other, and fixed the plant in three months. It was not the state-of-the-art facility that the Americans envisioned, but it got the job done.\"\n\n--Ariana Eunjung Cha, The Washington Post, November 10, 2003\n\n\"For Mr. [Hayder] Mounthir, the fall of Mr. Hussein was like taking the gag out of my mouth, and he was now free to put on his play again, without the threat of censorship.\"\n\n--Yochi Dreazen, reporting on a new play in Baghdad portraying Saddams atrocities, The Wall Street Journal, November 10, 2003\n\n\"We have formed a first Cabinet, we have set up committees toward writing a constitution, and neighboring countries and allies recognize us. We had to gain recognition as an Iraqi body with an Iraqi will, independent of the coalition. The Arab League, the United Nations and the Islamic Congress have recognized us. That's quite an achievement.\"\n\n--Samir Shakir Mahmoud Sumaidy, Iraqi Governing Council, Knight Ridder Newspapers, November 9, 2003\n\n\"Security in the city's neighborhoods is perfectly all right. We hope Japanese businesses will also come here and reduce unemployment.\"\n\n-- Ali Dafaai, head of the Samawah city council in Iraq discussing plans for the refurbishing of a hospital, Asahi News Service, November 7, 2003\n\n\"Now there's freedom in riding. In the past, there were times when we were forced to lose or to let someone else win. Today, we ride freely.\"\n\n--Kasim Daoud, a jockey in Baghdad, Channel News Asia, November 6, 2003\n\n\"The smiling children swarmed the theater at Al Farouq Secondary School and grabbed at the stacks of navy shoulder bags. A gift from the American government, the bags were stocked with goodies such as notebooks, rulers, geometry sets, and a real treat  premium No. 2 pencils, something that had been hard to come by under the previous regime.\"\n\n--Ariana Eunjung Cha, The Washington Post, November 5, 2003\n\n\"We are very happy today. We never used to have bags like theses.\"\n\n--Dhia Aqeel, an 11th grade student who proudly displayed his new shoulder bag provided by the American government, The Washington Post, November 5, 2003\n\n\"Despite everything, it's better than before. Of course we're optimistic. We have a saying: If you are optimistic, you'll find good things.\"\n\n--Haidar Ghazy, Iraqi clothing store owner in Karada, The New York Times, November 4, 2003\n\n\"We don't have to bribe the custom officers anymore, there are no tariffs.\"\n\n--Iraqi used car salesman, ABC News, November 4, 2003\n\n\"It is what we heard often, the fear of the old regime is something that people here will never miss.\"\n\n--Jim Sciutto, ABC News reporter, ABC News, November 4, 2003\n\n\"You ask them about the future of Iraq, the majority of them, after complaining about all sorts of little things like the price of goods going up, you ask them Is your life better after Saddam? and they say of course its much better.\"\n\n--Terry McCarthy, Time Magazine Reporter, ABC News, November 2, 2003\n\n\"Before people were afraid to come to Najaf, now they are coming and our earnings have doubled.\"\n\n--Iraqi business owner, ABC News, November 3, 2003\n\n\"I can teach what I want and I am earning $180 a month instead of $13.\"\n\n--Iraqi teacher, ABC News, November 3, 2003\n\n\"The best thing about life now is freedom. You can say anything, go anywhere.\"\n\n--Haider Kadhim, internet-café consultant from Basra, Time, November 10, 2003\n\n\"We made sacrifices for this freedom. [Freedom will last] forever, I think. And itll be better after a month, and after a year, much better. I think so.\"\n\n--Ayad Abdul Kareem Muhssin, who lost his newborn daughter after his wife went into premature labor during the bombing of Baghdad, Time, November 10, 2003\n\n\"In the central market [of Amarah in southern Iraq] merchants cant remember a time when business was better. The main reason is the dramatic rise in disposable income now that the coalition is paying public employees $60 to $180 a month. Before the war, teachers earned $5 to $10, policemen $20.\"\n\n--Terry McCarthy, Time, November 10, 2003\n\n\"There is lots of construction now. Before we couldnt even bring in a single bag of cement.\"\n\n--Salam Nissan Shamoun, Iraqi postmaster, Time November 10, 2003\n\n\"Now you dont need money to get a doctor.

Salaries are much better. Before, salaries were so low, people sold their furniture. But now there is free trade, and we buy and sell what we like.\n\n--Sa'ad Basim al-Izzi, pharmaceuticals and medical appliance dealer, who recently was able to purchase a bed, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\n\"Under Saddam, the wealth of Iraq was spent on guns and other weapons. Now, God willing, this money will be spent on the welfare of our people.\"\n\n--Jamal Hameed Ali, animal merchant in Baghdad, The Boston Globe, November 2, 2003\n\n\"The once-dingy [Baghdad] school has received a remake courtesy of the occupation, making a true believer of Hadia Mohammed Kidaier, 50, its principal. They plastered and painted.

Mahmood Abbas, the country's leading taekwondo coach, cannot wait to follow suit.

But after the U.S.-led war that ousted Saddam, things are looking up.\"\n\n-- Associated Press, June 12, 2003\n\n\"I have no more fear now.

The walls of the capital - once decorated with portraits of Saddam Hussein - have become a battleground for competing ideas. They even show a sense of humor.

After so many years of dictatorship, we have chosen our own leader.\"\n\n-- Kemal Kerkuki, after participating in the election of Kirkuk's new mayor, The New York Times, May 29, 2003\n\n\"What Naheda Muhammad Nage did to the textbook she uses to teach social studies here was just as dramatic as the toppling of Saddam Hussein statues or the looting of Saddam Hussein palaces that took place after the American-led invasion of Iraq. Ms. Nage used a pen to cross out passages that focused on Mr. Hussein, the Baath Party he represented and his many supposed achievements. It was an act that could have led to her death just a few months ago.\"\n\n-- The New York Times, May 28, 2003\n\n\"Now that Iraq is free, we are demanding freedom and equal rights that Iraqi women have always been deprived of.\"\n\n-- Eman Ahmed, member of the Rising Iraqi Women's Organization, Associated Press, May 21, 2003\n\n\"I can tell you all these things now because we are free.

Paul Bremer III, the new U.S. civilian administrator for Iraq, Los Angeles Times, May 19, 2003\n\n\"As change settles over Iraqi society, one of the quieter shifts in the nuts and bolts of life is happening in school.
