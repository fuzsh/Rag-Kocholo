        "text": "BAGHDAD — Sadddam Hussein’s right-hand man Izzat Ibrahim Al Duri, a long-time fugitive, has died, the executed Iraqi Saddam’s daughter and his Baath Party said on Monday.\n\nAfter Saddam’s capture following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, the wiry, red-haired general remained the “King of Clubs” in Washington’s deck of cards of wanted regime figures with a $10-million bounty on his head.\n\n“I offer condolences... to all Iraqis and all his [Duri’s] admirers in the Arab world and around the world,” tweeted Raghad Saddam Hussein, along with a picture of Duri and her father, who was convicted and hanged in 2006.\n\nThe Baath Party, which ruled Iraq until Saddam’s overthrow, issued a statement announcing the death of 78-year-old Duri, but it also gave no details on where or the cause.\n\nKnown as the “Iceman” for his humble origins selling blocks of ice, he has previously been reported dead or captured only to resurface in audio or video messages.\n\nIn 2016, an unauthenticated recording showed Duri praising Al Qaeda and the Daesh terror group.\n\nDisaffected ex-Baathists reportedly played a key role in insurgencies after the invasion.\n\nDuri rose to become the number two in the all-powerful Revolutionary Command Council of Saddam’s regime."
