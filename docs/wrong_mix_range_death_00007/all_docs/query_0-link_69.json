        "text": "When we took out Saddam Hussein, I was against the invasion of Iraq. Colin Powell had made a comment about that if “we break it, we own it,” and his words were spot on. We did not listen to his warning and our war on Iraq certainly looks like a mistake (yes, partially with the benefit of hindsight).The political and terrorist bastards created by our having done so are still popping up.\n\nThis a preface for a discussion about one of those “bastards” Iranian Quds Force Leader Qasem Soleimani. He was a horrible man and he deserved killing. He commanded the Quds Force to train, equip, and assist, various terrorist groups in the Middle East to murder U.S. soldiers and contract workers. We can also feel a bit of visceral pride and satisfaction from obliterating him with a precise surgical strike. A strong simple message to the world that mess with us and you die. Yay, us!\n\nYet, Soleimani was killed on the soil of a sovereign country (Iraq) with whom we are not at war and without the permission of its leaders; we are also not in a “hot” war with Iran. Soleimani was a government official, probably the second most powerful political figure in Iran, and at least the equivalent of our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hence, we have taken the asymmetrical modern war of terrorist attacks directly to another level by assassinating almost a head of state. It is just a small step to snuffing out Vladimir Putin if we want. Any international code of conduct has been rewritten by President Trump to permit unilateral assassinations of government officials in retaliation for attacks on U.S. citizens.\n\nSuch a drastic and grave decision to violate international law (and without the advanced approval of our allies to boot) may also have been unwise for an additional reason. The economic sanctions we have placed on Iran have been slowly strangling it; its economy is less than third rate. Even if it is still a major irritant in the Middle East, the impact of the sanctions has stirred political uneasiness and protest, signaling at least some hopeful signs of regime change. Now, with Soleimani a national hero and martyr, we are back to being the Great Satan of 1979.\n\nThis space is not really an opinion platform. I think you need to know that I am biased in believing the assassination of Soleimani will prove a disastrous “sugar high” of pride. The international consequences are scary; we have crossed a line not unlike what started World War I. This is more of a “side piece,” as the future of our Constitution is dark; I am terrified at the direction this is taking us.\n\nWe do not have a monarchy, we have no King or Queen. We are not a dictatorship. Our form of government is a representative democracy ennobled by the will of the people. We vote in elections to hire otherwise ordinary people to do specific jobs in our government as avatars of our wishes. Our Constitution tells these avatars the limitations and breadth of their powers. It specifically tells our Presidents that he or she has to go to Congress first, before flexing our military might, except in an emergency. Presidents cannot lead us into War; the Commander-in-Chief role of a President is only activated once Congress gives our military a mission.\n\nIn the partisan warfare engulfing us, it seems we may have forgotten this, one of the most basic principals in our division of power between our branches of national government. Unfortunately, it is increasingly difficult to ignore the partisan din and look at events without accusing someone of being a partisan hack. Civil discourse is at a new low.\n\nWhat I am getting at is what President Trump did in ordering an assassination of another country’s governmental official is SO WRONG, the ends do not justify the means; it is unconstitutional and an assumption of unitary executive powers. We could end up in a “live” war with Iran because of his impulsive decision – he did not consult with either our allies or Congress, before acting.\n\nBoth George W. Bush and his father (as they should have) went to Congress before invading Iraq. The wisdom of either of those decisions was a matter of collaboration as opposed to purely an executive decision.\n\nEven in the face of a terrorist attack on our cultural centers, President Bush took time to seek permission to act. The original Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress is broad and authorizes a President to hunt down those responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was swiftly passed in 2001, virtually without a dissenting voice. It was a war resolution and has never been amended.\n\nThe Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 or Iraq Resolution, was signed into law almost exactly a year later. It lists the grievances against Saddam Hussein, but even then it is not really a war resolution. What it told President Bush is that he should use diplomatic efforts, but could use our military to “strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq” and “obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.” This resolution has also never been amended.\n\nA fair (well really ANY) reading of either or both of these two (2) twenty-year old resolutions has nothing to do with authorizing the assassinating of an Iranian official, then, in a democratic Iraq. This is a problem. It was a problem when President Obama was sending drones around the world (specifically in Pakistan) to kill terrorists; and, it was a problem when we were (and are) fighting ISIS. Congress has never spoken about having a military base in Syria or even permanent bases in Iraq. None of this is constitutional. While Congress has negligently slept, the powers of the Office of President have swelled into an authority of the One.\n\nQasem Soleimani is dead. Justice is sweet. But, it is also bitter, because our Constitution is creaking and threatened. You are not a partisan if you oppose his assassination, you are a patriot and a constitutionalist. Hopefully, Congress will reclaim its authority before it is too late.\n\nWarner Robins attorney Jim Rockefeller is the former Chief Assistant District Attorney for Houston County, and a former Assistant State Attorney in Miami.
