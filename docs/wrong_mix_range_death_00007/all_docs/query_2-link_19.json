        "text": "Home > News & Policies > December 2006\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\nDecember 29, 2006\n\nPresident Bush's Statement on Execution of Saddam Hussein\n\nIn Focus: Renewal in Iraq\n\nSTATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT\n\nToday, Saddam Hussein was executed after receiving a fair trial -- the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime.\n\nFair trials were unimaginable under Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule. It is a testament to the Iraqi people's resolve to move forward after decades of oppression that, despite his terrible crimes against his own people, Saddam Hussein received a fair trial. This would not have been possible without the Iraqi people's determination to create a society governed by the rule of law.\n\nSaddam Hussein's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops. Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain, and defend itself, and be an ally in the War on Terror.\n\nWe are reminded today of how far the Iraqi people have come since the end of Saddam Hussein's rule - and that the progress they have made would not have been possible without the continued service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform.\n\nMany difficult choices and further sacrifices lie ahead. Yet the safety and security of the American people require that we not relent in ensuring that Iraq's young democracy continues to progress.\n\n# # #"
