        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Saddam Hussein was convicted and sentenced Sunday to hang for crimes against humanity in the 1982 killings of 148 people in a single town, as the ousted leader, trembling and defiant, shouted \"God is great!\"\n\nAs he, his half brother and another senior official in his regime were convicted and sentenced to death, Saddam yelled out, \"Long live the people and death to their enemies. Long live the glorious nation, and death to its enemies!\"\n\nSome feared the verdicts could intensify Iraq's sectarian violence after a trial that stretched over nine months in 39 sessions and ended nearly 3 1/2 months ago. Clashes immediately broke out Sunday in north Baghdad's heavily Sunni Azamiyah district. Elsewhere in the capital, celebratory gunfire rang out.\n\n\"This government will be responsible for the consequences, with the deaths of hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands, whose blood will be shed,\" Salih al-Mutlaq, a Sunni political leader, told the al-Arabiya satellite television station.\n\nSaddam and his seven co-defendants were on trial for a wave of revenge killings carried out in the city of Dujail following a 1982 assassination attempt on the former dictator. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Islamic Dawa party, then an underground opposition, has claimed responsibility for organizing the attempt on Saddam's life.\n\nIn the streets of Dujail, a Tigris River city of 84,000, people celebrated and burned pictures of their former tormentor as the verdict was read.\n\nThe death sentences automatically go to a nine-judge appeals panel, which has unlimited time to review the case. If the verdicts and sentences are upheld, the executions must be carried out within 30 days.\n\nA court official told The Associated Press that the appeals process was likely to take three to four weeks once the formal paperwork was submitted.\n\nDuring Sunday's hearing, Saddam initially refused the chief judge's order to rise; two bailiffs pulled the ousted ruler to his feet and he remained standing through the sentencing, sometimes wagging his finger at the judge.\n\nBefore the session began, one of Saddam's lawyers, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, was ejected from the courtroom after handing the judge a memorandum in which he called the trial a travesty.\n\nChief Judge Raouf Abdul-Rahman pointed to Clark and said in English, \"Get out.\"\n\nIn addition to the former Iraqi dictator and Barzan Ibrahim, his former intelligence chief and half brother, the Iraqi High Tribunal convicted and sentenced Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the head of Iraq's former Revolutionary Court, to death by hanging. Iraq's former Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThree defendants were sentenced to 15 years in prison for torture and premeditated murder. Abdullah Kazim Ruwayyid and his son Mizhar Abdullah Ruwayyid were party officials Dujail, along with Ali Dayih Ali. They were believed responsible for the Dujail arrests.\n\nMohammed Azawi Ali, a former Dujail Baath Party official, was acquitted for lack of evidence and immediately freed.\n\nHe faces additional charges in a separate case over an alleged massacre of Kurdish civilians.\n\nThe guilty verdict for Saddam is expected to enrage hard-liners among Saddam's fellow Sunnis, who made up the bulk of the former ruling class. The country's majority Shiites, who were persecuted under the former leader but now largely control the government, will likely view the outcome as a cause of celebration.\n\nSaddam's chief lawyer Khalil al-Dulaim told AP his client called on Iraqis to reject sectarian violence and called on them to refrain from taking revenge on U.S. invaders.\n\n\"His message to the Iraqi people was 'pardon and do not take revenge on the invading nations and their people',\" al-Dulaimi said, quoting Saddam. \"The president also asked his countrymen to 'unify in the face of sectarian strife.'\"\n\nIn Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, 1,000 people defied the curfew and carried pictures of the city's favorite son through the streets. Some declared the court a product of the U.S. \"occupation forces\" and condemned the verdict.\n\n\"By our souls, by our blood we sacrifice for you Saddam\" and \"Saddam your name shakes America.\"\n\nU.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad issued a statement saying the verdicts \"demonstrate the commitment of the Iraqi people to hold them (Saddam and his co-defendants) accountable.\"\n\n\"Although the Iraqis may face difficult days in the coming weeks, closing the book on Saddam and his regime is an opportunity to unite and build a better future,\" Khalilzad said.\n\nU.S. officials associated with the tribunal said Saddam's repeated courtroom outbursts during the nine-month trial may have played a key part in his conviction.\n\nThey cited his admission in a March 1 hearing that he had ordered the trial of 148 Shiites who were eventually executed, insisting that doing so was legal because they were suspected in the assassination attempt against him. \"Where is the crime? Where is the crime?\" he asked, standing before the panel of five judges.\n\nLater in the same session, he argued that his co-defendants must be released and that because he was in charge, he alone must be tried. His outburst came a day after the prosecution presented a presidential decree with a signature they said was Saddam's approval for death sentences for the 148 Shiites, their most direct evidence against him.\n\nAbout 50 of those sentenced by the \"Revolutionary Court\" died during interrogation before they could go to the gallows. Some of those hanged were children.\n\n\"Every time they (defendants) rose and spoke, they provided a lot of incriminating evidence,\" said one of the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nUnder Saddam, Iraq's bureaucracy showed a consistent tendency to document orders, policies and minutes of meetings. That, according to the U.S. officials, helped the prosecution produce more than 30 documents that clearly established the chain of command under Saddam.\n\nOne document gave the names of everyone from Dujail banished to a desert detention camp in southern Iraq. Another, prepared by an aide to Saddam, gave the president a detailed account of the punitive measures against the people of Dujail following the failed assassination attempt.\n\nSaddam's trial had from the outset appeared to reflect the turmoil and violence in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nOne of Saddam's lawyers was assassinated the day after the trial's opening session last year. Two more were later assassinated and a fourth fled the country.\n\nIn January, chief judge Rizgar Amin, a Kurd, resigned after complaints by Shiite politicians that he had failed to keep control of court proceedings. He, in turn, complained of political interference in the trial. Abdul-Rahman, another Kurd, replaced Amin.\n\nHearings were frequently disrupted by outbursts from Saddam and Ibrahim, with the two raging against what they said was the illegitimacy of the court, their ill treatment in the U.S.-run facility where they are being held and the lack of protection for their lawyers.\n\nThe defense lawyers contributed to the chaos in the courtroom by staging several boycotts."
