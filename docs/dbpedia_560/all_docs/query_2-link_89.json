        "text": "By Douglas Hamilton\n\nSKOPJE, May 25 (Reuters) - Fighting between government troops and ethnic Albanian guerrillas in northeast Macedonia prevented Red Cross medical teams from reaching shelled villages on Friday where at least seven civilians were reported killed.\n\nAbout 2,000 villagers were reported by the U.N. refugee agency to have fled north into Serbia on Thursday after the army launched an offensive, and smaller groups were evacuated by Macedonian police.\n\nBut many more men, women and children are thought to be still sheltering in their homes, afraid to move.\n\nA high civilian toll could tip the balance towards the breakup of a crisis-hit coalition that is holding the ethnically mixed republic together and staving off the threat of a civil war that could enflame the Balkans.\n\nDespite some unsourced reports of up to 60 dead, a senior guerrilla commander called Sokoli told Reuters by telephone on Friday that he knew of no more deaths than the seven victims he had named 24 hours earlier.\n\nSix were from the Zymberi family, reportedly killed when a shell pierced the concrete ceiling of their basement shelter.\n\nIn the capital, Skopje, diplomatic sources said \"careful\" contacts were continuing between estranged Macedonian Slav and ethnic Albanian leaders to save the country's national unity coalition government.\n\nThe heads of the two main Albanian parties, Arben Xhaferi and Imer Imeri, are so far refusing to repudiate a \"peace deal\" they made in secret talks with Ali Ahmeti, the political leader of the insurgents.\n\nThe revelation so outraged some Slav leaders that Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said there was nothing for it but to pursue the military option with \"no mercy\".\n\nBut the language of other Slav ministers has been cooler. President Boris Trajkovski insisted the two parties must renounce the deal otherwise \"we cannot work together\" but conceded it may have been \"an error of judgment\".\n\nNO RECONCILIATION YET\n\n\"They do not want to be seen as driving the Albanians off, so they are offering this wiggle room but they've got to swallow this repudiation. It was their mistake,\" a Western diplomat said.\n\nThe European Union and the NATO countries have condemned the agreement as an inadmissable legitimisation of violence, but so far the ethnic Albanian leaders are defending it.\n\nThe army on Friday again attacked Vakcince, one of a cluster of rebel-held villages in northeast Macedonia. Two armoured helicopter gunships swooped in, drawing some ground fire, a Reuters TV crew near the scene said.\n\nOne man who left Vakcince on Thursday after the first wave of the army offensive said the village was still full of civilians, and that there were \"many wounded\".\n\n\"We are in regular contact with the Macedonian army but so far it has not been possible to enter,\" said Annick Bouvier of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\n\"We need a ceasefire but so far it has not been possible to get this security guarantee. We want to get in to assess the situation and evacuate any injured.\"\n\nThe villages have been occupied by guerrillas and under attack by government forces for three weeks.\n\nArmy spokesman Colonel Blagoja Markovski astonished reporters at his regular briefing on Thursday by claiming, in the teeth of days of eyewitness reports and reels of video evidence, that no houses had been shelled.\n\nCASUALTY REPORTS UNCONFIRMED\n\nAccording to the guerrillas, eight civilians had been killed in the previous three weeks of often heavy shelling before Thursday's offensive. Most civilians keep to their basements and cellars when there is fighting.\n\n\"Of course there is no way for us to confirm these reports without being there,\" Bouvier said.\n\nShe said Red Cross teams which visited the villages in the period before the army launched its offensive had been able to deliver basic medical supplies for war wounds, such as plaster of paris, antiseptic, dressings and salves for treating burns.\n\nReuters correspondents saw Macedonian armour and infantry concentrated on the edge of Vakcince, parts of which were taken on Thursday, while artillery pounded other rebel-held areas.\n\nIn the west, where there were once again daily reports of clashes in the Sar mountains above Tetovo, scene of big battles in March, there were signs of army reinforcements moving up.\n\nDefence Minister Vlado Buckovski, who took office 12 days ago when a national unity government was formed, resumed appeals for civilians to leave the northeastern Kumanovo area where a number of villages are held by insurgents.\n\n\"If they leave the crisis area, we will just handle the terrorists, if they do not, the operation will be very complicated,\" thestate MIA news agency quoted him as saying.\n\nInterior Minister Ljube Boshkovski, also new in office, told the news agency four policemen had been wounded on Thursday. \"The operation will continue until we get back every centimetre of the Macedonian land,\" he said.\n\nThe nation pulled back from disaster 12 days ago when an emergency coalition government was formed, bringing in more ethnic Albanian parties but vowing to exclude guerrillas of the self-styled National Liberation Army."
