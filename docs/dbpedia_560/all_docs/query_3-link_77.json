Today, the citizens speak and it is important that citizens give their verdict today. I invite citizens to come out and achieve the highest turnout we possibly can because the highest the turnout the stronger is the citizens’ verdict, which we all subdue to,” – said Vitia during his statement for the press.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE"
