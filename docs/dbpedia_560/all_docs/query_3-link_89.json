        "text": "Because I live in Kosovo\n\nwhen I speak my first language,\n\nYou tell me not to.\n\nŽašto? — Why?\n\n“Well, because we live in Kosovo”\n\nThat’s what you say.\n\n“Nemoj, mos, don’t!”\n\nSTOP, ti mu pom tregon veq me fol shqip\n\nBut the sad part is that I can speak 2 more languages.\n\nIt’s hard to be myself when everyone is trying to make me someone else. I’m not saying that you all are the same,\n\nNot saying that you are all bad.\n\nI’m saying that just one of you can make a big change.\n\nYou just know my language,\n\nNothing about me.\n\nIs it because of others who warned you about us and how you should hate based on the history?\n\nThe history happened,\n\nI’m sorry,\n\nI didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nI’m just a kid,\n\nSpeaking my mother tongue,\n\nSo why does it hurt your ear so much?\n\nWe are ALL the future.\n\nI don’t want to teach anyone to hate.\n\nOh, I’m tired.\n\nI want this to end.\n\nEach letter, each word and each language has shades of colors which are so unique.\n\nI’m sorry again, but I can’t explain them\n\n‘Cause you have to feel them…\n\nWhy can’t I say to the world what I mean, think and see?\n\nIs it just me or people are sad?\n\nIs it just me or everyone’s mad?\n\nWe are breathing but not living,\n\nWe are in bed but not sleeping,\n\nOur eyes are open but we aren’t seeing.\n\nWe need to wake up!\n\nWe are all made of red blood, muscles and dreams.\n\nMy voice is shaking,\n\nMy heart is beating loud.\n\nI need you to hear this, I want to make my country proud.\n\nWe have 6 stars on the flag,\n\nLet’s just wrap our wing one to another,\n\nLet’s make a wonder!\n\nI believe in equality, not in their lies.\n\nEquality is not a simple word that messes with your mind.\n\nMaybe you think language is just a barrier,\n\nBut you are wrong.\n\nIt’s a bridge that connects us all.\n\nI hate.\n\nYes, I hate;\n\nBut not you, you or you.\n\nI hate that we pretend we are blind to the things we want to hide.\n\nI love.\n\nYes, I love your language,\n\nyour culture,\n\nSo why can’t I be one of you?\n\nOne of your friends,\n\nOne of your mates,\n\nBut I’m always a “she” with no name.\n\nThis poem was performed by the author at the Kosovo Slam Poetry Festival, organized by alumni from the YES youth exchange and study program, and has been published here with permission. The annual festival aims to be a space for young people in Kosovo to express their struggles and social issues through their original verses.\n\nFeature image: Majlinda Hoxha / K2.0."
