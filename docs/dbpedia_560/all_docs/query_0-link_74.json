        "text": "497. On 3 November 1993 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government allegations in the cases of U Aye Lwin, Nai Sein Aung Kyi, Maung Nyan Pwa and U Aung Thein. On 24 January 1994 the Government replied that the individuals had not been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in Myanmar. The Government also submitted information with respect to these cases, which is summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\n498. The Special Rapporteur had received information indicating that Aye Luwin died in December 1992 from internal injuries sustained after a severe beating by a prison official at Insein prison. According to the reply by the Government, U Aye Lwin had not been subjected to torture at Insein prison. In November 1992 he fell ill and vomited blood and was taken to the prison hospital on 27 November, but died from his illness. A post-mortem carried out by the police surgeon at Yongon General Hospital showed no external injury to the body and no fractures to the skull, vertebrae or ribs. His heart and valve were swollen and his liver showed signs of chronic heart disease. The cause of death was certified as an inflammation of the heart muscles and cardiac arrest.\n\n499. According to the information transmitted to the Government, Nai Sein Aung Kyi had been arrested and beaten severely and his wife, Mi Thaw, had been raped by members of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Infantry Battalion No. 31. According to the Government, Naing Sein Aung Kyi was picked up while drifting alone in Thanbyuzayt by the No. 62 Infantry Battalion and he asked to be a guide for military operations. He was taken to the No. 31 Infantry Battalion where he rested for four days and resumed his work as a guide. The allegation that his hands were broken was untrue. His wife was in fact a person named Daw Leik, and there was no person named \"Mi Thaw\" at Thanbyuzayat. Neither Daw Leik nor a person named \"Mi Thaw\" had visited him as alleged.\n\n500. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur, Maung Nyan Pwa and his father U Aung Thein were tortured by members of Infantry Battalion No. 97 after they had been arrested together with 100 men on the Zabu Aye boat in the Jine river. Maung Nyan Pwa allegedly had his right eyeball and eyelid smashed and his father was beaten to death with rifle butts. According to the Government, it was not true that the No. 97 Infantry Battalion had rounded up about 100 people on 10 January 1993. The Zabu Aye was not found to be sailing on the Jaing river. The names Maung Nyan Pwa and U Aung Thein could not be found in the records.\n\nNepal\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government 501. By letter dated 5 August 1994 the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had received reports indicating that torture in police custody continued to be used both as a means to obtain information or confessions and to punish persons detained for political reasons. Although Nepali Law requires that detainees be brought before a court and charged within 24 hours of arrest, victims were said often to be arrested without warrants and held for prolonged periods, at times incommunicado, and sometimes in excess of 20 days.\n\n502. According to the reports, torture occurred in Sindhuli, Gorkha, Kaski, Katmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Ilam, Morang, Rolpa, Lamjung and Rukum districts. The forms of torture used were said to include beatings with sticks; beating on the soles of the feet (falanga); beatings with sisnu (a plant which causes painful swellings on the skin); punching, kicking, having pins inserted under the fingernails and being threatened with rape.\n\n503. The individual cases summarized in the following paragraphs were also communicated to the Government.\n\n504. Teelu Ghale was arrested in Katmandu on 22 September 1993 and at the Hanuman Dhoka station police officers allegedly beat her, applied electric current to her wrists, attempted to rape her and attempted to extort money from her. On 26 September, her mother filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, and the police reportedly responded by denying that they had arrested her. She was then transferred to Bhaktapur police station, where she was allegedly further abused and denied food for two days. She appeared before the Supreme Court on 5 October, following that Court's order to produce her, and the police maintained that she had been arrested only the previous day. A Supreme Court investigation was said to have concluded that she had in fact been arrested on 22 September and contempt of court proceedings were said to have been initiated against the police. No action, however, was said to have been taken to investigate the torture allegations.\n\n505. Jagrit Bhetwal and Amik Sherchan, members of parliament, were among those persons reportedly beaten and arrested by police on 20 July 1993 during demonstrations in support of a nationwide transportation strike. Amik Sherchan allegedly suffered a broken hand and was hospitalized as a result. Also in connection with the demonstrations, Harihcandra Raya was arrested on 19 July at Janakpur in the southern region and was allegedly subjected to torture in police custody.\n\n506. Bijaya Lama, an 18-year-old labourer in Suryavinayak, Bhaktapur, was arrested on 5 July 1994 during a demonstration in Bhaktapur. He was allegedly taken to the office of the District Superintendent of Police with a number of other detainees and beaten severely until he was unconscious. The following morning, he was brought to Bhaktapur hospital and diagnosed as suffering from a head injury. He was then transferred to Bir hospital, where he died.\n\n507. Kiran Shrestha, Shankar Rokka, and Lochan Nepal, students aged between 14 and 16, were allegedly severely beaten in police custody on 23 August 1993 at the Barahathawa police station. They reportedly had apprehended a businessman who they believed was responsible for corrupt practices in the distribution of flood relief supplies, and they had taken him to the police station. Kiran Shrestha was allegedly beaten unconscious in the incident and taken to Janakopur hospital for emergency treatment. It was reported that the Malangwa Deputy Superintendent of Police requested the police inspector at Barahathawa police station to apologize for the beatings and that the inspector had replied that he would do so only if no official action were taken against him.\n\nNiger\n\nUrgent appeals 508. On 9 June 1994, the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government an urgent appeal on behalf of Aghali Awaiss, Moussa Oubba and Halid Daoul, Tuaregs who were reportedly arrested on 17 or 18 May 1994 in the area north of Agadez. They had allegedly been tortured and it was feared that they would continue to be subjected to torture in detention. The reports received also indicated that two other persons arrested at the same time had died as a result of torture and that since these arrests other members of the Tuareg community had been arrested and probably tortured.\n\nNigeria\n\nUrgent appeals 509. On 30 May 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government an urgent appeal on behalf of Ken Saro- Wiwa, a writer and leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), who was arrested on 22 May 1994 following a raid on his house in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, south-east Nigeria. He was taken to the Bori military barracks in Port Harcourt where he was reportedly held incommunicado and denied access to medication he needed to take regularly due to a heart condition. He was also said to be kept in leg irons and handcuffs.\n\n510. In a subsequent urgent appeal transmitted on 10 August 1994, the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had received new information according to which during the preceding few days Ken Saro-Wiwa's hands and legs had been kept in cuffs and he had been subjected to intense beatings.\n\n511. On 15 August 1994 the Government replied that the right to physical and mental integrity of Ken Saro-Wiwa was fully protected as set forth in various international instruments and the Nigerian Constitution. It was not true that he had been subjected to intense beating nor had his hands and legs been in cuffs. On 10 November 1994 the Government further replied that Ken Saro-Wiwa was being given necessary medical attention and free access to his family and attorney.\n\nNorway\n\nUrgent appeals 512. The Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal on 24 August 1994 concerning Iranian nationals Bahlul Karbaly Khalil Moghadami, Mansour Mohammadi Injeh and Farhad Mohammadi Injeh, who hijacked an Aeroflot plane over Russian territory on 15 September 1993 and landed in Oslo. The Russian Federation had requested their extradition in accordance with the Hague Convention of 1970 on unlawful seizure of aircraft. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Norwegian Ministry of Justice had decided on 23 August 1994 to extradite these persons in accordance with the Russian request.\n\n513. Assuring the Government that he did not wish to prevent those accused of a serious crime such as hijacking from being brought to justice, the Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government not to extradite the above-mentioned individuals, particularly unless it could assure itself and take measures to ensure that the individuals would not be subjected to such torturous conditions as existed in some pre-trial detention centres in the Russian Federation. The Special Rapporteur, having recently undertaken a mission to the Russian Federation to examine conditions of detention, had concluded that conditions in certain pre-trial detention centres, such as Butyrskaya and Matrosskaya Tishina 1 in Moscow, were for certain categories of prisoners so gross due to overcrowding as to be a detriment to health (see E/CN.4/1995/34/Add.1). Those detention centres had in fact been described as inhumane by responsible Russian authorities. In addition, one of the prisoners suffers from a severe case of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of imprisonment and torture in the Islamic Republic of Iran and had attempted suicide in a Norwegian prison. In the light of this alleged torture and of repeated allegations of torture in the Islamic Republic, the Special Rapporteur also asked that the Government ensure that any extradition to the Russian Federation not be followed by extradition or deportation to Iran.\n\n514. On 6 October 1994 the Government replied that the extradition decision by the Ministry of Justice followed a Eidsvoll court of summary jurisdiction ruling that the criteria for extradition under the Norwegian Extradition Act had been fulfilled. The ruling had stipulated that, barring exceptional circumstances, the persons not be re-extradited to a third State. This ruling was appealed to the Eidsivating High Court and the Supreme Court Appeals Committee and was dismissed. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice and police had considered carefully the objections raised by the hijackers as well as the Government's international obligations and could not see that the extradition would contravene its international obligations. The Ministry of Justice considered it decisive that the aircraft hijacking was an extremely grave offence which was carefully planned and which put passengers and crew in danger of their lives. The Norwegian authorities would ask the Russian authorities for permission to visit the persons after extradition in order to remain informed about their situation in Russia after they were taken into custody. The Ministry's decision was subject to appeal and such an appeal has been lodged.\n\nPakistan\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government 515. By letter dated 21 July 1994 the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had continued to receive reports indicating that torture in the custody of the police, the paramilitary and the armed forces was endemic, widespread and systematic. Torture was said to be used by police to gain information, to obtain confessions, or to intimidate or punish detainees, and often resulted in death. Torture was reportedly practised against persons detained for political reasons, criminal suspects, and persons from whom police sought to extract a bribe.\n\n516. The methods of torture reported included prolonged blindfolding; prolonged enforced standing; beatings with sticks and leather truncheons (the chittar); pulling the legs apart painfully (cheera); passing rollers over and beating the genitalia; burnings with cigarettes; application of electric shocks, frequently to the temples, knees, and genitalia; drilling with electric drills into the bone; hanging the body upside down for prolonged periods; being dragged through the streets by a vehicle; food and sleep deprivation; subjection to mock executions; and rape.\n\n517. On the way from police detention to a magistrate, detainees were said frequently to be threatened with further torture to dissuade them from revealing to the magistrate that they had been subjected to torture. Police were said seldom to investigate complaints of torture, even when under a court order to do so, and trials of officials accused of torture were rare. In the case of torture committed by members of the armed forces in Sindh province, the difficulty of prosecution was said to be exacerbated by a presidential ordinance which granted immunity from criminal prosecution to army personnel for any action undertaken \"in good faith\" during the law and order operations in that province. Medical officials were often pressured into issuing false medical reports so as to obscure the role of torture in the injuries or death of detainees.\n\n518. The individual cases described in the following paragraphs were also communicated to the Government.\n\n519. Ghulam Mustafa Soomro was reportedly arrested and beaten on 7 December 1992 by 10 to 12 members of the paramilitary Rangers, Kurram Militia, at his home in Sita Road, Sindh province. He was then blindfolded and brought for interrogation to the Kharipur Natanshah Ranger camp where the commanding officer and other Rangers allegedly beat him with sticks and leather whips until he fainted. Later, he was allegedly tied with ropes around his ankles and wrists at the back, hanged by those ropes from the ceiling, and simultaneously beaten on the legs and soles of the feet until he vomited. A medical officer of the Rangers reportedly gave him an injection of an unknown substance. After several days of continuous interrogations and beatings he was on 16 December taken to the Sita Road marketplace and, along with four other prisoners, stripped naked, and had his moustache and hair shaved off. The five men had their hands tied with ropes hitched to an army pick-up van and they were dragged through the main streets of the Sita Road area. They allegedly were forced to run to avoid falling down and being dragged along, while another truck followed which pushed the men whenever they could not keep up with the speed of the truck. This humiliation lasted about two hours, during which time children were forced to come forward and hit the men. Thereafter, Gulam Mustafa Soomro was taken back to the camp and received no medical attention. He was released in front of his home on 23 December in a semi-conscious state. It was alleged that the military were acting at the behest of a party to a land dispute against a neighbour to whom Ghalam Soomro had given support.\n\n520. Inderjit Lohana and his two brothers were arrested by uniformed army personnel and the Station House Officer (SHO) of Bhitai Nagar police station on 16 September 1992 in Citizens Colony, Hyderabad. Over the next several weeks at an army camp at Brigade 55 headquarters he was allegedly subjected to electric shocks applied to his knees and temples, deprived of sleep for a period of six or seven days, beaten with a leather whip or belt and made to lie down and stand up in a repeated and continuous manner. After he told the High Court judge at his hearing that he had been tortured while in army custody, the judge ordered that he be released within three days. Instead, he was allegedly transferred on 6 November to army custody and was not released until 22 March 1993 following a general amnesty.\n\n521. Bebal Khatoon Shirazi, aged 65, reportedly had her house in Chhato Chand village raided on 18 December 1992 by a group of officers from Thatta police station, Sindh province, and an army team. The authorities had been looking for a relative who was not present, and since no male member of the household was present, the women and children resisted the raid of the home. The police allegedly beat the women and children. Bebal Khatoon Shirazi was hit on the head and the body with rifle butts and died some hours later as the result of her injuries. An inquiry commission was reportedly set up on 23 December to determine the cause of death, but the result of the inquiry was unknown.\n\n522. Nazir Masih was arrested on 21 May 1993 by two police constables from Batala Colony police station, Faisalabad, Punjab province, to whom he had reportedly refused to supply liquor the previous night. His family members were said to have observed over the wall of the police station that Nazir Masih was being beaten severely and was shrieking with pain. He died that day and a post-mortem report issued by the medical superintendent noted that a blunt weapon had caused ten injuries on the body, mostly on the head and shoulders. The magistrate of Faisalabad was said to be conducting a preliminary inquiry into the cause of death, but the result of the inquiry was unknown.\n\n523. Niaz Hussain Pathan was arrested near Kotdiji, Khairpur district, by a number of armed police while travelling on 11 September 1992 on a bus in Sindh province. The police allegedly demanded payment for his release from a relative the following morning. Niaz Pathan was observed with his wrists and ankles shackled with iron chains and he called from his cell that he had been severely beaten and stripped of his possessions. On 14 September, when relatives and friends again approached the station to seek his release, they were reportedly told by the SHO that Niaz had never been in police custody. On 20 September the police reportedly told his mother that he had died in an encounter with police officials that morning involving bandits. It was alleged that Niaz in actuality had been tortured to death and three police officers were accused of his murder by his family in a complaint lodged with the senior district magistrate at Kotdiji in December 1992. It was unknown whether any investigation was being pursued.\n\n524. Mujib Aijaz Jatoi, a grandson of a prominent Sindhi peasant leader, was arrested by the SHO of Hala on 3 August 1993 while travelling on a bus from his home in Larkana to Karachi. He was allegedly tortured and died in custody the following day. His body was said to have had more than 100 marks of torture, including electric shock marks, and injuries to the head, legs, chest, and testicles, and the nails of his fingers had been pulled out. The police reportedly contended that he had committed suicide in custody and the senior police superintendent of Hyderabad and the Hala police allegedly refused his family's attempt to file a complaint. The High Court of Sindh, Hyderabad, subsequently ordered an investigation, but the result was unknown.\n\n525. Syed Ali Haider Shah, from Sindh, was arrested by the army on 8 June 1992 and reportedly died in custody two or three days later from what the army said was heart failure. Numerous torture marks were reportedly observed on his body. A judicial inquiry under the sub-divisional magistrate, Dadu, was said to have been set up to investigate the case in December 1992, but the result of the investigation was not known.\n\n526. Ashgar Narejo, from Keti Bhutto near Larkana, Sindh, was arrested, along with 17 relatives, by army and police near Khairpur on 13 June 1992. He was allegedly hanged from a tree and beaten severely with sticks and steel rods. He died around 18 June and officials were said to have declared the cause of death to have been a heart attack.\n\n527. Khan Mohammad Korai, from Moro, Sindh, was arrested on 2 August 1992 by the 47 Frontier Force Regiment from Moro after they had failed in their search for his brother. His body was returned to his family the next day, allegedly bearing marks of multiple injuries, including electric shocks and fractures of the neck and legs. A military official who brought the body to the family was said to have admitted that the victim had died after torture. A petition filed by his family was heard in March 1993 by the Sindh High Court, which called for a decision by the military court of inquiry. It was not known if any further action had been taken on the case.\n\n528. Qalander Bukhsh Brohi, a journalist from Badah, Dadu district, Sindh, was arrested by officers of Khwaja Ajmer Nagri police station on 26 August 1992 and, after demanding to be apprised of the reason for his arrest, was allegedly struck with a rifle butt and hung upside down. He reportedly died on the way to hospital. An autopsy was conducted, but the result was unknown.\n\n529. Ahmad Khan, of Pir Mohammad Narejo village near Gumbat Khairpur, Sindh, and Allah Rakhiyo were arrested along with two other persons on 24 September 1992 during a raid by the police and army. They were allegedly taken to Piri camp and tortured until they lost consciousness. Ahmad Khan reportedly died on the way to Karachi by ambulance.\n\n530. Mohammad Razzaq of Kamoke in Gujranwala district, Punjab, was arrested on 22 October 1992. He and his father, Mohammad Anwar, were allegedly beaten severely in custody and Mohammad Razzaq died that day. The Lahore High Court reportedly ordered the senior police superintendent of Gujranwala to investigate the case, but the result of the investigation was unknown.\n\n531. Aurangzeb, of Sukkur, Sindh, was arrested in September 1992 and died in detention in Sukkur jail in November 1992. He was allegedly tortured to death. Although a post-mortem report of Civil Hospital, Sikkur, was said to have stated that he had died of natural causes, his parents subsequently had his body exhumed from Qayyumbad graveyard, and a medical board reportedly found that no previous post-mortem had in fact been performed. The further results of the autopsy were unknown.\n\n532. Mohammad Liaqat (alias Boota), his wife, Hamida Begum, and three daughters from Sheikhupura, Punjab, were arrested on 12 October 1993 by police from Bikhi police station, Sheikhupura. Boota and his wife were allegedly tortured and Boota died in custody in November or December 1992. The Lahore High Court reportedly ordered investigations, the results of which were unknown.\n\n533. Bhural Jatoi, of Dost Ali Jaitoi in Sukkur district, was arrested with six other villagers by officers of Dubbar police station, Sukkur district. He was allegedly hanged upside down for 24 hours, cut with razor blades and kicked in the chest. He reportedly died of his injuries on 22 December 1993.\n\n534. Mohammad Arif Khatiyan, a People's Party of Pakistan (PPP) activist in Hyderabad district, Sindh, was arrested on 4 June 1993 in Arif Khatiyan, Hyderabad, and taken to Tando Jam police station, where he was allegedly tortured by three police officers. On 7 June, he was said to have been given first aid for his injuries and released, but later had to be taken to Rajputana Hospital, where he died. At the hospital, it was observed that his liver and kidneys were damaged and that he was passing blood with his urine. On 22 July 1993 the Sindh High Court ordered a complaint to be registered against the three officers after the police at Tando Jam police station had refused to register such a complaint. It was not known whether an investigation had begun.\n\n535. Makhno Khan Jagirani, from Sabul Jagriani near Ahmedpur, Khairpur Mirs district, Sindh, was arrested with 14 other persons during a raid on 5 July 1993 by police from Ahmedpur police station. The other 14 persons were released, reportedly after paying bribes, but Makhno Khan Jagirani, who was said to be lame and suffering from kidney trouble, was allegedly tortured after refusing to pay the bribe. He reportedly died thereafter in police custody. Persons protesting his death were said to have been threatened with \"dire consequences\" by the deputy commissioner in Khairpur if they did not give up their protest.\n\n536. Ijaz Khan, a tribal person from Lakrai village in Mohmand Agency, arrested on 5 July 1993 by officers from Kohsar police station in Islamabad, was allegedly tortured to death, although the police reportedly maintained that he had committed suicide. A medical board was said to have found torture marks on his body, but reserved judgement pending a laboratory report. The Islamabad district magistrate and the police department ordered separate inquiries, the results of which were unknown.\n\n537. Mohammad Sarwar, a trade union activist of Thatta Sindh, was arrested along with 23 other trade union activists in their quarters in the Dewan Sugar Mill colony on 26 July 1993 by officers of Mirpurbathoro police station. The management of the mill had reportedly filed a complaint against the activists. They were allegedly tortured in custody so as to pressure them to resign their positions. Mohammad Sarwar was said to have sustained spinal injuries in police custody and to have died as a result. The Thatta district magistrate ordered an investigation, the result of which was unknown.\n\n538. Nazir Ahmed, from Karache, Sindh, was arrested on 19 July 1993 by officials from Kharadar police station. When brought before a magistrate on 31 July, he was reportedly sent to Landhi jail, as he had sustained serious injuries in custody. At Landhi, he allegedly received no medical attention for his injuries. On 3 August he was transferred to Civil Hospital, Karachi, where he died. His body was said to have extensive cut marks and injuries to his genitals. Doctors at the hospital reportedly stated that his death had been due to severe torture.\n\n539. Noor Muhammad Qureshi was arrested on 23 December 1992 in Phuleli by four officers of Pinyari police station in Hyderabad district. His family members were said to have observed the police beating him with sticks and fists. He was allegedly taken away bleeding in a van and two hours later his body was found with a broken arm and multiple bruises in a nearby canal. Although the Pinyari police reportedly refused to register a complaint brought by family members, the Sindh High Court heard their petition in April 1993. The outcome of those proceedings was unknown.\n\n540. Gulloo Machhi, from Kot Nizamani village near Tando Jam, Sindh, was arrested during a raid of his village by officers of Chambar police station on 25 April 1993. The next day police reportedly handed his body over to his family, telling them he had committed suicide by slicing his throat. It was alleged that he had in fact been tortured to death for failing to pay a bribe and that a post-mortem had been falsified under police pressure to show suicide as the cause of death. On 29 May, the family reportedly had the body exhumed, and a second autopsy was said to have cast doubt on the results of the first post-mortem.\n\n541. Ten men were taken into custody on 12 August 1992 after around 30 uniformed men of the Ghotki police and the army raided Deh Issa Wali village in Sukkur district, Sindh. Sattar Bux, Ali Mohammad Qamruddin Indhar, Khadim Indhar and Subhoi Indhur were allegedly tortured at Ghotki police station. Another villager, Jaffar, was reportedly arrested on 19 September and subsequently tortured. Mohammad Qamruddin, Khadim Indhar and Subhoi Indhur were said to have died as a result of their treatment in custody.\n\n542. Farooq Ahmed, the 70-year-old father of the Secretary General of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), Imram Farooq, Mushtaq Saigol, an MQM member and former advisor to the Sindh chief minister, and his two sons Norman and Amir Saigol were arrested on 31 October 1992 in Karachi by police, army and Rangers. During the arrest, Mushtaq Saigol's wife Shanaz Saigol was allegedly hit with rifle butts and was threatened that her sons would be killed if she did not reveal the whereabouts of Imran Farooq. The four arrested men were allegedly blindfolded for two days in an unknown place and deprived of food and drink. Norman Amir Saigol was said to have had his legs pulled apart in different directions during interrogation.\n\n543. Mohammad Tariq was arrested on 30 June 1992 and taken by police to North Nazimabad police station. He was questioned about his brother and when he could supply no information, he was allegedly beaten and kicked unconscious. On 27 July he was reportedly transferred to Taimuria police station, tortured, and released after his family had paid officials a large sum of money.\n\n544. The Special Rapporteur also informed the Government that he had received information indicating that the substantial majority of women held in police custody were subjected to some form of sexual abuse, including rape. Registering a rape complaint was said to be problematic, because the Islamic Zina Ordinance of 1979 made it difficult for a woman to meet the evidential requirements to establish her case. Failing to establish such a case reportedly exposed the complainant to a potential charge of illicit sexual intercourse, an offence punishable under the Ordinance with death by stoning. It was further reported that when the alleged perpetrator of rape was a member of the police, army, or other governmental official, the police often refused to register a complaint or pressured or bribed the victim into dropping the charges.\n\n545. The Government in October 1992 reportedly approved an amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure under which women may not be held in a police station overnight and may only be interrogated in the presence of their husbands or a close male relative. Under the amendment, women would have to be held in judicial custody and could be moved to police custody for interrogation only on court orders. The amendment was said to have not as yet been approved by parliament.\n\n546. The individual cases summarized in the paragraphs below were also communicated to the Government.\n\n547. Lau, a 14-year-old girl, was allegedly raped by three police officers, including a head constable, on 17 October 1992 at the police station in Tando Ghulam Haider in Hyderabad district. She was reported to have been one of eight members of the Bheel tribe returning in a van from a festival who were stopped by police near Matli, Sindh province. The eight travellers were allegedly arrested and beaten. Three officers were tried and convicted of gang rape, but the conviction was overturned on procedural grounds.\n\n548. Shamin, a 21-year-old mother of two children, was reportedly kidnapped and raped by three men in North Nazimabad in Karachi. After her mother lodged a complaint in the Pirabad police station, Pirabad police arrested Shamin instead of investigating the rape allegations. They allegedly threatened to charge her with adultery and demanded payment for her release. When her mother could only procure part of the sum requested, they charged Shamin under the Zina Ordinance and held her in police custody for six days, during which time two police officers and a third unnamed person allegedly regularly raped her. The Sindh High Court in August 1992 ordered a First Information Order to be filed against the two officers. It was not known if an investigation had been undertaken.\n\n549. Further information was communicated according to which some young boys had been subjected to rape in the custody of police. It was reported that Rashid Mallah, aged 14, was beaten and raped by a police constable of police station Meldsi near Shahdadpur in Sanghar district, Sindh province. A complaint was registered against the constable by police, but it was unknown whether an investigation had taken place.\n\n550. Finally, the Special Rapporteur advised the Government that he had received reports, according to which private landlords or waderas, particularly in Sindh province, were running private jails wherein bonded rural labourers were kept captive and were subjected to severe ill-treatment. Detention and torture in such private jails was said to occur often with the knowledge, connivance or direct involvement of the police and other organs of the State. Several private jails in Sindh were said to be maintained by elected members of the National Assembly from both the Islamic Democratic Alliance and the Pakistan People's Party. In one case a rural jail with 130 chained rural labourers discovered in mid-1993 was said to belong to Salim Akbar Bugti, a member of the National Assembly.\n\nInformation transmitted by the Government with respect to cases included in previous reports 551. On 28 April 1993 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal on behalf of Lisa Evelyn Encore, an American citizen detained in prison in Karachi, who was five months pregnant and suffering from dysentery, pneumonia and possibly hepatitis. She was reportedly being provided little or no medical care and insufficient food. On 1 July 1994 the Government responded that she had given birth in hospital in August 1994; that the United States Vice Counsel and all requested relatives had been allowed to visit her; that a special diet of milk and meat had been provided to her and to her baby; that her baby had been given appropriate vaccinations; and that all medical facilities had been provided to her and to her baby.\n\nObservations 552. Over the past two years of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has had discussions with the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations Office at Geneva with a view to his being granted an invitation to visit the country. While prospects at first seemed promising, the Government eventually informed the Special Rapporteur that a mission was not convenient during the current year, but that it hoped to welcome the Special Rapporteur next year. The Special Rapporteur would be glad if that hope were realized, as the allegations he has received give grounds for serious concern.\n\nPeru\n\nUrgent appeals 553. The Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal on 8 June 1994 on behalf of C�sar Flores Gonz�lez, a journalist, who was detained on 30 April 1994 by a military patrol in the town of Huanta, department of Ayacucho. He was taken to the Castropampa military base and allegedly beaten before being released on 6 May. Fears were expressed that upon returning to Huanta he would be arrested and ill-treated again.\n\n554. On 14 September 1994 the Government replied that Mr. Flores had been arrested in the context of an operation carried out by the army to recruit people to perform military service. He was taken to the Castropampa base, but was never subjected to ill-treatment.\n\n555. The Special Rapporteur transmitted another urgent appeal on 26 September 1994 on behalf of Mar�a Elena Foronda and Oscar D�az Barboza, Director and Administrator, respectively, of the environmental organization Instituto Natura, who were detained under anti-terrorism legislation by members of the anti-terrorism police on 13 September 1994 in the town of Chimbote, Santa province, Ancash department.\n\nInformation received from the Government with respect to cases included in previous reports 556. On 16 August 1993 the Special Rapporteur made an urgent appeal on behalf of Juan Abelardo Mallea Tomailla, a taxi driver arrested in Lima on 10 July 1993 by members of the National Directorate against Terrorism (DINCOTE). The Government referred to this case in a letter dated 7 December 1993 in which it is stated that this person was a member of the Partido Comunista del Per� (Sendero Luminoso) and that it had been proven that he was the author of a hand-written text which appeared on a map. The map showed the location of four unmarked graves on the outskirts of Lima, which contained the remains of the professor and nine students abducted from La Cantuta University in July 1992. The sources, however, informed the Special Rapporteur that they had consulted a handwriting expert in the United States who found that Mr. Tomailla's handwriting did not correspond to that found on the map. In its response the Government also stated that he was examined by a doctor who established that he was physically and mentally well. It was not said, however, when this examination was carried out.\n\n557. The Government referred to the same case in another letter dated 24 January 1994 in which it stated that the provincial attorney in charge of the investigation found no evidence to charge Mr. Tomailla with terrorism-related offences. In a third letter dated 5 May 1994 the Government stated that the Lima Higher Court had ordered his release on 28 April 1994.\n\n558. Rafael Leandro Rodr�guez Eduardo was reportedly ill-treated on the premises of El Tambo police station in Jun�n in June 1991. On 14 September 1994 the Government replied that he had been arrested for theft but was never subjected to ill-treatment.\n\n559. Regarding the cases referred to in the following paragraphs, the Government sent its replies on 20 October 1994.\n\n560. Juan Arnaldo Salom� Aduato was allegedly tortured by the police after being arrested in Huancayo on 24 April 1991. The Government stated that he had never been arrested by the Jun�n police.\n\n561. Ant�rtico Daniel Salas C�rdova died on 27 April 1992, allegedly as a result of torture inflicted by members of the police who arrested him in San Mart�n, Lima. The Government replied that the National Police was carrying out an investigation.\n\n562. Martha Huatay Ruiz, a lawyer, was arrested on 17 October 1992 in Lima and allegedly tortured in the premises of DINCOTE. The Government stated that on 8 May 1993 she was examined by a doctor who did not find evidence of torture.\n\n563. Wigberto V�squez, Pl�cido Alvarado, V�ctor Morales, Crisanto Vel�squez, Guillermo Granda, Guillermo Oyola, Javier Garc�a Huam�n, Benjam�n Garc�a Huam�n, Daniel Cruz and Samuel Huam�n were arrested on 27 June 1992 in the province of San Ignacio, Cajamarca, and allegedly tortured by the police. The Government replied that these persons had been lawfully arrested and that they had not been subjected to ill-treatment.\n\n564. Pilar Coqchi Calle was arrested on 23 January 1990 in Huamanga for terrorism and allegedly tortured by the police. The Government stated that she had been sentenced to a prison term for terrorism. No mention of torture allegations was made in the reply.\n\n565. Maria Elena Loayza Tamayo was arrested in Lima on 6 February 1993 and allegedly tortured by members of DINCOTE. The Government replied that she was subjected to interrogation on 15 February 1993 in the presence of her lawyer and never complained about having been tortured. She was kept incommunicado for 10 days, in accordance with the law and with the authorization of the Public Ministry and the judge. The medical examination conducted before 15 February 1993 did not reveal that torture had taken place.\n\n566. Mar�a de la Cruz Pari was reported to have been raped while in detention by members of DINCOTE. The Government reported that she had made no complaint when she was visited by representatives of the Red Cross and the Public Ministry. The medical examination carried out on 11 January 1993 did not reveal that she had been raped.\n\n567. Higinio Quispe P�rez and Eleuterio Inga were arrested on 12 April 1991 and allegedly tortured by soldiers of the Chaquicocha military base, Huancayo. The Government stated that they had made statements according to which they were kept in detention for a few hours by two persons who did not identify themselves and, therefore, they could not be sure whether or not they belonged to the army. No complaint was filed against members of the military.\n\n568. Senobio Enr�quez Vargas was arrested on 24 January 1992 at Manta, Huancavelica, and allegedly tortured by members of the army. The Government replied that an investigation had been ordered.\n\n569. Juan Arnaldo Salom� Adauto was arrested in Huancayo, Jun�n, on 24 April 1991 and allegedly tortured by the police. The Government replied that a disciplinary investigation had been conducted. The allegations, however, proved to be false.\n\n570. Jos� Natividad Flores Rojas was arrested on 22 July 1992 at Bagua, Amazonas, and allegedly tortured by members of the army. The Government replied that following investigations carried out by the army command and the Public Ministry, the allegations proved to be false.\n\n571. Rosenda Yauri Ramos and Alberto Calipuy Valverde reportedly died as a result of torture inflicted by members of the army in Angasmarca, Santiago de Chuco, La Libertad, in March 1993. The Government replied that following a disciplinary investigation, four members of the army were found to be responsible for the killings. The penal investigation had not yet concluded.\n\n572. Marcos Gonz�lez Tuanama was arrested on 29 April 1992 and allegedly tortured at the Mariscal C�ceres military base, San Mart�n. The Government stated that the Public Ministry has not yet been able to complete the investigation due to lack of cooperation from the alleged victim.\n\n573. Marco Zarate Rotta, Enrique Aguilar del Alc�zar and C�sar C�ceres Haro, members of the army, were arrested in November 1992 following an attempted coup d'�tat, and allegedly tortured. The Government replied that the medical examinations carried out did not reveal ill-treatment.\n\nObservations 574. The Special Rapporteur was not able to transmit to the authorities substantial information he received suggesting that the Committee against Torture had good reason to be concerned by a widespread practice of torture in the investigation of terrorist offences and impunity for its perpetrators (CAT/C/SR.194/Add.1 of 22 November 1994). The Government's response to earlier cases seemed to suggest that it is mainly concerned to note an alleged insufficiency of proof in individual cases, rather than aggressively to come to grips with a widespread practice.\n\nPhilippines\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government and replies received 575. By letter dated 5 August 1994 the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had received reports indicating that torture was practised at times in detention centres and military camps. The methods used were said to include beatings, choking, sleep deprivation, blindfolding, placing one's head in a toilet, injection of \"truth serum\", and being forced to dig what one is told is one's grave.\n\n576. Information was transmitted to the Government about the cases of Zaldy Acono and Orsenio Mendez, who were reportedly arrested on 25 July 1993 by the 76th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in Quezon province under suspicion of being members of the New People's Army (NPA). When they were unable or unwilling to answer the soldiers' questions concerning the whereabouts of their alleged companions, they were allegedly slapped, kicked, hit in the stomach with rifle butts and had plastic placed over their heads so as to interfere with their breathing. They were then said to have been tied up for two days in the forest.\n\n577. On 10 November 1994 the Government replied that investigations conducted by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights (PCHR) Regional Office based in San Fernando, Pampanga, established that the 76th Infantry Battalion had never been stationed in Quezon province. Investigations by the PCHR in Region IV in San Pablo City likewise yielded negative results. The PCHR was still looking for other leads for the solution of the case.\n\n578. The Special Rapporteur by the same letter advised the Government that he had received information according to which members of the Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU), a paramilitary force established in 1987 to fight the armed rebel movement, had engaged in torture and ill-treatment of persons in their custody. It was alleged that the military, which is charged with supervising the CAFGU, frequently tolerated or even encouraged such abuses.\n\n579. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur transmitted the case of Emily Absalon, aged 13, who was allegedly raped on 4 July 1993 by two members of the CAFGU PNP 268th Mobile Force. The two men had gone to the victim's house at Mindigurin, barangay Malawaan, Rizal, Mindoro Occidental, to look for her father who they alleged was a member of the NPA. They were said to have ransacked the house and taken the victim, her two sisters and a brother towards barangay Magsikap, during which time the victim was allegedly separated from her siblings and raped by both men. The children were then brought home and warned that they would be killed if they told anyone of the incident. Their mother subsequently filed a complaint with the regional trial court at San Jose. The two CAFGU members were reported to have been arrested and detained at the San Jose provincial jail in Mindoro Occidental, but the outcome of any proceedings against them was unknown.\n\n580. The Government replied that three criminal cases of rape and robbery had been filed against two defendants who were detained at the Mindoro Occidental provincial jail and a trial was under way before branch 46 of the regional trial court in San Jose. The PCHR Regional Field Office in San Pablo, Laguna, in collaboration with the Office of the State Prosecutor, had acted as Special Prosecutor in the case.\n\n581. Finally, the Special Rapporteur advised the Government that he had received information that Eduardo Haz and two cousins, Geby Domigina and Armando Domigina, were tortured on 4 October 1992 by two CAFGU members with the assistance of around 30 soldiers of the 49th Batallion of Bentuco, Gubat, Sorsogon. It was alleged that the pregnant wife of Eduardo Haz, Lolita Domigina Haz, was shot and killed by one of the CAFGU members at her mother's residence at Sta. Lourdes, Barcelona, Sorsogon for alleged membership in the NPA. Some time later that day, her husband and the two cousins were reportedly seized and brought to the church and tied up. The soldiers then ordered six families occupying nearby houses to come out and watch the three men being tortured. The men were then taken into custody for interrogation by the soldiers. Geby and Armando Domigina were released, but Eduardo Haz was reportedly killed and his body discovered.\n\nPortugal\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government 582. By letter dated 17 August 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government the following cases of torture alleged to have occurred in the country.\n\n583. Carlos Robelo was arrested on 3 March 1993 by the judicial police (PJ) and allegedly beaten severely by PJ members in the station in Lisbon. After he appeared in court, the judge ordered him to be taken to hospital for treatment, but instead he was taken back to the station where the duty doctor noted only slight injuries. After his committal to prison to await trial, the Prison Services sent him to a private doctor for x-rays, which revealed five fractured ribs. He reportedly made a formal complaint to the Almada court, which passed the file to another office in Lisbon for investigation, but no inquiry was carried out. A new investigation was said to have been opened.\n\n584. Jos� Pedro Tavares Teles Rocha, a mentally disabled man, was reportedly stopped by two members of the public security police (PSP) and asked to identify himself. After he made what was said by witnesses to be a facetious reply, the two officers allegedly attacked him and kicked him while he was on the ground. After being detained overnight, he appeared in court the next day, reportedly with a swollen and purple face, and injuries to his neck. The judge suspended the hearing pending examination.\n\nInformation received from the Government with regard to cases included in previous reports 585. On 3 November 1993 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government information on the case Francisco Carretas, who was allegedly tortured by agents of the Almada gendarmerie unit in Charneca da Caparicia on 6 February 1992. By the same letter, the Special Rapporteur also communicated the case of Orlando Correia, who was allegedly assaulted by PJ officers on 9 September 1992 in Guarda prison. On 20 June 1994 the Government replied that a judicial procedure was under way in the case of Francisco Carretas, with results as yet undetermined. With respect to Orlando Correia, the Government on 10 August 1994 replied that an investigation by the PJ and the Public Ministry had concluded that there did not exist sufficient proof to sustain the accusation.\n\nQatar\n\nUrgent appeals 586. On 28 April 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government an urgent appeal on behalf of Gavin Sherrard-Smith, a British national, who was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and 50 lashes allegedly for selling alcohol. The sentence had reportedly been upheld by the court of appeal and fears were expressed that the flogging might be imminent. The Special Rapporteur advised the Government that he shared the views of other bodies in the United Nations system that corporal punishment was inconsistent with prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment enshrined in various international instruments.\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government 587. By letter dated 29 March 1994 the Special Rapporteur advised the Government that he had received information according to which persons arrested for political reasons were often subjected to several forms of ill-treatment, including sleep deprivation, in order to extract \"confessions\". Under procedures in force, police or security officials often without an arrest warrant may take a suspect for \"voluntary submission into police custody\" and must obtain a court warrant within 48 hours for continued detention. This provision allegedly often was abused by police and other security agencies to detain suspects by force and hold them incommunicado for 48 hours' interrogation without informing their families and friends that they had been arrested. Detainees were allegedly subjected to the greatest abuse during the first hours of interrogation and confessions thus obtained were often used as grounds upon which to apply for an arrest warrant.\n\n588. There is reportedly no legal requirement for prisoners to be brought promptly before a judge. Suspects held under the National Security Law may be interrogated for up to 50 days before they are charged, including up to 20 days by the arresting agency and a further 30 days by the prosecution. During this long period prisoners were sometimes allegedly subjected to prolonged and exhausting interrogation and denied immediate and regular access to their lawyers and families.\n\n589. Prisoners who claimed to have been tortured or ill-treated were said rarely to make a formal complaint and in only a few cases had successful prosecutions been carried out. Prisoners who had been ill-treated during interrogation were sometimes afraid to make a statement to this effect in court for fear of antagonizing the tribunal and thereby incurring a heavier prison sentence. Furthermore, it was said to be extremely difficult for a prisoner to prove ill-treatment, particularly when the form of such treatment was sleep deprivation, which leaves no visible trace on the body. Finally, there was said to be no independent body to investigate complaints of human rights violations. The Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the authority to decide whether or not a prosecution would take place, often appeared not to act on complaints, dismissing them without further explanation on the grounds that they had been investigated and proved to be unfounded.\n\n590. The Special Rapporteur also communicated to the Government the individual cases described in the following paragraphs.\n\n591. Lee Kun-hee, a Democratic Party worker, was arrested without a warrant on 26 September 1992 by officials of the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP). He was taken for questioning to the ANSP interrogation facility and was allegedly deprived of sleep for the first few days and repeatedly beaten. His wife was also arrested on 14 October and held for 48 hours during which time she was allegedly hit and threatened with not being allowed to see her baby for a substantial period of time. On 15 January 1993 Lee Kun-hee was sentenced to three years' imprisonment under the National Security Law and the Military Secrets Protection Law.\n\n592. Choi Chin-sop, a journalist working for the journal Mal, was arrested by officials of ANSP on 14 September 1992 and taken to the ANSP interrogation facility where for several days he was allegedly deprived of sleep. He was also said to have been beaten, stripped naked, forced to stand in the same position for long periods of time and forced to crawl with his hands behind his back and his head against the floor. On 24 February 1993 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment under the National Security Law.\n\n593. Son Pyong-son, a former politician, was arrested without a warrant on 26 September 1992 by officials of ANSP. At the ANSP interrogation facility he was reportedly beaten by teams of interrogators over a period of several days and forced to do repeated and strenuous physical exercises, such as squatting with his arms stretched out, standing on his head and standing on his hands. He was allegedly permitted only a few hours of sleep each day, was not permitted to see his lawyer until 5 October and was denied access to his family members until 17 October when he was transferred to a prison. In February 1993 he was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of joining an \"anti-State\" organization and passing State secrets to the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and was being held in Chonju prison.\n\n594. Park Seok-jin was arrested in July 1993 and sentenced to 1� years' imprisonment for deserting after making a \"declaration of conscience\" expressing his objection to completing his compulsory military service as a riot policeman. On 19 January 1994 he was allegedly beaten, tied with rope and ankle chains and put into a small \"punishment\" cell for 48 hours at Yongdungpo prison. Although the rope and ankle chain were subsequently removed he was subjected to a one- month term of close confinement for having failed to stand to attention when the director of the prison entered his cell on 19 January 1994.\n\nFollow-up to cases already transmitted to the Government 595. By the same letter, the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had received additional information regarding a number of cases previously transmitted to the Government which in some respects contradicted the replies provided by the latter.\n\n596. On 22 July 1993 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government on behalf of Noh Tae-hun, arrested on 15 July 1993. On 5 August 1993 the Government replied by indicating the circumstances of the arrest and subsequent detention of Noh Tae-hun and mentioning the fact that he had not been restricted from meeting his attorneys or family members. Further information received from the sources referred to the fact that Noh Tae-hun had been deprived of sleep during lengthy interrogation sessions. During the first 48 hours of his detention he was allegedly allowed less than two hours' sleep.\n\n597. Further information was also transmitted on the cases of Kim Sam-sok and Kim Un-ju, with regard to whom an urgent appeal had been addressed to the Government on 24 September 1993. In the reply provided on 22 October 1993 the Government stated that they had been treated humanely during interrogation and that no complaint had been filed by their family members or attorney with regard to their treatment in detention. According to the additional information received, Kim Sam-sok told his lawyer on 7 October 1993 that he had been stripped naked on several occasions and sexually assaulted by ANSP in order to force him to make a confession. On 20 September he attempted to commit suicide by hitting his head against a wall. On 21 September his wife was permitted to visit him and reported that his neck was in a cast, his head was swollen and his face was badly bruised and that he was unable to sit down because of a back injury. As for Kim Un-ju, she reportedly informed her lawyer that she had been deprived of sleep for several days after her arrest, was slapped and shaken, and was forced to do repeated physical exercises. She also reportedly stated that interrogators had threatened to strip her and abuse her sexually and that she made a confession which she later denied.\n\n598. On 12 November 1992 the Special Rapporteur communicated to the Government information received about the allegations of torture inflicted upon Kim Nak-jung and Noh Jong-sun, arrested in August 1992 and taken to ANSP. On 15 July 1993 the Government replied that after their arrest they had been permitted to meet their lawyers and that the allegations of beatings and sleep deprivation were unfounded. However, further information received indicated that Kim Nak-jung was not allowed to see his lawyer for 13 days and was in fact held incommunicado during that period. On 15 September he was transferred to the Seoul detention centre where he mentioned to visitors, who could see a scar on his head and bruises on his arms, that he had been deprived of sleep and beaten all over his body by a group of ANSP agents using clubs. As for Noh Jong-sun, he reportedly stated during his trial in early 1993 that his statements to ANSP and the prosecutor had been coerced by means of humiliation and use of brutal force.\n\nUrgent appeals 599. On 28 March 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal on behalf of Hwang Seung-hyun, Lee Yoon-jung, Lee Sang-yeop, Jang Gee-bum, Kim Mee-Kyung, Lee Kwon-Seop, members and supporters of the singing troupe Heemangsae, who were arrested on 24 March by about 15 plainclothes police officers who produced no arrest warrant. They were taken to the Security Division of Seoul police headquarters. The arrest reportedly took place after the troupe members had participated in a peaceful rally to demand the release of five other Heemangsae members detained on 21 and 22 February, apparently suspected of planning to stage a musical based on a book which the authorities maintained praised the People's Democratic Republic of Korea.\n\n600. On 20 May 1994 the Government replied that a warrant for the arrest of the six troupe members had been issued on 24 March 1994 and that they had been allowed to meet their attorney on the day of their arrest. On 25 March Lee Yoon-Jung and Lee Sang Yeop were held under the arrest warrants, but the other detainees were released. On 26 March, Lee Yoon-Jung's mother and Kim Mee-Kyung's father filed complaints against the policemen involved in the arrest on grounds of illegal arrest and detention and an investigation was being carried out on the basis of those complaints.\n\n601. The Special Rapporteur also transmitted an urgent appeal on 21 June 1994 on behalf of the following persons: Ahn Jae-ku, aged 61; Ahn Young-min; Ryu Nak-jin, aged 66; Kim Sung-hwan, a member of Korean Council of Youth Organizations (Hanchonghyop) in Pohang city; Kim Jin-bae; Jong Hwa-ryo; Jong Chang-soo; Hong Jong-hee and Park Rae-koon. These persons were among a group of at least 25 who were arrested on 14 June by ANSP and the police for alleged activities in support of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. According to ANSP, some of the prisoners, including Ahn Jab-ku, were accused of forming an underground branch of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and were said to have established in January 1993 a group called the National Front for Salvation of the Fatherland. Some of the other prisoners were accused of forming a group called the Korean Democratic Nationalistic Front. Those groups were said to support the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. The prisoners were reportedly being held for interrogation under the National Security Law.\n\n602. On 1 July 1994 the Government replied that the above-named individuals had been duly arrested pursuant to Korea's National Security Law and in full conformity with Korea's legal procedures and their rights under Korean law.\n\nRomania\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government and replies received\n\n603. By letter dated 28 April 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government information he had received in the cases described in the following paragraphs. On 4 August 1994 the Government sent replies with respect to the allegations, summaries of which follow their corresponding descriptions.\n\n604. Andrei Tanase Zanopol was arrested without a warrant on 27 June 1993 near his home in Mazepa, Galati, by two police officers. He was allegedly tied with wire to an iron bar at the entrance to a building and beaten severely by the two officers in front of witnesses. He was then taken to the police station where the beating reportedly continued. On 1 July his lawyer reported that Mr. Zanopol's testicles were swollen, one arm appeared to be in a cast and there were bruises all over his body and on his face. It was also reported that Mr. Zanopol had received medical treatment from a doctor who refused to give him a certificate describing his injuries.\n\n605. The Government replied that Camelia Zanopol had filed a complaint in 1993 to the Iai military prosecutor's office, which found that Andrei Zanopol had not been beaten by the police and ordered no penal proceedings against the officers. The military prosecution section of the General Prosecutor's Office, however, re-examined the case on 14 April 1994 and determined that the previous decision was illegal and without grounds and ordered that criminal proceedings be undertaken against the officers and that all the relevant evidence be produced.\n\n606. Costel Covalciuc, from Dorohoi, was arrested on 29 June 1993 at his home by two police officers. The following day, after a summary court hearing, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. On 4 July 1993 his family was informed that he had died that morning. Several members of the family reportedly went to the morgue and observed the body with blood-smeared hands and many bruises on the body, throat and temples. An autopsy was conducted and Covalciuc's father was given a form completed by the coroner which stated that the death had been \"non-violent\" and that it had been caused by an acute cardio-vascular insufficiency. The military prosecutor of Iai who investigated the death concluded that the victim was not subjected to ill-treatment in detention and that external lesions could have resulted from \"compression\".\n\n607. The Government replied that on 4 July, Costel Covalciuc had complained of severe chest pains and a doctor from Dorohoi hospital and inmates had attempted a heart massage. The doctor ordered him transferred to hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. Because the cause of death was pronounced non-violent, the Iai military prosecutor's office ordered that no criminal charges were to be brought in the case. However, reviewing the evidence, the military prosecution section of the General Prosecutor's Office on 14 April 1994 ordered a complete investigation and the re-examination of the forensic report by the Superior Forensic Commission of the Central Forensic Institute. Further measures would be taken upon receipt of the results of the re-examination.\n\n608. Viorel Baciu was arrested on 24 October 1988 and subsequently sentenced to several years' imprisonment on what were alleged to be false charges brought because of his father's activities as a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Considering that the charges were groundless and essentially illegal, the General Prosecutor on 8 January filed an extraordinary appeal and suspended further execution of the prison sentence, but the appeal was rejected and Viorel Baciu was reimprisoned on 8 February 1993. Following his arrest he was taken to the police station in Suceava and allegedly subjected to torture in order to force him to confess to the crimes with which he was charged. In the course of the torture he was beaten while suspended by the legs and on the soles of the feet. From 6 to 12 December 1988 he had to be treated in the Jilava prison hospital, reportedly for coughing and spitting blood and other injuries sustained during the investigation. In the presence of the investigating prosecutor, as well as during the trial, he retracted his confession, which was nevertheless taken into consideration by the Supreme Court.\n\n609. The Government replied that Viorel Baciu had made a complaint against a lieutenant colonel and other police officers but that the Iai military prosecutor's office had ordered that no criminal charges be brought. On 28 April 1994 the military prosecution section of the General Prosecutor's Office annulled the decision, finding it illegal and ungrounded, and ordered that charges be brought and the evidence produced. The case was pending.\n\nInformation received from the Government on cases included in previous reports 610. On 9 August 1994 the Government sent replies in regard to four individual cases transmitted by the Special Rapporteur in a letter dated 26 August 1993. The replies are summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\n611. In the case of Stefan Tasnadi, an ethnic Hungarian who was allegedly severely beaten with truncheons and fists by police on 25 August 1992 in Gherlu, Cluj county, the Cluj military prosecutor's office started an investigation into charges of abusive behaviour by two police officers. The testimony given during the investigation and the results of the forensic examination did not lead to the conclusion that Stefan Tasnadi had been beaten. Mr. Tasnadi had not informed the military prosecutor's office about the incident until 21 June 1993 and has since withdrawn the complaint.\n\n612. As to the case of Mihai Poteras, who was allegedly beaten for five days in the police station in Pascani, two police officers, Cuceac Gheorghe and Nistor Valeriu, were ordered committed for trial by the Bacu military prosecutor's office on the charge of abusive inquiry under the Romanian Penal Code. It was established that during 5 and 6 February 1993 the officers severely beat Postera Mihai for the purpose of compelling him to admit to the crime of robbery, thus causing him bodily injuries which required 16 days of medical assistance.\n\n613. According to the allegations transmitted by the Special Rapporteur, Doru Marian Beldie had been beaten with truncheons on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet for several hours at the 17th district police station in Bucharest. The Government replied that an investigation by the Bucharest military prosecutor's office concluded that there was no violence exerted against Doru Marian Beldie. He was convicted of \"sexual relations between persons of the same sex\" with the aggravating circumstances of committing the offence against a minor and sentenced to 4� years' imprisonment.\n\n614. Finally, in the case of Marcel Brosca, who was allegedly severely beaten by police in Teduci, the Iai military prosecutor's office concluded that no violence had been exerted against him. He was convicted of robbery and homosexual activity and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government 615. By letter dated 3 June 1994 the Special Rapporteur advised the Government that he had received information concerning the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi refugees held since 1991 in the camps of Artawiyya, which was closed in December 1992, and Rafha. According to the reports, the refugees had been tortured or ill-treated for a wide variety of perceived misconduct, including criticizing the camps' authorities, protesting living conditions and being \"disobedient\", or in order to extract \"confessions\". Forms of torture allegedly included systematic beatings all over the body, enforced standing for prolonged periods of time, the administration of electric shocks and dowsing with cold water while naked. Some persons were also allegedly subjected to hanging by the wrists from the ceiling or a high window (ta'liq), beatings on the soles of the feet (falaqa) and sleep deprivation for prolonged periods. Various forms of collective punishment, such as food and water deprivation, were also reportedly used against the refugees, particularly in response to protests about living conditions and treatment by the camp authorities.\n\n616. In August 1991 and July 1992 groups of refugees reportedly went on hunger strikes in Artawiyya camp demanding improvements in their living conditions and their resettlement in a third country. Many of those involved in these protests were later allegedly subjected to torture or ill-treatment, as in the cases summarized in the paragraphs below.\n\n617. Ya'rub Hassan Suri al-Khaffaji, the representative of block 11, compound 3 in Artawiyya camp, was on 13 September 1991 arrested with four other refugees following their participation in the first hunger strike in August 1991. They were taken to the \"Emergency Unit\" under accusation of sedition and inciting the refugees to strike. The soldiers reportedly forced him to take off his clothes and to lie on top of the bonnet of a car, the engine of which had been running for a period of time. The soldiers then allegedly rolled him across the bonnet, tied him to the side of the car, and beat him with clubs and lashes. After a doctor determined that his injuries were too severe to be treated at the camp clinic, he was transferred to the Hafr al-Baten military hospital and later to Riyadh military hospital. Both his kidneys were permanently damaged. In January 1992 Ya'rub al-Khaffaji was reportedly given financial compensation following an investigation by the military authorities. However, no independent judicial inquiry into the case was carried out and none of the perpetrators was known to have been brought to justice.\n\n618. As'ad 'Ali Hussein was arrested and taken to the \"Emergency Unit\" where he was stripped down to his underpants and handcuffed. He was then allegedly beaten with cables on his hands for about half an hour until his skin started peeling off, hit on the back with an iron bar and kicked. Thereafter he was tied to the back of a truck while naked and dragged along for three to five minutes, resulting in the dislocation of his left arm.\n\n619. Zahir Rizqi Saber was also punished as a result of his involvement in the hunger strike of 1991. He was allegedly stripped down to his underpants and tied to a wire fence between one and two hours, during which time he was beaten. The soldiers then cut his hair, mixed it with sand and water and forced him to eat it.\n\n620. Muhammad Khudhayr Mubarak Tu'ma was accused of sedition in the aftermath of the above-mentioned hunger strike. He was allegedly taken outside \"the Emergency Unit\", stripped of his clothes, beaten severely, forced to crawl on his stomach with his hands tied behind his back and simultaneously lashed with cables for over two hours. As a result, he was allegedly no longer able to move and was dragged back into a tent by the guards. He died a few hours later.\n\n621. Bassam Yusuf Ibrahim al-Shamiri joined the second hunger strike in July 1992 in Artawiyya. A few days after he began the strike he fell ill and was taken to the clinic. While he was still recovering an officer reportedly came to his room, accused him of seditious acts and hit him repeatedly on the back of the head with a club.\n\n622. The Special Rapporteur also transmitted information in the cases described in the paragraphs below.\n\n623. 'Ali Muhsin Abu-Zahra was arrested in March 1992 at his living quarters in block 6, compound 3 of the Artawiyya camp, on charges of writing and producing a play criticizing the administration of the camp. He was allegedly taken to the \"Emergency Unit\" where he was stripped naked, threatened with rape, subjected to falaqa, beaten and jolted by an electrified rod. He was released in April 1992 after spending one month in incommunicado detention.\n\n624. Dhia'Shabeeb was reportedly arrested in Artawiyya camp for having disobeyed an order issued by the camp authorities. He was allegedly taken outdoors and tied to a pole which had a bright lamp fixed at the top, attracting a large number of mosquitoes and other desert insects at night. When he was returned to his block the next day his body was bruised and severely swollen.\n\n625. Hussein al-Jizani was in compound 5 in Rafha camp on the night of 18 April 1993 when he reportedly fell ill and went out to seek medical help. He was spotted by an army patrol, stopped for breaching the night curfew, and repeatedly and violently beaten by the soldiers in the presence of 15 witnesses, as a result of which he died that night. It was also reported that the witnesses were ill-treated to force them to sign a statement to the effect that Husseil al-Jizani had died of a heart attack.\n\n626. The Special Rapporteur also informed the Government that he had received reports indicating that the punishment of flogging was widely used in the camp and was imposed by a Shari'a court judge for a wide range of offences, including sexual acts between unmarried heterosexual couples and the consumption of alcohol. Persons were allegedly brought before the judge in the absence of any defence counsel and often convicted solely on the basis of a \"confession\" signed under duress. Thus on 23 July 1992 four refugees from Diwaniyya were arrested in Rafha on charges relating to the consumption of alcohol. 'Abbas 'Ali Mahawi, charged and convicted of being in the company of men drinking alcohol, was sentenced to 73 days' imprisonment and 80 lashes. 'Ali Sabah Ward, charged and convicted of brewing alcohol, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and 400 lashes. Muhammad Masayri' Hassan, charged and convicted of alcohol consumption, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and 300 lashes. Hadi Nasser Hussein, charged and convicted of drinking and selling alcohol, was sentenced to 300 lashes. They were all said to have been administered the full number of lashes to which they had been sentenced.\n\nUrgent appeals 627. On 11 October 1994 the Special Rapporteur transmitted to the Government an urgent appeal concerning Dr. Mohamed Kamel Mohamed Khalifa, an Egyptian physician detained in El Brida prison in El Qasim, who reportedly was sentenced to flogging after being convicted of telling lies. He was said to have been so charged because he filed a complaint against the principal of Saoud El Kabir school in El Bakeereya, El Qasim, charging him with sexually abusing his son. Dr. Khalifa was reportedly sentenced to receive 80 lashes in front of the school when pupils were leaving, as well as another 120 lashes - 60 lashes twice after Friday prayers over a period of two weeks in El Bakeereya. The Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he shared the views of other bodies within the United Nations system that corporal punishment was inconsistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as enshrined in various international instruments.\n\nObservations 628. In the absence of information from the Government, the Special Rapporteur is disposed to consider that the allegations of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment and punishment of Iraqi refugees described above may be well founded.\n\nSenegal\n\nUrgent appeals sent and replies received 629. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government on 3 March 1994 on behalf of Lamine Samb, a teacher, who was arrested at his home on 17 February 1994 after taking part in a demonstration the previous day. He was taken to the Criminal Investigation Department in Dakar and, although in good health at the time of his arrest, he was two days later taken in a coma to the main hospital in Dakar, where he died shortly afterwards. Fears were expressed concerning the torture or ill-treatment to which he might have been subjected and which might have caused his death. According to the information received, some 40 other persons were also arrested following that demonstration. Fears were likewise expressed about the treatment to which they might be subjected during their detention.\n\n630. On 8 July 1994 the Government replied that Lamine Samb had been taken from custody to the main Dakar hospital on 19 February because he was vomiting and suffering from vertigo. An autopsy revealed a heart attack to be the cause of his death. Neither he nor any of the other arrested demonstrators was subjected to ill-treatment in detention.\n\nInformation received from the Government on cases included in previous reports 631. On 26 August 1993 the Special Rapporteur transmitted information on the case of Mody Sy, a parliamentarian who was reportedly detained in Dakar in May 1993 and tortured, including by electric shocks to his fingers and genitals, to make him confess to the murder of the Vice-President of the Constitutional Council. The Special Rapporteur also communicated the case of Ramata Gu�ye, arrested on 14 July 1993 in connection with the same investigation as Mr. Sy and allegedly tortured at Thi�s police station.\n\n632. By letter dated 20 January 1994 the Government replied that at the end of his police custody, Mody Sy was examined at his request by a doctor, whose official report made no mention of ill-treatment. After his first appearance before the examining magistrate on 27 May 1993, he was re-examined at the request of his counsel and in his official report the appointed doctor described Mr. Sy as being in good general health but noted the presence of \"scars of grazes on the anterior sides of the forearms and legs\" and referred to abdominal pains accompanied by hiccups for which he had already examined him twice since the commencement of his detention. When the abdominal symptoms recurred on 1 June 1993, Mody Sy was prescribed treatment and had a fibroscopy on 21 June 1993 and an X-ray of his lower back region on 14 July, the results being satisfactory. After an examining magistrate on 22 July 1993 ordered Mr. Sy to undergo a full examination, the doctor informed the magistrate that Mr. Sy had refused to undergo such an examination. In the case of Miss Ramata Gu�ye, a certificate supporting her allegations had not yet been produced before any authority. The procurator general to the court of appeal did not receive a complaint by Mr. Mody Sy's lawyers until 30 July 1993. This complaint gave rise to an immediate inquiry, whose findings were reflected in a report of 4 August 1993 of the Deputy Senior Commander of the National Gendarmerie, Under-Director of Military Justice. All of the police officers participating in the investigation of the assassination were questioned, including those who had been charged by Mr. Sy and Miss Gu�ye, with the exception of a certain senior sergeant who was unknown in the Western Legion of the Dakar gendarmerie. The inquiry produced no result, apart from charges by some and denials by others, and a search of the entire premises of the Thiong gendarmerie had proved fruitless.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nUrgent appeals 633. The Special Rapporteur sent five urgent appeals to the Government on behalf of the people mentioned below. The dates on which the appeals were transmitted appear in parenthesis at the end of the corresponding summaries.\n\n634. Johannes Setlae, an African National Congress (ANC) committee member in Mogogoe village, near Mafikeng, was detained on 12 January 1994 after police broke up a voter education meeting of about 100 people organized by members of the local ANC youth league. The local President of the youth league, Ofentse Kogotsitse, Johannes Setlae, and two other organizers of the meeting, at Ofentse's home near the meeting place, were ordered to \"disperse\" but Ofentse argued that he was, in fact, at his home. The police then reportedly attempted to assault the four men. When Ofentse's mother tried to intervene, one policeman allegedly hit her and she fell down, so prompting Johannes Setlae to throw an empty bottle at the police which struck one of the officers. The police reportedly then assaulted Johannes Setlae with blows from fists and open hands, booted feet, and sjamboks (whips), and arrested him. He was believed to be held incommunicado at Mmabatho police station and fears were expressed that he would be denied proper medical care for his injuries and be further subjected to ill-treatment.\n\n635. Information was also received with regard to the following persons arrested: Theo Mabusela, Chairperson of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), Western Cape Region; Michael Siyolo, PAC organizer, Western Cape Region; Mncebesi Leonard Naso; Zola Prince Mabala; Richard Dala, PAC Executive member, Western Cape Region; Konzaphi and Rhanugu. According to the reports, Michael Siyolo and Theo Mabusela were arrested in Cape Town on 3 January 1994 in connection with the police investigation into the murder of four people and wounding of seven others by gunmen who had attacked a tavern on 30 December 1993. The other detainees were arrested between 4 and 7 January, including Mncebisi Leonard Naso and Zola Prince Mabala, whom police arrested in the Eastern Cape near the Transkei border. It was reported that all of the detainees were being held incommunicado, apparently at different police stations in the Cape Town area, under section 29 of the Internal Security Act under which the police could detain a person incommunicado for interrogation purposes for 10-day periods renewable by the agreement of a Supreme Court judge (20 January 1994).\n\n636. Disturbances broke out at Pollsmoor prison on 18 March 1994 following an announcement by the Transitional Executive Council that certain categories of prisoners would not be allowed to vote. Some prisoners reportedly barricaded themselves into their cells and set fire to bedding and the prison staff fired tear-gas into locked cells and assaulted prisoners with batons. Injuries inflicted on prisoners were said to include open wounds and broken ribs, as in the case of Ebrahim October, who was allegedly assaulted and suffered head injuries. No independent medical access to the prisoners was permitted and relatives feared that those injured were being denied adequate medical care. At Boksburg prison on the East Rand, more than 60 prisoners were reportedly injured on 18 March after officers of the Internal Stability Unit (ISU) of the South African Police assisted prison staff in securing the release of two prison warders taken hostage by prisoners. After the warders had been released unharmed, members of the ISU reportedly lined up prisoners and beat them with batons (25 March 1994).\n\n637. Michael Mathe was arrested on 9 January 1994 in the East Rand township of Katlehong by officers of the ISU, after senior ANC and South African Communist Party officials and journalists visiting Katlehong were fired upon by gunmen from a nearby migrant worker's hostel. After the attack, officers of the ISU shot dead one ANC member, and injured another youth whom they arrested together with Michael Mathe, who was a member of a local self-defence unit. On the night of 9 January, when police officers returned with Michael Mathe to search his home, a witness reportedly observed that he was unrecognizable because his face had been so severely beaten. Between 9 and 11 January he was taken to Nyoni Farm police base, the headquarters of the SAP Political and Violent Crime Unit, where he was allegedly assaulted repeatedly under interrogation by police officers who also threatened to use a police dog to attack him. He later told his lawyer that, under this duress, he signed statements which were repeatedly rewritten by his interrogators. According to the information received, he appeared to be seriously affected by the torture and those visiting him recently have expressed concern about his deteriorating mental state (29 March 1994).\n\n638. The following persons from a rural area near Eshowe were reportedly arrested by police on 9 April 1994 and held under state of emergency regulations imposed in Natal province on 31 March 1994: Ollie Shange, Khumbuza Shange, Goodwill Shange, Bhekinkosi Shange, Mpusophe Shange, Bazakuyena Shange, Phendu Shange and Bhekuwiye Thene. They were said to be held at the Eshowe prison. The following persons were reportedly being held in a communal cell at Empangeni prison: Sibusiso Cele, Thokozani Ndlovu, William Sithole, Siyabonga Nthuli, Zwelakhe Mntambo, Efraim Mntambo, Patrick Cele, Torch Gumede, Desmond Mkhize, Sabelo Cele, Bhekuwakhe Vilakazi, Mbuso Bulunga, Thulani Mkhize, Thembinkosi Ngema, Dumisani Msibi, Xolani Thembe, Panama Ngema, Khulekani Zulu, Khumbulani Ngema. Sibusiso Cele and Thokozani Ndlovu, from Dlangezwa, Empageni, were arrested and allegedly assaulted at their homes on 11 April by officers of the ISU. William Sithole, who was arrested at his home in the Empangeni area on 10 April, was held in an ISU police vehicle for approximately 24 hours before the police reported his arrest to a police station. While inside the vehicle he was allegedly subjected to torture by having a rubber tube pulled tightly across his face as if to suffocate him, was choked, and was given electric shocks while being interrogated about the whereabouts of weapons. The 16 others, high school students aged between 16 and 20 years old, from the Matubatuba area, were arrested on 12 April during house-to-house searches and were allegedly handled roughly during their arrest. Andiras Gcaba was arrested in Port Shepstone on 19 April when police intercepted a taxi he was taking to Durban (28 April 1994).\n\n639. Zola Mkululi Prince Mabala, the subject of the 20 January urgent appeal, and Brian Vuyisile Madasi were arrested on 4 January 1994 in Elliot, in the Eastern Cape, and held incommunicado under section 29 of the Internal Security Act until 3 February. Brian Madasi alleged in the course of a court appearance on 3 February that after his arrest the police had assaulted him at Aliwal North police station by stabbing his penis with a long pin, that at Bellville South police station in Cape Town he was subjected to electric shocks on his fingers, and that at the offices of the Crime Intelligence Service in Loop street he was assaulted with the butt of a gun. Zola Mabala alleged that he had been hit with batons at Elliot police station and subjected to electric shocks at Bellville South police station (25 May 1994).\n\nSpain\n\nInformation transmitted to the Government and replies received 640. By letter dated 4 July 1994 the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that he had received information on the cases of torture summarized in the following paragraphs. The Government responded to them on 27 October 1994.\n\n641. Maite Elizegi Mitxelena was arrested on 24 September 1993 at her home in Oyarz�n Guip�zcoa, by members of the Civil Guard. During interrogation at the Tres Cantos command post in Madrid she was allegedly forced to remain in one position for a prolonged period and had a plastic bag placed over her face. She was released on 26 September 1993 without charge.\n\n642. Axier Go�i Arsuaga was arrested on 23 September 1993 at his home in Urnieta, Guip�zcoa by members of the Civil Guard who took him initially to the Antiguo, Donostia barracks and subsequently to the Tres Cantos command post and the headquarters of the Civil Guard (DGGC) in Madrid. During his detention, he was allegedly beaten severely on the head, stomach, back and testicles.

Gorka L�pez Canseco was arrested on 15 June 1993 at his home in Toloso, Guip�zcoa. Following his transfer to the Civil Guard barracks at Antiguo, he was reportedly subjected to constant threats against himself and his family, beaten about the head and burned on the back, probably with a cigarette. He was also forced to remain with his legs on the ground and his hands resting on the bed for one hour, while one civil guard sat on top of him and another beat him. Some hours later he was released without charge and he subsequently filed a judicial complaint.\n\n646. Jos� Lasarte Garmendia was arrested on 27 October 1993 at his home in Hernani by members of the Civil Guard. He was first taken to the Antiguo barracks and subsequently transferred to the DGGC in Madrid.

He was also allegedly forced to do press-ups to the point of exhaustion and was subjected to threats, including by having a gun put to his throat and his head. Following his release without charge, he lodged a judicial complaint. The Government replied that Mr. Ruiz was arrested on 26 April 1993 at 00.05 hours.

The corresponding medical report noted the presence of \"extensive bruising in the dorsal area\". He was released without charge on 18 May and he filed a judicial complaint on 25 May 1993.\n\n659. With respect to this case, the Government replied that the allegations of ill-treatment were false and that Mr. Barandalla never filed a complaint with the judicial authorities. At the moment of his arrest he resisted and the Civil Guards had to use force. On the other hand, it is not true that he was released without charges; in fact, he was subsequently sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.\n\n660. Euken Garmendia Mart�nez was arrested on 23 September 1993 at his home in Urnieta by members of the Civil Guard who reportedly took him first to the Antiguo barracks and subsequently to the Tres Cantos command post. He allegedly received blows to the testicles, head, neck and back, was obliged to do press-ups and had a plastic bag placed over his face. He was released without charge on 26 September 1993 and subsequently lodged a judicial complaint alleging torture.\n\n661. Pablo Aperribay Bediaga was arrested on 17 July 1993 in Basauri, Viscaya, by members of the Ertzainta autonomous police force. He reportedly received a beating at the Galdakano police station, as a result of which he had to be transferred to the hospital where he was given a surgical collar. The following day, he was released without charge and he subsequently lodged a judicial complaint alleging torture.\n\n662. With respect to this case, the Government sent a number of documents referring to the circumstances in which Mr. Aperribay was arrested. According to them, he resisted and caused injuries to a member of the police. It was therefore necessary to use force, as a result of which he was injured in both arms and the left leg. He was subsequently taken to a clinic.\n\n663. Ismael Berasategui was arrested on 4 September 1993 at a road block set up by the Civil Guard at Alto de Arlab�n, Alava, and was subsequently transferred to the Sasomendi barracks. A hood was reportedly placed over his head and he was forced to do press-ups for a period of 11 hours while being beaten with bare hands and with a sheaf of papers. He also allegedly received death threats. He was released the following day without charge and he lodged a judicial complaint on 8 September 1993.\n\n664. With respect to this case the Government informed that Mr. Berasategui remained in detention from 8.30 p.m. to 6.20 a.m. and that from 4.30 he was interrogated in the presence of his lawyer. The allegation that he was ill-treated for 11 hours is therefore false. Moreover, he never made a complaint before a judicial authority.\n\n665. Juan Calvo Azabal was arrested on 19 August 1993 at Nanclares de Oca, Alava, by members of the Ertzaintza police, who accused him of having stolen a vehicle at the Arkante base in Alava. According to the forensic report, his death was caused by asphyxiation triggered by the self-defence sprays used by the police. In addition, numerous wounds were reportedly discovered on the body.\n\n666. With respect to this case, the Government sent copies of a number of documents referring to the investigation carried out by the Public Ministry and the judge into Mr. Calvo's death. According to them, the police had to use the above-mentioned spray when they were attacked by the detainee who was trying to run away. At the same time he was severely beaten. Judicial procedings were initiated against eight policemen accused of being responsible for the death.\n\nFollow-up to cases included in previous reports 667. In his letter of 4 July 1994 the Special Rapporteur reminded the Government of a number of cases transmitted in 1993 with respect to which investigations were pending. The Government referred to them in its letter of 27 October 1994. Regarding Eduardo Basabe Larrinaga and Germ�n Crist�bal Aznar, the Government indicated that on 25 February 1994 the cases had been provisionally"
