        "text": "When you lose two crucial points against a team that has recorded 50 defeats and only four wins in the last 34 competitive matches, then the talk of qualifying for the European Championship seems a bit frivolous.\n\nEspecially when the impression is reinforced by the unconvincing and almost idealess game against Lithuania (2:2) at the \"Darius i Girenas\" stadium in Kaunas.\n\nNevertheless, the theory says that the football team of Montenegro still has a chance to qualify for EURO 2024 in Germany, and as long as there is a chance, the \"falcons\" should not give up.\n\nHowever, Miodrag Radulović's boys will have to surpass themselves and erase some bad things from the past until the end of the qualification.\n\nTo begin with, they will have to overcome Bulgaria under Gorica for the first time in history (after three draws), and then Serbia in the middle of Belgrade, to whom they gave only a goal in the previous three matches, to be better than Hungary in Budapest, to \"take revenge\". Lithuania...\n\nIn translation, all the victories until the end of the qualifiers lead Montenegro to Germany, and the \"falcons\" have tied their four victories in a row in competitive matches only once in history - in the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup, when they defeated San Marino, Ukraine and Moldova twice.\n\nLithuania and Bulgaria could make Montenegro's job easier, with possible victories over Serbia, but the question is how realistic that is.\n\nAll the mentioned matches will be decisive, and over the past fifteen years we have also learned that Montenegrin footballers mostly lost such matches.\n\nChernih, Gazarjan, Zabicer, Georgiev\n\nFedor Chernyh \"stole\" two points from Montenegro yesterday in Kaunas with a great goal in the 94th minute, and it was the fourth time that the \"falcons\" lost points in stoppage time.\n\nIn the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, Blagoj Georgijev shocked Podgorica with a free kick in the 92nd and gave Bulgaria a point (2:2), while Montenegro lost a 2016:2 lead against Austria \"under Gorica\" ​​in the EURO 1 - Marcel Zabicer scored the goal for the turnaround in the visitors' victory in the 92nd minute.\n\nIn the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, Montenegro lost an even bigger advantage in Yerevan (2:0) - Gevor Gazarjan scored a goal in the 93rd to direct a great turnaround for Armenia (3:2)."
