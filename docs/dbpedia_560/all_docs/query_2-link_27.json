        "text": "Abstract\n\nObjective: Hybrid coronary revascularization is an alter-native for treatment for high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. We evaluated the efficacy of staged hybrid coronary revascularization for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery disease in high-risk patients.\n\nMethods: Patients with left main or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis who are not good can-didates for percutaneous coronary intervention and who had suitable lesions in the right coronary and circumflex arteries were considered for staged hybrid therapy if they had poor left ventricular functions (ejection fraction <0.40) and comor-bid illnesses. From January 2008 through December 2010,Â 11 patients (8 men, 3 women; mean age: 66.1 Â± 9.1 years) were treated with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting com-bined with staged percutaneous coronary intervention. Nine patients had left main coronary artery stenosis together with circumflex or right coronary artery stenosis, and 2 patients had proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and right coronary artery stenosis.\n\nResults: After off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, procedure-related complications did not occur, and there was no in-hospital death. Coronary re-angiography after a median of 16 days revealed patent and functioning left inter-nal mammarian artery grafts in all patients. Applying subse-quent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and occasional stenting (n = 14), a total of 14 lesions were treated successfully. Procedure related complications did not occur. All patients remained angina-free, and no stress electrocar-diographic changes were recorded."
