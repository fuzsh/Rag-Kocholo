        "text": "14-15.12.2023\n\nForum Theater play “Everything” with its consecutive performances in Prishtina and Gjilan has brought to the forefront the challenges of breastfeeding mothers.\n\nThe first performance took place on December 14, 2023, at the “Dr. Ali Sokoli” High School of Medicine in Prishtina, while the second performance was held on December 15 at the “Xhavit Ahmeti” High School of Natural Sciences in Gjilan.\n\n“Everything” came as a stage narrative that depicts the experiences of women, particularly breastfeeding mothers, in our society and the expectations set for them to fulfill multiple roles simultaneously. The performance explores societal pressures and the confrontation of children with the challenges that arise as a result of this reality.\n\nThe performance focuses on the highlighted issues of breastfeeding mothers, touching on their emotions, daily challenges, and balancing family duties with professional aspirations. Strong dialogues and intricate moments reveal the emotional journey of these women, leaving space for reflection for the audience.\n\nThis performance took the audience on an emotional journey into the world of a breastfeeding mother, opening a window to better understand their reality and challenges. Through the show, the youth inspired the audience to acknowledge and address these issues, challenge social norms, and promote a more inclusive and just society for everyone.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the show, the audience had the opportunity to pose numerous questions to the characters and provide comments and advice on the discussed topic. A broad, active, and profound debate took place between the audience and the characters, conveying the message that violence should not be tolerated, and oppression against women must come to an end.\n\nActors in this performance were: Lorea Dauti, Donat Kadriu, Blerza Krasniqi, Bekir Lahi, Teah Kastrati, Besart Krasniqi. “Everything” was created under the mentorship of the actress from the Artpolis Ensemble, Qendresa Kajtazi.\n\nThis performance was organized by Artpolis as part of the project “Gender Equality through Art and Activism,” supported by UNFPA."
