A dislocation of art lovers into a space designated for citizens movements.\n\nThe biggest and only overpass that is build in one of most frequented streets looks like is not the right solution for citizens needs.

Enjoy this premiere experience, we believe.\n\nMonday, 7th September at 20:00h, str.
