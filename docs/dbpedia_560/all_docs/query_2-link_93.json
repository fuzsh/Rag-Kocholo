According to reports compiled by investigators, Hurley returned to the hotel at 3:30 o’clock, several hours after he had been thrown at the New York Coliseum by Emil Dusek, 205-pound wrestler of Omaha, Neb. The body was found, fully clad, some time later in a courtyard in the rear of the hotel.\n\nTony Felice, another wrestler residing at the hotel, declared Hurley, while he had improved rapidly since entering the professional mat sport and was regarded as a coming star, had tired of the grappling work and intended to quit shortly and go into business with his father. Hurley, standing well over six feet, weighed 215 pounds and was extremely proud of his ability to incite the fans. He was placed on a Syracuse mat card last fall when the Disabled War Veterans decided to sponsor professional wrestling and made such a hit on his first appearance that he was brought back several times for repeat performances.\n\nHurley also was “built up” in the Boston area and drew out the customers in Baltimore, Rochester and other cities on the mat chain whenever he was billed with a rough and ready foe. Strangely enough, Emil Dusek, who defeated Hurley in his final ring encounter, is scheduled to show in Syracuse on Wednesday, March 21, to oppose Joe Savoldi, the ex-Notre Dame football star, in the main bout of a card rigged up by John Contos, Baltimore promoter. Police notified Hurley’s mother, Mrs. J.B.

Reynolds' wife, Alice Martin Reynolds, is under a charge of murder as a result of the fatal shooting, several weeks ago, in a cafe of James Meyers, Cincinnati politician, and Philip Citron, also of Cincinnati. Pending report of a grand jury in the case, Mrs. Reynolds was freed on $15,000 bond to permit treatment of an illness. Police have said that Reynolds was owner of a gun that figured in the affray.

It took the jury less than two hours last night to decide that the wrestler and two co-defendants were not guilty of shooting to death James Meyers, 52, in a cafe brawl in the early morning of March 11. Reynolds, his wife Alice, and a friend, David Polinsky, 28, were charged with second-degree murder. Although Polinsky admitted he fired at Meyers, the defense maintained it was in self-defense, and defense attorneys contended his bullet did not kill Meyers. Defense counsel argued also that \"full justice\" already had been done, holding Meyers and Citron killed each other. All three defendants wept freely as they thanked the jury and accepted the congratulations of friends.\n\nWho is When It Was Cool?\n\nWhen It Was Cool is a family run website operated by the husband & wife duo of Karl & Tonya but supported by an incredible team of content providers.
