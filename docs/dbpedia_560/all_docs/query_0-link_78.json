The basics of the two pulse sequences are first described, including the details of the inversion preparation and imaging sequences with accompanying mathematical formulae for choosing the inversion time in a variety of scenarios for use on clinical MRI scanners. Magnetization preparation (or T2prep), a strategy for improving image signal-to-noise ratio and contrast and reducing T 1 weighting at high field strengths, is also described. Lastly, image artifacts commonly associated with FLAIR and DIR are described with clinical examples, to help avoid misdiagnosis. 5 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson.

Methodology: The study was based on 33 joints of 17 patients referred for MR imaging of the TMJ. Regions of interest were placed over retrodiscal tissue and gray matter (GM) on FLAIR images. Using signal intensities of GM as reference points, signal intensity ratios (SIR) of retrodiscal tissue were calculated. SIRs in painful TMJ were compared with those in painless TMJ. Wilcoxon's Rank Sum Test was used to analyze the difference in SIRs between the painful and painless groups (P<0Â·05). Results: The SIRs of retrodiscal tissue were significantly higher in painful joints than in painless joints. Conclusion: FLAIR sequences provide a high signal in patients having painful TMJ, and it suggests that retrodiscal tissue in painful TMJ contains elements such as protein.\n\nDiagnosis of retrodiscal tissue in painful temporomandibular joint (TMJ) by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuroda, Migiwa; Otonari-Yamamoto, Mika; Sano, Tsukasa; Fujikura, Mamiko; Wakoh, Mamoru\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to analyze the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity of the retrodiscal tissue in a painful temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and to develop a diagnostic system based on FLAIR data.

A total of 31 joints (28 patients) with JE were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regions of interest were placed over JE, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gray matter (GM) on T2-weighted and FLAIR images and their signal intensities compared. The signal intensity ratios (SIRs) of JE and CSF were calculated with GM as the reference point. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used for the statistical analysis. The SIR of JE showed a strong correlation between T2-weighted and FLAIR images. However, no correlation was observed for CSF. The average suppression ratio for JE was lower than that for CSF. MRI using FLAIR sequences revealed that JE was not just water content, but a fluid accumulation containing elements such as protein. Further studies are needed, and FLAIR sequences could be useful for the diagnosis of pain and symptoms of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Copyright Â© 2011 Mosby, Inc.

However, the inter-rater agreement of diffusion-weighted image FLAIR mismatch is low. We hypothesized that color-coded images would increase its inter-rater agreement. Patients with ischemic stroke <24 hours of a clear onset were retrospectively studied. FLAIR signal change was rated as negative, subtle, or obvious on conventional and color-coded FLAIR images based on visual inspection. Inter-rater agreement was evaluated using Îº and percent agreement. The predictive value of diffusion-weighted image FLAIR mismatch for identification of patients <4.5 hours of symptom onset was evaluated. One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled. The inter-rater agreement of FLAIR signal change improved from 69.9% (k=0.538) with conventional images to 85.8% (k=0.754) with color-coded images (P=0.004). Discrepantly rated patients on conventional, but not on color-coded images, had a higher prevalence of cardioembolic stroke (P=0.02) and cortical infarction (P=0.04). The positive predictive value for patients <4.5 hours of onset was 85.3% and 71.9% with conventional and 95.7% and 82.1% with color-coded images, by each rater. Color-coded FLAIR images increased the inter-rater agreement of diffusion-weighted image FLAIR recovery mismatch and may ultimately help identify unknown-onset stroke patients appropriate for thrombolysis.

Fifteen joints (15 patients) with MF were subjected to MR imaging to obtain T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Regions of interest were placed on MF, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gray matter (GM), and their signal intensities were measured on both images. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) obtained by the signal intensity of GM between MF and CSF was compared in T2-weighted and FLAIR images. The average SIR of MF was lower than that of CSF on T2-weighted images, whereas it was higher on FLAIR images. The average suppression ratio of the signal intensity was lower for MF (24.1%) than for CSF (71.4%). MF may contain elements such as protein that are capable of inducing a shortened T1 relaxation time on MR images. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

While individual AÎ²-accumulation can be measured non-invasively using Pittsburgh Compund-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequence, capable of indicating heterogeneous age-related brain pathologies associated with tissue-edema. In the current study cognitively normal elderly subjects were investigated for regional correlation of PiB- and FLAIR intensity. Methods: Fourteen healthy elderly subjects without known history of cognitive impairment received 11C-PiB-PET for estimation of regional AÎ²-load. In addition, whole brain T1-MPRAGE and FLAIR-MRI sequences were acquired at high field strength of 7 Tesla (7T). Volume-normalized intensities of brain regions were assessed by applying an automated subcortical segmentation algorithm for spatial definition of brain structures. Statistical dependence between FLAIR- and PiB-PET intensities was tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho), followed by HolmâBonferroni correction for multiple testing. Results: Neuropsychological testing revealed normal cognitive performance levels in all participants. Mean regional PiB-PET and FLAIR intensities were normally distributed and independent. Significant correlation between volume-normalized PiB-PET signals and FLAIR intensities resulted for Hippocampus (right: rho = 0.86; left: rho = 0.84), Brainstem (rho = 0.85) and left Basal Ganglia vessel region (rho = 0.82). Conclusions: Our finding of a significant relationship between PiB- and FLAIR intensity mainly observable in the Hippocampus and Brainstem, indicates regional AÎ² associated tissue-edema in cognitively normal elderly subjects. Further studies including clinical populations are necessary to clarify the relevance of our findings for estimating individual risk for age-related neurodegenerative\n\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery: correlations of hippocampal cell densities with signal abnormalities.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiehl, B; Najm, I; Mohamed, A; Wyllie, E; Babb, T; Ying, Z; Hilbig, A; Bingaman, W; LÃ¼ders, H O; Ruggieri, P\n\n2001-09-25\n\nHippocampal sclerosis (HS) is characterized by hippocampal atrophy and increased signal on T2-weighted images and on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. To quantitate cell loss and compare it with signal abnormalities on FLAIR images. Thirty-one patients with temporal lobe resection, pathologically proven HS, and Engel class I and II outcome were included: 20 with HS only and 11 with HS associated with pathologically proven cortical dysplasia (dual pathology). The signal intensity on FLAIR was rated as present or absent in the hippocampus and correlated with the neuronal losses in the hippocampus. FLAIR signal increases were present in 77% (24/31) of all patients studied. In patients with isolated HS, 90% (18/20) had ipsilateral signal increases, but in patients with dual pathology, only 55% (6/11; p < 0.02) showed FLAIR signal increase. Hippocampal cell losses were significantly higher in the isolated HS group. The average cell loss in patients with FLAIR signal abnormalities was 64.8 +/- 8.0% as compared with only 32.7 +/- 5.1% in patients with no FLAIR signal abnormalities. There was a significant positive correlation between the presence of signal abnormality and average hippocampal cell loss in both pathologic groups. Ipsilateral FLAIR signal abnormalities occur in the majority of patients with isolated HS but are less frequent in those with dual pathology. The presence of increased FLAIR signal is correlated with higher hippocampal cell loss.\n\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensities in predicting cerebral hyperperfusion after intracranial arterial stenting.\n\nPubMed\n\nWan, Chih-Cheng; Chen, David Yen-Ting; Tseng, Ying-Chi; Yan, Feng-Xian; Lee, Kun-Yu; Chiang, Chen-Hua; Chen, Chi-Jen\n\n2017-08-01\n\nNo reliable imaging sign predicting cerebral hyperperfusion after intracranial arterial stenting (IAS) had been described in the literature. This study evaluated the effect of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensities (FVHs), also called hyperintense vessel sign on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MR images, in predicting significant increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) defined by arterial spin labeling (ASL) after IAS. We reviewed ASL CBF images and T2-FLAIR MR images before (D0), 1Â day after (D1), and 3Â days after (D3) IAS of 16 patients. T1-weighted MR images were used as cerebral maps for calculating CBF. The changes in CBF values after IAS were calculated in and compared among stenting and nonstenting vascular territories. An increase more than 50% of CBF was considered as hyperperfusion. The effect of FVHs in predicting hyperperfusion was calculated. The D1 CBF value was significantly higher than the D0 CBF value in stenting vascular, contralateral anterior cerebral artery, contralateral middle cerebral artery, and contralateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories (all PÂ <Â .05). The D1 and D3 CBF values were significantly higher than the D0 CBF value in overall vascular (PÂ <Â .001), overall nonstenting vascular (PÂ <Â .001), and ipsilateral PCA (PÂ <Â .05) territories. The rate of more than 50% increases in CBF was significantly higher in patients who exhibited asymmetric FVHs than in those who did not exhibit these findings. FVHs could be a critical predictor of a significant increase in CBF after IAS.\n\nContrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vs. contrast-enhanced spin echo T1-weighted brain imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nFalzone, Cristian; Rossi, Federica; Calistri, Maurizio; Tranquillo, Massimo; Baroni, Massimo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn humans, contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging plays an important role in detecting brain disease. The aim of this study was to define the clinical utility of contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging by comparing the results with those with contrast-enhanced spin echo T1-weighted images (SE T1WI) in animals with different brain disorders. Forty-one dogs and five cats with a clinical suspicion of brain disease and 30 normal animals (25 dogs and five cats) were evaluated using a 0.2 T permanent magnet. Before contrast medium injection, spin echo T1-weighted, SE T1WI, and FLAIR sequences were acquired in three planes. SE T1WI and FLAIR images were also acquired after gadolinium injection. Sensitivity in detecting the number, location, margin, and enhancement pattern and rate were evaluated. No lesions were found in a normal animal. In affected animals, 48 lesions in 34 patients were detected in contrast-enhanced SE T1WI whereas 81 lesions in 44 patients were detected in contrast-enhanced FLAIR images. There was no difference in the characteristics of the margins or enhancement pattern of the detected lesions. The objective enhancement rate, the mean value between lesion-to-white matter ratio and lesion-to-gray matter ratio, although representing an overlap of T1 and T2 effects and not pure contrast medium shortening of T1 relaxation, was better in contrast-enhanced FLAIR images. These results suggest a superiority of contrast-enhanced FLAIR images as compared with contrast-enhanced SE T1WI in detecting enhancing brain lesions.\n\nCharacteristic MRI findings in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures: diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, E J; Kim, K K; Lee, E K; Lee, J E\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo describe characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures, and evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. Possible underlying mechanisms of this condition are also discussed. Eleven patients with hyperglycaemia-induced seizures and MRI abnormalities were retrospectively studied. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, MRI findings, and clinical outcomes were analysed. All patients, except one, presented with focal seizures, simple or complex partial seizures, or negative motor seizures. All patients had long-standing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The MRI abnormalities observed acutely were focal subcortical hypointensities on T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging in all patients with overlying cortical gyral T2 hyperintensities in five. Focal overlying cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging or contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was observed in all patients. Contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was superior to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging for detecting characteristic cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed mildly restricted diffusion in four of five patients with cortical gyral T2 hyperintensity. In nine patients, the lesions were localised in the parietal or parieto-occipital lobes. The other two patients showed localised precentral gyral lesions. After treatment, the neurological symptoms, including the seizures, improved in all patients. On clinical recovery, the subcortical T2 hypointensity, gyral or leptomeningeal enhancement, and overlying cortical T2 hyperintensities resolved. Recognition of these radiological abnormalities in patients with hyperglycaemia-induced seizures is important in restricting unwarranted investigations and initiating early therapy. These patients generally have a good prognosis. Copyright Â© 2016 The Royal College of Radiologists.

We prospectively identified patients who showed CSF space enhancement on FLAIR images. Nineteen patients-5 acute-phase and 14 scheduled-underwent 21 CAS procedures. Balloon catheters were navigated across stenoses, angioplasty was performed using a neuroprotective balloon, and stents were placed with after dilation under distal balloon protection. CSF space hyperintensity or obscuration on FLAIR after versus before CAS indicated CSF space enhancement. Correlations with clinical factors were examined. CSF space was enhanced on FLAIR in 12 (57.1%) cases. Postprocedural CSF space enhancement was significantly related to age, stenosis rate, acute-stage procedure, and total occlusion time. All acute-stage CAS patients showed delayed enhancement. Only age was associated with delayed CSF space enhancement in scheduled CAS patients. Ischemic intolerance for severe carotid artery stenosis and temporary neuroprotective balloon occlusion, causing reperfusion injury, seem to be the main factors that underlie BBB disruption with delayed CSF space enhancement shortly after CAS, rather than sudden poststenting hemodynamic change. Our results suggest that factors related to hemodynamic instability or ischemic intolerance seem to be associated with post-CAS BBB vulnerability. Patients at risk for hemodynamic instability or with ischemic intolerance, which decrease BBB integrity, require careful management to prevent intracranial hemorrhagic and other post-CAS complications.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of focal cortical dysplasia: Comparison of 3D and 2D fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences at 3T.\n\nPubMed\n\nTschampa, Henriette J; Urbach, Horst; Malter, Michael; Surges, Rainer; Greschus, Susanne; Gieseke, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a frequent finding in drug resistant epilepsy. The aim of our study was to evaluate an isotropic high-resolution 3-dimensional Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (3D FLAIR) at 3T in comparison to standard 2D FLAIR in the diagnosis of FCD. In a prospective study, 19 epilepsy patients with the MR diagnosis of FCD were examined with a sagittal 3D FLAIR sequence with modulated refocusing flip angle (slice thickness 1.10mm) and a 2D FLAIR in the coronal (thk. 3mm) and axial planes (thk. 2mm). Manually placed regions of interest were used for quantitative analysis. Qualitative image analysis was performed by two neuroradiologists in consensus. Contrast between gray and white matter (p â¤ 0.02), the lesion (p â¤ 0.031) or hyperintense extension to the ventricle (p â¤ 0.021) and white matter was significantly higher in 2D than in 3D FLAIR sequences. In the visual analysis there was no difference between 2D and 3D sequences. Conventional 2D FLAIR sequences yield a higher image contrast compared to the employed 3D FLAIR sequence in patients with FCDs. Potential advantages of 3D imaging using surface rendering or automated techniques for lesion detection have to be further elucidated. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Eighteen raters independently scored anonymized magnetic resonance imaging scans of 30 participants from a multicentre thrombectomy trial, in 2 different reading sessions. Agreement was measured using Fleiss Îº and Cohen Îº statistics. Interrater agreement for DWI-ASPECTS was slight (Îº=0.17 [0.14-0.21]). Four raters (22.2%) had a substantial (or higher) intrarater agreement. Dichotomization of the DWI-ASPECTS (0-5 versus 6-10 or 0-6 versus 7-10) increased the interrater agreement to a substantial level (Îº=0.62 [0.48-0.75] and 0.68 [0.55-0.79], respectively) and more raters reached a substantial (or higher) intrarater agreement (17/18 raters [94.4%]). Interrater agreement for DWI-FLAIR mismatch was moderate (Îº=0.43 [0.33-0.57]); 11 raters (61.1%) reached a substantial (or higher) intrarater agreement. Agreement between clinicians assessing DWI-ASPECTS and DWI-FLAIR mismatch may not be sufficient to make repeatable clinical decisions in mechanical thrombectomy. The dichotomization of the DWI-ASPECTS (0-5 versus 0-6 or 0-6 versus 7-10) improved interrater and intrarater agreement, however, its relevance for patients selection for mechanical thrombectomy needs to be validated in a randomized trial.

However, painful joints often show no such signaling abnormalities, making the diagnosis of TMJ disorders difficult in the clinical setting. An association has been suggested between TMJ bone marrow change and TMJ pain, but even when such change results in slight pain, it may be too slight to be visually apparent on MR images. We hypothesized that fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) can be used to detect such minimal changes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an association between signal intensity on FLAIR images and pain in the TMJ. The study included 85 TMJs in 45 patients referred to our department for MRI. The signal intensity on FLAIR images was measured. Pain was evaluated based on the visual analog scale. An unpaired t test and Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient were used for the statistical analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Signal intensity on the FLAIR images was significantly higher in painful than in nonpainful TMJs, although a significant correlation was not observed between the signal intensity and the pain score. The results of this study suggest an association between abnormalities in the marrow of the mandibular condyle and pain. They also indicate that FLAIR imaging is a useful tool in the clinical diagnosis of painful TMJs.\n\nSodium imaging of the human knee using soft inversion recovery fluid attenuation.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeldman, Rebecca E; Stobbe, Robert; Watts, Alexander; Beaulieu, Christian\n\n2013-09-01\n\nSodium signal strength in MRI is low when compared with (1)H. Thus, image voxel volumes must be relatively large in order to produce a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The measurement of sodium in cartilage is hindered by conflation with signal from the adjacent fluid spaces. Inversion recovery can be used to null signal from fluid, but reduces SNR. The purpose of this work was to optimize inversion recovery sodium MRI to enhance cartilage SNR while nulling fluid. Sodium relaxation was first measured for knee cartilage (T1=21Â±1 ms, T(2 fast)(â)=0.8Â±0.2 ms, T(2 slow)(â)=19.7Â±0.5 ms) and fluid (T1=48Â±3 ms, T2(â)=47Â±4 ms) in nine healthy subjects at 4.7 T. The rapid relaxation of cartilage in relation to fluid permits the use of a lengthened inversion pulse to preferentially invert the fluid components. Simulations of inversion pulse length were performed to yield a cartilage SNR enhancing combination of parameters that nulled fluid. The simulations were validated in a phantom and then in vivo. B0 inhomogeneity was measured and the effect of off-resonance during the soft inversion pulse was assessed with simulation. Soft inversion recovery yielded twice the SNR and much improved sodium images of cartilage in human knee with little confounding signal from fluid. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

H.; Itoh, R.; Melhem, E. R.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine the effects of MR sequence (fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery [FLAIR], proton density--weighted, and T2-weighted) and of lesion location on sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated FLAIR, proton density-weighted, and T2-weighted brain images with 3-mm lesions using published parameters for acute multiple sclerosis plaques. Each image contained from zero to five lesions that were distributed among cortical-subcortical, periventricular, and deep white matter regions; on either side; and anterior or posterior in position. We presented images of 540 lesions, distributed among 2592 image regions, to six neuroradiologists. We constructed a contingency table for image regions with lesions and another for image regions without lesions (normal). Each table included the following: the reviewer's number (1--6); the MR sequence; the side, position, and region of the lesion; and the reviewer's response (lesion present or absent [normal]). We performed chi-square and log-linear analyses. RESULTS: The FLAIR sequence yielded the highest true-positive rates (p < 0.001) and the highest true-negative rates (p < 0.001). Regions also differed in reviewers' true-positive rates (p < 0.001) and true-negative rates (p = 0.002). The true-positive rate model generated by log-linear analysis contained an additional sequence-location interaction. The true-negative rate model generated by log-linear analysis confirmed these associations, but no higher order interactions were added. CONCLUSION: We developed software with which we can generate brain images of a wide range of pulse sequences and that allows us to specify the location, size, shape, and intrinsic characteristics of simulated lesions. We found that the use of FLAIR sequences increases detection accuracy for cortical-subcortical and periventricular lesions over that associated with proton density- and T2-weighted sequences.\n\nIvy Sign on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Images in Moyamoya Disease: Correlation with Clinical Severity and Old Brain Lesions.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeo, Kwon-Duk; Suh, Sang Hyun; Kim, Yong Bae; Kim, Ji Hwa; Ahn, Sung Jun; Kim, Dong-Seok; Lee, Kyung-Yul\n\n2015-09-01\n\nLeptomeningeal collateral, in moyamoya disease (MMD), appears as an ivy sign on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images. There has been little investigation into the relationship between presentation of ivy signs and old brain lesions. We aimed to evaluate clinical significance of ivy signs and whether they correlate with old brain lesions and the severity of clinical symptoms in patients with MMD. FLAIR images of 83 patients were reviewed. Each cerebral hemisphere was divided into 4 regions and each region was scored based on the prominence of the ivy sign. Total ivy score (TIS) was defined as the sum of the scores from the eight regions and dominant hemispheric ivy sign (DHI) was determined by comparing the ivy scores from each hemisphere. According to the degree of ischemic symptoms, patients were classified into four subgroups: 1) nonspecific symptoms without motor weakness, 2) single transient ischemic attack (TIA), 3) recurrent TIA, or 4) complete stroke. TIS was significantly different as follows: 4.86Â±2.55 in patients with nonspecific symptoms, 5.89Â±3.10 in patients with single TIA, 9.60Â±3.98 in patients with recurrent TIA and 8.37Â±3.39 in patients with complete stroke (p=0.003). TIS associated with old lesions was significantly higher than those not associated with old lesions (9.35Â±4.22 vs. 7.49Â±3.37, p=0.032). We found a significant correlation between DHI and motor symptoms (p=0.001). Because TIS has a strong tendency with severity of ischemic motor symptom and the presence of old lesions, the ivy sign may be useful in predicting severity of disease progression.\n\nIvy Sign on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Images in Moyamoya Disease: Correlation with Clinical Severity and Old Brain Lesions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeo, Kwon-Duk; Suh, Sang Hyun; Kim, Yong Bae; Kim, Ji Hwa; Ahn, Sung Jun; Kim, Dong-Seok\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Leptomeningeal collateral, in moyamoya disease (MMD), appears as an ivy sign on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images.

Forty-eight pediatric patients (aged 3 months to 18 years) were scanned with a clinical 1.5-T whole body MR scanner. Cross-sectional contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence was compared to a T1-weighted dark-fluid fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) BLADE sequence for qualitative and quantitative criteria (image artifacts, image quality, lesion detectability) by two experienced radiologists. Imaging protocols were matched for imaging parameters. Reader agreement was assessed using the exact Bowker test. BLADE images showed significantly less pulsation and motion artifacts than the standard T1-weighted spin-echo sequence scan. BLADE images showed statistically significant lower signal-to-noise ratio but higher contrast-to-noise ratios with superior gray-white matter contrast. All lesions were demonstrated on FLAIR BLADE imaging, and one false-positive lesion was visible in spin-echo sequence images. BLADE MR imaging at 1.5 T is applicable for central nervous system imaging of the unsedated pediatric patient, reduces motion and pulsation artifacts, and minimizes the need for sedation or general anesthesia without loss of relevant diagnostic information.\n\nPatient-specific 3D FLAIR for enhanced visualization of brain white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabr, Refaat E; Pednekar, Amol S; Govindarajan, Koushik A; Sun, Xiaojun; Riascos, Roy F; RamÃ­rez, MarÃ­a G; Hasan, Khader M; Lincoln, John A; Nelson, Flavia; Wolinsky, Jerry S; Narayana, Ponnada A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo improve the conspicuity of white matter lesions (WMLs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using patient-specific optimization of single-slab 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixteen MS patients were enrolled in a prospective 3.0T MRI study. FLAIR inversion time and echo time were automatically optimized for each patient during the same scan session based on measurements of the relative proton density and relaxation times of the brain tissues. The optimization criterion was to maximize the contrast between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), while suppressing cerebrospinal fluid. This criterion also helps increase the contrast between WMLs and WM. The performance of the patient-specific 3D FLAIR protocol relative to the fixed-parameter protocol was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Patient-specific optimization achieved a statistically significant 41% increase in the GM-WM contrast ratio (P < 0.05) and 32% increase in the WML-WM contrast ratio (P < 0.01) compared with fixed-parameter FLAIR. The increase in WML-WM contrast ratio correlated strongly with echo time (P < 10 -11 ). Two experienced neuroradiologists indicated substantially higher lesion conspicuity on the patient-specific FLAIR images over conventional FLAIR in 3-4 cases (intrarater correlation coefficient ICCâ=â0.72). In no case was the image quality of patient-specific FLAIR considered inferior to conventional FLAIR by any of the raters (ICCâ=â0.32). Changes in proton density and relaxation times render fixed-parameter FLAIR suboptimal in terms of lesion contrast. Patient-specific optimization of 3D FLAIR increases lesion conspicuity without scan time penalty, and has potential to enhance the detection of subtle and small lesions in MS. 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.

Materials and Methods: This prospective pilot study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. Ten patients with clinically definite MS (eight men, two women; mean age, 41 years) provided informed consent and underwent 3.0-T MR imaging. Images from a T2-weighted FLAIR sequence were combined with images from a T2*-weighted segmented echo-planar imaging sequence performed during contrast material injection, yielding high-isotropic-resolution (0.55 Ã 0.55 Ã 0.55 mm3) FLAIR* images. Qualitative assessment was performed for image quality, lesion conspicuity, and vein conspicuity. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated to compare normal-appearing WM (NAWM) with cerebrospinal fluid, lesions, and veins. To evaluate the differences in CNR among imaging modalities, a bootstrap procedure clustered on subjects was used, together with paired t tests. Results: High-quality FLAIR* images of the brain were produced at 3.0 T, yielding conspicuous lesions and veins. Lesion-to-NAWM and NAWM-to-vein CNR values were significantly higher for FLAIR* images than for T2-weighted FLAIR images (P < .0001). Findings on FLAIR* images included intralesional veins for lesions located throughout the brain and a hypointense rim around some WM lesions. Conclusion: High-isotropic-resolution FLAIR* images obtained at 3.0 T yield high contrast for WM lesions and parenchymal veins, making it well suited to investigate the relationship between WM abnormalities and veins in a clinical setting.

Fast-FLAIR-, T2 fast spin echo (FSE)-, and T1 SE postcontrast images of 74 patients with intracranial neoplasms were analyzed. Four neuroradiologists rated signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the tumor, rendering of cystic parts, demarcation of the tumor vs brain, of the tumor vs edema and of brain vs edema, as well as the presence of motion and of other artifacts. Data analysis was performed for histologically proven astrocytomas, glioblastomas, and meningiomas, for tumors with poor contrast enhancement, and for all patients pooled. Only for tumors with poor contrast enhancement (n = 12) did fast FLAIR provide additional information about the lesion. In these cases, signal intensity, demarcation of the tumor vs brain, and differentiation of the tumor vs edema were best using fast FLAIR. In all cases, rendering of the tumor's inner structure was poor. For all other tumor types, fast FLAIR did not give clinically relevant information, the only exception being a better demarcation of the edema from brain tissue. Artifacts rarely interfered with evaluation of fast-FLAIR images. Thus, fast FLAIR cannot replace T2-weighted series. It provides additional information only in tumors with poor contrast enhancement. It is helpful for defining the exact extent of the edema of any tumor but gives little information about their inner structure.\n\nQuantification of traumatic meningeal injury using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastro, Marcelo A.; Williford, Joshua P.; Cota, Martin R.; MacLaren, Judy M.; Dardzinski, Bernard J.; Latour, Lawrence L.; Pham, Dzung L.; Butman, John A.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTraumatic meningeal injury is a novel imaging marker of traumatic brain injury, which appears as enhancement of the dura on post-contrast T2-weighted FLAIR images, and is likely associated with inflammation of the meninges. Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI provides a better discrimination of abnormally perfused regions. A method to properly identify those regions is presented. Images of seventeen patients scanned within 96 hours of head injury with positive traumatic meningeal injury were normalized and aligned. The difference between the pre- and last post-contrast acquisitions was segmented and voxels in the higher class were spatially clustered. Spatial and morphological descriptors were used to identify the regions of enhancement: a) centroid; b) distance to the brain mask from external voxels; c) distance from internal voxels; d) size; e) shape. The method properly identified thirteen regions among all patients. The method failed in one case due to the presence of a large brain lesion that altered the mask boundaries. Most false detections were correctly rejected resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 92.9% and 93.6%, respectively.\n\nComputer aided detection of tumor and edema in brain FLAIR magnetic resonance image using ANN\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPradhan, Nandita; Sinha, A. K.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThis paper presents an efficient region based segmentation technique for detecting pathological tissues (Tumor & Edema) of brain using fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images. This work segments FLAIR brain images for normal and pathological tissues based on statistical features and wavelet transform coefficients using k-means algorithm. The image is divided into small blocks of 4Ã4 pixels. The k-means algorithm is used to cluster the image based on the feature vectors of blocks forming different classes representing different regions in the whole image. With the knowledge of the feature vectors of different segmented regions, supervised technique is used to train Artificial Neural Network using fuzzy back propagation algorithm (FBPA). Segmentation for detecting healthy tissues and tumors has been reported by several researchers by using conventional MRI sequences like T1, T2 and PD weighted sequences. This work successfully presents segmentation of healthy and pathological tissues (both Tumors and Edema) using FLAIR images. At the end pseudo coloring of segmented and classified regions are done for better human visualization.\n\nImprove Image Quality of Transversal Relaxation Time PROPELLER and FLAIR on Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRauf, N.; Alam, D. Y.; Jamaluddin, M.; Samad, B. A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses the interaction between the magnetic field and the nuclear spins. MRI can be used to show disparity of pathology by transversal relaxation time (T2) weighted images. Some techniques for producing T2-weighted images are Periodically Rotated Overlapping Parallel Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction (PROPELLER) and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). A comparison of T2 PROPELLER and T2 FLAIR parameters in MRI image has been conducted. And improve Image Quality the image by using RadiAnt DICOM Viewer and ENVI software with method of image segmentation and Region of Interest (ROI). Brain images were randomly selected. The result of research showed that Time Repetition (TR) and Time Echo (TE) values in all types of images were not influenced by age. T2 FLAIR images had longer TR value (9000 ms), meanwhile T2 PROPELLER images had longer TE value (100.75 - 102.1 ms). Furthermore, areas with low and medium signal intensity appeared clearer by using T2 PROPELLER images (average coefficients of variation for low and medium signal intensity were 0.0431 and 0.0705, respectively). As for areas with high signal intensity appeared clearer by using T2 FLAIR images (average coefficient of variation was 0.0637).\n\nComparison of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted FLAIR with BLADE, and spin-echo T1-weighted sequences in intracranial MRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlkan, Ozlem; KizilkiliÃ§, Osman; Yildirim, TÃ¼lin; Alibek, Sedat\n\n2009-06-01\n\nWe compared periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER, BLADE) MR technique with spin echo (SE) technique for evaluation of artifacts, and detection and delineation of brain lesions. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with BLADE technique (CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted SE (CE T1W-SE) were performed in 50 patients with intracranial enhancing lesions. These techniques were compared by two neuroradiologists for qualitative analysis of artifacts, lesion detectability, lesion delineation from adjacent structures, and preferred imaging technique; and for quantitative variables, i.e., lesion-to-background and lesion-to-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios. Reader agreement was assessed by kappa statistics. All lesions depicted with the CE T1W-SE were also detected with the CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE technique. Delineation of lesions was better on CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE in the majority of patients. Flow-related artifacts were considerably reduced with CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE. A star-like artifact at the level of the 4(th) ventricle was noted on CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE but not on CE T1W-SE. The lesion-to-background CNR and lesion-to-CSF CNR did not show a statistically significant difference between the two techniques. CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE images were preferred by the observers over the CE T1w-SE images, indicating good interobserver agreement (k = 0.70). CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE technique is superior to CE T1WSE for delineation of lesions and reduction of flow-related artifacts, especially within the posterior fossa, and is preferred by readers. CE T1W-FLAIR BLADE may be an alternative approach to imaging, especially for posterior fossa lesions.\n\nThe usefulness of the ivy sign on fluid-attenuated intensity recovery images in improved brain hemodynamic changes after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis in adult patients with moyamoya disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Jung Keun; Yoon, Byul Hee; Chung, Seung Young; Park, Moon Sun; Kim, Seong Min; Lee, Do Sung\n\n2013-10-01\n\nMR perfusion and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) are well known imaging studies to evaluate hemodynamic change between prior to and following superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis in moyamoya disease. But their side effects and invasiveness make discomfort to patients. We evaluated the ivy sign on MR fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in adult patients with moyamoya disease and compared it with result of SPECT and MR perfusion images. We enrolled twelve patients (thirteen cases) who were diagnosed with moyamoya disease and underwent STA-MCA anastomosis at our medical institution during a period ranging from September of 2010 to December of 2012. The presence of the ivy sign on MR FLAIR images was classified as Negative (0), Minimal (1), and Positive (2). Regions were classified into four territories: the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the anterior MCA, the posterior MCA and the posterior cerebral artery. Ivy signs on preoperative and postoperative MR FLAIR were improved (8 and 4 in the ACA regions, 13 and 4 in the anterior MCA regions and 19 and 9 in the posterior MCA regions). Like this result, the cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) on SPECT was significantly increased in the sum of CVR in same regions after STA-MCA anastomosis. After STA-MCA anastomosis, ivy signs were decreased in the cerebral hemisphere. As compared with conventional diagnostic modalities such as SPECT and MR perfusion images, the ivy sign on MR FLAIR is considered as a useful indicator in detecting brain hemodynamic changes between preoperatively and postoperatively in adult moyamoya patients.\n\nHyperintense Vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR in Patients with Acute MCA Stroke: Prediction of Arterial Stenosis and Perfusion Abnormality.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, S J; Suh, S H; Lee, K-Y; Kim, J H; Seo, K-D; Lee, S\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense vessels in stroke represent leptomeningeal collateral flow. We presumed that FLAIR hyperintense vessels would be more closely associated with arterial stenosis and perfusion abnormality in ischemic stroke on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR than on T2-FLAIR. We retrospectively reviewed 35 patients with middle cerebral territorial infarction who underwent MR imaging. FLAIR hyperintense vessel scores were graded according to the number of segments with FLAIR hyperintense vessels in the MCA ASPECTS areas. We compared the predictability of FLAIR hyperintense vessels between T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR and T2-FLAIR for large-artery stenosis. The interagreement between perfusion abnormality and FLAIR hyperintense vessels was assessed. In subgroup analysis (9 patients with MCA horizontal segment occlusion), the association of FLAIR hyperintense vessels with ischemic lesion volume and perfusion abnormality volume was evaluated. FLAIR hyperintense vessel scores were significantly higher on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR than on T2-FLAIR (3.50 Â± 2.79 versus 1.21 Â± 1.47, P < .01), and the sensitivity for large-artery stenosis was significantly improved on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR (93% versus 68%, P = .03). FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR were more closely associated with perfusion abnormalities than they were on T2-FLAIR (Îº = 0.64 and Îº = 0.27, respectively). In subgroup analysis, FLAIR hyperintense vessels were positively correlated with ischemic lesion volume on T2-FLAIR, while the mismatch of FLAIR hyperintense vessels between the 2 sequences was negatively correlated with ischemic lesion volume (P = .01). In MCA stroke, FLAIR hyperintense vessels were more prominent on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR compared with T2-FLAIR. In addition, FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR have a significantly higher sensitivity for predicting large-artery stenosis than they do on T2-FLAIR. Moreover, the areas showing FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR\n\nThe Usefulness of the Ivy Sign on Fluid-Attenuated Intensity Recovery Images in Improved Brain Hemodynamic Changes after Superficial Temporal Artery-Middle Cerebral Artery Anastomosis in Adult Patients with Moyamoya Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Jung Keun; Yoon, Byul Hee; Park, Moon Sun; Kim, Seong Min; Lee, Do Sung\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective MR perfusion and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) are well known imaging studies to evaluate hemodynamic change between prior to and following superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis in moyamoya disease.

However, their actual role in the conversion to dementia is still not fully understood. Automatic segmentation methods can help in the screening and monitoring of Mild Cognitive Impairment patients who take part in large population-based studies. Most existing segmentation approaches use multimodal MR images. However, multiple acquisitions represent a limitation in terms of both patient comfort and computational complexity of the algorithms. In this work, we propose an automatic lesion segmentation method that uses only three-dimensional fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. We use a modified context-sensitive Gaussian mixture model to determine voxel class probabilities, followed by correction of FLAIR artifacts. We evaluate the method against the manual segmentation performed by an experienced neuroradiologist and compare the results with other unimodal segmentation approaches. Finally, we apply our method to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions by using a publicly available benchmark dataset. Results show a similar performance to other state-of-the-art multimodal methods, as well as to the human rater. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The method is based on superpixel technique and classification of each superpixel. A number of novel image features including intensity-based, Gabor textons, fractal analysis and curvatures are calculated from each superpixel within the entire brain area in FLAIR MRI to ensure a robust classification. Extremely randomized trees (ERT) classifier is compared with support vector machine (SVM) to classify each superpixel into tumour and non-tumour. The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets: (1) Our own clinical dataset: 19 MRI FLAIR images of patients with gliomas of grade II to IV, and (2) BRATS 2012 dataset: 30 FLAIR images with 10 low-grade and 20 high-grade gliomas. The experimental results demonstrate the high detection and segmentation performance of the proposed method using ERT classifier. For our own cohort, the average detection sensitivity, balanced error rate and the Dice overlap measure for the segmented tumour against the ground truth are 89.48Â %, 6Â % and 0.91, respectively, while, for the BRATS dataset, the corresponding evaluation results are 88.09Â %, 6Â % and 0.88, respectively. This provides a close match to expert delineation across all grades of glioma, leading to a faster and more reproducible method of brain tumour detection and delineation to aid patient management.\n\nAutomated segmentation of MS lesions in FLAIR, DIR and T2-w MR images via an information theoretic approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHill, Jason E.; Matlock, Kevin; Pal, Ranadip; Nutter, Brian; Mitra, Sunanda\n\n2016-03-01\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital tool in the diagnosis and characterization of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS lesions can be imaged with relatively high contrast using either Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) or Double Inversion Recovery (DIR). Automated segmentation and accurate tracking of MS lesions from MRI remains a challenging problem. Here, an information theoretic approach to cluster the voxels in pseudo-colorized multispectral MR data (FLAIR, DIR, T2-weighted) is utilized to automatically segment MS lesions of various sizes and noise levels. The Improved Jump Method (IJM) clustering, assisted by edge suppression, is applied to the segmentation of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MS lesions, if present, into a subset of slices determined to be the best MS lesion candidates via Otsu's method. From this preliminary clustering, the modal data values for the tissues can be determined. A Euclidean distance is then used to estimate the fuzzy memberships of each brain voxel for all tissue types and their 50/50 partial volumes. From these estimates, binary discrete and fuzzy MS lesion masks are constructed. Validation is provided by using three synthetic MS lesions brains (mild, moderate and severe) with labeled ground truths. The MS lesions of mild, moderate and severe designations were detected with a sensitivity of 83.2%, and 88.5%, and 94.5%, and with the corresponding Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.7098, 0.8739, and 0.8266, respectively. The effect of MRI noise is also examined by simulated noise and the application of a bilateral filter in preprocessing.\n\nSupervised classification of brain tissues through local multi-scale texture analysis by coupling DIR and FLAIR MR sequences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoletti, Enea; Veronese, Elisa; Calabrese, Massimiliano; Bertoldo, Alessandra; Grisan, Enrico\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe automatic segmentation of brain tissues in magnetic resonance (MR) is usually performed on T1-weighted images, due to their high spatial resolution. T1w sequence, however, has some major downsides when brain lesions are present: the altered appearance of diseased tissues causes errors in tissues classification. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we employed two different MR sequences: fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and double inversion recovery (DIR). The former highlights both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), the latter highlights GM alone. We propose here a supervised classification scheme that does not require any anatomical a priori information to identify the 3 classes, \"GM\", \"WM\", and \"background\". Features are extracted by means of a local multi-scale texture analysis, computed for each pixel of the DIR and FLAIR sequences. The 9 textures considered are average, standard deviation, kurtosis, entropy, contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, and skewness, evaluated on a neighborhood of 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 pixels. Hence, the total number of features associated to a pixel is 56 (9 textures x3 scales x2 sequences +2 original pixel values). The classifier employed is a Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function as kernel. From each of the 4 brain volumes evaluated, a DIR and a FLAIR slice have been selected and manually segmented by 2 expert neurologists, providing 1st and 2nd human reference observations which agree with an average accuracy of 99.03%. SVM performances have been assessed with a 4-fold cross-validation, yielding an average classification accuracy of 98.79%.\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury: Hope Through Research\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... last decade to image milder TBI damage.

However, CSF flow artifacts caused by conventional FLAIR can produce false-positive results. Here, we compare 3D and 3D FLAIR sequences, focusing on their potential for containing these artifacts and their sensitivity and specificity for detection of SAHs. We evaluated the following 4 FLAIR sequences: 1) 2D FLAIR at 1.5T, 2) 2D FLAIR, 3) 2D PROPELLER-FLAIR, and 4) 3D Cube-FLAIR at 3T. All sequences were performed in 5 healthy volunteers; sequences 2 and 4 were also performed under routine conditions in 10 patients with focal epilepsy and in 10 patients with SAH. Two neuroradiologists independently conducted the analysis. The presence of flow artifacts in the ventricles and cisterns of healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy was evaluated and scored on a 4-point scale. Mean values were calculated and compared by using paired t tests. Sensitivity and specificity for SAH detection in sequences 2 and 4 were determined. Cube-FLAIR showed almost no CSF artifacts in the volunteers and the patients with epilepsy; therefore, it was superior to any other FLAIR (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of SAH detection by 3T FLAIR were 58.3% and 89.4%, respectively, whereas Cube-FLAIR had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. Cube-FLAIR allows FLAIR imaging with almost no CSF artifacts and is, thus, particularly useful for SAH detection.\n\nThin isotropic FLAIR MR images at 1.5T increase the yield of focal cortical dysplasia transmantle sign detection in frontal lobe epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKokkinos, Vasileios; Kallifatidis, Alexandros; Kapsalaki, Eftychia Z; Papanikolaou, Nikolaos; Garganis, Kyriakos\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe transmantle sign is a distinctive imaging marker of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), which is revealed predominantly by fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Although the transmantle sign detection yield is high by routine imaging protocols for epilepsy at 3T, most centers around the world have access to 1.5T MR technology and FLE patients often receive negative imaging reports. This study investigates the optimization of transmantle detection yield at 1.5T by introducing a 3D thin-slice isotropic FLAIR sequence in the epilepsy imaging protocol. Twenty FLE patients underwent diagnostic imaging for epilepsy with typical 2D thick-slice (3.0mm) coronal FLAIR sequences and a 3D thin-slice (1.0mm) isotropic FLAIR sequences at 1.5T, and transmantle sign detection yields and thickness measurements were derived. The 2D thick-slice FLAIR detected a transmantle sign in seven (35.0%) patients. The 3D isotropic thin-slice FLAIR detected a transmantle sign in eleven (55.0%) patients, thereby increasing the transmantle sign detection yield by 57.4%. The mean transmantle sign thickness by thick images was 12.3mm, by thin images was 8.9mm, and in the patients undetected by thick FLAIR was 3.5mm. This study showed that the extratemporal transmantle sign in FLE patients can be thin enough to be missed by thick-slice FLAIR sequences at 1.5T. By introducing 3D thin-slice isotropic FLAIR, false-negative reports can be reduced without reference for higher MR field structural scanning or other modalities, and more FLE patients can benefit from epilepsy surgery candidacy.

We investigated differences in white matter diffusivity as an indicator for white matter integrity underlying WMSA based on T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging contrast. In addition, we investigated which white matter region of interest (ROI) could predict clinical diagnosis best using diffusion metrics. One hundred three older individuals with varying cognitive impairment levels were included and underwent neuroimaging. Diffusion metrics were extracted from WMSA areas based on T1 and FLAIR contrast and from their overlapping areas, the border surrounding the WMSA and the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Regional diffusivity differences were calculated with linear mixed effects models. Multinomial logistic regression determined which ROI diffusion values classified individuals best into clinically defined diagnostic groups. T1-based WMSA showed lower white matter integrity compared to FLAIR WMSA-defined regions. Diffusion values of NAWM predicted diagnostic group best compared to other ROI's. To conclude, T1- or FLAIR-defined WMSA provides distinct information on the underlying white matter integrity associated with cognitive decline. Importantly, not the \"diseased\" but the NAWM is a potentially sensitive indicator for cognitive brain health status. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of implementing an array spatial sensitivity technique (ASSET)-echo-planar imaging (EPI)-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (AE-FLAIR) sequence into an acute cerebral infarction magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation protocol, and to assess the diagnostic value of AE-FLAIR combined with three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D TOF MRA). Material and Methods A total of 100 patients (68 men, 32 women; age range, 44-82 years) with acute cerebral infarction, including 50 consecutive uncooperative and 50 cooperative patients, were evaluated with T1-weighted (T1W) imaging, T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), 3D TOF, EPI-FLAIR, and AE-FLAIR. Conventional FLAIR, EPI-FLAIR, and AE-FLAIR were assessed by two observers independently for image quality. The optimized group (AE-FLAIR and 3D TOF) and the control group (T1W imaging, T2W imaging, conventional FLAIR, DWI, and 3D TOF) were compared for evaluation time and diagnostic accuracy. Results One hundred and twenty-five lesions were detected and images having adequate diagnostic image quality were in 73% of conventional FLAIR, 62% of EPI-FLAIR, and 89% of AE-FLAIR. The detection time was 12âÂ±â1âmin with 76% accuracy and 4âÂ±â0.5âmin with 100% accuracy in the control and the optimized groups, respectively. Inter-observer agreements of Îºâ=â0.78 and Îºâ=â0.81 were for the optimized group and control group, respectively. Conclusion With reduced acquisition time and better image quality, AE-FLAIR combined with 3D TOF may be used as a rapid diagnosis tool in patients with acute cerebral infarction, especially in uncooperative patients.\n\nEdge Contrast of the FLAIR Hyperintense Region Predicts Survival in Patients with High-Grade Gliomas following Treatment with Bevacizumab.\n\nPubMed\n\nBahrami, N; Piccioni, D; Karunamuni, R; Chang, Y-H; White, N; Delfanti, R; Seibert, T M; Hattangadi-Gluth, J A; Dale, A; Farid, N; McDonald, C R\n\n2018-04-05\n\nTreatment with bevacizumab is standard of care for recurrent high-grade gliomas; however, monitoring response to treatment following bevacizumab remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether quantifying the sharpness of the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense border using a measure derived from texture analysis-edge contrast-improves the evaluation of response to bevacizumab in patients with high-grade gliomas. MRIs were evaluated in 33 patients with high-grade gliomas before and after the initiation of bevacizumab. Volumes of interest within the FLAIR hyperintense region were segmented. Edge contrast magnitude for each VOI was extracted using gradients of the 3D FLAIR images. Cox proportional hazards models were generated to determine the relationship between edge contrast and progression-free survival/overall survival using age and the extent of surgical resection as covariates. After bevacizumab, lower edge contrast of the FLAIR hyperintense region was associated with poorer progression-free survival ( P = .009) and overall survival ( P = .022) among patients with high-grade gliomas. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that edge contrast cutoff significantly stratified patients for both progression-free survival (log-rank Ï 2 = 8.3, P = .003) and overall survival (log-rank Ï 2 = 5.5, P = .019). Texture analysis using edge contrast of the FLAIR hyperintense region may be an important predictive indicator in patients with high-grade gliomas following treatment with bevacizumab. Specifically, low FLAIR edge contrast may partially reflect areas of early tumor infiltration. This study adds to a growing body of literature proposing that quantifying features may be important for determining outcomes in patients with high-grade gliomas.

The images were evaluated independently by two radiologists for cortical gyral, sulcal space, basal cisterns and dural enhancement. The diagnoses were confirmed by further investigations including histopathology. Post-contrast 3D-T 1 -SPACE and 3D-T 2 -FLAIR images yielded significantly more information than MPRAGE images (pâ<â0.05 for both SPACE and FLAIR images) in detection of meningeal abnormalities. SPACE images best demonstrated abnormalities in dural and sulcal spaces, whereas FLAIR was useful for basal cisterns enhancement. Both SPACE and FLAIR performed equally well in detection of gyral enhancement. In all 10 patients, where both SPACE and T 2 -FLAIR images failed to demonstrate any abnormality, further analysis was also negative. The 3D-T 1 -SPACE sequence best demonstrated abnormalities in dural and sulcal spaces, whereas FLAIR was useful for abnormalities in basal cisterns. Both SPACE and FLAIR performed holds good for detection of gyral enhancement. Post-contrast SPACE and FLAIR sequences are superior to the MPRAGE sequence for evaluation of meningeal abnormalities and when used in combination have the maximum sensitivity for leptomeningeal abnormalities. The negative-predictive value is nearly 100%, where no leptomeningeal abnormality was detected on these sequences. Advances in knowledge: Post-contrast 3D-T 1 -SPACE and 3D-T 2 -FLAIR images are more useful than 3D-T 1 -MPRAGE images in evaluation of meningeal abnormalities.\n\nClinical-Radiological Parameters Improve the Prediction of the Thrombolysis Time Window by Both MRI Signal Intensities and DWI-FLAIR Mismatch.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadai, Vince Istvan; Wood, Carla N; Galinovic, Ivana; Grittner, Ulrike; Piper, Sophie K; Revankar, Gajanan S; Martin, Steve Z; Zaro-Weber, Olivier; Moeller-Hartmann, Walter; von Samson-Himmelstjerna, Federico C; Heiss, Wolf-Dieter; Ebinger, Martin; Fiebach, Jochen B; Sobesky, Jan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWith regard to acute stroke, patients with unknown time from stroke onset are not eligible for thrombolysis. Quantitative diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI relative signal intensity (rSI) biomarkers have been introduced to predict eligibility for thrombolysis, but have shown heterogeneous results in the past. In the present work, we investigated whether the inclusion of easily obtainable clinical-radiological parameters would improve the prediction of the thrombolysis time window by rSIs and compared their performance to the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch. In a retrospective study, patients from 2 centers with proven stroke with onset <12 h were included. The DWI lesion was segmented and overlaid on ADC and FLAIR images. rSI mean and SD, were calculated as follows: (mean ROI value/mean value of the unaffected hemisphere). Additionally, the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch was evaluated. Prediction of the thrombolysis time window was evaluated by the area-under-the-curve (AUC) derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Factors such as the association of age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, MRI field strength, lesion size, vessel occlusion and Wahlund-Score with rSI were investigated and the models were adjusted and stratified accordingly. In 82 patients, the unadjusted rSI measures DWI-mean and -SD showed the highest AUCs (AUC 0.86-0.87). Adjustment for clinical-radiological covariates significantly improved the performance of FLAIR-mean (0.91) and DWI-SD (0.91). The best prediction results based on the AUC were found for the final stratified and adjusted models of DWI-SD (0.94) and FLAIR-mean (0.96) and a multivariable DWI-FLAIR model (0.95). The adjusted visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch did not perform in a significantly worse manner (0.89). ADC-rSIs showed fair performance in all models. Quantitative DWI and FLAIR MRI biomarkers as well as the visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch provide excellent\n\nFLAIR vascular hyperintensities predict early ischemic recurrence in TIA.\n\nPubMed\n\nNam, Ki-Woong; Kim, Chi Kyung; Kim, Tae Jung; Oh, Kyungmi; Han, Moon-Ku; Ko, Sang-Bae; Yoon, Byung-Woo\n\n2018-02-27\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensity (FVH) and early ischemic lesion recurrence (follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging [FU-DWI] [+]) in patients with lesion-negative TIA. We recruited consecutive patients with lesion-negative TIA within 24 hours of symptom onset, who underwent follow-up MRI during the acute period. FVH was defined as a focal or serpentine high signal intensity on FLAIR images. Other potential confounders were adjusted to evaluate the relationship between FVH and FU-DWI (+). Furthermore, to compare clinical outcomes between the FU-DWI (+) and FU-DWI (-) groups, we assessed 1-year recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA. Among 392 patients with lesion-negative TIA, 82 patients had FU-DWI (+) on the follow-up MRI. In the multivariate analysis, FVH remained an independent predictor of FU-DWI (+) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-9.29, p < 0.001). The time to initial MRI (aOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.33-0.70, p < 0.001) and intracranial atherosclerosis (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.10-3.92, p = 0.025) were also associated with FU-DWI (+), independent of FVH. In clinical outcomes, the FU-DWI (+) group showed more frequent 1-year recurrent ischemic stroke events than the FU-DWI (-) group (10.7% vs 3.1%, respectively, p = 0.007). FVH is associated with FU-DWI (+) in patients with lesion-negative TIA. As FU-DWI (+) frequently occurs during the acute period and has a subsequent worse outcome after discharge, additional radiologic or clinical markers for it are necessary.

Both subjects' brain magnetic resonance imaging showed T2/FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) hyperintensities including linear areas of hyperintensity in the external and internal capsules with sparing of the lentiform nuclei. Single case reports of imaging findings in EEE exist with nonspecific patterns of abnormality. We propose that this \"( ) parentheses sign\" on T2 or FLAIR imaging may distinguish EEE from other processes. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The path-averaged attenuation values (tâ) of a high quality subset of 84 local earthquakes were calculated by a spectral inversion technique. These 1929 tâ-values inverted by a least-squares tomographic inversion yield the 3D distribution of the specific attenuation (Qp). Analysis of the model resolution matrix and synthetic recovery tests were used to investigate the confidence of the Qp-model. We notice a prominent zone of increased attenuation beneath and north of the modern volcanic arc at depths down to 15 km. Most of this anomaly seems to be related to the Eocene-Miocene Kendeng Basin (mainly in the eastern part of the study area). Enhanced attenuation is also found in the upper crust in the direct vicinity of recent volcanoes pointing towards zones of partial melts, presence of fluids and increased temperatures in the middle to upper crust. The middle and lower crust seems not to be associated with strong heating and the presence of melts throughout the arc. Enhanced attenuation above the subducting slab beneath the marine forearc seems to be due to the presence of fluids.\n\nMagnetic resonance separation imaging using a divided inversion recovery technique (DIRT).\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldfarb, James W\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe divided inversion recovery technique is an MRI separation method based on tissue T(1) relaxation differences. When tissue T(1) relaxation times are longer than the time between inversion pulses in a segmented inversion recovery pulse sequence, longitudinal magnetization does not pass through the null point. Prior to additional inversion pulses, longitudinal magnetization may have an opposite polarity. Spatial displacement of tissues in inversion recovery balanced steady-state free-precession imaging has been shown to be due to this magnetization phase change resulting from incomplete magnetization recovery. In this paper, it is shown how this phase change can be used to provide image separation. A pulse sequence parameter, the time between inversion pulses (T180), can be adjusted to provide water-fat or fluid separation. Example water-fat and fluid separation images of the head, heart, and abdomen are presented. The water-fat separation performance was investigated by comparing image intensities in short-axis divided inversion recovery technique images of the heart. Fat, blood, and fluid signal was suppressed to the background noise level. Additionally, the separation performance was not affected by main magnetic field inhomogeneities.\n\nEffect of cerebral spinal fluid suppression for diffusional kurtosis imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Alicia W; Jensen, Jens H; Hu, Caixia C; Tabesh, Ali; Falangola, Maria F; Helpern, Joseph A\n\n2013-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) partial volume effect on diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics in white matter and cortical gray matter. Four healthy volunteers participated in this study. Standard DKI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) DKI experiments were performed using a twice-refocused-spin-echo diffusion sequence. The conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, D[symbol in text], D[symbol in text] together with DKI metrics of mean, axial, and radial kurtosis (MK, K[symbol in text], K[symbol in text], were measured and compared. Single image slices located above the lateral ventricles, with similar anatomical features for each subject, were selected to minimize the effect of CSF from the ventricles. In white matter, differences of less than 10% were observed between diffusion metrics measured with standard DKI and FLAIR-DKI sequences, suggesting minimal CSF contamination. For gray matter, conventional DTI metrics differed by 19% to 52%, reflecting significant CSF partial volume effects. Kurtosis metrics, however, changed by 11% or less, indicating greater robustness with respect to CSF contamination. Kurtosis metrics are less sensitive to CSF partial voluming in cortical gray matter than conventional diffusion metrics. The kurtosis metrics may then be more specific indicators of changes in tissue microstructure, provided the effect sizes for the changes are comparable.

We assessed whether extravasation of gadolinium chelate could be visualized on delayed postcontrast FLAIR images in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Seventy-four individuals participated in this study (15 with Alzheimer disease, 33 with mild cognitive impairment, and 26 with normal cognition). We assessed the appearance of pericortical enhancement after contrast administration, MR imaging markers of cerebrovascular damage, and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Three participants who were positive for pericortical enhancement (1 with normal cognition and 2 with mild cognitive impairment) were followed up for approximately 2 years. In vitro experiments with a range of gadolinium concentrations served to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the postcontrast FLAIR signals. Postcontrast pericortical enhancement was observed in 21 participants (28%), including 6 individuals with Alzheimer disease (40%), 10 with mild cognitive impairment (30%), and 5 with normal cognition (19%). Pericortical enhancement was positively associated with age ( P < .02) and ischemic stroke ( P < .05), but not with cognitive status ( P = .3). Foci with enhanced signal remained stable across time in all follow-up cases. The in vitro measurements confirmed that FLAIR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of low gadolinium concentrations in CSF, but not in cerebral tissue. Postcontrast pericortical enhancement on FLAIR images occurs in older individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. It may represent chronic focal superficial BBB leakage. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine its clinical significance.

From September 2008 through May 2013, patients with aneurysmal SAH were included if a NECT less than 24â h after the onset of symptoms showed a SAH, and MRI, including T2* and FLAIR sequences, was performed 3â months later. All aneurysms were treated endovascularly. NECT and MR sequences were blindly analyzed for the presence of SAH (NECT) or hemosiderin deposition (MRI). When positive, details of the spatial distribution of SAH or hemosiderin deposits were noted. Sensitivities were calculated for each patient. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for each location. Forty-nine patients (mean age 52.9â years) were included. Bleeding-related patterns were identified in 43 patients (87.8%) on T2* and 10 patients (20.4%) on FLAIR. T2* was highly predictive of the location of the initial hemorrhage, especially in the Sylvian cisterns (PPVs 95% and 100%) and the anterior interhemispheric fissure (PPV 90%). The T2* sequence can detect and localize a previous SAH a few months after aneurysmal bleeding. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The Minimum Area Contour Change (MACC) algorithm has been created with two main goals: a) to improve inter-operator agreement on outlining regions of interest (ROIs) and b) to automatically propagate longitudinal ROIs from the baseline scan to a follow-up scan. Methods The MACC algorithm first identifies an outer bound for the solution path, forms a high number of iso-contour curves based on equally spaced contour values, and then selects the best contour value to outline the lesion. The MACC software was tested on a set of 17 FLAIR MRI images evaluated by a pair of human experts and a longitudinal dataset of 12 pairs of T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images that had lesion analysis ROIs drawn by a single expert operator. Results In the tests where two human experts evaluated the same MRI images, the MACC program demonstrated that it could markedly reduce inter-operator outline error. In the longitudinal part of the study, the MACC program created ROIs on follow-up scans that were in close agreement to the original expertâs ROIs. Finally, in a post-hoc analysis of 424 follow-up scans 91% of propagated MACC were accepted by an expert and only 9% of the final accepted ROIS had to be created or edited by the expert. Conclusion When used with an expert operator's verification of automatically created ROIs, MACC can be used to improve inter- operator agreement and decrease analysis time, which should improve data collected and analyzed in multicenter clinical trials.

To assess the value of magnetic resonance textural analysis (MRTA) on T 2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images for making a genetically integrated diagnosis of true oligodendroglioma by WHO guidelines. Retrospective case control. In all, there were 54 patients with a histopathological diagnosis of diffuse glioma (grade II). All were tested for IDH and 1p/19q. 3.0T, including T 2 FLAIR sequence, axial T 1 -weighted, and T 2 -weighted sequence. MRTA on a representative tumor region of interest (ROI) was made on preoperative T 2 FLAIR images around the area that had the largest diameter of solid tumor using Omni Kinetics software. Differences between IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted and IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-intact gliomas were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were created to assess MRTA diagnostic performance. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated with a cutoff value according to the Youden Index. Comparisons demonstrated significant differences in kurtosis (Pâ=â0.007), energy (0.008), entropy (0.008), mean deviation (MD) (<0.001), and high gray-level run emphasis (HGLRE) (0.002), cluster shade (0.025), and sum average (0.002). First-order features comprising entropy (area under the curve [AUC]â=â0.718, sensitivityâ=â97.1%) and energy (0.719, 94.1%) had the highest sensitivity but lower specificity (both 45%). Second-order features such as HGLRE (AUCâ=â0.750, sensitivityâ=â73.5%, specificityâ=â80.0%) and sum average (0.751, 70.6%, 80.0%) had relatively higher specificity, and all had AUC >0.7.

Texture analysis extracts information on the relationship between signal intensities of neighboring voxels. A potential advantage over techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, is that it can be used on clinically obtained magnetic resonance sequences. We determined whether texture parameters (TP) were abnormal in SVD, correlated with cognitive impairment, predicted cognitive decline, or conversion to dementia. In the prospective SCANS study (St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke), we assessed TP in 121 individuals with symptomatic SVD at baseline, 99 of whom attended annual cognitive testing for 5 years. Conversion to dementia was recorded for all subjects during the 5-year period. Texture analysis was performed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T1-weighted images. The TP obtained from the SVD cohort were cross-sectionally compared with 54 age-matched controls scanned on the same magnetic resonance imaging system. There were highly significant differences in several TP between SVD cases and controls. Within the SVD population, TP were highly correlated to other magnetic resonance imaging parameters (brain volume, white matter lesion volume, lacune count). TP correlated with executive function and global function at baseline and predicted conversion to dementia, after controlling for age, sex, premorbid intelligence quotient, and magnetic resonance parameters. TP, which can be obtained from routine clinical images, are abnormal in SVD, and the degree of abnormality correlates with executive dysfunction and global cognition at baseline and decline during 5 years. TP may be useful to assess disease severity in clinically collected data.

K.; Pham, Ly; Wu, Ona; Yoo, Albert J.; Furie, Karen L.; Singhal, Aneesh B.; Elm, Jordan J.; Stern, Barney J.; Sheth, Kevin N.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground and Purpose Brain edema is a serious complication of ischemic stroke that can lead to secondary neurological deterioration and death. Glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4). However, the relevance of this pathway to the development of cerebral edema in stroke patients is not known. Methods Using a case control design, we retrospectively assessed neuroimaging and blood markers of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema in subjects who were enrolled in the Glyburide Advantage in Malignant Edema and Stroke-Pilot (GAMES-Pilot) trial. We compared serial brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) to a cohort with similar large volume infarctions. We also compared matrix metalloproteinase-9 plasma level in large hemispheric stroke. Results We report that IV glyburide was associated with attenuated T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level. Conclusions Several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of IV glyburide treatment in human stroke. Verification of these potential imaging and blood biomarkers is warranted in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods We estimated the hemispheric variation uncertainty (HVU) of hippocampal T1 volumetry and FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) intensity. Using diffusion tensor images of 23 nonepileptic subjects, we estimated the HVU levels of mean diffusivity (MD) in the hippocampus, and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the posteroinferior cingulum and crus of fornix. Imaging from a retrospective cohort of 20 TLE patients who had undergone surgical resection with Engel class I outcomes was analyzed to determine whether asymmetry of preoperative volumetrics, FLAIR intensities, and MD values in hippocampi, as well "
