        "meta_description": "Downloadable (with restrictions)!  The aim of the study was to find out whether there is a relationship between school grades and high school student motivation. Participants of this study where 11 and 12 grade students (N = 152) in three high schools: Sami Frasheri, Xhevdet Doda and Dr. Ali Sokoli in Kosovo. The data was collected by questionnaire that was created for the purpose of this study and that was based on motivation theories. The data was analysed by factor analysis. Also in this study for further analysis we used inferential statistics such as correlation, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Four factors were extracted by analysing the questionnaire, using the common factors method: intrinsic motivation, parents as an incentive, rating as an incentive and teacher as an incentive for teaching engagement. The correlation results show that school success is significantly associated with all of the factors and therefore we can conclude that there is statistically significant association between school grades and motivation. Also, the results from multiple regression show that as an incentive and teacher as an incentive for teaching engagement have a statistically significant effect on school grades.",
