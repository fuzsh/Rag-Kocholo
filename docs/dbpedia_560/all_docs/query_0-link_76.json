        "text": "(Click lower right hand corner to enlarge image!)\n\nTranslation: 1936 Kennywood Memories—\n\nToday is the Serbian picnic.\n\n(At the top: She was sorry that Uncle Chappy -George- was in the army and couldn’t be with them. She wrote that EVERY day!)\n\n“I got up early. Joe (son) went to work, but Nikola (husband) and Batalo (border) have vacation. And we, God willing (Ako Bog da), are getting ready to go to the picnic.\n\nEveryone came, our Joe at 9:00 to our house as he’s going to the picnic (later after work.)\n\nAt 10:00, Marta (Daughter), Beba Latinka (youngest -Baby-Daughter Laura) and Sophie Buncic went early. Marty took them in her car early because they’re on the committee.\n\nAt 1:00, Nikola, Milica (Daughter) and I will go on the bus with our whole Lodge (#11-Vojvoda Stepa Stepanovich!).\n\nJoe isn’t going to work in the afternoon so he’ll be coming later.\n\n“At the picnic there was everything you could think of, everything! They brought in the flags and sang the American and Yugoslav national anthems, and there were priests from all over, and a Gypsy orchestra.\n\nThere was no way it could be an any better Serbian Day than this one because I saw so many of my friends from all over (Svih strani!) so I was so pleased and happy.\n\n“Marty worked the whole day and night until 11:00 at night. She’s really exhausted, but when she wants to work like that, let her.\n\n“However, my heart is broken, but I can’t tell anyone how I feel that my two children (George in the Army, Rose in Belgrade) aren’t here with us. I saw so many mothers with their children, and mine are so far away from me.\n\n“My Josip (Joe) came about 4:30 in the afternoon. I thought when I saw him that the Heavens opened up and an Angel came because he looked so handsome!(Later on in the late evening)\n\n“We got ready to go on the bus as happy as could be. It couldn’t have been a nicer Serbian Day, everyone was so happy! “Dobro Dosli! (They arrived home safely!)\n\n++++++++++++++++\n\nBaba Andja Mamula’s report of Serbian Day at Kennywood on Aug. 1, 1941\n\nI got up early and Pi (her son-in-law, Paul Belosh) went to work and I was working around the house. Milica (Daughter)got up early too and went to see Latinka (youngest daughter who had baby Milana only 2 days ago!), but they were all sleeping. My Chappy (George) is still sleeping too. He was very tired and he’s so dark from the sun that he looks like he’s a Cernie. I’m waiting for Milica so that she can tell me how my babies are, one and the other. (Latinka was the baby in the family).\n\nToday is Serbian day. I don’t know if I will be able to go. Something always comes up that I can’t do what I want.\n\nMarty (oldest daughte married to Paul Belosh) and Pi (P.B.) and I got ready to go to the picnic. It was so nice. Milica, me, and Marty, but Marty was always with other people surrounding her. She was like a peacock amongst the birds. (“Kao paun medju pticima!”). She couldn’t be more beautiful, and she was dressed so expensively magnificent. I saw many of my friends and we all talked so beautifully. I rode some and I walked around a lot. My dear Vladimir. (Thinking aloud about her grandson in Europe.) We came home at 12 o’clock midnight. Milica went to see the baby and I went to bed.”\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSpeech Given by Mim Bizic\n\nat Kennywood, July 16, 2016, right before we all lined up to make the 1,000 person KOLO line around the Lagoon!\n\nKennywood 100 speech on History of Serbian Day 7/16/16By Mim Bizic\n\nHappy 100th birthday! Happy SLAVA to all of you here today who chose to help celebrate this historic moment, one beautiful birthday party commemorating our pioneers’ efforts to create a SERBDOM that has guided and sustained us all these years!\n\nBask! Bask in the glory of knowing that you are here today—descendants of those early pioneers. We are the FIRST such ethnic group at Kennywood Park to reach this great milestone!\n\nHappy 100th! The first event was recorded for history in the early evening edition of the Pittsburgh Press of Thursday, August 2nd, 1917, carrying the report of Chairman Stevo Babic.\n\nHelping him on that original committee, also from McKeesport, were Nikola Mrvos and a fellow whose last name was Pavlovich. Steubenville was represented by Milan Kukich and also on the first committee were Sam Verlinich of McKees Rocks, and Božo Mamula of Pittsburgh’s South Side. (I left this out for time’s sake.)\n\nThat 1917 Pittsburgh Press newspaper account read: “There are many Serbians located in Pittsburgh and surrounding towns, but FEW, IF ANY, were absent from the park today!” How smart they were to make sure all of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas knew of this great accomplishment of the Serbian War Orphans Relief Committee!\n\nHow did the first Serbian Day at Kennywood start?\n\nWar was raging in Europe, and thousands of Serbian children were left orphans, as the Serbs lost almost ½ of their male population and between ¼ to 1/3 of their total population from which they have never recovered. While +St. Bishop Nikolai was asking for help speaking to thousands at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, great physicist scientist Michael Pupin of Columbia University in New York was heading up the Relief Efforts throughout America and Canada. Pupin called upon his good friend, Stevo Babic of the Greater Pittsburgh area, to help.\n\nStevo’s good friend, Mr. Joseph McSwiggen, was the owner of Kennywood Park.\n\nBabic asked McSwiggen to donate the use of the park for the day, and he agreed to let the Serbs garner a percentage from the sale of tickets for the amusement rides, thus leading to what we now know as Kennywood’s famous “Nationality Days” for all ethnic groups.\n\nThroughout the years that followed, so many great projects occurred because of you, your parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.\n\nBesides the proceeds helping the war orphans of Serbia, we were also able to help fund:\n\n1.The Serbian/Yugoslav room here in Pittsburgh at Pitt’s Cathedral of Learning.\n\n2.The late Lt. Col. Mitchell Paige, awardee of the Congressional Medal of Honor, helped raise one of the biggest amounts of money for American War Bonds during WWII.\n\n3.More recent donations from Serbian Day at Kennywood were used to help fund Vracar Cathedral in Belgrade and\n\n4. Scholarships here in the USA.\n\nCollectively over the years, we have witnessed Beauty contests, athletic events, choirs, folklore groups and tambura bands from all over the USA here at Kennywood, all the while having fun and such a good time. And now, TODAY, we all are part of history! Thank you EVERYONE for being here! Ziveli, SRBI!\n\nUNITED WE SING:\n\nSt. Elijah Choir of Aliquippa, PA, helps Northern Neighbors celebrate the 59th Anniversary of St. Sava’s Choir in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\n\nBy Milana (Mim) Karlo Bizic,\n\nOctober 24, 2014\n\nCanada has always been special to me. Ask any kid who has ever been to Shadeland Camp, and he or she will probably say the same, since every morning we sang the “Star Spangled Banner,” then “O Canada,” ending our morning flag ceremonies with “Boze Pravde.”\n\nIt was exciting as a 12 year old to have an international pen pal, age 13, from Canada, and what a friend to have: the brilliant Olga B. Markovich, of Toronto, who was the 1986 SNF Woman of the Year for her unending research on the Serbian people of the USA, Canada and Serbia. Our childhood penpal letters back and forth always shared a Serbian proverb or two, at Olga’s suggestion.\n\nAnd because of Shadeland, my first love (one way!) was from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. At 15 years old, my American girlfriend, Barb, and I made a little green wax record at Conneaut Amusement Park (located 17 miles from Shadeland) singing, “Wake up Little Susie” and at the end, Barb excitedly finished our 3 minutes with only a second or two of recording time left in the little booth with a rushed,\n\n“Mimi just saw Knobby at Shadeland and she’s all shook up!” It’s fun to know I still have that record from almost six decades ago and the memories of Youth/Canada it holds.\n\nCanada was special to me because as a 16 year old (1958?) on my first official choir trip to Canada with our St. Sava Philip Visnich Choir from Pittsburgh, I had the thrill of a lifetime. Out from the curtains we proudly stepped onto the stage, to a packed audience in a local high school, with even the balconies filled to capacity. Professor Boris Dobrovolsky\n\nhttp://www.babamim.com/boris_dobrovolsky_professor_of_music)\n\nreceived a big round of applause as he stepped forwards after us, as his directing abilities were recognized throughout Europe and North America.\n\nUp went his hands and we had only sung two words (“Dol-i-ne Tut-ne”) of Adam Popovich’s arrangement of “Ratne Pesme” out of our mouths, when the packed-hall audience erupted, rising from their seats, clapping and stomping their feet to our music! It was phenomenal, and as you can see, my heart STILL remembers the intense feeling of joy for Canada. I just LOVED it, thinking my heart would surely BURST from the excitement.\n\nWho wouldn’t love Canada with all its great VIDOVDAN celebrations each year? How many times as a child I traveled north with my Dad as he covered these events for the American SRBOBRAN, and a little later in life with my dear +Gus to enjoy the magnificent programs put on by the Canadian Shield Society under maestro Bora Dragasevich’s supervision, listening to Mica Petrovic and his Chetnik orchestra.\n\nAlso very memorable was the day Alex Malich, young Peter Bizic and I traveled north to Niagara Falls, Vidovdan, to MAYBE do some matchmaking with a special Canadian Serbian girl named Colleen Payne, with the help of Alex’s sister, Christina Gacesa. Hey! It worked! Instant rapport! Yes siree, I’ve always had a special fondness for Canada! We earned a whole new family for our efforts and little Amelia Bizic to boot!\n\nSo it was with great happiness I found myself traveling in Cheryl’s husband Tom’s new Honda on Friday afternoon, October 17, 2014, north on Rt. 79 from Pittsburgh, with driver Cheryl Leydig of the SNF and Laurene Maravich (our U.S. A. answer to Canada’s Lepa Jankovic!).\n\nOur St. Elijah Choir of Aliquippa, PA, was the invited guest choir for St. Sava Choir’s 59th Anniversary. Along with our St. Sava Canadian hosts, the Russian “Christ the Savior” Choir under the direction of Elena Eremeeva would also perform.\n\nJoyfully we passed the American and Canadian flags on the Peace Bridge. And with only great memories as our baggage, we surrendered our passports and happily answered questions at the border. “Who’s Milana Bizic?” “I am!” I proudly announced!\n\nOur hosts had arranged for us to stay at a nearby hotel, wherein I saw that my roommate, Marlene Shatlan Volitich, had already checked in. Not surprisingly so, I entered our 4th floor room to find Marlene ironing away, one of her first activities anywhere we travel. Grandson Mike Volitich always has the best looking pressed shirts, and our white (drat that wrinkled linen material!) choir blouses soon followed. “Keep that iron on, Marlene!”\n\nThen out to dinner we went, after Pittsburgh based-Canadian-born Sasa Trklja suggested to his Aunt Joanne and Uncle Bratso Wuchenich the local Serbian restaurant unceremoniously called McAdam Place Restaurant at 5659 McAdam Road. Don’t let the name fool you. The Serbian food was out of this world, great and plentiful. And although there was only one fellow on the keyboard, it sounded like a whole band playing as we sang and danced along to many a recognizable song. Highly recommended to all who travel to Mississauga! Like cousin Jennifer Trklja beams, “It’s the BEST!” We had a tremendous evening for our first night in Canada!\n\nThe next morning we took a stroll to the local mall and I was dumbfounded at the high prices of everything. No wonder why the Canadians love shopping in the lower USA!\n\n+++++++++++++\n\nAs soon as we entered the hall, we were so\n\nThen it was on to “All Serbian Saints Serbian Orthodox Church” complex where our St. Sava Choir hosts were awaiting us at Noon.\n\nAdam Loverich and I first went to check out the church. Oh the beauty! I was in such awe from the moment we opened the metal doors with all of the saints beckoning us inside, to the vastness of the sanctuary in front of us that quickly put me in mind of our beloved monasteries in Kosovo.\n\nThis was a new Gracanica, but with brighter colors not muted by the centuries, and with saints that didn’t have their eyes gouged out from Kosovo Albanians. It was so breathtaking beautiful, my eyes didn’t know where to look first, and I just crossed myself in pure joy and happiness. I hope the attached photos give a glimpse of that magnificence.\n\nThen it was onto the hall itself, a grand lady with historical importance. She started life as a schoolhouse for the agrarian society there in the 1930’s, then became the auto-driver’s licensing center in the ‘60’s, complete with a huge driving course that now serves as a great parking lot. In the 1980’s, the Serbs were far-sighted enough to purchase the property. And what property it is, right along Queen Elizabeth Highway.\n\nYou can’t miss it, coming from the USA, it’s on the left-hand side, with the two flag posts proudly flying the Canadian and Serbian flags. And for double measure, in between the flags, there is an elevated, HUGE horizontal wooden flag painted with the Serbian tri-colors with a golden cross and the 4 C’s, atop the playground area for the children!\n\nOn leaving St. Sava’s late on Sunday afternoon, I loved watching the young ones on the see-saws joyfully playing and counting away, over and over:“Jedan, dva, tri….” under those flags and the golden cross. Oh my heart, my Serbian heart! It was a moment for sure to remember!☺ But I’m getting ahead of myself!\n\nJust minutes later, we were surprised by a magnificent food spread in the adjoining room. My gosh, was this lunch AND supper? It sure looked like that, but you know Serbs! How we were laughing saying we were going to BURST in Canada! Not only from joyous friendship and patriotism on display, but also from the food! (See photos).\n\nBack to the hotel we went for a quick rehearsal with our director, the talented Snezana Lazich,then we changed into our choral costumes, and back to the hall, that was now starting to fill with guests from many surrounding areas of Toronto, Kitchener, Hamilton, etc.\n\nBefore long, the hall was filled in anticipation and we were happy to see so many familiar faces everywhere we looked. Niko Nema! Niko!\n\nBut first we ate again! And this time, a whole pig graced the middle of the sumptuous table! It was better than any Thanksgiving feast! The amount of food prepared was beyond description, just look at the photos to see!\n\nDraga Dragasevich, always one of my favorite Canadian teachers (think Bora, Olga Markovich, Paul Pavlovich, Ambassador James Bissett, Scott Taylor) was Mistress of Ceremonies, and the program got underway just a little after 5:30 PM with the singing of the three national anthems, this time with the Canadian one being first!\n\nWe (St. Elijah Choir) stayed on stage as the others filed off, going first on the program as the guest choir. Although we didn’t have our full choir with us due to a big wedding in Aliquippa that day, I’m sure with our appreciation for all our Canadian hosts did for us that day, we poured out hearts out under the direction of Snezana, who is such a delight to watch! Her eyes, her hands, her hips are all in full motion, urging us to give our best. And we tried to deliver! “Ko pjeva, Zlo ne misli!” Who sings, thinks no evil.\n\nWho would not feel elevated singing “Sej Den” (This is the Day that the Lord hath made) and “Svi Jazici” with the angels flapping their wings in joy? And the now familiar St. Bishop Nikolai’s “Znas Li Ko Te Ljubi Silno” and Mokranjac’s “Kada Mi Se Radoslave.”\n\nVinska Pesma and More!\n\nAll choirs sang familiar liturgical hymns and starosrbijanske pesme, those songs that make you feel as if you’re part of a larger Slavonic world.\n\nThere were many heads in the audience singing along with our ending number of the happy “Vinska Pesma “by Isidor Bajic and Dragie Cuculjevich. Bring that wine glass here! ☺\n\nOur host choir, under the very capable direction of Janez Govednik, who at one time served as a conductor of Moscow Conservatory’s Opera Studio, and later the Belgrade Opera House, and conductor of the National Theater (opera and ballet!) in Novi Sad, and Assistant Conductor to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, sang “Hvalite Imja Gospodnje,” (Aleksandar Arhangelski) “Dostonjo Jest” by Cornelije Stankovic, and “Dve Starosrbijanske Pesme” by Marko Tajcevic before ending with a rousing “Aliluja” by Janez Govednik. You could FEEL the joy they brought to this anniversary concert!\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Choir sang familiar tunes to us: “Vidihom Svet Istinji,” “Angel Vopijase,” “Dostono Jest’, and the “Ballad of the 12 Razboinikov” before the soprano conductor, Elena Eremeeva sang a solo.\n\nIn between all of the songs, St. Sava Mississauga surprised us all with Radomir Micich reciting “Cerska Bitka” in memory of the 100th Anniversary of the first victory of WWI by the Serbian soldiers at the Battle of Cer. He was magnificent in his delivery, and I couldn’t help but think of how much he must have delighted his audiences (AND his teachers!) at his St. Sava’s Day recitations (Declamatcias) every January 2 7 when he was a young lad! Superb. So wonderful!\n\nAnd then M.C. Draga Dragasevich turned to the audience, asking all of us to stand and to join in the singing of “Tamo Daleko!” with the choir’s orchestra. Oh, what a crowd pleaser that was!\n\nAnd the rest of the evening proved likewise as the popular orchestra “Boemi” (Bohemians) played for our listening and dancing pleasure. It was such a delight to see really large kolo circles sometimes three and four people deep circling the floor and singing along to popular tunes. Everyone was so happy!\n\nSunday morning we were up early, enjoyed the breakfast our hosts provided at the hotel, lit our candles in the church’s sanctuary down below, and then it was onto the high climb up the stairs to the choir loft that reminded me of being in Holy Trinity Cathedral in Pittsburgh, wherein the priests and parishioners look like a miniature scene below. No, you wouldn’t need a Kleenex for a nose bleed, but perhaps to wipe away a tear or two as you behold the magnificence of the beautiful icon walls surrounding you, enveloping you, helping you really live the Bible’s story with every turn of your head. Icons are called “Windows to Heaven,” and we were as close to being in Heaven as could be!\n\nThe parishioners below thought they were in Heaven listening to George Milosh sing his famous “Oce Nas” solo while Donna August directed for George, who otherwise directed us that morning. We are so lucky to have such talented members step forth, just like John Lukich, Marina Milojevic-Daoust and Bosiljka Paich do for St. Sava’s Choir of the “All Serbian Saints Serbian Orthodox Church.”\n\nWas it time to eat AGAIN? Who could believe that another feast for the eyes awaited us? What phenomenal hosts our Mississauga people were!\n\nAgain, Draga Dragasevich acted as hostess for the little program that followed, with Bora Dragasevich being a speaker on behalf of the choir. He praised the association our two countries had because of the formidable cohesiveness of the Serbian Singing Federation, thanks to the foresightedness of Vlajko Lugonja, Paul Bielich, and those who followed. He spoke of their choir’s traveling to Pittsburgh and Aliquippa for the SSF Concerts in the past, and the camaraderie that always followed.\n\nA little more about Bora is a must! I was thrilled when Bora gave me a photo of himself bedecked in all the recent medals and honors he received from HRH Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevich (the Order of the Crown with the Great Cross, First Degree (blue sash, medal on his chest, medal at his hip!) and with Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal with the red ribbon, authorized in the Queen’s name by the Governor General of Canada and presented to Bora by a Greek Canadian Member of Parliament at a reception in the Consulate of the Republic of Serbia in December, 2012. Above the red ribbon is the pin of the Srpska Narodna Odbrana (the Serbian National Shield Society). These are orders of the FIRST CLASS, and usually reserved for Serbian Kings, Princes, Prime Ministers, Diplomats, and NIKOLA TESLA!\n\nCongratulations, Bora, and Draga too. Together, they have worked as a team to provide the latest and historical information about the Serbian people in both Serbian and English through their work with the radio program, Serbian Day, the newspaper “Glas Kanadskih Srba,” lectures, etc. Congratulations Sir Bora and Dame Draga Dragasevich!\n\nBora is also the author of the book “Stopama Predaka” or “In the Footsteps of my Forefathers: Autobiography.” The work has received high praise in both the new and OLD country. While we were having Sunday lunch, Bora received word that all 500 of the books sent to Serbia were already sold out!\n\nSpeaking of Serbia, be sure to read the book, JOHAN’S SERBIAN HEART available on the Internet at Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/JOHANS-SERBIAN-HEART-Mico-Popovic-ebook/dp/B00IQWSB82.\n\n(I purchased this book in the hall, and read parts of it aloud on the way home.) Emir Kostunica is making a movie based on this true story, and hence, has become a person non grata in today’s Albanian Kosovo, an honor he wears proudly.)\n\nDiane Volitich, president of our St. Elijah Church Choir presented our hosts with a small check to help with the cost of our stay and enthusiastically thanked all for the exceptional hospitality shown.\n\nA happy “Ziveli” followed! But it didn‘t end! As we were leaving, we each received a CD of St. Sava Choir’s wonderful Christmas CD and a bag full of delicious beef, ham and cheese sandwiches and SO many cookies to eat on the way home! Everyone who had anything to do with hosting us, and even escorting us to our cars like Alex and Mira Brkic, should earn an ABCD Award! “Above and Beyond the Call of Duty!” Thank you, Mississauga! We had a great time! Thank you!\n\nMovers and Shakers:\n\nThe Arbutina Families of Freedom\n\nReal SNF “Braco Jugovici” Freedom, PA Lodge Members\n\nMillard (Milutin) Arbutina, Michael Arbutina, and George Arbutina, all buried very close to each other in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Freedom. A huge contingent from the Beaver County Special Unit conducted full military honors for Millard, who died on St. Sava’s Day, Friday, Jan. 27, 2006, and was buried the following Monday, with V. Rev. Stevan Stepanov conducting the services.\n\nBy Milana (“Mim”) Karlo Bizic\n\nThis story appeared in the American SRBOBRAN on Wednesday, April 19, 2006.\n\n(With thanks to the Memoirs of Millard Arbutina)\n\nI first saw him as I went to record my name in the Visitor’s Book of his deceased uncle, Millard Arbutina, at the William Murphy Funeral Home in Rochester, Pa. He stood tall and handsome in his Air Force blue, full-bird colonel’s uniform, with a military polished look that right away gave away his background.\n\n“You’re the Arbutina who graduated from the Air Force Academy,” I extended my hand. “I’m Mim Bizic. My deepest condolences on the loss of your uncle,” I said sincerely. Then I added, “Your Dad was my principal at the Sewickley Elementary School in Quaker Valley, and later, was our Assistant Superintendent.”\n\n“Yes, I’m Dave Arbutina, “I heard as I watched him break into a winning smile, his large hand warmly meeting mine.\n\n“When you and your brother received your special nominations to the Academies (George Jr. went to the Coast Guard Academy), everyone of our faculty felt a source of pride that only comes from extended family feelings. It wasn’t only your Q.V. family,” I continued, and I could feel my chest heaving up in pride, “but your entire Serbian family as well, and that’s a family that goes from coast to coast. If one Serb makes it, we feel we ALL made it! We’re all very proud of you!”\n\nThe next time I saw him only a few minutes later, he was reading a tribute to his Uncle Millard, a poem that both of them must have heard many times. Entitled HIGH FLIGHT, over the years it has become a mantra to pilots. Written by Pilot Officer Gillespie Magee, RCAF, and killed 11 December, 1941, it goes like this:\n\nHigh Flight\n\nOh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth\n\nAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\n\nSunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth\n\nOf sun-split clouds – and done a hundred things\n\nYou have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung\n\nHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there\n\nI’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung\n\nMy eager craft through footless halls of air.\n\nUp, up the long delirious, burning blue,\n\nI’ve topped the windswept heights with easy grace\n\nWhere never lark, or even eagle flew –\n\nAnd, while with silent lifting mind I’ve trod\n\nThe high un-trespassed sanctity of space,\n\nPut out my hand and touched the face of God.\n\nDistinguished Air Force Cross Medal- Awarded TWO TIMES!\n\nBefore us was Millard Arbutina, my old Quaker Heights neighbor when I lived in Sewickley. Although I admired and loved Millard, somehow I was disappointed, too, reading his obituary, almost angry because I never knew what a real hero he was, and I lived only a block away! Too many of our Serbs have done outstanding things and should be recognized, but people don’t know enough about them.\n\nMillard was a Major in the Army Air Corps. He received the highest award you can get in the Air Force, the Distinguished Flying Cross. Not once, but TWICE! It’s a real honor to get that award, yet alone getting it twice! He was also decorated highly by the Nationalist Chinese Air Force, but let’s back up a little.\n\nMillard was born August 6, 1921, in Freedom, PA, the son of the late George and Stanica Tepsic Arbutina. After graduating from High School in 1939 (where Dani Pevac said he was cheated out of being named President of the Class because of his background and living in the poor “Canadian” side of Freedom even though overwhelmingly elected by his classmates), the brilliant Millard entered the Civilian Conservation Corps, and from there, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nAny of you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corps know that it was a way for poorer families to exist during and after the Great Depression. One child went to the CCC camps, and 95% of the money earned was automatically sent home to feed the family. Others I know personally who did this were also famous heroes: WWII fighter pilot Vic Lumovich and Gus’ uncle, “Ujak” Milosh Klaich, of D-Day fame.\n\nA Dynamic Career\n\nMillard transferred to the U.S. army Air Corps where he earned his wings as a pilot, later becoming a command pilot in December, 1942. He was a veteran of WWII, the Korean War and was then involved with the Berlin Air Lift.\n\nDuring WWII, he flew transport aircraft over the Himalayan Mountains between India and China which at the time was considered the most dangerous “hump” flying that could be done. This was due to terrain, weather, and enemy aircraft.\n\nIn Korea, he flew B-26 aircraft and flew 68 voluntary combat missions. For five years, before retiring, he was an aircraft commander on the RB/47, a six engine jet aircraft. He was also trained as a navigator and a radar bombardier.\n\nAmong his many decorations and campaign medals were: two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star, four air medals, two Presidential Unit Citations, a decoration and a pair of pilot wings by the Chinese Air Force. His campaign medals covered the American and Asiatic-Pacific Campaigns. He had the Army of Occupation Medal (Germany) and Korean War Service Medals.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, he entered what is today known as the University of Central Arkansas to pursue a degree in education. He completed his studies in two years, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. During this time he was a Dean’s List student, and was inducted into the Phi Delta Kappa Educational Fraternity and the history fraternity of Phi Alpha Theta.\n\nEducational Union Activist\n\nHe returned home to Pennsylvania and taught for Freedom (1) and Western Beaver School Districts (4) years. He often said that his teaching years were his golden years, but he felt he could make more of an impact on the profession by joining the staff of the Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA).\n\nHe became a field representative for the union and opened the first field office for the union in Pittsburgh.\n\nMy Kum, Milan Markovich attests to the importance of Millard’s help. Hopewell school teachers never had a contract in those early years, or even the right to negotiate salaries. Milan was President of his Association. John Milanovich (another Serb), was the Superintendent, and there was Millard Arbutina, backing up Markovich and the Hopewell Education Association. It wasn’t easy, but it worked!\n\nMillard devoted many stressful long hours in organizing and negotiating for teachers in order to improve their economic well-being, both from a Pittsburgh office, and then afterwards, in Harrisburg as a Director in Field Services, from which he retired. But he wasn’t finished working!\n\nStrong Work Ethic, even as Senior Citizen\n\nMillard became interested in real estate and went on to earn a real estate license. He worked at Valley Realty Company in Ambridge, and in his own words: “for over 15 very joyful years.” For most of those years he worked as an appraiser and became certified as an independent fee appraiser.\n\nMillard is survived by his wife of 56 years, H. Noreen (Hamm) Arbutina, with whom he traveled the world, including Yugoslavia.\n\nMillard left behind a rich legacy to his son Millard Jr. (Lynne of Gaithersburg, MD), and daughter, Lisa Arbutina Fedorko. (Michael of Ewing, NJ), three step-grandchildren and several adorable foster grandchildren.\n\nDraza Mihailovich Connections\n\nLisa retired from AT&T as a Client Business Manager (Viacom, OBS, UPI), then became an independent contractor for three years before joining Johnson & Johnson where she is the Clinical Project Manager.\n\nLisa shared an important story with me about Draza Mihailovich. While she was working in California, she met Fran Grossman, who has turned out to be a lifelong friend. Upon announcing her Serb background, Fran mentioned how her pilot father had been saved by a Serb during WWII when his airplane was shot down over Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Grossman owned a very successful company in Columbus, Ohio. One of his first acts after establishing himself was to send for his savior Serb in Yugoslavia, sponsor him and his family, and make the fellow Supervisor of the plant! Lisa was sorry she couldn’t remember the name of the Serb, but said she thinks he was related to the Bulat family in Freedom.\n\nLisa is very proud of her brother Millard’s educational and musical accomplishments too. Millard holds a Masters in Psychology and works as a Chaplain in Gaithersburg, MD.\n\nMore Connections: Lance Sijan\n\nLater on in the day of the funeral, I again spoke to Dave Arbutina (George Arbutina’s son, Millard’s nephew). “Being a graduate of the Air Force Academy, did you ever hear of Sijan Hall there?”I asked.\n\n“Lance Sijan?” he queried and my heart thumped at the positive recognition.\n\nIt turns out that Dave, who is now the Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Mt. Nittany Medical Center in Penn State, (State College) PA, graduated from the Academy in 1976, the year of our nation’s Bicentennial. Dave Arbutina was Chairman of the Bicentennial Committee and one of the most important things the Committee wanted to accomplish was to get special recognition for Lance Sijan! Is it a small world or not?\n\nSijan (Dormitory) Hall is named after American Serb Captain Lance P. Sijan (class of 1965). Captain Sijan was the Academy’s first and ONLY graduate so far to receive the Medal of Honor. He received it posthumously for his heroism in Vietnam.\n\nDan shared that there have been further recognitions: The Air Force Academy Library has a special display of Sijan memorabilia, including his headstone from Vietnam. The 440th Airlift wing in his hometown of Milwaukee has a replica of Sijan’s F-4 at the base entrance where the dining hall is named after him. In 2003, a 10 ft. marble monument in the shape of a stylized F-4 pointing upwards was erected at Arlington Park Cemetery. Sijan Circle at Langley AFB in Virginia is named in his honor as is Sijan Street at Whiteman AFB in Missouri. There’s a Lance P. Sijan Chapter of the Air Force Association in Colorado Springs where the Academy is located, and the AF ROTC from Boston University has a squadron there. Each year the Air Force bestows the Lance Sijan Award for Leadership.\n\nMillard’s sister:\n\nMildred Arbutina Pappas\n\nMillard (Miladin) was the middle child in the Arbutina family: Danica (born in Europe), then Milka or Mildred, Miladin, Michael, then George and Demetro (died young). Mildred is another Arbutina who was a great humanitarian and woman of conscience. Her good deeds and works were acknowledged by Educational Television (PBS) WQED Magazine in its December, 1999 issue when it listed her as a “Pittsburgher of the Century.”\n\nMildred Arbutina Pappas:\n\nWhen she was living in Washington in the 1970s, this Beaver County native heard that the historic Vicary House in Freedom was to be razed for expansion of Route 65. PennDOT had already purchased the stone mansion built by sea captain William Vicary around 1826. However, her aggressive campaign and dogged persistence over several years finally succeeded in having alternative plans drawn up and the landmark was saved. Today it is being restored by Beaver County Historical Research and Landmarks Foundation and is open for tours.\n\nThe William Vicary Mansion\n\nA little more about Vicary Mansion from its official website: http://www.bchrlf.org/history__of__the_vicary_mansion.htm\n\n“Sitting atop a gentle knoll overlooking the Ohio River in what is now Freedom, Pennsylvania , sits the stately old mansion built by Captain William Vicary. Long a source of wonder, its unusual construction and elegant style speak of the wealth and status of its former owners.\n\n“Captain Vicary, a retired Philadelphia merchant sea captain and land speculator, moved with his family to his land near Big Sewickley Creek. Looking for land deals, Vicary most likely scouted this area of Beaver County in which to construct his family home. Finding the correct spot, Vicary purchased 604 acres of land, lots #33, 34 & 35, from Mark Wilcox on February 18, 1826 on which to situate his mansion.[1] Within a few months following the purchase, Vicary hired John Moore to do the actual construction. The original contract called for Moore to erect a stone dwelling measuring fifty two feet long by thirty eight feet wide along with a stone smokehouse, necessary, and spring house to be finished in December of 1826 for the sum of $2,450. He was also to construct a barn for an additional $650.\n\n“Faced with the impending destruction of this historical structure, a one-woman letter writing campaign was begun by Mrs. Mildred Arbutina Pappas. A former Freedom resident, Mrs. Papas conducted her campaign from her new home in Washington , D.C.. Thanks to her efforts, and help from local organizations and governments, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation built a retaining wall to save the mansion. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1974, ownership of the land was transferred to Beaver County in the mid-1970’s, with the mansion being purchased from Nannah heirs, Gerald and Aloha Fehr Phillips, for $41,000 in 1982. In February of 1999, the William Vicary Mansion became the official home of the Beaver County Historical Research & Landmarks Foundation. Today, the mansion is being restored to its former grandeur and is open to the public for all to enjoy.”\n\nMildred’s husband worked with the CIA. About 45 years ago, while driving in Europe, a car crash almost ended both of their lives. Mildred suffered a broken neck and wasn’t expected to recover. Taken to a military hospital, she lay in a hospital bed with an iron ball suspended on her neck. Her perseverance and desire to live astounded all of her physicians. She did learn to walk again, albeit with a cane from then on.\n\nBrother Millard was so proud of Mildred’s letters to governors, senators and other influential people instrumental in saving the Freedom mansion, he had all of her work bound into a book. He made extra copies, distributing to his family members, and also sharing with local libraries and historical societies. He also made sure a bronze plaque was placed on the mansion, mentioning her monumental work in preserving it.\n\nThe late Arbutinas were movers and shakers for America. They got things done. Although we mourn the loss of a neighbor as fine as Millard and other family members, we’re grateful there are younger relatives following in their leadership role footsteps.\n\nThe Cherans: Cherished SNF Families\n\nBy Milana (“Mim”) Karlo Bizic\n\n10/3/05\n\nPerhaps you’ve seen that terrific ad from Electrolux ICON gas, suggesting that there is no limit to what YOU can bring to the table. The message goes on to say:\n\n“At my table I set a place for surprise, I serve opinion and sometimes fact; I simmer good conversation.”\n\nIt ends by adding,\n\n“In the well-lived home, more than just eating goes on at the table. It’s a place for celebration, it’s a place for savoring; it’s a place where friendships are forged.”\n\nSuch a description would truly match the table in Sara Komljenovich’s home, where she lives with her sister, Zora Cheran (soon to be 92 on November 26), in the Swissvale part of Pittsburgh, PA, 15218.\n\nMom Laura Mamula Karlo and I accepted an invitation to dinner, but found “the well-lived home,” where we savored renewed friendships, lots of Serbian surprises and many great things to celebrate.\n\nFrom the time of our arrival at their home at 2013 Lafayette Street, we knew we were in for a real treat. All the way out to the curb you could smell delicious aromas of the chicken and rice they were about to serve, along with the apple strudel dessert Sara had so lovingly prepared. Warm hearts and extended hands of friendship helped make the climb up the stairs easier for Mom Laurie.\n\nAnyone who knows ANY of the Cherans knows they are super Serbs, super people! At Sara’s and Zora’s, I learned that not only their father, Petar Cheran, was lucky, but so was the Serb National Federation! You’ll soon learn why.\n\nIt seems that Petar had always dreamed of hitting the lottery, always telling everyone back in the old country that if he ever hit the jackpot, he would move to America. Well, that’s exactly what happened! He won big money in Europe, and used it to come to America. Not long afterwards, the 30 year-old Petar of Yukon, Pennsylvania met the 14 year old Milka Basara, and they were soon married in Wilmerding’s old St. Nicholas Church in 1909. (Monroeville -old Wilmerding-parish- celebrated its 100th Anniversary during Labor Day Weekend, 2005, honoring the memories of such early pioneers!)\n\nI say the SNF is lucky too, because Petar and Milka had ten children, and they were all signed up in the SNF! Look at this roster of Cheran siblings: Alex, Steve, Mike and Roy Cheran, Zora Cheran, Dorothy Podbesek, Mildred Tishma, Ann Vranasevic, Sara Komljenovich, and Martha Simich. They are names familiar to most of the churches in the Pittsburgh area, where Cheran kindness and leadership skills greet visitors in Youngwood, Monroeville, McKeesport, Aliquippa and even St. Petersburg, Florida parishes.\n\nSara says her dad was a real businessman. Not only did Petar work in the coal mines of Yukon, but he started buying up property, too. He was one of the few who had a car or truck in those days, and so he rented himself out as a taxi, or hauled coal for people. Zora and Sara share girlhood giggles when they add that in 1942 he was also good at making moonshine, and was very successful at it.\n\nPetar made Serbian hay, too! By that I mean, he let no grass grow under his feet. As soon as a child was born, whether a member of his family or not, he was always out there signing them up to be members of the Savez, mainly for Yukon Lodge that later merged into the Irwin Lodge #64.\n\n“This was his life: his children, church and lodge. He loved the Savez!” said daughter Sara.\n\nI say, “We need more Petar Cherans!“\n\nPetar’s grandson, Dr. Michael Vranasevic, is Superintendent of the Apollo Ridge School District since 1997. He adds that his grandfather, Petar, was an Elder for the SNF. “He was very bright and knew the Insurance laws and Social Security laws well. He would patiently explain them to the coal mining immigrants of Yukon and Madison in the late 1930’s.”\n\nMike talked about how his grandmother Milka would have a baby in the morning, then get up and start taking care of her huge family, tend her garden, or clean the house by the afternoon.\n\nHe says his grandparents’ home was right in the middle of town, which had a diverse population of Eastern Europeans—Slovenians, Italians, Slovaks, etc. who all got along very well. He is proud of the fact that his Baba Milka was Godmother to Rudy Standish, known all over the world as “The Omelette King.” Even though he is Catholic, he was baptized in the Youngwood Serbian church. Rudy ran away from home when he was 14 or 15 and joined the circus. In between then and now, Rudy became a World Class Chef, who worked for the Scaife, Mellon and Kennedy families. About 10-15 years ago, Rudy came back to his hometown of Yukon. Even at age 90, he will still fly to Houston, New York, or wherever the famous families who love him, need him. Mike adds that Rudy has never let “his”Youngwood Ascension of our Lord Serbian Orthodox Church down. He always finds time to make his famous omelettes as fund-raisers for the church.\n\nMike Vranasevic, who received his doctoral degree from Duquesne University in 1997, said his Uncle Steve took the lead in the family. Steve left Yukon when he was eighteen to go work as a machinist in Detroit for the Ford Motor Company. Laid off a few years later, he returned home, and married the wonderful Lillian Ciganovic. Both of them were very active in the Youngwood Church where Steve served as Church President. (The Ciganovics -Lillian, Katherine, Andja, Helen, and Marko/Nedele from Youngwood), were tremendous SNF supporters too. At one time, Marko was English section editor for the SRBOBRAN, and more recently, Katherine worked extremely hard during the war against Serbia for the Relief Fund for years: collecting, labeling and sending care packages! What good Serbs!\n\nDuring the Depression, Mike says that his Uncle Steve had a bakery business in Smithton, PA, very close to where the famous movie star, Shirley Jones’ father owned a brewery. Shirley would always come into the bakery store to shop when she was home visiting and would be treated to the traditional Cheran hospitality as well. Several of Steve’s sisters worked in the store.\n\n“Steve would bake bread at night and deliver it during the day, but he also hauled coal. When Roy came back from the Marines, he and Steve opened a bar in Duquesne called the ‘Camp Grill,’ around 1947 and operated it until the late 70’s. Around 1957-58, they also had a tire business,” reminisced Mike.\n\n“My Uncle Roy was president of the McKeesport, Duquesne parish with Fr. Popovich for ten or twelve years. That was in the late ‘80’s. And my Aunt Millie Tishma was very active in Florida’s St. Pete’s parish, after she left Pennsylvania in 1965.\n\n(It’s worthy to note that sister Zora Cheran, just donated $1,000 to her old St. Petersburg, Florida church where she was a member for 36 years, and is so proud of the beautiful note she received in return from a grateful parish! Zora says some of her favorite memories of Florida is when all of the ladies got together to make apple strudels to sell for the church’s treasury. They even had Polish and other ethnic neighbors help because it was so much fun being together.)\n\nMike says that his Uncle Steve collected old license plates and that his son, Steve, still pursues the hobby inherited from his Dad. Some of them go back to the time when license plates were first made.\n\nI remembered the older Steve’s passion for old cars. Mike said that his uncle had a 1911 Maxwell that was written up several times in the Sunday section of the ROTO magazine section of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Steve also had an old Hupmobile. Mike thinks that the 1911 Maxwell was donated to the George Blanda (football star) Museum in Youngwood. George Blanda’s brother, Paul Blanda, was married to Steve’s daughter, Dorothy. “Dara’s whole wedding party drove to the reception at the Penn Albert Hotel in Greensburg in those old cars,” Mike recalled fond memories. “The scene was hard to believe and those cars turned a lot of heads in that town!”\n\nIn my father’s Serbian research files, I found a Pittsburgh PRESS article saved by Kay Ciganovic, dated Sunday, July 13, 1958. The title of the article written by David Kelly, Press Staff Writer was: “All Of Youngwood Goes To Wedding.”\n\n“They danced on Youngwood lawns and on the sidewalks and on the streets today at the wedding of Dorothy Cheran and Paul Blanda. It was the biggest wedding hereabouts in 20 years. The jangling chords of tamburitazan music became the beat for the score or more volunteers who cranked up the brides’s father’s 1914 Model T Ford and even the rays of the sun were lost in the smile of 23-year old Miss Cheran.\n\n“The bridesmaids followed in a 1921 Studebaker. There were 1000 guests from Chicago, California, Yukon and Yuma. Dorothy is the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Steve Cheran. They have planned 23 years for this day. They spared nothing to make it the greatest 72 hours in the town’s memory. “\n\nI thought about the photos of those old cars my Dad, Milan Karlo, took when Helen Ciganovich married my mother’s second cousin, Bogdan Mamula. Little sister Sandy (Alexandra–four years old at the time!) was a flower girl, while Rosie and I were up at Shadeland Camp.\n\nTalking about Shadeland, I can’t forget to mention how much work Mike Vranasevic’s sister, Joanne Vranasevic Vidnovic, and her late husband, Bert Vidnovic, did for Shadeland and the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese.\n\nOr how Petar’s grandson, Roy Cheran, headed up the Publicity Committee for the SNF Centennial Celebration in 2001, using his talents so well on our behalf. His mom and dad, Olga and Roy Cheran, Sr., worked very hard for the Serb Net and Istina chapters in Aliquippa for Serbian Relief before passing on. It would be hard to find anyone nicer or kinder than Roy, Sr., and he was also a very faithful churchgoer.\n\nRoy Cheran shared information about how his Dad, Roy Sr. and Djedo Petar were involved in a mine cave in, in Yukon and his Dad vowed never to go back in -which changed his path dramatically.\n\n“The SNF played a major relationship role as my Dad met Mom at an SNF Basketbal Tournament in Cleveland. My Aunts Sarah and Martha, along with cousin JoAnne were the angelic Cherans in the Mckeesport choir for many years. Aunt Martha was known by many as one of the sweetest ladies ever and blessed with a marvelous voice. I remember many a Sunday and Holiday at Aunt Millie’s in Duquesne when they would all sing. The harmonies were mezmorizing. We carried on the SNF tradition as our entire family are currently members. And the boys have performed at the SFF many times as member of the Beaver Valley Jr Tammies.”\n\nWe are all so grateful to Petar and Milka for bequeathing us with such wonderful children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren! Just think about what they “brought to the table!”\n\nNot only did we have great food at Sara and Zora’s “sto,” but just like Petar and Milka used to do at their farm, filling their visitors’ baskets with food or homemade wine, so, too, did daughters Sara and Zora fill us up with all remaining apple strudel! Going home, the car smelled so good and cinnamony, and we felt warm all over.\n\nGod bless those Grandparents-Petar and Milka Cheran for raising such a beautiful family of great American Serbs, friendly, kind and so loving.\n\nIs it possible to ever recover those days —-or are they gone forever? Who knows? Maybe the SNF can hit the Lottery again. Soon!!!!!"
