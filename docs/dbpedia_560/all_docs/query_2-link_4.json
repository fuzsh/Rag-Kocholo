        "text": "Albania has been home to many remarkable individuals who have significantly contributed to medicine. Throughout history, these doctors have left an indelible mark in Albania and internationally, thanks to their dedication, innovations, and compassionate care. Here is a list of the ten most influential Albanian doctors who have shaped medical history with their groundbreaking work.\n\nIbrahim Temo (1865–1945)\n\nVangjel Meksi (1770–1823)\n\nIsuf Kalo (1942–2023)\n\nFerid Murad (1936–2023)\n\nFatmir Dalladaku (1953-Present)\n\nGaqo Adhamidhi (1859–1939)\n\nSali Berisha (1944-Present)\n\nAli Sokoli (1921–1974)\n\nMihal Turtulli (1856–1935)\n\nSami Haxhibeqiri (1933-Present)\n\n1. Ibrahim Temo (1865–1945)\n\nIbrahim Temo’s life is a testament to the complex interplay of medicine, politics, and cultural identity in the early 20th century. Born in 1865 in Struga, within the Ottoman Empire, to a family with a military background, Temo pursued an education that spanned continents. His early involvement in the Albanian national movement and the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) underscored his commitment to medical science and political and social reform. His work as a medical doctor was intertwined with his efforts to shape the future of the Ottoman Empire and Albania, advocating for modernization and education.\n\nTemo’s medical career was as pioneering as his political activities. After studying medicine at the University of Belgrade, he specialized in areas that would position him as a significant figure in the medical community. His contributions to medicine, however, are often overshadowed by his political endeavors. Despite this, his role as a physician provided a unique perspective on the social and health issues facing the populations he served, informing his broader vision for reform and progress within the Ottoman Empire and beyond.\n\nThe latter part of Temo’s life was marked by exile, a testament to the dangers faced by those who dared to challenge the status quo. His death in Romania in 1945 closed the chapter on a life characterized by an unyielding dedication to his country and his profession. Temo’s legacy, however, continues to inspire, embodying the spirit of a man who navigated the complexities of his time with unwavering conviction and a deep-seated belief in the power of education and health care to transform societies.\n\n2. Vangjel Meksi (1770–1823)\n\nVangjel Meksi, born in 1770 in Labovë near Gjirokastër, embarked on a journey that would mark him as a pivotal figure in the Albanian Renaissance. His education in Ioannina laid the foundation for his eventual role as Ali Pasha’s physician. This position allowed him access to broader intellectual circles and facilitated his deep involvement in linguistic and translation efforts. His transition from a court physician to a scholar and translator underscores a remarkable shift towards cultural and educational contributions, highlighting his unique blend of medical and philological expertise.\n\nMeksi’s foray into philology and the development of the Albanian alphabet and grammar showcases his commitment to advancing his language and culture. His efforts in translating religious texts into Albanian, particularly the New Testament, were monumental in making religious and literary texts accessible to the Albanian-speaking population. These translations were not just linguistic feats but also significant steps toward nurturing a national identity and preserving the Albanian language and culture amidst foreign dominance and influence.\n\nMeksi’s legacy transcends his contributions to medicine and translation. His involvement with the Filiki Etaireia and participation in the Greek War of Independence illustrates a life dedicated to scientific and linguistic pursuits and to his people's political and social liberation. Dying in 1823, Meksi didn’t witness the lasting impact of his work, yet his translations and philological contributions remain foundational to the study of the Albanian language and the cultural awakening of the Albanian people.\n\n3. Isuf Kalo (1942–2023)\n\nIsuf Kalo was born in 1942 in Luzat, Tepelenë, a small town in Albania, into a world far removed from the medical achievements he would later contribute to. He began his medical journey at the Faculty of Medicine at Tirana University, graduating in 1964. His early exposure to medicine in a country then isolated from much of the international community shaped his desire to specialize and bring new medical knowledge to Albania.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Kalo specialized in diabetology and endocrinology in several European countries, becoming a pioneer in Albania. His dedication to medicine saw him chair the endocrinology and metabolic diseases department at the Faculty of Medicine and the University Hospital of Tirana. Kalo’s work earned him the titles of Doctor of Medical Sciences and Professor of Medicine, and he was honored with the Distinguished Scientist Worker Award of Albania. Notably, until 1985, he also served as the personal doctor to Enver Hoxha, Albania’s communist dictator, highlighting his prominent status in Albanian medicine.\n\nIn the latter part of his career, from 1991 to 2004, Kalo worked with the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen. There, he led the European Diabetes Program and the Quality of Health System Programme in Europe, contributing significantly to international healthcare. He authored numerous publications and became an honorary member of various medical associations and European committees, marking his transition from a national medical figure to an influential voice on the European stage. Isuf Kalo passed away on 19 January 2023, leaving a legacy of medical advancement and international collaboration.\n\n4. Ferid Murad (1936–2023)\n\nFerid Murad, born on September 14, 1936, in Whiting, Indiana, was the son of an Albanian immigrant and a Baptist mother from Illinois. Growing up working in the family restaurant, Murad was exposed to a blend of cultures and values. His early education set him on a path toward medicine, influenced by his diverse heritage and the rigorous work ethic instilled by his parents. Murad’s interest in medicine was evident from an early age, as he aspired to become a physician, teacher, and pharmacist.\n\nMurad’s academic journey led him to DePauw University on a Rector Scholarship, where he pursued a degree in chemistry before entering the pioneering MD-PhD program at Case Western Reserve University. This dual degree laid the foundation for his future contributions to medicine and pharmacology, earning him degrees in both fields by 1965. Influential mentors marked his education and a commitment to basic and clinical research, shaping him into a multifaceted medical professional.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Murad made significant strides in understanding how drugs like nitroglycerin function by releasing nitric oxide, which relaxes smooth muscle. This groundbreaking work, complemented by the discoveries of colleagues Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro, earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998. Murad’s contributions to science extended beyond his Nobel-winning research, as he was actively involved in academia and industry and continued exploring nitric oxide's therapeutic potential until his passing on September 4, 2023.\n\n5. Fatmir Dalladaku (1953-Present)\n\nFatmir Dalladaku, a German cardiac surgeon of Albanian origin, has significantly contributed to medicine, notably performing the first open-heart surgery in Kosovo. His journey began in the Republic of Kosovo, where, after completing medical studies in Prishtina and Zagreb, he served in various healthcare roles across Kosovo. His early career was marked by dedication to medical practice and specialization in general surgery, laying the groundwork for his future achievements.\n\nIn 1989, Dalladaku’s scholarship to specialize in cardiovascular surgery in Berlin marked a pivotal point in his career, setting him on a path that would see him perform over 4,000 open-heart surgeries. Despite his initial plan to return to Kosovo, political upheavals led him to stay in Germany, where he co-founded the MediClin Herzzentrum clinic in Lahr-Schwarzwald. His commitment to his homeland remained strong, returning in 2003 to perform Kosovo’s first open-heart surgery, showcasing his dedication to advancing medical practice in his country of origin.\n\nBeyond his surgical achievements, Dalladaku’s involvement in pro bono work and education reflects a deep commitment to medical excellence and humanitarian service. His role in administering the first COVID-19 vaccine in Germany in 2020 further exemplifies his leading position in the medical community. Married to Bukurije Oseku-Dalladaku, with two children, he continues impacting lives through his work at MediClin Herzzentrum Lahr/Baden, bridging his expertise and compassion in Germany and Kosovo.\n\n6. Gaqo Adhamidhi (1859–1939)\n\nGaqo Adhamidhi, born in 1859 in Korçë, within the Ottoman Empire’s realm, embarked on a journey that would see him emerge as a distinguished physician and political figure in Albania’s early 20th-century tapestry. Pursuing his medical studies in Egypt, Adhamidhi became ingrained in the Albanian expatriate community. He forged a significant friendship with Mihal Turtulli and served as the personal physician to Abbas II of Egypt, the last khedive.\n\nReturning to Albania amidst the fervor of national independence in 1914, Adhamidhi transitioned from medicine to politics, briefly holding the post of Minister of Finance in Turhan Pasha Përmeti’s inaugural government. His political career, however, was short-lived as the advent of World War I saw him seeking refuge in Switzerland, where he continued to champion Albanian causes, notably chairing the “Albanian National Council” in Geneva and representing Albania in the League of Nations.\n\nDespite his earnest contributions to the medical field and Albania’s nascent statecraft, Adhamidhi’s legacy was humorously caricatured by the Albanian playwright Andon Zako Çajupi. This portrayal as “Dr. Adhamuti” in Çajupi’s satire “Klubi i Selanikut” perhaps belies the profound impact Adhamidhi had on his homeland and the Albanian diaspora. His life, bridging medicine and politics, ended in 1939, leaving a legacy intertwined with Albania’s struggle for identity and sovereignty.\n\n7. Sali Berisha (1944-Present)\n\nSali Berisha, born on October 15, 1944, in Viçidol, Tropojë District, northern Albania, embarked on a journey from a mountain farmer’s child to a renowned cardiologist and a pivotal figure in Albanian politics. His educational journey, fueled by his father’s role in the Party of Labour of Albania, led him to the University of Tirana, where he graduated in medicine in 1967. His quest for medical knowledge took him to Paris for specialization in cardiology, marking the beginning of his illustrious career in the medical field.\n\nBerisha’s medical career was distinguished by his significant contributions to cardiology in Albania. After his studies, he returned to Albania, dedicating his expertise to teaching and practicing cardiology at the University of Tirana and the Tirana General Hospital. His hemodynamic research gained international recognition, establishing him as a leading figure in medical science within Albania and across Europe. His commitment to advancing medical education and research underscored his passion for healthcare and medical innovation.\n\nTransitioning from medicine to politics, Berisha’s legacy expanded as he became Albania’s president and prime minister, implementing substantial reforms. Despite the controversies and political challenges that later marred his career, his early contributions to Albanian healthcare and medical science remain a testament to his diverse capabilities. Berisha’s journey from tending sheep in the mountains of Tropojë to leading his country through transformative years illustrates a remarkable blend of medical excellence and political leadership.\n\n8. Ali Sokoli (1921–1974)\n\nAli Sokoli was born on May 8, 1921, in Rahovec, Kosovo. His early education occurred at the Medrese of Skoplje, where he studied from 1933 to 1941, showcasing an early inclination towards academia. Following his time in Skoplje, he pursued higher education in agriculture at the University of Pisa in Italy, a path that would initially seem distant from his eventual medical profession.\n\nWorld War II marked a significant turn in Sokol’s life trajectory. With the war affecting educational pursuits across Europe, Sokol returned to Kosovo in 1943, where he briefly served as mayor of Xërxë. His academic journey resumed in 1944 at the University of Vienna’s Faculty of Agronomy, but his passion for helping others led him to switch fields. Sokol eventually graduated from the University of Belgrade’s Faculty of Medicine in 1951, further specializing in pulmonology by 1955, a decision that set the course for his future contributions to medicine.\n\nAli Sokol dedicated his professional life to combating lung diseases, beginning his medical practice in 1956 in Prizren and Gjakova before settling at the Lung Disease Clinic in Pristina in 1959. Throughout his career, Sokol made significant contributions to the field of pulmonology, earning recognition and respect. His legacy continues to inspire, with a secondary medical school in Pristina named in his honor, a testament to his lasting impact on medical education and public health in Kosovo. Sokol passed away on September 23, 1974, leaving a legacy of medical excellence and dedication.\n\n9. Mihal Turtulli (1856–1935)\n\nMihal Turtulli Bey, born in 1856 in Korçë, Ottoman Empire, was a respected oculist and a distinguished figure in the Albanian political arena. Raised in El-Fayyūm, Egypt, within the Albanian expatriate community, Turtulli pursued medical studies in Greece and France, honing his expertise in ophthalmology. His professional journey led him back to Egypt, where he served as a physician until the pivotal moment of Albania’s independence in 1912, prompting his return to his homeland.\n\nTurtulli’s contributions to Albania extended beyond medicine; he played a significant role in the nation’s early political developments. As a fervent supporter of Prince Wied’s ascension to the Albanian throne, Turtulli’s influence was instrumental in shaping the provisional government of Albania. Appointed Minister of Health and Education in 1914, his tenure was marked by advocacy for unity and education, reflecting his commitment to Albania’s socio-political evolution. His diplomatic efforts, particularly at the Paris Peace Conference, underscored his dedication to defending Albania’s interests on the international stage.\n\nDespite his political engagements, Turtulli’s medical legacy as an oculist remained influential, especially among the Albanian diaspora in Egypt, where he eventually settled following political upheavals in Albania. His life, bridging the fields of medicine and politics, highlights the multifaceted impact of Albanian professionals in the early 20th century. Turtulli’s endeavors, from his medical practice to his political advocacy, left an indelible mark on Albania’s journey towards independence and nation-building.\n\n10. Sami Haxhibeqiri (1933-Present)\n\nSami Haxhibeqiri, born on June 7, 1933, in Mitrovica, hails from a family that valued education deeply. His academic journey in medicine began in Skopje, culminating in his graduation in 1959. Haxhibeqiri’s commitment to medicine, particularly surgery, laid the groundwork for significant advancements in medical practices in Mitrovica and Kosovo, marking him as a foundational figure in the region’s medical education and surgical practice.\n\nHaxhibeqiri’s professional milestones are notable for his pioneering roles and contributions. Completing his specialization in General Surgery in 1964, he became the first Albanian surgeon in the former Yugoslavia, a testament to his dedication and skill. His tenure as the chief of a medical ward in 1968 at the Mitrovica General Hospital was groundbreaking, establishing him as a leader in Kosovo’s medical community. Haxhibeqiri’s educational contributions are equally significant, teaching various medical subjects and nurturing the next generation of medical professionals.\n\nHis further specialization in Thoracic Surgery in 1972 underlined his relentless pursuit of medical excellence, becoming the first Albanian in this field in the former Yugoslavia. Haxhibeqiri’s leadership extended beyond surgery, notably as the director of the Mitrovica Regional Hospital, where he significantly increased the employment of Albanian health workers, fostering a more inclusive and representative medical community. Despite political challenges, his unwavering commitment to medical service and education left an indelible mark on Kosovo’s healthcare landscape.\n\nFurther Reading Resources\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the lives and contributions of these remarkable individuals, here are five resources that provide further insight into the world of Albanian medical history and the doctors who have shaped it."
