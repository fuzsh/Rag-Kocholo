SAXON: Thank you, Your Honours.\n\n9 Your Honours, the Defence complained because the Prosecution did\n\n10 not provide to them a so-called investigator's note describing two\n\n11 conversations with Mr. Baki Halimi during the last part of 2005.\n\n12 It is correct, Your Honours, that until Wednesday the Prosecution\n\n13 did not produce such a note and disclose it to the Defence. The\n\n14 Prosecution did that on Wednesday because it received a communication from\n\n15 Defence counsel indicating that the statement of Prosecution investigator\n\n16 Thomas Kuehnel refers to a meeting with Mr. Baki Halimi. And when I\n\n17 received -- and the Defence asked, Well, is there an investigator note?\n\n18 Can you please give us a record of this meeting. I then spoke with the\n\n19 investigator in this case, and I asked the investigator to produce a note\n\n20 from his notes that he wrote at that meeting. And I will say in all\n\n21 candour, Your Honour, that I was present at one of those meetings with\n\n22 Mr. Halimi in late 2005 and simply, Your Honour, there was an error. No\n\n23 investigator note was produced in late 2005.\n\n24 But the matter doesn't end there, Your Honours. In a signed\n\n25 witness statement by Prosecution investigator Thomas Kuehnel, at paragraph\n\nPage 5737\n\n1 98 Mr. Kuehnel relates that in a meeting with Mr. Baki Halimi, Mr. Halimi\n\n2 told the Prosecution that he was: \"Raising funds for the NLA during\n\n3 2001.\" That witness statement was disclosed to the Defence in March of\n\n4 2006. So the Defence have been in possession of the core point from the\n\n5 conversation with Mr. Halimi, the conversations I should say, for the past\n\n6 18 months.\n\n7 Therefore, in the Prosecution's submission, with respect to Mr. --\n\n8 with respect to information provided by Mr. Halimi back in 2005, there has\n\n9 been no disclosure breach under Rule 66(B) or Rule 68. The Defence\n\n10 counsel asked the Prosecution counsel for an investigator note and we\n\n11 provided one.\n\n12 If I can turn now to my colleague Mr. Mettraux's submissions about\n\n13 the liability of the testimony of Mr. Bushi and whether that testimony\n\n14 should be allowed. First of all, I should also tell -- I should say to\n\n15 the Chamber that there was certainly no intent on the part of the\n\n16 Prosecution to lead false evidence.\n\n17 Yesterday in a conversation with Mr. Mettraux I was candid with\n\n18 him when he asked me if I \"believed Mr. Baki Halimi,\" what Mr. Halimi had\n\n19 previously told the Prosecution. Whether Mr. Halimi because Mr. Halimi\n\n20 had informed the Prosecution that during 2001 he provided logistical\n\n21 support to the NLA and I told Mr. Mettraux, yes.\n\n22 Therefore, Your Honour, at the close of this trial, the\n\n23 Prosecution will not rely on Nazim Bushi's evidence provided during direct\n\n24 examination on a particular point and this is at page 5609, line 1 to line\n\n25 3, where Mr. Bushi said that Baki Halimi was not assisting the NLA in any\n\nPage 5738\n\n1 way.\n\n2 However, Your Honour, the final result should not be to discard\n\n3 the remainder of Mr. Bushi's evidence.\n\n4 Your Honour, if the Prosecution has reason to believe that a\n\n5 witness may not be giving completely truthful or accurate evidence on one\n\n6 point, does that mean that the remainder of the witness's evidence cannot\n\n7 be presented? And in the Prosecution's submission, the practice and the\n\n8 jurisprudence of this Tribunal would answer no.\n\n9 In fact, Your Honours, it is an everyday occurrence at trials\n\n10 before this Tribunal that witnesses provide testimony that may not be\n\n11 fully truthful or accurate and the task is then left to Trial Chambers\n\n12 after hearing all of the evidence, to determine what weight, if any, to\n\n13 give to such evidence. And I would respectively refer the Trial Chamber\n\n14 to the Appeals Chamber's discussion of the effort of Witness AT in the\n\n15 Kordic appeal judgement, paragraphs 244 to 294 of judgement dated 17\n\n16 December 2004. And that discussion by the Appeals Chamber confirmed\n\n17 decisions made by the Kordic Trial Chamber with respect to the evaluation\n\n18 of a Witness AT in the Kordic trial judgement.\n\n19 So, Your Honour, in the Prosecution's submission, both the\n\n20 practice of this Tribunal and the jurisprudence of this Tribunal would\n\n21 not -- would not support the discarding of Mr. Bushi's evidence.\n\n22 JUDGE PARKER: Mr. Mettraux.\n\n23 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, if I could be permitted to reply very\n\n24 briefly.\n\n25 The complaint identified by Mr. Saxon to the effect that our\n\nPage 5739\n\n1 complaint is one about a failure to disclose material clearly relevant to\n\n2 these proceedings and clearly falling within the terms of Rule 68 is\n\n3 incorrect. Yes, this is one of the issue relevant to this matter, but\n\n4 this is not the nut of the problem. Our concern here, Your Honour, is\n\n5 that the Prosecution has sought to elicit, positively elicit evidence\n\n6 which it knew to be false or should have known to be false. The\n\n7 Prosecution attempt to limit the question to whether or not Mr. Halimi was\n\n8 or wasn't a member of the NLA and what role he plays is not correct. The\n\n9 proofing notes which were given to us by the Prosecution in the past few\n\n10 days have a much broader scope of relevance.\n\n11 The second complaint of the Defence is that the Prosecution is now\n\n12 seeking to rely on evidence that it has failed to investigate properly as\n\n13 mentioned by my colleague Mr. Apostolski.\n\n14 A third complaint is that the Prosecution seeks to rely on the\n\n15 evidence of a man who has shown his willingness not to be truthful with\n\n16 the Prosecutor or with the Chamber.\n\n17 Mr. Saxon has indicated that it is for the Chamber ultimately to\n\n18 decide on the reliability or otherwise of a witness and that is correct.\n\n19 There is, however, an obligation in the Prosecution's own internal rules\n\n20 of 1999, Article 2, which compels them only to elicit evidence which they\n\n21 know to be true or believe can contribute to the finding of the truth.\n\n22 Your Honour, the matter is not one of the Defence ability to\n\n23 cross-examine this witness, in our submission. This witness should never\n\n24 have been brought before this Chamber. Furthermore, and I reiterate the\n\n25 fact that the unreliability we submit of Mr. Bushi in relation, in\n\nPage 5740\n\n1 particular, to Mr. Halimi is revealing of his willingness and readiness to\n\n2 be untruthful about the two matters, the two sole matters which are\n\n3 relevant to his evidence, the presence and role of the NLA in or around\n\n4 Ljuboten on the 12th, and his unwillingness or unwillingness to assist the\n\n5 Trial Chamber in obtaining reliable information about the inner\n\n6 functioning of his organisation, the NLA.\n\n7 MR. SAXON: May I make a 30-second point, Your Honour?\n\n8 JUDGE PARKER: Only because the issue is so significant,\n\n9 Mr. Saxon. Otherwise, if there was a matter, you ought to have dealt with\n\n10 earlier. But yes.\n\n11 MR. SAXON: It is simply to correct a statement that my learned\n\n12 colleague Mr. Apostolski made earlier where Mr. Apostolski said that the\n\n13 investigator note disclosed recently to the Defence indicate that Sulejman\n\n14 Bajrami, one of the named victims in this case, was a member of the NLA.\n\n15 This is not correct. The investigator's notes say that according to\n\n16 Mr. Halimi, Sulejman Bajrami was not a member of the NLA.\n\n17 JUDGE PARKER: I think that, Mr. Apostolski, you should have\n\n18 another word.\n\n19 MR. APOSTOLSKI: [Interpretation] It seems I will have to resort to\n\n20 my 30 seconds, Your Honours.\n\n21 I said that the brother of Sulejman was a member of the NLA.\n\n22 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you.\n\n23 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n24 JUDGE PARKER: Mr. Saxon, the Chamber would like to be made more\n\n25 clear in its understanding of the reasons why there had not been a\n\nPage 5741\n\n1 complete and adequate disclosure as required, in particular by Rule 68.\n\n2 MR. SAXON: An oversight, Your Honour. I cannot give a better\n\n3 explanation than that.\n\n4 Yesterday, after the investigator note related to Mr. Halimi was\n\n5 produced and disclosed on Wednesday, I then began a review of all other\n\n6 investigator notes in the Prosecution's possession, and identified several\n\n7 more investigator's notes which I thought had been disclosed in early\n\n8 2006. They had not been and they were disclosed yesterday. One of them\n\n9 at least in particular is relevant to the evidence of Mr. Bushi.\n\n10 JUDGE PARKER: Had not been for the care, then, of the Defence of\n\n11 Mr. Boskoski, this trial might have reached its conclusion without matters\n\n12 of such materiality being revealed. Is that the situation?\n\n13 MR. SAXON: That's possible, Your Honour, yes.\n\n14 JUDGE PARKER: The Chamber proposes to adjourn now for a little\n\n15 time.\n\n16 --- Break taken at 9.37 a.m.\n\n17 --- On resuming at 9.44 a.m.\n\n18 JUDGE PARKER: An issue of considerable significance has been\n\n19 raised by counsel for the two accused.\n\n20 It appears to the Chamber that if it is considered closely, the\n\n21 primary issue is a failure of the Prosecution to have disclosed material\n\n22 information in its possession, information which could well assist the\n\n23 Defence of each accused in the pursuit of their respective cases.\n\n24 The failure to disclose has now been corrected. The focal\n\n25 significance of the information, which has not been disclosed until this\n\nPage 5742\n\n1 late stage, directly relates to the present witness, who is still in the\n\n2 course of cross-examination. It is therefore the case that the material\n\n3 effect of this information now disclosed is able to be used by both\n\n4 Defences in dealing with the witness and in the pursuit of the balance of\n\n5 their respective cases in the trial.\n\n6 It is also the case that this information may have been of value\n\n7 to the Defence for each accused in dealing with some previous witnesses.\n\n8 If there has been some significant adverse effect, that can be dealt with\n\n9 by an application, most obviously, to recall any witness who is so\n\n10 affected.\n\n11 The Chamber is concerned that there should have been such a\n\n12 significant failure in compliance with the rules of disclosure. It is a\n\n13 matter in which the Chamber accepts that there was no knowing or\n\n14 deliberate withholding of information, and, indeed, that is not suggested\n\n15 by counsel for the Defence. But the Chamber is concerned to ensure that\n\n16 the fairness of the trial is not adversely affected, and it therefore will\n\n17 insist that the Prosecution now undertake a complete and further review of\n\n18 its material to ensure that there is no further failure to disclose what\n\n19 is, quite obviously, information of significance to each Defence.\n\n20 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n21 JUDGE PARKER: Counsel, in particular for Mr. Boskoski, did raise\n\n22 some additional matters in his submissions.\n\n23 It does appear to the Chamber that each of those matters are\n\n24 really directed to the weight and reliability which should, in the end, be\n\n25 given and attributed to the evidence in particular of the present\n\nPage 5743\n\n1 witness. Those are matters upon which, in light of all the evidence in\n\n2 the trial and the submissions which will undoubtedly be made about them,\n\n3 can and will be effectively considered by the Chamber in its final\n\n4 evaluation of the case.\n\n5 We would add that there can be no question that a witness's\n\n6 evidence may, in part, be reliable, and, in part, not, and the\n\n7 circumstance that in some part evidence is not reliable or is false does\n\n8 not necessarily preclude that witness being called by the Prosecution,\n\n9 despite the particular obligations on the Prosecution in the case, nor, of\n\n10 course, by the Defence, if it is that they choose to call evidence in the\n\n11 case.\n\n12 We are therefore of the view that despite what has occurred, the\n\n13 fairness of the trial is not so adversely affected as to call for any more\n\n14 drastic action on the part of the Chamber. In particular, we are not of\n\n15 the view that it is appropriate that we should order that this present\n\n16 witness's evidence should cease or that we should direct ourselves to\n\n17 disregard what has been said by the witness to date. In fact, in our\n\n18 view, the fairness which we owe to each accused in their trial is likely\n\n19 to be better served by allowing to the Defence full opportunity to explore\n\n20 all aspects of the witness's evidence with a view to a more full and\n\n21 adequate disclosure of its deficiencies.\n\n22 For these brief reasons, the motion of the Defence will not be\n\n23 granted.\n\n24 The witness should be called.\n\n25 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, perhaps to indicate a very short\n\nPage 5744\n\n1 matter.\n\n2 The Defence is obviously ready to continue with the\n\n3 cross-examination and we will. It may be, however, that we will seek the\n\n4 postponement of the rest of the cross-examination at some stage, in\n\n5 particular in relation to the issues material to the documents which have\n\n6 been given to the Defence with a view to perhaps obtain further\n\n7 information from Macedonia.\n\n8 At this stage, Your Honour, we will propose to continue and should\n\n9 the need arise, we would indicate it to the Chamber later on.\n\n10 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you for that indication, Mr. Mettraux. The\n\n11 Chamber had understood that from the effect of your submission and\n\n12 proceeded on that basis.\n\n13 MR. METTRAUX: I'm grateful to Your Honour.\n\n14 JUDGE PARKER: But clearly, if either Defence is adversely\n\n15 affected in some significant way by the late disclosure, that is a matter\n\n16 that should be raised.\n\n17 [The witness entered court]\n\n18 JUDGE PARKER: Good morning, Mr. Bushi.\n\n19 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Good morning.\n\n20 JUDGE PARKER: I remind you of the affirmation that you made at\n\n21 the beginning of your evidence which still applies.\n\n22 Mr. Mettraux.\n\n23 MR. METTRAUX: I'm grateful to Your Honour.\n\n24 WITNESS: NAZIM BUSHI [Resumed]\n\n25 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\nPage 5745\n\n1 Cross-examination by Mr. Mettraux: [Continued]\n\n2 Q. Good morning, Mr. Bushi.\n\n3 A. Good morning.\n\n4 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, before we start with the evidence\n\n5 there is a matter which yesterday we had omitted to do and that was to\n\n6 tender the last document which was shown to the witness. This was Rule 65\n\n7 ter 1D822, this was a special report of the OSCE dated the 21st of March\n\n8 of 2001 which contains a declaration by all Albanian political parties\n\n9 represented in the parliament of the Republic of Macedonia and which\n\n10 rejected the actions and violence of the so-called NLA.\n\n11 Your Honour, we would seek to tender this document.\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: It will be received.\n\n13 THE REGISTRAR: As Exhibit 1D225, Your Honours.\n\n14 MR. METTRAUX:\n\n15 Q. Mr. Bushi, do you recall that on Wednesday when we parted I was\n\n16 asking you questions about the goal and purpose of your organisation. Do\n\n17 you recall that?\n\n18 A. Yes, I do.\n\n19 Q. And do you recall stating your belief that your organisation had\n\n20 the support and I think you said moral support of the Albanian community\n\n21 in Macedonia. Do you recall that?\n\n22 A. Yes, I do.\n\n23 Q. And do you recall that I showed you a declaration signed by all\n\n24 political parties represented in the Republic of Macedonia, which rejected\n\n25 the violence used by your organisation. Do you recall that?\n\nPage 5746\n\n1 A. Yes, I recall it.\n\n2 Q. And would you agree with the proposition that the suggestion that\n\n3 you had large support, moral or otherwise, from the Albanian population in\n\n4 Macedonia is incorrect. Do you agree with that?\n\n5 A. I abide by what I said about the moral support, whereas in\n\n6 parliament only two political parties were represented, which does not\n\n7 necessarily mean to say that they were the sole representatives of the\n\n8 Albanian people.\n\n9 Q. Sir, I will ask the question again.\n\n10 Do you agree with the proposition that in fact and in truth you\n\n11 were not welcomed in the Albanian communities which your group occupied.\n\n12 Do you agree with that proposition?\n\n13 A. No, I do not agree with it. It is not true.\n\n14 Q. Do you agree with the proposition that the entire international\n\n15 community, every state, every international organisation, rejected your\n\n16 movement as an illegitimate criminal organisation, a terrorist group and\n\n17 extremist organisation. Do you agree with that?\n\n18 A. I do not agree with that because the NLA was not a terrorist\n\n19 organisation. It was a regular army with its uniform and logo and the\n\n20 internal rules.\n\n21 MR. METTRAUX: Could the witness please be shown what is Rule 65\n\n22 ter 1D827, please.\n\n23 Q. But let me put that to you in view of your response first,\n\n24 Mr. Bushi. Isn't the truth that it was the lack of legitimacy and the\n\n25 lack of support from the entire international community that led to you\n\nPage 5747\n\n1 pretend to be an army and give yourself military sounding names and\n\n2 military sounding organisations. Do you agree with that?\n\n3 A. No, I do not agree with that.\n\n4 Q. Mr. Bushi, this is a document, I apologise again it is a document\n\n5 that is in the English only. It doesn't have a Macedonian or an Albanian\n\n6 translation. But this is a document which comes from the OSCE, the\n\n7 Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, it is dated the 3rd\n\n8 of May of 2001.\n\n9 MR. METTRAUX: And, Your Honour, I will simply indicate there are\n\n10 a number of redactions made in the text of the document. Those redactions\n\n11 were made by the OSCE prior to disclosure to the Defence.\n\n12 I'll ask the registry to turn to page 3 of this document that will\n\n13 be 1D00-7221.\n\n14 Q. Sir, this is a document that talks about the situation in early\n\n15 May 2001 in and around Vaksince and Slupcane. And I would simply read one\n\n16 paragraph to you from this report. Is says this --\n\n17 A. I apologise, I don't have this document in front of me.\n\n18 Q. Well, I should be apologising, Mr. Bushi. The document doesn't\n\n19 exist in Albanian or in Macedonian. I will therefore have to read it out\n\n20 to you. Is says this.\n\n21 A. Okay. But please more slowly if you can.\n\n22 Q. \"There is it deep concern that given the fact that the inhabitants\n\n23 of the villages under control of the ethnic Albanian armed group east of\n\n24 the Crna Gore are not permitted to leave, a call by the government for\n\n25 them to do so would achieve little. Whilst it is a logical demand to make\n\nPage 5748\n\n1 and in line with what one might expect of any other country in similar\n\n2 circumstances, there is a fear that the military/police action may ensure\n\n3 later this afternoon putting many of the assessed 20.000 inhabitants at\n\n4 risk. It is clear that the ethnic Albanian armed group would claim that\n\n5 all villagers are supporters of their cause. This is it emphatically not\n\n6 the case.\"\n\n7 Isn't that the case, Mr. Bushi, that in fact and in truth your\n\n8 movement had no support in any part or in very limited part of Macedonian\n\n9 society, whether Albanian or Macedonian?\n\n10 A. The NLA had the support of all the Albanians, whereever they\n\n11 lived.\n\n12 Q. And you also know that in a number of villages, including in\n\n13 Ljuboten, Mr. Bushi, villagers protested your presence or your attempts to\n\n14 infiltrate the villages. Are you aware of that?\n\n15 A. No, I'm not aware of that.\n\n16 Q. Do you recall, Mr. Bushi, telling my colleague and myself on\n\n17 Wednesday that the purpose of your organisation was allegedly to promote\n\n18 the human rights of the Albanian people and to deal with what you\n\n19 perceived to be discriminations in public and official function. Do you\n\n20 recall saying that?\n\n21 A. Yes, I recall that.\n\n22 Q. Well, Mr. Bushi, I'm putting to you that that is just a facade and\n\n23 the real purpose of your organisation was to carve a part of the territory\n\n24 and to keep power and money for the leaders of your moment. Is that\n\n25 correct?\n\nPage 5749\n\n1 A. No, this is not correct. Had we wanted to take over parts of the\n\n2 territory, we would have done so.\n\n3 Q. And I'm also putting to that you to achieve that goal you used\n\n4 violence to undermine Macedonian stability and had recourse to criminal\n\n5 and terroristic means to achieve your goals. Do you agree with that?\n\n6 A. Can you please indicate to me what terrorist acts the NLA has\n\n7 committed? And it is not true what are you putting to me. The NLA\n\n8 engaged in a war because the Albanian people was discriminated as of 1990s\n\n9 onwards, even earlier than that, so I can't ask you to indicate a single\n\n10 crime or a single terrorist act committed by the NLA.\n\n11 Q. Well, we will come to the crimes and the alleged discrimination in\n\n12 a moment, Mr. Bushi. But isn't that right that the issues or the goals\n\n13 which you claim to pursue through means of violence, murder, expulsion,\n\n14 torture, sexual violence and others were in fact being properly dealt with\n\n15 in democratic fashion by the elected authorities of Macedonia. Do you\n\n16 agree with that?\n\n17 A. No, I do not agree with that. I don't know where you got this\n\n18 information from. It is not at all true, Your Honour.\n\n19 Q. Well, will you perhaps agree with that then, Mr. Bushi, had you no\n\n20 intention - and by \"you\" I mean you and your organisation - to play by the\n\n21 democratic rules, to start a political party and to put your ideas forward\n\n22 with a view to seek the support of the people who you claim supported your\n\n23 movement. Do you agree with that?\n\n24 A. Our aim, when the first democratic party for democratic prosperity\n\n25 was form was that after we saw that, the political parties did nothing to\n\nPage 5750\n\n1 redress the demands of the Albanian people, which fell in the deaf ears of\n\n2 the Macedonian authorities.\n\n3 Q. Well, we'll turn to that right now, Mr. Bushi.\n\n4 MR. METTRAUX: But before I do so, Your Honour, I would seek to\n\n5 tender the document that is on the screen.\n\n6 JUDGE PARKER: It will be received.\n\n7 THE REGISTRAR: As Exhibit 1D226, Your Honours.\n\n8 MR. METTRAUX: Would the registry please bring up what is Rule 65\n\n9 ter 1D713, it has an ERN of 1D00-6274.\n\n10 Q. Mr. Bushi, the document that I am about to show you is again,\n\n11 unfortunately, in English only so there is no translation in Macedonian or\n\n12 Albanian, but I will read it out to you.\n\n13 This is the record of a hearing before the committee on foreign\n\n14 relations of the United States of America at the Senate. It concerns the\n\n15 crisis in Macedonia and US engagement in the Balkans. It dated the 13th\n\n16 of June of 2001.\n\n17 MR. METTRAUX: I will ask the registry to turn to page 1D00-6278.\n\n18 And if you could please focus on the bottom of the page.\n\n19 Q. Mr. Bushi, want I want to read to you is simply the last paragraph\n\n20 on that page which is, if you wish, an introduction of the subject matter\n\n21 of this particular hearing of the US Senate, and it says the\n\n22 following: \"Today's hearing has a two-part focus. First, we will discuss\n\n23 the extremely volatile situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of\n\n24 Macedonia, a country that just one year ago was considered a model of\n\n25 inter-ethnic cooperation but now teeters on the brink of civil war.\"\n\nPage 5751\n\n1 MR. METTRAUX: I'll ask the registry now to turn to page\n\n2 1D00-6283.\n\n3 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'm going read to you is the statement of one\n\n4 high-ranking US Senator, Mr. -- or Senator Helms who expressed his view\n\n5 about the situation in Macedonia in the following terms: \"Until recently\n\n6 Macedonia was a model, albeit an imperfect one, for inter-ethnic\n\n7 co-existence and democratic rule in Europe's most war-torn region. Now,\n\n8 within the past few month things have changed. Ethnic Albanian terrorists\n\n9 are today using violence in an effort to undermine Macedonia's stability.\"\n\n10 Mr. Bushi, do you agree that's what you were doing at that time in\n\n11 2001?\n\n12 A. It is not true. The reality is different from what you read to\n\n13 me, the actual reality was completely different.\n\n14 Q. Let's go on reading then. Senator Helms says: \"Now, I realise\n\n15 that there are legitimate Albanian grievances--\" well, I missed a\n\n16 sentence. I will start again: \"Indeed, I am impressed by the restraint\n\n17 with which the government of Macedonia has responded to these vicious\n\n18 attacks. Now, I realise that there are legitimate Albanian grievances in\n\n19 Macedonia but none warranting a turn to violence.\"\n\n20 And he goes on to say this: \"This point has been wisely\n\n21 underscored by the refusal of Macedonians leading ethnic Albanian parties\n\n22 to side with the terrorists. Instead, ethnic Albanian parties have\n\n23 condemned violence and are working with other Macedonian political parties\n\n24 as part of a national unity government, and the potential success of this\n\n25 unity government is a threat to all ethnic extremists in the Balkans.\"\n\nPage 5752\n\n1 Isn't the truth, Mr. Bushi, that you and your organisations made\n\n2 everything in your power using violence, crimes to prevent a unity\n\n3 government to take care of those issues which you say you were trying to\n\n4 promote. Isn't that the truth, Mr. Bushi?\n\n5 A. I will respond to your question.\n\n6 But, Your Honour, I would kindly ask you to give me more time to\n\n7 go in greater length in my response.\n\n8 JUDGE PARKER: Try giving your answer, Mr. Bushi.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] It is not true what the counsel is\n\n10 putting to me. You should know that in the Macedonian parliament there\n\n11 was a member who later joined the NLA members precisely because of the\n\n12 discrimination that was perpetrated against Albanians from 1991 because\n\n13 the demands put forward by the Albanians through their political parties\n\n14 were disregarded.\n\n15 I know that the United States, NATO and the international factor\n\n16 does not sit down to negotiate with the terrorists. In 2001 the war was\n\n17 over after an agreement was signed, namely the Ohrid Framework Agreement\n\n18 with guarantees put forward by the United States, NATO, and the European\n\n19 community.\n\n20 MR. METTRAUX:\n\n21 Q. Well, Mr. Bushi, I'm grateful for this answer and we go to the\n\n22 issue of the parliament in a minute.\n\n23 MR. METTRAUX: But at this stage I will ask the registry to turn\n\n24 to page 1D00-6284. And will ask the registry to focus on the second half\n\n25 of the page. Thank you.\n\nPage 5753\n\n1 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'm about to read to you is a statement made by\n\n2 Ambassador James Pardew, senior advisor on the Balkans, Bureau of European\n\n3 Affairs, Department of State, and it still before the US Senate, but\n\n4 before I do that, do you know who Mr. James Pardew is and was in 2001?\n\n5 A. Yes. I remember that.\n\n6 Q. And can you help the chamber -- [Previous translation\n\n7 continues] ... and can you tell what function --\n\n8 A. He was one of the mediators between the NLA and the Macedonian\n\n9 forces, especially in the case of the withdrawal from Haracin.\n\n10 Q. But his real function was not to mediate between you and the\n\n11 government; his real function was to assist the legitimate democratic\n\n12 political parties in Macedonia to reach an agreement which would allow the\n\n13 country to return to a more peaceful existence. Isn't that true,\n\n14 Mr. Bushi?\n\n15 A. It is true, but that was also true.\n\n16 Q. Well, let's look at the evaluation which Mr. Pardew gave of the\n\n17 situation in Macedonia in 2001. And I will read it out to. It starts\n\n18 with the word \"the situation today.\"\n\n19 \"The situation today in Macedonia is precarious. The insurgence\n\n20 National Liberation Army, NLA, launched its first attacks in north-west\n\n21 Macedonia in February. Since then, the fighting has continued off and on\n\n22 largely in ethnic Albanian areas. Most recently the NLA occupation of the\n\n23 town of Aracinovo near Skopje and its airport poses a potential threat to\n\n24 NATO supply lines.\"\n\n25 And he goes on to say this: \"No one should mistake the position\n\nPage 5754\n\n1 of the United States administration. We absolutely oppose the NLA's use\n\n2 of violence to undermine the democratically elected Macedonian government\n\n3 and its leaders. We condemn the NLA's apparent effort to provoke an\n\n4 overreaction by the government against Albanian citizens in order to\n\n5 bolster their support from the ethnic Albanian community.\"\n\n6 And that's what I put to you yesterday, Mr. Bushi, or Wednesday -\n\n7 you may recall it - that's what you were trying to achieve in Ljuboten\n\n8 when you ordered your men, the people under you in your organisation, to\n\n9 shell the position of the Macedonian forces in or around Ljuboten. You\n\n10 tried to lure them into the village to create an incident and then to use\n\n11 it for propaganda purposes and to increase the support of your\n\n12 organisation. Isn't that what you did, Mr. Bushi?\n\n13 A. No, it is not true. I already said that. We didn't need such\n\n14 propaganda because the NLA was an organised army force and we could have\n\n15 infiltrated everywhere we wanted in Macedonia, not only in Ljuboten. From\n\n16 what I see here, James Pardew didn't say anywhere that NLA is a terrorist\n\n17 organisation.\n\n18 Q. Well, we will come to that in a minute. But at this stage you\n\n19 will recall that I showed a document where NATO officers had expressed the\n\n20 same view, namely that you were trying to provoke incidents involving the\n\n21 Macedonian forces to bolster the support of your organisation. Do you\n\n22 remember that document?\n\n23 A. I remember that document, but it is their own statement. We have\n\n24 quite different strategies and that is why we had the successes we had in\n\n25 fact.\n\nPage 5755\n\n1 Q. Well, we will put this document aside, the Senate record, and we\n\n2 come back do it in a minute but I'll show you another document in the\n\n3 meantime. That is Rule 65 ter 1D688 and it has an ERN 1D00-6053.\n\n4 Mr. Bushi, this is again a document in English. This one is a\n\n5 report from a renowned military magazine called Jane's Intelligence Digest\n\n6 and it is from the 1st of February of 2001 and there are several parts of\n\n7 this document I would like to read to you.\n\n8 If the registry could go to the second part of the page. Thank\n\n9 you very much.\n\n10 The assessment of this review, Mr. Bushi, about what was going on\n\n11 in Macedonia, in particular and in the Balkans in general was as\n\n12 follows: \"Current events in the Balkans indicate that Jane's Intelligence\n\n13 Digest oft-repeated warnings of an escalating series of regional conflicts\n\n14 are proving accurate. In a space of a week ethnic Albanian terrorists\n\n15 have launched an attack on a Macedonian police station, 2.000 Kosovar\n\n16 Albanians have been fighting with KFOR troops in Mitrovica and there has\n\n17 been a serious upsurge in the conflict between the Serbia forces and\n\n18 ethnic Albanians in southern Serbia.\"\n\n19 Then it goes on to say: \"All of these incidents have a common\n\n20 root, radical Albanian nationalism.\"\n\n21 I will ask the registry to turn to the next page, please, and to\n\n22 focus on paragraph which starts with the words: \"The low-level attacks.\"\n\n23 The magazine goes on to say that: \"The low-level attacks against\n\n24 the Macedonian police which began last year are supposedly the work of the\n\n25 so-called liberation army, four of whom have been arrested. Ethnic\n\nPage 5756\n\n1 Albanians make up an estimated 25 to 35 per cent of Macedonia's population\n\n2 of 2 million and are settled predominantly in the west of the country.\n\n3 \"The Macedonian Albanians currently have a tense but generally\n\n4 productive relationship with the government in Skopje. Prime minister\n\n5 Ljupco Georgievski's coalition government includes an ethnic Albanian\n\n6 party among its partners. Many observers suggest that the Macedonian\n\n7 Albanian leadership is willing to wait for a generation before pressing\n\n8 their demands for independence. This is because of the Albanian's higher\n\n9 birth rate would provide them with an increasing democratic advantage as\n\n10 this century progresses.\"\n\n11 And if we can turn to the next page, please.\n\n12 The piece goes on to say: \"At present KLA terrorism in Macedonia\n\n13 is still a relatively minor issue just as it was in Kosovo from 1995 to\n\n14 1998. The KLA started its activities by attacking Serbian police\n\n15 patrols. However, the ultimate aim is to provoke the authority into\n\n16 making a military response which will serve to unite the ethnic Albanian\n\n17 minority in western Macedonia.\"\n\n18 Mr. Bushi, there again you will agree that this magazine and its\n\n19 authors have also taken the view shared by members of the US Senate that\n\n20 is what you were up to, what you were doing with your activities was to\n\n21 seek to lure the local authorities, in particular the security forces, to\n\n22 respond to your attacks with a view to attract sympathy for your\n\n23 organisation and I will add that did you that in complete disregard for\n\n24 the well-being of the citizens, whether Albanians or Macedonians.\n\n25 Do you agree with that?\n\nPage 5757\n\n1 A. No, I do not agree with that, sir. You know that when the Tetovo\n\n2 University was opened by the Albanians with their own funds, the\n\n3 Macedonian police killed a student for the sole reason that he wanted to\n\n4 learn in his own mother tongue as the other Macedonian citizens.\n\n5 What kind of provocation are you talking about, coming from what\n\n6 side? The actual situation in Macedonia and what these newspapers write\n\n7 is quite different. We have facts to prove that. If we want to speak on\n\n8 the basis of facts, let's do that. If we want to speak using statements\n\n9 such as these, we can write -- or you can write such statements every day.\n\n10 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, the Defence seeks to tender this\n\n11 document.\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: It will be received.\n\n13 THE REGISTRAR: As Exhibit 1D227, Your Honours.\n\n14 MR. METTRAUX: I'll ask the registry to go back to Rule 65 ter\n\n15 1D713. That is the Senate record of a hearing on the 13 of June of 2001.\n\n16 And I will ask the registry to turn to page 1D00-6291.\n\n17 If the registry could focus on the second half of the page,\n\n18 please.\n\n19 Q. I'm going read another passage, Mr. Bushi, of this record of the\n\n20 Senate of the US Senate about the situation in Macedonia and there is a\n\n21 question which is being asked of Ambassador Pardew by the chairman of the\n\n22 committee, which is senator called Joseph Biden, and he asked this:\n\n23 \"Let me begin, Mr. Ambassador, by asking you about something you\n\n24 directly -- you indirectly referenced but I would like to be more direct.\n\n25 What do you think is the proximate cause of the violence in Macedonia\n\nPage 5758\n\n1 now?\"\n\n2 And if one looks down further down in the text is the answer of\n\n3 Ambassador Pardew.\n\n4 JUDGE PARKER: Yes Mr. Apostolski.\n\n5 MR. APOSTOLSKI: [Interpretation] I apologise, Your Honours, but\n\n6 the accused are not receiving interpretation in the Macedonian language.\n\n7 Now it is all right.\n\n8 JUDGE PARKER: Thank you very much.\n\n9 MR. METTRAUX: I'm grateful again for the indication to\n\n10 Mr. Apostolski.\n\n11 Q. Mr. Bushi, I'll read to you the answer that Ambassador Pardew gave\n\n12 to the question of chairman Biden about what was the proximate cause of\n\n13 the violence in Macedonia and he said this:\n\n14 \"Senator, first of all let me start with the situation back before\n\n15 February. The Macedonian government was in a dialogue with its Albanian\n\n16 minority community which is substantial. The estimates range from 25 per\n\n17 cent to 35 per cent of the population is ethnic Albanian. They were in a\n\n18 dialogue. They had brought them into the government in many areas, but\n\n19 that dialogue continued because their record in dealing with the rights of\n\n20 their minority citizen was not perfect.\n\n21 \"Beginning in February while most of everyone's attention was\n\n22 focussed on southern Serbia and the insurgency that was ongoing there, a\n\n23 group of extremists - exactly whether they were Macedonia originated in\n\n24 Kosovo is not quite clear - began to form and to take military action\n\n25 against the government forces in north-west Macedonia.\"\n\nPage 5759\n\n1 Mr. Bushi, you will agree that when you and your colleague took up\n\n2 arms against the state purportedly to defend certain rights or human\n\n3 rights of people you claim to represent, those very issues were in fact\n\n4 being dealt with by the democratically elected authorities. Do you agree\n\n5 with that?\n\n6 A. No, I do not, because these issues were not treated in a\n\n7 democratic way. Had that happened in reality the war of 2001 would not\n\n8 have happened. As I said earlier, the Macedonian political class imposed\n\n9 this war on us. At that time we were represented by 25 to 35 per cent, as\n\n10 it is said in the document, I wouldn't have said maybe 35 per cent, as I\n\n11 pointed earlier, until 2001 in the police forces --\n\n12 THE INTERPRETER: The interpreter didn't hear the percentage of\n\n13 the Albanian representation.\n\n14 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] And can you tell me now out of this\n\n15 percentage in representation of Albanians, where do you see this equality\n\n16 and what representation do you have in mind? Can you point a concrete\n\n17 case of a fair representation of the Albanians which would be 15 per cent,\n\n18 16 or 70 [as interpreted] per cent. Menduh Thaci started to negotiate\n\n19 with his partner Ljupco Georgievski and they had no political agendas\n\n20 during their mandate. They only had their private business agendas and\n\n21 time will prove this true. There was a demand for an Albanian university\n\n22 at the time.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Bushi, you asked for percentages and I will give you some in a\n\n24 minute but at this stage you indicated that because they were not treated\n\n25 in that democratic way, are you suggesting that the election by free\n\nPage 5760\n\n1 citizen of representatives of the political party which they choose of the\n\n2 ethnicity of the party which they choose and the involvement of ethnic\n\n3 Albanian ministers and parties in the government is not a democratic\n\n4 route. Is that what you are saying?\n\n5 A. Now I will tell you why I'm saying this.\n\n6 The Albanian democratic party did not win the election at that\n\n7 time. The PPD won the elections. However, Ljupco Georgievski took for\n\n8 his partner Menduh Thaci. The same thing happened on the year of 2006 on\n\n9 the 5th of July when the BDI won the majority of votes, the democracy says\n\n10 that the people should decide on who will represent them in the assembly.\n\n11 Q. Mr. Bushi -- [Previous translation continues] ...\n\n12 A. I apologise, but I did not finish. Let me finish with my answer,\n\n13 please.\n\n14 Q. Mr. Bushi, is your evidence that what you did --\n\n15 A. Would you allow me to finish my answer, sir. I only have two or\n\n16 three more words.\n\n17 JUDGE PARKER: Your answer, please finish, Mr. Bushi, but it is a\n\n18 very long answer and you're ranging well beyond the question, but please\n\n19 give your answer on this occasion.\n\n20 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I will try to be as\n\n21 short as possible and within the context.\n\n22 The same thing is happening nowadays. The PPD is in coalition\n\n23 with the VMRO-DPMNE and I don't know how well-informed you are with the\n\n24 current political situation in Macedonia. I thank you and sorry for\n\n25 taking so much time.\n\nPage 5761\n\n1 MR. METTRAUX:\n\n2 Q. And just one last question before the break. From your response,\n\n3 Mr. Bushi, on the stand what you didn't like in the democratic party is\n\n4 that the representatives or the people who represented the interests of\n\n5 the Albanian people in parliament and governments were not to your liking,\n\n6 not of the people of Albanian ethnicity in Macedonia. Is that correct?\n\n7 A. No, it's not what we will choose but those who will be chosen by\n\n8 the people should represent their people, not those who are chosen by\n\n9 individuals.\n\n10 THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter's correction, page 34, line 2: PPD\n\n11 should be replaced with PDSH.\n\n12 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, I'm not sure whether you would wish to\n\n13 take the break at this stage or in view of the procedural matters, you\n\n14 prefer to continue.\n\n15 JUDGE PARKER: It is necessary I think to have the break now,\n\n16 Mr. Mettraux, and we resume at five minutes past 11.00.\n\n17 --- Recess taken at 10.33 a.m.\n\n18 --- On resuming at 11.07 a.m.\n\n19 JUDGE PARKER: Mr. Mettraux.\n\n20 MR. METTRAUX: Thank you very much, Your Honour.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Bushi, there are two more passages of the record of the\n\n22 Senate, the US Senate which I would like to bring to your attention. The\n\n23 first one is at page 1D00-6295.\n\n24 MR. METTRAUX: And if I could request the registry to go to the\n\n25 middle of the page, please.\n\nPage 5762\n\n1 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I will read out to you is a further assessment by\n\n2 Ambassador Pardew, the US envoy to Macedonia in 2001, about what was going\n\n3 on in the country and in particular what the Macedonian government at the\n\n4 time was trying to do.\n\n5 And it says this: \"The Macedonian government was working in an\n\n6 open -- in an ongoing dialogue with the Albanian community at the time\n\n7 this fighting broke out. That process was not moving rapidly enough in\n\n8 either our view or in the view of the Albanian community. I think this\n\n9 conflict has heightened the awareness of the government that they do need\n\n10 to take actions here. There are any numbers of inequities in terms of\n\n11 Albanian participation in the institution of government, the police force,\n\n12 the military, their access to resource, their cultural identity, language\n\n13 and so forth. Those issues are on the table in the discussions that are\n\n14 going on now with the legitimate and accepted political parties that the\n\n15 Macedonian government has been dealing with all along.\"\n\n16 Isn't that the truth, Mr. Bushi, that at the time when you took up\n\n17 arm under the pretense of defending or promoting the human rights of the\n\n18 Albanian community in Macedonia, those issues were dealt with by the\n\n19 government perhaps not rapidly enough but all of them were on the table\n\n20 being dealt with democratically. Do you agree with that?\n\n21 A. No, I don't agree with that, because of the following:\n\n22 Had these demands been on the table of discussions between the\n\n23 Macedonian and Albanian parties, Isli -- Isni Thaci, the member of the\n\n24 Albanian democratic party, would not have left the parliament but instead\n\n25 he did and he joined the ranks of the NLA.\n\nPage 5763\n\n1 Q. Well, let me ask you this, then. Isn't the truth that you were\n\n2 not willing to wait for the democratic process to follow its course but\n\n3 what you really wanted was power for yourself and your organisation. Do\n\n4 you agree with that?\n\n5 A. That is not true. We no longer trusted the Macedonian\n\n6 institutions since from 1991 there was no progress in the issue of the\n\n7 Albanians being treated equally with the Macedonians.\n\n8 Q. Well, let me read to you another statement of Mr. Pardew what he\n\n9 says about the goals, the true goals and purposes of your organisation.\n\n10 That's the previous page of that document. That's 1D00-6292.\n\n11 Mr. Bushi, Ambassador Pardew was asked by a senator about the\n\n12 goals and purpose of your organisation and that is what he said: \"Senator,\n\n13 at its most basic level, I think the objectives of these people who are\n\n14 running this insurgency are personal power for themselves and they are\n\n15 pretty flexible on what they would accept. I think some of them would\n\n16 like to see this romantic notion of a greater Albania but that is probably\n\n17 a very small element. I think some of them would like to partition\n\n18 Macedonia, but at the end of the day I think they are seeking greater\n\n19 political influence inside the Albanian community both in Macedonia and in\n\n20 Kosovo.\"\n\n21 Mr. Bushi, isn't that the truth what your organisation is all\n\n22 about is to get power for yourself through the use of violence. Do you\n\n23 agree with that?\n\n24 A. No, this is not true. I don't agree with that. And when you\n\n25 speak about division of Macedonia, sir, the prime minister at that time\n\nPage 5764\n\n1 Ljupco Georgievski, came up with a proposal for division of Macedonia and\n\n2 our political representative Ali Ahmeti did not agree with that proposal\n\n3 and Ljupco Georgievski is coming up with a similar proposal even nowadays.\n\n4 Q. Well, let's stick with the goals and purposes of your organisation\n\n5 for the moment.\n\n6 You will recall that you told my colleague that what you were\n\n7 allegedly seeking through the activities of your organisation was greater\n\n8 representation of the Albanian minority in public and official positions.\n\n9 Do you recall telling me that?\n\n10 A. This is true.\n\n11 Q. Sir, in the year 2001, can you tell this Chamber how many Albanian\n\n12 ministers were in the government at that time?\n\n13 A. I would say four. But representation should not be looked as --\n\n14 to the level of the assembly. There was no similar representation in the\n\n15 institutions. If you're familiar with the process of the formation of the\n\n16 government in Macedonia, you should know that this is an agreement between\n\n17 the members of the parliament discussing certain issues on the table.\n\n18 What is important is the representation in institutions. Even in those\n\n19 ministries which were headed by Albanian there were no Albanian employees.\n\n20 Q. Well, let's take one institution at the time. I was not talking\n\n21 about the parliament at this stage, Mr. Bushi, but in fact there were not\n\n22 four, there were five Albanian ministers in the government at the time.\n\n23 Do you agree with that?\n\n24 A. I agree.\n\n25 Q. And the government of Macedonia at the time was made of 14, 1-4,\n\nPage 5765\n\n1 ministers. Is that correct?\n\n2 A. I don't remember the exact number but it should be more or less\n\n3 that figure.\n\n4 Q. You would agree that there was more than a third of ministers of\n\n5 Albanian ethnicity at that time. Do you agree with that?\n\n6 A. Yes. However, as I said, you cannot speak of a representation of\n\n7 Albanians only through five ministers in the government. Within Macedonia\n\n8 there are many institutions and at that time the representation in this\n\n9 institutions was 1 to 2 per cent.\n\n10 Q. Well, let's stick with the government for a bit longer.\n\n11 Do you know how many deputy ministers were of Albanian ethnicity\n\n12 at that time?\n\n13 A. Let's say four or five or three. I don't remember exactly.\n\n14 Q. Well, there were four. And, again, four out of 14. So that is a\n\n15 bit less than a third this time. Is that correct?\n\n16 A. Yes.\n\n17 Q. And one of them was the deputy minister of the Ministry of\n\n18 Interior. Is that correct?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. That's Mr. Refet Elmazi. Is that correct?\n\n21 A. Yes. Who nowadays beats MPs in the Macedonian assembly.\n\n22 Q. Would you agree Mr. Bushi, that as far as the government of\n\n23 Macedonia is concerned and as far as the year 2001 is concerned, there was\n\n24 adequate representation of the ethnic Albanian minority in the\n\n25 government. Do you agree with that?\n\nPage 5766\n\n1 A. Sir, I don't agree. There are 700.000 or 800.000 Albanians in\n\n2 Macedonia and you cannot speak of a fair representation of Albanians by a\n\n3 number of five or six deputies. If you speak of a proportionate\n\n4 representation which will be in line with the number of the -- percentage\n\n5 of the population, 25 or 26, then I would agree. If we speak about the\n\n6 Ministry of Defence, for example, when there are 8.000 or 9.000 officers,\n\n7 when -- or 10.000, 12.000 officers, and if you compare it to 80 or 90\n\n8 officers, then you in percentages would be 1 or 2 per cent. That's why\n\n9 I'm saying cannot speak of fair representation of the Albanians from 2001\n\n10 we still haven't reached the just representation but there has been a\n\n11 progress.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Bushi, can you answer my question about the government. Would\n\n13 you agree that the representation of the ethnic minority, Albanian ethnic\n\n14 minority was in line or in fact perhaps even superior to the democratic\n\n15 percentage -- demographic, I should say, percentage of the Albanian\n\n16 community in Macedonia. Do you agree with that?\n\n17 A. No, I don't agree with that and I don't know which formula you're\n\n18 using to come up with these figures.\n\n19 Q. Well, perhaps I should ask you this, Mr. Bushi: How many\n\n20 ministers or what percentage of ministers or MPs or other public offices\n\n21 would satisfy your organisation that is there a fair representation of the\n\n22 ethnic Albanian community? What percentage is acceptable to your\n\n23 organisation?\n\n24 A. For us, I'm not speaking now about MPs. This should be based on\n\n25 the vote of the people. It with be 3, 10, 20, 30, depends on the turnout\n\nPage 5767\n\n1 of the population in the voting. But for ministers, for example, this is\n\n2 again an agreement between the governmental parties.\n\n3 Q. [Previous translation continues] ...\n\n4 A. I did not finish. And I please ask you to let me finish my\n\n5 answer. You asked me about the ministries. For us it is not important.\n\n6 You can have one minister in the government. For us it is important to\n\n7 have an equal representation in the Macedonian institution, for example,\n\n8 to have Albanians employed in the public administration, in the army, in\n\n9 the police, in the judicial system and other ministries. So we are all\n\n10 seeking just a representation that we rightfully deserve, according to the\n\n11 statistics of the population.\n\n12 Q. Well, Mr. Bushi, I agree with you. There was a democratic process\n\n13 in place at that time in Macedonia, and in fact the citizens of the\n\n14 Republic of Macedonia have made use of that democratic process by voting\n\n15 for certain parties to represent their interests in the parliament of the\n\n16 Republic of Macedonia. And I'm going ask you this: Do you know how many\n\n17 ethnic Albanians were members of the parliament of the republic in the\n\n18 year 2001. Do you know that?\n\n19 A. To my knowledge, 25.\n\n20 Q. Well, that's absolutely correct, Mr. Bushi. There were two\n\n21 Albanian parties, which made together 21 ethnic Albanians and four ethnic\n\n22 Albanian independent. And can you tell perhaps this Chamber as well how\n\n23 many members there were in the parliament in the year of 2001?\n\n24 A. I want to make a correction. 21 were Albanians. There are two\n\n25 political parties and no independent candidates. 14 members came from the\n\nPage 5768\n\n1 party for democratic prosperity while the 11 others came from the party --\n\n2 democratic party of the Albanians while the Macedonian assembly numbered\n\n3 120 MPs at the time.\n\n4 Q. That's right. There were 120 MPs at the time and there were 25\n\n5 ethnic Albanian in the parliament at that time. You would agree that it\n\n6 is slightly superior to about 20 per cent of the voting population. Is\n\n7 that correct?\n\n8 A. On the basis of the number of MPs yes.\n\n9 Q. And you agree, Mr. Bushi, that the ethnic Albanian community at\n\n10 the time was able to vote for the party which they thought best\n\n11 represented their interests and they so did. Would you agree with that?\n\n12 A. I agree.\n\n13 Q. And would you also agree with that, Mr. Bushi, that today in\n\n14 parliament there is still the same number approximately of representatives\n\n15 of the Albanian community and there is only one slight difference in the\n\n16 representation of this community is that you and your party have now\n\n17 grabbed a bit of power by getting a number of your men in parliament. Do\n\n18 you agree with that?\n\n19 A. No. The only difference here is that we won the parliamentary\n\n20 election of 5th July, 2006 with 11 deputies, while the party which is the\n\n21 ruling party with the VRMO-DPMNE has 18 members.\n\n22 What is going on with Macedonia is totally different from the\n\n23 situation in 2006 and 2007. As a result of the government coalition, the\n\n24 [indiscernible], BDI Macedonia won the candidate status country for\n\n25 integration in the EU and NATO structures, but now Gruevski liked Menduh\n\nPage 5769\n\n1 Thaci as an individual and what they are doing is creating a political\n\n2 crisis in Macedonia.\n\n3 Q. Well, let's put that in simple terms, Mr. Bushi. Do you agree\n\n4 today there is the same number of ethnic Albanian ministers in government\n\n5 as there was in 2001. Do you agree with that?\n\n6 A. The number of ministers is the same but the employees in\n\n7 institutions, this number differs. In the Ministry of Interior today you\n\n8 have 17 or 18 per cent. In the army, again, the same percentage. In\n\n9 other institutions as well, in the judicial system, in the courts. So the\n\n10 number has reached a difference from 2001. But the number cannot be the\n\n11 same now with the one compared to five years ago. As I said earlier, you\n\n12 cannot look at the representation with a number of ministers in the\n\n13 ministry. You should look at this with the number of representations in\n\n14 the institutions. The number of deputies MPs in the parliament, on this\n\n15 number it is the population who decides, not Ali Ahmeti or Gruevski. It's\n\n16 the population who chooses the number of MPs that will represent them.\n\n17 Q. And isn't the case, Mr. Bushi, that when you say that the current\n\n18 government is creating a political crisis in Macedonia, you are doing\n\n19 nothing else than what the leader of your political party, the former\n\n20 leader of your organisation Mr. Ahmeti said in parliament a few months ago\n\n21 is that he would bring back 2001 if you and your party didn't get your\n\n22 way, and by that he meant a big sharing of power with his political\n\n23 party. Is that what you're telling?\n\n24 THE INTERPRETER: Interpreters kindly ask the witness to slow\n\n25 down.\n\nPage 5770\n\n1 A. It's not Ali Ahmeti who wants this. It is the population that\n\n2 decided on this. They voted on the 5th of July and they entrusted the BDI\n\n3 to represent the demands of the Albanian before the Macedonian assembly.\n\n4 Today the BDI has 15 mayors starting from Struga up to Kumanovo.\n\n5 MR. METTRAUX:\n\n6 Q. So we can agree on one thing, Mr. Bushi, is that what you care\n\n7 about is the interest of your political party and your organisation, not\n\n8 the interest of the Albanian people. Do we agree on that?\n\n9 A. This is not true, sir. As I said earlier, people voted on 5th of\n\n10 July and they trusted their vote to Ali Ahmeti and the BDI won the\n\n11 majority of the votes to represent the Albanians in the assembly.\n\n12 Q. Didn't the BDI, sir, get 13 seats in the parliament, which is\n\n13 about 10 per cent of the voting population. Isn't that what happened?\n\n14 A. That was not the case. The 5th of July election resulted in BDI\n\n15 having 18 members, PDSH 11 members.\n\n16 Q. And several of the elected member of your political party later\n\n17 left your party, disgruntled by your politics, is that right, so now\n\n18 you're down to 13 seats. Isn't that correct, Mr. Bushi?\n\n19 A. It is not correct that we have 13. We have 16 members, sir, but\n\n20 this happens in the parliament of Macedonia because someone is offered\n\n21 means, opportunities, business opportunities and for this reason they vote\n\n22 some, but the majority of the Albanian population gave the vote to the BDI\n\n23 on the 5th of July, and that's a fact.\n\n24 Q. Well you've also mentioned the mayors and claim to have 13 mayors\n\n25 within your ranks. Do you know how many ethnic Albanian mayors there was\n\nPage 5771\n\n1 in --\n\n2 A. No. I said 15. I didn't say 13. I said 15.\n\n3 Q. Going back to the year of 2001 when you and your group took on the\n\n4 states through violence for the alleged purpose of promoting the position\n\n5 of the Albanian ethnic community in Macedonia, do you know how many ethnic\n\n6 Albanians were mayors in the country at the time?\n\n7 A. I don't know the accurate number, but there were mayors of some\n\n8 villages with the exception of Tetov and Gostivar. I don't know the exact\n\n9 number.\n\n10 Q. Well, would 26 out of 123 be about right, Mr. Bushi?\n\n11 A. It may be true, but in 2004 the electoral code was abandoned. So\n\n12 if there were 123 communes at that time, now the number is about 70 or\n\n13 80. I'm not sure. There is a change, actually, that with the amendment\n\n14 made to the self-governing authorities, the borders, the borders of the\n\n15 municipalities have changed. So in Skopje we have Izmet Mexheti, the\n\n16 chairman of the commune of Cair, that of Strumerko [phoen].\n\n17 Q. The point that I'm taking to is slightly different. I don't think\n\n18 we need to go into the detail of local laws at this stage.\n\n19 But what I'm putting to you is that in 2001 when you took up arms\n\n20 allegedly to help the ethnic minority get a greater representation in the\n\n21 state, there were more than 20 per cent of the mayors which is another\n\n22 elected position in Macedonia which were held by members of that community\n\n23 which corresponds, more or less, to the demographics of the country.\n\n24 Would you agree with that?\n\n25 A. Yes. We are talking of commune chairmen but not all their rights\n\nPage 5772\n\n1 and powers that they had in 2001 and the amendment of the electoral and\n\n2 the local governing which, after the Ohrid Framework Agreement had -- were\n\n3 given greater powers in the context of the decentralisation of central\n\n4 power and to the local power. We cannot talk of the rights of the\n\n5 chairmen of communes rights which they had from 2001 onwards because the\n\n6 change is major in the sphere of the powers and competencies of the\n\n7 commune chairmen.\n\n8 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, before I move on to another document I\n\n9 seek to tender Rule 65 ter 1D713. This is the record of the hearing\n\n10 before the committee on foreign relation of the United States of America.\n\n11 It is dated 13 of June, 2001.\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: It will be received.\n\n13 THE REGISTRAR: As Exhibit 1D228, Your Honours.\n\n14 MR. METTRAUX:\n\n15 Q. Isn't the truth this, Mr. Bushi, is that you and your organisation\n\n16 were never willing or ready to play the democratic game and you bullied\n\n17 every person, Albanian or Macedonian, who dared to disagree with your\n\n18 agenda. Do you agree with that?\n\n19 A. No, it is not true, sir.\n\n20 MR. METTRAUX: Could the witness please be shown 1D158, please.\n\n21 It is N005-7408 for the Macedonian translation.\n\n22 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'm about to show you is a document which I think\n\n23 you have on your screen in the Macedonian language. This is a summary of\n\n24 security related intelligence. This was gathered by the Ministry of\n\n25 Interior of the Republic of Macedonia and more specifically by the\n\nPage 5773\n\n1 administration for security and counter-intelligence, the UBK, and it is\n\n2 dated the 19th of March of 2001.\n\n3 I'd like to draw your attention to the second paragraph in that\n\n4 document. I will read it out to you.\n\n5 It says this: \"We were informed that the leaders of the newly\n\n6 established NDPA party of Kastriot Hajisheksa [phoen] are exerting\n\n7 tremendous pressure in the parliament upon Arben Xhaferi and the followers\n\n8 of the DPA to withdraw from the government. Similar pressure is also\n\n9 being exerted by the Albanian emigrees in western Europe and the USA.\n\n10 Their aim to provoke a political crisis in Macedonian.\"\n\n11 And further down in the text the UBK says the following: \"The\n\n12 services source from the BPA informed us that the BPA leadership is being\n\n13 pressured to withdraw from the government.\"\n\n14 Is that correct, Mr. Bushi, that you and your colleagues from the\n\n15 NLA were putting pressure, including physical threats, upon the\n\n16 democratically elected of the Albanian community for them to leave the\n\n17 government and thus create a crisis in the country. Do you agree with\n\n18 that?\n\n19 A. No, I do not agree with that, sir. Show me one example of a\n\n20 member being beaten or killed.\n\n21 Q. Well, I'll show you another example, Mr. Bushi. Is that correct\n\n22 that in May of 2001 a grand coalition of political parties which included\n\n23 all major political parties including two Albanian political parties\n\n24 formed a new coalition government. Are you aware of that?\n\n25 A. Yes. Yes, extended coalition. I know that.\n\nPage 5774\n\n1 Q. And the purpose of that grand coalition, Mr. Bushi, was to try to\n\n2 deal with the issues which you claimed justified your violence and your\n\n3 insurgency. Is that correct that was the goal of this coalition?\n\n4 A. I don't know what the goal of that coalition was. I just know\n\n5 that it was extended or a grand coalition.\n\n6 Q. But what you will know for certain, Mr. Bushi, is that you and\n\n7 your colleagues did not stop attacking security forces or cleansing\n\n8 villages and areas from citizens. You continued with your activities. Is\n\n9 that correct?\n\n10 A. Yes, we continued with our activities, that's correct.\n\n11 Q. And your activities, Mr. Bushi, were essentially to provoke the\n\n12 Macedonian forces, kill and maim civilians and representative of the\n\n13 authorities and members of the security forces. Those were your\n\n14 activities. Is that right, Mr. Bushi?\n\n15 A. Our activities were dealing directly with the Macedonian police\n\n16 and army forces but not against the civilians. We have a fact during the\n\n17 war in Karadak area, we had hostage taken by the Macedonian army and the\n\n18 civilian before the Ohrid Framework Agreement was signed, they were\n\n19 released to go home, and we had our rules and I mentioned that earlier on\n\n20 the first day of my testimony here. At the centre for training, when we\n\n21 clearly indicated to the soldiers that no hostage, either military or\n\n22 civilian, could be killed. And that nobody should shoot at the civilian\n\n23 population.\n\n24 Q. Well, we will come to your rules and compliance therewith. But\n\n25 isn't the truth, Mr. Bushi, that the way in which your organisation was\n\nPage 5775\n\n1 promoting, you say, the human rights and position of the Albanian minority\n\n2 in Macedonia at the time was by blowing up convoys of army, shooting and\n\n3 executing members of the security forces. That's how you advanced your\n\n4 agenda. Is that correct?\n\n5 A. Yes, it was a conflict.\n\n6 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, I'd ask that the witness be shown Rule\n\n7 65 ter 1D712. It has been shown already on Wednesday and I will ask the\n\n8 registry to go to page 1D00-6272.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'm about to show you is the same document\n\n10 prepared by the human rights organisation the Balkan human rights which is\n\n11 associated with the Helsinki committee and there's a number of matter of\n\n12 relevance to this case which they highlight in this report. And I would\n\n13 like to bring to your attention one particular part of this report or\n\n14 collection of information and it relates to the NLA against new government\n\n15 in Macedonia. And I will read that out to you. There is no Macedonian.\n\n16 \"The Albanian guerillas of the National Liberation Army, NLA, in\n\n17 Macedonia said Tuesday that the new government of national unity would\n\n18 only continue the bloodshed and destructions and that negotiation with the\n\n19 NLA are the only hope to end the crisis in the country.\"\n\n20 I'll stop there for a minute, Mr. Bushi. Isn't the truth that all\n\n21 you were interested in again was to be involved yourself, not the Albanian\n\n22 community, but yourself and your colleague into that process and that you\n\n23 did not give the Macedonian government a chance to achieve any of the\n\n24 goals which you say you were pursuing. Do you agree with that?\n\n25 A. No, I do not agree with that. It is not true.\n\nPage 5776\n\n1 Q. And then there's a comment which is attributed to one of your\n\n2 colleague, another so-called brigade commander, Mr. Sokoli and he says\n\n3 this: \"Any kind of government that it is created with the cooperation\n\n4 between the EU without the inclusion of the NLA would only continue the\n\n5 bloodshed causing even more damage.\"\n\n6 Isn't this, Mr. Bushi, a direct threat from your colleague\n\n7 Mr. Sokoli that they would not stop until that time when you would become\n\n8 part of the matter? Is that what he's telling here?\n\n9 A. This is not true. At that time we did demanded to have contacts\n\n10 with the political parties for them to uphold or demands, until the Ohrid\n\n11 Agreement was signed.\n\n12 Q. Mr. Sokoli goes on to say this: \"According to Sokoli it is not\n\n13 time for governments of unity but it is time for Macedonian authorities\n\n14 and NLA to sit at the table and negotiate. If it has come to this crisis,\n\n15 then the initiators of the crisis should sit down, the Macedonian party on\n\n16 one side, that is shelling the Albanian villages and the Albanian party on\n\n17 the other side that are protecting the villages, Sokoli said.\"\n\n18 But what Sokoli said, with respect, Mr. Bushi, is nonsense because\n\n19 that is precisely what was happening at the time, wasn't it? All\n\n20 democratically represented political parties, Albanian and Macedonian,\n\n21 were sitting at the same table to try to improve the situation of the\n\n22 minority in Macedonia. Isn't that right?\n\n23 A. Are you talking now about the Ohrid Agreement, sir, the talks\n\n24 which led to that agreement?\n\n25 Q. No, Mr. Bushi. I'm talking about the new government that was set\n\nPage 5777\n\n1 up in May of 2001 with a grand coalition including the two Macedonian\n\n2 Albanian political party represented in parliament at the time.\n\n3 A. Yes. But for us, it was unacceptable until we realise our goals,\n\n4 the amending of the preamble in the constitution and the realisation of\n\n5 the demands put forward by the NLA.\n\n6 Q. And Commander Sokoli goes on to say that: \"Commander Sokoli\n\n7 harshly criticised two Albanian parties with influence in Macedonia,\n\n8 meaning the democratic party of Albanians DPA and the party for democratic\n\n9 prosperity PDP. According to Sokoli after the recent crisis in the\n\n10 Kumanovo region, these parties do not represent the Albanian population in\n\n11 Macedonia anymore.\" And he says this: \"It is not possible that a\n\n12 political party such as the PPD or the DPA fails to raise its voice\n\n13 against the shelling to continue representing the interests of the\n\n14 Albanian population.\"\n\n15 But, in fact, Mr. Bushi, what was happening at that time is that\n\n16 you were bringing that onto the people who you claim you were represented\n\n17 [sic]. When new government was set up in May of 2001, you refused to play\n\n18 the democratic game and lay down arms. Isn't that the case?\n\n19 A. On the 14th of February, there were no political parties until the\n\n20 26th of September until the Ohrid Agreement.\n\n21 Q. [Previous translation continues] ... Mr. Bushi, weren't there --\n\n22 A. [Previous translation continues] ... democratic games were being\n\n23 played.\n\n24 Q. -- two political parties represented in the parliament all through\n\n25 the year of 2001 and from May the 12th or the 14th of 2001, those two\n\nPage 5778\n\n1 political parties were also represented in the government. Isn't that the\n\n2 case, Mr. Bushi?\n\n3 A. They were in the government, but they were no longer our\n\n4 representatives because by that time we had our own institutions, the\n\n5 General Staff, the brigades, our political representative.\n\n6 Q. And when you are talking about \"our representative,\" you are\n\n7 talking about the representative of your terrorist organisation? Is that\n\n8 correct?\n\n9 A. I wouldn't call him terrorist but the army.\n\n10 Q. Well, that's what you call it to give it legitimacy, Mr. Bushi,\n\n11 but isn't the truth that the word at large - and by that I mean every\n\n12 state in this world and every international organisation - called you by\n\n13 two names. One was a terrorist organisation made of terrorists and the\n\n14 other one was an extremist organisation made of criminals. Is that how\n\n15 you were described at the time, Mr. Bushi?\n\n16 A. It is not true. I said earlier, I know that United Nations, the\n\n17 United States of America, NATO and others do not sit down to talk with\n\n18 terrorists. On this occasion they did sit down with us and discuss with\n\n19 all the open questions and we reached the Ohrid Framework Agreement. They\n\n20 became as a guarantor to this agreement, both NATO, the EU. We were a\n\n21 regular legitimate army for the Albanians with our uniforms and logo. We\n\n22 didn't commit any terrorist or criminal act.\n\n23 Q. What I'm putting to you, Mr. Bushi, is that in fact you fooled no\n\n24 one, that the international community at all time in 2001 did regard you\n\n25 as a terrorist organisation or an extremist organisation and actually\n\nPage 5779\n\n1 never sat with you to negotiate the Ohrid Agreement. The Ohrid Agreement\n\n2 was signed between all political party in the country at the time and the\n\n3 international community and the Macedonian authorities refused to sit with\n\n4 an organisation they considered to be criminal. Isn't that the case,\n\n5 Mr. Bushi?\n\n6 A. This is not the case. Everyday international representatives came\n\n7 to Ali Ahmeti to discuss the issue of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. It\n\n8 was not reached by the political parties but by the NLA which was\n\n9 presented then by the political parties that were involved in it.\n\n10 Q. Well, we'll come to the Ohrid Agreement and your alleged\n\n11 involvement therein at a later stage. But at this stage I'll ask that\n\n12 registry show Mr. Bushi Exhibit 45, Exhibit P45.\n\n13 Your Honour, this is the so-called \"White Book\" prepared by the\n\n14 Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Macedonia and it has been tendered\n\n15 by the Office of the Prosecutor and I would ask the registry to turn to\n\n16 page N005-7606-0171, and in the Macedonian this would be page N001-5212.\n\n17 Mr. Bushi, I will ask you to focus your attention on a part of the\n\n18 page which has a subheading saying: \"Terrorists must be defeated.\"\n\n19 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, this document the \"White Book\"\n\n20 contains a number of statements made by various political figures,\n\n21 including ambassadors, presidents and so on and they are reprinted in this\n\n22 document.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'd like to read to you is a statement made by\n\n24 Mr. Mark Dickenson who, at the time, was Great Britain's ambassador in\n\n25 Macedonia.\n\nPage 5780\n\n1 This is what he said: \"The terrorists do not take the advice of\n\n2 reasonable people because they themselves are not reasonable. It seems to\n\n3 me that what they really want is not what they say they want. In their\n\n4 communiques, one time they say they want a federalisation of the country;\n\n5 the other, they demand the status of a constituent nation. And the next\n\n6 time they would most probably demand that the Macedonian constitution must\n\n7 guarantee them the grand prize of the national lottery each week.\"\n\n8 Isn't that true, Mr. Bushi, that all through the crisis in 2001\n\n9 your organisation just kept on changing its alleged purposes with a view\n\n10 to attract support that you never had. Is that correct?\n\n11 A. It is not correct.\n\n12 MR. METTRAUX: Can the witness please be shown Rule 65 ter 1D320,\n\n13 please. That would not be the correct document. That would be Rule 65\n\n14 ter 1D320 and the ERN would be 1D00 dash -- I'm grateful. Thank you very\n\n15 much.\n\n16 Q. Mr. Bushi, what I'm going to show you is a statement of Mr. Peter\n\n17 Matthiesen, who you will recall was the military attache of the German\n\n18 embassy in Macedonia at the time.\n\n19 The Macedonian version of this statement is at 1D00-2966. And I\n\n20 ask the registry please to turn to page 18 of this statement. This would\n\n21 be paragraph 85, please.\n\n22 Mr. Bushi, Mr. Matthiesen was asked to give his view as military\n\n23 attache for the German embassy at the time of the goals and purpose of\n\n24 your organisation and that is what he told the Prosecution: \"The stated\n\n25 objective of the NLA was the demand for more political rights for the\n\nPage 5781\n\n1 Albanian minority. However, according to my assessment, the NLA were\n\n2 fighting for greater Albania. In this context, the travel by Mr. Ali\n\n3 Ahmeti to Kosovo just before the signing of the Ohrid accord must be\n\n4 viewed.\"\n\n5 Do you agree with that, Mr. Bushi, that in fact what you were\n\n6 aiming at was not more political right for the Albanian minority; what you\n\n7 were trying to achieve is to carve a bit of the territory out of\n\n8 Macedonia. That's what your grand goal was. Is that correct?\n\n9 A. No. This was not our goal. As I said earlier, this was the goal\n\n10 of Mr. Georgievski to divide Macedonia at the time but we as NLA did not\n\n11 accept that.\n\n12 Q. Well, perhaps you will tell me what symbol appears on the flag of\n\n13 your organisation, the so-called NLA, and also on the patches worn by your\n\n14 so-called soldiers. Can you tell this Chamber that appears on this flag\n\n15 and patches?\n\n16 A. On the uniform, we had the patch that all the Albanians have in\n\n17 the entire world. It's the eagle and the inscription, National Liberation\n\n18 Army, and Albanians they have one flag wherever they are in Montenegro, in\n\n19 Albania, in Macedonia in Kosovo, in Purisevo.\n\n20 Q. And, Mr. Bushi, that is the symbol as you indicated of the\n\n21 Albanian nation. . You were not fighting under the flag or with the\n\n22 patches of the Macedonian nation. Is that correct?\n\n23 A. Of course.\n\n24 MR. METTRAUX: Could the witness please be shown Exhibit P45,\n\n25 please. This time it would be at page N005-7606-0167. The Macedonian\n\nPage 5782\n\n1 version would be N001-5208.\n\n2 Q. Perhaps, Mr. Bushi, I should put this proposition to you: Would\n\n3 you agree that your actions in the year --\n\n4 A. I apologise. I don't have the Macedonian version before me.\n\n5 Q. I apologise. The Macedonian version would be at N001-5208.\n\n6 Mr. Bushi, would you agree that your actions and the actions of\n\n7 your organisation in the year of 2001 rather than promoting the rights and\n\n8 interests of the Albanian community in Macedonia, your action in fact\n\n9 undermined the rights of the people you claim to represent. Do you agree\n\n10 with that?\n\n11 A. No, I don't.\n\n12 Q. Well, I'll read to you what the President of the United States of\n\n13 America, President George Bush, said on the 21st of March 2001 about\n\n14 this. He said this: \"A small group of extremists determined to\n\n15 destabilize the democratic multi-ethnic government of Macedonia,\" that's\n\n16 how he described you. Then goes on to say: \"The United States and its\n\n17 allies have a long standed commitment to the sovereignty and territorial\n\n18 integrity of Macedonia.\"\n\n19 Then he adds: \"The insurgents in Macedonia claim to be advancing\n\n20 the cause of the Albanian minority. They are not. In fact their violent\n\n21 methods are hurting the long-term interests of ethnic Albanians in\n\n22 Macedonia, Kosovo and throughout the region. We support instead those\n\n23 political leaders in Macedonia and the region who have rejected violence\n\n24 and terror in favour of democracy and dialogue as a way to achieve\n\n25 political change.\"\n\nPage 5783\n\n1 Do you agree that this is in a few sentences this encapsulates the\n\n2 position of the international community at the time, Mr. Bushi, that your\n\n3 group of men were men of violence who did not want to play the democratic\n\n4 game and who did not represent the best interests of the Albanian\n\n5 community. Do you agree with that?\n\n6 A. I know the final position of the international factor and that is\n\n7 that they were the guarantor of the Ohrid Agreement. That was signed by\n\n8 the political parties but proposed by Ali Ahmeti.\n\n9 Q. But you also know, Mr. Bushi, that all through the year of 2001\n\n10 the international community in its entirety continued to view your\n\n11 organisation as a criminal organisation bent on destabilizing a democratic\n\n12 state. Do you agree with that?\n\n13 A. No, I don't, because of the fact that I had a meeting with a\n\n14 British captain in Nagustak village. To my knowledge, he was a member of\n\n15 NATO forces, of representatives of the US and Great Britain, and they do\n\n16 not speak with terrorists.\n\n17 Q. Well, let's look at Rule 65 ter 1D286. It has an ERN 1D00-2826.\n\n18 Mr. Bushi, again I apologise, this is in the English language\n\n19 only. This is a joint statement by President George W. Bush of the United\n\n20 States and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany on the occasion of a\n\n21 trans-atlantic vision for the 21st century. It is dated the 29th of March\n\n22 of 2001.\n\n23 I would like to draw your attention on to one particular statement\n\n24 with those two gentlemen made in that statement.\n\n25 They said this: \"Both our countries have long-standing\n\nPage 5784\n\n1 commitments to the territorial integrity of Macedonia. We strongly\n\n2 condemn the violence perpetrated by a small group of extremists trying to\n\n3 destabilise that country's democracy multi-ethnic government. Their\n\n4 violent methods are hurting the long-term interests of the ethnic\n\n5 Albanians in Macedonia, Kosovo and throughout the region.\n\n6 You would agree, Mr. Bushi, that again what President Bush and\n\n7 Chancellor Schroeder were saying is the same. They regarded you, the\n\n8 world regarded you as extremists, terrorists, criminals that would not\n\n9 play the democratic game and that did not serve the interests of your\n\n10 alleged supporters. Do you agree with that?\n\n11 A. Again, I will repeat. We were not terrorists or criminals. These\n\n12 could be in the beginning of the war when Mr. Thaci and his coalition\n\n13 partners, the former Prime Minister Ljupco Georgievski called us\n\n14 terrorists, but as time went by the entire policy changed and it ended up\n\n15 in signing of the Ohrid Agreement.\n\n16 I will repeat again: Had we been terrorists, the US would never\n\n17 sit and negotiate with us.\n\n18 Q. Well, we'll see what the US is calling you then. If the witness\n\n19 could be shown Rule 65 ter 1D233 and I would ask the registry to go to\n\n20 page 1D00-2542?\n\n21 Mr. Bushi, this document is a document that was prepared by the\n\n22 public prosecution of the Republic of Macedonia. It is dated the 20th of\n\n23 November of 2001. And it contains again compilation of certain statements\n\n24 made by a number of political figures in relation to the events in\n\n25 Macedonia at the time.\n\nPage 5785\n\n1 This one is from Mr. Colin Powell of the United States and it is\n\n2 dated not from the beginning of the crisis, as you said, but from the 13th\n\n3 of April of 2001.\n\n4 And this is what Mr. Powell said: \"The international community and\n\n5 the United States of America are deeply concerned about the terrorist acts\n\n6 in Macedonia and south Serbia.\" And then further down he says: \"Extremist\n\n7 groups are damaging the long-term interests of the ethnic Albanians in\n\n8 Macedonia and in Kosovo and in the whole region.\"\n\n9 And that again was the position of not only the US but of the\n\n10 entire international community at the time, wasn't it? They considered\n\n11 you, in the alternative, terrorists or extremists that used terrorist or\n\n12 criminal means to achieve their goals. Do you agree with that?\n\n13 A. No, I don't agree with that. The Macedonian government at that\n\n14 time portrayed us in this picture before the world. I will repeat again.\n\n15 If you have a fact or an example of a terrorist or criminal act carried\n\n16 out by us, please let me know which one it is.\n\n17 Q. Well, we'll come to those, Mr. Bushi, you can be concern of that.\n\n18 MR. METTRAUX: But at this stage I will ask that the registry\n\n19 should bring up Rule 65 ter 1D852. It is 1D00-7473, please.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Bushi, this is again in English only. This is a review -- a\n\n21 news review prepared by the United Nations interim administration mission\n\n22 in Kosovo, also known as UNMIK. And it is dated from the 9th of April of\n\n23 2001. There is no Macedonian or Albanian translation.\n\n24 Mr. Bushi, it should appear in a second on your screen and when it\n\n25 does I'd ask the registry to go to the second page of the document, which\n\nPage 5786\n\n1 would be 1D00-7474.\n\n2 First I'd like to tried a statement attributed to Mr. Alexander\n\n3 Prosko [phoen], the United States ambassador to the North Atlantic\n\n4 Council. He said this: \"Mr. Prosko spoke bluntly to the interim\n\n5 administration council members. No parallel existed between the\n\n6 experience of the Albanians in Kosovo over the past decade and those\n\n7 undergone in the FYROM, the Republic of Macedonia.\"\n\n8 It goes on: \"Donors would pose the question, why spend money on\n\n9 people who refuse to play by democratic rules,\" he said, speaking directly\n\n10 to the IAC Kosovar Albanian members, Prosko hammered home his point. The\n\n11 choice is yours, don't blow it.\"\n\n12 And then there's a passage about what Lord Robertson, then the\n\n13 Secretary-General of NATO said in the same form. He said this: \"Lord\n\n14 Robertson agreed that the situation for minority Albanians in FYROM was a\n\n15 million miles away from Milosevic's Kosovo. NATO intervened to save\n\n16 Kosovo and its people to build democracy and a multi-ethnic society,\n\n17 Robertson emphasised.\"\n\n18 And then there's a quote attributed to Mr. Robertson and he says\n\n19 this: \"We will continue to fight on exactly the same basis when a small\n\n20 country is put under threat by a bunch of armed gangsters.\" And then he\n\n21 likened your organisation, the NLA and its fighters, to Milosevic's\n\n22 thugs. Then Lord Robertson emphasised that the Kosovar leadership needed\n\n23 to demonstrate its bellwether attributes by ensuring the men of violence\n\n24 were marginalised and banished from the political process.\n\n25 Mr. Bushi wasn't that a fair summary of what the position of the\n\nPage 5787\n\n1 international community was at the time, that they considered you as what\n\n2 Mr. Robertson once said, \"a bunch of murderous thugs?\"\n\n3 A. Regardless of what we were called, I will repeat again, we were a\n\n4 regular army. When you speak of a multi- ethnic country, Macedonia did\n\n5 not have such a picture, after the first parliamentary election\n\n6 Macedonians started to call all these institutions Macedonian, Macedonian,\n\n7 TV, Macedonian parliament and so on.\n\n8 Q. Isn't that the truth, Mr. Bushi, that you the members of the\n\n9 so-called NLA were the only ones to regard yourself as an army. The rest\n\n10 of the world regarded you as murderous thugs. Do you agree with that?\n\n11 A. I wouldn't say that all called us so.\n\n12 Q. Well, for instance, to say of your cousins, so to say, would you\n\n13 agree that Albania and the Albanian government at the time considered you\n\n14 to be terrorists. Would you agree with that?\n\n15 A. No, I don't agree with that.\n\n16 MR. METTRAUX: Could the witness please be shown Rule 65 ter\n\n17 1D712, please.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Bushi, this is again the same summary of various reports which\n\n19 have been collected into this document by the Balkan human rights\n\n20 organisation, and I will ask the registry to go to page 1D00-6272. And I\n\n21 will ask the registry, please, to go to the last subheading on this page\n\n22 which starts with the word \"Meta.\" Thank you.\n\n23 I will read the passage to you. There's a subheading saying\n\n24 Meta: \"Albania will never favour terrorism or extremism.\" It\n\n25 says \"NATO's chief George Robertson and head of the European committee\n\nPage 5788\n\n1 Romano Prodi, received Albanian's prime minister Ilir Meta in Brielle.\n\n2 Robertson assessed the stand of the Albanian government as moderate in\n\n3 connection with the incidents in Macedonia. The Albanian prime minister\n\n4 ensured NATO's general secretary that the Albanian government would be\n\n5 consistent in its stand that it will serve the interests of Albania and\n\n6 stability in the region. After his meeting with Prodi, Meta said that\n\n7 Albania had never and will never favour terrorism or extremism in any\n\n8 form.\"\n\n9 And then he said this: \"We are doing or maximum to keep our\n\n10 borders with Macedonia under control,\" Meta said. \"We want to promote\n\n11 cooperation with all country in the region and we condemn extremism and\n\n12 extremists who think that they can solve problems using violence.\"\n\n13 \"We also expressed our full respect towards the territorial\n\n14 integrity of Macedonia and the sovereignty of Skopje' government.\" And\n\n15 then Meta also emphasised that Tirana has requested that the Macedonian\n\n16 government engages in making a concrete improvement of the conditions and\n\n17 rights of the Albanian minority by isolating extremists.\n\n18 And then Meta told the EU yesterday his government would not allow\n\n19 the country to become a base for ethnic Albanian rebels fighting in\n\n20 Macedonia. \"From Albanian territory,\" he said, \"There is no help that is\n\n21 going to the terrorists.\"\n\n22 Q. Were you aware of the position of the Albanian government at the\n\n23 time towards your organisation, Mr. Bushi?\n\n24 A. Sir, this is not an official document issued by the ministry of\n\n25 foreign affairs in Albania or the government of Albania. So I don't\n\nPage 5789\n\n1 accept that. It's not like you say.\n\n2 Q. Well, would you accept the same statement then if it came from an\n\n3 official United Nations government, Mr. Bushi?\n\n4 A. I have no comments on that.\n\n5 Q. Well, I'll show you Rule 65 ter 54 then. This is it ERN\n\n6 N000-N019.\n\n7 The Macedonian version would be N000-N019-MF.\n\n8 Mr. Bushi, this is an official document from the United Nations\n\n9 which we received through the Office of the Prosecutor. It is dated the 7\n\n10 March of 2001 and it is the record of a meeting of the Security Council of\n\n11 the United Nations and it also contains a presidential statement which\n\n12 condemns violence by ethnic Albanian extremists in the former Yugoslav\n\n13 Republic of Macedonia.\n\n14 I would first ask the registry to turn to the second page of that\n\n15 document. That would be N000-N020, please.\n\n16 And I'll just read to you one passage at this stage. It says\n\n17 this: \"In the ensuing discussion council members unanimously condemned\n\n18 the violence perpetrated by ethnic Albanian extremists affirmed the\n\n19 sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of\n\n20 Macedonia and commended that country's government for the restraint it had\n\n21 shown and for its plans to address the situation.\"\n\n22 Then I'll ask the registry to turn to page N000-N026, please.\n\n23 You will see, Mr. Bushi, that Albania at that time was in fact\n\n24 represented at the Security Council of the United Nations. And its\n\n25 representative at the time was a person called Agim Nesho.\n\nPage 5790\n\n1 I believe this would be a few further -- a few pages further down\n\n2 the line. That would be N000-N026. Thank you. And if I can ask the\n\n3 registry to focus on the bottom of the page, please. In particular, the\n\n4 last three line, please.\n\n5 Mr. Bushi, I will read to you what the representative of the state\n\n6 of Albania said before the Security Council of the United Nations. He\n\n7 said this: \"Albania was deeply concerned by the recent violence in this\n\n8 region. His government had repudiated and renounced the behaviour of the\n\n9 terrorist group. He commended the response of the government of the\n\n10 former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and was confident it would continue\n\n11 to show proper restraint and wisdom.\"\n\n12 And then the representative of Albania continues by\n\n13 saying, \"Albania supported efforts to solve ethnic Albanians problems in\n\n14 the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by constitutional means. In his\n\n15 view, acts of violence run contrary to the interests of Albanians and of\n\n16 ethnic Albanians political sector in Macedonia.\"\n\n17 He also said that this: \"It deprived all Albanians of the\n\n18 international support and sympathy that they had won during the war in\n\n19 Kosovo.\"\n\n20 Would you agree then, Mr. Bushi, based on this official document\n\n21 that the position of your neighbour, Albania, was to reject your group as\n\n22 a terrorist group and to reject the methods and means which you had chosen\n\n23 to achieve your alleged goals. Do you agree with that?\n\n24 A. I do not agree with that. It is not an official document of the\n\n25 Albanian ministry of foreign affairs or government.\n\nPage 5791\n\n1 MR. METTRAUX: If we can turn back to Rule 65 ter 1D712, please.\n\n2 I'll ask the registry to turn to page 1D00-6273.\n\n3 Q. Is that correct that this position, Mr. Bushi, the position of the\n\n4 Albanian government at that time that you were a terrorist outfit or an\n\n5 extremist outfit was shared by all other member states of the United\n\n6 Nations in 2001. Do you agree with that?\n\n7 A. It is not true.\n\n8 Q. Well, I'll read a statement attributed to President Bush of the\n\n9 United States once again.\n\n10 It says this: \"US President George W. Bush supports the efforts\n\n11 of the government of Macedonia to fight the extremists who have brought\n\n12 violence to the region, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told\n\n13 reporters.\n\n14 At least it shows you that that was the position of the United\n\n15 States, Mr. Bushi, that they considered you to be a terrorist or an\n\n16 extremist group. Do you agree?\n\n17 A. I didn't know, and maybe it was in the beginning, because the date\n\n18 was 7th of March. In the beginning, it might have been so. But I would\n\n19 want to see a document by the United States prior to the Ohrid Agreement\n\n20 where they called us terrorists or extremists.\n\n21 Q. I'm going to show you one then and it is dated the 30th of April\n\n22 of 2001. It is Rule 65 ter 1D818. It's 1D00-7180.\n\n23 Sir, again, there is no translation or interpretation --\n\n24 translation, I'm sorry, in either Albanian or Macedonian of this document.\n\n25 This is a record, semi-official record, from one of the US\n\nPage 5792\n\n1 government web sites about press briefing by this US State Department, and\n\n2 it is dated, as I mention, the 30th of April of 2001. And as you will\n\n3 see, the representative of the United States State Department was asked a\n\n4 number of questions about the situation in Macedonia at the time. And\n\n5 this particular press briefing dealt, in part, with an incident that took\n\n6 place in the town or village of Velce.\n\n7 Perhaps we go into this document, sir. Do you know what happened\n\n8 a view days before on the 29th of April in 2001 in Velce? Do you know\n\n9 what happened there?\n\n10 A. I said that I want to see a document of July/August. The date\n\n11 here is 30th of April.\n\n12 Q. Well, one step at a time, sir. We will stay with this one for a\n\n13 minute. But do you know --\n\n14 A. [In English] Okay.\n\n15 Q. Do you know what happened in Velce on the 28th or of April of\n\n16 2001?\n\n17 A. [Interpretation] In Velce.\n\n18 Q. That's right.\n\n19 A. No.\n\n20 Q. Well, you asked me before if I could ask you about crimes\n\n21 committed by your organisation. Perhaps you will remember that in Velce\n\n22 on the 28th or 29th of April of 2001 a group of -- or members of your\n\n23 organisation ambushed a military convoy at the time, just like your\n\n24 brigade did at Ljubotenski Bacila, and what they did at the time is to\n\n25 blow up the truck and execute and burn the survivors of this explosion.\n\nPage 5793\n\n1 Do you recall that incident?\n\n2 A. I do.\n\n3 Q. And you would agree, I hope, that the NLA that did that in Velce.\n\n4 Do you agree with that?\n\n5 A. This is what I have to say: What was done was done by NLA in\n\n6 Velce. But it was in the context of an armed conflict between the NLA and\n\n7 the Macedonian army, and everything that was committed when people were\n\n8 dressed in uniforms, we don't consider it as a terrorist act.\n\n9 The same applies to the Macedonian killing our forces. In the\n\n10 case of the civilian massacre against the civilian population in Ljubanci\n\n11 or in Tetovo, when a father and a son were killed by the Macedonian\n\n12 forces, this is an act of terrorism.\n\n13 Q. So, Mr. Bushi, if I understand you properly, burning or setting\n\n14 alight a person or shooting him at close range is all right if he wears a\n\n15 uniform of the Macedonian security forces. Is that correct?\n\n16 A. They were not burned. They were fired at, and it is something\n\n17 else what happened there. They were not set fire to.\n\n18 Q. Were you privy to the autopsy report about that particular\n\n19 incident, Mr. Bushi?\n\n20 A. No.\n\n21 Q. So you don't know whether they were burned or not, are you?\n\n22 A. I saw some photos, but it is not true that they were burned.\n\n23 Maybe they were shelled with nitroglycerin. This is something that causes\n\n24 burns, of course, when you use it.\n\n25 Q. I see. Well, let's see what the United States Department -- or\n\nPage 5794\n\n1 the State Department have to say about this. It is at page 1D00-7189.\n\n2 And there's a gentleman called Mr. Reeker who is the spokesman of the\n\n3 State Department, and he said this: \"I will just point out for those of\n\n4 you that missed it over the weekend, we did issue a statement on Saturday\n\n5 soundly condemning the attack on Macedonian security forces by armed\n\n6 ethnic Albanian extremists, and that statement obviously still stands.\n\n7 This was an ambush that extremists -- by extremists that resulted in the\n\n8 death of eight Macedonian soldiers. We want to extend our condolences to\n\n9 the families of those eight who were killed and to the entire country of\n\n10 Macedonia.\"\n\n11 Then he goes on to say this: \"We noted or have discussed that\n\n12 there has been a strong condemnation of that barbarious attack by the\n\n13 Macedonian Albanian political leader Arben Xhaferi.\"\n\n14 And I will stop there for a minute, Mr. Bushi. You have mentioned\n\n15 Mr. Xhaferi several times in your attack against him and his political\n\n16 party. Isn't that the truth, Mr. Bushi, that you didn't like Mr. Xhaferi\n\n17 so much--\n\n18 A. Yes.\n\n19 Q. -- because he, unlike you, was willing to go the democratic way and\n\n20 to deal with those issues which concerned his people in a democratic\n\n21 fashion. Is that why you didn't like Mr. Xhaferi and still don't like\n\n22 Mr. Xhaferi?\n\n23 A. We didn't like Mr. Xhaferi, not him personally but his political\n\n24 party, because it followed anti-Albanian policy. And it was a\n\n25 businesslike political policy. They discussed tobacco, coffee, alcohol\n\nPage 5795\n\n1 issues, and we have facts that prove that.\n\n2 Q. Well, just for the record, you'll confirm that Arben Xhaferi was\n\n3 an Albanian, right?\n\n4 A. Albanian.\n\n5 Q. Then Mr. Reeker goes on to say: \"We have encouraged other ethnic\n\n6 Albanian leaders to condemn this extremist violence as well.\"\n\n7 And then he goes on to say this: \"As you know, we very much\n\n8 support the necessary steps Macedonia is taking to prevent armed\n\n9 extremists from disrupting inter-ethnic cooperation and dialogue which has\n\n10 been taking place in Macedonia over the last few weeks. I think that it\n\n11 should be said that such violence and terrorist activity greatly arms the\n\n12 interests of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and throughout the region and\n\n13 those that are perpetrating this type of violence should realise this.\"\n\n14 Then later on he is asked another question, and he says\n\n15 this: \"For a decade now, as an independent country, Macedonia has in many\n\n16 ways been a model for how you can be a multi-ethnic country. That is not\n\n17 to say that there aren't problems there. Just as we and other country\n\n18 face these problems, so does Macedonia. The point to make is that the way\n\n19 to address this is through the political dialogue, and I think what we\n\n20 have seen is that they have taken that seriously.\"\n\n21 MR. METTRAUX: And then if the registry can turn the page, please,\n\n22 to 1D00-7190.\n\n23 Mr. Reeker continues to this: \"The violence that is perpetrated by\n\n24 this extreme extremist groups doesn't perpetuate that at all.\" He was\n\n25 talking of the interest of the Albanians. \"It makes the process more\n\nPage 5796\n\n1 difficult. It inflames passions. It makes the situation for ethnic\n\n2 Albanians in Macedonia and throughout the region more difficult as they\n\n3 pursue that.\n\n4 \"So you know very well we have been very supportive of Macedonia\n\n5 taking the necessary steps to prevent the armed extremists from disrupting\n\n6 inter-ethnic cooperation and the process of political dialogue which is\n\n7 under way there. And again, we think that those armed things, those\n\n8 terrorist acts which have occurred a tragedy which occurred again this\n\n9 weekend resulting in the loss of life simply makes the situation more\n\n10 difficult and does little to feed progress. And it makes the interests of\n\n11 ethnic Albanians throughout the region more difficult to look at in a\n\n12 serious light.\"\n\n13 Stopping for a minute there, would you agree, Mr. Bushi, that at\n\n14 least as far as the US state department was concerned, your activities\n\n15 which you say were legitimate combat activities against the Macedonian\n\n16 forces were regard in a rather different light by the international\n\n17 community? They called it terrorist acts. Do you agree with that?\n\n18 A. No, I don't agree. I don't know what they said at that particular\n\n19 moment. What I know is that the Macedonian police forces know -- knew\n\n20 that there was an army, there was a brigade 112 in that area of Velce and\n\n21 Tetovo and of course the conflict between armed forces cannot be called\n\n22 terrorist. Terrorist acts are those carried out against civilians. I\n\n23 mentioned the example of a father and a son killed on a street in Tetovo.\n\n24 You cannot compare these two cases. In Velce it was an action\n\n25 carried out by the NLA. I don't know what exactly happened. Let's\n\nPage 5797\n\n1 suppose that this took place but this was a conflict between two armed\n\n2 forces, not between an armed force and civilians. And I would repeat\n\n3 myself again: From 1991 to 2001, there was no political dialogue between\n\n4 the political party. The Albanian political parties in the parliament\n\n5 articulated their demands. But I will repeat here again: The war, the\n\n6 2001 war, was imposed on us by the Macedonian political class.\n\n7 Why they didn't care to represent fairly the Albanians in the\n\n8 institutions or to allow them to use their maternal language before the\n\n9 2001. How can you call Ali Ahmeti a terrorist when he is accepted by all\n\n10 countries in the world and they do talk to him and negotiate with him.\n\n11 MR. METTRAUX: Your Honour, would that be a convenient time?\n\n12 JUDGE PARKER: Very well. We resume at five past 1.00.\n\n13 --- Recess taken at 12.33 p.m.\n\n14 --- On resuming at 1.07 p.m.\n\n15 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n16 JUDGE PARKER: Yes, Mr. Mettraux.\n\n17 MR. METTRAUX: Thank you very much, Your Honour.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Bushi, do you recall that before the break you said that you\n\n19 were an army and that you were engaged in what you called a conflict or a\n\n20 war with the Macedonian authorities. Do you recall that?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. Would you agree that this army and this war that you were involved\n\n23 in with the Macedonian authority existed only in your mind and that of\n\n24 your colleagues and in no one else's mind. Do you agree with that?\n\n25 A. This is not true.\n\nPage 5798\n\n1 Q. Do you agree that as I showed to you earlier and as you well know,\n\n2 the international community as a whole continued to refer to your actions\n\n3 as terrorist acts, extremist actions or pure and simple criminal acts. Do\n\n4 you recall?\n\n5 A. What you're saying is not true.\n\n6 Q. And when you say that your so-called political leader, Mr. Ali\n\n7"
