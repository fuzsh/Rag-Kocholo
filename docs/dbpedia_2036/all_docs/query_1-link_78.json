        "text": "After a disastrous Euro 2000, the German public berated their ageing team, shook their heads at a vacuum of talent and wondered where the next generation of world-beaters would come from.\n\nBut just as England's failure in the lowlands was followed by enthusiastic hope for a new crop of young players, last night's 5-2 victory over Hungary in Budapest with a youthful, experimental side has caused German tabloids to announce that the former world champions are back.\n\n\"Rudi, now bring on England!\" roared the country's best-selling tabloid Bild. \"The 'Sebastian generation' is magic. And the strikers are finally scoring again!\"\n\n\"Even though Hungary was a weak opponent, ranked 54th in the world, our team hasn't had such a juicy, goal-filled win abroad for an eternity - a 5-1 win over Armenia in 1996,\" it continued.\n\n\"After this match we don't have to worry about the future of our team the way we did after the disaster of Euro 2000.\"\n\nGermany, lacking five regular choices, turned to youth to fill the gaps against Hungary, and found plenty of promise for the future.\n\nSebastian Deisler of Hertha Berlin and Sebastian Kehl of Freiburg, both 21 along with 22-year-old Gerald Asamoah of Schalke 04 all started, whileBorussia Dortmund defender Christian Metzender, 20, played the entire second half.\n\nDeisler, now with 14 international caps, is steadily becoming a permanent fixture just behind the strikers. He troubled the Hungarians all night, cleverly creating space for himself to provide chance after chance for the German strikers.\n\nAnd those German strikers, for a change, took their opportunities. Carsten Jancker, usually a substitute at Bayern Munich, headed in Germany's third, while Oliver Bierhoff, who is still without a club, added the final German goal after only six minutes on the pitch.\n\n\"It was a great game for an hour,\" claimed German manager Voeller. \"At the beginning we were a bit nervous, but then we got the ball rolling the way I knew we could.\n\n\"We were clearly stronger in midfield. Nevertheless, we were rather negligent in the final 20 minutes and would have been punished by a stronger opponent.\"\n\nBut Voeller had kind words for his strikers, adding: \"Jancker had a great match and Oliver Neuville needed a big game like this for the national team for his confidence. And I was especially happy for Bierhoff's goal.\""
