        "text": "DORTMUND: Borussia Dortmund are world soccer’s finishing school no longer.\n\nA club renowned for readying talented youngsters like Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland for the big stage are now on that stage itself, facing Real Madrid — and Bellingham — in the Champions League final Saturday.\n\nThis Dortmund team are different, though. They are built around older players making the most of second chances after career setbacks.\n\n“We have our own story,” coach Edin Terzic said Wednesday. “We have the story of ups and downs of the last years. We are one of the teams that is selling players by the end of the season. We are a team that builds up to compete every year, but now we are there, and we are facing teams that are built to win the Champions League.”\n\nAnd then there’s Jadon Sancho.\n\nThe former England national team forward has revived his career since rejoining Dortmund on loan in January from Manchester United, where he hadn’t played since August amid a rift with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe final at Wembley will be the last game of Sancho’s loan, but Dortmund hope they will also start fresh talks on keeping him.\n\n“We are so proud, we are so happy that he’s in our team at the moment and I can see his smile every day, I can see his performance on the pitch every day,” sporting director Sebastian Kehl said.\n\n“So, I think he will be very important for us on Saturday. He will show the world that Jadon Sancho is really back.”\n\nKehl said Dortmund plan “discussions” about the 24-year-old Sancho’s future, but only after Saturday’s game. “He’s still under contract with Man United, so nobody knows what’s going on there,” Kehl added. “We’re going to have discussions, but after the final.”\n\nSancho isn’t the only Dortmund player who has been rejected elsewhere. Defender Mats Hummels and midfielder Emre Can were both left out of the German national team squad for their home European Championship, and Sancho wasn’t picked for England.\n\nThe Champions League gives them the chance to show they remain competitive at the top level — and maybe even earn a dramatic recall for Euro 2024.\n\nThe 30-year-old Can suggested he and Sancho could be inspired by that rejection when they play against Madrid.\n\n“He’s not happy about it, of course. Me also, I’m not in the German squad, I’m not happy about it,” Can said. “Of course, it gives you maybe the extra motivation to show the coaches in national teams that we deserve to be there. That’s what we will try on Saturday.”\n\nOnly two Dortmund players made the Germany squad for Euro 2024, including striker Niclas Füllkrug, who spent much of his career in the second division before finally breaking through at 29 with Werder Bremen and making his national team debut in 2022.\n\nForward Sébastien Haller is in the Champions League final less than two years on from a diagnosis of testicular cancer which left him needing chemotherapy and surgery before he returned to action with Dortmund. He’s seeking his second trophy of the season after scoring the winning goal in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast in February.\n\nDortmund do have some promising young players, but winger Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and striker Youssoufa Moukoko, both 19-year-olds, have typically been on the bench in the Champions League this season and 21-year-old American Gio Reyna was loaned out to Nottingham Forest.\n\nThere isn’t an obvious successor to Bellingham, who was sold for up to 130 million euros ($139 million at the time) to Madrid last year, or Haaland, who earlier moved to Manchester City for 60 million euros ($63 million at the time) and won the Champions League last year.\n\nSporting director Kehl himself has unfinished business in the Champions League. Dortmund are in the final for the first time since 2013, when they lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich, also at Wembley. Kehl, then a midfielder, was on the bench in that game.\n\nDortmund are coming off their worst Bundesliga season in nine years with a fifth-place finish, but have shown in the Champions League that their grizzled, battle-scarred squad can peak in crucial games. There’s been a healthy dose of luck, too, after Dortmund survived Paris Saint-Germain repeatedly hitting the post and crossbar in the semifinals.\n\nA year after dropping the Bundesliga title in the final minutes of the season, Dortmund are aiming to end this campaign on a triumph.\n\n“There is one more game left and it’s the biggest game in European club competition,” Terzic said. “This is waiting for us, and we have to show that we are ready to go for it.”\n\nLONDON: This time, Manuel Akanji made no mistake from the penalty spot.\n\nAfter a 1-1 draw, Manchester City beat Manchester United 7-6 in a penalty shootout to win the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, with Akanji scoring the clinching penalty.\n\nThe Switzerland defender had different emotions after his last shootout — at the European Championship last month when he was the only player to not convert a penalty kick in a loss to England in the quarterfinals. On that occasion, Akanji took Switzerland’s first attempt.\n\n“I let the others shoot first,” Akanji said, “because obviously when you miss a penalty, you don’t go into the next one with that much confidence.”\n\nCity ended a run of three straight losses in the traditional curtain-raiser to the English soccer season, between the winners of last season’s Premier League (City) and FA Cup (United). Pep Guardiola’s team had been beaten by Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal over the past three years.\n\nAnd it goes some way to avenging the loss to United in the FA Cup final 77 days ago, when City were beaten 2-1 to miss out on another league-and-cup double.\n\nIt looked like United would be claiming another Wembley win over their neighbor when second-half substitute Alejandro Garnacho cut inside and drove a low shot inside the near post in the 82nd minute.\n\nCity equalized in the 89th when Bernardo Silva, also a substitute, headed in from Oscar Bobb’s cross.\n\nThe game went straight to penalties — there is no extra time in the Community Shield — and Silva saw his shot saved by Andre Onana off City’s first attempt.\n\nJadon Sancho failed off United’s fourth kick as Ederson tipped the shot onto the post. It was more penalty heartache for Sancho, who was one of three England players to miss in the shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.\n\nUnited defender Jonny Evans, the team’s eighth penalty-taker, chipped his effort over the crossbar to give Akanji the chance to win it for City.\n\nAgainst England in Dusseldorf, the center back placed his kick to his right and had it saved by Jordan Pickford, but this time he lifted it down the middle and under the bar.\n\nWhile United fielded a close-to-full-strength team, City were still without a raft of key players following the Euro 2024 final between Spain and England. Rodri, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and John Stones were all missing, while Kevin De Bruyne started on the bench and was a late substitute.\n\n“We’re happy to start the season in the way we have and obviously there’s a lot to come,” said Ruben Dias, who was City’s captain for the match. “It’s another trophy and we’re always happy to collect trophies. We’ve just had a long season and we still don’t have a full squad back but it is very good for us to start this way.”\n\nGuardiola has now won 18 trophies — including the Community Shield three times — since joining City in 2016.\n\nPARIS: It’s been a golden summer for Spanish soccer.\n\nLess than a month after winning the European Championship, Spain followed up with a thrilling 5-3 extra-time victory in the Olympic men’s final against France on Friday.\n\nSergio Camello’s two goals eventually settled an epic match in Spain’s favor after France fought back from 3-1 down to force extra time at Parc des Princes.\n\n“We are the happiest children in the world,” said Camello, who had come on as an 83rd-minute substitute and likely made himself a national icon.\n\nSpain’s coach Santi Denia said his players deserved to cry “tears of joy” after “such a long-suffering match.”\n\nLong-suffering for the players, maybe. But for anyone watching, it will live in the memory as a classic.\n\nFrance took an early lead through Enzo Millot but Spain replied with three goals in 10 minutes as Barcelona star Fermin Lopez Lopez struck twice and Alex Baena made it 3-1 in the 28th minute.\n\nRoared on by passionate home crowd, France mounted a late fightback in the second half after Maghnes Akliouche scored in the 79th. France pushed the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalized from the penalty spot in the 93rd minute.\n\nBut the momentum swung once again when Camello lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and he got his second when racing away from his own half in the first minute of time added on.\n\nThe forward tore off his shirt and was quickly swamped by teammates and substitutes, who piled onto the field from the touchline in frenzied celebrations.\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men’s soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nNot even during Spain’s dominant run of winning back-to-back Euros and the World Cup from 2008-2012, could it add to that sole Olympic gold.\n\nThat wait ended in Paris and underlined the power of Spanish soccer once again. Spain also won the under 19s European Championship last month — beating France in the final.\n\nThe Olympic victory marked a personal double for Lopez and Baena who were both part of the Euro 2024-winning squad.\n\n“What a summer. And I hope this summer never ends so we can continue winning,” Baena said. “I am very happy to have made history with Spain.”\n\nIt was another painful defeat in a final for a France team after losing on penalties to Argentina at the World Cup in 2022. Like then, the French players showed their resilience to battle back from a losing position and force extra time — only to fall short again.\n\nWhile Camello’s goals ultimately ended French hopes of a first Olympic gold since Los Angeles 1984, the crowd continued to cheer loudly as coach Thierry Henry and his players showed their appreciation with a lap of honor after the final whistle.\n\n“We tried to respond as best we could,” Henry said. “France is beautiful when we are all together, when we unite. It was a wonderful sight to see those flags, red, white and blue.\n\n“People from the get-go wanted to support us. We lost tonight, but they kept singing.”\n\nSpain’s victory ended the dominance of Latin American nations for the last five editions of the Olympics. Brazil and Argentina won twice in that time, with Mexico also taking gold.\n\nNigeria won at Atlanta 1996 and Cameroon at Sydney 2000.\n\nWomen’s soccer is also thriving in Spain after the national team won the World Cup last year. But it could not add to that success at the Olympics, with Spain’s women’s team losing 1-0 to Germany in the bronze medal match earlier on Friday.\n\nPARIS: Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men’s soccer final after a 5-3 win against France on Friday.\n\nThe thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer — following the senior team’s European Championship triumph last month.\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men’s soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nFrance came back from 3-1 down to send the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalized from the penalty spot in the third minute of time added on.\n\nBut substitute Camello coolly lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and got his second in the first minute of time added on.\n\nSpain’s victory marked a personal double for Fermin Lopez and Alex Baena, who were both part of the Euro 2024-winning squad.\n\nBarcelona star Lopez scored twice and Baena got Spain’s other goal in a blistering 10-minute spell in the first half which gave them a 3-1 lead at the break after Enzo Millot had opened the scoring for France.\n\nBut the game was turned on its head when France mounted a late fightback through Maghnes Akliouche and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who converted a penalty in the third minute of stoppage time to send the game to extra time.\n\nThe dramatic climax sent the home fans wild as they chanted “Alez Les Bleus” and roared their team on.\n\nAnd while Camello’s goals ultimately ended French hopes of a first gold since Los Angeles 1984 the crowd continued to cheer loudly as coach Thierry Henry and his players showed their appreciation with a lap of honor after the final whistle.\n\n“It was a crazy final, at the end we got a medal,” Henry said. “Unfortunately, we are not Olympic champions, but you can’t take anything away from this team.”\n\nCamello’s second goal, racing away from his own half before firing past Restes, sparked frenzied celebrations from the Spanish.\n\nThe forward tore off his shirt and was swamped by teammates and substitutes, who piled onto the field from the touchline.\n\nHe had only come as substitute in the 83rd as Spain tried to protect their lead in regulation — but ended up a national hero.\n\nSpain’s victory ended the dominance of Latin American nations for the last five editions of the Olympics. Brazil and Argentina won twice in that time, with Mexico also taking gold.\n\nNigeria won at Atlanta 1996 and Cameroon at Sydney 2000.\n\nRIYADH: The Saudi Arabian football season of 2024-2025 kicks off next week when last year’s top four finishers in the Roshn Saudi League compete for the Saudi Super Cup.\n\nThe traditional curtain-raiser of domestic football in the Kingdom, the Saudi Super Cup will see Al-Nassr, Al-Ahli, Al-Taawoun and domestic treble winners Al-Hilal competing for the prestigious trophy in Abha between Aug. 13 and 17.\n\nThe four clubs will compete for the honor at the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Stadium in the picturesque city of Abha for the first time.\n\nThis year’s tournament continues with the expanded four-team format introduced in 2023.\n\nThe semifinals will see Al-Hilal face Al-Ahli on Aug. 13, with Al-Nassr taking on Al-Taawoun the following day. The final is to be held at 7:15 p.m. Saudi time on Aug. 17.\n\nAl-Hilal, as treble winners last season, will be aiming to maintain their impressive form from the 2023-24 campaign which saw the Riyadh side, under Portuguese manager Jorge Jesus, secure their record 19th league title.\n\nPortugal’s Ruben Neves, Serbian duo Aleksandar Mitrovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and the returning Neymar are all set to feature in the season-opening competition.\n\nAl-Ahli, who are returning for their second top-flight season, will provide a tough test for last year’s champions as the Jeddah club aim to secure their first Super Cup victory since 2016.\n\nWith a strong pre-season behind them and featuring the return of international stars in Edouard Mendy, Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino, Al-Ahli will be difficult to beat.\n\nAl-Nassr, led by Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, will have their sights set on redemption going into the new season, after a dramatic penalty shoot-out defeat in the King Cup final ended a difficult campaign.\n\nWith new signing Brazilian goalkeeper Bento set to feature, the Riyadh side will be aiming to add to their two previous successes in the Saudi Super Cup.\n\nAl-Taawoun will look to replicate the fine form that saw the Buraydah outfit achieve an impressive fourth-place finish in the top flight. Led for the first time by new manager Rodolfo Arruabarrena, the side will aim to provide an early shock in the new season.\n\nThe Saudi Super Cup represents the start of a historic new season of domestic football in Saudi Arabia and is the first football tournament to take place in the Kingdom since the historic announcement of the country’s official bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.\n\nFor more information on how to purchase tickets for the Saudi Super Cup, visit: https://webook.com/en/saudi-super-cup-2024\n\nPARIS: Ann-Katrin Berger saved a last-minute penalty and Germany won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics with a 1-0 victory on Friday over Women’s World Cup winner Spain.\n\nBerger dove to stop Alexia Putellas’ penalty attempt in the ninth minute of stoppage time, then raised her hands in victory.\n\nPutellas — a two-time Ballon d’Or winner — was in tears as the match ended.\n\nGiulia Gwinn had converted a second-half penalty for Germany that proved to be the game winner.\n\nIt was Germany’s fourth bronze medal in women’s soccer at the Olympics. The Germans won the gold medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games but didn’t qualify for Tokyo three years ago.\n\nSpain, ranked No. 1 in the world after the World Cup win, were making their Olympics debut.\n\nGwinn, was fouled by Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll, confidently struck her penalty in the 64th minute after a scoreless first half.\n\nSpain’s Aitana Bonmati, the reigning women’s world player of the year, had the best chance in the opening half but her shot hit the crossbar.
