During Dortmund’s winter training camp in Marbella, he was immediately commanding in sessions designed to improve the team’s attacking structures. Sahin is no soft touch. He can be forthright with players and demanding when they do not meet his standards in drills. His coaching personality is different to Terzic’s in that respect, and changing the atmosphere around the first team is evidently part of Dortmund’s forward planning.\n\nThere is still some overlap, though. Like Terzic, Sahin was born locally. He grew up in Ludenscheid, which is 50km from Dortmund. His history with the club goes way back, too. He played for Jurgen Klopp between 2008 and 2011, but had been at the club since the age of 13.\n\nThis is no happy coincidence. Dortmund put great stock in their own and have great faith in people who have grown up inside the club. Lars Ricken is now the CEO for sport. Sebastian Kehl is the sporting director. Both were celebrated ex-players. Sahin is a third and that was a strong part of his candidacy.\n\nBut not more so than his performance. Alongside Sven Bender, another former player, who joined the coaching staff at the same time, Sahin’s effect on the standard of training has been widely praised by players. He was also credited as being the architect of the improved attacking football Dortmund played in the second half of last season, including the better moments that occurred during the run to the Champions League final.\n\nSahin’s only previous head coaching role was with Antalyaspor, so in a sense this represents a leap of faith. Nevertheless, he will take control with plenty of authority already established, and with much appreciation for work he has already completed.\n\n(Jurgen Fromme – firo sportphoto/Getty Images)"
