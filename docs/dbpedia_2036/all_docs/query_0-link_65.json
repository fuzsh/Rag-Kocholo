        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has confirmed the German club will attempt to keep hold of Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho in this summer's transfer window.\n\nSancho returned to his former club in the January transfer window, signing on loan for the remainder of the season. He had been axed from the first-team squad at Old Trafford after falling out with United manager Erik ten Hag back in September.\n\nHaving gone four months without kicking a ball, the 24-year-old was always going to require time to get back up to speed. After initially making a slow start to life back in Germany, he has rediscovered his form in recent weeks.\n\nREAD MORE: Three ways United could line-up without Bruno Fernandes vs Palace amid injury concern\n\nREAD MORE: David Beckham agrees with Jadon Sancho in message to Jude Bellingham\n\nHe was lauded after producing an eye-catching performance in Dortmund's 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. It prompted some United supporters to suggest he should be given a chance to rekindle his Old Trafford career.\n\nSancho is one of a whole host of players United will listen to offers for in the summer, with only four players understood to have been deemed untouchable. And if Dortmund have their way, they would love to be able to retain him beyond the end of this campaign.\n\nKehl told German news outlet Welt: \"We will try everything to keep Jadon Sancho here. But Manchester United also sees how well he is playing at the moment.\n\n\"Maybe they also want to sell him for profit or bring him back. We will see.\"\n\nSince returning to the Bundesliga club in January, Sancho has made 17 appearances, scoring three goals and registering two assists in all competitions. He was, however, an unused substitute in Saturday's 5-1 win over Augsburg.\n\nIt is highly likely Dortmund head coach Edin Terzic made that decision with half an eye on Tuesday night's second leg against PSG in France."
