As part of the reintegration, the bosses around young boss Lars Ricken and professional sports director Sebastian Kehl put their heads together about what should happen to Brunner in the future - on and off the pitch.\n\nAccording to BILD information, they then explained to their top talent that they would get involved socially as compensation and as a condition for a BVB comeback. A kind of compensation and educational measure.\n\nConsequence: Paris Brunner then spent a few hours in a daycare center in Dortmund. In the end, he is said to have really enjoyed his time with the children. He is now a welcome guest at the day care center and a kind of “godfather”.\n\nhttps://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/...sste-sozialstunden-leisten-87397122.bild.html\n\n-06 GK Schlieck signs pro contract. What's interesting about this pro contract is that usually Plastic Leipzig just posts text with 0 quotes but for him he got quotes!!!\n\nUNTIL 2027: PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT FOR TIMO SCHLIECK\n\nGoalkeeper talent will be awarded a professional contract for three and a half years | At RB Leipzig since 2021\n\nTimo Schlieck, who celebrated his 18th birthday last Saturday, has now received a professional contract until June 2027.\n\nSPORTS DIRECTOR ROUVEN SCHRÖDER\n\n“Timo Schlieck is a special goalkeeping talent who has been making his way at RB Leipzig since 2021. Timo has improved from year to year and, above all, has shown that he can hold his own against resistance - like after his knee injury at the beginning of 2023.\n\nHe has everything he needs to be able to sustainably assert himself in the professional field and that's why it quickly became clear to us that we now wanted to give him a professional contract! In addition to his size, what sets him apart is his ability to react and he is already at a very good level as a footballer.\n\nNow it's about continuing to develop for him. Timo's training with our professional team around goalkeeping coach Frederik Gößling as well as regular match practice in the U19 team until the summer will bring enormous progress.\"\n\nTimo Schlieck experienced a lot at a young age.\n\nWITH RBL AND U-NATIONAL GOALKEEPER SINCE 2021\n\nTimo Schlieck moved from Borussia Dortmund's youth ranks to the Red Bulls in July 2021 and immediately established himself as a U17 regular goalkeeper in his first season in Leipzig.\n\nOn September 2nd, 2021, he also celebrated his debut in the DFB U16 national team in a 3-3 draw against Austria. So far, Timo Schlieck has played a total of nine international matches.\n\nMENISCUS INJURY – COMEBACK IN NOVEMBER\n\nIn his second season at RB Leipzig, he played for the U19 as well as the U17, but had to undergo meniscus surgery in January 2023 and was therefore out for the second half of the season.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2023/24 season, the young goalkeeper was still working on his comeback before he returned to the posts as the U19's starting goalkeeper in November last year and has played every game over the full distance since then.\n\nPART OF THE PROFESSIONAL TEAM\n\nThe 1.95 m tall keeper was particularly able to shine in the UEFA Youth League play-off game against FC Midtjylland: in a penalty shootout, the 18-year-old parried the Danes' first shot and was therefore able to play a decisive role in ours Contribute to the round of 16.\n\nTimo Schlieck has been part of the extended professional squad since the 2022/23 season, was part of the training camp in La Manga (Spain) in January this year and trains regularly alongside Peter Gulácsi, Janis Blaswich and Leopold Zingerle under goalkeeping coach Frederik Gößling 1st team.\n\n-on 04 M Pavlovic\n\nNews #Pavlovic: Nagelsmann doesn't plan to call up the 19 y/o top talent for the upcoming matches against and . However, Nagelsmann continues to keep an eye on him…\n\n⚠️ But: Pavlovic will receive his first invitation for the German U21 national team, for the upcoming matches against Kosovo and Israel. Even though he could still play for the U20. U21 coach Di Salvo has scouted Pavlovic live several times, also against Lazio Roma.\n\nPavlovic is extremely happy and proud about it and definitely wants to accept the invitation to recommend himself for Nagelsmann\n\nThe Serbian Football Association is fighting hard to secure Pavlovic, whose parents are from Serbia. However, Pavlovic intends to play for Germany in the future!\n\n-03 CB Oermann of 1BL Bochum is back in team training and option for next match.\n\n-03 CB Riedel of 1BL Darmstadt is back on pitch in solo training\n\n-02 W Fehler looks on track to bailing in Summer from 2BL Kiel.\n\nhttps://www.liga-zwei.de/holstein-kiel-keine-chance-mehr-fuer-stanislav-fehler/\n\n-04 GK Kwasigroch of 2BL Hertha (has 1 XI this season) looking for Summer loan.\n\nhttps://www.kicker.de/hertha-bsc-plant-kwasigroch-leihe-4000000056469/transfermeldung\n\n-06 CB Dal of 1BL Mainz getting high praise by new coach and looks to be following Jeltsch and on verge of breakingthrough it seems.\n\nMaxim Dal was taken into the professional squad of 1. FSV Mainz 05 by coach Bo Henriksen on the last two match days. There has been no deployment to date, but that could change very soon.\n\n“He has a great future ahead of him,” said Henriksen, according to the Allgemeine Zeitung. The 18-year-old central defender will be there “and maybe even play” in the guest appearance at FC Bayern Munich (Saturday, 3:30 p.m.).\n\nHis Bundesliga debut almost came last weekend against Borussia Mönchengladbach (1-1), when Henriksen was about to substitute his left-footer because Dominik Kohr was sent off.\n\nPerhaps the U17 world and European champion will soon be able to gain his first experience in the men's field against Bayern.\n\nhttps://www.ligainsider.de/maxim-da...im-dal-winkt-spielzeit-gegen-muenchen-354063/\n\n-another U17 WC champ, 06 CB Herwerth\n\nVfB has signed Max Herwerth for the long term\n\nOur U17 world champion is staying with VfB and has extended his contract long-term.\n\nAs a younger player, Max Herwerth is in the central defense of the U19. He was in the starting line-up 16 times in the A-Junior Bundesliga. The 18-year-old only missed three games - and for a clear reason: In November, Max Herwerth traveled to Indonesia with the German U17 national team and returned as world champions. Now the Stuttgart native has extended his contract with VfB long-term. Max Herwerth has been wearing the jersey with the red chest ring since summer 2022; he previously worked for the Stuttgarter Kickers and the VfB cooperation club MTV Stuttgart. The 1.91 meter tall left-footer has already completed several training sessions with the professional team and was used by head coach Sebastian Hoeneß in the test games against SV Wehen Wiesbaden and SpVgg Greuther Fürth.\n\nNLZ director Stephan Hildebrandt:\n\n“We are pleased that Max has decided on the path we have shown and that we are looking forward to a long collaboration. He has an exciting package of physical and technical requirements that needs to be further developed in order to gradually introduce him to the demands of professional football.”\n\nMax Herwerth:\n\n“VfB offers young players top conditions to develop further. I would like to thank those responsible for the trust they have placed in me by extending my contract early. I would also like to thank all the trainers, supervisors and employees who have accompanied me on my journey so far. I will continue to work hard every day to improve step by step.”\n\n-on 04 M Pavlovic\n\n-on 02 CF Beier\n\n-04 W/CF Kabadayi who is on 2BL S04 loan is on the rise.\n\nhttps://www.kicker.de/schalke-neue-hoffnung-neue-hoffnungstraeger-1000730/artikel\n\n-03 DM/CB Paschke (from HSV, has trained/friendlies and even made pro bench) and 03 DM/RB Jessen (from Pauli, has trained/friendlies and even made pro bench) both moving to 3rd Liga Dortmund II in Summer.\n\nreality both Hamburg clubs are SHIITE at integration. HSV with Walter is basically make youth sign pro contracts and once they do they get axed from 1st team.....or Krahn/Kisilowski were making progress and they get axed for older flops......while Pauli is integrating NOBODY....and they want 06 RB/W Moreira to sign pro contract.......I'm sure after success of 02 M Roggow (like Jessen was Pauli 1st prospect) that's why they raided Pauli again.\n\nsaid it before but ex youth coaches who become pro coaches tend to do 0 integration......\n\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.de/doppel...und-hsver-paschke-zum-bvb-ii/view/news/434733\n\n-Germany U17 Squad for U17 Euro Qualifiers\n\nTorwart\n\nFlorian Hellstern VfB Stuttgart 6 0\n\nLeon Klanac FC Bayern München 3 0\n\nFeldspieler\n\nAbdoul Karim Coulibaly Hamburger SV 4 0\n\nMontrell Culbreath Bayer Leverkusen 9 3\n\nDenis Husser Hannover 96 8 2\n\nOwono Keumo VfL Bochum 7 0\n\nKacper Koscierski VfL Bochum 3 0\n\nAdin Licina FC Bayern München 5 1\n\nBoris Lum Hertha BSC 9 0\n\nTyler Louis Meiser Borussia Dortmund 5 0\n\nNaba Mensah Bayer Leverkusen 4 2\n\nTill Neininger VfL Wolfsburg 5 0\n\nCenny Neumann RB Leipzig 2 0\n\nBen Nink SV Wehen Wiesbaden 1 0\n\nFrancis Onyeka Bayer Leverkusen 6 4\n\nJuan Tiago Esteban Poller TSG Hoffenheim 5 1\n\nKilian Sauck Borussia Mönchengladbach 8 1\n\nMick Schmetgens Werder Bremen 7 0\n\nOtto Stange Hamburger SV 9 1\n\nNiklas Swider Borussia Mönchengladbach 8 1\n\nauf Abruf\n\nWesley Adeh Werder Bremen 2 0\n\nTrevor Benedict VfL Wolfsburg 0 0\n\nElias Benkara Borussia Dortmund 2 0\n\nTim Binder FC Bayern München 0 0\n\nFrancesco Buono Bayer Leverkusen 2 0\n\nFernando Dickes RB Leipzig 0 0\n\nLuca Erlein TSG Hoffenheim 0 0\n\nFritz Henri Fleck Borussia Dortmund 0 0\n\nEgor Greber Hertha BSC 1 0\n\nBen Hagmeyer 1.

U17 is easier to qualify then U19 so we should make it, already won v Portugal last month.\n\nalso Ernst+Schreiber going far in DFB Cup Knockouts, Schreiber is still active in that too.\n\neven Tresoldi is on the rise and attracting tons of interest from 1st divisions and top clubs after impressing in 2BL and being Called German-Italian Suarez by plenty too, same height too and has scored headers.\n\nthat's the thing, people tend to go subjectively and not objectively. I'm not a Draxler fan and some others too but back in the day when making list of pool would add them anyways. Others only go by what they like aka bias.\n\nreality player pool by position is pretty big for every position minus maybe RB, even that why not list Morgalla for example??? Koln and other clubs are super high on von der Hitz, S04 sees Bulut has pretty big talent, Bochum is super high on Koscierski already a pro contract pre-cursor and list goes on and on.\n\nyou also sometimes have the lesser rated players outperform the so called top talents too. As jump to pros won't be same for everyone.\n\nPavlovic is a good example tbh, his jump to Bayern 1st team is ONLY due to impressing Tuchel in training and then as injuries to others in 1st team happened he benefitted and brokethrough. But one can see in Bayern Academy that if Aseko wasnt always injured would have likely been ahead of him. NOBODY rated Pavlovic, DFB had him with 0 call ups prior to this season, was mostly in Bayern U19 for awhile, no fan thought 2-3 years ago this kid is gonna make it for realz, LOL.\n\nSerbia are stupid, usually other FAs go after EVERY single Bayern Academy youth in case they breakthrough Bayern, they would be their player. But Serbia lucky for us, ONLY showed interest in him when it was too late, LMAO.\n\nat end of day for me only thing that matters is pro progress and how ones does at pro. Whatever you do in youth=who cares. Impressing vs kids not same as adults. You ALWAYS see X or Y being highly rated but then falter at pros and this happens for every country in world. Looking good vs kids doesn't mean you'll manage to bring that potential out vs adults."
