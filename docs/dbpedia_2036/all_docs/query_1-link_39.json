        "text": "for all the crying about CFs, if one looks at 02-onwards from our rivals\n\n-Argentina=02-Simeone (La Liga, shrimp, has done nothing), 03-Veliz (La Liga loan from EPL, a not successful loan too), 04-Castro (Serie A, 1.79m tall too, has done nothing since Winter transfer)\n\nI don't see much hype for this lot. The Argentina hype is still towards 06-Ruberto who is still in Argentina. I don't know anything about Argentina footy so if there are more hype, what do I know, LOL.\n\n-Brazil=02-Jorge (Serie A), 05-Washington (EPL, his Chelski transfer=not panning out), 05-Roque (La Liga, shrimp), 06-Endrick (La Liga in Summer, shrimp)\n\nall the hype is on 06-Endrick+05-Roque. I do recall there was a 07 or 08 who also gets tons of hype but forgot his name, LOL.\n\n-Spain=02-Martin (La Liga 2 loan, breakout season), 03-Pascual (La Liga 2), 02-Azon (La Liga 2), 02-Karrikaburu (La Liga 2 loan), 03-Joseph (Championship, 2 countries, Pengland and Spain fighting over him and Spain won him and he's done NOTHING, LOL), 04-Omorodion (La Liga, breakout season), 04-Ferri (irregular at 1BL, good chance for loan dumping in Summer), 04-Barbera (Belgian 1st, a shrimp who struggling to breakthrough this level), 05-Bravo (\"La Liga\" more like HUGE FLOP who can't even impress in Real Madrid Youth, they want him out in Summer, LULZ, Bayer are LOSERS), 06-Guiu (La Liga but more irregular at Barca)\n\nproblem with hype for Spanish clowns is that most of their CFs get loads of hype for scoring a lot in YNT, Youth clubs, UEFA YL but once they get into pros they struggle to pan out in adult. And good chunk of this list is like 170s-early 180s in height too.\n\nso yeah from this list, I count like 5 who got SHIT TON of hype and only 1 Omorodion is even panning out at this point in time.\n\n-France=02-Antiste (Serie B loan),02-Kalimuendo (Ligue 1, in 170s), 02-Rutter (Championship, LOL, seems to be doing well there and his club going EPL promotion), 02-Mara (Championship, struggles to be XI, LOL), 02-Ekitike (1BL, rumor has it he's gonna get poached by Cameroon, LOL), 03-Abline (Ligue 1), 03-Wahi (Ligue 1), 03-Bonny (Serie B, club looking like Serie A Promotion), 05-Tel (1BL, more on him down).\n\nfor the French clowns, I'm ignoring Ligue 2.\n\nThey have ALMOST nothing in top 4 league outside of Ekitike+Tel. Although Rutter+Bonny looking like Promotion in Summer. And then one would assume that Kalimuendo+Wahi going upwards from Ligue 1.\n\nthe main problem with French is that EVERYONE listed is dual, LOL. This is gonna bite them in ass. As they know they can't all make it, how many will bail in future.\n\nfrom this lot who gets the hype\n\nKalimuendo, Rutter, Ekitike, Wahi, Tel........although one has to wait and see how they do once they leave Ligue 1 or go EPL 1st.\n\n-Netherlands=03-Ohio (Championship), 03-Emegha (Ligue 1),\n\nRest are in Eredivisie.. They got guys like 03-Sankoh, 02-Brobbey, 04-Zeefuik etc. 05-Rijkhoff is back in Netherlands too and most expect he'll breakthrough soon enough too.\n\nfeels like Brobbey+Rijkhoff are ones who get most hype. Although neither manage to breakthrough 1BL with Leipzig and Dortmund.\n\n-Portugal=02-Tomas (1BL, hasn't impressed), 04-Chermiti (EPL, getting more and more integration but only 1 XI. Can easily end up on loan dumping in Summer too.), 05-Semedo (on Eredivisie loan from Serie A, his loan isn't going that well)\n\nRest in Portugal.\n\n-Italy=02-Colombo (Serie A), 02-Di Stefano (Serie B), 02-Esposito (Serie B loan), 02-Bonfanti (Serie B Winter transfer, in 170s), 03-Nasti (Serie B loan, in 170s), 03-Abiuso (Serie B), 03-Ambrosino (Serie B loan), 04-Raimondo (Serie B loan, breakout season), 04-Crespi (Serie B, on loan), 05-Esposito (Serie B loan)\n\nItaly having issue of everyone dumping their CFs on loan to Serie B, LOL. Imagine 5 youth CFs on loan. We'd be lucky to find 1-2 on loan in 2BL when it comes to Germany, LOL.\n\nthe ones who tend to get most hype are 05-Esposito and 08-Camarda (has 2 Serie A caps with AC Milan, not listed above because not a regular)\n\n-Pengland=NONE in EPL, LOL. Like 8 players made debuts for EPL clubs, 4/8 went on loan doing NOTHING and the other 4 are good chance gonna get loan dumping in future. Looks bad when it comes to EPL.\n\nso Pengland relying on Championship like 02-Stansfield (breakout season), 02-Coburn, 03-Delap (the one who gets most hype), 03-Leonard, 05-Cadamarteri. Wonder how many will end up in EPL next season?\n\nI'm still waiting on troll poster to tell me, where are all the amazing world class CFs from our rivals. Where are the players taking top 4 league by storm......fact, Pengland, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands, France, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, who has a 1 player taking top 4 by storm. It feels like 04-Omorodion of Spain is only one with breakout season in top 4 league.\n\nin all our back and forth, he's ALWAYS refused to address the rivals topic. This clown loves to shit on German dev but I don't see much WOW from our rivals. Clown likes to highlight CFs from irrelevant countries. Focus on RIVAL Countries that's ONLY ones who matter.\n\nLOL from 7 Brazil-Argentina, 4/7 would be in the shrimp category too. Spain also has loads of not so tall. Italy have couple too.\n\non topic of Tel, for all he's one of biggest CF talent from 2005 Age Group in Europe....Bayern rarely plays him there more used at W, LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL. Imagine you got troll poster bitching about X or Y aren't CF when a so called one of best of his Age group in Europe also fits THIS, LMAOXINFINITY.\n\nLOL..... trash talk about other country's is all you clown can LOL. Like a little kid LOL..... Deine deutsche Talente werden einen Scheiss Dreck machen LOL. You're German \"talents\" will get ZERO integration in BL..... Just wait for it... NOBODY will see them in the big stage in a few years.... They are all technically bad... And thus is one of the reasons why BL still relies in foreign players LOL. The \"German\" CFs you mentiond... ( half of the get poached either way)... Are quality levels below other Nations LOL.. That's a fact.\n\nWhats the reason you'd think why BL integrates almost ZERO germans 05 onwards or even 04 onwards? Not even a handful... And even they are mostly \"ok\" talents.... No standouts. Other leagues including their top talents WAY sooner. And play WAY more often. LOL.\n\nWhy is that??? Because they are better!!!! German talents = zero integration.... And it will NEVER change LOL. Live with it LOL\n\nKeep dreaming and live in you're little own world LOL.\n\nwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\nfrom a ********tard loser waste of space.\n\ncrawl back to your hole you dipshit frog.\n\nPS I didn't read anything you posted,\n\nbut doesn't take a brain to know that your likely BITCHING HARD as usual, LMAO.\n\nSTFU, nobody cares about your dumbass opinion anyways. You are a French and Brazilian fan, go post about those players. Nobody wants to read your views on players you don't care about.\n\nYou've NEVER posted a single relevant post.\n\nImagine how retarded one has to be to sign up to a forum, then spends all of his time posting in threads he doesn't care about. WTF is the point.\n\nsaid it before and say it again, ALL THESE LOSERS like manimal they spend more time in these forum to shit on me than to actual discuss the topic, LOL.\n\nLOL, manimal's NON-EXISTANT logic\n\n\"I HATE German footy because there isn't any crazy explosive dribblers.\"\n\nOKAY who GIVES A SHIT, that's NOT even a good reason to hate any team. Follow another team and move the ******** on then............\n\n\"NOPE, I'll spend huge amount of time just to shit on them.\"\n\nthis guy is legit retarded. I dislike plenty of teams, don't waste much time to shit on them. More like jab here and there and that's it. This guy over and over in 3 different threads hijacks just to shit and like troll poster ALLLLLLLLLL of his posts are towards me in every thread. He's NOT interested in anybody else.\n\nto all you clowns nobody has to care about anything I say. But for some reason all of these guys are deranged obsessed fixated with me and my opinions. Its not hard to just ignore me. I don't speak for anyone. Make your own opinions, what do I care. And yes Manimal, troll poster etc, I don't give 2 shits about your dumbass opinions, so its 100% mutual.\n\nalways find it funny as ******** that over past 3-4 years, like 4 people have tried to push me to stop posting perm on these forum......but irony these 4 NONE of them even contribute and have almost never contributed anything. They just bitch react towards me, LOL.\n\nso explain to me if I stop posting, will these dumbasses even contribute? NOPE they won't because their postings are all related to me. So their plan is to kill this forum.\n\nhe's also a hypocrite.\n\n\"I have 0 problems with France being like 99% duals but Germans shouldn't play duals not even the 50% German descent.\"\n\nLOL\n\nalso a racist asshat\n\n\"Unlike plenty of you, I'm full German.\"\n\nTranslation this clown who doesn't even follow German NT, trashing the German dual and non-Germans on these boards who follow the German NT. Like WUT, LOL how retarted can you get.\n\nI would take every non-German who follows NT over a ********tard traitor like manimal who doesn't and goes for rivals to Germany, LOL frick off dipshit.\n\nI just gleamed over this.\n\n\"LOL you trigger nothing because you show all the time that you have ZERO knowledge about other Country's football and their talents LOL.\"\n\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\n\nYou have ZERO knowledge about Germans. You've shown over and over and over and over in the Dual thread, in the Euro 2024 thread and in this thread. You've shown you don't know SHIT about German youth or even older Germans too.\n\nI recall Alex exposing your ignorance about Germans in Euro thread, LMAO. I exposed your stupidity in dual thread. You were retarded enough to think that 05 CF Kuranyi was some big time CF and were celebrating that he might go Panama, LOL. Yeah what a HUGE blow to Germany, LOL.\n\neven in this thread, I've seen soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much retarded ignorant, dumbass, illogical, clearly doesn't watch much German footy postings.\n\nThese are the German boards, at end of day,\n\nWHAT DO I GAVE A SHIT ABOUT THE DEV OF ANY AND ALL NON-GERMANS??? I DON'T, LMAO.\n\nin fact when it comes to rivals, the more flop the better. I ain't gonna cry about non-German failure.\n\nyou think its possible to know the talents of every country in the world??? And also majority of talents across the world won't pan out anyways. So why waste much time on players from other countries who might or might not pan out.\n\nI've NEVER once claimed to be an expert in anything either. I'm neither a Germany expert nor a non-German expert.\n\nfor non-Germans, a lot of times, one has to go based on hype from media+fans. Not like I'm gonna watch EPL u18 or U23 or Championship and lower. Not like I'm gonna watch any Spanish footy etc.\n\nhow many matches do your stupid ass thinks one can watch anyways? German footy is more than enough.\n\nthis guy is legit stupid as ********.\n\n-same guy who cried and made HUGE FIT because I critized Brazil and their issues. Made it seem like I hate Brazil etc and wouldn't STFU about it too.\n\nso defensive when he's NOT even Brazilian too, LOL.And I never shat on Brazil at any point either. Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands, are countries, I've never shat on either.\n\nAnd he made the same claim as now \"You don't know anything about Brazil\" and what happened.....they flopped.........HARD.......\n\nthere are sooo many reasons why Brazil has been not great since 2002 but not the thread for it.\n\nI also recall this clown was hyping that Brazilian team that flopped, WC22 and how they will do well etc, LOL he's really bad at this.\n\n-bitches hard at one point to defend Pengland, he's NOT even a Pengland fan, LULZ. He's a pathetic France and Brazil Fangirl.\n\n-bitches hard a lot about any slight against France. Waaaaaaaaaaaaa go cry me a river you Frog lover, LOL. Frick France forever and ever!!!!\n\nat this point this clown will defend any country not called Germany, LOL.\n\nspeaking of Germany, this idiot\n\n-Every Germany fan=we are in Dark Times 2.0\n\nvs\n\n-Manimal=ah Germany lost, you suck, pathetic etc.\n\ndo you even know what Dark Times 2.0 means??? LOL How stupid can one be? Were you NOT alive during Dark Times 1.0.\n\nDark Times 2.0 which I predicted back in 2017 means the team will NOT perform and if they flop NOBODY will be surprised/shocked either.\n\nevery Germany W or D he goes invisible and every German L he comes from his hole to shit on Germany. He's nothing but a hypocrite.\n\nevery team has high and lows, his own Brazil hasn't won a WC since 2002 and only 1 Copa in 17 years but noooooooo only Germany has lows nobody else, LOL stupid.\n\nAll 3 countries Germany, Brazil, Italy has had struggles in recent times, Italy most with their numerous DNQ for tourneys. Spain too has had struggles in recent times too.\n\nis it coincidence that all the teams who have struggled are all the teams who are having CF issues???\n\nGermany, Brazil, Italy, Spain=4/4 with CF issues.\n\nNone have a Messi or Mbappe type that can singlenhandly win them tourneys or drag them to numerous finals. But Messi is sooon enough gonna be bye-bye.\n\nof course for CFs and dragging teams t9 final not talking about future players or still very young but a lot older. For Germany, the potential to eliminate our CF issue in future is there but its not gonna be NOW. For our players they still need time and likely most won't be ready for another 2-4 years MIN.\n\nPraise from Terzic and Kehl after professional debut\n\nIf only it weren't for the A-level exam: Wätjen even impresses Reus\n\nIn the shadow of Marco Reus' gala performance in Dortmund's 5-1 win against Augsburg, 18-year-old Kjell Wätjen made his professional debut. There was praise from all sides afterwards - including from the outgoing BVB icon.\n\nThe Westphalians had already made it clear publicly at the end of March that Borussia Dortmund thinks highly of Kjell Wätjen. The junior national player was given a professional contract until June 30, 2028. Sports director Sebastian Kehl said at the time that he saw the development of the midfield driver as \"far from over\".\n\nOn this Saturday afternoon, Wätjen took the next step up the career ladder. In the home game against Augsburg, he made his professional and Bundesliga debut. The 5-1 home victory against Augsburg, Dortmund's biggest win of the season, was a welcome start. BVB won all of their last six home games against the Fuggerstadt team. Despite the newly assembled team - Edin Terzic had made ten substitutions compared to the PSG game (only goalkeeper Gregor Kobel remained) - Dortmund combined smoothly and gave the opponent no chance at all. Wätjen, positioned in defensive midfield alongside Felix Nmecha, left his mark straight away: with a wonderful through ball from his own half, he sent the departing BVB icon Marco Reus on his way, who made it 4-1 before half-time.\n\n\"We've thrown him in now,\" Kehl said afterwards about Wätjen. \"He was a little nervous. But the way the team helped him, and the scenes he used to get into the game quickly, gave him confidence. He was involved in many transition moments and kept asking for balls and providing an assist. He had a lot of confidence in himself.\" The interaction with Nmecha \"worked very well.\" Kehl's conclusion: \"You can't have a better debut.\" Only one BVB trio sprints faster Wätjen, who played the whole game, was the Borussia player with the most running 11.45 kilometers, winning 57 percent of his duels and completing 89 percent of his passes. His remarkable speed was also noticeable: only Niklas Süle (33.0 km/h), Jamie Bynoe-Gittens (34.4 km/h) and Karim Adeyemi (35.4 km/h) sprinted faster than Wätjen (32.5 km/h) on Saturday.\n\n\"He had a lot of really good moments,\" said coach Terzic, praising the top talent who has been playing for BVB since the U10s. With a smile, Terzic added: \"Unfortunately, he won't be available to us on Tuesday. There's a simple reason for that: he's taking his A-levels then.\"\n\nWätjen has already been in Dortmund's Champions League squad four times - twice against Eindhoven (1:1, 2:0), in the return match against Atletico (4:2) and in the first match against PSG (1:0). Wätjen will be missing on Tuesday (9 p.m., LIVE! on kicker) in Paris. But the likelihood that he might experience the Champions League on the pitch next season has increased since Saturday. In the end, he even received an accolade from Reus, who raved about Wätjen's performance: \"Simply a brilliant footballer.\"\n\nhttps://www.kicker.de/wenn-nur-die-...begeistert-selbst-reus-1021855/artikel#twfeed\n\nso more gleaming and this clown's whole bitching is about integration.\n\nis he stupid? there is barely any integration even for foreign youth that come from German U19 clubs. The foreign youth who are getting integrated are like all players with pro experience.\n\ndoes your stupid ass not notice that 1BL clubs ALLLLLLL fight over any German youth who pans out in 2BL. It shows that issue is not talents but that these clubs are not keen on integrating 0 experience youth. The trend has been there for years, they will fight over youth German and non-Germans as long as someone else did the dev, LOL.\n\nalso our youth sell of peanut=less incentive to integrate when you can dev/sell foreign youth for like X4-5.\n\nsaid it before but too many A-Holes seem to assume to know anything about what I mean. Guys like troll poster and manimal always seem to assume to know anything about my points when their postings indicate otherwise. If you don't grasp my postings, don't read them, LOL.\n\nI know the methodology/thinking of every 1BL-2BL club in Germany. I even in past discussed the issue of integration for EVERY club too, LOL. Clowns like manimal think its same in every club etc, LOL.\n\na Loan for anyone isn't the end of world either. As long as it isn't 3rd Liga level and more 2BL-1st Abroad MIN. 1BL to 1BL loaning is rare too. What matters is game time and pro breakthrough. Its fineish. Sure the goal is direct integration and that's what we want to see but sadly most clubs don't operate like that even with top talents at their disposal.\n\nlike 05 M Ulrich for example has TONS of 2BL interest in loan including from clubs headed for 1BL. If he goes to 2BL does that mean he's terrible, LOL. No it doesn't, it just means that Stuttgart who will compete in CL next season is far more likely to go transfers over integration. And he as usual like too many German youth got derailed by injuries too.\n\nnext thing, clown manimal will tell us that every Serie A, La Liga, EPL club that loans out top talents to Serie B, La Liga 2, Championship or 1st Abroad that those youth are now all trash, LOL.\n\nalso known fact that Germans=full of late bloomers. Our current SNT has plenty of late bloomers and we beat France X2+Netherlands, LOL.\n\nat end of day, doesn't matter when someone makes 1BL......as long as they do......\n\nalso what's funny is that manimal actually looks to have gotten triggered by the Matanovic post, LOL. Didn't read what he wrote but that's what he quoted as a trigger.\n\nDamn are you this stupid to not realize that Matanovic doesn't have much hype outside Germany, more decent hype. Delap for example has SHIT TON more hype than him but Matanovic having better season and he's played less mins than Delap too, LOL.\n\nalso nothing I said was wrong, why wouldn't Matanovic make another U21 NT. Spain is calling 03 CF Joseph to U21 and that guy can barely score 1 goal in Championship, LOL. Italy calling up 1 Serie A and rest are from Serie B and none are having Matanovic season and list goes on and on. Be lazy and you'll see that Italy, Spain, Pengland etc all have players who aren't having better seasons than him and these are 2nd division players too.\n\nand failing to realize that Pengland sees Delap as their most promising 02-03 CF, more than that some think he could be most promising even outside of his age group too. While Matanovic bailed from Germany as easy way out. Pengland have CF issues when it comes to 98-03 as of now. And its looking like 04-05 are also having some issues. And duh, saying they looking like CF issues from 98-05 does NOT mean I'm saying none will pan out or whatever. So don't anyone come making shit up. The quest for next Kane is still ONGOING.\n\nnowhere did I say that Matanovic is better than every foreign youth CF mentioned.\n\nbut duh every YNT calls up players based on form and Matanovic is on form and 100% does have package+skill set that is well liked by coaches. And way he's playing, 1BL is gonna be next season on top of that which is top 4 league.\n\nalways funny when A-Hole Trolls none ever seem to grasp the satire or JABBING at other countries posts. I still recall troll poster used to take every post of mine seriously and got triggered even though posts are full of satire, parodies, ON PURPOSE JABBING towards other Nations. LMAO we GOT ANOTHER ONE who these things fly over there head and gets triggered by, LULZ. Like I keep saying imagine getting triggered by post while not even understanding them, LOL.\n\nIf one has to categorize the list I made from above\n\n-Players who get shit TON of hype=Moukoko, Pejcinovic, Weiper, Brunner, Moerstedt\n\n-Players who get pretty decent amount of hype=Beier, Woltemade, Matanovic (poached), Topp, Tresoldi\n\n-Players who get mostly domestic hype aka good enough to jump to relevant pros early=Scherhant (although Pengland clubs do seem to like him. Due to scoring on numerous of them in friendlies and impressing, LOL. Even scored against EPL from what I recall.), Asllani (poached), Gedikli (poached), Ansah, Downs, Copado, Mahmoud\n\nPS THIS IS NOT MY HYPE LIST.\n\nBut what I see from clubs, coaches, scouts, media, fans etc. The overall, so nobody come bitching towards me about this and that. Its also what looks like potential of players hype list too.\n\nWhat is important to note, is that in past there was never this amount of hype for much of anyone. The hype we used to get for realz was for 98-J.Eggestein and 00-Arp, these 2 would have been 1st category. But that was basically it. Both of those players are looking to be headed towards 1BL return next season as both of them their clubs are on track for 1BL Promotion. Both of these 2 players have had injury issues, clubs screwing them over or bad career choices and that is why they didn't live up to hype. But they still have chance to establish themselves at 1BL level. If we get late bloomers in a position, its almost always CFs, LOL. So they won't be huge but are still part of pool.\n\nthing is this, I always said that for CFs, it looks better from 98-onwards but more promising from 02-onwards. BUT doesn't mean I saw everyone as category 1. Like almost everyone from 98-01 are basically category 2-3 players MAX. But for next gen looking like potential hype wise, 04-onwards is where everyone looking to be at.\n\ncompare 2 players who got SHIT TON of hype from 98-01 vs 5 from 04-06..........4 age groups vs only 3.\n\nnow of course this means nothing in grand scheme of things.\n\nPlayers who have domestic hype only could surpass ones with much more hype. Also the more you explode and perform the more one can jump upwards in hype levels too. Time will tell. Although clear for anyone to see that Moukoko for example has 0 issues with 1BL and even with little game time is very productive in league. So its clear the potential is there for him as it is for the others.\n\nIgnoring U19-U17 players.\n\nif one focuses on 3rd Liga-RL CFs, we don't have any from there that would fit the 1st or 2nd category. Every CF in 3rd Liga-RL that is playing that level is more towards category 3rd, meaning there are numerous CFs who are well rated in Germany from those levels and who could jump to like 2BL in future but unlikely 1BL as direct jump. Quick Example of 04-Meier and 04-Ouro-Tagba from 3rd Liga. They are both well rated in Germany but that's as far as it goes, meaning they are category 3 only. The are others in RL too."
