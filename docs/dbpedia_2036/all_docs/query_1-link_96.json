        "text": "Despite Bellingham's impressive performances, there have been no new talks about his future.\n\nSpeaking with German tabloid Bild, Kehl said: \"Jude feels very, very comfortable at Borussia Dortmund. But there are no new talks, let alone any requests for him.\n\n\"We need Jude to achieve our goals this season and we're glad he is focused so much on football and has no other issues on his mind at the moment.\n\n\"Jude still has two years of contract and is a very important part of this team. That's why I naturally wish that he would play for BVB longer.\"\n\nReports suggest that Dortmund are willing to offer Bellingham a new contract to keep him at the club, which could make him their highest-paid player of all time.\n\nAlthough his current contract runs until 2025, Dortmund are ready to sell the teenager if he decides against penning the deal they put on the table.\n\nBellingham has been considering his options for some time, but he made it clear that no decision would be made until 2023. While Liverpool, Manchester City, and Real Madrid are reportedly interested, Dortmund are pushing for him to stay until at least 2024.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the young midfielder will end up, but for now, Dortmund are confident that they can hold onto one of their star players."
