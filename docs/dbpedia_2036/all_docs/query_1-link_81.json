        "text": "Borussia Dortmund's U23s have a history of top managers, think current Leeds United coach Daniel Farke, Norwich City manager David Wagner, former Augsburg coach Enno Maaßen, Germany U20s manager Hannes Wolf, and current Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic.\n\nThe U23's, along with SC Freiburg, are one of two Bundesliga teams whose leading academy team play in the third tier, the 3. Liga.\n\nIn 22/23 Dortmund's second team finished in 13th. A new coach joined and the side have risen to an impressive 5th position amassing 45 points from 29 games.\n\nThe architect of the success is former Eintracht Braunschweig striker and Hannover 96 coach Jan Zimmermann.\n\nIn an exclusive interview Jan Zimmermann speaks about his first year in post with Borussia Dortmund fanzine Schwatzgelb.de:\n\nYou have been in Dortmund for one year, how do you like it so far?\n\nJan Zimmermann: Really very well. I received an open and warm welcome from day one. It was really easy for me to get started here. And now we have also found our way in sporting terms and achieved results. Of course, that makes everything much easier. I feel very comfortable, and it was surprisingly quick getting settled in.\n\nWhat was your first thought when BVB contacted you?\n\nIt was exactly the direction I wanted to go in after my last job. At such a big club, I can develop further. That's why I found the opening attractive from the very first moment. When I got to know the team better and spoke to the sporting director of the U23s Ingo Preuß, and that of the first team Sebastian Kehl, I was quickly convinced that I would fit in well, and that I could help this team to be successful.\n\nWhat were your expectations? The U23s weren't exactly setting the world alight at the time:\n\nWell, it's always the fate of a coach who doesn't have a job that you always take over teams where things aren't going so well and in a season when you don't have that much time to make things happen. It was also the first time for me that I had to hit the ground running. I had a game at the weekend and only two training sessions before that. I was handicapped by my Achilles tendon rupture, and I couldn't drive. That was a lot to start with. Then we also lost the first two games, so the start was anything but easy. But I was convinced right from the start that I could be successful with the team. I also found a coaching team and staff here who were totally helpful and motivated - they made me even more convinced that this was going to work.\n\nHow is your injury now?\n\nIt's healed again, but it's not quite good yet. At least I can walk and drive again. But I'm missing kicking the ball. It's getting better from week to week.\n\nHow does it work when you come into a U23 team that's in crisis? Is the focus initially only on sporting results or do you immediately integrate talent development?\n\nWell, when you decide to coach an U23 team and then also at Borussia Dortmund, you know that it's all about winning games and being successful, the expectations are high at a club of this stature.\n\nThe team finished in eleventh in 22/23, how do you restore confidence in players who have not been successful for some time?\n\nBy instilling confidence. Training is not always just about doing exercises, but also about creating an exchange with the players, getting to know them and getting a feel for them. But it also means that the players get a feel for the coach, what the coach expects from them, what he wants and how he wants it. The most important thing is to give the players a space in which they feel comfortable, and in which they gain confidence in what you're trying to do. When you start winning games, that confidence naturally increases because the lads realize that what we work on during the week will also work on match day.\n\nHow long does it take to build up that level of confidence?\n\nThat's always a incremental development. For some it's quicker and for others it takes a little longer. Some players find it difficult because they may have had bad experiences before. Some may also need a little longer to get to grips with my open and clear manner and be able to do something with it. It depends on the player.\n\nDuring the last few games, you were able to pick up important points, especially against your direct rivals. How is the mood at the moment?\n\nThe mood is good, but it hasn't been bad the whole time either. We've lost a few games in which we put in a good performance. We've always remained positive. The atmosphere is generally good, but now it's much more relaxed, of course after some wins. The players seem much more confident. I also have the feeling that we are more stable now, so that even a setback - which could still come in the next few weeks - would certainly not throw us off track.\n\nThe team has increased its goal tally from 0.8 to 2 goals per game. What adjustments have you made?\n\nRight from the start I thought about which players we had with which skills and how we could get the team on the pitch in such a way that these skills would come to the fore. I think it took us a little while to find our way, with a few ups and downs. Now we've found a way of playing that suits our players well and that makes them feel comfortable and successful.\n\nWhere is the greatest need for improvement at the moment?\n\nWe keep trying week after week to optimize our game and adjust things. We have fluctuations and swings up and down. Sometimes one thing works better and sometimes the other. It always depends on what kind of opponent you're playing against. The important thing is that we keep raising the bar, and we are.\n\nUnder former coach Ingo Preußer, home-grown players from the U19s rarely got a chance to play. Are you also planning to use players from the U19s?\n\nI don't want to make any comparisons here. I see what the players offer me in training, and the same applies to the U19s who I observe carefully, including int the UEFA Youth League, and at internationals. At the end of the day, it's clearly about developing talented young players. But that also means that they have to face up to the competition and ultimately, for me, it's about getting the team, or the players, onto the pitch who have shown the most hunger to succeed during the training week. It doesn't matter to me whether it's an eighteen-year-old or a twenty-three-year-old player, if they deserve to be on the pitch they play.\n\nWe often read that you are a coach who can make the players better. So can we look forward to a number of players making the leap from the U23s to the first team again in the future?\n\nThat's a bit too simplistic for me. It's not me who makes players better, it's the players themselves. Every player is responsible for getting better. I'm someone who likes to help motivated players to get better. I support them with everything I have. I'm very allergic to uncommitted or easily offended players. But players who are really keen and motivated get everything I can give them. And then a player simply develops of his own accord. But you also have to remember that the leap from the U23s to the Borussia Dortmund first team is huge. The leap from the U19s to the U23s is also a big one. The third division is also a professional league and highly demanding, however you mustn't forget that Borussia Dortmund is a Champions League club. I know that the question is often asked why the U19 talents, who are Germany's leading side at their level, don't manage to become professionals at Borussia Dortmund. The reason is because of that sheer gulf between the 3. Liga and playing at the top in Europe. It's a very big ask.\n\nWhat is the most important aspect to consider when developing talent?\n\nGiving them a framework. This includes clear rules and clear tasks, but also a certain amount of freedom in which they can develop. Then also the support that they always have the feeling that they can make mistakes if they are motivated and hard-working, that they can then iron out these mistakes and learn from them. Ultimately, that is part of development.\n\nTo what extent does the game on show in 23/24 meet your expectations?\n\nIt's definitely going in the right direction. For me, it's important that what we do is active. Regardless of whether we or the opponent has the ball. That what we do is purposeful. I'm not someone who likes it when we have 70% possession but only play in our own half. I want us to play attacking football, to be determined, to create chances and to score goals. That we have great dynamism in our game. I think we're on the right track now.\n\nWhat does the football you play generally stand for?\n\nEvery coach has an idea, but you also need the players for that. There are very few coaches, if you exclude Pep Guardiola, and two or three big names, who have their own game idea and all the money in the world to develop with. As I said at the beginning, I have to look at what players we have and what potential these players have. However, it's always important to me that I have a really committed group. We will never just stand at the back and try to defend our goal, we'll actively try to win every ball. We will actively try to create scoring chances so that you always have the feeling, even as a spectator, that the team wants to be on top.\n\nYour coaching career began as a player-coach at Egestorf/Langreder. Why did you decide to become a coach in the first place?\n\nBecause I always had stress with coaches and then thought: \"Okay, then I'd rather do it myself.\" (laughs) my first role as a player manager was definitely not a smart idea, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Either you train and then play well, or you do the training. Not both. That's why it's always something that never really works. I then, perhaps fortunately in hindsight, injured myself quite badly with a torn cruciate ligament. So the question of being a player-coach no longer arose. I was just a coach and the decision was taken away from me. In hindsight, apart from the serious injury, it was quite good that it was over.\n\nYou were then both coach and sports manager at fourth tier TSV Havelse, how do you even manage it with such a double or even triple load?\n\nYou can do it if you want to and are motivated. If you are well organized and have people around you who support you. It's not as if I was completely alone. There were also great people in my immediate environment at Havelse who took a lot of things off my hands and it's the same here. I don't think any coach or sports director is successful on their own, it's always a team effort. I'm totally happy with my coaching team and the staff here. They are all totally committed and motivated and that makes my job a lot easier.\n\nBefore Borussia Dortmund, your time at Hannover was your only stint in the official professional game. How do you look back on your time there?\n\nOf course, it took a lot of strength and energy. It also took me a relatively long time to come to terms with this station. Looking back now, I can say that I am a much better coach today than I was before I took up my position in Hannover. I gained a lot of experience there and learned a great deal. I hope to implement the learning in Dortmund.\n\nSince you left there in November 2021, it was the first time in your coaching career that you were without a club for an extended period. How did you use this time?\n\nAt the beginning, it was also a conscious decision not to do anything again straight away. I was really just knackered. I didn't have a break at all in the summer. I remember that I had the second relegation match with Havelse on Saturday and we were promoted, and on Monday I had my first training session with Hannover. That means I only had one day off this year, so to speak. Of course it was very hectic. I had some extended time after leaving the club, which I used for travel abroad, that was much needed.\n\nWas it purely a learning and cultural thing abroad or did you also consider working in other countries?\n\nI have also considered working abroad, which I still find an attractive proposition. But I was much more interested in how the game is played in other countries like England, USA, and Spain. What is the style of play, how do they train in what is the focus, what is the emphasis. I certainly picked up one or two things that I might be able to use for myself here at Borussia Dortmund."
