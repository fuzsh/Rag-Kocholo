        "text": "DORTMUND, Germany — Jadon Sancho starred as Borussia Dortmund beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in the season-opening German Supercup on Saturday.\n\nSancho scored one goal and brilliantly set up Paco Alcacer for the other as Dortmund secured a morale-boosting victory over its old rival and delivered a statement of intent for the season ahead.\n\n''We know that we still have a tall task ahead of us for the championship,'' Dortmund team official Sebastian Kehl said.\n\nDortmund is bidding to end Bayern's unprecedented seven-year reign as German champion and significantly boosted its squad with summer signings though only Nico Schulz was able to start as injuries took their toll.\n\nInstead, it was left to Sancho to carry on where he left off last season as the 19-year-old England forward produced another sparkling performance.\n\n''All the defenders, even Bayern's defenders—when he has the ball at his feet, they're a little bit afraid,'' Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel said. ''Jadon has a lot of quality. He's really fast, technically he's very good. He can score, make passes, so he's really complete.''\n\nThe game, a curtain-raiser for the coming season, was sold out, watched by more than 81,000 fans at the Westfalenstadion.\n\nThey were barely given time to settle as the game began with an outstanding save from Bayern captain Manuel Neuer to deny Dortmund counterpart Marco Reus.\n\nThe next big chance also fell to Dortmund. Neuer rushed out of goal and Alcacer tried scooping the ball over him toward the unguarded net. Fans stood up and watched as the ball went wide.\n\nRobert Lewandowski replied with Bayern's first effort, which was deflected away, before Neuer saved again to deny Raphael Guerreiro.\n\nBayern improved through the half with Niko Kovac's side looking assured on the ball.\n\n''We didn't take our chances,'' Kovac complained.\n\nAlcacer broke the deadlock after the break, all thanks to Sancho. He eluded three Bayern defenders, then played the ball through Niklas Sule's legs for Alcacer to sweep it inside the right post.\n\nBayern sought a response and was only denied through desperate defending with Marwin Hitz saving and Manuel Akanji blocking on the line before the ball was cleared away.\n\nSancho then struck on a counterattack in the 69th after Guerreiro played the ball over the Bayern defense. The young forward stayed calm before slotting the ball through Neuer's legs.\n\nOf all Dortmund's summer signings, only Schulz could play. Mats Hummels was denied a quick reunion with his former Bayern teammates due to muscular problems, Julian Brandt was out with a groin problem, Thorgan Hazard with an ankle injury and Mateu Morey with a shoulder injury. Goalkeeper Roman Burki was also out."
