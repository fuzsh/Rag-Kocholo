        "text": "Why do so many American footballers play in Germany?\n\nIf you go to a game today, and ask a fan about the players, most of the answers will be things like He is tall, He plays well in the air, or He is really good at punting.\n\nBut over the last 40 years, no two American football teams have performed with more consistency than the Detroit Lions, who are generally considered among the best at their sport. Their home field has been known as the Big House for decades, and it holds close to 100,000 fans during the regular season. Detroit is just a few miles from the border with Canada, meaning they play three Canadian teams every season. They have won ten NFL championships, have won more games against other NFL teams than any other team since the 1980s, and have lost less games against other NFL teams than any other team since the 1980s.\n\nThe Lions won 11 straight games during the 1980s, one of the biggest streaks in NFL history. Since the NFL merged its professional football leagues with the old AFL and NFL in 1970, it is safe to say that Detroit will be at the top of the mountain for the foreseeable future.\n\nHere we will take a detailed look into the past and present of this storied franchise. While looking back through history, we will also see if there are any hidden gems among the current team. It is by no means an exhaustive, comprehensive look at the history of the Detroit Lions. Instead, it is merely a collection of the notable events and results that have shaped the Lions' history.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, let's define America's Team as the teams to have played in Super Bowls the most often. To find out how many games each team has won in those Super Bowls, click here.\n\nDetroit has been an NFL power for decades, but their roots can be traced all the way back to 1909. John M. Honey Ferryman, the owner of the Tigers, wanted to bring baseball to Detroit, but he did not want to face the fierce opposition from William S. Football Tilden, who owned the team called the Michigan Athletic Club. He bought out Tilden and renamed the team the Lions.\n\nWho is Germany's main striker?\n\nIs he the one who scores?\n\nOr is it the one who runs behind and brings others into play?\n\nIn the final days of the 2016/17 Bundesliga campaign, Domenico Tedesco, in the absence of top scorer Timo Werner, emerged as the Bundesliga's new scoring threat. So far this season, the Italy international has bagged 13 goals in just 18 appearances for RB Leipzig.\n\nDespite having a goal drought since May, his recent efforts have helped the club climb up the Bundesliga table. He now finds himself second in the goal charts for the season with 13 goals in 17 games and has been an important cog in Leipzig's rise to the top of the table.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who plays in a central role behind a midfield trio, has often been compared to the great Francesco Totti but there is more to Tedesco's game than simple comparisons. Expectations vs reality: It was one of those games that made you wonder why anyone would ever stop playing football. Just when everything seemed to be going well, a few careless passes almost cost you victory. Peter Bierhoff, Bayern Munich midfielder\n\nGermany's main striker has always been a position that lacked substance. As soon as he joined Borussia Dortmund as a youngster, Tedesco was touted as a future great. He could control a game, had a superb eye for goal and was at times unstoppable. At least, that was the prevailing narrative on the international scene.\n\nIt was during the 2024 World Cup that Tedesco proved his undoubted talent. At 23 years old, he became Germany's youngest-ever goal scorer with a double against South Africa, but he was not able to contribute enough to help the team reach the latter stages of the tournament.\n\nIt was only in 2024 when things started to change. In an extraordinary run of form that culminated in his first and only cap for the national team at the age of 29, Tedesco bagged an impressive 15 goals.\n\nHe was the one that changed the German game, both domestically and in Europe. The Bundesliga turned into a real race for the striker. However, since that summer he had not looked back, winning the double and scoring six goals in a single Champions League campaign.\n\nWho is the 14 player on the German football team?\n\nWell, for some people, it's the striker Robert Lewandowski who scored 14 goals in just 5 games as Poland won Euro 2024 last summer.\n\nThe man from the city of Kostrzyn has been the talisman for Poland since 2024, when he first became the focal point of the national side. He came back from injury early in 2024 and was on target again for his country, but he has been injured since then and a long spell on the sidelines.\n\nHowever, it's the entire football team that has caught the eye, rather than just one player - in what is still a fairly young squad, all of the players on the German football team are under 26 years old, and 13 of them have been called up to play for Germany in the past year. The youngest of them is 21-year-old Reus, who is a big part of this new generation of the German team. In addition to Reus, here are 14 of the current German football team - which is the 14-player on the German football team.\n\nGoalkeeper Manuel Neuer (31 years old). Reus' Dortmund team mate Sebastian Kehl, who is also a goalkeeper, also plays for Germany and was called up to the national team this year. Neuer will be 32 by the time Germany make their next European Championship. He's been called up to play for Germany three times - in 2024, 2024, and the Euro 2024 quarter finals, where Germany were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. A World Cup winner with Germany, he made the final in Brazil in 2024, but didn't play because of a slight injury he picked up that day.\n\nManuel Neuer (left), and Jann-Hendrik Tomczyk of Borussia Dortmund, and Sebastian Kehl of Borussia Dortmund celebrate winning the 2024 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Manuel Neuer (middle) celebrates after Germany beat Ghana 4-2 in the quarter finals of the 2024 FIFA World Cup. Manuel Neuer (right) reacts after Germany lost 2-1 to Brazil in the last group stage match of the 2024 FIFA World Cup at Estadio Manille. Germany advanced to the last 16 after Uruguay beat Costa Rica 2-0.\n\nWho is the left back for Germany football team?\n\nThe German men's national football team (German: \"Nationalteam\") currently plays in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualification where they are currently second place in their group. To qualify for the 2024 FIFA World Cup, they will need to progress from an already difficult Group C that includes the likes of Portugal, Russia, and Saudi Arabia (and has yet to have a single game where Germany is not already assured of progressing) in May 2024.\n\nThis article will cover one of the more important players on the German team right now - the left back position. The most common position among top level football players in the world, and one of the hardest positions to play in. This article has three components: a history analysis, a recent performance analysis, and an outlook as to where this position ranks among all the best positions in the world.\n\nFirst, let's look back to Germany's previous Euro 2024 qualification run, 2024, when their main left back on the senior national team was the very successful Mats Hummels. 2015-present. In the run up to the European Championship, it became painfully obvious that Germany had no depth in the midfield. They were forced to play a number of players in different midfield positions, with two more than one of these positions being rotated at least four times throughout the competition. Even the coach (Domenico Tedesco) admitted in an interview before the tournament that he was a little disappointed with his squad's performance. For all their midfielders, he admitted that none were able to hold down their position very well.\n\nMats Hummels was the strongest central defensive midfielder, but could also be used on the right side. Here you can see him played alongside Per Mertesacker and Ilkay Gndogan on the right against Hungary. There was no problem when he had those two in front of him. Also note how he had to come out of the penalty area to make a diagonal pass. He still succeeded, but he wasn't comfortable enough having to do so.\n\nThe two biggest problems seemed to be Ilkay and Toni Kroos. The former was inconsistent all tournament and clearly didn't like having to come out of the defensive third to the ball (as shown in the above image). The latter could not stay healthy enough and never really performed to his capabilities (which, even with injuries, are always underestimated)."
