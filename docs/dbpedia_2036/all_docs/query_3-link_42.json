        "text": "Welcome to the Football Manager 2013 thread for...\n\nA BRIEF BVB BACKGROUND\n\nBorussia Dortmund are a German Bundesliga side who've become an iconic figure in the footballing landscape of Germany and Europe. Their greatest achievement to date was their 1997 UEFA Champions League triumph, a win which you'll read about later on. Borussia Dortmund - or BVB for short - are a club with ethics. With little funds available, especially when compared to the aristocrats of PSG & Manchester City, they've defied popular belief by winning two successive Bundesliga titles. An extraordinary achievement.\n\nBVB - The History\n\nBorussia Dortmund roots run deep into the heart of German football. After a group of parish-sponsored footballers, coached by the fearsome parish priest, they decided to form a professional football club - henceforth the establishment of Borussia Dortmund on December 19th, 1909. The decades to come offered little to celebrate, with relative mediocrity in the lower leagues. Bankruptcy reared it's unwelcome head in 1929, but a well-financed fan ensured that BVB weren't left red - or yellow - faced...\n\nThe name Borussia is derived from the nearby beer brewery which once stood in industrious heart of West Germany, Dortmund. Initially, the players donned a rather absurd mixture of blue and white stripes, a red sash and black shorts, but 1913 saw the introduction of the famous Yellow and Black vertical stripes - a colour scheme which has monopolised German football in the past couple of seasons.\n\nThe Third Reich regime, BVB's involvement in WWII and what ensued in post-war Germany;\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the Third Reich which restructured sports and football organizations throughout the nation to suit the regime's goals. Borussia's president was replaced when he refused to join the Nazi Party, and a couple of members who surreptitiously used the club's offices to produce anti-Nazi pamphlets were executed in the last days of the war. As the landscape of day-to-day Germany changed drastically, the footballing layout changed too. The club did have greater success in the newly established Gauliga Westfalen, but would have to wait until after World War II to make a breakthrough.\n\nIt was also during this period when Borussia Dortmund's now famous rivalry with FC Schalke 04 began. Described as the 'Mother of all German derbies', the rivalry is one of the fiercest in World Football - and it all came about due to Schalke's dominance of the Gauliga Westfalen, not to mention the close proximity of both clubs. To this day, it's still a much anticipated fixture in German football. Nothing has changed, and it never will.\n\nAs the allied authorities attempted to distance themselves, and the German citizens, from the recent Nazi regime, all institutions were dissolved. A somewhat far-fetched plan to merge two other clubs with BVB put into motion, but needless to say, that venture failed miserably. So much so, Borussia Dortmund made their first appearance in the national league final, losing 3-2 to Mannheim. It was only 7 years later, in 1956, when Borussia Dortmund tasted success by winning the Oberliga West title. In the years leading up to the Bundesliga's creation in 1963, Dortmund clinched another two Oberliga West titles. The Westphalia-based club's stock was certainly on the rise.\n\nBVB's induction to Die Bundesliga;\n\n1962, Dortmund. Plans were written up to establish Germany's first professional football league - the Bundesliga, a league which has harboured many a world-class player. After Borussia Dortmund's title-winning final season in the Oberliga West division, they were included in the first 16 teams to experience the Bundesliga. 1.Köln, who finished runners-up, also earned a place in the newly-founded professional division.\n\n1965 saw Borussia Dortmund clinch their first piece of silverwear under a professional cub status. The German Cup, now the DFB-Pokal Cup, was the first title to grace the soon-to-be expanding BVB troophy cabinet. In 1966, an important year in the history of English football, saw Borussia Dortmund triumph over one of England's best - Liverpool Football Club. The 2-1 victory in the Final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup came at a cost. Dortmund's Bundesliga form halted, before the club relinquished their lead to 1860 Münich with just 5 games remaining; a bitter sweet moment for the Borussia faithful.\n\nRelative mediocrity followed. It's a trend which has become quite a prominent one in the history of the club. After two cups wins in quick succession, the 1970's offered a much more dismal outlook. With financial issues again blighting the club's development, the club were relegated to the 2.Bundesliga in 1972. Four years in the 2.Bundesliga - split by the opening of BVB's current home, the Westfalenstadion, in 1974 - were put to an end after the club sealed a return to Germany's premier division. The 80's saw little change in Borussia Dortmund' future, once again the club suffered from lingering financial issues. Althoug, in 1989, a 4-1 triumph in the German Cup final over Werder Bremen proposed a much more successful decade.\n\nThe 90's - Cash flushed, the Champions League & Lars Ricken's goal...\n\nOttmar Hitzfeld will forever be held in high-estime. That UEFA Champions League win, that Lars Ricken goal - their all memories which will never fade from a Borussia Dortmund fan. The club's patience and perseverance was finally rewarded. An impressive UEFA Cup run in the '92-'93 season was the catalyst to later success. With former Stuttgart forward, the wily Hitzfeld, in charge, the club went on to clinch their first Bundesliga title in 1995, then their second just a season later.\n\nMatthias Sammer - now director of football at Bayern München - was an integral part of that title-winning side. The ginger haired Central Midfielder come Sweeper scored many a vital goal in the run-in, while his all-round performances earned him great recognition: named the European Footballer of the Year in 1996, it was an accolade which only four Germans had won before him. He's in good company, too - Gerd Müller, Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Löthar Matthäus.\n\nMoving onto one of the greatest moments in Borussia Dortmund's 103-year history. That UEFA Champions League win. A Juventus side, featuring the likes of Zinidine Zidané, Alessandro Del Piero and Dider Deschamps, travelled to the Olympicstadion in Münich on 28th of May, 1997. A brace from Karl-Heinze Riedle earned the hosts a half-time two-goal lead. The industrious, close marking of Zinidine Zidané by now Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert restricted the French maestro's involvement in the game to close to nothing. A goal from Juve legend Alessandro Del Piero offered the Italian Giant a route back into the game, but that goal from Dortmund boy, Lars Ricken, clinched the victory. A goal that will never be forgotten, a victory that will always be remembered - a wonderful chapter in BVB's history.\n\nThe 21st Century - a new start, a new Dortmund;\n\nAfter Borussia Dortmund's UEFA Champions League triumph, the turn of the Millenium offered plenty to be excited about. With well-established stars arriving at the Westfalenstadion, or the Signal Iduna Park it's now known, plenty was being spent. With the first two seasons proposing little to shout about, the 2002/'03 season proposed plenty. BVB overtook Bundesliga rivals Bayer Leverkusen in the final leg of the Bundesliga to clinch the title, while another fine European cup run was brought to an end by Dutch giants Feyenoord. This successful season was to be the last for some while, as the financial implications of challenging at League and European level were starting to take effect on the Deutscher Meister...\n\nIn 2005, Borussia Dortmund were driven to the brink of bankruptcy, the second time in 80 years. Poor financial management coupled with poor results on the playing field, not to mention the increasing cost of players wages, meant that BVB were plunged into financial uncertainty. This makes Borussia Dortmund's revival all the more impressive. Dortmund narrowly avoided falling into administration, but at a cost of their competitiveness. The next couple of seasons (2005-'06 to 2007-'08) saw Borussia Dortmund continually fall down the Bundesliga rankings. As well as that, the BVB faithful saw their better players - most notably Tomás Rosický and Chritsoph Metzelder - leave the club.\n\nJürgen Klopp, in the Summer of 2008, was appointed Borussia Dortmund's first-team manager. The ex-Mainz manager was an instant success. In his first season, die Pöhler achieved a fifth place finish in the Bundesliga - narrowly missing out on qualification to the promised land, the UEFA Champions League. The eccentric, charismatic Klopp seemingly reinstated a long-lost belief and passion into the first-team squad. An important ingredient to any Borussia Dortmund team. The 2010-2011 season saw an even bigger improvement at Borussia Dortmund. Mario Götze made his breakthrough into the first-team, Nuri Şahin continued his imperious form while the centre-half partnership of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotić flourished. BVB completed the season as Bundesliga champions: a tremendous achievement for a magnificent team.\n\nThe 2011/'12 season only got better. Many questioned Michael Zorc's decision to let Nuri Şahin make his €10 million move to the Giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid. Those pressing questions of Borussia Dortmund's ambition and decision to let Şahin move couldn't have been more irrelevant. Another Bundesliga title, their fifth in the club's history, was won on the thirty-second matchday. Jürgen Klopp had defied popular belief yet again. In an injury-ravaged season, Mario Götze was unfortunate not to play a bigger part in BVB's triumph, but the likes of Jakub Błaszczykowski and Kevin Großkreutz more than impressed in the 19-year old's absence. The Polish bloc - Lewandowski, Blaszczykowski and Piszczek - all impressed, while Ilkay Gündoğan and club captain Sebastian Kehl forged a formidable midfield partnership.\n\nBorussia Dortmund: Deutscher Meister 2010/'11, 2011/'12... 2012/'13?\n\nBVB - Infrastructure and Facilities;\n\nTHE STADIUM\n\nThe Signal Iduna Park - an atmospheric, fearsome football stadium. Ever since it's construction in 1972, the Westfalenstadion, as the fans still call it, has been a huge asset to the club. With it being able to hold 80,720, the gate receipts is a huge source of income for the club. Nothing's different on Football Manager 2013, though: good results on the pitch will bring good results on the balance books, with season ticket and ticket sales leading the clubs profit.\n\nThe name 'Signal Iduna Park' came about arounda decade ago, when the club was embroiled in worrying financial difficulties. As a extra source of income, the club's hierarchy sold the naming rights to Westphalia-based Insurance company, Signal Iduna. The clubs fans, as expected, were disappointed in the decision despite it being for the good of the club. Many still call it the Westfalenstadion, as do I from time-to-time.\n\nBORUSSIA DORTMUND II STADIUM\n\nThe Borussia Dortmund II side, who play in the 3.Bundesliga, play their competitive home matches in the Stadion Rote Erde, which is situated in the shadow of Signal Iduna Park. At capacity, it holds an impressive 25,000 spectators. Built in the 1920's, the Stadion Rote Erde, at one time, was the home of the Borussia Dortmund senior side.\n\nTRAINING FACILITIES\n\nWith player development one of Borussia Dortmund's priorities and beliefs, it's important that the players have the best environment to work in. They certainly have that in the Dortmund-Bracken training centre. The state-of-the-art facility offers everything a football team could want - from recovery pools to a plethora of UEFA standard pitches. The training centre also plays host to BVB's youth team games.\n\nBorussia Dortmund - Squad Analysis\n\nFirst-team squad list;\n\n** - Denotes important first-team player | ** - Denotes promising, young talent\n\n1.

Weidenfeller has become an integral player in the current Borussia Dortmund side - especially during BVB's first Bundesliga-winning season in 2010/'11. By far the superior 'keeper to both Almorevic and Langerak. There's a couple more season in him yet.\n\nMitchell Langerak | #20 - 24 YEARS OLD - AUSTRALIA - £8,250 A WEEK\n\nDeputy to the ever impressive Roman Weidenfeller, the young Aussie's gametime in the BVB first-team has been limited. With rare starts in the Bundesliga, cup competitions such as the DFB-Pokal Cup offer a good stage upon which Langerak can perform and prove himself. He should be regarded as your second choice goalkeeper.\n\nZlatan Almerović | #33 - 21 YEARS OLD - SERBIA - £1,700 A WEEK\n\nAlmorević has been on the fringes of joining the first-team squad for a while now, but this season finally sees Almorević break into the first-team squad. With the young Serb unlikely to gain much first-team experience, a loan deal would be advisable - although do so at your own peril.\n\nDEFENDERS;\n\nNeven Subotić | #4 - Centre Back - 23 YEARS OLD - SERBIA - £25,000 A WEEK\n\nJürgen Klopp brought many an asset with him from FSV Mainz: enthusiasm, good football and, ultimately, trophies. Despite those, he brought another equally important ingredient to add into the BVB concoction - Neven Subotić. Born in then-Yugoslavia, before being raised in Germany and later the United States of America, Subotić's childhood was a turbulent one. Joining Mainz at the age of 17, he flourished into a fine centre-half. After Klopp's departure to BVB, the Serbian international duly followed. Since then, Subotić has become a leading Bundesliga centre-back.\n\nMats Hummels | #15 - Centre Back - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £67,000 A WEEK\n\nHummels is a product of the Bayern München academy, the academy in which is father was once head of. After making only one appearance in three tiresome years at the Allianz Arena, Hummels was loaned and eventually bought by Borussia Dortmund for a derisory £2.9 million. Strong in the tackle, dominant in the air and good with the ball, Mats Hummels is a perfect example of a fantastic, modern day defender. His elegant, assured approach has drawn comparisons with Franz Beckenbauer.\n\nOliver Kirch | #21 - Right Back - 30 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £13,000 A WEEK\n\nEvery squad needs an utility player - or in German, dienstprogramm spieler. Capable anywhere down the right-hand side and as a holding midfielder, Kirch caught the eye last season while at Kaiserslautern. Signed in the Summer of 2012 for €350,000, the 30-year old will prove to be a valuable member of the squad. Kirch could easily be branded as 'deadwood', but I suggest you not to judge hastily.\n\nChris Löwe | #24 - Left Back - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £8,250 A WEEK\n\nWith Marcel Schmaelzer the standout candidate for the regular left-back position, the wily figure of Chris Löwe is certainly his back-up - despite his 'naturalness' on the left-side of midfield. Equipped with a good turn of pace and good attacking attributes, his defensive side of the game leaves a lot to be desired. It's something which you'll have to address; whether it be by finding a replacement, or putting in plenty of hours at the training ground.\n\nPatrick Owomoyela | #25 - Right Back - 32 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £16,750 A WEEK\n\nSince joining the club in 2008, Owomoyela has racked up 82 appearances for die Borussen. Possessing good defensive ability, coupled with experience and know-how, Owomoyela could be card to have in your hand. Yet another player which will be deemed as deadwood, but I beg to differ - for a season, at least.\n\nŁukasz Piszczek | #26 - Right Back - 27 YEARS OLD - POLAND - £29,000 A WEEK\n\nŁukasz Piszczek is certainly a player who's continually flourished as the seasons have gone by. Starting out as a fleet-footed winger, his transition from an advanced role into a right-back one has been extraordinary. Possessing great pace, power and attacking flair, Piszczek has become a fine attacking outlet for Borussia Dortmund. Despite his attacking tendencies, he doesn't forget his defensive duties. He's the perfect fullback for a team like Borussia Dortmund. Keep him at all costs.\n\nFelipe Santana | #27 - Centre Back - 26 YEARS OLD - BRAZIL - £20,000 A WEEK\n\nSantana is, and should be, the back-up to both Mats Hummels and Neven Subotić. Tall, robust and pacey, Santana has all the physical attributes to handle the Bundesliga. He's not quite as impressive mentally, while technically he leaves a bit to be desired. As an alternative to Hummels and Subotić, the Brazilian is certainly a good option to have at your disposal. There's no reason to let a good centre-half go when he's coming into the prime of his career.\n\nMarcel Schmelzer | #29 - Left Back - 24 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £33,500 A WEEK\n\nSigned in the Summer of 2005 as a raw 17-year old from FC Magdeburg, Schmelzer's rise to prominence has been remarkable. The title-winning season of 2010/2011 was certainly his best to date. The industrious left-back is impressive both defending and going forward. A contract extension certainly wouldn't go a miss. At 24-years old, a bright future lies ahead of Schmelzer, who's picked up 6 caps for die Nationalmannschaft.\n\nMIDFIELDERS;\n\nSebastian Kehl | Club Captain - #5 - Defensive Midfield - 32 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £50,000 A WEEK\n\nSebastian Kehl has been at Borussia Dortmund club for no less than 10 years now. Kehl is Dortmund through-and-through. A £2 million signing from SC Freiburg back in 2001, Kehl has certainly repaid the fee with consistently good performances. In recent years, Kehl's career has been blighted by injury, although he's no beginning to refind his best form - form which won him 33 caps for Germany in the past decade. With his contract expiring in 2013, I'd suggest to begin negotiations on a one-year extension right away.\n\nSven Bender | #6 - Defensive Midfield - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £29,000 A WEEK\n\nSven Bender is yet another holding midfielder who's development has been knocked back by various injuries. Defensively incredibly sound, while offensively good, one can only imagine where he'd be now without the constant niggling injuries. Regarded as the long-term replacement for club captain Sebastian Kehl, Sven's got big boots to fill. With fantastic attributes all round Sven's twin brother, Lars Bender, currently plays for rivals Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nMoritz Leitner | #7 - Central Midfield - 19 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £16,750 A WEEK\n\nAt 19-years old, young Leitner has a glittering career ahead of him. Comfortable anywhere in midfield, he's an energetic addition to BVB's midfield options. Attacking guile and creativity while able defensively, he offers another option for you to ponder over. With the likes of Götze and Gündoğan ahead of him, he's one for the future. Leitner will flourish with the right management.\n\nIlkay Gündoğan | #8 - Central Midfield- 22 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £30,000 A WEEK\n\nThe departure of Nuri Şahin was a cause of concern for many a BVB fan, but Nürnberg's Ilkay Gündoğan firmly allayed initial worries. Often the deepest man in midfield, Gündoğan offers much more than just a strong tackle; his ball-playing abilities are, arguably, second-to-none in the Borussia Dortmund squad at the moment. The deep-lying creativity and a forward-thinking mindset are just a handful of similarities drawn with the man he replaced, Nuri Şahin. Ilkay Gündoğan is the rudder of a sometimes misguided BVB midfield.\n\nMario Götze | #10 - Attacking Midfield - 20 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £77,000 A WEEK\n\nHe has it all: the talent, the ability, the potential. Courted by many a European Giant, it's imperative you resist all bids, however flattering. He's been branded as the 'future of German football', and I couldn't agree more. Quick of mind as well as feet, tricky or direct when needs be and capable of filling in anywhere across the front three, Götze is a prized Borussia and Bundesliga asset. The small, classy playmaker should be the focal point of your midfield - look to get him on the ball in advanced, threatening positions. He'll serve you well.\n\nMarco Reus | #11 - Attacking Midfield - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £67,000 A WEEK\n\nAs 'German Footballer of the Year', Marco Reus sealed a hefty €17.2 million Summer move to Borussia Dortmund back in January, although it's only now he joins the BVB squad. Much like Götze, he can play anywhere along the frontline. Marco Reus began his youth career at BVB, but made a name for himself at Gladbach. With electric fast, he's known to rip any defense apart with impressive ball control and a ruthless finishing ability when presented a chance. The present and future, both wrapped into one bundle of brilliance.\n\nIvan Perišić | #14 - Attacking Midfield - 23 YEARS OLD - CROATIA - £21,500 A WEEK\n\nSigned from Belgian side Club Brugge back in the Summer of 2011, the young Croat enjoyed a fine debut Bundesliga season. Yet another incredibly versatile midfield, he'll add more depth and options to what is quite a small squad. At 6' 2\", Perišić brings a physical edge to the BVB team too. As an alternative to the smaller, trickier players, Perišić is one of the best out there. Unlikely to be a starter, you should look to use him off the bench when deemed necessary.\n\nKuba Blaszczykowski | #16 - Right Wing 26 YEARS OLD - POLAND - £49,500 A WEEK\n\nLast season proved to be a brilliant one for Polish national captain, Jakub Blaszczykowski - or 'Kuba', as he's fondly known. After Mario Götze's season was broken down by various injuries, Kuba stood up and wanted to be counted. Creating and scoring goals, Kuba pinned down a regular first-team position for club and country. Last season, he became part of an impressive 'Polish Bloc' in the Borussia Dortmund side: with Łukasz Piszczek and Robert Lewandowski supporting Kuba admirably.\n\nKevin Großkreutz | #19 - Left Wing - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £25,000 A WEEK\n\nBorn in the Drtmund area, Großkreutz certainly understands the dynamics and traditions of Borussia Dortmund. He's a typical German stereotype: hardworking, efficient and effective. Predominantly a left winger, Großkreutz can fill in through the middle, at left-back and on the right-hand side too. With the addition of Marc Reus to the squad, Großkreutz should be used in a substitute role and in away games, where defensive duties are a priority.\n\nLeandro Bittencourt | #32 - Attacking Midfield - 18 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £8,250 A WEEK\n\nBorn in Eastern Germany to Brazilian parents, Leandro Bittencourt certainly has a good footballing pedigree in terms of his dual nationality. After impressing at Energie Cottbus last season, a £2.3 million deal was agreed during the 2011/'12 season, but only joins the club this Summer. He fits into the BVB attacking midfield contingent well; cunningly creative, the advanced midfielder is another player who should be nurtured and pampered.\n\nFORWARDS;\n\nRobert Lewandowski | #9 - Striker - 24 YEARS OLD - POLAND - £25,000 A WEEK\n\nLewandowski is much more than just you run-of-the-mill goal scorer. Able to run the channels, hassle the opposition and hold up the ball, it's his dynamism which makes him the striker he is today. Fitting into the BVB system perfectly, and with his contract expiring in 2014, I'd advise you to begin negotiations on a new long-term contract right away. If played in the correct set-up, Lewandowski will be a significant player for your BVB team.\n\nJulian Schieber | #23 - Striker - 23 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £21,500 A WEEK\n\nDeemed as Lucas Barrios' - who left for the far reaches of Chinese football - replacement, Julian Schieber certainly has some act to follow. The £5.2 million spent on him certainly heaps a fair amount of pressure onto the 23-year old's shoulders, too. Scoring only 6 goals in 49 appearances, Schieber isn't a prolific scorer but certainly is a hard-worker - a value which appealed to Jürgen Klopp.\n\nNOTABLE RESERVE & YOUTH TEAM PLAYERS | IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS\n\nMarc Hornschuh | #3 - Centre Back - 21 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £3,900 A WEEK\n\nThe centre-half come right-back has yet to play for Borussia Dortmund's senior side, despite being at the club for the majority of his career. Appearing 9-times for Germany's U-21 side , the young Dortmund-born Hornschuh could have a future at BVB, but that's entirely up to you. I'd suggest a DFB-Pokal Cup role for the first season. You can then make up your mind from there on.\n\nMustafa Amini | #28 - Attacking Midfield - 19 YEARS OLD - AUSTRALIA - £1,700 A WEEK\n\nKnown as \"Musti\", the former Central Coast Mariners playmaker became the latest Aussie to make the transition from A-League to Bundesliga football, following in the footsteps of compatriot and team-mate Mitchell Langerak. Possessing the basic attributes to develop into a good attacking midfielder, the Australian U-21 (Young Socceroo, thanks Nick1408) international has a fine future ahead of him - preferably at Borussia Dortmund.\n\nKoray Günter | #30 - Centre Back - 18 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £1,700 A WEEK\n\nThe German youth international is, arguably, one of the best players to come from the Borussia Dortmund youth academy since Mario Götze. Powerful and tall, he has the physique to become a good Bundesliga player. His ability to read the game adds another dimension to his game. Born in Germany to Turkish players, he's yet to decide which nationality he wants to represent at senior level.\n\nMarvin Bakalorz | #31 - Defensive Midfield - 22 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £2,200 A WEEK\n\nA regular for Borussia Dortmund's II team, Bakalorz signed a new two-year contract last season. At 22-years old, he's relatively old to make his Bundesliga breakthrough and he's still waiting for it. Sadly, I don't believe Bakalorz has the potential to improve. The DFB-Pokal Cup offers a good chance to see him in action.\n\nMarvin Ducksch | #34 - Striker - 18 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £1,700 A WEEK\n\nAlongside now-Liverpool striker, Samed Yesil, the blonde-haired, burly centre forward formed an impressive partnership for Germany's U-17 side in the 2011 U-17's World Cup. Lacking pace and agility, Ducksch more than makes up for it with his natural finishing ability - something which you could harness. Bare with him; he will improve.\n\nJeremy Dudziak | #n/a - Left Back - 17 YEARS OLD - GERMANY - £55 A WEEK\n\nMuch like Koray Günter, he's regarded highly within Borussia Dortmund's youth ranks. Described as a 'future Dortmund first-teamer', the versatile Dudziak has a big future ahead of him. For the first season at least, Dudziak's development is best served in BVB's U-19's side, but that decision is one for you to make.\n\nBorussia Dortmund - Realistic Transfer Targets\n\nTRANSFER POLICY\n\nWithout the \"back door funded\" finance of many a European club, the Borussia Dortmund hierarchy run a tight ship. With a reasonable annual transfer budget, you'll have to get the best value out of your money. BVB have a strong tradition of buying, and developing, German talents and it's something you should look to continue. Don't be afraid of delving into the European and Global market too. Most European leagues, the Brasileirão and even the MLS are good sources of talent.\n\nDOMESTIC TARGETS\n\nHere are 5 targets who all play in Germany. As ever, the prices will vary.\n\nMarc-André ter Stegen Position: GK | Age: 20 | Club: Borussia Mönchengladbach | Nationality: German | Value: £6 million\n\nWith Roman Weidenfeller not getting any younger, it would be advisable to start thinking about possible replacements. Marc-André ter Stegen should be the number one target. A fine shot-stopper and good with the ball, he's very much capable of fitting into the BVB ethos of play. Regarded highly at Gladbach, you'll have to fork out at least £15 million to acquire ter Stegen's services. He's worth it, though.\n\nJan Kirchhoff Position: CB | Age: 22 | Club: FSV. Mainz 05 | Nationality: German | Value: £3.5 million\n\nMats Hummels, Neven Subotić and Felipe Santana are the only recognised centre-halves at the club, making the need for another a priority. Kirchhoff would certainly be a good option. With outstanding attributes - for instance, his pace and anticippation are '16' and 18' respectively - he'd be a fine addition to the squad. His contract expires in the Summer of 2013, so move hastily.\n\nSebastian Jung Position: RB | Age: 22 | Club: Eintracht Frankfurt | Nationality: German | Value: £2.3 million\n\nEnergetic, agile, forward-thinking, composed, penetrative - the young Sebastian Jung is a good example, even if lacking in experience, of a modern day right-back. At 22-years old, he'd be a good candidate to deputise for Łukasz Piszczek before, eventually, replacing him. Patrick Owomoyela, who currently plays back-up to the Pole, should leave once his contract expires in 2013.\n\nSebastian Rode Position: DM/CM | Age: 22 | Club: Eintracht Frankfurt | Nationality: German | Value: £3.9 million\n\nYet another Sebastian from Eintracht Frankfurt, the robust Rode has taken the Bundesliga by storm. Able to perform a plethora of roles, Sebastian Rode would over another dynamic option for you to ponder over - that's if you sign him, of course. With Rode regarded as \"indispensable\" to Frankfurt, it will take at least £8 million to prise him away from the newly-promoted club's clutches. Big future ahead.\n\nPatrick Herrmann Position: RM | Age: 21 | Club: Borussia Mönchengladbach | Nationality: German | Value: £3.7 million\n\nA player you should be looking to sign, the industrious wideman, Patrick Herrmann, first came to prominence last season. His clever runs, coupled with a good finish, ensure the right-sided midfielder bags a few goals a season; while his direct dribbling and blistering pace often causes problems for the opposition. A fee of around £10 million should loosen Gladbach's grip on the German U-21 international.\n\nOTHER TARGETS\n\nGoalkeepers: Ron-Robert Zieler (23; Hannover; £3.6 million) Defender: Serdar Tasçi (25; Stuttgart; £6 million), Matthias Ginter (18; Freiburg; £1.1 million) Midfielder: Aleksander Ignjovski (21; Werder Bremen; £2.4 million), Leon Goretzka (17; VfL Bochum; £150k), Takashi Inui (23; Eintracht Frankfurt; £4.8 million) Forwards: Ádám Szalai (24; Mainz 05; £4.1 million), Pierre-Michel Lassoga (20; Hertha Berlin BSC; £1.9 million)\n\nGLOBAL TARGETS\n\nHere are 7 targets from leagues all around the World. I've kept BVB's needs in mind, once again.\n\nRafael Cabral Position: GK | Age: 22 | Club: Santos | Nationality: Brazilian | Value: £3 million\n\nMaking three caps for the Brazilian national side, Rafael was once regarded as the long-term 'keeper of the famous footballing nation. Recently, he's gone off the boil slightly, but time is certainly on his side. At around £5 million, you'd be bringing in a assured, talented understudy to Roman Weidenfeller with the view of replacing him in the long-term. The domestic options are better, though.\n\nAleksander Dragović Position: CB | Age: 21 | Club: FC Basel | Nationality: Austrian | Value: £875,000\n\nThe Vienna born central defender has attracted many a big club in the past 12 months, most notably Premier League duo Arsenal and Newcastle United. Strong in the tackle, surprisingly quick and an ability to read the game, Dragović is a good option to have. At around £2 million, the fee is surprisingly low, too. Cappd 15-times for the Austrian national team.\n\nYaroslav Rakitskyi Position: CB | Age: 23 | Club: Skakhtar Donetsk | Nationality: Ukrainian | Value: £5.5 million\n\nShakhtar Donetsk have been a stalwart in Ukrainian football during the past couple of years while Yaroslav Rakistkyi, the burly, powerful centre-half, has been a stalwart in the Shakhtar defense. Recently turning 23-years old, he's already an established Ukrainian international and is only waiting for that 'big' move. Borussia Dortmund would be a great place for him to develop. You could make it happen.\n\nRicardo van Rhijn Position: RB | Age: 21 | Club: Ajax | Nationality: Dutch | Value: £1.9 million\n\nA product of the famed Ajax youth academy, van Rhijn has become a household name in Dutch football. To be used as an understudy to Piszczek, the Dutch youth international would be a good addition to the squad. There are plenty of right-back options, though. I'm just offering a few, lesser known names.\n\nJordy Clasie Position: CM | Age: 21 | Club: Feyenoord | Nationality: Dutch | Value: £6.25 million\n\nThe Eredivisie, as ever, is a hotbed for young talent - Jordy Clasie, who's stylish, but aggressive approach has won him many a plaudit, continues the tradition of promoting youth. A battling deep-lying playmaker, Clasie is an all-round midfielder with a big future ahead of him. Already a first-team regular at Feyenoord, you'll have to delve deep into the club's pockets.\n\nTomáš Rosický Position: CAM | Age: 31 | Club: Arsenal | Nationality: Czech | Value: £5.75 million\n\nOnce a Borussen, always a Borussen. The Arsenal playmaker, nicknamed 'Little Mozart', left Borussia Dortmund back in 2006 as the club was thrown into financial uncertainty. Rosický has had his fair share of injury problems, but another midfield option wouldn't go a miss. Keep the faith. Rosický will return home.\n\nLéonard Kweuke Position: ST | Age: 25 | Club: Sparta Prague | Nationality: Cameroonian | Value: £2.5 million\n\nThe distant relation to Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o, the burly striker is certainly in good company. After a brief spell in the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt, Kweuke joined Sparta Prague. Scoring an impressive 25 goals in two seasons, Léonard was thrust into the limelight and is now interesting some of Europe's biggest clubs. You certainly won't regret buying this Cameroonian.\n\nOTHER TARGETS\n\nGoalkeepers: Yann Sommer (23; FC Basel; £550k) Defenders: Stefan de Vrij (20; Feyenoord; £2.6 million), Vasilis Torosidis (27; Olympiacos; £.8 million), Nicolai Boilesen (20; AFC Ajax; £1.9 million) Midfielders: Victor Wanyama (21; Celtic; £3.9 million), Lucas Biglia (26; RSC Anderlecht; £2.9 million), Cidinho (19; Botafogo; £1.9 million) Forwards: Gonzalo Bruno (19; Nacional; £1.9 million), Waris Majeed (20; BK Häcken; £450k)"
