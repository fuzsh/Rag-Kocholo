        "text": "In the semi-finals of the Champions League, reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid await Bayern Munich. In what will undoubtedly be a clash of the titans, there will be a further individual battle taking place.\n\nJamal Musiala and Jude Bellingham are currently two of the best young players in European football, and before Bellingham moved to the Spanish capital, they were two of the best young players in the Bundesliga. When Bayern faced Borussia Dortmund, Der Klassiker was often overshadowed by the battle between the pair.\n\nHowever, the history between the two dates back even further. When they were younger, Musiala and Bellingham played alongside one another in the England youth teams.\n\nSpeaking to Marca, Musiala commented on his excitement about facing Bellingham in the Champions League: “Jude and I have always dreamed of playing games like this since we were children. I’m really looking forward to these two games.”\n\nDue to the pair’s close history, Musiala is aware of the strengths that the Englishman possesses, something he also stated during the interview: “Jude has always had a great mentality as a player. He is very confident and doesn’t shy away from big challenges.”\n\nWhen Der Rekordmeister and Los Blancos lock horns over the two legs, the outcome of the tie could be decided by the key battle between Musiala and Bellingham. Nevertheless, regardless of what happens throughout the tie, their childhood dreams would have come true."
