        "text": "Jamie Bynoe-Gittens will return to Borussia Dortmund training on July 8, one week after winning the European U19s Championship with England.\n\nThe 17-year-old will continue his development with the first team in preparation of the new season.\n\nSpeaking to Ruhr Nachrichten, Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl believes Bynoe-Gittens will take the next step in his development this season.\n\n“The title with the England team will give him further impetus for his goals at Borussia Dortmund,” said Kehl. “He can be an exceptional player but he has to stay fit and stable for that.\n\n“We have to find a good balance for him. He’s almost played through to July 1, he’s now getting a few days off so he can freshen up. The timing of the European Championship tournament certainly wasn’t optimal, so unfortunately he will now miss parts of the preparation with us.”\n\nBynoe-Gittens made his professional debut against Wolfsburg in April. The Englishman joined on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2020 and will sign a contract extension with BVB on his 18th birthday in August.\n\nGGFN"
