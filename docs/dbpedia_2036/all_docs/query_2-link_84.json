        "text": "How to Play as Borussia Dortmund\n\n2011/12\n\nIn this guide Sunny and I will show you how to play like Borussia Dortmund under German manager Jürgen Klopp. To give you an idea on how impressive Dortmund have been under Klopp, they have completed the domestic double in the 2011-12 season, winning the Bundesliga (arguably one of the most competitive top leagues in the world) 8 points ahead of traditional German giants, Bayern Munich. Both finished with the same goal difference, but Klopp and co. proved that they were the best by scoring 80 league goals, the most team goals scored in the Bundesliga. They also beat Bayern in the DFB-Pokal final with an impressive scoreline of 5-2.\n\nHowever, their road to success isn't by any means easy. They had to cope with the loss of their talented Turkish playmaker, Nuri Sahin, who was pivotal to their success in the 2010-11 season, being the conductor of their symphony of counter-attacks. Their status also changed from being the black horse to being the team to beat. One similar team would be Napoli of Italy, and their transition hasn't been as fruitful as the German champions. Mario Götze, their young, talented magician was also plagued with injuries throughout the season. Yet they still managed a 26 game unbeaten streak from mid-December to the end of the season. They still remain unbeaten, and if you don't include Champions League matches, Borussia Dortmund have not been beaten since late-September 2011. So how did they do it?\n\nKlopp was once quoted from a press conference that he preferred the short passing game, but he's also fine with direct counter-attacks and crosses. This best describes Dortmund's style of play, being a very complete attacking unit has brought them the success last season. Their completeness has enabled them to create attacks as well as exploit mistakes and flaws of their opponents ruthlessly, with the highest average number of shots per game in the league (16.6 shots per game) and the 6th highest number of shots on-target per game among other top European teams. They have also matured into a rather proactive side, with their average possession improving from 52.5% to 55% this season, and pass success rate improving from 75.5% to 79%. It is also important to note that though they have the 5th highest possession figures in the league and 20th highest possession figures among top European teams, their pass success rate is only 34th among top European teams.\n\nBut how do they see so much of the ball with a relatively low pass success rate for a top side? Well, possession isn't just about completing passes, it's also about how fast you can win back the ball. Basing on their most frequent XI, Dortmund have a very young and energetic squad, with an average age of 23.9. This enables them to outrun and outfight their opponents, and you can often hear commentators talking about their hard pressing. According the WhoScored.com, Dortmund make the 3rd most tackles per game among European teams in top leagues, with an impressive 26 tackles per game. It is rare that such prolific tacklers are also the best team in the league - other teams that have achieved similar figures include Gijon, Athletic Bilbao, Mainz 05, and none of them are anywhere near the best in their respective leagues.\n\nWith such hard pressing, you'd expect that they have quite a number of cards. Well, Dortmund are actually the cleanest top side in Europe, with only a total of 33 yellow cards and 2 red cards in all of their matches.\n\nTactically, Klopp has made 3 major changes in the starting XI. Firstly, Sahin was replaced by German/Turkish midfielder Ilkay Gündogan. Veteran Sebastian Kehl also got a lot more game time in the 2011-12 season, forming a formidable midfield partnership with Ilkay towards the end of the season. However, the deep-lying playmaker role of Sahin has not been replicated through Gündogan. Many predicted that Klopp would convert Ilkay into the Sahin-role as both started out as classic no. 10s, but Ilkay played a different role from Sahin. While Sahin excelled with initiating counter-attacks and spraying long-passes to his teammates, Gündogan was more about short passing combined with his energy and movement. However, he was also a very solid holding midfielder at the same time, managing a total number of 77 tackles throughout the previous campaign. Apart from being the team's main playmaker managing 59.3 passes per game, Sahin was also Dortmund's creative hub, with an impressive 3.5 key passes per game. Ilkay, Kehl, and Sven Bender's figures stand at 47.9, 44.6, and 37.1 passes per game and 1.2, 0.6, and 0.6 key passes per game respectively.\n\nThe top passers are now centre-back pairing Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels, with Subotic managing an average of 63 passes per game, while Hummels managed an average of 58 passes per game. Their creativity now comes from Kuba and Kagawa, with the pair contributing a total of 17 assists throughout the season. Kuba replaced Mario Götze for most of the season, and managed an average of 1.9 key passes per game. Kagawa managed 1.8 key passes per game.\n\nWhile Kuba has been more of a traditional winger before, he is now more of an inside forward like Mario. As you can see below, he often comes inside from the wing, while he still holds width and crosses the ball, like what Götze would do:\n\nAnother major change was up front. Lucas Barrios was Borussia Dortmund's top scorer last season, managing 16 goals in a total of 32 appearances. He was injured and unfit after the Copa America, and when he was back, Lewandowski has already proved he was the better man, managing 20 goals and 6 assists in 31 appearances. Apart from being a more prolific striker, Lewandowski also played a different role up front, participating more in the build up play, and using his physical presence to hold up the ball for his teammates, sprinting from the midfield for counter-attacks. His movement was very different from a poacher too, as you can see here a comparison between Lewandowski's movement and the movement of a target man/poacher, Mario Gomez:\n\nHe was more suited to Klopp's game more than Barrios, as Barrios was more of a goal poacher, and Barrios eventually decided to leave the German champions.\n\nKlopp also rotated his XI more this season compared to the 2010-11 season. One example would be how Bender replaced Kehl in the starting XI for the 2010-11 season, while throughout March in the 2011-12 season, Klopp rotated between Ilkay, Kehl, and Sven Bender in the centre of midfield. He’s named an unchanged side just four times, compared to nine occasions last season. While Klopp has a very young squad, keeping a fresh squad is a key factor to success nowadays.\n\nOk lads (and ladies), I (Matt) am coming into the picture more now.\n\nAs you can see from the picture above, Klopp used a 4-2-3-1 with Borussia Dortmund. In real life, Dortmund are very flexible, which is somewhat similar to Joachim Löw's Germany. The hardworking wingers can come inside, hold width, while still rushing back to form 2 banks of 4 when in defense. The central attacking midfielder contributes less to defense. It might be a 4-4-1-1 if inside forwards were available in ML/MR, but let's just stick with a 4-2-3-1.\n\nMentality: Attacking\n\nPassing: Mixed\n\nTackling: Normal\n\nPressing: Yes\n\nOffside Trap: No\n\nCounter Attack: No\n\nMen Behind Ball: No\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Dortmund are a complete attacking unit. They no longer sit back, soak up attack, and break fast, which is why I did not use Counter Attack, as the team would go uber-defensive, not the rather proactive side Dortmund are now. Having passing as Mixed means that the players will also attack directly, making up their counter attacking play, while still playing short passes.\n\n1 - Roman Weidenfeller (40 games started)/Mitchell Langerak (3 games started)\n\nWhile Weidenfeller's decisions to rush outs aren't the best, he has played a rather unsung part in Dortmund's success this season, saving multiple penalties throughout the campaign. While Langerak isn't ready to replace Weidenfeller just yet, he has shown potential, for example his performance in the DFB-Pokal final against Bayern.\n\nPlayer role - Goalkeeper\n\nDefault settings\n\n2 - Lukasz Piszczek (41 games started)/Patrick Owomoyela (2 games started) & 3 - Marcel Schmelzer (35 games started)/Chris Löwe (8 games started)\n\nPiszczek enjoyed a fascinating season, combining with fellow Pole Jakub 'Kuba' Blaszczykowski to form a formidable right flank. He was named along with Lichsteiner of Juventus as the best right-backs of the 2011-12 season in Europe. Schmelzer was injured at the start of the season, and youngster Chris Löwe showed that he was ready for top-level football after being signed from 3. Liga side Chemnitzer FC after his attacking displays against HSV in the opening game of the season. Schmelzer eventually won back his place, and has kept the left flank safe for Dortmund while still showing he is capable of storming up the left flank and provide support to the attack.\n\nPlayer roles - Wing Back\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Team\n\nTackling: Team\n\nPressing: Team\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nSet pieces (A): Forward\n\n(D): Back\n\nFree Role: No\n\nForward Runs: Yes\n\nRun with ball: Yes\n\nHold up ball: No\n\nLong shots: No\n\nThrough balls: No\n\nCross ball: Yes\n\nMarking: Zonal\n\n5 - Neven Subotic (31 games started)/Felipe Santana (13 games started) & 6 - Mats Hummels (43 games started)\n\nHummels and Subotic were already regarded as one of the best centre-back pairs in Europe in the 2010-11 season, and they have continued to defend the goal for Dortmund. All 3 centre-backs are nightmares to their opponents, as all 3 of them are over 190cm in height. Apart from being solid centre-backs, they are also encouraged to play long balls, with an average of 7.3, 6.8, and 3.1 long balls per match played by Subotic, Hummels, and Santana respectively.\n\nPlayer roles - Ball Playing Defenders\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Long\n\nTackling: Team\n\nPressing: Team\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nSet pieces (A): Forward\n\n(D): Back\n\nFree Role: Yes\n\nForward Runs: No\n\nRun with ball: Yes\n\nHold up ball: Yes\n\nLong shots: Yes\n\nThrough balls: Yes\n\nCross ball: No\n\nMarking: Man\n\n4 & 8 - Sebastian Kehl (29 games started)/Ilkay Gündogan (25 games started)/Sven Bender (25 games started)/Moritz Leitner (4 games started)/Antônio da Silva (2 games started)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Klopp often rotated between his holding midfielders. Kehl is the more reserved one out of them all, often holding his place in midfield, while Gündogan and Bender provide more energy and forward runs. Leitner has showed his passing skills and vision in such position, while da Silva has been a decent back-up for the team. Along with Polish right-back Piszczek and centre-back pair Subotic and Hummels, Bender, Kehl, and Ilkay are the most prolific tacklers in the team.\n\nPlayer roles - Ball Winning Midfielders\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Long\n\nTackling: Committed\n\nPressing: Yes\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nSet pieces (A): Forward\n\n(D): Back\n\nFree Role: Yes\n\nForward Runs: Yes\n\nRun with ball: No\n\nHold up ball: Yes\n\nLong shots: Yes\n\nThrough balls: Yes\n\nCross ball: Yes\n\nMarking: Man\n\n7 - Kevin Großkreutz (32 games started)/Ivan Perisic (13 games started) & 11 - Jakub Blaszczykowski (Kuba) (28 games started)/Mario Götze (22 games started)\n\nWith Mario Götze, the right flank was always the more dangerous side. With Kuba, it's more or less the same. Mario Götze is the more skillful player, and Kuba is the pacey, hardworking player, but both have played important roles in Dortmund's attack.\n\nOn the left flank, Großkreutz is famous for being rather wasteful in individual scoring chances, but still gives Klopp an option to go ultra-defensive on the left with Schmelzer, which is important against teams such as Bayern Munich. While Perisic isn't the fastest winger Dortmund have, he is actually quite prolific in the air, which hints that he could be played up front in drastic situations.\n\nPlayer roles - Inside Forwards\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Direct\n\nTackling: Normal\n\nPressing: Team\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nSet pieces (A): Forward\n\n(D): Normal\n\nFree Role: Yes\n\nForward Runs: Yes\n\nRun with ball: Yes\n\nHold up ball: No\n\nLong shots: Yes\n\nThrough balls: Yes\n\nCross ball: No\n\nMarking: None\n\n10 - Shinji Kagawa (36 games started)\n\nArguably the most important player in the XI after Sahin left, Kagawa is the reason why Götze was forced out to the wing. Kagawa is famous for his intelligent movement and his ability to finish scoring chances. He also drifts to the wing to help out his teammates and exploit the opponent's defense. With Sahin away, he must also make up the loss with Kuba and Götze by being the creators of Dortmund. However, he contributes less to defending compared to the wingers.\n\nPlayer role - Inside Forward\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Direct\n\nTackling: Normal\n\nPressing: Team\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nSet pieces (A): Forward\n\n(D): Normal\n\nFree Role: Yes\n\nForward Runs: Yes\n\nRun with ball: Yes\n\nHold up ball: No\n\nLong shots: Yes\n\nThrough balls: Yes\n\nCross ball: No\n\nMarking: None\n\n9 - Robert Lewandowski (46 games started)/Lucas Barrios (4 games started)\n\nA strong, powerfully built number nine with exceptional ability to hold up the ball and play with his back to goal, Lewandowski's role in the Dortmund team isn’t only about scoring but freeing up space for the cluster of creative attackers buzzing around him. His touch and technique doesn't let him down, and his finishing and composure has improved in this season. Lewandowski is a very complete striker, which is probably why Barrios hardly got any game time this season.\n\nPlayer role - Complete Forward\n\nPSP Settings:\n\nPassing: Short\n\nTackling: Team\n\nPressing: No\n\nPass to: R/L/C\n\nFree Role: Yes\n\nForward Runs: Yes\n\nRun with Ball: Yes\n\nHold up Ball: Yes\n\nLong Shots: Yes\n\nThrough Balls: No\n\nCross Ball: No\n\nMarking: None\n\ngood guide mate, but i think schalke are a better side to play, more depth and as much quality. 2 goalies fahrmann and unnerstall...awesome defenders and world class on the attack with draxler, farfan, obasi, holtby and HUNTELAAR (as a target man you won´t find better). I admir they look like they don´t have any quality names at defensive mid, with youngsters like hoger or moritz; but given time they will improve a lot.\n\nas for borussia: in the game (FM12) barrios is better than lewandowski, götze, can still be a flop realisticly speaking, but great at the game, despite hidding a bit at times from the game. Pisczek, schmelzer and gundogan aren´t as good as you would think, but the surprise is that leitner, koch and perisic are actually quite good. don´t get me wrong pisczek and co are good but.... Perisic is better than grosskreutz, kagawa is excellent; bender and kehl as well, but you don´t have a BIG squad, i like to play with a tight squad but i doubt there are many like me.\n\nNow my thoughts on schalke squad\n\nfahrmann is better than unnerstall, but unnerstall has more potential. Now who are you going to play, enjoy the doubt!!\n\nuchida - is an excelent right back, he is your man there, you could add a cover right back like lamotte, a free agent, just to rest uchi a bit, the board will tell you that lamote´s buy is an aberration, but you shouldn´t bother really, he is just going to play a very few low profile games.\n\nFuchs - like uchi is a wing back, a bit impredictable from time to time, but he is you´re best left back, you should give escudero a dozen games and he will perform at a good level, that way you can rest fuchs a bit.\n\nHowedes - is the player you should use the most, alongside papadoupoulos they are two very strong centre backs. howe is solid rock and papadopoulos is very close to him and they are without doubt your centre backs.\n\nMetzelder - is your cover he is experient and will go straight to team without giving you any major concern. a very useful old timer, DON´T GET RID of him.\n\nMatip - is the 4 central defender but i give him as many games as i can, as a ball winning midfield; and he does give me 8 and 9´s performances there, you should enjoy switching him to that position. I still haven´t played the enough number of seasons to say if he can become an anchor, but he is HUGE in that position. enjoy his rising!!!\n\nZambrano - loaned, back in the second season, looks good and his stats are developing fast with intensive trainning. a solution to the ageing Metzelder, gonna keep him because he looks pretty good.\n\nJones - is the general of the team, experient, hard tackling, solid and consistent. he does get a few red cards, so you ALWAYS should consider taking him off the field when he has a yellow card. but overall a massive defensive mid.\n\nHoger - is a young defensive midfielder, he is full of potential and can play at right back aswell, he is a bit unexperient, but with jones watching his back he tops his game, he will be far more better in his second year, when you´ll be able to leave him a bit more \"alone\" on the pitch.\n\nMoritz - I have no words for this young talent except AWESOME!! starts with a fair amount of 7´s, but, halfway trough the season he will make the midfield his. GREAT box to box midfield.\n\nKluge - no more than a squad rotation player, sell if you want, he can perform but you have enough central mids.\n\nFarfan - a danger on the wing, deadly crosses, he is great going through defenders, one of the most used players in my team and a very consistent one.\n\nmoravek - promissing young playmaker, loaned in the 1st season, he has great potential and very good stats already, should give him as much games as possible and help him to develop.\n\nDraxler - awesome on the wings right or left, though in the position menu he has the adv playmaker as his position ??? he is you«re best WINGER, a joy to have such a talent, and a possible bug here with his position?? a bit like Matip.\n\nRaul - a pensioner my ass!!!!!!! he plays like hell and gives that touch of magic you need to break defences, he is a great passing midfield and the creative force of your squad. should keep him 2 years at least (the time i´ve played).\n\nJurado - at number 8 position he is excellent, fades a bit at a more advanded position, has great technique skills, he is a bit light for the german league but still an excelent player.\n\nHoltby - started a bit inconsistent but then i finally got it, his best play is in the centre of the field, he can perform as a left mid or winger but you will notice. he is a number 10 and has enough flair to do the job, but he has to play a bit behind and with no pressure or with your team mentality set to attack, he needs very specific sets and gives you a bit of work, ENJOY ITT!!! hopefully he will be as good there as RAUL.\n\nBaumjohann - looked like the ugly duck but he is a very good cover and consistent performer, you can rest one of your wingers with this one without doubt. At major games you´ll probably see that ain´t as good as your other wide men, but you want him as a squad rotation player and he plays both wings, though is prefered is the right one.\n\nObasi - he has the tools to perform on the right side of the attack, but his drill is as a second forward, alongside Huntelaar. as a forward he WILL SCORE. rotate him a bit between positions, he is very useful in a situation that you have one striker and 2 wingers (one being him) to swap the formation with one that uses 2 strikers without using a sub.\n\nHuntelaar - Massive destruction with this one, GREAT!! GREAT!! Fcki...GREAT the best striker of the league, will pay you a beer if he doesn´t score at least the same number of goals than games played. if he scores one goal he will most likely score another, his confidence rises enourmously when he scores, if he doesn´t score untill the 75´ he probably won´t get a goal, but if he scores in the 1st he WILL double it, don´t believe me?? enjoy it!!! :-)\n\nMarica - can´t play alone upfront, he ain´t like that! you have to pair him with the HUNTER and he will perform, he is a good striker and i feel sorry for not giving him more time, he has a relatively low shooting for a striker....13 but he smells it and does score when he plays enough time.\n\nPukki - finnish striker, not sure if he is a finnish one?? confused?? then you know how i feel lol. He shows good potential,and he does improve his stats with trainning a lot but... can´t really say more because i´ve never played too much.\n\nOverall - physicaly a very enduring and strong side, capable of perform 2 games a week, a bit of magic on the attack, a clinical striker, good technical football only lacks bit of experience overall, and that´s why i recomend not to get rid of the more experienced players.\n\ntactics\n\nplan A\n\n4-1-2-2-1 - 4 defenders with wing backs, 1 defensive mid and 2 central mid, with their player roles set to their prefered individual ones, 2 wingers; if one of them is obasi you should consider swithing his role to inside forward, and a Striker with the target man role.\n\nattacking mentality - short passing - tackling commited - pressing yes and the rest set to no.\n\nat bigger games away switch mentality to balanced and passing to mixed, because that way a skilfull passing player like raul, holtby or jurado can launch a few counters, because they feel confortable making a long pass.\n\nI sometimes shake things a bit, when i have two physically strong players at central mid, and play a 4-2-3-1 with 2 central mids, 2 wingers a playmaker and a striker, or when i´m losing and time is passing.\n\nplan B\n\nthis is based in the principle that oposition knows you´re game, and, if you pay attention, they change formation to close you down and adapt to your tactis. So the plan B has to use completely diferent football principles than the A. in the A i use the wings putting there players who \"make my game\" offensively speaking. in the plan B i have to make my game through the middle of the park adding the creative players to the centre of the field and playing a 4-1-2-1-2 with 1 defensive mid, 2 central midfiels with at least one of them set to an attacking role, a playmaker and 2 strikers.\n\ni use a variation of this aswell with a 4-3-1-2 with 3 central mid or a plain 4-3-3 when the game is heading to a defeat.\n\nnote i don´t switch mentality, nor the passing. except in the situations i´ve already mentioned. They play pretty much the same way, but with diferent formations, that will help your players understand better the formations, and perform overall at the same level they were playing, when you changed the tactics."
