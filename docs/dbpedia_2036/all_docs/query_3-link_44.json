        "text": "Germany reached the World Cup final under Voeller\n\nGerman coach Rudi Voeller surprisingly selected Hanover 96 striker Thomas Brdaric for his squad for Euro 2004.\n\nBrdaric, 29, who has played only once for Germany more than two years ago, has scored 12 goals for his club in the Bundesliga this season.\n\nVoeller announced only 22 members of his 23-man squad, with the final player of the party - an Under-21 squad member - to be named before 2 June.\n\nThe favourite to go to Portugal is Cologne striker Lukas Podolski.\n\nVoeller said: \"Podolski has the best chance at the moment,\" Voeller said of the gifted 18-year-old forward who has scored 10 goals from 19 Bundesliga games.\n\nBrdaric was the second most prolific German national in the Bundesliga this season behind Hansa Rostock's Martin Max, who scored 20 goals but is 35 and plays no role in Voeller's plans.\n\nA member of the Bayer Leverkusen squad that reached the Champions League final in 2002, Brdaric won his only cap in a 4-2 win over the United States in a friendly in March 2002.\n\n\"He has been exceptional in the second part of the season,\" said Voeller.\n\n\"I've seen goals from him which I don't see often from other German players.\"\n\nBradic's selection means Bayer Leverkusen's Oliver Neuville, will not go to Portugal.\n\nVoeller has been under pressure to make changes after the 5-1 defeat by Romania in a friendly in April exposed the 2002 World Cup runners-up's limitations.\n\n\"There is enough quality in the squad to challenge even the greatest teams,\" said Voeller. \"It's a mixture of experience and youth.\"\n\nVfB Stuttgart's Timo Hildebrand won the battle to become the squad's third goalkeeper, behind Bayern Munich's Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann of Arsenal.\n\nVoeller could not pick seasoned midfielder Carsten Ramelow after the Bayer Leverkusen player said last week he was retiring from international football.\n\nAnother notable absentee is Bayern midfielder Sebastian Deisler, who resumed playing only recently after being treated for depression.\n\nGoalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, England), Timo Hildebrand (VfB Stuttgart)\n\nDefenders: Frank Baumann (Werder Bremen), Arne Friedrich (Hertha Berlin), Andreas Hinkel (VfB Stuttgart), Philipp Lahm (VfB Stuttgart), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Christian Woerns (Borussia Dortmund), Christian Rahn (Hamburg SV).\n\nMidfielders:Michael Ballack (Bayern Munich), Fabian Ernst (Werder Bremen), Paul Freier (VfL Bochum), Torsten Frings (Borussia Dortmund), Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool, England), Jens Jeremies (Bayern Munich), Sebastian Kehl (Borussia Dortmund), Bernd Schneider (Bayer Leverkusen)."
