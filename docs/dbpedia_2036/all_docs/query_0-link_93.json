        "text": "Borussia Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl concedes he \"doesn't know\" whether the club will be able to secure a permanent deal for Jadon Sancho.\n\nThe Manchester United outcast returned to his former club back in January having been frozen out under Erik ten Hag. Prior to that his form had been patchy at best during his two years at Old Trafford, but he's been a player reborn since heading back to the Bundesliga.\n\nSancho helped Dortmund enjoyed a surprise run to the Champions League final, playing regularly for the German outfit. As a result there is talk of a move back on a permanent basis, but Kehl is unsure whether they'll achieve that given his contract with the Red Devils and the lack of terms in his loan agreement.\n\nHe told TNT Sports when quizzed on their stance surrounding Sancho: “I don’t know yet, to be honest, because it was great to have him for the last six months. He increased our quality in the team and he’s looking forward to the final. He wants to win and everything else will be decided afterwards.\n\n\"The situation is pretty clear, he still has a contract at Man United, we have no buy option meaning we need to discuss and negotiate. I don’t know if that will work. But first of all, I hope that he will score one or two times tonight then the price will increase.”\n\nSancho was by no means a guaranteed starter at United with the club failing to see a consistent return on the £70million they spent to land him in back in 2021.\n\nThe player clashed with Ten Hag in the opening weeks of the season after a social media outburst from Sancho. Following that he wasn't even allowed to train with the first-team and the United boss later cited issues surrounding the winger before he was appointed.\n\nAs time has gone on the Dutchman looks to have softened his stance surrounding Sancho and has opened the door to a return with the player now heading back to Manchester after his loan expired.\n\n“Yesterday he showed why Manchester United bought him and why he represents a high value for Manchester United,” he said after Dortmund's semi-final victory. “That is good. I'm happy for Jadon, with his performance yesterday. We'll see what is going to happen in the future.”"
