        "text": "OFFICIAL: Youssufa Moukoko signs new deal at Borussia Dortmund until 2026\n\nâI was honoured by interest of other clubs, but ultimately it's a decision of the heart. Fans have always supported me, and I also want to give something back to them and the clubâ.\n\nThe goalscorer, who emerged from the BVB youth team, has made his breakthrough this season with 6 goals and 6 assist. A total of 11 Bundesliga goals are already on Moukoko's account. He is the youngest player to ever break the ten-goal mark in the German Oberhaus. A few days before his 18th birthday, he jumped on the 2022 World Cup train and was part of the German national team in Qatar.\n\nBorussia Dortmund striker Youssoufa Moukoko pens new deal to end interest from Chelsea and Newcastle\n\nThe 18-year-old's deal was expiring this summer, leaving European teams like Chelsea, Barcelona and Newcastle on red alert.\n\nEarlier in the week, Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl told Germany's Kicker magazine that the club had made a 'very attractive offer' and wanted an answer from Moukoko before Dortmund plays Augsburg on Sunday.\n\nAnd they have got their answer with the club confirming he has decided to extend on Saturday.\n\nHe will be earning in the region of Â£100,000-a-week though it's believed he could have got more in the Premier League.\n\nThe goalscorer, who emerged from the youth team, hasalready managed six goals and six assists this season.\n\nHe is the youngest player to ever break the ten-goal mark in the German league and is already a member of the national team.\n\n'Youssoufa is an exceptional player who we trained ourselves and in whom we still see huge development potential. So I'm happy that we were able to convince Youssoufa before the start of the second half of the season, which is so important for us, that he has the best prospects at BVB and that his path is far from over here.\n\nIt was important to us to be able to conclude the negotiations this week so that we all - and especially Youssoufa - can start the football year 2023 in peace and fully focused on the sporting challenges,' says Borussia Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl.\n\n'It's no secret that I feel good at BVB. I played in the youth teams, took my first steps in professional football here and now I'm ready to take the next step in my development together with the club,' says Moukoko.\n\n'I feel the trust of the coaching staff and I have an environment here in which I can develop perfectly,' he emphasizes: 'Of course I was honored by the interest of other clubs, but ultimately it's a heart decision. The fans have always supported me and I want to give something back to them and the club.'"
