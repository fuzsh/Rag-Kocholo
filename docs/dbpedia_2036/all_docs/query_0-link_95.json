        "text": "Germany's Niklas Sule stands prior to the start of the UEFA Nations League soccer match between Italy and Germany at Renato Dall'Ara stadium in Bologna, Italy, June 4, 2022. (ANTONIO CALANNI / AP)\n\nBERLIN - No one of Borussia Dortmund's new arrivals stands more for the determination to break the national dominance of rival Bayern Munich than Niklas Sule.\n\nWe can do it; the team has the quality to win this season's national title. I see the responsibility to walk ahead of the pack in some sort of leadership role.\n\nNiklas Sule, soccer player\n\n\"We can do it; the team has the quality to win this season's national title,\" said the man who has worn the Bavarians shirt for five years taking five titles before joining Dortmund.\n\nDespite the case of striker Sebastien Haller having pushed down everyone's mood to some extent in the pre-season training camp in Bad Ragaz of Switzerland, defender Sule remains positive regarding the season's outcome.\n\nHaller had been diagnosed with a testicular tumor only a few days ago. The former Ajax forward left for further medical surgery in Germany while his teammates continue to get in shape in advance of the league season opener on Aug 6 against Leverkusen.\n\nSule is backing the plans of sporting director Sebastian Kehl to gain consistency and create a higher amount of identification.\n\n\"I see the responsibility to walk ahead of the pack in some sort of leadership role,\" Sule said.\n\nExperience might help survive a tricky season containing a long break in-between due to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Sule stated.\n\nALSO READ: Manchester City to sign Haaland from Dortmund\n\nThe defender drew a picture of how the 2012 German champion can repeat its success from ten years ago.\n\nTo gain national and international glory in the Champions League, \"we need to close our back doors; that requires actions from the entire team,\" Sule added.\n\nSuccess needs leadership, he added. And leadership needs a cool head and experience.\n\nREAD MORE: Argentine striker Dybala joins Roma as free agent\n\nAfter signing three German internationals such as Karim Adeyemi and Nico Schlotterbeck aside from him, Dortmund has changed its transfer approach counting on consistency instead of only relying on the quality of international talents.\n\n\"The club's plan was the main point to convince me to join in from Bayern,\" Sule said."
