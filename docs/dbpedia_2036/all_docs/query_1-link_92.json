        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have confirmed the signing of full-back Yan Couto on an initial season-long loan deal from Manchester City.\n\nThe Brazil international joined City in 2020 and never made a first-team appearance but did impress in two loan spells at Girona either side of a season with Braga.\n\nHe joins Dortmund until June 2025 with an obligation to make the deal permanent for £25.3million.\n\nCouto said: “For me it’s a dream come true.\n\n“Borussia Dortmund is a special club. Every child in Brazil knows how great this club is, knows the fans and is fascinated by the Yellow Wall.\n\n“I can’t wait to wear the BVB shirt for the first time and experience the power and emotions in this brilliant stadium.”\n\nDortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl added: “Yan Couto is an extremely exciting player.\n\n“His development in Spain was remarkable and yet he still has plenty of potential to develop. He fits perfectly into the profile we were looking for this position.”"
