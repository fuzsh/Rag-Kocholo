        "text": "American soccer prospect Cole Campbell has signed a professional contract with Borussia Dortmund after playing in the German club's youth system, following the paths of United States men's national team stars Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna, who first emerged there.\n\nOriginally a member of Atlanta United's academy, Campbell moved to Europe in 2020 for a stint in Iceland, the home of his mother, before Borussia Dortmund snapped him up. He's been under the Borussia Dortmund umbrella since 2022. The 18-year-old's new senior contract could pave the way for him to appear in Bundesliga matches in the coming years.\n\nCampbell recorded 18 goals and 19 assists in 52 games for Borussia Dortmund's Under-17 and Under-19 teams. \"Cole is a difference maker in our U19 team,\" said sporting director Lars Ricken in a statement. \"His speed, his dribbling, his finishing and his mentality are qualities that make him special. We want to further promote his development, introduce him to the professional team and let him start with the professionals in preparation.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal makes history with goal against France at Euro 2024\n\nREAD MORE: Jurgen Klopp USA wage rule claim doesn't add up but obstacle still exists\n\nAdded sporting director Sebastian Kehl: \"Cole is a very young and extremely exciting player who has made a huge step forward with us in the past year. We see a lot of potential in him and are happy that we will take the next steps together.\"\n\nBorussia Dortmund famously identified Pulisic as a standout teenage talent, overseeing his development from a youth team player to a Bundesliga superstar who earned a mega transfer to Premier League team Chelsea. More recently, Reyna starred as a teenager at Signal Iduna Park, scoring 13 goals and producing nine assists for Borussia Dortmund before turning 20.\n\nPulisic and Reyna are now fixtures in the USMNT squad, appearing in this summer's Copa America. They will be in prime position to make the Stars and Stripes roster for the 2026 World Cup, too.\n\nREAD MORE: USMNT trolled by Jesse Marsch again as ex-Leeds boss takes another Copa America swipe\n\nSo, Campbell has reason to see Borussia Dortmund as a potential springboard for a successful career at club and international levels. \"It was a dream come true for me when I moved to BVB,\" he said in a statement on the Borussia Dortmund official website. \"Now I'm living this dream and have been working to improve myself since day one. I'm very happy and will continue to work hard to be successful at Borussia Dortmund.\"\n\nTechnically, Campbell could still choose to play for Iceland's national team, but an opportunity to join the USMNT setup might prove irresistible should he earn a camp invite."
