He won the 2021 German Cup shortly before joining United for a fee of 85 million euros ($93 million).\n\nAt Old Trafford, Sancho scored just 12 times in 82 appearances. He fell out with manager Erik Ten Hag earlier this season and came back to Dortmund in January having not played football since September.\n\nDortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl, who was crucial in bringing Sancho back to the club, said the Englishman showed his resolve during the testing time.\n\n\"It was not an easy situation in January to bring Jadon to Dortmund,\" Kehl said Tuesday.\n\n\"But we knew Jadon had the skills to perform, to be decisive and to bring us to another level.\n\n\"Jadon is such a great person, a great player, and the experience he had in Manchester helped him to perform now.\n\n\"He will be very important for us on Saturday. He will show the world that Jadon Sancho is really back.\"\n\n'Extra motivation'\n\nOnly one of Sancho's 23 England caps came after that Wembley final loss to Italy -- the same summer as he moved to United.\n\nHis uptick in form did not earn him a return to Gareth Southgate's extended, 33-man training squad for the Euros, which kick-off when home side Germany face Scotland in Munich on June 14.\n\nDortmund captain Emre Can said Sancho was \"first-class\", explaining \"he didn't play for six months so it's not easy to come back and perform like this.\"\n\nCan, who was left out of the Germany Euros squad, said the snub would motivate both players on Saturday.\n\n\"Of course he's not happy about it. I'm not in the Germany squad and I'm not happy about it.\n\n\"It gives you the extra motivation to show the coaches and national teams that we deserve to be there, and that's what we will try to do on Saturday.\"\n\nThe scale of the German side's task on Saturday is not only illustrated by a mammoth gap in silverware, with Real boasting 14 Champions League trophies to Dortmund's one.\n\nReal Madrid could afford to spend a fee in excess of 100 million euros ($108 million) to bring Jude Bellingham from Dortmund 12 months ago.\n\nThe England midfielder has been a revelation in the Spanish capital and has proven crucial in Real's La Liga triumph and their run to another European final.\n\nDortmund, who finished fifth in the league, 27 points behind Xabi Alonso's unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen, relied on loan deals as they re-tooled in January.\n\nAlongside Sancho, Dortmund brought in wing-back Ian Maatsen on a six-month loan from Chelsea.\n\nHis speed and control down the left flank has been crucial in allowing Sancho to flourish further up the pitch.\n\nMaatsen called Sancho \"an amazing player\" on Tuesday, saying \"we felt each other straight away on the pitch. The connection we have is very good.\""
