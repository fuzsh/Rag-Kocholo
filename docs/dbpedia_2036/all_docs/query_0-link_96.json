        "text": "In the wake of Bayern Munich‚Äôs recent unexpected defeat to Bayer Leverkusen, a powerful lesson emerges, not just for football but for all of us in any field. üí°‚öΩÔ∏è ‚ÄúDare to Zocken‚Äù: A Crucial Call for Creativity in Modern Football and Beyond ‚öΩÔ∏èüí° Creativity isn‚Äôt just an option; it‚Äôs the lifeblood of innovation. Thomas M√ºller‚Äôs frustration post-match echoes a larger, universal truth: when we lose the freedom to experiment, to ‚Äòzocken‚Äô, we lose our edge. üö´üé≤ https://lnkd.in/ehQiJCGi Leverkusen‚Äôs victory serves as a stark reminder that success often comes from the ability to be unpredictable, to embrace creativity even in high-stakes environments. While Bayern played by the book, Leverkusen danced outside the lines, proving that the courage to innovate often leads to triumph. üï∫‚öΩÔ∏è But it‚Äôs not enough to merely acknowledge this need for creativity. COGNIGOALS‚Äô approach, championed by Matthias Nowak and Professor Thomas Schack, shows us that creativity and cognitive agility can indeed be cultivated systematically. It‚Äôs a call to action for everyone, not just football teams: to foster an environment where innovative thinking and daring to be different are not just encouraged but celebrated. üß†‚ö° To truly change the game, whether on the football field or in the corporate world, we must encourage the wild, the unexpected. We must dare to ‚Äòzocken‚Äô. It‚Äôs time to rekindle the creative spirit, to transform our playing fields into canvases of endless possibilities. üé®‚öΩÔ∏è Let this be a clarion call to all: to coaches, to players, to professionals in every field. Cultivate creativity. Foster flexibility. Encourage each individual to think like a freethinker. Celebrate audacity and innovation, for it is in these moments that magic happens. ‚ú® In summary, let‚Äôs not settle for the status quo. Creative freedom isn‚Äôt just beneficial; it‚Äôs essential for breakthrough success. It‚Äôs what transforms good into truly great. Dare to be different, dare to innovate, dare to make your mark. üåç‚öΩÔ∏èüí° https://lnkd.in/eXeGHD6G #Innovation #CreativityInSports #Leadership #DareToZocken #FootballCulture\n\nTime for the #TFAArchives!

Analysis: Sebastian Kehl's right-hand man Slaven Stanic is removed at BVB after just 6 months - Analysis of BVB transfers and contrasting views on Sebastian Kehl: Football data analyst Paul Johnson vs my view, plus could Sven Mislintat be right again for Dortmund? The Black and Yellows are not having the best season. After missing out on the title on the last day at home, we've impressively reached the last 16 and in a challenging group which includes Newcastle and PSG. But in the league, the 8-time champions are in 5th position and ten points off leaders Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen. The Yellow wall is pretty unsettled right now... Transfer policies have been a source of criticism in the past two seasons, as the signings have been under-par by the club's outstanding standards. Sebastian Kehl, undoubtedly an admirable leader on the pitch, has only been in the post two seasons, but there have to be questions about some of the transfers on current performances alone. The jury seems to still be out on the sporting director. I took a detailed look at the transfers under Michael Zorc's replacement, in this piece for German Football News: :https://lnkd.in/e8MEeUsy To contrast, in this piece by Paul Johnson, a football data analyst, he contrasts the Kehl era with that of Paul Barber at Brighton Hove & Albion: https://lnkd.in/eJQ8kaDg Today the news trickles out that Sebastian Keh's right-hand man Slaven Stanic has been dismissed: https://lnkd.in/e-z5XaMQ The relationship appears to have been strained for for some time according to media reports, including club official media partner Ruhr Nachrichten. So are the BVB leadership taking a much harder and longer look at the work of the sporting director and recruitment? It would appear so... An candidate who did outstanding work at BVB, and would appear to be a possible replacement for Stanic, that is known to the leadership, is former Arsenal head of recruitment Sven Mislintat. Mislintat was released by Ajax, in what some regard as a rash decision by the club, from his role as Sporting director, a conflict of interest about a transfer seems to have been the reason. Sven, whose nickname at BVB was 'Diamanten Auge' (Diamond eye) for his ability to find outstanding talent, is available. So the question is after having been sporting director at Ajax what position could BVB offer Mislintat? For a detailed look at what Sven Mislintat's contribution at the Westfalenstadion was, including the players he brought in; in anticipation of Mislintat's signing at Ajax in May, I took a detailed look at the 11 years of Sven Mislintat at BVB on Ajax podcast 'Xtratalk': https://lnkd.in/eXXZYmtM #benmcfadyean #fussball #dortmund #bundesliga #germany\n\nTime for the #TFAArchives!

With it comes all of the media-reported machinations and this article (link in comments) is too good not to share regarding ‚Äúthe art of the deal‚Äù and how to extract the best value from a negotiation. Key insights include: - ‚ÄúKnow your enemy ‚Äì and know yourselves‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. [you need] an ability to step outside of your world and look at the other party's pressures, problems and opportunities‚Äù - Allow the other side to think they won - ‚ÄúIf you can walk away from a deal, it improves your power‚Äù. Don‚Äôt become over-wedded to do a particular deal. If you are, it will result in overpaying, so you need to have a clear walk-away price and an alternate option - Find the ‚Äúpower behind the throne‚Äù - ‚ÄúAct fast, think clear‚Äù All great reminders as we are in negotiations every day. #negotiation #deals #corporateadvisory"
