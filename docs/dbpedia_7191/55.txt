"Attack the Block" (2011)

"Wuthering Heights" (2011)

Andrea Arnold's unconventional re-imagining of Emily Brontë's classic novel strips away all the period-drama clichés we are accustomed to seeing when any Brontë is hauled over to the big-screen to create an immersive and incredibly daring drama that pushes beyond the well-known love story of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliffe.

Instead, Arnold uses the love between the two young northerners who are split by rank; and, most prominently in Arnold's adaptation, race to create a movie that offers up all the gothic spirit of the novel alongside the even darker history of British imperialism.

"Skyfall" (2012)

With MI6 now compromised from within, M (Judi Dench), the agency's head, creates an undercover cell with Bond to track down Silva (Javier Bardem), a dangerous villain from her past.

The movie follows an unnamed alien mutant (Scarlett Johansson) who inhabits the body of a young woman who trails the streets of Scotland in a van in search of unsuspecting prey.

"Dunkirk" (2017)

Christopher Nolan is best known for his raucous "Batman" thrillers but his greatest achievement thus far is the much quieter, but no less groundbreaking WW2 drama "Dunkirk."

Once again feeding his trademark obsession with time, Nolan crafts three interweaving stories to provide an emotionally engaging recreation of the evacuation of Dunkirk, which saw some 340,000 allied troops rescued from the beaches of Dunkirk after the German invasion.

"Dunkirk" is an emotionally satisfying spectacle delivered by a writer-director who is in total command of his craft with a richly talented ensemble cast to match.

Director Stephen Loveridge has known the British rapper M.I.A. for over 20 years. The pair have been friends since they were film students at Central Saint Martins in London.

And as a result, "Matangi/Maya/M.I.A." — the documentary Loveridge made about M.I.A.'s life, her rise to fame, and the myriad of controversies that have followed — manages to mix a uniquely critical lens with intimate access to the subject.

The documentary is woven together using a vault of never-before-seen footage spanning decades and provides an expansive look into the life of one of Britain's most inventive and controversial artists.

Archival footage and interviews with McQueen's closest friends and family offer insight into his extraordinary life and offer new context to some of his more controversial shows such as Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims and Highland Rape.

"McQueen" is a fitting tribute to a complicated artist of mesmerizing and profound genius.

But when a new servant named Abigail (Emma Stones) arrives at court a battle for the Queen's attention begins.

"The Souvenir" (2019)

Over the last decade, British writer-director Joanna Hogg has released three movies, all of them masterpieces, and "The Souvenir" is the first of two to make this list.

Slightly pushing past her trademark small-scale yet managing to keep the deeply intimate nature of her previous work, Hogg charts a stunning semi-autobiographical film about youth, love, and, cinema.

There is also a stunning, career-making performance from Honor Swinton Byrne daughter of Tilda Swinton — who is a lifelong friend of Hogg's — and also stars.

The movie was executive-produced by Martin Scorsese.

"Lynn + Lucy" (2019)

"Lynn + Lucy" is illuminated by a pair of masterful performances by Roxanne Scrimshaw (Lucy) and Nichola Burley (Lynn), two lifelong friends who have never ventured far from their childhood homes.

"Small Axe" (2020)

Steve McQueen's "Small Axe" — a name borrowed from a 1973 single by the Wailers ("If you are the big tree, we are the small axe") — is not a singular work but instead a collection of five separate films that explore the lives of people living in London's West Indian community between the early 1960s and the late 1980s.

The "Small Axe" collection is on this list not only because all five films are so good that they could all be cited individually, but because the collection together is an exceptionally acted and nuanced portrait of an underrepresented culture during a transitional time in history.

John Boyega, Letitia Wright, and Malachi Kirby star.

"Belfast" (2021)

Actor and director Kenneth Branagh drew from his own experiences growing up during The Troubles in Northern Ireland for 2021's "Belfast."
