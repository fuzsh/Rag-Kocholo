        "text": "Born: February 4 1915, Marylebone, London, England\n\nDied: October 4 2010, Abbotswood Nursing Home, Ballasalla, Isle of Man\n\nby PETER TATCHELL (copyright 2012)\n\nHe was the British cinema’s most successful post-war comedian as well as a West End and Broadway star and a top selling recording artist. And later in his career he starred in a number of popular television series. Norman Wisdom was multi-media and multi-talented … a physical clown, pantomime artist, musician, singer and laughtermaker supreme.\n\nBorn to a tragic home life, Wisdom found himself homeless as a youngster in London during the Depression and was forced to beg and steal to survive. Eventually he travelled to the west coast (apparently walking the whole way) and got a job as a cabin boy on a boat bound for South America. On his return he joined the army and in the process learnt to box and play a range of musical instruments.\n\nNorman was delighted to find he was also adept at physical comedy and could raise laughs with a pratfall or mime. Demobbed at the end of World War 2 his time spent in troop entertainment lead to career on the stage where the legendary Vera Lynn made sure the newcomer’s talent was fully appreciated when they shared a variety bill.\n\nWith his career increasing in popularity, Norman made a wordless cameo in the 1949 Terry-Thomas film A Date with a Dream, appearing for less than a minute with an extract from his one-man boxing routine. In contrast, four years later the Rank studio gave the variety performer the starring role in their comedy Trouble in Store. And overnight, Norman Wisdom became a top line star of the British cinema.\n\nPlaying a trouble-prone department store employee with a heart of gold, he was embraced by movie audiences who warmed to his “little man” persona in an ill-fitting suit whose slapstick tumbles provoked an onslaught of laughs.\n\nHis characterization was helped by having an ever reliable foil in the person of Jerry Desmonde, long time straightman to the great Sid Field (who’d died only a couple of years before). Desmonde would appear with Norman many more times over the next decade.\n\nThe film was also notable for the Wisdom-penned theme song Don’t Laugh at Me (Because I’m a Clown) which also proved a winner on the pop charts.\n\nTrouble in Store became a prototype for a series of similar roles, with Norman seen in a new Rank offering each year. He also became a sought after performer on stage at the London Palladium and other venues.\n\nWith his phenomenal bigscreen success, BBC Television signed Wisdom for several variety shows in 1956 and 1957, a year which also saw evergreen supporting player Edward Chapman joining the movie bandwagon in Just My Luck, in the first of five appearances as Norman’s long-suffering employer (invariably named Mr. Grimsdale).\n\nA year later, Wisdom played the lead in the West End musical Where’s Charley? (based on Charley’s Aunt) which also featured Jerry Desmonde in the cast.\n\nAmongst his film and stage commitments, Norman returned to the small screen in December 1961 for a highly talked-about appearance on the top-rating Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Joining host Bruce Forsyth as his sole guest (owing to an Equity strike that week) the pair took part in some fun-filled routines in what became the show’s most famous edition.\n\nIn 1964 Norman starred in the Anthony Newley musical The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd but the production failed to make it to the West End (though it eventually had success on Broadway without him). Wisdom did however make commercial recordings of a couple of the songs.\n\n1966 was a watershed year for Norman when he finally deserted the J. Arthur Rank movie cameras and crossed the Atlantic to headline the Broadway musical Walking Happy. A year later he starred with Noel Coward in a U.S. television special based on George Bernard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion. Then it was a tribute to the knockabout world of burlesque in the 1920s in the movie The Night They Raided Minsky’s, a part tailor-made to Wisdom’s style of physical comedy.\n\nBut, despite his burgeoning success in America, by the end of the decade Norman Wisdom abruptly returned home to Britain. His marriage had ended and he decided caring for his children was more important than maintaining his career in the U.S.\n\nNorman signed with ATV to star in a series of half hour shows on commercial television and for the next seven years was a regular on TV screens in his homeland.\n\nBy the 1980s, now in his mid-60s, Norman won critical acclaim for a dramatic role as a terminally ill patient in the BBC2 Playhouse special Going Gently. In later years, he’d also devote his acting talents to the long-running sitcom The Last of the Summer Wine.\n\nDespite his advancing years, Wisdom continued to perform energetic physical stunts in his touring stage show (and in 1986 made a successful cabaret tour of Australia).\n\nHis last years were capped by receiving a knighthood from the monarch who’d ascended to the throne about the time Norman first became a movie star in the early 1950s. And, true to form, he couldn’t resist amusing his sovereign with a mock stumble as he departed from the investiture.\n\nWhen Norman Wisdom died, aged 95 in 2010, the world lost a cherished funnyman and the last great survivor of an era of physical comedy which he’d outlived by half a century.\n\nFilms\n\nA Date With A Dream (1948)\n\nMeet Mr. Lucifer (1953)\n\nTrouble In Store (1953)\n\nOne Good Turn (1954)\n\nAs Long As They’re Happy (cameo, 1955)\n\nMan Of The Moment (1955)\n\nUp In The World (1956)\n\nJust My Luck (1957)\n\nThe Square Peg (1958)\n\nFollow A Star (1959)\n\nThere Was A Crooked Man (1960)\n\nThe Bullldog Breed (1960)\n\nThe Girl On The Boat (1960)\n\nOn The Beat (1962)\n\nA Stitch In Time (1963)\n\nThe Early Bird (1965)\n\nThe Sandwich Man (cameo, 1966)\n\nPress For Time (1966)\n\nThe Night They Raided Minsky’s (1968)\n\nWhat’s Good For The Goose (1969)\n\nRadio\n\nCHILDREN’S HOUR: BLACKPOOL PIRATES\n\nBBC Home Tuesday 5-00pm August 30 1949 (55 min)\n\nwith Charlie Chester, Arthur Haynes, Jewel & Warriss, Julie Andrews, Frankie Howerd, Norman Wisdom\n\nFINE GOINGS ON (series 1)\n\nBBC Light Thursday 7-30pm FORTNIGHTLY January 4 to July 5 1951\n\nwith Frankie Howerd, Marjorie Holmes, Bill Fraser, Norman Wisdom\n\n(script: Eric Sykes)\n\nSUNNYSIDE UP\n\nBBC Light Thursday 7-30pm September 27 1951\n\nwith Max Bygraves, Norman Wisdom\n\nROBBING HOOD\n\nBBC R2 Tuesday 7-00pm July 21 to August 25 1992\n\nwith Norman Wisdom, Moira Lister, Windsor Davis, James Grout\n\ntributes\n\nTHE LAUGHTERMAKERS: Norman Wisdom BBC Home Friday 1-10pm February 22 1957\n\nTHE NORMAN WISDOM STORY\n\nBBC Home Tuesday 7-30pm February 28 1961 (60 min)\n\nhosted by David Nixon\n\nA WEALTH OF WISDOM\n\nBBC R2 Wednesday 10-00pm April 22 to June 10 1987 (15 min) Norman Wisdom reminisces with Michael Pointon\n\nNORMAN WISDOM: A CAREER\n\nBBC R2 Friday 1-00pm April 9 1993 (60 min) Norman Wisdom reminisces with Roy Pickard\n\nDON’T LAUGH AT ME – NORMAN WISDOM’S FIFTY YEARS OF LAUGHTER\n\nBBC R2 Tuesday 9-00pm June 2 1998 (60 min)\n\nDON’T LAUGH AT ME – NORMAN WISDOM AT 90\n\nBBC R4 Tuesday 11-30am July 13 2004\n\nhosted by Marc Riley\n\nTelevision\n\nWit and Wisdom\n\nBBC October 18 1948 (45 min)\n\nBBC August 30 1950 (45 min)\n\nCuckoo College\n\nBBC May 13 1949 (60 min)\n\nVic’s Grill\n\nBBC (fortnightly) April 18 to June 27 1951 (6 x 30 min)\n\nThe Norman Wisdom Show\n\nBBC February 27 1952 (60 min)\n\nNorman Wisdom\n\nBBC July 27 1952 (20 min)\n\nThe Norman Wisdom Show\n\nBBC October 6, November 3 and December 1 1956 (3 x 60 min)\n\nBBC September 21 1957 (60 min)\n\nAndrocles and the Lion\n\nNBC November 15 1967 (90 min)\n\nNorman\n\nITV/ATV April 2 to May 7 1970 (6 x 30 min)\n\nNobody is Norman Wisdom\n\nITV/ATV June 26 to August 7 1973 (6 x 30 min)\n\nA Little Bit of Wisdom\n\nseries 1: ITV/ATV April 9 to May 21 1974 (7 x 30 min)\n\nseries 2: ITV/ATV January 10 to February 14 1975 (6 x 30 min)\n\nseries 3: ITV/ATV March 30 to May 11 1976 (6 x 30 min)\n\nIt’s Norman\n\nITV/ATV December 28 1974 (60 min)\n\nThe Norman Wisdom Show\n\nBBC2 December 29 1976 (35 min)\n\nPlayhouse: Going Gently\n\nBBC2 June 5 1981\n\ntributes\n\nJust Wisdom\n\nC4 December 27 1986\n\nThe South Bank Show\n\nITV August 22 1993\n\nHeroes of Comedy\n\nC4 September 25 1999\n\nLegends\n\nITV August 30 2000\n\nNorman Wisdom – His Story\n\nBBC October 15 2010\n\nRecordings\n\nMelancholy Serenade / Serenade to a Wealthy Widow\n\nH.M.V. 78rpm POP 141\n\nI Don’t ‘Arf Love You / Narcissus (both with Joyce Grenfell)\n\nColumbia 78rpm DB 3161\n\nDon’t Laugh at Me / Once in Love with Amy\n\nColumbia 78rpm DB\n\nBeware / Dream for Sale\n\nColumbia 78rpm DB 3654\n\nNorman Wisdom\n\nColumbia EP SEG 7612\n\nBeware\n\nDream for Sale\n\nDon’t Laugh at Me\n\nOnce in Love with Amy\n\nYodelee!
