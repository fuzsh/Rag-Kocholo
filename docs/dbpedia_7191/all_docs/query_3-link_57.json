        "text": "For this movie week in August, we’ll see if a video game movie can continue raising the quality average, if the female moviegoing audience is ready for something different, and whether or not Neon will have more successful horror results soon. That said, plenty of streaming options as well. This set of write-ups includes a martial arts film, a British crime flick, a quirky comedy, a shark movie, a dialogue-driven drama, and a scandalous thriller. The following features reviews for Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In, Duchess, Running on Empty, The Last Breath, The Way We Speak, and The Girl in the Pool.\n\nTwilight of the Warriors: Walled In: 7 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: Many years after the bloody turf war that ushered in an uneasy era of peace in Hong Kong’s underworld, the notorious Kowloon Walled City serves as a fortified, lawless safe haven for gangs and refugees alike. But when a skilled underground fighter runs afoul of the most feared Triad boss in Hong Kong, a bounty is placed on his head despite his connections to the leader of the infamous enclave. As his pursuers violate the tenuous territorial truce to exact their vengeance, the fallout reignites old grudges, bringing decades of building tension to a brutal, bloody boiling point.\n\nReview: This Hong Kong martial arts flick is stuffed to the gills with ideas, production design, characters, and, of course, action, and it ultimately comes out on top in the realm of good times to have with a wild assortment of stuff. Operating as an ode to the Hong Kong action movies of the 80s (with a hint of Gangs of New York thrown in for good measure), it would be enough to simply watch the various dramatic scenes play out, knowing there was plenty of action to come. However, director Soi Cheang managed to take things one step further and inject a bit of spirituality into the mix as well, resulting in even more challenging action sequences occurring in a manner I didn’t expect.\n\nGiven the budget, it’s no surprise that I admire all the effort put into building out this elaborate world, and I very much appreciate how this walled city means verticality is a significant component in the action as well. All of this is me saying the film has plenty of great designs and choreography to work with, making up for a narrative that isn’t always the most compelling in a movie that lasts a bit too long. Even then, among the many talented players, Sammo Hung is here, still showing off his moves and adding a level of credence that makes this whole ordeal sit right.\n\nWhere To Watch: Opening in theaters on August 9, 2024.\n\nDuchess: 6 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: A small-time crook (Charlotte Kirk) tries to enter the treacherous underworld of diamond trafficking and ends up left for dead when a deal goes wrong. Determined to seek retribution, she launches into an unwavering pursuit for vengeance.\n\nReview: It’s been a bit of a rough road for Neil Marshall as far as finding the acclaim he had received early on for films like The Descent or Dog Soldiers. After knocking out memorable episodes in various high-profile TV shows (Game of Thrones, Westworld, etc.), his return to film hasn’t been the strongest. Duchess is a bit of an outlier in terms of the kinds of material he works on. Still, as a Guy Ritchie-lite crime film about the British underworld, I had a decent time with this. Once again starring and co-written by his partner, Charlotte Kirk, a key to enjoying this film is embracing the tone and style of the movie period it is indebted to. Duchess doesn’t have everything one needs as far as a brilliant feature goes, but if one is asking for a solid cast, some fun banter, and the occasional action scene that balances fun and tension well, I appreciated what Marshall was able to deliver.\n\nWhere To Watch: Opening in UK cinemas on August 9, 2024, and on digital starting August 12.\n\nRunning on Empty: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: Mortimer (Keir Gilchrist) is an odd but clever young man living a lukewarm existence in California’s San Fernando Valley until he receives some life-changing news. Determined to make the most of every day, Mort sets out on a spirited quest to find meaning in his existence and discovers the girl of his dreams along the way.\n\nReview: Sometimes, it’s hard to know what to make of an offbeat movie trying to establish a very specific concept with dark implications despite limitations in budget and a fairly light presentation. Director Daniel André sets up a near-future world where people can learn the exact day they are supposed to die. With this conceit, the choice to have us follow a milquetoast protagonist who becomes embedded in a crime-related subplot alongside a familiar rom-com scenario with Lucy Hale leads to a mixed bag of results. Gilchrist is playing entirely within his wheelhouse, but outside of the threats presented to him, as an actor, there’s not much he does to rise to the occasion. A film like this could be helped by the supporting players Jay Pharoah and Jim Gaffigan, but they feel more like fun additions shot quickly instead of actual ways to amplify the story being told. While dramatic urgency is a clear part of what’s happening, the strange tone and presentation didn’t quite tip this film in my favor.\n\nWhere To Watch: Opening in select theaters on August 9, 2024.\n\nThe Last Breath: 4 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: Finding the long-lost wreck of the warship USS Charlotte has been the lifelong pursuit of Levi (Julian Sands), an aging expat running a tourist dive business in the British Virgin Islands together with college dropout Noah (Jack Parr). When the USS Charlotte emerges for the first time in eighty years after a tropical storm, Noah’s friends visiting the island insist they all do a once-in-a-lifetime dive on the newly discovered wreck. The dream dive rapidly turns into a nightmare as they become trapped in the darkness of the Charlotte’s interior, thirty meters down and with a dwindling air supply. And then they discover that they are not alone.\n\nReview: I’m always willing to check out at least a couple of shark movies a year, and while Under Paris delivered its own version of goofy fun, The Last Breath wasn’t quite as successful. Sure, it’s the more realistic of the two in terms of setting (to a point), but between the irritating characters and a general sense of blandness when it comes to making this premise more exciting, I didn’t quite swim away feeling much delight here. Credit where it’s due, director Joachim Hedén put his actors in scuba gear and has them performing underwater for long stretches. For a movie like this, without the biggest of budgets, it is a demonstration of solid filmmaking as far as grounding this story in some sort of reality. Still, some compelling moments aside, it feels fairly generic and less fun than it could have been. Basically, The Last Breath lacks bite.\n\nWhere To Watch: Now available in select theaters and on VOD.\n\nThe Way We Speak: 7 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: Simon (Patrick Fabian), an up-and-coming writer, refuses to leave the spotlight when his best friend and debate opponent suffers cardiac arrest, leading to an obsession over his new opponent (Kailey Rhodes) and a growing rift with his ailing wife (Diana Coconubo).\n\nReview: Color me impressed. I’ve had plenty of fun seeing Fabian’s work on Better Call Saul, where he played Howard, one of Saul’s professional nemeses. Now, I have a film that squares the focus entirely on a character well within Fabian’s wheelhouse. That said, when given a chance to explore a figure with evident loathsome qualities, as well as enough going on in the way of intelligence and a life outlook that doesn’t automatically create a sense of resentment, it’s clear an effective study of humanity can occur.\n\nDirector/writer Ian Ebright gets a terrific performance out of Fabian by allowing him to play a character that is perhaps familiar but also given enough reasons to empathize. The circumstances of this film allow it to be structured as a series of days with a debate at the center. The sparring matches between Fabian’s character and an effective Rhodes are exciting, but the ideas and circumstances crafted around those events are equally compelling (and the undercurrent of grief provides at least one character some extra cover). This all amounts to an effective psychological study of the mind space occupied by a man experiencing several dilemmas while trying to hold onto some ego-driven level of respectability. It’s not at all hurting that quite a few fun zingers are scattered throughout. Good movie.\n\nWhere To Watch: Now available on VOD.\n\nThe Girl in the Pool: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Setup: On his birthday, Tom’s (Freddie Prinze Jr.) life collapses when his mistress is found dead in his pool. Terrified of the consequences and desperate to protect his family, he conceals the truth, triggering a chaotic night that threatens to unravel his perfect life.\n\nReview: Call it morbid curiosity, but Quiver has been doing well by me as of late, and the prospect of seeing an older Freddie Prinze Jr. attempting to hold his own in a Hitchcock-inspired suburban thriller was enough to have me press play. Here’s the thing, The Girl in the Pool is bad, but bad in a fun sort of way. I’m not saying, “It’s so bad it’s good,” but director Dakota Gorman has accidentally found her way into getting something workable out of the over-the-top performances on display, which work hard to deliver some cruddy dialogue. If anything, so much of the darkly (maybe unintentional) humorous tension on display could have benefited from directorial choices that would align it more with the master of suspense.\n\nFor example, while the film is divided awkwardly by flashbacks, attempting some real-time, one-shot staging would give the movie more for the viewer to play with (while more clearly acknowledging Rope as a clear inspiration). Other ideas for what to do make no difference, as I am ultimately judging the movie I watched. However, I am torn, as the film is often laughable yet not ineffective. Seeing Prinze have to square off against his character’s father-in-law (played with amusing insulting wit by Kevin Pollak) is just one of the ways this film sparks to life every so often. This film is no Hitchcock, let alone a Fatal Attraction, but it had a goofy spirit that I appreciated.\n\nWhere To Watch: Now available in select theaters, VOD, and digital."
