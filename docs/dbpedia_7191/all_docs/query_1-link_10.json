        "text": "Silent Generation\n\ndemographic group\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 15, 2024, 5:22 AM ET (Newsweek)\n\nDonald Trump's Losing Baby Boomers, Silent Generation to Kamala Harris\n\nSilent Generation, generation of people sandwiched between the “Greatest Generation,” which fought World War II, and the “baby boomers,” the generation born during the surge in births in the United States and other countries in the years immediately following the war. The range of birth years ascribed to the Silent Generation varies slightly according to the generational scheme employed, beginning with either 1925, 1928, or 1929 and ending with either 1942 or 1945. In the early 2020s the Silents were mostly in their 80s and 90s.\n\nConstituting roughly 50 million individuals in the United States, this generation was both less populous (owing to diminished birth rates in the 1930s and ’40s) and, at first blush, seemingly less dynamic than the larger-than-life generations that bookended it. Sometimes also called “Traditionalists,” the members of this cohort are generally characterized as cautious conformists who sought stability, worked hard, and thrived by not rocking the boat in an era of booming postwar economic prosperity. But a closer look reveals a rebellious tendency that slowly emerged across the social, political, and cultural landscape during the years in which they came of age—roughly the late 1940s to the early 1960s—even if it was rebellion more grounded in reforming the system rather than in tearing it down.\n\nConsensus culture\n\nChildhood in crisis\n\nChildhood for the Silent Generation came in a time of crisis. The youngest Silents grew up with both the extreme economic deprivation of the Great Depression (including, for some, Dust Bowl dislocation) and the terrifying upheaval of World War II. Scarcity was ubiquitous, first as a consequence of widespread unemployment and lack of income, then as a result of rationing to abet the war effort. Frugality was the essential strategy; delayed gratification was the corollary consequence. Both attitudes influenced the Silents’ response to the world, even in better times.\n\nThe Lucky Few\n\nYet, as the Silents came of age, the U.S. economy not only rebounded but also went into overdrive, entering a period of tremendous expansion and prosperity. Indeed, another of the sobriquets bestowed upon the Silents is the “Lucky Few,” because at almost every stage of their lives they have been well positioned to take advantage of the economic opportunities that have opened up for them. As the postwar economy heated up, industry and commerce needed young workers, and the Silents were there to fit the bill. Moreover, it has been argued that because they were not a numerically large generation, the Silents could command high wages and salaries in a relatively scarce labour market. Similarly, they exploited low mortgage rates to become homeowners early in adulthood and capitalized on generous pension schemes to fortify their futures.\n\nBig business\n\nThe Silents entered the job market in an era of institutional growth. Ever-expanding corporations were at the centre of American economic life, and manufacturing was booming. Big business was king. From most indications, the Silents enthusiastically embraced the stability offered by corporate employment, whether behind a desk or on the assembly line. Although members of the Silent Generation fought in the Korean War (1950–53), Silents are often depicted as having been in awe of the returning war heroes of the Greatest Generation, seemingly content to cast their lot with the institutions that were being reshaped by the preceding generation.\n\nTaking no chances\n\nTwenty-first century depictions of the Silent Generation frequently reference a pair of magazine articles from the era that characterized the worldview of the Silents and established the received understanding of them. Often evoked is a Fortune article, “College Class of ’49,” which found that most “Forty-Niners” aspired to a happy family, a comfortable home, and two automobiles. Even more frequently cited is a Time essay from November 1951, “The Younger Generation,” which popularized the term “Silent Generation”:\n\nYouth today is waiting for the hand of fate to fall on its shoulders, meanwhile working fairly hard and saying almost nothing. The most startling fact about the younger generation is its silence. With some rare exceptions, youth is nowhere near the rostrum. By comparison with the Flaming Youth of their fathers & mothers, today’s younger generation is a still, small flame. It does not issue manifestoes, make speeches or carry posters. It has been called the “Silent Generation.”…Almost of itself, it has picked up the right instincts from an American tradition older than its parents: it wants to marry, have children, found homes, and if necessary, defend them.\n\nHome and family\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe desire to build families was central to the zeitgeist of the Silents. On average they married younger and had children younger than any generation to date. Their aspiration to homeownership was indirectly aided by the G.I. Bill (Service Readjustment Act of 1944). While they were largely unable to capitalize on the no-money-down low-interest loans available to veterans to purchase homes, the Silents benefited from the resulting boom in the construction of affordable housing in suburbia in places such as the planned community of Levittown, New York, where, it was said, a new prefabricated house was completed every 16 minutes at the height of a construction frenzy that began in 1947.\n\nConformity and McCarthyism\n\nThe Time article also emphasized Silents’ tendency to conform:\n\nThere is also the feeling that it is neither desirable nor practical to do things that are different from what the next fellow is doing.\n\nUnquestionably this conformity was partly conditioned by the Silents’ arrival at the outset of the Cold War, in the era of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. Beyond the belief that one got ahead by playing by the rules, there was a fear that unusual behaviour or dissenting opinions would be viewed as un-American. More than just being marginalized, those who had been members of or sympathetic to the Old Left were being dragged before congressional committees and compelled to acknowledge whether they had ever been a member of the Communist Party, encouraged to identify communists among their friends and associates, and blacklisted from employment. Not everyone was paranoid about communists having supposedly infiltrated the State Department or worried that secret subversives were hiding in plain sight, ready to corrupt American youth, but “right-minded” consensus and cheerful conformity ruled the day during most of the administration of Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–61).\n\nQuiet desperation\n\nYet for all the commitment to straight-and-narrow meritocratic striving and the supposed contentment with the relatively staid lifestyle to which it gave rise, there was an undercurrent of dissatisfaction among the Silents, a sense of lives being lived in the “quiet desperation” Henry David Thoreau identified a century earlier. Among those to call attention to it were academics, journalists, and novelists.\n\nThe Lonely Crowd\n\nEven before the Time article hit the newsstands, in 1950 sociologist David Riesman and collaborators Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney published The Lonely Crowd. In it they argued that the bureaucratized society of big business and big institutions was fostering the replacement of the inventive, “inner-directed” individuals of earlier generations with “other-directed” conformists, who looked not inside themselves but to others for their values and approval and who, in the process, were becoming dispirited. Getting ahead, according to Riesman, had less to do with what one thought or did than how one was perceived by others.\n\nThe Organization Man\n\nWilliam H. Whyte, a business writer for Fortune, made similar observations in his book The Organization Man (1956). In evaluating contemporary corporate culture, Whyte concluded that the rugged individualism, creativity, and entrepreneurship that he believed had long been pivotal to American achievement was losing out to the notion that organizations were better able to solve problems than individuals were and thus were better suited to steer society:\n\nOnce people liked to think, at least, that they were in control of their destinies, but few of the younger organization people cherish such notions. Most see themselves as objects more acted upon than acting—and their future, therefore, determined as much by the system as by themselves.\n\nThe men in the gray flannel suits\n\nDissatisfaction with corporate life is at the centre of Sloan Wilson’s novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955), in which a series of crises compel the titular protagonist (taken from the corporate uniform of the day) to reexamine the value of the blind pursuit of an existence based on received aspirations and approved creature comforts. Set in 1955, Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road (1961) covers similar ground, focusing on a married couple that longs to leave behind a boring job and escape their cookie-cutter suburb. And Holden Caulfield, the preppie protagonist of J.D. Salinger’s landmark The Catcher in the Rye (1951), is enraged by “phonies” and “phoniness.”\n\nFrom a whisper to a scream\n\nAs the 1950s progressed, a significant portion of the Silent Generation chose to break out and strive to change their world, not only through art but also through social and political engagement.\n\nThe Beats\n\nThe most overt rejection of the postwar culture of consensus and conformity came from the Beat movement of poets, novelists, and other bohemians who both withdrew from and protested against a society they found to be joyless and purposeless. They demonstrated their alienation by adopting a style of dress, manners, and “hip” vocabulary borrowed from jazz musicians and sought release and illumination in drugs, jazz, sex, and Zen Buddhism. Jack Kerouac’s novel On the Road (1957) offered a vision of an alternative lifestyle; Allen Ginsberg’s poem Howl (1956) was the boisterous, indignant antithesis of silence.\n\nThe civil rights movement\n\nWhen the Silents came of age, Jim Crow was still alive and well in the American South. In the North discriminatory practices such as redlining and restrictive covenants kept Black and brown aspirants to the “good life” from taking advantage of the explosion in suburban housing. But by the mid-1950s the American civil rights movement was in full swing, and many of its principal leaders were members of the Silent Generation, most notably Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Ralph Abernathy, and Jesse Jackson. Rosa Parks was a member of the Greatest Generation, but her defiant refusal to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott, came on December 1, 1955, in the middle of the Silents’ ascendance.\n\nLeveling the playing field\n\nWhen the Greatest Generation’s Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball’s colour barrier in 1947, he opened the door to a legion of supremely gifted Black athletes from the Silent Generation, including fellow baseball players Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, and Bob Gibson; basketball’s Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, and Elgin Baylor; tennis players Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe; decathlete Rafer Johnson; sprinter Wilma Rudolph; football’s Jim Brown, Jim Parker, and Gale Sayers; and boxers Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, and Joe Frazier.\n\nAmong the other great athletes of the Silent Generation were Mickey Mantle, Sandy Koufax, Al Kaline, Bob Cousy, Bob Pettit, Jerry West, Pancho Gonzales, Billie Jean King, Bob Mathias, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Alan Ameche, Johnny Unitas, Bart Starr, and Dick Butkus.\n\nThe playboy and the feminist\n\nMembers of the Silent Generation also had a significant impact on gender roles in American society. In 1953 Silent Hugh Hefner featured a nude photo of iconic actress Marilyn Monroe (also a Silent) in the first issue of Playboy magazine. By legitimizing female nudity in what became a mainstream publication, Hefner theoretically contributed to the so-called sexual revolution of the 1960s while reinforcing the hegemony of the male gaze, but another member of the Silent Generation, Gloria Steinem, would become a powerful countervailing feminist force as one of the world’s most prominent leaders of the women’s liberation movement.\n\nFilm noir\n\nAt the height of the Silent Generation’s influence, most married women continued to work in the home, but the influx of women in the workforce during World War II had a lingering effect on the male psyche. One reflection of that effect was the emergence of the femme fatale (French: “fatal woman”) in film noir, the genre of stylized films characterized by pessimism, fatalism, and menace that were popular from the 1940s to the mid-1950s. The threat posed by the femme fatale seemed to imply that strong women were dangerous. The cynicism and muddled morality of film noir conveyed a complex worldview that flew in the face of the straightforward good-versus-evil model favoured by those enthralled by consensus.\n\nRebels without a cause\n\nThe Hollywood movies of the era also offered images of youthful rebels. When asked what he is rebelling against, Marlon Brando’s feisty biker in The Wild One (1953) says simply, “Whaddya got?” James Dean’s angst-ridden teenager in Rebel Without a Cause (1955) is anything but at home in suburbia. Dean was a Silent; Brando was born one year too early.\n\nHowever, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie Wood, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, Jane Fonda, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Audrey Hepburn, Woody Allen, Steve McQueen, Shirley MacLaine, Warren Beatty, and Mel Brooks all were members of the Silent Generation.\n\nRock around the clock\n\nMembers of the Silent Generation were also America’s first teenagers, the new sociodemographic group that arose with postwar prosperity, blessed with disposable cash, leisure time, and a surfeit of youth-oriented products to purchase. Along with clothes, soft drinks, and drive-in burgers, pop music vinyl records were at the top of their shopping lists. The eureka moment of rock and roll is often debated, but, if it is predicated on the fusion of rhythm and blues (R&B) and country music (and not just on the advent of white people playing R&B), a good argument can be made for the recording of “That’s All Right, Mama” by Elvis Presley at the Memphis Recording Service in July 1954.\n\nElvis was a Silent and so were most of the first wave of rockers and rockabillies, including Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Wanda Jackson, and Johnny Cash. But the Silent Generation also reached to encompass later rock icons such as members of the Beach Boys, the Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield, along with Bob Dylan,Simon and Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Janis Joplin, and, across the Atlantic, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe “Godfather” and “Queen of Soul,” James Brown and Aretha Franklin, respectively, were also Silents. So were Sam Cooke, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, the Temptations, and the Supremes. Most of the participants of the folk revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s were also Silents, catalyzed by the release of Harry Smith’s Anthology of Folk Music (1952). Early-born Silents, though, likely were more partial to the pop stylings of Patti Page, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis, and the Four Freshmen.\n\nFinally, a Silent president\n\nMany of the movers and shakers of the tumultuous 1960s, it turns out, were not boomers but Silents. Even the Chicago Seven (with the exception of David Dellinger), the political activists famously tried for their anti-Vietnam War activities during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, were Silents. Yet, after the failed runs for the presidency by Silents such as Jack Kemp, Michael Dukakis, and John McCain, and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy during his presidential bid, it looked as if no member of the Silent Generation would occupy the White House—that is, until the election of Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nJeff Wallenfeldt"
