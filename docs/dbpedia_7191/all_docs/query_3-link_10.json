        "text": "After studies in English literature, Jon Amiel graduated from Cambridge University and ran the Oxford and Cambridge Shakespeare Company, which often toured the USA. He became the Hampstead Theatre Company's literary manager and began directing there, relocating to the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nAmiel joined the BBC as a story editor, studied television directing and did TV work through the late 1970s and early 1980s, scoring attention in 1985 with _Silent Twins, The (1985)_, an unforgettable recreation of the tragic \"silent twins\" June and Jennifer Gibbons, who spoke only to each other. Airing during the same year Marjorie Wallace's non-fiction book The Silent Twins (1986) was published by Prentice Hall), the docudrama was the BBC's selection for entry at the Locarno and Montreal Film Festivals.\n\nAs noted in Stephen Gilbert's biography of Dennis Potter, Amiel was working on The Silent Twins (1986) when Kenith Trodd gave him the six Singing Detective scripts. After international acclaim for Der singende Detektiv (1986), Amiel's feature film debut, Liebe, Rache, Cappuccino (1989), premiered at Cannes, was named Best First Film at the Montreal Festival and won the Birmingham Festival's Best British Feature Film Award. Amiel's Julia und ihre Liebhaber (1990), based on Mario Vargas Llosa's Aunt Julia And The Scriptwriter, won the Deauville Festival's Prix Publique. He followed with the period drama Sommersby (1993), the thriller Copykill (1995), Agent Null Null Nix (1997) and moved into action-adventure with Verlockende Falle (1999) and The Core - Der innere Kern (2003).\n\nRichard Ellef Ayoade was born in Hammersmith, and grew up in Suffolk, in England, the son of a Norwegian mother, Dagny Amalie (Bosvik), and a Nigerian father, Layide Ade Laditi Ayoade. He studied Law at Cambridge university, and followed in the footsteps of British Comedy legends like Monty Python's Eric Idle, Hugh Laurie and Graeme Garden when he became the president of the Cambridge Footlights club.\n\nAyoade's first real TV break was directing, co-writing and starring with Matthew Holness in the cult classic Garth Marenghi's Darkplace (2004) a parody of shlocky 1980's science fiction television shows, and noticed for it's \"so bad it's good!\" aesthetic. Notably shy and self-effacing in interviews, his performance as the debauched, self-assured publisher/pornographer/nightclub owner 'Dean Learner' showcased the young comedian's acting talent.\n\nAfter cameos in another cult series The Mighty Boosh (2003) as the shaman \"Saboo\", his position in the popular consciousness was cemented in the series The IT Crowd (2006) where Ayoade played the social oblivious, dweebish savant known as \"Moss\".\n\nAll the while Ayoade continued to direct music videos for Vampire Weekend, Kasabian, and the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs before finally getting his chance to direct a feature film, Submarine (2010), based on the novel by Joe Dunthorne.\n\nSubmarine was followed by The Double (2013) co-written by Avi Korine and based on a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\nKenneth Charles Branagh was born on December 10, 1960, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to parents William Branagh, a plumber and carpenter, and Frances (Harper), both born in 1930. He has two siblings, William Branagh, Jr. (born 1955) and Joyce Branagh (born 1970). When he was nine, his family escaped The Troubles by moving to Reading, Berkshire, England. At 23, Branagh joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he took on starring roles in \"Henry V\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\". He soon found the RSC too large and impersonal and formed his own, the Renaissance Theatre Company, which now counts Prince Charles as one of its royal patrons. At 29, he directed Henry V. (1989), where he also co-starred with his then-wife, Emma Thompson. The film brought him Best Actor and Best Director Oscar nominations. In 1993, he brought Shakespeare to mainstream audiences again with his hit adaptation of Viel Lärm um nichts (1993), which featured an all-star cast that included, among others, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton and Keanu Reeves. At 30, he published his autobiography and, at 34, he directed and starred as \"Victor Frankenstein\" in the big-budget adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel, Mary Shelleys Frankenstein (1994), with Robert De Niro as the monster himself. In 1996, Branagh wrote, directed and starred in a lavish adaptation of Hamlet (1996). His superb film acting work also includes a wide range of roles such as in Celebrity - Schön, reich, berühmt (1998), Wild Wild West (1999), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), Operation Walküre - Das Stauffenberg-Attentat (2008) and his stunning portrayal of Laurence Olivier in My Week with Marilyn (2011), where once again he offered a great performance that was also nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nPaddy (Patrick) Considine was born on September 5, 1973 in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire in the U.K. As a teenager, Considine studied a drama course at Burton College where he met with now friend and director Shane Meadows, who cast Considine in his first role in a feature film as the disturbed character Morell in A Room for Romeo Brass (1999).\n\nConsidine's performance in that movie got him cast in Pawel Pawlikowski's Last Resort (2000) the following year. Further roles ensued, including an acclaimed turn as Johnny in Jim Sheridan's In America (2002).\n\nAlong with his lead roles, Considine has had a number of scene-stealing supporting roles in films such as 24 Hour Party People (2002), Born Romantic (2000), and The Martins (2001). Considine has been noticed for his performance as Richard the revengeful brother in the applauded film Dead Man's Shoes (2004), which he co-wrote with Shane Meadows, and for his role as Phil the Born again Christian in Pawlikowski's My Summer of Love (2004).\n\nIn 2005, Considine co-starred with Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger in Das Comeback (2005). Other notable roles in recent years include small-but-memorable turns in Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis (2007) and Das Bourne Ultimatum (2007), along with bigger roles in [error] and Submarine (2010).\n\nConsidine has also recently tried his hand at writing and directing. His feature-length directing debut, Tyrannosaur - Eine Liebesgeschichte (2011), won Considine a BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer.\n\nConsidine has one child, Joseph, with wife Shelley.\n\nJulian Farino was born and raised in London and educated at Cambridge University. He began directing film documentaries at Granada Television in England, including One of the Girls about drag queens in Manchester and The Gift based on the famous Chethams College of Music. They Call Us Nutters was a fly on the wall observation of psychopaths in a maximum security hospital, the first time access had been granted, and Savage Skies was about the coldest inhabited place on earth, Oymyakon in Eastern Siberia, where temperatures fell to -55C.\n\nIn 2000 he directed 7 Up 2000, featuring 7 year olds from all over Britain, a project that will continue as 14 Up in 2007. He has directed film drama in the UK since 1997, including an adaptation of Charles Dickens Our Mutual Friend which won 4 BAFTAs including Best Drama. Bob and Rose, a romantic comedy by Queer as Folk writer Russell T Davies won Best Series at The British Comedy Awards, and Flesh and Blood starring Christopher Eccleston won the Prix Europa for Best Film.\n\nHe made the feature film The Last Yellow for BBC Films, which starred Samantha Morton, and most recently Byron, also for the BBC, with Jonny Lee Miller and Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nHe came to America to do two episodes in the last season of Sex and the City for HBO, and as well as Entourage has also directed Rome for HBO. He lives mostly in London with his wife, the actress Branka Katic and two sons Louis and Joe."
