        "text": "Beginning with the premise that neo-Victorian films and television programmes set in the late-Victorian era offer especially rich objects of study for those interested in gender and sexuality, this article explores how masculinity is constructed and problematised in Sherlock Holmes (2009), Crimson Peak (2015), Ripper Street (2012-2016), and Penny Dreadful (2014-2016). These representations of masculinity are marked by uncanniness, pervasive tensions, and liberatory possibilities, and enriched by generic and visual features. They depict the public sphere as the principal site for masculinity's definition and expression, while linking voyeurism with violence and investigating how distinctions between England and America influence masculine identity and desire. As these representations critique the masculine valorisation of exploration and conquest, they demonstrate how men's success in the public sphere is undercut by failure in the private one. They thereby make familiar markers of manliness unfamiliar, and empower women. By portraying men who both exemplify and cope with the many dimensions and ever-changing nature of masculinity, Sherlock Holmes, Crimson Peak, Ripper Street, and Penny Dreadful address twenty-first-century viewers whose world has been changed by significant shifts in gender roles and responsibilities, thus enabling men cathartically to experience and resolve a return of repressed anxieties about what it means to be a man.\n\nThe films American Beauty directed by Sam Mendes , and Boyhood directed by Richard Linklater present seemingly conflicting forms of masculinity: the modern and outdated, techniques such as comedy, satirisation, parody and tragedy to emphasise which is to be emulates and which to no longer serves it function. There is, under the surface, a reoccurring narrative that as America modernises, the traditional constructs of masculinity leave middle-class white men as inadequate members of society; emasculated and dysfunctional. Before focusing on the presentation of white middle class male, with stable finances, a nuclear family and a lucrative career that is supposed to bring fulfilment, within American cinema, it is necessary to first define several terms within this essay. The term masculinity will refer to a set of traditions or traits associated with what society deems to be a ‘true male’ who takes full advantage of their high social positioning, which results from confirming to patriarchal values. Whilst it could be seen that these traditions and traits change over time, they mostly stay within the existing constraints imposed by society which are harder to transform and redefine some traits no longer functional for the time.\n\nWhile the notion of ‘cult’ film or TV is, today still, widely debated, the very nature of ‘cult’ and its underpinning gender bias remains secondary. Nonetheless, analysing this (often toxic) ‘masculinity’ is vital to rediscover cult’s past and improve its future. To understand the ‘masculinity of cult’ and the issues it brings to light, it is important to research its origins: they are deeply rooted in historical power structures that have been described, with the development of feminism, as patriarchal.\n\nThis volume offers a unique exploration of how ageing masculinities are constructed and represented in contemporary international cinema. With chapters spanning a range of national cinemas, the primarily European focus of the book is juxtaposed with analysis of the social and cultural constructions of manhood and the \"anti-ageing\" impulses of male stardom in contemporary Hollywood. These themes are inflected in different ways throughout the volume, from considering how old age is not the monolithic and unified life stage with which it is often framed, to exploring issues of queerness, sexuality, and asexuality, as well as themes such as national cinema and dementia. Offering a diverse and multifaceted portrait of ageing and masculinity in contemporary cinema, this book will be of interest to scholars and students of film and screen studies, gender and masculinity studies, and cultural gerontology."
