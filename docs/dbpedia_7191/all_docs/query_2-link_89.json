        "text": "First, we propose a definition for a Fictional Robot (FR). In this paper a Fictional Robot is an artificial entity that can sense and act as a result of a (real-world or fictional) technology and played a role in at least one movie. By this definition, aliens such as “E.T.” are not consider as FRs because they are not artificial entities. Also, the toy characters in the Toy Story series and characters like Pinocchio are not FRs either, because the reason behind their acting and sensing are magical and not technological (not even a fictional technology).\n\nAfter identifying fictional robots, they were categorized regarding their roles, applications, and design. The fictional robots were studied in three categories: Appearance design, Artificial Intelligence and interactive design, and Ethical and social design, which are described in further detail below.\n\nLet us classify fictional robots into seven applications and use these categories to classify FR throughout the article. Figure 2 presents the number of 108 investigated fictional robots in each category. Some robots had military or security jobs and were tagged as “Soldiers”. “Caring and Entertaining robots” are classified as one group, while “Space Assistant robots” are located in another independent group. General-service robots are classified into two groups in this paper depending on if it remains as a service robot until the end of the plot or exits this duty, we refer to them as the “Servant” and “Freedman”, respectively. In some other movies, robots are created to be “Immortal Humans”, like “David” in A.I. (2001). Finally, the last group includes robots that are “Not Human-Made” independent creatures.\n\nExamples for each of these 7 categories are presented below:\n\nSoldier: “T-1000” in Terminator 2 (1991) or “Chappie” in Chappie (2015)\n\nCaring & Entertainment: “Baymax” in Big Hero 6 (2014) or “Hosts” in West World (2016)\n\nSpace Assistant: “R2-D2” in Star Wars (1977) or “TARS” in Interstellar (2014)\n\nServant: “Samanta” in Her (2013) or “Arthur” in Passengers (2016)\n\nFreedman: “Andrew” in Bicentennial Man (1999) or “Sonny” in I’ Robot (2004)\n\nImmortal Humans: “Tachikoma” in Ghost in the Shell (1995) or “Alita” in Alita; Battle Angel (2019)\n\nNot Human-Made: Robots in Transformers (1984) or Robots (2005)\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, fictional robots usually play the role of a service assistant or soldier (47%). Also, in 15% of the investigated films, robots that served as service assistants at the beginning of the story, but leave their assigned task through the main story of the film (i.e., categorized as the Freedman).\n\n3.1 Appearance design\n\nThe appearance design of fictional robots was selected as an important factor to be investigated in this paper [24]. In general, the appearance design of fictional robots can be divided into the five main categories below (with some real-life robot examples):\n\nHuman-like: Robots that are quite similar to humans in shape and look, such as Sophia, first citizen robot of the world [25].\n\nMetallic Humanoid: Humanoid robots with metallic parts and other obvious machine-like components, such as the Boston Dynamics’ Atlas [26].\n\nNon-Metallic Humanoid: Humanoid robots with a non-metallic shell, it should be noted that most real social robots are built in this way, such as the Arash Robot [27].\n\nNon-Humanoid: Animal-like robots and other robots with non-human-like components, such as most currently available social robots, i.e., Jibo [22] or Keepon [28].\n\nNon-Unique Body: Artificial intelligence entities without a single physical body, such as current voice assistants, i.e., Apple SIRI, Microsoft Cortana, etc. [29].\n\nA diagram of the fictional robot’s appearance vs. their application is presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen, most common fictional robots are Metallic Humanoid (usually representing Soldiers) and Human-like robots (usually representing Immortal Humans).\n\nIn the next section, we look closer at the FR appearance design through five different sub-categories: Material Selection, Detail Visibility, Uncanny Valley, Transformation, and Name/Gender.\n\n3.1.1 Material selection\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, most of the robots are displayed with a humanoid appearance. On the other hand, 85% (63 out of 74) of the humanoid fictional robots are created with metal. Some are displayed with a metallic appearance, and those robots which usually wear natural skins (e.g., “Mechas” in A.I. (2001)) show their metallic understructures (at least once). This fact reveals the audience's expectation of seeing robots as metallic beings. In the real world, however, the expansion of rapid prototyping technology and the cost-effectiveness of plastic has given most real social robots a plastic appearance [30,31,32,33,34]. Observing the function of non-metallic fictional robots (as it is shown in Fig. 3) shows that they are often used for care and entertainment purposes. For example, the “Baymax” care robot in the Big Hero 6 (2014) has an inflatable vinyl outer shell that, in addition to being flexible, enables hugging function and safe physical contact.\n\n3.1.2 Detail visibility\n\nExamining fictional robots shows that filmmakers are very interested in detailed designs, especially for metal robots. In Chappie (2015) and Robots (2005), we can see many details in the robotic character’s design. Additionally, almost all fictional humanoid robots have a mechatronic face; however, in the real world, the use of flat displays or static helmets for the robot's face is common practice [34, 35].\n\n3.1.3 Uncanny valley\n\nIn the world of cinema, as in the real world, the Uncanny Valley phenomenon [36] is a common challenge in robots’ design. Some movies (such as Uncanny (2015)) have even chosen this challenge as their main theme. When a humanoid robot’s appearance is too close to a human, it causes fear and discomfort in the audience [37]. Hence, fictional humanoid robots’ designers often design intentional signs in their robots so they can be easily distinguished from humans. For example, in Humans (2015–2018), this difference is the specific color of the humanoid robots’ eyes (synths have shiny green eyes). An android passing as a human is one of the most common puzzles in sci-fi movies, and is often used as a surprise twist in the plot.\n\n3.1.4 Transformation\n\nOne attractive feature of a fictional robot is its shape-shifting ability. This feature is so popular that the Transformers (1984–2019) franchise is entirely based on this idea. Fictional robots sometimes try to deceive their audience by changing their shape, and sometimes they use this unique feature to do a certain job or cross through specific portals.\n\n3.1.5 Name and gender\n\nAs a case of anthropomorphism, the general audience tends to assign a gender to robots for better communication. This gender will be more believable with a wise choice of parameters such as appearance design, name, and tone of voice [37]. Figure 4 shows the gender distribution of the fictional robots of this study.\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4, approximately half of the fictional robots in the movies we studied are just male (~ 50%). In 12 cases, we see the robot in both genders. Also, in some cases, they are sexless, often non-humanoid robots. We observed that no female robot was portrayed as a space assistant, which may be a sign of an existing male-oriented mentality in the field.\n\nThe names chosen for fictional robots are also interesting. Examining the names shows that most fictional robots working in technical environments (in 70% of Soldiers and 100% of Space Assistants examined) have abbreviated names with numbers (such as “C3-PO” and “R2-D2” in Star Wars (1977)), while human-like robots often (in 75% of Human-likes examined) have short, easily pronounced human names (such as “Ava” in Ex Machina (2014)). This fact is also seen in real-world robot applications [31, 34 and 35].\n\n3.2 Interactive design and artificial intelligence\n\nThe robots’ intelligence level and their capabilities for human interaction is an always-challenging topic in fictional robots. We categorized the fictional robots into four levels in terms of artificial intelligence, including instrumental intelligence, duty intelligence, environmental intelligence, and self-awareness. These levels are further defined and described in the following section (Fig. 5).\n\nInstrumental Intelligence: Ability of being manually operated to quickly and accurately control actuators and the inclusion of feedback sensors,\n\nDuty Intelligence: Ability to carry out a mission, taking into account all environmental uncertainties,\n\nEnvironmental Intelligence: Ability to make decisions based on circumstances and conditions,\n\nSelf-awareness: Self-awareness and self-rule.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, cinematographers are less interested in robots with limited levels of intelligence. This may be because the challenges of human–robot interaction, and therefore an interesting plot for a story, only arise in higher levels of artificial intelligence. In contrast to fiction, most real robots are still limited to instrumental intelligence, and many technical challenges remain in areas such as reliability, accuracy, etc. [34, 38]. In the following section, we studied fictional robots in four subsections referred to as Human-like Interactivity, Superhuman Interactivity, Fictional AI, and Cyborgs.\n\n3.2.1 Human-like interactivity\n\nIn order for robots to be able to live among humans, they need to adapt to human living conditions and be able to interact with humans. Fictional robots are no exception to this rule. Hence, one of the obvious characteristics of humanoid robots in most movies is the obvious/definite ability to establish human-like interactions. Of the 74 fictional humanoid robots examined, 68 (i.e., 92%) had the ability to interact with humans at an almost human level. From this we predict that after observing the humanoid appearance and skill of these fictional robots, the general public has come to expect fully human-like interaction ability from future robots. It should be noted that this prediction needs more surveys by the help of questionnaire analysis.\n\n3.2.2 Superhuman interactivity\n\nMany fictional robots can be distinguished from humans because of their advanced sensory capabilities, which we refer to as “superhuman interactivity”. Sci-fi writers often try to make their fictional robots superior to humans by giving them special sensory-motor abilities. The most common superhuman interactivity (found in 42 of the observed movies) is advanced image processing, such as accurate lip-reading (“HAL” in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)) or sophisticated online processing (fast medical scanning of “Baymax” in Big Hero 6 (2014)).\n\n3.2.3 Fictional AI\n\nBy investigating the characters of artificial intelligence in science fiction films, we can conclude that verbal interaction (i.e., the recognition and synthesis of speech) is considered a necessary ability for an AI entity. Moreover, the entity’s ability to speak gives it an identity and personality, and processing the correct speech tone makes it sound commanded and obedient. This is in line with the importance of natural language processing in real-life artificial intelligence reported in [39].\n\nAnother human-like ability the audience expects to see from an AI entity is its ability to learn. An advanced fictional AI entity can easily learn new concepts and topics and improve themselves [15]. The subject of robot learning has also received a great deal of research attention in recent years, and several methods have been developed to achieve this ability for robots/machines [40,41,42].\n\nMoreover, although Humans are limited in terms of information processing and storage, the fictional robot’s access to information (using the Internet or even other fictional networks) is almost unlimited, and in some cases, robots are given unlimited control of other digital entities. This feature is more common in bodiless robots. For example, in I, Robot (2004), a central AI called \"VIKI\" with the full control of all other robots is trying to take over the city.\n\nIn addition, sci-fi movies rarely try to address real-life engineering challenges, such as the memory and information management challenges found in real-world robots [43]; however, in few movies, such as the Next Gen (2018) animation, this issue is observed when the robot is forced to erase his memories due to memory overload.\n\n3.2.4 Cyborgs\n\nAlongside robots, fictional cyborgs also play a role in some sci-fi movies. A cyborg is a human with attached robotic plugins or limbs, or at its most radical level, a human brain controlling a whole robotic body. In our movie database, 27 out of 134 movies (i.e., 12%) addressed cyborgs. Among them, RoboCop (1987) and Alita: Battle Angel (2019) are widely known examples.\n\nIn movies and stories, cyborgs are the best form to address the centuries-old theme of the clash of human nature and machinery. Although connecting a human brain to a robotic body or artificial limbs to a human is an extremely challenging process with our current knowledge and medical limitations, sci-fi writers consider it common practice and portray cyborgs as the perfect examples of this clash of humanity and machinery (i.e., Ghost in the Shell (1995)).\n\n3.3 Ethical and social design\n\nToday, with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and social robotics [31, 44], the issue of the ethical and social design of robots has become very important [27]. In recent years, several articles have been published by psychologists and sociologists studying the ethical standards and issues in robot design [23]. Similarly, sci-fi writers have shown a great deal of concern for the potential moral challenges of advanced robotics, especially from a human–robot interaction perspective. Also, they may employ fictional robots as metaphorical tools to discuss human ethical challenges. Several of the most important ethical features observed in fictional robots (including Desire for Survival and Evolution, Loyalty, Emotions and Personality, and Robot Abuse) are presented in the following section. Of course, different movies approach these areas with different and diverse viewpoints, i.e. in some movies robots/humans are seeking eternal life while in others they refuse eternal life for different reasons (such as Andrew's rejection of immortal life in Bicentennial Man (1999)).\n\n3.3.1 Desire for survival and evolution\n\nOne can claim that the first goal of any living creature is to survive. Fictional robots, when they reach the level of environmental intelligence or self-awareness, consider themselves living beings, and this desire to survive also arises in them. The desire to survive leads the robot to begin to experience emotions such as fear, and the desire for evolution leads to the emotion of greed. For example, in A.I. (2001) and Her (2013), we see a desire for survival and evolution, respectively. These tendencies can cause war or serious conflict between humans and robots when an artificial intelligence entity, sees the destruction of humans (certain humans or humanity as a whole) as the first step of robots’ survival or evolution, i.e., 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and I, Robot (2004), respectively.\n\nAlthough the audience expects a self-aware robot to have a desire for survival and evolution, having creativity and the ability to dream is not expected from a robot. Hence, this occurrence could be surprising in movies like Chappie (2015) and I, Robot (2004).\n\n3.3.2 Loyalty\n\nAccording to our review, 49 out of the 59 fictional robots that play a servant or assistant role showed considerable loyalty to their owners and only ten servant robots violated this loyalty. In some cases, this is due to their limited task intelligence, but sometimes it is due to their ingenuity. For example, the fidelity of the robot in Robot & Frank (2012) is due to its conscientiousness, while the fictional robot in The Iron Giant (1999) learns to be loyal after befriending humans.\n\nAlso, the audience usually expects robots to be obedient, lawful, and insensitive entities. Also, a loyal robot must be value-oriented (i.e., Chappie (2015)) and self-sacrificing (i.e., The Iron Giant (1999)).\n\nAlternatively, one can categorize fictional robots according to their overall behaviors (e.g., good, evil, both, neutral, and a tool). Figure 6 presents the distribution of the robot’s overall behavior in the investigated dataset. It should be noted that we could not classify the robots’ behaviors for 8 FRs and use the label “unclear\" in for them Fig. 6.\n\n3.3.3 Emotions and personality\n\nIf we accept that being able to act and express feelings, through changes in facial expressions, a change in tone of voice, and so on, means a robot has real feelings, we can then claim that the imagination of sci-fi writers has come true. It is also obvious that many human personality traits can be loaded into the robot's artificial intelligence in the form of computer codes [45]. This kind of coding was seen abundantly in the reviewed films. In some movies, such as Eva (2011) and Interstellar (2014), we see the ability to customize the robot’s emotions and personality parameters, a feature now seen in real social robots such as KIKI [46].\n\nMoreover, in the reviewed movies, there is a strong relationship between having memory and having human-like emotions, including memory retrieval helping robots to have deeper and stronger emotions (i.e., The Iron Giant (1999), losing memory being equal to losing personality and emotions (i.e., Wall-E (2008)), and injecting human memories into a robot causing it to have the same emotions (i.e., Astro Boy (2009) and West World (2016–2020)), etc. These observations are in line with real-life studies on long-term human–robot interactions in which having long-term emotional relations and personality is linked to having a good memory and remembering their shared memories in subsequent encounters [47, 48]. This type of capability is provided in a limited version in the real social robots like Cozmo [49].\n\nAn important lesson to learn from these movies when designing a robots’ emotion and personality, is that although a robot’s feelings and personality is artificial, a person's feelings toward a robot can be quite real (Her (2013)). This issue is a main theme in movies which include fictional robots as adopted children or lovers, such as A.I. (2001) and Eva (2011).Interestingly, de Graaf [50] also claimed that human–robot interactions are constructed based on the human–human interaction rules.\n\n3.3.4 Robot abuse\n\nMost fictional robots are depicted as man-made creatures, and therefore, are considered inferior to their human creators [51]. As an immediate result of this unique relationship, humans feel a mixture of feelings toward their creations: superiority, love, fear, pity, etc. Some, as a result of negative emotions behave tyrannical, indifferent, and sometimes abusive toward their own creatures [52,53,54]. Examples of this kind of cruel behavior are depicted in movies such as A.I. (2001) and Humans series (2015–2018)."
