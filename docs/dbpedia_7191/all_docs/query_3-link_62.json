        "text": "You may know Sammy Leung as the host of your favourite Hong Kong radio show or TV variety show, or from his acting in films. Better known as Sum-mei, he’s co-presented with Kitty Yuen for most of his radio career.\n\nPachinko, the story of four generations of a Korean emigrant family in Japan, continues to offer the very best in top-tier melodrama as season two unfolds on Apple TV+.\n\nOnce a penniless, deadbeat husband and father, Ji Jin-hee returns from the dead a rich landlord and sets out to woo afresh his wife (Kim Ji-soo) in romantic comedy Romance in the House on Netflix.\n\nThe Alien franchise gets a new addition, a heist thriller with three members of Cantopop band Mirror is available to stream, and a deadbeat husband returns from the dead in a new K-drama comedy.\n\nWith Alien: Romulus seeing the series’ return to form, we rank the entire franchise from worst to best, including the Alien vs Predator films, Prometheus, the classic original, and the new movie.\n\nAnother K-drama based on corporate corruption? Surely not? But Auditors stands out with its solid plot and a strong performance from Shin Ha-kyun, who plays corporate auditor Shin Cha-il.\n\nGingle Wang plays a young woman who has recently died and is trying to prove herself worthy of being a ghost by going through contests and auditions, in John Hsu’s screwball comedy.\n\nAs a director, Corey Yuen gave Michelle Yeoh her debut, was one of the first to feature Jean Claude Van Damme, and steered Jet Li’s career. He was also an action choreographer and actor.\n\nHong Kong actor and artist Karl Ting explores identity, love and societal pressure in his first solo show of paintings, “Who Are You?”, on display at an art gallery in the city’s Sheung Wan neighbourhood.\n\nBritney Spears, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen are all subjects of upcoming biopics. What’s going on? As superhero movies tank, musicians’ life stories are taking their place in cinemas.\n\nJung Eun-ji, a member of K-pop girl group Apink and an actress, reflects on fantasy romcom Miss Night and Day, in which she co-starred with Parasite’s Lee Jung-eun. She calls Lee ‘a great sister’.\n\nCantopop’s greatest, from Leslie Cheung to Faye Wong and Leon Lai, have put down tracks in Hong Kong’s Avon Recording Studios, which opened in 1983. We join a tour of the storied hit factory."
