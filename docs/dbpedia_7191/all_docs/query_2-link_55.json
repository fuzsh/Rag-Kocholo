        "text": "Warner Bros.\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- One thing both good and bad movies can have in common are memorable quotes.\n\nAll it takes is a few seconds to make your mark on cinema history.\n\nOur list of the 50 greatest movies quotes since 2000 comes from films you can easily remember and a few your don't. Some are Oscar winners. Others are just plain bad.\n\nEither way, you'll remember where you were the first time you heard many of these lines. [Note, we kept it at one quote per movie]\n\nNow, let's put a smile on that face!\n\n50. \"Release the Kraken!\"\n\nClash of the Titans (2010)\n\nThe 2010 remake of \"Clash of the Titans\" is a bloated affair with so-so special effects and a slow moving story that isn't all that memorable. But it does have a great one-liner that played into the film's marketing from the very beginning. Kudos to the filmmakers for milking \"Release the Kraken\" for all it's worthy.\n\nFox Searchlight\n\n49. \"I'm already pregnant. So, what other shenanigans could I get myself into?\"\n\nJuno (2007)\n\nEllen Page's sarcastic humor and deadpan delivery in \"Juno\" is the highlight of the film. In fact, it's one of the best acting performances of the 21st century. Her ability to poke fun at her character's pregnancy in \"Juno,\" makes her endearing. It's hilarious too.\n\nParamount\n\n48. \"Which would be worse, to live a monster or die as a good man?\"\n\nShutter Island (2010)\n\nThe end of \"Shutter Island\" is heartbreaking and serves two purposes. When Leonardo DiCaprio's character Teddy asks the question, \"Which would be worse, to live a monster or die as a good man?\" he is creating quite a moral debate, while also revealing his characters tragic intentions.\n\nDreamWorks\n\n47. \"I know who I am. I'm the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!\"\n\nTropic Thunder (2008)\n\nIt feels weird to suggest the greatest performance of Robert Downey Jr.'s career came with him in blackface. But he totally owns it. The ridiculous of his movie character in a movie within a movie is comic gold. So when he suggest, \"I'm the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude,\" you just kind of get it.\n\nMGM\n\n46. \"Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't.\"\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nOddly enough it kind of makes sense. Well, not really. But that was the beauty of Elle Woods. She was so endearing her own strange logic felt genuine. And endorphins are for real.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n45. \"That's a bingo!\"\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nThe character Hans Landa is so magnetic in \"Inglorious Basterds\" because of the contrast between his actions and words. He's a ruthless man who will kill at will, Yet, his go to catchphrase (that's as shocking as anything he does) is the comical \"That's a bingo!\" Really, coming from that guy?\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n44. \"I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this.\"\n\nThe Martian (2015)\n\nA quote that made you appreciate your run of brutal high school science classes. Matt Damon's declaration, in the most informal way possible, that he's going to have to apply some serious science to save his life, is the line in \"The Martian\" that demands you root him on.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\n43. \"That's my secret, Captain: I'm always angry.\"\n\nMarvel's The Avengers (2012)\n\nYou spend most of \"The Avengers\" wondering what's the secret Bruce Banner uses to keep The Hulk away. The answer is perfect. He's not meditating or found some new form of yoga that elevates his mind and body. He just stays angry all the time. How clever.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n42. \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time.\"\n\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nDominic Toretto's motto is flawed and ultimately leads to his undoing. But it's what makes him cool. He's living in the moment, even if the future could potentially be terrifying.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n41. \"Nobody makes me bleed my own blood. Nobody!\"\n\nDodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004)\n\n\"Dodgeball\" goes to great lengths to prove how ridiculous White Goodman is. But it's this line that stays with you, because you have to think about it for a second. Wait, what did he just say? Yes, that's it.\n\n40. \"I'm not drinking any f****** Merlot!\"\n\nMerie W. Wallace/Fox Searchlight\n\nSideways (2004)\n\nCould someone really have that much against Merlot? Apparently so. It's the wine that non enthusiasts drink to try to pretend they know wine. So, Paul Giamatti's character in \"Sideways\" is a complete wine snob. The movie just has the most hilarious way of showing it.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n39. \"Very nice!\"\n\nBorat (2006)\n\nYou really couldn't go anywhere in 2006 without someone shouting \"Very nice!\" like it was the funniest thing they'd ever heard. And maybe it was. That's what happens when you create such an exaggerated character.\n\nLorey Sebastian\n\n38. \"It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.\"\n\nCrash (2004)\n\nForget the backlash \"Crash\" received after winning the Oscar for Best Picture. The film made you feel something. At the heart of it all is the quote Don Cheadle's character delivers at the beginning. This is a movie about people so detached from one another that when they do come into contact with someone they've never met, it's explosive.\n\nDisney/Marvel Studios\n\n37. \"I could do this all day\"\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016)\n\nThis quote actually originates in the first \"Captain America\" film. But in \"Civil War\" it absolutely gives you chills. Cap delivers it during his epic fight with Iron Man, reminding us that behind that shield is still the brave, skinny guy at heart who will go until he can't go anymore.\n\nSuzanne Hanover\n\n36. \"You know how I know that you're gay?\"\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)\n\nPolitically incorrect and offensive? Definitely. But the conversation centered on \"You know how I know that you're gay\" became an instant classic in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\" The outtakes are even more humorous. Heck, even the band Coldplay didn't mind being included in the joke.\n\nSMPSP\n\n35. \"This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!\"\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\n\nPerhaps just as memorable as his introduction in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is the cooky nature of this one-liner. Who could forget Jack Sparrow?\n\nDaniel McFadden\n\n34. \"Not my tempo.\"\n\nWhiplash (2014)\n\nIt's the calm before the storm -- a teacher letting his student know his work isn't up to par. From there, things get crazy. What's awesome is you can feel it coming. \"Not my tempo\" feels harmless, until it isn't.\n\nJasin Boland\n\n33. \"Oh what a day. What a lovely day!\"\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nJoy in the midst of chaos. Well, sort of? \"What a lovely day...\" is essentially short for \"What a lovely day (to die).\" Words that set the mood and the stakes for a film that's mostly just amazing action.\n\nRichard Foreman\n\n32. \"We're goin' streaking!\"\n\nOld School (2003)\n\nEven if we hadn't gotten to seen Will Ferrell's naked body, we still would have felt the overwhelming shock value of man just married and in his mid 30s trying to convince everyone it was time to get naked and run through town.\n\nJames Dittiger\n\n31. \"I have had it with these mother------ snakes on this mother------ plane!\"\n\nSnakes on a Plane (2006)\n\nOne of the most self aware movie quotes you will ever see. \"Snakes on a Plane\" wasn't going for fancy and in the process Samuel L. Jackson gets to deliver one of the most memorable lines of his career.\n\n30. \"You motorboatin' son of a b****!\"\n\nWedding Crashers (2005)\n\nThere are plenty of memorable Vince Vaughn lines from his movie career. But his top moment from \"Wedding Crashers\" comes with a physical gesture we're sure you can picture in your head as you read this. A catchphrase and uncomfortable movement with your mouth was born.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n29. \"I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.\"\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nAlmost immediately upon hearing this, you most certainly wanted to run up to the slacker in your office, get in face and deliver this line. It was epic and original and, oh, so cool.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n28. \"King Kong ain't got s*** on me!\"\n\nTraining Day (2001)\n\nIt's an over the top proclamation from a guy, at that point in the movie, who has run out of options. But Denzel Washington's character is going to go out with his pride in tact. What he forgot to remember is that King Kong dies at the end too.\n\nParamount\n\n27. \"What is this? A center for ants? How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read...if they can't even fit inside the building?\"\n\nZoolander (2001)\n\nNot every great quote has to be essential to a film's plot. \"Zoolander's\" best lines simply showcase how ridiculous the title character is and how stupid he can be.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\n26. \"Look at me. I'm the captain now.\"\n\nCaptain Phillips (2013)\n\nActor Barkhad Abdi hasn't gone on to have a prolific movie career. But he owns his moment in \"Captain Phillips.\" No threats or other gestures needed. When he says \"I'm the captain now,\" it's clear who is going to be in charge from here on out.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n25. \"I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.\"\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nThis is just brilliant writing. \"The Devil Wears Prada\" lives in the somewhat superficial world of fashion. But poking at fun at body image issues can be challenging. But the statement is so ridiculous and hilarious you can't help but recognize its intelligence.\n\nMarvel\n\n24. \"I am Groot.\"\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\n\"I am Groot\" has come to mean so many things. Literally, it's the only thing the character can say and it has multiple meanings. The fact that such a line can convey so many different emotions is what makes it so iconic.\n\nParamount Vintage\n\n23. \"I drink your milkshake. I drink it up.\"\n\nThere Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis' performance in \"There Will Be Blood\" is one for the ages and this is the most memorable line to come out of it. Just when you thought there weren't any more unique ways of saying \"I win!\"\n\nNeal Preston\n\n22. \"I am a golden god!\"\n\nAlmost Famous (2000)\n\nBecause you have to yell something when you're about to jump off a roof and into a pool. Of course, paired with the line \"I'm on drugs,\" it makes much more sense.\n\nClaire Folger\n\n21. \"Argo f*** yourself.\"\n\nArgo (2012)\n\nIf you ever have some free time, I suggest you search the Internet for how real story of how the word 'Argo' became the name of a fictional film and thus helped save a group of hostages. It's quote entertaining.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n20. \"My precious.\"\n\nLord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)\n\nIt can be hard to portray obsession. But you truly never doubt the addiction Gollum (a CGI'd character) has for the ring. It's almost creepy just how much it controls him as he delivers that haunting phrase.\n\nAnthony Michael Rivetti\n\n19. \"Get off my lawn.\"\n\nGran Torino (2008)\n\nIt's an old school phrase to represent a person far past their prime telling a young person to get lost. But it's never more intense than when Clint Eastwood delivers it in \"Gran Torino.\" It's literal and the consequence is death. He means it!\n\nPhillip V. Caruso\n\n18. \"I have nipples Greg. Could you milk me?\"\n\nMeet the Parents (2000)\n\nRobert De Niro proves his comedic chops time and time again in \"Meet the Parents.\" And his best lines come in the form of questions. Of course \"Could you milk me\" is the one sure to make you do a spit take. But it's also rather horrifying if you're hearing such a thing from your girlfriend's father. Of course, it does feel like an appropriate response to the notion you can milk a cat.\n\nZade Rosenthal\n\n17. \"With great power comes great responsiblity.\"\n\nSpider-Man (2002)\n\nIt's kind of corny. But what line is more comic book than this. Plus, it conveys the weight of Spider-Man's dilemma and the theme of that fantastic first trilogy.\n\nMary Cybulski\n\n16. \"I've been a poor man and I've been a rich man. And I choose rich every f****** time!\"\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nIt's the modern day version of \"Greed is good.\" And it may be even more convincing. Who's going to argue with such a statement. We all would choose rich, right?\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n15. \"This is Sparta!\"\n\n300 (2006)\n\nDo you really want a guy this jacked telling you where he's from? No. And this is actually some cold blooded stuff to say to someone before you kick them down a bottomless whole. The intensity of \"300\" stays at this level throughout.\n\nMerrick Morton\n\n14. \"You're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that won't be true. It'll be because you're an a**hole.\"\n\nThe Social Network (2010)\n\nAaron Sorkin loves writing way too much to simply write \"F*** off.\" Instead, in the opening scene to \"The Social Network\" he comes up with one the greatest breakup lines in movie history and it's the truth...whether Mark Zuckerberg (in a somewhat fictional sense) likes it or not.\n\nZade Rosenthal\n\n13. \"I am Iron Man.\"\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nYes, it's from a Black Sabbath song. But it's also the most important line in Marvel Studios history. That final moment in \"Iron Man\" has become iconic. Robert Downey owns it and the franchise takes off.\n\nMichael Gibson\n\n12. \"That is so fetch.\"\n\nMean Girls (2004)\n\nA movie creating a catchphrase out of making fun of the idea of making a catchphrase. \"Stop trying to make fetch happen!\"\n\nColumbia Records\n\n11. \"You shall not pass!\"\n\nLord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nThe fire inside an old wizard as he tells a fire monster to back off is the stuff of legend and the kind of moment in \"Lord of the Rings\" that makes you fall in love with its characters. Plus, it's fun to act out this part as much as any moment in \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\n10. \"I love lamp.\"\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)\n\nOf all the amazing lines in \"Anchorman\" it's just three simple words that will make you laugh time and time again. Oh, Brick! He was always our favorite.\n\nLucasFilm\n\n9. \"Chewie, we're home.\"\n\nThe Force Awakens (2015)\n\nSeeing \"The Force Awakens\" in the theater, you knew how powerful this line was. The sense of nostalgia was at an all time high. Fans had waited so long and couldn't help but let out a cheer.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n8. \"Are you not entertained?\"\n\nGladiator (2000)\n\nIt was a line so epic, Jay-Z used it to open one of the songs on his \"retirement\" album. Russell Crowe's Maximus gives zero you know whats at this point in \"Gladiator,\" remaining defiant. He's heartbroken, but, by no means, broken where he's going to let a crowd of blood thirsty people tell him what to do.\n\nMurray Close\n\n7. \"May the odds ever be in your favor.\"\n\nThe Hunger Games (2008)\n\nWe almost went with \"I volunteer as tribute,\" because it's such a huge moment. But \"May the odds ever be in your favor\" is the line that echoes throughout \"The Hunger Games\" franchise. You would think it were sarcastic if the world Katniss and company lived in wasn't so at peace with the idea of young people killing each other to pay tribute. The horror!\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n6. \"Why so serious?\"\n\nThis was the hardest movie to choose something from. I mean, it has the line \"Some men just want to watch the world burn\" in it. But Heath Ledger's performance has a permanent space in your mind. And his \"Why so serious?\" line is the true embodiment of the joker. He might be calm in saying or doing anything else. But it's in delivering that line where the pure evil creeps out.\n\nStephanie Branchu\n\n5. \"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.\"\n\nTaken (2008)\n\nNot much needs to be explained here. The idea of Liam Neeson as an action hero was somewhat ridiculous until he delivered this monologue.\n\nKimberly French\n\n4. \"I wish I knew how to quit you.\"\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nFor some it became a punchline. In retrospect, it's one of the most emotionally charged lines in any movie...ever. You really have to take into account the lines that come before it as well as Jake Gyllenhaal's powerful delivery of it. He's in love and it's caused him so much pain. But he can't get away from it. If you can't relate to that, maybe you're just not human.\n\nJaap Buitendijk\n\n3. \"Well, I don't want to survive. I want to live.\"\n\n12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nMy god, what a line! It's about surviving and living. But really, it's about hope. How does one find the strength to carry on under such dire circumstances. How do you find the ability to even differentiate between survival and \"living\" at that point? It's such powerful stuff.\n\nRichard Foreman\n\n2. \"What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?\"\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nOne man is thinking it's just a coin toss. The other is dealing in terms of life and death. \"What's the most you ever lost...\" is such a loaded question in this context. And yet, Javier Bardem's character delivers it so calmly. The tension builds and we're left wondering if it landed heads or tails.\n\nPixar\n\n1. \"Just keep swimming.\"\n\nFinding Nemo (2003)\n\nThe best movie quotes find a way to make powerful, universal statements in a unique way specific to the themes of that film. In \"Finding Nemo,\" Dory gives the best advice imaginable: \"...Just keep swimming.\" It's a message of perseverance not just at the heart of \"Finding Nemo,\" but virtually every great Disney movie ever created."
