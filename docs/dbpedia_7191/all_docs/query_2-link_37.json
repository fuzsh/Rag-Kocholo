        "text": "This month, Richard Brody reviews classic action movies from the nineteen-eighties that he’s never seen before.\n\nIn the mid-to-late nineteen-eighties, I was working long hours in and out of the film business (commercials, documentaries, a stint at an ad agency, doing and then teaching word-processing, office-managing), and I wasn’t getting to the movies as often as I’d have liked. I’ve been working as a critic only since 2005; before then, I went to the movies like everyone else does, for pleasure, and even if my pleasures may have been always somewhat obsessive, they’ve also been haphazard. As a result, there is one entire swath of movies that I missed at the time of their release and never caught up on to any significant extent: large-scale eighties Hollywood action films. But this month, finally, I resolved to watch some of the classics of the genre, starting with “Die Hard”—which left me feeling that I hadn’t missed much pleasure at the time but certainly missed the time itself.\n\n“Die Hard,” released in July, 1988, is essentially two one-hour TV shows, or two one-hour episodes in a police series, both of which are realized with a particular directorial—and cinematographic—flair. The first hour is the story of John McClane (Bruce Willis) single-handedly fending off a band of terrorists that has taken over Nakatomi Tower and is holding the Nakatomi Corporation’s employees—including McClane’s wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), a high-ranking executive—hostage in its thirtieth-floor offices. In the second hour, the police arrive, followed by the F.B.I., and McClane tries to defeat the terrorists with the help of—or, more often, despite the interference of—the forces of order. McClane’s solo battle has a spare, elemental power that disperses ludicrously when the police arrive—I may have let out an audible groan. I’d have figured the movie for another fifteen or twenty minutes at most; instead, it grinds on for another hour, in order to reach full apocalyptic fire and emotional resolution.\n\nAlong the way, though, its director, John McTiernan, and its cinematographer, Jan de Bont, borrow the sleekly metallic stylings, neon glow, striated light, and sharply angled asymmetries of European commercials of the period and add to them an intermittent, seemingly intentionally fleeting sculptural majesty. Moments that pass by quickly—particularly ones featuring Bruce Willis in poses of fear, pain, or fierce determination—seem ready-made as iconography to be clipped for a trailer or a poster. The idea of the film as an advertisement for itself, as a mass-media self-projection, is no coincidence—it’s one of the movie’s crucial reflections of the cultural moment in which it was made.\n\nThe movie offers emotional resolution for John and Holly, whose marriage had been strained by her acceptance of a great job in Los Angeles (while John stayed in New York out of a sense of police duty). It also offers emotional resolution for another character, Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), an L.A. police officer who, for much of the ordeal, had been McClane’s main connection, via walkie-talkie, with the outer world—a cop who has been on desk duty, at his own behest, since his rookie year, when he shot a thirteen-year-old whose toy gun he mistook for a real one.\n\nAl’s climactic redemption—gunning down the last of the attackers—is, to say the least, a culturally determined one. The very theme of the movie is violence as redemption; it is only by means of his heroic effort to fight the terrorists that McClane saves his marriage, just as Al, through violence, saves his police-hood—in effect, his manhood. There are no female officers involved in the mission and, for that matter, no female criminals; in this regard, as in many others, “Die Hard” is much duller and blander than a thriller that followed close on its heels, Michael Cimino’s “Desperate Hours.”\n\nOn the other hand, “Die Hard” resists, conspicuously, the cinematic stereotype of violent black villains (1988 was the year when George H. W. Bush won the Presidency by using a repellent attack ad linking his opponent, Michael Dukakis, to a black convict named Willie Horton). The movie features three major African-American characters—Al; a comedic (but ultimately heroic) limo driver named Argyle (De’voreaux White); and Theo (Clarence Gilyard, Jr.), the terrorist band’s computer whiz. Yet there’s another ethnic anxiety that the movie represents—the film is centered on the Nakatomi Corporation, headed by a Japanese-American man named Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), which is an emblem of the then widely stoked fear that Japanese high-tech businesses were threatening to dominate the American economy. The film also shrewdly both emphasizes and banalizes the ambient fear of terrorism by presenting the attackers’ political demands as a false front for ordinary robbery and greed.\n\nThe movie lost me at a single moment, about a third of the way in—when McClane, falling down an elevator shaft, catches himself by the fingertips on the recessed inside of an air vent. At that moment, the rules of the game change—the drama passes from heroics to superheroics and McClane’s exertions rise from extraordinary to incredible. It’s unfortunate, because there’s a twist, late in the game, that raises the stakes in far more convincing—and symbolically resonant—terms: McClane has been barefoot all movie long (there’s a droll moment when he tries to take the shoes from an attacker he has killed—“Nine million terrorists in the world and I’ve got to kill one with feet smaller than my sister”) and, late in the assault, when he manages to take refuge in an unfinished office, the leader of the terrorist band, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), orders his minions to shoot the glass partitions. After the resulting shower of glass, McClane has no choice but to run barefoot across the shards, slicing the soles of his feet and leaving a trail of blood. It’s as if McClane got, in that scene, his stigmata. He makes a point, early in the film, of mentioning his Catholic-school education; his sacrificial torments in the name of order and family make him a lone, white, working-class Christ figure.\n\nIf so, the pharisaical authorities to which he stands up aren’t the terrorists but the government. “Die Hard” is a furiously anti-bureaucratic, anti-governmental film. The movie displays thoroughgoing skepticism toward authority, toward officialdom, toward those in power at all levels, from the local L.A.P.D. captain (Paul Gleason) to the F.B.I., whose takeover of the mission is greeted as sneeringly by McClane (“The feds?”) as it would have been by Ronald Reagan himself. McClane’s braggadocious response to the first terrorist he catches, who stands up to him, serves as the movie’s own statement about the right way, rather than the approved way, to dispatch a miscreant:\n\n“You won’t hurt me.”\n\n“Yeah? Why not?”\n\n“Because you’re a policeman. There are rules for policemen.”\n\n“Yeah, that’s what my captain keeps telling me.”\n\nThe culture of violence in “Die Hard” isn’t merely practical, it’s national—Hans Gruber mocks McClane over the walkie-talkie: “Who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne, Rambo, Marshal Dillon?” (Of course, McClane’s response is famous: he prefers Roy Rogers, and takes to the battle purring, “Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!”) Moments earlier, Hans has, for his own pleasure, quoted Plutarch and added sardonically, “The benefits of a classical education. . . .”\n\nThe archly refined, high-cultured villain was no new invention (Clifton Webb, in “Laura,” was among the forerunners); their manners and learning both mark and signify their evil intent. But in “Die Hard” the villain’s refinement is contrasted not merely with the plain-spoken street smarts of, say, the police officer played by Dana Andrews in “Laura” but with an American pop-cultural archetype. McClane, for his part, adds some pop-culture references of his own, which Gruber doubtless wouldn’t get—when Gruber tries and fails to guess his identity, McClain taunts him with an allusion to “Jeopardy.” “Die Hard” is certainly not the first film to build such references into the action; rather, their centrality to “Die Hard,” their modelling of the hero’s persona, situates the film in one of the decisive currents of the eighties—the invention of pop culture.\n\nOf course, pop culture already, and always, existed. In the fifties, however, French critics saw some Hollywood movies as the artistic equals of any in the world—and as art equal to that of any painting, novel, or musical composition. American critics soon followed suit, and suddenly attention to Hollywood became an essential part of intellectual and artistic life. But, by the mid-seventies, the idea was stood on its head: in the wake of the sixties’ great political, social, and generational disruptions, nostalgia (for the fifties, and sometimes for earlier) took hold, as did the dream and the yearning for the kind of cultural unity that seemed (but only seemed) to have been lost. (In fact, the earlier mainstream simply excluded vast swaths of the population, large spans of experience.) Popularity itself, and its correlate, celebrity, became an intrinsic value—the mere fact of widespread knowledge and familiarity became a reason to pay attention. Suddenly, filmmakers, critics, and viewers all became aware that they were functioning in an environment of pop culture, as if fish had suddenly become aware of living in water, and the attention paid to the most prominent productions of mass media further amplified them, turning filmmaking into a mighty feedback machine of cultural self-reflection. “Die Hard,” like many movies of the eighties, is in effect a signifier of itself. There’s no need for eighties nostalgia—because, in this regard, the eighties have never ended."
