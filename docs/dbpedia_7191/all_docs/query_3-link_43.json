        "text": "Jordan Peele (born February 21, 1979, New York City, New York, U.S.) is an American comedian, writer, director, and producer who is known for creating both comedy and horror films and TV shows that address popular culture and social issues, especially race relations.\n\nPeele was raised in Manhattan by his white mother; his African American father was largely absent from his life. From an early age he was interested in performing and in movies. After completing his elementary education at a public school, he attended a private high school, from which he graduated in 1997. He then enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College. At first he studied puppetry, but a class on comedy inspired him. He became a member of a comedy troupe, and he soon left school to pursue comedy full-time. With his classmate and fellow troupe member Rebecca Drysdale, Peele initially formed an act that they billed as Two White Guys.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nPeele later became a member of the improv theatre Boom Chicago, based in Amsterdam. In 2002, during a Comedy Swap between Boom Chicago and the Second City theatre in Chicago, Peele met Keegan-Michael Key, and the following year both became performers on the sketch comedy TV show MADtv. Peele, a master of impersonation, remained on the show through 2008. He later reunited with his MADtv castmate to create and star in the Comedy Central series Key and Peele (2012–15). The show won a large and ardent following. It earned a Peabody Award in 2013, and it won the Emmy Award for outstanding sketch comedy series in its final season. The pair also starred as cousins trying to repossess a kitten from a drug kingpin in the film comedy Keanu (2016), cowritten by Peele.\n\nPeele debuted as a director with the horror movie Get Out (2017), which he also wrote. In the movie a young Black man (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend’s parents for the first time and experiences racism that is more horrifying than he could imagine. Get Out won rave reviews, and Peele became the first African American to win an Academy Award for best original screenplay. He was also nominated for his direction, while the movie received a nod for best picture."
