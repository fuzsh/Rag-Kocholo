        "text": "You don’t need to speak French to delight in MOMA’s retrospective of the films of Allan Dwan (which runs today through July 8), who was, among other things, one of the greatest directors of Westerns. But it helps to know that there likely would be no such retrospective were it not for a group of French film critics, writing mainly in Cahiers du Cinéma in the nineteen-fifties, who came up with the politique des auteurs, the idea that the best Hollywood directors working within the studio system are nonetheless expressive artists of the first order, as much the “authors” of their films as writers are of their books. The idea caught on because its critical proponents soon demonstrated the practical power of their insights: they directed movies that were largely inspired by the Hollywood films they championed, and became famous as the French New Wave. Dwan was one of the directors these fanatical movie-goers and heterodox critics admired.\n\nDwan’s filmography is huge—more than a hundred and thirty features, and nearly three hundred silent shorts, in a directorial career that ran from 1911 to 1961. He sometimes made as many as four features a year, and I haven’t seen more than a handful of his movies (most are rarely screened and unavailable on home video). The ones I’ve watched are exhilarating—they bring to life a clear, coherent, and substantial worldview with a bracing and provocative sense of style—and it’s worth getting at the nature of Dwan’s art while looking also at the underlying implications of seeing “art” in the bosom of Hollywood’s blatantly mercantile productions.\n\nDwan’s films offer a distinctively thick cross-section of society, bringing all strata, from grandees to grifters, together in his stories and in his turbulent, overflowing images. In the silent 1924 New York working-class melodrama “Manhandled,” starring Gloria Swanson as a shopgirl, Dwan brings quick-witted, visually analytical comedy to the bustling bargain basement where she works and to the rude and rugged subway that she has to ride, which brings her into conflict-riddled contact with male predators from the high reaches of business and art. I wrote that Dwan’s Western “Frontier Marshal,” from 1939—the story of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday—reveals silver-boom Tombstone to have been a “microcosmic metropolis,” and looking back at a capsule review from a couple of years ago, I found that I called the California gold-rush outpost in “Tennessee’s Partner,” from 1955, “a teeming society in microcosm.”\n\nDwan weaves taut webs of connections only to tear them apart with violence, and there’s a strange, removed side to the brutality that bursts out in his Westerns and his films noirs (such as “The River’s Edge” and “Slightly Scarlet”). The astonishing speed with which violence emerges and leaves bodies behind arises from a psychological density that matches the density of society: for Dwan, a gunfight is a complex football play with life at stake, occurring in mere seconds, and his images seem to diagram the decisive machine-like calculations that spin through the gunfighter’s head, instantaneously determining the action. He has a graphic sense that renders each of these shots emphatically significant and potentially decisive—they’re models of clarity which, cut together, yield a bewilderingly, nerve-janglingly complex array, a kind of scream that’s stilled by cold self-control.\n\nEven Douglas Fairbanks’s suavely athletic derring-do, in the 1917 action comedy “A Modern Musketeer” (which also boasts a young woman character who is called, at that early date, a “flapper”), is broken down into a surprisingly disparate and intricate set of angles. Where D. W. Griffith’s primordial editing seems to compose sequences constructively, from various physical and emotional components, Dwan’s montage seems to pull action apart into psychologically charged fragments that run together without resolving their conflicts.\n\nThere’s a strong ethical component at work, too, a blend of admiration for heroes who wield their strength to do good and horror at the violence that their efforts demand—and the recognition that they both exude and bear this horror. That’s why Dwan’s physical heroes have a pariah-like blankness, an opaque hardness that sets them apart from the world that they help to bind together. In his last Western, “The Restless Breed,” from 1957, Dwan presents a Federal agent who tears off his badge and heads to a small border town to avenge the death of his father; possessed of a sense of righteousness, he brings a mounting body count and, though his victims are themselves unwelcome terrorizers, they horrify the town less than the man of virtue whose very virtue brings bloodshed.\n\nA couple of my favorites by Dwan are missing from the series (notably “Cattle Queen of Montana,” which presents a nuanced and complex view of political conflicts within a Native American tribe), but I especially wish that MOMA had included Dwan’s last film, “The Most Dangerous Man Alive,” from 1961. [UPDATE: MOMA has just sent over a full schedule, which includes “The Most Dangerous Man Alive,” screening on July 5th and 8th.]\n\nThe question came up on Twitter recently about greatest last films. I mentioned some of my favorites—such as John Ford’s “7 Women,” Carl Theodor Dreyer’s “Gertrud,” Robert Bresson’s “L’Argent,” and Charlie Chaplin’s “A Countess from Hong Kong” (as well, of course, as those whose great first features were also their last, whether Jean Vigo’s “L’Atalante” or Barbara Loden’s “Wanda,” or John Cassavetes’s “Love Streams,” which is his “real” last film). “The Most Dangerous Man Alive” is worthy to be listed alongside them, which is all the more remarkable because it’s a threadbare, ultra-low-budget, thrillingly silly and hectic science-fiction film.\n\n“The Most Dangerous Man Alive” starts out as a film noir before morphing into a future-is-now premise. Its protagonist is a gangster convicted of murder who, en route to the gas chamber, escapes from custody; he wanders through barren ground that happens to be a nuclear test site, and is caught in a blast. Instead of dying, he suffers a peculiar injury: the material of his handcuffs disintegrates and becomes part of his bodily tissue, turning him into a “man of steel” endowed with superhuman strength and invulnerability. He discovers his new powers when he challenges the mobsters who set him up for the crime; they shoot him—and (in astonishing close-ups) the bullets tear his clothing but bounce off his flesh. The movie is a successor to “The Amazing Colossal Man” and its sequel, “War of the Colossal Beast,” but Dwan brings an altogether different artistry to the subject, both in his wildly expressive, shriekingly intense, and viscerally shocking images (and in the jangling lurch from image to image) and in their import as an implicitly political thriller, and, above all, an intensely personal testament.\n\nHere, the thick social order brings mobsters together with Federal officials and nuclear scientists, and the shredding of order is more frenzied than ever, with the violence tearing holes in both the natural world and in the societal realm that is to blame. With its sophisticated physics, video screens, and microbiological beguilement, the movie conveys Dwan’s state of shock regarding the rise of nuclear power, increasingly violent cities, and a military-scientific order in which power is enriched with arcane knowledge and where science defies, with Faustian audacity, the bounds of human decency. It’s the movie of a man born in 1885 who, in his mid-seventies, was seeking provocative new paths, both visually and thematically, and confronting the terrors of a bewildering new world.\n\nIn both its intensely energized, nearly unhinged visual inventiveness and its apocalyptic tone, “The Most Dangerous Man Alive” is the work of an artist overleaping his material constraints and going out with a grand flourish—though, of course, Dwan didn’t intend to go out: he was unable to get financing for another film, but lived until 1981. It’s one of many stories in which Hollywood’s classic-era luminaries got lost in the waning days of the studio system at precisely the moment the young directors they inspired were becoming world-renowned.\n\nP.S. The series is organized around the publication of the book “Allan Dwan and the Rise and Decline of the Hollywood Studios,” by Frederic Lombardi. I haven’t laid eyes on a copy yet, but am planning to read it; will report back. (MOMA has put the preface online.)"
