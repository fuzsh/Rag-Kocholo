        "text": "After World War I, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied Powers. This deal, often criticized for being too harsh, had granted the Allies to occupy and seize any strategic points in case of a threat to the Allied security (via its 7th Stipulation), and the right to demobilize the Ottoman Army. However, incursion by the Allies into Anatolia in the name of restoring order without any casus belli soon followed.\n\nMarash was occupied by the British Forces in November 1919. During this time, Armenians who were deported from Marash in 1915/1916 were on their way back to the city. The British Administration decided to settle these Armenians in some neighborhoods or villages which were not traditionally inhabited by the Armenian Communities. This led to mutinies between the Armenian and Turkish communities within the city. After 8 months, the British handed over Marash to the French.\n\nMarash housed a considerable amount of Armenian Catholics. When the French, who had seen themselves as the sole protector of the Catholic world for centuries, seized the city, the Armenian Community was quite satisfied with the developments, and welcomed the French in a very hospitable manner. In return, the French Army militarized the Armenian Community of Marash by leasing them weapons and building protected headquarters for their use. This move only resulted in increased tension between the Muslims and the Armenian minority\n\nIn contrast, the Muslim Community did not have sufficient materials with which to fight. Seeing the Armenian preparations and witnessing the arrests of their leaders by the French Army, the Muslims also started to prepare for a clash which was inevitable. Muslim leaders, Dr. Mustapha, his brother Pharmacist Lutfi, Kadızada Hacı Hasan Efendi, his son Mehmet Ziya, Katipzada Mehmet, Vehbizade Hasıp, Kocabashzade Omar, Mustapha and Nazim, who wanted to merge the Muslim response to the French occupation under a single banner, created the “Marash National Struggle Committee” on October 28th, 1919 in Albistan, Marash. These individuals tried to gather much needed weapons and ammunition. Ali Rıza Begh and his friends founded a resistance organization led by a board of directors.\n\nThe Committee of Representation, which governed from Sivas, incorporated Marash into its sphere of influence. The leader of the Committee of Representation, Mustapha Kemal Pascha, elected Kilic Ali to mount an organized defense of the city. Kilic Ali selected 3 wellknown locals form both Marash and Aintab as his companions. Arslan Begh, Evliya Efendi and Hafız Ali Efendi were selected from Marash, and Sadik Efendi, Kazim Efendi and Mulazim Mustapha Efendi were selected from Aintab. Kilic Ali, who quickly organized the forces of Marash and Aintab, carefully planned the defence of Marash and Aintab in consultation with the Beghs and Efendis mentioned earlier.\n\nCaptain Kilic Ali Begh, Leader of the Atmali Tribe’s Yakup Hamdi and Memik Agha would take up positions in Pazarcik. Their main duty was to cut off French supply bands and reinforcements which would be sent to Marash from Aintab immediately after the beginning of the clashes. Captain Yoruk Selim would be deployed in Goksun with Pharmacist Lutfi Bey. Major Ali Begh and Nakipzada Mehmet Begh would be responsible for the communications with the Committee of Representation for additional troops. Arslan Begh was selected to the Marash National Struggle Committee as the president with Kirmaci Hadji Efendi being his deputy. They would separate Marash into 10 zones and take up commanding duties during the struggle.\n\nOn January 20th, French soldiers lowered the Turkish Flag and replaced it with the French Flag. This move was not accepted by the exasperated Muslim Community and resulted in skirmishes between the Turks and the Occupiers. For 22 days and 22 nights they clashed in the streets of Marash. Turkish casualties numbered around 200 martyrs and hundreds if not thousands of veterans. General Querette, commander of the French Occupation Force, retreated from Marash on the night of February 11th and was soon followed by his forces and Armenian collaborators.\n\nThe victory at Marash created a spark which would turn into a fire when it also saved Aintab, Urfa and Adana from occupation and this fire would save a nation from its annihilation. TBMM (Grand Assembly of Turkey) awarded Marash with the Independence Medal (İstiklâl Madalyası) in 1925 and would add the word “hero” into its name as a title in 1973, hence the name Kahramanmarash."
