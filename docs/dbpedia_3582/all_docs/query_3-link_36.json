        "text": "I think a good middle ground would be to count the strategic planning and directives of commanders in the modern era, that didn't really participate in the battle on a tactical level, to be victories or defeats for the commander if 9 times out of 10 he wouldn't be present on the field of battle. They also usually handle the logistics of the army, which why it might be a good to consider the successful maintenance of their army and prevention of the soldiers dying from starvation in a particularly harsh geographical situation as a victory on their part.\n\nThat way, commanders like Napoleon also wouldn't have battles like Wavre, which was fought and commanded by his subordinates, attributed to them as Napoleon's commands had to be relayed to his Marshals and generals by Berthier, who would make Napoleon's commands concise and easy to understand for the Marshals as well as follow. He also handled the logistical planning of Napoleon's army and was the reason the Grand Armee at the start of the invasion if Russia could meet the demand of food of the over 600,000 soldiers.\n\nBut Npaoloen;s supply system failed in teh buidl up to the RUssian invasion. The Troops got sick, the horses lost condition and Poland was pillaged. I manfesitly could not ,meet the demand.\n\nThe effect of him not being present can be seen in Napoleon's Hundred Days Campaign. His commanders were constabtly confused and disorganised while trying to follow his instructions. Napoleon even made a remark after Waterloo that had Berthier been there, he would not have met this misfortune.\n\nOther than D'Erlon what disoprgansed and confuseon was caused by poor staff work. I don't see the agrument that Napoloen spoke in tonugues being reaosnable. If the Napoloen had not organized staff work after 15 years it;'s on him.\n\nOn D'Erlon Popular myth but perpps no true, the scrappy order may well have been forged by the ADC.\n\nThe Key to Victory: General d’Erlon’s I Corps, 16 June 1815\n\nBernadotte 1806 - Is There a Case for the Defence?\n\nI don't think it is enough. Since we are looking for tactical engagements. But Moltke is an inherently non-tactical commander. I don't see why we can't include all of it since Moltke was regularly making use of the electric telegraph and had a complex system of messengers and HQ. He was regularly convening with his army commanders and hand picked all of their staff officers.\n\nHe was also directing the war on the broad level. He never commanded an army but was in command of multiple armies. Three armies initially, later five if I recall correctly. Because of the scale of warfare the battle field changed from one location to an entire front. Instead of various units on one field, there were multiple armies on many fields. Well actually Moltke frequently concentrated his armies as often as possible.\n\nIn that regard and in terms of his accomplishments he is sort of like the Bai Qi of later European history. Where Bai Qi as well enjoyed a particularly high position and frequently made use of his subordinates in independent roles. This is also similar to Han Xin I would say.\n\nI kind of want to attempt a complete revamp of the modern generals.\n\nThat is why it's a compromise. It's something in between the position you hold and the position for the counting of the engagements by generals that was initially proposed.\n\nI would personally not include all the battles of the wars of Helmuth. This is because there were instances, such as during the initial stages of the Schleswig War, where Helmuth's orders and plans were mismanaged allowing the war to be prolonged due to the Danish army successfully retreating. This was despite Helmuth's use of the telegram and implementation of the railways in transporting troops from one place to another.\n\nHence, I included the capture of the island of Funen, as since the Danish army was still active, even after the taking if multiple firts, Helmuth drew up a strategy to capture the island of Funen, where much of the Danish army was stationed.\n\nI was alsp trying to oncorporate the original condition of giving a commander a loss or a victory based in whether or not their objective or part if it had been fulfilled by the engagement.\n\nSince the Battle of Spicheren was considered unnecessary by Moltke who wanted to attack Bazaine's army on the Saar by using two Prussian ones, one army leading the frontal assault, while the flanked the French army. Thereby allowing the complete destruction of Bazaine's army, since this objective hadn't been fulfilled, and in fact had never been materialised due to the hasty battle at Spicheren, I decided not to include it. I have similar reasons for not including Worth.\n\nThe Military Career of Meng Ao\n\n250 BC: Conquest of Chenggao in Haan\n\nConquest of Xingyang in Haan\n\n249: Takes Taiyuan from Zhao\n\n248: Conquest of Gaodu in Wei\n\nConquest of Ji in Wei\n\nConquest of Yuci in Zhao\n\nConquest of Xincheng in Zhao\n\nConquest of Langmeng in Zhao (Sima Qian notes that by the end of Meng Ao's 248 campaign against Zhao, Zhao had ceded control of 37 towns and cities.)\n\n247: Battle of Hewai (X) (against the combined army of Haan, Zhao, Wei, Chu and Yan)\n\nDefeats the enemy coalition at the Hangu Pass (commanding together with Wang He)\n\n246: Crushes a revolt in Jinyang\n\n244: Annexes 13 cities from Haan (x2 engagements?

Meng Ao's role in the campaigning of 241 is unclear, but he was the General-in-Chief, so his close involvement in such a precarious affair seems likely.)\n\nLoss of Shouling (X)\n\nDefeat of the enemy coalition at or near Zui\n\nConquest of Chaoge in Wei\n\n240: Conquest of Long in Zhao\n\nConquest of Gu in Zhao\n\nConquest of Qingdu in Zhao (Meng Ao then dies en route to the Wei city of Ji.)\n\nSummary:\n\nTotal engagements fought: 28\n\nVictories: 25\n\nDefeats: 3\n\nIndecisive: 0\n\nWin rate: 89.3%\n\nSources: The Basic Annals of Qin and the biographies of Meng Tian and the First Emperor in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian."
