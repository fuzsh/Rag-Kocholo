        "text": "The presence of a large fleet of foreign war vessels in Salónica bay evidently had the effect of somewhat Sultan Abdul Harnid II from his letharg-y for a time at least and he made a pretense of restoring order iu the provinces where the slanghter of Arinenian and othei Christians had occurred. The steps he took do not seem to have been oí verv great effect, however, as reports from various places show. The powers delayed any action they may have meditated to see if the sultan was sincere in his promises. There has been little ehaug-e in the nature of the probleiu bcfore the powers, howerer. 'Their mutual suspicions are acling as drags ' upou them and delay decided action upon their part, though the belief still prevails that nothing short of drastic ! raeasures will the sultan to ternas for any lepgth of time. The ! general situation continúes to inspire the gravest fears. Telegrams from Marash and Marsovan say that the American and other missionaries there are in the groatest dang-er. A report ] is current tbat the governor of Hadjin had threatened to burn the convent oí ■ the town and the barley fields 1 rounding-. U. S. Minister Terrell has , informed the porte that if any of the j three American missionaries at Hadjin wcre injured in any way he would j mand and obtain the governor's head. Advices from Sivas assert that when the Turkish troops sent \"to preserve ' order\"' arrive there thu officials will j notify the Armenians to surreuder all arm and ammunition and if they are j nol satisfied that all has been j dered the troops wiü be' ordered to attack the Armenians The concentratiun of Turkish troops at Marash continuos. The Turkish commander is holding1 out all sorts of promises for the surrender of the Zeitouu Armenians, but the laftter apprehend nothiug less thao a whole.sale massacre if tbey hiy down their arms. The representatives of the powers hold the same views, and the Armenians at tinople say that at Zeitoun a battle which willmakehistory will bafoug-ht. Probably the most serious feature of the situation at present is the one resulüng froin the demand which the representatives of (reat Uritain, Russia, Italy and Austria made to the sultan for tirruans allowing the passage through the üardanelles to Constantinople of a second guuboat, to be attached to each of their respective embii ,sies. It is now intimated at the palace that the sultan may decline to grant these detnands, and as the powers consider that more ships in the liosphorus are absolutely necessary to the safety of foreigners it is thought possible that they may insist, and in case of a refusal, send additional warsl}ips without the permistión of the sultan. This is causingmore and more uneasiness. Unless Abdul Hamid submits there is linelv to be trouble. A dispatcb from A thans says that flghting took place at Campo-, near Canea, a fortiíied seaport, and the principal commercial town of the l.-.land of Crete, between Turkish troops and Christians. The military governor at Canea commanded the ! Turks, wliile the Christians were led I by a committee. Tlie governor at Canea was wounded and ;0 were killed. A dispatch from Constantinople lished in Paris says that 20 villages ' have been burned in the northwostern portion of the district of Aleppo and tha.t the inhabitants liave been massacred. The dispatch adds that the Kui-ds aro gathering on the borders of the Euphrates, preparing to march into Syria for tlie purpose of massacreing the Christians. Sultan Unfuges the Powers' Kequost. Later. - The sultan refuses the demand of the powers that each power be permitted to have a second warship in the Bosphorus. He claims that their presence might excite the Mussulmans, and throug-h his ajnbassadors he will request the powers not to press their demand. A correspondent at üdessa says a private dispatch from the península of Anatolia announces that the Kurds in several districts have renouncedobedience to the Turkish empire and declared a religious war, the extinction of the Armenians being the avowed object. Later dLspatches state that tho missiouaries in iMarash are in the greatest danger, notwithstanding assuranees of proteetion given to U. S. Minister Terrell by the porte. The missionaries of the American board referred to are: Rt. Kev. 1. O. Lee, of Owosso, Mich., and his wife. Mrs. Clara Lee: Uev. C. S. Callum and wife, of Maxville, Ont and Miss Mr. Ia Hess, of Owosso, Mich. The U. S. crusier Minneapolis has been ordered to Smyrnato protect American missionaries, but t will take two weeks to reach that port. U. S. Minister Alexander W. Terrell, has reoeived a d-setc.1! from Aintab, annouucing the safe B.; rival there of the Amcrioan niissionarits belonging I to the Central Tur; m-ssion ?Dr. and Mrs. A.aerieus FuJler, Rev. Charles 8. San I ■,-.. Mrs. a. M. Trowbridge, Miss Ellen M. Price and Miss Ehzabeth M. Trowbridge), and the Eng-lish goyerness, Miss .McDonald Mr. Terrell is satisfied that the 17-' mission:ries iu Aintab ar.' safe. i The missionaries ittachedto the station at tOiarput have left that point under escort for Constantinoplë. The i g-overuur of Hadjin. who had threateued to burn the convent there. ha3 been reoalled, and his conduct will be inquired into. A grim story is taken from a private lett -r from L'onstantinople, aecording to which a divcr. wlnle recently enpag-ed in assistinjr in the work of drivinff piles for a new pier at the Ooiden Hom, on reaahiofr the sea bottom was surprised to find liiinself surrounded by the bodies of a number of men apparently opright around hinï. 'Jpon investigation the diver discovered that they were the oorpses of students, ïnany of whom vrere known to him perscmally, who were recently arrested by the Turkish pohce on suspicion. AU the bodies liad leaden weights attaehed to the feet. which kept thera ;rect. The diver saw 50 bodies there."
