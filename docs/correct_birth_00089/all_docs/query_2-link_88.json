        "text": "On this day, 5 April 1997, Canadian rocker Bryan Adams played the Cardiff International Arena on his 18 Till I Die tour.\n\nOrn November 5, 1959, the Canadian musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and photographer his estimated to have sold between 75 million and more than 100 million records and singles worldwide, placing him on the list of best-selling music artists.\n\nAdams was the most played artist on Canadian radio in the 2010s and has had 25 top-15 singles in Canada and a dozen or more in the US, UK, and Australia.\n\nIn June 1996, the album 18 til I Die was released. It contained the songs: \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\" (number 1 in Canada), \"Let's Make a Night to Remember\" (number 1 in Canada), ] \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" (number 1 in Canada), and \"Star\", which is included in the soundtrack of the film Jack.\n\nThe album reached number 22 on the UK charts while also reaching number two in Australia and number four in Canada. The album was less successful in the US only reaching number 31 on the Billboard 200, but was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA. 18 til I Die was certified three times platinum in Canada and Australia and two times platinum in the UK.\n\nIn November 1996, \"I Finally Found Someone\" was released, which was recorded by Bryan Adams and Barbra Streisand as part of the soundtrack of Streisand's self-directed film The Mirror Has Two Faces. The song was nominated for an Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn November 1997, Adams penned new lyrics to the Jean-Jacques Goldman song \"Puisque tu pars\" also written that month, remade as Let's Talk About Love recorded by Celine Dion.\n\nReview - South Wales Echo\n\nThe Canadian finished his British tour last night in fine style, and the party mood out front soon spread to the band.\n\nIt's taken 10 years of hard slog to reach\n\nRobin Hood's slings and arrows have brought outrageous fortune for Adams.\n\nAnd he teased the crowd before half way through launching into the inevitable (Everything I Do) I Do It For You. There was a humourous banter with the band and whether or not guitarist Keith Scott's grandmother is really Welsh, he had plenty of home support.\n\nAdams even demanded a rugby song from the 31,500 crowd, and from his reaction, don't be surprised if there's a cover version of Bread Of Heaven on the next album.\n\nHe took the band briefly to a second stage out on the pitch, with a live favourite - Eddie Cochran's C'Mon Everybody, before picking half a dozen fans from the crowd to join him for She's Only Happy When She's Dancing.\n\nThen it was back to the main stage to finish with the Adams standard - Summer Of '69 - and Straight From The Heart If there's a certain formula, few carry it off in such a no-frills style.\n\nReview - South Wales Echo\n\nBryan Adams started by Waking Up The Neighbours - and anybody else at Cardiff Arms Park who might be doubting he's not here to stay.\n\nThe Canadian finished his British tour last night in fine stylec, and the party mood out front soon spread to the band. It's taken 10 years of hard slog to reach this peak, and Adams is relishing in.\n\nHis swaggering two-hour set ranged from strutting rock to ballads. But he's a rocker at heart, and while the show was (pleasingly) short on gimmicks, it was never short of passion.\n\nRobin Hood's slings and arrows have brought outrageous fortune for Adams. And he teased the crowd before half way through launching into the inevitable (Everything I Do) I Do It For You.\n\nThere was a humourous banter with the band whether guitarist Keith Scott's grandmother isn't really Welsh, he had plaenty of home support.\n\nAdams even demanded a rugby song from the 31,500 crowd and from his reaction, don't be surprised with a cover version of Bread Of Heaven on the next album.\n\nHe took the band breifly to a second stage, with a live favourite - Eddie Cochran's C'mon Everybody, before picking half-a-dozen fans from the crowd to join him for She's Only Happy When She's Dancing.\n\nThen back to the main stage to finish with the Adams standard - Summer Of 69 - and Straight From The Heart, If there's a certain formula, few carry it off in such a no frills style."
