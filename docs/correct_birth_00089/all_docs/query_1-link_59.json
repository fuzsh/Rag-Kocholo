        "text": "What is Bryan Adams' Net Worth?\n\nBryan Adams is a Canadian singer/songwriter, musician and producer who has a net worth of $75 million. As of this writing Bryan Adams has sold more than 100 million records worldwide over a multi-decade career. He is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the best-selling Canadian rock artist of all time.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn on November 5, 1959, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, Adams had an eventful childhood that was full of world travel due to his father's career. Mother, Elizabeth Jane, and father, Captain Conrad J. Adams, moved their family frequently. Conrad was initially a military officer before working for the United Nations as a peacekeeping observer and then as a foreign service diplomat for Canada. Adams spent parts of his childhood in Lisbon, Portugal, Vienna, Austria, and Tel Aviv, Israel. He spent most of his childhood in Ottawa before moving to North Vancouver with his mother and younger brother while his father worked overseas.\n\nAdams got involved with music early in life, buying his first electric guitar at the age of 12. Rather than attending college, he decided to use the money his parents had saved for his education to buy a grand piano. He became the vocalist for the band Sweeney Todd at the age of 15 and was featured on the single \"Roxy Roller,\" which made the U.S. music charts. After a few years in the band, Adams left at age 16. Two years later, he met Jim Vallance, which proved to be the beginning of a decades-long partnership.\n\nMusic Career\n\nIn 1978, Adams signed to A&M records and released his self-titled debut album in 1980, which included a number of singles that experienced popular success in Canada. In 1981, he then released his second album, \"You Want It, You Got It.\" From this album, the single \"Lonely Nights\" reached number 3 on the U.S. Album Rock Tracks chart. In 1983, he released his breakout album \"Cuts Like a Knife,\" which featured a number of singles that made the U.S. and Canadian music charts. The following year, he released the album \"Reckless,\" which peaked at number one on both the Canadian Album Chart and the U.S. Billboard 200 while also climbing the charts in the U.K. and Australia.\n\nIn 1987, he released his next album, \"Into the Fire,\" and contributed a song to \"A Very Special Christmas,\" which has gone on to be one of the best-selling holiday albums in the United States. His success continued into the 1990s, releasing the album \"Waking Up the Neighbours\" in 1991, which was certified Diamond in Canada and quadruple platinum in the United States. The album included the single \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,\" which was featured in the film \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" and spent 16 weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nAdams continued steadily releasing music into the 2000s and 2010s, releasing a couple of compilation albums of his greatest hits as well as a number of new albums featuring entirely new material.\n\nIn addition to working on his own music, Adams has written and produced songs and albums for a number of other musicians as well, working with Rod Stewart, Sting, and Eric Clapton, among many others. He has also embarked on a large number of global tours with other artists and often participates in tribute concerts to honor the work of other musicians.\n\nAdams's success throughout the decades has been commemorated by a number of high-profile awards. He has been nominated for 56 Grammy Awards and received a total of 15. He has also been nominated for the Juno Awards 20 times and has received three Academy Awards nominations, along with five Golden Globe Awards. He has been given the title of Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his contributions to music and his philanthropic work. He has been inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and has received the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nPhilanthropy and Activism\n\nIn addition to music, Adams is heavily involved in a number of humanitarian causes, most of which is done through his own foundation, the Bryan Adams Foundation. The foundation provides financial grants to various projects around the world with the aim of improving people's quality of life.\n\nHe has also used his musical talents for humanitarian purposes, participating in Live Aid in 1985 and the Amnesty International tour in 1986. He also has performed on Greenpeace Albums and has performed in a number of other charity concerts for causes like the Rainforest Foundation Fund, Farm Aid, UNICEF, Live 8, and for individuals affected by various natural disasters. In 2006, Adams became the first Western artist to perform in Pakistan following the September 11 attacks in 2001. He also performed in Tel Aviv in a concert series aimed at helping de-escalate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIn 2015, Adams received the \"Allan Slaight Humanitarian Spirit Award,\" which acknowledged all of Adams's social activism work and involvement in various humanitarian causes.\n\nHe has also been involved in animal rights activism, working with Greenpeace, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International organization, and various anti-whaling organizations.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAdams has never been married, though he has been involved in a few serious relationships. He dated Danish model Cecilie Thomas in the 1990s and then Alicia Grimaldi, who was formerly his personal assistant but has since become the trustee and co-founder of his foundation. The couple has had two daughters together and splits their time primarily between Paris and London. Adams also advocates for a vegan and plant-based diet, as he has been vegan since 1989."
