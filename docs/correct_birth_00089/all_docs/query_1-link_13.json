        "text": "This is the article about the person. For the article about the homonymous album see Bryan Adams (album).\n\nBryan Adams is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter, musician, producer, and photographer. He is known for his distinctive raspy voice.\n\nLife[]\n\nBryan Guy Adams was born on November 5, 1959 in Kingston, Ontario in Canada. His parents had emigrated in the 1950s from Plymouth, England to Canada. Bryan was raised in Ottawa where he attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of East Ottawa. In 1974, he moved together with his mother and his younger brother Bruce to North Vancouver while his father was abroad as a foreign service diplomat.\n\nBryan has never been married. He and Alicia Grimaldi, his former personal assistant and now co-founder of the Bryan Adams foundation, have two daughters (born 2011 and 2013).\n\nCareer[]\n\nAdams had been working with various bands in the Vancouver music scene.
