He’s got the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia under his belt, and we could go on and on and on!\n\nToday, at 57, Bryan Adams is bouncing around Canada for the ‘Get Up Tour’, working on music for the musical rendition of ‘Pretty Woman’ – oh! – And playing family man to his two young daughters, Mirabella and Lula!"
