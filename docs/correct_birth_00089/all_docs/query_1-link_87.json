        "text": "Born on November 5, 1959, in Canada, Bryan Adams has left an indelible mark on the music industry. with hits like “Please Forgive Me” (1993) and “Everything I Do (I Do It For You)” (1991). The Grammy Award-winning artist boasts an impressive career spanning decades, earning recognition for his exceptional musical talent and powerful performances.\n\nAccording to Kuldar Leis, CEO of European Capital of Culture Tartu 2024, the concert promises to be a memorable and nostalgic experience with Adams’ best hits of all time. “I have constantly heard Adams over the decades on various radio channels in Estonia. Now there is a chance to see him rocking out on the stage at Tartu as if I remember the summer 40 years ago, when I was a teenager and one of his most famous hits “Summer of ’69” was released,” said Leis.\n\nAdams, who taught himself how to play guitar at an early age, quickly rose to prominence in the 1980s, becoming one of the most popular and successful recording artists of the era. At age 15, Adams replaced Nick Gilder as the lead singer of glam rock band Sweeney Todd. By the age of 20, his eponymous debut album was released, marking the beginning of a remarkable career that has seen him rise to global stardom. Adams’s 1983 top-ten album, “Cuts Like a Knife”, featuring hits like its title track and the ballad “Straight From the Heart”, propelled him to fame in North America.\n\nHis next Canadian and US number one album, “Reckless”, became the first album by a Canadian to be certified diamond in Canada. It featured six charting singles, including “Run to You” and “Summer of ’69”, both top-ten hits in the US and Canada, and the power ballad “Heaven”, a US number one hit.\n\nAdams continued to dominate the charts with the release of “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You” in 1991, a global sensation that topped the charts in at least 19 countries, including 16 straight weeks at number one in the UK. The song, part of the album “Waking Up the Neighbours”, sold over 15 million copies worldwide, contributing to the album’s worldwide success with 16 million copies sold.\n\nRecognized for his exceptional songwriting, Adams has produced chart-topping ballads like “Please Forgive Me” (1993), “All for Love” (1993), and “Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?” (1995). His 1993 greatest hits compilation, “So Far So Good,” sold 13 million copies worldwide and achieved multi-platinum status in various countries. His latest album “So Happy It Hurts” was nominated for Grammy Award.\n\n“Creating something from nothing in that way is basically magic, without the trickery,” muses Adams when asked about his creative process. “It’s not easy, it takes a lot of work to get there, sometimes you don’t even know what you’ve done it until you look back at the work, or listen to the tape. Sometimes the moment is so small, you miss it. It’s like mining for diamonds.”\n\nBryan Adams, a recipient of 20 Juno Awards, a Grammy Award, and numerous other accolades, has been inducted into prestigious halls of fame, including the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Canada’s Walk of Fame, and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to his musical prowess, Bryan Adams has made significant contributions as a photographer, with works ranging from fashion shots to advertising campaigns for renowned brands. His collections, including “Wounded” (2013) and “Untitled” (2016), reflect his creative depth and artistic vision beyond the realm of music.\n\n“I think the mark of a great song, photo or a painting is something you can remember,” said Adams recently. “It’s kind of that simple. That’s not to say other photos or paintings aren’t great; if it moved you or if it inspired you, then it’s great. Of course, great is subjective, because the same thing to someone else might not have any effect. But if you work at it, there will be times when the intangible becomes tangible and for a moment… You are a wizard.”\n\nThe upcoming concert at Tartu Song Festival Grounds promises to be a spectacular event, featuring a repertoire of Adams’s greatest hits and captivating stage presence. Fans can anticipate an immersive experience, with Adams’s signature sound resonating across the picturesque venue.\n\nPresale for the Bryan Adams performance on July 7th, 2024, at Tartu Song Festival Grounds will be available for Tartu 2024 newsletter subscribers and Live Nation Estonia members starting January 24th at 10 a.m. Public sale will begin on January 26th at 10 a.m. at Piletilevi sales points and webpage."
