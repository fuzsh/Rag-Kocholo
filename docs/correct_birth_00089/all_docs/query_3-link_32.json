He's had many relationships with many beautiful and famous women, but he doesn't publicize or talk about his private life much, and he's never married or had any children (so far as public sources have reported).\n\nHe has a new girlfriend now that he had a baby with. No news on what her name is yet.\n\nBryan Adams is a Canadian singer known for his song \"Everything I Do, I Do It For You\". He is not married, but is dating Alicia Grimaldi."
