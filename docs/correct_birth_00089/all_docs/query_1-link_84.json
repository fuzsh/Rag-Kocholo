        "text": "You are a complex person, with contradictory impulses and desires. Although your rational mind is highly developed, the most significant realm of your psychology is your subconscious. Therein, a conflict between understanding and feeling is raging, between the psychological functions of thought and sensation. Until this conflict subsides, you might feel a sensation of emptiness. You are troubled by and unable to explain this feeling, which leads you to adopt an attitude of doubt and skepticism. This conflict, and its various ramifications, are the main obstacle to your individuation. Your task consists of becoming the master of the energies of your subconscious, and developing your consciousness in terms of the hidden and invisible. Your evolution will occur through a series of metamorphoses and rebirths. However, at certain points in your life, despite your caution and clear thinking, you find yourself in situations you neither desired nor planned, as a result of explosions and eruptions of the elements fermenting in your psyche. You always survive the worst physical, emotional, or intellectual tests, however, fairly unscathed, because of your ability to be reborn and start afresh. As a partner, you might struggle to make compromises. You may appear frosty and distant at times, and you have a taste for challenging, provocative remarks. With yourself, as well as with others, you are sometimes excessive and complicated. In a discussion, you will express strong, honest opinions. In crisis situations, you wish for your efforts to be noticed. You are obsessed with the problem of death. You tend to believe it holds the secret of life – that death can be overcome. Sometimes your anxiety about death is expressed as a search for answers – how can one learn to live with death, how can one detach oneself from the past and its flesh-curdlingly morbid realities… Decay, immobility, ultimate delivery – these images, which are all symbolically associated with death, sometimes haunt you.\n\nIntellectually, you have powerfully developed intellectual faculties which yield the maximum effectiveness for your behavior. Deductive, analytical, prospective, you are at once a researcher, a detective, and a scientist. You are fairly introverted, and your discrimination tends to direct you toward the spheres of inner life. You are astute at drawing rational parallels between phenomena of different origins. Your love life will be subject to desire and passion. But since you are more aroused by ideas and fantasies, you may experience lulls in intensity. When you yield to your penchant for emotional upheaval and your desire for coercion and pleasure\n\nDue to the influence of Capricorn rising, Bryan Adams has a personality which may seem somewhat aloof and introspective. In fact, he is not inclined to submit to anyone’s influence, and leads the independent, solitary life of the individualist. Sometimes skeptical (if not pessimistic) and resigned, he is still shrewd and objective in his insights and judgments. He has a fairly severe, “no-frills” vision of life, and only the pure, bare essence really matters to him. Insecurities could inhibit his emotional and instinctive urges. He is proud of his near-stoic self-control. His personal stability tends to be founded on enduring values – philosophical or hard scientific facts in relation to spiritual values. Sometimes he seems detached and weary or disillusioned, and he does not appreciate the social whirl. He does not readily express his feelings and emotions, but deep inside, he has great sensitivity. His sense of time, a true instinct, is very important. It rules and coordinates all of his activities.\n\nBryan Adams believes that by gaining total control of his intellect, feelings, and instincts, he can achieve them.\n\nBryan Adams has a somewhat secretive personality; he is tempted if not compelled to live a somewhat withdrawn life.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Capricorn (the Goat), while the sun was passing through the sign of Scorpio (the Scorpion). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nPugnacity – Need for security – Charisma – Inhibition – Dignity – Application – Shrewdness – Methodical mind – Concentration – Forethought – Optimism – Loyalty – Common sense.\n\nAmbitious and passionate, but secretive and reserved, you have a stormy and sometimes difficult character. Dominating, you might show a certain edginess, repressing the expression of your sensitivity and mocking that side of others. But you are short-tempered and vulnerable, and react with causticity when you feel your ego is threatened. Your keen and penetrating intelligence and your lucidity make you curious about the hidden aspects of things—the action behind the scenes. As a result, you may take pleasure in divulging people’s emotional secrets. But on another level, you can expose the dysfunctional elements of something, resulting in a positive change. Your endurance and stubbornness give you the energy necessary for long-term projects. You alone can decide whether your goals will satisfy your own personal ambition, or a more vast and humanistic ideal.\n\nBryan Adams was born on the crescent moon three and a half to seven days after the rising of the new moon. He is said to be a “soli-lunar” lunar type, indicating that he may need to make an effort to free himself from the past. Something related to his childhood, parents, or ancestors is holding him back, impairing his effectiveness and could stand to be overcome. Due to his past, Bryan Adams refuses tried-and-true models, is always fighting to justify his innovative viewpoints, and tends to break away from tradition. He is hardly ever aware that he is making career and lifestyle choices which are based on an urge to modify his relationship to society, and the rigid standards and models from the past."
