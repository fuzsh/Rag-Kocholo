        "text": "Canada has given the world a few things. Apart from being the North American sibling of the USA that everyone loves, he has provided icons like Ryan Reynolds of Deadpool, Justin Bieber, Celine Dion, Justin Trudeau and more. However, another name to add to this list is Bryan Adams, a music icon who is a Canadian citizen and one of the greatest and most popular musicians in the world. His song, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) was and continues to be a worldwide favorite. He has been in the industry as a professional singer since 1975 and has since written his name in the annals of history. Learn more about the music legend below.\n\nBiography of Bryan Adams\n\nEven though the rest of the world wakes up every morning grateful that a musician like Bryan Adams is with them, the first to celebrate Bryan were his parents, Elizabeth Jane and Captain Conrad J. Adams on November 5, 1959. He was born in Kingston, Ontario, from parents who were diplomatic envoys to Canada in the 1950s. Adams first got a taste of traveling from one country to another through his parents, whom he followed as they traveled from places like Lisbon, Portugal, to Tel Aviv, Israel, on diplomatic assignments. He is the first born of his parents, with a brother called Bruce. For his education, Adams attended Colonel By High School in Ottawa East.\n\nBryan Adams’ impressive career is not only defined by things like the quality of his music and his popularity, but also his longevity. After being relocated to North Vancouver by his family in 1974 at the age of 15, he began to explore the music scene in Vancouver. When he had spent two years in Vancouver, he was already a singer for the group Sweeney Todd. Bryan continued to sing for Sweeney Todd for a few years until he met Jim Vallance when he was 18. The fateful meeting with Vallance in a random music store was the beginning of a decisive partnership.\n\nThrough Vallance and the recording of a couple demo songs, Bryan Adams was signed to his first label, A&M records in 1978. The signing provided the platform for Bryan Adams to record and release his debut album, Bryan Adams. The self-titled album was released in 1980. Although it was not the commercial and worldwide success that Bryan would have liked, it enhanced his popularity in his home country and upon the release of his third album, Cut Like a Knife, he achieved international success.\n\nThe songs on this album made him an international music star, with the album reaching platinum status in the United States and Canada. Since becoming an international music star, he has continued to release more albums, totaling 13 albums released and a 14th album slated for 2019.\n\nHis songwriting skills, which were the foundation of his success as a musician, also made him a bit of a movie song whisperer. Bryan Adams lent his talents to write music for several films, many of which would become critical and commercial successes such as Never Give Up for ‘The Guardian’, I’ll Never Break My Faith for ‘Bobby’ and (All That I do) I do it for you.\n\nBryan Adams is also a notable animal rights activist, photographer, and philanthropist. He has 6 photographic publications and has more than 30 exhibitions to his credit. Among his music awards, including the Grammys and Junos, he has won photography awards such as Lead Awards and an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nNet value\n\nDespite being a notable philanthropist, who has done incredible work through his foundation, the Bryan Adams Foundation where he has helped advance and spread education across the globe, with enough impact to receiving the Order of British Columbia and the Order of Canada, he still boasts a massive net worth of $65 million.\n\nEverything you need to know about Bryan Adams\n\nHe is an accomplished guitarist, harmonica and pianist.\n\nHe was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.\n\nDespite a slow commercial start to his musical career, Bryan Adams was able to sell over 75 million records.
