        "text": "Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams rose to fame with the release of his third album, \"Cuts Like a Knife\" (1983). The album made him popular throughout the United States. However, it was his fourth album \"Reckless\" (1984), which is referred to as one of the best albums of the decade that made him an international superstar and gave him his first Grammy nomination. The album also sold four million copies at the time. In 1987, he released his fifth album \"Into the Fire\", a more social conscious album. The album yielded a top ten single \"Heat of the Night\", another Grammy nomination and another platinum album to his name.\n\nHowever, he released the album \"Waking Up the Neighbours\" (1991) which included the single \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\". The song sold more than three million copies in the United States, becoming the second best selling single, second only to \"We Are the World\". The song was also Adams' first Academy Award nomination and Golden Globe nomination as the song was written for the movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991). \"Waking Up the Neighbours\" sold four million albums in the United States and garnered him six Grammy nominations (a record for a Canadian). He won one for best song written specifically for a motion picture or television (\"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\").\n\nIn 1993, Adams released a greatest hits album, titled \"So Far So Good\", which spawned a #1 single, \"Please Forgive Me\". That same year, he sang the single \"All for Love\" with Rod Stewart and Sting from the movie The Three Musketeers (1993), which became a #1 single reaching across Europe and North America. He released the single \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" from the movie Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which became his fourth #1 single and his second Academy Award nomination. He became one of two non-American singers to have four number one hits and the most successful Canadian singer ever.\n\nIn 1996, Adams released the album \"18 Til I Die\", which has garnered him another two Grammy nominations. Later that year, he wrote and sang the single \"I Finally Found Someone\", a duet with Barbra Streisand for her movie, The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996). \"I Finally Found Someone\" became a top ten single and won Adams his third Academy Award nomination. He released three more albums since then, \"MTV Unplugged\" (1997), \"On a Day Like Today\" (1998) and most recently the songs for the DreamWorks animated movie Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002) in which Adams earned his second Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Song\".\n\nBryan Adams was awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia for his contributions to popular music and philanthropic work through his own foundation, which helps improve education for people around the world."
