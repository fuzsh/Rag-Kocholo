        "text": "If you are a faithful reader of this blog then you will be aware that I was born and raised on the east coast of Canada on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. I grew up with the sound of the fog horn’s lullaby, the smell of the salt air and knowledge and humility that comes with living beside something as mighty as the Atlantic Ocean. My home town of Glace Bay was a coastal town. Both of our main industries were heavily influenced by the sea and the geography that it helped to form. If you didn’t work in the fishing and coal mining industries yourself then you certainly knew dozens of people who did. Glace Bay wasn’t a fancy town by any stretch. It was populated with good people who worked hard to make a living for their families. The rugged nature of the land in combination with the blue collar nature of many of the folks who lived there helped to form a proud cultural backdrop to much of the poetry, music and art that was created while I was growing up as a proud Cape Bretoner myself. Singers like Rita MacNeil, Bruce Guthro, Matt MInglewood and others along with bands such as the Rankin Family, The Barra MacNeils and Glace Bay’s own the coal mining chorale, The Men of the Deeps all sang songs about the sea, about the sense of community that existed on the island and about the history of how it all came to be. There was a universality to the music that caused me to believe that it all aligned with the core values of what was meant to be a Canadian. When I left Cape Breton Island for the greener pastures of larger centres, I took that Cape Breton culture with me. It doesn’t matter how long I have been away, I still tear up whenever I hear the song “We Are An Island” no matter who happens to be singing it at the time. That anthem of my island is embedded in my soul. No amount of wandering can change that.\n\nI thought a lot about this in relation to the subject of today’s post, Corb Lund. Lund was born and raised in Taber, Alberta. Taber is actually twice as close to the Canada-U.S. border crossing at Coutts, Alberta than it is to the nearest major Canadian city of Calgary. Lund’s parents came to Taber as part of a series of cattle migrations that saw species such as highland cows moved from the U.S. midwest up into Canada. Taber, Alberta is a farming community and is specifically known for its corn. In fact, Taber is considered by many to be the corn growing capital of the world. Not surprisingly, Corb Lund grew up on a farm. Lund, like many of the people in his family and his social circle, have lived the farming life for generations. They know the fundamentals of soil and irrigation the same way that the people from my hometown know the sea and the tides. Corb Lund grew up working with his hands and like many children who grew up on a farm, he grew into a man who was very big and strong and capable of fixing things on his own. There is something about the vastness of prairie farmland and the big sky nature of daily life that has often caused many a young farm person’s thoughts to turn toward music. The most common manifestation of that is how closely Country and Western music is associated with farmers and cowboys and with working class life on the land. That many famous Country singers have donned cowboy hats, for example, further solidifies that genre’s connection to those who make their living in this world from the land. The funny thing about Corb Lund was that, initially, he did not gravitate toward a career on the land nor in Country and Western music. When Corb Lund was a teenager, he and a friend set off in search of a musical education. They ended up five hours to the north in Edmonton at a school known for, of all things, Jazz music. Although Jazz was not the genre that interested him, Corb Lund was happy to have left Taber and find himself in a city that was bigger and offered more diversions and opportunities. One of the things that Edmonton had over Taber was the sheer number of bars and nightclubs that offered live music. At one of those nightclubs, Lund found himself at a punk rock show. As you may know from my series on punk rock Who’s Punk?! What’s the Score?!, the ethos of the punk rock scene was often DIY in nature. Bands handled their own staging, promotions, sound and lights, merch. sales and so on. In that way, they remained in control of the music they produced and eliminated the corporate interference that came with signing major label record deals. The show that Corb Lund had wandered into was a concert by Edmonton punk legends SNFU. The lead singer of SNFU was a man named Ken Chinn who went by the stage name Chi Pig. ***(Chi Pig recently passed away. His death was mourned in Edmonton as a great loss. You can read an article about his legacy here . This article is from a website known as Broke-Ass Stuart’s Website which you can reach here). The experience of watching that concert changed Corb Lund’s life in a very profound and fundamental way. Prior to that SNFU show, Lund had laboured under the belief that creating music and reaching an audience was some mysterious process that required the help of music executives and other folks with specialized skills. Up until the SNFU show, Lund had never realized that absolutely anyone could make music and that there was an audience for every type of music as long as that music came from the heart. If the music you created was good and your skills were sharp enough then people would find you. It really was as simple as that.\n\nImpressed with what he learned at the SNFU show, Corb Lund and his buddies decided to form their own punk band and head out on the road. Lund’s punk band was called The Smalls. This band became such a cult favourite in Alberta and western Canada that they became the subject of a feature documentary called The Smalls: Forever is a Long Time. *(you can watch the trailer for that documentary here). The Smalls toured relentlessly, as many smaller bands do. But instead of touring from east to west, as Canada is defined geographically, The Smalls toured north to south. They were equally as popular in American border states like Wyoming, Colorado and Montana as they were in the Canadian prairies. However, after touring for a while, it started becoming clear to Corb Lund that the potential for growth for a prairie punk band like The Smalls was limited. They were popular but not likely to grow much beyond what they had already achieved. As Lund was thinking these thoughts, he began to notice that many of his punk contemporaries were starting to incorporate acoustic guitars into their shows and their songwriting. Punk was definitely taking on a country air. Corb Lund saw this as a sign that his music could be more that speed metal and thrashing guitars. So he decided to end his time with The Smalls and launch a solo career that would be filled with music that drew on Jazz, Country and Rock music elements. This transition happened also around the same time as a band from Hanna, Alberta (just up the road a bit from Taber) called Nickelback was starting to gain some traction in the world of music. While Nickelback opted to head in a more straight-forward rock direction, Corb Lund turned toward country and western music. That decision has been one of the best of his life. He is now considered to be one of, if not, the biggest music star in Canadian Country music today.\n\nOne of the things that helped Corb Lund and his band the Hurtin’ Albertans to gain an audience was the authenticity of their music. The bands I grew up listening to back home like The Rankin Family all sang of people, places and events that had some personal, geographical or historical connection to the island of Cape Breton, to the ocean and to the Maritime provinces, in general. That band earned the respect of thousands of Maritime Canadians because we knew that what they sang about was true. Their music corresponded to the reality of the lives that we actually were living. The truth behind their music was very real. Take that regional truth and apply it to the farming/oil production world of Alberta and, instead of The Rankins, you have Corb Lund.\n\nCorb Lund rose to the top of his field because he wrote songs that were about people, places and subjects that arose from the lives of the real people who lived in Alberta and the Prairies. It is not for nothing that Lund has songs about highland cows, oil rig workers and farmers in his discography. To date in his solo career, Lund has recorded eleven albums and has three Gold records. He performs everywhere in Canada and the world but has the most success emulating the path trod by The Smalls, using the north-south farmland corridor that exists in North America. He is also very popular in Australia where there is a long history of farming, too. The song that I have chosen for today’s post is called “Truck Got Stuck”. I find this song to be hilarious. I don’t know Lund enough to know if comedy was the intent here but, regardless, this song makes me giggle. It is a simple story concept that centres on a pickup truck getting stuck in the mud on a farm after a sudden downpour of rain. One farm boy after another all show up with their own trucks to help pull the original truck out of the mud. But, one after the other, the new arrivals get their trucks stuck, too. While “Truck Got Stuck” comes off as a humorous song, it also draws upon several real truths of life in Taber, Alberta and in communities all across the prairies. For example, the community feel to life in a farming town is accurately portrayed. When someone needs help and sends out a call for assistance, your friends and neighbours arrive to help. That is part of the cultural glue that makes small farming towns the close knit communities they tend to be. The fact that rain and soil conditions come into play also highlights a fact of life on a farm. Farms need rain but too much rain is not a good thing, either. This is not the throw-away plot element that it may seem to be at first. In these times of climate change, the future of agriculture in Canada is not as stable and secure as it once was. Rain and soil is as important to an Albertan as rising sea levels are to a Maritimer. Finally, the song closes by taking a shot at a federal government agency known as Agriculture Canada. It is true that many residents of the prairies hold a somewhat less than enthusiastic view of the Feds who make their rules from far away in Central Canada. That sentiment finds a place in the closing lines of “Truck Got Stuck”. As a result, this humorous song ends up cutting a little closer to the bone than it may appear upon first listen. Once again, Corb Lund’s lyrics ring true.\n\nWhile Canada may be a geographically large country, it features elements of regionalism that help to define individual areas. Good people are good people no matter where they all live but the issues that affect us in Ontario are not always the same as those in the Prairies nor the same as those on the east coast or west of the Rockies or way up north in the Arctic. Sometimes I find myself getting caught up in my own interpretation of regionalism with my Cape Breton sensibilities. As genuine as those feelings may be, I am sure that Corb Lund and his fan base would have views that differ from mine but which would be just as valid as anything I have experienced and know to be true. It behooves us all to keep this in mind as a new general election draws near. There are those seeking the office of Prime Minister who would seek to prey upon those regional differences to pit people and political parties against one another. That needn’t be the case. I have always believed that learning new things from people who live differently than I do is one way I grow as a human. Thus, I listen to the music of Corb Lund as he sings about oil rigs and cattle and, instead of shaking my head at it all because it doesn’t reflect my reality, I slow down, allowing him the opportunity to paint a picture of those good people from his world for me. As a result, I grow a little. Growing up on Cape Breton Island taught me to have respect for those who toil with their hands and backs each day. Honest work is honest work, whether it takes place in a coal mine or a fishing trawler or a wheat field or a cattle ranch or an oil rig. I respect the effort involved and the people who make it. Thus, I enjoy the music of Corb Lund, even though it is not my standard musical fare. Lund makes good music that serves to tell the stories of the people in his world. He does so with humour, with attention to detail and with respect. The success that he has achieved speaks for itself.

The end of the school year is a funny time for all whose lives revolve around bells and timetables. Slightly over a decade ago I attempted to put into words the mixture of emotions that teachers feel as the final days of such an intense personal and collective journey draw to their conclusion. Way back in my days on Blogger, I wrote these words. Please give them a quick read.\n\nJune and July\n\nIt is the day after the last day of school.\n\nI am sitting at my desk in my classroom. Except for me, the room is empty. It is very quiet.\n\nAs I look out at the room, it seems hard to believe that, a mere 24 hours ago, this space was filled with the energy, words and body heat of my students. Yesterday, this space was a beehive of activity and excitement and anxiety as the kids shared their last social moments together before heading off on their separate ways for the summer break. Today, there is no one here who requires my counsel, my knowledge or my sense of calm to take the edge off their own amped up sensibilities. Today, I am left alone with my thoughts. My time is my own.\n\nI tidy the papers on my desk for the final time.\n\nBefore me sit the remnants of a frenetic last month of activity: results from school-level and area track and field meets (I coached the running events), a programme from the closing awards ceremony (where I presented eight awards), the agenda from our last staff meeting (where we discussed teaching assignments for next year, extra-curricular responsibilities, school-wide academic goals and so on), my class list for next year, as well as the class lists that contain the names of my students from this year, all neatly divided up and sorted into what are, hopefully, workable pairings/groups based on ability, social compatibility and gender, my copy of the consumable order (pencils, pens, paper, notebooks, etc.) which has already arrived, been inventoried and stored away in freshly dusted cupboards, and a sheaf of permission forms for the students to travel to the end of the year school picnic that I helped to organize down at the park by the waterfront.\n\nMost importantly, I have my final academic report cards to sign and file. That truly closes out the year. Our shared journey together ends with my assessment of their accomplishments (or lack thereof) and, in doing so, my own assessment of how successful my year as their teacher has been. In neat, organized little boxes sit paragraphs of pronouncements on the state of each child’s personal evolution and, at the end, the letters of reaction from their parents once the report cards had gone home. Meetings of concern or complaint have, by now, been held and dealt with as best suited each situation. Discussions have been held, strategies mapped out and arrangements made for those students who require extra support for the coming year. I have notes from students asking, privately and nervously, who their teacher will be for the coming year, will they be in the same class as their friends, what is the state of their marks? I have assuaged their anxiety as best I could, but now, all of the unknowns are known and the residue of their relieved or bitter responses blanket my mind and my heart.\n\nIt always comes down to this.\n\nA school year, whose foundation is built upon personal trust between teachers and students, culminates in a crescendo of emotions ranging from gratitude to anger to indifference on behalf of those whose world you were the center of mere days ago. The evidence of this human interaction lays in piles of papers on my dusty desk, awaiting their time to be filed and stored in a secure location. In a year or two, I will stumble upon these track and field results and wonder why I bothered to keep them, but, for now, they are evidence of my purpose as an educator and my relationship with the students whose lives I am purported to have touched.\n\nSo, in the solitude of my room, I file and tidy until my desktop is bare.\n\nThe bulletin boards have been stripped during the past few weeks. The students’ desks have been emptied and stacked neatly in one corner of the room, revealing an always surprisingly large amount of floor space. The bookshelves have been dusted, book bins sorted and wiped. Art supplies, cleaned and kept, or else discarded, depending on their state. Science equipment, put back from whence it came behind cupboard doors. The floor swept. Curtains drawn. Computers powered down. Whiteboards erased. Everything is done. Nothing remains here for me to do.\n\nI am no one’s teacher any longer. It is time for Mr. MacInnes to go home.\n\nThe school year always begins with an empty classroom, a teacher and groups of young boys and girls. And, so it ends, with a teacher and the ghosts of those relationships.\n\nI take one last look around the classroom that has been home to so much activity and marvel at how peaceful and serene it all appears to me now. It is so, so quiet. And empty.\n\nThere is nothing left to do.\n\nI gather up the dusty family photos that sat atop my desk all year, wipe them clean and pack them for home.\n\nI close the door.\n\nExit the building.\n\nWalk into the warm sunshine of summer.\n\nAlone.\n\nSilently.\n\nThis is always how it begins. This thing we call Summer.\n\nJune and July by Tom MacInnes, 2014.\n\nAs much as I always found the annual summertime transition from classroom teacher to regular Joe to be somewhat disorienting, it is nothing compared to what my eldest daughter Leah is about to experience. A few days from now, she will graduate from high school. As milestones go in life, this is one of the bigger ones along the way. The end of highschool marks the symbolic end of childhood. The acceptance of that graduation diploma represents the proverbial cutting of strings from the mittens of each person who began their school career as a child wearing rubber boots and a backpack covered in cartoon characters, wanting nothing more from life than to read a good book, have fun with their friends and maybe enjoy a cold chocolate milk along the way. Now, when that walk across the graduation stage is over and the applause has subsided and the photos have been snapped, what awaits is the world of adulthood. The responsibility that comes with accepting that graduation diploma is nothing less than the awesome task of saving the planet from overheating and our species from becoming extinct. For my daughter, I would be equally happy if she simply lived a happy, healthy life and got to experience how love feels when it finds your heart.\n\nNeedless to say, as graduation draws near, we are all filled with the mixed emotions that arise when faced with change. We have always been a family that functions best on organization and routine. We take comfort in predictability. For that reason, it is not surprising that we have all been engaging in doses of wistful nostalgia lately. Our lives together as a family have been good so far. Our memories are mainly happy ones. It is because of those trips down memory lane that we arrive at today’s latest pit stop on the Great Canadian Road Trip, a small but special place known to us as the Merwin Greer woods.\n\nAs new parents, you are faced with an avalanche of life-altering decisions with regard to the health and happiness of your newborn child. Some of those decisions can be researched and arrived at with a fair degree of confidence that the choice you have made for your child is a good one. However, some other choices are made in a more random fashion with the hope that it will all somehow work out for the best in the end. This is sorta, kinda what happened when it came time for our eldest daughter to start her school career. I know that some parents “shop” for schools that they feel will give their child some sort of competitive advantage in life. For us, we basically had a simple choice between two schools. One school had a population of over 800 students and offered French Immersion programming. The other school was a small community school that was actually the one within the neighbourhood boundary in which we lived. That school has never had much more than 100 students the whole time we have lived in our home. It also did not offer French Immersion programming. After some consideration of the pros and cons of each school, we opted for the smaller community school experience. While our daughter bemoans not having a level of fluency in French that would have come with enrolment at the larger school, we, as her parents, have never regretted our decision. The small community school experience was wonderful for both of our girls. We loved the staff at the girls’ school. We loved getting to know the other families who made up that school community. We also liked that both of our daughters established good relationships with their classmates and also with their teachers. All things considered, the memories of elementary school that both girls possess are warm ones. This brings us to today’s song, “Jackpot”, by Jocelyn Alice.\n\nJocelyn Alice is a Calgary born singer who has had one Top 40 hit in her career, and “Jackpot” is that song. She originally gained fame as a contestant on a pre-American Idol style talent show called Popstars, finishing in the runner-up spot the year she competed. Alice decided to give a career in singing a go and formed a band with a friend of hers that they called Jocelyn and Lisa. That partnership failed to make it in the world of music, so Jocelyn Alice opted to try out a solo career. On her debut album released in 2016 was a song called “Jackpot”. It cracked the Top 40 in Canada and the U.S. and earned her an invitation to sing the Canadian national anthem at the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star game in Miami. Unfortunately, Alice botched the anthem by giggling throughout it. She received much criticism and has yet to be heard from again on a national scale. If “Jackpot” remains as the only song of hers to earn airplay, then it will have been worth it for no other reason than that this song has meaning for my eldest daughter. It is meaning that is coming into play as her graduation date draws near.\n\nOne of the things that Leah associates with her time at her tiny elementary school is safety. I don’t use that word in terms of a fear of dangerous things happening. That school was a bucolic setting if there ever was one. There was nothing to worry about in terms of violence or bullying. Instead, when I mention the word safety, I am talking about the emotional warmth that comes from spending time with good people who care about your wellbeing. That is the key attribute that helped make our children’s elementary school experience so valuable. They spent their formative days in an environment where everyone knew everybody else, and there was always someone there who cared about you and how you were feeling. As part of her time there, Leah has fond memories of the role music played in establishing that sense of community. Music was played at assemblies, during Christmas concerts put on for the school community, during celebrations for birthdays and the birth of new babies, as well as when fundraising rallies were held for a teacher who had developed cancer. Songs such as “Brave” by Sara Bareilles, “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten, “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang, all became songs that formed the soundtrack to those formative years. The staff and teachers at that tiny school knew that music helps create emotions and that as part of their deliberate plan to create a caring atmosphere for children like ours, there would be music played that had meaning for the kids. I wrote a previous post about how the song “That Power” by will i am featuring Justin Beiber was used at school that you can read here.\n\nAnd so it was this past weekend that my two daughters came upstairs at one point muttering and mumbling about a song called “Jackpot”, asking me if I knew it. Leah said that the song was stuck in her head. She insisted that I would recognize the tune if I heard it. So I immediately took her up on that challenge and called the song up on YouTube. She was right. I recognized it immediately, as will you if you choose to give it a listen. “Jackpot” may be Jocelyn Alice’s only hit song, but it was one of those ubiquitous songs of the summer that seem to pop up year after year, and, as such, it is a song that I am sure we will be hearing on the radio at random times for many years to come.\n\nAs for Leah, “Jackpot” was also one of those soundtrack songs from her elementary school career. It is a song that she associates with feelings of warmth and security at a time when a huge life change approaches. As we all know, the one constant in life is change. We all go through periods of transition at various times in our lives. Some of those transitions are familiar, such as the end of the school year was for me. That didn’t make those changes in routine any less jarring as I went through them year after year. But, guess what? I survived them all and have lived to tell the tale in blog posts such as this one. However, other changes are less familiar. They are giant leaps into the unknown. That is more like what Leah is facing as she prepares to walk across that graduation stage in a few days. She has had a safe and happy childhood to this point. We know it, but more importantly, she knows it, too. A period of life that was filled with warm fuzzies concludes with a handshake from her principal, a round of applause from the audience and a series of photos from those who love her most. Then, she walks off that stage and the next phase of life begins. As parents, we are confident that Leah will do well in whatever path she chooses to follow. Leah is not so confident. Straying from the familiar can be scary. The one thing that she needs to remember is how it feels to be loved and to know you are safe and cared for. Part of what will help her to remember those feelings are songs such as “Jackpot” by Jocelyn Alice. We all need songs in our lives that remind us of the good times. “Jackpot” and “Celebration” and “Brave” and “That Power” all do for Leah. I am eternally grateful to the staff at Merwin Greer Public School for giving my daughter the gift of music and linking it with such positive memories that she can take forward with her into adulthood.\n\nOn the very same day that Leah walks across that graduation stage, those teachers at Merwin Greer P.S. will be spending their last day with the students in their own classrooms. It will be a day of parties and assemblies and cupcakes and freezies and, of course, of music. And then, the noise will subside, the students will pack up for the final time, the parents will offer their thank yous as they come to collect their children and then, suddenly, the world will grow still and quiet. Those same teachers will return to their classrooms and tidy them one final time…in solitude. It will seem surreal. Then they will pack up as well and go home to places where no one calls them Mrs. or Mr., simply mom or dad or Honey. Leah and several hundred other students like her will take their bows, pose for photos, be the centre of their own family celebrations, and then their world will still, too. Childhood will be over. The grand adventure that is adulthood awaits. The world will be theirs to enjoy and experience. And, of course, there will be music.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Jackpot” by Jocelyn Alice can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Jocelyn Alice can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

Cape Breton is a funny place in a way because it is difficult to grow up there as a completely unique, fresh-faced person with your own identity. Every one of us from there exists within the shadow cast by our family history. Whenever I return home for a holiday and am introduced to someone who is meeting me for the first time, inevitably I have to go through a process that I call “presenting my credentials”. This involves saying my name and then immediately following up with the names of my mother and my father and where they worked. This tends to lead to what church we went to, and what high school I attended back in the day. If the conversation really gets serious, then we may even discuss whether my family traditionally voted Liberal or Conservative, which, in turn, would be enough to determine if the potholes on your street got paved and if your son or daughter would be hired for employment on a summer grant. After presenting my credentials as a former Islander, the person I was meeting would then be able to place me within the patchwork quilt of relationships that have always existed back home. That placement of myself within the hierarchy of the island would determine whether I was offered either a handshake and a wish for a good visit while I was home, or else I was invited to sit down and have some tea. If tea was proffered, then that signified that my credentials had been approved.\n\nI couldn’t help thinking about this as I did the research for today’s post about the Canadian Indie Rock/Alternative band Metric. Metric is one of Canada’s leading alternative rock bands and have been for well over two decades now. They are fronted by lead singer Emily Haines, and include guitarist/keyboardist James Shaw, bassist Joshua Winstead and drummer Joules Scott-Key. Metric formed back in the early 2000s and have won several Juno awards, in addition to appearing on the soundtracks of cutting-edge movies and touring with some of the biggest bands in the world such as The Rolling Stones. I first came to know Metric in 2010 when they volunteered to sing as part of a larger benefit concert that was organized by K’naan to help raise money for earthquake relief in Haiti. During the live telethon that appeared on TV, Metric played an acoustic version of today’s song, “Help I’m Alive”. I thought that their performance was excellent, and I’ve been hooked on the band ever since. Because of that appearance, I soaked up all that they had to offer and fell in love with songs such as “Dead Disco”, “Sick Muse”, “Gimme Sympathy”, “Gold Gun Girls”, “Breathing Underwater” and a song from one of my favourite music posts to date, “Black Sheep” from the original motion picture soundtrack of the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (which you can read here). But the truth of the matter is that I knew about Emily Haines before I ever knew about her band. This is when we come to the part where I have to present her credentials, as it were. Because to know Emily Haines is to know an entire network of Canadian musicians and bands. This is also true of her own biological family, many of whom are successful on a national and international scale. Somewhere in the midst of all that exists a very talented woman named Emily Haines. Let’s get to know her a little bit better by asking a question that I might get asked if I was returning to Cape Breton…”Who’s yer fodder?” or “Who’s yer mudder?”. Here are Emily Haines’ credentials.\n\nEmily Haines was born in 1974 (which makes her just slightly older than my own wife). Haines was born in New Delhi, India. Her middle name is Savitri, which is based upon a famous epic poem from India. Her mudder/mother, Jo Hayward-Haines, ran a school for underprivileged children there and is a fairly accomplished painter and community activist. Her fodder/father is the poet and jazz critic Paul Haines. He is best known in Canada for his 1970s musical play Escalator Over the Hill in collaboration with artist Carla Bley, who, in turn, was one of the leaders in the “Free Jazz” movement of the 1960s. Emily’s sister is famed Canadian journalist Avery Haines, who, as of the typing of these words, is one of the co-hosts of the venerated journalistic institution on CTV called W5. Her brother Tim owns one of Peterborough, Ontario’s most eclectic record shops called Bluestreak Records. Both of Emily Haines’ parents are naturalized American citizens, which has allowed Emily to claim citizenship in three different countries (India, the United States and Canada). When Emily was just a child, she and her family settled in the Fenelon Falls area of Ontario. Fenelon Falls is approx. 45 minutes northeast of my home in Cobourg. It is in a part of Ontario generally referred to as cottage country. This bucolic town is located just a stone’s throw from Bobcaygeon, another town in cottage country that was made famous in a song that you can read about here. Not surprisingly, after growing up in a home filled with art and culture, Haines ended up enrolling in a special school known as Etobicoke School for the Arts. It was here that Emily Haines established a love for creating her own music. It was also where she met classmates who would go on to form some of Canada’s most respected bands. Thus, the upbringing she received from her biological family led Haines to a special school for artistically inclined people where she would end up developing relationships with people who would become her musical family. Some of these people included Amy Millan (who is co-lead singer of the terrific band Stars out of Montreal, and who has also been involved with another important band, Toronto’s Broken Social Scene). Haines also met singer, producer and pianist Kevin Drew (who would go on to be one of the founding members of Broken Social Scene. Drew also helped a dying Gord Downie to record his final two solo albums, as well as the important Indigenous album Secret Path). Haines, Millan and Drew would all be involved in the creation of one of my favourite albums of all time, Broken Social Scene’s 2002 classic You Forgot It in People. That album gave the world a variety of gems, including two of my personal favourites: “Lover’s Spit” (sung by Drew and frequently co-sung by Leslie Feist), along with “Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl” which is sung by Emily Haines. (You can watch/listen to that song here. The lyrics version is here). It was on “Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl” that I first came to know of Emily Haines as an artist. This led me, a few years later, to discover her as the leader of her own band, Metric, during that Haitian Relief telethon as she sang the acoustic version of “Help I’m Alive”. Which brings us back to the question of who actually is Emily Haines?\n\nAs I can personally attest, it is possible to be proud of the influences that you have in your formative years but also to become your own unique version of yourself as an adult. The shadow of our past never entirely recedes, but it does fade a little with the passing of time and the successes we achieve that fuel our personal journey out into the greater world that exists beyond that of our youth. Emily Haines comes by her artistic inclinations honestly. It is not surprising that a child who was raised in a rich artistic and literate environment would turn out to possess many of those same qualities as an adult. For Emily Haines, her personal artistic journey that began as a child and continued as a student at Etobicoke School for the Arts blossomed as she entered her twenties in the mid-1990s. While writing and performing her own material, Haines met a fellow young musician named James Shaw. She and Shaw hit it off personally and professionally and began writing and performing together. It was this partnership that eventually led to the creation of the band Metric. It was while Metric was first touring that Haines and Shaw got to discover not only how to make music that people would enjoy listening to but also how the business of making music for a living actually worked. They burned their own CDs and did the artwork for the front covers themselves. They designed their own t-shirts, too. All of which would be sold out of the trunks of their cars or the edge of the stages they were fortunate enough to sing upon. Word of mouth quickly spread. Metric was a band that was developing enough of a buzz that it came to the attention of the committee in charge of awarding the prestigious Polaris Prize. Thus, their second album, Live It Out, was longlisted for the Polaris Prize, bringing with it recognition for the band on a national scale. This happened on the heels of Broken Social Scene’s You Forgot It in People breaking through and helping to establish all of those band members as serious players in the Canadian music scene. A few years after Live It Out was longlisted for the Polaris Prize, Metric’s fourth album, Fantasies, (on which “Help I’m Alive”, “Gimme Sympathy”, “Gold Gun Girls” and “Sick Muse” all can be found) was shortlisted for that same prize. This album didn’t win that award, but it did earn the band the first of many Juno awards for Album of the Year, as well as Group of the Year. All together, Metric has won five Juno awards.\n\nI enjoy watching Emily Haines sing. She appears to me to be a woman who is confident in who she is and in how she presents herself to the world. She is nobody’s Barbie doll. Emily Haines has performed as a member of many successful bands and has now fully established herself as one of our country’s most powerful and talented voices as she fronts her own band and helps Metric to entrench its place in the hierarchy of our musical canon. I have a feeling that if Emily Haines was living and performing in the U.S. and Metric was an American band, that some clever marketing executive would have come along and devised a P.R. campaign around her good looks and strong voice and would have made her much more famous than she is in her home country of Canada. Here, she seems comfortable just being herself and letting that be enough to speak on her behalf. There is something tremendously “Canadian” about not waving our own flags when it comes to promoting ourselves on the world’s stage. But believe me when I tell you that Metric, as a band, and Emily Haines, as an artist, are both very much the real deal and are respected throughout the music industry as a whole. When it comes to ranking our current Canadian bands on the success of their careers, Metric comes in near the top of every list out there. Luckily enough for people who live in my area, Metric will be appearing at a free concert next month in neighbouring Peterborough as part of that city’s annual free concerts in the park series. That show is one that will be well worth checking out. At a time when it seems like you have to almost remortgage your home in order to afford concert tickets, to be able to see a band of Metric’s calibre for free is a rare bit of good fortune, indeed. So, if you live near me, then go! I am sure that the Metric concert will be a highlight of your summer. As for Emily Haines, I would hazard a guess that a highlight of her summer will also be playing in Peterborough because, no doubt, that will involve making time for a bit of a family reunion. No matter who we are or how successful we become, it is always good to be able to go home and bask in the nostalgic glow of simply being your fodder’s daughter or your mudder’s son. Enjoy the trip home, Emily. Thanks again for the upcoming concert. I am sure it will be an awesome time for all concerned.\n\nThe link to the official website for Metric can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Broken Social Scene can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Peterborough, Ontario’s summer concert series called Peterborough Musicfest can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for the Etobicoke School for the Arts can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Fenelon Falls, Ontario, can be found here.\n\nFinally, the link to the video for the song “Help I’m Alive” by Metric can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

It was then that I moved from my bucolic island home on Cape Breton in Nova Scotia and found myself living in the downtown heart of Canada’s biggest city, Toronto. While my purpose for moving to Toronto was to attend university, the professors I had and the courses I studied had little to do with my real education. I grew up into adulthood because of four factors that all had to do with music. Let me get right into that because it dovetails nicely with the subject of today’s post.\n\nMy real life education began the very first morning I woke up in my dorm room. Not knowing what to do after waking up alone in this strange room in an apartment filled with people I had yet to come to know, I reached out for something familiar. I turned on the clock radio beside my bed. As a child, I grew up in a home that always had the radio going, especially in the morning as we all ate breakfast. It was on that radio that I grew up listening to the likes of Anne Murray, Hank Snow and Charley Pride. On that first day in Toronto, I reached for the radio not knowing any of the station frequencies. So when I turned it on, I got only static. I turned the tuning dial until something came on. And there I was, sleep still in my eyes at 8:30 in the morning with “Back in Black” by AC/DC blasting out from my little radio!!! I couldn’t believe my ears. The station I had stumbled upon was actually a Buffalo, New York, station, WBEN. But that didn’t matter at that moment. I had only ever heard AC/DC played at parties round midnight. But here I was listening to that boozy, party music to start my day. I hadn’t even had breakfast yet, but I knew that I wasn’t on Cape Breton Island anymore.\n\nThe second thing that told me that life was different now was that I suddenly became socially popular. There were lots of mixers at the beginning of the school year as all of the new students sought to get to know one another. Back in high school I was never invited to parties. I was always well-liked but not in “that” way. Thus, I spent the majority of my Friday nights at home with my parents watching the Friday Night Mystery Movie on TV. But in Toronto, I was invited to everything that was happening! And best of all, girls seemed to like me. I had all of the slow dances I could ask for. Girls wanted to talk with me and sit near me. To my nerdy self, it was surprising and amazing all at the same time. After all, I was still the same skinny guy who couldn’t get a date to save his soul on Cape Breton Island. But, once again, my social acceptance signaled in a loud and impossible to miss manner that I may still have been the same person but that the world around me had shifted in a seismic way. The music pulsated, the lights dimmed, the alcohol flowed and I wasn’t alone as much on Friday nights anymore.\n\nThe third thing that helped me to realize that my personal world was now part of something much bigger and more varied was something as simple as a haircut. Before moving to Toronto, I had always had short hair. I had always gotten that short haircut at a local barbershop. There was never anything fancy about the barber shop I went to. In the middle of the small shop there was a leather chair that swiveled from left to right and also went up and down. My barber’s name was Jerry. The combs used to straighten my hair were always kept in a jar of bluish liquid. We talked about sports and the weather and maybe the news of the day while Jerry trimmed and snipped away. I can’t remember what I paid, but it couldn’t have been much more than five bucks. There were no appointments to make for next time. Whenever my hair grew past my ears, it would be time to go back to see Jerry and get a trim. There was nothing complicated about it. I just showed up and he always gave me the haircut I needed. Well, four or five weeks after moving into my dorm, my hair grew past my ears. The only problem was that I had no idea where to find “my Jerry” amid the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto. One day, while wandering around to see what there was to see in the downtown core, I stumbled across a place called The House of Lords that offered hair styling. I had no idea what The House of Lords was. All that I knew was that my hair had grown past my ears and that I needed a trim quickly! So this jean-jacketed, skinny, nerdy 18 year old from Cape Breton walked inside in search of a haircut. As soon as I opened the door I instantly became like Alice in Wonderland. I had never seen anything like the inside of The House of Lords before! It was dark like a dungeon. Music was playing at ear-splitting volume. I later learned that The House of Lords was where rock stars and trendy types came to get their hair styled. You must remember that the early 1980s was the time of punk music, so there were stylists there with spiked mohawk-style hair and others with half of their head buzzed clean and the other half hanging over their eyes like a sheep dog. The early 80s was also the beginning of the hair metal craze. Think of what guys like John Bon Jovi looked like as he was just becoming famous. Well, the other half of the stylists in the House of Lords looked like that. And in walked little old me seeking a trim. I have to be honest, I was scared to be there, but once there, I was too scared to leave. I felt the disdainful gaze of each stylist as I meekly asked for my haircut. I am sure that the one who ended up with me was the one who drew the shortest straw. In any case, we did not talk about sports or the weather or even the news of the day. All I remember is my stylist constantly asking me if I wanted him to do anything “interesting” with my hair and then sighing audibly when I said no, just a trim above my ears please. I remember being charged $25 for the cut when it was done and having barely that amount on me. I am not sure what would have happened to me if I hadn’t had enough money to pay. Maybe I would have been taken into one of the back rooms….and who knows what went on in those secret rooms at the back of the shop!!!??? But what that experience did for me was to introduce me to a whole new world that I had only read about in magazines or seen in movies. For those twenty minutes (which seemed to me like twenty hours) I was surrounded by punks and goths and rockers and, ya know what, I survived. Even though I was definitely not of that world, I was glad for the experience. It helped prepare me for what was to come next. And what was to come next was Carole Pope and Rough Trade!\n\nI distinctly remember the feeling I had upon leaving The House of Lords that day and re-emerging into the sunlight on Yonge Street. I felt different, even though I was still just a Caper in a buttoned up jean jacket. I returned to my dorm room and mulled over what I had seen and heard while my hair was being cut. The sensory experience of it all helped me to better appreciate Rough Trade when I started seeing news stories about the band on CityTV’s The New Music magazine show. In 1982, Carole Pope and musical partner Kevan Staples released an album called Avoid Freud. That album was to become an album of music unlike anything that had been released in Canada up until that date. It contained a song called “High School Confidential”. In order for local radio stations to play that song, a censored version had to be created by Pope and Staples. The bleeping out of certain words and phrases from within the song caused a surge in interest from the record buying public. Avoid Freud flew off of the record shop shelves as patrons sought to hear the true lyrics for themselves. Those lyrics were of an unabashedly sexual nature. The song tells a tale of sexual awakening for a young high school girl for another girl from her school. The object of her desire is a voluptuous vixen who is compared favourably to famous Hollywood sex symbols such as Mamie Van Doren, Anita Ekberg and Dagmar. Sexual consumption and desire drips from every line in “High School Confidential”. It was the first popular hit song that acknowledged lesbians in such a proud, confident, forceful manner. The singer of this song, Carole Pope, was a lesbian herself. Being “out” in 1982 was not the same as being out in today’s world. Back then, many public figures who lived their true lives in non-heterosexual relationships had to hide that fact in order to maintain their professional standing regardless of their career. And yet, here was Carole Pope, often leather clad, holding bondage equipment such as riding crops and whips, singing so proudly about desiring the body of another female. “High School Confidential” was a groundbreaking song in many regards. It helped to shine a very public light on a way of living and of loving that was different, and it did so in a way that made it almost seem sexy and cool. As has repeatedly been shown to be the case, representation matters. In Canada, there were many young people who were questioning their own sexual orientation. It can’t be easy growing up and knowing that your thoughts and feelings don’t seem to mesh with societal expectations. For young folks like K.D. Lang, and later for twin sisters Tegan and Sara, listening to the songs on Avoid Freud made them feel less alone in their world. Knowing that someone who appeared to be as strong and self-confident as Carole Pope could stand up in front of the world and lay her sexual cards on the table helped give them the courage to do likewise as they grew up into adulthood. In many ways, Avoid Freud is just as impactful an album as Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill would turn out to be years later. Strong women can move mountains, as both surely did.\n\nAs for me, a song such as “High School Confidential” was more titillating than anything else. It was certainly a song that placed sexual desire front and centre in a way that the music I listened to on Cape Breton Island never would have thought to do. It also advocated on behalf of a community of people who were never viewed as being socially acceptable when I was growing up. I always tell the story of my own experience of bringing an umbrella home with me for the summer while home from university. One day It was raining. My best buddy from highschool and I were heading to town. I took my umbrella, which I had learned to use in Toronto. When I opened it up my friend stopped in his tracks and refused to walk any further with me. He declared the umbrella to be “fruity” and “gay”. I was neither of those things and had simply learned that staying dry was preferable to getting soaked. But none of that mattered. I lost a friend that day. We stayed in touch for years afterward, but things were never the same after seeing how quickly he turned on me, just for using an umbrella, just for appearing to be gay. My experience is nothing compared to the very real danger that many non-heterosexual people found themselves in back then (and, unfortunately, still do today). A simple story of this involves singer Carole Pope.\n\nUnbeknownst to me when I was listening to “High School Confidential” for the first time was that Carole Pope and Kevan Staples were actually veterans of the Toronto music scene. They first started performing together in the same Yorkville folk scene in the late 1960s that Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell frequented. Rough Trade was actually the third band that the two friends had formed . Not only were they well known in the city as performers, but they both were well known as advocates for alternative sexual lifestyles and regularly performed at events associated with them at a time when those sorts of clubs were kept in secret locations, under lock and key and available to only those promising the utmost in discretion. In every major city where underground alternative scenes exist, there are people who history ends up declaring as being foundational members of such movements. Carole Pope and Kevan Staples were both such foundational members of Toronto’s LGBTQ+ community. However, the entire time that Carole Pope was singing under the banner of Rough Trade, she was keeping one thing under wraps. That secret was that she had a lover. That lover was someone who, unlike Pope, was desperate to maintain her anonymity so as not to be exposed as a lesbian and jeopardize her own singing career. That lover was singer Dusty Springfield. You may know Springfield from songs such as “Son of a Preacher Man”, “I Only Want To Be With You” and “Windmills of My Mind”. Dusty Springfield lived the type of life that many of her generation did. She kept her true self from ever becoming known. But when she started appearing on concert bills with Rough Trade as being an opening act or else as appearing as a special guest, many folks found the pairing to be odd. Little did they know how deep the ties really ran.\n\nI don’t live on Cape Breton Island anymore. I have lived almost three-quarters of my life (and all of my adult life) away from there. I believe the experience of leaving has helped me to grow as a person. This is certainly true in how I regard those who choose to love differently than I do. I am a heterosexual male. If I was anything different I would let you know. I don’t view loving differently as being sinful, dirty or an abomination in any way, shape or form. As long as a relationship is built on a foundation of love and trust and consensuality then who cares? Good for everyone who finds true love in whatever form that happens to be. I say all of this because I possess enormous privilege. I can wave my flag of nerdiness and kindness and maleness and heterosexual-ness without fear of who may take offense. There is a terrific freedom in being able to do so. If I was being honest I would go so far as to say that I even take that privilege for granted. But as we all know, not everyone is as fortunate in their privilege as I am. This is one of the reasons why there is the need for Pride flags and crosswalks and a month dedicated to the subject of those who choose to live what is deemed to be an alternative lifestyle. For every brave soul such as Carole Pope who proudly proclaims her orientation and sings songs that take ownership of that conversation, there are many more Dusty Springfields out there living lives of fear and confusion and never feeling as though they can be who they truly want to be in this life. That is so sad. In a world filled with cruelty and injustice, why is compartmentalizing how we love even an issue? There is no right way to love someone. You just open your heart. Who opens their heart in reply and connects with yours shouldn’t matter. Ever. I love my wife and she loves me. I am sure that Carole Pope loved Dusty Springfield and that she loved Carole Pope as well. It is the same love. It should be the same life experience. But sadly it is not. Until it is, songs like “High School Confidential” will continue to be important lifelines for the lonely and the confused. People like Carole Pope will continue to matter to more than just her friends, family and partners. And occasions such as Pride month will continue to be necessary. Happy Pride Month to all who celebrate…including those back home on Cape Breton Island.\n\nThe link to the official website for Carole Pope and Rough Trade can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Fierte Canada Pride can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the uncensored version of the song “High School Confidential” by Rough Trade can be found here. ***There appear to not be any lyric videos for this song.

In this segment from the show, Rough Trade appear as special guests on a show for pre-teens. They play the censored version of “High School Confidential” at the end of this segment. In my opinion, SCTV was waaaaay ahead of its time in tackling some of the social issues of the day. This skit is perfectly cringeworthy in how it captures the awkwardness of being a pre-teen and the questioning nature of how kids see the world. In an unspoken way, it clearly establishes why bands such as Rough Trade and people such as Carole Pope were important role models back in the day.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

On the other hand, allow me to introduce you to my wife who enjoys wandering around our home belting out snippets of whatever Pop/Rock songs happen to enter her head. We are both as nerdy as they come so it always makes me smile to hear her burst into a soaring rendition of Thin Lizzy’s “Smokin’ in the Boy’s Room” or “It’s Raining Men” by The Weather Girls. Nine times out of ten, if my wife is to belt out a tune, it will probably be a Pop song from her youth from the late 1980s and 90s. For this reason, the song “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)” by Canadian band Glass Tiger is a song that frequently appears on her mental playlist. It is not for nothing that a song such as this became a hit and attracted the attention of Pop-loving folks like my wife. While Glass Tiger have won many awards for their rendition of this song, the reality is that “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)” is a song that the band had little to do with (other than performing it, of course). This song was cooked up by someone who is a master chef when it comes to creating perfect Pop-Rock gems. That certain someone was a man named Jim Vallance. In today’s story, Jim Vallance is every bit as important a player as is Glass Tiger lead singer Alan Frew and the rest of the band. So let’s discover the story behind the song that my wife so blissfully sings so often in our home! Here is the story of “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)” by Glass Tiger as written and produced by Jim Vallance. Enjoy.\n\nAs the 1970s came to an end, the music scene in Canada was poised to explode into international prominence. One of the first singers to really break big on the world’s stage was a singer you may have heard of called Bryan Adams. Adams burst onto the Canadian and world music scene with hit after hit such as “Cuts Like a Knife”, “Run To You”, “Summer of 69” and many more. With his raspy voice and boy-next-door good looks, Adams soared to the top of the charts and was often the token Canadian representative at global events such as Live-Aid. While Bryan Adams became a big music star, those in the music business back in Canada all knew that his success was not completely the result of his own efforts. As it turned out, Adams had a musical partner who went by the name of Jim Vallance. Vallance was the person who wrote just about all of the songs that became hits for Adams such as “Cuts Like a Knife”, “Run To You” and “Summer of 69”. Without the songcrafting efforts of Jim Vallance, it is up for debate as to how successful a career Bryan Adams would ever have had on his own. So, what does this have to do with a band from Newmarket, Ontario called Glass Tiger? Well, let me answer that question by first telling you a little bit more about Jim Vallance because his association with Bryan Adams, while his most famous collaborative effort, is not the only accomplishment on his musical resume. This man’s talent is vast and runs deep. Here is his story.\n\nJim Vallance met Bryan Adams when both were living in British Columbia. At the time that they met, Adams was just another young aspiring singer scuffling along, going from gig to gig, barely eking out a living. Jim Vallance got his big break in the Canadian music business as the drummer and songwriter for a fairly successful rock band called Prism. As a member of Prism, Vallance wrote hit songs such as “Spaceship Superstar” that helped put the band on the musical map of Canada. The experience that Vallance had helping to launch Prism included writing most of the songs on their debut album. In doing so, Vallance got to experience both sides of the creative process. He was involved in the crafting and recording of their songs and he also got to go on tour with the band and play drums in front of thousands of fans each night. It was by seeing the musical business from both perspectives that Vallance began to realize that he preferred being more of a behind-the-scenes player in the industry. Consequently, after Prism’s first tour, Vallance withdrew from the live band. While he continued to feed them new songs on subsequent albums, Jim Vallance made the very important career decision to throw himself completely into the songwriting side of music. It was at this time that he met a young Bryan Adams. The two of them hit it off immediately and the rest, as they say, is Canadian music history. Mostly because of his association with Adams, Jim Vallance is a four-time Juno award winner for Songwriter of the Year. However, while Jim Vallance gained fame as Bryan Adams songwriting muse, he never was satisfied to simply remain in the shadow of his friend. Consequently, during the 80s and 90s, Jim Vallance worked as a songwriter for hire for many of the top artists and bands of the day such as Tina Turner, Aerosmith, Rod Stewart, Bonnie Raitt and even our own Anne Murray. In addition to that, Vallance continued to branch out by offering his services as a record producer which he did for Canadian bands such as Doug and the Slugs and Cano. But a funny thing happened on the way to Jim Vallance establishing a career of his own. While his work with Bryan Adams was always what he was most known for, it was also something that ultimately was holding him back. Whenever an artist or band attains a significant level of commercial success, record executives develop an insatiable appetite for more and more. Thus, the pressure on both Bryan Adams and on Jim Vallance to keep churning out the hits as the 1980s rolled into the 90s was immense. However, with Jim Vallance branching out and working with other artists as songwriter and producer, he didn’t have the time to focus exclusively on Bryan Adams, as he had during their early days together. At one point, as Adams was feeling the heat from fans and from his record label, he demanded that his friend drop all other clients and work exclusively with him. Initially Vallance tried to appease his friend but their relationship had lost its easy rapport and the two had a falling out that lasted for well over a decade. In the meantime, Jim Vallance let it be known that he was for hire again to write songs and produce new albums for others. One of the first bands to contact him was a new band out of Newmarket, Ontario called Glass Tiger.\n\nGlass Tiger formed in 1983 out of the ashes of two other local bands named Onyx and The End. Initially, this new band was called Tokyo but eventually ended up going with the name Glass Tiger. It was as much luck as anything else that brought their career trajectory as a new band in line with that of Jim Vallance, who was looking to write for and to produce new acts. One of the things that Glass Tiger brought into the studio with them was a willingness to be directed by Vallance. At the time, it was Vallance who had the street credibility so Alan Frew and the band were happy to learn from him. One of the first things that he did with the band was to survey them as to their current musical listening habits. At the time, one of the big hits on radio was “Everyone Wants To Rule The World” by Tears for Fears. Frew told Vallance that the guys all liked the construction of that song. Jim Vallance took it from there and helped the band to begin writing their own new songs. The very first song they wrote together was based upon the structure of that Tears For Fears hit. It was a song called “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)”, which also featured backing vocals from Jim’s pal, Bryan Adams. Together with Vallance, Glass Tiger released their debut album called The Thin Red Line. That album also spawned the Top Ten hit “Someday”. The album sold almost a half million copies in Canada and even more in the U.S., where the band was nominated for a Grammy as Best New Duo or Group. With the master craftsman Jim Vallance in their corner, Glass Tiger quickly became one of Canada’s most successful bands. Not only have they had a stellar career in terms of Top Ten hits and record sales but the band itself has proven to be very resilient. The original line up of singer Alan Frew, lead guitarist Al Connelly, keyboardist Sam Reid, bassist Wayne Parker and drummer Michael Hanson has stayed together all throughout their career (except for Hanson, who left after their second album). In the time since The Thin Red Line album exploded onto the Canadian and world music scene, Glass Tiger have headlined many tours within Canada and continue to do so today. They have also toured as opening act for A-list artists and bands such as Tina Turner and Roxette. All in all, Glass Tiger has carved out a very nice career for themselves thanks, in part to their own skill and personalities as performers but also, because of the musical craftsmanship of songwriter and record producer extraordinaire Jim Vallance.\n\nIt is funny how different people can be. There are many for whom dreams of being on red carpets under the brightest of marquee lights is their fondest desire. For others, it is the love of creativity and the process of making something from nothing that turns their crank. Being an introverted person myself, I can understand why someone as talented as Jim Vallance would prefer to work away in relative anonymity. Not everyone is suited to handle the public demands that come with a career in the spotlight. For some like me and, perhaps, like Jim Vallance as well, being able to freely create without having to deal with the distractions of interviews and photo shoots and guest appearances and touring can come as a relief and allow us to focus on the tasks at hand. In my case, that means having the luxury of time and the clear headspace needed to produce five blog posts per week. For someone like Jim Vallance, it means being able to write so many hit songs for so many artists that it almost boggles the mind. For example, in addition to his work with Bryan Adams and Glass Tiger, here are some songs that were, in fact, written by Jim Vallance: “What About Love?” by Heart, “Rag Doll” by Aerosmith, “Dangerous” by Loverboy, “Somebody Like You” by 38 Special, “Edge of a Dream” by Joe Cocker, “Now and Forever” by Anne Murray and many, many more. When introverts and extroverts can manage to find each other, amazing things happen. In the world of music, it gave us the wonderful Adams/Vallance partnership for so many years and the Vallance/Glass Tiger partnership as well. For me, it gave me a wonderful marriage. In it, I am the introvert and my wife is the social butterfly. She flutters around our home filling it with song. I am the partner who sits in his chair, smiling away at the sound of it all and writing about it in a post such as this. In marriage, as in music, when the puzzle pieces fit, what results is beauty and Art. As for my fellow introverts, I see you, I understand you and I appreciate you. I would suggest that we get together for a beer or a coffee but, let’s be honest, that would just be awkward for us all. Instead, you keep being you and I will keep being me. Let the impersonal nature of social media unite us in ways that we could never do in person. Thanks to all who sing so that the rest of us may hear. It makes the world a wonderful place for all.\n\nThe link to the official website for Glass Tiger can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)” by Glass Tiger can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\nThe link to the official website for songwriter/producer Jim Vallance can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Bryan Adams can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

One of the things that I remember most about that documentary was how the ants within army ant colonies were able to collectively problem-solve and sacrifice for the greater good when the situation called for it. In particular, I recall watching in amazement as the ants would make living bridges out of their bodies in order to span gaps too large for them to simply march across on their own. This collectivism has always caused me to give army ants a wide berth but also a lot of respect for the power of their collective commitment when it comes to achieving their goals. It is one of the reasons that I always played an active role in trade unions as a teacher all throughout my career. There is, indeed, strength in numbers that allows for progress that would be difficult to achieve on one’s own. This brings us to the subject of today’s post, Canadian rock icons from the 1970s, Max Webster. Now what in the world could a theatrical, prog-wannabe rock band who became Rush’s personal opening act for many of their tours have to do with army ants and trade unionism? Well, stick around because you are about to find out. Here is the story of Canada’s fun time band, Max Webster.\n\nThe first thing to know about the band Max Webster is that there was never, ever anyone named Max Webster in real life who was associated with the band in any way. Max Webster formed in Toronto in 1972. While the members of the band’s lineup came and went, the guys who were there for the band’s most successful period were singer Kim Mitchell, lyricist Pye Dubois, keyboardist Terry Watkinson, guitarist Mike Tilka and drummer Gary McCracken. The band name originated from a time when Mike Tilka played in another band called Family at Mac’s out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That band had a minor hit with a song called “Song For Webster”. Thus, “Mac’s” and “Song for Webster” morphed into Max Webster and a Canadian rock band was born. A simple indication of the humour that this band possessed can be found in the name of the man who wrote many of their hit songs, Pye Dubois. Pye Dubois was born as Paul Woods. However, being Canadian often means having a passing fluency in French, as well as in English. Well, in the french language, “woods” is translated as “les bois”. Thus, Paul Woods became Pye Dubois and a legendary Canadian poet and lyricist was created. While on the subject of Pye Dubois, this man has led a very interesting life. He has been a poet and a songwriter his whole adult life. He wrote most of the songs that comprise the entire Max Webster song catalogue. But Dubois, along with Max Webster, also had a close association with the rock band Rush. Dubois has a co-writing credit for Rush’s big hit “Tom Sawyer”. His poetry helped to inspire the concept album Counterparts and he also has co-writing credits for a variety of other Rush songs such as “Test For Echo”. But Dubois is mostly known for his work with Max Webster and then, following the demise of that band, with his work writing all of the hits for Kim Mitchell’s solo career.\n\nThe story of Max Webster is that they formed in 1972. That date is important because the early 1970s was a time of change in the music world. By then, rock n’ roll was no longer a fad. It had established itself as a genre and now was starting to evolve into new forms of expression. One of those new rock n’ roll spinoffs began in the mid-1960s as something known as progressive rock or simply as prog rock. Some of the most well known bands in the world such as Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, along with Canada’s own, Rush, were the leaders when it came to popularizing the musical style known as prog rock. In prog rock, many of the songs were long format songs that featured lyrics/storylines that borrowed from the imagery of myths and legends, as well as the worlds of fantasy and science fiction. The albums released by these bands were often concept albums that played like rock operas, featuring lengthy guitar and drum solos. The use of mind-altering substances was not required in order to enjoy listening to the music of these bands but it was said to have enhanced the experience. In any case, theatricality was an important part of the prog rock scene and that is where Max Webster got its start. There was always an element of pageantry associated with Max Webster when they performed live on stage in front of an audience. This was especially so for lead singer Kim Mitchell. Kim Mitchell is a tall man who happened to be very thin in his younger days. He had taken to wearing one-piece body suits while on stage which accentuated his thinness, giving him a rubber-limbed look. While Mitchell pranced about the stage, the band played songs which started out being in the prog rock vein. As they established themselves on the local bar and club circuit, they began to develop a reputation for themselves as an entertaining live band. As word-of-mouth reviews began to circulate, Ray Danniels who was the manager for Rush, happened to catch one of the Max Webster shows and found their combination of prog rock and classic rock sensibilities appealing. He signed the band to the same record label as Rush and placed them as opening act on the Hemispheres tour. Danniels also brought Max Webster into the same studio as Rush and had them record all of their albums with the same producer that Rush used, Ray Brown. So while Rush was always the biggest band on the Anthem record label, Max Webster quickly carved out a niche at being Rush’s “little brother”, as it were. The relationship between the bands was one of mutual admiration and support. In this sense, it is easy to see how someone such as Pye Dubois, who was always in the studio whenever Max Webster recorded one of his songs, could have had access to the members of Rush and could have had time to present song ideas and poems to them for consideration.\n\nI was in high school as the 1970s played out. Needless to say, Max Webster tunes formed part of the soundtrack to my time as a teenager. Songs such as “Diamonds, Diamonds”, “Let Go the Line”, “A Million Vacations” and “Paradise Skies” were all songs that received plenty of radio airplay back home on Cape Breton Island and across Canada. That having been said, the band never managed to have a Top Ten hit nor did they have any success of note in the U.S. or in Europe. But, as little brother to Rush, Max Webster got to tour the world and to release four albums that all hold a special place in the hearts of Canadian rock fans from the seventies. It was while touring in Europe in support of Rush and of their own fourth album that lead singer Kim Mitchell pulled the plug on the band by announcing that he was leaving to start a solo career. Mitchell could see that Max Webster had gone about as far as it was going to go and that if he had any hope at all of achieving a different sort of success for himself that he needed to shed his skin, so to speak and head out on his own. Thus, the Canadian music scene suddenly had a man named Kim Mitchell on the charts with songs such as “Go for a Soda”, “Patio Lanterns”, “Rockland Wonderland”, “All We Are”, “Alana Loves Me”, “I am a Wild Party” and “Expedition Sailor”, of which “Patio Lanterns” and “Go for a Soda” both reached No.1 on the charts. Kim Mitchell timed his departure from Max Webster well because the launch of his solo career dovetailed nicely with the birth of music video stations such as Much Music in Canada. Suddenly, Mitchell’s quirky appearance and stage antics endeared him to a national audience instead of being restricted to those live audiences who came out to see smaller Max Webster shows in person. As Kim Mitchell reached middle age, he had one final career transition ahead of him. From 2004-2014, Kim Mitchell served as the afternoon drive time radio DJ at Toronto radio station Q107. During his stint as Q107’s most visible radio personality, Mitchell continued appearing at concerts in the Toronto area, opening for acts such as Van Halen, Def Leppard and Aerosmith. Ever the complementary musical act, Kim Mitchell has made a career out of being entertaining but non-competitive. He is a supportive soul who has been willing to help others have their moment in the spotlight. In return, he has earned the love and respect of his peers in the business and has developed the reputation as someone others can depend upon for a good time without a lot of the drama that often comes with being in the music business.\n\nSo what does any of this have to do with army ants and trade unions? Well, whenever I think of bands from the 1970s such as Max Webster, I look back in gratitude for how they went about their business and for the role they played during a time period in which there was not the support available for Canadian musical acts as there was to be once the 1980s appeared. Back in the 1970s, there were headliners such as Trooper or April Wine but for ever band like that, there were those on the next rung down such as Max Webster, Sweeney Todd, Streetheart, Patsy Gallant, Prism, Harlequin, The Headpins and many more who slogged away in the trenches, performing everywhere for anyone, selling a modicum of hits (usually just enough to fund the next tour or album) but never really becoming stars on the worldwide stage. But regardless of the level of success that acts such as those achieved, they performed a value service by helping Canada to develop its own music scene. The Max Websters of this country were among the first wave of bands who stayed home for the bulk of their careers. Unlike Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and the Guess Who, success in America was never an issue for Max Webster/Kim Mitchell. For all those artists and bands who traveled across the country along the TransCanada corridor, they helped to build the foundation of what was to come in the 1980s. It was in the 1970s that Canadian Content laws first came into being but it was the 1980s that its impact really began to be felt. National radio shows such as CBC’s “Brave New Waves” gave new artists and bands national exposure right out of the gate and Much Music started broadcasting the faces of Canadian artists into every home in Canada with a cable TV package. So when I look at the legacy of bands such as Max Webster, I view them as being like the army ants who formed the living bridge or the trade union members who united to form a mighty union so that the likes of Bryan Adams and Corey Hart and Celine Dion and Shania Twain all had an easier time of it when they launched their careers. Even if we whittle it all down to simply focussing on the career of Max Webster and the subsequent career of Kim Mitchell. Would there have been a song such as “Patio Lanterns” if not for a song such as “Paradise Skies”? I think not. One was a bridge to the other. Bridges are important in music, as in life, as you can all appreciate. Thanks Pye. Thanks Rush. Thanks Kim Mitchell. Thanks to all of the 1970s artists and bands for doing what you did so that we all have what we have today. Your efforts are appreciated.\n\nThe link to the official website for Max Webster can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Kim Mitchell can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Toronto radio station Q107 can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Paradise Skies” by Max Webster can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here (In the video’s description section). NOTE: This is an interesting “live” music video. This appearance was on a UK show called Top of the Pops. Max Webster was an unknown band in the UK at the time of this appearance. When the band is introduced, you can hear the announcer introduce Max Webster and say how happy they are to have “him” there. There was no Max Webster, as you all know now. In addition, Top of the Pops would only play UK tunes on their show. In order for Max Webster to appear, they had to quickly record a UK version of “Parade Skies” at Abbey Road Studios. That UK version is what they are lipynching to in this video.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Patio Lanterns” by Kim Mitchell can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

Well, without going into a long essay on the subject, one aspect of our culture that springs to mind is a deep-rooted love for the sport of ice hockey. It is a cliche as Canadian as maple syrup to suggest that our love of ice hockey stems from our climate. But there is just something so Canadian about being outdoors in the winter time. To be honest, I am not much of a skater myself but in my younger days, I built my fair share of backyard snow forts and enlisted in armies of snowball warriors. I played road hockey until the street lights came on and our moms called us in for dinner. I have raced down hills of ice on toboggans, only to be sent flying through the air whenever we hit that inevitable bump at the bottom. Rosy cheeks and tingling fingertips are all part and parcel of what it means to be Canadian for me. If we weren’t on the ice or on the road playing hockey then we were in our homes watching Hockey Night in Canada on TV. It is not surprising that over a half century later I am still glued to my TV set (or, more truthfully, my mobile device) as I watched this year’s Stanley Cup playoffs unfold. It is also not surprising that in doing so I once again had my heart broken as my favourite team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, bowed out in disappointing fashion for the 57th season in a row!!! “Maybe next year” rings hollow but guess what I’ll be doing again when next year rolls around?\n\nAs much as hockey is part of my life, it occupies that space in my heart and mind as a spectator sport. For thousands of others, hockey is most definitely a participatory sport. It is for those people that I write today’s post. While there are still backyard rinks scattered here and there in our towns and some are lucky enough to live by ponds and lakes that freeze solid and allow for some shinny to erupt, for the most part, our participation in the sport of hockey has taken us indoors. As much as there are churches in most Canadian towns, there are also local arenas, too. If hockey is our national religion then the local arena is our church. For if there is one experience that binds us together as a country it is traveling to our local hockey rink for a practice or a game that often starts before the sun has risen. It is the smell of a locker room filled with eager players. It is the sound of skate blades carving up a freshly cleaned sheet of ice. It is the sound of pucks hitting the boards and the glass. It is a cold beer after the game for the grownups and pizza and pop for the younger ones. It is sitting in the stands as a parent holding a hot beverage while watching your child or partner practice or play. It is an adult getting the chance to relive his or her youth by lacing those skates tightly and getting the chance to fly down the ice like Bobby Orr or to score one for Canada like Paul Henderson. The local arena is also a place where dreams of making it into the National Hockey League or the Professional Women’s Hockey League (the N.H.L. or P.W.H.L) are born and nurtured and developed into a lottery-like reality for a few special players.\n\nThe odds of actually making it all the way from playing on a peewee team to cracking the lineup of a professional team is almost astronomical. Yet with the mindset of “if you have a ticket then you have a chance”, entire communities watch those young skaters closely in the fervent hope that one of them will show signs of talent beyond the norm. Should someone separate themselves from the pack and display an above-average level of skill as a child then the entire community adopts that child as their own. We all feel a sense of pride that someone from our town, our local team, may have what it takes to make it to “the Show”, as the big leagues are often called. Every pro hockey player comes from somewhere. Why not from our home town, too? We allow ourselves to become invested in the fortunes of children who, in most cases, are not our own. Yet their success feels like our success and so, we cheer them on as they rise through the ranks of the local hockey association hierarchy. By the time a child reaches their teenage years, we all have a pretty good sense of whether they have a realistic shot at the big leagues. For a select few, that confirmation will come in the form of being offered university scholarships or else, it will come in the form of being selected in the amateur draft by a professional hockey team. Very few teenagers are ever drafted, let alone end up cracking the lineup of a real NHL or PWHL team. But it does happen every once and a while and so, as we sit in our local arenas for those pre-dawn practices, we watch the assembled skaters and we allow ourselves to dream. For me, it is this dream that is part of what makes us Canadian.\n\nWhen local Canadian musicians travel across Canada while on tour, many stops along the way will be at local churches or at hockey rinks. Some towns or cities are big enough and lucky enough to have actual theatres and other such performance spaces dedicated to the Arts. But for the most part, the places where people gather in many towns across this land are in churches and hockey rinks. And so, when someone like singer Tom Cochrane goes out on tour, it is not uncommon for him to have his tour bus pull up outside the local arena for a concert. It was during one such stop in North Bay, Ontario that the inspiration for the song “Big League” arose. The story goes that Tom Cochrane had arrived in North Bay for a show and found himself chatting with one of the locals. This man was a custodian. In the course of their conversation, the man asked Cochrance if he was going to play a song during his show called “The Boy Inside the Man”. The man went on to say that this particular song had been one of his son’s favourite songs. Tom Cochrane replied that he would most definitely be singing “The Boy Inside the Man”. He then asked for the son’s name so he could give a shout-out while introducing the song. It was then that the man confessed that his son had been killed in a car accident. Needless to say, this news caught Cochrane off guard. The two men talked some more which allowed Cochrane to glean the fact that the boy who had lost his life had been a hockey player who had received a scholarship to play at a university and that he had been killed coming back from a practice. The death of this young man (whose identity Cochrane has never revealed) obviously devastated his family but it also caused the whole community to grieve as well. That conversation reverberated around in Tom Cochrane’s heart and mind for some time afterward. Knowing how tragic the death of any child is but also how intertwined are the dreams of hockey with our Canadian identity, Cochrane knew that he had to practice his own form of musical therapy so that he could carry on with his own life. So he locked himself away in a cabin in the woods (how stereotypically Canadian is that?) armed with nothing more than a pen, some paper, a tape recorder and a guitar and wrote a song that became “Big League”.\n\n“Big League” has gone on to be one of Tom Cochrane’s greatest hits. It was a Top Ten hit in Canada, as well as in the U.S. “Big League” has become the default song that is played any time a young hockey player is killed which, unfortunately, has happened at least half a dozen times alone in Canada since the song debuted in the late 1980s. The most recent example of this happened when the Humboldt (Saskatchewan) Broncos junior team’s bus was involved in a highway accident with a transport truck. That accident claimed the lives of sixteen people. Tom Cochrane released an updated charity version of “Big League” with all profits going directly into a fund that was established for the families of those who were killed, as well as for those who survived but required medical care. It isn’t everyday that the idea for an anthem comes to mind but it did for Tom Cochrane that day in North Bay. I am sure he must feel a certain sense of emotion each time he plays “Big League” live at a concert in any hockey arena in Canada. The emotions it generates are ones that so many of us can appreciate.\n\nI distinctly remember the outpouring of emotion that swept the country in the aftermath of the Humboldt tragedy. At homes all across the country, people symbolically left their porch lights on and placed a hockey stick in front of the door of their homes in memory of those who set out with dreams of playing in the big leagues but never returned home. In my classroom, we discussed what had happened because there were many of my students who played hockey themselves or else had siblings who did. The kids had great questions and, as kids often do, they understood more than most adults would give them credit for. We created our own paper hockey sticks, coloured them in and placed our own messages of condolence on them and then taped them to our classroom door. “Sticks out for Humboldt!” was the saying at the time. That’s what we did, along with so many other Canadians, too. I will close with a comment that was made by Toronto Maple Leaf player Mitch Marner the day after the Maple Leafs had been eliminated from the playoffs. When asked if he still saw himself as being part of the team next season after all of the disappointments he and his teammates had endured, Marner replied that he would obviously want to come back because of the passion of the fanbase. To paraphrase his quote, he said that in Toronto (and across Canada) they treat hockey players like Gods. There is a lot of ego in a statement like that but there is also a lot of truth. As Canadians, we hold hockey in high regard. The language of hockey is spoken everywhere in this land of ours. Those who rise through the ranks of our local ice hockey associations take us all along for the ride. It is as emotional an investment that we make as a country. In the end, hockey is just a sport. It actually, truly is just a game. But, in Canada, it is as close to a national religion as we have. And those young kids who make it to the big leagues are viewed as Gods and heroes for playing this game. It is not a question of it being right or wrong. It is just who we are as Canadians.\n\nThe link to the official website for Tom Cochrane can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the Humboldt Broncos charity song “Big League” by Tom Cochrane and Red Rider can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\nThe link to the official website for the city of North Bay, Ontario can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

I reserve my weekend time for my family. However, while I may not publish new content on the weekend, I still attend to blog matters on the weekend when time allows in order to reply to comments that may have arrived, to engage in site maintenance and/or to work on my writing schedule for the upcoming week. Not surprisingly, my days with highest audience engagement tend to happen during the week. On the weekend, traffic usually drops by half. I don’t tend to worry about that sort of thing. It is how the blogging game goes. If you publish new content, chances are greater that audiences will come. Take time off and audiences will drift away to other sites. Since my site isn’t monetized, I am not losing any money by not posting on the weekends. Instead, I am enriched by having extra time with the ones that I love most while they are home from work and school.\n\nEach post I publish usually generates between 80-100 page views and visitors, which may not be big numbers for some sites, but it is good for me. For the most part, the “numbers” as they relate to my small website are more a vanity thing than anything else. They don’t count for anything much in reality, but just the same, it is always cool when they crest over a nice round number such as 100. So, imagine my surprise when I checked my WordPress account this weekend, only to discover that I had received well over 100 page views and visitors on a day that I hadn’t even published! The last time something out of the ordinary happened to my site was the day that Myles Goodwin, the former lead singer of Canadian rock band April Wine, passed away. Someone in the official April Wine fan club was using Google to find stories about the band and came across a post that I had written about April Wine years earlier. That person thought that I had done a good job telling the band’s story and shared my post on the official April Wine Facebook page. From there, over 400 people read that post in one day! I received lots of nice comments and set a personal record for daily page views and visitors. The beauty of that was that I didn’t even have to do anything. My post was just out there waiting to be discovered and enjoyed. Because it was there, people who needed to find it did, and the event took on an energy all on its own. Well, the same sort of thing happened again this weekend, except it wasn’t a death that drew people to my work. Instead, it was, of all things, a PBS pledge drive.\n\nThe closest large American city that I live near is Buffalo, New York. My hometown rests on the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Places like Buffalo and Rochester, New York, sit across the lake on the southern shores. Even though I have never been to Rochester and have only ever driven past Buffalo, we still get lots of television and radio broadcasting from those two cities, giving them both an air of familiarity in our home. This past weekend, Buffalo’s Public Broadcasting Station (PBS) engaged in its most storied and mythical of events, their annual pledge drive. For those who may not know, public broadcasting stations like WNED receive a lot of their funding in the form of viewer donations and grants from Arts-minded organizations. The yearly fundraising drive is a time when these stations usually bring out their most popular programming which they play, stopping at regular intervals to open the phones for donations. These pledge breaks are often torturous because they usually break away from their A-list programme just as it was reaching some dramatic point in the production. There were times in the past when I almost made a pledge just to hurry the pledge break along so they would get back to the show I wanted to keep watching! Well, this weekend, WNED in Buffalo did a very smart thing: they aired a programme from Canada from 2016 that was called “A National Celebration”. This show was a three-hour-long, commercial-free telecast put on by the CBC that broadcast the final concert performed by the band The Tragically Hip in their hometown of Kingston, Ontario. On the surface, it may have seemed odd for an American PBS station to devote such valuable air time to a Canadian broadcast, but as it turned out, WNED was very clever to have done so indeed! The Tragically Hip may go down in history as one of, if not, the best and most beloved Canadian rock n’ roll band of all time. Gord Downie is certainly one of the most revered of our performers. But one of the things about The Tragically Hip was, as popular as they were in Canada, they were just as popular in US border towns and cities such as Detroit, Seattle and yes, even Buffalo! By airing that CBC special, WNED not only captured their regular US audience, but they also got a large Canadian crossover audience to watch Gord Downie and the boys sing together one final time. What this all has to do with me and my blog is that when I first began writing about music, just prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2019, it was the music of The Tragically Hip that got me started. I have written posts for about twenty or so of their songs prior to today. For the record, my best-performing post of all time is one that I wrote about their song “Long Time Running”, which has several thousand page views alone. You can go back and read my early work by simply clicking on the hashtag #TheTragicallyHip on the left hand side of this page. Apparently, reading my old posts about The Hip is what a lot of people ended up doing this past weekend due to the WNED pledge drive. In the same way that my old April Wine post was searchable when people needed that content, my old Hip posts were sitting there waiting to be clicked on as well. A quick look at my traffic stats on the weekend showed that ten of my old Tragically Hip posts were accessed on the weekend. Needless to say, this news sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole that saw me revisiting their songs and videos, especially their live performance"
