I'll skip the pre-solo Sweeney Todd work, and just start up with his solo career proper.\n\nKicking things off we have...\n\nBryan Adams - Bryan Adams\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Hidin' From Love (Adams, Vallance, Kagna) 3:17\n\n2. Win Some, Lose Some (Adams, Vallance, Kagna, Dean) 3:47\n\n3. Wait And See (Adams, Willis) 3:05\n\n4. Give Me Your Love (Adams) 2:54\n\n5. Wastin' Time (Adams) 3:34\n\n6. Don't Ya Say It (Adams, Vallance) 3:21\n\n7. Remember (Adams, Vallance) 3:41\n\n8. State Of Mind (Adams, Vallance) 3:15\n\n9. Try to See It My Way (Adams, Vallance) 4:03\n\nThe album was released in February 1980, and marked the beginning of what was to become a long songwriting partnership between Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance. With the exception of \"Remember\" and \"Wastin' Time\", most of the album was recorded from October 29 up until November 29, 1979 at Manta Studios in Toronto and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.\n\nThe first single was \"Hidin' from Love\" in 1980 (#43 on the Billboard dance charts) which was followed up by \"Give Me Your Love\" and \"Remember\". Although the album never received any US notoriety on its debut, it was the door opener that led to getting radio play, tours, management, agents and the music business in general, interested in the 20 year old songwriter.\n\nSeveral songs on the album would also be covered by other artists, as leading up to his solo career, Adams (along with partner Vallance) was mostly making a living as a songwriter. \"Wastin' Time\" was originally written by Adams for Bachman-Turner Overdrive, and appeared on their 1979 album Rock n' Roll Nights. Former Fleetwood Mac singer/guitarist, Bob Welch, covered \"Remember\" for his 1981 self-titled solo album. In 1982, \"Hidin' From Love\" and \"Remember\" were covered by the British group Rosetta Stone. Their version of \"Hidin' From Love\" reached #46 on Canada's RPM 100 Singles chart. Lastly, \"Win Some, Lose Some\", was covered by Scandal (featuring Patty Smyth) for their debut EP released in 1982. It was released as the album's third single, but did not chart. Even though some of these songs didn't do well for the other artists, either, it's no surprise that they are still some of the best cuts off by Adams.\n\nAs debut albums go, especially from this time period, it's far from great, but not too bad. The worst thing about it, is it has no clear definition of a style or identity. Tracks bounce between New Wave, Pop, Rock and even Disco.\n\n\"Hidin' From Love\" - Kicks off the album in fine enough style. It's a catchy little track, even with slightly cheesy New Wave keyboards.\n\n\"Win Some, Lose Some\" - Is a nice mid-tempo rocker, and another stand out cut here.\n\n\"Wait And See\" - O.k. rocker, but not as strong as the first two songs.\n\n\"Give Me Your Love\" - Is a bit too schmaltzy of a ballad for my tastes. Not one his better slow songs.\n\n\"Wastin' Time\" - Good rocker with a crunchy guitar riff. One of my faves on the album.\n\n\"Don't Ya Say It\" - Don't care for this one much. Sounds like everything that was bad about 70's music. The disco back beat and R&B singers feel out of place, and don't suit Adams at all.\n\n\"Remember\" - Another album standout rocker. Easy to see why two other artist choose to cover it.\n\n\"State Of Mind\" - This one sounds like it could be Huey Lewis & The News song. I can hear it working much better for them than it does for Adams.\n\n\"Try to See It My Way \" - Another track that doesn't really do much for me. Another FM light style song that's pretty bland.\n\nYour opinions, thoughts, corrections or added info?\n\nA few more bits of songwriting trivia, then we'll be moving onto album #2. Granted this isn't all so much about Adams' own albums, but some of it is relevant, and for those who didn't know, it may be interesting.\n\nAnother band I forgot to mention who would later cover a song from the Bryan Adams album, was the North Carolina band Nantucket. They would release the song \"Hiding From Love\" as the single off their fourth album - No Direction Home.\n\nWhile working on his second album, Adams also penned one of his best tunes for fellow Canadian rockers, and songwriting partner Jim Vallance's former band Prism in the song \"Don't Let Him Know\". It would be the first single from the band's 1981 album Small Change, and the group's first US top 40 hit. Adams had previous co-written three tracks for their 1979 album Armageddon. The first of which, \"Jealousy\", he would later record himself (and to much better effect) for his second solo album, while the other two were \"You Walked Away Again\" (a fine rocker) and \"Take It or Leave It\". One thought regarding \"Don't Let Him Know\" - as much as I love Prism's take on the song, personally, I've always wondered and would love to have heard what Bryan would have done with it himself.\n\nAdams and Vallance would also be working and supplying songs around this time ('79-'81) for singer singer/songwriter Ian Llyod, best known as the lead singer of the band Stories (\"Brother Louie\"). The pair got hired via producer Bruce Fairbairn, who worked on both albums and was an old friend of Vallance's (the two had helped put Prism together). Adams later hit \"I'm Ready\" (from Cuts Like A Knife) would originally be heard done by Llyod on his 1979 album Goose Bumps. Llyod would record two other Adams/Vallance tracks on his next album, 3WC* (*Third Wave Civilization), in the numbers \"Lonely Nights\" (soon to be Adams' own breakout hit single) and \"Straight From The Heart\" (three years before both Adams and Bonnie Tyler would record versions of it). Bryan also played rhythm guitar on Llyod's take of \"Lonely Nights\", and Vallance supplied multiple instrumentation for the whole album. Llyod's readings of these songs are ok, but pale in comparison to Bryan's own versions - which is also why I made the comment about the Prism tunes.\n\nLastly, during 1981 the pair would co-write the song \"Jump\" for Loverboy's sophomore outing Get Lucky. (Which was also produced by Bruce Fairbairn). While never recorded by Adams himself, he would occasionally perform the song live at his concerts.\n\nOk, chew on that and I''ll be back with Adams' next album tomorrow.\n\nMoving on, next up we have...\n\nBryan Adams - You Want It, You Got It\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Lonely Nights (Adams, Vallance) 3:46\n\n2. One Good Reason (Adams, Vallance) 4:22\n\n3. Don't Look Now (Adams, Vallance) 3:06\n\n4. Coming Home (Adams, Vallance) 3:34\n\n5. Fits Ya Good (Adams, Vallance) 4:35\n\n6. Jealousy (Adams, Mitchell) 3:49\n\n7. Tonight (Adams, Vallance) 4:58\n\n8. You Want It, You Got It (Adams) 3:49\n\n9. Last Chance (Adams) 3:17\n\n10. No One Makes It Right (Adams) 3:17\n\nBryan Adams' second solo album, and was released July 21st, 1981. The album was originally to be titled Bryan Adams Hasn't Heard Of You Either (due to critics' indifference to his first album) but Adams' sense of humor didn't make it past the gate keepers at the record company, who opted for the safer title. It hit #118 on the Billboard Top 200 albums.\n\nThis was the album that established the sound that Adams has retained throughout his recording career. Much of that credit due to start of a long and successful partnership with producer Bob Clearmountain, who would continue working with Adams over his next three albums. Unlike the debut album where Adams and Vallance played most of the instruments themselves, You Want It, You Got It was recorded live in the studio. It was recorded and mixed in NYC over a two week period during the spring of 1981. Clearmountain would give Adams and the album the sonic 'umph!' and clarity of direction that was lacking in his debut. It also didn't hurt that Bryan assembled a crack band of musicians to back him, either. Some of which, drummer Mickey Curry and keyboardist Tommy Mandel, would continue to work with Adams throughout his career. Jaime Glasser handled most of the guitar solos, and the legendary G.E. Smith dropped by to lay down fills on one track \"Jealousy\", too. Bass was provided by Brian Stanley, and Adams played the rest of the guitars and piano.\n\nThe first single, \"Lonely Nights\", broke out of the Northeast of America long before it broke anywhere else, partially due to a couple of late night DJs working in Rochester, Albany and Syracuse. It eventually reached #3 on The Billboard Mainstream Rock charts, and #84 on the Hot 100 singles. Within a few months the album had been picked up across the country and Adams was soon on tour doing clubs and noon hour concerts for radio stations, as well as support to such acts as The Kinks and Foreigner. Two further singles \"Coming Home\" and \"Fits Ya Good\" were very well received, the latter becoming Adams' debut Top 40 hit in Canada, and making #15 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock in the U.S..\n\nIt was the shape of things to come, for as momentum increased, so did the touring. Although the album was only marginally successful, it laid down the groundwork for the forthcoming album Cuts Like A Knife.\n\n\"Lonely Nights\" - The first single (and song) most folks every really heard from Bryan Adams. Catchy, concise and everything a great pop rock song should be. I do recall, though, at the time of it's release there were some folks mistaking it for Rod Stewart, as both singers have a raspy voice. But Adams would soon enough establish his own identity.\n\n\"One Good Reason\" - Decent mid-tempo rocker. Nice nod to then recent election of Ronald Regan to the Presidential office in the lyrics, even if it does date the song.\n\n\"Don't Look Now\" - Good but average tune. The slight change up in the chorus is the only thing that really makes the song memorable, though.\n\n\"Coming Home\" - This was a single too, but doesn't personally do much for me. It would be a far better song, imho, without the backing vocals and synth parts.\n\n\"Fits Ya Good\" - To me, this is the album's standout track, and one of my favorite Bryan Adams songs. Period. Everything about this one is great - the powerhouse drums, chugging beat, cool guitar solo, and Bryan really sells the vocals. In my area, the North East U.S., this got as much airplay on the rock stations, if not more, than \"Lonely Nights\" did. by Tove Naess\n\n\"Jealousy\" - As stated in my last post, this tune was first recorded by the band Prism, and is co-written by that band's guitarist, Lindsay Mitchell. When Bryan re-did it himself for this album, he gave the song more of Bruce Springsteen sound, particularly with the keyboards. Of the two, I prefer the version here.\n\n\"Tonight\" - Another of the album's highlights, this is a great slow-burning, moody rocker. It would later be covered, to much lesser effect, by former Eagles member Randy Meisner on his 1982 self-tiled album. Bryan's version would also be his contribution to the 1986 Amnesty International compilation album Conspiracy Of Hope.\n\n\"You Want It, You Got It\" - Title track bounces along on a punky/new wave beat. Not necessarily awesome, but a nice diversion.\n\n\"Last Chance\" - Comes off as mostly a filler cut, but not horrible.\n\n\"No One Makes It Right\" - Solid ballad that will be the first of many great ones from the man. Miles better than \"Coming Home\", and this should have been the ballad chosen to be released off the album. Adams plays piano on this track, too. A good album closer.\n\nOverall, still not a perfect record, but a leagues better than his debut. While there's still filler to be found, the good tunes are really great and more than make up for it. On CD, I'd like to add that this one (A&M CD 3145), along with other releases that were part of A&M's Audio Masters Plus Series, sound pretty amazing."
