        "text": "BRYAN ADAMS\n\nSo Happy It Hurts Tour\n\nfeaturing Joan Jett & The Blackhearts\n\nAugust 4, 2023 by Jordan West\n\nAnyone that knows me understands that I will usually jump at the chance to see rock and roll legends when they are in my neighborhood, although I am known to travel to see them too. So when one of my favorite artists, singer/songwriter Bryan Adams, made a Southern California stop on his So Happy It Hurts Tour, I was ready.\n\nThe fact that he would be touring with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Joan Jett and the Blackhearts made the decision to go even sweeter. Adding to my excitement, it would be taking place in the brand new Acrisure Arena outside of Palm Springs; getting me fired up.\n\nWhen I arrived at Acrisure Arena, I was completely floored. The place is gorgeous. Opened seven months earlier, and located just off the 10 freeway in Palm Desert, this 10,000 seat marvel is home to the AHL Coachella Valley Firebirds, the farm team for the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken; it gets its name from Acrisure, a financial-tech company.\n\nAs I entered the facility, I was pleased to pass by a permanent ice rink that was connected to the arena. The cool temperature was a welcome relief from the blazing desert heat. The concourses offered an ample supply of food and drinks, and the lines were pretty short and efficient compared to many arenas. The place was spotless, and as I was led to my seat, I noticed that it still had that “new car smell.”\n\nSoon the lights dimmed and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts stormed the stage, opening with “Shooting Into Space” from her new, six- song EP “Mindsets.” Jett and the Blackhearts were – as always – dressed head to toe in all black. The stage was very simple and open, with black heart graphics adorning the bases of the small drum riser and guitar amplifiers. Busting right into a growly version of “Cherry Bomb,” the big hit from her days with the legendary Runaways, Jett let the music do the talking with a quick, 14-song set that covered various parts of her long career, as well as spotlighting four of the six songs from “Mindsets.”\n\nThe Blackhearts feature drummer Michael McDermott, bassist Hal B. Selzer, guitarist Dougie Needles, as well as her longtime manager/collaborator Kenny Laguna on keyboards, backing vocals and percussion – blasted out all the favorites, including the Gary Glitter classic, “Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)” and “I Hate Myself For Loving You,” as the still-arriving crowd pumped their fists and screamed the choruses.\n\nJett introduced the Runaways song “You Drive Me Wild” as “the very first song I ever wrote. In the bedroom, fighting with my sister,” which got a laugh from the adoring crowd. The audience stayed on their feet for the covers of classics such as Sly Stone’s “Everyday People” and Tommy James’ “Crimson and Clover,” and seemed to enjoy the up-tempo, power pop, sometimes punk rock of new songs, such as “(Make the Music Go) Boom,” which just screams classic Joan Jett style. Of course the huge hit “I Love Rock N’ Roll” had the entire crowd on its feet, screaming every word, to which Jett replied fondly at song’s end that it was “very cool” to hear the crowd sing back to her.\n\nAnother new one, “If You’re Blue,” made me think it would be a great TV theme song, much in the same way that “Bad Reputation” which was performed toward the end of the set, had been so perfect for the 1990’s television classic, “Freaks and Geeks.” Switching genres, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts ended their set with yet another new one, the quirky, country blues of “Whiskey Goes Good,” which was written by guitarist Dougie Needles, but could have easily been from the George Jones/Tammy Wynette songbook. All in all, it was a treat to see and hear a legend such as Joan Jett and her band rock an arena, as they have been doing for years.\n\nHeadliner Bryan Adams’ set was preceded by the appearance of an inflatable car, replicating the one on his latest album cover. Inscribed in black electrical tape graphics with “So Happy It Hurts” on one side and Bryan Adams on the other, it briefly hovered over the audience before the stage lights quickly darkened. A quick-cut video voiced by actor John Cleese proclaiming an “angel was sent from the heavens” to essentially save rock music. And, under a bath of red lights, Bryan Adams and his band appeared onstage and launched into “Kick Ass” from “So Happy It Hurts.”\n\nAdams and his band were also clad in all black clothing, and Adams was looking youthful in his hi-top sneakers and boyish haircut. He cranked up his hollow body, gold Gibson guitar and it was off to a two-hour show packed with his huge arsenal of well-crafted pop songs. Hit after hit filled the arena from then on with a great balance of rockers, as well as the tender ballads that spotlighted his powerful, scratchy but yet, comforting vocals.\n\nLong-time Bryan Adams lead guitarist, Keith Scott banged out crunchy guitar riffs during classic rock radio favorites “Take Me Back,” “Somebody,” and “One Night Love Affair,” as Adams made use of microphones that were positioned on stage left, stage right, and center to further engage the arena crowd. Amazingly, he sounded EXACTLY in the same key as he has for over 40 years and his adoring crowd loved every minute. “My name is Bryan, and I’m gonna sing you some songs,” he teased. “I’ve never been here before. I’m glad it isn’t an outdoor show,” he said, referring to the desert heat.\n\nAdams has become quite famous for his ballads, often more than other parts of his songwriting, and, quite naturally, he gave that part of the crowd what they wanted. “Please Forgive Me” had couples slow dancing in the aisles. “Shine a Light” was dedicated to his late father, and his huge ballad “Heaven” drew one of the loudest applauses of the evening. Led by the piano intro by keyboardist Gary Breit, the crowd swayed, and lit up their cell phones in unison.\n\nThe late Tina Turner was remembered by Adams, and he dedicated their 1984 duet “It’s Only Love” to her, as guitarist Scott helped as much as he could with replicating the harmony vocals. Turner’s vocals obviously were missed, but Scott made up for it with his solid guitar playing and even demonstrated a bit of showmanship with a “guitar-flip” at the song’s end.\n\nACRISURE ARENA | PALMS SPRINGS | July 28, 2023\n\nThe playful side of Adams’ personality shone onstage, especially when he egged the crowd to dance during the rockabilly tinged “You Belong to Me” paired with the similar “I’ve Been Looking for You.” These songs featured bassist Soloman Walker doing his best slappin’ technique on a stand-up bass. As a matter of fact, all three guitarists assembled together, center stage and rocked. More ballads followed, including “Here I Am” and the huge hit “(Everything I Do) I Do It For You” from the 1991 film, “Robin Hood Prince of Thieves,” were slickly done, but not over dramatic. And, in archery terms, Adams’ voice did not “quiver” even once all evening.\n\n“Back to You,” a favorite of mine, was performed. “18 Till I Die” was the perfect song for many of the seniors in the audience, especially on an evening when so many of the songs of their youth were represented, and culminated with the perfect rendition of “Summer of ‘69.” Adams’ consistent and well-crafted song catalogue is beyond outstanding. The crowd erupted, and Adams stood onstage and just beamed.\n\nAn interesting part of this tour is when Adams takes the time to ask his audience for requests. Tonight, he granted one fan the beautiful “Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman,” and his vocals were spot-on with the recorded version, while Keith Scott’s Spanish guitar was wonderfully reminiscent of Paco DeLucia’s original take. In entertainment speak, the song just KILLED!\n\nAnother member’s request was granted with the performance of “Victim of Love,” with Adams exclaiming “How obscure!” before nailing it. More and more hits followed, like “Cuts Like a Knife” and “Run to You.” During the title track of “So Happy It Hurts,” the hovering car re-appeared over the audience, this time with its headlights and taillights working. Adams explained that he had named it “Doris.”\n\nA fun cover of the Frankie Valli classic “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You” preceded Adams introducing his band – guitarist Scott, keyboardist Gary Breit, bassist Solomon Walker, and drummer Pat Steward. “That’s my boys,” he proudly yelped, before they left him alone onstage, with just an acoustic guitar and a braced harmonica ala vintage Bob Dylan. He spoke about his family, especially his 95-year-old mother, who had supported his dream to play music, and how he never gets tired of it. With that he strummed a lovely version of “Straight from the Heart” that again, brought out the sing-alongs and cell phones amongst the captivated audience.\n\nAfter yet another huge round of applause, Adams announced “Ya know, I have 16 albums, right?” He then closed out the evening with “All For Love” the song he wrote for “The Three Musketeers” and recorded along with Rod Stewart and Sting. After a hit-filled 26-song set, he bid farewell, thanked everyone for coming and left the stage. My mind was whirling as we filed out into the still blistering desert air. So much talent, so many hit songs, and incredible performances. I honestly felt so happy… it HURT!\n\nTO FOLLOW\n\nSID 230806 | TRACI TURNER, EDITOR\n\nPhotos by Jordan West Photography\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
