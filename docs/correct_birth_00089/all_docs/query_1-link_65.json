Among the hit songs in the special are “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,” “Summer of ‘69,” and “All for Love.”\n\nWith his distinctive vocals, Canadian born singer-songwriter Bryan Adams has been one of the most successful international performers in contemporary rock music, selling over 65 million records in a career that has spanned more than three decades. Adams rose to fame with his Cuts Like a Knife album and became a global star with his 1984 album Reckless. In 1991, his Waking Up the Neighbours album included the single “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,” which went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nAdams current album, Tracks of My Years, is his first studio release in six years, and features a wide range of musical styles reflective of a time when rock was played alongside pop, country and R&B. Great Performances captures Adams in peak performance during his current world tour, performing favorites from the new album as well as his own chart-topping hits. The performance – including “Here I Am,” “Summer of ‘69,” “Heaven,” and “Straight from the Heart” — was filmed at Toronto’s Elgin Theater in July 2014, and marks the singer’s PBS debut.\n\nBryan Adams in Concert will air on Great Performances in March on PBS. (Check local listings.) (In New York, THIRTEEN will air the program on Monday, March 2 at 9:30 p.m.)\n\nAbout Bryan Adams\n\nThe multi-faceted Bryan Adams — singer, songwriter, acclaimed photographer — has been one of the most successful figures in the world of rock music. The Grammy Award winning artist has toured six continents, garnered 21 top 10 hits, earned nominations for three Academy Awards and five Golden Globes, received 18 Juno Awards, an American Music Award and five ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards.\n\nAdams has been awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia for contributions to popular music and philanthropic work via his own foundation. He has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as well as Canada’s Walk of Fame and in 2011 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nMusic Line Up\n\nRun To You\n\nHere I Am\n\nAny Time at All\n\nGod Only Knows\n\nThe Only Thing that Looks Good on Me is You\n\n(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\n\nCuts Like a Knife\n\nShe Knows Me\n\nWhen You’re Gone\n\nSummer of ‘69\n\n18 ‘Til I Die\n\nI Thought I’d Seen Everything\n\nHeaven\n\nIt’s Only Love\n\nYou’ve Been a Friend to Me\n\nC’mon Everybody\n\nStraight from the Heart\n\nAll for Love\n\nAbout the Production\n\nA production of THIRTEEN Productions LLC for WNET and Pivotal Media Inc., Bryan Adams in Concert is directed for television by David Horn and produced by Mitch Owgang.
