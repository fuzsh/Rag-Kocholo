        "text": "Canadian rocker Bryan Adams has become a father for the first time at age 51.\n\nPeople magazine reported Thursday that a baby girl, named Mirabella Bunny, was born April 22 to Adams and his personal assistant, Alicia Grimaldi, 31.\n\n\"She arrived like all good Easter bunnies on Easter Friday,\" Adams said in a statement issued after the People report.\n\n\"Mother and baby are both well and happy. Thanks in advance for your kind thoughts and wishes,\" he added.\n\nBorn in Kingston, Ont., and raised in Britain, Portugal, Israel and Vancouver, Adams has had a string of hits over the years, including Summer of '69, Run to You, (Everything I Do) I Do It for You and When You're Gone..\n\nHe also is active in charitable causes, an interest he shares with Grimaldi, who is one of the trustees of the Bryan Adams Foundation.\n\nGrimaldi helped set up the foundation in 2004, shortly after a tsunami ravaged Southeast Asia. The foundation provides grants to groups who help improve quality of life in developing countries.\n\nShe graduated from Cambridge University in 2001 with a degree in social and political sciences, according to her biography on the fund's website.\n\nAdams, who is also a photographer, plans a European concert tour next month."
