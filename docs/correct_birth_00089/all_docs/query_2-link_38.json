        "text": "Bryan Guy Adams, OC, OBC (born 5 November 1959) is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter, guitarist, bassist, producer, and photographer. Adams has won dozens of awards and nominations, including 18 Juno Awards among 56 nominations. He has also had 15 Grammy Award nominations including a win for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television in 1992. He has also won MTV, ASCAP, and American Music awards. In addition, he has won two Ivor Novello Awards for song composition and has been nominated for several Golden Globe Awards and three times for Academy Awards for his songwriting for films.\n\nAdams was awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia for contributions to popular music and philanthropic work via his own foundation, which helps improve education for people around the world. He is a well known photographer.[1][2]\n\nAdams was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 1998, and in April 2006 he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at Canada's Juno Awards.[3][4] In 2008, Bryan was ranked 38 on the list of All-Time top artists by the Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts. On 13 January 2010, he received the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award for his part in numerous charitable concerts and campaigns during his career,[5] and on 1 May 2010 was given the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for his 30 years of contributions to the arts.\n\nMusical career[]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nAdams was born in Kingston, Canada, to British parents. From his grandmother he also inherited a Maltese ancestry. As Adams's father was a diplomat, he grew up traveling around the world with his parents. Subsequently, most of his youth was spent growing up in his parents' native United Kingdom, Israel, Portugal, and Austria, part of the time in Cascais, Portugal, situated close to Lisbon, where he attended St Julians School. In 1973, Adams's family returned to Canada and momentarily settled down in Vancouver, British Columbia. He washed dishes, sold pet food, and worked in record stores, and at the age of 15, Adams quit school to play in nightclubs with bands like Shock and Sweeney Todd, who released an album called If Wishes Were Horses with the fifteen year old Adams as lead singer.[6]\n\nIn 1978, at the age of 18, Adams sent a few demo recordings to A&M Records in Toronto. Not long afterwards he signed with them for the sum of one dollar.[7] Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years, most notably \"I'm Ready\" (recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged) and \"Remember,\" which was recorded on his first album. Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album was released. Also recorded during this time was Adams's first single, \"Let Me Take You Dancing,\" which made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 (the b-side was entitled \"Don't Turn Me Away\").\n\nThe Adams/Vallance partnership wrote songs for many other artists notably Kiss,[8] Prism,[9] Bonnie Raitt,[10] Rod Stewart,[11] Neil Diamond,[12] Joe Cocker, Carly Simon,[13] and Loverboy[14] to name a few.\n\n1980s[]\n\nHis self-titled debut album was released in February 1980, and marked the beginning of what was to become a long songwriting partnership between Adams and co-writer Jim Vallance. With the exception of \"Remember\" and \"Wastin' Time\", most of the album was recorded from 29 October up until 29 November 1979 at Manta Studios in Toronto and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.[15]\n\nAdams's second album, You Want It You Got It, was recorded in New York City in two weeks and it marked Adams's first album co-produced by Bob Clearmountain. It was released in 1981 and contained the FM radio hit \"Lonely Nights,\" but it was not until his third album that he achieved international recognition, popularity and sales.\n\nAdams also co-wrote many songs for other bands during this time including \"War Machine\" and \"Rock and Roll Hell\" for Kiss, and \"No Way To Treat A Lady\" for Bonnie Raitt.\n\nCuts Like a Knife, which was released in January 1983, was Adams's breakout album due mainly to the lead singles. Straight from the Heart\" was the most successful song, reaching number ten on the Billboard Hot 100.[16] Another single, \"Cuts Like a Knife\" charted at number fifteen. \"This Time\" also placed on the Hot 100. Music videos were released for four of the singles from the album. \"Cuts Like a Knife\" arguably became Adams's most recognizable and popular song from the album. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television channels. The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart and achieved three times platinum status in Canada, platinum in the United States and gold in Australia.[15][16][17]\n\nAdams's best-selling album, Reckless, co-produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain, peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was released in November 1984 and featured the singles, \"Run to You\", \"Summer of '69\", \"Heaven\", \"One Night Love Affair\", \"Somebody\", and \"It's Only Love\", a duet with Tina Turner. All the singles had accompanying music videos and all charted on the Billboard Hot 100 but only \"Run to You\", \"Summer of '69\", and \"Heaven\" peaked in the top ten. \"Heaven\" would become the most successful single from Reckless at the time of its release on the pop charts, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the mainstream rock chart.[16] \"It's Only Love\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance.[18] After the release of the album, Adams was nominated for Best Male Rock Performance.[18] The album is Adams best-selling album in the United States and was certified five times platinum.[19]\n\nIn December 1984, Adams and his touring band, which consisted of Keith Scott, Dave Taylor, Pat Steward and Johnny Blitz, played concerts in Chicago, Detroit, New York and Philadelphia.[20] In early 1985, Adams started a tour throughout the United States, then later Japan, Australia, Europe and at last Canada.[20] After winning four Juno Awards, Adams started a Canadian tour through major cities across that country. Later he headed south towards the American West Coast, culminating with two dates at the studded Paladium in Los Angeles.[20]\n\nAfter the tour in the United States, Adams traveled to Ethiopia to aid famine relief in the country.[20] Adams was also part of a grand ensemble of Canadian artists named Northern Lights, who recorded the song \"Tears Are Not Enough\" for the African famine relief effort. Adams later headed back to Europe for a fifty-city concert tour with rock singer Tina Turner, culminating in April with his return to London to headline three sold-out shows at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.[20] Adams began the first leg of his tour entitled \"World Wide in 85\" which started in Oklahoma and ended in October 1985.[20] Adams would later visit Vancouver, Canada, and afterward returned to the American East Coast to play two sold-out concerts in New York.[20]\n\nThe follow up album to Reckless was Into the Fire which was released in 1987. The album was recorded at Cliffhanger Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia and mixed at AIR Studios in London and Warehouse Studio in Vancouver. This album contained the hit songs \"Heat Of The Night\" and \"Hearts On Fire\" and hit the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn 1989 Adams did backup singing for the Belinda Carlisle's song \"Whatever it takes\" which appeared on her Album Runaway Horses.\n\n1990s[]\n\nAdams's next album, Waking Up the Neighbours, co-produced by Adams and Mutt Lange, sold over ten million copies worldwide and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200.[16] It was even more successful on the other side of the Atlantic, reaching number 1 on both big European markets, the UK and Germany. The album was released in September 1991 and featured \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", his second no. 1 hit single in Billboard Hot 100. This song was featured in the movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner and Alan Rickman. The single topped the charts in numerous countries around the world including big markets such as the US, the UK, France, Australia and Germany. \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" spent a record-breaking sixteen weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart. It also achieved record-breaking sales of four million copies in the US.[19] [21][22] Canadian content regulations were revised in 1991 to allow radio stations to credit airplay of this album towards their legal requirements to play Canadian music.[22] Adams won a Grammy Award in 1991 for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.[23][24]\n\nAdams further supported the album with his tour, Waking Up the World which started on 4 October 1991, in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On 18 December 1991, Adams played two first-ever shows in Reykjavík, Iceland and then performed in the U.S. with a concert at the Ritz Theatre on 10 January.[20] It was a sell-out in less than twenty minutes.[20] In attendance were music legends Ben E. King and Nona Hendryx.[20] The Canadian leg of the ‘Waking Up The World’ Tour kicked off in Sydney, Nova Scotia on 13 January 1992, and wrapped up with a standing room only concert in Vancouver, Canada, on the 31st. In February 1992, he started touring in New Zealand and Australia for seven dates—kicking off with a press conference in Sydney. On 21 February, the tour headed to Japan for approximately a dozen shows in six cities. The tour continued through several European countries in June 1992, including Italy, Germany, Holland and Scandinavia, and in July 1992, Bryan performed for the first time in Hungary and Turkey (where he filmed his video for \"Do I Have To Say The Words?\"). During the long tour, further singles from the Waking Up the Neighbors album were released: In the US, the rocky \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\" peaked at number 2, and \"Do I Have To Say The Words?\" reached number 11. In the UK, \"Thought I Died and Gone to Heaven\" was the most successful single behind \"(Everything I Do) I Do it for You\" by reaching the Top 10. In September through December 1993, the tour took place in the US.
