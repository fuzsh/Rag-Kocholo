        "text": "Having just released his seventh album, DITCH THIS TOWN, Houston Bernard has upped his game and intends to promote this new album and his own brand of country music, one that mixes storytelling with some forceful rock energy that was inspired by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp, with numerous live shows over the next couple of years. Lonesome Highway took the opportunity to talk to him about his own past and that of his family and notorious outlaw ancestor.\n\nMusic played a large part in your background growing up in Oklahoma, with both your father and uncle being musicians in the 70s. What lasting influence has this had on you?\n\nI didn't get to grow up with my dad and my uncle because my parents split up, but once I joined the Army at 18 years old, I was able to travel a bit more and finally meet him. I feel like I am fulfilling my destiny as a human. I am following in my family's footsteps and doing it my way. It is fulfilling, and I have a purpose. It's not just songs either, I am digging deep and making my art from my heart and soul.\n\nThere’s also the story of George “Bitter Creek” Newcomb, a member of the infamous Dalton gang. He was a distant family relative and an outlaw. Was that any influence on your musical outlook in any way?\n\nYes and he was also a member of the WILD BUNCH of which the Eagles did a concept album about, Desperado and track 10 is a song called Bittercreek. Having a legendary band like the Eagles do a song about your Great-Great Grandfather is pretty awesome. Musically I have always followed my heart and I have written and performed in many styles, I honestly never thought I would have 6 albums of country music that I am so proud of. Colouring outside the lines is definitely In My Blood.\n\nYour family then moved to Alaska, which is quite a different location. Did that also affect your future?\n\nHell yeah it did, my dad was a broke musician so he rejoined the Army and they sent us there. Eventually my parents split up and my mom remarried. That step father is the source of a couple songs on the new album, I didn’t want to write about it but my writing partner encouraged me to, I am semi-glad I did, there is a lot of rage and pain in the new album you will not hear in any other albums I have put out since 2012.\n\nWhen did you move to your current location?\n\nMy Dad met my mom touring, he is from Norman, Oklahoma, where I was born and met my mom in Massachusetts. She is from Worcester. Eventually, she moved us back to Worcester, by the time I went to high school. Leaving everything you have ever known had a profound effect on me and the only ways I knew how to express myself was either through music or fighting.\n\nYou were also a specialist in the army for nine years. Did you put the music on hold during that period?\n\nNot at all, I kept writing since I was 11 years old. I would write and record on tapes. I have a lot of my songs cataloged. I performed at soldier shows and when I left the Army and graduated college I moved to NYC and got involved in the underground scenes there, I toured all over the States, Canada and some places in Europe.\n\nSome of your named influences run from Dolly Parton to Queen. That would seem to be twin points in the way you make music now, a mix of rock and country. What is your favourite era for listening in the main?\n\nThere is so much music out there that moves me and of course it changes because I try and keep my mind open and it’s a journey. I call my brand of country \"Heartland Country\" A lot of it is 1984 Springsteen/Mellencamp/Bryan Adams era. Though the new albums is more of like the Into The Fire album by Bryan Adams in the sense that is pretty gray and dark in some spots.\n\nHow much time is taken up with your musical career now?\n\n24/7 - I'm constantly thinking about it, prepping for shows, writing, doing shows, traveling and when you are independent and you don’t have a financial backer you have to figure it out for yourself. And when you come from literally nothing, everything takes longer and you make all the mistakes and things keep changing. If you don’t enjoy the journey and the challenges I would have got burnt out years ago. It's a fire in me that has not seemed to burn out yet, so I keep riding that wave. It's like air for me.\n\nDo you largely gig with a band, or is it a mix of that and solo gigs?\n\nBoth, I love both in a different way. To try and get the attention of a room as a solo acoustic takes some serious skill and I am always trying to improve in connecting with others. That is what is all about for me.\n\nIn the current climate, how long did it take to record and release DITCH THIS TOWN?\n\nIt took me about 4 years and more investment than I will probably see back. But, it is extremely fulfilling.\n\nDid you enjoy the recording experience and working with Bill McDermott, or do you prefer the live experience?\n\nFor me, they are two different animals. I enjoy the recording process and also the live experience. Bill is great to work with and we had a strong working relationship from the start. He hears things I don’t, and I am able to add a lot of my own spice, and he encourages it.\n\nYou often co-write. Is that the method that works best for you?\n\nit is, I love a good co-write. When you put a few creative people together it can only improve the song. I love the process. This is the best work I have ever done. I was a writer on 10 of the 11 songs. The 11th song I loved so much, it spoke to me. That song is Come Undone by Ezra Hale.\n\nHow difficult is it for a relatively new musician to gain attention nowadays?\n\nI wouldn’t know, I have been doing it professionally since I was 12 years old and Im not even close to that age now. But if you mean a relatively unknown musician? All markets are saturated, there is a lot of quality but if you don’t have investment or a passion for social media to blow up, it’s a passion project. At this point I do music for me, not because I want to be famous. I love connecting with people who are moved or entertained by my music. Life is short and I get so much back from people being affected by the art I make.\n\nHave you ambitions to play in other territories?\n\nI’d love to perform everywhere people want me. Go where you are loved is what I always say. I watch my analytics and see where people are playing my music, it’s literally all over the world, so I'm hoping to get more opportunities to share my music and meet more people.\n\nWhat are your plans for the future after this release?\n\nI think for the next couple years I will be promoting this album, making content to support it and sharing it with whomever wants to listen. But I have already started writing for my seventh country album. I recorded 5 new songs last week."
