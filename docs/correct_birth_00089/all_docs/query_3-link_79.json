        "text": "Doors open one hour before the show.\n\nSpecial guest, Alter Ego, to open at 6:30 p.m.\n\nParking available on site.\n\nFormed in 2008 in Canada, Waking Up The Neighbors have toured across Canada, Mexico, the USA, and Europe, playing sold-out concerts to jubilant fans everywhere. This band faithfully reproduces the look and excitement of a Bryan Adams concert. “You’d swear it was Adams, going by the talent, charisma, and energy coming off the stage from the whole crew.” said one reviewer. Their remarkable recreation of the Bryan Adams Live experience has brought audiences to their feet wherever they go.\n\nDoug Varty, the lead vocalist, has performed with the real Tina Turner and Bob Seger and Bryan Adams’ lead guitarist Keith Scott. Keith described Doug as “One hell of a great singer and performer!” Doug has been in the Tribute business since 1998, starting as a Rod Stewart tribute and touring the world with his Forever Young show.\n\nLooking for something a little closer to his own roots, Doug chose Bryan Adams for his raspy tone of voice, the great anthemic songs, and the big rock energy generated by Bryan and his band. (Doug’s quite a guitar player, and he wanted to show that off too!)\n\nHis long-time band and close friends, The Road Brothers, are a seasoned group of family members that have been on the road almost since birth, doing shows in venues everywhere, pleasing crowds with their enthusiasm and skill.\n\nA “WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS” partial songlist:\n\nCuts Like A Knife\n\nSummer of 69\n\nRun To You\n\nCan’t Stop This Thing We Started\n\nEverything I Do\n\nStraight From The Heart\n\nBack To You\n\nHeaven\n\nKids Wanna Rock\n\nIt’s Only Love"
