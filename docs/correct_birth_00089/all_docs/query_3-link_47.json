        "text": "Born in Ontario, Canada, Bryan Adams, 63, joined his first band at 15. Reckless, his 1984 album, gave him the hits Run to You and Summer of ’69, and made him a global star. His 1991 song, (Everything I Do) I Do It For You won a Grammy and is one of the bestselling singles of all time. On 14 December Adams plays London’s O2 Arena, and his latest album is So Happy It Hurts. He lives in Vancouver and has two daughters with Alicia Grimaldi.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nImpatience.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nPeople who make you wait around for them.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nWalking with Eric Clapton’s tour manager Mick to meet Eric backstage, and when I met Eric I said, “Hi Mick.” I wanted to die.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nLetters from my grandfather. He always ended them with, “Keep smiling.”\n\nDescribe yourself in three words.\n\nNot quite right.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nPractically everything.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nRock music.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nTalking too fast.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nCharlize Theron.\n\nWould you choose fame or anonymity?\n\nAnonymity every time.\n\nWhat was the last lie that you told?\n\nThat I’d choose anonymity every time.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nOat milk lattes.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nIt can be as light as a feather or as heavy as a stone.\n\nHave you ever said ‘I love you’ and not meant it?\n\nNot yet!\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\n“Yes, you can have a selfie.”\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nHow big music companies have treated their artists in the digital age.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nWhen I see videos of animal cruelty.\n\nHow often do you have sex?\n\nMy doc says men need sex 27 times a month for a healthy prostate, but who actually gets that?\n\nWhat would you like to leave your children?\n\nThe ability to look at themselves and laugh.\n\nWhat is the closest you’ve come to death?\n\nSkydiving: the parachute got tangled around my legs.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nPaying my rent and being able to support my family from making music.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nThe couple in the hotel room next to me.\n\nWould you rather have more sex, money or fame?\n\nJust a cup of tea would be fine.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nHe came, he laughed, he left.\n\nWhat happens when we die?\n\nWe become garden fertiliser."
