        "text": "Background\n\nBryan Adams is a household name in the rock music industry, and his commitment to social activism and animal welfare is a bonus to him. He was born to Elizabeth Jane and Conrad Adams on November 5, 1959, in Kingston, Canada. His zodiac sign is Scorpio. He has a younger brother, Bruce Adams. His prowess as a guitarist, singer, songwriter, social activist and photographer is unmatched. In his early years, he became aware of his musical talent. It has been established that he participated in a variety of activities as a teenager to improve his musical abilities. At the age of 12, he obtained a position as a dishwasher and started saving money for his first guitar. He rehearsed regularly to improve his musical skills, and also performed with bands at clubs and restaurants.\n\nAdams’ life is a classic example of ‘success is when opportunity meets preparation.’ Shortly after he performed as the lead vocalist for the Sweeney Todd rock band, his career took off when he was introduced to Jim Vallance, who is a Canadian producer and songwriter. The collaboration between the two distinguished Adams’ vocal sound, only to be matched by the likes of Steve Marriott and Rod Stewart. Since then, he has won numerous accolades and acclaim for his superb artistic output. His hit song ‘(Everything I Do) I Do It For You’ (1991) has seen him bag a Grammy Award, an American Music Award, and an M.T.V. Video Music Award. Some of his well-known works, including “Cuts Like a Knife” (1983), “Pretty Woman: The Musical,” and “Reckless” (1984), propelled him to global stardom.\n\nNotably, Adams is a philanthropist who is associated with The Bryan Adams Foundation and provides financial grants for specific humanitarian projects. He is also against any form of animal cruelty and he actively advocates for animal rights. Adams has never married. However, he has had relationships with Cecilie Thomsen and Alicia Grimaldi. Adams and Grimaldi were blessed with two daughters, the eldest was born in 2011 and the youngest in 2013."
