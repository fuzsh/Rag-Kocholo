        "text": "Bryan Adams was born in 1959 and would go on to become one of Canada's greatest musical exports. He got into the music game early, becoming a background vocalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Company in his teens; outside of the CBC, he started gaining a strong reputation as a backup singer for local musicians, including Robbie King. His career in the spotlight started in 1976, when he joined the band Sweeney Todd, previously charted in Canada with single \"Roxy Roller.\" In 1980, Adams officially went solo with his self-titled debut, which featured a number of glam- and New Wave-flavored tracks, including Canadian charting single \"Hidin' from Love.\" Moving forward, Adams would team up with producer Bob Clearmountain, who around that time also worked on albums for The Rolling Stones, Roxy Music, David Bowie, and Bruce Springsteen. As a result, 1981's spirited ‘You Want It, You Got It' had a clearer, more focused sound; single \"Lonely Nights\" peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and Adams' fate was sealed.\n\nHis most successful work would come a couple of years later in the form of the shimmering, passionate ‘Reckless,' which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., eventually going 5x Platinum. ‘Reckless' contains what's still considered some of Adams' greatest songs, including \"Run to You,\" \"Heaven,\" and, of course, rock masterpiece \"Summer of ‘69.\" Since those early ‘80s albums, Adams has toured almost yearly, putting up long, worldwide routes for his new albums. Adams won a Grammy in 1992 for \"(Everything I Do) It Do It for You,\" which was written for the Kevin Costner film ‘Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.' He'd go on to be awarded some of Canada's highest honors, including the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia, and he landed in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2006. A few years later, he'd join the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
