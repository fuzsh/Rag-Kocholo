        "text": "The name of this singer is associated among true connoisseurs of music with the romance of his concerts and with the lyrics of his soulful ballads.\n\n\"Canadian troubadour\" (as his fans call him), a talented composer, guitarist, rock singer - Bryan Adams.\n\nChildhood and youth Bryan Adams\n\nThe future famous rock musician was born on November 5, 1959 in the port city of Kingston (in the south of the Canadian province of Ontario) in the family of a diplomat and teacher.\n\nFrom early childhood, he was used to constant moving. Young Brian had to live for several years in Austria, and in Israel, and in England, and in France. He managed to return to Canada and settle in Vancouver with his brother and mother only after his parents divorced.\n\nMusic Brian began to be interested in early childhood. The five-year-old boy was initially interested in the classics, but then he became interested in the guitar and lost interest in serious art.\n\nThe mother of the future singer believed that, as a teacher, she should support any undertakings of the child and was always on his side. The father, on the contrary, did not approve of much and was very strict with his son.\n\nWhen a teenager arranged a disco in the basement of the house, the stern diplomat was angry for a long time and could not calm down. Brian himself needed very little to be happy - it was enough to get a new disc with musical recordings.\n\nThe father planned that his offspring would follow in his footsteps and devote his life to the diplomatic service. Brian's grandfather insisted on a military career and dreamed of sending him to the academy.\n\nThe young musician categorically opposed and dropped out of school. From that moment began his creative biography.\n\nCreation\n\nAfter leaving school, Brian took up music. Gathered a small team of the same young talents and began to give concerts in his own garage. So there was a group known among young people Sweeney Todd. Brian was her leader.\n\nFor two years, the young musician managed to work with many youth groups, found a significant number of friends and like-minded people. Many of the musicians he collaborated with helped launch his career.\n\nOnce in a musical instrument store, where Brian was choosing a guitar, there was a meeting with Jim Vallens, a talented drummer. Young people started talking, decided to cooperate and subsequently became friends. They composed songs and sold them to famous singers.\n\nTheir compositions were performed by Boney Tyler, Joe Cocker and KISS. For a long time, friends could not find a producer to start performing themselves.\n\nAfter six months of working together, they nevertheless signed a contract with a well-known recording studio. So the first song Let Me Take You Dancing was aired, which became popular and brought success. As a result, the producers themselves began to offer cooperation.\n\nWith the help of Bruce Ellen, the album Cuts like a knife was recorded in 1983, which quickly became incredibly popular. Then Bryan Adams began to actively perform with concerts in different cities.\n\n1984 and 1987 marked the release of two more albums. But the sixth album of the musician, released in 1991, Waking Up The Neighbors, is considered a masterpiece.\n\nBy this time, the rock musician had visited on tour not only a huge number of cities in America and Canada, but also European countries, performed in Moscow, Kyiv and Minsk.\n\nAt the same time, Bryan Adams began to actively collaborate with filmmakers. His most famous works are songs for the films The Three Musketeers, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Don Juan de Marco.\n\nIn addition, Adams wrote music for forty more films. As an actor, he appeared in the film House of Fools by Andrei Konchalovsky, where he played himself.\n\nThe solo career of the famous Canadian singer gradually began to stop in the mid-1990s. She was replaced by joint work with famous performers. For example, with Sting and Rod Stewart.\n\nThe merits of Bryan Adams as a talented musician, singer and composer were highly appreciated in his homeland by the Order of Canada. In 2011, his personal star was opened on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nMusician's personal life\n\nThe civil wife of Bryan Adams was his assistant Alicia Grimaldi, a former student of Cambridge, who worked with him in the field of charity. In April 2011, she gave birth to the 51-year-old singer's daughter, Mirabella Bunny. Two years later, a second daughter, Lulu Rosily, was born.\n\nBryan Adams now\n\nAfter living in France for several years, the musician decided to return with his family to Vancouver, where he lives to this day. Has a personal recording studio.\n\nHe devotes his free time to black and white photography. A series of portraits of famous Canadian women even came out as a separate book, all the money from the sale of which was directed to charity, in particular to the treatment of people with cancer.\n\nIn 2016, Bryan Adams spoke out in defense of members of sexual minorities, outraged that in the state of Mississippi homosexuals are deprived of many civil rights. Such protests were quite popular among famous artists and film companies.\n\nAt the moment, a talented musician, full of creative powers, is still ready to delight his fans with new songs."
