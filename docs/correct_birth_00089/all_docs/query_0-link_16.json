        "text": "Bryan Adams (born November 5, 1959) is a successful Canadian singer and songwriter. He was born in Kingston, Ontario to British parents, and moved with his parents throughout Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAdams was given his first guitar at age ten, bought his first electric guitar at age 11 and at age 14 moved to Vancouver and started auditioning as a guitarist. He left school at 15, joined a band as a singer and went on the road. He met drummer Jim Vallance in 1977 and the two began collaborating as songwriters, and before long their material was being covered by many artists. A&M Records was sent some demos and signed Adams to a recording contract at age 18.\n\nHe has released 14 albums since then.\n\nIn 1990 he joined many other guests (including Michael Kamen) for Roger Waters' massive performance of The Wall in Berlin. Apart from that he is engaged in many charity projects like Greenpeace's 'Saving the Whales' or Amnesty International. He recently joined Canada's benefit concert for the tsunami victims.\n\nOne of his most popular success was the album Waking Up the Neighbours in 1991 (see 1991 in music), produced by Mutt Lange and featuring the ballad '(Everything I Do) I Do It for You'. This song was a huge #1 hit around the world. Other soundtrack songs were 'Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?' from Don Juan de Marco; and 'All For Love' from The Three Musketeers, performed with Rod Stewart and Sting. Adams has been nominated for three Academy Awards.\n\nHis musical career also includes several collaborations and duets, e.g. with Tina Turner in 'It's Only Love', Sarah McLachlan in 'Don't Let Go', Mel C. in 'When you're Gone', Chicane in 'Don't Give Up', and the aforementioned collaboration on 'All For Love'.\n\nHe has been inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. In 1990 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia. In 1998 he was promoted to an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nHis latest album, Room Service was released on September 28, 2004 with 'Open Road' being its first single. The second single 'Flying' is a typical Bryan Adams ballad. Adams is currently working on an acoustic album while touring.\n\nDiscography\n\nBryan Adams (1980)\n\nYou Want It You Got It (1981)\n\nCuts Like a Knife (1983)\n\nReckless (1984)\n\nInto the Fire (1987)\n\nLive!Live!Live!
