        "text": "A stroll through Kingston is the story of Canadian music with the director’s commentary on—it’s a city with history.\n\nWhen they step on stage, Kingston’s up-and-coming musicians know who they’ll be measured against: stadium-filling rock stars, respected singer-songwriters and national icons.\n\nFor most, it’s not pressure—it’s a promise of what the city can offer.\n\nA main drag like Princess Street is an informal musical hall of fame and you can’t help but pick favourites.\n\n6. Bryan Adams\n\nBringing up the rear, Adams brought Canadian music to the world stage in the ‘80s. Hits like “Run to You” and “Summer of ’69” were inescapable when they topped charts and are a still radio staples.\n\nDoubters may say he was only born in Kingston—don’t buy it. Bryan Adams is as interwoven with his birthplace’s music scene as the limestone buildings.\n\nWhen he takes the stage in town and changes the lyrics of “Alberta Bound” to be about Kingston, it’s clear where the song belongs. A long-running career like this doesn’t happen by accident, or without Kingston roots.\n\nTrack to check out: Summer of ’69\n\n5. The Headstones\n\nThese hard rockers may have never had Bryan Adams’ ticket sales, but outsiders like them are the reason Kingston left its mark on music.\n\nThe Headstones are right out of a garage rock fantasy: punchy electric guitars crackle alongside stand out performances from charismatic frontman Hugh Dillon. Their songs may not have had other Kingston artists’ reach, but they’re the reason a legion of teenagers picked up guitars and formed bands.\n\nWith controversial and taboo lyrics backed up by serious musical chops, The Headstones belong on any list of Canada’s best.\n\nTrack to check out: When Something Stands For Nothing\n\n4. Bedouin Soundclash\n\nWhen the laidback groove of “When The Night Feels My Songs” hit the radio over a decade ago it meant one thing: you had a new favourite song.\n\nBedouin Soundclash, formed at Queen’s University, is a lesson in the big returns of a little experimentation. Their combination of ska, reggae and indie introduced a new generation to the city and redefined what the local music scene was capable of.\n\nInfectious melodies and choruses meant they became a fixture for the country’s music fans and an easy example of what some university students could do, given the chance and the instruments.\n\nTrack to check out: Walls Fall Down"
