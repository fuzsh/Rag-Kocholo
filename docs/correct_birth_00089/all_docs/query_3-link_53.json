        "text": "Event Info\n\nFamed musician and singer-songwriter Bryan Adams has announced his 2023 So Happy It Hurts Tour with iconic group Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. The upcoming tour is in support of Bryan Adams’ 15th studio album, So Happy It Hurts.\n\nBryan Adams has the reputation of being one the most exciting live musicians in the world. His energetic vocals and stage presence have proven to entertain for over 40 years. His songwriting has garnered him numerous awards and accolades including three Academy Award nominations, five Golden Globe nominations, a Grammy Award and 20 Juno Awards.\n\nJoan Jett grew up during a time when rock ‘n’ roll was off limits to girls and women, but as a teenager, she promptly blew the door to the boys’ club right off its hinges. After forming her band the Blackhearts in 1979, with whom Jett has become a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, she has had eight platinum and gold albums and nine Top 40 singles, including the classics \"Bad Reputation,\" \"I Love Rock 'N' Roll,\" \"I Hate Myself For Loving You,\" and \"Crimson and Clover.\" With a career that has spanned music, film, television, Broadway, and humanitarianism, Joan Jett remains a potent force and inspiration to generations of fans worldwide."
