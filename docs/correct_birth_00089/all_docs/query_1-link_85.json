        "text": "Born on the fifth of November, 1959 and hailing from Ontario, Canada, Bryan Adams is the best selling Canadian rock artist of all time. With over 100 million records sold over nearly 40 years in showbusiness, he’s still at the top of his game.\n\nIt would be too easy to focus on Adams’ astonishing commercial success to show his appeal. The millions of records sold, the longest running number one single in UK chart history, the Juno’s. Grammy’s. Golden Globes. Oscar nominations. Ivor Novello’s. However, I don’t think that a simple list of awards and sales statistics quite covers just how vital an artist Bryan Adams was and remains to be to this day.\n\nI think to truly get it one has to look at the man’s global influence. One has to look at how his music can be played and truly loved in pretty much equal measure from his native Kingston, Ontario, to the farest reaches of Nepal.\n\nHis is music that transcends culture and language, and that makes him one of very few musicians in pop history to truly realize the universal qualities of rock and roll, and that’s saying something.\n\n“Summer of ‘69”? “Heaven”? “Can’t Stop This Thing We Started”? It would take someone with a heart of stone not to love those songs, from his primal, party starting rockers to his elegant, tear jerking ballads.\n\nIn all, what Adams has achieved is shown in how people all around the world have embraced his music. Quite simply, he’s still playing and writing some of the best rock and roll music that the great white north has ever had to offer to this day, and there’s never been a better time to join in than right now.\n\nRead more\n\nI heard his music for the first time in Thailand when I was so young. My mom turned on the radio while did her house chores in the kitchen. Summer '69 with his hoarse voice. Honestly, I had no idea what he sang, even I had no idea that he spoke English. However, the music rhythm and his characteristic voice hit through the heart of that young boy and I moved along with the song.\n\nSecond time I heard was when I was in the High school, while I was listening for the free album in Tower-Record Cd & Cassette store after Broken heart with a girl from the another school. I heard again the hoarse but charming voice of Bryan, with the song; Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you. After that I rang the number to the pager company send a lyric of this song to her, asked to come back together. Of course it didn't work out.\n\nThird time, 2 days ago. I got a ticket from friend who really love Bryan Adams so much. I was happy to watch concert as well, especially it's FREE !! Yah !! When the stage turned dark and audiences started to scream his name, I saw an old dude walked to the middle of the stage, WTF! That's Bryan? seriously? Obviously he's getting old, but after he started to sing his ever songs, OMG! I could say that he was one of the best singer who taken care of himself very well. His hoarse voice still worked as it was. After Summer' 69, Heaven, Anything I do I do it for you, and Cut like a knife, nearly two hours, my voice was gone instead. lol. Shame on me.\n\nIt was one of my memorial concert, and I must say, You will regret if you miss this concert.\n\nPS. 9/10, because of He didn't sing \"Please forgive me\" ^^,\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWhat makes a Bryan Adams show so great? So many things, for sure, as it is a testament that I am willing to travel the world to see this man perform. I love the simplicity and focus on music, love the tee shirt jeans look with his guitar up front, then opening his voice is just like a door into paradise.\n\nI am one of the thousands of 50ish something women who have followed BA since the early 1980's and have high expectations of going to any one of his shows and for me the one memory that sicks is the show I went to in Melbourne Australia where I had paid thousands of dollars to have front row seats for me and my bestie, and Bryan spoke to me... I was sure that in that moment if I HAD DIED I would have been as happy as I could be.\n\nI see Bryan as a man who is dedicated to his work and his passion is constantly showing through in his tunes, he plays all the old favorites and is forever delighting fans with new songs. The only thing worth saying you should expect when going to a BA show is to be taken on a journey, and for me the songs make various moments in my past come alive again for a few moments and the new songs give me a glimpse into what might well be another favorite song.\n\nLiving in Aus is a pain waiting for Bryan to tour so a couple years ago I moved to the UK and one of the main reasons was so I could see the BA show more often and I have been to many concerts in many different countries and venues including the Albert Hall (love the fact it is so much easier to get good tickets in the UK without having to pay a arm and a leg).\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nHELLO, I am here to share my testimony on how I finally joined the Illuminati brotherhood with the help of Mr. Olta I am now RICH, FAMOUS, AND POWERFUL, I tried my best to become a member of the brotherhood, but I was scammed several times before I found a testimony about Mr. Olta on the internet so I contacted him, I was so afraid that he would ask me for a lot of money before I could join the light, but to my greatest surprise he only asked me to buy the items I made and today I am very happy to tell the world that I am rich and have been able to build many businesses with all this I obtained an instant sum of 7 million dollars in my account and I am also known all over the world with the business. that the Illuminati brotherhood gave me and I also have the power to do what I want ...

All the old favourites plus a few off the new album and a couple of covers near the end, notably 'I Fought The Law' and 'Whiskey In The jar' where a substitution of 'Some men like to hear the cannonballs a-roaring' with 'Some men like the hear the Cardiff crowd a-roaring' brought an almighty response from the delighted audience, which consisted of a surprising amount of young people as well as the not-so-young. Plenty of humour too including a cameo dance routine from the band as they took their bow and cameras panning around the crowd for the craziest dencers etc. Bryan's as good as he ever was and so are Keith & Mickey. Very enjpyable.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAmazing as always. I’ve seen Bryan Adams many, many times and he never fails to entertain. He worked non stop for 2 and a half hours solid (carrying on playing solo acoustic of some of his famous songs whilst the rest of his band took a breather-they all work so hard though ).\n\nI actually think this particular concert was his best yet. He sang about 26 songs (old and new) and had such a great rapport with the crowd. He had cheeky banter, people up and dancing for the cameraman and his usual getting the crowd to singalong ....\n\nI’ll be seein you again BA , very soon.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
