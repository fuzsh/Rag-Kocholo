        "text": "I grew up on Canada's east coast in Nova Scotia. When I was 10 yrs old I began tinkering around with the piano. Bryan Adam’s “Cuts Like A Knife” album was released that same year. You could say I’ve literally (as the kids put it lol) grown up listening to Bryan Adams.\n\nSometimes I get a little teased about it. It’s probably the whole, such a stereotypical Canadian thing, part of my heritage almost. I mean, a blue jean jacket and blue jeans are referred to as a Canadian tuxedo! Throw in a white T-shirt and you had Bryan Adam’s 1980s stage attire completed.\n\nI’m always quick to point out that Bryan Adams has never stopped making and releasing albums. In the States, I think due to record label issues, much of his music hasn’t been promoted well since about the mid nineties. Either way, his hit catalog from the 80s and 90s eras alone is more than most artists could ever dream to have. No doubt he’s a fantastic writer. If you aren’t familiar with some of his long time writing partners, such as Jim Vallance, Mutt Lange, and Gretchen Peters, give them a search on Google and you’ll be reading their accomplishments for a while!\n\nBack in 2014, Bryan set out on tours that he referred to as Bare Bones. It was just he and his piano player, Gary Breit on stage performing to packed houses in theaters around the world. I caught him in Detroit at the beautiful Fox Theater.\n\nOf course, I’d seen him in the live setting with his full blown band. But this stripped down, raw live performance (his voice even now in his 60s is still sounding amazing) hit me to the core. I loved his stories between the songs, his humility, and his humor. It made for a very memorable concert experience. And isn’t that what we really want from a concert, not just hearing the songs?\n\nSo again for me, it comes back to the storytelling. Have you ever been to The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville? It’s the premier listening room. Audiences know they are there to listen to the songwriters in the round. Talking is severely frowned upon and you’ll be ‘shushed’ if you do. The last time I went to The Bluebird, hit songwriter Gary Burr and his wife, Georgia Middleman were there. They told some amazing stories and played hits they had written for megastars like Tim McGraw and Keith Urban.\n\nI try to fit that storytelling vibe into the lyrics of my songs. I’ve enjoyed playing a few Songwriter in the Round type events in Michigan and I hope to do more. If you have any interest in hearing about the stories behind the songs on my latest album, perhaps you’d enjoy my Commentary album. I share quick one-minute stories behind the songs. You can check it out here. Again, thank you for being a listener!\n\nP.S. The above photo from that night in 2014 was taken by professional photographer, Marc Nader. I didn’t know him at the time but I’ve since had the pleasure of working with him and he is fantastic! Here's a photo he took of me in 2019."
