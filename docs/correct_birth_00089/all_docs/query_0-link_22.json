        "text": "Bryan Adams is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter. He was born on November 5, 1959 in Kingston, Ontario. For Sweeney Todd, Bryan Adams was the lead vocalist from 1976 to 1977.\n\nCareer[]\n\nAdams had been working with various bands in the Vancouver music scene. When Sweeney Todd in 1976 searched for a replacement for their lead singer Nick Gilder who had left the band, they first choose Clark Perry. However, he didn't really fit in with the other band members. Sweeney Todd's guitarist Skip Prest suggested Bryan Adams whom he had noticed doing some work together with a local band called Slan. After some time of testing, Adams became the new vocalist for the band.[1]\n\nBryan Adams appeared on some singles by Sweeney Todd, first on a re-release of their first single Roxy Roller, as well as on the band's second album If Wishes Were Horses. He soon left the band to start a solo career.\n\nHe released his first solo single Let Me Take You Dancing in 1978 and his first solo album Bryan Adams in 1980. The breakthrough in Canada and the United States came in 1983 with his third solo album Cuts Like a Knife, and Adams turned into a global star in 1984 with his fourth solo album Reckless.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nWith Sweeney Todd:\n\nAlbums:\n\nIf Wishes Were Horses (1977)\n\nSingles:\n\nRoxy Roller (1976)\n\nSay Hello, Say Goodbye (1976)\n\nIf Wishes Were Horses (1977)\n\nSong For a Star (1977)\n\nSolo:\n\nMain article: w:c:bryan-adams:Discography\n\n[]\n\nOffical Website of Bryan Adams\n\nBryan Adams at Wikipedia\n\nBryan Adams at the Bryan Adams Wiki"
