        "meta_description": "Eleanor of Aragon (1 February 1402 â€“ 19 February 1445) was queen consort of Portugal as the spouse of Edward I of Portugal. She was the daughter of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque. When her husband died, she was appointed regent of Portugal in his will. However, she was inexperienced and, as an Aragonese, unpopular with the people, who preferred the late king's brother Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra. The confirmation of her regency therefore caused a riot in Lisbon.",
