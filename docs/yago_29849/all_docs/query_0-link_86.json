        "text": "I'm making a TL where Castile and Aragon remain separate. The PoD is Alfonso, Prince of Asturias lives. Enjoy...\n\nHenry IV of Castile was a weak King. Under Henry, lawlessness flourished. Henry was unable to produce an heir with his first wife, Blanche of Navarre, so he re-married to Joan of Portugal for a Portuguese alliance. Yet Henry and Joan failed to have an heir and rumour spread that Henry was impotent. Then six years into the marriage, Joan produced a daughter, Joanna, to the shock of the kingdom. Surely, they would not have to endure a possible regency! And the threat of a regency loomed, as Henry was far from young. The future would be much better under Henry's half-brother, Alfonso.\n\nRumour spread that Joanna was not Henry's daughter but that of Joan's supposed affair with Beltran de La Cueva, Duke of Albuquerque. Joanna was mockingly named 'la Beltraneja'. In 1464, Henry agreed to name Alfonso as his heir. He reneged on the agreement, prompting Henry's enemies to declare Alfonso as King Alfonso XII. Civil war erupted in Castile. In 1469, Henry backed down and agreed that Alfonso was his heir, provided that he marry Joanna[1]. Henry died five years later and Alfonso was crowned King Alfonso XII of Castile.\n\nAlfonso's sister, Isabella, married Ferdinand, Prince of Girona, son of Juan II of Aragon. On his deathbed, Juan II divided his kingdoms, with his daughter Eleanor by his first wife Blanche I of Navarre getting Navarre and Ferdinand getting Aragon. Then Juan died and Ferdinand became Ferdinand II of Aragon. Ferdinand and Isabella had three children; Infante Juan, Prince of Girona, and the infantas Joanna and Isabella. Ferdinand and Louis XII of France were bitter rivals. They partitioned Naples but Ferdinand broke his agreement with Louis XII. The French were expelled from Naples and Ferdinand gained the Neapolitan crown, leaving the French to rule northern Italy, for the time being.\n\n[1] In OTL, Alfonso died in 1468.\n\n[2]Yes, OTL Isabella I\n\n-------------\n\nAnother update coming soon...\n\nInteresting to see where this goes.\n\nJust a quick thing: you might want to consider your timings. I know that OTL a civil war did start over the succession to the throne, but it only happened when Henry IV died. In the brief interregnum before a new monarch has been confirmed, you have a window to argue that the heir is not legally entitled to the throne, and these wars can occur, but in TTL you've actually had the civil war start during Henry's life. To depose a King you need a very good reason why they've betrayed the country and are not fit to reign, and changing one's mind over one's heir is not a very good reason. Unless Alfonso's supporters are going to try to utterly tar Henry's name - in which case they may still lack support from the commonfolk - then they don't really have a strong position here.\n\nIf you're just looking to have Henry pressured into changing the heir I'd suggest you can do it just as well by negotiation - and by that, I include arguments, threats, slanderings and underhanded dealings - which leave the King with no option but to change the succession. Or just have Alfonso survive longer (which you've already done) so that when the OTL civil war occurs, he is still the favoured candidate for the throne - the only reason Isabella got it was that Alfonso had died 6 years before the civil war began.\n\nOf course, it's your TL so you should write what you want to write, but I just thought I'd raise that.\n\nNot much of a POD yet, but I'll wait for the second chapter.\n\nI think it's plenty of a POD. Alfonso has lived longer, and has taken the Castilian throne, thus denying it to Isabella. Thus, no union of Castile and Aragon. Considering that this is the lead-up era to the Hapsburg Empire, that's a potentially huge change right there.\n\nInteresting to see where this goes.\n\nJust a quick thing: you might want to consider your timings.

Alfonso's supporters did actually rebel and declare Alfonso King.\n\nAfter Henry's disastrous reign, Castile was in a pitiful state. Alfonso made reforms, centralizing the kingdom. Alfonso cracked down on crime. The 'La Santa Hermandad'(Holy Brotherhood) was formed to maintain the rule of the law.\n\nTo secure his throne, in 1474, Alfonso XII married Joanna. Alfonso and Joanna had three children; Juan, Prince of Asturias and the Infantas Joanna and Maria. Queen Joanna held little actual power and Alfonso was keen to portray himself as the rightful monarch. Alfonso agreed with Joao II of Portugal that Infanta Joanna would marry Joao's son, Prince Alfonso. In 1492, Joanna was sent to Portugal and married Prince Alfonso. In 1495, Prince Alfonso became Alfonso VI of Portugal. He had a son, Prince Joao, with Joanna. Juan, Prince of Asturias, married Margaret of Austria, daughter of Emperor Maximillian I, in 1497.\n\nWar erupted between Castile and the Moorish remnant of Granada. In 1483, Boabdil took the throne as Muhammad XII and civil war erupted between Muhammad XII and his rival, Al-Zagal. Alfonso XII took Malaga in 1487 and supported Muhammad XII. By 1490, Al-Zagal was defeated. Muhammad XII was secured and accepted Castilian overlordship.\n\nIn 1492, an explorer called Christopher Columbus approached Alfonso. Columbus proposed he sail with an expedition to west to the Indies. Alfonso accepted and Columbus sailed West. He landed on the island of Nueva Castilla[1]. It soon became apparent that Columbus had not landed in the Indies but a whole 'New World'. This 'New World' was called America. An era of Castilian colonisation began.\n\nIn 1504, Isabella, Queen of Aragon, died. Ferdinand remarried to Germaine de Foix, niece of Louis XII of France. However, they failed to have a child. In 1516, Ferdinand died and Juan, Prince of Girona, became King Juan III of Aragon. Juan III married Maria of Castile and they had a son, the future Juan IV of Aragon. Aragon gained Tunis and Oran in North Africa.\n\nIn 1508, Alfonso XII died and Juan, Prince of Asturias, became Juan III of Castile. Castile and the world were entering a new age...\n\n[1]OTL Hispaniola\n\n---------\n\nAny comments?\n\nView attachment 215572\n\nAfter Henry's disastrous reign, Castile was in a pitiful state.

Philip and Margaret produced a son, Charles, in 1498 and then another son, Philip, in 1500. Sadly, the Archduke Charles died in 1501. Margaret suffered a stillbirth and then gave birth to a daughter, Mary, in 1505.\n\nIn 1519, Philip's father, Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian I, died. Philip was elected Emperor Philip II[1]. Archduke Philip married Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, taking the Hungarian throne when his brother-in-law Lajos II died in 1526. The Catholic faith was challenged by the new Protestant movement. At Worms, Martin Luther spoke before the German nobles. Philip let Luther have safe passage but condemned his teachings. Religious war erupted across Germany.\n\nIn northern Italy, the French had a strong presence. Louis XII claimed Milan and occupied it. Pope Julius II formed the Holy League of Venice, Rome, Aragon, Austria and England against the French. The English under King Arthur II defeated the Scots at Flodden. The League collapsed and the French won at Marignano, defeating Massimiliano of Milan. War erupted again in 1521. Francis I of France faced an alliance of Juan III of Aragon, Juan of Castile, Philip II, and Arthur II of England. Francis I routed the Imperial army in 1525 at Pavia, taking Milan. Philip II agreed to peace and recognised Francis' control of Milan.\n\nIn 1535, Philip II died and the Archduke Philip became Emperor Philip III. The Hapsburg domains now extended from Burgundy to Austria, Bohemia and Hungary.\n\n[1]They already had Emperor Philip I, even if he wasn't crowned by the Pope."
