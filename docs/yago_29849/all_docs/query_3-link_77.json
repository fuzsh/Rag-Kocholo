Pág 90\n\nInfanta Beatrice of Portugal (Portuguese pronunciation: [bi%C9%90%CB%88t%C9%BEi%CA%83]; Portuguese: Beatriz) was the daughter of Portuguese King Peter I and a Galician noblewoman called Inês de Castro.\n\nLife\n\nBeatrice was born in Coimbra around the period of 1347–1351. Beatrice's entitlement to be considered an Infanta (Princess) of Portugal is debatable. Some historians consider her a natural daughter of Peter I, so the title Infanta of Portugal could never be attributed to her. Other opinions assert that the death of Inês de Castro was ordered by Peter's father King Afonso IV of Portugal; after inheriting the throne, the Prince admitted that he had married Inês secretly, and she was thus a lawful Queen of Portugal.\n\nBeatrice became Countess of Alburquerque when she married Sancho Alfonso, 1st Count of Alburquerque (1373). They had two children: Don Fernando Sánchez, 2nd Count of Alburquerque, and Doña Eleanor of Alburquerque, who married Ferdinand I of Aragon. She died in 1381. Ancestry\n\nThough having had a daughter from her half brother Fernando I de Portugal, Beatrice married later Sancho Alfonso de Castille, Conde de Albuquerque (son of Alfonso XI, of Castille and Leon) Therefore she is Beatrice of Albuquerque (Beatrice Of Alburquerque (nascida Of Portugal) ), Beatrice Of Portugal (nascida Of Burgundy Iš Portugalijos De Borgoña), Beatriz De Castile (nascida Portugal),Beatriz De Portugal Some information in these entries is not correct, namely her birthplace which was actualy Coimbra"
