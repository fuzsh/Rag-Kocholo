        "text": "Eleanor M. Eggleston, 87, of 14 Maple Street, passed away on Tuesday, April 5, 2011, at her home.. She was born in Malone on Feb. 9, 1924, the daughter of Gilbert L. and Mary Ellen (Steenberge) Crosbie.. Eleanor grew up in Bangor, N.Y., and graduated from Franklin Academy School in Malone, N.Y., in 1942 and married the love of her life, Millard M. Eggleston of Bangor, N.Y., on April 13, 1942. Besides being a devoted housewife and mother of their three children, she also cared for a nephew for several years. Eleanor worked at JC Penney Store, Plattsburgh Paper Mill, Dannemora Dairy and Eggleston Lumber Company.. She was a member of the Dannemora Methodist Church and active member of the local Home Bureau for many years.. Eleanor enjoyed reading, gardening and sewing, especially doll clothes for many little girls in the area, crocheting, knitting, tatting and oil painting. Many of her paintings won blue ribbons at the Clinton County Fair.. Following a massive stroke in 1971 at the age of 47, she was forced to retire from her active life. Although handicapped, she managed to drive her car and continued to be fairly independent. Giving up was never in Eleanor's vocabulary. Having the use of just her left arm, she was noted for making teddy bears. Many homes in the area are blessed with these bears. One of her favorite past times in recent years was working on jigsaw puzzles. It was always amazing how quickly she could complete one.. Her beautiful smile and her bright beautiful blue eyes will always remember Eleanor. She touched many lives and will be deeply missed. She was certainly an inspiration to anyone who knew her. Rest in peace with Millard and your angels, Eleanor. We love you. A special thank you to her caregivers, whom she certainly adored - Brenda, Trasa, Crystal, Jodi, Ashley, Jill and Linda.. Survivors include three children and their spouses, Mary Laura and Pete Barber of Chazy Lake, Daniel and Jo Eggleston of Saranac and Barbara and George Malloy of Albuquerque, N.M.; seven grandchildren and their spouses, Bruce and Sonyo Barber, Amy O'Neill, Perry and Suzanne Barber, all of Dannemora, Todd and Darlene Eggleston of Schuyler Falls, Tracy and Jody Eggleston and Mark Eggleston of Saranac and Jason and Shelley Patnode of Albuquerque, N.M.; five great-grandchildren, Janyll Barber, Josh and Amie Eggleston and Jaselle and Abbey Patnode; four brothers and their spouses, Edward and Maria Crosbie of Indian Lake and Yuma, Ariz., Gilbert Crosbie of Watertown and Russell, N.Y., William and Marlene Crosbie of White Hills, Ariz., John Kingsley and Mert Crosbie of Croghan, N.Y.: a sister-in-law, Judy Eggleston of North Bangor, N.Y.; and several nieces, nephews; and cousins.. Her husband of 67 years, Millard, who passed away April 22, 2009; her parents; one brother, Lloyd Crosbie; and one sister, Betty Thomas; predeceased her; sisters-in-law, Jean Crosbie, Billie Crosbie and Frances Crosbie: her husband's siblings, Frances, Ivan and Loren Eggleston, Lauretta McNierney; and brother-in-law, Jim McNierney.. A funeral service will be held on Saturday, April 9, at 1 p.m. at the Dannemora United Methodist Church. The family will receive guests prior to the service at noon.. Burial will be at a later date in the Saranac Independence Cemetery."
