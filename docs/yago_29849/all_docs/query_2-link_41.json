        "text": "Ferdinand therefore stayed in the Netherlands where his aunt, Margaret of Austria, acted as regent. She was the first member of the Habsburg family to assemble a Renaissance collection of art. Ferdinand's artistic sensibilities were much influenced by the works of painters and sculptors patronised by her - artists from France, Italy, and Germany - as well as by the love of literature and music that prevailed at her court. Here, his tutor was Erasmus of Rotterdam, the tolerant cleric and sceptical humanist."
