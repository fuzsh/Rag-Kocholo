        "text": "Eleanor Jones, 93, beloved Mother, Wife, Daughter, and Grandmother, was called to her heavenly home on Saturday, September 9, 2023.\n\nShe entered this world on February 3, 1930, in Brenham, TX, born to Willie and Mamie Green. She was preceded in death by her parents, Willie and Mamie Green; her husband, Jim Jones; her brothers, Walter and Marcus Green; and sisters, Sherry Green and Dorothy Cook. She is survived by her three children, Wayne (Joani) Jones, Michelle (Celia) Jones, and Bruce Jones; her step-daughter Mary Christian; her four grandchildren, Kimberly Jones, Cody (Ngoc-hoa) Jones, Tyson (Emma) Jones, and Adrienne Jones; three great-grandchildren; her sister, Joy Malry; two nieces; and one nephew.\n\nEleanor received a bachelor's degree from Houston-Tillostson University in Home Economics. She then went on to receive her master's in education from Prairie View A&M. She began her teaching career in Caldwell Texas at Freeman School where she taught second grade during segregation at an all black school for grades one through twelve.\n\nShe moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico with her husband and three children in 1966 where she continued her teaching career in Albuquerque Public Schools until her retirement in 1992. Eleanor was an active member for many decades at Berean Baptist Church in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she sang in the choir. Later she became a member of Fellowship Baptist Church.\n\nEleanor was an amazing, devoted wife, mother, and grandmother. She had a wicked sense of humor, and could always make her family laugh or smile, even on the hardest days. Eleanor was an amazing cook. Her home was always filled with delicious food, and lots of love.\n\nShe was the epitome of class and elegance, with an excellent sense of style. She will be remembered for her strength, faith in the Lord, and deep love for her family. She was a blessing to all who knew her. She will be missed deeply. We will continue on her legacy of faith, devotion to family, and love, with us always.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held on Thursday, September 21, 2023, 10:00 a.m., at FRENCH - University."
