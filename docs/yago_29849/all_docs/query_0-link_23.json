        "text": "Infanta Catherine of Castile (October 5, 1422 – September 17, 1424) was suo jure Princess of Asturias and heiress presumptive to the Castilian throne all her life.\n\nInfanta Catherine was born on October 5, 1422 in Illescas, Toledo. She was the first child of King Juan II of Castile and his first wife, Infanta Maria of Aragon, the daughter of King Fernando I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nKing Juan II of Castile was the son of King Enrique III of Castile and his wife, Catherine of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (son of King Edward III of England) and his second wife, Infanta Constance of Castile the daughter and heir of King Pedro the Cruel of Castile and and María de Padilla.\n\nKing Pedo the Cruel had secretly married María, but was forced to repudiate her. Their relationship endured throughout his subsequent marriages, however. King Pedro was killed in 1369 by his half-brother Infante Enrique of Castile who then ascended the throne as King Enrique II of Castile.\n\nInfanta Constance’s younger sister, Infanta Isabella, married John of Gaunt’s younger brother Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York.\n\nInfanta Catherine of Castile was named after her aunt and grandmother, the Duchess of Villena and Catherine of Lancaster. The Duchess of Villena was Infanta Catherine was the second child born to King Enrique III of Castile and Catherine of Lancaster. In 1418, she was married off to her first cousin and brother-in-law, Infante Enrique of Aragon, Duke of Villena.\n\nThe marriage was a part of an agreement by which Enrique’s older brother King Alfonso V of Aragon married Catherine’s older sister Infanta Maria and by which Enrique’s sister Infanta Maria married Catherine’s brother, King Juan II of Castile.\n\nInfanta Catherine of Castile immediately became heiress presumptive to the throne of Castile upon her birth. The Infanta was formally recognised as successor to the throne of the kingdom and sworn in as Princess of Asturias on January 1, 1423 by the Cortes of Toledo.\n\nHowever, the Princess of Asturias did not live long enough to succeed her father as Queen of Castile. She died in Madrigal de las Altas Torres on September 17, 1424, and is buried in Miraflores Charterhouse, along with her father and stepmother, Infanta Isabella of Portugal.\n\nHer younger sister, Infanta Eleanor, replaced her as heiress and Princess of Asturias. Infanta Catherine, Princess of Asturias, had died seven days after Infanta Eleanor’s first birthday. Thus, the one-year-old infanta became heir presumptive to the throne.\n\nHer father had her recognised as successor to the kingdom and as Princess of Asturias by the Cortes of Valladolid shortly after her sister’s funeral. The new Princess of Asturias received homage in the presence of her father, the King, in City of Burgos."
