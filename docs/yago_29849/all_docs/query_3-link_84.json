        "text": "I didn’t get to spend much time with Aunt Eleanore, but it was fun meeting her almost two decades ago. I lost my wife not long after Aunt Elanore passed, so I know it must be hard having your first Christmas without her. When my father was young, Robert Mattson was a friend of the Groleau family. Of course, neither Robert nor my father knew Eleanore then. My father laughed about how my grandmother thought he was after the girls, so she’d say, “Go home, Bobby,” and then Robert said, “But I got one anyway, didn’t I?”\n\nWesley Groleau\n\nFort Wayne, IN\n\nTo the Family of Eleanor,\n\nOur deepest and sincere sympathy. I was a class mate of Eleanor’s and we both grew up in the Buckeye. She was a great person and I know she will be sadly missed by many. Our prayers are with you all.\n\nJim & Abie LaLonde\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nI attended with mixed emotions but everyone made me feel at ease. I was saddened with Eleanore’s loss but it gives fine closure when we can see the “ole neighborhood gang” and remember the good times. I also got to meet more of her extended family who were so nice & I got to learn more about her life. she was so sincere and friendly and enjoyed life.\n\nGod Bless You Eleanore!\n\nWarren Bovin\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nI did not know my Aunt Eleanore until I was in my mid 20’s (I’m the daughter of Laura Trotter) but boy did we have fun once she became a full member of our family! We had many, many good times each year at the cabins – girls luncheons, potlucks, family games and laughter at the campfire. You will be missed Aunt Eleanore!\n\nPatti Bruinsma\n\nCharlotte, MI\n\nI was so happy to have the chance to get to know my Aunt Eleanore. She made our family complete and we were all so happy that she became a part of all of us. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to visit with her last summer when I was at my Mom’s (Laura Trotter) house. We had such a nice talk. Little did I know that that would be our last one so I am grateful for that little piece of time we shared. She always bragged about her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren to me. She was always interested in my family, as well. I felt that she genuinely cared for all of us even though she hardly knew my own sons. We will all miss her but I am happy that we were able to have the years together with her that we did. It also makes me realize that you have to LIVE every day and give thanks every day for all of our many blessings. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.\n\nGina Mahannah\n\nKalamazoo, MI\n\nSo sorry about Eleanore.She will be miss by the 500 card club at the Gladstone Senior Center. She was a great person and kept everyone in a great humor she was a caring person to all of us. May all your memories give you comfort through this difficult time. She love everyone. All our prayers goes out to all her family. No more suffering. She is in the hands of God now.\n\nJean Lancour\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nDear Butch and family,\n\nYou probably don’t remember me. I met your Mom years ago through one of my best friends, Joetta.\n\nI know I don’t need to tell you what a “special” lady your Mom was. Always a huge smile and hug when I would see her. I loved when we would visit with her and Bob……..so many laughs and good times. May God bless you at this time. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.\n\nGaynell (Lundin) Salewski\n\nGreen Bay, WI\n\nSo sorry to hear of the loss of your wonderful mother. I am the daughter of Eleanore’s brother, Richard, and he has so enjoyed getting to know her. She has been a blessing and a gift to all who knew her.\n\nYvonne Groleau Tillapaugh\n\nLakewood, CO\n\nYou will be deeply missed, it was such an honor knowing you. My condolances to Bob and the rest of the family.\n\nJake Nyquist\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nRoy and Glenna, Great memories of your mom and Bob, we laughed so much. We attended Bethel Free Church together and so many good memories throughout the years. Our prayers are with your family and with Bob. Judy and Bill Krieg\n\nJudy and Bill Krieg\n\nQuinnesec, MI\n\nButch & family, So sorry to hear of your Mom’s passing. What a wonderful gal she always was & a joy to be in her company. God Bless you & give you strength at this time & in the days to come.\n\nPaul Fredrickson\n\nAlbuquerque, NM\n\nMy deepest sympathy. She will be greatly missed.\n\nNorma\n\nNorma Semashko\n\nMarquette, MI\n\nButch,& Glenna\n\nI want you to know how much Elenor ment to me. She was such a joy to have at the concession stand, she had more energy than most of us. Her humor was fantastic. I have to tell you a story about her when we would get busy with making the hot choc., she would always say “Hea why don’t you go to Mc’Donalds”. we laughed together so much, she bragged about her family all the time and always asked everyone how their family was. I sure will miss her. God Bless Pete and Bonnie DeMay\n\nBonnie DeMay\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nWhere to start? What a ray of sunshine, and always such a caring heart. Always asking how all my family was doing and giving warm hugs when needed and “I Love You guys” at the end of every encounter! You will be truly missed, by Matt, myself and Ian, and the whole “Braves community”…We Love You!\n\nP.S. Matt says “Nobody could serve a better pretzel, hotdog or popcorn, with such a great smile than her!”\n\nSalli & Matt Houle\n\nGladstone, MI\n\nI’ll long remember my last two visits with Eleanore. I read Psalm 39 at her request, with it’s reminder of how fleeting life is. It was hard for me to read given her circumstances. But she was trusting in her Savior and is now resting in his care.\n\nDavid Henry\n\nRochester, MN\n\nI didn’t get to spend much time with Aunt Eleanore, but it was fun meeting her almost two decades ago.
