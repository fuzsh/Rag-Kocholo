        "text": "Albrecht IV (December 15, 1447 – March 18, 1508) was duke of Bavaria-Munich from 1467, and Duke of the reunited Bavaria from 1503.\n\nAlbrecht was a son of Albrecht III, Duke of Bavaria and Anna of Brunswick-Grubenhagen-Einbeck, a daughter of Duke Eric I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife, Elisabeth of Brunswick-Göttingen.\n\nAlbrecht IV was born in Munich. After the death of his older brother Johann IV, Duke of Bavaria he gave up his spiritual career and returned from Pavia to Munich.\n\nWhen his brothers Christoph and Wolfgang had resigned Albrecht became sole duke, but a new duchy Bavaria-Dachau was created from Bavaria-Munich for his brother Duke Sigismund in 1467. After Sigismund’s death in 1501, it reverted to Bavaria-Munich.\n\nThe marriage of Archduchess Kunigunde of Austria to Albrecht IV was a result of intrigues and deception, but must be counted as a defeat for Emperor Friedrich III.\n\nAlbrecht illegally took control of some imperial fiefs and then asked to marry Archduchess Kunigunde (who lived in Innsbruck, far from her father), offering to give her the fiefs as a dowry.\n\nThe Emperor Friedrich III agreed at first, but after Albrecht took over yet another fief, Regensburg, Emperor Friedrich III withdrew his consent. On January 3, 1487, however, before the Emperor’s change of heart could be communicated to his daughter, Archduchess Kunigunde married Albrecht.\n\nArchduchess Kunigunde’s mother was Infanta Eleanor of Portugal (1434 –1467) daughter of King Duarte of Portugal and his wife Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, the daughter of King Fernando I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nInfanta Eleanor of Portugal was the consort of Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III and the mother of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Archduchess Kunigunde of Austria.\n\nA war was prevented between Duke Albrecht IV and Emperor Friedrich III was only avoided by intermediation by the Emperor’s son, Archduke Maximilian I.\n\nFor Albrecht’s wedding, Grünwald Castle was extended in 1486/87 under the direction of Jörg von Weikertshausen.\n\nIn 1491–1492, Duke Albrecht IV fought the rebellious Löwlerbund. Duke Albrecht IV finally decided to return territorial acquisitions in Swabia in 1492 to avoid a war with the Habsburg and the Swabian League.\n\nDuke Albrecht IV then also had to release Regensburg, which had been reunited with Bavaria in 1486, and had to reluctantly renounce Further Austria when Archduke Sigismund of Austria tried to make it over to Albrecht.\n\nAfter the death of the last duke of Bavaria-Landshut, Georg in 1503, Albrecht managed to reunite the whole of Bavaria in a dreadful war against Georg’s heirs, the Palatinate line of his Wittelsbach family but had to transfer the most southern districts of Bavaria-Landshut to his brother-in-law Emperor Maximilian as compensation for his support.\n\nKufstein, Kitzbühel and Rattenberg passed to Maximilian in 1506 and were united with Tyrol. For the Palatinate branch a new duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg was created.\n\nTo avoid any future division of Bavaria, Albrecht decreed the everlasting succession of the firstborn prince in 1506. Nevertheless, his oldest son and successor Wilhelm IV, Duke of Bavaria had to share his power from 1516 onwards with his younger brother Ludwig X, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nAfter the death of Ludwig X in 1545, the edict became effective until the end of Bavarian monarchy in 1918.\n\nDuke Albrecht IV is buried in the Frauenkirche in Munich.\n\nFriedrich III (September 21, 1415 – August 19, 1493) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death. He was the fourth king and first Emperor of the House of Habsburg. He was the penultimate Emperor to be crowned by the pope, and the last to be crowned in Rome.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn at the Tyrolean residence of Innsbruck in 1415, Friedrich III was the eldest son of the Inner Austrian Duke, Ernst the Iron, a member of the Leopoldian line of the Habsburg dynasty, and his second wife Cymburgis of Masovia.\n\nAccording to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, the Leopoldinian branch ruled over the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or what was referred to as Inner Austria. Only three of Friedrich’s eight siblings survived childhood: his younger brother Albrecht (later to be Albrecht VI, Archduke of Austria), and his sisters Margaret (later the Electress of Saxony as the wife of Prince-Elector Friedrich II of Saxony) and Catherine. In 1424, nine-year-old Friedrich’s father died, making Friedrich the Duke of Inner Austria, as Duke Friedrich V, with his uncle, Duke Friedrich IV of Tyrol, acting as regent.\n\nFrom 1431, Friedrich tried to obtain majority (to be declared “of age”, and thus allowed to rule) but for several years was denied by his relatives. Finally, in 1435, Albrecht V, Duke of Austria (later Albrecht II, King of Germany), awarded him the rule over his Inner Austrian heritage. As he unified Austria he and officially adopted the Archducal title and Austria was raised to an Archduchy.\n\nAs a cousin of late King Albrecht II of Germany/the Romans, Friedrich of Austria became a candidate for the 1440 imperial election. On February 2, 1440, the Prince-Electors convened at Frankfurt and unanimously elected him King of the Romans as Friedrich IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or Inner Austria.\n\nAs Emperor, Friedrich was known as Emperor Friedrich III. However, as King of Germany/King of the Romans he was known as King Friedrich IV until his Papal coronation. King Friedrich III of Germany/the Romans was actually Prince Friedrich the Fair (c. 1289 – January 13, 1330), also from the House of Habsburg, who was the Duke of Austria and Styria from 1308 as well as the anti-King of Germany from 1314 and then co-King of Germany along with his cousin Emperor Ludwig IV from 1325 until his death in 1330. Emperor Ludwig IV was King of Germany since 1314 and Emperor from 1328 until his death in 1347.\n\nLudwig IV’s election as King of Germany in 1314 was controversial, as his Habsburg cousin Friedrich the Fair was simultaneously elected king by a separate set of electors. Ludwig defeated Friedrich III the Fair in the Battle of Mühldorf in 1322, and the two eventually reconciled.\n\nIn 1452, at the age of 37, Friedrich IV of Germany travelled to Italy to receive his bride and to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. His fiancée was the 17-year-old infanta Eleanor of Portugal, the daughter of King Duarte of Portugal and his wife Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, the daughter of King Fernando I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nArrangements were made by Eleanor’s maternal uncle Alfonso V, King of Aragon and Naples, who, in 1448, sent artists from his court to paint Eleanor. Eleanor was also suggested as a marriage partner for Louis, Dauphin of France, the eldest son of King Charles VII, but she herself preferred to marry Friedrich because a match with him would give her the title of Empress instead of Queen.\n\nInfanta Eleanor of Portugal landed at Livorno (Leghorn) after a 104-day trip. Her dowry would help Friedrich alleviate his debts and cement his power. The couple met at Siena on February 24 and proceeded together to Rome. As per tradition, they spent a night outside the walls of Rome before entering the city on 9 March, where Friedrich and Pope Nicholas V exchanged friendly greetings.\n\nBecause the Emperor had been unable to retrieve the Iron Crown of Lombardy from the cathedral of Monza where it was kept, nor be crowned King of Italy by the archbishop of Milan (on account of Friedrich’s dispute with Francesco Sforza, lord of Milan), he convinced the pope to crown him as such with the German crown, which had been brought for the purpose.\n\nThis coronation took place on the morning of March 19, in spite of the protests of the Milanese ambassadors, and in the afternoon King Friedrich IV of Germany, now Emperor Friedrich III, was crowned with the Imperial Crown by Pope Nicholas V. Emperor Friedrich III and Infanta Eleanor were married by Pope Nicholas V.\n\nThe Imperial couple were anointed in St Peter’s Basilica by the Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Francesco Condulmer. Emperor Friedrich III was the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned in Rome. His great-grandson Emperor Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned, but this was done in Bologna.\n\nEleanor and Friedrich were dissimilar and never happy. She was an ambitious and willful woman who frequently participated in intrigues, whereas the emperor was a sober and uninspiring man. Her interest in dancing, gambling and hunting was not shared by Friedrich, and their relationship was affected by their differences.\n\nDuring his reign, Emperor Friedrich III concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg “hereditary lands” of Austria and took a lesser interest in Imperial affairs. Nevertheless, by his dynastic entitlement to Hungary as well as by the Burgundian inheritance, he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire. Despite being mocked as “Arch-Sleepyhead of the Holy Roman Empire” during his lifetime, he is today increasingly seen as an effective ruler.\n\nHistorian Thomas A. Brady Jr. credited Friedrich III with leaving a credible claim on the imperial title and a secure grip on the Austrian lands, now organized as a single state, for his son. This imperial revival (as well as the rise of the territorial state) began under the reign of Friedrich.\n\nHis reign of 53 years is the longest in the history of the Holy Roman Empire or the German monarchy. Upon his death in 1493 he was succeeded by his son as Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nMaximilian I (March 22, 1459 – January 12, 1519) was King of the Romans from 1486 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1508 until his death.\n\nArchduke Maximilian of Austria was born at Wiener Neustadt on March 22, 1459, the only surviving son of Friedrich III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Infanta Eleanor of Portugal, daughter of King Duarte of Portugal and his wife Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Fernando I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nHis father named him for an obscure saint, Maximilian of Tebessa, who Friedrich believed had once warned him of imminent peril in a dream.\n\nHabsburg Rivalries\n\nIn his childhood Maximilian and his parents were besieged in Vienna by Archduke Albrecht VI of Austria, younger brother of Emperor Friedrich III. As a scion of the Leopoldian line, Archduke Albrecht VI ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola from 1424, from 1457 also over the entire Archduchy of Austria until his death, rivalling with his elder brother Emperor Frederick III.\n\nIn 1439 both Duke Friedrich IV of Further Austria and King Albrecht II of Germany (King of the Romans) Duke of Austria died. As heir of Inner Austria and regent of Further Austria, Tyrol and the Austria proper, Albrecht VI then ruled over all the dynasty’s hereditary lands. At that stage, Albrecht began quarreling with his brother Emperor Friedrich III (then known as Duke Friedrich V) and in 1446 claimed the lands of Further Austria from him.\n\nThe conflict between the brothers escalated when Duke Ladislaus Posthumous of Austria died childless in 1457 and Emperor Friedrich III, came into his inheritance. Albrecht VI rose up and in 1458 occupied the western part of the Austrian archduchy “above the Enns” (later known as Upper Austria), which he ruled at Linz as a separate principality (Fürstentum Österreich ob der Enns) and, quite small, his portion of Habsburg patrimony.\n\nAfter laying siege to Friedrich in the Vienna Hofburg, he also took over the reign of Austria below the Enns (now Lower Austria) in 1462. Albrecht VI however died childless the next year and all his lands fell back to his elder brother.\n\nOne source relates that, during the siege’s bleakest days, the young prince Maximilian wandered about the castle garrison, begging the servants and men-at-arms for bits of bread.\n\nFather and Mother\n\nMaximilian’s father was elected and crowned King of the Romans in 1440. In 1452, at the age of 37, King Friedrich III travelled to Italy to receive his bride and to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Friedrich III’s reign of 53 years is the longest in the history of the Holy Roman Empire or the German monarchy.\n\nMaximilian was the favourite child of his mother, whose personality was a contrast to his father (although there seemed to be communication problems between mother and son, as she spoke Portuguese). Reportedly she told Maximilian that, “If I had known, my son, that you would become like your father, I would have regretted having born you for the throne.” Her early death pushed him even more towards a man’s world, where one grew up first as a warrior rather than a politician.\n\nFirst Marriage\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was the chief political opponent of Maximilian’s father. Emperor Friedrich III was concerned about Burgundy’s expansionist tendencies on the western border of his Holy Roman Empire, and, to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles’ only daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to his son Maximilian. After the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), he was successful. The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on August 19, 1477.\n\nPerhaps as preparation for his task in the Netherlands, in 1476, at the age of 17, in the name of his father, apparently Maximilian commanded a military campaign against Hungary – the first actual battlefield experience in his life (command responsibility was likely shared with more experienced generals though).\n\nMaximilian was elected King of the Romans on February 16, 1486 in Frankfurt-am-Main at his father’s initiative and crowned on April 9, 1486 in Aachen. Much of the Austrian territories and Vienna were under the rule of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, as a result of the Austrian–Hungarian War (1477–1488). Since his coronation as King of the Romans he ran a double government, or Doppelregierung (with a separate court), with his father until Friedrich’s death in 1493.\n\nMaximilian was now a king without lands. Matthias Corvinus offered Emperor Friedrich and his son Archduke Maximilian, the return of Austrian provinces and Vienna, if they would renounce the treaty of 1463 and accept Matthias as Friedrich’s designated heir and favoured successor as Holy Roman Emperor. Before this was settled though, Matthias died in Vienna in 1490. However, after Matthias Corvinus died from a stroke on April 9, 1490, civil war broke out in Hungary between the supporters of John Corvinus and the supporters of king Vladislaus of Bohemia.\n\nEmperor\n\nUpon Emperor Friedrich III’s death in 1493 he was succeeded by his son Maximilian who was never crowned by the Pope, as the journey to Rome was blocked by the Venetians. He proclaimed himself Elected Emperor in 1508 (Pope Julius II later recognized this) at Trent, thus breaking the long tradition of requiring a papal coronation for the adoption of the Imperial title.\n\nMaximilian expanded the influence of the House of Habsburg through war and his marriage in 1477 to Mary of Burgundy, the ruler of the Burgundian State, heir of Charles the Bold, though he also lost his family’s original lands in today’s Switzerland to the Swiss Confederacy.\n\nMaximilian’s wife had inherited the large Burgundian domains in France and the Low Countries upon her father’s death in the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy was also claimed by the French crown under Salic law, with King Louis XI of France vigorously asserting his claim through military force. Maximilian at once undertook the defence of his wife’s dominions. Without support from the Empire and with an empty treasury left by Charles the Bold’s campaigns (Mary had to pawn her jewels to obtain loans), he carried out a campaign against the French during 1478–1479 and reconquered Le Quesnoy, Conde and Antoing. He defeated the French forces at the Battle of Guinegate, in modern Enguinegatte, on August 7, 1479.\n\nHis son, Philipp the Handsome of Austria, was ruler of the Burgundian Netherlands and titular Duke of Burgundy from 1482 to 1506. Through Philipp’s marriage to eventual Queen Joanna of Castile in 1496, he was the first Habsburg King of Castile (as Felipe I) for a brief time in 1506.\n\nThis helped Maximilian to establish the Habsburg dynasty in Spain, which allowed his grandson Charles of Burgundy to hold the thrones of both Castile and Aragon as King Carlos I of a united Spain.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe historian Thomas A. Brady Jr. describes Emperor Maximilian I as “the first Holy Roman Emperor in 250 years who ruled as well as reigned” and also, the “ablest royal warlord of his generation.”\n\nAccording to historian Joachim Whaley, if Maximilian ever saw the Empire as a source of income and soldiers only, he failed miserably in extracting both. His hereditary lands and other sources always contributed much more. On the other hand, the attempts he demonstrated in building the imperial system alone shows that he did consider the German lands “a real sphere of government in which aspirations to royal rule were actively and purposefully pursued.”\n\nWhaley notes that, despite struggles, what emerged at the end of Maximilian’s rule was a strengthened monarchy and not an oligarchy of princes. If he was usually weak when trying to act as a monarch and using imperial instituations like the Reichstag, Maximilian’s position was often strong when acting as a neutral overlord and relying on regional leagues of weaker principalities such as the Swabian league, as shown in his ability to call on money and soldiers to mediate the Bavaria dispute in 1504, after which he gained significant territories in Alsace, Swabia and Tyrol. His fiscal reform in his hereditary lands provided a model for other German princes.\n\nWhen Maximilian I died on January 12, 1519 he was succeeded by his grandson, Charles, who became one of Europe’s most powerful Emperors who had inherited a greatly expanded Habsburg empire.\n\nCharles V (February 24, 1500 – September 21, 1558) was Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria from 1519 to 1556, King of Spain (Castile and Aragon) from 1515 to 1555, as King Carlos I, and Lord of the Netherlands as titular Duke of Burgundy from 1506 to 1555. Charles V was head of the rising House of Habsburg during the first half of the 16th century. His dominions in Europe included the Holy Roman Empire, extending from Germany to northern Italy with direct rule over the Austrian hereditary lands and the Burgundian Low Countries, and Spain with its possessions of the southern Italian kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and Sardinia."
