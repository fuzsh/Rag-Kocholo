He was the son of John I of Portugal and his wife, Philippa of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt. His was named in honor of his great-grandfather, King Edward III of England.\n\nAs an infante, Duarte always followed his father, King João I, in the affairs of the kingdom. He was knighted in 1415, after the Portuguese capture of the city of Ceuta in North Africa, across from Gibraltar. He became king in 1433 when his father died of the plague and he soon showed interest in internal consensus. During his short reign of five years, Duarte called the Cortes (the national assembly) no less than five times to discuss internal affairs and politics. He also followed the politics of his father concerning the maritime exploration of Africa. He encouraged and financed his famous brother, Henry the Navigator who founded a \"school\" of maritime navigation at Sagres and who initiated many expeditions. Among these, that of Gil Eanes in 1434 first rounded Cape Bojador on the northwestern coast of Africa, leading the way for further exploration southward along the African coast.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nEleanor of Aragon (c. 1402 - February 19, 1445) was the daughter of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque.\n\nShe married Duarte (Edward), King of Portugal on September 22, 1428. They had nine children, of which five survived to adulthood.\n\nWhen her husband died in September 13, 1438, she was appointed as regent of Portugal in his will. However, she was inexperienced and, as an Aragonese, unpopular with the people, who preferred the late king's brother Pedro, Duke of Coimbra. Negotiations for a compromise arrangement were drawn out over several months, but were complicated by the interference of the Count of Barcelos and the Archbishop of Lisbon\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here."
