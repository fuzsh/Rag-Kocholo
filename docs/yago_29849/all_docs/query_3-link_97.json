A special witness is brought to WITSEC - a woman from Latin America named Francesca Leandra, who barely escaped assassination in her home country because of her political activities. The State Department asks that WITSEC assign Mary to her full time, and Mary initially likes staying in the palatial home the government has found for her. But Francesca rebels against the opulent surroundings, and insists upon relocation to the most crime-ridden part of Albuquerque. This leads to a series of confrontations with the gang members in that part of town - and eventually, to Mary getting shot while trying to protect Francesca.",
