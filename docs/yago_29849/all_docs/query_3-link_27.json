        "text": "Eleanor Yvonne Bonnell was born to Ralph and Jewell Bonnell in Glencoe, New Mexico on July 5, 1927. She passed away on May 1, 2024 just shy of 97 yrs old.\n\nShe was a descendant of a large pioneer family. Her three great-grandfathers, George Coe, Frank Coe and Edwin Bonnell came to Lincoln County to homestead in the 1880s. George and Frank Coe rode with the Regulators during the Lincoln County War, and Edwin Bonnell built the mercantile, lumber yard and opera house in White Oaks. She grew up on the Bonnell Guest Ranch in Glencoe, NM, and had the opportunity to meet guests from New York City to Hollywood, CA. Many of them became like family returning year after year. The Coe’s and Bonnell’s were a musical family who entertained the guests at Bonnell Ranch, as well as hosting square dances for friends and family. Eleanor’s grandmother, Sydney Bonnell, taught her to play the piano and music was a large part of her life, including pianist for her high school orchestra and organist for two Episcopal Churches and private occasions.\n\nShe graduated from Capitan High School since there was no high school in Ruidoso. It was a daily 100- mile round trip from Glencoe to Capitan on the school bus. She graduated Valedictorian with a scholarship to the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and then she transferred to New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.\n\nEleanor married Morris (Mac) McClendon in May 1948, and they had two daughters, Linda and Bonnie. She often said they were the best thing she ever did in her lifetime. In 1978, she married NMSP Lieutenant Kenneth Shockey, a 52-year old bachelor, and they were married for 31 years before Ken passed away in 2009.\n\nEleanor managed the Mescalero Apache Loan Office for Rita and Wendell Chino, and said meeting many of the Apache members was one of her greatest experiences and she treasured their knowledge and friendship , She worked at two local banks in Ruidoso, and then obtained her Real Estate license. After Ken retired, they split their time between Ruidoso and El Paso when Ken was Chief of Security for Ruidoso-Sunland Race Tracks.\n\nAfter Ken’s death, she moved to Chandler, Arizona to live with Bonnie and family. She enjoyed many family events. She became “Mema” to many families bringing brownies and cookies to the baseball games while watching grandson, Trent, and great-grandson, Hunter play.\n\nShe was a life-long Episcopalian. Her grandparents, Bert & Sydney Bonnell donated the land for St Anne’s Episcopal church built in 1932 across from Bonnell Ranch, which is still used for services. Eleanor was a Sun Princess for the UTEP Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, a 60-yr member of Beta Sigma Phi International Sorority, and for a short time had her pilot’s license. One of her favorite pastimes was cooking and baking pound cake to give to friends and clients of hers and Bonnie’s. Most recently, she spent her time reading, scrolling through Facebook, texting family and friends, and playing Wordle and Solitary on her iPad.\n\nShe is survived by daughters, Linda (Steve) Mallett of Casa Grande, Az and Bonnie (Craig) Bowden of Chandler, AZ, plus 7 grandchildren, Tisha (Russ) Sopha, Kristy (Randy) Stephens, Mandy (Mike) Hank, Jordan (Matt) Mesaros, Lindsay (Erik) Marsh, Cadyn Bowden and Trenten Bowden; 11 Great-Grandchildren, Colton (Kayla) Sopha, Cassity (Jake) Sopha, Garrett (Tyler) Stephens, Carson Stephens, Kaitlyn Stephens, Pierce Stephens, Reagan Hank, Hunter Hank, Scott Marsh, Travis Marsh and Tyler Marsh, and 1 great-great-granddaughter, Brynleigh Sopha, many nieces, nephews, and cousins. She is preceded in death by her parents, her sister, Irene Nosker, and brothers David Bonnell and Harvey Bonnell. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the Lincoln County Humane Society or St. Jude’s Childrens Hospital.\n\nA Celebration of Life is planned for June 15, 2024 at 2:00pm at LaGrone Funeral Chapel of Ruidoso in, New Mexico with burial at the Frank Coe Cemetery in Glencoe, NM following the memorial."
