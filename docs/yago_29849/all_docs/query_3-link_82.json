        "text": "Eleanor Glade Eastman Oltman passed away at Preferred Senior Living of Ellsworth (WI) on November 9, 2020. Born February 21, 1917 in Vermillion, SD, to Verne Everett and Avery Glade Kosier Eastman, she grew up in Wausau, WI and graduated from Wausau High School in 1934. Following graduation from the University of Wisconsin – Madison, she moved to Ellsworth, Wisconsin where she taught high school English and speech.\n\nOn June 21, 1941 Eleanor married Ralph Erwin Oltman. During World War II, she worked in the civilian service offices of the airfields where Ralph was stationed in Albuquerque, NM and Victorville, CA. After the war they returned to Ellsworth where Ralph operated the Ford agency, Oltman Motor Sales. They celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary together in 2011.\n\nEleanor was involved in many local civic organizations and was a substitute teacher in the Ellsworth Public Schools. In 1970 she organized the ecumenical Bible study at the Ellsworth Senior Center and continued leading it for 40 years.\n\nShe was dedicated to the work of the First Presbyterian Church in Ellsworth, volunteering in the Sunday school, youth groups, vacation Bible school, summer camps, women’s groups, and choir. She was also extensively involved in the committees of the Twin Cities Area Presbytery and the Synod of Lakes and Prairies. In retirement, Eleanor and Ralph were Mission Volunteers for the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. for 20 years, serving at ethnically diverse residential schools around the country.\n\nHer love of travel led her to Great Britain, France, Germany, Scandinavia, Israel, Greece, Russia, India, China, South Korea, and Indonesia. She enjoyed sharing her experiences with churches and schools around the country.\n\nEleanor was preceded in death by her husband; her parents; brother Everett Eastman and wife, Eloise; brother Harold Eastman and wife, Dorothy; brother-in-law John Oltman and wife, Gladys; sister-in-law Marcella Landis and husband, James; and son-in-law, David Van Douglas. She is survived by daughters Glade (Liz) Parent and her husband, Wallace Parent; and Deborah Douglas and her husband, Ramon Aldag. Also surviving are grandsons David Parent and wife, Jana; Drew Douglas and wife, Shahree; and Wyn Douglas; great grandchildren, Andrew, Madelyn, Nathan, and Rachel Parent, Anthony Fazzari, and Miles and Zora Douglas; nieces, nephews, their children and grandchildren.\n\nThe family extends their sincere appreciation to all the staff at Preferred Senior Living and St. Croix Hospice for their care, compassion and friendship shown toward Eleanor. They are also grateful to the individual homecare providers, her dear friends, who enabled her to stay in her home for so many years.\n\nDue to COVID19 restrictions, there will be no visitation or memorial service. In lieu of cards or flowers, gifts in Eleanor’s name may be made to the Compassion, Peace and Justice Fund of the Presbyterian Church, USA, http://pma.pcusa.org/donate/make-a-gift/gift-info/E052168/, the Angel Tree Prison Fellowship, https://www.prisonfellowship.org/about/angel-tree, or the charity of choice."
