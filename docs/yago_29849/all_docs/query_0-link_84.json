        "text": "Ferdinand II (KING OF LEON) was born in 1137. He died on 22 January 1188 at the age of 51. Parents: Alfonso VII (the Emperor) RAIMUNDEZ (Count of Castile) and Berenguela BERENGAR of Barcelona.\n\nSpouse: Urraca of Portugal .

Ferdinand III permanently united the Kingdom of Castile with the Kingdom of Leon. His mother, Berenguela of Castile, was the sister of King Henry I of Castile. When Henry I died in 1217, the right of succession fell to Berenguela. She, however, renounced that right in favor of her son, Ferdinand. Thus, Ferdinand III became King of Castile in 1217 and upon the death of his own father in 1230 became King of Leon. Despite much opposition, he proceeded to unite the two Kingdoms into one, which became known as the Kingdom of Castile and Leon. Ferdinand III heeded his mother's advice and married Beatrice, a most virtuous princesses of that time. Their marriage produced six princes and one princess.\n\nFerdinand III was responsible for almost completing the reconquest of Spain, having reclaimed vast amounts of territory from the Moors. He captured Cordoba in 1236, occupied Murcia in 1243, took Jaen in 1246, captured Seville in 1248, and reduced the Kingdom of Granada to a vassal state. He reestablished Catholic worship everywhere and built churches and founded monasteries. He converted the great mosques of Cordoba and Seville into cathedrals, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and founded the University of Salamanca. The Catholic Encyclopedia has this to say about Ferdinand III and his conduct during the military campaigns: \"He watched over the conduct of his soldiers, confiding more in their virtue than in their valor, fasted strictly himself, wore a rough hairshirt, and often spent his nights in prayer, especially before battles. Amid the tumult of the camp he lived like a religious in the cloister. The glory of the Church and the happiness of his people were the two guiding motives of his life\".\n\nAfter his reign, all that remained for the complete reconquest of Spain was the defeat of Granada. He was planning an expedition to Morocco when he died in 1252 and was buried in the cathedral at Seville, clothed as he had requested in the habit of the Third Order of St. Francis. Many miracles took place at his tomb and his body reportedly remains incorrupt. He was canonized in 1671; his feast day is May 30. Ferdinand III was succeeded as King by his son, Alfonso X.

Also known as Enrique (or Henry) of Trastamara, he was the illegitimate son of King Alfonso XI, who was succeeded after he died in 1350 by his legitimate son, Peter the Cruel. Henry II took part in several revolts against his half-brother, but they were all unsuccessful. Henry II sought help from Du Guesclin and Peter IV of Aragon and finally succeeded in removing Peter the Cruel from the throne in 1366. Peter the Cruel responded by forming an alliance with England and, with the aid of Edward the Black Prince, defeated Henry II in battle at Najera in 1367. However, Edward the Black Prince had to depart to participate in the French campaign and, after he departed, Henry II attacked and killed Peter the Cruel in battle at Montiel in 1369. Henry II was able to retain the throne despite opposition from King Ferdinand I of Portugal and John of Gaunt. John of Gaunt was the brother of Edward the Black Prince and, in 1371, married Constance of Castile, the daughter of Peter the Cruel (perhaps marriage was the price Constance paid for the help of John of Gaunt, who undoubtedly used it make his own claim to Castile).

Also known as the \"Peacemaker\", she was named after her great-aunt, Elizabeth of Hungary. She was educated and lived very piously, and was married at a young age. Her husband's court was very corrupt, but Elizabeth did her best to win her husband's affections, while still pursuing her religious beliefs, being especially devoted to the poor and sick. Elizabeth finally, through prayer and unfailing sweetness, succeeded in reforming her husband, but by then he was late in life. Their son, Alfonso, so resented the favors the King showed to his illegitimate sons that, in 1323, he declared war against his father. Elizabeth rode between the two opposing armies and succeeded in reconciling her husband and son. After her husband died in 1325, she retired to a convent of Poor Clares which she had founded at Coimbra. She took the Franciscan Tertiary habit, devoting the rest of her life to the poor and sick. However, she had to act as peacemaker once more when, in 1336, her son Alfonso IV, the new King of Portugal, marched against the King of Castile, to whom he had married his daughter Maria, and who had neglected and mis-treated her. She went to Estremoz where the two opposing armies were fighting, stopped the fighting and arranged a peace between the two kingdoms.

Charles escaped to Italy leaving his father John II to rule Navarre.\n\nHe succeeded his brother Alfonso V in 1458 and became King of Aragon and Sicily, and ruled Catalonia as the Count of Barcelona. An uprising in Catalonia in 1461 forced John II to recognize Charles as his heir; however, Charles died that very same year.

In 1472, John II succeeded in pacifying and reclaiming Catalonia.\n\nIn 1468, John II passed the Kingdom of Sicily to his son Ferdinand II.

His wife's holdings made him one of the wealthiest men in England, and enabled him to become one of England's most influential nobles. He served under his brother, Edward the Black Prince, in the Hundred Years War and in the campaign of help Peter the Cruel of Castile in 1367.\n\nAfter his first wife died, John of Gaunt, married Constance of Castile, the daughter of Peter the Cruel, in 1371. Peter the Cruel had been killed by his half-brother, Henry II, in 1369. Through his marriage to Constance, John of Gaunt was able to make a claim to the throne of Castile. His brother, Edward the Black Prince, fell ill during the French campaign of 1370-71 and John of Gaunt left to take chief command, but accomplished little in that campaign. After a truce was called in 1375, John of Gaunt returned to England and allied himself with the corrupt court party led by Alice Perrers, the mistress of his aging father, Edward III. In effect, John of Gaunt actually ruled England for a short time, but his party was removed from power by the Good Parliament in 1376. He soon restored his power and influence and became one of the most powerful men in the goverment, devoting himself primarily to military matters.\n\nIn 1386, he allied himself with the King of Portugal, John I, who had married one of John of Gaunt's daughters, and led an expedition against John I of Castile in an attempt to make good his claim to the Castilian throne. His expediition was unsuccessful, but John of Gaunt and John I of Castile reached a truce in 1388 by agreeing to the marriage of John of Gaunt's daughter, Catherine, with Henry III, the 9-year old son of John I of Castile.\n\nJohn of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 where he was made Duke of Aquitaine.

Juana was widely believed to have been fathered by Beltran de la Cueva, the court favorite. For that reason, she was usually referred to as Juana la Beltraneja. The Cortes of Castile, however, recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the throne. Castilian nobles, however, refused to recognize Juana as the rightful heiress and forced Henry IV to designate his half-brother, Alfonso, as his successor. Alfonso died in 1468 and Henry IV then designated his half-sister Isabella to be his successor. When Isabella married Ferdinand II of Aragon, Henry IV changed his mind and in 1470 again recognized Juana as his heir. However, when Henry IV died in 1474, Isabella took the opportunity to seize the throne. Juana had her own supporters and they arranged for her marriage to Alfonso V of Portugal, and thus obtained his help to try to regain the throne. Isabella defeated Alfonso V in a battle at Toro in 1476, ending the threat to her rule. Isabella received recognition as Queen of Castille in 1479. And, Juana retired to a convent in Portugal.
