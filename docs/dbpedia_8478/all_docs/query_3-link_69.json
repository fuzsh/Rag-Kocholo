        "meta_description": "The 18th century saw the gradual development of Romanticism and the Gothic horror genre. It drew on the written and material heritage of the Late Middle Ages, finding its form with Horace Walpole's seminal and controversial 1764 novel, The Castle of Otranto. In fact, the first edition was published",

        "text": "The old \"fight or flight\" reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human. Our ancestors lived and died by it. Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization, and things began to calm down. Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands. War, crime, and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other, but by and large daily life calmed down. We began to feel restless, to feel something missing: the excitement of living on the edge, the tension between hunter and hunted. So we told each other stories through the long, dark nights. when the fires burned low, we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other. The rush of adrenaline feels good. Our hearts pound, our breath quickens, and we can imagine ourselves on the edge. Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror. Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust, but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency. It makes us think, forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore, and challenges preconceptions of all kinds. Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems, which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand.[37]\n\nThis genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres and may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction.[2] Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies action film as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all feature-length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other eleven super-genres are crime, fantasy, horror, romance, science fiction, slice of life, sports, thriller, war, western and vigilante.[3]\n\nSome historians consider The Great Train Robbery (1903) to be the first action film.[4][5] During the 1920s and 1930s, action-based films were often swashbuckling adventure films, in which actors such as Douglas Fairbanks wielded swords in period pieces or Westerns. Indian action films in this era were known as stunt films.[6]\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s saw \"action\" in a new form, through war and cowboy movies. Alfred Hitchcock ushered in the spy-adventure genre while also establishing the use of action-oriented \"set pieces\" like the famous crop-duster scene and the Mount Rushmore finale in North by Northwest (1959). The film, along with the war-adventure The Guns of Navarone (1961), inspired producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to invest in their own spy-adventure in the James Bond series, based on the novels of Ian Fleming.\n\nFilms that combine the intensity of a horror film with the fighting or brutality of an action film, often by showing human protagonists fighting against deadly supernatural creatures. Examples include the Predator and Resident Evil film series, and various zombie films.[41]\n\nWhile Keanu Reeves and Harrison Ford both had major roles in science fiction action films (The Matrix and Blade Runner, respectively), they later branched out into a number of other action sub-genres, such as action-adventure films.American actor Matt Damon, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his sensitive portrayal of a math genius working as a janitor in Good Will Hunting, later morphed into an action hero with the car-chase-and-gunfire-filled Jason Bourne franchise. Same thing happened to star Tom Cruise, who turned into a mature action star with the Mission: Impossible series, Jack Reacher, and other films. Leonardo DiCaprio is another good example of it, but without a film franchise as the previous. European action actors such as Belgian Jean-Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport, Hard Target, Timecop), French Jean Reno (Ronin and Mission: Impossible), Swedish Dolph Lundgren (Showdown in Little Tokyo, Universal Soldier, The Expendables), Irish Colin Farrell (S.W.A.T., Daredevil, Miami Vice), and English Jason Statham (The Transporter, The Expendables, Crank) appeared in a number of action films in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nAdventure books feature fast-paced and action-packet plots, and a hero that has to complete an unexpected quest or journey in a short period of time. Oftentimes the main character is tasked with saving another person or fighting something evil and scary, and chance plays a big part in what happens throughout the story. Adventure stories usually take place somewhere intriguing with exciting settings that draw in the reader. The journey of the hero has an exhilarating climax, sacrifice, dangerous scenarios, and a protagonist and antagonist. Sometimes adventure stories have realistic characters, settings, and plots, and sometimes they can be more of a fantasy adventure.\n\nThe '90s would also pave the way for a new sub-genre: found footage. The Blair Witch Project (1999) gave the audience the point-of-view of a camera, putting them in the shoes of the victims. This made the horror more personal for viewers, revitalizing the genre as a whole.\n\nCamera angles, props, and VFX are essential for this sub-genre. But, these will only carry you so far. A good cast who can portray realistic reactions is at the core of making a believable body horror short.\n\nMy aim is to determine the essence of horror and explore it using stories that provoke our deepest fears without relying on our reactions to surprises, deformity, and death. I believe great horror aims for more lingering types of fear brought about by experiences of the Uncanny and the Unknown, unsettling us and filling us with dread. Thus, equipped with a more nuanced understanding of horror, this article will explore how to write horror.\n\nA survey conducted by Fandango begs to differ, finding that the most popular film genre for women is actually action. A breakdown of the popularity of film genres between both male and female viewers found that despite being publically associated with mainly male viewers, the genres of action and adventure are popular with 90% of men and over 85% women.\n\nSome horror scripts stumble out of the gate as they try to set up an overly complicated set of circumstances. They introduce too many minor characters or jump around too much. A pithy prologue can be a useful device to set the mood, but if it goes on for more than a couple of pages, or is too remote from the main action, it can represent a false start. You want to get your central narrative up and running as quickly as possible, without any distractions.\n\n38c6e68cf9"
