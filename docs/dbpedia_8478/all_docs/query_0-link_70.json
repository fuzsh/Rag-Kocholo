        "text": "Now that I’ve gotten screwball comedies out of my system, I can get back to my original post-Oscar plan of reviewing the work of Steven Spielberg. Why have I chosen Spielberg? Well, after I saw Lincoln as part of my Oscar Blitz, it seemed I had a very different opinion of the film than most people I talked to. Frankly, I found it rather boring, as well as typical, sentimental Spielberg.\n\nI realized that it had been a long time since I had been excited about a Spielberg movie, although I have fond memories of much of his early work. So I thought it might be interesting to look back at his entire filmography to see how it has held up for me over the years and whether I might reassess something like Lincoln in light of Spielberg’s overall trajectory.\n\nIn another sense, Spielberg is a perfect follow-up to my Hitchcock series. Not only was Hitchcock a direct influence on Spielberg, but they are among the handful of filmmakers who successfully straddle the art/industry divide, being both highly respected craftsmen and popular “brand name” directors.\n\nRegular readers will not be surprised to learn I would prefer to watch these films chronologically (logical is right there in the word, people!), but I think I want to group them by theme for discussion, so I’m not sure what my schedule will be for individual posts. However, I am planning to begin posting by the end of April and wrap up the entire series by the end of May. Luckily, since I’m not being distracted by either Mad Men or Games of Thrones, this should be entirely possible.\n\nAs a starting point for this series, below are some assessments I would make today based on what I remember of the films I have seen. I will revisit these categories (and more) at the end of the series to see how these picks and assessments hold up under a condensed viewing schedule.\n\nNote: Apart from Jaws, which I have seen repeatedly due to its filming location on Martha’s Vineyard, and some of the early adventure films, I have generally seen these films only once, usually when they were out in theaters. Therefore, there are a few I don’t remember very well at all, including Empire of the Sun, Always, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Amistad, and Minority Report, and a couple where I’m not even sure if I’ve seen the entire film, namely, 1941 and A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The ones I’m sure I haven’t seen are The Sugarland Express, The Color Purple, Hook, The Terminal, War of the Worlds, The Adventures of Tintin, and War Horse.\n\nDesert Island Film: Raiders of the Lost Ark. I might have been tempted by Jaws, but I doubt that would be very good fare when one is stuck on an island.\n\nMost Anticipated Rewatch: Catch Me If You Can. I remember being pleasantly surprised by this one and would love to see if it holds up. Munich was a close second here, but its length prevented it from taking the top spot.\n\nLeast Anticipated Rewatch: Always. I saw this in the theater and remember it as a total tearjerker—Steven Spielberg at his sentimental worst.\n\nMost Anticipated New-to-Me Film: The Adventures of Tintin. I loved Tintin and Milou growing up, which is why I didn’t see this film when it came out as I thought it looked awful. The words “bastardization of my childhood” may have been uttered. However, I have since heard good things and am intrigued.\n\nLeast Anticipated New-to-Me Film: Hook. I am dreading this one. I had no desire to see it when it came out, and the Watching the Directors podcast tore it to shreds when they covered Spielberg.\n\nBest Lead Actor/Actress: Daniel Day-Lewis, Lincoln. This is one that may change upon reviewing everything. It’s a great performance, but a lot of it for me was that he looked like Lincoln, so I’m not sure it will hold up to other heavyweight performances that aren’t complete Oscar bait.\n\nWorst Lead Actor/Actress: Kate Capshaw, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I’m pretty sure this one will hold up, although someone in Hook may give her a run for the money.\n\nBest Stunt Casting: While most people would probably say Sean Connery in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, for me it has to be François Truffaut in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I still can’t believe he agreed to do the role, but he’s perfect.\n\nFavorite Character: Quint in Jaws. The speech (you know the one) still gives me chills every time. Yes, I’m also a fan of Moby-Dick, why do you ask?\n\nBest Line: “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” There may be better lines I’m not remembering, but you can never go wrong with a classic.\n\nBest Opening: Raiders of the Lost Ark. I remember absolutely adoring this when I first saw it and still love watching it every time I revisit this movie—I think it’s my love of puzzles and capers.\n\nWorst Ending: Munich. This was a tough call since Spielberg has a big problem with endings as a rule. As I said during my Oscar blitz, Lincoln would have been infinitely improved by chopping off the last 20 minutes or so, but I went with Munich here since I really would love to forget I ever saw that sex scene.\n\nBest Cinematography: Schindler’s List. I can’t imagine anything will dethrone this one, even if the girl in the red coat is completely unoriginal.\n\nBest Editing: Duel. I can’t remember when I first saw it, but I have a vivid recollection of being amazed at the suspense of this film, given that it is about a battle between a truck and a car.\n\nBest Score: Raiders of the Lost Ark. This was a tough one. Obviously, the musical motifs for both Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind resonate strongly in the mind, and then there is the beautiful violin theme from Schindler’s List, but I think the overall score for Raiders is probably better.\n\nBest Special Effects: Jurassic Park. Dinosaurs! What more needs to be said?\n\nBest Script: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. This is another one that’s a tough call. I don’t have the fondness for E.T. that many people have, but I do remember a pretty tight structure and good dialogue.\n\nMost Underrated Film: Empire of the Sun. I’m not even sure this was on my radar as a Spielberg film when I saw it, or that many people think of it when they think of Spielberg, but I suspect I may conclude it is one of his best “serious” efforts.\n\nMost Overrated Film: Saving Private Ryan. Beyond the incredible opening, I don’t get the love for this film. While no fan of Shakespeare in Love, I have no problem with its “shocking” win at the Oscars that year.\n\nWorst Film: 1941. I know I’ve seen bits of this one, but I suspect I may have turned it off without watching the whole thing. I just remember it being not at all what I expected.\n\nWhat about you? Are you a fan of Spielberg? Which film is your favorite? Which do you feel misses the mark?\n\nFor the complete Spielberg filmography and links to other posts in this series, click here.\n\nI want to be remembered as a man who entertained millions through the technique of film.\n\n—Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980)\n\nI continue to be shocked and amazed at myself for getting through the entirety of Hitchcock’s oeuvre in just over a month. Granted, I relied heavily on the fact that many of these films were not new to me, but still, it was more movie watching than I usually do in a whole year. Now that I’ve recovered somewhat, I thought I would post some final thoughts and recommendations.\n\nFor me, it was particularly interesting to see how my tastes have changed over the years, and what moved up and what moved down in my personal rankings.\n\nI still love The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, and North by Northwest, but found some of the longer films such as Foreign Correspondent, Rebecca, and The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) really dragged when viewed next to his faster paced movies. They are still great films and I would recommend them to any first-time viewer, but I don’t think they hold up to repeat viewing as well as I would have thought. Psycho, on the other hand, is so much more than the shower scene that I remembered.\n\nSuspicion and Notorious certainly lost the romance I saw in them as a teenager (which, granted, makes me able to enjoy them on a whole other level), while I am now better able to appreciate the nuances of a film such as Lifeboat. More people should really see that one, along with Saboteur, Strangers on a Train, Dial “M” for Murder, and The Trouble with Harry, all of which I was happy to revisit.\n\nFinally, I didn’t think there would be too much to interest me in the earlier pictures I hadn’t seen, but I enjoyed a number of the silents as well as Murder!, Secret Agent, and even Waltzes from Vienna. In fact, I have a new interest in silent pictures based on this project and would love suggestions for further viewing. I already know I want to check out Erich von Stroheim’s Greed, since I recently read McTeague and loved it. But I would especially love to know of any personal favorites you have beyond the classics.\n\nIt’s hard to go wrong with Hitchcock, but, if you want to explore his work and don’t know where to start, pick a list below that matches your interests.\n\nThe Top Ten to Watch\n\nThe Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927)\n\nThe 39 Steps (1935)\n\nThe Lady Vanishes (1938)\n\nRebecca (1940)\n\nNotorious (1946)\n\nStrangers on a Train (1951)\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nVertigo (1958)\n\nNorth by Northwest (1959)\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nTop Five Adaptations (Read it, then watch it!)\n\nThe Birds, from the short story “The Birds” by Daphne du Maurier\n\nRebecca, from Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier\n\nSabotage, from The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad\n\nThe 39 Steps, from The Thirty-Nine Steps by John Buchan\n\nYoung and Innocent, from A Shilling for Candles by Josephine Tey\n\nTop Five Murder Scenes\n\nStrangers on a Train (1951)\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nTorn Curtain (1966)\n\nTopaz (1969)\n\nFrenzy (1972)\n\nHe’s got a client who shot his wife in the head six times.

I first saw these two when I was very young and they affected me enormously. In fact, to this day, I always try to have a clear pattern shower curtain because I don’t want anything to be able to hide on either side. True fact.\n\nOn a family trip to California, my father humored this love of Hitchcock and kindly worked Bodega Bay into the itinerary. I had such a fond memory of the visit that I made the town the object of my first road trip up the coast once I moved to California. I had a hard time finding the harbor I remembered until I realized it had been many, many years since that first visit and perhaps the town had moved on. However, a few weeks ago, I did stop in Bodega on my way to Mendocino to make a special visit to the schoolhouse.\n\nThe final phase of Hitchcock’s career contains some of his best known films including Vertigo and Psycho. When I was younger, I didn’t appreciate Vertigo at all, but it has grown on me. I’m still not convinced it should have dethroned Citizen Kane on the Sight and Sound list, but that’s another story. Of course, much of my newfound appreciation has to do with its San Francisco setting. This is one reason I have a strange fondness for Hitchcock’s last film, Family Plot, since it is filmed almost entirely in the city, but Hitchcock tries to hide the fact—perhaps one of his greatest technical feats given the distinctive nature of my hilly adoptive home.\n\nThe Top Five to Watch\n\nBest Film: Vertigo. As I said above, this has never been my favorite Hitchcock, but I acknowledge that it’s a masterpiece and can’t really justify putting anything else in this slot. However, the older I get, the more disturbing I find the subject matter (a retired detective’s obsession with the woman he is hired to follow) and I’m not surprised the movie wasn’t well received upon its release. I’d be interested to see a study of whether men and women view this work differently. I’d also love to know how young people today view the film; much of it is quite odd and I think might seem cheesy or weird to kids today (I find the dream sequence in particular ridiculous).\n\nFavorite Film: Rear Window. I first saw this in the theater with my Dad when they released the restored version sometime in the 80s. The basic plot is simple: a bored wheelchair-bound photojournalist (Jimmy Stewart) gets too interested in his West Village neighbors and thinks one of them may have committed murder. His glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and nurse (Thelma Ritter) are eventually drawn in to help solve the mystery. I love everything about this film: the self-reflective voyeuristic nature of it, the neighbors (who we never meet but learn so much about), the fact that Jeffries is a photographer, Lisa’s clothes, and, especially, Stella’s homespun wisdom.\n\nWe’ve become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change.\n\n—Stella in Rear Window\n\nBest Underlying Plot: North by Northwest. A great mix of adventure, comedy, and suspense, with Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent and has to flee New York, first running to Chicago and then Mount Rushmore. There are so many classic scenes in this movie that I’m sure plenty of people who have never seen it think they have. North by Northwest takes the idea of the innocent man on the run (founds in films like The 39 Steps and Saboteur) and throws in a number of twists and turns to make it even more interesting and layered than Hitchcock’s previous films of this genre.\n\nMost Underrated: Frenzy. I thought I would sneak in one of my favorites here, but I can’t think of another film that deserves this slot more. Frenzy is a great answer to anyone who thinks that Psycho was Hitchcock’s last great film. Hitchcock returns to London (and his father’s old stomping grounds at the Covent Garden Market) to tell yet another wrong man story, this time involving a serial killer who is strangling women with neckties. There is plenty of black humor and Hitchcock makes full use of changing mores, producing a film that is far more explicit than anything else he did. Do not watch this if you need a trigger warning.\n\nBest Adaptation: Psycho. Okay, this is cheating a little, but I had to get this one in somewhere and most of the films in this period are technically adaptations, albeit of minor works. This is another film that I’m sure most people feel they have seen, but if you have only seen the shower scene, you should really check this one out. I was pleasantly surprised how well the dialogue and surrounding story hold up after all these years. Anthony Perkins is just amazing to watch and I can understand how this role dogged him for the rest of his career. The psychoanalytical ending is a letdown but I enjoyed this rewatch far more than I expected.\n\nHonorable Mention: Dial “M” for Murder. This is one of the few Hitchcock films that I remember seeing for the first time, primarily because it was filmed in 3-D and I actually saw it in a theater that way as part of a Hitchcock festival in Paris when I was in high school. [Side note: With a few hundred movie screens in the city, numerous art houses, and all sorts of classic film festivals, Paris is hands-down the best city for cinéphiles.]\n\nIn many ways, Dial “M” for Murder was a trial run for Rear Window, which was to follow that same year: it was Grace Kelly’s first Hitchcock picture (of three), it took place almost entirely on one-set, and it uses a very similar suspense mechanism. It also marks Hitchcock’s entrance into the color era (after his initial experiments with Rope and Under Capricorn) as he would only make two more films in black & white for the rest of his career. So, while Rear Window is certainly more polished and dynamic, I highly recommend this as a follow-up.\n\nOther Accolades and Admonitions\n\nBest Opening: Rear Window. From Franz Waxman’s jazzy score to the pan through the courtyard to introduce the neighbors, Hitchcock’s perfection in setting the scene reminded me of the opening of Do the Right Thing, another tale of a New York neighborhood on a hot summer’s day.\n\nBest Technical Achievement: The dolly zoom in Vertigo. There is a reason this type of reverse tracking shot is also known as the “Hitchcock zoom” or the “Vertigo effect.”\n\nFavorite Image: The puddle created by Juanita’s purple dress as she falls to the marble floor in Topaz.\n\nBest Locations: The Man Who Knew Too Much. If there was one reason for Hitchcock to remake his own work, it was for production value. From the colorful souks and squares of Marrakesh to the Royal Albert Hall, this film could have been delightful. But even the great locations can’t make up for the fact that it was overly long and meandering compared to the studio-bound original.\n\nBest Music: Psycho. While one could make a case for either Vertigo or North by Northwest here, I think it is safe to say that Psycho would not be the same without its music. Like the use of color in Vertigo, it is absolutely integral to the film.\n\nBest Music, Honorable Mention: The Trouble with Harry. This was Bernard Herrmann’s first score for Hitchcock. The music here really accents the darkly comic nature of this piece and we get our first signs of the Herrmann greatness still to come.\n\nMost Frustrating Film to Watch: The Wrong Man. This low-key film was hard to watch because the wrong man aspect was so harsh, especially since the story was based on a real-life case of mistaken identity. It was just too real, and too depressing, particularly the story of the wife, which derails the second half of the picture completely. That said, Henry Fonda and Vera Miles are very good.\n\nThe Grace Kelly “What If” Award: Marnie. Kelly was the first choice for this story about a habitual thief whose employer is determined to understand her illness, but it wasn’t exactly a role for a princess. I actually thought Sean Connery and Diane Baker worked quite well, but Tippi Hedren just didn’t have the acting chops to pull her weight.\n\nTime I’ll Never Get Back Award: Torn Curtain. This should have been so much better than it was. I think the main problem was the casting—neither Paul Newman nor Julie Andrews was very believable in this story about a scientist pretending to be a defector. The story is interesting but the technical level just wasn’t there to make it believable.\n\nBest Ensemble: The Trouble with Harry. With John Forsythe as Sam Marlowe, Shirley MacLaine (in her first movie role) as Jennifer Rogers, a pre-Beaver Jerry Mathers as Arnie Rogers, Mildred Natwick as Miss Gravely, and Edmund Gwenn as Captain Albert Wiles, The Trouble with Harry is really a team effort. This black deadpan comedy of errors takes place in a small town in Vermont where a body is discovered and everybody seems to feel responsible for his death. This leads the various guilt-ridden characters to bury and dig up the body throughout the film. (Morbid) Hilarity ensues.\n\nFavorite Couple: To Catch a Thief. When two of Hitchcock’s favorite actors team up for this adventure on the French Riviera, fireworks (literally) ensue. Grace Kelly is Francie Stevens, a wealthy American with a rambunctious mother, and Cary Grant is John Robie, aka The Cat, a retired jewel thief trying to prove his innocence in a series of recent thefts. If you like Charade, you will like this.\n\nCoolest Villain: Ray Milland as Tony Wendice in Dial “M” for Murder.\n\nCreepiest Villain: The killer in Frenzy.\n\nFavorite Detective: John Williams as Inspector Hubbard in Dial “M” for Murder.\n\nFavorite Fake Medium: Barbara Harris as “Madame Blanche” in Family Plot.\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role: Thelma Ritter as Stella in Rear Window.\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role: Edmund Gwenn as Captain Wiles in The Trouble with Harry. Edmund Gwenn’s work with Hitchcock dates all the way back to The Skin Game in the early 1930s and he is in great form here.\n\nBest Repeat Performance: Jessie Royce Landis, first as Grace Kelly’s mother in To Catch a Thief opposite Cary Grant, and then as Cary Grant’s mother in North by Northwest.\n\nBest Dressed: Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont in Rear Window. You should appreciate Grace Kelly’s outfits (designed by Edith Head) in all three of her films while you can, fashions get pretty hideous starting with Vertigo.\n\nBest Dressed, Honorable Mention: Grace Kelly’s masquerade ball gown in To Catch a Thief.\n\nBest Dressed, Trees Edition: The Trouble with Harry. Vermont in the fall, one of the few things I really miss about the East Coast.\n\nBest Running Gag: The “gourmet” cooking of the Chief Inspector’s wife in Frenzy.\n\nMost Realistic Murder: Torn Curtain. If you ever thought murder looked easy or appealing, think again. [Note: This assessment is not based on personal experience.]\n\nMost Ominous Moment: The birds gathering on the jungle gym behind Tippi Hedren in The Birds.\n\nBest Red Shoes Homage: Torn Curtain. The lead ballerina in a production of what looks and sounds like Francesca da Rimini spots Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in the crowd at an East German theater and reports them to authorities.\n\nBest Advertisement for Train Travel: North by Northwest. Selling point: the trout is “a little trouty, but quite good.”\n\n—Think how lucky I am to be seated here.\n\n—Luck had nothing to do with it.\n\n—Fate?\n\n—I tipped the steward 5 dollars to seat you here if you should come in.\n\n—Is that a proposition?\n\n—I never discuss love on an empty stomach.\n\n—You’ve already eaten!\n\n—But you haven’t.\n\nMost Vertiginous Car Ride (tie): North by Northwest and Family Plot. Whether through booze or faulty brakes, neither of these rides are for the faint of heart.\n\nBest Use of a Spirograph: Saul Bass in the credits of Vertigo.\n\nMost Misleading Title (tie): The Wrong Man and Psycho. I kid. If you can’t figure out the gist of most of these movies by their title, you have bigger problems than I realized.\n\nHitchcock Filmography: The Master of Suspense\n\nDial “M” for Murder (1954)\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nTo Catch a Thief (1955)\n\nThe Trouble with Harry (1955)\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n\nThe Wrong Man (1956)\n\nVertigo (1958)\n\nNorth by Northwest (1959)\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nThe Birds (1963)\n\nMarnie (1964)\n\nTorn Curtain (1966)\n\nTopaz (1969)\n\nFrenzy (1972)\n\nFamily Plot (1976)\n\nFor previous posts in this Film 101 series, click below:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: Cultural Icon\n\nHitchcock I: Sound and Silence\n\nHitchcock II: The British Talkies\n\nHitchcock III: Vintage Hollywood\n\nFor my final thoughts on Hitchcock, see Hitchcock V: Wrap Party.\n\nIn looking for photos for these Hitchcock posts, I have come across a few blogs viewing Hitchcock’s body of work in weekly posts over a year. With fifty-two extant feature films, this makes a whole lot of sense. I’m not sure what I was thinking, deciding to watch them all in a little over a month. That said, watching these films in such close succession does have its benefits. Certain techniques and themes jump out at me when I see them repeat over and over in the course of a few days or weeks, although Hitchcock’s reuse of leading and secondary players can make for some jarring juxtapositions.\n\nWatching Hitchcock’s films chronologically emphasizes the extraordinary continuity in his work, as you see Robert Donat, the man on the run on a quest to prove his innocence in The 39 Steps, become Robert Cummings in Saboteur, and later Cary Grant in North by Northwest. However, there is a notable uptick in production quality as we enter the American years and Hitchcock is able to make use of Hollywood’s financial resources.\n\nHollywood had courted Hitchcock for some time, but he remained in England until agreeing to a four-picture contract with legendary producer David O. Selznick (Gone with the Wind). The first movie they made together was Rebecca, which would go on to win the Oscar for Best Picture—the last of the four was not made until 1948 (The Paradine Case) because Hitchcock was often loaned out to other studios over the course of his contract.\n\nUpon moving to California, Hitchcock very quickly discovered Northern California, purchasing his home in Scotts Valley (outside of Santa Cruz) in September 1940. Northern California locations would appear quite frequently in his work, from using Monterey Bay to represent the English coast in Rebecca and Suspicion, to choosing Santa Rosa as the setting for Shadow of a Doubt, to the iconic Vertigo, a love letter to San Francisco if there ever was one.\n\nBut, hey, we have fifteen films to cover this week, let’s get to them, shall we?\n\nTop Five to Watch\n\nBest Film: Notorious. I knew going into this week that Notorious would find itself here in the top spot. It’s a great spy story with superb acting, although much darker in tone than his other espionage films. In a way, it’s the brightest noir you’ll ever see, as beneath its polished, sophisticated tone, the film is really quite savage. And I’m not talking about the Nazis. Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains are all incredible, particularly Bergman.\n\nFavorite Film: Rebecca. This is Hitchcock’s first film for Selznick and would win the Oscar for Best Cinematography as well as Best Picture. Like Jamaica Inn and The Birds, this is an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier, and tells the story of an unnamed narrator (Joan Fontaine) who marries a wealthy man (Laurence Olivier) and is haunted by the memory of his first wife. To me, this film strays pretty far from Hitchcock’s usual plots and techniques, and goes on a bit too long, but the mood and atmosphere he creates, especially with his portrayal of Mrs. Danvers, showcases the Gothic side of Hitchcock.\n\nBest Underlying Plot: Saboteur. While totally full of wartime propaganda, Saboteur is great fun and a fine tribute to Hitchcock’s new home in the States, telling the story of a munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage and travels across the country to prove his innocence. Unfortunately, Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings were imposed on Hitchcock as leads, and, as primarily comic actors (you might recognize Lane from her role as the bride in Arsenic and Old Lace), they are not quite up to the parts, but Dorothy Parker contributed to the screenplay and it shows—there are many delightful scenes.\n\nMost Underrated: Lifeboat. This choice was a bit of a surprise to me, I thought Suspicion would end up taking this slot, but Lifeboat definitely should get more notice than it does. (Of course, in my opinion, either one is far more deserving of the Criterion treatment than Spellbound.) Despite being completely bounded by its WWII setting, Lifeboat remains extremely interesting and relevant today. Maybe it’s because I recently read Charlotte Rogan’s Lifeboat, or am really looking forward to Ang Lee’s Life of Pi, but this movie resonated with me more this time around than when I first watched it. The basic story begins with the floating debris of a ship, recently sunk by a German U-boat. One passenger (Tallulah Bankhead) is sitting in a lifeboat, which gradually accumulates a motley collection of survivors, including passengers, crew, and one German. Remarkably, the entire film takes place in the boat, even Hitchcock’s cameo (see photo above).\n\nBest Adaptation: Strangers on a Train. Not having read the original novel by Patricia Highsmith, this is a bit hard to judge; however, since I didn’t love her first Ripley book, I think I can safely say that this adaptation is at least as good as the book. In any case, it’s a great film. Robert Walker is perfectly creepy as a psychopath with daddy issues. Raymond Chandler assisted with the adaptation, but the dialogue isn’t as hard-boiled as you might think.\n\nThe Also-Rans\n\nForeign Correspondent is good, but it didn’t make the top five because it suffers from being bloated in length and too heavy on the propaganda. I think this was a case of “Hey, I have a budget now, let’s use it!” mixed with “America, I feel guilty for leaving England, please join the war against the bad guys!” Otherwise, it’s a great espionage story with incredible set pieces, from the chase under the umbrellas to the windmill sequence to the airliner climax.\n\nShadow of a Doubt was supposedly Hitchcock’s personal favorite and one where the characters are very fleshed out. Joseph Cotton plays the “merry widow murderer” who comes to Santa Rosa to hideout with his sister’s family, including his favorite niece and namesake. As detectives start to circle, and his niece starts to figure out the truth, he must decide what to do.\n\nSuspicion was another strong contender and a favorite from my younger years, but ultimately I think it’s my love of Regency romances, the Joan Fontaine character from Rebecca, and Beaky (see below) that make this more of a personal favorite than one everyone should see. I had totally forgotten how much Lina pines for Johnny in the beginning—chalk that up to the naïve teenager in me—and that really grated on rewatch. Note: Joan Fontaine won Best Actress for this role.\n\nBest Technical Achievement: Rope. Similar to Lifeboat, Rope was a one-set film. Based on a play, the story is quite simple: two prep-school friends kill another friend just for the thrill of it, and challenge themselves by inviting friends, family, and a former teacher (Jimmy Stewart) to their apartment afterward. Two further challenges for Hitchcock were that it was his first Technicolor film and was shot in ten-minute takes (the maximum amount of film the camera would hold). Shots started and ended on people’s backs etc. to hide the film change—the effect is a film that seems to be one long take.\n\nBiggest Surprise: Under Capricorn. This was one of the few films of this period that I hadn’t seen before. For some reason, I expected to hate it, but I didn’t. It’s an odd piece for Hitchcock: Filmed just after Rope, it also uses Technicolor and long takes, but is a period costume drama set in nineteenth-century Australia. It is not in league with most of these films, but it has a few Rebecca-like elements that I enjoyed.\n\nBest Opening Sequence: Suspicion. The viewer’s entry into this film is a completely black screen and Cary Grant’s voice as he makes his way into Joan Fontaine’s compartment while their train is in a tunnel. A great way to destabilize the viewer right from the beginning.\n\nBest Opening Sequence (runner-up): Strangers on a Train. Following only the shoes of Guy and Bruno as they get out of their taxis, board the train, and meet for the first time.\n\nEnding with the Highest HSQ: Spellbound. A very clever use of perspective that must have been incredible to watch in a theater.\n\nBest Locations: Saboteur, with location shooting in the Southern California desert and New York City, including a shootout at Radio City Music Hall and a climax at the Statue of Liberty.\n\nMost Ominous Moment: Suspicion. The camera slowly follows Cary Grant as he walks across a skylight window shadow that looks remarkably like a spider’s web and up the stairs to deliver what might be a fatal glass of milk. Hitchcock used a light bulb to illuminate the milk and make it glow.\n\nMost Incongruous Use of a Theater Set: I Confess. Despite the fact that this film is about a Québécois priest (Montgomery Clift, yum) who hears a murderer’s confession and is himself accused of the crime and on trial for his life, Hitchcock still manages to stage the final scene in a theater setting.\n\nTensest Moment: The stitches slowly pulling out of the villain’s coat in Saboteur.\n\nBest Running Gag (Audio): The conversations about murder methods between Hume Cronyn and Henry Travers in Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nBest Running Gag (Video): Joel McCrea’s wandering hats in Foreign Correspondent.\n\nFavorite Love Scene: Foreign Correspondent:\n\n—You see, I love you, and I want to marry you.\n\n—I love you, and I want to marry you.\n\n—That cuts our love scene down quite a bit, doesn’t it?\n\n—Do you mind?\n\n—Not at all. It’s made a new man of me.\n\n—I hope not entirely new. It took me some time to get used to the first man you were.\n\n—To be perfectly frank with you, I expected a little more argument. I’m really left with quite a few things I very much wanted to say.\n\nFavorite Couple: Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I think this film is vastly underrated, but it could have been so much better than it was. Apparently Lombard, a friend of Hitchcock, wanted to work with him. Although there are many comic moments in Hitchcock’s films, this is his only screwball comedy. The crux of the plot is that Lombard and Montgomery discover their marriage isn’t legal, and while Lombard tries to break away, Montgomery tries to win her back. It’s very formulaic, but I absolutely adore Lombard.\n\nBest Villainess: Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca.\n\nBest Villain: Robert Walker as Bruno in Strangers on a Train.\n\nFavorite Heroine: Tallulah Bankhead as Constance Porter in Lifeboat.\n\nFavorite Hero: Michael Wilding as Inspector Wilfred Smith in Stage Fright. This may be mostly because he reminds me of Peter Lawford in Easter Parade.\n\nFavorite Supporting Character: Nigel Bruce as Beaky in Suspicion. One of the most sympathetic and funny characters in any Hitchcock film.\n\nFavorite Supporting Character (runner-up): Stebbins in Foreign Correspondent. Played (and written) by Algonquin Round Table member and writer-critic Robert Benchley, Stebbins, a foreign correspondent based in London, gives an air of authenticity to this movie.\n\nThe Freudian Slip Award: The dream sequence in Spellbound. It should be said that I do not like this movie: the plot is ridiculous, and I don’t think either Ingrid Bergman or Gregory Peck is very convincing; however, it is worth watching for the famous dream sequence, designed by Salvador Dali.\n\nBest Frankenstein Homage: The scene in the blind man’s cabin in Saboteur.\n\nBest Contemporaneous All About Eve Homage: Stage Fright. Jane Wyman plays (wait for it) Eve Gill, an aspiring London actress who “goes undercover” as Marlene Dietrich’s maid and dresser in an attempt to clear her friend of the murder of Dietrich’s husband. This one had interesting characters and a few good red herrings.\n\nMost Misleading Title: Spellbound. This gives no clue as to the plot or tone of this film. Under Capricorn could have taken this one, but I don’t think it’s misleading so much as nonsensical.\n\nFavorite Champagne Call Back: Notorious. As in the silent era, champagne once again takes center stage as a plot device and is used to show time passing, as in The Ring. This time, the dwindling champagne stock may cause Bergman and Grant’s spy shenanigans to be discovered.\n\nThe Least But Not Last Award: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. These two short French films (about 25 minutes each) were made during the war as propaganda for the Free French. I hadn’t expected to enjoy them, but they are tight little stories and, while not obviously “Hitchcockian,” there are little touches here and there that show the master’s influence.\n\nTime I’ll Never Get Back Award: The Paradine Case. I knew I shouldn’t bother to rewatch this one, but for some reason it came before the other two ahead of it in my queue, so I figured why not? The only benefit to the rewatch was that I realized that Emily Blunt is a dead ringer for Valli, who plays Mrs. Paradine. Seriously, I googled to see whether they were related. They’re not apparently, but someone else clearly had the same idea because there is a Facebook page devoted to the concept. Otherwise, this is a fairly boring, hopelessly miscast courtroom drama. The courtroom scenes are dramatic, but the trial doesn’t start until more than an hour has passed, which is a problem.\n\nHitchcock Filmography: Vintage Hollywood\n\nRebecca (1940)\n\nForeign Correspondent (1940)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith (1941)\n\nSuspicion (1941)\n\nSaboteur (1942)\n\nShadow of a Doubt (1943)\n\nLifeboat (1944)\n\nBon Voyage/Aventure malgache (1944)\n\nSpellbound (1945)\n\nNotorious (1946)\n\nThe Paradine Case (1947)\n\nRope (1948)\n\nUnder Capricorn (1949)\n\nStage Fright (1950)\n\nStrangers on a Train (1951)\n\nI Confess (1953)\n\nFor previous posts in this Film 101 series, click below:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: Cultural Icon\n\nHitchcock I: Sound and Silence\n\nHitchcock II: The British Talkies\n\nFor the next post in this series, see Hitchcock IV: The Master of Suspense.\n\nAs always, I’d love to hear your thoughts on any of these films!\n\nSorry for disappearing, but I ended up taking a short road trip up the coast to Mendocino. Along the way I made a brief Hitchcock pilgrimage to the lovely village of Bodega, location of The Birds, to be discussed in a few weeks. While delightful, if not quite as foggy as I would have liked, that meant less viewing time for the thirteen films I needed to cover. [Side note: Thirteen is a number near and dear to Hitchcock’s heart as well as the name of his very first, unfinished (and now lost) silent film.]\n\nAnother reason it took me a bit longer to post about Hitchcock’s British period is that I hadn’t before seen most of these. While The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes are longtime favorites that I can easily conjure up in my mind’s eye, the others were completely new. Some ended up being pleasant surprises and others were a bit of a chore.\n\nAs a completist, I’m glad I saw them all, but I think you could safely ignore most of his early talkies. As noted last week, Blackmail is quite interesting, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to seek out the others (unless you love early talkies, in which case, they almost all have some sort of merit). It is really when Hitchcock renews his partnership with Michael Balcon (producer of his early silents, including The Lodger) that his British period takes off. Starting with The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934 through The Lady Vanishes in 1938, these films all hold up very well.\n\nOf course, as always, it is critical to seek out good transfers whenever possible. Three of these films (The Man Who Knew Too Much, The 39 Steps, and The Lady Vanishes) are part of the Criterion collection, so get those if you can. The complete filmography can be found at the bottom of this post.\n\nThe Top Five to Watch\n\nBest Film: The 39 Steps. This movie has everything we will later look for in a Hitchcock picture: suspense, the wrong man, MacGuffins, trains, blondes, and so on. One could argue that one of Hitchcock’s most famous films, North by Northwest, is essentially a remake of this original, as an ordinary, innocent man is pulled into a spy ring’s activities. The story, adapted from the popular John Buchan novel, which I read for my Classic Boys Adventures book salon, was Hitchcock’s most successful motion picture of the interwar.\n\nFavorite Film: The Lady Vanishes. This is one of the first Hitchcocks I remember seeing. It has many elements of what I love about Regency romances and probably the most comedic elements of any of his “suspense” films. If you’ve seen Flightplan, you have an idea of the basic plot: An old English woman’s disappearance during a train trip leads a young woman into a complicated web of intrigue when no one believes her story. But there is so much more here, including the most fleshed-out cast of characters in any Hitchcock film.\n\nBest Underlying Plot: The Man Who Knew Too Much. You may be familiar with the Jimmy Stewart-Doris Day version, which is a Technicolor and VistaVision remake of this first in Hitchcock’s series of espionage thrillers of the 1930s. I understand why Hitchcock attempted to remake it, because there are definitely technical and production weaknesses, but the pacing in this one is so much better than the later version. Bonus: This is Peter Lorre’s first film in English.\n\nMost Underrated: Secret Agent. Oddly enough, this film is not based on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent (see below), but rather the short story collection Ashenden by W. Somerset Maugham (based on the author’s experience in British Intelligence). This story of an English novelist who returns home from WWI to find that a government agency has faked a report of his death and wants him to travel to Switzerland to track down a German agent, reminded me greatly of Waiting for Sunrise.\n\nBest Adaptation: Sabotage, based on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent. Sabotage is a great example of hewing closely to a literary plot, but updating it with modern, filmic elements. I love the fact that Hitchcock chooses to make Verloc the owner of a movie house, and he uses that setting to his full advantage. Be prepared, this one takes some shocking twists and turns.\n\nAnd now the real awards!\n\nTime I’ll Never Get Back Award: Juno and the Paycock. I was prepared for not liking this by the now-defunct Watching the Directors podcast, but, wow, it was worse than I thought. This may have been a successful play, but it is a remarkably boring film. The transfer was certainly atrocious (the tops of people’s head are often cut off, for example), but it suffers more from “filmed theater” syndrome than anything.\n\nMost Misleading Title: The Skin Game. There are definitely some interesting shots in this movie, but very little skin. Overall, there is not much to recommend this “talking film” adaptation of a play about feuding neighbors, one an old money landowner, the other a nouveau riche industrialist (the Hillcrists and the Hornblowers—just guess which is which).\n\nBest “Silent” Talkie: Rich and Strange. This story about a bored couple who inherit money and travel the world is an odd entry in the Hitchcock canon, but I’ve seen it written that this is semi-autobiographical about the Hitchcocks’ marriage, so make of that what you will. The couple dynamic is certainly one we’ll see often in his movies—smart, sophisticated, and madly in love despite appearances. An early talkie, only 20 to 25 percent of this film involves dialogue.\n\nEnding with the Highest HSQ*: Murder! This is probably the best of the early Hitchcocks. The story revolves around a murder trial and its aftermath, when a sympathetic jury member tries to prove the innocence of the woman he has condemned. Obviously, I do not want to elaborate on the ending, but let’s just say I was not expecting that at all.\n\n*Holy Shit Quotient, if you’re wondering.\n\nBest Dressed: Elsa Carrington in Secret Agent. The first gown we see Madeleine Carroll wear is the showstopper above. As a rule, I find that there are a lot of crazy and/or hideous outfits in 1930s films, but I think I love everything Carroll wore in this one. She especially stands out since many Hitchcock films of this period feature an abundance of tweed.\n\nFavorite MacGuffin: The 39 Steps. What is a MacGuffin? Basically, it’s a plot point, the thing everyone is looking for or trying to figure out, but whose specific identity or meaning is ultimately unimportant to the audience. While most people might say the MacGuffin here is a stolen set of plans, I would argue that it is also the “39 steps” themselves. I love this one, because the real meaning of the title could have been used (actual physical steps leading down a cliff), but Hitchcock chooses to completely ignore it and never explain the origin of the term. So, beyond being the first MacGuffin, it is actually the perfect MacGuffin.\n\nFavorite Icy Blonde: Madeleine Carroll as both Pamela in The 39 Steps and Elsa in Secret Agent.\n\nFavorite Couple: Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes.\n\nFavorite Supporting Characters: The cricket fans in The Lady Vanishes. While I love the couple formed by Redgrave and Lockwood, Nauton Wayne and Basil Radford get a lot of screen time and totally steal the show.\n\nBest Technical Achievement: The tracking shot in Young and Innocent. In general, this extremely loose adaptation of Josephine Tey’s A Shilling for Candles is a lesser version of The 39 Steps, but it is worth watching for the one uninterrupted shot that sweeps across a ballroom to zoom in on the blinking eyes of the killer.\n\nBest Cut: From the screaming landlady to the train whistle in The 39 Steps. Of course, we saw a forerunner of this idea with a similar sound cue in Blackmail.\n\nBest Unintentional Noises Off Homage: Murder! One of the best scenes in this movie, perhaps second only to the climatic ending (see above), is that of the attempted interview of theater troupe members backstage during a performance. Yes, I’m currently reading Skios by Michael Frayn, why do you ask?\n\nBest Unintentional Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Homage: Waltzes from Vienna. I just couldn’t get Chitty Chitty Bang Bang out of my head while watching this movie about a young Strauss who goes to work in the bakery of his girlfriend’s father. Like Chitty, there are many great slapstick moments as a wealthy couple prepares a caper to ensure that “The Blue Danube Waltz” gets a public premiere. This film gets little love, but I thought it was quite funny and modern.\n\nMost Confusing Plot: Number Seventeen. Given the short length of this film, and the confusing nature of the plot, one might be tempted to think it had been butchered by editors or footage was lost along the way, but I’ve found no evidence of this.\n\nMost Expressionist: Number Seventeen. I wish this movie had been more fleshed out, because it is filled with great visuals and horror moments: ominous music, creeping hands, slamming doors, weird shadows. Unsurprisingly, there is a great shout-out to The Lodger with a hand creeping along the banister.\n\nSpeaking of creepy…\n\nMost Gratuitous Clown Appearance: Murder! As if the hideous painting in Blackmail wasn’t enough, Hitchcock inserts a laughing clown into the final HSQ moments (see above) of this bizarre film.\n\nWorst Hair: Peter Lorre as The General in Secret Agent. Luckily, Lorre actually plays the funny sidekick role in this film or else I would have had a harder time with it.\n\nWorst Eyebrows: Charles Laughton as Sir Humphrey Pengaltan in Jamaica Inn. Laughton plays an outrageously pompous local squire who heads a band of Cornwall pirates in this rather stodgy period picture noted mostly for introducing Maureen O’Hara. In the original book by Daphne Du Maurier there was a lot more mystery; here, the only mystery is what the makeup artist was thinking.\n\nTensest Moment (tie): The bus ride in Sabotage and the moment when Ben is examining the gun in Number Seventeen. And many, many others…\n\nHitchcock Filmography: The British Talkies\n\nBlackmail (1929)\n\nJuno and the Paycock (1930)\n\nMurder!
