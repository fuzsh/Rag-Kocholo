        "text": "A road trip often serves a bildungsroman, a coming-of-age story in which the hero changes and grows over the course of the story. It’s a standard film plot employed by screenwriters, yet there is so much variety in this genre.\n\nRomance, drama, comedy, thriller. Spontaneous trips filled with adventure or planned vacations gone awry. By bus, by car, by motorcycle, or even by lawnmower. Strippers, musicians, families. For revenge or for redemption. Sometimes they’re serious, but they can also be good fun.\n\nSo grab your popcorn and buckle up! Let these diverse movies transport you somewhere new and inspire you to get out on the road to self-discovery.\n\nInto the Wild\n\nInto the Wild (2007) is an introspective biographical drama that tells the compelling true story of a young man, Chris McCandless, who rejects his privileged upbringing to embark on a cross-country road trip in search of meaning and self-discovery. Leaving his comfortable life behind, Chris (played by Emile Hirsch) ventures into the unforgiving wilderness of Alaska, where he must confront the harsh realities and devastating consequences of his solitary existence. Like the Jon Krakauer book it’s adapted from, enjoy emotional encounters with fellow travellers and profound moments of self-reflection, plus the beautiful scenery of the north.\n\nGreen Book\n\nGreen Book (2018) deservedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. Set in the 1960s, the film is a historical drama about travel in the racially-divided American South. It tells a fictionalized account of a real road trip taken by Dr. Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali), a world-class African-American pianist, and his hired driver, Italian-American bouncer from the Bronx Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen). As they set out on a concert tour, they rely on the Green Book, a guide for Black travellers, to find safe accommodations. Despite their differences and encountering the harsh realities of racism, the pair challenge their preconceptions and prejudices and form an unexpected bond.\n\nJoy Ride\n\nIn the movie Joy Ride (2001), three college friends set out on a road trip that quickly takes a sinister turn. Lewis, Fuller, and Venna (played by Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, and Leelee Sobieski, respectively) discover a CB radio and decide to have some fun by pretending to be a woman named Candy Cane. However, their prank turns deadly when they unknowingly provoke a trucker named Rusty Nail, who becomes obsessed with seeking revenge. As Rusty Nail terrorizes and hunts them down, the friends find themselves in a race against time to outsmart their relentless pursuer and survive the nightmarish journey they didn’t expect.\n\nNomadland\n\nNomadland (2020) is an Oscar-winning film that explores the life of Fern, a woman in her sixties who loses her job and embarks on a transformative journey across the American West in her van. Embracing the nomadic lifestyle and encountering a diverse group of fellow wanderers, Fern (played by Frances McDormand) discovers the beauty of living in the moment and finds solace in the vast landscapes that effortlessly capture the essence of freedom and human connection. Through both the challenges and the joys she encounters on her unconventional path, Fern learns to redefine her relationship with society, material possessions, and ultimately, with herself.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine\n\nIn the heartwarming and goofy film Little Miss Sunshine (2006), the eccentric Hoover family goes on a road trip from Albuquerque to California, with one goal in mind: to support their youngest child, Olive, as she competes in a beauty pageant. However, each family member carries their own emotional baggage and faces personal challenges. Packed with quirky characters, unexpected twists, and a touching exploration of acceptance and individuality, Little Miss Sunshine is a delightful journey. Remember: A real loser is somebody who is so afraid of not winning they don't even try.\n\nDrive My Car\n\nIn the critically acclaimed film Drive My Car (2021), directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, renowned theater director Yusuke Kafuku mourns the loss of his wife while grappling with unresolved conflicts in their relationship. As part of his healing process, Yusuke agrees to direct a stage adaptation of Anton Chekhov's play Uncle Vanya. The festival requires that he be chauffeured in his own car for insurance reasons, so he hires Misaki to take him around town. As they spend more time together on the road, Yusuke slowly opens up about his past and the complexities of his relationships. The movie navigates the intricacies of love, grief, and forgiveness against the backdrop of the beautiful Japanese countryside.\n\nThelma and Louise\n\nIn the unforgettable classic film Thelma and Louise (1991), directed by Ridley Scott, the two best friends embark on a transformative journey filled with adventure, self-discovery—and unexpected consequences. The duo sets off on a weekend road trip together, but their little excursion takes a dramatic turn when an unsettling incident forces them to flee from the law. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are exceptional, and the movie has become a landmark feminist film.\n\nQueen and Slim\n\nIn the darkly romantic movie Queen and Slim (2019), a young couple on their first date unintentionally kill a police officer in self-defence during a routine traffic stop. Faced with the harsh reality of their actions and aware of the systemic injustice they might face, they make a fateful decision to go on the run. As their journey unfolds, they become modern-day folk heroes and symbols of resistance against oppression. Queen and Slim, starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith, explores the complex theme of racial injustice, and when I saw this movie in a sold-out cinema in Paris, it received a standing ovation.\n\nThe Highwaymen\n\nThe Highwaymen (2019) is a gripping dramatic film. Set in the 1930s, it tells the untold story of two former Texas Rangers, Frank Hamer (played by Kevin Costner) and Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), who come out of retirement to hunt down and capture the infamous outlaws, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. As they embark on this dangerous pursuit, they face numerous obstacles, the biggest being the media glorifying the criminals as heroes. Even though it’s based on a true story and we know the ending, how they get there is still interesting.\n\nDue Date\n\nIn the hilarious comedy film Due Date (2010), directed by Todd Phillips, Peter Highman (played by Robert Downey Jr.) is a stressed expectant father who finds himself on an unpredictable cross-country road trip with an eccentric yet well-meaning aspiring actor, Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis).
