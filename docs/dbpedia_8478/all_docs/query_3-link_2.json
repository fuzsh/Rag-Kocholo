        "text": "The introduction of sound to filmmaking had been a big draw for moviegoers in the 30’s. In fact, in 1930 alone, 110 million people went to the movies – all the while in the midst of the Great Depression (precipitated by the stock market crash of the previous year). While a staple of the studios, Westerns had little following left in the early ‘30s. The tired “horse drama” formulas were just too predictable.\n\nBut then in the mid ‘30s, Hollywood began glamorizing the American West with the emergence of A-list stars to the genre and more adult storytelling. By the late 30’s, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars were featured in Westerns; Errol Flynn with Olivia de Havilland in Dodge City (1939), (1 of 8 films they made together) and even perennial gangster tough guys, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart starred in The Oklahoma Kid (1939).\n\nIn addition to Westerns, Swashbuckler films were also a popular draw in the ‘30s; The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Captain Blood (1935), Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), The Man in the Iron Mask (1939), among many others. These films featured iconic performances by some of the biggest stars of the era.\n\nOften cited as the greatest anti-war film ever made. All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) told a graphic story of the horrors of “The Great War” entirely from the German point of view. WWI provided inspiration for a number of films of the era including; Grand Illusion (1937), The Dawn Patrol (1938), Hell's Angels (1930) – among others.\n\n​ Noteworthy actors in this early genre: Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, John Wayne, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr."
