This project aims to study the administrative and political history of the city of Mons en Hainaut in the 14th and 15th centuries. The focus lies on the accounts of the city's 'massarderie' and the 'livres du Conseil' with a projected edition of both sources. A list of aldermen, dearly missing for the capital of the county of Hainault, will greatly aid future research of the political elite of the city.
