Hainaut, located in the southwestern part of Belgium, is one of the country's ten provinces. The province borders France to its south, while within Belgium, it borders the Flemish provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, and the Walloon provinces of Walloon Brabant and Namur.[4] The capital city is Mons, which contains a considerable amount of historical heritage and landmarks.[9] Yet, the largest city within the province's borders is Charleroi, a former mining town.[8] The Boot of Hainaut's landscape consists more of rolling hills. The highest point within the province is the village of L'EscaillÃ¨re, at an altitude of 365 meters above sea level.[4] There are several protected natural areas in Hainaut, one of them being the Scheldt Plains nature park which features forests, meadows, and farmers' open fields interspersed with woods and hedges.[6] For most of its history, Hainaut was part of the County of Hainault, created during the Carolingian period. The county encompassed the larger adjacent territory and lasted until circa 1830 when its northern territories became part of Belgium.[2] In terms of local climate, the warmest month throughout the year is July, with the average temperature being around 25Â°C.[7]
