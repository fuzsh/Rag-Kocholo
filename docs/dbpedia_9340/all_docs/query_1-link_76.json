        "text": "On 1 January 2024, the legal population in Belgium[1] was 11,763,650 inhabitants. Between 1 January 2023 and 1 January 2024, the Belgian population has grown by 66,093 inhabitants, or by 0.57%. So the population growth was somewhat higher than the average of the last 10 years, which is 0.53%. This is what emerges from the official figures of Statbel, the Belgian statistical office.\n\nThe population growth in 2023 is the result of a positive international migration balance, whose impact on growth was reduced by the negative natural balance(-1,057). The war in Ukraine continues to have a positive impact on the international migration balance in 2023, although much less pronounced than in 2022. The statistical adjustment is limited[2] (+801).\n\nPopulation development in Belgium\n\n2023 was marked by a population growth of 0.57% or 66,093 inhabitants. The growth in 2023 is higher than the average of the last 10 years, i.e. 0.53%.\n\nThe natural balance, i.e. the difference between the number of births and deaths, was negative again in 2023 (-1,057). The natural balance has been on a downward trend for several years, so a negative natural balance seems to be becoming the new normal. A negative natural balance has resurfaced in 2020 (-13,111). That year was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which pushed up the number of deaths. Then, a negative natural balance was observed again in 2022 (-2,787). Before that we had to go back to the early â€˜40s to find a negative natural balance again. However, the natural balance had been showing a declining trend for several years. This downward trend can be mainly explained by a declining trend in the number of births, but also by an upward trend in the number of deaths due to population ageing. 110,198 births and 111,255 deaths were registered in 2023.\n\nThe international migration balance, i.e. the difference between the number of immigrations and emigrations, was positive in 2023 (+66,349). A positive international migration balance is in line with expectations, but the balance is slightly more positive than the average of the last 10 years. This can be explained by a larger number of international immigrations[3] in 2023: 194,887 immigrations were recorded. The slightly higher number of immigrations can be partly explained by the consequences of the war in Ukraine, as 13,702 immigrants (7.0%) are of Ukrainian nationality. So the impact is still there, but is much smaller than last year, where 57,514 immigrants (24.6%) had the Ukrainian nationality. Furthermore, 128,538 international emigrations[4] were registered in 2023, which is also high. Again, people with the Ukrainian nationality play a major role. In 2020 and 2021, 0.3% and 0.2% of emigrants respectively had the Ukrainian nationality. This share increased to 4.6% in 2022 and 5.9% in 2023.\n\nSo the population growth in 2023 in Belgium is the result of a positive international migration balance, which offset the negative natural balance while still ensuring a population growth of 0.57% or 66,093 inhabitants.\n\nEvolution of the population in the Flemish Region\n\nFlanders registered in 2023 a population growth of 0.69% or 46,963 inhabitants (compared to an average of 0.60% over the last 10 years).\n\nThe natural balance was negative in 2023 (-2,332). 62,338 births and 64,670 deaths were recorded that year.\n\nThe international migration balance was positive in 2023 (+34,180). 94,715 immigrations and 60,535 emigrations were registered that year. Of the immigrants and emigrants, 8,249 and 5,062 respectively had the Ukrainian nationality.\n\nAt all geographical levels lower than Belgium, a third balance comes into play: the internal migration balance. This balance sums up the number of moves within Belgium. The internal migration balance, the difference between the number of people moving in and out of the Flemish Region, was positive in 2023 (+14,856). So there were more people moving from another region to Flanders (38,057) than people moving from Flanders to another region (23,201).\n\nSo the positive population growth in 2023 in the Flemish Region is the result of a positive internal migration balance and a very positive international migration balance, which offset the negative natural balance.\n\nPopulation development in the Walloon Region\n\nWallonia registered in 2023 a population growth of 0.29% or 10,708 inhabitants (compared to an average of 0.33% over the last 10 years).\n\nThe natural balance was negative in 2023 (-4,129). 33,873 births and 38,002 deaths were recorded that year.\n\nThe international migration balance was positive in 2023 (+10,726). 44,006 immigrations and 33,280 emigrations were registered that year. Of the immigrants and emigrants, 2,417 and 1,625 respectively had the Ukrainian nationality.\n\nThe internal migration balance was positive (+3,896). So in 2023, there were more people moving from another region to Wallonia (24,548) than people moving from Wallonia to another region (20,652).\n\nSo the population growth in 2023 in Wallonia is the result of a positive internal migration balance and a positive international migration balance. These migration balances offset a negative natural balance.\n\nEvolution of the population in the Brussels-Capital Region\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, the year 2023 was marked by a population growth of 0.68% or 8,422 inhabitants (compared to an average of 0.73% over the last 10 years).\n\nBrussels was the only region where the natural balance remained positive in 2023 (+5,404). 13,987 births and 8,583 deaths were recorded that year. Despite the still positive natural balance, a downward trend in that balance is also seen in Brussels. The decline here is also driven by a downward trend in the number of births.\n\nThe international migration balance was positive in 2023 (+21,443). 56,166 immigrations and 34,723 emigrations were registered that year. Of the immigrants and emigrants, 3,036 and 954 respectively had the Ukrainian nationality.\n\nThe internal migration balance was negative (-18,752). So in 2023, there were fewer people moving from another region to Brussels (25,023) than people moving from Brussels to another region (43,775).\n\nSo the population growth in the Brussels-Capital Region in 2023 is the result of a positive natural balance and a positive international migration balance. These balances offset a negative internal migration balance.\n\nPopulation development in the provinces\n\nThe province with the highest growth in Belgium in 2023 was again Antwerp with a population growth of 0.81%. The four other provinces of the top 5 are all in the Flemish Region. Flemish Brabant ranks second (0.78%), followed by East Flanders (0.68%), Limburg (0.57%) and West Flanders (0.52%).\n\nThe five provinces registering the lowest growth rates are located in the Walloon Region. These provinces all register a positive population growth: Luxembourg (0.40%), Namur (0.33%), LiÃ¨ge (0.32%), Walloon Brabant (0.29%) and finally Hainaut (0.23%).\n\nPopulation movement in 2023 in Belgium, the regions and the provinces"
