        "text": "Province de Hainaut\n\nRégion wallonne\n\nFrench name Hainaut an evolution of Middle Dutch Henegau/Henegou (\"Haine region\"; the Modern Dutch for Hainaut is Henegouwen)* from Dutch name Hene (the Haine River) + noun gau/gou (area, region, shire).\n\nThe Haine River was first attested in Late Latin as Hangna and variously spelled Hagna or Haina in Medieval Latin texts up to the 12th Century, the loss of the -g- influenced by French. The origin and meaning is unknown with any certainty, but considered to be linked to the same Proto-West-Germanic source as Dutch heg, German Hecke (both meaning \"hedge\") and English hedge itself. Borrowed also through Frankish into Medieval Latin as haga, itself the source of French haie (hedge). This would make the sense of Haine a \"river flowing through the hedgeland/woodland\".\n\nMiddle Dutch gau/gou (Modern Dutch gouw) from a Proto-West-Germanic source with the same meaning; compare GermanGau (historically \"district, territory\" but under the Nazis an administrative unit of the Third Reich) and Old English suffix -ge (creating the name of a region or territory); compare the etymology of the English county of Surrey.\n\n* In German, Hainaut is Hennegau.\n\n* English had the variant forms Heynowes and Hainault. The former is now archaic. The latter was also the name of a once extensive forest in Essexand survives as the name of a housing estate in London (though the connection with Hainaut was a mistaken contrivance, or so it would appear).\n\nProvince de Liège\n\nRégion wallonne\n\nNamed for its capital city Liège (Dutch Luik). First attested in the Sixth Century as Late Latin Vicus Leudicus (\"People's Village\"): noun Vicus (hamlet, village) + adjective Leudicus (\"of or pertaining to local inhabitants, population\"). Noun vicus soon dropped away and by Medieval Latin the settlement was known as Leodicum/Leodium (and as Middle Dutch Ludeke/Ludic), the -eodi(c)- element evolving into French -iege.* Adjective Leudicus was clearly a Latinization of a general Germanic** term for \"people\"; compare Dutch plural noun lieden (men, people), German plural noun Leute (people, group of people), Icelandic noun lýður (people, populace, public) and Old English noun leod (people).*** Linked through Proto-Indo-European to (as examples) Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian noun ljudi (men, people) and Lithuanian noun liaudis (people).\n\nA bit of orthographic trivia: until 1946, Liège had been written Liége; the accent was changed from acute to grave to conform to the conventions of French spelling. However, two pronunciations evidently still \"co-exist\" in French: LEE-ayzh and LEE-ezh.\n\n* Compare voyage from Latin viaticum.\n\n** Quite likely an adjective formed from Late/Medieval plural noun leud(es)- (\"people, vassals\"; later variant leodes) + adjective-forming suffix -icus. Noun leudes from Frankish.\n\n*** The German name Luther incorporates this element along with another Germanic element -her (\"army\") to signify something like \"people's army\".\n\nProvince de Namur\n\nRégion wallonne\n\nNamed for its capital city Namur (which is also the regional capital of Wallonia). The origin of name Namur is unknown; it first appears in the 10th-12th Centuries as Medieval Latin Namucho/Namuco. French Namur appears to have evolved out of Medieval Latin variant Namurcum. In Dutch, the city is Namen. One theory suggests element nam- from a Proto-Celtic source for \"valley\".* However, other theories posit a Germanic origin, possibly as the personal name of a Frankish Merovingian ruler.\n\n* There appears to have been a Celtic oppidum (Roman term for a fortified settlement) on or near the site of Namur, held by the Belgic Aduatuci/Atuatuci tribe, where they were besieged and defeated by Julius Caesar. Though the site went on to become a Roman vicus (a village), the name Nam- does not emerge until post-Roman times."
