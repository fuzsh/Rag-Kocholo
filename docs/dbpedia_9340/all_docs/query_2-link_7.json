        "text": "Athis-Mons\n\nFrance\n\nAthis-Mons, town, southern suburb of Paris, in Essonne département, Île-de-France région, northern France. Athis-Mons lies near the confluence of the Orge and Seine rivers and is bisected by the N7 road artery leading to the centre of Paris. It was ancient Attegais, later Athis-sur-Orge, where a treaty of that name was signed in 1305 by the king of France and the count of Flanders. A Romanesque bell tower survives from the 12th-century Priory of Saint-Denis. Athis-Mons is the site of various industries, including metallurgy and food processing, and economic activity is also linked to Orly Airport (international), which adjoins the town to the north. Pop. (1999) 29,427; (2014 est.) 31,434.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Michael Ray."
