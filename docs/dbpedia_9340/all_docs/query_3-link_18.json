        "text": "Citytrip Mons: 17 Things to do in Mons Belgium\n\nMons was declared the capital of culture in Europe in 2015, and this is one of the reasons why you must visit this city. What culture lovers will love here is that the entire city is like an open-air museum with a lot of street art, and stunning heritage buildings and architecture.\n\nDid you know? Every year on Trinity weekend the city of Mons celebrates the Ducasse de Mons or Doudou festival. This is a mixture of a Catholic ritual and a performance that brings people together.\n\nDoudou has been recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO since November 2005.\n\nGetting to Mons Belgium\n\nMons is located in the Belgian municipality of Wallonia. This city is the capital of the Hainaut Province. The closest airport is Charleroi Airport, which is about 30 minutes away from Mons.\n\nIf you are traveling to Belgium internationally then opt to arrive at the Brussels International Airport – Zaventem. Brussels airport to Mons is about a 60-minute drive away, which makes it perfect for a day trip as well!\n\nIf traveling by public transportation, you can use the SNCB train from the Brussels city center to Mons. The main train station is located a 5-minute walk from the city center. It will also take you an hour (or a little sooner) by train.\n\nFor all of your travel-related questions in the city, you can also reach out to the tourist department at Visit Mons for information or bookings. The location is Grand Place 27, Mons.\n\nCitytrip Mons: 17 Things to do in Mons Belgium\n\nWander Grand Place de Mons\n\nThe best way to explore and experience a city’s pulse is to wander their center. The Grand-Place in Mons is one of the beautiful squares in Belgium.\n\nThe square is filled with cobblestones with stunning buildings lined around it from Gothic to Neo-Classical or Spanish influences. You can easily walk there, admire the architecture, and take a break when tired in one of the cafes at the Grand Place.\n\nGrand Place is very vibrant, and I recommend spending a few hours there.\n\nAddress: Grand Place, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nMons Town Hall and current City Hall\n\nMons Town Hall is located at the Grand Place. It was built in the Gothic style in the 15th century. Head there and admire the architecture, and the bronze banister in front of its facade, representing St George and the dragon!\n\nAlso, visit the interiors and explore the Wedding Hall, the Council Chamber with its stunning fireplace, and the Sacquiaux Room along with the Portrait Room and the Gothic Hall.\n\nYou can opt for guided tours of the Town Hall by appointment only.\n\nThe new Mons’ City Hall is located at the town’s Grand Place too and is flanked by Toison d’Or House and the Chapel of St. George.\n\nBe sure to check out the Guardhouse Monkey located near the entrance of Mons City hall, it is believed that petting this little monkey with your left hand will bring good luck.\n\nAddress: Grand Place, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nDoudou Museum\n\nDoudou Museum is dedicated to the popular folk festival called the “Ducasse de Mons ” aka 2 and a half-day religious procession and feast.\n\nEvery year over Trinity weekend, the people of Mons pay tribute to Sainte Waudru and witness their legendary battle known as Lumeçon. Doudou is considered as a sacred event in Mons, and this is treated as the start of something new, of celebrations.\n\nThis museum covers the event in 2 parts, the procession dedicated to the patron saint of Mons, St Waltrude, and later the “re-enactment” of a fight between St. George and the dragon (festival of dragon fight).\n\nThe museum is very interesting and perfect for the young and the old. They are open every day except Mondays, from 10:00 am to 06:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Grand Place, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nGo biking around town\n\nOne of the coolest ways to explore Mons is on a bike. You can rent a bike, plus all the required accessories to stay safe and comfortable on the tour.\n\nThere are 2 types of bikes to choose from\n\nclassic bicycles: € 5 for 2 hours, € 8 for 4 hours and € 10/day\n\nelectric bicycles: € 10 for 2 hours, € 16 for 4 hours, and € 20/day\n\nYou can plan various cycling tours on the Vhello website. Here you will find more information about the network in the heart of Hainaut.\n\nYou can find more information here.\n\nThe Belfry of Mons – Beffroi de Mons\n\nMons Belfry has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is one of the belfries that graces the Belgian skies with a height of 87 meters and it almost follows you everywhere you go at the center.\n\nAddress: Parc du Château, 7000 Mons\n\nLe Mundaneum\n\nThe Mundaneum is a landmark institution that classifies and organizes the world’s knowledge into a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was originally created in Brussels but is located in Mons today.\n\nInside the complex, there are exhibitions centered around knowledge, a plethora of archives, and other educational resources.\n\nLe Mundaneum is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Weekends – they are open from 11:00 am to 06:00 pm, and Wednesdays to Fridays from 01:00 pm to 05:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Rue de Nimy 76, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nLearn World War history at Mons Memorial Museum\n\nMons Memorial Museum is a museum dedicated to exhibits from World War I and II. You can visit the museum and find valuable information about the wars and enrich your knowledge.\n\nIf you didn’t know this already, Mons is located at a strategic crossroad of Europe, which has often made it the scene of historic conflicts. In 1914 (World War I), Mons was the location of the Battle of Mons when the town was occupied by the Germans and stayed this way until liberated by the Canadian Corps towards the end of the war.\n\nThe museum is open every day except Mondays, from 10:00 am to 06:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Boulevard Dolez 51, 7000 Mons\n\nExplore the Havre Castle\n\nJust outside the city center is Havre Castle. This is a ruined castle that had undergone several rounds of renovations in the 12th and 13th centuries by its owners – the Enghien and Croÿ families.\n\nThe castle is a fortress surrounded by moats with a beautiful inner courtyard, an onion-shaped dome, and a chapel on site.\n\nThe site is open every day from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm on weekdays and from 02:00 pm to 06:00 pm on weekends.\n\nAddress: Rue du Château 30, 7021 Mons, Belgium\n\nSaint Waltrude Church\n\nSaint Waltrude Church is a Catholic church dedicated to Saint Waltrude of Mons. The old church is a protected monument in Belgium. It traces its origins to the year 1450, and this is where you can find the ‘car d’Or.\n\nThe climb of the Car d’Or brings the procession of the Châsse de Sainte-Waudru to an end during the Doudou festival.\n\nAddress: Pl. du Chapitre, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nCheck out Van Gogh House\n\nVan Gogh House was home to the Dutch painter – Vincent van Gogh. He lived here for about 14 months, from 1879 to 1880. It is in this abode that Van Gogh developed his design and painting skills.\n\nThis house was abandoned and left for years in ruins, and later restored to allow visitors to explore.\n\nWhen you are at the house you can go on a self-guided tour or join a guide. This Van Gogh House resembles close to what the actual house looks like. The house has two rooms, one downstairs and upstairs filled with historical bits of information spread all throughout the house.\n\nYou will also find reproductions of sketches and leftover paintwork by the artist himself. The only original work by Van Gogh can be found in “De Spitters” and it can also be viewed in the ‘Artotheek’.\n\nThere is also a walking trail located near the house that visitors are allowed to use. They are open every day except Monday, from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Rue Du Pavillon 3, 7033 Cuesmes\n\nDecorative Arts Museum Francois Duesberg\n\nMuseum François Duesberg is a recent museum added to highly rated tourist attractions in Mons Belgium.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt 12, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nSt Symphorien military cemetery\n\nSt Symphorien Cemetery is a military cemetery that was built by the Germans in 1916. There you will find graves of German and British soldiers who lost their lives while liberating Mons (in 1918).\n\nBecause of the nature of the cemetery, it sends a strong message (German and British soldiers buried in the same cemetery – war is never a good thing) and this is a First World War Commonwealth War Graves site.\n\nAddress: Rue Nestor Dehon 32, 7030 Mons, Belgium\n\nGrand Large\n\nLocated close to Mons is an artificial lake called the Grand Large. The lake is situated between Paris and Brussels, so it is a perfect road trip stop when you visit either cities or just hang out in Mons.\n\nThe lake is linked to two canals: Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes Canal (to the east), and the Canal du Centre (to the west). Just enjoy the lovely views, bring a picnic basket, and relax.\n\nLe Grand Hornu\n\nThis is another UNESCO heritage site located in a town named Hornu, near Mons. It is an architectural landmark in the Belgian industrial space tracing its past to coal mining. This site is a great example of functional town planning.\n\nGrand Hornu consists of two museums today, CID (Centre d’Innovation & de Design) & MACS (Musée des Arts contemporains) where you can learn about its history and check out temporary exhibitions. The Industrial Revolution and coal mining made Mons a center of heavy industry.\n\nAddress: Rue Sainte-Louise 82, 7301 Boussu, Belgium\n\nPlaces to eat in Mons on your city trip\n\nIn Mons, you will find a variety of restaurants and cafes..
