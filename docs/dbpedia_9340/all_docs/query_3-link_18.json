What culture lovers will love here is that the entire city is like an open-air museum with a lot of street art, and stunning heritage buildings and architecture.\n\nDid you know? Every year on Trinity weekend the city of Mons celebrates the Ducasse de Mons or Doudou festival. This is a mixture of a Catholic ritual and a performance that brings people together.\n\nDoudou has been recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO since November 2005.\n\nGetting to Mons Belgium\n\nMons is located in the Belgian municipality of Wallonia. This city is the capital of the Hainaut Province. The closest airport is Charleroi Airport, which is about 30 minutes away from Mons.\n\nIf you are traveling to Belgium internationally then opt to arrive at the Brussels International Airport ‚Äì Zaventem.

It will also take you an hour (or a little sooner) by train.\n\nFor all of your travel-related questions in the city, you can also reach out to the tourist department at Visit Mons for information or bookings. The location is Grand Place 27, Mons.\n\nCitytrip Mons: 17 Things to do in Mons Belgium\n\nWander Grand Place de Mons\n\nThe best way to explore and experience a city‚Äôs pulse is to wander their center. The Grand-Place in Mons is one of the beautiful squares in Belgium.\n\nThe square is filled with cobblestones with stunning buildings lined around it from Gothic to Neo-Classical or Spanish influences. You can easily walk there, admire the architecture, and take a break when tired in one of the cafes at the Grand Place.\n\nGrand Place is very vibrant, and I recommend spending a few hours there.\n\nAddress: Grand Place, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nMons Town Hall and current City Hall\n\nMons Town Hall is located at the Grand Place. It was built in the Gothic style in the 15th century.

Doudou is considered as a sacred event in Mons, and this is treated as the start of something new, of celebrations.\n\nThis museum covers the event in 2 parts, the procession dedicated to the patron saint of Mons, St Waltrude, and later the ‚Äúre-enactment‚Äù of a fight between St. George and the dragon (festival of dragon fight).\n\nThe museum is very interesting and perfect for the young and the old. They are open every day except Mondays, from 10:00 am to 06:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Grand Place, 7000 Mons, Belgium\n\nGo biking around town\n\nOne of the coolest ways to explore Mons is on a bike.

You can visit the museum and find valuable information about the wars and enrich your knowledge.\n\nIf you didn‚Äôt know this already, Mons is located at a strategic crossroad of Europe, which has often made it the scene of historic conflicts. In 1914 (World War I), Mons was the location of the Battle of Mons when the town was occupied by the Germans and stayed this way until liberated by the Canadian Corps towards the end of the war.\n\nThe museum is open every day except Mondays, from 10:00 am to 06:00 pm.\n\nAddress: Boulevard Dolez 51, 7000 Mons\n\nExplore the Havre Castle\n\nJust outside the city center is Havre Castle.

He lived here for about 14 months, from 1879 to 1880. It is in this abode that Van Gogh developed his design and painting skills.\n\nThis house was abandoned and left for years in ruins, and later restored to allow visitors to explore.\n\nWhen you are at the house you can go on a self-guided tour or join a guide. This Van Gogh House resembles close to what the actual house looks like. The house has two rooms, one downstairs and upstairs filled with historical bits of information spread all throughout the house.\n\nYou will also find reproductions of sketches and leftover paintwork by the artist himself.

There you will find graves of German and British soldiers who lost their lives while liberating Mons (in 1918).\n\nBecause of the nature of the cemetery, it sends a strong message (German and British soldiers buried in the same cemetery ‚Äì war is never a good thing) and this is a First World War Commonwealth War Graves site.\n\nAddress: Rue Nestor Dehon 32, 7030 Mons, Belgium\n\nGrand Large\n\nLocated close to Mons is an artificial lake called the Grand Large.
