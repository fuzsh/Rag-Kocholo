Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Physical Location Map of Mons).\n\nPhysical map\n\nPhysical map illustrates the mountains, lowlands, oceans, lakes and rivers and other physical landscape features of Mons. Differences in land elevations relative to the sea level are represented by color.\n\nGreen color represents lower elevations, orange or brown indicate higher elevations, shades of grey are used for the highest mountain ranges in the world. Underwater topography is represented by blues. Darker blues are used for the deepest water, lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the continental shelf.\n\nMap projection of the location map\n\nThe location map of Mons combines two projections: the orthographic azimuthal projection for the globe and the simple geographic projection for the rectangular part of the map. Geographic projection has straight meridians and parallels, each degree of latitude and longitude is the same size over the entire world map.\n\nThe orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from infinite distance. It was already known to the Egyptians and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. It gives the appearance of the Earth viewed from outer space. Only one hemisphere can be viewed at a time. The globe centered on Mons appears more realistic than almost any other projection.\n\nTechnology\n\nWe unlock the value hidden in the geographic data. Thanks to automating the complex process of turning data into map graphics, we are able to create maps in higher quality, faster and cheaper than was possible before.\n\nForever free\n\nWe created Maphill to make the web a more beautiful place.

Maps are assembled and kept in a high resolution vector format throughout the entire process of their creation.\n\nExperience of discovering\n\nMaphill maps will never be as detailed as Google maps or as precise as designed by professional cartographers. Our goal is different. We want to redefine the experience of discovering the world through the maps.\n\nFast anywhere\n\nMaps are served from a large number of servers spread all over the world. Globally distributed map delivery network ensures low latency and fast loading times, no matter where on Earth you happen to be.\n\nSpread the beauty\n\nEmbed the above physical location map of Mons into your website.
