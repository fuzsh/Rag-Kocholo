        "text": "The city of Bergen has a beautiful historic center. During your holiday in Bergen, a visit to the Grote Markt should not be missed. In this beautiful square, next to beautiful buildings, there are several cafes and terraces. In the summer or if the weather permits, you can relax on the terraces on the square, which give the square a cozy atmosphere.\n\nThe city of Mons has approximately one hundred thousand inhabitants and is the capital of the southern province of Hainaut. The province lies largely in the old county of Hainaut. The county was made its own in 1024, it was governed by a count until it later joined the Netherlands. If you are a nature lover, you can indulge yourself. There is plenty of nature to visit during the Hainaut holiday.\n\nDuring your holiday in Hainaut, Belgium you can discover different nature reserves. Although the Ardennes nature reserve does not continue in Hainaut, there is plenty of nature for walking, cycling and sailing. This is all possible in the Lakes of the Eau d’Heure area. Located on the border between Hainaut and Namur, you will find the largest wetland area in Belgium: the ideal place to relax in nature.\n\nIn addition to special areas with a lot of water, you will find many forest and hill areas, ponds and bicycle paths during a holiday in Mons in Hainaut. Wherever you are in the province, nature is close by. So there are many walking routes that you can take during your holiday in Bergen.\n\nIf you are on holiday in Bergen, the Grote Markt is one of the must-sees. For example, you will find the Hotel de Ville that is centrally located on the Grote Markt. The town hall dates from the 15th century and is the most beautiful building in the city. Characteristic are the traditional wooden doors and the special turret, which match the Gothic architectural style. There is also a bronze statue of a monkey next to the entrance. According to the legend of Bergen, your wish will come true when you pet the monkey over the head with your left hand.\n\nWhen you walk through the gate of the town hall, you will find yourself in the Garden of the Mayor. The small, but unique courtyard garden is worth a visit during your holiday in Bergen. In the garden is the Doudou museum, which is completely devoted to the Doudou festival.\n\nThis festival is an annual event that, on the one hand, looks back on the terrible time when Bergen was hit by the plague. At the same time, it celebrates the health of the population. If you are on holiday in Bergen on the first Sunday after Pentecost, be sure to take a look at the Doudou festival. About sixty different groups all dressed in medieval garb, take part in parade. The Doudou festival has been added to the UNESCO list of oral and intangible heritage.\n\nThe city of Mons is called Mons in French. The sights Mons, Belgium are therefore the same as those of a holiday in Mons. In line with the French-speaking world, it can be fun to visit northern France during your Hainaut holiday. Mons is a stone’s throw from France: the country is only about fifteen kilometers away. In addition to the great French influence on the province of Hainaut, there is also Dutch blood. One of Mons Belgium’s sights is the Maison van Gogh. The well-known Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh lived in this house for a year."
