If Caid is indeed a jewel of the Knowne World, than it is so because each brilliant facet sparkles with the passion of the subjects of the Canton of Mons Draconis.\n\nAt each and every event, we come together as fellow Caidans to celebrate anew our joy in the Medieval and Renaissance worlds and to recreate the very best of those worlds. This, you have most certainly done through your support. As defined in the 14th century one of the four cardinal virtues is fortitude, and because of you Caid has the fortitude to overcome any misfortune. Thank you again, for joining with Us and for demonstrating your steadfast commitment to Caid.\n\nIn Service to The Realm,\n\nFransisc Rex; Seanachie Regina\n\nMemories of the Founding Groups\n\nThe idea of the Canton got going because at the time we had Gallavally, Desert March and we had the guys in the desert (Steinsee). But we had nothing going on out here, so the people in Riverside wanted to have something more active and a little more dynamic. So they thought that a Canton out here would be a good idea just so that we could have a place where people could get actively involved. And I don’t know why there was so much resistance, but there was a whole lot of resistance from the Barony (of Dreiburgen). I do recall that there was a lot of dissention over the idea of, well, you just want to become a Shire so you can split off. That was one of the big fights, and I had to say, no, we are a support unit for Dreiburgen. Our whole idea was to be able to bring people in, give them training and skills and keep things going – which I think we did very well. Now at the time, we had the Dragon’s Tale going on at Finn Mathie’s. We had a LOT of activity. A lot of stuff was going on out here... Finn stepped down while we were still in our early incipiency, and he came to me and said, I’m stepping down will you take the job? So I took the job through to just before we got our formal status. I stepped down and Marie de Womwell took it for about two years, then I came back for about two years. So I was seneschal for our incipiency, and two years under our formal status. ~condensed from an interview with Carolus von Eulenhorst on May 24th, 2018, by Eadwynne of Runedun."
