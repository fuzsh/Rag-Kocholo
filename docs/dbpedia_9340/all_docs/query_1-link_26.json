        "text": "The Count of Hainaut was the ruler of the county of Hainaut.\n\n· Reginar I (900-915)\n\n· Reginar II (915-after 932)\n\n· Reginar III (940-958) 939 swore fealty to the King to be confirmed as Count\n\nThe county was divided between Mons and Valenciennes in 958 after Reginar III’s exiled to Bohemia.\n\nIn Roman Imperial times, Hainaut was for the most part situated in the civitas of the Belgic Nervii. As the empire lost control, the entire region came under the lordship of the Salian Franks. By the time of Charlemagne, the Frankish empire had been declared a new “Holy” Roman Empire.\n\nThe County of Hainaut was formally established about 900 in the Lotharingian part of the Frankish ruled lands, when Duke Reginar I of Lorraine, a grandson of Frankish Emperor Lothair I, took the title “Count of Hainaut”. After the death of the last Carolingian king in East Francia, Louis the Child in 911, Duke Reginar joined the West Frankish realm under King Charles the Simple. His son and successor, Duke Gilbert, in turn submitted himself to the German king Henry the Fowler in 925, where after the Duchy of Lotharingia remained a part of the eastern Frankish kingdom which would become Germany, but on the border with the western kingdom which would become France.\n\nFollowing Gilbert’s death in 939, his successors from the House of Reginar failed to retain the ducal title, but continued to rule over the Hainaut region. After Count Reginar III had unsuccessfully rebelled against Duke Bruno the Great, he was deposed and banned in 958, at which time the county was then divided between the Count Mons and the Margrave of Valenciennes. However, in 998 the Reginars regained partial control as the Count of Mons, which they held until the death of Count Herman in 1051. On the re-marriage of Count Herman’s widow to Count Baldwin of Flanders Mons passed to the House of Flanders who had already acquired Valenciennes, thus the County of Hainaut was once again united."
