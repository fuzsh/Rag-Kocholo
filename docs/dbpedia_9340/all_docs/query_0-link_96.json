It changes the Flemish name of Brussels Capital Region to include the generic term Gewest.\n\nThe latest version of the FIPS standard is called \"Geopolitical Entities and Codes\", published in 2010-04. It shows Belgium divided into three regions, coded as shown under \"Further subdivisions\" below.\n\nThe NUTS code scheme was revised in 2003. The code for Brussels Capital Region changed from BE1 to BE10.\n\nErratum: In \"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\", I gave \"Région de Bruxelles-Capital\" as the French name of Brussels Capital Region. It should have been spelled with a final e, \"Région de Bruxelles-Capitale\".\n\nChange Notice 7 to FIPS PUB 10-4 is dated 2002-01-10. It changes the FIPS codes for Brabant. In 1995, Brabant was split into three province-level subdivisions: Brussels Capital Region, Flemish Brabant, and Walloon Brabant. The FIPS code BE02 continued to apply to all three of those divisions, and I listed it on each of the three lines in the book. Now, that code has been replaced by the codes BE11 for Brussels Capital Region, BE12 for Flemish Brabant, and BE10 for Walloon Brabant.\n\nInternational standard ISO 3166-2 was published on 1998-12-15. It superseded ISO/DIS 3166-2 (draft international standard). For Belgium, the draft standard showed BXL as the code for Brussels Capital Region. In the final standard, this code has been changed to BRU.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameBELGIUM ISO codeBE FIPS codeBE LanguagesFlemish (nl), French (fr) Time zone+1 ~ CapitalBrussels\n\nNote: Flemish is the name for Dutch as spoken in Belgium.\n\nBelgium has been independent throughout the 20th century, except during the German invasions of the two World Wars. It has undergone relatively minor transfers of territory in the aftermath of those wars. The provinces trace their origins to nine departments imposed by France in 1795. The regions originated with a constitutional reform in 1967-1971.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Belgien\n\nDutch: België, Koninkrijk België (formal)\n\nEnglish: Kingdom of Belgium (formal)\n\nFinnish: Belgia\n\nFrench: Belgique, Royaume m de Belgique f (formal)\n\nGerman: Belgien n\n\nIcelandic: Belgía\n\nItalian: Belgio m\n\nNorwegian: Belgia, Kongeriket Belgia (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Bélgica, Reino m da Bélgica f (formal)\n\nRussian: Королевство Бельгия (formal)\n\nSpanish: Bélgica, Reino m de Bélgica f (formal)\n\nSwedish: Belgien\n\nTurkish: Belçika, Belçika Krallığı (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nCalled Gallia Belgica by Romans, after an ethnic name\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nBelgium is divided into ten provinces (Flemish: provincies) and one capital region (Flemish: hoofdstedelijke gewest; French: région capitale).\n\nDivision HASC ISO FIPS NUTS INS Population Area(km.²) Area(mi.²) Capital RegionPostal codes Antwerp BE.ANVANBE01BE21101,744,862 2,867 1,107 Antwerp VLG 2000-2999 Brussels BE.BUBRUBE11BE10211,089,538 161 62 BrusselsBRU 1000-1299 East Flanders BE.OVVOVBE08BE23401,432,326 2,982 1,151 Ghent VLG 9000-9999 Flemish BrabantBE.VBVBRBE12BE24201,076,924 2,106 814 Leuven VLG 1500-1999, 3000-3499 Hainaut BE.HTWHTBE03BE32501,309,880 3,787 1,462 Mons WAL 6000-6599, 7000-7999 Liege BE.LGWLGBE04BE33601,067,685 3,862 1,491 Liege WAL 4000-4999 Limburg BE.LIVLIBE05BE2270838,505 2,422 935 Hasselt VLG 3500-3999 Luxembourg BE.LXWLXBE06BE3480269,023 4,441 1,715 Arlon WAL 6600-6900 Namur BE.NAWNABE07BE3590472,281 3,665 1,415 Namur WAL 5000-5999 Walloon BrabantBE.BWWBRBE10BE3120379,515 1,091 421 Wavre WAL 1300-1499 West Flanders BE.WVVWVBE09BE25301,159,366 3,134 1,210 Brugge VLG 8000-8999 11 divisions 10,839,90530,51811,783\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nISO: Codes from ISO 3166-2.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4 (superseded).\n\nNUTS: Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics.\n\nINS: Codes assigned by the National Statistics Institute for the 1991 census.

Postal codes in the provinces recently formed from Brabant\n\ndon't correspond neatly to the new province boundaries. Note: postal codes for Belgian addresses can be\n\nidentified by prefixing them with \"B-\".\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Arrondissements of Belgium page.\n\nBelgium is divided into three regions (gewesten, régions). When they were created in 1970, Brabant was divided among all three regions; in 1995, it was split, and now each region contains provincial-level units as shown in the region column in the table above. Here is a list of the regions.\n\nISORegionFIPSNUTSPredominant language BRUBrussels Capital RegionBE11BE1Both VLGFlemish RegionBE13BE2Flemish WALWalloniaBE14BE3French\n\nBelow the provinces, there are 43 arrondissements. Under the arrondissements, there are communes. Before 1977, they were changed often, but the number of communes remained close to 2,500. On 1977-01-01, an act for the amalgamation of communes took effect. The old communes were merged in various ways, creating 589 new and larger communes.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThere is a cluster of 22 exclaves belonging to Antwerp province inside the Netherlands, about 2 km. from the Belgian border. It constitutes the town of Baarle-Hertog.\n\nHainaut is split into two parts by a strip of French territory. The western part is much smaller. Comines is its largest city.\n\nLimburg is split into two parts by a strip of Dutch territory. The eastern part is much smaller. It is the commune of Fourons.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Belgium lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nAntwerp: from Germanic anda werpum: at the jetty\n\nBrabant: Old High German bracha: new country, bant: region\n\nBrussels: Middle Dutch broec: swamp, sele: castle\n\nFlanders: possibly from Flemish vlakte: plain, wanderen: wander.\n\nHainaut: Haine River, with German suffix -gau: district\n\nLiege: from Latin læticæ: plantations owned by læti (immigrants)\n\nLimburg: Germanic lindo: linden, burg: fort.\n\nLuxembourg: Germanic luttila: little, burg: fort.\n\nWallonia: land of Walloons, from Germanic walhon: foreigner.\n\nChange history:\n\n1920-01-20: The Treaty of Versailles granted three German cantons (Eupen, Malmédy, and Saint Vith) to Belgium. Although geographically separated from it, they were annexed to Limburg. Also annexed was a sliver of land which had been neutral territory since the Napoleonic Wars. This was Moresnet, adjacent to Eupen.\n\n1923: Two communes were transferred from East Flanders to Antwerp, constituting all of the present territory of Antwerp west of the Scheldt River.\n\n~1932: Eupen, Malmédy, and Saint Vith transferred from Limburg to Liege.\n\n1946-09-17: Official French spelling of Liege changed from Liége to Liège.\n\n1962-11-08: Administrative reform law changed numerous boundaries. The arrondissement of Mouscron was created and transferred from West Flanders to Hainaut. The town of Landen was transferred from Liege to Brabant. Fourons was transferred from Liege to Limburg. The arrondissement of Brussels was split into Brussels-Capital, Brussels-Suburbs, and Halle-Vilvoorde. The provinces of East Flanders and Limburg were also affected.\n\n1970: Brussels-Suburbs arrondissement annexed to Halle-Vilvoorde arrondissement. The three modern regions were defined geographically, but not given administrative functions.\n\n1980: Regional governments formed for the Flemish Region and Wallonia.\n\n1989: Regional government formed for Brussels capital region.\n\n1993-11-01: Under the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union replaced the European Communities, of which Belgium was a member.\n\n1995-01-01: Brabant province divided into Brussels capital region, Flemish Brabant province, and Walloon Brabant province.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nNote: the Flemish language is basically the same as Dutch.\n\nAntwerp: Amberes (Spanish); Antuérpia (Portuguese); Antwerpen (Dutch, Finnish, German, Norwegian, Swedish); Anvers (French); Anversa (Italian); Антверпен (Russian)\n\nBrabant: Brabante (Italian, Portuguese, Spanish)\n\nBrussels: Brüksel (Turkish); Bruselas (Spanish); Brussel (Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian); Brussel Hoofstadt, Brussels Hoofdstedelijk, Brusselse Hoofdstedelijke Gewest (Dutch); Hauptstadtregion Brüssel (German); Bruxelas (Portuguese); Bruxelles (Italian); Bryssel (Danish, Finnish, Swedish); Brysselin pääkaupunkialue (Finnish); Région de Bruxelles-Capitale (French); Брюссель (Russian)\n\nEast Flanders: Fiandra Orientale (Italian); Flandes Oriental (Spanish); Flandre orientale (French); Flandres Oriental (Portuguese); Itä-Flanderi (Finnish); Oost-Vlaanderen (Dutch); Ostflandern (German); Östflandern (Swedish); Øst-Flandern (Norwegian); Østflanderen (Danish)\n\nFlemish Brabant: Brabante Fiammingo (Italian); Brabante Flamenco (Spanish); Brabante Flamengo (Portuguese); Brabant flamand (French); Flaamien Brabant (Finnish); flamländska Brabant (Swedish); Flamsk Brabant (Danish); Flämisch-Brabant (German); Vlaams Brabant (Dutch)\n\nFlemish Region: Flandre, Région flamande (French); Região Flamenga (Portuguese); Región Flamenga (Spanish); Region Flandern (German); Vlaanderen, Vlaams Gewest (Dutch)\n\nHainaut: Henao (Spanish); Henegouwen (Dutch); Hennegau (German)\n\nLiege: Liège (Danish, Finnish, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish); Liége (obsolete); Liegi (Italian); Lieja (Portuguese-variant, Spanish); Luik (Dutch); Lüttich (German); Люттих (Russian)\n\nLimburg: Limbourg (Danish, French, Norwegian); Limburgo (Italian, Portuguese, Spanish)\n\nLuxembourg: Lussemburgo (Italian); Luxemburg (Dutch, German, Swedish); Luxemburgo (Portuguese, Spanish)\n\nNamur: Namen (Dutch)\n\nWallonia: Região Valona, Valónia (Portuguese-Portugal); Region Wallonien (German); Valônia (Portuguese-Brazil); Waals Gewest, Wallonië (Dutch); Walenland (obsolete-Dutch); Wallonie, Région wallonne (French)\n\nWalloon Brabant: Brabante Valão (Portuguese); Brabant wallon (French); Vallonian Brabant (Finnish); Waals Brabant (Dutch); Wallonisch-Brabant (German)\n\nWest Flanders: Fiandra Occidentale (Italian); Flandes Occidental (Spanish); Flandre occidentale (French); Flandres Ocidental (Portuguese); Länsi-Flanderi (Finnish); Västflandern (Swedish); Vest-Flandern (Norwegian); Vestflanderen (Danish); Westflandern (German); West-Vlaanderen (Dutch)\n\nPopulation history:\n\nProvince1910-12-31c1930c1938e1947-12-31c1955-12-31e1961-12-31c1970-12-31c1982e1990-01-01e Antwerp968,6771,173,3631,254,2421,281,3331,362,9081,443,0001,533,2491,577,2461,597,310 Brabant1,469,6771,680,0651,771,0381,798,4681,887,7822,009,0002,176,3732,221,3832,243,026 East Flanders1,120,3351,149,1991,192,0341,217,2801,249,4351,272,0001,310,1171,332,2651,331,608 Hainaut1,232,8671,270,2311,238,5371,224,8001,261,1251,317,0001,317,4531,291,6101,278,039 Liege888,341973,031972,481963,851994,185992,0001,008,905995,576998,213 Limburg275,691367,642416,547460,446528,123572,000652,547724,032745,034 Luxembourg231,215220,920219,566213,478216,394217,000217,310222,784230,827 Namur362,846355,965356,198356,090394,125369,000380,561408,741421,224 West Flanders874,135901,588965,910996,4491,032,169998,0001,054,4291,084,3801,102,501 9 provinces7,423,7848,092,0048,386,5538,512,1958,926,2469,189,0009,650,9449,858,0179,947,782\n\nAfter each date, c = census; e = estimate\n\nProvince1995-01-012000-01-012005-01-012010-01-01 Antwerp1,628,7101,643,9721,676,8581,744,862 Brussels951,580959,3181,006,7491,089,538 East Flanders1,349,3821,361,6231,380,0721,432,326 Flemish Brabant995,2661,014,7041,037,7861,076,924 Hainaut1,286,6491,279,4671,286,2751,309,880 Liège1,015,0071,019,4421,034,0241,067,685 Limbourg771,613791,178809,942838,505 Luxembourg240,281246,820256,004269,023 Namur434,446443,903455,863472,281 Walloon Brabant336,505349,884363,776379,515 West Flanders1,121,1351,128,7741,138,5031,159,366 Total10,130,57410,239,08510,445,85210,839,905\n\nSources:"
