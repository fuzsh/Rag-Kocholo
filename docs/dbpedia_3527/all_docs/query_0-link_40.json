Cutting back on sleep can have significant negative effects on mental, physical, and emotional health with short- and long-term consequences.\n\nUnderstanding sleep procrastination, including its symptoms, causes, and consequences, can help you recognize when you’re engaging in it. Then, you can take steps to prevent bedtime procrastination from leading to insufficient sleep.\n\nWhat Behaviors Are Associated With Bedtime Procrastination?\n\nThree factors are required for a late sleep time to be considered bedtime procrastination Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source :\n\nA delay in going to sleep that reduces one’s total sleep time\n\nThe absence of a valid reason for staying up later than intended, such as an external event or an underlying illness\n\nAn awareness that delaying one’s bedtime could lead to negative consequences\n\nBedtime procrastination behaviors reflect procrastination in other contexts Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , such as avoiding doing homework or household chores. Procrastinating on sleep doesn’t usually generate negative associations like those other obligations, however. Instead, sleep may be curtailed in favor of activities that offer more immediate enjoyment, such as watching TV, spending time with friends, or playing video games.\n\nSleep procrastination can take different forms. One form involves delaying the act of getting into bed. Another is delaying the time of trying to fall asleep once in bed, a problem that has been associated with rising rates of electronic device use in bed. A person may engage in one or both forms of sleep procrastination, each of which can reduce nightly sleep.\n\nWhat Does Revenge Have To Do With It?\n\nRevenge bedtime procrastination refers to the decision to delay sleep in response to stress or a lack of free time earlier in the day.\n\nThe addition of the word “revenge” to the concept of bedtime procrastination became popular on social media . The English term “revenge bedtime procrastination” emerged from a translation of an expression in Chinese that reflected frustration tied to long, stressful work hours that left little time for personal enjoyment.\n\nIn this way, bedtime procrastination is seen as a way of getting “revenge” on daytime hours with little or no free time. Though initially expressed by people in China, the idea has resonated across the globe and gained additional traction in response to stress induced by COVID-19.\n\nWhat Is the Psychology Behind Bedtime Procrastination?\n\nSleep procrastination is still an emerging concept in sleep science. As a result, there are ongoing debates about the psychology behind this voluntary sleep reduction.\n\nPeople who engage in bedtime procrastination know and generally want to receive enough sleep, but they fail to actually do so. This is known as an intention-behavior gap Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\nOne explanation for this gap is a failure in self-regulation or self-control. Our capacity for self-control is already at its lowest Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source at the end of the day, which may facilitate sleep procrastination. Some people may be naturally inclined to procrastination in general, including around bedtime. In addition, daytime demands at work or school may reduce the reserves of self-control available in the evening.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this explanation, with some arguing that it places too much emphasis on self-control Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Instead, sleep procrastination may result from people who have an evening chronotype — “night owls” — who are forced to try to adapt to schedules designed for “early birds.” In revenge bedtime procrastination, sacrificing sleep for leisure time may also be seen not as a failure of self-control but rather an attempt to find recovery time in response to stress.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand sleep procrastination, which may be the result of multiple interacting factors Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source including chronotype, daytime stress, and difficulties in self-regulation.\n\nWho Is Most Affected by Bedtime Procrastination?\n\nBecause research about sleep procrastination is still in the early stages, experts aren’t certain who is most affected by it.\n\nThat said, one study found that students and women Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source were most likely to engage in bedtime procrastination. People with an evening chronotype are inclined to stay up later, which may manifest as bedtime procrastination. Sleep procrastination also appears to be more frequent in people who procrastinate in other aspects of their life.\n\nRevenge sleep procrastination appears to be tied to significant daytime stress. For many people, sleep procrastination may be a response to extended work hours that, if combined with a full night’s sleep, leave virtually no time for entertainment or relaxation.\n\nRevenge bedtime procrastination may also be on the rise because of COVID-19 and stress associated with stay-at-home orders. Surveys have found that working from home has often extended working hours , and women, in particular, have had a reduction in normal leisure time since the pandemic started. These factors may trigger stress and sleep procrastination and contribute to the fact that nearly 40% of people Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source have had sleeping problems during the pandemic.\n\nConsequences of Bedtime Procrastination\n\nBedtime procrastination can cause sleep deprivation. Without enough hours of sleep, the mind and body can’t properly recharge, which can have widespread negative effects on health Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\nInsufficient sleep degrades thinking, memory, and decision-making. Sleep deprivation also raises the risk of daytime sleepiness, which can harm productivity and academic achievement while heightening the risks of drowsy driving.\n\nA lack of sleep is tied to irritability and other difficulties regulating emotions. It’s also been connected to mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nSleep deprivation worsens physical health, making people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and metabolic disorders, like diabetes. In addition, and especially concerning in light of COVID-19, insufficient sleep can erode immune function and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\nThe consequences of sleep loss can arise quickly or build up over time, contributing to significant long-term health problems. With sleep procrastination, the effects of sleep deprivation may become even more worrisome. Sleep deprivation has been linked to reduced self-regulation and impulse control, which means that sleep procrastination may become part of a reinforcing negative cycle of reduced sleep and worse overall health.\n\nHow To Prevent Sleep Procrastination\n\nThe best remedy for sleep procrastination is healthy sleep hygiene, which involves creating good sleep habits and an environment conducive to sleep. Remember that it will take more than one night’s sleep to truly get into good sleep habits.\n\nHaving set routines can make behaviors feel almost automatic Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . For this reason, a nighttime routine can reduce the impulse to stay up later instead of going to bed.
