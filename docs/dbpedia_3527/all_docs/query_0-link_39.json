        "text": "Work-related factors\n\nMany types of clinical work are inherently stressful (Reference Payne and Firth-CozensPayne & Firth-Cozens, 1987). Areas where there is a high level of trauma or mortality (accident units, intensive care units, neonatal units) are perhaps the most obvious, but practitioners in all fields have to cope with heavy clinical workloads and ever-increasing administrative demands. Concern has been expressed about the increase of threats and violence from patients and relatives (Health and Safety Executive, 1997). Staff in psychiatric admission units are exposed to high levels of behavioural disturbance, with an increased risk of personal assault (Reference Kho, Sensky and MortimerKho et al, 1998), and those working in the community feel isolated and unsupported (Reference Prosser, Johnson and KuipersProsser et al, 1996). Apart from violence, various other categories of ‘difficult’ patients are recognised, including those with persistent symptoms unresponsive to treatment (‘heartsink’ patients), the litigious and the seductive. Institutional group dynamics at ward, team or unit level might also play a significant part (Reference HaleHale, 1997), but are rarely examined.\n\nClinicians cite a variety of issues as stressors: workload pressures (and their effect on personal life), inadequate resources, inappropriate management techniques, constant reorganisation, role ambiguities and conflict, lack of career progression, inadequate support/supervision and lack of control over personal job circumstances (Reference Williams, Michie and PattaniWilliams et al, 1998). There have also been changes in cultural attitudes towards health professionals over the past 50 years, with an increase in patients’ expectations and criticisms (including litigation) and a reduction in respect and compliance (Reference Burke, Richardson and CooperBurke & Richardson, 1996; Reference RobertsRoberts, 1997; Reference ThompsonThompson, 1998)\n\nPractitioner psychopathology\n\nA number of writers have explored the relationship between health professionals’ psychopathology and their early life experiences. Much of the published work in this area relates to doctors or psychotherapists, but it seems likely that the underlying processes are more widely applicable.\n\nThe decision to study medicine is, like many choices, influenced by both conscious and unconscious factors. Conscious factors usually include academic success with an aptitude for scientific subjects, an interest in a professional career, a general wish to help people and (often) a medical family background. Unconscious components of the decision are clearly difficult to explore, but there is some evidence that doctors make their career choices in early adolescence or even before (Reference AllenAllen, 1988). Lief (1971) suggests that at least a third of medical students are motivated by unconscious neurotic drives and unresolved conflicts from childhood, and a number of writers have suggested that the choice of a medical career may serve as a defence against feelings of anxiety or impotence resulting from the experience of illness or death in family members (Reference Feifel, Hanson and JonesFeifel et al, 1967; Reference PfeifferPfeiffer, 1983; Reference GabbardGabbard, 1985).\n\nSimilarly, the choice of a career in the helping professions may be an attempt to remedy early emotional neglect by taking an opportunity to give the care and attention to others that was never received as a child. Bowlby (1977) describes ‘compulsive care giving’ as a pattern of behaviour seen in people whose early attachments have been unsatisfactory: ‘the typical childhood experience of such people is to have a [parent] who … was unable to care for the child but instead welcomed being cared for … the person who develops in this way has found that the only affectional bond available is the one in which he must always be the care giver, and that the only care he can ever receive is the care he gives himself’.\n\nMalan (1979) refers to the ‘helping profession syndrome’, in which the professional ‘compulsively gives to others what he would like to have for himself, which … leads to a severe deficit in the emotional balance of payments’ (p.139). He speculates that such professionals perceive other people's needs as demands that they try to satisfy. If their attempts are unsuccessful, they render themselves vulnerable to depression.\n\nJohnson (1991) draws on self-psychology to suggest that deficiencies in parenting or the experience during childhood of illness in oneself or in family members might result in a narcissistic disturbance of personality that he characterises as ‘fragile grandiosity’. This type of person is prone to emotional detachment and denial of personal vulnerability, and these personality traits might be reinforced by medical training and professional culture.\n\nSeveral writers (e.g. Reference StorrStorr, 1979; Reference ProdgersProdgers, 1991) have observed that psychotherapists commonly report disturbed attachments to their own parents, especially their mothers, and suggest that this might form a significant unconscious part of their interest in psychotherapy as a profession. In the same vein, Rycroft (1993) has suggested that some people become psychotherapists in order to ablate the memory of their own (unsatisfactory) parents, replacing this with an idealised projection of their own caring. Jacobs (1991) uses the notion of ‘constructive vengeance’ to suggest that many health professionals are motivated in their careers by a desire to put right perceived wrongs of the past, sublimating a wish for revenge into a conscious wish for reparation.\n\nZigmond (1984) introduces an interpersonal perspective, using the theory of transactional analysis as a model. He describes the symbiotic relationship between patient and doctor, in which the doctor has many parent-like qualities and the patient has correspondingly child-like ones. He observes that this relationship can be benign and productive, but that it can also become malignant. He goes on to suggest that factors that motivate us to become doctors might predispose us to the establishment of ‘malignant symbiotic’ relationships with our patients:\n\n‘When we deny powerful needs or impulses in ourselves we will either be intolerant or compulsively solicitous of these attributes in others. If it is the latter then we can professionalise this problem by working in one of the caring professions … our needs may then be fulfilled in an illusory and vicarious way through a state of mutual dependence … [S]uch dependence on our patients for our sense of power, self-esteem, worthiness and vicarious expression of locked up feeling is often not conscious.’\n\nTraining\n\nWe currently have little knowledge of how young people choose a career in health care, although we know that the choice is often made in childhood or early adolescence. The effects of parental and cultural influences are unclear. Career information for young people is fairly restricted and it seems likely that many make their choice with a limited understanding of what is involved. Further research is needed, but meanwhile we must ensure that realistic information is available to potential applicants.\n\nHealth care training is widely recognised as stressful for students: more careful examination of each student's potential vulnerability during the selection process would be helpful, although the results of psychological testing have so far been inconclusive. Given that a previous or family history of mental illness is a positive predictor of vulnerability, screening procedures should include this information. During training, students should be encouraged to recognise and discuss the link between their own life experiences and their career choice, emphasising that their personal vulnerabilities have both positive and negative potential in their careers. Students needing specific psychiatric or psychotherapeutic help should be able to access this readily, and the provision of such treatment should be without detriment to the individual's career.\n\nAfter qualification, self-management skills should be included in postgraduate training programmes and appropriate support should be available on an informal basis. In psychiatry, this should be incorporated in the local training programme, and the trainees’ handbook should contain simple advice and contact information for informal and professional support. Clinical training should include the particular problems of recognising and treating illness in colleagues and this topic should be included in professional examinations.\n\nConsultants and other career grade staff are particularly at risk of institutionalisation and burnout. Programmes of continuing professional development and revalidation procedures for senior staff should include opportunities for personal reflection and self-review. Career breaks should be more widely available or even mandatory, as those most in need of them are those least likely to accept the idea. Mentoring schemes, such as the one for consultant psychiatrists in the South-West region, should be developed more widely.\n\nClinical practice\n\nMost health professionals lead busy, stressful and demanding lives, almost always with significant workload pressure. All practitioners should be encouraged to develop their skills in time management and prioritisation, both to maximise their efficiency and to protect them against burnout. The job descriptions of managers should clearly include a responsibility for maintaining the well-being of their staff as well as supervising their clinical performance. Staff health should be established as a key performance indicator throughout the health service.\n\nPostgraduate case meetings and audit activities are useful opportunities for mutual support and are often used to discuss work with colleagues informally. The inclusion of a session on stress management can offer the opportunity for clinicians of different disciplines and seniority to discuss practical solutions. Appropriate supervision should be included in the job description of all grades of staff (however senior) and can be provided on a hierarchical or peer basis; mentoring schemes are especially useful. Clinical governance and revalidation processes provide a vehicle for monitoring individual and collective performance, and should include a review of work stress.\n\nWorking in a multi-disciplinary team offers considerable opportunities for mutual support and peer supervision, and in a well-functioning team this will often occur on an informal basis. When team dynamics are less fluent (e.g. when hierarchical, inter-disciplinary or inter-agency tensions are evident), it might be helpful to consult with a specialist in interpersonal relationships (perhaps a systems or group analyst), or to arrange a regular staff support group with an external leader. Staff working in areas of especially high stress (e.g. intensive care units, oncology wards, acute psychiatric units) should be offered regular staff support groups led by an appropriately qualified person. Occupational health services should be readily available and should include psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expertise.\n\nThe role of personal therapy or counselling is unfortunately contentious, perhaps epitomising the ambivalent relationship we have with our own vulnerability. Most of us defer seeking personal help until a crisis forces us to do so – it is not yet fashionable, at least in public health services, to be in therapy. As professionals, we tend to think of therapy as a remedial treatment, overlooking its potential as a prophylactic or maintenance activity, analogous to servicing one's car. Therapy offers an opportunity for personal reflection away from the workplace, and also allows a review of the balance between work and other parts of one's personal life.\n\nMany of these resources can be accessed, directly or indirectly, through local psychotherapy departments, most of which are happy to provide both consultative and direct clinical services."
