        "text": "Hey there! I‚Äôm an engineering manager based in Ireland. I‚Äôve worked on products that help people with business intelligence, data visualisation, UX as a Service, billing, and eCommerce. I‚Äôve built and managed co-located and distributed global teams. Empathy is at the heart of my role as a manager.\n\nThis article is a personal one. I‚Äôm writing as an individual, not a manager. It‚Äôs not only for people managers this time - it‚Äôs for everyone. It‚Äôs not a tidy checklist like the articles I‚Äôve shared before; I can‚Äôt promise to reliably help you detect burnout in your team or company. Rather, I hope this article will help you recognise and prevent burnout in yourself, and maybe others. My overarching aim is to help break down the stigma surrounding mental health.\n\nI wanted to focus on burnout as a topic, agnostic of any company I‚Äôve worked in, so there won‚Äôt be any circumstantial details. Suffice to say, specifically in the tech industry, we are largely responsible for our own circumstances. It‚Äôs up to us to bring about change by doing some or all of the following: push back, ask for help, book sick days, or leave. Your workplace may also have support systems in place for mental health that you can consider using.\n\nWhat Is Burnout? üî•\n\nMayo Clinic defines burnout as:\n\n‚Äú[..]a special type of work-related stress ‚Äî a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity.‚Äù Source\n\nBurnout can manifest itself in physical and mental symptoms. It has real effects on your health. Popular medical sites such as WebMD and Mayo Clinic list symptoms and further information.\n\nFor a more fully fledged description with real life examples, watch this talk by James Spivey titled Let‚Äôs Talk About Burnout. James is one of my management role models - I‚Äôm lucky enough to have worked with him. When I burned out most recently, I re-watched his talk and reached out to him. That resulted in me finally taking concrete actions to help myself.\n\nSadly, I have experienced burnout multiple times in my career. I‚Äôve experienced the following symptoms (which may or may not apply to others):\n\nExtreme fatigue/exhaustion\n\nInsomnia\n\nDepression\n\nPanic attacks\n\nOtherwise unexplained body aches (i.e. not caused by exercise or injury)\n\nOtherwise unexplained headaches\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nLess clinical symptoms, sprinkled with some humblebragging, because I don't do it enough üíÉ:\n\nI stopped reading books - I read on average 55 books per year. That‚Äôs almost one a week. Not constantly reading is very unusual for me.\n\nI stopped learning languages - I broke my Duolingo (language learning app) streak of 205 days. I was aiming for one year :(\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I understand now that my energy for the above activities was literally sapped from me.\n\nWhat Burnout Taught Me\n\nYour company is not your family\n\nDo not think of your company as your family. The hard truth is that companies are businesses, and the goal of a business is to make money - often at any (legal) cost. I will dedicate a future article on exploring how to redefine this purpose and make it more ethical - however, for now:\n\nThink of your colleagues, peers, and friends as allies. People don‚Äôt need to be blood-related to be supportive and caring to each other. It can just make it more complicated when they are.\n\nTell your story, ask for help, and brainstorm solutions together. You never know how you could help others, or yourself, simply by sharing.\n\nIf you observe or suspect that someone else is struggling, reach out. We‚Äôre all humans at the end of the day. Let‚Äôs support each other. As an example, I‚Äôve found my managers to be very understanding and supportive after I opened up to them.\n\nTell someone about it\n\nAfter I opened up to others, they encouraged me to take time off and do other things to recover and look after myself. Not many people talk about it openly, but I‚Äôm convinced that in our increasingly fast-paced society, nevermind being in the midst of a global pandemic, almost everyone has experienced burnout by now and will understand more than you might expect. Some starting points:\n\nTell your manager or colleagues that you‚Äôre burned out and to expect some downtime. Maybe they can cover some of your responsibilities in the meantime.\n\nTell your manager and let them help you.\n\nTell your peers what‚Äôs going on and encourage them to do the same so you can collectively improve your work culture.\n\nTell your loved ones and chosen family. Let them support you if they are able to.\n\nMost importantly: seek professional help if needed.\n\nDelete any apps used for work communication from your phone\n\nIt‚Äôs in my nature to care deeply about my company, our mission, my team, and my colleagues. I would compulsively check Slack after work, on vacation, and when I couldn‚Äôt sleep. This further erodes the tenuous separation we have between work and life.\n\nUnless you truly work in a mission critical, real time role (I find it helpful to compare my job to emergency services or air traffic control), few things are important enough that they can‚Äôt wait until the next day. I knew about this guideline and espoused it in front of others, but did not uphold it for myself. Simply deleting Slack from my phone gave me back mental space - much more than I expected.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just software.‚Äù - a delivery manager I worked with\n\nWork to live, don‚Äôt live to work\n\nWork is not worth burning out for. It‚Äôs not worth sacrificing your health or life for someone else's business. You have a life, family, hobbies, interests, and value outside of work. Do not let your job define your life or identity.\n\nRemember the top five regrets of the dying? Not a single person said ‚ÄúI wish I had worked more‚Äù. In fact, they said quite the opposite.\n\n‚ÄúOne of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one‚Äôs work is terribly important.‚Äù - Bertrand Russell\n\nUse sick leave\n\nIf you have paid sick leave available, use it. Burnout is a sickness that can deeply affect you mentally as well as physically. Don‚Äôt feel the need to justify how it‚Äôs the same as having the flu, a stomach bug, or a broken leg: I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs the same. People don‚Äôt leave jobs after the flu, but it can be a consequence of sustained burnout.\n\nIf you are a people manager or HR, make sure your colleagues are aware of any available sick leave, so they can take advantage of it.\n\nConsider deleting social media apps from your phone\n\nThis is not strictly related to work, but phenomena such as doomscrolling and revenge bedtime procrastination have real effects on health that are recognised by psychologists. I deleted Instagram from my phone, my go-to procrastination scroller. That combined with deleting Slack helped improve my focus and concentration.\n\nFinish working at a reasonable time\n\nIt will depend on your working arrangement. There is very little to gain by either you or your company if you literally burn all of your energy and health working late. Moreover, it sets a bad precedent for your team and general culture, as others will feel like they also have to work late. This can be extremely difficult or impossible for parents and carers.\n\nThere are times when it makes sense to go above and beyond, but do not make that the norm. Don‚Äôt create or contribute to a toxic culture.\n\nTakeaways ü•°\n\nI hope this article was informative and helpful. Here‚Äôs a summary of the points I made:\n\nYour company is not your family.\n\nTell someone if you suspect you are burning out, or are already burned out.\n\nDelete any apps used for work communication from your phone.\n\nWork to live, don‚Äôt live to work.\n\nUse sick leave if available.\n\nConsider deleting social media apps from your phone.\n\nStop working at a reasonable time.\n\nLet‚Äôs take care of ourselves, so we can take care of each other.\n\n---\n\nAs always, feel free to share any feedback in the comments.
