        "text": "Suicide has become one of the leading causes of death for people aged 10 to 64 in the United States (CDC, 2023b). Suicide, or death that is caused by injury to oneself with an intent to end life affects all cultures, countries, genders, and ages in the world (CDC, 2023b). A suicide attempt is defined as intentional harm to oneself without a result of death (CDC, 2023b).\n\nAccording to a study by Davis et al. (2021), nurses are 18% more likely to die by suicide. This study also concluded that nurses who are female are twice as likely to die by suicide than when compared to the general population (Davis et al., 2021; Lee & Friese, 2021). In addition, this study concluded that female nurses are 70% more likely to die by suicide than female physicians (Davis et al., 2021). It is clear that the rate of suicide among nurses exceeds that of the general population (Davis et al., 2021). With this in mind, it is essential that initiatives, both at the national and organizational levels, are prioritized to promote nurse well-being (Davis et al., 2021). The result of this study could also help to insinuate the need for routine assessment of nurse well-being in the workplace, which could also allow for referral and intervention if needed.\n\nWhat are some warning signs and symptoms to watch out for? An excellent mnemonic to help you remember the signs and symptoms for a thorough suicide assessment is \"IS PATH WARM” (Juhnke et al., 2007):\n\nI = Ideation = Any suicide ideation? Mentioning killing oneself?\n\nS = Substance abuse = Excessive chronic or recent alcohol/drug use?\n\nP = Purposelessness = Lack of purpose verbalized?\n\nA = Anger = Feelings or anger? Desired revenge?\n\nT = Trapped = Feelings of being trapped? No other way out?\n\nH = Hopelessness = Feelings of hopelessness? No future?\n\nW = Withdrawal = Desire to withdraw from others? Already withdrawn?\n\nA = Anxiety = Anxiety, agitation, unable to sleep? Unable to relax?\n\nR = Recklessness = Engaging in reckless behaviors?\n\nM = Mood change = Dramatic mood shifts?\n\nMany of the definitions and workplace issues we have discussed thus far have the potential to contribute to an increased risk for suicide in nurses. There is a need for multi-level intervention to include policy and procedural changes and practice changes within workplace settings (Lee & Friese, 2021). Nurses must also be proactive in taking care of themselves and prioritizing their own physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellness (Lee & Friese, 2021).\n\nSuicidal ideation is thoughts of harming oneself with an intent to end life (CDC, 2023b). It is important to note that suicidal ideation can present itself as either active or passive (Salt Lake Behavioral Health, 2022):\n\nActive suicidal thoughts are thoughts that include a plan for ending life and the loss of motivation to continue living.\n\nAn example of active suicidal ideation includes comments like, “It would be simple to end my life by __________” with a specific means of ending life described.\n\nPassive suicidal ideation includes a loss of motivation to continue living but does not include a specific plan of how to end life.\n\nExamples of passive suicidal ideation can include comments such as, “I wish I could go to bed and just not wake up again” or “I wish I would just get in a car accident so it could all be over.”\n\nActions to be taken if you or someone you know is experiencing active suicide ideation are to immediately call the National Suicide Lifeline number, call a trusted friend or family member, or report directly to the nearest emergency room or psychiatric hospital. So much can be done to help you, your colleagues, your family members, or your friend who is experiencing active suicidal ideation. A safety plan will be developed to help protect the individual, a support system will be organized, psychiatric services will be initiated to intervene for excellent support, and the person will be kept safe.\n\nPassive suicidal ideation is also very much a severe mental health concern that should be taken seriously. However, treatment in an acute care setting is not immediately recommended. It is recommended that anyone who is experiencing passive suicidal ideation be seen by a mental health professional as soon as possible (Salt Lake Behavioral Health, 2022). If the individual verbalizes that they do not feel safe themselves or if they answer you that they cannot commit to staying safe for the next 24 hours when you ask them that question, it is recommended that that person is immediately referred to the nearest emergency room or psychiatric hospital for evaluation and potential hospitalization (Salt Lake Behavioral Health, 2022).\n\nThe National Suicide Lifeline number was updated in July 2022 as a shorter, easier-to-remember number. For you or anyone you know in crisis or experiencing suicidal ideation, people utilize the following number for support:\n\n24/7 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline:\n\nCall or Text \"988\"\n\nThis line connects you directly with a trained crisis counselor who is trained and ready to help you.\n\nLike you, the majority of the nurses reading this course right now probably dreamed about being a nurse for quite some time. Are there any families that do not have at least one parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or child who is a nurse? Whether you wanted to be a nurse since you were a child, decided in college, had a significant event in your life in which a nurse impacted you, leaving you wanting to pursue nursing, or wanted to become a nurse like a friend or family member you idolize, we all have our stories which brought us into nursing.\n\nMost of us have had dreams of saving lives and helping people that inspired our career path. Many of us go into nursing pursuing a specific subset of patients like pediatrics, obstetrics, or psychiatry. We want to help. We want to be there for these people during the worst day/days of their lives. We want to make a difference.\n\nI am sure you did your homework before applying to school. You interviewed a few nurses about their jobs, possibly shadowed one to get an idea of what a day in life looked like, and probably even did a quick internet search about the pros of being a nurse.\n\nHaving gotten to where we are in our careers, we all know what these pros generally are. Depending on your workplace environment, acute care, or outpatient, the pros differ a bit. Typically, nurses have 10-12 hour work days, which could mean shorter work weeks, pay can be pretty good depending on your location and experience level, you have the option to work during the week or weekends or days or nights, the very-real nursing shortage means that there are so many jobs out there, there are so many specialties you could work in, schedules can be flexible, there are many opportunities for advancement and working within leadership, work clothing is simple and comfy, and we have a daily opportunity to make an impact on a patient and their family (Indeed Editorial Team, 2023). I am sure you can think of even more advantages!\n\nWe worked extremely hard to get into a nursing program. We all saw days of highs and lows in nursing school. Maybe you have even experienced multiple nursing programs. These programs were not for the faint of heart. Nevertheless, you pursued, you persisted, and you succeeded!\n\nMaybe you read about some of the cons of the profession as well. Or perhaps you discovered some of them in nursing school. Maybe you listened to your preceptor and her colleagues and heard them discuss some issues in your clinical settings. Or perhaps it took until you were working as a nurse yourself to realize some disadvantages. We all know that every career field has its positives and negatives. Both should be discussed and normalized so everyone understands what they might have in store and be prepared to mitigate the things they are unwilling to deal with.\n\nWhat are the cons of nursing? These are you probably aware of, too! They can bother some people more and others less. These include longer shifts, required weekends and holidays, life-or-death stress, physical requirements, exposure to possible communicable diseases and illnesses, and challenging daily situations (Indeed Editorial Team, 2023). I am confident you could come up with a few others.\n\nNursing has challenges that we all know were not mentioned in this list. Nurses struggle with working short-staffed, being assigned unsafe patient assignments, experiencing nurse-to-nurse bullying/incivility, being a victim of patient violence, and being subjected to abuse from physicians or other members of the healthcare team. All of these major issues have the potential to be mitigated by nursing organizations, nursing management/leadership teams, and nurses themselves. These issues need to continue to be brought up and discussed, and solutions determined to minimize the adverse sequelae that result from these situations. There are, unfortunately, no easy answers, but there are things that can be done. Although those things are outside of the focus of this course and will not be discussed specifically, what we will discuss are these individual issues, how they impact, harm, and affect the mental health of nurses, and what you can do to protect yourself and your license.\n\nBurnout Prevention\n\nWe have discussed many contributing factors of nurse burnout. So, what exactly can we do to prevent it? Of course, certain aspects may be beyond the control of a specific healthcare organization or management team, but overall, there are possible proactive measures that can be taken to prevent nurse burnout (Kakacek, 2023; Nurse.org, 2022b).\n\nMany preventative measures require organization, unit, management, and leadership involvement. If you are a nurse working within management or administration, take a moment to consider the following things that you could do to help decrease the chances that your nurses will experience burnout.\n\nNursing leadership must (Sachdeva, 2022; Nejati et al., 2016):\n\nListen to the nurses:\n\nLeadership needs to acknowledge and address the concerns of their nurses. Nurses need to be able to share their thoughts, opinions, and problems with their charge staff and management; they need to be comfortable enough to come forward when they need to talk. There needs to be an environment conducive to opening up and sharing thoughts and feelings with superiors. This can be accomplished by the leadership remaining open-minded, having an open-door policy, encouraging nurses to engage whenever they need to talk, and ensuring privacy in their conversations. Nursing leadership can learn about the concerns their staff have by allowing open dialogue in staff meetings. Staff meetings on both day and night shifts allow both shifts to be heard. When nurses feel listened to, they believe that their thoughts matter, and when they feel that those thoughts matter, they will be more willing to step forward and speak up about future issues requiring managerial weigh-in. It is also beneficial for management to go directly to the nurses and check in with them to see how they are doing, asking if there is anything that can be done to support them.\n\nPrioritize the physical and mental well-being of nurses:\n\nNurse well-being can be supported by openly discussing its importance in the pre-shift huddle. Maybe the organization has a gym, offers workout classes, or hosts a wellness program. These are great things to bring up before shifts to advertise them to the nurses and encourage them to participate, with the ultimate goal of taking some time to prioritize their minds and bodies. Hosting unit potlucks, parties, birthdays, and retirement parties can celebrate the staff while prioritizing taking a break. These are simple ideas to care for the physical and mental health of the nurses you oversee. And, no, I am not just talking about one of those pizza parties we all joke about as not being a substitution for another form of appreciation! It’s not the pizza; everyone loves pizza, but pizza because the unit is short-staffed will not fix that.\n\nHelp nurses prevent overworking:\n\nIt is vital to encourage nurses to take their breaks. We have all been there when we purposefully held our bladders or ate a late lunch because we were prioritizing patient care or we had a hectic assignment. But it is not good practice to not take breaks. Some units and hospital systems have worked to make breaks mandatory. Even short breaks, once every few hours, can do wonders for our minds and bodies. Working in leadership, you can check in with nurses during their shifts and ask if they have taken a break, gone to the restroom, drank some water, or stopped to take their lunch or dinner break. You also have the ability and the opportunity to offer temporary coverage or patient care assistance while they are off of the floor for a few moments. While we cannot force anyone to do anything, a simple reminder sometimes is what we need, especially on those shifts when we have just forgotten to care for ourselves. Sometimes, just the reminder can make a nurse feel more valued, but it could also be the fact that you asked that makes a nurse feel like you care.\n\nAllow for flexible scheduling:\n\nNurses love their jobs and caring for patients, but they love their free time and personal life, too. Utilizing scheduling software that allows nurses to put in their schedule per unit requirements and then easily swap shifts with other nurses as they see fit can contribute to more staff satisfaction in a nurse’s schedule to allow for a better work-life balance. It might help, too, to offer a weekend differential that might encourage nurses to want to work more weekend days and nights, which we all know can be challenging to do. It will also help you fill your weekend shifts.\n\nBut what can YOU do to prevent burnout in yourself? We all know the importance of community. As students in nursing school, we learned how valuable our clinical group was to us. We spent most of our time with them instead of our family members. We learned to survive and thrive together by studying in groups, carpooling to clinical, and helping each other on the floor in the hospital with our patient care tasks. Those classmates became like family because we shared late nights, tears, and life-altering experiences right next to each other.\n\nThe same can be said for the colleagues you have now. You work side by side, daily, with a common goal and passion for the same subspecialty of patients. Staying involved with your work colleagues as much as you care to, sharing your successes and struggles, reaching out to a coworker you feel might be having a hard time, and celebrating the good stuff like birthdays, career milestones, positive patient or family comments, weddings, and new babies can help create a sense of community and family with the people you work with. Nursing units can help their nurses accomplish this by fostering a sense of belonging and teamwork immediately after hire, beginning on day one. Work environments like this are nurturing, sharing both successes and failures, allowing nurses to feel comfortable in venting their thoughts and feelings, and moving away from bottling them up and keeping them to themselves. This can be so important in preventing burnout.\n\nMitigating Moral Distress\n\nAbove, we discussed the existence of moral distress, what it looks like, what types of situations cause it, and why we experience it. But now that we know what moral distress looks like, how can we deal with it? And is there anything we can do in these situations?\n\nThe American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) is well-versed in this issue. It even has a framework for dealing with morally distressing situations (Healthy Nurse Healthy Nation, 2022). Let’s look at the four A’s of this framework (American Association of Critical Care Nurses [AACN], 2004).\n\nTable 1: The 4 A’s to Rise Above Moral Distress (Adapted from AACN, 2004)ASK“Am I experiencing distress or suffering in some way about a work/patient situation?”AFFIRM“Yes, I’m in distress considering this work/patient situation. I need to address this.”ASSESS“What am I able to do to address this distress? What am I able to do to mitigate this situation?”ACT“The time is now. I am going to take action to mitigate this current situation. This is what I am going to do to reduce my distress, make it known to others, and implement changes to reduce the risk of situations just like this causing moral distress to my colleagues.”\n\nThe whole point of the 4 A’s from the AACN is to give you a memorable tool to use the next time you find yourself in a situation causing you moral distress. The idea is that first, you will acknowledge that you are experiencing moral distress; second, you will check in with yourself and make a decision that something must be done; third, you will consider what can be done to solve the level of distress that you are feeling, and then finally, you will speak up, be it with your charge nurse or your nurse manager (minding your clinical ladder level of escalation per your organization or facility), to discuss the issue, share your view and concerns, and work to change current policy and procedures, if needed, to accommodate situations such as these.\n\nLet’s put this framework together better with an example!\n\nLet’s say, for example, that you are a nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in April 2020. Due to COVID-19, visitation rules have been strictly eliminated. One of your patients is a 4-day-old twin “B” baby girl. Sweet little Olivia was admitted to the PICU for some feeding intolerance that her twin sister was not experiencing. Due to the strict cessation of current visitation, Olivia’s first-time parents are being told they are not allowed to visit their newborn baby girl since the mom has been discharged. You are taking care of Olivia for the fourth night in a row, and this situation is wearing on you. You feel guilty for being involved in keeping mom and dad from their newborn, the twin sister from her twin; you worry about mom’s ability to bond with Olivia; you are concerned that the lack of bonding will affect mom’s breastmilk production; you are also concerned that Olivia’s ability to bond and breastfeed will impact her development. You are frustrated that you cannot provide the patient/family teaching that you need to teach these new parents how to care for their newborn because they cannot be there in person.\n\nOlivia experienced an episode of belly pain that evening. While rocking Olivia, you ASK yourself if what you are experiencing is morally distressing to you. You AFFIRM that you are experiencing moral distress. You then ASSESS your ability to do something about how you are feeling. Discussing your thoughts with your immediate superior, your charge nurse, is the best action. You believe specific considerations must be made for this family’s unique situation. You also think that this family’s case might be similar to others during this challenging time of strict rules and that the current policy needs to be reviewed. You decide to ACT following Olivia’s midnight care.\n\nYou reach out to your charge nurse to discuss your concerns. Your charge nurse agrees that this is not a good situation and that there need to be some adjustments made to the unit visitation policy to mitigate these issues and to allow for some exceptions. She asks you if you have considered a solution to these issues.\n\nYou make a recommendation to allow mom to visit daily while wearing a mask and a hospital gown so that she can do some skin-to-skin with Olivia and breastfeed her for at least one feeding. You also recommend that Olivia’s twin sister, Penelope, be allowed to join her mom so that mom can work on the psychomotor tasks of breastfeeding her twins to be more prepared for when they are all home together for the first time. By allowing this, the mom can visit, bond, breastfeed, and receive in-person parent teaching, Olivia’s twin can be around her sister, and Olivia can receive the bonding and breastmilk that is best for her. Ultimately, this could likely allow her to be discharged sooner. As for the dad, you recommend using the unit’s video phone call feature. This will allow the dad to see his baby daily via virtual technology, ideally while Mom is present. The charge nurse agrees that these ideas are reasonable and takes them to the unit’s nurse manager.\n\nThe nurse manager discusses these concerns and potential solutions to hospital leadership. Hospital leadership acknowledges several similar situations arising in other units concerning visitation. They recognize that some exceptions need to be made due to the adverse sequelae that can result if the strict, no-visitation rule remains. After weighing the pros and cons, the hospital administration agrees. Leadership works on adapting the current policies and procedures to reflect a list of exceptions to share with every unit!\n\nAs a nurse, you can create change. Speak up, stand up for what you think is right, and continue to advocate for yourself and your patients- always.\n\nWhat about in times of genuinely ethical situations? This could include continuing care to sustain life when it is not in the best interest of the patient, or maybe against their wishes, or taking care of an infant in a severe amount of pain but not fully medicating due to family wishes. Situations like these, especially when longer-term, can affect the entire healthcare team, namely all of the unit nurses who are assigned to that patient. In these cases, if your unit has an ethics committee, these issues are best addressed by them. If the issues have not yet been brought to the ethics committee’s attention, you can discuss them with your team to bring them forward for review. Ethics committees are valuable because they are composed of individuals with experience and expertise in weighing ethical dilemmas. They are particularly poised to discuss your case in question and advise how to or how not to proceed.\n\nWhat we might identify and bring forward regarding situations that elicit moral distress might not always necessitate action or yield results. But it is always worth the effort to try!\n\nLet’s take a moment to apply some of our learned here.\n\nNurse Beth has been a nurse for six years. She spent her first 5.5 years working bedside in the pediatric ICU (PICU) of a large hospital system. She recently made the switch to the NICU in the same hospital system. She had always loved working with kids and wanted to gain more exposure and experience working with premature infants. Her old manager did not support the move, telling her that she was leaving her old unit “high and dry,” but reluctantly provided her recommendation.\n\nNurse Beth has always worked on the night shift. She says it works best with her schedule so that she can sacrifice a little more sleep as she just “naps” for 1-3 hours after her last consecutive shift. Nurse Beth has an active 6-year-old daughter and a husband who works an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule as an accountant. Nurse Beth is almost off her 6-month residency with a preceptor, and she is feeling the pressure of being entirely on her own with the higher understanding, extremely premature, and very low birth weight neonates. Because of this, she has picked up two additional shifts per week to give her more exposure to these patients. She has told her husband that she does not think she is cut out for this new role. She is frustrated because she had such confidence in her job as a nurse before. Her husband notes that Nurse Beth has had a shorter temper with their daughter, is less interested in going out with him on date night like she used to do weekly, she does not want to take her daughter hiking anymore, she skips meals all the time, and he notices that her water bottle is near full following each shift when he is doing the dishes.\n\nNurse Beth just experienced her first full code in the NICU, where she experienced the loss of her first extremely premature neonate. Nurse Beth immediately begins to blame herself, citing her inexperience in not seeing the signs of the neonate’s deterioration. She has seen death, unfortunately, in the PICU, but this is affecting her differently. But she does not have time for this; she has so much to do and more to learn to prevent this from happening again. She goes to the restroom, washes her face off, and goes right back on the floor, asking her preceptor to tell the charge nurse that she would like the next new admission once her patient’s room is cleaned.\n\nWhat are we thinking about Nurse Beth? First of all, she has some nursing-related issues in her life that are working against her. It sounds like:\n\nShe is not getting enough sleep\n\nHer less-than-supportive previous manager has made her feel guilty for leaving the PICU\n\nShe is experiencing a bit of imposter syndrome because she feels like she is not good enough or ready enough to come off the orientation period of her residency program in the NICU\n\nShe is moodier and quicker to anger at home with her daughter\n\nShe is skipping meals\n\nShe is not drinking water during work\n\nShe just participated in her first NICU code with an adverse outcome\n\nShe is blaming the passing of the neonate entirely on herself\n\nShe neglects to take care of her own needs and emotions before going back out on the floor\n\nShe asks for another patient before she has the opportunity to process and grieve what she just went through\n\nWe all might have been in this mindset at some point in our careers. It sounds like her self-care is starting to decline, given the stress of her career transition. It also sounds like she is exhibiting some all-or-nothing thinking. It seems as if she thinks it is 100% her fault the neonate passed and not due to the extreme prematurity or something that even Nurse Beth’s preceptor missed. Remember, she is still with a preceptor! It also sounds like the stress she is experiencing at work and in her career transition is bleeding into her home life with her family.\n\nWhat would you recommend for Nurse Beth?\n\nOne of our biggest concerns is that we want to work to prevent burnout and compassion fatigue in Nurse Beth. It sounds like she is well on her way to becoming affected by the way she is thinking and how ineffectively she is taking care of her body. So, first, we would recommend her basic human needs be cared for. We need to encourage Nurse Beth to start sleeping more each night, give herself goals for water intake each day, and prioritize at least two meals a day or even five small meals. Her basic human needs to be satisfied first to move forward from here. Next, we want to encourage Nurse Beth to re-engage in open communication with her husband, share with him what her thoughts and feelings are, and schedule time alone with him and her daughter to do something fun like they used to do all the time, like date nights or hiking!\n\nThis is also an excellent time to bring up the importance of Nurse Beth confiding in her preceptor or charge nurse about her thoughts and concerns about her abilities. Nurse Beth could benefit from a debriefing conversation with the entire medical team who were present during the patient code where she lost her first NICU patient. It could be prefaced with being a good learning experience. Still, it will also be an excellent opportunity to hear what more experienced coworkers think about what happened, what went right, what went wrong, and how each person could improve for future situations like this. In addition, jumping right into taking another patient is not the best option. Although it can keep our bodies moving and our minds busy, it is way more beneficial to us to have the time to talk about and process traumatic events like these, take a moment to ourselves to cry or vent, and check in with our personal needs we have neglected during this time of emergency.\n\nAlso, due to the number of stressors Nurse Beth has worked against her and the risk of possible mental health issues like anxiety, depression, or even burnout, it would not hurt to tell Nurse Beth that she is not alone and that it would help if she could talk to someone about what she is going through. Seeing a mental health professional could help identify mental health struggles that she is suffering with currently, identify the imposter syndrome that she is exhibiting, guide her through the rest of her orientation and her transition to being off on her own again, provide her support by way of talk therapy, and be there as a referral source if psychotropics are desired at any point.\n\nEvery one of us has a story. We all have a reason or inspiration for why we chose to become a nurse. We love what we do. The nature of our jobs and the environments in which we work can affect our mental health.\n\nThe long hours, consecutive shifts, exposure to traumatizing situations, and life and death can all take a toll on our mental health at some point. It is also important to note here that there are some things about nursing we did not know much about before working as nurses. Things like the effect of working short-staffed, the commonality of nurse-to-nurse bullying, the struggle with lack of resources or supplies from time to time, or even how our place of work would react to a global pandemic are things we learned with our experience. These are the not-so-glamorous parts of nursing that sometimes contribute to nurses leaving the bedside or leaving nursing altogether. The more these things are talked about and the more attention that is brought to these things not being just a “part of the job,” the more likely we are as nurses to come up with plans to mitigate these problems and improve nursing as a profession for ourselves and for those who follow.\n\nIn nursing school, we learned about primary and secondary prevention measures. We must do what is necessary to care for our minds just as we care for our bodies to work to prevent mental health issues and mitigate any that should arise. Caring for our mental health is vital to being able to live fully outside of work among our family and friends and in our workplace, where we have patients depending on us to be our best. For a profession that works so hard to help others, there is still so much stigma around asking for help for ourselves.\n\nWe are not robots. We have needs just like our patients do. If at any point you are experiencing at least two weeks of problems sleeping, appetite changes, difficulty focusing at work or home, sustained low mood, loss of interest in things you once loved, or an inability to perform the daily functions and responsibilities you have as a nurse, mom, dad, sister, brother, cousin, aunt, uncle, grandmother, or grandfather, please seek professional help (NIH, 2022). Please do not wait until your symptoms are overwhelming to you. Your family needs you, your patients need you, YOU need you."
