        "text": "The Power Of Burnout Let’s talk about something that doesn’t often get the spotlight in today's culture of high achievement and fast success, especially in the corporate world. You would think, by now, it would be very acceptable to talk openly about burnout but if it is, it's rarely understood. Many people, especially in the corporate world, think that burnout is about being weak and vulnerable. The truth is very different. You don't hit burnout at the first little upset or challenge. Nor the second or third or fourth or fifth; burnout happens at the end of a long road, along which your resilience or stamina or emotional wellbeing is so severely tested that you reach a point when you or your body says \"Enough, I can't do this anymore\". You have no more capacity to adapt, whether that's physically, like an overworked athlete; or mentally and emotionally like Jim, a client of mine, a CEO, who had lost all interest in his business, was struggling to keep his home life together and whose health had rapidly deteriorated over the last 6 months. Unfortunately, by the time you've reached the point of 'enough', there are a lot of physical systems that don't function as they should. Perhaps you wake up exhausted and no amount of sleep re-charges your batteries; or you put on weight and nothing you do to shift it works; or maybe your digestive system is no longer working properly and you end up with IBS. At the point of 'enough', you're emotionally and mentally drained of energy; you've lost connection with your partner, your kids, your parents and probably your friends. I've hit burnout twice so this post comes from personal experience as well as wearing my professional hat working with burnout. Physical health and mental health are not two separate systems! Though people often think they are. So the road back from burnout therefore requires time; time to assess what went wrong, time to rebuild your reserves and resilience, time to decide how you want to live your life after this 'wake-up' call. Because for many people, burnout is indeed, a wake-up call. It's a powerful catalyst for change. For some, it turns out to be 'a blessing in disguise'. They leave their job of 30 years and follow their deep desire to live a different life - move to Thailand, go to art school, set up their own business, become a yoga teacher, see the Grand Canyon, ride horses in Montana. Without the trauma of hitting burnout, what would you [secretly] love to do? I'll share first - I would love to go to Montana and see the wide, open spaces from the saddle of a very safe, reliable horse. Now your turn to share - what would you love to do without a wake up call to change your life? #changeyourlife #burnout #powerofburnout #lifechanges #success #driventosuceed #healthandwealth #meaningsmatter #healthmatters #chooseyourlife #choiceshaveconsequences Image: Taylor Brandon/Unsplash\n\nIn an ideal world, I wouldn’t be working on or talking about Burnout ALL. DAY. LONG. But we don’t work in an ideal world. The way we’re working isn’t working. And until it’s fixed, and I’m not getting endless messages each week from people who are stressed, exhausted, overwhelmed and on the brink of, or recovering from Burnout, I’ll keep doing what I’m doing. And let me tell you, it’s not easy working with people every single day who are struggling. It’s not easy working with clients who cry for hours because they are at breaking point. It’s not easy coming off stage to a line of people all of whom feel like you’ve just told their story. And it’s not easy speaking with organisations who want to talk about Burnout and the risks but not actually create the changes - I’m here for change, not lip-service. I’d love to be done with Burnout. I often think that my life would be easier, and that I’d have more energy, and probably a lot more money if i just worked with clients on building businesses after escaping corporate, or I focused purely on Executive Coaching, or I moved to somewhere in the sun to teach yoga full time. But as I hear from all of my clients, “you’re the only person I’ve spoken to who actually gets it”. So when I see my corporate clients turn things around, or my one to one one clients win awards, follow their dreams, or create change for others - all after Burnout or just before it strikes, it makes it all worthwhile. When I get a message from someone who changed their life after I delivered a talk, it makes it all the more energising. Burnout is horrendous. And I certainly never thought it would happen to me, or that I’d be talking about it all day long. But here we are. Here I am. And I’m going to keep talking about it all day long, every single day, until something changes. To anyone who thinks Burnout doesn’t exist (and you know who you are), I’d like to see you do my job for one day because you’d quickly change your mind. And to those of you who know it exists and who want to do something about it by changing the world of work, I see you! We’re all responsible for Banishing Burnout in this changing world of work, every single one of us. And I’m here for it! #Burnout #BurnoutPrevention #WorkplaceWellbeing\n\nBurnouts are a burden, but it’s something that everyone is unfortunately familiar with. We’re seeing a significant rise in employee burnout, with 62% of employees reporting that they’re feeling the effects of being burnt out. Burnouts leave individuals dissatisfied and distraught. People who experience burnout become more cynical and are more inclined to deal with physical and mental health issues, strained relationships, and impaired cognitive functions. These individuals are also at risk for substance abuse and long-term health problems. You can dissect what burnout does to people in various ways, but some solutions can be put to work today. 1. Take a pause and refresh your mind: During the workday, take a break and a breath. Go outside and sit, or walk around if applicable. If you can, journaling isn’t a bad idea either. 2. Set Boundaries: Unfortunately, you can't be everywhere at once, whether this be outside of work hours or on a day off. Everyone needs time; take yours. 3. Prioritize Self-Care: Self-care is non-negotiable. Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Write down different ideas for self-care, even make a small schedule if it helps keep you organized, and practice it after work at your place. 4. Break Tasks into Manageable Steps: Overwhelming tasks can immediately contribute to burnout. Break down projects into smaller, more manageable steps. This makes the workload digestible and even helps you stay organized. Do not procrastinate! 5. Seek Support and Communicate: Discussing your challenges with others gives you emotional support while offering valuable perspectives and solutions. 6. Learn to Say No: While enthusiasm is commendable, overcommitting has never led anyone to a better state of mind. Assess your workload realistically and don't hesitate to decline additional tasks when your plate is full. Saying no is a skill that preserves your energy for essential priorities. 7. Reflect and Adjust: Reflect on your workload and goals. If you keep becoming burned out, then consider adjusting your approach. This might involve delegating tasks, reprioritizing, or discussing expectations with your supervisor. 8. Invest in Continuous Learning: Invest time in learning and broaden your knowledge. This can help break up your routine, provide mental stimulation, and help you grow professionally, as well as personally. Dealing with burnout is not a sign of weakness. It happens, and it even happens to your boss. Take time for yourself and focus on what you can do to help yourself. Also, never be afraid to reach out for help. #BurnoutPrevention #WellbeingAtWork #Resilience #WorkLifeBalance #smallbusiness #smallbusinessowner #smallbiz Staff Leasing\n\nI posted yesterday that burnout doesn't happen overnight, and recovery is a journey and I've been thinking about my own experience with this ... A little over five years ago, I found myself in a place I never imagined I'd be: standing at the precipice of burnout. The beginning of 2018 wasn't just another chapter in my life; it became a stark lesson in the resilience of the human spirit and how fragile our mental and emotional wellbeing can be, if we don't look after it properly. It wasn't just the mounting pressures of work or the inevitable stresses that life sometimes throws our way. It was a tumultuous storm of personal life events, including the heart-wrenching loss of family members, coupled with a lack of self-care skills and entrenched negative thinking patterns. All these combined to push me to a brink I didn't see coming. I'm sharing this with you not for sympathy, but to emphasize a crucial message: Burnout doesn't sneak up on you in a day. It's a gradual process, where stressors accumulate, and our coping mechanisms fail. But there's another side to this coin: recovery. Healing, too, doesn't happen overnight. It's a journey - one that requires patience, self-love, and often a helping hand from others. It took time, self-reflection, and intentional self-care practices to rebuild my mental and emotional resilience. It required breaking down those negative thinking patterns and forging healthier, more positive ones in their place. If you're reading this and see glimpses of your own struggles, I want you to know that I've been there. And, more importantly, there's hope. Burnout may temporarily weigh us down, but with the right support and self-awareness, we can emerge even stronger and more resilient than before. This personal experience is precisely why I now run specialized workshops on managing stress and preventing burnout. I understand the nuances, the subtle signs, and the impact it has, not just on the individual but on the entire organizational fabric. If you believe your team could benefit from this insight and hands-on strategies to foster a healthier work environment, I urge you to reach out. Let's work together to ensure no one feels overwhelmed to the point of breaking. Equip your team with the knowledge and tools they need. Send me a direct message or connect with me to learn more. Your team's wellbeing is worth it. 🌟 #BurnoutRecovery #PersonalJourney #Wellbeing #Resilience\n\nA few years ago(earlier in my career), I experienced BURN OUT!... Like full-blown burnout. The most interesting part was that I didn't know I was experiencing burnout I didn't know that there was a name for the feeling. I started experiencing weakness during the early hours of the day - like before I even do anything in the morning, I'm already tired. I was both mentally and physically tired. One faithful day, I got to work and I don't know what came over me, I called one of my bosses. I confided in her and told her exactly how I was feeling(you can tell that I had an existing relationship with my boss which is why I was able to do this. Don't go and open up to an insecure leader oo). She helped me work out the modality of getting a few days off work, she offered to pay for some days in a hotel for me to just chill and breathe which I graciously declined. I took a solo trip out of Lagos, lodged in an unknown place and spent a few days alone - Ate food I didn't hustle to cook, stayed in a room I didn't hustle to clean and Uber-ed my way around the city. During my solo trip, I had long hours of sleep, prayed, saw movies and made sure I didn't think about my work(everybody and the work would be alright without me). I came back to Lagos feeling like a child. My mind was so clear and light🤭 You see this career journey that we are all in, BURN OUT is real🤔 more real than many of us can imagine. The reasons for burnout are not farfetched: - Wanting to outperform colleagues who are not even competing with you. - Sacrificing your personal life/purpose just to prove a point with your career. - Neglecting yourself and living off validation from people, people pleasing and celebrating compromising on your values just to fit in. Getting over burnout doesn't have to look expensive like what I narrated above, it just has to be thoughtful and deliberate. Getting over burnout can look like this; - Setting meaningful standards for yourself - Prioritizing yourself sometimes - Clarifying work expectations - Eating healthy The world would keep moving without you, Be sure to care for yourself (Mentally, Spiritually and Physically). You need a sound mind to give the world your best! Rooting for you...

It’s a word thrown around so often it can almost lose its meaning. But for the millions experiencing it, it’s a harsh reality and challenging journey: a constant state of exhaustion, cynicism, and a sense of ineffectiveness. Our recent simple burnout quiz* results reflected that 75% of responses showed signs of #chronicstress and #burnout. This is particularly common for individuals who constantly push themselves and juggle countless responsibilities, including parents and caregivers. You might find yourself constantly saying yes, even when #overwhelmed, or snapping at loved ones due to the constant stress. The global uncertainties post-pandemic haven’t helped either with the Great Resignation, shifting work flexibility arrangement, ‘revenge travelling’ and cost inflation. So, what can you do if you find yourself feeling emotionally #disconnected, #empty, and burnt out? 𝟱 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗞𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗧𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆 Whether you choose a support group, individual therapy, or working on it yourself, here are 5 immediate steps you can take to start #refocusing on yourself and kickstart your burnout recovery: 1️⃣ 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 Take a step back and identify your basic needs – sleep, healthy food, exercise, and relaxation. #Prioritize these in your daily #routine. 2️⃣ 𝗗𝗿𝗮𝘄 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 Learn to say no to requests that drain your energy. #StartSmall, and gradually communicate your limitations assertively. 3️⃣ 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 Activities like meditation or deep breathing can help you manage stress and regain a sense of calm in the #present moment. 4️⃣ 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽 Don’t be afraid to #delegate tasks at work or home.

Have you ever felt like burnout was an unstoppable force, out of your control? I've been there - in the relentless corporate world, juggling responsibilities, and feeling the weight of burnout creeping in. I used to believe that burnout was out of my control- the result of life’s circumstances, until I realized something powerful - we have the ability to take ownership of our burnout journey. It's time to shift our perspective! Burnout isn't just a result; it's a signal that something needs to change. I've been through it all - from the high-pressure medical sales career to balancing a demanding job while caring for my energetic 2-year-old twin boys during my husband's deployment in Iraq. 3 action steps to take ownership of your burnout and make positive changes: 1. Self-Awareness and Reflection: Begin by acknowledging and understanding the signs of burnout. Take time for self-reflection to identify the specific triggers and stressors in your life. This might include overwork, lack of boundaries, or unmanageable responsibilities. 2. Set Boundaries and Prioritize Self-Care: Once you've identified the sources of burnout, it's crucial to set clear boundaries and prioritize self-care. This might involve renegotiating your workload, investing in resources to lighten the load at home, delegating tasks, setting clear boundaries, and scheduling time for activities that rejuvenate you. Prioritizing sleep, exercise, and healthy nutrition can significantly impact your resilience. 3. Seek Support and Professional Help: Don't go through burnout alone. Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues for support and understanding. Additionally, consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or coaching, to develop coping strategies and resilience skills. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Taking ownership of burnout means recognizing that you have the power to make changes in your life to prevent and overcome it. ------------------------------------------------------ Like this post?

It's important to know the signs and symptoms so you can take proactive steps to bounce back stronger than ever! Here's what you need to know: 🚨 What is Burnout? Burnout is more than just feeling tired or stressed; it's a state of chronic exhaustion that can result from prolonged periods of stress, overwhelm, or imbalance between work and personal life. It can sneak up on you when you least expect it, affecting your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. ⚠️ Signs and Symptoms: Early recognition of the signs of burnout is key to preventing it from spiralling out of control. Watch out for persistent fatigue, cynicism or detachment from work, reduced productivity, irritability, and feelings of ineffectiveness or lack of accomplishment. 🛑 Recovery Steps: If you're experiencing burnout, remember that it's okay to hit pause and prioritize your well-being. Here are three steps you can take to recover: 1️⃣ Rest and Recharge: Give yourself permission to take a break and recharge your batteries. Whether it's a day off, a weekend getaway, or simply unplugging from work for a while, prioritize restorative activities that help you relax and rejuvenate. 2️⃣ Set Boundaries: Learn to say no to additional responsibilities or commitments that contribute to your stress levels. Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life, and prioritize activities that bring you joy and fulfilment outside of work. 3️⃣ Seek Support: Don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or a professional counsellor. Sharing your feelings and experiences with others can provide much-needed perspective and validation, helping you navigate the challenges of burnout. Remember, burnout is not a sign of weakness – it's a signal that your mind and body need some extra care and attention. By recognizing the signs, taking proactive steps to recover, and prioritizing your well-being, you can overcome burnout and emerge stronger than ever before! 💪 www.fettle.ie #burnout #selfdiscovery #healingjourney #therapyworks #mindfulness #selfcompassion #therapy #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #psychotherapy #onlinetherapy #wellbeing # resilience #psychology #wellness #health #emotions\n\nTwice I’ve burnt out….or so I thought… … but then I really reflected deeply and realised it was more times than that (Burnout overachiever over here) It just showed up in sneaky and less obvious ways, but the overall effect was carnage that had me floored physically, emotionally or mentally. A broken body, a broken immune system, a broken heart, a broken mind and broken relationships. I could blame them on all kinds of other things and reasons, but they were all led from my inability to both listen to my heart and body, that often were emitting ‘fog horn’ signals. Instead I was led by an addiction to busyness and feeling my worth was related to the external outcomes. I’m not burnt out now - not even close, and I don’t intend ever going back there again. However my commitment to that comes from my admission that burnout is like a gene that lives within me, always waiting for the right conditions to rear it’s head and create deep damage once again. I’m saying this because I see others with possibly that same gene, that don’t notice the internal memo. They also put themselves under the same conditions over and over again and wonder why they end up in that place of burn out hell, in it’s many guises. ❌ A few months off does not heal burnout. ❌ A change of scenery / company where you do the same job in similar conditions does not avoid burnout. ❌Starting your own business does not necessarily prevent burnout. ❌ Cramming 5 days in a 4 day week does not release the valve on burnout building. What stops a burnout relapse…because that’s how I see it…once you burnout a relapse is always a possibility. What avoids that relapse is- ✅Self awareness ✅Personal accountability & action ✅Fierce self compassion ✅Letting go of stuff that doesnt serve you and the need to have it all ✅Clear and big massive boundaries So nowadays my way of never relapsing back into burnout is I crafted a job, business and life that means 👍I work a 9 month year, taking 7 weeks over summer with kids and the rest scattered around the year. 👍I work 30 hours a week tops often less 👍I consciously made a decision not to expand my business so I can easily sustain the hours and rhythm above. 👍I say no a lot and am very clear with my boundaries and limits of what i can and can’t, and will and won’t, do or commit to. 👍I have to prioritise often and walk away from things I’d love to do but saying yes would come at too high a price and compromise my values, 👍I have had to let go of extrinsic values and the external worlds definition of success and use my intrinsic values as my North Star. 👍what’s more I have zero guilt or regrets for any of the work and life style choices I now make. Compromising on the above is a slippery slope, so I have to be resolute. It’s not easy, it’s not for the faint hearted, but it sure makes me feel wholehearted. #burnout #burnoutprevention #emotionalintelligence #mindfulness #selfawareness #boundaries"
