        "text": "The British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) will not allow Electronic Arts to use their poster ad for Burnout: Dominator.\n\nAccording to Gamasutra, the ASA decided the depiction of the crashed car combined with the tag line “Inner peace through outer violence” was likely to cause offense and was “irresponsible” due to the high-traffic area in which it was posted (the London Underground) and the ad’s implied condoning of dangerous driving.\n\nElectronic Arts responded that the ad was supposed to represent the game experience and the tag line referred to the game’s ability to act as stress relief. They also pointed out the fact that no people were pictured in the ad and that the ad was obviously for a videogame.\n\nThis announcement comes hot on the heels of the banning of Manhunt 2, and may be indicative of more videogame censorship to come."
