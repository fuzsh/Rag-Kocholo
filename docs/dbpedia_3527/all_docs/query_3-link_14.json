        "text": "According to Melinda Smith, M.A., Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., and Lawrence Robinson at Help Guide, if constant stress has you feeling helpless, disillusioned, and completely exhausted, you may be on the road to burnout. Learn what you can do to regain your balance and feel positive and hopeful again.\n\nWhat is Burnout?\n\nBurnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest and motivation that led you to take on a certain role in the first place.\n\nBurnout reduces productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly helpless, hopeless, cynical, and resentful. Eventually, you may feel like you have nothing more to give.\n\nThe negative effects of burnout spill over into every area of life—including your home, work, and social life. Burnout can also cause long-term changes to your body that make you vulnerable to illnesses like colds and flu. Because of its many consequences, it’s important to deal with burnout right away.\n\nAre You on the Road to Burnout?\n\nYou may be on the road to burnout if:\n\nEvery day is a bad day\n\nCaring about your work or home life seems like a total waste of energy\n\nYou’re exhausted all the time\n\nThe majority of your day is spent on tasks you find either mind-numbingly dull or overwhelming\n\nYou feel like nothing you do makes a difference or is appreciated\n\nSigns and Symptoms of Burnout\n\nBurnout is a gradual process. It doesn’t happen overnight, but it can creep up on you. The signs and symptoms are subtle at first but become worse as time goes on. Think of the early symptoms as red flags that something is wrong that needs to be addressed. If you pay attention and actively reduce your stress, you can prevent a major breakdown. If you ignore them, you’ll eventually burn out.\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms of burnout include the following:\n\nFeeling tired and drained most of the time\n\nFrequent headaches or muscle pain\n\nLowered immunity, frequent illness\n\nChange in appetite or sleep habits\n\nEmotional signs and symptoms of burnout include the following:\n\nSense of failure and self-doubt\n\nLow motivation\n\nFeeling helpless, trapped, and defeated\n\nIncreasingly cynical and negative outlook\n\nDetachment, feeling alone in the world\n\nDecreased satisfaction and sense of accomplishment\n\nBehavioral signs and symptoms of burnout include the following:\n\nWithdrawing from responsibilities\n\nUsing food, drugs, or alcohol to cope\n\nIsolating yourself from others\n\nTaking out your frustrations on others\n\nProcrastinating, taking longer to get things done\n\nSkipping work or coming in late and leave early\n\nThe Difference between Stress and Burnout\n\nBurnout may be the result of unrelenting stress, but it isn’t the same as too much stress. Stress, by and large, involves too much: too many pressures that demand too much of you physically and mentally. However, stressed people can still imagine that if they can just get everything under control, they will feel better.\n\nBurnout, on the other hand, is about not enough. Being burned out means feeling empty and mentally exhausted, devoid of motivation, and beyond caring. People experiencing burnout often don’t see any hope of positive change in their situations. If excessive stress feels like you’re drowning in responsibilities, burnout is a sense of being all dried up. And while you’re usually aware of being under a lot of stress, you don’t always notice burnout when it happens.\n\nStress Burnout Characterized by over-engagement Characterized by disengagement Emotions are overreactive Emotions are blunted Produces urgency and hyperactivity Produces helplessness and hopelessness Loss of energy Loss of energy, ideals, and hope Leads to anxiety disorders Leads to detachment and depression Primary damage is physical Primary damage is emotional May kill you prematurely May make life seem not worth living\n\nCause of Burnout\n\nBurnout often stems from your job. However, anyone who feels overworked and undervalued is at risk for burnout, the hardworking office worker who hasn’t had a vacation in years, to the frazzled stay-at-home mom tending to kids, housework, and an aging parent.\n\nBut burnout is not caused solely by stressful work or too many responsibilities. Other factors contribute to burnout, including your lifestyle and personality traits. In fact, what you do in your downtime and how you look at the world can play just as big of a role in causing overwhelming stress as work or home demands.\n\nWork-related causes of burnout include:\n\nFeeling like you have little or no control over your work.\n\nLack of recognition or reward for good work.\n\nUnclear or overly demanding job expectations.\n\nDoing work that’s monotonous or unchallenging.\n\nWorking in a chaotic or high-pressure environment.\n\nLifestyle causes of burnout include:\n\nWorking too much, without enough time for socializing or relaxing.\n\nLack of close, supportive relationships.\n\nTaking on too many responsibilities, without enough help from others.\n\nNot getting enough sleep.\n\nPersonality traits that can contribute to burnout:\n\nPerfectionistic tendencies; nothing is ever good enough.\n\nPessimistic view of yourself and the world.\n\nThe need to be in control; reluctance to delegate to others.\n\nHigh-achieving, Type A personality.\n\nDealing with Burnout\n\nWhether you recognize the warning signs of impending burnout or you’re already past the breaking point, trying to push through the exhaustion and continuing as you have been will only cause further emotional and physical damage. Now is the time to pause and change direction by learning how you can help yourself overcome burnout and feel healthy and positive again.\n\nDealing with burnout requires the “Three R” approach:\n\nRecognize. Watch for the warning signs of burnout.\n\nReverse. Undo the damage by seeking support and managing stress.\n\nResilience. Build your resilience to stress by taking care of your physical and emotional health.\n\nThe following tips for preventing or dealing with burnout can help you cope with symptoms and regain your energy, focus, and sense of well-being.\n\nTip 1: Turn to other People\n\nWhen you’re burned out, problems seem insurmountable, everything looks bleak, and it’s difficult to muster up the energy to care, let alone take action to help yourself. But you have a lot more control over stress than you may think. There are positive steps you can take to deal with overwhelming stress and get your life back into balance. One of the most effective is to reach out to others.\n\nSocial contact is nature’s antidote to stress and talking face to face with a good listener is one of the fastest ways to calm your nervous system and relieve stress. The person you talk to doesn’t have to be able to “fix” your stressors; they just have to be a good listener, someone who’ll listen attentively without becoming distracted or expressing judgment.\n\nReach out to those closest to you, such as your partner, family, and friends. Opening up won’t make you a burden to others. In fact, most friends and loved ones will be flattered that you trust them enough to confide in them, and it will only strengthen your friendship. Try not to think about what’s burning you out and make the time you spend with loved ones positive and enjoyable.\n\nBe more sociable with your coworkers. Developing friendships with people you work with can help buffer you from job burnout. When you take a break, for example, instead of directing your attention to your smartphone, try engaging your colleagues. Or schedule social events together after work.\n\nLimit your contact with negative people. Hanging out with negative-minded people who do nothing but complain will only drag down your mood and outlook. If you have to work with a negative person, try to limit the amount of time you spend together.\n\nConnect with a cause or a community group that is personally meaningful to you. Joining a religious, social, or support group can give you a place to talk to like-minded people about how to deal with daily stress—and make new friends. If your line of work has a professional association, you can attend meetings and interact with others coping with the same workplace demands.\n\nFind new friends. If you don’t feel that you have anyone to turn to, it’s never too late to build new friendships and expand your social network.\n\nTip 2: Reframe the way you look at Work\n\nWhether you have a job that leaves you rushed off your feet or one that is monotonous and unfulfilling, the most effective way to combat job burnout is to quit and find a job you love instead. Of course, for many of us changing jobs or career is far from being a practical solution, we’re grateful just to have work that pays the bills. Whatever your situation, though, there are still steps you can take to improve your state of mind.\n\nTry to find some value in your work. Even in some mundane jobs, you can often focus on how your role helps others, for example, or provides a much-needed product or service. Focus on aspects of the job that you do enjoy, even if it’s just chatting with your coworkers at lunch. Changing your attitude towards your job can help you regain a sense of purpose and control.\n\nFind balance in your life. If you hate your job, look for meaning and satisfaction elsewhere in your life: in your family, friends, hobbies, or voluntary work. Focus on the parts of your life that bring you joy.\n\nMake friends at work. Having strong ties in the workplace can help reduce monotony and counter the effects of burnout. Having friends to chat and joke with during the day can help relieve stress from an unfulfilling or demanding job, improve your job performance, or simply get you through a rough day.\n\nTake time off. If burnout seems inevitable, try to take a complete break from work. Go on vacation, use up your sick days, ask for a temporary leave of absence, anything to remove yourself from the situation. Use the time away to recharge your batteries and pursue other methods of recovery.\n\nTip 3: Reevaluate your Priorities\n\nBurnout is an undeniable sign that something important in your life is not working. Take time to think about your hopes, goals, and dreams. Are you neglecting something that is truly important to you? This can be an opportunity to rediscover what really makes you happy and to slow down and give yourself time to rest, reflect, and heal.\n\nSet boundaries. Don’t overextend yourself. Learn how to say “no” to requests on your time. If you find this difficult, remind yourself that saying “no” allows you to say “yes” to the commitments you want to make.\n\nTake a daily break from technology. Set a time each day when you completely disconnect. Put away your laptop, turn off your phone, and stop checking email or social media.\n\nNourish your creative side. Creativity is a powerful antidote to burnout. Try something new, start a fun project, or resume a favorite hobby. Choose activities that have nothing to do with work or whatever is causing your stress.\n\nSet aside relaxation time. Relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing activate the body’s relaxation response, a state of restfulness that is the opposite of the stress response.\n\nGet plenty of sleep. Feeling tired can exacerbate burnout by causing you to think irrationally. Keep your cool in stressful situations by getting a good night’s sleep.\n\nTip 4: Make Exercise a Priority\n\nEven though it may be the last thing you feel like doing when you’re burned out, exercise is a powerful antidote to stress and burnout. It’s also something you can do right now to boost your mood.\n\nAim to exercise for 30 minutes or more per day or break that up into short, 10-minute bursts of activity. A 10-minute walk can improve your mood for two hours.\n\nRhythmic exercise, where you move both your arms and legs, is a hugely effective way to lift your mood, increase energy, sharpen focus, and relax both the mind and body. Try walking, running, weight training, swimming, martial arts, or even dancing.\n\nTo maximize stress relief, instead of continuing to focus on your thoughts, focus on your body and how it feels as you move: the sensation of your feet hitting the ground, for example, or the wind on your skin.\n\nTip 5: Support your Mood and Energy Levels with a Healthy Diet\n\nWhat you put in your body can have a huge impact on your mood and energy levels throughout the day.\n\nMinimize sugar and refined carbs. You may crave sugary snacks or comfort foods such as pasta or French fries, but these high-carbohydrate foods quickly lead to a crash in mood and energy.\n\nReduce your high intake of foods that can adversely affect your moods, such as caffeine, unhealthy fats, and foods with chemical preservatives or hormones.\n\nEat more Omega-3 fatty acids to give your mood a boost.\n\nThe best sources are fatty fish (salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines), seaweed, flaxseed, and walnuts.\n\nAvoid nicotine. Smoking when you’re feeling stressed may seem calming, but nicotine is a powerful stimulant, leading to higher, not lower, levels of anxiety.\n\nDrink alcohol in moderation. Alcohol temporarily reduces worry, but too much can cause anxiety as it wears off."
