According to a 2016 study by health insurer Aetna, mental health claims among expats in MENA increased by 28%, with depression and anxiety being the most common conditions, especially among women.\n\nThere’s no question about the mental strain the pandemic has brought, especially of the prolonged kind; a new type of burnout called “late-stage pandemic” has surfaced. Even though globally and in the GCC Covid-19 vaccines provide hope of an approaching return to normal life, it’s not uncommon to be experiencing signs of burnout at this time along a new set of uncertainties.\n\nFollowing measures for an extended time has been an exhausting necessity; canceled events, wearing masks, keeping physical distances and distant learning have contributed to “pandemic fatigue.” According to a study by the Saudi Ministry of Health, recent violations of protective measures in the kingdom has contributed by half of the reported cases among younger residents.\n\n“Being vigilant for a prolonged period of time is exhausting both physically and mentally. It is a part of normal human behavior that people will flag in some ways sooner or later,” Dr. Haya Zedan, a public health professional and vice dean of graduate studies and scientific research at the Saudi Electronic University in Riyadh said.\n\nPsychologist Dr. Sarah Rasmi highlights how this updated way of living has especially affected working mothers, with balancing career and parenting. “When there is a perceived inequity in the distribution of domestic work, it can breed resentment, irritability and frustration at home, which can also be problematic,” she told Arabian Business.\n\nWays to manage pandemic burnout\n\nMaking a list of coping techniques that work for you can be a good start in acknowledging what helps your specific situations, explains psychiatrist Jessica Gold. Writing down these skills and techniques can be helpful in times of stress.\n\nYour to-do list might take a hit because of a lack of motivation, face the possibility that some changes need to be applied here. Being upset about not getting enough done can mean that sometimes we set unattainable expectations. Breaking down goals into smaller tasks is one way to still get things done in times of less motivation, says Gold.\n\nPrioritizing self-care and socializing (in available ways) are two important aspects to focus on to get out a burnout slump, you can start making big (travel?) plans for after the pandemic.\n\nFinally, as psychologist and author Joe Oliver’s advices, “This will pass too. Remember that this situation is temporary.”\n\nHitting your ‘pandemic wall’?
