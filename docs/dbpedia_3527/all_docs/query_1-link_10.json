        "text": "Let’s be honest, being a student is difficult. You’ve got classes to attend, projects to work on, assignments due and exams waiting around. Add work and social commitments to the pile and you’ve got a recipe for good ol’ academic burnout.\n\nAccording to a survey released by The Ohio State University’s Office of the Chief Wellness Officer, student burnout was at 71 per cent in April 2021. The pandemic and stress of virtual learning were cited as contributions to the increase in numbers.\n\nWhat is academic burnout?\n\nUniversity of the People describes academic burnout as a negative emotional, physical, and mental reaction to prolonged study that results in exhaustion, frustration, lack of motivation and reduced ability in school.\n\nStudying the same subject matter for a prolonged period or working on similar assignments or projects in the long term can cause this chronic condition.\n\nHow does academic burnout affect you?\n\nWhile it is easy to confuse burnout with temporary stress of being a student, ignoring the symptoms can lead to developing severe mental health issues like depression and anxiety.\n\nSo, in order to overcome burnout, you first need to recognize it. Some common symptoms of academic burnout are:\n\nExhaustion\n\nIt is normal to feel tired after pulling all-nighters in a school week. But, if you feel like a dementor’s sucked the soul out of you even after getting a good night’s sleep, it might be a sign you’re going through burnout.\n\nLack of motivation\n\nPicture this: You’re halfway through the school year. You’ve got a class to attend, two assignments to submit and friends to meet. But you can’t find it in you to even lift a finger because it feels like all motivation has been drowned out. Yup, this is a cause for concern.\n\nConstant irritability\n\nYes, your roommate “breathing” isn’t a good enough reason to be annoyed by them. Feeling constantly irritated by the slightest inconvenience is an effect of burnout.\n\nPhysical illness\n\nIf you’re frequently falling ill, this could be your body reflecting the effects of burnout. Insomnia, headaches, digestive issues, and body pain are common symptoms of burnout.\n\nAlso, burnout can lead to the development of harmful habits like stress-eating and revenge bedtime procrastination.\n\nHow to overcome academic burnout?\n\nNow that you know what burnout looks like, lets focus on how to tackle it.\n\nIdentify the cause\n\nWhat is the source of your burnout? Is the workload too heavy or have you lost your passion for the course? Once you recognize the cause, you can work on solving it.\n\nYou could create a planner to schedule tasks that’ll help with time-management. Or you could opt to change your subjects and enroll in classes that you are truly passionate about.\n\nTake a break\n\nRest is a biological need. Taking a break not only gives your body some much needed rest, but it also helps in resetting your mind.\n\nSet out specific timings during the day and on weekends to unwind from academic stress and focus on nurturing your wellbeing.\n\nChange your lifestyle\n\nIf you’re experiencing burnout, it means something in your current routine isn’t working for you. Take a step back and evaluate your lifestyle. Focus on developing healthy sleeping and eating habits to steer yourself towards a positive lifestyle change.\n\nAlso, exercising daily is a great way to relieve stress and keep yourself physically and mentally fit.\n\nSocialize\n\nSorry to break it to you but scrolling through social media and socializing are two different things. So, put that phone down and go meet or get on a call with real human beings. This will not only elevate your mood, but also help you de-stress.\n\nReach out for help\n\nSometimes all you need is another person’s perspective to be steered towards the right direction. So don’t be shy to reach out to your loved ones for some extra support.\n\nAlso, trying to overcome academic burnout by yourself can be tough. So, make use of Humber’s Student Wellness and Accessibility Centre’s counselling services to help address your issues.\n\nSWAC’s free, confidential, and virtual services are available to all Humber and University of Guelph-Humber students can help:\n\nAddress your issues\n\nSupport you\n\nHelp you work towards attaining your goals\n\nAnd help you function effectively as a learner.\n\nTo book your appointment, visit the SWAC’s website or email [email protected].\n\nHard times always lead to something great. So, don’t be discouraged as you work on yourself because future you will be grateful for the help!\n\nAnd don’t forget, IGNITE will always have your back through it all!\n\nWorried about college? Here are 6 little things that can make your student life easier."
