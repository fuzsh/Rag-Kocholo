        "text": "I love Paradise myself. I'm very glad they patched in the option to restart races though, originally you had to manually drive back to the start every time.\n\nI like the lack of rigid structure which seems to be exactly what the OP dislikes, ah well to each his own\n\n0\n\nI still think Burnout Revenge is the best.\n\nI like Paradise but I don't like it anywhere near as much as the older style Burnout games because I hate the free roam BS. I'd prefer to be able to just pick a race/event from a menu & then go race rather than having to drive around looking to events.\n\nParadise is actually the 1st Burnout game I've never played through to 100% complete, Got bored/fed up about 30% through.\n\n0\n\nYes Burnout Revenge was an awsome game, as was Burnout 2 which I also loved.\n\nI didn't think much of Burnout Dominator personally. Criteron should have left all the elements of Burnout Revenge for this game, as it feels like a bit of a backward step.\n\nAt first I didn't rank Burnout Paradise either, but the more you play this it does get a lot easier and once you learn all the routes and all the roads, this game will keep you hooked for hours\n\n0"
