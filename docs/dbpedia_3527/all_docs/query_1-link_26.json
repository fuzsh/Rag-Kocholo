        "text": "SIGNS OF STRESS & TRIGGERS\n\n\"...the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases defines burnout as a 'state of vital exhaustion.' The Maslach Burnout Inventory, which is considered the gold standard in research studies for estimating burnout prevalence among physicians, captures three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion from overwhelming work demands, depersonalization (e.g., impersonal response toward patients or coworkers) and a perceived lack of personal accomplishment. Symptoms of burnout can be physical (e.g., insomnia, fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal upset) and psychological (e.g., irritability, cynicism, decreased concentration).\" - CMAJ, Fralick & Flegel, June, 2014.\n\nPhysical Symptoms\n\nAnxiety/ Panic attacks / Shortness of breath\n\nChest pain/palpitations\n\nHeadaches\n\nMuscle aches - back, head, stiff jaw...\n\nFatigue/lethargy\n\nGastrointestinal distress\n\nSleep disorders\n\nWeight gain/loss\n\nEmotional Symptoms\n\nLoss of humour\n\nIrritability/resentment/bitterness\n\nDepressed mood/apathy\n\nFeelings of failure/guilt/blame\n\nDisinterested in the things that usually bring you joy (i.e. music, hobbies, etc.)\n\nCognitive Symptoms\n\nPoor concentration\n\nRigidity/resistance to change\n\nSuspicion/mistrust\n\nStereotyping\n\nObjectification/distancing\n\nRuminations (of leaving, revenge, and so on)\n\nBehavioural Symptoms\n\nWork avoidance (absenteeism, clock-watching)\n\nDiminished personal conduct with patients/colleagues\n\nInflexible behaviour\n\nHabitual lateness\n\nAddiction (alcohol, drugs, affairs, shopping)\n\nAttempted suicide\n\nTriggers\n\nPressure to see high volume of patients\n\nPiles of paperwork\n\nComplicated and confusing rules and guidelines\n\nDr. Oz and the like\n\nMedia's coverage of the latest research/studies\n\nDrug seekers and inability to say no to patients\n\nPolitics and medicine (hospital administrators, gov't contract, OHIP billing)\n\nConstant weight of responsibility\n\nDifficult procedures\n\nDifficult patients\n\nLoss of a patient\n\nBlood Borne Pathogen (BBP) exposure\n\nMedicolegal matters\n\nWorry of potential jeopardy to reputation due to one bad case\n\nFamily pressures\n\nHospital Administrative pressures\n\nColleague pressures/conflicts\n\nSources: Support4Doctors, Physician's Weekly, OMA\n\nResources\n\nIf you're a General Surgeon struggling with mental wellness who needs help now, the Ontario Medical Association has a program in place to assist:\n\nOMA Toll Free: 1-800-851-6606 (M-F; 8:45am-5pm)\n\nOTHER AFTER HOURS EMERGENCY/CRISIS PREVENTION:\n\nOntario Distress Centres: 416-486-2242\n\nCentre for Suicide Prevention (based out of Calgary but serves across Canada): 403-266-HELP (4357)\n\n211 Ontario Community & Social Services (or dial 211 from your phone and someone will help you directly or else refer you to the appropriate options within your community)\n\nMOHLTC\n\n- ConnexOntario Health Services Information - www.connexontario.ca\n\n- Drug and Alcohol Helpline: 1-800-565-8603; http://www.drugandalcoholhelpline.ca/\n\n- Ontario Problem Gambling Hotline: 1-888-230-3505; http://www.problemgamblinghelpline.ca\n\n- Mental Health Helpline: 1-866-531-2600; http://www.mentalhealthhelpline.ca/\n\nOMA\n\nOMA Physician Health Program - http://php.oma.org/; 1-800-851-6606 (confidential toll free)\n\nOMA Physician Health: Burnout & Stress - download video\n\nOMA Physician Strategies for Coping with Stress - download\n\nOMA Tips & Advice for Physicians Helping Colleagues Experiencing Burnout (M.Goldstein)- download audio\n\nOMA Physician Health Program: Mental Health & Burnout Discussion (J.Albuquerque) - download audio\n\nCMPA\n\nCoping with the stress of medical practice\n\nCMA\n\nCMA Physician Health and Wellness\n\nOTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES\n\n211 Ontario Community & Social Services (or dial 211 from your phone)\n\nCanadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP)\n\nCASP blog"
