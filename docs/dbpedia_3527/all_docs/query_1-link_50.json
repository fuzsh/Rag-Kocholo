        "text": "What is the best material to use for ragdoll making?\n\nFlannel or cotton fabrics are popular choices for making ragdolls as they are soft, durable, and easy to work with. Another good option is fleece, which is also soft and comes in a variety of colors and patterns perfect for creating unique ragdoll characters. Ultimately, the best material will depend on the specific design and feel you want to achieve for your ragdoll.\n\nHow does burnout occur?\n\nBurnout occurs when an individual experiences prolonged stress and feels overwhelming emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. It often stems from working in a high-pressure environment with excessive demands and limited resources, leading to a sense of disillusionment and reduced productivity. Ignoring signs of burnout can worsen the condition and impact overall well-being.\n\nHow do you use slow motion in torque burnout?\n\nTo use slow motion in Torque Burnout, you need to have enough tokens to activate the feature. Once you have enough tokens, during a drift or burnout, you can tap the slow-motion button located on the screen to activate the slow-motion effect. Keep in mind that slow motion consumes tokens each time you use it."
