        "text": "Freddie Mercury Rocking A Silver Jumpsuit\n\nFarrokh “Freddie” Mercury, the lead vocalist of the band, Queen, sure knew how to put some extra glitz into his already stellar performance. Donning a silver jumpsuit while rocking the stage in 1977, this photo shows just how far beyond amazing this legend really was. The rock icon is best known for his hits such as “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Somebody to Love,” “Crazy Little Thing Called Love,” and “We Are the Champions.”\n\nThe British artist also worked as a producer and offered his talent as a guest musician for other singers. Mercury died in 1991 due to bronchopneumonia (a complication of AIDS). A tribute concert was held in London to honor the legendary rocker. He was also inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in the prestigious Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSteven Seagal Looking A Tad Like Michael Bolton\n\nHere’s a throwback photo of martial arts extraordinaire, Steven Seagal, that will make you think he can pass as Michael Bolton’s long-lost twin. Seagal made his acting debut in 1988, in the action movie, \"Above the Law,\" and had starred in four hit films by the time 1991 rolled around.\n\nThe actor, martial artist and producer is also a guitarist and collaborated with Stevie Wonder and Tony Rebel on his debut album. Seagal is an active environmentalist, animal activist and has been involved in businesses selling energy drinks and therapeutic oils. He has seven children from his four relationships and also serves as a guardian to the only child of Tibet’s 10th Panchen Lama.\n\nThe Star-studded Cast Of The Outsiders (1982)\n\nCan we have a reboot of \"The Outsiders,\" pretty please? This photo is like a dream with Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon and C. Thomas Howell. It was taken on the set of the coming-of-age drama some time in 1982. The movie garnered positive reviews and had an impressive performance at the box office.\n\nWho wouldn’t be amazed with a gross of $33 million on a $10 million budget? The classic film was an on-screen adaptation, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, of the novel of the same name. Packed with a star-studded cast, we hope there will be a reunion of these cool guys sometime soon.\n\nThe Lovely Shania Twain\n\nEilleen Regina Edwards, professionally known as Shania Twain, is no doubt a music icon. The best-selling female artist in country music has sold over 100 million records, earning her the “Queen of Country Pop” title. The multiple Grammy award winner knows how to nail her performances as her every album has been a phenomenal hit.\n\nHer third album, titled “Come On Over,” became the best-selling album of all time by a female in any genre. Wow! As impressive as it gets, Twain also earned an incredible achievement as the only female artist whose three consecutive albums were certified Diamond. With a lovely face, a kind heart and a talented soul, a woman like Twain truly deserves every bit of success she gets.\n\nMay Britt And Sammy Davis. Jr, On Their Wedding Day\n\nPhotographed here are the beautiful newlyweds, actor, and singer Sammy Davis Jr. and actress May Britt. The couple first met in 1959, dated and got married within less than a year; to be exact, they tied the knot on November 13, 1960. Did you know that the wedding had a spark of controversy?\n\nRumors were rife at the time that Robert F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy instructed Frank Sinatra to tell Davis to schedule his marriage with Britt after the 1960 Presidential election as interracial marriage was forbidden by the law in most states of America during that time. While they were game-changers in this sense, and important ones at that, after eight years of marriage, Britt filed for divorce after learning that her husband was cheating on her. They had three children together.\n\nFresh Prince Of Bel-Air Cast At Playboy Mansion With Hugh Hefner\n\nThis cool photo shows the cast members of the American sitcom, \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" Will Smith, Karyn Parsons, and Alfonso Ribeiro hanging out at the Playboy mansion with Hugh Hefner. The show had a successful six-year run (1990-1996) and aired 148 episodes.\n\nThe show follows the story of “The Fresh Prince” whose lifestyle gets him in trouble and sees him sent to stay with his relatives in their Bel Air mansion. The show is also notable for its star-studded guests that include Queen Latifah, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Jones, Donald Trump, and Quincy Jones, among many others. A possible reboot might happen with Will Smith as a producer. When? That we don’t know.\n\nSteve McQueen And Jacqueline Bisset In \"Bullitt\"\n\nWhat happens when the king of cool is paired with a stunning leading lady? Better ask Steve McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset who created headlines for being an item while they were filming the thriller movie, \"Bullitt.\" The rumors were not surprising at the time, considering McQueen’s reputation for womanizing.\n\nEven McQueen’s wife (yep, he was married) adored Bisset’s beauty, commenting that she was the most beautiful leading lady her husband ever had. Bisset set the record straight by saying, “no, we did not have an affair. People write things and have done for many years. Yes, he was handsome, friendly and nice and there was a little bit of teasing, but nothing happened.”\n\nVictoria Leigh Blum aka Tanya Roberts\n\nWhat’s not to love about the pretty and talented actress/producer Victoria Leigh Blum (best known by her stage name Tanya Roberts)? The star was born in the Bronx, New York and was keen on making a brighter future ahead of her. Featured on \"That 70s Show\" as Midge Pinciotti, she transitioned from modeling to acting and producing.\n\nIn the fifth installment of the TV series, \"Charlie’s Angels\" (1980), she replaced Shelley Hack. In 1982, she graced the cover of Playboy magazine to promote her adventure film \"The Beastmaster.\" Seen with beauty, grace and talent on and off cam, Tanya Roberts got her notable role as Stacey Sutton in the 1985 James Bond movie, \"A View to a Kill.\"\n\nThe Late Hugh Hefner With Girlfriend, Model Barbi Benton\n\nTaken in 1970, this portrait of Playboy founder, Hugh Hefner, and his longtime love, Barbi Benton, shows one of their sweet and happy moments. The oddly hot couple met in 1968 during the set of his TV show, Playboy After Dark. Barbi was 18 then and pursuing her college degree, while Hugh was 42 years old and had already established a stable career.\n\nThe huge age gap was the main reason why the young Barbi was uninterested in staying with Hugh long-term. Not to mention that she was in a relationship at the time. But with Hugh’s persistence, the two became a coupe and traveled to many countries together. Due to his infidelity, Barbi moved out from the Playboy mansion three times. Obviously, their relationship wasn’t for keeps.\n\nGrace Kelly And Her Effortless Beauty\n\nSay hello to this timeless beauty—Grace Kelly relaxing in a pool back in 1955. Kelly enjoyed stardom in the entertainment industry during the Golden Age of Television. She appeared in films like \"Mogambo,\" \"The Country Girl,\" \"High Noon\" and \"To Catch a Thief,\" among many others. After six years of her award-winning success as an actress, she married Prince Rainier III and graced her duties as the Princess of Monaco.\n\nThe beautiful royal couple had three children namely Caroline, Albert, and Stephanie. Despite her absence from the movie industry, Kelly is a force to be reckoned with, her iconic status and contributions as an artist, and as a real-life princess, incomparable.\n\nBob Dylan And Robert De Niro Hanging Out Backstage\n\nWhen two of the finest artists hang out, they deserve nothing less than a souvenir photo. This snap of the awesome guys was taken at the Roxy, backstage, sometime in 1976. What a pair! Bob Dylan, a ten-time Grammy Award winner, and inducted member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Robert De Niro, a prized actor/producer with many accolades to his name (like two Academy awards, a Golden Globe and two Primetime Emmy awards, among many others).\n\nThe pair were snapped in attendance at a concert of Ronee Blakley’s. Yes, folks, it’s possible that legends from different fields can be friends. Did we say that they were also photographed with Lainie Kazan and Sally Kirkland that same night? Great minds think alike, right?\n\nThe Adorable Lucille Ball And Desi Arnaz When Young\n\nThere’s too much cuteness in this photo! Can you tell that the left image was of Lucille Ball who was two years old at the time? On the right was six-year-old Desi Arnaz. Later on, these two became one of Hollywood’s super-couples. They starred together on their own hit show, \"I Love Lucy,\" which won multiple Emmy awards and other nominations.\n\nThe show enjoyed a successful run from 1951 to 1957 and became the most-watched show in the U.S. at the time. Although naive and a troublemaker, Lucy had big dreams; we suppose this is what made the show a hilarious success.\n\nKISS Bassist, Gene Simmons, Sans Makeup Or Costume\n\nPictured here is Gene Klein, professionally known as Gene Simmons, without any makeup or costume. The Israeli-American musician and television personality is the co-singer and bassist of rock band, KISS. The Demon (his famous stage persona) lives in Los Angeles with his wife, actress, and former Playboy Playmate, Shannon Lee Tweed.\n\nSimmons used to date the Queen of Pop, Cher. Theirs was an odd, open relationship which Cher described as being, “the best relationship I’ve ever had with a human being.” She admitted that she was crazy about Gene. “Gene might spend time with another woman and stay the night, but he wants her to leave in the morning so he can get on with his day.”\n\nThe Stunning Tuesday Weld!\n\nAlthough, she retired from acting, Tuesday Weld (born as Susan Weld) still stuns on and off the camera. The lovely actress began acting as a child; perhaps this is the reason why she left show business. Her mature roles took place in the late 1950s and, after a decade, she earned her very first Golden Globe award for Most Promising Female Newcomer.\n\nThe next decade was magical for Weld as she was able to establish herself as a dramatic actress. Her notable roles in films like \"Play It as It Lays\" (1972) earned her Golden Globe award nominations. And the talented actress received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\" (1977).\n\nTina Louise In The 1960s Film, \"The Warrior Empress\"\n\nVersatility is the word that best describes Tina Louise for her talent as an actress, singer, and author. The stunning woman earned popularity for playing Ginger Grant on the CBS comedy, \"Gilligan’s Island.\" Louise clashed with the showrunner because she believed that her character was too harsh. Although they reached a compromise, she often had disagreements regarding her role.\n\nIn 1958, she landed her breakthrough role in the movie, \"God’s Little Acre,\" which earned her a Golden Globe award in the category of New Star of the Year. Tina Louise starred in many Hollywood films such as \"The Trap,\" \"The Hangman,\" and \"The Stepford Wives,\" among others. Louise is also an advocate of child literacy and has volunteered her time at local public schools.\n\nBritish Film Icon, Sir Michael Caine\n\nApparently, Sir Michael Caine is showing off his fists in this old photo taken in 1969. With a colorful career spanning 70 years and counting, it is just right that he is regarded as a British film icon. Famous for his cockney accent, Caine appeared in various films with stellar performances as Ebenezer Scrooge in \"The Muppet Christmas Carol,\" and as Alfred Pennyworth in \"The Dark Knight Trilogy.\"\n\nHe also starred in British films like \"Zulu\" (1964) and \"Alfie\" (1966). His career shone bright during the 1980s when he earned a Golden Globe for Best Actor, a BAFTA, and then an Academy award for Best Supporting Actor. Wow!\n\nLost In Space\n\nWho could forget the famous sci-fi TV series, \"Lost in Space?\" The show follows the exciting adventures of the Robinsons, a family of scientists who braved the depths of space. The show ran for three installments (1965-1968) and aired a total of 83 episodes.\n\nOne of the special characters of the thrilling show is the Robot (voiced by Dick Tufeld), which had no name. Its relationship with Dr. Zachary Smith (played by Jonathan Harris) provided comical humor and a lot of misadventures. To prove its superpowers, the robot displayed human emotions, like sadness and laughter, was equipped with modern weaponry and, of course, boasted incredible strength.\n\nElvis Presley In Jailhouse Rock\n\n\"Jailhouse Rock\" was a 1957 musical drama helmed by Richard Thorp and starring none other than the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll, Elvis Presley. The film features a young man who was sentenced to jail for manslaughter. Following his release from prison, the young man meets a musical promoter who helps him launch his musical career and, when he establishes himself as a big star, his relationships start to suffer.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film nabbed the 3rd spot on the Variety box office chart and earned $4 million. With the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll himself as the lead star, and a controversial storyline, the movie deserves its box office recognition.\n\nGeorge Carlin Doing His Stand-up Comedy Routine\n\nThis photo, taken back in the 1960s, serves as a reminder that George Carlin was a natural stand-up comedian. Carlin was noted for his black comedy, delving into such topics as religion, psychology, and politics. It was in 1959 when he met Jack Burns and they decided to collaborate as a comedy duo. They had numerous hilarious performances in Fort Worth, Texas before going to California in February 1960.\n\nCarlin died of cardiac arrest on June 22, 2008, but his meaningful contributions to the entertainment industry have influenced a lot of writers and comedians like Kevin Smith, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld, and Bill Maher to name a few.\n\nGeorge Harrison, John Lennon & Billy Preston For The \"Get Back\" Project\n\nJust like any band, The Beatles had their share of tension and anxiety. Back in January of 1969, the iconic band seemed to not get along well with each other. Hostility was evident over Yoko Ono allegedly taking advantage of the group and Paul McCartney was being tagged as “bossing” the group around. It was a good thing that an old friend, in the form of Billy Preston, stepped in.\n\nThe Beatles were all huge fans of Preston. In fact, George Harrison and Preston had a deep friendship, and having him around was a big blessing. When Harrison invited Preston to play with the band on the \"Get Back\" project, it was a collaborative success music-wise, and of course, their relationship with each other professionally and personally.\n\nJohn Stamos And His Prom Date\n\nThis photo is legit evidence that John Stamos is vain (we’re kidding, of course). Look how he intended to have a twinning hairstyle with his prom date back in 1981. More than a handsome face, Stamos is one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood. His stellar performance as Blackie Parrish on the TV series, \"General Hospital,\" earned him a nomination for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor.\n\nHe also starred as Jesse Katsopolis on the sitcom, \"Full House,\" as Dr. Tony Gates on the medical drama, \"ER,\" and as Albert in the revival of \"Bye Bye Birdie.\" He also served as a producer of the Netflix series, \"Fuller House.\" What can’t John Stamos do?\n\nOpening Day Of Star Wars At Leicester Square Theatre in London In 1977\n\nGeorge Lucas’s \"Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope\" was the first installment of what would go on to be the original \"Star Wars\" series. You know the one? It’s only a worldwide phenomenon with new story arcs emerging in film, animation, and video games to this day. The star-studded film included Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and focussed on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Death Star.\n\nThis photo was taken during its grand opening day at Leicester Square Theatre in London in 1977. Apparently, moviegoers were too excited to witness entertainment at its finest and were willing to form a queue just to watch the highly-anticipated film and their favorite stars.\n\nDavid Bowie Modeling With Jan De Souza\n\nDavid Robert Jones, better known as David Bowie, is photographed here modeling the designs of John Stephen with Jan De Souza. The shot was taken by photographer, Fiona Adams, for a British Pop Music magazine back in 1965. Bowie was considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century for his eccentric stage presence and unique music. The world was rocked by his death in 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, he was awarded ten platinum, 11 gold, and eight silver album certifications. In the United States, he earned five platinum and nine gold certifications. By 1996, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Such an impressive music portfolio.\n\nStallone and Butkus\n\nA week before Sylvester Stallone was able to sell his script for the first \"Rocky\" movie, he was a nobody — pretty desperate and strapped for cash. So much so, that as a last-resort kind of act, he sold his huge Bull Mastiff, Butkus to a random guy named Little Jimmy. He walked away crying and heartbroken and swore that he would return to buy it back the second he could.\n\nLuckily, that wasn't very long after. The following week, he sold the script for an unbelievable sum of one million dollars and set out to keep his promise. Little Jimmy, however, bargained, and Butkus was bought back by his original owner for no less than 3,000 dollars.\n\nPaul McCartney's Response To John Lennon’s Controversial Comment\n\nIn a 1966 interview with Maureen Cleave, Lennon debated that Christianity was dropping away and that rock music would likely outlast it. “We’re more popular than Jesus now; I don’t know which will go first – rock ‘n’ roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It’s them twisting it that ruins it for me,” said Lennon.\n\nHis statements, understandably, didn’t go down well, well hence the public outrage. You kind of can’t say “We’re bigger than Jesus” without sounding like a megalomaniac. Protests erupted in the US, radio stations stopped playing their music and Beatles albums were burned.\n\nPaul Newman on the Set of \"The Young Philadelphians\"\n\nThis photo of Paul Newman was taken sometime in 1959 during his shooting of the drama film, \"The Young Philadelphians.\" The award-winning actor also worked as a director, producer, and racecar driver. He won an Oscar for his thrilling performance in \"The Color of Money,\" a BAFTA award, and an Emmy award, among many others.\n\nNewman also starred in \"The Hustler,\" \"Harper,\" \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" and \"The Verdict.\" If you’re a big fan of Disney-Pixar's \"Cars,\" Newman was the voice behind Doc Hudson in the first installment of the film. He died of lung cancer when he was 83 years old.\n\nPaul Newman, Katherine Ross, and Robert Redford\n\nHere’s a classic shot of one of the greatest films ever made in the history of Hollywood. Taken on the set of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" back in 1969, Paul Newman, Katherine Ross, and Robert Redford posed with poker faces.\n\nThe American Western movie was helmed by George Roy Hill and is based on the story of Wild West outlaws, Robert LeRoy Parker and his partner Harry Longabaugh. Aside from reaching its box-office mark of over $100 million (astounding considering it was made in the 60s), the film was chosen for the US National Film Registry for its historical significance. Moreover, it received an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nOn The Original Set Of \"Ghostbusters\"\n\nThis photo was taken on the Ghostbusters movie set, back in 1984. The life-sized Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was built by Bill Bryan using miniatures and optical compositing. The suit had two layers—the inner layer was fireproof and the outer layer was flammable. \"Ghostbusters\" was the first installment in the original series.\n\nThe science fiction comedy follows three eccentric New York City parapsychologists who started their own business investigating and catching ghosts after being terminated from Columbia University. Dubbed one of the most successful comedy movies back in the 80s, the film featured Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson. With a US$30 million budget, it grossed around US$240 million throughout the US and over US$50 million in the international market.\n\nBrigitte Bardot On A Smoke Break\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot is one of the most famous sex symbols of the 1950s. The French actress and artist is also an animal rights activist. Truly a fashion icon, Bardot’s hairstyle, makeup, and fashion sense continue to inspire a lot of women across the globe. In her younger years, she dreamt of becoming a ballerina. She earned international acting recognition in 1957 for her provocative role in the controversial drama, \"And God Created Woman.\"\n\nBrigitte Bardot retired from acting in 1973 with 47 films and 60 songs under her belt. Bardot had numerous relationships with prominent men including French director Robert Vadim, musician Gilbert Becaud, and German millionaire playboy Gunter Sachs.\n\nSiblings, Shirley MacLaine And Warren Beatty\n\nIf you’re a fan of Warren Beatty, you must know for a fact that he has a biological sister; and that said sister is none other than Shirley MacLaine. MacLaine started her acting career ahead of Beatty and he didn’t want to gain popularity as Shirley’s brother.\n\nWhen asked why Beatty was so interested in filmmaking over acting, MacLaine said “That's why he's more comfortable behind the camera, he's in the total-control aspect. He has to have control over everything.” Beatty won an Academy Award for Best Director for \"Reds\" and earned nominations for Best Actor, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.

A New York Times critic recognized Reeves' versatility in his craft, by saying that the Canadian actor \"displays considerable discipline and range... he moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.”\n\nReeves explored his artistic side by engaging in music and playing bass guitar for the bands Dogstar and Becky. He also delivered a thrilling performance onstage as Prince Hamlet and penned the text for a picture book, \"Ode to Happiness.\" Then, of course, who could forget when the internet fell in love with him via the “sad Keanu” meme?\n\nFabulous Sigourney Weaver In The 80s\n\nSusan Alexandra “Sigourney” Weaver earned her popularity when she played the lead role of Ellen Ripley in the 1979 sci-fi film, \"Alien.\" reprising the role in three sequels earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

They first met Maharishi in 1967, while the famous Transcendental Meditation teacher was in England for a lecture tour. This particular trip of the famous band proved to be productive and gained a lot of media attention.\n\nThe English rock band, especially George Harrison, was instrumental in shaping Western attitudes and behaviors about Indian spirituality.

And yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really.”\n\nThe Monkeemobile, A Modified Pontiac GTO\n\nThis is a literal picture of a gorgeous vintage car—the Monkeemobile. It is, basically, an improved Pontiac GTO designed and created by the infamous car designer, Dean Jeffries. He specifically styled and built it for the rock and pop band, The Monkees, who had a TV program of the same name.

The ABC show starred Michael Cole as Pete, Peggy Lipton as Julie, and Clarence Williams III as Linc. They were the first young, undercover detectives on the small screen.

He landed his breakthrough role as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the 1975 cult classic, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\" He also delivered exemplary performances as Darkness in the classic fantasy, \"Legend,\" and as Pennywise the Clown in Stephen King’s original screen production of \"IT.\"\n\nSadly, Curry suffered a major stroke in 2012.

He never married, nor had any adopted or biological children.\n\nWhat Computers Looked Like Back In 1983\n\nIf you’re wondering what computers looked like prior to the 20th century, this picture will give you all the nostalgic feels. Taken in 1983, this was the time when personal computers were chunky and huge, complete with frustrating graphics. Take note, during this decade, these traditional computers were anything but awesome (though they seemed cool at the time).\n\nIt offers a simplicity that’s a far cry from the state-of-the-art desktops and laptops that we are using right now. Heck, our smartphones are more powerful computers than the rigs people were using in the 80s! It’s nice to be reminded of just how content we all were in the 80s, even though the technology wasn’t so advanced. It’s a far cry from modern times, which keeps the consumers asking for more, hence the countless new models that leave us feeling constantly outdated with our tech.\n\nRaquel Welch And Ringo Starr While Filming \"The Magic Christian\"\n\nPhotographed back in 1969 was the gorgeous Raquel Welch ‘whipping’ Ringo Starr while on the set of The Magic Christian. The black comedy was an adaptation of the comic novel of the same title. The movie follows the life of Sir Guy Grand, the world’s richest man, and his relationship with his adopted son, Youngman. Together they prove that they can make such an incredible duo that anyone and anything has a price.\n\nThe cast was also led by Peter Sellers and included appearances by John Cleese, Christopher Lee, Spike Milligan, and Roman Polanski.

Their unique, custom, bug-like outfits were specially made for the show by the infamous George Barris.\n\nKurt Cobain And Courtney Love\n\nYoung love, anyone? Here’s a 1992 photo of Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain and Hole’s Courtney Love. the couple met in 1990 at a nightclub in London. Although Cobain liked Love, he refused her advances.\n\n\"I was determined to be a bachelor for a few months [...] But I knew that I liked Courtney so much right away that it was a really hard struggle to stay away from her for so many months,\" he said. In 1994, just two years after they were married, Cobain took his own life at the age of 27. His battle with depression and substances consumed him.\n\nHugh Hefner With Playboy ‘Bunnies’ Penny Marshall And Carrie Fisher\n\nHere’s the story behind this classic, sexy photo: In 1982, Carrie Fisher made an appearance on ABC sitcom, \"Laverne & Shirley,\" in an episode called, “The Playboy Show.” When Rhonda asks Laverne to get a job application for her at the nearest Playboy Bunny Club, the unexpected happens—it’s Laverne who receives the job offer and accepts it, despite her father’s objections.\n\nIn said episode, Hugh Hefner makes a cameo, together with Carrie Fisher, as she renders her awkward performance of \"My Guy.” The show had a successful run for eight seasons and earned nominations from the Golden Globes and Primetime Emmy awards.\n\nThe First American Supermodel, Cheryl Rae Tiegs\n\nBorn in Breckenridge, Minnesota, Tiegs was an iconic figure of pop culture during the 1970s. She was the first American Supermodel who graced the covers of Time, and the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. She had a break in modeling when she posed for a swimsuit ad when she was just 17 years old.\n\nGlamour magazine’s editorial staff bypassed the traditional process of hiring her and instead booked her immediately on a shoot with Ali McGraw. The rest, as they say, is history. The iconic supermodel appeared on the cover pages of Vogue and other major magazines throughout the years. Need we say more?\n\nNicole Eggert Of \"Who's the Boss?\"\n\nNicole Elizabeth Eggert started her career in the movie industry at a young age. She landed a role as Candice Bergen’s daughter in the movie, \"Rich and Famous,\" when she was just eight years old. From there, her acting talent was noticed and from 1985 to 1986, she had a recurring role as Marci Ferguson on the American sitcom, \"Who’s the Boss?\"\n\nIn 1989, she hosted the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards and became the first guest star in \"The Super Mario Bros.

Mansfield was a famous sex symbol between the 1950s and 1960s and was notorious for her wardrobe “malfunctions” and other publicity stunts. Although her career in the film industry was short-lived, she enjoyed box-office successes and earned a Golden Globe and a small collection of Theater Globe awards.\n\nHer notable performances were seen in \"The Girl Can’t Help It,\" and \"Too Hot to Handle,\" among many others. Mansfield got married and divorced three times and was also romantically involved with John and Robert F. Kennedy. Those Kennedys clearly had a type, huh? She died at the age of 34 in a car accident.\n\nThe Stunning Natalie Wood\n\nBorn as Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko, Natalie Wood began her movie career as a child and became successful in Hollywood with three Academy Award nominations to her name before she’d even turned 25 years old.

While accidental drowning was declared as her cause of death, the bruises and substances revealed by investigations sparked a few speculations.\n\nPin-up Model, Margaret Nolan, As A Bond Girl\n\nActress and former glamour model, Margaret Nolan, used the name Vicky Kennedy when her modeling career took off. She landed the role of James Bond’s masseuse in the 1964 film, Goldfinger. She was eyeing for the highly coveted golden girl role but it went to Shirley Eaton. Nolan also appeared in \"A Hard Day’s Night,\" \"Crossroads,\" \"Steptoe and Son,\" \"The Sweeney\" and \"Crown Court.\"\n\nWhen asked about her liberating image, she responded by saying “It does celebrate the physical form. If I'd been nude it might have been about liberation because up to that point, you wouldn't have seen a nude woman in a publicly visible thing like that. I could have been very pretentious and said this is liberating. But because I was dressed up anyway I didn't get that sense.”\n\nSally Field Wins an Oscar\n\nWhile many serious filmmakers and critics take issue with the glamorous Hollywood event, referring to it as more of a popularity contest than anything else, it still must be an incredible feeling to snatch up the Best Actor award. Who said winning a popularity contest has to be bad anyway? The highly acclaimed actress, Sally Field proved to the world that there is no shame when she received the award in 1985 for the film \"Places in the Heart.\"\n\nIn her speech, the actress famously cried to the audience...\"The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me! Thank you.\"\n\nCarrie Fisher and Paul Simon One of the most turbulent love affairs in celeb romance history, Paul Simon and Carrie Fisher spent a decade in an on-again and off-again relationship. Fisher met Simon in 1977 while filming \"Star Wars.\" By 1983 the two were wed. Unfortunately, that marriage only lasted one year. That, of course, didn't stop the musician and actress from trying things out again, and again.\n\nSimon claims to have loved Fisher long after they ended. The Princess Leia actress never re-married after that and used a lot of their relationship in her films. Fisher died from cardiac arrest on a plane on January 9, 2017. She will forever be remembered for her iconic role in \"Star Wars\" as well as her incredibly well-crafted books and screenplays.\n\nDrew Barrymore and Steven Spielberg Acting Like a Family\n\nIt all started when the 6-year-old Drew Barrymore lied her way into the role of Gertie in the classic fantasy film, \"E.T.\" Since that day, \"E.T.\" director Steven Speilberg and Barrymore practically became like father and daughter. Here the two of them, together with the filmmaker's wife at the time, Amy Irving spend a day shopping at Tower Records in 1985.\n\nThe two have often been photographed together on many family outings. The legendary filmmaker did in fact become her Godfather in later years when she was a teenager. They two of them have since supported one another on various projects throughout the years.\n\nThe Day Sean Penn and Madonna Wed\n\nMuch to their friends' dismay, the two eccentric and wild personalities, Madonna and Sean Penn shacked up, needless to say, it didn't last that long. It was August 16, 1985, when the two walked down the aisle. The relatively modest wedding took place in Point Dume, Malibu. About a half-dozen helicopters were filled with paparazzi who captured the memorable event.\n\nThe marriage was a wild ride from the start. The stars decided to marry within 3 months of knowing each other. They ultimately lasted five years which is actually a little longer than many predicted. Penn met Robin Wright soon after but has claimed even to this day that he still has love for the pop star.\n\nSidney Poitier Wins an Oscar\n\nOn April 13, 1964, history was made at the 36th Academy Awards in Santa Monica, California. Sidney Poitier won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in \"Lilies of the Field.\" This was a monumental moment for the African American community as it was the first time an African American man won the Academy Award for a lead performance. Poitier's win ushered in a drastic change in Hollywood.\n\nPrior to that win, the actor had been nominated for an Oscar for his role in \"The Defiant Ones\" in 1958. That too was a historical moment as it was the first time an African American male lead was nominated. Needless to say, his subsequent win in 1964 totally blew that out of the water. In the early days of 2022, Sidney Poitier sadly passed away leaving behind a legendary memory.\n\nMadonna's 'Material Girl' is Released\n\nJust a year before the Queen of Pop, Madonna wed her reclusive Hollywood hunk, Penn, she broke the charts with her hit \"Material Girl.\" The song was an anthem for girls around the world and still might be to this very day. Fans were blown away by the music video which had Madonna her iconic pink dress, iced with diamond jewelry.\n\nThe video was done as an homage to Marylin Monroe's, hit song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friends\". The video incorporated the same designs and colors as the original but, of course with a more modern spin.\n\nHumphrey Bogart Dies\n\nHumphrey Bogart was known for many iconic roles throughout the 30s and 40s, such as \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca.\" As one of the most beloved and respected leading men of his time, one might even call him the Leonardo DiCaprio of his generation. This made the day he died all the more painful.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by some of Hollywood's biggest stars, including Hepburn, Tracy, Judy Garland, David Niven, Ronald Reagan, James Mason, Bette Davis, Danny Kaye, Joan Fontaine, Marlene Dietrich, James Cagney, Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, Gary Cooper, Billy Wilder and studio head Jack L. Warner.\n\nElvis Presley Enlists\n\nThe King of Rock and Roll was at the peak of his career when he decided to drop everything and enlist in the U.S. military. Between 1958 and 1960, Presley joined his fellow Americans on the ground and even turned down a position in the special forces as an entertainer for the troops.\n\nIn this picture, Presley is pictured on a German military base between 1958 and 1960. Those were two pivotal years for the singer. Not only did military life affect him directly, but he also hugely impacted his career. Suddenly the older generations gained a lot more respect for him, securing a very prosperous but different career after his release. During this time he also, unfortunately, got hooked on stimulants and barbiturates. This eventually led to his overdose.\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis Spotted at a Broadway Play\n\nYet another tumultuous Hollywood marriage- Demi Moore and Bruce Willis. The couple met in 1987 at a screening of the movie \"Stakeout\" - a film that starred Emilio Estevez (her fiance at the time). The two hit it off instantly and just four months later tied the knot - Vegas-style. The couple ended up having three kids together; Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah.\n\nBy 1998, the couple had separated and by 2000 they had officially filed for divorce. While they may not be together anymore, these two have demonstrated some very fine co-parenting skills. This is no easy feat, especially in Hollywood.\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise at the 1991 Academy Awards\n\nHollywood's golden couple of the 90s restored many fans' belief in forever-lasting love in Tinsletown. At least for a while of course. The two met in 1990 on the set of \"Days of Thunder,\" a film in which they both starred. It was love at first sight and by the end of the year on December 24, the love birds were married.\n\nThe couple adopted two children, Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995) but sadly, by 2000, after a decade together, the two began the process of divorce. Since that heartbreaking end, the two have found love again. Kidman with Keith Urban and Cruise with Katie Holmes. Unfortunately for the \"Jerry Maguire\" actor, that too eventually ended in divorce.\n\nEasy Rider at Cannes\n\nThe year 1969 was a year full of change that was sweeping America and even the rest of the world. It was the time of hippies, Woodstock, tie-dye shirts, and long and wild hair. It was also the year that the iconic cult film \"Easy Rider\" transported America. The film tells the tale of two bikers on a road trip, pursuing the American dream, while at the same time getting caught up in a whirlwind of substances, promiscuity, and violence.\n\nThe film received such high praise that the creators Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Terry Southern got their spot at the Cannes Film Festival, the most prestigious film festival in cinema that takes place. The crew of hippie filmmakers arrived in traditional attire from the American Civil War. Needless to say, the bunch definitely shook things up at the fancy black-tie affair.\n\nBob Dylan On His Way To Meet the Beatles\n\nIn 1964, on August 28, two of the most powerful forces in rock history united over a drink. \"The Fab Four\" met Dylan for the first time at the Hotel Delmonico in New York. Many people from that generation regarded that meeting as the moment that defined rock history. The Beatles were at the peak of their pop-crazy \"Beatlemania\" and Dylan brought in a more serious sound of the counter-culture.\n\nThe meeting was so special to the Beatles that Paul McCartney instructed his roadie to write down everything that took place. Dylan, the king of cool found himself feeling a little starstruck.\n\nWhen James Brown Performed Live at the Apollo\n\nThis historic 1962 performance was entirely self-financed by James Brown himself and has been hailed as a masterclass in musical performance and showmanship. Brown didn't get the nickname \"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\" for nothing. The show was so successful that you can hear the frenzy on the recorded album.\n\nWhile that was a memorable show, James Brown's next nine singles didn't quite go down as well as before. Still, his hit song (the one that got him a record deal) \"Please, Please, Please\" will forever live on as one of the greatest rock and roll tracks in history.\n\nDiane Keaton and Al Pacino\n\nDiane Keaton has had her fair share of interesting romances. Back in the day, the actress dated stars like Woody Allen, Jack Nicholson Warren Beaty, and probably most hyped about, the legendary Godfather actor, Al Pacino. Keaton met Pacino on the set of \"The Godfather Part III.\" The two began dating shortly after. Keaton admitted that she instantly developed a massive crush on her co-star, saying that he had\"the most beautiful face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face.\"\n\nWhile at the time Keaton initially wanted to marry Pacino, after it ended, the actress chose to stay away from marriage. In July 2001, Keaton commented on her decisions by saying \"I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my life any less.\" At 50 adopted two kids. On her newfound Motherhood, she said: \"It's just about the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had.\"\n\nHattie McDaniel\n\nTwenty years before Sidney Poitier received his Oscar, Hattie McDaniel made her mark on at The Twelfth Academy Awards. The actress changed the course of history when she officially became the first African American to ever receive an Oscar. McDaniel starred as the 'Mammy' in the 1939 classic, \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\nAfter the big night, the hotel in which McDaniel stayed in had a strict no-blacks policy but made an exception that one time. Crazy times! That film went on to win another seven Academy Awards.\n\nJimi Hendrix Plays 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at the Woodstock Festival\n\nOn Aug. 18, 1969, the legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix incorporated some good old patriotism on that Woodstock stage- a platform many would argue didn't' quite represent traditional American ideals. When the musician finished off his bit, he concluded it with the Star-Spangled Banner melody. His performance ended up being two hours long, the longest of his career.\n\nInterestingly enough, this was not the first time Hendrix played the anthem. There are in fact almost 50 live recordings of Hendrix performing the national anthem, 28 of them before Woodstock\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder\n\nThe indie couple of the early 90s, Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder were the black sheep of Hollywood. Both dark-haired beauties that took on some quirky films, their love seemed like a match made in heaven. The two met in 1989 at the premiere of Ryder's film \"Great Balls of Fire!\" - the classic biopic of the late Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nBy the time they co-starred in \"Edward Scissorhands\" in 1990, the world was enamored by them. Constantly overwhelmed by the press, the public pressures weighed on their relationship. Eventually, they gave in and by 1993 decided to end it.\n\nHanging with the Pearl\n\nJanis Joplin found out about Woodstock just a couple of days prior. Thankfully, \"The Pearl\" did not have another commitment, and she and her band said yes to the performance. When she told her band they had a gig, she did not know how big of a deal it was. It was not until they arrived and saw the number of people in the crowd that they realized how big it was.\n\nJanis Joplin performed on day two of Woodstock. She was also one of the biggest stars to perform. Despite her star status, Janis and her band did not leave after their iconic performance. They stayed at the festival until the end, to experience it all.\n\nSarah Silverman's Headshot\n\nThe differences between back then and nowadays headshots are significant. Just by looking at the famous one of Sarah Silverman, it's clear that a lot of progress has been made in photography and in Hollywood.\n\nIt was never easy for young actors to get cast during auditions, so they had to go through the hard way like all the others. They regularly heard the word NO much more than they did the word YES. This image is a headshot of Sarah Silverman, who said that she remembered the day this was taken very clearly. The photographer gave her his blazer so she looked more mature.\n\nSammy Davis Jr. and Clint Eastwood\n\nSammy Davis Jr. was one of the first African American performers in Las Vegas to get equal treatment. Before that, these establishments wouldn't even host their talent and would give them boarding facilities outside the hotel. Davis Jr. was able to break color divides largely because of his friendship with Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack.\n\nIt wasn’t just a social benefit but an entry point into a world that had eluded so many Black artists. Getting in was half the battle won. His audience was entirely white. The clubs he performed at still served people of color away from the main bar. Here he is pictured with Clint Eastwood in 1959 at the Sands Hotel.\n\nDolly Parton at an NYC Club\n\nWhile Bianca Jagger made the white horse famous, Dolly Parton was the reason the animal came to Studio 54 in the first place. Desperate to make the Queen of Country comfortable, owner Steve Rubell brought in the magnificent white beast. While Dolly loved her stunning white steed, plenty of other animals also roamed the disco.\n\nChickens and mules wandered through the exclusive club, joining the celebrities on the dance floor or finding a bit of solace in the decorative wagon filled with hay. It may have been an NYC nightclub, but Studio 54 boasted a strong touch of country.\n\nFarah Fawcett Dances at Her Shampoo Party\n\nAmerican actress Farah Fawcett rose to fame after her iconic role in the 1976 TV show \"Charlie's Angels.\" She played the blonde bombshell, and it earned her four Emmy Awards nominations and six Golden Globe nominations. Fawcett also loved to party, as you can see in the photo below, where she's happily dancing.\n\nFawcett was attending a party at Studio 54 in New York in 1978. The party was to promote the actress's new line of Hair products, namely the Faberge Farrah Fawcett Shampoo. Many will forget that Fawcett passed away on the exact same day as the one and only Michael Jackson.\n\nJohn Wayne Gets Drinks at a Costume Party\n\nAt 64, American Western hero John Wayne still enjoyed a good party. In the photo below, we see Wayne getting some drinks at a charity costume party in Los Angeles in 1971. The man was still making movies, the most recent being 'Big Jake,' released in that same year.\n\nWe don't know if Wayne was in costume or not since the Western style became an essential part of his character. Whatever it was, he looked dapper and ready to have a wild night. Of course, Wayne entered many a saloon during his time starring in some of Hollywood's most epic Western flicks.\n\nSting, Madonna, Tupac, and Ingrid Casares\n\nWe bet that you know at least one or two on sight, and you might even be able to get three of them. From left to right is Tupac Shakur – probably the easiest to identify – followed by Sting, Madonna, and Ingrid Casares. Three musicians and an actress/businesswoman at the same table? It has to be a music event, right? Wrong, somehow.\n\nThis was taken at a dinner party for Gianni Versace in 1994, and all four of these people were living large in the limelight. We're a little surprised that Sting went with nothing but a wifebeater, but you do you, buddy.\n\nEwan McGregor\n\nEwan McGregor's most famous role – that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \"Star Wars\" prequels – wouldn't start for a few years after this picture was taken. He is seen here in 1997, taking his first steps up the ladder of success just as \"Brassed Off\" was released. From there, the possibilities were endless.\n\nMcGregor has grasped numerous awards for several roles he played and has been praised for his charity. In the 1990s, he rose to fame with the release of the movie \"Shallow Grave,\" however, he is most famously known and appreciated for his astonishing role in one of the most successful yet controversial movies of that time, \"Trainspotting.\"\n\nThe Osbournes Being Awkward Teens\n\nYou wouldn’t guess they were the children of “The Prince of Darkness” himself just by looking at them since Jack and Kelly Osbourne look like your typical bored and awkward teenagers in this photo. They have come a long way since being one of the pioneers of reality TV. They were doing it long before the Kardashians, that's for sure.\n\nOzzy’s kids attended the \"MTV Spring Break\" edition in 2002, which was the same year the famous reality TV show \"The Osbournes\" was released. Nothing like watching a heavy metal rockstar interact with his wife and kids. The question is: Did Ozzy and Sharon fly down to Mexico too to show some support?\n\nHelen Mirren in Troilus and Cressida\n\nFew actors and actresses are able to achieve what Shakespearean actress and A-list movie star, Helen Mirren has achieved: the “Triple Crown of Acting: Academy Award, Emmy Award, and Tony Award.” Mirren first began her formal acting career after joining the Royal Shakespeare Company in the late 1960s.\n\nMirren would also go on to win an Oliver Award for Best Actress, for her performance in the drama, “The Audience” in 2013, a role in which she again acted as Queen Elizabeth II. In 2003, Mirren was formally recognized for her years of dedication and talent in the world of the Performing Arts after being appointed as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for Services to the Performing Arts.\n\nGeorge Harrison and Pattie Boyd\n\nIt seems like all of the Beatles ended up having special honeymoons in various parts of the world.
