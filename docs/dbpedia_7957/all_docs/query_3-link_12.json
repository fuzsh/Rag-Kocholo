        "text": "Warren Beatty, an American director, actor, and producer, has had a significant impact on Hollywood cinema. Born in 1937, he first gained fame as an actor but later established himself as a director. Beatty’s directorial debut was the critically acclaimed Reds, a historical drama about journalist John Reed, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Director. Known for his meticulous approach to filmmaking, Beatty has been selective in his directorial projects, which also include Heaven Can Wait, Dick Tracy, Bulworth, and Rules Don’t Apply.
