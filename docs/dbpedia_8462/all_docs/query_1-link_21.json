        "text": "On Tuesday 10th, in the Sala BBK, the goalkeeper of the Cameroon national team in the 1990 World Cup in Italy will participate in the cineforum of the film ‘Green Lions’\n\nThomas N’Kono, goalkeeper of the legendary Cameroon national team that dazzled at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, is one of the special guests at Thinking Football 2023. The former goalkeeper of Cameroon and RCD Espanyol will participate in the cineforum of the film ‘Green Lions’, produced by DAZN, which will be screened next Tuesday, October 10, at 20:00 in the Sala BBK. N’Kono is an old acquaintance of the Athleticzale family, as in Espanyol he shared the dressing room with illustrious red and white players such as Javier Clemente, Ernesto Valverde, Santiago Urkiaga or Carlos Meléndez, and even had Gorka Iraizoz as a disciple. As always at Thinking Football, admission is free, but it is necessary to book online HERE\n\nThe Cameroon national team arrived at the 1990 World Cup in Italy with the role of ideal victim. However, they defeated in the opening match the world champions, none other than Diego Maradona’s Argentina in what was probably the biggest surprise in the history of the World Cup so far. That was just the first step in an adventure that was forever etched in the minds of fans around the world. Led by the Soviet Valery Nepomnyashchiy, players such as Thomas N’kono, brothers Omam-Biyick and Kana-Biyick, Stephen Tataw, Thomas Libih and veteran Roger Milla earned the respect and admiration of the soccer world in one of the most beautiful feats in the history of the World Cup. Green Lions’ is a documentary produced by DAZN that tells the true story of that unrepeatable team."
