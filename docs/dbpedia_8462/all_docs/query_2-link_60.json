        "text": "Once upon a time there was a 17 year old kid named Gianluigi Buffon. One fine day in November 1995, he was about to make his Serie A debut against Fabio Capello’s all conquering AC Milan. Others in his place would have probably been nervous, perhaps unable to eat or sleep properly the night before. But not Gigi. Buffon was actually so relaxed that he took a nap on the coach ride to the stadium, just hours before kick off. Senior players were concerned. That kid was too relaxed!\n\nFast forward to October 1997, in the freezing cold in Russia. Buffon, aged only 19, was thrust off the bench to deputize for the injured Gianluca Pagliuca in a decisive World Cup play off. Again, some would be forgiven for showing nerves on such an occassion. But not Buffon. As he trodded towards Italy’s goal to take his place between the posts, Alessandro Costacurta told him ‘be cool, kid’. ‘You be cool’ was Buffon’s reply. He was unnerved. He was special.\n\nThat’s not to say Buffon wasn’t passionate. On the contrary, he was — and still is — the epitome of passion. A quick glance at him singing his heart out during Italy’s Inno di Mameli, or as he celebrated saves as if they were goals with Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, and Andrea Barzagli, or at his back as he turned it towards his Parma teammate Franco Vázquez when his nerves couldn’t handle a penalty kick even aged 45, is all one needs to see to realize how much Buffon was enamored by football. He gave it every bit of his soul.\n\nIt may be hard to imagine, since he has become the embodiment of the goalkeeper position, but Buffon actually started out as a midfielder. He even played at San Siro right behind future Azzurri teammate Cristiano Zanetti. But that was 1989, in a match for 11 year olds played before a Serie A fixture between Inter and Verona. The switch to goalkeeper was inspired by watching Cameroon’s Thomas N’kono in Italia 90. Buffon was captivated by his showmanship and fearlessness, and shed tears when England eventually knocked out Cameroon. Louis Thomas, Buffon’s first born, was aptly named as an ode to the Cameroonian.\n\nBuffon’s CV might be filled with scudetti, cups, and a glorious World Cup, but it wasn’t without pain. Three Champions League final defeats, Euro 2012 final defeat, missing out on Euro 2000 through injury, and World Cup 2018 through failure to qualify.\n\nEven group stage exits in Euro 2004, World Cup 2010 while suffering a back injury, and World Cup 2014 straight after announcing his divorce. To bounce back from all that, enjoy a 28 year career at the top, and be widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, he has to be called Superman.\n\nDays before he saved a penalty from Ronaldo Nazario — Il Fenomeno in 1997, Buffon was given a Superman T-shirt by Parma fans, which he happened to wear underneath his kit on the day. At full time, he took off his Parma shirt to celebrate and the real Superman was born. Two years later, Buffon wore that same T-shirt to celebrate their Uefa Cup win. Always one of the fans.\n\nThat Parma side was the greatest in the club’s history. Funded by Parmalat’s owner Calisto Tanzi, it included not only Buffon, but the likes of Fabio Cannavaro, Lillian Thuram, Dino Baggio, Juan Verón, and Hernan Crespo. Their peak in 1999 culminated in a Coppa Italia, Uefa Cup, and Supercoppa Italiana triumphs and Buffon starred in all of them.\n\nBut in 2001, Juventus made him the most expensive goalkeeper in history at the time, and their most expensive signing up until they landed Gonzalo Higuaín 15 years later. Straight off two near misses for their beloved scudetto, Juve underwent a revolution. Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi, and Edwin Van der Sar were sold and Buffon was joined by Thuram, Pavel Nedvěd, and Marcelo Salas. Marcello Lippi was the cherry on top; re-hired to bring back the good times.\n\nAnd the good times indeed returned, even if they were later interrupted. A vital part of a strong and winning Juventus under Lippi and Capello, Buffon remained in Turin along with Alessandro Del Piero, David Trezeguet, Nedvěd, and Mauro Camoranesi when many chose to depart after Calciopoli. The years that followed were tough, but in 2011 Antonio Conte arrived to lift Juventus again and usher in a new era of dominance in Italy. More scudetti followed with Massimiliano Allegri and then a final one with Maurizio Sarri. In total, he won 12 or 10 scudetti (depending on who you support).\n\nBut his greatest triumph of all has to be the World Cup. The crowning moment in the careers of a generation of truly legendary Italian players and coach. Buffon was simply unbreakable during that tournament, as was the Italian defense; conceding only twice all tournament — an own goal from a corner kick against USA and a Panenka penalty in the final. Buffon went to the World Cup as the world’s best goalkeeper, and came back as absolutely one of the very best — if not the best — in the history of the game.\n\nTo get this far without a mention of his qualities as a goalkeeper is another testament to his greatness. But it would be a shame not to mention them, as he was simply extraordinary. His technique was top notch, his reflexes were otherworldly, but perhaps most importantly of all, he never switched off. A Buffon blunder would be a very tough find. And that, more than anything, was the secret to his greatness. Add to it the consistency to stay at the top level for nearly 30 years, and win all that he won, and what you get is — to many — the undisputed greatest of all time.\n\nHe’s perhaps remembered for two saves above all. The first, against Milan’s Inzaghi in the Champions League final 2003. And the second, against France’s Zidane, in the World Cup final 2006. Perhaps a mere coincidence that both were headers, but it was no coincedence that they arrived in the two biggest matches of his career. A man for the biggest occasions, Buffon.\n\nYou could tell the story of modern football through Buffon’s career. From his debut in 1995, where he played against the likes of Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Costacurta, Demetrio Albertini, Marcel Desailly, Zvonimir Boban, George Weah and Roberto Baggio. Until Paris Saint-Germain where he played with Kylian Mbappé and Neymar Junior. Think of any great player or coach in the last 30 years, and Buffon has either played with them or against them. In many cases he did both.\n\nIn 1999, when his successor as Italy’s number one Gianluigi Donnarumma was born, Buffon was winning the Uefa Cup with Parma and Italy’s undisputed first choice. He was still Italy’s number one when Donnarumma made his Nazionale debut in 2016. Superman transcended many eras.\n\nHe played with some players and their sons. A Coppa Italia trophy was celebrated with Enrico Chiesa at Parma and then 22 years later with his son Federico at Juventus. He faced Weah in his famous debut and then later became teammates with his son, Timothy, at Paris Saint-Germain. These anecdotes should be unfathomable to any normal man, but Buffon was Superman.\n\nHe always acted like a kid magically taken out of a curva and put on a football pitch, which wouldn’t be far from the truth. After all, he played his entire career with the initials C.U.I.T. on his gloves, as a nod to the ultras group of his beloved local club Carrarese. At one point, he was even the majority shareholder of the club.\n\nJovial, full of character and charisma, yet incredibly focused and calm. That balance was so hard to attain. It was perhaps his greatest gift of all.\n\nBut he wasn’t always balanced. At times, he strayed sideways. At 14, he started smoking with his friends from the Carrarese ultras in an attempt to enjoy his youth amidst his many sacrifices, not least leaving his family a year earlier to live at a boarding school in Parma. In September 1999, after a stretch of poor form for Parma’s side, he unwittingly wrote the phrase ‘Boia chi molla’ (death to cowards) on his match worn shirt for TV interviews. Intended as an act of bravery, Buffon later learned that the phrase he had read on a table in his boarding school as a kid was actually a slogan from Mussolini’s fascist regime. He quickly apologized for his ignorance to that fact, but it wouldn’t be his last controversy.\n\nIn a warm up friendly just before Euro 2000, his first tournament as Gli Azzurri’s number one, he fractured his hand and was forced to miss the tournament. Francesco Toldo heroically replaced him and had the tournament of his life, as Italy reached the final and were seconds away from winning the trophy. Buffon knew his place as Italy’s starting goalkeeper was under threat, and hence set himself a reminder of the big challenge that laid ahead. That came in the slightly unorthodox idea of wearing the number 88 on the back of his kit, which — to him — represented ‘four balls’. Balls of course as in cojones or determination and fearlessness. The only problem was that it was — again — a number that carried a neo-Nazi correlation. Once more, he quickly apologized and opted to wear the number 77 instead.\n\nHis biggest regret in life was trying to falsify a high school diploma to apply for a law degree. To his credit, he showed remorse as he always did and paid the required fine after apologizing. A bout of depression arrived in 2003, when he felt unfulfilled by money and fame, and started looking for something deeper in life. He found serenity through a psychologist, his family’s support, and regular visits to a Turin art museum on his way to training in the morning. The simpler things in life.\n\nAnother hit followed in 2006, just before the World Cup, when he was investigated for placing bets on football matches and risked missing out on the tournament all together. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn spite of all those regrettable lows — depression aside — Buffon has constantly bounced back to remain beloved and even admired. There was always something very personable about him. Thoughtful, charismatic, and fearless — Buffon was a captain before wearing the armband, and by the time he got to wear it for Italy and Juventus, he had become way more than that. Even more than Superman. Buffon had become a role model.\n\nTo get through all of his career’s setbacks, and there were many, he needed one thing: a big heart. And Buffon showed heart in everything he did. But along with heart, loyalty was always the theme of his career. He finished his career back where it all began — Parma. Fighting till the last moment to get them out of Serie B, but it wasn’t to be. It wasn’t his first time at Italy’s second tier of course, as he had chosen to go down with his old lady or La Vecchia Signora, Juventus, when Calciopoli broke out.\n\nAs he bids farewell to his playing career, to try to sum up Buffon would be an injustice. More than a goalkeeper, more than a superhero, even more than a role model. His legacy cannot be put in words. It’s in the memories he left, the emotions he evoked, and all those victories he conquered. But perhaps his most meaningful victory of all was in embodying a simple message — it’s not our failures that define us, it’s the perseverance to push through. Buffon is celebrated not because he was flawless, but because he was superb despite his flaws."
