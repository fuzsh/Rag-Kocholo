        "text": "Although N’Kono recognises that he was well equipped by nature for a career in goal (an imposing physique, tremendous composure and magnificent handling skills), he says that his exceptional performances were mainly due to the work he put in: “I was lucky enough to play with the best strikers at Canon (Manga Onguene, Abega, Mbida, Emana, Nguea). I learned a lot from them in training because I came up through the reserve team, which enabled me to improve a lot.” His move to Canon Yaounde had taken place in a rather roundabout fashion, however. Canon’s chairman Koungou Edima had actually wanted to sign Cameroon international Aka from Leopard Douala, but the player had upped the stakes and demanded a motorbike, among other things, as part of the deal. It was at that point that vice-chairman Obouh Mfegue, backed by some of the players including Jean Manga Onguene, suggested that the club went for Eclair’s young keeper N’Kono. And the rest is history!\n\nTommy’s extraordinary talent did not fail to impress. In Kinshasa, a fan stole his gloves, thinking that he would find lucky charms in them, and N’Kono had to finish the match bare-handed, not that this prevented Canon from winning. In Benin City in Nigeria, he was searched with police dogs. In Valencia in Spain, he was unperturbed by the barrage of oranges and tomatoes that rained down from the stands. Some people even wondered if he had lucky charms hidden in the tracksuit bottoms he used to wear during matches, a look he helped to pioneer. It was a European journalist who put this to him during Cameroon’s preparations for the 1982 FIFA World Cup™ in Spain, to which he responded sardonically, “I wear these trousers, which were made here in Europe, to avoid injuries on our pitches in Africa, which do not always have the best surfaces. Why don’t you try them on to see if they turn you into a good goalkeeper?”\n\nBarring a three-year spell in Bolivia at the end of his playing career where he nurtured the idea of becoming an adviser to young players interested in turning professional, he has lived in Barcelona with his wife and three daughters for the past 25 years. He only joins up with Cameroon when the squad gets together, as he is still a member of the Espanyol technical staff, where he coaches the young goalkeepers in the reserves and their colleagues in the first team.\n\nNow 52, he still enjoys the occasional game with fellow veterans, albeit not in goal, but as a centre forward, the position he played in at the beginning of his career, because, despite being averse to conceding goals during his playing career, this imposing ex-goalkeeper has always enjoyed scoring them.\n\nHowever, the man the Cameroon press dubbed “Mr 50%” when he played for the country’s most successful club, Canon Yaounde, actually started out as a centre forward. That was back in the 1960s when he was at Cameroonian first-division club Eclair Douala. As he says himself, it was purely by chance that he ended up playing in goal. “One day before training, the boy who was in charge of the balls told me to go in goal while we waited for the other players to arrive. The coach, who was watching, noticed that I handled the ball well. The following weekend he played me in goal and we won.” Ironically, the goalkeeper whose place N’Kono took in the team, Simon Tchombang, eventually made his name at Dynamo Douala and went on to become one of N’Kono’s deputies (together with Joseph Antoine Bell) at the 1982 FIFA World Cup™ in Spain.\n\nHaving thus vacated his position as centre-forward to help out in goal, Tommy remained between the sticks and was a top-class goalkeeper for 25 years, earning himself a new nickname, “The Black Spider”, a reference to the original “Black Spider”, Lev Yashin, so-called because he liked to wear a black cap and jersey. The coach and chairman of Eclair Douala, Francois Bahoumbekin, discovered N’Kono, then a 17-year-old striker, at an inter-district tournament in Edea, 100km from Cameroon’s biggest city Douala. The masterstroke of converting him into a goalkeeper gifted the land of the Indomitable Lions a custodian who was as complete a player in the air as he was on the ground, a great shot-stopper who was famed for his jumping, his footwork and his long throwing. He often succeeded in sapping the confidence of opposing strikers in Cameroon and all over Africa during his glory days at Canon Yaounde, as well as reassuring his own defenders with saves that were out of this world. His former team-mate and playmaker at Canon and in the national team, Jean-Paul Akono, nowadays also a coach (whose achievements include a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Sydney) backs this up: “With Tommy, we played with great confidence. The defenders could afford to go upfield and dribble the ball because they knew that if they made a mistake, “The Black Spider” would save their bacon.”\n\nWith his reputation already made in Africa, Thomas N’Kono dazzled the rest of the world with his performances for the Indomitable Lions at the 1982 FIFA World Cup™ in Spain, conceding just one goal (to Italy’s Graziani in a 1-1 draw and only after slipping over). However, this was not enough to prevent a frustrating first-round elimination for unbeaten Cameroon on their World Cup debut. At Italia ’90, N’Kono conceded many more goals (nine in five matches), but Cameroon went a lot further in the competition, becoming the first African country to reach the World Cup quarter¬finals."
