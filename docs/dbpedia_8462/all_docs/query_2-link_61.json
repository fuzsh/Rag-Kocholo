        "text": "Buffon was precocious. He felt ready for the highest level even in his midteens. Upon hearing that his mentor, Ermes Fulgoni, the legendary goalkeeping coach of Parma's academy, had been going around telling anyone who would listen that \"this kid will be starting in Serie A by the age of 20,\" Buffon turned to him and said: \"What will I do until then?\" He followed his team Carrarese as an ultra. He rode his Vespa along the streets of Parma without a helmet. His timekeeping left a lot to be desired. He was often late for his lift into training.\n\nOn the one hand, Buffon's laid-back attitude could be explained by the exuberance of youth. On the other, it could be put down to the self-awareness that his was an immense talent. His chance arrived when Luca Bucci got hurt playing in the Cup Winners' Cup. His backup, Giovanni Galli, had left in frustration at not being given the game time he had been promised in the cup competitions and Alessandro Nista (now Inter's goalkeeping coach) was only just returning from serious injury.\n\n\"I knew I would be playing against Milan,\" Buffon revealed in his autobiography. \"Or at least I hoped so. A part of me still couldn't quite believe it. But that week I did some extraordinary things in training ... So that Sunday morning Scala called me and told me I'd be playing.\"\n\nAnd how did Buffon react upon hanging up the phone? He was completely relaxed. \"My teammates were a little worried. It didn't reassure them at all when I dropped off to sleep on the bus. But that's just how I was.\" Cool, calm, collected. It's what you want from a goalkeeper, right?\n\nHis debut was so spectacular, the whole world soon knew him as Superman. In a top-of-the-table clash Buffon kept a clean sheet. But not just any clean sheet. He denied Stefano Eranio and Roberto Baggio in the first half, Marco Simone and George Weah in the second. He wore No. 12 that day, but as his teammate Fabio Cannavaro once said: \"Gigi has No. 1 stamped on his skin.\" He has a legitimate claim to be considered the greatest of all time.\n\n\"He played like a veteran,\" the commentator on La Domenica Sportiva said in his report that afternoon. The same has been said of Donnarumma.\n\nLast month, Milan coach Sinisa Mihajlovic took a gamble. Diego Lopez had dropped a few clangers. Christian Abbiati has had his day. So he promoted Donnarumma. The risk for Mihajlovic here was twofold: On the one hand he might unsettle Lopez; on the other he might burn Donnarumma. Make no mistake, this was a baptism of fire.\n\nMilan were 14th and without a win in three games. They were playing their bogey team Sassuolo and facing their bogey man Domenico Berardi. He had scored seven goals in four games against them. A Berardi poker had got Max Allegri the sack. A hat trick had left the writing on the wall for Pippo Inzaghi. Now here was an opportunity to give Silvio Berlusconi a decision to make about Sinisa Mihajlovic. Banners of dissent were strewn across the Curva Sud at San Siro, expressing disappointment with the coach and criticism of chief executive Adriano Galliani.\n\nStill a schoolboy, Donnarumma's legs could be forgiven for trembling, but \"everything just slides off me,\" he revealed at a training camp for Italy's under-21s last week. \"Staying calm is my strength even in the most difficult moments of a game. A goalkeeper has to transmit a sense of security to the team. You can't allow yourself to be uncertain. Mentally I'm older than my years. I realised that on my debut. I should have been agitated. But no.\"\n\nBerardi got the better of him with a free kick, but Milan returned to winning ways and so it didn't really matter. Still, the papers were fairly unforgiving. Donnarumma got 5s in some player ratings and 5.5s in others. \"What were you doing when you were 16?\" Mihajlovic hit back. For him, Donnarumma was exempt from blame. Juraj Kucka shouldn't have given away the free kick in the first place and there were too many men in the wall.\n\nMihajlovic continued to put faith in his young goalkeeper and was rewarded three days later, as Donnarumma helped Milan keep their first clean sheet of the season against Chievo. He didn't have much to do and was a little fortunate when a Chievo goal was disallowed in stoppage time for a soft foul on him, but flashes of talent were there. A Neuer-like turn to evade Miroslav Klose then caught the eye against Lazio at the Olimpico. He could have done better to stop Ricardo Kishna's consolation goal, but a Man of the Match performance against Atalanta when he made four big saves and was the difference between drawing and losing left Mihajlovic vindicated. It also left the papers in little doubt about his potential.\n\nAt 6-foot-5, he is a man-child. It's frightening to think Donnarumma hasn't stopped growing yet either. The hype around him hasn't slowed either, which is to be expected when you see his entourage. Donnarumma's agent is Mino Raiola, who knows talent when he sees it (he also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba and Mario Balotelli), but Donnarumma has let his talent, not Raiola, speak for him.\n\nAfter he impressed in preseason when he was the hero of a shootout against Real Madrid, thwarting Toni Kroos from the spot, it was thought that the competition for Lopez's place was heating up. Milan's No. 99 (the year of Donnarumma's birth) is now their No. 1, but don't get carried away. Not so long ago Udinese's Simone Scuffet was hailed as the next Buffon. He too made his Serie A debut at a younger age than Buffon. Atleti even wanted him to replace Thibaut Courtois. But he is now on loan at Como. It's a cautionary tale.\n\nIn retrospect, Saturday night's game might come to be seen as the passing of the torch. Then again, it might not. Donnarumma says, \"My dream is to take [Buffon's] place and wear the No. 1 shirt for Italy.\" Patience is needed. But Berlusconi can't help himself. \"My successors won't have to spend any money on that position. Donnarumma will be our goalkeeper for the next 20 years.\"\n\nNor can Galliani. \"I was there when Buffon made his debut all those years ago,\" he said, \"and Donnarumma reminds me of him.\""
