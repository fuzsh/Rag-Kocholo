        "text": "The Italian former soccer player Gianluigi Buffon has three kids with two different women.\n\nHe entered a relationship with Czech model Alena Å eredovÃ¡ in 2005, and their love blossomed over the years.\n\nThey tied the knot in June 2011 and were blessed with two children, Louis Thomas, born in 2007 and named after Buffonâs idol Thomas NâKono, and David Lee, born in 2009 and named after Van Halenâs singer David Lee Roth.\n\nIn May 2014, Buffon announced that he and Alena had decided to separate after three years of marriage.\n\nFollowing the separation, Buffon found companionship in the company of Italian sports pundit, journalist, and television host, Ilaria DâAmico.\n\nThe two became romantically involved, and in 2015, they shared the joyous news of expecting a child together.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, Buffon and Ilaria announced the birth of their son, Leopoldo Mattia. Their bond grew stronger over time, leading to their engagement in the summer of 2017.\n\nBefore his relationship and marriage to Å eredovÃ¡, Buffon had been previously engaged to Vincenza CalÃ¬, a sprinter from the Italy national athletics team.\n\nThroughout his personal life and illustrious soccer career, Buffon has captured the hearts of many with his exceptional goalkeeping skills and charismatic presence.\n\nGianluigi Buffon Parents\n\nGianluigi Buffon was born on January 28, 1978, into a family of accomplished Italian athletes.\n\nHis mother, Maria Stella, had a successful career as a discus thrower, while his father, Adriano, excelled as a weightlifter.\n\nAfter retiring from their athletic pursuits, they both pursued careers as physical education school teachers.\n\nAthleticism seemed to run in the family as Buffonâs two sisters, Veronica and Guendalina, represented the Italian national volleyball team, showcasing their talent on the international stage.\n\nAdditionally, Buffonâs uncle, Dante Masocco, made his mark as a skilled basketball player in Serie A1 and was also part of the national team.\n\nInterestingly, Gianluigi Buffonâs grandfather is related to former Milan, Inter, and Italy goalkeeper Lorenzo Buffon, making soccer a significant part of their family history.\n\nBuffon himself holds firm to his Catholic faith, which has been a guiding force throughout his life and career.\n\nRetirement Announcement\n\nAt the age of 45, Gianluigi Buffon is on the verge of bidding farewell to his illustrious soccer career.\n\nIt is expected that Buffon will officially retire and hang up his gloves in the coming week.\n\nHis agent is anticipated to hold discussions with Parma, the club to which Buffon made a return two years ago, with the aim of assisting them in regaining their Serie A status after relegation.\n\nThe final details of Buffonâs departure are likely to be worked out during these discussions. And also, this will lead to the termination of the final year of his three-year contract.\n\nncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCzyJqlpa2ZnLZurtSfnaimXaC2pb%2BMpaauoaNiwam7zJqqZpyRq7alecuenGaklaS9sLjDqGSmmaSptqJ7"
