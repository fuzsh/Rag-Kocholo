        "text": "Italian football might have looked very different over the last two decades if an impressionable 12-year-old had not been captivated by the Cameroon goalkeeper at the 1990 World Cup.\n\nGianluigi Buffon played as an attacker back then but the performances of Thomas N’Kono – playing in his third World Cup – inspired him to try life as a goalkeeper.\n\n“All the eyes of the world were on players like Diego Maradona and Gary Lineker, but I was mesmerised by Thomas N’Kono,” said Buffon.\n\n“It was the things he did for Cameroon during that World Cup that inspired me to become a goalkeeper myself.”\n\nThe Indomitable Lions defeated holders Argentina on their way to becoming the first African side to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup, where they were unluckily defeated 3-2 by England in Naples.\n\nWhen N’Kono retired he asked the Italian keeper to play in his farewell match – in Cameroon.\n\n“I first met him when he was 20 and he was with Parma,” N’Kono told the BBC’s World Service,\n\n“A year later I asked him to play in my farewell game in Cameroon. He said ‘yes, no problem’, but I never thought he would come.\n\n“Then, at the last minute, he called me to say he was at the airport about to come to Cameroon. It was amazing.”\n\nThe last time the two men met they discussed Buffon’s eldest son Louis Thomas, named, at least in part, after the Cameroon keeper.\n\nN’Kono asked how Buffon’s eldest was coming along. He told him the nine-year-old was doing well – but would play as an attacker, not a keeper.\n\nN’Kono, who spent the bulk of his career with Spanish side Espanyol, is now 60 but was in his 40s when he retired. Buffon is now 39 – and still at the top of his game.\n\nBy BBC"
