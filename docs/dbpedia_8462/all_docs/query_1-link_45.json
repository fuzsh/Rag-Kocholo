        "text": "Club career\n\nN'Kono was born in Dizangue. After playing in his country with Canon Yaoundé and Tonnerre Yaoundé he moved to Spain with RCD Español in 1982, after solid performances in the FIFA World Cup played in that country. He received the France Football African Footballer of the Year award in that year, and also in 1979.\n\nWith the Catalans N'Kono hardly ever missed a game, going on to amass more than 300 official appearances. In the 1988–89 season, however, he was not able to help prevent the club's La Liga relegation and, by the time it returned to the top division, he was already second-choice to younger Vicente Biurrun.\n\nN'Kono would play three more years in Spain, incidentally also in Catalonia, with CE Sabadell FC (second level) and CE L'Hospitalet. He retired already in his 40's with Club Bolívar from Bolivia, and subsequently returned to his main club as a goalkeeping coach, helping develop young talent and countryman Carlos Kameni.\n\nN'Kono placed second in IFFHS' \"African Goalkeeper of the Century\" Elections, behind Joseph-Antoine Bell.\n\nInternational career\n\nA Cameroonian international for almost two decades, N'Kono played in three World Cups: 1982, 1990 and 1994. In the first two he was the undisputed starter, as the nation went out in the group stage without losing a match and valliantly exited in the quarter-final against England, respectively; in the very last minute of the 1994 edition's preparations, the 39-year-old was called as backup to Bell, and did not play.\n\nN'Kono, who was the national side's goalkeepers coach, also worked briefly as interim manager after German Otto Pfister resigned in protest. The following month, as Paul Le Guen took the reins of the team, he was reset in his old post.\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2002, N'Kono was arrested by riot police for allegedly using \"black magic\", prior to the African Cup of Nations semi-final against Mali (3–0 win). He was dragged onto the running track after stepping onto the pitch at the 26 March Stadium, alongside coach Winfried Schäfer, and eventually received a one-year ban, which was then lifted, although he was not allowed to sit on the bench for the final. There was speculation that an object found in his pocket was a black-magic charm aimed at helping Cameroon's cause.\n\nStyle of play\n\nN'Kono was a tall, strong, dynamic and athletic goalkeeper, who was known in particular for his speed, agility, reactions and ability to produce spectacular and acrobatic saves. One of his most notable characteristics was his ability to come out and punch the ball with power when crosses were delivered into the area; his unique, instinctive and aggressive style inspired Gianluigi Buffon as a youngster.\n\nA commanding presence in goal, N'Kono also stood out for his composure, confidence and leadership throughout his career, and was nicknamed the black spider. In addition to his goalkeeping abilities, he was also known for wearing long trackpants instead of shorts.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBuffon declared he decided to play in the goalkeeping position after seeing N'Kono's performances at the 1990 World Cup. In addition, he named his first son Louis Thomas in the Cameroonian's honour.\n\nClub\n\nCanon Yaoundé\n\nElite One: 1974, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982\n\nCAF Champions League: 1978, 1980\n\nEspañol\n\nUEFA Cup: Runner-up 1987–88\n\nBolívar\n\nLiga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano: 1996, 1997\n\nCountry\n\nAfrica Cup of Nations: 1984; Runner-up 1986\n\nIndividual\n\nAfrican Player of the Year: 1979, 1982"
