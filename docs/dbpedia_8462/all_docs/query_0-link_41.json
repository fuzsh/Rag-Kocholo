        "text": "It can often seem an inauthentic gesture, the refusal to celebrate against opponents with whom you have a personal attachment. But when Breel Embolo looked bashfully down at the turf on scoring Switzerland’s winning goal, his motives appeared sincere. After all, he was born and raised in Cameroon, the land where his father still lives and whose World Cup ambitions he has all but derailed.\n\nEmbolo, born in Yaounde before moving with his mother to Switzerland, held his arms aloft more in apology than overwhelming joy. “I’m extremely proud of my first World Cup goal, but it feels unusual for me,” the Monaco striker reflected. “Cameroon is a part of me.”\n\nHe could be reassured that Rigobert Song, the Cameroon head coach and one-time Liverpool right-back, was not about to take umbrage at a compatriot raining on his Indomitable Lions’ parade. “We know each other, Breel is my little brother,” he said. “We often speak to each other on the phone and I wanted to congratulate him. It is fair play to do so. Just because we are on different teams, it does not mean we are not still brothers.”\n\nThe pressure on Embolo’s slender shoulders is colossal. His manager, Murat Yakin, has heralded this team as the finest Switzerland has assembled, capable of emulating or surpassing the country’s World Cup high water-mark as three-time quarter-finalists. They offered limited evidence of such pedigree here, labouring to subdue the enterprise of Cameroon, whose star forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting consistently sliced open their defence.\n\nBut while Xherdan Shaqiri, a born performer on the grandest stages, was kept largely quiet, Switzerland’s central midfield was marshalled expertly by Remo Freuler of Nottingham Forest and Granit Xhaka, the Arsenal captain. Xhaka, whose side next face Brazil, against whom they secured a 1-1 draw in 2018, suggested they would soon move up through the gears.\n\n“It is not chance, when you look at the last 10 to 12 years we have been in all the main tournaments,” Xhaka said. “Brazil are the favourites for the tournament, in my view, and we have to bother them as we did in 2018. They can put out three different starting XIs. We need to be very compact and not make stupid mistakes. Our team is much more experienced than four years ago. On our day we can beat anyone.”\n\nThey had plenty in reserve to vanquish Cameroon, whose approach of propelling long balls into the corners at every opportunity was soon blunted. Song was a diagram of anguish on the touchline at how many chances his players spurned. Eventually, they were punished, Shaqiri weighting a sumptuous pass from which Embolo could scarcely miss. Lashing the ball in, he quelled, if only for a few seconds, the relentless drumbeat of the Cameroon supporters. “It’s never easy playing against the country of your birth,” said Xhaka. “I know he kept quiet about his goal, but we need him for his goals.” Embolo could almost have had a second in the late stages, thwarted only by Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa’s desperate slide.\n\nNot with a bang, but with a whimper. A disappointing showing, in the end, from Cameroon, who played with such flare in the first half, which almost entirely ebbed away following Switzerland's goal.\n\nSwitzerland's quality shone through, and the win is an important one, but it wasn't a performance to have Swiss hearts aflutter. Strong showings from Shaqiri and Vargas, however, and there should be plenty to look forward to as their journey through the tournament continues.\n\nWho covered themselves in glory, and who missed the mark? Share your live player ratings here:\n\nNgamaleu scrapping for the ball gives away a free kick, which Sommer comes out to take, but as Switzerland look to flood forward, Onana runs out to bundle up the ball.\n\nCastelletto chips the ball to Fai, who goes looking for bodies in the box, but there are scant green and yellow shirts. Cameroon are looking unraveled now, and would have to spring something magic in the chunk of extra time we're sure to be handed.\n\nMbeumo takes the corner, Aboubakar hungry for the scraps, but the ball flies out of the box, some way back, for Cameroon to work in again. The ball falls back to Onana, lurking high up, but his pass doesn't find the intended target, ball falling for a Swiss throw in.\n\nNkoudou immediately asserts himself, firing into the box, before he has his pocket picked. As Switzerland play up, Widmer goes down clutching his eye after he tumbled Nkoudou. Play is waved on, thank goodness.\n\nMbeumo has the free kick, from some way out, but the ball floats well for Anguissa, who gets a good head to it, but Sommer can make the catch with ease.\n\nOn the Swiss counter, Vargas positions himself well to collect an excellent-timed cross, and Onana pulls off a heroic save to keep Switzerland from claiming another.\n\nShaqiri's corner swings in for Embolo, but Anguissa's toe pokes the ball over the cross bar in another strong piece of skill.\n\nNew eligibility rules, introduced by Fifa in 2020, mean that the number of players representing countries different to those of their birth could well rise further. In 2020, Fifa changed the player eligibility rules allowing players who have played three or fewer games – even if they were competitive matches – to switch country, as long as those appearances came before turning 21.\n\nThe change meant that Munir El Haddadi was able to play for Morocco; before, his 13 minutes for Spain in 2014 barred him from representing the country of his parents. The most obvious impact of the new rules could be to benefit smaller nations, who could now be better able to enlist diaspora players who briefly represented a bigger footballing nation before being discarded.\n\nTim Wigmore reports on the growing trend for switching national allegiances, from a World Cup where one in six players selected in the squads were born in a different country to the one that they are representing.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCameroon's Bryan Mbeumo is one such case: he was capped for France at under-21 level, but declared for the Indomitable Lions this summer.\n\nEto'o, for his part, has called the allegations entirely ludicrous, saying that the comments \"represent an insult to all these generations of players who have won competitions thanks to their efforts in clubs and within selections\".\n\nHe also called the idea of staging animal sacrifice in stadiums \"totally ridiculous\".\n\nKit squabbles\n\nCameroon came dangerously close to expulsion from this year's tournament after becoming embroiled in a dispute with former kit supplier Le Coq Sportif. FECAFOOT severed their partnership with the storied French brand over the summer, plumping to work with One All Sports, whose kit they will run out in today, due to favourable contract terms.\n\nBut Le Coq Sportif claimed breach of contract, and after discussions with FECAFOOT collapsed, brought the football federation to court in Paris, winning the subsquent ruling.\n\nDespite this, Cameroon have stuck with their new technical supplier in Qatar, and Fifa have duly recognised their updated kit sponsor. Le Coq Sportif has agreed to pause on further action in an effort not to derail Cameroon's progression at the World Cup.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Telegraph Sport's live coverage of today's first Group G clash between Switzerland and Cameroon, with kick-off at the Al Janoub stadium coming at 10am UK time.\n\nThere will be a touch of the uncanny as Switzerland return to the world stage after being drawn into a group which looks eerily similar to theirs in Russia 2018: Serbia and Brazil are the two sides they will meet again in Qatar, and only Cameroon the fresh opponents. Their run in Russia ended in the Round of 16, and this time, head coach Murat Yatkin has his Swiss side focused on far greater achievements, as he called his squad \"the best Swiss national team that has ever existed\".\n\n\"We have improved a lot, and now we want to write history.\n\n\"We are not only here to participate. We are here to win, and we want to get to the next round.\"\n\nSwitzerland have missed on matching their best-ever finish, reaching the quarter-finals, since 1954, and go into the tournament buoyed up by a successful Euros campaign in 2021 which saw them knock out favourites, and World Cup champions, France.\n\nDespite losing their warm-up friendly against Ghana 2-0, only the spectre of upsets, which have loomed large in this tournament so far, could make facing Cameroon a nervy prospect.\n\nRanked just inside the world top 50, Cameroon sit 28 points below their opponents, and may yet lose team standout Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, a lynchpin in this season's ascendant Napoli side, to injury. But led by nation team legend and record cap-holder Rigoberto Song, the Indomitable Lions are counting on fatal underestimation to deliver the death blow against Switzerland.\n\nThe head coach warned that \"rankings go out the window when you are on a football pitch\", and this has been true nowhere else more than this World Cup – ask Lionel Messi.\n\nWill we be treated to another upset? A drubbing? Or an altogether more cagey nil-nil draw? Stay tuned as we bring you team news, build-up, full match coverage and reaction."
