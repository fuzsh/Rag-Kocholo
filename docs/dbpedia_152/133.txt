WVEE (103.3 FM, "V-103") is one of the most popular urban-formatted radio stations in the country and the highest-rated station of the Atlanta radio stations by Arbitron.Fact|date=August 2008 WVEE has Atlanta as its city of license, and is owned by CBS Radio, a subsidiary of the CBS Corporation.

It shares a tower with WPBA TV 30, and in fact shares the same antenna with WSB-FM 98.5 and WSTR FM 94.1 operating at an effective radiated power of 100 kilowatts in midtown Atlanta. The three radio stations' transmitters are diplexed together, so that they all feed to the antenna instead of into each other.

History

The station that became "V-103" began back in the late 1940s as WAGA-FM, on 102.9 with a country music format. It was originally co-owned by Storer Broadcasting with WAGA-AM (now WYZE) and television station WAGA-TV channel 5, a CBS-turned FOX affiliate.

WAGA-FM became WPLO-FM when it moved to 103.3 and simulcasted WPLO AM. They maintained the country format, but with many top-40 cuts. WPLO-FM was operated by Georgia State University students during the late 1960s before WRAS FM 88.5 signed on. WPLO-FM was its previous callsign, as both stations were owned by Plough Broadcasting which later became Schering-Plough Broadcasting.

In 1968, WPLO-FM changed its format from top-40 to hard rock. WPLO-FM then changed its format from rock to country music once again. In 1976, 103.3 changed call letters and formats from WPLO-FM country to WVEE-FM urban contemporary and began using the "V-103" moniker. It briefly aired a Disco format in the late 1970s

In the early 1980s, DKM Broadcasting Corporation purchased WVEE-FM and sister station WAOK. On January 1, 1988, WVEE was sold, along with other DKM-owned properties in Denver, Baltimore, Springfield, Lincoln, Akron, Dayton and Dallas, for $200,000,000 to The Summit Communications Group, Inc. In March 1995, Summit sold its interests in WVEE FM and WAOK AM to Granum Communications, Inc. (Herbert W. McCord, Peter Ferrara, and Michael Weinstein). In March 1996, Granum Communications sold both to Infinity Broadcasting.

In 2000, "V-103" after many years of operating as an urban contemporary station that only played R&B and classic soul added hip hop full-time to compete with Radio One's WHTA ("Hot 97.5", now "Hot 107.9") in addition to direct competitor Cox's WALR-FM ("Kiss 104.7", now "Kiss 104.1", which also added more current R&B songs) and to appeal more to the precious 18-34 demographic. In 2003, "V-103" changed its longtime station slogan from "The People's Station" to "Atlanta's BIG Station" to signify its dominance of Atlanta urban radio and being #2 (now #1) overall behind radio market leader WSB AM. Recently it reverted back to the previous slogan "The People's Station" to signify its commitment to the community.

Since Fall 2006, V-103 has premiered a HD Radio frequency for playing Urban Adult Contemporary music.
