        "text": "MARIETTA, GA--(Marketwired - Mar 20, 2014) - WetWinds Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of East Coast Diversified Corporation (OTCQB: ECDC), today announced that it has entered a promotion and marketing agreement with Atlanta's number one Radio Station to help introduce its social media platform to local audience.\n\nVir2o is an interactive social media platform. It allows users to share content in real time. Unlike most platforms that allow the posting of comments or information to be viewed, Vir2o allow users to nVite each other into private settings and share content such as music, photos, live broadcasts and movies or user may go shopping together using its proprietary nVite technology.\n\n\"What's missing in social media is content, today content is only offered outside of social media whether its movies, music or sports, it's all happening outside of social media, when it's all said and done 'content is king,' hence the volatility in the movement of users between platforms and apps, users are bored and restless. How users get to share content in an engaging way is what Vir2o brings to social media,\" said Kayode Aladesuyi, ECDC Chairman/CEO.\n\nWVEE Radio personality Greg Street will anchor the introduction of Vir2o to the Atlanta market. Greg Street has been one of the most popular radio personalities in the Atlanta market for almost 20 years. His 6pm-10pm audience is perfect for social media. WVEE has approximately 1.2million listeners in the Atlanta market.\n\n\"This is a major market test for Vir2o, if successful, will be deployed in strategic markets across the country. WVEE is a powerhouse in Atlanta I can't imagine a better partner for introduction to the market,\" said Shannon Sancho, ECDC Marketing Executive.\n\nVir2o has executed similar agreements with Cool FM the number one radio station in Lagos Nigeria, the most populous African city and Radio Unilag, the college radio for the University of Lagos.\n\nFor more information on East Coast Diversified and its group of companies, please visit: www.vir2o.com\n\nwww.eastcoastdiversified.com\n\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995: The statements contained in this release which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements.
