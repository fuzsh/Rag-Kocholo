        "text": "There are a few things I'd like to say after my slightly viral post yesterday: 1. It's shocking, but not surprising, how many women living in the UK feel unsafe doing completely normal things like going for a walk or taking a taxi. Thank you to everyone who shared their story and reassured me that I am not acting over the top. Better safe than sorry. We do this to protect ourselves. Which brings me to the next point. 2. Men are not the problem. Some men are. But if the good men don't know about women's very real every day fears, they can't become allies and help us change our status quo. 3. There are a number of things men can do. BE LADS is a fantastic campaign to educate yourself, please check it out: https://belads.co.uk/ 4. More needs to happen to help women feel safe. This comment nearly made me cry as I could relate with it so much: \"I dream of a day I can can walk my dog alone and feel safe much more than I dream of equality in all board rooms\". What is the next step to make this happen?! If you have an idea, please tag people in relevant positions below. 5. Educate your daughters, but also your sons, and raise them to support women. 6. I don't hate men. I have a wonderful son, brother, husband, and father figure(s). I know most men have no bad intentions. The sad truth, however, is that 100% of perpetrators are men, and we simply don't know the difference when we walk down a dark path, or get in a taxi, so we don't chance it. 7. We need to talk more. About our challenges as women. About our challenges as men. About our challenges as non-binary folk. Only if we share our lived experiences can we come close to understanding these challenges, and work together to making a difference. 8. Post that thing. I thought it would be too much. I had written the post weeks ago but only had the courage to post it yesterday. It reached 100k people. Don't procrastinate if something is close to your heart. #safety #womensday #inspireinclusion\n\n8 women killed in Australia in the past two weeks. As a young woman striving for change, it's disheartening when comedians use their platform to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Matt Ride's joke about domestic violence isn't just unfunny; it's a reinforcement of archaic attitudes that belittle and dehumanize women. It's distressing to witness someone with influence contribute to the normalization of such harmful behavior. Growing up in a generation where social media plays a pivotal role, it's crucial to address these issues head-on. Women are not objects or placeholders to be demeaned in any context, especially not as the subject of a tasteless joke. Such insensitivity not only reflects poorly on the comedian but also sets a damaging precedent for how men perceive and treat women. This incident highlights the urgent need for education and advocacy to foster a more respectful and equitable society. It's imperative to challenge these harmful narratives and encourage a culture where everyone, regardless of gender, is treated with dignity and respect. As young women, it's crucial to raise our voices against such regressive attitudes and strive for a world where jokes at the expense of anyone's safety and dignity are never considered acceptable. #mattrife #domesticabuse #domesticviolence #dvawareness #feminist #16day\n\nJulia Mazur, a 29-year-old single woman, became the center of a right-wing shitstorm for *checks notes* posting a video of her making eggs and watching TV on a Sunday morning. At first glance, this seems like a story of some random person on the Internet becoming the main character of the day because social media/society is broken. But it's actually much worse. The Daily Wire‚Äôs Matt Walsh was at the center of it, bombarding a random woman just living her life with a targeted harassment campaign to drive his own engagement and build his own audience. It was harassment for profit. Sadly this strategy is common on the Right a lot of people don't even realize it's a thing. I‚Äôve written a lot about how the Daily Wire and its talent target female celebrities with hate and harassment to build their audience, but this is a reminder that anyone online is vulnerable to having their life upended for another person or company's clout and clicks. (Another example of this is Libs of TikTok) I help organizations think through how to protect their staff from targeted harassment, but I'm still trying to figure out what a scalable solution for this kind drive-by of harassment from right-wing media might look like and how it could be there to assist folks like Julie who want resources and help.\n\nNote: A touch of humour has been shimmerüëá \"YOU BELONG TO THE KITCHEN\" üë©üç≥ was the response from one of my follower, you wonder why would he say that? what was the context! üôá‚ôÄÔ∏è long story short: I had opinions:{ while scrolling through instagram I came across a reel, A reel where a woman was dancing with her kids in the rain! so what's new you might ask? well the comment section, they were a reflection of how society perceive women now a daysüîç following were the comments: -\"She is using her kids for attention\" -\"why would she wear that?\"(she was wearing a simple kurti, no that they had any right to say something even if she had something else on) -\"why would she post that\" these are the most censored comments I could find, was she wrong for posting? ~ absolutely, how can she post these happy moments with her kids even after knowing that most people have become a sponge that only absorbs garbage content and sexualize women on daily basis while taking no responsibility as such, poor lady had it coming ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è Am i wrong for keeping forward my opinion? ~No doubt, how can I take stand for myself without considering the fragile egos that might get hurt in the process, foolish me ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è so ladies and gentleman,üë´ Next time be aware of what you post, Make sure you crush every fragile ego that comes in the way, Be loud and clear so that the people hiding behind the screen can listen properly üë®üíª #linkedin #linkedincommunity #linkdinpost #standup #instagram\n\nNot that you request to Google \"husband slept with champion friend\" to cognize that it happens but, for the record, it is not uncommon... The videos featured things similar the champion person and the hubby embracing each other, jumping successful pools latched connected to 1 different (even aft they deed the water), and more.
