        "text": "Meri and Kody Brown announced their split in January 2023 after years of marital problems\n\nMeri became Kody's first wife when they legally married in 1990. The two then decided as a couple to live plural marriage, and Janelle Brown became the first sister wife to join their family when she \"spiritually\" married Kody in 1993.\n\nMeri and Kody, who have one child together, remained legally married for about 14 years. In 2014, she divorced Kody so he could legally marry his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, in order to adopt Robyn's three older children from a previous marriage. Though they were no longer legally married, they remained spiritually married.\n\nBut in 2015, Meri was the victim of a catfishing scandal that caused her marriage to Kody to become estranged. As depicted on \"Sister Wives,\" Kody cited diminished trust in Meri as the reason why he stopped visiting Meri's house and ceased to have romantic feelings for her.\n\nIn the \"Sister Wives\" season 16 tell-all special that aired in 2022, Meri suggested that her marital problems with Kody had started long before she was tricked into an emotional relationship with a catfish. Meri admitted to host Sukanya Krishnan that she hadn't been intimate with Kody for a decade.\n\nEven when faced with Kody's blatant disregard for her on episodes of \"Sister Wives,\" Meri said that she stayed with the family because of her faith, her commitment to the family, and the hope she held onto that Kody would one day want to reconcile with her romantically.\n\nMeri refused to consider herself separated from Kody, though she knew he had no interest in repairing their bond. But in January 2023, the pair finally announced the official end of their \"spiritual\" marriage.\n\n\"After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our own unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship,\" a statement posted to their Instagram accounts read.\n\nMeri's gradual distancing from Kody and Robyn played out on season 18 of \"Sister Wives,\" which filmed in late 2021 and early 2022. At the time of filming, Kody's former third wife, Christine Brown, had already left him, and Janelle was in the process of splitting from him as well.\n\nWhere does Meri Brown live now?\n\nIn a season 18 episode of \"Sister Wives,\" Meri discussed her move to Utah with Robyn, remarking that she didn't think Kody would \"give a crap\" about her moving to Utah. She also assured a stressed out Robyn that she'd still maintain a home in Flagstaff, Arizona (where the Brown family has lived for the past few years) and intended to split her time between Flagstaff and Lizzie's Heritage Inn, the bed-and-breakfast she owns in Parowan, Utah. Meri bought that property, which used to be owned by her family generations ago, in 2017.\n\nWhile the conversation between Meri and Robyn would have been filmed around a year before Meri and Kody officially announced their split, it doesn't appear as though she is spending much time, if any, in Flagstaff anymore. Meri shared a post after visiting Utah's Zion National Park in September 2023. Plus, she hosts a live chat with her best friend Jenn Sullivan many Friday nights talking to fans on Instagram, often from inside Lizzie's Heritage Inn.\n\nWhen she's not running the inn, Meri also clearly loves to travel, and has used social media to document her trips. She visited New York City in late summer 2023, and was in California in July 2023.\n\nWhat does Meri Brown do for a living?\n\nIn addition to the salary she earns for appearing on TLC's \"Sister Wives,\" which is expected to return for season 19, Meri presumably generates income from Lizzie's Heritage Inn. On top of the money presumably generated from guest stays, the inn's website sells branded merch, including baseball caps and hand-cut stone coasters.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMeri has also been selling clothing for the multi-level marketing company LuLaRoe since 2016. On season 18 episodes, Meri shared that she was considering moving inventory for her clothing business from Arizona to the Utah inn.\n\nMeri also offers personalized video messages to fans on Cameo for $150.\n\nDoes Meri Brown have a boyfriend?\n\nAfter her split from Kody, Meri was presumed to be single. She regularly posted pictures with friends on Instagram while traveling, sometimes sharing the ways they've helped her while she's on her 2023 personal growth journey.\n\nIn February 2023, shortly after announcing she'd left Kody, Meri shared a cheeky \"relationship status\" update on her Instagram story just ahead of Valentine's Day. \"Relationship Status: committed to inner peace, growth, self love and gratitude,\" the quote in Meri's post read, per People.\n\nBut in January 2024, Meri announced in an Instagram post honoring her 53rd birthday that she had been dating a man named Amos since October 2023.\n\n\"He's not 6 foot 6, nor is he a pilot, but he loves Christmas almost as much as I do, and we laugh a lot together, both of which are important elements to a relationship,\" she wrote in the post's caption.\n\nMeri continued the caption by explaining why she hadn't revealed her new relationship sooner.\n\n\"I've been keeping this kind of close to me as we've been enjoying the last few months of dating and getting to know each other,\" Meri wrote. \"As I've considered when and how I wanted to share this fun news and share him with the world (jk, not really sharing, I'm keeping him to myself) I knew I wanted to celebrate my birthday in a special way and let you celebrate this with me!\""
