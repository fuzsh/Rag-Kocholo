        "text": "The entire region that includes the Flagstaff Area National Monuments has been home to Native people since time immemorial.\n\nThe Flagstaff Area National Monuments (Walnut Canyon, Sunset Crater Volcano, and Wupatki) are places of immeasurable importance to Native peoples in the Southwest. Wupatki shares boundaries with the Navajo Nation, and a total of thirteen federally recognized tribes are traditionally associated with the Monuments. Park staff have been working with tribal people for many years and are creating ever-better collaborative tribal partnerships.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the Native peoples on whose ancestral homelands we gather, as well as the diverse and vibrant Native communities who continue to make their home here today.\n\nAs we celebrate Native heritage, please take a moment to ponder and appreciate the diverse cultural stories these lands hold. This history, played out on lands including the Flagstaff Area National Monuments, has been dramatic and difficult - but learning from the past can help us all in the future.\n\nTraditionally Associated Tribes\n\nThere are thirteen tribes connected to the lands and resources now found within the Flagstaff Area National Monuments:\n\nFort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona\n\nHavasupai Tribe of the Havasupai Reservation, Arizona\n\nHopi Tribe of Arizona\n\nHualapai Tribe of the Hualapai Indian Reservation, Arizona\n\nKaibab Band of Paiute Indians of the Kaibab Indian Reservation, Arizona\n\nNavajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico, & Utah\n\nSan Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona\n\nSan Juan Southern Paiute Tribe of Arizona\n\nTonto Apache Tribe of Arizona\n\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona\n\nYavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona\n\nYavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe"
