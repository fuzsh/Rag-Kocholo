        "text": "Audacy announces two talent additions to V-103 (WVEE-FM) in Atlanta. Jazzy McBee joins “The Big Tigger Morning Show” as co-host, weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. ET beginning January 16. The station also welcomes Danie B as midday host from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. ET, effective immediately.\n\n“Danie B is very creative and has already given us a glimpse of what she has in store for middays, and Jazzy is going to turn up with Big Tigger in the morning,” said Reggie Rouse, Vice President of Programming and Brand Manager, V-103.\n\n“It’s a dream come true to have the opportunity to be on air in my hometown on the station that made me fall in love with radio,” said Danie B. “I’ve always wanted to be on V-103, and I am so grateful to Dave Richards, Rick Caffey and Reggie Rouse for seeing something in me and allowing me to prove myself on this iconic brand. I don’t take it for granted, and after ten years away from Atlanta, I’m more than ready to come back home!”\n\nDanie B is an Atlanta, GA native who most recently spent time on the Florida airwaves at Star 94.5 (WCFB-FM), Power 95.3 (WPYO-FM), Hot 101.5 (WTBV-FM) and 101.9 AMP Radio (WQMP-FM). She also previously served as co-host of “Danie and Kevin Mornings” and Assistant Director of Branding and Programming at Power 95.3. During a stint in Albany, NY in 2013, she was an afternoon personality and later a morning host on Jamz 96.3 (WAJZ-FM). While there, she also hosted live weekend shows on K104.7 (WSPK-FM) in Poughkeepsie, NY and Audacy Boston’s WBGB-FM. She also hosted middays on Z97.1 (WZRT-FM) in Rutland, VT. Her radio career began in 2010 as an intern for The Georgia News Network and 640 WGST, where she landed her first job with Total Traffic Network as a traffic reporter/producer and eventually lead traffic producer while also acting as a weekend talent on WILD 105.7/96.7 in Atlanta.\n\n“I can’t tell you enough about how excited and grateful I am for the opportunity to be a part of such an influential radio station,” said McBee. “I look forward to doing great things and bringing a fresh perspective to the airwaves. Thank you to the entire Audacy family! I can’t wait to talk to you, Atlanta, on THE PEOPLE’S STATION, V103!”\n\nJazzy McBee, also known as “Miss 10 til 2” and “The Voice of Atlanta,” is a Decatur, GA philanthropist, inspirational speaker, entrepreneur, beauty enthusiast, host, and media maven. She joined Streetz 94.5 as a co-host and later took over the weekday midday timeslot with her own show. McBee has been awarded numerous proclamations and honors, including the Georgia State Capitol “Women in Radio,” the House of Representatives and Senate, The City of Atlanta-Women in Radio & Community and Atlanta City Council Recognition. McBee has dipped her toe in on-camera roles with the television series “The One” and MTV’s film production of “Pretty Stoned.” She is also the founder of “Wyn Myx Hair” (formerly “The Jazzy Girls Hair Collection”) and The Fab 5 Foundation, Inc., which is a nonprofit focused on cultivating the minds of young girls through confidence and higher education. Additionally, McBee has hosted initiatives for 100 Women’s Empowerment at the Georgia State Capitol."
