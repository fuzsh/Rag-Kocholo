        "text": "Dear Annie: I’m retired, which is fine, but not having to go to a job only leaves me with more time to live with my problem. It’s one that I’ve had for a very long time. My wife’s sister came to live with us, and I got along with her very well, and when I wasn’t working, we spent a lot of time together. We had a lot in common, which led to me actually falling for her.\n\nI doubt that she feels the same way, and I never told her or anyone about it, but that doesn’t make it any less of a problem. I know it has affected my marriage, but I just can’t find a way to fall out of love with either one.\n\nShe hasn’t lived with us for a long time now, but she’s still with us even though she’s not living with us. I try to go on as though nothing is wrong, but I know it would be better if I could erase it from my mind, but I guess it’s going to be here until I’m gone.\n\nShould I tell my wife?\n\n-- Life Problems\n\nDear Life Problems: You didn’t specify how your marriage was affected by your crush on your wife’s sister. The truth is you are allowed to be friends with your sister-in-law and get along with her, but while you are married, you are not allowed to act on it. Ask yourself why you felt so attracted to your sister-in-law instead of your wife. Sometimes when there are problems, it is easier to fantasize about what life with another would be like, when in reality that is just a fantasy and real life is passing you by. Seek the help of a professional marriage counselor to help you and your wife.\n\nDear Annie: Thank you so much for printing the letter from “Hungry Pets.” I applaud her suggestions and was grateful for your response. I just wanted to add one or two absolutely crucial suggestions.\n\nIn cold climates, the warmth of a hot car engine is irresistible to a freezing and hungry animal, and I think just how often this leads to a situation beyond horrific would shock people. Please, please, to all who read this and love animals, just bang on your hood three times before you start your car in the morning.\n\nMy second suggestion: whether you recycle or not, please crush any metal cans that have had food in them, and if possible, put the lids back on plastic containers. An animal with its head trapped in a can will die a terrible death, just for the crime of being hungry, and this also happens more frequently than anyone can know.\n\nThank you for your time and for all the good you do, Annie.\n\n-- Hit the Hood"
