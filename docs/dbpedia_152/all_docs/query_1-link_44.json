        "text": "April 12, 2015\n\nSunday Apr 12, 2015\n\nGreetings from Las Vegas, site of the annual NAB convention. I hope to see many of you here.\n\nRTDNA is sponsoring a (very) informal gathering on Tuesday night, beginning at 9:00 PM at the Parasol Down bar at the Wynn Hotel and Casino. That’s the night before the ‘RTDNA @ NAB’ seminar which will take place on Wednesday. I hope to see you there.\n\nTurning to our normal business, not much activity this week, with ONE news director departure announced, and TWO ND jobs filled (one with an asterisk!), with another consolidated with a sister station.\n\nThose changes mean 27 stations are now looking for NDs.\n\nWe have TWO new help wanted ads for a total of FOUR ads for different jobs in a wide range of markets ranging from coast-to-coast.\n\nIn addition, TWO of the advertisers that help support this newsletter will be exhibiting at the NAB conference. I hope you’ll stop by their booths and learn more about their services. Their ads below will tell you where their exhibits are.\n\nWe have TWO obituaries, and several items in Names in the News, including details about a bad health report for a veteran ND, a longtime Tribune exec on the move, and the complete list of IRE winners.\n\nNew News Director Openings:\n\nWISH-TV, Indianapolis, IN…the end of the May rating book will bring the curtain down on the 20 year career here for STEVE BRAY. He’s been the ND for 2 1/2 years, and held several management positions before moving into the ND job. Steve oversaw news expansion earlier this year after the station lost its CBS affiliation and linked up with the CW network, He first joined the station as the weekend meteorologist, was promoted to Chief Meteorologist four years later, and maintained the title even though he rarely appeared on air over the last few years. The Indianapolis Business Journal has more. Steve’s also worked in Mobile, Lake Charles, and Decatur.\n\nSpeaking of Indiana ND openings, please note the new ad below for the opening in Ft. Wayne. We told you last week that PETER NEUMANN is retiring from WTPA-WISE-TV.\n\nNewly Named News Directors:\n\nKTSM-TV, El Paso, TX…REY CHAVEZ returns to El Paso and KTSM as the next ND for this Nexstar-owned NBC affiliate. Rey has an extensive background, much of it in Spanish language stations in large markets. It’s all detailed here in his Linkedin page. But 30 years ago he worked as a director for KTSM. He replaces LAUREN MACIAS-CERVANTES who left the station last month after more than four years as ND.\n\nWEAU-TV, Eau Claire, WI...I think that ANDREW FEFER has been promoted to news director here. After all, that’s what his bio on the station website says. Being old-fashioned, I emailed him to confirm his promotion and to ask when it had happened. His response: “I’m sorry, but I have no comment.” O-kay. He did give me the phone number for the GM, who I’m guessing isn’t in on Sunday. If in fact the station’s website is correct, Andrew replaces MIKE LOPEZ who was there about two years. Andrew’s also worked in Wausau and Green Bay. WEAU is an NBC affiliate owned by Gray Television.\n\nAlso, please note that we’ve removed the NE opening for WDAZ-TV in Grand Forks, ND from our list of openings. JEFF NELSON, who oversees sister station WDAY-TV, will now oversee WDAZ-TV as well. Jeff’s been the ND at WDAY for more than ten years.\n\nPaid Help Wanted Ads:\n\nNews Director, WPTA/WISE-TV, Ft. Wayne, IN:\n\nHEADLINE: Experienced News Director wanted to lead a fantastic news team in beautiful Northeast Indiana.\n\nOur next News Director will lead our stations’ news operation, both on-air and on-line. If you are passionate, sharp and love to enrich viewer’s lives, you’re what we’re looking for.\n\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE:\n\nAbility to meet deadlines while handling multiple tasks.\n\nPreparing and maintaining departmental budgets.\n\nDeveloping news coverage strategies for 2 TV stations and an extensive arsenal of digital properties.\n\nMinimum 5 years experience in TV news and a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism or related field.\n\nWorking with other department heads to establish and reach goals.\n\nDeveloping your staff through critiques, training and mentoring.\n\nExemplary oral and written communications skills.\n\nNever considered Northeast Indiana? Well, you’ve been missing out! Low cost of living, affordable homes, beautiful lakes, great sports and accolades galore from some of the nation’s leading publications. Centrally located from Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit and Cincinnati, everyone loves Northeast Indiana as a contender in a land full of kings. You can make your mark here, and you will.

Not familiar with WKBF? Wikipedia to the rescue! Alan spent almost 25 years as a reporter for WEWS-TV in Cleveland, which detailed his passing here in a report which includes links to some of his stories. Alan also worked in Youngstown and once led a fund-raising drive for new uniforms for his high school band.\n\nAnd I’m sorry to report the death of my mother-in-law, BEVERLY SHIPPEE, who died in her sleep Thursday morning at her Detroit home. She was 87. In addition to my wife, KAREN BURNS, she is survived by another daughter, MARGARET KNIGHT, and a son, JAMES SHIPPEE. More in this obituary.\n\nSituations Wanted:\n\nWe offer a free situations wanted ad to news managers who are out of work and looking for a new opportunity.

The honors will be presented at the annual IRE convention in Philadelphia this June. (As I’ve mentioned before, the IRE conference is, in my opinion, terrific. If you’re working in a newsroom and haven’t been, you should make every effort to go.) Here’s the list of winners.\n\nSEAN KENNEDY has a new job but doesn’t have to move. He’s been named the Assistant ND at KSWB-TV, the Tribune-owned FOX affiliate in San Diego. Sean spent almost ten years in the same role at KGTV in San Diego. Before that, he was an ND in Shreveport for five years. He’s previously worked in Dallas as an EP for the now-defunct Texas Cable News, and in Springfield, MO.\n\nLongtime newsman FORREST CARR has hit an unfortunate bump in the road in his battle against cancer. He tells the whole story in his latest blog post, which you can find by clicking here. Forrest has twice been a news director in Tucson, as well as in Tampa, Ft. Myers, and Albuquerque. He’s been working in radio in Tucson, and pursuing his first love, fiction writing.\n\nGeneral Manager News:\n\nOne time CLTV (Chicago) news director STEVE FARBER has joined Weigel Broadcasting as its SVP of Operations. Steve spent more than 20 years at Tribune Broadcasting in a variety of roles, as you will learn by reading this story.\n\nTIM BENNETT has been named GM of WUPA-TV in Atlanta.
