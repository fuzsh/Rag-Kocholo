        "text": "Entercom, a leading media and entertainment company and the #1 creator of live, original, local audio content, today announced a new weekday programming lineup for The People’s Station V-103 (WVEE-FM), the ATL’s No. 1 for hip-hop and R&B. As part of the updates, current afternoon show host Big Tigger will host a new morning show, “The Morning Culture with Big Tigger,” weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. ET. The station subsequently welcomes Kenny Burns as afternoon show host. “The Kenny Burns Show” will be heard weekdays from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Both changes are effective August 17.\n\n“During his time with us at V-103, I have seen Big Tigger take over Atlanta as a premier talent and generous community activist who is connected to the people. We believe he will bring his high energy and creativity to mornings at the station,” said Rick Caffey, Senior Vice President and Market Manager, Entercom Atlanta. “Just as important, we see Kenny Burns bringing his added years of experience, industry work, and current show success to the station and we’re excited to welcome him back.”\n\n“I am extremely excited for the opportunity to wake up Atlanta every morning with good energy, good music, and a good time,” said Big Tigger.\n\nBig Tigger joined Entercom in 2013 as host of “The Big Tigger Show” on V-103. He also currently serves as the official DJ and Music Director of the Atlanta Hawks as well as DJ for Atlanta Falcons tailgates at the Home Depot Backyard in Atlanta. He is also known for hosting multiple BET Network shows including “Rap City: The Basement,” the longest running, nationally televised hip-hop show, “106 & Park,” “BET Awards Post Party Live” and the “BET Awards Red Carpet Show,” as well as the voice and co-host of the 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 “Soul Train Awards.” In 2003, he created and launched “Live in the Den with Big Tigger,” a three-hour, syndicated show that aired for more than 10 years in 67 markets and three countries until ending in 2013. He won an Emmy Award in 2013 for his weekly television show “Direct Access with Big Tigger.”\n\n“I am excited to announce that ‘the people’s champ’ is coming back to ‘the people’s station,’ V-103,” said Kenny Burns. “I am ready to work hard to inspire and entertain Atlanta and beyond and can’t wait to connect with my audience every afternoon.”\n\nKenny Burns is an entrepreneur, producer and author with over 20 years of experience across the entertainment, music, fashion, radio, television, and marketing industries. The move marks Burns’ second stint with V-103, as he previously served as an on-air host from 2011 to 2013. Early in his career he worked with the likes of songstress Monica, Jay-Z, and his first music concept, Dream – the only female Pop group to debut at No. 2 on Billboard charts. As an executive, he continued to achieve platinum success with Mariah Carey’s Monarch Music, signing international music superstar Akon, discovering fellow Washingtonian hip-hop artist Wale, and becoming Vice President of the iconic hip-hop music label Roc-A-Fella Records."
