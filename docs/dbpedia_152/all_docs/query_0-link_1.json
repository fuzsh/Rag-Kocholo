        "text": "I (34M) have been married to my wife Michelle (32F) for 4 years, and we’ve been together for 6. Michelle also has an older sister Sharon (34F).\n\nGrowing up, Sharon and I were pretty close friends because we sort of had the same interests, she was into sports, we did the same activities together etc. We were pretty much best friends and I sort of considered her more like my own sister, or an extension of me, because we were both so similar. We even pursued the same field in college. We dated many different people, but never each other, because we were basically like siblings.\n\nI never really spoke with her sister Michelle during our teenage years because she was two years younger, and also we had nothing in common. However, a few years after Michelle graduated college, we did start talking more often, because there was a sort of romantic attraction and tension there. I asked her out shortly after, we dated for a couple of years and we married. We also have 2 children now. Through all this, Sharon was really happy for the both of us, and she thought we were perfect for each other.\n\nA few months ago, Sharon called me to her apartment because she wanted a serious chat, and she basically admitted that she had feelings for me for a long time, and that she knew it was wrong. She was crying really heavy, and she said she doesn’t want to ruin mine and Michelle’s life, but she had no else to talk to about this.\n\nThis whole thing came as a huge surprise to me because I always thought Sharon considered me like her brother. I told Sharon that I wouldn’t tell Michelle about this because it would really ruin their sibling relationship, and it would ruin the entire family dynamics, but I also told Sharon that she needed to go to therapy to address these feelings, but that I would always be there to listen to her.\n\nSharon has started online therapy, and we have sort of maintained our distance, but she does to come to me to occasionally to talk about her therapy progress.\n\nAITAH in how I’m handling all this?"
