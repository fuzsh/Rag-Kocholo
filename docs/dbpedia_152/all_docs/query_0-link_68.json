        "text": "Answer\n\nIn this counseling answer:\n\nSpeak with your wife honestly and openly about your feelings regarding her Sister.\n\nUse I-statements and active listening during this conversion.\n\nRemember that your sister in law is hurting right now. Consider talking about counseling with your wife as she can advise her sister.\n\nSpeak with your wife about passion within the marriage.\n\nDo something special for your wife as a way to rekindle the passion and create a positive environment.\n\nMake dua for help with your marriage and for help for your sister in law.\n\nAssalamu alaikum,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write in and share your concerns with us. It is my understanding you are happily married to your cousin, yet you stated your passion is dwindling. I also understand you feel her sister interferes in your relationship and is currently getting a divorce.\n\nTo begin with Brother, the first thing to bring up is honest and open communication. Does your wife know that you are afraid her sister is trying to hurt your marriage? Have you spoken with her about this and told her how it makes you feel?\n\nAn important note is that this type of conversation needs to be handled with care and empathy. This is her Sister, her family, your sister in law, and your family as well now.\n\nHere are some helpful tips for approaching this topic with your wife.\n\nSpeak to her in a comfortable and private place, such as an area of your home that you both enjoy relaxing in.\n\nBe mindful not to say anything aggressively or accusatory towards her. She is your wife; and she wants you both to be happy as you do. She may not even realize how you feel.\n\nPractice I-statements with your wife. For example, “I feel worried and saddened when I hear conversations about XYZ with your sister”\n\nAsk her openly how she feels about the current situation with her Sister and listen with an open heart.\n\nPractice active listening. This means do not listen with the intent to respond, but rather to understand. Look her in the eyes, do not get distracted by phones or other items. Occasionally repeat words back to her to show you are paying attention, such as “I understand you feel your Sister is hurting and you are trying to help her”. It will let her know you are paying attention to her feelings about this topic and help her to feel more comfortable speaking openly.\n\nIf voices are raised at some point or arguing ensues, you can both step away and take time to calm down. If negativity like this happens it shuts down healthy communication.\n\nYou can both discuss and decide if you want to have a family discussion with your sister in law involved. Your wife may not feel comfortable with this, she may prefer to speak with her sister alone initially. Either route is sufficient to ensure she understands how both of you feel.\n\nSister is Hurt\n\nAn important element here is you said she is divorcing right now. That means she is hurting, probably a lot more than you will ever see. Her heart is broken, and she will need time to heal from her divorce. This is not an overnight or easy process.\n\nYour wife is not responsible to heal her, but at the same time please remember your wife is one of her Sister’s most important social support relationships. Consider how you would react if it were your sibling divorcing and in pain?\n\nI encourage you to consider mentioning counseling to your wife, specifically counseling for her sister. Your wife can sit down with her and bring up the topic of counseling.\n\nInshallah if your sister in law were to try personal counseling it could help her heal from this divorce in a healthier way and also help take some emotional strain from your wife as she is probably hurting seeing her sister in pain.\n\nCheck out this counseling video:\n\nPassion Dwindling\n\nPassion is not static in marriages. It goes up and down over the course of the marriage. This is something we can consciously make efforts to help and stir that fire. Please speak with your wife about this and let her know how you feel.\n\nPlease remember the I-statements mentioned above. You can use statements like “I feel less passionate lately” or “It is becoming difficult for me to feel intimate and passionate”.\n\nI also encourage you to think about moments with your wife that were full of passion. Try to recreate some of those by using elements that were present during this.\n\nFor example, if you recall a time that involved a specific type of meal you both shared and a specific song then you could cook that meal for her and play the song after. This is a romantic and heartfelt gesture.\n\nIf you have something specific you would like her to do, do not feel shy to speak with her. Marriage requires communication, effort, and a willingness to try and understand the other.\n\n“And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy”\n\n[Quran 30:21]\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHere is a summary of your next steps moving forward Brother.\n\nSpeak with her honestly and openly about your feelings regarding her sister\n\nUse I-statements and active listening during this conversion\n\nRemember that your sister in law is hurting right now. Consider talking about counseling with your wife as she can advise her sister\n\nSpeak with your wife about passion within the marriage\n\nDo something special for your wife as a way to rekindle the passion and create a positive environment\n\nOn a final note, I encourage you to make dua for help with your marriage and for help for your sister in law. Inshallah as your sister in law heals, it will help mend the relationship you both have with her.\n\nMay Allah (swt) heal your heart, heal your Sister in law, guide all of you to a happier family dynamic and protect your marriage, ameen.\n\nSalam,\n\n***\n\nDisclaimer: The conceptualization and recommendations stated in this response are very general and purely based on the limited information provided in the question.
