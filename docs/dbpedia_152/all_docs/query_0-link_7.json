        "text": "Answer\n\nWa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.\n\nIn the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\n\nAll praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.\n\nIn this fatwa:\n\nIslam forbade taking two sisters as co-wives at the same time because the feeling of love and sisterliness which Islam wants to maintain between sisters would be destroyed if one sister became the co-wife of the same husband.\n\nEvery committed Muslim should accept Allah’s Commands willingly, even without realizing the wisdom behind the Divine rule in question.\n\nIf man manages to realize the wisdom behind certain prohibited things, it is well and good.\n\nIf his mind fails to comprehend that Divine Wisdom, then he should accept the truth as it is, keeping in mind that Allah Almighty is the All-Knowing of what is beneficial to His Creatures.\n\nWhen Allah Almighty prohibits something for His servants, He does so certainly out of His overflowing mercy on them, to save them from all that may harm them. He is indeed Ever-Kind and Most Glorious!\n\nYour concern for your sister-in-law is commendable, but you are prohibited from marrying her while you are still married to her sister. You could make more efforts to find a suitable husband for her, even someone who is already married or has been previously married.\n\nAs opposed to the practice of the period of jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era), Islam forbade taking two sisters as co-wives at the same time because the feeling of love and sisterliness which Islam wants to maintain between sisters would be destroyed if one sister became the co-wife of the same husband.\n\nWhile the Qur’an mentioned the two sisters, the Prophet (peace and blessings be on him) added, ‘A man may not be married to a woman and her paternal aunt (at the same time), nor to a woman and her maternal aunt.’ (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) And he said, ‘If you do this, you will sever your ties of kinship.’ (Ibn Hibban) Then, how could Islam permit the breaking of such kinship ties when it places so much importance on them?\n\nFor more, see these fatwas:\n\nWhat Are the Conditions of Marriage in Islam?\n\nWhat Invalidates Marriage in Islam"
