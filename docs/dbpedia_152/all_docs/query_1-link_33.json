        "text": "I was contemplating how I was going to do this post. In the end, I figured it all out. So, in this post, we’re just gonna talk about nothing but CBS’ owned-and-operated stations because there have been huge moves involving local newscasts across its station group over the past two months.\n\nFor the record here, not EVERY station or duopoly is involved with this, so keep that in mind while you are reading this.\n\nSo there has been a huge investment happening at CBS News and Stations, the official name for its local owned-and-operated station division that’s within Paramount Global, which owns CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System.\n\nThey first opened up an Innovation Lab at its DFW studios where KTVT 11 (CBS) and KTXA 21 (Ind) are based. That lab is chugging out special reports, investigative series, and consumer reports that are being aired across its entire group. However, it has also been used now for a new set of local newscasts that showed up back on July 18th, when it made its debut. These local newscasts go under CBS News (city/region name) NOW which is for CBS stations with a duopoly partner or (City/Region Name) NOW News for those CW or Independent stations that are alone and don’t have a duopoly partner.\n\nThese newscasts run under an hour-long format, seven nights a week at either 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. local time, depending on the market. The bulk of the newscast is national news and features that are produced out of the Lab and are anchored by Tom Hanson on weeknights and Trason Bragg on weekends. There are five-minute cut-ins for local news and weather at the top and bottom of the hour that is either anchored by the duopoly’s brother station or by a different station from hundreds, if not, thousands of miles away. There are also one, sometimes up to two, more local weather updates throughout the hour. They all follow the same format, meaning that it doesn’t break away to air more local news or weather or more local special reports.\n\nThe only markets that aren’t affected by this new format are Los Angeles (KCBS/KCAL), Chicago (WBBM), Minneapolis/St. Paul (WCCO), Denver (KCNC), Sacramento (KOVR/KMAX), Pittsburgh (KDKA/WPCW), and Baltimore (WJZ).\n\nBut the markets that are affected by this are as follows, and include the name of the newscast and the time it is on…\n\nWLNY Riverhead/New York City – CBS News New York NOW at 9:00 on WLNY-TV 10/55 – 9:00-10:00pm (replaces WCBS’ hour-long version)\n\nWPSG Philadelphia (also serving Allentown) – CBS News Philly NOW at 10:00 on The CW Philly 57 – 10:00-11:00pm (replaces KYW’s half-hour version)\n\nKTXA Fort Worth/Dallas – CBS News DFW NOW at 9:00 on TXA 21 – 9:00-10:00pm (KTXA’s first “local newscast” in 11 years)\n\nKBCW San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose – CBS News Bay Area NOW at 10:00 on KBCW – 10:00-11:00pm (KBCW’s first “local newscast” in 2 years)\n\nWSBK Boston – CBS News Boston NOW at 10:00 on TV38 – 10:00-11:00pm (yes, WBZ is still providing an hour-long weeknight 8:00pm newscast on WSBK)\n\nWUPA Atlanta – Atlanta NOW News at 10:00 on Atlanta’s CW 69 – 10:00-11:00pm (replaces the KTVT-produced effort)\n\nWTOG St. Petersburg/Tampa (also serving Sarasota) – Tampa Bay NOW News at 10:00 on CW 44 – 10:00-11:00pm (replaces the KTVT-produced effort)\n\nKSTW Tacoma/Seattle/Everett – Seattle NOW News at 10:00 on CW 11 – 10:00-11:00pm (KSTW’s first “local newscast” in 17 years)\n\nWKBD Detroit (also serving Ann Abror) – Detroit NOW News at 10:00 on CW 50 – 10:00-11:00pm (replaces the KTVT-produced effort)\n\nWBFS Miami/Fort Lauderdale – CBS News Miami NOW at 9:00 on TV33 – 9:00-10:00pm (WBFS’ first “local newscast” in 11 years)\n\nSo there’s that. Again, its an hour-long, seven nights a week.\n\nNext, CBS has been making another push lately as well and that is introducing a half-hour mid-morning newscast at 9:00am, as that trend seems to be capitalizing pretty well lately for local TV news across the country. What they’ve done was break up the hour-long format of their distributed syndicated daytime talk show The Drew Barrymore Show into two half-hour episodes, so that one could be aired right after their 9:00am news and another could be aired later on the same station during the overnight hours or on their duopoly sister station later in the afternoon.\n\nAgain, not all are taking part in this. Markets that will not see this are Los Angeles (KCBS/KCAL; since KCAL will be adding seven hours of morning news there in the fall), Atlanta (WUPA; no CBS O&O partner there), Tampa Bay (WTOG; no CBS O&O partner there), Seattle (KSTW; no CBS O&O partner there), Detroit (WWJ/WKBD; their news department is not yet ready for launch), Minneapolis/St. Paul (WCCO already has a 9am newscast), Sacramento (KOVR/KMAX; KMAX’s Good Day Sacramento from 4:30-11:00am is very popular), Pittsburgh (KDKA/WPCW; KDKA’s Pittsburgh Today LIVE already occupies it), and Baltimore (WJZ already has a 9am newscast).\n\nBut the ones who will launch a half-hour weekday morning newscast at 9:00am local time in their markets tomorrow, Monday, September 12th (as of the time this is posted) are as follows…\n\nWCBS New York (also on CBS News New York)\n\nWBBM Chicago (also on CBS News Chicago)\n\nKYW Philadelphia (also on CBS News Philadelphia)\n\nKTVT Fort Worth/Dallas (also on CBS News Dallas-Fort Worth)\n\nKPIX San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose (also on CBS News Bay Area)\n\nWBZ Boston (also on CBS News Boston)\n\nKCNC Denver (also on CBS News Colorado; I have mentioned this one already at least)\n\nWFOR Miami/Fort Lauderdale (also on CBS News Miami)\n\nAll will be airing at 9:00am on TV. Once that’s done and Drew Barrymore starts airing at 9:30am, those stations will stream an extra half-hour of local news and weather from 9:30-10:00am, streaming exclusively on their 24/7 streaming local news channels, which are mentioned above in parenthesis.\n\nSo… there you have it. You are now caught up with exactly what’s been going on within the CBS station group. I’m sorry if your market is not affected, but this is a big deal as CBS is trying to ramp up its local news units to not only try something different but also to get people to watch their local newscasts since most (not all) of their O&Os are struggling and continue to struggle in the ratings in their markets.\n\nWe’ll see how this fares, but for now, that’s what’s new around the world of CBS."
