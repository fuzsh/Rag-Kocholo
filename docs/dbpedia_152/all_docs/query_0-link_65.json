        "text": "Summary\n\nJeff Alldredge starred in Seeking Sister Wife for two seasons before leaving due to the show's direction.\n\nThe Alldredge family has kept a low profile since their time on the show, focusing on hobbies and family life.\n\nFans appreciated Jeff's approachable demeanor and emotional support for his wives, but also criticized his affinity for younger brides and friendship with Kody Brown.\n\nJeff Alldredge starred on the TLC show Seeking Sister Wife with his family, and fans are curious about what happened to him after season 2. Jeff's venture into numerous marriages ended in disappointment for the family, but the patriarch kept trying. The Alldredges were on the show for only two seasons, but they helped make the show as successful as it is today. Seeking Sister Wife season 1 premiered in January 2018, which means it was filmed in 2017. Season 2 aired in January 2019. The Alldredges were featured with two other families in season 1 and an additional two in season 2.\n\nSeeking Sister Wife season 5 recently finished airing and followed five couples. The returning families were the Merrifields and the Davis'. None of the couples from the original few seasons are still appearing on the show, but most of them have a social media presence. Seeking Sister Wife was such a popular show that it has an affiliated spinoff, Seeking Brother Husband. The Alldredges might not have been on the show recently, but since they had an interesting storyline, there would likely be a space for them on the show if they wanted to return.\n\nThe Alldredge Family Dynamic\n\nThey Were Controversial\n\nJeff and his family only starred in Seeking Sister Wife for two seasons, but their stints on the show turned out to be quite controversial. Fans learned that Jeff had two wives, Vanessa and Sharis Alldredge, whom he doted on. Sadly, after two seasons, Sharis revealed via a Facebook post that Jeff and the family were not filming for season 3 since they were no longer comfortable with the direction of the show.\n\nThe Alldredges claimed the series had become too sexualized. Since leaving the show, Jeff has jumped into a few hobbies. He has taken up fishing and woodworking and these hobbies help him to pass the time. Jeff has also taken up yoga, hoping to find inner peace.\n\nThey Have Back Off Social Media\n\nIn June of 2021, Jeff announced that his third marriage to Donna Alldredge had ended after only a year. Since then, they have started a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of their child custody battle. Jeff and the rest of his family have kept a relatively low profile since the divorce, and they explained that they needed some space and time. The Seeking Sister Wife family and Jeff have no plans to return to the show in the near future and live happily in South Dakota.\n\nJeff always seemed to understand the pros of leading a polygamist lifestyle and enjoys spending time with his large family. TLC viewers understand Jeff's decision to leave Seeking Sister Wife behind. One thing is for certain, which is that the patriarch is sure to keep the Alldredge family members headed in the right direction, towards their long-term goal of being one happy family. Jeff and his clan have not updated fans on their lives since that 2021 post about splitting with Donna.\n\nHow Was The Alldredge Family Perceived By Fans?\n\nJeff Got Mixed Reviews\n\nJeff is considered one of the favorites on the show, mainly because he has often kept his jealousy under control. Seeking Sister Wife fans enjoyed being able to see a more vulnerable man, rather than the other husbands, who seemed controlling. Jeff was very likable thanks to his approachable demeanor. Fans also appreciated the way that he put his emotions aside in order to do what was best for the family.\n\nJeff seemed to be emotionally available for his wives and always tried to do what was fair and reasonable.\n\nWhile there were a lot of redeeming qualities about Jeff and the polygamist relationship he had with his wives, viewers did have complaints about him too. He has been compared to Sister Wives star and well-known polygamist, Kody Brown. Many fans say that Jeff is actually not approachable, just like Kody. Moreover, fans took issue with Jeff's affinity for younger brides and his actual real-life friendship with Kody. Jeff also showed a moody side during the Tell All when he snapped at one of the producers.\n\nThe Alldredge family was one of the original clans of polygamists to star in Seeking Sister Wife season 1 (via TLC UK.) Even though Jeff was featured on a reality TV show, he has done very well in terms of keeping a low profile. Fans miss the charismatic yet controversial family because they brought a lot of entertainment value to the show.\n\nSeeking Sister Wife seasons 1-5 are available to stream on Discovery+."
