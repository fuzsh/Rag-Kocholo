        "text": "The old 590 was a blowtorch! With a daytime signal equal to 50,000 watt WSB it was the \"other\" decent Atlanta radio signal back in the day.\n\nThe night pattern was a screwball....but in areas where it put signal it \"peeled paint.\" There were areas that saw 25,000 watts(effectively) on night pattern - at 590 kHz.... that can really cut through the ether. But there were also major nulls - areas with minimal signal - WPLO was NOT a metro wide station at night.\n\nYou must also remember....back in those days, the FCC had not butchered the AM band. The interference was not nearly as bad as today. Even a relatively weak AM signal was usable on the regional channels back then - at least on the lower part of the dial.\n\nSummit effectively destroyed 590 in Atlanta when it moved to Powder Springs. The station's signal was designed for a African-American format and the directional lobes, day and night, were steered south of Atlanta. The 610 allocation in Grayson(Gwinnette County)eliminated any possibility of a move back into town for 590.\n\nkyscott said:\n\nDoes anyone have a copy of the day/night pattern for PLO? I'd be interested in seeing it. I remember living in NE Atlanta and taking Clairmont road to work and passing the old site when they were demolishing it. Sure wish now I had taken time to go in the building.\n\n\"The Widow's Son\" posted that a few months ago. Maybe you can find it by looking a past posts. I think the site was actually on N. Druid Hills; an apartment complex is there now.\n\nRoddyFreeman said:\n\nkyscott said:\n\nDoes anyone have a copy of the day/night pattern for PLO? I'd be interested in seeing it.

Druid Hills; an apartment complex is there now.\n\nNo, it was definitely on Clairmont about a mile south of 85. I think 103.3 WPLO FM was there as well.\n\nConfirmed, N Druid Hills Rd was the site. WPLO was on one of the towers churning out 100kw from a few hundred feet---pre 80-90---interestingly, the reports of WPLO/WVEE on the old (lower site) vs the new (higher site) seem to indicate that the older site gets out as well as the new site...again thats before the FM band became AM-ized.\n\nThe main reason the new site was built was the new FCC rule that FM's had to be at 1,000 or more feet to remain a full C (and retain their value). That was sometime around 1990. I believe Summit (former 103.3 owner) built the site. Additionally, WSTR moved there from the Peachtree Plaza, WSB-FM relocated there from the WSB-TV tower, and WABE moved there from (I'm guessing) Bismarck Road. WZGC remained under 1,000 feet at the Peachtree Plaza.\n\nYears ago, I was told by someone at WABE that ownership would revert from CBS to the Atlanta Board of Education at some point; don't know if that's true or ever happened.\n\nRe: WABE and New Street Tower\n\nRoddyFreeman said:\n\nThe main reason the new site was built was the new FCC rule that FM's had to be at 1,000 or more feet to remain a full C (and retain their value).

I remember reading it was a disaster.\n\nIf WABE gets ownership of the New Street site, then all commercial broadcasters (WSTR/WSB-FM/WVEE) will have to move per FCC rules (from what I understand, owners of NCE stations that own NCE sites can only lease space to NCE stations).\n\nThe school board now owns New Street - the agreement transfered ownership to city after 20 years - that happened just recently. WVEE, WSTR, and WSB-FM still operate from the site. Channel 30 analog is on the top but WABE has an app to move to the top when analog TV goes away next year. WABE and Channel 30 digital operate from a 800 foot tower adjacent to the big 1000 foot tower.\n\nThere is no problem with a non comm being on a commercial station's tower or visa versa.\n\nWABE was on top of Stone Mountain for many years - over 10 - and only came off the mountain a couple of years back. They had a aux site at New Street but it was not full power.\n\nThe signal was terrible from the mountain - over a million dollars was spent on consultants trying to figure out the problem. I don't think there was ever a definative answer -Channel 8, also located on St Mountain, has a terrible signal too. Ham operators have noted strange ether around the mountain for years - I'm not sure what the physics are."
