I think they all 3 are sorry excuses for a tv station.\n\nBut I do watch Antenna TV on 36.3 quite a bit.\n\nJan 15, 2012\n\n#2\n\nI watch reruns of the Simpsons and SouthPark on WATL and Family Guy, American Dad and My Name Is Earl on WPCH and that is it. I watch absolutely nothing on WUPA.\n\nSo I suppose I watch WUPA the least\n\nJan 15, 2012\n\n#3\n\nI least watch CW69/WUPA. Once UPN died a lot of African American shows were dropped from WUPA. I watch MyATL 36 sometimes when Im off during the daytime to laugh at Jerry Springer, Maury, Steve and Cheaters. Peachtree TV I only watch for In The Heat of The Night at 9am and Tyler Perry show."
