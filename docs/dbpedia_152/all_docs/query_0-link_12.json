        "text": "I suspect they are, too - you'll be having co-son and co-son's mate next!\n\nSeriously, you are talking about in-laws here.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nA brother-in-law (plural brothers-in-law) is the brother of one's spouse, the husband of one's sibling, the husband of one's spouse's sibling [relevant in the first case you mention], or the brother of one's sibling's spouse.\n\nYou can work out what sister-in-law covers.\n\nOh, and the perhaps unfamiliar terms used by Wikipedia:\n\nsibling - a brother or sister\n\nspouse - a husband or wife\n\n... that is, they are hypernyms (like cutlery for knives, forks, ...)\n\nNo, there is no word for it in English.\n\nI disagree with Edwin Ashworth and the Wikipedia article he quotes (which is entirely unreferenced). I would neither use nor normally understand brother-in-law to include a wife's sister's husband in modern English.\n\nI would not be surprised to come across that usage in older writing (before the 20th century): many kinship terms were formerly used less precisely than today.\n\nThe OED says \"Sometimes extended to the husband of one's wife's (or husband's) sister\", but that entry has not been revised since 1888.\n\nIt is strange, and sometimes inconvenient, that there is no word.\n\nsibling-in-law\n\nThat is the word you are looking for; because brother-in-law is strictly used for brothers of spouse I present this variation in this part of the world.\n\nBit of context, in India we are very precise with relationship. And so brother-in-law cannot replace cousin-in-law; this word co-brother came into existence to denote the person marries sister of the wife (being gender neutral is tough).\n\nReference :\n\nhttps://xkcd.com/2040/\n\nhttp://www.yourdictionary.com/sibling-in-law\n\nThe answer to this can be viewed from a logic process. The sibling of a spouse is by relation the brother or sister of the spouse, and by marital assignment the brother or sister - in - law to the spouses marriage partner. The spouse of one of those siblings can not accurately be given the term brother or sister in law as well, as the terminology usage creates a brother / sister relationship to the spouses sibling and their respective marital partner."
