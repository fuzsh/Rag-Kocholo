It's one that I've had for a very long time. My wife's sister came to live with us, and I got along with her very well, and when I wasn't working, we spent a lot of time together. We had a lot in common, which led to me actually falling for her.\n\nI doubt that she feels the same way, and I never told her or anyone about it, but that doesn't make it any less of a problem. I know it has affected my marriage, but I just can't find a way to fall out of love with either one.\n\nShe hasn't lived with us for a long time now, but she's still with us even though she's not living with us. I try to go on as though nothing is wrong, but I know it would be better if I could erase it from my mind, but I guess it's going to be here until I'm gone.\n\nGET THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS HERE -- SIGN UP FOR GOLOCAL FREE DAILY EBLAST\n\nShould I tell my wife? -- Life Problems\n\nDear Life Problems: You didn't specify how your marriage was affected by your crush on your wife's sister. The truth is you are allowed to be friends with your sister-in-law and get along with her, but while you are married, you are not allowed to act on it. Ask yourself why you felt so attracted to your sister-in-law instead of your wife. Sometimes when there are problems, it is easier to fantasize about what life with another would be like, when in reality that is just a fantasy and real life is passing you by. Seek the help of a professional marriage counselor to help you and your wife.\n\nDear Annie: Thank you so much for printing the letter from \"Hungry Pets.\" I applaud her suggestions and was grateful for your response. I just wanted to add one or two absolutely crucial suggestions.\n\nIn cold climates, the warmth of a hot car engine is irresistible to a freezing and hungry animal, and I think just how often this leads to a situation beyond horrific would shock people.\n\nPlease, please, to all who read this and love animals, just bang on your hood three times before you start your car in the morning.\n\nMy second suggestion: whether you recycle or not, please crush any metal cans that have had food in them, and if possible, put the lids back on plastic containers. An animal with its head trapped in a can will die a terrible death, just for the crime of being hungry, and this also happens more frequently than anyone can know.\n\nThank you for your time and for all the good you do, Annie. -- Hit the Hood\n\nDear Hit the Hood: Thank you for your letter. These are two wonderful suggestions to help our animal friends, especially during the colder months.\n\nDear Annie: Coping With Unseen Challenges\n\nDear Annie: Mother’s Secret Still Weighs on Me\n\nDear Annie: Other Solutions to a Potential Stalker\n\nDear Annie: Navigating Family Bonds With Care and Concern\n\nDear Annie: Unsettled by Friend’s Mid-Divorce Behavior\n\nDear Annie: Sobriety Success Story\n\nDear Annie: Bad Manners at Home\n\nDear Annie: How Can I Connect With My Estranged Children?\n\nDear Annie: Gifting Gone Wrong\n\nDear Annie: Repairing Family After a Messy Divorce\n\nDear Annie: What Should I Do About My Marriage Which Is Becoming Toxic?\n\nDear Annie: Seeking Harmony in the Household\n\nDear Annie: Family Strains and Friend Flakes\n\nDear Annie: When the Spark of Love Dies Out\n\nDear Annie: Mother-in-Law Longs for Order\n\nDear Annie: Are My Hygiene Standards Really Too High?\n\nDear Annie: Balancing Family Loyalties\n\nDear Annie: Balancing Boundaries and Support\n\nDear Annie: Family Wounds and Forgiveness\n\nDear Annie: Navigating Marriage 30 Years In\n\nDear Annie: Desperate to Decode This Dating Dilemma\n\nDear Annie: Unable to Buzz My Babysitter\n\nDear Annie: Bride Gets Giddy Over Wedding Gift\n\nDear Annie: Feeling Like I’m Falling Short\n\nDear Annie: Falling for Wife’s Sister\n\nEnjoy this post?
