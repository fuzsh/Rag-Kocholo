        "text": "dbo:abstract\n\nWUPA (channel 69) is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, affiliated with The CW. The station is owned by the CBS News and Stations group, and maintains studios on Northeast Expressway (I-85) in unincorporated DeKalb County (with an Atlanta mailing address); its transmitter is located near Shepherds Lane and Arnold Avenue in the Woodland Hills section of northeastern Atlanta (near North Druid Hills). Channel 69 in Atlanta first began broadcasting in 1981 as WVEU. Years of technical issues provoked by interference to mobile radio users and consequent limitations on the station's operating hours and signal strength contributed to the failure of subscription television (STV) and a music video service that operated the station. WVEU's local founders sold the station to CBS in 1994 at a time when CBS needed to find a new affiliate in Atlanta, but the network was able to negotiate to affiliate with another, more built-up station instead. WVEU became an affiliate of UPN and was then sold to the Paramount Stations Group, which substantially improved the station's programming and ratings in the years that followed before UPN was replaced with The CW in 2006. In addition to a hybrid local/national 10 p.m. newscast, WUPA is the preseason television home of Atlanta Falcons football.

At the same time, we never make a purchase for which we don't know how we are going to pay. We have almost no debt. (en)"
