        "text": "This is interesting that CBS New York offices do a newscast for Atlanta under the Atlanta News Now name while their news staff also do the CBS New York Newscasts on WCBS and WLNY. This is like when KSTW aired the Seattle News Now but their news staff is from KPIX/KPYX San Francisco whose other roles were to anchor the CBS Bay Area Newscasts on KPIX.\n\nIMHO The only reason CBS owns 69 is \"insurance\" in case something happens to 46. They lost 5 when Fox bought it. Atlanta has 17 and 36 to pick up shows that could not make one of the top 4 networks and reruns so it never will be major player. But it is a good place to \"test\" news reading talent.\n\nIMHO The only reason CBS owns 69 is \"insurance\" in case something happens to 46. They lost 5 when Fox bought it.

IIRC \"Storrer\" (spelling?) went bankrupt and Fox picked up the pieces which included Channel 5 here in the ATL. IMHO As long as the cash flow is positive they should keep it in case something goes wrong with Gray.\n\nAt what point does CBS give up. it’s been many years and nothing has happened to CBS 46 yet\n\nSince Gray took over lots of things has happened. Gray is waaaay invested in ANF aka CBS 46. Sadly i don't know if ratings have changed since everyone only watches WSB and FOX 5\n\nSince Gray took over lots of things has happened.

It is IMHO on par with Fox 5. I believe Gray's home office is in Atlanta so I can only guess they will spend the money to have a good newscast in their \"home market\".\n\nWith the rumor of CBS being bought another OTA network shuffle is possible."
