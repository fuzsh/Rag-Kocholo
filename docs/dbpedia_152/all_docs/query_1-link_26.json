        "text": "April 26, 2015\n\nMonday, April 27, 2015 UPDATE:\n\nTwo items in this morning’s UPDATE…a new ND and the winners of regional Edward R. Murrow Awards.\n\nFirst, a long vacant ND opening in the number one market has been filled by an internal promotion.\n\nAMY WALDMAN has been named news director of Tribune’s WPIX-TV in New York. She’s been at this CW affiliate for more than eight years and has served as Senior Executive Producer for more than a year. She’s also worked at Court TV, CNBC, and Fox News Channel, as well as in Buffalo and Erie, PA.\n\nHere’s the memo from GM RICH GRAZIANO to the staff.\n\nAmy replaces MARK EFFRON who left the station last fall after about 18 months as ND.\n\nAlso, we accidentally omitted the latest regional Murrow Award winners in this week’s newsletter. Here’s the news release, which includes a link to the winners broken down by region.\n\nHave a great week…and we’ll be back this weekend with our full list of news management changes.\n\nRick Gevers\n\n**** ***** ****\n\nGreetings:\n\n27 stations, by our unofficial count, are looking for news directors after this week’s changes. Those include TWO new openings and TWO newly named news directors.\n\nTHREE of those openings are featured in paid ads below. And there’s an ad for a new corporate news executive position for a large broadcast company…all below.\n\nThe Peabody Awards were announced this week. Just one local, commercial station was honored (along with a DC bureau for a big group broadcaster). That information is below, along with some news about news managers, including the retirement of a former ND who’s spent almost 50 years with the same station.\n\nAll that…and more…as you read on.\n\nNew News Director Openings:\n\nWBNS-TV, Columbus, OH…as we told you earlier this week, ELBERT TUCKER is leaving this Dispatch owned CBS affiliate to become ND for WISH-TV in Indianapolis.

Elbert worked in management positions at WKRC for more than eight years before ascending to the ND job. He’s also worked in Birmingham and Chattanooga. WISH posted this story on its website. Elbert’s memo to his staff…and WBNS GM JOHN CARDENAS’s note to the station, are here. He replaces STEVE BRAY who spent 2 1/2 of his 20 years at the station as ND.\n\nWXII-TV, Winston-Salem, NC…22 year station employee LISA FULK has been promoted to News Director for this Hearst-owned NBC affiliate. She joined WXII in 1993 as a production assistant, later moved to the news department on the assignment desk. She later became a producer. Lisa became the Digital Executive Producer before being named Assistant ND in 2012. This story on the station’s website has more details. Lisa replaces BARRY KLAUS who left in March for a family business in New York after eleven years as ND.\n\nBy the way, we heard this week from LENA SADIWSKYJ.

And TWO stations in Ft. Wayne are also looking for NDs.\n\nJust thought that was interesting. You probably didn’t.\n\nSadly, we also have TWO obituaries of legendary broadcasters who may not be well known to newer journalists but both had big impacts on our business. And we have several items in Names in the News, including management hires in Miami Phoenix, and Austin, TX, and an honor for a longtime newsman who’s also had a big impact on TV news.\n\nAll that and more below.\n\nNew News Director Openings:\n\nKRNV-TV, Reno, NV…MATT McCONICO has left Sinclair’s NBC affiliate in what the locals call the “Biggest Little City in the World.” He’s been the ND here for more than four years and had been the Assistant ND before his promotion.

Jack’s worked here for ten years, first as a producer, then EP, before a promotion two years ago to Assistant News Director. He’s also worked for another Houston station and in New York. At KENS, he replaces TRISTON SANDERS who left the station earlier this year (after two years as ND) to become a consultant for Magid.\n\nWBIR-TV, Knoxville, TN…Gannett has also promoted Assistant News Director MARTHA JENNINGS to news director for this NBC affiliate. She’s been the AND there since last November. Martha earlier worked as the Nightside EP for WFLA-TV in Tampa, and has also worked as a producer in Raleigh and Charleston, SC. At WBIR, she replaces CHRISTY MORENO who left a few months ago (after 2+ years here) to become ND for sister station KUSA-TV in Denver.\n\nWVLT-TV, Knoxville, TN…TONY BERNHARDT has been named news director for this Gray TV owned CBS affiliate. Tony’s currently the Assistant News Director for WTNH-TV in New Haven/Hartford, CT. He’s also worked in Washington, DC, Tampa, Orlando, and Colorado Springs. At WVLT, he will replace LENA SADIWSKYJ who’s been the news director here for the last four years. Lena will leave the station after the May book.\n\nWVLA/WGMB-TV, Baton Rouge, LA…GARY WORDLAW returns to a newsroom as the news director for this NBC/FOX duopoly operated by Nexstar. Gary’s been an ND in Washington and Baltimore, and a general manager in Seattle, New Orleans, Syracuse, and Tallahassee. He’s also worked in Chattanooga.

He was 87. Many of you didn’t know Bill, but he had two very different careers. First as an anchor and reporter in New Orleans, where he once interviewed LEE HARVEY OSWALD a few months before the JFK assassination. He later became a talent scout for NBC. In the pre-videotape (and, obviously, pre-internet world) he travelled the country meeting with NBC news directors to ask about good talent in their market. More in this story.\n\nLegendary photographer DARREL BARTON died Wednesday after a brief illness. He was 73.

I hope to see many of you here.\n\nRTDNA is sponsoring a (very) informal gathering on Tuesday night, beginning at 9:00 PM at the Parasol Down bar at the Wynn Hotel and Casino. That’s the night before the ‘RTDNA @ NAB’ seminar which will take place on Wednesday. I hope to see you there.\n\nTurning to our normal business, not much activity this week, with ONE news director departure announced, and TWO ND jobs filled (one with an asterisk!), with another consolidated with a sister station.\n\nThose changes mean 27 stations are now looking for NDs.\n\nWe have TWO new help wanted ads for a total of FOUR ads for different jobs in a wide range of markets ranging from coast-to-coast.\n\nIn addition, TWO of the advertisers that help support this newsletter will be exhibiting at the NAB conference.

He’s been the ND for 2 1/2 years, and held several management positions before moving into the ND job. Steve oversaw news expansion earlier this year after the station lost its CBS affiliation and linked up with the CW network, He first joined the station as the weekend meteorologist, was promoted to Chief Meteorologist four years later, and maintained the title even though he rarely appeared on air over the last few years. The Indianapolis Business Journal has more. Steve’s also worked in Mobile, Lake Charles, and Decatur.\n\nSpeaking of Indiana ND openings, please note the new ad below for the opening in Ft. Wayne.

Rey has an extensive background, much of it in Spanish language stations in large markets. It’s all detailed here in his Linkedin page. But 30 years ago he worked as a director for KTSM. He replaces LAUREN MACIAS-CERVANTES who left the station last month after more than four years as ND.\n\nWEAU-TV, Eau Claire, WI...I think that ANDREW FEFER has been promoted to news director here. After all, that’s what his bio on the station website says. Being old-fashioned, I emailed him to confirm his promotion and to ask when it had happened. His response: “I’m sorry, but I have no comment.” O-kay. He did give me the phone number for the GM, who I’m guessing isn’t in on Sunday. If in fact the station’s website is correct, Andrew replaces MIKE LOPEZ who was there about two years. Andrew’s also worked in Wausau and Green Bay. WEAU is an NBC affiliate owned by Gray Television.\n\nAlso, please note that we’ve removed the NE opening for WDAZ-TV in Grand Forks, ND from our list of openings.

He just led the news department through an affiliation change: WISH lost its CBS partnership at the end of 2014 and is now a CW affiliate.\n\nAnd his background is different than most: he first joined the station 20 years ago as a meteorologist and was promoted to Chief Meteorologist four years later, a title he’s held even while serving as ND. His Linkedin page has the whole story.\n\nSteve told me he’s going to take the next few weeks to decompress and figure out the ‘next chapter’.\n\nMore on this…and all the latest news…in our full newsletter later this week.\n\nI’ll be in Las Vegas for NAB and hope to see many of you there.\n\nregards,\n\nRick Gevers\n\n**** ***** ****\n\nGreetings:\n\nThis week’s newsletter comes from our home office in Indianapolis, just 1.25 miles from Lucas Oil Stadium, home of tomorrow night’s basketball championship game. Not sure if I’m going yet, but I did go last night, and the second game was pretty exciting.\n\nPerhaps not quite as exciting, unless you’re one of the people involved, are the TWO newly named news directors in this week’s newsletter, or the THREE people who’re moving on, including the retirement of a long-time Indiana news director.\n\nThose changes mean 28 stations are now looking for NDs.\n\nWe have TWO new paid help wanted ads, among a total of FOUR ads this week.\n\nThe Scripps/Journal merger is complete, and that means a shuffle of regional managers and THREE new GMs at the company’s stations. CBS is moving one of its o-and-o GMs to a new market, and Nexstar is promoting one of its GMs. Those stories are below, along with news about a former Macon News Director who’s been named Dean of the the University of Missouri School of Journalism.\n\nNew News Director Openings:\n\nWSMV-TV, Nashville, TN…after 8 1/2 years as ND for this Meredith owned NBC affiliate, MATTHEW HILK has left the station. His actual title was Director of News and Creative Services. Before moving to Music City, Matthew was the assistant news director for stations in Pittsburgh and Birmingham, a producer in Orlando, and a reporter in Louisville, Charleston, WV, and Oak Hill, WV.\n\nKTNV, Las Vegas, NV…we told you earlier this week that KARIN MOVESIAN was leaving this now owned by Scripps ABC affiliate for a new job in St. Louis. More on that below. Karin was the ND here for almost eight years.\n\nWPTA/WISE-TV, Ft. Wayne, IN…longtime news director PETER NEUMANN will retire at the end of May after 31 1/2 consecutive years as a news director at just two stations. He’s been at the helm of this duopoly for 9 1/2 years, spent 21+ years running the news department of WEAR-TV in Pensacola, and two years at KOLR-TV in Springfield, MO. Peter’s also worked in Phoenix, Indianapolis, Alpena, MI, and Muncie, IN, where he attended Ball State University. He sent this nice note to his staff. Granite owns WPTA and runs WISE, (owned by Malara Broadcasting), and Quincy is in the process of buying them.\n\nNewly Named News Directors:\n\nKSDK-TV, St. Louis, MO…KARIN MOVESIAN returns to her home market as the next ND here. (She’s a native of nearby Belleville, IL, and once worked at KMOV-TV here). Karin returns home from Las Vegas, where she’s spent the last eight years as ND for KTNV-TV. She’s also worked in Chicago (two stations), Detroit, Minneapolis, and San Antonio. Karin will replace MIKE SHIPLEY who will retire (from KSDK, not from working) once she’s settled. Mike’s been ND almost 15 years, and first joined the station in 1981 when I hired him as the night assignment editor. KSDK is an NBC affiliate owned by Gannett.\n\nKECI/KCFW/KTVM-TV, (NBC Montana), Missoula, MT…JULIE WEINDEL returns to the ND chair to run this Bonten Media cluster of NBC affiliates. She’s been the Assistant ND here for the past six months, and has been an ND in Boise and Dayton. Julie’s also worked in Cincinnati and Tulsa. GM DICK REINGOLD (who’s being promoted to GM of the company’s WCTI-TV in New Bern, NC) sent this message to the staff. Julie replaces CHRIS GROGAN who’s been named Assistant ND for WSYX/WTTE-TV in Columbus, OH.\n\nPaid Help Wanted Ads:\n\nAssistant News Director, KHOU-TV, Houston, TX:\n\nThis is a great opportunity to join a newsroom in a Top 10 market.\n\nHouston is a culturally diverse city that has a lot to offer.
