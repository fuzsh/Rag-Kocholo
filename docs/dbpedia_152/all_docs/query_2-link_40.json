Therefore, I wanted to apply a the ceiling function to all cells that end in .(somenumber+)5 before doing a general round().\n\nI don't know how to specify that as a shell expression to glob2rx so it will make the adequate regular expression, but I inferred it had to be something like this:\n\ngrx <- \"^\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+5$\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be getting any of the cells when I do grep(grx, x=matrix.1, value=TRUE).\n\nWhat could be wrong?\n\nThanks!
