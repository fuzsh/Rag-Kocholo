        "text": "More than a decade after polygamist Kody Brown first landed on TV screens declaring he felt love should be \"multiplied, not divided,\" the Sister Wives star is dealing with some subtractions.\n\nWhen the reality series premiered on TLC in September 2010, viewers were introduced to Kody, a former firearms salesman his three wives—Meri, Janelle and Christine—and the soon-to-be-fourth spouse he was courting. After 16 years of life as a quartet, each of the three women struggled with the transition as the family uprooted themselves from their joint home in Utah amid fears of being prosecuted for bigamy to a shared cul-de-sac in Las Vegas and, eventually, their current landing spot in Flagstaff, Ariz., where they dreamed of building on a piece of land dubbed Coyote Pass.\n\nNow, 13 years, 17 seasons, 18 children and one catfishing scandal later, Robyn is the only wife still looking to build a future with the curly-haired patriarch. Since November 2021, Meri, Janelle and Christine have all ended their romances with the 53-year-old, with fans getting a front-row seat to all of the drama on their longrunning reality series.\n\nMeri\n\nRaised in a polygamous family with 27 siblings, Meri was 18 years old when she met Kody at church.\n\n\"I was a little taken with Kody right off the bat,\" Meri wrote in the family's 2012 book, Becoming Sister Wives. \"He was definitely cute, and had a great attitude. He was talkative and engaged me in conversation, and made me feel comfortable around him.\" Kody was every bit as all-in, adding, \"I had a sneaking suspicion that we were soulmates.\"\n\nJanelle\n\nAs if polygamous marriage isn't complicated enough, Janelle was in the process of a \"horrible divorce\" from her first husband—who just so happened to be Meri's brother—when she met Kody in 1989. She even attended Kody and Meri's wedding with Adam. (Oh, and to add to the family ties: Janelle's mother Sheryl eventually became the third wife of Winn Brown, Kody's father.)\n\nWriting that she had \"the strangest feeling,\" when she first connected with Kody, Janelle shared in Becoming Sister Wives, \"I felt as if I had forgotten something and suddenly remembered it. It was a feeling of relief and recognition.\"\n\nAfter her divorce in 1993, Janelle went on just one date with Kody before the pair got spiritually married two weeks later. Together, they went on to have six children: 28-year-old son Logan, 27-year-old daughter Maddie, 25-year-old son Hunter, 24-year-old son Garrison, 21-year-old son Gabriel and 18-year-old daughter Savanah.\n\nAnd Janelle made it clear that it wasn't love that was making her question her decision to leave Kody, but \"duty.\" Still, she admitted she was \"so mad about what's happened with our kids\" that she is \"losing respect\" for her former husband. Among her chief complaints: His decision to spend most of his time with Robyn and her kids, who he felt were strictly following his COVID protocols.\n\n\"I think that if he had truly been watching out for me and my children,\" Janelle said, \"he would have figured out a way to make it work for the whole family instead of having his rules and hanging out with the wife staying where he was respected and obeyed.\"\n\nFor Kody, he insisted he \"absolutely\" wanted to work things out with his second wife, but said he \"won't go to a place that I'm not respected,\" despite still loving Janelle.\n\nChristine\n\nJust one year after he wed Janelle, Kody also spiritually married Christine, who was raised in a polygamous household and met Kody and Meri when she was 19. The couple went on to have six children together: Aspyn, 27; Mykelti, 26; Paedon, 24; Gwendlyn, 20; Ysabel, 19 and Truely, 12.\n\n\"Her kindness and her positive nature brokered a peace in our household,\" Kody wrote in the family's memoir of the 50-year-old's arrival. \"Christine saved our bacon, as I like to say. She saved the Browns.\"\n\nBut, decades later, Christine was the first wife to walk away, confirming her split from Kody in November 2021.\n\nIn part two of the Sister Wives: One on One special, which aired in December 2022, the former couple reflected on the dissolution of their relationship, with Christine addressing Kody's past comments about no longer being physically attracted to her.\n\n\"To hear that he wasn't attracted to me, it was terrible to hear,\" Christine admitted. \"And it's super embarrassing right? Ugh. I just got to thinking, 'You know what? It really just goes both ways.'\"\n\nDespite years of struggle, that was the moment she knew their marriage was over."
