Tune in anytime for uninterrupted live programming, airing 24/7, on Streetz 94.5.\n\nW233BF Radio, 94.5 FM is a radio station in metro Atlanta, now licensed to serve Atlanta owned by Edgewater Broadcasting. After a series of moves (previously serving the eastern exurb of Social Circle), the station now transmits from the WUPA tower east of downtown, just north of Interstate 20. The station broadcasts an urban contemporary music format, with a heavy emphasis on local artists, and is less mainstream than other similar stations in the format such as WHTA and WVEE."
