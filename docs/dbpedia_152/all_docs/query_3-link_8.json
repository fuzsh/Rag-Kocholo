Tim Walz is the current governor of Minnesota, and the VP's pick has many left wondering, \"Who is this guy?\"The V-103 News team has compiled some quick facts so that you can get a head start on learning more about one of this year's vice presidential candidates.

Check out some of the pictures from the event below!\n\nFor the past couple of weeks The People Station V-103 has been promoting the Summer Skool Vol. 1 Black Party.

There will be discussions on violence, gang prevention, and what to do if you're stopped by the police.\n\nThe Back to school season is upon us and The People Station V-103 is here to support parent, students and teachers all school year long. We've shown up at the Back to School events, and all week long superintendents from Metro Atlanta school districts will be on to give parents and teacher pertinent information for the upcoming school year.\n\nBy As we move closer and closer to the presidential election, V-103 wants to make sure you have everything you need to make your voice heard.

I'm talkin' about huntin' Vettes, Lambos, even McLarens!Yes...give me a more neutral color than the \"Arrest Me Orange\" that we had on our test IONIQ 5 N, and turn me loose! This is one serious machine. Perhaps one of the fastest all-electric vehicles on the road today."
