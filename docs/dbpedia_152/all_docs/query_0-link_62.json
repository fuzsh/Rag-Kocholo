        "text": "Lifetime is bolstering its roster of “Ripped From the Headlines” movies for the summer.\n\nThe cable network will air a pair of true-crime movies in July: Amish Affair is set to premiere on July 6, and Sister Wife Murder will follow a week later. They join a “Ripped From the Headlines” summer lineup that also includes June premieres for The Girl Locked Upstairs: The Tanya Kach Story; Gaslit by My Husband: The Morgan Metzer Story; Yoga Teacher Killer: The Kaitlin Armstrong Story; Danger in the Dorm; Devil on Campus: The Larry Ray Story; and The Killer Inside: The Ruth Finley Story.\n\nAmish Affair stars Mackenzie Cardwell (Upload) as Hannah, a young woman who is brought into the home of Aaron (Ryan McPartlin, Chuck and Lifetime’s The Holiday Fix Up), a charismatic Amish leader, to help care for his ailing wife. She has a spark with Aaron but knows their secret relationship means they’re both living in sin. When Aaron’s wife dies under suspicious circumstances, Hannah is framed for murder and fights to prove her innocence.\n\nMuse Entertainment produces the film, with Jesse Prupas and Chris Wade serving as executive producers along with McPartlin. Robin Hays directs from a script by James Phillips.\n\nSister Wife Murder centers on Chloe (Dia Nash), who attends church for the first time and is immediately drawn to the pastor, Caleb (Matthew Daddario). She falls in love with him, only to discover that he is married — to two women, Anna (Ashley Williams) and Margo (Ashley Dulaney). She’s nonetheless thrilled when he proposes, but soon comes to experience his controlling behavior. When one of the other wives mysteriously disappears, Chloe fears that she may be next.\n\nPeter Sullivan wrote Sister Wife Murder, and Manu Boyer directs and executive produces. The film is produced by Hybrid (Lifetime’s The Wrong … movies)."
