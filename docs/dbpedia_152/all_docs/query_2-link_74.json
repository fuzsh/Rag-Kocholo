The three radio stations' transmitters are diplexed together, so that they all feed to the antenna instead of into each other.\n\nHistory\n\nThe station that became \"V-103\" began back in the late 1940s as WAGA-FM, on 102.9 with a country music format. It was originally co-owned by Storer Broadcasting with WAGA-AM (now WYZE) and television station WAGA-TV channel 5, a CBS-turned FOX affiliate.\n\nWAGA-FM became WPLO-FM when it moved to 103.3 and simulcasted WPLO AM. They maintained the country format, but with many top-40 cuts. WPLO-FM was operated by Georgia State University students during the late 1960s before WRAS FM 88.5 signed on. WPLO-FM was its previous callsign, as both stations were owned by Plough Broadcasting which later became Schering-Plough Broadcasting.\n\nIn 1968, WPLO-FM changed its format from top-40 to hard rock. WPLO-FM then changed its format from rock to country music once again. In 1976, 103.3 changed call letters and formats from WPLO-FM country to WVEE-FM urban contemporary and began using the \"V-103\" moniker. It briefly aired a Disco format in the late 1970s\n\nIn the early 1980s, DKM Broadcasting Corporation purchased WVEE-FM and sister station WAOK. On January 1, 1988, WVEE was sold, along with other DKM-owned properties in Denver, Baltimore, Springfield, Lincoln, Akron, Dayton and Dallas, for $200,000,000 to The Summit Communications Group, Inc. In March 1995, Summit sold its interests in WVEE FM and WAOK AM to Granum Communications, Inc. (Herbert W. McCord, Peter Ferrara, and Michael Weinstein). In March 1996, Granum Communications sold both to Infinity Broadcasting.\n\nIn 2000, \"V-103\" after many years of operating as an urban contemporary station that only played R&B and classic soul added hip hop full-time to compete with Radio One's WHTA (\"Hot 97.5\", now \"Hot 107.9\") in addition to direct competitor Cox's WALR-FM (\"Kiss 104.7\", now \"Kiss 104.1\", which also added more current R&B songs) and to appeal more to the precious 18-34 demographic. In 2003, \"V-103\" changed its longtime station slogan from \"The People's Station\" to \"Atlanta's BIG Station\" to signify its dominance of Atlanta urban radio and being #2 (now #1) overall behind radio market leader WSB AM. Recently it reverted back to the previous slogan \"The People's Station\" to signify its commitment to the community.\n\nSince Fall 2006, V-103 has premiered a HD Radio frequency for playing Urban Adult Contemporary music.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* V-103 was mentioned in the 1998 movie \"The Players Club\" directed by hip-hop rapper/actor Ice Cube.\n\nThe Frank and Wanda TV Show\n\nV103.com and local Atlanta brodcaster WUPA have teaming to bring Atlanta the Frank and Wanda Television Show. On the show, viewers can actually watch the personalties and their guest discussing some prominent topics and issues from the morning brodcast. Celebrities that have been on the show so far include: Rapper Young Jeezy, Comedian Joe Clair, TV Judge Penny Brown-Reynolds and more.\n\nTypically, the show deals with a prominent topic or guest each episode and the last ten minutes of the episode are usually reserved for Girl Talk with Miss Sophia and Frank Ski's Inspirational Vitamin, although Girl Talk segment isn't present in every episode.\n\nThe theme song is performed by singer Monica.\n\nThe show airs Monday through Friday at 11:00pm on the CW Atlanta (WUPA).\n\nExternal links"
