        "text": "Summary\n\nRoberta damaged Garrick and Dannielle's marriage - she was the reason for their divorce.\n\nGarrick and Roberta's relationship seemed to be thriving, hinting that Roberta replaced Dannielle.\n\nRoberta and Garrick are no longer together, and Garrick is now courting new women. He and Dannielle welcomed a third child.\n\nRoberta Pache had an eventful run in Seeking Sister Wife seasons 3 and 4 as she tried to join Garrick and Dannielle Merrifield's marriage, but what happened to Roberta after season 4? Roberta did her best to get along with both Garrick and Dannielle during their time together in Seeking Sister Wife, but ever since the polygamous family stopped filming, the plural marriage has fallen apart. From her burgeoning relationship with Garrick and his sons to her role in Danielle's departure, here's everything Roberta's been up to since Seeking Sister Wife season 4.\n\nAfter over a decade of marriage, Garrick decided that he wanted to transform his monogamous relationship with his wife, Dannielle, into a polygamous one. Garrick shared that this sudden change in direction came to him when he discovered that polygamists were mentioned in the bible. While Garrick's religious logic was odd, Dannielle reluctantly agreed to polygamy and her husband's quest for another wife. Garrick soon shared that he had been talking to Roberta, who was interested in joining their marriage.\n\nRoberta's Journey On Seeking Sister Wife\n\nShe Was Introduced In Season 3\n\nRoberta entered the Seeking Sister Wife scene during season 3. Garrick and Dannielle decided after 11 years in a monogamous relationship that they wanted to explore polygamy and soon found Roberta on a polygamy dating site in 2019. The couple flew down to Mexico to meet Roberta and agreed to move forward with their plural relationship. After getting to know her and falling for her, Garrick proposed to Roberta, and she said yes. Not too long after the proposal, Garrick and Dannielle legally divorced, as this was the only way Roberta could receive a K-1 visa in the U.S.\n\nRoberta is the reason The Merrifields got divorced.\n\nRoberta intended to move in with Garrick and Dannielle at the end of Seeking Sister Wife season 3, but an unforeseen complication prevented the soon-to-be sister-wife from joining her polygamous partners in Colorado. Unfortunately, Roberta contracted the COVID-19 virus and was restricted from international travel. Luckily, this didn't stop Roberta from giving her budding relationships with Garrick and Dannielle a try.\n\nWhen the three of them returned for Seeking Sister Wife season 4, Roberta's visa had been approved, and Garrick and Dannielle were waiting for her to arrive in Colorado. Roberta couldn't get there due to her mother not feeling well, but this didn't stop Garrick from finding another wife. Garrick began dating a woman named Lea and Roberta was not happy. She broke up with The Merrifields over text and seemingly never arrived in Colorado.\n\nDid Roberta Damange Garrick & Dannielle's Relationship?\n\nShe's The Reason They Divorced\n\nIn some ways, yes, Roberta did cause some damage to Garrick and Dannielle's marriage. Roberta is the reason Garrick divorced Dannielle, as he did that in hopes of getting Roberta to the U.S. faster on a K-1 Visa. Plus, Garrick and Dannielle admitted they felt scammed by Roberta. During Seeking Sister Wife season 4, Garrick revealed that he and Danniele had sent Roberta around $10,000 while she was still in Mexico. Garrick and Dannielle were in it for the long haul, and Roberta didn't seem like she was ready for this type of relationship.\n\nAre Garrick & Roberta Together?\n\nGarrick Has Moved On\n\nGarrick's old, now-deleted, social media posts indicated Roberta eventually landed in Colorado and spent time with his family. On March 27, 2022, Garrick shared a picture on Facebook of Roberta with his two sons, Geremiah and Solomon, which has since been deleted. Garrick established that his relationship with Roberta was going strong in August 2022 when he posted pictures of his \"first trip with my sweet sunshine\" on Instagram, which has also been deleted. Sadly, Roberta's entrance led to Dannielle's absence.\n\nWhile Garrick's Instagram demonstrated that his relationship with Roberta was thriving, the Seeking Sister Wife cast member's social media also conveyed that his marriage with Dannielle was coming to an end. Throughout the latter half of 2021, Garrick continued to share his favorite moments with Roberta. Garrick posted a video of Roberta accepting his proposal to be her husband and several collages of his favorite moments with Roberta in Mexico and Colorado. Roberta likely replaced Dannielle instead of becoming her fellow sister wife.\n\nGarrick and Roberta seemed to have ended things a while as Garrick and Dannielle were courting someone else and had a baby.\n\nHowever, Garrick has since wiped Roberta from his social media as of 2024. He and Roberta are no longer together and Garrick has been courting new women since the end of their relationship. On Seeking Sister Wife season 5, Garrick began a relationship with Nathalia Lima from Brazil, whom the couple met via a dating app and later met up in Mexico. It's unclear if Nathalia is still with Garrick, but it seems unlikely. Garrick and Dannielle announced they welcomed a third child together, who she gave birth to over a year ago, on May 17, 2023.\n\nPlenty of factors prohibited Roberta from joining Garrick and Dannielle's marriage in Seeking Sister Wife, and the Merrifield family continued to face obstacles after season 4 and into the most recent season. From her time with Garrick and Dannielle's kids to her omission from Garrick's Instagram, it's unclear what happened to Roberta after season 4. What is known is Garrick and Dannielle have moved on, and so has Roberta.\n\nSeeking Sister Wife airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on TLC."
