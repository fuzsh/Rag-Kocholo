        "text": "The hero of “Never Look Away” is called Kurt Barnert, and, for the bulk of the narrative, which covers his early adult years and the start of his career as an artist, he is played by Tom Schilling. But the movie begins when Kurt is a boy of six, and the actor who takes the role, Cai Cohrs, exerts, I would say, a more powerful pull on your attention. You can’t take your eyes off his eyes—blue and unblinking, as he confronts the world like a camera with the shutter left open, permitting the images to burn into his brain. The opening scene is set in Dresden, in 1937, and one thing Kurt stares at with particular care is a Kandinsky from 1921. It’s a small abstract painting, one of a cluster of works that have been gathered, under Nazi auspices, to be jeered at for their decadence and their moral deformity. Kurt is viewing the collection in the company of his beloved aunt, Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl), and she quietly says to him, as they stand before the Kandinsky, “Don’t tell anybody, but I like it.”\n\nTo all appearances, Elisabeth is a model citizen, tall and fair. When Hitler visits the city, she has the honor of handing him a bouquet of flowers as his car goes by. But what propels the film, in the course of more than three hours, is a growing awareness that appearances are not merely deceptive but doomed to be incomplete; they dare us to pierce them, as best we can, and to puzzle over the truths that they encrypt. Elisabeth, for instance, is profoundly troubled in mind, and, back at home, Kurt finds her sitting at the piano in the nude. She stands up, hits herself on the head, drawing blood, and says, “I’m playing a concert for the Führer.” Still the little boy looks. As she is taken away in an ambulance, he briefly puts his hand in front of his face, to occlude his final sight of her, much as Tom Hanks gazes up from Earth, in “Apollo 13” (1995), and uses his thumb to blot out the moon he will never reach.\n\nElisabeth is treated by Carl Seeband (Sebastian Koch), although the treatment, in grim violation of the Hippocratic oath, consists of sterilization and, later, euthanasia. The insanity lies not in the patient but in the society that wolfs her down. Seeband, who insists on being addressed as “Professor,” is an obstetrician and a member of the S.S.—a combination so extreme that it belongs, perhaps, in a schlockier film altogether. Dresden is levelled in one infernal night, and, as the war crawls to a close, Seeband is captured by the Russians. After saving his skin, if not his soul, by assisting in the birth of a Russian child, he slots into the Communist regime of East Germany with the disciplined ease that made him so capable a Nazi.\n\n“Never Look Away” is written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who won an Oscar for “The Lives of Others” (2006). That movie, a saga of surveillance and baffled yearning, measured the grip of the Stasi on daily existence and the effects of what you might call intrusive-compulsive disorder. What the new film suggests, over and over, is that, for a person held in that grip—or, indeed, for the Seebands who do the gripping—the political shape of the state is immaterial. Distinctions between left and right mean nothing to the crushed. What Kurt observed about art as a child, for example, is what he discovers afresh when, in the East Germany of the nineteen-fifties, he enrolls in art school and is corralled, like his confrères, into Socialist Realism. The wider cause is paramount, and to serve one’s private needs, in paint, is to yield to the bourgeois blandishments of the self. “Me, me, me!” his teacher exclaims, decrying the modernist mysteries of the West.\n\nKurt falls in love with a fashion student named Ellie (Paula Beer), who sews him a suit. There’s a strange nocturnal sequence, which begins as the two of them, lying in bed, hear her parents returning unexpectedly. Kurt, minus his clothes, leaps out of the window and into a fir tree—a dark, primitive, and very Germanic gag. He climbs down, a bare, forked animal, and comes face to face with Ellie’s mother, Martha (Ina Weisse). Without raising the alarm, she lets him scamper off. Meanwhile, Ellie’s father, who saw nothing, goes upstairs and shuts his daughter’s window. As he leans over to blow out her candle, we see him for the first time. It’s the Professor.\n\nIf you are as slow on the uptake as I am, you’ll need a few seconds to piece together the evidence. It’s like this: Kurt adores, and will soon marry, the child of the man who sent Aunt Elisabeth to her death. And neither he nor Seeband has made the connection. In fact, it is only Kurt’s work that will—years later, once he, Ellie, and her parents have fled to West Germany, and after much trial and error in his creative approach—start to probe the wounds of the past. Even then, we don’t get the sense that he’s wreaking a conscious revenge; rather, his paintings are in themselves acts of investigation. Neither purgative, like therapy, nor sententious, like propaganda, they simply sit on the white walls or the cold floor of Kurt’s studio and bear witness with a frightening honesty, so much so that, when Seeband first sees them, you hold your breath. Will he heed what they have to say?\n\nThis is Sebastian Koch’s moment. He is a handsome presence onscreen, with a formality that grows more interesting as it is compromised. In “The Lives of Others,” he was a successful playwright in East Berlin, striving equally to obey and to buck the system. Here, as the Professor, with his sombre suits and his clinician’s coats, his stiffness remains intact until he is accosted by the paintings, whereupon he shies away, folding into himself, and crumples like a man made of paper. The whole scene is beautifully gauged, and the problem is that Koch—like Weisse, as Seeband’s anxiously watchful wife, and like Rosendahl, as Elisabeth—overshadows Tom Schilling, who is suave but anodyne in the leading role. He is a flimsy successor to the late Ulrich Mühe, who brought such mesmerizing calm and concentration to “The Lives of Others,” as the operative who bugged and recorded his fellow-citizens. To be fair, you don’t envy Schilling in his task. Compared with spying, the ordeal of artistry is notoriously hard to feign, and only the wisest actors have flourished in the attempt. Think of the great Michel Piccoli, for whom Emmanuelle Béart so patiently posed, hour upon hour, in Jacques Rivette’s “La Belle Noiseuse” (1991), and whose intensity, like Mühe’s, never flagged.\n\nDonnersmarck, in the end credits, offers thanks to the German painter Gerhard Richter, who is still alive, and the extent to which “Never Look Away” does or does not mirror his biography is already a matter of debate. (It was recently explored in these pages by Dana Goodyear.) The paintings on show in the film are a spirited exercise in the Richteresque, and it’s no surprise to learn that they were done by Andreas Schön, a former assistant of Richter’s. Should you seek the real thing, however, I would steer you toward “Gerhard Richter Painting” (2011), a fine documentary by Corinna Belz, which reveals the artist to be far more gnomic than Kurt Barnert, and more puckishly amused. Talking of his pictures, he remarks, “They do what they want,” and “I don’t like the ones I understand.”\n\nIt may be that the ideal viewer of “Never Look Away” will be one who has never heard of Richter, and who is at liberty to greet the movie on its own ground. Less compact than “The Lives of Others,” it ranges much more widely, in both tone and time, and labors under a musical score so tenacious that you feel half bullied into the right emotional response. (The composer is Max Richter, and you wonder: Is Donnersmarck racking up the Richters? If so, why not have Bach played by Sviatoslav, or conducted by Karl?) Also, the spaciousness of the plot allows for the gravest errors of judgment. A sequence in which women suffering from mental afflictions are led naked into a gas chamber ought not to have made the final cut; many people will ask why it should have been filmed in the first place.\n\nThen, there are the contrivances on which the movie turns. I was especially taken with the lad who just happens to enter a restaurant where Seeband and Kurt are dining, long after the war, and hawks a newspaper, crying out that a prominent Nazi doctor, the Professor’s former boss, is under arrest. For chronic storytellers, though, coincidence is a natural ingredient of fate, and Donnersmarck is something of a rigorous romantic—a rare breed, unembarrassed by the urge for melodrama, and by tales that are lavishly upholstered and plainly told. The most common complaint is that he’s old-fashioned, but that is no crime, and a more antic or more aggressive style would hardly have improved “The Lives of Others.” The latest film, stately rather than stealthy, is no match for it, but you are borne along, nonetheless, by the clash of characters, and by the ironies of historical momentum. Only by glancing backward into the shadows, we realize, can Kurt, like his homeland, hope to progress. One brush with destiny, and the painter comes alive. ♦"
