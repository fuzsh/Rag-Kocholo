He is the only actor to have won two Adolf Grimme Awards for two different productions in one year (2002).\n\nLife\n\nKoch was born in Karlsruhe in 1962. His mother raised him alone, and he spent some time in the children's home where she worked. From 1982 to 1985 Koch studied at the Otto-Falckenberg-Schule in Munich, and performed during this time with the \"Theater der Jugend\" (Youth Theatre).\n\nAfter working on productions at the municipal theatres of Ulm and Darmstadt, Koch started appearing in Berlin theatres in 1990.

Besides numerous film and TV roles, Koch also made frequent guest appearances on TV shows during this time, including several popular German crime series.\n\nFollowing his acclaimed portrayal of Andreas Baader in Heinrich Breloer's docudrama \"Todesspiel\", he appeared in many full-length television dramas.\n\nIn 2001 came the final breakthrough with the portrayal of the kidnapped industrialist's son Richard Oetker in \"Dance with the Devil - The Kidnapping of Richard Oetker\", and of the writer Klaus Mann in Heinrich Breloer's docudrama \"The Manns - A Novel of the Century\". Koch received the Adolf Grimme Award for both roles. For his portrayal of Hitler's would-be assassin, the title character in Jo Baier's \"Stauffenberg\", Koch was nominated for the German Television Awards and the Grimme Award, and received the Golden Gong award from the media magazine \"Gong\".\n\nIn 2004 Koch appeared in a production directed by Heinrich Breloer for the third time.
