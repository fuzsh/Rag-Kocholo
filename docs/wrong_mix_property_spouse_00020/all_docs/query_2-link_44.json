Cybermen Mondas (twin planet of Earth) The Tenth Planet (1966) Created by Kit Pedler. After Earth’s twin planet Mondas drifts off into space, it’s inhabitants experiment with cybernetics, creating new bodies for themselves. The tomb of the Cybermen was on the planet Telos.

Weakness - gold which, being non-corrosive, chokes their respiratory systems. Daleks Skaro The Daleks (1963) Created by Terry Nation. The other occupants of Skaro were the Thals. After the Kaleds were mutated and damaged by nuclear war, Davros (see below) genetically modified them and integrated them with a tank-like, robotic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate - Genesis of the Daleks (1975). The Great Intelligence The Abominable Snowmen (1967) It has no physical form but can communicating, both by itself and through possession of other characters.

Used the robotic Yeti as servants Ice Warriors Mars The Ice Warriors (1967) Reptilian humanoids from a dying Mars who were dubbed “Ice Warriors” by the scientific team which first discovered them in a spacecraft buried deep in ice. Distinguished by their hissing voice. They have sonic weaponry built into their wrists. They are not always adversaries of The Doctor and have allied with him on some occasions. As with the Cybermen, they have gone through various redesigns. Judoon Smith and Jones (2007) An extraterrestrial species of mercenary police with rhinoceros-like heads which first appeared in the revived series. Ood The Impossible Planet (2006) An alien species with telepathic abilities who require a \"translation sphere\" to communicate with non-telepathic creatures.

The Rani Gallifrey The Mark of the Rani (1985) A renegade Time Lord played by Kate O’Mara. Sea Devils Earth The Sea Devils (1972) Underwater versions of the Silurians. (see below) Sil Vengeance on Varos (1985) A devious alien (an exploitative mining boss and arms dealer on the two occasions he met The Doctor) played by Nabil Shaban. He had a sibilant voice sibilant and an ululating laugh. The Silence The Impossible Astronaut (2011) A religious order whose existence is a secret because anyone who sees them immediately forgets about them after looking away. However, he or she retains suggestions made to them by the Silence thus giving them a pervasive influence over human history. Their look is partly inspired by Edvard Munch's “The Scream”. Silurians Earth Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) Reptile-like scientifically advanced sentient humanoids who predate the dawn of man. They went into self-induced hibernation underground to survive what they predicted to be a large geological upheaval caused by the Earth capturing the Moon.

Slitheen Raxacoricofallapatorius Aliens of London (2005) One of the families of Raxacoricofallapatorians, which also includes the Blathereen and Hostrazeen. These bi-pedal hunters have a highly developed sense of smell and have weapons including a poisoned dart-finger and poisonous breath. They disguise themselves by fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields created by a collar worn around their necks. Unfortunately gas build-up during compression leads to excess farting. Sontarans Sontar The Time Warrior (1973) A cloned humanoid warrior race with a dome-shaped head and three fingers on each hand. They live to kill and have been at war with the Rutan Host for at least 70,000 years. A \"probic vent\" at the back of their neck is a weak spot. The Sontaran Strax is part of the “Paternoster Gang” along with the Silurian Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint and The Doctor. Weeping Angels Blink (2007) Resembling human-sized stone statues in the form of winged angels in draped clothing, they feed by making use of time paradoxes – they can send a person into the past to a point before his/her own birth and then feed off the \"potential energy\" of the years which that victim would have lived in the present. They can only move when not being observed by another being but they can move quite some distance in the blink of an eye. When observed they become \"quantum-locked\", occupying a single position in space and becoming stone. If two Weeping Angels were to look at each other at the same time, they would be trapped in stone form until an outside force moves them apart. Zygons Zygor Terror of the Zygons (1975) Shape-shifters who can replicate the appearance of another being as long as the subject is kept alive.\n\nDollhouse – 2009-2010\n\nWritten and directed by Joss Whedon (“Buffy”, “Angel” and “Firefly”) the series follows Echo, an “Active” or “Doll” who works from an underground Dollhouse (of which there are many). Each Active has their original memories wiped and exists in a childlike blank state until programmed with temporary personalities or skills and are hired out to wealthy clients. Echo’s original memories (stored on a hard drive for later re-implanting) are never successfully completely wiped and she becomes increasingly self-aware.\n\nThe Dollhouse's corporate sponsor is a medical research entity known as the Rossum Corporation - the name is taken from the play \"R.U.R.\" (short for Rossum's Universal Robots\") written by Karel Čapek which is the origin of the word \"robot\".\n\nEcho Eliza Dushku\n\nBoyd Langton Harry Lennix\n\nTopher Brink Fran Kranz\n\nPaul Ballard Tahmoh Penikett\n\nVictor Enver Gjokaj\n\nSierra Dichen Lachman\n\nAdelle DeWitt Olivia Williams\n\nWhiskey Amy Acker\n\nAlpha Alan Tudyk\n\nDaniel Perrin Alexis Denisof\n\nMatthew Harding Keith Carradine\n\nBennett Halverson Summer Glau\n\nDoomwatch – BBC 1970-1972\n\nA scientific government agency is made responsible for investigating and combating various ecological and technological dangers.\n\nDr. Spencer Quist John Paul\n\nColin Bradley Joby Blanshard\n\nDr. John Ridge Simon Oates\n\nBarbara Mason Vivien Sherrard\n\nThe Minister John Barron\n\nTobias Wren Robert Powell\n\nEarly Edition – 1996-2000\n\nGary Hobson receives a copy of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper the day before it is actually published.
