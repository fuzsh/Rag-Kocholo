The industry bible Variety paid tribute to her talent, New York magazine named her Woman of the Year in January 2008, and Vanity Fair's Hollywood edition two months later featured her in an upside-down pose to indicate her effect on the film industry.",

        "text": "So it's rather odd that, as I wait in the lobby of the No 11 hotel in Chelsea, I'm wondering if I'll recognise her. As Black Book's Jewish undercover agent, she was plump-cheeked with tight blonde curls. In her follow-up Nazi epic, Valkyrie, where she took an almost diametrically opposite role as the haunted wife of Tom Cruise's SS officer, she was a hollow-eyed brunette. When she materialises, Carice is wearing granny glasses and brown tweed, her dark hair piled into a messy chignon. You shouldn't polish the floors so much!' she rebukes the receptionist, her brow crinkling with irritation. I got out of bed this morning and fell down flat.'\n\nThis year, for instance, she's appearing in a Dutch film, A Woman Goes to the Doctor, as a breast-cancer sufferer who's cheated on by her previously devoted husband. In 2008 she was in Dorothy Mills, a horror film about a possessed babysitter. She's just wrapped on another Dutch film, The Happy Housewife, a tale of a woman who suffers from catastrophic post-natal depression as a result of her father's suicide. And the day after our interview, she's due to fly to South Africa to start filming Black Butterfly with Blade Runner's Rutger Hauer, a biopic of Nelson Mandela's favourite poet Ingrid Jonker, who killed herself following her father's rejection. Then she's in Black Death, which stars Sean Bean and is all about the plague; Carice is playing a Satanic necromancer. How does she cope with all this trauma? Well, I'm not a method actor,' she says. I usually find it quite easy to switch off. But doing the cancer film was intense. Dying on screen can be tricky and really ugly.'\n\nBang on cue, a bowl of porridge arrives. She shudders delicately. I said no to porridge,' she tells the waitress. She hasn't eaten porridge since she had to spend a day naked having a cold vat of it, mixed with pea soup and masquerad-ing as excrement, poured over her head in a humiliation scene in Black Book.\n\nIt was horrible. I was so dirty and it was so embarrassing and cold, standing there naked in front of all these people. So I said to Paul Verhoeven, \"When we're done with this day, we're going to wrestle in this shit because I want you to be in it as well.\" And when we finished, I was crying as I walked off the set, and I heard Paul say, \"Hey, where are you going?\" He was standing in the middle of this soup with his arms open, going, \"Come on then!\" He was a hero to me,' she goes on with shining eyes. I would do anything for him.' The admiration is mutual: Verhoeven has described her as the best actress he's ever worked with.\n\nFortunately for Carice's mental health, it's not all doom and gloom; this year she can be seen as Jude Law's rejected wife in the sci-fi comedy Repo Men, and she's also starring in Julian Fellowes' From Time to Time, an adaptation of the well-loved children's book The Chimneys of Green Knowe. Carice plays Maria Oldknow, the ghostly great-great-great grandmother of Maggie Smith. That was fun. It was very British. It was the first time I've ever worn a corset.'\n\nCarice, 33, was born in the small town of Leiderdorp into an intellectual, middle-class family. Her mother, Margje Stasse, is a broadcaster and her father, Theodore van Houten, who is half-Scottish, is a writer and journalist. They separ-ated when she was young, and her father seems to have used his silent cinema collection as an electronic babysitter for his five-year-old daughter. He would put me in front of five-hour films like Napoleon when I was little. I must have picked something up because I really love acting when I don't have to say anything.' When she wasn't watching epic films she was listening to her father's Beatles collection, which had a similarly positive effect, making her fluent in English from an early age.\n\nBut Carice herself was a very shy, grey mouse' of a child. I remember my mother saying, \"Come on, please sing!\" when people came over and I would always be too embarrassed.' It all changed when she was 12 and was cast in a school play. I finally felt that I wasn't invisible. I could connect to people and they would respond to me,' she says. It sounds a little sad but that's how I felt.'\n\nHer first professional performance was in Amsterdam, treading the boards in Brecht's The Threepenny Opera in 1997, and her first major film role was in a 1999 TV film, Suzy Q, in which she played the heroine and carried off a Golden Calf (a Dutch Oscar) for her performance. That was followed by another Golden Calf-winning role in a family comedy, Undercover Kitty, in which she played a cat who turns into a woman. Eccentrically, she started miaowing during her acceptance speech: I wanted to thank the cats I'd worked with.' Even so, she says she couldn't quite believe that she was any good as an actress.\n\nThat all changed with the worldwide acclaim that came with her performance in Black Book. When foreigners were touched by something I did I felt there were so many more people I could reach. Acting is a universal language. That's why I do it – I like the connection with people. It can be very consoling when you act, the audience is sort of breathing along with you.'\n\nIt was while making Black Book that she fell in love with her co-star Sebastian Koch, star of The Lives of Others, who played her Nazi lover. You can even see her blushing in the scene where they met for the first time. I Googled him because I was curious as to who they picked,' she says. When I saw the picture, I thought, \"Oh no, there's going to be trouble.\" ' Their obvious chemistry lit up the screen, making them, for a time, the golden couple of European cinema and Carice into an international star.\n\nHer relationship with her homeland has, as a result, become rather complicated. She is still based in her duplex apartment in Amsterdam and is a national heroine, but at the same time she's terrified that her compatriots will think she's getting too big for her boots. At home we have a very famous saying: \"Act normal, that's crazy enough.\" It means: \"Don't try to make yourself different from other people.\" We all know everybody because it's such a small world, so I'm expected to be one of the guys and tell dirty jokes to the light technicians or gossip during make-up. But if you have to do a scene where you die, or your breast is cut off, you need some space to con-centrate without having to talk. The acting profession isn't taken seriously in Holland.'\n\nAs a result she will be going to live in Hollywood for several months this year. There's less to keep her in Europe now that her relationship with Koch is over. She announced the split on Dutch TV in August last year, blaming the constant separation imposed by their jobs. It was a decision that filled us both with sadness,' Koch later told the Dutch press. It's so disappointing that we failed, but it is the right decision. If two people are as busy with their career as we are, it's difficult to maintain a relationship.'\n\nToday, a brittle Carice trots out all the post-break-up clichés: they're really good friends', there was nobody else involved, and she's happy with her single status. Except for my biological clock,' she says unexpectedly. It's becoming more and more of a topic for me. I love my work but I know this will all stop one day, when I get too old or I don't win awards any more and the new generation takes over. Raising children is the biggest challenge and my worst worry is to end up some sort of Botoxed lady who has no children and no love.' She shouldn't worry; red-hot Dutch girls don't tend to stay single for long."
