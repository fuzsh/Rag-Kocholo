Visitation will be prior to service starting at 9 a.m.\n\nBetsy was born on January 3, 1938, in Medford, Wisconsin to Fred and Elizabeth Fleischmann. She graduated from Medford High School. She worked as a key punch operator and accountant before marriage. Betsy married Jerry in 1961 and they raised four daughters together.\n\nWhen her girls were older, she worked at the Rib Lake Shoe Factory. She also served as the treasurer for the township of Westboro and was librarian at the Westboro Public Library. She was a member of Good Shepherd Catholic Church and was a lady of strong faith. Betsy was active in the local community by volunteering for various organizations including the Westboro Conservation Club, St. Theresa Catholic Church, Shepherd Knitters, and the Westboro Senior Meals.\n\nShe created crafts of all sorts and was a very talented seamstress, knitter, and crocheter. She enjoyed making prayer shawls for church and Christmas afghans for all of her grandchildren. She looked forward to her monthly breakfast clubs and dining out at the Rail Trail Cafe. Above all, she felt truly blessed to spend time with her family and friends and took great pride in her children and grandchildren.\n\nShe is survived by her loving husband of 63 years, Jerry, Westboro; daughters Susan (Jim) Maes, Las Cruces, NM, Julie (Dennis) Bach, Dorchester, Brenda (Stan) Malinowski, Woodbury, MN, and Sheila (Brian) Roush, Phillips; grandchildren Ashley (Sebastian) Gomez, Carissa Maes, Sam Bach, Madeline (fiancé Jared Way) Bach, Courtney Peper, Will Malinowski, Kate Malinowski, Allison (Ron) Juedes, and Jessica Roush; sister Bernice Tlusty; in-laws Gene Kalmon, Bernice Koch, Bonnie Fischer, Dennis (Carole) Koch, and Janice “Sis” VanDuser.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; one son, Paul; sisters Mary Lou, Margaret, Frances, Ethel, and Janet; brothers Alfred, Walter, and Edward.\n\nThe family wishes to express sincere thanks to Country Gardens, Rib Lake Health Care Center, Rib Lake Ambulance Service, and Hope Hospice Palliative Care for their care and compassion during her illness.\n\nMemorials may be made in her name to Good Shepard Catholic Church or Westboro Public Library."
