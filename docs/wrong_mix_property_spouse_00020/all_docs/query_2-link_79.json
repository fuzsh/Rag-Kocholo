The Nazi Image in Low-Brow Cinema and Culture Daniel H. Magilow\n\nW\n\nThe New York Times reviewed Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1974) on November 30, 1975, he posed a question to his readers and future historians. ‘If it’s possible to reconstruct the interests, attitudes and values of a lost society from its garbage,’ Canby wrote, ‘then perhaps we should take a closer look at some of the junk that’s passing through our movie theaters these days. Would you want a future historian speculating about your life on the basis of a mossy old print of Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS?’1 The essays in the volume before you might have surprised Vincent Canby. On the basis of Ilsa and similar films, they carry out the wishes of the person who might have answered ‘yes’ to his rhetorical question. To the extent that one can speak of ‘canonical’ Nazi exploitation or ‘Nazisploitation’ films, Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS is a standard-bearer. The story centers on Ilsa, a well-endowed, sexually voracious commandante of a prisoner-of-war camp. Ilsa presides over sadistic medical experiments, and every night she rapes and executes the male prisoners who cannot satisfy her insatiable sexual appetites. During the opening credits, the film feebly attempts to shield itself from accusations that it exploits the memory of World War II and concentration camps by claiming an authentic basis in the true but fundamentally unrelated story of the war criminal Ilse Koch. The alleged crimes of Ilse Koch, the wife of Buchenwald commandant Karl Koch who was dubbed hen Vincent Canby of\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 1\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n2 Nazisploitation!\n\nthe infamous ‘Bitch of Buchenwald’, reputedly included ordering lampshades made from the skin of tattooed prisoners and having ditch diggers beaten for looking at her after she paraded above them in a short skirt without underwear.2 Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS is in fact even dedicated to the victims of the Nazi camps, as if its gratuitous memorial rhetoric could compensate for the wholesale desecration of historical memory that follows on-screen. The aspects of Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS that presumably led Vincent Canby to call it ‘junk’ in fact represent the standard tropes, settings and narrative conceits of Nazisploitation cinema: sexually perverted, calculating and sadistic Nazi officers, prisoner-of-war and concentration camps, medical experimentation and prisoner rebellions. With its myriad continuity errors, profound tastelessness, and historical inaccuracy, Ilsa also typifies the genre’s technical sloppiness and arguable lack of artistic quality. In these films that conflate the history of World War II and the Holocaust or that invent new and fantastic histories altogether, Nazis are more caricature than character. In the logic of the Nazisploitation film, all Germans are Nazis, all Nazis are members of the SS, and all members of the SS are war criminals, medical experimenters and sexual sadists. If, to cite Jeffrey Shandler’s phrase, Nazis and the Holocaust have become the ‘master moral paradigm’ of evil, then the Nazis of Nazisploitation film embody this evil more than they represent specific historical personages.3 In its heyday in North America and Western Europe after the upheavals of 1968 and into the late 1970s, Nazisploitation emerged amidst the wave of low-budget exploitation films that, depending on their subject matter, have been retroactively categorized as blax­ploitation, nunsploitation, mexploitation, ‘mondo’ film, womenin-prison movies and the like.4 As film scholar Eric Schaefer defines it, the term ‘exploitation film’ derives from ‘the practice of exploitation, advertising or promotional techniques that went over and above typical posters, trailers and newspaper ads.’5 True to this strategy, Nazisploitation relied more on sensationalistic tag lines and sexually provocative marketing to lure audiences into theaters rather than on aesthetic quality or a compelling narrative that might ensure repeat viewings. Marketing emphasized sexual content, usually with the help of large-breasted, leather-clad blonde women in provocative poses. To judge from film posters and taglines, movies such as Ilsa She Wolf\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 2\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nFigure 1\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 3\n\nPoster for Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1974).\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n4 Nazisploitation!\n\nof the SS or Lager SSadis Kastrat Kommandantur (SS Experiment Love Camp, 1976) appeared to be sex films. But more often than not, Nazisploitation titles resembled slasher films more than hardcore pornography. By one count, Ilsa includes only five specifically sexual scenes against 44 depictions of violence and torture.6 Be it for their sex or their violence, these films earned the scorn of censors around the world, most famously as banned films on the ‘video nasties’ list in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.7 Vincent Canby might have cringed at the idea that future historians would think about the mid-1970s on the basis of ‘trash’ such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS. Yet he could not entirely have foreseen an academic sensibility that increasingly bases its cultural histories not solely on ‘grand narratives’ or politicians’ grandiose pronouncements or high art films, but instead on surfaces, ruins, decay and ephemera. The German film critic Siegfried Kracauer, himself an exile and victim of Nazism, stressed in his influential From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film that we need to attend to such surfaces. According to Kracauer, these surfaces yield clues to mentalities and histories that official narratives may not.8 Accordingly, this volume explores these ‘trashy’ films. It traces their histories and genealogies, the ways their narrative formulas and character types merge sexuality and politics, and how these motifs have persisted into the present and continually been updated and reinvented. The following essays take Nazisploitation’s ‘shortcomings’ vis-à-vis more established forms of cinema as an opportunity to pose worthwhile but underexamined questions: Why should one read about films of dubious artistic or moral integrity? What can one gain by attending to films that callously misappropriate human suffering for cheap thrills and commercial gain? And what can these films tell us about the representation of sex and violence on film? Anyone who might have thought that these exaggerated images of Nazis, at once sadistic, nymphomaniac and fantastic, were relevant only to the world of Ilsa and the seedy Times Square grindhouses of the 1970s must recognize that that world is not lost at all. Indeed, to borrow the rhetoric of Nazisploitation movie posters, just when you thought it was dead… Nazisploitation is back.\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 4\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nThe Nazisploitation Renaissance Back and better (or worse?) than ever, in fact. Although the genre never entirely died out in the 30+ years since its heyday in the 1970s, Nazisploitation cinema has in recent years experienced a noticeable renaissance. ‘Underground’ titles once available only as low-quality copies from independent distributors are increasingly sold on Amazon. com as deluxe DVD box sets with ‘all the trimmings’. The inclusion of ‘making-of’ segments, cast interviews, liner notes and other bonus features confers an added degree of prestige to films once considered the epitome of trash. The Nazisploitation revival reached an apotheosis of sorts in the commercial and critical success of Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds (2009), whose very title plays on Enzo Castellari’s 1978 World War II ‘mission’ film Quel maledetto treno blindato, translated as The Inglorious Bastards. But Tarantino is not alone. Marvel Productions and Paramount Pictures recently brought film audiences the summer blockbuster Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which pits the titular superhero against Red Skull, a Nazi officer, weapons specialist, close confidant of Hitler and all-around supervillain whose ominous red skull mask gives an appropriately evil face to the Third Reich’s crimes. Keith J. Crocker, the proprietor of Cinefear, a distributor of hard-tofind and out-of-print films and videos, even wrote and directed the ‘neo-Nazisploitation’ film Blitzkrieg: Escape from Stalag 69 (2008), a production that revisits the low budget feel of its 1970s antecedents.9 Nor is the renewed interest in Nazisploitation limited to North America. Thanks to digital video, editing software, streaming video and internet distribution, Nazisploitation films can now be distributed and consumed worldwide. Alongside the American production Horrors of War (2006), for instance, films such as British director Steve Barker’s Outpost (2007) and the Norwegian production Død Snø (Dead Snow, 2009) count among the burgeoning subgenre of ‘Nazi zombie’ films. In early 2011, trailers for the upcoming Finnish film Iron Sky spread across the internet and created a buzz for this science fiction-comedy. In director Timo Vuorensola’s science-fiction comedy, descendants of Nazis coordinate an attack from the secret base they established in 1945 on the dark side of the moon. There are even documentaries on Nazisploitation, notably Israeli director Ari Libsker’s Stalagim (Stalags, 2007) about pornographic Israeli pulp fiction in the 1960s. These\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 5\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n6 Nazisploitation!\n\nerotic graphic novels, well known to an entire generation of Israelis, feature stories of American and British pilots, downed and captured behind enemy lines, who endure torture at the hands of female SS guards in prisoner-of-war camps (the eponymous Stalags) before they eventually gain the upper hand and subsequently rape and murder their captors.10 Admittedly, Nazisploitation’s early-twenty-first-century cinematic comeback often smirks ironically or condescendingly at its twentieth century antecedents. Rob Zombie’s mock trailer for the as-yet-unmade film Werewolf Women of the SS appears between segments of the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez co-production Grindhouse (2007), and it plainly acknowledges the genre’s sensationalism, gore, and all-around trashiness from the perspective of a well-funded Hollywood production. Yet, where Nazisploitation was once taboo, today its motifs and narrative conceits have permeated big budget studio productions and mainstream popular culture as well. In 2009, for instance, English actress Kate Winslet won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Hanna Schmitz in the screen adaptation of German author Bernard Schlink’s bestseller The Reader, which was also the February 1999 Oprah’s Book Club selection. In a storyline reminiscent of Nazisploitation films, Winslet plays a former concentration camp guard and war criminal who seduces the fifteen-year old Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes) and helps him ‘come of age’ as a man. At the same time as mass media demonize female high school teachers for paedophilic liaisons with teenage boys, the official website for Oprah’s Book Club still praised and normalized these elements of Schlink’s novel by describing it as a ‘love story of stunning power’.11 Fantastic and ethically dubious appropriations of National Socialism, Hitler and the Third Reich have also found significant traction in other media beyond film. In the Xbox 360 version of the popular first-person shooter game Call of Duty: World at War, gamers can play a special ‘Nazi Zombie mode’ and kill (and subsequently re-kill) Nazis. By bringing back the Nazis so as cyclically to kill them anew, a new generation can symbolically reclaim the moral high ground that their grandparents’ or even great-grandparents’ generation first staked out as the ‘good guys’ in a ‘just war’. Or through humor, contemporary audiences can ritually humiliate Hitler and Nazis, as in the widely circulated variants of the ‘Hitler Meme’, a clip from Oliver\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 6\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nHirschbiegel’s Der Untergang (Downfall, 2004). The literally hundreds of variants of this clip feature Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) in a frothing rage with a variety of satiric subtitles. As a buffoonish, pathetic, and defeated Hitler rants in German about the loss of World War II, these viral videos use subtitles to re-imagine this anger as frustration with John McCain’s choice of Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential candidate, Michael Jackson’s death, Conan O’Brien’s departure from The Tonight Show, Hitler’s frustration at ‘not killing Osama Bin Laden first’ and any number of other ‘lost causes’. One version even self-referentially depicts Hitler’s rage when YouTube decided in April 2010 to remove these viral videos to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits from Constantin Film AG, the producers of Downfall.12 Meanwhile, the animated TV series Family Guy and South Park attract controversy for their use of Nazi iconography, as when the former attracted attention for its October 19, 2008 episode in which characters wear SS uniforms adorned with ‘McCain-Palin’ campaign buttons. And all the while, new ‘Nazi’ phrases enter the popular lexicon, including ‘Grammar Nazi’ (an individual with an overly zealous or pedantic attitude to grammar and style) and ‘Nazi Tourette’s’ (comedian Lewis Black’s description of conservative commentator Glenn Beck’s seemingly uncontrollable propensity to invoke Hitler and Nazis in analogies).13\n\nInappropriate Appropriations For all of the current ubiquity of the Nazi image in both low-brow cinema and popular culture in the United States and beyond, Nazisploitation cinema has largely escaped the attention of film and Holocaust scholars, although not entirely.14 The reasons relate clearly to this genre’s flagrant disregard for historical accuracy, pornographic and misogynistic tendencies, graphic violence, and all-around tastelessness and lack of ethical sensitivity to the twentieth-century’s deadliest war and most notorious genocide. In Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust, for instance, the noted film scholar Annette Insdorf states that her goal in writing this important history of Holocaust cinema is ‘to explore the degree to which [Holocaust] films manifest artistic as well as moral integrity.’15 The only films Insdorf addresses that might qualify as Nazisploitation are avant-garde European works such as Liliana Cavani’s Il portiere di notte (The Night Porter, 1974) or Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom,\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 7\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n8 Nazisploitation!\n\n1975). These films, which Marcus Stiglegger terms sadiconazista, an Italian neologism meaning ‘sadism with Nazis’, have elicited strongly polarized critical opinion. Detractors see them as pornography or pretentious ‘Euro-trash’, while proponents praise them as daring, taboo-breaking masterpieces that make sadomasochism, coprophagy and other forms of deviance into metaphors for fascism.16 The Night Porter scandalously imagined the relationship between a concentration camp officer and a prisoner (Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling) as sadomasochistic and thus ultimately pleasurable, while Pasolini’s film transposes the libertinism of the Marquis de Sade into the setting of the Nazi puppet state of Salò, in Northern Italy. These controversial films and other art-house features may periodically find their way into canonical histories of Holocaust film and stretch the boundaries of Nazisploitation beyond the ‘low-brow’. Yet films like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS or Nazi zombie films remain relatively understudied. A key reason that detractors ignore Nazisploitation films is that they violate a central taboo of Holocaust representation: they visualize and exaggerate atrocities in ways that claim to make them comprehensible, even as Holocaust survivors insist non-participants simply cannot comprehend them if they were not there. This taboo touches upon well-rehearsed debates about the propriety of representing the Third Reich’s crimes in film and in other media. Claims such as Theodor W. Adorno’s that ‘to write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric’ helped establish the so-called Bilderverbot, a ‘ban on graven images’ vis-à-vis the Holocaust.17 A key feature of this debate about Holocaust representation is a false dichotomy between commercial films in a mimetic or ‘realistic’ mode on the one hand and more aesthetically selfconscious art films on the other. The debate reached a fever pitch in the mid-1990s, when French filmmaker Claude Lanzmann denounced Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List (1993) as a film that tries to represent a horror whose negative sublimity defies representation altogether. In his own Shoah (1985), Lanzmann eschews altogether any reconstruction of events or the use of archival footage and relies instead on interviews with perpetrators, victims and bystanders. Although, as film scholar Miriam Hansen has shown, the ‘Schindler’s List versus Shoah’ binary is overblown,18 the Lanzmann/Spielberg debate points to a key structural dimension that undergirds thinking about Holocaust film, and that Nazisploitation cinema further exposes: the posited differences between ‘proper’ and ‘exploitative’ modes of representing the\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 8\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 9\n\ntraumatic Nazi past are not as great as one might believe. The claim that certain representations of violence and sex are ‘appropriate’ while others are ‘exploitative’ kitsch regularly provides a subterfuge for other agendas about how to remember the past. Such agendas might include, for instance, the desire to preserve the image of World War II as the war of a ‘greatest generation’ of American heroes. Or they might buttress the notion that the Holocaust is a sacred event that non-participants simply cannot understand. As an object of study that instrumentalizes memory and history in such taboo-violating ways, Nazisploitation cinema has increasingly attracted scholarly interest as a ‘paracinematic’ form. Paracinema is the term that film theorist Jeffrey Sconce coined to refer to genres and fan cultures outside of ‘legitimate’ and ‘mainstream’ film.19 Nazisploitation’s putative ‘outsider’ status as a paracinematic form helps explain in part its appeal for fans and for scholars interested in canon formation. Yet the essays in Nazisploitation! do not seek to mimic fawning, uncritical fan cultures or rehabilitate a violent, misogynistic, and at times pornographic genre. Nor do they merely argue that, in spite of their ethical and aesthetic failings, these films still deserve inclusion within the canon of the great World War II and Holocaust films. Rather, by examining the diverse ways this taboo-breaking cinematic genre has, one might say, ‘inappropriately appropriated’ images of National Socialism, World War II and the Holocaust, the essays in Nazisploitation! aim to help us understand better the very composition of the canon in the first place. The ways these films depict Nazism and its atrocities draw attention to the very mechanisms of canon formation. They alert us to those spoken and unspoken rules and protocols that govern the production and reception of such films and whose violation results in stigma. Through scrutiny of films of different degrees of marginality, from underground pornographic Hungarian S&M Nazi bondage films all the way to fêted Academy Award nominees, these essays search for the implicit and explicit rules that determine how filmmakers are expected to represent traumatic pasts, how viewers are expected to understand them and how critics are expected to appraise them. Nazisploitation!: The Nazi Image in Low-Brow Cinema and Culture contributes to our understanding about how we think about Nazis, the Third Reich, World War II, and even the concept of ‘evil’ more generally. It does so not in spite of the fact that these films’ production values and dubious ethics often result in their\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 9\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n10 Nazisploitation!\n\nexclusion from discussions of Holocaust film. Indeed, it is precisely the history of this normative exclusion that invites us to reflect critically on the terms with which cinema and mass culture engage traumatic pasts. As the number of people with unmediated access to the original events declines, this project takes on added importance because soon the only access we have to the twentieth century’s signature war and genocide will be through media. Of the many results that emerge from these investigations, one stands out: terms such as ‘Nazisploitation’ and ‘mainstream Holocaust cinema’ or ‘art’ are socially constructed. They say as much about particular political, cultural and ideological agendas at particular historical junctures than they do about the films themselves.\n\nThe Many Paths to Nazisploitation: Origins, Histories and Genealogies The following essays reveal that we need to continue questioning the boundaries between ‘inappropriate’ and ‘appropriate’ cinematic modes because both ‘serious mainstream’ and ‘exploitative underground’ cinema about the Third Reich and its crimes share common historical antecedents. Consider, for instance, the following case study that links the US Army Signal Corps’s concentration camp atrocity films to Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS. In his autobiography A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King, the producer of Ilsa, David F. Friedman (1923–2011), recounts his work with the US Army Signal Corps in the mid-1940s. In the early postwar context, the Signal Corps was tasked with filming the newly liberated camps. The Allies used the Signal Corps’s disturbing and now-iconic footage of emaciated survivors and bulldozers pushing piles of corpses into mass graves to convince American and British audiences of the value of their sacrifices, shame German citizens for the actions done in their name, and convict Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials. Billy Wilder, Frank Capra, George Stevens and other important personalities of postwar American cinema created atrocity films and anti-German propaganda for the Signal Corps before creating many of the popular films with which audiences now associate them.20 Unlike these more famous Army Signal Corps film makers, however, David F. Friedman remained in the United States, where he supervised movie theaters on army bases and instructed GIs and civilian employees in film production.21 Crucially, his work in the Signal Corps exposed him to this shocking atrocity footage.\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 10\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nAfter the war, Friedman eventually teamed up with the (in)famous producer and film promoter Howard W. ‘Kroger’ Babb. Using the standard modus operandi of exploitation film, they produced the documentary Halfway to Hell (1953). Friedman and Babb took shocking footage of bodies and executions and presented it within a documentary narrative framework that was, at least nominally, socially acceptable because of its staunch anti-Communist rhetoric. The film presents itself as a warning against the dangers of totalitarianism, a term that had morphed by the early-1950s to mean Communism rather than Nazism. Babb had successfully used such tactics many times before. To the extent that the film has a plot, it serves primarily as scaffolding for shocking spectacles, as was often the case in later exploitation films.22 As Friedman notes in his autobiography, Halfway to Hell was somewhat disingenuously marketed as a political warning when it primarily afforded an excuse to ‘poke viewers in the eye’ with shocking footage from World War II and the Holocaust. In fact, it borrowed entire sections of Nazi Concentration Camps.23 Like this atrocity film, Halfway to Hell’s Buñuelian mission was to shock through sheer spectacle, not compelling narrative. It begins with an intertitle that frames the subsequent footage as proof of the evils of all forms of atheism and totalitarianism, whether Fascist, Nazi or Communist, just as postwar atrocity films opened with intertitles that explicitly stated the moral imperative that should motivate the screening and viewing of gruesome footage. Although Friedman himself continued to produce and market such films for the next two decades, few concerned Nazism or the Holocaust explicitly. But in 1968, he returned to Nazis. Friedman produced and played a bit part in Love Camp 7, an early moment of the late-60s/early-70s Nazisploitation craze. Five years later, he produced Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, which itself inspired several sequels and knockoffs. In the broader history of Nazisploitation, the Signal Corps– Friedman–Babb–Ilsa nexus is but one example of the many foundational narratives. The essays in Part I of this volume, ‘Origins, Histories and Genealogies’, explore other back stories and in the process add temporal, linguistic and geographic breadth to the history of the Nazi image in low-brow cinema and culture. In ‘Cinema beyond Good and Evil?: Nazi Exploitation in the Cinema of the 1970s and its Heritage’ (Chapter 1), Marcus Stiglegger reflects on the central role television and cinema — rather than the historical profession writ\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 11\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n12 Nazisploitation!\n\nlarge — have played in creating popular images of Holocaust memory. Stiglegger shows that even though popular conceptions of the genocide depend heavily on films such as Schindler’s List (1993) and Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss (1978), films of the ‘sadiconazista cycle’ have also played a key role. Sadiconazista refers to the fictional and not entirely reputable Nazi exploitation pulp literature and cinema between the 1960s and the 1980s. The films of the sadiconazista cycle were both ‘arty’ and controversial during their time, and they have subsequently proven highly influential in international cinema and popular culture up to the present. Stiglegger offers a typology of this important aspect of Nazisploitation and lays bare some of its narrative conceits and character types. In their essays in Chapters 2 and 3, Michael D. Richardson and Alicia Kozma examine additional links between exploitation film and big-budget blockbusters. They consider the significant but often under-acknowledged traffic between North American Nazisploitation films, the sadiconazista cycle and contemporary mainstream cinema. Big-budget productions such as The Reader (2008), Zwartboek (Black Book, 2006), and the films of the Indiana Jones franchise (1981ff.) feature the characters and storylines that parallel antecedents such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS or The Night Porter. Figures such as Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in The Reader and Dr Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade are at least to a certain extent the cinematic Doppelgänger of Ilsa. Like Ilsa, they are both cunning, sexually deviant, and of course, blond. When these Hollywood or Hollywoodstyle films transfer these motifs into more reputable commercial contexts, the help legitimize the myths about sexuality and violence that the earlier films introduced. Richardson and Kozma show that, in many ways, there never was a Nazisploitation ‘revival’, because it never entirely disappeared. The next essays in this first section (Chapters 4 and 5) by Elizabeth Bridges and James Ward seek the history of Nazisploitation in the vexing relationship of Nazis and science. It is a well-known and troubling fact that the Third Reich’s scientists made important and even beneficial discoveries.24 After the war the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA, recognized these scientists’ value and, as a part of the covert ‘Project Paperclip’ smuggled many into the United States to keep them out of Soviet hands. But at the same time as associations with Nazism tainted scientific legacies, they also\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 12\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nfueled film makers’ imaginations. As Bridges and Ward show, the ‘Nazi mad scientist’ and ‘Nazi medical experimenter’ types form the basis of films such as Shock Waves (1977), about an army of genetically modified ‘super soldiers’, and The Boys from Brazil (1978), in which war criminals in South America try to clone the Führer and establish the basis for a Nazi revival. Alluding to the horrors of Dr Joseph Mengele’s medical torture or Wernher von Braun’s exploitation of slave labor in the V-2 rocketry program, Nazi science in such films is more than just a fantastic plot device. Through empirical science, it introduces the prospect of a Nazi afterlife. As early as the B-movie Revenge of the Zombies (1943), filmmakers were, through the figure of the mad Nazi scientist, already anticipating the ways the Nazi image could be appropriated to speak to very real concerns of the dawning atomic age, including genetic engineering, the politicization of science during the Cold War and the ethical dimensions of how and where we acquire knowledge.\n\nDeviant Sexualities and Deviant Politics: Bitches, Whores and Dominatrices Where these opening chapters point to some of the histories and genealogies of Nazisploitation, the essays in Part II, ‘Bitches, Whores and Dominatrices’, focus on how specific films code Nazis as perverted, sadomasochistic and decadent sexual beings and why these codings are significant. Robert von Dassanowsky’s reading of Tinto Brass’s Salon Kitty (1976) (Chapter 6), David Church’s analysis of Agustín Villaronga’s Tras el cristal (In a Glass Cage, 1986) (Chapter 7), Benedikt Eppenberger’s history of Eine Armee Gretchen (Fräuleins in Uniform, 1972) (Chapter 8) and Elissa Mailänder’s essay on Il portiere di notte (The Night Porter, 1974) all show that there is more than just sex and swastikas to the erotic appeal of Nazis that Susan Sontag dubbed ‘fascinating Fascism’ and that Klaus Theweleit linked to ‘Male Fantasies’.25 In these films, the conflation of fascism and sexuality serves multiple roles beyond simply fathoming the extent to which the Nazis degraded their victims in mind and body. Perhaps most significantly, these films point to the crucial question of what it means to associate fascism with non-normative sexuality. The willingness of Nazisploitation to consider Nazism’s erotic dimensions is in fact a key reason it has become so taboo. As counterintuitive\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 13\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n14 Nazisploitation!\n\nas it may sound, this issue predated not only the Nazisploitation craze, but also the Third Reich and even Nazism itself. In Sex Drives: Fantasies of Fascism in Literary Modernism, literary critic Laura Frost demonstrates the significance of fascist sexual imagery in modernist texts since the end of World War I. Frost’s readings of D.H. Lawrence, Georges Bataille, Hans Bellmer, Sylvia Plath and others show that a false dichotomy has governed approaches to the intersections of fascism and eroticism. This dichotomy is the ostensible gulf between the private nature of the erotic and the public world of the political, or as Frost puts it, ‘Fictions of eroticized fascism contradict the expectation that politics and fantasy are necessarily consistent.’26 In other words, when modernist writers and later Nazisploitation filmmakers eroticized fascism, they exposed, and through hyperbole criticized, a trend still pervasive: the tendency to assume parallels and consistency between private sex lives and public political behavior. And indeed, in the early 1930s, as the National Socialists publically denounced homosexuality, transvestism and other signature moments of interwar Germany’s sexual liberalization, which movie audiences associate with Liza Minnelli’s burlesque performances in Cabaret (1972), their opponents tried to discredit the movement with similar denouncements. They pointed out the known homosexuality and other ‘perverted tendencies’ of individual Nazis, notably SA leader Ernst Röhm.27 Similarly, during World War II, the psychoanalyst Walter Langer speculated in his wartime report to the Office of Strategic Services, later released as The Mind of Adolf Hitler, that Adolf Hitler was a voyeur who might have engaged in homosexual activities and who also derived ‘sexual gratification from the act of having a woman urinate or defecate on him.’28 Indeed, the question ‘Was Hitler gay?’ still intrigues many pundits and observers while the question ‘Why does it matter?’ rarely, if ever, receives scrutiny.29\n\nNazisploitation Today and Tomorrow: Heroes, Villains and the Undead The essays in this book’s final third, ‘Heroes, Villains and the Undead’, all speak to the present and future of Nazisploitation. As the number of people with unmediated relationships to World War II and the Holocaust shrinks and the hold of representational taboos weakens (or at least changes), new generations are producing and consuming new variations on the Nazisploitation theme. In their essays Jeff\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 14\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nHayton and Craig This show how images of metastasized Nazi evil have spread well beyond cinema. In his analysis of the Wolfenstein franchise and other World War II and Nazi-themed first person shooter (FPS) games (Chapter 10), Hayton examines games with plots focusing on jackboot-wearing SS-men, mad scientists, Nazi zombies and other standard Nazisploitation types. The FPS allows gamers to go back in time, confront and kill icons of evil, and personally rewrite history. Nevertheless, even though the FPS empowers gamers as ‘Nazi killers’, this virtual environment is a problematic one. Games frequently take extreme liberties with history and make implicit and often wildly inaccurate claims about historical agency of the perpetrators, bystanders, victims and liberators of World War II and the Holocaust. Hayton shows that, as readily as these games depict all manner of Nazis, the Holocaust remains the ‘elephant in the room’, eerily present yet unacknowledged. In Chapter 11, Craig This examines another lucrative popular medium that, like gaming, appeals strongly but not exclusively to younger audiences: comic books and graphic novels. Through a diachronic study of Marvel Comics’ Captain America, This shows how comic book Nazis have stood in for America’s ideological opponents at specific historical moments. When Captain America originated in the 1940s, Nazis were the enemies, but in the 1950s, for instance, Communists replaced Nazis. But after 9/11 and in an environment where nebulous terrorists cells threaten American supremacy more than antagonist nation states, Marvel Comics returned to Nazi-themed plots. Nazis offered Captain America’s readers what al-Qaeda could not: an iconic embodiment of evil in a recognizable uniform that an American hero could eliminate. The final three essays return to film and powerfully illustrate the extent to which Nazisploitation revisits its own pasts in a wide range of contemporary film practices. The Norwegian Nazi zombie film Død Snø (Dead Snow) appeared in 2009 and soon attracted widespread attention on the independent film festival circuit. In ‘A Past that Refuses to Die: Nazi Zombie Film and the Legacy of Occupation’ (Chapter 12), Sven Jüngerkes and Christiane Wienand read this cult hit as a critique of the legacy of Germany’s occupation of Norway during World War II. Director Tommy Wirkola’s Nazi zombies symbolize a nation’s failure to acknowledge the full extent of their complicity with wartime occupiers. This unmastered past literally comes back from the dead\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 15\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n16 Nazisploitation!\n\nto undermine politically expedient myths of Norwegian national victimhood. With its litany of references to zombie and slasher films, Dead Snow winks knowingly at cinephile audiences. But independent film is not the only cinematic space that revisits Nazisploitation. Much of the contemporary interest in Nazisploitation takes as a reference point Quentin Tarantino’s critically acclaimed, box office hit Inglourious Basterds (2009), which teems with citations of 1960s and 1970s exploitation and war mission films. Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds highlights its director’s ability, demonstrated in Pulp Fiction (1994) and the Kill Bill films (2003, 2004), to recombine the motifs and conceits of low-budget genre films and grindhouse fare. Tarantino unites a montage of cinematic references in a compelling, aesthetically nuanced work that, to borrow the film’s final line, ‘just might be [his] masterpiece.’ Mimmi Woisnitza’s essay (Chapter 13) examines the significance of this latest instance of Tarantino’s borrowing and recycling. Woisnitza shows how Inglourious Basterds cites the different registers of earlier World War II exploitation films, including Nazi fetish, conspiracies, battle spectacles, disguises, subjugation, suspense and vengeance. Where many films inadvertently make fascism ‘fascinating’ through such elements, Woisnitza stresses that Inglourious Basterds uses them more critically, to draw attention to the taint behind any superficial attractiveness of Nazism. In the volume’s final essay (Chapter 14), Michael Fuchs returns to the seedy origins of Nazisploitation. He examines the recrudescence of explicit Nazi-themed sex in recent hardcore pornographic and BDSM films. Through analysis of the pornographic films Dr. Mengele, Gestapo and Gestapo 2 from the Hungarian producer Mood Pictures, Fuchs shows how these recent Nazi sexploitation titles evoke questions about the boundaries between real and performed pain. He examines, for instance, the aporia film scholar Linda Williams pointed out over two decades ago in her ground-breaking work on pornography, whether sexual violence on-screen is a ‘fictional depiction’ or an ‘enacted reality’.30 Whether real or not, protracted on-screen sexual violence raises serious questions about pain, suffering and the voyeuristic pleasure derived from such viewing, all of which bear upon films well beyond the niche of bondage pornography. By way of conclusion, it is worth stressing the obvious: the sheer volume of material that one could include in a book titled Nazisploitation!\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 16\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nThe Nazi Image in Low-Brow Cinema and Culture invariably makes this essay collection incomplete. Additional research might consider Nazisploitation in different media contexts, on television, on the internet, in video game or in contemporary slang. Other studies might consider the use of Nazi tropes in humor, in political discourse and in varied national contexts. Still others might consider continued recurrence of Nazi imagery in different kinds of film. This volume is offered not as the last word on Nazisploitation, but as a scholarly intervention that might provoke further study. To this end, it concludes with a bibliography and filmography that can provide scholars with a solid basis for further intellectual work.

Nazi Exploitation in the Cinema of the 1970s and its Heritage Marcus Stiglegger\n\nHolocaust Cinema and the Sadiconazista Cycle\n\nT\n\nsocial and political events could be considered one possible ‘duty’ of the audiovisual media, in particular narrative television and cinema. The great success, as well as the influence, of TV programs and films such as Holocaust (1979)1 and Schindler’s List (1993) on public opinion about historical events — especially in Germany — strongly suggests that the worldwide audience is more open to fictionalized history than to more challenging essayistic work such as Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah (1985). This realization invites the question: Has cinema reached the status of an historical archive for some audiences? If so, it would behoove film studies scholars to analyze the specific value of such representations, especially in the case of a phenomenon as significant as the Holocaust, which Lanzmann claims is not a suitable subject of fiction.2 The findings of such an analysis, however, may well demonstrate that cinema trivializes rather than represents history. Significantly, it was not historians who made the decisive contribution to the long-term establishment of the problematic term ‘Holocaust’ o reflect on historical,\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 21\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n22 Nazisploitation!\n\n— and the crimes connected with it — in both the European and the North American collective consciousness and memory. Historians may have critically researched sources, documented their findings, published textbooks and produced documentaries on the topic, but when compared to the effect created by one television melodrama, a family saga set against the backdrop of vicious Nazi war crimes, suddenly historians’ efforts seem to have little value other than to confirm the historical accuracy of the scenes of persecution and extermination of ‘imaginary’ figures. The four-part television miniseries Holocaust, followed by around 100 million viewers in the United States, was seen in West Germany one year later by an audience of 16 million. From a media-historic perspective, the television event Holocaust represents a decisive point in the social role of television as a medium of mass communication. German film scholar Knut Hickethier comments on the effects the series had on the formatting of public television as follows: ‘The defining television event at the end of the 1970s was the transmission of the American series Holocaust […] which showed the murder of European Jews by the Germans. In setting its focus not on social criticism and resolving the past, but rather on fictionalization and entertainment, this film marks a turning point […]. The success was considerable, and uncontested. The series was accused of emotionalizing, trivializing and falsifying history.’3 In Germany, Holocaust left a lasting — one could almost say the first — and very deep impression, especially on the sons and daughters of the perpetrator generation. The fact that one can trace this shift in public consciousness back to a commercial television miniseries that intentionally slipped through the customary filter of distanced impartiality is an important indicator of a strong change in the social and media handling of history in general and the history of the Holocaust in particular. From then on, the mass extermination practised under the Nazi regime had a name that everyone knew. The lasting effect of this phenomenon can still be seen today, especially in the many ‘made-for-box-office’ films of the 1980s that attempted to cash in on the success of Holocaust. The change in the televisual handling of this sensitive topic coincided with a general change in attitude towards the subject in cinema. Films were now produced purely on the basis of commercial and aesthetic considerations (dramaturgy, imagery, casting in conjunction with Hollywood’s star system) as opposed to later and earlier attempts at very personal\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 22\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 23\n\naccounts such as Pasażerka (The Passenger, 1962) by Andrzej Munk or The Grey Zone (2001) by Tim Blake Nelson. The fact that among these films were also productions that, by means of a complex narrative, left television far behind, can be seen in films such as Alan J. Pakula’s Sophie’s Choice (1982). However, these more demanding films also fueled the debate that today still questions the legitimacy of an ‘artistic’ processing of the Nazi genocide. According to literary scholar Matías Martínez, art cannot possibly ignore the largest crime of the twentieth century, yet at the same time such art is essentially impossible, ‘[…] because in the opinion of many, the Holocaust defies aesthetic portrayal, in a special, perhaps even unique, way.’4 In this respect Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List marks a turning point. Here, the questionable symbiosis between commercial and ethical production was widely acknowledged by both the public and by critics to have been a success. ‘Unlike Marvin Chomsky and Gerald Green’s Holocaust, the Hollywood film seemed, in the opinion of the critics, to have resolved the conflict between popular reception, aesthetic content and appropriate thematic.’5 Schindler’s List can also be seen as a turning point in another respect. If one looks at the film as a social phenomenon (which it unquestionably was and still is), various modes of interpretation present themselves. First, one can speculate that Schindler’s List marked a provisional climax of a trend that began in the 1970s with the miniseries Holocaust: little by little, a culture of remembrance, which attempted to find access to the events and atmosphere of Nazi terror by way of fictional film and always searched anew for defining methods of staging, established itself next to that of the immediate witnesses of the concentration camp terror, the victims and the perpetrators. Since the 1990s, however, as the witnesses now increasingly withdraw from public life, both new and old films need to be critically analyzed regarding intention and principle. Second, the arrival of Schindler’s List made clear the importance of film as an archive, whose influence on identity formation (for contemporary Jews in this case) in present-day culture is ever growing. If we accept that film, as an archive, exists as a threshold between the cultural and the communicative consciousness, then only by way of critical reflection on the part of the viewer can film be taken seriously as an archive. Beyond its status as cinematic archive and as a marker of a waning ‘culture of remembrance’, there is a third interesting aspect of\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 23\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n24 Nazisploitation!\n\nSchindler’s List: especially in two sequences, Spielberg’s direction refers directly to a cinematic tradition of presenting Nazi characters as a direct sexual threat to the Jewish victims. In fact, SS men were themselves threatened by harsh punishment if they committed such an act of Rassenschande (‘racial disgrace’) as the Nazis put it. Amon Goeth, played by the undeniably attractive and cultivated character actor Ralph Fiennes, appears in one scene practising his shooting skills. He randomly aims at resting people in the camp. With his naked chest, his breeches and boots, he presents this performance as a morning ‘workout’ or routine, included with his first cigarette. When he returns inside, his naked lover is unnerved, and he walks into the bathroom. Physical presence, uniform fetish and inhuman acts of random killing are presented here simultaneously. In a later sequence, Goeth walks into the basement flat of his beautiful Jewish housekeeper during a party. First he seems to adore her beauty — she is half naked, her breasts shimmer through her wet clothing — but his monologue transforms into a cynical parody of Shylock’s defense speech in The Merchant of Venice. He provocatively asks her: ‘Are these the eyes of a rat?’ Although she seems frozen in fear and keeps quiet, he accuses her of trying to seduce him, and then he beats her. Both scenes maintain a certain sexual tension that adds to the violent threat. In both scenes Amon Goeth appears as an ambiguous and darkly attractive tyrant. Spielberg is well aware of the morbid appeal of ambiguous Nazi characters, for he often used them in his films before — especially in the Indiana Jones cycle (beginning in 1981). At the same time, he must have been aware that the sexually attractive yet cruel and cynical SS commander appears almost as a stereotype derived directly from the tradition of the Italian sadiconazista cycle of the 1970s. ‘Sadiconazista’ is a neologism referring to fictional Nazi exploitation pulp literature and cinema between the 1960s and the 1980s composed of the terms ‘sadism,’ ‘con’ (with) and ‘Nazism’. Although marginal during these decades, the influence of sadiconazista stereotypes has proven highly influential in international cinema and pop culture up to today.6\n\nFrom Arthouse Drama to Nazisploitation The 1970s proved an extremely productive decade for many national cinemas: the seeds of former revolutionary years began to grow and brought forth astounding film productions in America (New\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 24\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 25\n\nHollywood), Germany (New German Cinema) and in Japan (New Wave), to name just a few. Together with this new progressive tendency and the simultaneous relaxing of censorship came an enormous wave of exploitation films, which began to push the boundaries of what can be portrayed in the interest of sensationalist entertainment. This exploitative trend did not shy away from the Holocaust theme: the pornographers Robert Lee Frost and Don Edmonds brought their own versions of sadiconazista to the cinema with the Canadian productions Love Camp 7 (1968) and Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1974). These films take a voyeuristic look into the concentration camp brothel and a pseudo-medical experimentation center. Although this exploitative use of Holocaust motifs caused some controversy, these films are still extremely successful in the form of home media.7 The Ilsa film, starring Playboy model Dyanne Thorne, even spawned a number of direct and indirect sequels.8 Italian cinema also experimented with the connections between sexuality, politics and history, albeit on an artistically more ambitious level: Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò (1960) has as its subtext a love story between a very young Jewish inmate and an SS camp guard. Luchino Visconti includes multiple sexual elements in his period family drama La caduta degli dei (The Damned, 1969), which allegorically retells the story of the Krupp industrial empire during its cooperation with Nazi officials. This grand scale epic features child abuse, incest, rape and a homosexual orgy. In her psychodrama Il portiere di notte (The Night Porter, 1974), the former documentarian Liliana Cavani builds on work from her previous documentary series on the Third Reich and tells the story of the fatal reunion of an SS man (Dirk Bogarde) and his former victim (Charlotte Rampling) in the form of an amour fou, an unconditional ‘crazy love’ that has a long history in the conventions of European cinema. As the couple restarts the destructive relationship under now different circumstances, they end up on the execution list of a group of SS veterans, who wish to remove all witnesses to atrocities in order to erase the past and, in so doing, their own guilt. Cavani’s film represents both the continuation of the Nazi mentality after the war as well as an attempt at a psycho-sexual adaptation of the concentration camp system. The depiction of the camp memories is stylized in a monochrome artificial atmosphere devoid of historical reconstruction. The interiors are more reminiscent of theatre stages and empty industrial buildings. In this way, Cavani refers to this past\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 25\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n26 Nazisploitation!\n\nmore as a metaphor and avoids a simple restaging of historical events. In their memories, the protagonists virtually reconstruct their own past as a nightmare landscape of destructive sexuality. Lina Wertmüller’s Pasqualino Settebellezze (Seven Beauties, 1975) takes a more satirical slant: a Sicilian macho man falls into the hands of a female SS thug, who makes him her ‘sex toy’. The film works with a multilayered narrative, a complex montage of timelines that interweave the protagonist’s permanent struggle for survival. The concentration camp is only the final stage in a twisted narration reminiscent of the picaresque novel tradition. From this perspective Wertmüller’s direction unfolds a bitter satire on the desperate human will to survive, with the concentration camp as the place of ultimate threat and degradation. Holocaust survivor Bruno Bettelheim pointed out that the satirical nature of the film, combined with the bizarrely sexualized depiction of the female commandant, distorts the historical archive of the real Holocaust: The camp appears here as a random existential borderline situation.9 Although Pier Paolo Pasolini’s modernized Marquis de Sade adaptation Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975) is a film about the fascist tendencies in Italy of the present day, it is still true — as Pasolini frequently stated — that in this apocalyptic scenario, the film-maker has constructed an oppressive microcosm of the concentration camp system, which was only really understood for the first time when the film was recently re-shown in European cinemas.10 Former censorship bans were lifted (e.g. in England, where the film had not been given a British Board of Film Classification [BBFC] rating before) and the film was available again on special edition DVDs in Italy, France, England and Germany. In the bonus materials, film-makers like Gaspar Noé and Catherine Breillat show appreciation for the film’s huge influence on their own work, while film historians expand on the metaphorical quality of this nihilist manifest. In Salò the mechanisms of power and production have liberated themselves and run amok in the collapsing fascist puppet republic at Lake Garda, where Italian fascists were granted a miniature totalitarian state under Nazi rule during the end of the war. The scandalous success of these three films at the time of their release ultimately inspired the production of a series of concentration campthemed sex films in Italy. Popular examples of these true sadiconazista or Nazisploitation films are: Lager SSadis Kastrat Kommandantur (SS\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 26\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 27\n\nExperiment Camp, 1976), Lager SS 5 — l’inferno delle donne (SS Camp 5 — Women’s Hell, 1976), KZ 9 — lager di stermino (Women’s Camp 119, 1976), La deportate della sezione special SS (Deported Women of the SS Special Section, 1976), L’ultima orgia della Gestapo (The Gestapo’s Last Orgy, 1977), La casa private per le SS (SS Girls, 1977), La bestia in calore (The Beast in Heat, 1977) and La svastika nel ventre (Nazi Love Camp 27, 1977).\n\nExploitation and Sadomasochistic Fantasies It seems evident that all the films mentioned above in one way or another develop a sadomasochistic model based on the principles of totalitarian politics and hierarchies. At first sight they seem to take the simple (and wrong) equation of sadomasochism and fascistic politics as a given. This phenomenon of mingling politics and sadomasochistic sexuality has been referred to as ‘il sadiconazista’ in Italy, specifically in relation to the Italian pulp fiction of the 1960s, where sexuality, cruelty and fascist politics mingled in exploitative and pornographic entertainment fare in a way very similar to the equally popular ‘Stalag’ novels in Israel at that time. It seems useful to transfer this term to the filmic medium, especially as the exploitative films in the wake of The Night Porter excessively expanded on the unhistorical equation of sadomasochism and totalitarian politics. This also marks the huge difference between the reflected arthouse films of Cavani, Wertmüller and Pasolini compared to the exploitation films of Sergio Garrone, Cesare Canevari, Bruno Mattei and Rino di Silvestro, which were produced immediately after the success of Salò. These exploitation films cash in on the same basic model but simply skip the reflective and metaphorical aspect of their forerunners. The English term ‘exploitation’ already marks the technique of ‘exploiting’ a serious topic such as the Holocaust, the inquisition, the slavery system, prostitution or simply life in prison to reduce it to pure sexual or violent content.11 Especially in the late 1960s, when the rules of censorship were handled more liberally worldwide, there came a wave of exploitation films, many of them combining sexuality and violence in a way that resulted in semi-sadomasochistic psychodrama. In many cases we can find a commercially successful forerunner being copied afterwards on a cheaper production level. What happened to Cavani’s and Pasolini’s films in Italy can also be proven by the\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 27\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n28 Nazisploitation!\n\nwitch hunter cycle following Michael Reeve’s British production The Witchfinder General (1968) or the slave dramas copying Richard Fleischer’s Southern melodrama Mandingo (1975). The financial success of both films resulted in respective cycles of witch-hunter- and slave-camp-themed exploitation films ripping off the basic standards and characters of the prototypes. Between 1968 and 1982, certain film directors specialized in making exploitation films, and production companies focused on the evergrowing market, notably Fulvia and S.E.F.I. Cinematografica in Italy, Eurocine in France and Erwin C. Dietrich in Switzerland, to name but a few. All of them became involved in making women-in-prison movies, sometimes also dealing with sadiconazista elements. Most of the sadiconazista exploitation films were not shown in cinemas or on video in Germany due to censorship restrictions, but some of them turned up as main examples in the British ‘video nasties’ debate of the early 1980s, when violent films on videocassette were seized by the police and censored for two decades due to concerns about protecting juvenile viewers. Some titles are still banned in Great Britain, and it will come as no surprise that sadiconazista titles are among these.12 Phil Hardy takes Sergio Garrone’s SS Camp 5 — Women’s Hell as a stand-in for all the sadiconazista films of the time: The box-office success of Liliana Cavani’s picture about the pleasures of being tortured in a Nazi concentration camp, The Night Porter (1974) and, in America, the repulsively adolescent and racist torture-camp movies of Don Edmonds (Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, 1974), triggered the nostalgic fantasies of explicit as well as cryptofascists, spawning a filmic equivalent of the established literary porn sub-genre, ‘il sadiconazista’. Garrone contributed two filmic atrocities to this variation on the woman’s prison movies, Lager SSadis Kastrat Kommandantur (SS Experiment Camp, 1976) and the one from 1974 which simply exploits ‘entertaining’ thrills such as Jewish women being undressed and divided into prostitutes and victims of medical atrocities. There is the obligatory Nazi lesbian, a crude abortion scene and a hefty smattering of assorted tortures.13\n\nThis entry is remarkable because the simple categorizing of sadiconazista films as a subgenre of horror films suggests a certain perspective: These films may simply be seen as horrible fantasy. In any case, this\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 28\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 29\n\nperspective does not prove to be very illuminating. There is more to this trend than that.\n\nNazisploitation and Pornography In several reviews of the time, sadiconazista films were labeled pornographic. The term ‘pornographic’ is a problematic one, especially in this context on the borderline between exploitation and hard-core cinema. It seems more accurate to call most of the sadiconazista films ‘sexploitation’. The goal of these films is to entertain the viewer with a carnivalesque mixture of historical settings, some sadistic violence, moments of repulsion, and fetishistic use of costumes and simulated sex. Some of these elements also appear in the hard-core films of the 1970s (e.g. Bordel SS, 1978, by José Bénazéraf), which additionally feature non-simulated sex, while most sadiconazista films do not. In some countries, films like Gestapo’s Last Orgy were released in alternative versions featuring additional scenes of hard-core sex not shot originally for the respective movies. Hard-core director Joe D’Amato later released Le bambole del Führer (The Führer’s Dolls, 1995), a nearly plotless adult film with Nazi uniforms that nevertheless does not depict any atrocities or camp elements. But generally, the short cycle of Italian sadiconazista films between 1976 and 1978 work on the level of soft-core erotic entertainment. In contrast, a high-art film like Pasolini’s Salò is actually closer to Susan Sontag’s definition of pornography as an aesthetic convention within the arts, which she outlined in her 1969 essay, ‘The Pornographic Imagination’. Films and novels ‘qualify as pornographic texts insofar as their theme is an all-engrossing sexual quest that annihilates every consideration of persons extraneous to their roles in the sexual dramaturgy, and the fulfillment of this quest is depicted graphically.’14 As in Georges Bataille’s transgressive prose (like ‘The Story of the Eye’), Sontag stresses that the truly obscene in artistic pornography will always show a certain connection to death. In this sense she points out the special meaning of sacred rituals, the rite of passage, and the sacrifice within pornographic contexts. Pornography therefore has a ritualistic structure, whereas sexploitation cinema only bears rudimentary traces of such elements.15 Concerning the exploitative sadiconazista phenomenon, one can state that these films neither carry a political message nor do they\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 29\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n30 Nazisploitation!\n\nrepresent real pornography or even violent pornography. Phil Hardy goes too far in his assumptions about the target audience (‘explicit as well as crypto-fascists’: see above). These films simply try to reduce their artistic forerunners — Il portiere di notte, Seven Beauties, Salò and Visconti’s The Damned — to a sadomasochistic fantasy of entertainment created out of a purely imaginative destruction drive. Historical elements as well as true sadomasochistic dialectics are abused here and transformed for this aim.16 Susan Sontag has also reflected extensively on the fetishizing of Nazi symbolism and iconography in sadomasochistic rituals in her essay ‘Fascinating Fascism II’: In pornographic literature, films and gadgetry throughout the world, especially in the United States, England, France, Japan, Scandinavia, Holland and Germany, the SS has become a referent of sexual adventurism. Much of the imagery of far-out sex has been placed under the sign of Nazism. Boots, leather, chains, Iron Crosses on gleaming torsos, swastikas, along with meat hooks and heavy motorcycles have become the secret and most lucrative paraphernalia of eroticism. […] But why? Why has Nazi Germany, which was a sexually repressive society, become erotic?17\n\nSontag writes this — taking into consideration a military-themed book called ‘SS Regalia’ — to reflect further on the erotic attraction of the SS uniform. For an answer, one might consider what fashion historian Valerie Steele writes in her book Fetish (1996). Commenting on the well-known fact that military uniforms are treated as a sexual fetish, Steele states: ‘Military uniforms are probably the most popular prototype for the fetishist uniform because they signify hierarchy (some command, others obey), as well as membership of what was traditionally an all-male group whose function involves the legitimate use of physical violence’.18 The uniform seems to be an abstraction of the martial in the form of fashion. It symbolizes belonging to an elite and embodies dominance and attraction. The black service tunic of the SS in particular can be seen as the ambitious attempt to combine eccentric chic, elitist elegance and death symbolism. But as Sontag remarks: ‘[…] uniforms are not the same thing as photographs of uniforms, which are erotic material, and photographs of SS uniforms are the units of a\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 30\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 31\n\nparticularly powerful and widespread sexual fantasy.’19 Although her essay concerns a military antiques fact-book, this idea also applies to the appearance of SS uniforms in the cinema of the 1970s. In the context of entertainment, the presence of SS uniforms in narrative film has its own rules of reception, in contrast to the documentary, for example. Sontag suspects that the dramatic pathos of the SS uniform serves as the basis of this presumed effect: ‘SS uniforms were stylish, well-cut, with a touch (but not too much) of eccentricity.’20 Not only sadiconazista films refer to the dramatic effect of the SS uniform. There are also plenty of examples from different genres that have used its sexually charged appeal: Star Wars (1976) by George Lucas, Ken Russell’s biopic Mahler (1976), Alan Parker’s Pink Floyd — The Wall (1981), Richard Loncraine’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s Richard III (1995), Paul Verhoeven’s science fiction satire Starship Troopers (1997) and the Casablanca parody Barb Wire (1995) by David Hogan, to name but a few.\n\nThe Typology of sadiconazista The films connected to the sadiconazista trend can be divided by their motivations into various groups: a. Films that try to create some basic assumptions about fascist systems (e.g. La caduta degli dei, Salò). b. Films that choose the totalitarian compulsory system as a radical and frightening historical background, against which interpersonal obsessions are played out: e.g. in The Night Porter, Liliana Cavani tells the story of a passionate relationship merged with dominance and repression. This relationship is emotionally charged by the historical background, heavily loaded by the viewer’s knowledge. c. Films that advance the totalitarian compulsory system as a dramaturgical justification to wallow in sadomasochistic excesses: Sergio Garrone, the veteran Italian director of Lager SS 5, has stated in an interview that it is only possible to justify the drastic nature of the pictured cruelty if one is basing it on that historical background (i.e., National Socialism).21 What all these films share is the connection between sexual contexts and stereotyped images of National Socialism. The relationship\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 31\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n32 Nazisploitation!\n\nbetween the executioner and the victim is sadomasochistically transfigured and transferred on to the level of sexual passion. The result is a de-politicizing and de-historicizing of National Socialism. It is therefore possible to turn the image of National Socialism into a plaything of pop aesthetics within the laws of pop culture. What is especially striking here is the annihilation of chronology in some of the works discussed: Lina Wertmüller’s Seven Beauties, as well as Cavani’s The Night Porter and her later film Interno Berlinese (The Berlin Affair, 1985), are told in intricate and convoluted flashbacks; the historical component is transferred to the subjective and therefore ‘optional’ world of the single protagonist’s memory. Thus it reaches a nearly mythical quality that no longer allows the viewer to approach the phenomenon historically. The concentration camps in Seven Beauties and The Night Porter look like Dantesque limbos, filled with existential and sexual nightmares. Yet, as far away as the exploitative scenarios of the sadiconazista cycle may be from the National Socialist reality, it may still be possible to recognize a sequence of standardized scenes based on historically documented situations. These scenes recur in all the thematically relevant films: the arrival of the concentration camp prisoners and the selection on the platform; the roll call on the open areas between the barracks; the actions in the brothel camps; the disastrous punishments and tortures (it is here that some critics observe the sadomasochistic appeal); executions; medical experiments; massacre. From a comparative study it is obvious that those elements appear as frequently in artistically ambitious films as they do in exploitative films. Thus, on the level of pure content and action, these films share more similarities than might first appear.\n\nCase Study: The Night Porter I would like to illustrate these three points by taking a closer look at Cavani’s The Night Porter. When the young wife of a conductor, Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), recognizes the hotel night porter Max (Dirk Bogarde) as an SS officer who had enslaved her in the concentration camp, the incident breaks up her marriage. Her husband leaves for Frankfurt, and she rebounds with Max after some agitated doubts. Because some other former Nazis recognize in her a potentially threatening witness from the past, they demand that Max kill Lucia, an order\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 32\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 33\n\nhe refuses to follow. Instead, he withdraws with her to the loneliness of his small apartment, and they turn in isolation from the outer world. His former comrades besiege the house and threaten Lucia. After a time full of privation the as-good-as-dead couple leaves the apartment, and both are shot at dawn on a Danube bridge. It seems that the lovers’ path can lead only to their common death, following the tradition of amour fou. Both lovers in The Night Porter devote themselves to complete stylization (he in his fancy black uniform, she in her childlike dress). From this point on they live completely in their common past again. It is the place of death — a lonely steel bridge at dawn — that functions as the locus for a rite of passage. Cavani seems to suggest that there is a world for lovers, but it is not ours. It is also the camera that departs from the action, right at that moment. The place of action turns into something stage-like, the protagonists into small figures who fit right into the outlines of their surroundings. It seems less important to the director to develop a political microcosm than to design a plausible mechanism for an unconditional desire. Every step of the encounter between Max and Lucia takes the role of a key scene, and far more drastically than usual in the genre of melodrama. Many actions and incidents become allegorical and mythic. It is the desire that seems unconditional and, in the end, brings the surrender. It seems significant that even destructive acts of love serve as proof of their passion, the best example being the break-up of Lucia and her husband when she recognizes the hopelessness of her desire. Only one experience of pain seems appropriate when it comes to the intensity of her feelings: when Max enters the hotel room for the first time, he slaps Lucia in the face. Later they make love on a bathroom floor covered by broken glass, another metaphor for their frenzy. When Max visits his former lover Bert, who is gay, the meeting culminates in a strange sort of ballet at the beginning of the film. Max — using a single haunting spotlight — aims it to cast light upon the silent gestures of the dancer who, though now old, still seems delicate and even somewhat youthful. Whereas Max acts like a spooky puppeteer surrounded by shadows, Bert dedicates his elegant gestures to him. This homoerotic ballet takes the same position as in a comparable scene in an erotic biopic about Friedrich Nietzsche that Cavani made in 1976, Al di la del bene e del male (Beyond Good and Evil) in which Nietzsche watches a homoerotic ballet. We also find here the clear\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 33\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n34 Nazisploitation!\n\nisolation of characters who can only embody their own cosmos. It is an isolation of characters based on the relativization of their social relationships; even in The Night Porter, these relationships are reduced to the pragmatic (mainly professional), and they lack an emotional ground that is then violently reclaimed within the amour fou. The relationship between Max and Bert is also affected by a vague gentle compassion that contrasts with the established circumstances and can therefore only flourish secretly. When those relationships come out in the open, a doomed chain reaction results. The film hints that Bert may shoot the couple simply out of jealousy. Besides Cavani’s The Night Porter, there are in fact very few films depicting sadomasochistic sexuality that manage to be so fatally convincing in creating such a microcosm. After its scandal is long forgotten, it may be the right time to re-discover this great and multilayered melodrama, a film truly located ‘beyond good and evil’, for it focuses on the seemingly ‘impossible’ romantic relationship of hangman and victim. Or, as Max says in the middle of the film: ‘Sane — insane — sane? Who’s to judge?’ An emblematic classic of the sadiconazista cycle, this film successfully walks the line between arthouse drama and Nazisploitation.\n\nContinuation of the sadiconazista Trend To sum up, it can be said that the Italian exploitation film of the 1970s is one that pursued and ratcheted up the stereotyping of images from National Socialism and the Holocaust, even if these films only got lukewarm support from the mainstream media and audiences. The Canadian film Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS became emblematic of the sadiconazista cycle as remembered today. More than any of the Italian exploitation films of that time, Ilsa delivers a trademark heroine embodied by the former nude model Dyanne Thorne. Later Ilsa became a series with several sequels, two official and one unofficial (Ilsa, The Wicked Warden, 1976, by Jess Franco), a fact that made Ilsa a persistent cult icon. It fulfils all the formerly described categories, has been released in a DVD boxed set, and its logos even appear on T-shirts. There is no debate as to whether sadiconazista stereotypes have left an impact, because they certainly have: even Steven Spielberg has evoked similar mechanisms in Schindler’s List without directly referring to the sadiconazista cycle. Pure sadiconazista may be a curiosity of the\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 34\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nCinema beyond Good and Evil? 35\n\ntransgressive 1970s cinema, but the sexualization of the Nazi torturer has installed itself deeply within the contemporary and pop-cultural consciousness in Europe,22 Japan23 and America24. It has therefore also become a part of the historical archive. Ultimately the huge influence of the sadiconazista cycle is still visible in later productions like Paul Verhoeven’s Black Book (2006) or even Robert Young’s Eichmann (2007), where aspects of sexuality, sadomasochism and fascistic politics again mingle, which the latter film obsessively seeks to prove, therefore changing a well-established idea about fascist characters. Eichmann (Thomas Kretschmann) was in no way the ‘banality of evil’ (Hannah Arendt). In ‘fact’ — as the film shows — he was involved in a sexualized frenzy and was seduced by a Hungarian baroness. To conclude, I would like to use a polemic comment by Michel Foucault in 1976 about the sadiconazista phenomenon: This is a massive misapprehension about history. Nazism was not brought about by the crazy folk of Eros in the twentieth century; instead it was brought about by bourgeois people, and by that I mean the nastiest, stiffest and most disgusting ones that one can imagine. Himmler was some sort of a farmer who married a nurse. One has to consider that the idea of the concentration camps resulted from the fantasies of the shared illusions of a nurse and a hen-breeder. Millions of people have been killed there, so I’m not saying that in order to devitalize the accusations which have to be made against this operation, but rather to disenchant it from the erotic values one combines it with.25\n\nOr, as the German journalist Martin Büsser writes, ‘occidental society has taken in de Sade to such a degree that they can only imagine it now as the last form of loose sexual freedom in the form of fascist tortures und murders. How poor is our supply on education!’26 Notes 1\n\n2 3 4\n\nPeter Märthesheimer and Ivo Frenzel, eds, Im Kreuzfeuer: Der Fernsehfilm Holocaust.

France had its own share of real Nazi-exploitation in the 1970s like Train special pour SS (Helltrain, 1977) by Alain Payet. And in England a war film like The Passage (1979) by J.

Richardson\n\nI\n\nwould like to start with two films and two female concentration camp officers: both are responsible for horrific deaths of their inmates, both are portrayed as highly sexual figures, frequently shown nude and engaged in intercourse. One beds and then castrates her male prisoners, while the other is a pedophile who seduces and abandons a sick teenage boy. Both are ultimately subjugated, in one way or another, by male heroes. By the films’ respective ends, both protagonists are dead, neither having expressed remorse, or much remorse, for their crimes. It is here that the similarities end. Reviewers excoriated the first film, admittedly explicit in its depiction of sex and violence, as nauseatingly gory and excessively sleazy, while the other was widely — though not uniformly — praised, and it went on to secure an Oscar for its lead actress Kate Winslet. Certainly the first film, Don Edmonds’s 1974 sexploitation picture Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, did wallow in excess, with repeated and graphic scenes of torture, mutilation, rape and sexual perversion. The acting was wooden, the dialog stilted, and the overall result an accurate reflection of the film’s low-budget nature. Loosely based on the real person of Ilsa Koch, the infamous wife of a commandant of Buchenwald and Majdanek, and featuring Dyanne Thorne as the buxom title character, the film depicted the depraved events at a\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 38\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nSexual Deviance and the Naked Body in Cinematic Representations of Nazis 39\n\nNazi death camp in the final days of World War II. Determined to prove that women could withstand more pain than men, Ilsa conducts numerous gruesome and sadistic experiments on female prisoners. At night, she forces male inmates to sleep with her, castrating or killing them the next day when they fail to satisfy her libidinal needs. Ilsa’s perversions are so extreme that a German general who inspects the camp orders it to be destroyed (though only after indulging in his own sexual fetishes the night before). Even so, only after Wolfe, a halfGerman, half-American, arrives and subjugates Ilsa sexually can the prisoners revolt and exact their revenge. The film was a cult classic that spawned several sequels — Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks (1976); Ilsa, the Wicked Warden (1977); and Ilsa the Tigress of Siberia (1977) — none of which matched the first for its outrageousness or success. The Reader (2008), in contrast, was an adaptation of a successful and highly lauded novel of the same title by Bernhard Schlink, and featured A-list actors and production values typical of a Hollywood prestige piece. The film recounts the story of Michael Berg, a German lawyer who, as a teenager, had an affair with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz. Hanna disappears one day, leaving Michael heartbroken and bitter, only to re-emerge many years later as a defendant in a war crimes trial. Though she has apparently confessed to allowing 300 Jewish women to die in a burning church, Michael deduces that she is illiterate and has allowed herself to be blamed, lest her secret be discovered. Though Michael is silent about the secret during the trial, he later sends her recordings of books, so that she may learn to read and write in prison. The night before Hanna is to be freed, she commits suicide, leaving Michael a note and her life savings, asking him to donate it to the daughter of a survivor. Though the romance between the teenager Michael Berg and the former camp guard Hanna Schmitz is an integral part of their relationship and his emotional development (or lack thereof), the film’s primary concern is a meditation on the nature of guilt and responsibility. At first glance then, the comparison of the two films based on a narrow set of criteria seems a bit disingenuous. But what these films have in common goes beyond the sort of reductive description with which I began above, something that links many representations of the Nazi era, both high- and low-brow, namely a preoccupation with the eroticized images of Nazism. Certainly historians and critics have\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 39\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n40 Nazisploitation!\n\ncovered well the erotic or libidinal component to the dynamics and appeal of Nazism. In his analysis of fascist propaganda, for example, Theodor Adorno uses Freud’s conception of group psychology, which described the bond between leader and mass and among the members of a mass as libidinal in nature.1 Explaining how Hitler’s charismatic appeal could be understood in terms of these dynamics, Adorno argued that Hitler was aware of this libidinal source of mass formation, often ascribing specifically female, passive features to the participants at his rallies so as to bind himself further as fascist leader to the masses. Crucial here, however, is that the libidinal energy that links the fascist leader to the masses is kept on an unconscious level so as to divert its manifestations in a way suitable for political ends.2 For Hitler, this meant shunning the traditional role of the loving father and replacing it with the threatening authority figure, hearkening back to the notion of the pre-Oedipal primal father, who functions as an object of identification for the masses. Narcissistic identification, understood as an act of devouring, plays a central role here, as the follower sees the beloved leader as part of the subject’s own personality, ‘a collective projection of himself, rather than the image of the father.’3 In modern society, people generally have to come to terms with the continuous failure to satisfy individually idealized ego demands; by making the leader into an idealized ego, the follower can love himself without restraint, and by being one of a number of individuals who have substituted the same object for their ego ideal, he can become part of a fascist community whose bonds with one another are strengthened by narcissism. Other theorists have taken this analysis one step further by arguing that the appeal of Nazism is not only based on the sublimation of unconscious libidinal desire, but is also reflective of the ‘irrational’ nature4 or even pathological character of Hitler’s supporters. In his seminal work on the Freikorps, Klaus Theweleit argues that it was not the sexual appeal of Hitler that brought men to Nazism, but rather their own predisposition to violence, stemming from a deep misogyny and fear of castration.5 Insight into the role of libidinal desire is certainly crucial to understanding both the appeal of Nazism and the persistence of eroticized representations of German fascism. However, what I am concerned with here are those eroticized representations of Hitler and Nazism for which this association of Nazism and sexuality is a non-essentialist one, that is to say, representations whose focus is not merely a critique\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 40\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\nSexual Deviance and the Naked Body in Cinematic Representations of Nazis 41\n\nof the psychosexual dynamics of fascism, but which instead marshal erotic imagery in the service of an ostensible critique of Nazism on broader moral grounds. On a certain level we have to understand these associations as having very little to do with Hitler and the Nazis and very much to do with ideological intentions. Laura Frost argues that it is the notion of a culturally shared ideal of respectability central to the construction of a modern European national identity, an identity that requires the classification of certain sexual behaviors as deviant or abnormal.6 As Frost notes, such standards of sexual normality were central not only to the Nazis, but to their opponents as well — hence the mutual designation of one’s opponent as homosexual or sexually deviant. In her analysis, this eroticization of fascism responds to specific discussions of the enemy that arose following World War I, whereby democracy was aligned with a respectful and non-violent heterosexuality, while those sexualities that did not adhere to this norm — sadomasochistic eroticism, or even male homosexuality — were designated as ‘fascist’. In the present discussion, I would like to expand this argument further and investigate the extent to which it can be applied in the decades following World War II, indeed up until the present day. Nazism, though continually linked to ‘deviant’ forms of sexuality, also functions less as its own subject and more as a means for assertions about sexuality and normalcy as they define the dominant cultural context.7 What I contend is that not just Nazisploitation films but even mainstream films about Nazis share a certain logic whereby the judgment of Nazis as morally deficient for their perpetration of Holocaust atrocities extends into all other realms of their character and behavior, particularly as it concerns sexuality. To be a Nazi means to be engaged in a variety of sexual practices coded as deviant — incest, sadomasochism, paedophilia, homosexuality — with the morally good protagonist as unwilling victim. However, while the protagonist is a clear figure of identification for viewers, the films’ treatment of the respective bodies of Nazis and their victims involves them in a more complicated relationship with this ostensibly immoral sexuality. Before facilitating the inevitable rejection of Nazi sexuality and reinforcement of the viewers’ own moral superiority, these films thematically ally viewers with the abject and often naked victim, while visually allying them with the gaze of the Nazi perpetrator. This filmic logic affords viewers a double moment of vicarious enjoyment as both\n\n9781441110602_txt_print.indd 41\n\n12/10/2011 11:50\n\n42 Nazisploitation!\n\ninitiators and recipients of a taboo sexual act. Both mainstream and exploitation genre films simultaneously release viewers from, and reinforce, sexual inhibitions, ultimately making highly conservative and regressive judgments about sexual norms, behavior and identity, particularly as it pertains to female sexuality. The association of Nazism and Hitler with a perverse sexuality was present in the earliest critical reactions to the Third Reich. Some of this linkage was ostensibly based in fact, though without real corroboration — Hitler’s possibly sexual relationship with his niece Geli Raubal, for example — some of it mere conjecture, such as Hitler’s presumed monorchidism or lack of a second testicle. It often took the form of serious discourse, such as Rodney Colin’s 1934 essay, ‘Hitlerism as a Sex Problem’, which argued that Germans turned to Hitler as the result of a mass, generational ‘sex starvation’, or Dr Walter C. Langer’s psychoanalytic study of Hitler for the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, The Mind of Adolf Hitler, which concluded that Hitler had an extremely perverse sexual psychopathology.8 Accusations of homosexuality were, as George Mosse has noted, particularly widespread in anti-fascist discourse; despite the Nazis’ persecution of homosexuals, anti-fascists often co-opted the Nazis’ own language to argue that Nazi leadership was a clique of homosexuals, not ‘real men’ of the sort who fought the fascists in Spain.9 This linkage also took the form of high and low art: everything from the pornographic comic books known as Tijuana Bibles10 to popular film incorporated sexual elements deemed deviant — homosexuality, cross-dressing, sadism and masochism, coprophagia, urolagnia, rape, incest and pedophilia — and ascribed them to Hitler and the Nazis. In The Great Dictator (1941), Chaplin’s Adenoid Hynkel may have been merely buffoonish, but more often than not, Hitler and the Nazis were alternately effeminate and flamboyant or monstrous sexual predators. Frequently, this found expression in a violent sort of sexuality. The climactic scene of Edward Dymytrk’s 1943 film Hitler’s Children, for example, involves a public flogging of the film’s doomed heroine, Anna, publicity stills of which prominently feature this scene or other images of a Nazi with a whip terrorizing a young girl "
