        "text": "This article was prepared in part with assistance from some members of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers.\n\nSexpionage\n\n“You cannot deny the existence of hell. You live in it. It is a place without love.”\n\n…says the kindly old Father Benedetto to George Clooney’s character, who trusts the wrong woman, in The American. (2010 — director, Anton Corbijn).\n\nWhile spying is perhaps the world’s second oldest profession here it mates frequently with the world’s oldest. Sexpionage targets the eternal human desire to be loved and understood. Stakes are high in a world where factions lust for any advantage over political and business adversaries. Sex is effectively used as a method for recruiting spies and capturing secrets when targets display a high need for intimacy.\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that we are striving to extract a certain element of realistic and professional penetration into this subject. For instance, no James Bond films made our list because we’re talking about real spying, and in the immortal words of Roger Moore,\n\n“You can’t be a real spy and have everybody in the world know who you are and what your drink is. That’s just hysterically funny.”\n\nThe objective of an effective spy is to present himself in such a way that you’ll never see them coming. This article isn’t yet another listicle of “favorite” spy films, the aim here is to go backstage, to take us on a tour of a constellation of real world challenges that our films only hint at.\n\nSpying can be a dirty business. Governmental clandestine agencies the world over use sex for seduction, intimacy, distraction, cover story and incentive. The CIA has said that “as long as there is sex, it is going to be used” in intelligence. The Agency has even added to its officers’ bookshelf Nigel West’s 2009 work Historical Dictionary of Sexpionage.\n\nMost westerners spending time in Moscow are targeted by either attractive young Russian swallows (females) and/or ravens (males). These operations are called honeypotting. The targets are diplomats, security personnel, businessmen, journalists…all those with access of interest to the Russian Security Services. In Red Sparrow (2018-director, Francis Lawrence) Jennifer Lawrence portrays a ballerina recruited to Sparrow School, a formal training installation for swallows and ravens. Unmentioned in the film is that it is based on State School 4 which was located on the banks of the Volga River not far from Moscow. Now disbanded, the Russians have turned to the use of contractors for these sultry operations. And they are good at it.\n\nWith impressive success, the Russians have targeted — and this is a mere sampling — such people as US Embassy Marine guards, assorted foreign nationals, homosexual employees of the NSA and diplomats of various countries, some of whom committed suicide rather than face the shame of being exposed to their friends, family, colleagues and country.\n\nChina also is using honeytraps effectively and is currently aiming them at the acquisition of sensitive industrial, pharmaceutical and defense information in the United States’ think tanks, corporations, academic institutions, laboratories, venture capitalists, and especially high-technology firms. Their targets are vulnerable executives, engineers and researchers. The operatives are generally beautiful, young, Chinese expat women who are students, scientists and not themselves intelligence officers, but tasked as elicitation specialists. In other words, their job is to get their product lines to talk too much. Better yet, they are encouraged to get valuable documents and schematics to their handlers. China currently represents the gravest of counterintelligence threats to the United States.\n\nBut, before we break out the popcorn and settle in to screen a couple of films, let’s pause for a short course in spy school.\n\nWhat makes humans so susceptible to this approach? As people become more successful, as they rise in governmental or business organizations, they are entrusted with greater responsibilities, power, and access to the secrets of the enterprise.\n\nGreater attainment often brings with it intensified feelings of detachment and loneliness as “lateral” relationships, once enjoyed among co-workers, begin to dissolve due to the necessities of leadership. You’re no longer invited out for nights with the boys or girls, no longer included within their circles of trust and gossip, no longer included in chats around the water cooler. It’s lonely at the top.\n\nTrust is hard to come by. Leaders don’t have the luxury of it because subordinates often have ulterior motives that adversely affect good decision making.\n\nThese folks are prime targets. Here are espionage techniques that would prove effective against their interests and weaknesses.\n\nFirst, is that the operative approaches their target showing vulnerability. This might be accomplished with a private, embarrassing admission. Eye-catching people are innately able to waylay victims. Done correctly, they perilously build their trust. The target feels in control of a vulnerable person since they’re unlikely to present a threat.\n\nSecond, mentorship is sought. It appeals to the mark’s ego and requires them to professorially convey important information. The victim gives more and more intelligence. The target is now becoming what is known as a developmental.\n\nThirdly, often older, successful men are susceptible to adoration by beautiful, younger people. The reason for this is it is a sign —eye contact, physical compliments, innocent touches on the arm, demonstrating the recognition and acceptance of the senior, accomplished person. And that magically somehow, age, marital status, health, wealth or circumstance, doesn’t matter. As with mentorship, the developmental is tempted to beguile the adoring accolite with justification for their growing adoration thereby preserving it, and hopefully — on the part of the adversarial intelligence service — at all costs. Tragically, giving out government or trade secrets are often an end-point, a demonstration of the targets’ power and legitimacy as an object of this continued adoration.\n\nLastly (to quote someone who schooled me on the corrosive effects of certain forms of corrupt behavior), sexpionage effectively produces the threat of a hidden secret that is always there, adultery, and it’s always something that can be used to threaten even a currently unmarried victim. It’s something that doesn’t go away.\n\nThese four techniques soften developmentals up for the sexual liaison. We call this stuff tradecraft.\n\nSpy films may seem fictional vehicles but even the most absurd and comedic can have unexpected geopolitical and dangerous import. In the 2014 film The Interview (director, Evan Goldberg) two journalists (played by Seth Rogan playing Aaron Rappaport, and James Franco — Dave Skylark) are recruited, through honeypotting, by the CIA’s agent Lacey, to “take out” North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in an upcoming televised interview scheduled with him in Pyongyang.\n\nLacy appeals to the famous Skylark’s preferences in a woman. As we come to see in a later scene, she had transformed her looks dramatically to recruit him via a calculated “nasty librarian” fetish seduction. The Interview deals with heterosexual and homosexual (honeydicking as they call it in the flick) tradecraft, but more than just a tad in the direction of far-fetched spying encounters. Lacy had done good on her homework and skillfully advanced on the journalist. With Rappaport and Skylark now enrolled successfully as new assassins, off to North Korea they go. So, you get the general idea of the setup for the film. Right?\n\nAnd then it all went wrong.\n\nKim took it all very seriously. In response to the film’s pre-production, North Korea threatened action against the United States, describing the picture as “an act of war” if it was ever released by Sony. Terrorist attacks against theaters showing the picture ultimately resulted in most major theater chains canceling screenings. President Barack Obama and the US State Department became involved. Resulting in significant damage, Sony Pictures Entertainment was brazenly hacked by what the FBI claimed was a state-sponsored group of cyber-spies. Rogan and Franco had to cancel their public appearances due to concerns for their personal safety.\n\nI’ll offer this behind-the-scenes aside. The assassination method would not have worked. The plan was to affix a transdermal adhesive to the palm that would deliver, in a handshake, a small amount of the highly toxic poison called ricin to Kim. While ricin has been used before by kill teams, the molecular size is too large to be absorbed through the skin. But what unnerved the North Korean regime was not Kim’s over-the-top planned killing method, but rather his portrayal as a ludicrous figure in the eyes of his people should bootlegged copies of the movie make their way into the country.\n\nAutocrats are sometimes allergic to jocularity. North Korea doesn’t own the exclusive on this.\n\nOften the objective of sexpionage operations is not assassination but for deception and cover story. Compromised into working for the OSS (forerunner of the CIA) in WWII, American-born Swedish oilman Erik Erickson had a successful business transacting fuel supplies with Nazi Germany from neutral Sweden. This put him in a unique position to gather information on Nazi petroleum production. His story is memorialized in The Counterfeit Traitor (1962-director, George Seaton). This film is not to be missed and it is a true story.\n\nPlayed by William Holden, Erickson meets his German contact Frau Marianne Mollendorf (Lilli Palmer) during one of his many trips inside the Third Reich. In current CIA parlance she is his reports officer taking information Erickson gathered from his preferential access, and passing it along to London operations. They needed reason to cover their frequent meetings if surveilled by the Abwehr’s (German Military Intelligence) counter-intelligence section. A sexual relationship between the two married agents was feigned to provide cover for their frequent clandestine meetings. While dead drops are often used to communicate information between two agents, due to the lengthy briefings required to download the substance of Erickson’s highly complex, gathered intel sexpionage was instead chosen as a more suitable “live drop” method.\n\nHolden’s character had no diplomatic immunity if apprehended for spying. He was operating under what is termed: non-official cover, or NOC for short. There is no more dangerous job in the intelligence world than this. Readers may be aware of a real life NOC in the Valerie Plame affair.\n\nIf exposed, Erickson and Mollendorf would almost certainly suffer torture, execution and a denial from any country of its involvement. Operating as a NOC is exhausting. Conversations, names, dates, places have to be committed to memory for relatively long periods of time before being able to report back the information. Erickson made contact high up in the Reich and was granted privileged entry to fuel storage and jet and rocket fuel production facilities. Subsequent to their many “liaisons” the ideologically motivated Mollendorf relayed the technical specifics — with exacting mapped locations — to London for bombers to effectively grind Germany’s war machine to a near standstill. Rockets, planes and tanks rely on fuel to run, of course.\n\nIn time, Erickson and Mollendorf fell in love for real. Sexpionage proved an effective method of deception but it eventually weakened under the watchful eyes of German agents tailing them both.\n\nIt ended tragically.\n\nShe was caught, interrogated and executed while Erickson was made to watch. She never gave him up. As she was shot he showed no outward emotions and her executioners were satisfied he had had no knowledge of her activities. In the film’s final daring escape, and with the now suspicious Germans hot on his trail, he fled Hamburg via Denmark and eventually reached Swedish shores.\n\nGermany would never fully recover. Ike Eisenhower later claimed that Erickson had single-handedly shortened the war by two years.\n\nBlack Book (2006 Dutch with English subtitles, director Paul Verhoeven). In using a honeypot method approach for recruitment, the most demanding type of contact is the crash approach. Fleeing from German troops inspecting passengers aboard her train a young, beguiling Jewish women named Rachel Stein (but posing under the assumed non-Jewish identity of Ellis de Vries, played by actress Carice van Houten) sees a compartment occupied by SS officer Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch) and artfully asks to join him.\n\nThis is known as spotting. de Vries quickly sizes him up and sees that he has a particular vulnerability and, with any luck, is ripe for a her desperately needed, hasty recruitment. From what she observes, Muntze’s passion is stamp collecting and she knows she can knowledgeably converse about it. She is being pursued and since time is of the essence, there is no luxury to adopt a gradual approach to developing the SS officer. She approaches him and opens with a comment about stamp arcana. Intrigued with de Vries’s shared passion and beauty he waves off the arriving troops, who are hot on her trail, and though untrained, she is, by her wits, narrowly rescued.\n\nAs they part at the rail station, de Vries lets it be known there is a real connection between them. He is smitten and asks to continue seeing her. From his perspective, the fetching and clearly adoring, much younger woman is interested in him. Unbeknownst to the powerful German officer is that she is working with the Dutch Resistance. A plot point comes later when members of her Resistance cell are serendipitously apprehended by the occupying Germans. The cell’s leader tasks her with a daring plan for getting close to Muntze — head of the local SS — by honeypotting him, in the interest of securing information leading to the attempted rescue of their comrades.\n\nOne thing leads to another and over time Muntze falls in love with de Vries and finds himself without the requisite power to negotiate he would have had prior to his development period. This, along with his waning belief in Germany’s war effort, advances the relationship.\n\nConfessing that he has been lonely since the deaths of his wife and children she then sleeps with Muntze and the honey trap is firmly set. In terms of classic MICE (Money, Ideology, Compromise, Ego) motivations, de Vries is driven by the ambiguity of revenge and ideology, but correctly surmises that the Gestapo head is predisposed to cooperation by a fragile need for intimacy and is therefore vulnerable to compromise.\n\nShe builds on his trust by admitting to him her past, in this way building psychological control, a technique that is widely used in developing assets. Careful to never ask Muntze for betrayal in acting as a direct agent she instead asks for access to something at first of minimal value. In this case for a job at Gestapo Headquarters. The agreeable German officer is now an unwitting accomplice in her plans to bug it with a hidden microphone.\n\nUltimately Muntze’s weakness is his love for de Vries and lack of concern that she is Jewish. Due to her careful use of tradecraft, including sex, he is unable to see her as a threat. It is for this reason that the CIA requires its case officers stationed overseas to report all romantic contact with foreign nationals lest they be working in the employ of any adversary. Ongoing consociations require submission to intense Agency background checks. Not very romantic stuff, but it is deemed to be a necessary sacrifice in the interest of national security.\n\nSpotting, motivation, development and psychological control are elements of continuing real world tradecraft that our spies rated highly in Black Book. Despite the best efforts of any espionage operation, however, sometimes even well executed stratagems can fail and they did so for Muntze and de Vries due to effective Nazi counter-surveillance.\n\nBlack Book is a film that understands the voyeuristic quality of espionage thrillers. As traditional spy film enthusiasts, we characteristically find appealing the naked frailties of lovely young Bond women imperiled by the powerful men they try to entice. Spies, as opposed to filmmakers, also understand this and weaponize sex because it creates servility among their guarded but mislead operational targets.\n\nIn the aftermath of the murders of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Summer Olympics, Steven Spielberg’s Munich (2005) tracks the extrajudicial executions of the responsible PLO terrorists by a Mossad kill team.\n\nTo this day, each targeted killing needs to be approved by the Prime Minister in Israel. Acting directly on the orders of Golda Meir, one by one each terrorist is hunted down with information on their whereabouts provided by a mysterious group of French surrogates potentially acting as “cut-outs” to facilitate Israel’s deniability in the operations.\n\nBut the team’s successes are not without cost. Drinking alone in his hotel bar one evening, team leader Avner Kaufman notices an inveigling Dutch woman who attempts, unsuccessfully, to seduce him.\n\nJeanette:\n\n“I have to go to bed soon”\n\nAvner:\n\n”What kind of work do you do?”\n\nJeanette:\n\n“The kind that drives you to drink”\n\nAvner:\n\n“We must have the same job then”\n\nHe passes on her advances, leaves the bar and runs into his teammate Carl admonishing him to “beware the honey trap” inside the bar. These were prophetic words since Avner and Carl are unaware she is a non-fictional freelance modern assassin — the real-life and deadly Jeanette van Nessen.\n\nLater that night, Avner finds Carl naked and dead in his hotel room. Avner chillingly realizes someone is now triangulating on their team’s identities. In the deadly game of cat-and-mouse that ensues the hunters have become the hunted.\n\nWithout sanction three members of the Mossad team trace van Nessen to her houseboat in The Netherlands and silently terminate her in gruesome retribution with .22 caliber zip guns disguised as bicycle pumps. Spielberg attributes the historically questionable & nonaligned Le Group with providing Avner the assassin’s whereabouts.\n\nVan Nessen made over $100,000 for every hit, worked on several continents and brought new meaning to the term being loved to death.\n\nInformation for hire is enjoying a renaissance in the murky world of sex-spying. In the last few years it has been updated by an omnipresent private sector variant, the ultra-secret Palo Alto based Palantir Technologies. They provide their high paying clients with detailed spidergrams showing, among a host of other data, who’s-sleeping-with-whom reports using sophisticated data mining methodologies. The CIA, FBI, ICE, large corporations and law enforcement incorporate the product to connect the dots in dossier building. No in-depth expose or film has yet been done on this new face of sexpionage, but they’ve been reported as having been involved in locating the whereabouts of Osama bin-Laden, and lately a number of employees have defected stemming from their ethical concerns.\n\nAnother film mini-series on Netflix that superbly depicts the use of tradecraft, and sex as tradecraft, is about the life of the great Eli Cohen in The Spy (2019-director, Gideon Raff also known for Homeland). The Israeli Mossad agent Cohen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) was one of the most effective intelligence officers in the history of espionage. He lived under the most dangerous possible deep cover in Syria and threw orgies for many members of the Damascus power base, in the process gleaning vital national security secrets. Lubricating his popular sex parties with alcohol loosened up the tongues of the governmental, intelligence and military figures who gratefully frequented his soirees.\n\nThough married, with his wife and children back home in Israel, the handsome Cohen took many lovers while in Syria, some among the daughters of high government and military leaders. At the zenith of his achievements, he expertly embedded himself into the highest levels of power and trust in the enemy apparatus. Finally caught, the Syrians felt so deeply deceived and embarrassed in front of the world that they never returned his body to Israel after his public, televised execution.\n\nTo this day, Eli Cohen is revered in Israel as one of its greatest heroes.\n\nIn Lust, Caution (2007) Ang Lee essays the filmic saga of Eileen Chang’s novella via actress Wei Tang’s transformation from shy drama student to would-be assassin. Radical transformations are not altogether far-fetched considering that spies have come from all walks of life. Garbo (Garbo, the Spy 2009- director, Edmon Roch) WWII’s greatest double-agent was a poultry farmer. James Donovan in Bridge of Spies (2015- director, Steven Spielberg) was an insurance attorney (well, sort of…as he was actually a former highly-placed intelligence officer, though the film doesn’t reveal this), and there are numerous other surprising examples of spies from all walks of life including some unidentified ambassadors, United Nations employees, janitors scouring through potentially valuable trash, barbers chatting up the unsuspecting at military bases…in short, intelligence collection is vacuumed from a myriad of sources.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Sino-Japanese War, Wei Tang’s (the character’s name is Chia Chi) assignment is to set a honey trap for Tony Leung (Mr. Yee) a hated Japanese collaborator. Unlike the crash approach taken by Carice in Black Book, Chia Chi begins instead a long, arduous, measured seduction of her collaborator objective. In order to gain access to the relatively inaccessible Yee she insinuates herself, as a non-threatening friend, into Yee’s wife’s inner circle, assuming the role of Mrs. Mai, the wife of a successful Hong Kong businessman. With this new identity in place, and with the aid of her politically charged fellow university troupe actors as her ad hoc cell, she sets out to pursue an inching seduction.\n\nFast forward four years into the future: all the players in the drama relocate to Shanghai where the eminently cautious Mr. Yee is seen promoted to the head of the secret police department responsible for capturing and executing Chinese resistance agents.\n\nDirector Ang Lee delivers on the voyeuristic quality of espionage thrillers. Part of building Chia Chi’s legend, or “back-grounding,” is to prepare her to be convincing in the role she would assume as Mrs Mai. But Chia is an innocent and a virgin. With help from one of her fellow students she agrees to have sexual intercourse (yes, that's part of her sexpionage tradecraft training) and learns the skills expected of a married woman in the bedroom.\n\nTo get closer to Yee, then, Mrs Mai has closely befriended Mrs. Yee and deepens her “legend” by securing a place of trust within and around the family. Mr. Yee is intensely attracted to the seductive young Mai and in a scene of crushing eroticism their encounter helped earn the film an NC-17 rating in the United States for its explicit sexual content. An uncomfortable affair develops in which he brutally sexualizes her (Mai yields to this, intentionally building trust via the appearance of vulnerability by engaging in an extreme act of sexual submission), but as the relationship grows more tender she develops feelings for Yee that will make it hard to carry out her ultimate goal of assassinating him. Yee is a counterintelligence professional who knows he is a target for either recruitment or assassination by the Kuomintang. There is a reason for his sexual brutality with her as he finds safety in the emotional distance.\n\nTender encounters with Mai, he rightly fears, are dangerous. They may engender feelings of obligation or servility in himself towards her. Yee is practicing reasonable, though harsh, counterintelligence efforts to protect himself and his work.\n\nI hate to attach the description “inscrutable” to anything Chinese because of the connotations, but in this occasion the Mandarin title of the movie works out as such for us westerners. “Lust” can also be translated as “tempting” or moreover as “color.” “Caution” can likewise be decoded as “ring.” Lust, Caution therefore bequeaths the buried pun, “colorful ring,” the meaning of which plays a deadly pivotal role in a terminal scene.\n\nCharacters intertwined in thorny fixation, Mai and Yee come to work their way into each other’s hearts. Each fails in their missions. Finally, Yee is ensnared by the exquisitely prepared trap laid by Mai and her friends, but then she critically freezes in the peak dramatic assassination sequence involving the presentation of an exquisite ring he has had specially made for Mai (Remember the alternative Mandarin translation of Lust, Caution as Colorful Ring?). Alerted, Yee barely escapes death and the spy troupe is rounded up as a result. The secret police head signs their death warrants and all, including his lover Mrs Mai, are executed. Yee is emotionally destroyed by the loss of the woman for whom he had clearly fallen prey. The seduction of the honey trap had set in play a complex web of emotions.\n\nIn political overtones reminiscent of the events surrounding The Interview, “Lust, Caution” star Tang Wei was banned in the Chinese media for years because of the sexually subversive nature of her performance. Immensely talented and beautiful, it almost permanently ruined her career.\n\nSo why do honey traps work so well? Whether it’s in the example of Muntze, in Black Book, Yee, in Lust, Caution, or Carl in Munich all fell victim to the permeating thrills of fantasy, manipulation, arousal, ecstasy, surrender to fate, the forbidden, and the lure of a secret life. Yet, these are only part of the reasons they’re effective. In Britain, MI-5 published a 14-page document distributed to hundreds of banks, businesses and financial institutions titled “The Threat From Chinese Espionage.” It details a concerted effort on the part of China to use fetching young women to steal vital secrets from the West, and was distributed to alert unsuspecting targets to these kinds of operations and campaigns. Means as both effective as the vulnerability to losses are annihilating.\n\nAs we’ve seen, while professionals cannot always be fully prepared to identify and resist swallows and ravens, for many untrained powerful men and women the enticements can be nearly irresistible.\n\nIntelligence agencies are not the only ones weaponizing sex for motive. Terrorists and narco-traffickers (due to their nefarious goals and vast sums of involved money) are also players in this game. Depending on the position you occupy no one is ultimately immune from being approached. Be you a president, an ambassador, a tech or pharma entrepreneur, a customs inspector, a compliance official at an off-shore bank, or a night watchman at a chemical depot, “key” people can end up being unsuspecting victims.\n\nNot all stories make it to the screen and the tales still go untold. Jeanette van Nessen, for instance, spent part of her career in South America, handsomely retained for practicing her art against rival drug lords. This is an example of powerful institutions operating in the shadows of corrupt regimes, parallel to governments, practicing sexpionage.\n\nThere’s one more film that uses a honey trap of a radically different variety. Here I’ve saved the best for last. My favorite of the films we’re screening on this subject is Raazi (2018, Hindi with English subtitles-director, Meghna Gulzar) about the life of the astonishing Sehmat Khan. Perhaps it’s polarizing to characterize a tale combining sex with espionage as also somehow touching, but Raazi is just that.\n\nThis film centers around the astonishing true story of a young, naive, 20-year-old college student (played by actress Alia Bhatt in an award-winning role) and daughter of an Indian Intelligence Bureau double agent. Sehmat’s father is a long-term deep penetration agent into Pakistani Military Intelligence, which is secure in the mistaken belief that he is actually working for them as an informant on Indian operations. We first encounter her when the dying father conveys that he can no longer continue with his important work on behalf of India, now on the verge of war with Pakistan, and wishes for Sehmat to carry on with his successful penetration into a high-ranking circle of a military family inside Pakistan. He tells her he has arranged for her to be married to Iqbal (actor Vicky Kauschal), the military officer youngest son of a trusted Brigadier, soon to be promoted to the high-ranking status of Major General. She dutifully agrees.\n\nOn a number of important levels the story shows a face of sexpionage that just cannot be called tawdry.\n\nI am going to keep the description very brief…since most Americans have not seen Raazi I don’t want to act as a spoiler, but would point out several important things to watch out for. Most all the elements of tradecraft we learned in spy school, at the beginning of this piece, are present here in subtle forms. But there are others, too:\n\nIt shows that uniquely cultural approaches can be weaponized against a developmental, here by profane actions detonated inside the sacred institution of arranged marriages. Unlike the Jeannette van Nessen bar seduction in Munich, this approach is almost impossible to guard against.\n\nSehmat is especially lethal because she is sweet and innocent and so she catches people completely off guard. “The smile of a new bride must always be on your face,” she is taught by her New Delhi Bureau trainer.\n\nThat the once innocent Sehmat is altered by her training into a capable killer. She kills while never becoming a cold-blooded killer instead only using it, with remorse, to prevent her unmasking. Notably, unlike most films inside the genre, the ricin assassination sequence is almost entirely, methodologically dependable. Almost.\n\nAs both she and her husband peel away the facade of her secreted, treacherous role in their happy marital union, they are in concert, tenderly and mutually confessing of their feelings. Their love has become real. Both also agree though that love of country is more important than personal love, even if it leads to each other’s deaths at the hands of the other. The penultimate scene’s dialogue partly illustrates the chasm into which they’ve been cast:\n\nSehmat (pointing the gun at Iqbal):\n\n“Sit down”\n\nIqbal:\n\n“Use two bullets, Sehmat. One for me. One for you. There’s no other way…Was anything ever real between us?”\n\nLastly, I’d point out that neither faults the other’s commitment to their respective countries. They both honor and respect the concept of mutual patriotism. For experienced intelligence officers in all countries with international postings this is a relativistic realization that often evolves. Raazi explores with nuance sex, deception, patriotism, death and sacrifice without resorting to overt nationalism or jingoism. A real achievement.\n\nIn addition to Sexpionage techniques, there is more authentic tradecraft in Raazi than in any other film we’ve examined. Watch it closely and watch it many times. Coded transmissions and other methods between deep cover agents — and other HUMINT techniques — abound just about everywhere. In the end, Sehmat daringly gains physical access to plans indicating an imminent submarine launched naval threat against India. It directly helps them triumph in the resulting war with Pakistan. Much as with Erickson in The Counterfeit Traitor, Sehmat showed the field’s unique contributions, being made daily, by unnamed people around the world. An ongoing reminder that a single spy can make an immense difference.\n\nSehmat Khan, the spy, is a great hero of the Indian people. Uncommonly brave, committed, patriotic, she exemplifies the concept of personal sacrifice in the service of deep cover intelligence operations. Raazi, the film, challenges us to understand each other to minimize the conflict between nations.\n\nThe foregoing are, after all, hatched from the world of make believe, tales commonly told in the reassuring safety of darkened theaters. We can, all of us, be overcome by pleasures of imagination placed just in and out of reach. A fellow traveler once said to me, “don’t make the mistake of believing in the inevitability of the actual.” This applies in spades to the intelligence business. Sometimes things just turn out differently than one scripts them to. The “actual” may be a purposeful fiction. This especially goes for the complex relationships formed around the treacherous wilderness spies inhabit.\n\nSo, if ever approached by a beautiful women, or man, remember that sometimes things happen for a reason. And somewhere in a church, in a cemetery, a synagogue or in a mosque, sometime in the past and far removed from the world of make believe, lovers have been known to weep at the funerals of their adversaries, and love, that they helped ruin.\n\nSpying can be a dirty business."
