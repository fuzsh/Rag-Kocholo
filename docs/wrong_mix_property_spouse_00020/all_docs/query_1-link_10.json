        "text": "Pay close attention this fall and you’ll notice one recurring handsome face you probably haven’t seen much before.\n\nSebastian Koch, a German actor whose mainstream American debut was playing a Russian villain in 2013’s “A Good Day To Die Hard,” is going to be hard to miss over the next few months.\n\nA seasoned performer at 53, he’s won various European awards and played a lead role in the 2006 German film “The Lives of Others,” which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nBut he has remained pretty much under the radar over here — until now.\n\nIf you’re following the new season of “Homeland” on Showtime, you’ll know him as Carrie’s new boss, billionaire Otto Düring — who was nearly bumped off during a visit to a refugee camp in an episode that aired Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, on the big screen, you’ll soon see him in Steven Spielberg’s Cold War thriller “Bridge of Spies,” where he plays a sketchy lawyer in East Berlin.\n\nHe also shows up in maybe the biggest Oscar-bait of the year, Tom Hooper’s “The Danish Girl,” in which he plays the surgeon who proposes performing gender-reassignment surgery on Eddie Redmayne’s character.\n\nWith résumé boosters like these — and a face like that — you’re sure to be seeing Koch as a leading man here before long. He’s already romanced one of the hottest stars of the moment: Dutch actress Carice van Houten, who plays the witchy Melisandre on “Game of Thrones,” and with whom he was in a relationship for four years."
