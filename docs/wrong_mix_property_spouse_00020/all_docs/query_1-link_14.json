After the departure of Ronnie thinks Rachel to the water back to its wartime sad.\n\nAfter the hiding place of the Jewish singer Rachel Stein in september 1944 by the allies is being bombarded by mistake and being rescued by a farmer's son in a sailing boat, she is approached by a resistance man, Of Gein. This encourages her to go into hiding or flee and through him trying Rachel with a group of Jews to cross to the Biesbosch area already released. Rachel gets first Fl 50,000 in dollars and diamonds of her father on the transaction in his notary Smaal, which in a black booklet notes and let her draw for reception. By Van Gein is smuggled to the Biesbosch Rachel with others where they her parents and brother, who recently had surgery on his Appendix, again. However, the boat encounters on an SS-patrol and almost all refugees are killed by machine gun fire. Only Rachel manages to escape by jumping in the water. Hidden in the reeds she sees how the Germans seem landing and of their valuables.\n\nIn a coffin with cross and vent hole reached Rachel disguised as victims of typhus the Hague soup kitchen \"Laak port\" where she is going to cook under the direction of the communist resistance man Gerben Kuipers. She is now called Ellis de Vries and has blonde hair. They are asked to work as a Messenger at a mob of Hans AA. She's witnessed a dropping of weapons, food and equipment for the resistance by an English airplane, after which a German robbery by Hans is driven off. In a train she must play the fiancee of Hans and kiss him, but when the Nazi soldiers on the train clearly do intend to search all baggage, a new plan is needed. Ellis takes the bags and enters a private compartment occupied by the sympathetic SD Hauptsturmführer Müntze which shows her his stamp collection. The Nazis don't search Müntze's compartment. Ellis and Müntze are clearly attracted to each other and she accepts an offer to visit him at his office. Hans is clearly jealous.\n\nA truck carrying the British guns crashes in front of the soup kitchen. Kuiper's son, Tim was driving and is arrested by the Gestapo. The resistance asks Ellis to use her charms to seduce Müntze and convince him to release imprisoned resistance members, including Tim. To this end, she bleaches her pubic hair and Hans tries to seduce her, she discovered that Hans is a doctor and sleeps with him proving to be a bit promiscuous. She visits the notary again, brings Müntze missing Wilhelmina-stamps and goes to a German party. There she meets at the piano also Franks, the Commander of the patrol who killed her parents in the Biesbosch. She need to throw up, but then acts as a singer with Ronnie, a 'muffs whore'. Franken Later offers her a job as a Secretary on the toilet on the SD Office in Washington.\n\nVia notary Smaal and Rachel know the resistance group an English microphone from dropping behind a painting by Heinrich Himmler to place in the Office of Franken, so they can listen to the SD. As they discover that the death of Rachels parents was indeed a trap. Gein's approached by wealthy Jews and intentionally gave the Germans when they would ' escape ' to liberated area. Franken waited than the Jews and shot them dead until the last man, after which the corpses were robbed. Part of the resistance group decision of Gein to take to kidnap him by grazing, but the attack failed almost by the poor quality of the chloroform to stun him, and they see themselves forced to shoot him.\n\nMüntze shows private not such a evil guy. He had lost his family by an Allied bombing of Hamburg and sees the war as a hopeless and pointless. Also he tries to behave where order and correctness at all others (particularly Franken) all brakes and cut loose. So he holds a number of executions of resistance members. He has in fact already from the beginning also Of suspicion towards Rachel and when Gein disappears, he forces Rachel in bed to confess her story. Yet he gives not her but francs to, due to obscuring the stuff of rich Jews (which come to the Reich). This may, however, leads the Jews to Rachel and benevolent attempt to his own arrest. Can find no evidence against Franken and Müntze in addition, Franken accuses him of negotiating with the (Communist) resistance. Müntze is referred to by the German Council of war sentenced to death for high treason. For the murder By the Nazis execute 40 hostages go Gein.\n\nThe opposition has in the meantime adopted the plan of Smaal and Hans akkermans to freeing the hostages and captured resistance members with help from Rachel, which also enforces the release of Müntze. The resistance has a map and keys to the German headquarters with the underground cells. The operation failed by treachery while Rachel one floor higher sings on a German party. Tim Kuipers comes to, Hans akkermans escapes. Franken shows many things. He takes Rachel to his Office and makes it through the microphone of the resistance for the resistance that Rachel as the treason star going to see. Stalwarts of freeing him and Rachel and Müntze they dive into a cozy little boat to a shore, along the end of the war, watchful waiting. Franken tries with a ship from Scheveningen to Hamburg to escape, but is shot dead by Hans Akkermans on board.\n\nRachel and Müntze walk after the liberation on street and shall take Ronnie that a Canadian has picked up. Rachel and Müntze search notary Smaal and his wife on suspecting him to have a key role they played in the death of Rachels parents. In addition, he joined the SD across the floor and thus had occasion to inform them about the operation. The notary \"is to a different conclusion\" on the basis of his black book and wants to tell them that, but only in the presence of the Canadian police: he is a lawyer and wants them no bias. In so far as it does not come, for he is shot by a stranger at the door. Müntze pursuit, but it is a recognized and picked up by the crowd. Rachel takes the black book out of the bag of the murdered notary and is picked up by resistance members in the House who recognized her at the window.\n\nMüntze is imprisoned before the firing squad of his fellow Germans, because his German commander invokes the British laws of war that the enemy let its own case-law-a historical fact! -and Rachel with other \"traitors\" locked up and abused-she gets a ton of shit and piss all over them-until a Canadian soldier and doctor Hans akkermans its buckling. Rachels only possessions are her necklace with portraits of parents and brother and the black book of notary Saha. He takes her to his medical practice and let her see the loot which he of Franconia has decreased. Rachel recognize objects of her family, including the lighter they gave the farmer's son. AA tells that Müntze is dead. Rachel Gets an attack of grief, and AA gives her an injection to calm down. Insulin as it turns out, and so much that she will die, he says while she fights the dizziness. AA is welcome by the crowd as a resistance hero under his balcony. This gives Rachel the opportunity to eat chocolate and the effect of insulin. She jumps from AA ' balcony and get out into the crowd, AA calls her after \"I'll get you, whore!\"\n\nWith Canadian soldiers are looking for Rachel Gerben Kuipers on which witnesses his son Tim in the excavation of mass graves of murdered resistance members. According to the black book and a German arrest warrant for doctor AA is the past reconstructed. AA was arrested by the Germans in 1944 but released and betrayed in Exchange rich Jewish families so they could be murdered and robbed by Franks. He has through notary Saha still on a kitchen table the appendectomy by Rachels brother done and brought into contact with him and his parents Of Gein, so that they took part in the escape attempt in the Biesbosch. Gerben Kuipers put together with Rachel in pursuit on AA, which-just like Rachel earlier-in a coffin tries to escape. They intercept him and AA tries from his coffin Rachel to buy with robbed money and jewelry. But Rachel is not on in and unscrew the coffin with her necklace close so that AA later chokes. Gerben and Rachel sit at the water and wonder what to do with that wealth should.\n\nRachel returns to the present where they to the water as her family-two children and man-come and get her. They run back to the fence of Kibbutz, that Kfar Stein (Stein village) turns out to welcome, according to a Board founded with money from war victims. Soldiers drive the fence within, gunshots are audible as the population coverage are looking for-it is the time of the Suez crisis.\n\nDivision Of Roles[Edit][]\n\nActor Character Comments Carice van Houten Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries Rembrandt: best actress Sebastian Koch SS-Hauptsturmführer Ludwig Müntze Thom Hoffman Hans Akkermans Halina Reijn Ronnie Waldemar Kobus SS-Obersturmführer Günther Franken Derek de Lint Gerben Kuipers Christian Berkel SS-Obergruppenführer Käutner Dolf de Vries Notary Saha Peter Block By Gein Michiel Huisman Rob Ronald Armbrust Tim Kuipers Frank Lammers Kees Matthias Schoenaerts Joop Johnny de Mol Theo Xander Street Maarten Diana Dobbelman Mrs. Saha Rixt Leddy Anny Lidewij Mahler Linda Pieter Tiddens Herman Gijs Naber Cas Dirk Zeelenberg Siem Michiel de Jong David Jobst Schnibbe Driver Müntze Boris Saran Joseph Jack Vecht Mr. Stein Jacqueline Blom Mrs. Stein Seth Kamphuijs Max Stein Pramod Bait Sa Willi Skip Goeree Ronnie's man Bert Luppes Mr. Tjepkema Marisa van Eyle Mrs. Talbot John Minor Sarah Talbot Bas van der Horst Jacob Talbot Foeke Kolff Child Tjepkema Merel van Houts Child Tjepkema Charlotte Rinnooy Kan Child Tjepkema Maaike K Child Tjepkema Janni Goslinga Lady in fur coat Wimie Wilhelm Female prison guard Theo Maassen Prison guard with beret Tjebbo Gad Prison guard with accordion Timothy Deenihan Canadian Colonel Nolan Hemmings Captain British intelligence Garrick Hagon British General Arron Dale Dutch SD in train Menno van Beekum Dutch SD in train Marcel Musters Henk Hugo Metsers Shock trooper Rian Gabriel Drunk woman in prison Susan Visser Drunk woman in prison Maiko Kemper Siegfried Carsten Sasse German sentry Liza David Receptionist Willem de Wolf Woningman Oded Menashe Man of Rachel Roni Yedid Daughter of Rachel Tomer Agami Son of Rachel Maarten Cat ss-clerk Gabriela Lewis Tour Leader\n\nProduction, payment and receipt[Edit][]\n\nBlack book was the first film that Verhoeven, after more than 20 years, took up again in Netherlands.
