        "text": "In Memoriam: Loren William Koch, January 23, 1947 – December 2, 2023\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Loren William Koch, a beloved son, brother, uncle, entrepreneur, and world-traveler. Loren’s journey began on January 23, 1947, in Beatrice, Nebraska, as the son of Delbert and Lorene (Obering) Koch. He was baptized on February 16, 1947, and confirmed on March 26, 1961, embarking on a life guided by faith and compassion.\n\nLoren’s passion for journalism led him to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he simultaneously worked at Shakey’s, honing his skills in both academics and the hospitality industry. A creative spirit, he started drawing on napkins during his tenure at Here’s Johnny’s in Omaha, a restaurant he managed, crafting the blueprint for what would later become the iconic Brother Sebastian’s.\n\nOn April 25th, 1977, Loren realized his dream by opening Brother Sebastian’s, a restaurant that would not only become a staple in the community but also a testament to his dedication and vision. Loren poured his heart and soul into the establishment, creating a warm and welcoming space for patrons to enjoy good food and good company. Brother Sebastian’s quickly became synonymous with Loren’s commitment to excellence and hospitality.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Loren’s entrepreneurial spirit took charge of a quaint lounge, breathing new life into its character and ambiance. The establishment would become known as Abercrombie’s, a distinguished and fine dining establishment.\n\nWith an eye for detail and an innate sense of style, Loren curated an atmosphere within both restaurants that seamlessly blended sophistication with warmth. His restaurants quickly became a haven for those seeking not just a meal, but a dining experience marked by exquisite cuisine and an ambiance that reflected Loren’s unique touch.\n\nBeyond his professional accomplishments, Loren’s true joy lay in the love he shared with his family and his adoration for his canine companions. He was a devoted brother and leader, cherishing every moment spent with those he held dear. His kindness, generosity, and warm spirit touched the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nLoren was also a world-traveler, exploring different cultures and embracing the beauty of diversity. His adventures enriched his life and inspired those around him to appreciate the wonders of the world. He often traveled with friends and family, including a trip down the Amazon, where he found himself exiting the kayak into an unexpected deep hole, which proved to be a comical sight for those who joined him in kayaking. Undoubtedly channeling the indomitable spirit of a modern-day Viking, Loren, with a twinkle in his eye, planted his oar firmly into the sandy riverbank. In that whimsical gesture, he declared his conquest, embodying the spirit of exploration and triumph over unexpected challenges. This anecdote serves as a testament to Loren’s adventurous nature and his ability to find joy even in the face of unexpected twists. It’s a tale that will be fondly recounted by those who shared in his adventures and a fitting addition to the tapestry of his rich and diverse life.\n\nIn the quieter moments of his life, Loren found solace and joy in the simple pleasures of reading and tending to his farm. He sought refuge in the embrace of a good book, allowing the written word to transport him to realms far beyond the reaches of everyday life. The tranquility of Loren’s farm served as another sanctuary. The farm became a canvas upon which he painted the hues of rural life, and each season brought new opportunities for him to nurture and cultivate, and lots of corn for his friends and family to pick. Through his love for reading and the toil of his hands on the farm, Loren found balance, enriching his soul and leaving an indelible mark on the tapestry of his well-lived life.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Loren William Koch, we celebrate a life well-lived, marked by passion, creativity, and a deep love for family, both in blood and in friendship. He leaves behind a legacy that will continue to thrive in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to share in his journey.\n\nLoren is survived by his brothers, Roger Koch, and wife, Debra, from Flower Mound, TX, Bruce Koch and wife, Liz, from DeWitt, NE; sister, Corlyce Barth and husband, Michael from Odessa, TX; and sister-in-law, Marilyn Koch; nephews and nieces. Loren was preceded in death by his parents, Delbert and Lorene (Obering) Koch; brother, Gaylan Koch.\n\nBoth VISITATION: Thursday, December 7, 2023 from 6:00 -8:00 p.m., and MEMORIAL SERVICE: Friday, December 8, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. to honor Loren’s life will be held at West Center Chapel, 7805 West Center Rd. in Omaha, NE. Immediately following the Memorial service, there will be a GRAVESIDE SERVICE at St Paul’s Lutheran Church, 10126 SW 2nd St, DeWitt, NE."
