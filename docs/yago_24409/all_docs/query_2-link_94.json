        "text": "On Global Love Day, the King of Thailand decided to marry his bodyguard and officially make her his queen.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, married the deputy head of his personal guard force on Wednesday, May 1, furthermore bestowing a royal title upon his new spouse, Queen Suthida. In an official royal statement, the palace explained how the king “has decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida and she will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family.”\n\nTheir relationship, prior to Wednesday’s ceremony, has never been publicly confirmed—though it was long speculated by the public. The couple’s footage showed the couple partaking in a Thai cultural royal tradition with the king pouring water on his bride’s head. The bride and groom then signed an official registry (not the type where you can select all the products you want to fill in your new home) and formally stepped out Thursday.\n\nOther royal family members and royal court members attended the wedding ceremony, which was streamed on television channels in Thailand Wednesday evening.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn’s working relationship with Suthida Tidjai goes back to at least 2014, when he made the former flight attendant part of his bodyguard team. Two years later, he made Tidjai a general in the army.\n\nThe king (who goes by King Rama X) made his marriage official right before his coronation. His late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, passed away in October 2016, following a 70-year reign.\n\nThis will be the fourth marriage for the new king.\n\nSecure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.\n\nRelated Articles"
