His Majesty the King was a close friend of the United States and a valued partner of many U.S. Presidents. I had the honor of calling on His Majesty the King during my visit to Thailand in 2012 and recall his grace and warmth, as well as his deep affection and compassion for the Thai people.\n\nAs the revered leader and only monarch that most Thais have ever known, His Majesty was a tireless champion of his country's development and demonstrated unflagging devotion to improving the standard of living of the Thai people. With a creative spirit and a drive for innovation, he pioneered new technologies that have rightfully received worldwide acclaim. His Majesty leaves a legacy of care for the Thai people that will be cherished by future generations.\n\nThe American people and I stand with the people of Thailand as we mourn His Majesty the King's passing, and today we hold the Thai people in our thoughts and prayers.\n\nCategories: Statements by the President : Deaths :: Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand.\n\nNames: Bhumibol Adulyadej, King; Sirikit, Queen.\n\nSubjects: Deaths : Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand; Thailand : King; Thailand : Queen; Thailand : Relations with U.S."
