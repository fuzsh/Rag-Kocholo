Following the procedures, the King’s blood pressure “dropped occasionally” and he was given medicine and put on a ventilator.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nWorld's longest serving royals\n\n01:12 - Source: CNN\n\nOn Sunday, the doctors gave the King medicine to expand blood vessels around his lungs following an echocardiography – a sonogram of the heart – which showed that blood flow to the left side of his heart had reduced significantly.\n\nHis blood pressure then “improved,” but his general condition “remains unstable,” according to the statement from the Bureau of the Royal Household, posted on the King’s official Facebook page.\n\nConcerns for the much-revered King have been mounting in recent years, due to his extended hospital stays.\n\nLast month, he was treated for a severe infection, reduced kidney function and fluid in his lung. He had surgery to remove his gallbladder last year."
