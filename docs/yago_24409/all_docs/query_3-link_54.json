The WIPO Global Leaders Award is the Organization’s most prestigious recognition of outstanding contributions by world leaders to the cause of intellectual property to promote development.\n\nAs an inventor and an artist, His Majesty is a strong advocate of intellectual property, owning over 20 patents and 19 trademarks. Many of his inventions have generated concrete benefits for Thai communities, having been put to practical use in a range of rural development projects in Thailand. His Majesty was granted his first patent in 1993 for a system to resolve water shortage problem in the dry season, making him the first member of the royal family to obtain a patent. His Majesty is also a recognized and prolific artist, having created over 1,000 works, including paintings, photos, musical and literary works such as songs and novels.\n\nThe WIPO Global Leaders Award, which comprises a citation and a medal honoring the recipient, recognizes leadership and personal engagement in promoting intellectual property at the national, regional and international levels. It also rewards exceptional personal creative and innovative activities and use of the intellectual property system to protect these works.\n\nThe importance of intellectual property as a policy tool to promote development has been a key feature of Dr. Idris’ vision as Director General of the Organization since 1997. Dr. Idris has campaigned extensively to enhance awareness and understanding among global leaders of intellectual property and its strategic importance in promoting economic, social and cultural development. The new WIPO Global Leaders Award would contribute to the realization of the Director General’s vision.\n\nWIPO/PR/2007/474: King of Thailand to Receive WIPO's First Global Leaders Award\n\nPrince Mahidol Award 2006\n\nBangkok, Feb 1 (Xinhua) Four doctors from the US and India received the Prince Mahidol Award 2006 from Thailand's King Bhumibol Aulyadej here for their contribution to medical and public health services.

Cash, and Indian doctor Dilip Mahalanabis were presented the award in the field of medicine at the Chakri Throne Hall, the Grand Palace in Bangkok.\n\nThe Thai king praised the awardees as 'excellent examples of those who truly perform good deeds for the sake of goodness, because such achievements are not meant for any individual but for the benefit of mankind as a whole'.\n\nSponsored by a Thai royal family foundation, the Prince Mahidol Award is conferred annually to individuals or institutions who make outstanding contributions to the advancement of medical and public health services for humanity all over the world.\n\nQueen: Speak up against killings\n\nHer Majesty the Queen yesterday urged the entire Kingdom to condemn the violence and brutality in the restive south and act against it.\n\n\"We cannot sit still anymore. It is not right [to allow the violence]. We should condemn it to show our dissatisfaction at such actions,\"\n\n\"I think Thai people all over the country should express their views and opinions that it is absolutely wrong to kill other people, notably the elderly and women who cannot protect themselves,\"\n\n\"We should do something, like the gathering of people with me today. We should express our views via radio, television or letters to tell the militants to stop, otherwise they could turn our country into an uncivilised society in which they can kill anybody, anytime,\" she said. \"We have to stop the violence now, it's enough,\"\n\n\"I know there are many bad people everywhere but it is our duty not to allow them to do such bad things. They can kill people and officials cannot bring them down? That's not the right thing and not honourable for our nation,\"\n\nHM the Queen urged people, especially in Bangkok, to take action against the violence. It was Her Majesty's first plea this year amid no signs of an end to the violence.\n\nThe Nation\n\nHM the King allows Tanzania to use rain-making technology\n\nHis Majesty the King has granted permission for drought-stricken Tanzania to use his patented rain-making technique, Agriculture Minister Theera Sutabutr said Wednesday.\n\nThe Agriculture Ministry will dispatch its officials to demonstrate the technique and transfer technology to Tanzanian officials, the minister said.\n\nThe east-African nation asked Thailand for help and the Royal Household Bureau informed the ministry His Majesty had granted permission for the technology transfer, he said.\n\nHis Majesty has advised the ministry to map the country and build a database of wind patterns, Thira said.\n\nExperts will travel to Tanzania this month armed with geographical information provided by its government.\n\nThere they will train Tanzanian officials to make artificial rain.\n\nOther countries have expressed interest in using His Majesty's techniques.\n\nHis Majesty was granted a patent for his \"super-sandwich\" rainmaking\" technique which uses aircraft to \"seed\" with chemicals warm and cold clouds at different altitudes.

Instead of attempting to repair it, the Thai Government’s Fine Arts Ministry and His Majesty decided to present the Center with a new, more elaborate, sala. We are extremely pleased to have this beautiful new structure.”\n\nThe new sala was designed by Dr. Pinyo Suwankiri, a professor at Bangkok’s prestigious Chulalongkorn University, a Fellow of the Royal Institute, and the foremost designer of traditional structures in Thailand. First assembled in Bangkok, and made of teak and native rosewood, the new sala was taken apart piece-by-piece and shipped to the EWC in Honolulu. A team of six Thai artisans and a Thai engineer, accompanied by Dr. Pinyo, traveled to Hawaii to oversee the dismantling of the old sala and construction of the new one. The colorful pavilion, featuring ornately carved designs, sweeping rooftop cho fa, mirrors, and His Majesty’s seal, will be officially dedicated early next year on the occasion of the visit to Hawaii of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.\n\nThe East-West Center contributes to a peaceful, prosperous and just Asia Pacific community by serving as a vigorous hub for cooperative research, education and dialogue on critical issues of common concern to the Asia Pacific region and the United States.\n\nEast-West Center: News Release: Thai King Gives New 'Sala' to East-West Center\n\nMore on Dr. Pinyo's portfolio >> Thai Architecture | Dr. Pinyo Suwankiri\n\nThais across the country gather to pray for King\n\nThais across the country attended multi-faith ceremonies yesterday to celebrate the 80th anniversary of His Majesty the King's birthday.
