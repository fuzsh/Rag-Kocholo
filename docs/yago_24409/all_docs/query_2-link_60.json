He said he had no regrets.\n\nKing Charles’ coronation saw many Asian royals dazzling in uniforms, traditional dresses and suits … from Japan’s Crown Prince Akishino to Thailand’s Queen Suthida\n\nPhysicians concluded Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati had a severe arrhythmia due to inflammation of the heart caused by mycoplasma infection.\n\nPrime Minister Prayut met families reeling from one of the kingdom’s deadliest mass killings. He laid flowers and handed out compensation cheques."
