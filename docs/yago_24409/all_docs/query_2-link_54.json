Second, it delves into the death of King Ananda, which to date has remained untangled. These two issues, although not entirely intertwining, served to challenge the survival of the Thai royal family during which time its political position was vulnerable, following the abolition of absolute monarchy in 1932. King Ananda was on the throne for merely a decade. The controversy surrounding his death, possibly involving his younger brother Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej, effectively made him a “forgotten monarch” in Thai history."
