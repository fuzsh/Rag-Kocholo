        "text": "On 16 July 2024, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with the World Tipiṭaka Foundation, hosted the Launch of the Special Presentation of The World Tipiṭaka Saj-jhā-ya Phonetic Recitation, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit Commemorative 2016 Editions: A Gift of Peace and Wisdom for All, in Celebration of the 6th Cycle Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua (28 July 2024) at Vithes Samosorn, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand.\n\nThe event was presided over by His Excellency Mr. Maris Sangiampongsa, Minister of Foreign Affairs, alongside Thanpuying Varaporn Pramoj Na Ayudhya, the President of the World Tipiṭaka Foundation. Present at the event were members of Diplomatic Corps, representatives from the United Nations Resident Coordinator Office and UNESCO, executives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, committee of the World Tipiṭaka Foundation, sponsors of the Tipiṭaka publication, and representatives from public and private sectors and the media.\n\nAt the event, there was an exhibition showcasing Thailand’s significant role in preserving, developing, and disseminating the Tipiṭaka to various countries. In 1893, King Chulalongkorn of Siam produced the inaugural printed the Chulachomklao of Syam-Pali Tipiṭaka Bangkok Era 112 edition with Siamese script in book form. He presented it as Royal Gifts to 25 nations. This highlighted a momentous time in contemporary history when Siam was formally connected to the World. It also showcased innovation through the invention of a phonetic system to ensure the scriptures became more accessible as well as the use of modern printing methods. In 2005, the World Tipiṭaka in Roman script edition was published under the World Tipiṭaka Project. With the gracious support and guidance of HRH Princess Galayani Vadhana of Thailand, the edition was presented as Gifts of Dhamma to over 150 major international institutions worldwide. In 2016, the World Tipiṭaka Saj-jhā-ya Phonetic Recitation: The King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit Commemorative 2016 Editions was published as the world’s first Tipiṭaka specifically designed for Saj-jhā-ya recitation. Through linguistic and musicological innovation and the use of AI technology, the editions ensure accurate pronunciation of the Tipiṭaka, maintaining the original Pali pronunciation from over 2,500 years ago.\n\nA public talk “Decoding the Tipiṭaka” was also held at Naradhip Auditorium where more than 150 participants attended. The panelists included Prof. Tongthong Chandransu, Advisor to the Prime Minister, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sasi Pongsarayuth, Head of Western Music Department, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts, Chulalongkorn University, and Ms. Chananya Techajaksemar, content creator and YouTuber of “Point of View” channel. Topics including the stories of the Tipiṭaka from the origin until the latest version in Thailand, the innovative application of musical notes to the script, and the younger generations’ aspects on Buddha’s teaching.\n\nThe World Tipiṭaka Saj-jhā-ya Phonetic Recitation 2016 Editions comprise 80 volumes - 40 volumes each. The King Bhumibol Adulyadej Edition is presented with Syam-Pāli phonetic symbols and the Queen Sirikit Edition is presented with Pāli monotone music notation for accurate rhythm. For more details, visit https://www.sajjhaya.org.\n\nIn 2016, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua, then the Crown Prince, graciously accepted the position of the Publication Chairman to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great’s accession to the throne.\n\nThe Special Presentation of the World Tipiṭaka Saj-jhā-ya Phonetic Recitation, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit Commemorative 2016 Editions: A Gift of Peace and Wisdom for All, is part of the celebrations for the 6th Cycle Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Maha Vajiraklaochaoyuhua on 28 July 2024. These editions will be presented, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand and the World Tipiṭaka Foundation, to carefully chosen designated libraries, institutions and organizations in 36 countries, especially those that received Royal State Visits by Their Majesties King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and Queen Sirikit the Queen Mother. Additionally, the editions will also be sent to the United Nations and displayed at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris.\n\nThe initiative honours the work and accomplishments of Their Majesties King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and Queen Sirikit The Queen Mother. The effort also aims to strengthen Thailand's relations with other countries via the dissemination of Buddhist wisdom through the academic realm worldwide."
