        "text": "Thailand has started a year of mourning after the death of the world's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, aged 88.\n\nThe palace did not give a reason for his death, but said in a statement: \"Although the team of doctors treated him to the best of their ability, his condition deteriorated.\n\n\"His Majesty has passed away at Siriraj Hospital (in Bangkok) peacefully.\"\n\nBhumibol came to the throne in 1946 as an 18-year-old, after the death of his brother King Ananda Mahidol from a gunshot wound in a palace bedroom.\n\nThe circumstances of that death remain unexplained.\n\nHe was crowned in 1950, a week after he married his wife, and together they went on to visit nearly 30 countries.\n\nDuring a 70-year reign, the US-born king became his nation's one constant, as a long line of governments rose and fell.\n\nHe was remembered as a gentle leader, a frail-looking and softly spoken man who used his influence to unite the nation and rally troops through the Cold War as Thailand's neighbours fell to communism.\n\nBut he was also down to earth - hiking to remote rice paddies and poor villages to examine the state of the country beyond the palace steps and to resolve various disputes.\n\nKing Bhumibol became the world's richest monarch and lived the life of a modern king, racing yachts and wearing ornate clothing.\n\nBut he spent most of his final years in hospital, rarely seen in public and remaining silent on the upheaval and protests that have shaken Thailand in recent years.\n\nThe king's son and heir apparent, 64-year-old Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, is expected to succeed him. However many commentators say he does not have the influence of his father.\n\nThailand's prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-Cha, said: \"The government will proceed with the succession.\n\n\"The government will inform the National Legislative Assembly that His Majesty the King appointed his heir on 28 December, 1972.\"\n\nThat is the date his son was made crown prince.\n\nThe prime minister also urged Thais to love one another and to preserve \"the father's land\".\n\nSky's correspondent in Southeast Asia, Tom Rayner, said that \"several thousand\" people were outside the hospital where the king had been receiving treatment \"for the best part of 10 years\".\n\n\"There are people wailing, crying ... this is a country that will now be in shell-shock.\"\n\nHe added: \"The king was loved by many in this country ... a leader who led their country through turbulent political times, a unifying figure.\"\n\nThe king's death will be the first major test for the generals who seized power in 2014, promising to restore stability after a decade of political chaos.\n\nKing Bhumibol's wife, Queen Sirikit, has also been ill in recent years and rarely seen.\n\nThe death of the king means Queen Elizabeth II, crowned in 1952, becomes the world's longest-reigning monarch."
