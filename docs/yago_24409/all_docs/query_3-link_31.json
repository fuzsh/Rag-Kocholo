        "text": "Queen Sirikit of Thailand is marking her 90th birthday today, and Thailand is celebrating their Queen Mother with Mother’s Day, exhibits and craft shows.\n\nBut who is the beloved matriarch of the Thai Royal Family?\n\nBorn royal, Sirikit Kitiyakara was the daughter of Prince Nakkhatra Mangala and Bua Kitiyakara; she was born on 12 August 1932 in the home of Lord Vongsanuprabhand in Bangkok when the country was still known as Siam. Sirikit is the eldest daughter and third child of the couple.\n\nThe future queen consort was named by a queen. Queen Rambai Barni chose Sirikit’s name, meaning “the greatness of Kitiyakara.”\n\nDuring the first year of her life, she was raised by her maternal grandparents while her parents were in the United States (her father was the secretary of the Siamese Embassy in Washington, DC). However, after their return to Thailand, she resided in Deves Palace.\n\nSirikit was educated at the Kindergarten College at Rajini School until bombing from the Asian and Pacific battles during World War II forced her to switch to Saint Francis Xavier Convent School near her home. After the Second World War, the family moved to the United Kingdom, where her father was the Thai Ambassador to the UK beginning in 1946.\n\nShe also lived in Denmark and France during this time, where she went on to meet her future husband in Paris. Sirikit and King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had already ascended the throne, were related through King Chulalongkorn (or Rama V). The pair toured various attractions and found themselves quite fond of one another. After the King was hospitalised due to a car crash in 1948, Sirikit made many trips to visit him in Switzerland and met his mother, Princess Srinagarindra. Srinagarindra approved of Sirikit and asked her to study in Switzerland so that she and the King could get better acquainted.\n\nOn 19 July 1949, the pair were engaged, and they married on 28 April 1950 at Srapathum Palace – just a week before his coronation. The wedding ceremony was presided over by the King’s grandmother, Queen Sri Savarindira, and Sirikit’s parents had to sign the marriage certificate under their daughter’s signature as she was not yet 18.\n\nBhumibol made her his queen, and the pair returned to Switzerland to finish their studies. They returned to Thailand in 1952.\n\nWhile studying in Switzerland, they had their first child, Princess Ubolratana, who was born on 5 April 1951. Their second child, and the heir to the throne, Vajiralongkorn, was born in Bangkok on 28 July 1952. Two more daughters followed, Princesses Sirindhorn and Chulabhorn, in 1955 and 1957, respectively.\n\nThe Queen is a talented writer and has written a special book – In Memory of my European Trip where she revealed insights into her time in Europe with her husband. She has also composed songs that have been played by the palace band.\n\nThe King, who was also called Rama IX, respected his wife and trusted her. As such, when he undertook the traditional period as a Buddhist monk in 1956, he named her as Regent. Rama IX was so impressed with how well she handled the role that he gave her a new title on his birthday that December – Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat.\n\nQueen Sirikit was the Queen consort of Thailand from 1950 until King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s death in October 2016. Their son ascended the throne upon the death of Bhumibol Adulyadej, and Sirikit is now known as the Queen Mother of Thailand.\n\nSirikit’s health has not been good since she had a stroke in 2012. She has refrained from many public appearances and has appeared weak when she has been seen by the public. The Queen has had several hospital stays since and primarily stays out of the limelight now that her son is on the throne.\n\nA special 90th birthday emblem was released by the Thai Public Relations Office and celebrations to mark her milestone birthday have been taking place throughout Thailand with exhibits and other events. A special exhibition “With the love of the land: With love for the Nation” has also been created by the government to honour the Queen Mother.\n\nShe is not expected to be seen on her birthday."
