        "text": "After more than 70 years as monarch of Thailand, King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s reign has come to an end. Bhumibol, the longest-reigning monarch in the world, held a demigod-like status in Thailand, with well-wishers gathering outside Bangkok’s Siriraj Hospital in recent days to pray for his recovery. Many observers believe his death is likely to throw the country into turmoil. Maha Vajiralongkorn, the Crown Prince of Thailand and heir to the throne, is a controversial figure and, for some, an unsuitable ruler."
