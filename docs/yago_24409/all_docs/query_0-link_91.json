It said she was able to \"breathe well and eat.\"\n\nIt said an X-ray revealed a lung infection for which she was being treated with antibiotics.\n\nThe queen has been in poor health for years and is known to have suffered a stroke.\n\nBhumibol, the world's longest-serving monarch, died on Oct. 13 after battling several illnesses for years. The country is observing a one-year mourning period."
