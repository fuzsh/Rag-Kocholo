        "meta_description": "Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej, also known as Rama IX, was the longest-serving head of state and monarch in Thai history, serving for 70 years. He died on October 13, 2016, following several years of illness. Widely respected at home and abroad, he was credited with restoring the prestige of the previously floundering institution of Thai monarchy and unifying a country beset with deep-seated political divisions.",

        "text": "Thailand’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy supports neighbouring countries to attain economic security, food security and self-sufficiency. The success of SEP projects also contributes towards peace, prosperity and closer people-to-people ties, which can apply to cooperation with countries beyond the region.\n\nThe new army chief took a softer line to dissenting political voices, as the country marked the anniversary of the 1976 massacre in which 46 students died.\n\nPrincess Bajrakitiyabha has a string of law degrees, campaigns for the rights of prisoners, and has served as a diplomat\n\nJust three months after being named Thailand’s first Noble Royal Consort in almost 100 years, former nurse Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi was stripped of her title\n\nFive years after the latest in a long string of coups, democracy is back in town in Thailand. Or at least, that’s what it looks like. But in Sunday’s election, winning the most votes and winning power are not the same thing."
