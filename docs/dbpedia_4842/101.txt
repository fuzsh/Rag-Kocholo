With the Hoops' imminent move to Tallaght, new boss Michael O'Neill has decided to strengthen his squad ahead of the Hoops' debut season in their new home.

Says O'Neill: "While we have some very good players at Rovers, the squad is slightly young in certain areas – the arrival of Ollie Cahill will be of great benefit to the players."

Cahill, who has enjoyed a glittering career, has been a great success at Cork City, Shelbourne and Drogheda United and won a variety of major honours, including three league titles.

"As well as having a lot of experience, Ollie also knows what's required to be winner," says O'Neill. "And he's also a versatile, left-sided player. He's a great signing."

Stephen Bradley comes to Rovers following last year's frustrating move to Scottish club Falkirk from Drogheda United – where he starred alongside Ollie Cahill.

"Stephen comes to Rovers after what was a difficult period for him," says Michael O'Neill. "I knew him from Falkirk and, without question, he is a quality player.

"He was a success at Drogheda, he's a Tallaght native, so he was keen to come and we wanted him. It's a great opportunity to kick-start his career and we're delighted to have him here."

The Hoops were set to sign Stephen Paisley, but the former Saint Patrick's Athletic and Longford Town defender decided to opt for First Division Sporting Fingal.
