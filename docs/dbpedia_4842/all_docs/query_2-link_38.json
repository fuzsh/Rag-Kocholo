        "text": "Fixtures and Results\n\nRathkenny Rovers U-12 team achieve a remarkable feat\n\nRathkenny captain Joe Gore receiving Cup from sponsors Drogheda Concentrates.\n\nAlso included in pic from left to right are Drogheda United players,\n\nBrian Shelly, Ollie Cahill, Stuart Byrne and Paul Keegan.\n\nUnder 12 team with manager Sean Wall after receiving Cup for winning\n\nthe Drogheda & District Schoolboys U-12 Division 1 title.\n\nRathkenny Rovers U-12 team achieved a remarkable feat when clinching the Drogheda & District League Division 1 title in their last game of the season recently.\n\nIt was only their second season operating in the league and they came out on top against clubs from areas of far greater population - Drogheda, East Meath, Ardee and Slane.\n\nThis win for the Rathkenny boys is a major boost for soccer in the area and hopefully will encourage more adults to get involved with the club.\n\nThe club hope to be in a position to field a number of other underage teams in the league for the 2007/2008 season but this will only be possible with the co-operation of parents and those interested in playing a part.\n\nWhile many other areas been been well catered for in terms of facilities for children to play the game Rathkenny seem to have fallen behind in this respect. However with the help and ideas of the people of the parish the club can grow to be as good as any in the north east.\n\nThe players have shown that on the pitch, that with the proper care, organisation, and coaching they are well able to hold their own in any league.\n\nDoes the youth of Rathkenny not deserve the same opportunities and facilities as those in Kilberry, Navan, east Meath, Ardee and Drogheda?\n\nEverything cannot be left to a handful of individuals to look after and run things. It is only by getting the co-operation and support of a cross section of the parish and getting people to put forward ideas that improvements can be achieved.\n\nThe club will hold an AGM in the coming weeks and it is hoped there will be a large attendance and that people will put forward their ideas, support the committee and drive the club forward.\n\nDetails of the agm will be posted on this website and will also appear in the local media.\n\nMATCH REPORT\n\nRathkenny Rovers 2\n\nArdee Yellow 0\n\nTWO goals from substitute Eamonn Cogan secured the Drogheda & District League under-12 division one crown for Rathkenny in this title decider in midweek\n\nRathkenny were two points adrift of their opponents going into this final game of the season and nothing less than the win was enough to secure the title.\n\nWith the sides deadlocked as the game entered the final quarter it looked as if it was heading Ardee way.\n\nHowever two second half substitutes, Robert Garry and Eamonn Cogan combined for the latter to shoot low to the net for the breakthrough for Rathkenny.\n\nThat forced Ardee to push forward and as they did they were hit once more with Cogan again applying the finishing touch.\n\nThe opening period had been a close tense affair with both sides playing a defensive game and as a result there was few opportunities.\n\nHowever the home side upped the tempo considerably throughout the second half and could have added a few more goals in the closing minutes.\n\nChristopher Meade, Gavin Markey and Andrew Crosbie were outstanding for the winners but everyone played their part throughout a long season.\n\nThe players were presented with the Cup and medals in United Park the following Sunday.\n\nThey celebrated their great victory with a night out in Funtasia, in Bettystown.\n\nRATHKENNY Lee Connolly, Christopher Meade, Conor Darby, Gavin Markey, Joe Gore, Andrew Crosbie, Jack Gore, Keith Timmons, Ryan Maguire, Eamonn Cogan, Robert Garry, Stephen Crosbie, Caolach Halligan, Ben Gore, Cathal Hickey, Tom\n\nGore."
