F Harkin I think. That one we'll just have to imagine but you get my point that to be fair it would require cameras at every game or else it would just be \"Goal Caught On Camera, Of The Month\"!\n\npete\n\nSure if the clubs gave a s*** they could easily get a local supporter to man the club camera at home games. Asdie from the tv publicity value theres so many other uses like coaching etc.... that couldn't cost much to run except for initial camera cost.\n\nAnyone know how much a camera (would have to be better than a camcorder) cost?\n\nwws\n\nmade a start with what they had it would be force them to get as many goals as poss....that means ionly sendin the one camera a la Richmond Park on Friday,,,,,,,,,,catch my drift?\n\nthey dont have to send a whole crew.....great advert made for the el to a largewr audience....without the boredom of having to watch a full game....which rarely works on live tv as our football stadia just dont get the right atmos for the majoirity of games\n\nha? ha? ha?\n\nI think its a good idea\n\nBernie\n\nApparently the goals from last Friday night can be downloaded from the RTE website , from the SIX ONE news section. Although due to my technical abilities I hopelessly failed to get anywhere.\n\nAny help lads??\n\njoe\n\nI can't find it now, though it was there yesterday - they seem to take them down as quickly as they put them up.\n\nhttp://www.rte.ie/news/2001/0908/6news/6news56_11b.ram"
