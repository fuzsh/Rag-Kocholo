        "text": "Brendan Clarke will take a leaf out of Ben Foster’s book and play on until his body tells him it’s time to hang up his gloves.\n\nThe former England goalkeeper announced his second retirement on Sunday at the age of 40, shortly after Wrexham’s 5-5 draw with Swindon Town.\n\nFoster returned to the game last March, six months after quitting the first time, to help the Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney-owned club win promotion to League Two.\n\nREAD MORE: FAI Cup quarter-final draw recap as Drogheda host Bohs and St Pats face Finn Harps\n\nClarke turns 38 next month and shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nThe Galway United netminder made his 500th senior appearance in the Tribesmen’s rearranged FA Cup tie with UCD, which ended on Monday in a 5-1 win for the First Division leaders.\n\nAfterwards, he revealed there were no plans to call it a day, and he reflected on some of the highlights of his 500 games to date.\n\n“I’m feeling good,” said Clarke. “It’s funny, I only saw Ben Foster retiring because he felt he couldn’t go on and he wasn’t living up to the standard that he expected from himself.\n\n“I think it’s going to be similar for myself.\n\n“I speak to people who have retired and ask them if they knew it was time and did they miss it, and I ask questions, but they all say they knew when it was time.\n\n“So I’m feeling good, the staff have been great with myself, managing training loads and stuff.\n\n“The last couple of years with Shels, it was the same with Damien (Duff) and Ian Morris before that, they gave me the freedom to train when needed for myself.\n\n“It was one of those where I didn’t need to take days off, I felt good. I haven’t missed a training session and I’ll keep going until the body tells me not to. It’s going well.”\n\nClarke’s career began at his beloved St Patrick’s Athletic, but it was at Sporting Fingal where he first achieved regular first-team football.\n\n“In 2004 Chris Adamson would have been there from West Brom, and James Gallagher would have been knocking around. Then they would have moved onto Barry Ryan,” he recalled.\n\n“I suppose I didn’t really start playing regularly until I went out on loan in the second part of 2008 to Sporting Fingal in the First Division and got 15-odd games.\n\n“On the back of that season I came back and met Johnny Mac and he said I was ready to play for the 2009 season.\n\n“But then whatever happened, Johnny moved on, Jeff Kenna came in, brought Gary Rogers from Galway with him and that season changed things for me at Pat’s at that time.\n\n“I knew I needed to go and play somewhere and I went onto Fingal, then there were the troubles there, so I ended up in Sligo and back with Pat’s.\n\n“But I think from 2010 at Fingal, that was the time I really started playing.”\n\nHe got his first taste of European football with Fingal.\n\n“That was my first year playing in Europe, away to Maritimo. That was some learning curve,” he said.\n\n“We had a good squad then, with the likes of Crowey (Glen Crowe) and Colin Hawkins coming in just before the Maritimo game. Ollie Cahill signed as well.\n\n“I was looking at these players that I would have grown up watching.\n\n“Obviously Hawks, I would have supported him as a kid and then I ended up breaking his ribs in Madeira!\n\n“I came out for a through ball, he went over the top of me and it was how he landed.”\n\nClarke went onto Sligo Rovers and won an FAI Cup there, before returning to Pat’s in 2012.\n\nA lifelong fan of the club - and with a strong family link - he was thrilled in 2014 to be a part of the team that finally ended their five-decade long FAI Cup drought.\n\n“That was huge, because obviously I’d been at finals (as a fan),” he said.\n\n“I can remember the ‘96 final, being 1-0 up and Tony Sheridan scores that lob in the old Lansdowne, and we get beaten in the replay.\n\n“Then obviously there was my own stuff, 2012, giving away the penalty (against Derry City).\n\n“I think it was seven finals since ‘61 that we were beaten in. To be a part of the team that won it will be something to look back on, especially with the family ties.\n\n“My granddad (Des Byrne) scored the OG in the ‘54 Cup final and lost that, and my uncle Sean (Byrne) was part of the ‘74 team that got beaten by Finn Harps in Dalymount.\n\n“They have all had their heartache, so to be the one to break that, I suppose, will be something to look back on.”\n\nThere’ll be plenty of time for further reflection - but retirement isn’t on the cards anytime soon.\n\nAnd with Galway way out in front in the First Division - and at home to Dundalk in the FAI Cup quarter-finals - there are plenty more memories to be made.\n\n“I still love bouncing into training and I love being around the group in training,” said Clarke.\n\n“I’ve been lucky to have been a part of some brilliant groups of people. Football aside they are brilliant people who make working really enjoyable.\n\n“The culture we have, especially in the last few years, is, no dickheads in the group. That’s what makes it enjoyable.\n\n“I have been a part of squads where one or two bad eggs can change the dynamic of the squad. Especially in the last couple of years I’ve been able to enjoy my football.”"
