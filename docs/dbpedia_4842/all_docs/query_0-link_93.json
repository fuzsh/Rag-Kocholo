        "text": "PFAI chiefs have urged footballers struggling with their mental health during the Covid-19 lockdown to come to them for help.\n\nSixty-three Ireland-based professionals recently took part in a Europe-wide survey undertaken by FIFPRO to determine how the shutdown has affected players.\n\nWhile it won't be fully completed until next week, the results from Ireland are known.\n\nThe findings show that 14 percent of those surveyed reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms.\n\nThat is higher than in normal circumstances, when it is one to eight percent among players and five percent among the general population.\n\nHowever 19 percent of the Irish pros reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Before the pandemic, 7 to 11 percent of players experienced those symptoms, and three to eight percent of the general population.\n\nPFAI Player Executive Ollie Cahill told Mirror Sport: \"For those struggling, it's all about taking the next step - to come forward to us because the structures are in place now for guys.\n\n\"The survey is a snapshot but it's reflective of where all of our professionals are and there are definitely lads out there there who are struggling and need help.\n\n\"It's just a matter of them coming forward and taking that next step.\n\n\"Last week we pushed out through social media guidelines on how to look after yourself. For some that will be enough, but others will need more help.\"\n\nNearly two thirds (64 percent) of the players surveyed report that resources available from their club and union for their mental health are sufficient.\n\nMental health consultant Mary Larkin of Pathways Counselling is working with the PFAI to help players who need assistance.\n\n\"We have Mary in place to help in that regard and players can see her in a private and confidential manner,\" explained Cahill, the former Cork City and Shelbourne winger.\n\n\"At the moment, that can happen over the phone or by Zoom, Skype or Facetime, etc.\n\n\"Some players have already done so - and some of them have touched base with us afterwards and have said that they shouldn't have waited that long, that the decision to go was life-changing in that they were able to turn a corner.\n\n\"The feedback is all positive and they've all said that they should have taken that jump earlier.\n\n\"It's a difficult time right now for everyone, but what we'd say is don't be afraid to talk to us.\"\n\nWhile nearly all the footballers surveyed understand the current situation, a minority (46 percent) believe that club training, in small groups and under strict hygiene rules, should be resumed - and the majority want to finish the competition, if necessary starting in July.\n\nAs things stand, almost two third of those surveyed are concerned about their future as a professional.\n\n\"Maybe the lads on 52 week contracts will feel they are stable enough at the minute, the lads who are in the first year of two year contracts,\" said Cahill.\n\n\"But that could change again in six weeks, depending on where we are.\n\n\"It's not surprising that there are 46 percent looking for a bit of normality and interaction and that could be the next step, if restrictions are somewhat lifted on May 5th.\n\n\"But who knows if that will happen\"."
