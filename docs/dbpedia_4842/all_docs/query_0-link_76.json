Leading them to accept what‚Äôs on film and face their struggles to learn and grow from it, is why I got into coaching. When you‚Äôre able to teach life skills through the sport you love, it makes being in this position not feel like a job.

Has been a great period of learning and growth individually as a coach and person, and have learned so much around building a strong environment, planning, teaching fundamentals and game style and reviewing players individually. Whilst it wasn‚Äôt successful in terms of win/loss, I know we have seen 36 boys improve no end from when they started, and have given them the foundations to progress their game no matter what level they end up playing at. #football #coaching #review"
