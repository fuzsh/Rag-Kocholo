        "text": "It's Pool Season!\n\nEffective Friday, June 14, 2024\n\nPark Pools\n\nMonday-Thursday, 12-3 p.m. & 4-7 p.m.\n\nFriday -Sunday, 11 a.m.-3 p.m. & 4-8 p.m.\n\nNeighborhood Pools\n\nMonday-Saturday, 12-3 p.m. & 3:30-6:30 p.m.\n\n*Neighborhood Pools are closed on Sundays.\n\nWe are excited to welcome you to our pools! Throughout the city, we have 23 indoor and outdoor pools that serve our swimmers annually. Join us for open swim, or one of our many other aquatic programs that we have to offer. In order to use Baltimore City pools, you must have a civic rec account. Please click here to create your account prior to arrival. No registration is needed. For questions and concerns, please call 443-677-2418.\n\n*For safety reasons, pool capacity may fluctuate depending on the lifeguard-swimmer ratio.*\n\nPool rules must be obeyed at all times.\n\nAll swimmers must shower before entering the pool area.\n\nAppropriate swim attire is required.\n\nIndividuals with open sores, skin rashes, or bandages are not allowed in the pool.\n\nFloatation devices are not allowed in the pool.\n\nGlass of any kind Is strictly prohibited.\n\nFood, chewing gum, and drinks are only allowed in designated areas and never on the pool deck.\n\nChildren under 13 must be supervised by an adult of 21 years or older at all times.\n\nChildren younger than six must be accompanied by an adult in swim attire and remain within arm's reach at all times.\n\nGuardians supervising groups larger than six require an additional adult. The ratio for children under six is one adult for every three children.\n\nAll diapers are prohibited. Those requiring diapers must wear swim diapers or snug plastic underpants under their swimsuits.\n\nMisconduct of individuals may result in the dismissal of the entire group.\n\nProfanity and vulgar language are not acceptable in the pool area.\n\nRunning, pushing, hazardous play, and spitting in the pool or pool deck is prohibited.\n\nPets are not allowed on the premises, with the exception of support animals (documentation is required).\n\nPersons appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs are not allowed on the premises.\n\nSwimmers under four feet tall must pass a water swim test or remain restricted to the wading pool.\n\nAll swimmers must demonstrate their swimming ability to staff to be permitted to swim in deep water.\n\nAqua shoes are allowed during water aerobic sessions as long as they are clean and free of all foreign debris. Elderly or disabled patrons who wish to wear aqua shoes must present a doctor's note stating the need for aqua shoes.\n\nNo bags will be allowed on the pool deck. If you bring a bag, there are a limited number of lockers for your use. The best practice is to come to the pool already wearing the appropriate swimwear (please see below), and avoid having to leave your bag in the lockers.\n\nAll persons on the pool deck, and/or swimming in the pool, are required to wear proper swim attire. All swimwear bottoms must have a liner. All swimwear must be clean. All infants/toddlers that require diapers must wear swimmer diapers and proper swimwear.\n\nWhy do I have to wear proper swimwear?\n\nStreet clothes (especially cotton) can transport airborne and ultimately water-borne contaminants into the pool.\n\nLycra and Nylon are the best non-absorbent material for swimming and are the best fabrics for proper swim attire.\n\n- Other absorbent materials (such as cotton) can break down in the water and cause fibers to clog filters.\n\n- Any \"colored\" material (unless specifically made for swimming) can bleed into the pool, affecting water chemistry and balance. This is also a reason for turbidity in pools.\n\nCotton and similar materials can absorb the chemicals in the water, causing the water to become less effective at maintaining the proper chemical balance or may cloud the water.\n\nPark Pool Locations:\n\nNeighborhood Pool Locations:\n\nIndoor Pool Locations:\n\nIndoor Pools will operate for programming only from June 15 through September 4. Indoor Pool registration is now open!\n\nPark Pools\n\nMonday-Thursday (1 hour clean up between each session)\n\n12-3 PM\n\n4-7 PM\n\nSaturday & Sunday (1 hour clean up between each session)\n\n11 AM-3 PM\n\n4-8 PM\n\nNeighborhood Pools\n\nMonday-Saturday\n\n12-3 PM\n\n3:30-6:30 PM"
