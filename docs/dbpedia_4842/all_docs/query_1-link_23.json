        "text": "And the Drogheda United midfielder, who has won four titles in the League of Ireland, says that most players within the league will have to forget about full-time football as a career option and look for work in other fields as the current financial crisis in the game is a \"wake-up call\" for Irish football.\n\nTwo years ago, Cahill (33) went through the painful experience of a financial crash that came after some success on the field as the Tipperary native helped Shelbourne win their third league title in four seasons in 2006, only to see the club implode and collapse within weeks of their triumph.\n\nNow it's happened again, this time with Drogheda, as the players, who only 13 weeks ago were just a kick of a ball away from knocking Dynamo Kyiv out of the Champions League, are facing a bleak winter.\n\nThe club is before the courts in a period of examinership, the players are being asked to survive on a payment of just 30pc of their wages, the squad is about to break up as their star defender Graham Gartland has been released from his contract early so he can find a new club abroad, and even players who are under contract for next season -- like Cahill -- know there is no guarantee about their future.\n\n\"It's a reality check for everyone and it means that a lot of players who have been full-time here in Ireland for a few years now will have to find work outside of football,\" says Cahill, who had successful spells with Cork City (1996-2002), Shels (2002-06) and Drogheda.\n\n\"It's a wake-up call for everyone as we can't go on the way we have been. Maybe it means that we can't sustain full-time football in this country.\n\n\"I think the players and the clubs have to come together now and be more realistic because the clubs can't afford the wages being paid now.\n\n\"I don't think you can blame the players. They were never going to turn down the money they were being offered so everyone has to be more realistic.\"\n\nCahill has a year left on his contract with Drogheda but, like the rest of the squad, has no idea what that means.\n\n\"It's before the courts and with the examiner now but we have no clue what will happen. All we know is that we're on 30pc of our wages now and that's not easy, especially for the players who have families.\n\n\"Some of the players are the main breadwinners at home and it's a big worry for them.\n\n\"I think we'll all have to start thinking about a career outside of football. I have done my coaching badge and I did a course in sports massage but I wish now that I'd given this more thought when I was younger.\n\n\"When Shels went bust two years ago no-one really acted, they thought it was just a one-off, but this is going on right across the league now and it's a worrying time,\" added Cahill, who will be in action on the field for United tonight as they take on Finn Harps.\n\n\"We have three games left in the league, so we're trying to win as many as we can to stay up high in the table.\n\n\"Making it into Europe next year is not realistic, as we're probably going to get a points deduction the way that Cork City were punished.\n\n\"The way the table is now, we have a chance of getting into Europe next year, especially if we win our last three games, but if we get 10 points taken off us, we'd slide down the table, maybe even into the bottom half.\""
