        "text": "Tim Cahill will lead the Socceroos into action against South Africa after Head Coach Ange Postecoglou today named the striker as captain for the farewell game at ANZ Stadium on Monday night.\n\nCahill will captain the Socceroos for the first time in his 68th international and today described the moment as: “the proudest day of my football career”.\n\nCahill, who along with Mark Bresciano is a vice captain for the Socceroos World Cup squad, has been given the honour after Postecoglou chose not to risk captain Mile Jedinak in the farewell game.\n\n“Tim’s leadership and the way he conducts himself in the group as a senior player has been impressive and with Mile not able to play against South Africa Tim will captain the side,” Postecoglou said.\n\nCahill will lead the Socceroos out onto ANZ Stadium in front of family and friends just kilometres from where he took his first footballing steps as a junior footballer.\n\n“This is far and away the proudest day of my football career,” Cahill said. “I think it’s an honour to put on the green and gold shirt and play for the Socceroos but to lead the team out will be amazing.\n\n“I’ve always said you don’t have to have an armband to be a leader but captaining my country in the sport that has given me everything in life is going to be an amazing experience and I look forward to the responsibility Ange has given me while Mile is out injured.”"
