        "text": "Cahill, Lockamy & Toone Highlight Big South Awards Haul\n\nFARMVILLE, Va. – Another year, another top-three Big South finish, and another crop of newly minted all-conference Lancers.\n\nOn the heels of a six-game Big South win streak, the program's fifth No. 3 finish in the regular season, and a bid to host the quarterfinals of the upcoming Big South Championship, Longwood women's soccer placed senior defender Kylie Cahill and rgaduate student midfielder Madison Lockamy on the All-Big South first team and senior forward Danielle Toone on the second team in the league's postseason awards announcement released Thursday.\n\nAlso joining Cahill, Lockamy and Toone on the conference awards list were starting freshman defender Brooke Bonner, who earned a spot on the Big South All-Freshman Team, and graduate student midfielder Madison Hommey, who was named to the Big South All-Academic Team.\n\nCahill, Lockamy and Toone gave Longwood at least three players on the All-Big South first and second teams for the seventh time in 10 years as members the conference and brought Longwood's total all-conference awards to 42 during that span. Only Radford, with 47 selections, and High Point, with 44, have amassed more all-conference awards than Longwood since the program's inaugural Big South season in 2012.\n\nAdditionally, Cahill's first-team recognition gave the Lancers an All-Big South first-team defender for the seventh consecutive year, while the defender-midfielder-forward trio of Cahill, Lockamy and Toone gave Longwood an all-conference pick at all three levels of the field for the first time since the program's Big South runner-up season in 2017. Longwood's awards haul also included honors for all three team captains in Cahill, Hommey and Lockamy.\n\nThose Lancers have helped lead Longwood to a 7-7-4 overall record and a 6-2-2 mark in Big South play in 2021, highlighted by an eight-game unbeaten streak and a six-game winning streak in conference play. The Lancers rank among the Big South's top four in both goals per game (1.80) and goals against average (1.15) in conference play heading into the postseason, as well as second with five Big South shutouts.\n\nCahill's first-team recognition puts her on a pedestal of elite Longwood defenders alongside former Lancer first-team backfield standouts Taylor Alvey (2019), Natalie Massey (2012), Carrie Reaver (2020), and Sydney Wallace (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019). As the latest in that line, Cahill has been the fulcrum of Longwood's defense at center back this season, starting 14 games and helping Longwood post five shutouts in Big South play. The All-Big South honor is her second, following the honorable mention recognition she received as a junior in 2020.\n\nLockamy's first-team award punctuates a standout five-year career in Farmville in which she has played in more than 80 games, made 48 starts and spent more than 4,000 minutes on the pitch. This year she has scored four goals and dished one assist, bringing her career totals to 14 goals, four assists and 32 points. Five of her goals have been game-winners, including the go-ahead strike in a 1-0 Big South win against Charleston Southern this season. The All-Big South award is the second of her career following her second-team honor as a junior in 2019.\n\nToone is in the midst of the best season of her collegiate career with career highs of five goals, four assists and 14 points. Each of those totals exceeds her previous three years at Longwood combined and places her among the Big South's top 10 in each category in conference play. Two of those goals were game-winners in back-to-back one-goal victories against Gardner-Webb and Campbell. The All-Big South award is the first of Toone's career and bookends a Lancer career that began with Big South All-Freshman Team honors in 2018.\n\nEmbarking on her own standout career behind Toone is Bonner, who was among the top freshmen in the Big South and top defenders overall in her debut collegiate season. A native of Lakewood, Colo., she has started 15 consecutive games entering the Big South Championship and has played every minute of all but one of those. Her contributions in the backfield have helped Longwood produce seven shutouts on the season and compile a 1.15 goals against average in Big South play.\n\nMeanwhile, Hommey is Longwood's latest representative on the Big South All-Academic Team, earning that spot with a decorated academic and athletic resume that spans five years at Longwood. A President's List honoree as an undergraduate studying education, she graduated this past May and returned to Longwood to pursue her master's in healthy and physical education this year. The winner of the Big South's prestigious Bob McCloskey Insurance Big South Conference Graduate Fellowship, Longwood's Dan Daniel Senior Award for Scholarship and Citizenship, and a two-year team captain, she has also served multiple years as President of the Longwood Student Athlete Advisory Committee. She has also excelled on the pitch as a four-year starter who has started every game this season and 63 in her career as a center holding midfielder.\n\nAll five of those Lancers will receive their awards before this Saturday's 6 p.m. Big South Championship quarterfinal matchup against No. 6 seed Gardner-Webb at the Longwood Athletics Complex. A win over the Runnin' Bulldogs would propel the No. 3 seed Lancers to the semifinals where they would face No. 2 seed High Point in High Point, N.C.\n\n2021 Big South Conference Women's Soccer Award Winners\n\nFirst-Team All-Conference\n\nF: Maddie Turlington, Sr., Gardner-Webb\n\nF: Skyler Prillaman, R-Jr., High Point\n\nF: Jessica Donald, Jr., Campbell\n\nF: Kat Parris, Fr., Radford\n\nMF: Emma Bushee, Sr., Campbell\n\nMF: Brianna Oliver, Sr., Radford\n\n•MF: Madison Lockamy, Gr., Longwood\n\nMF: Juliette Vidal, Sr., High Point\n\nD: Kayla Thomas, Sr., Radford\n\nD: Alex Deperno, Soph., High Point\n\n•D: Kylie Cahill, Sr., Longwood\n\nD: Cazzi Norgren, Soph., Campbell\n\nGK: Jenna Moran, Jr., Charleston Southern\n\nSecond-Team All-Conference\n\nF: Jackie Richards, Jr., Campbell\n\nF: Magdalena Schwarz, Jr., High Point\n\n•F: Danielle Toone, Sr., Longwood\n\nF: Emily Mashinski, Fr., High Point\n\nMF: Chloe Le Franc, Sr., High Point\n\nMF: Lily McLane, Sr., Radford\n\nMF: Kaleigh Backlund, Fr., Campbell\n\nMF: Gillian Oyos, Sr., UNC Asheville\n\nD: Laney Peabody, Jr., Campbell\n\nD: Erin Rush, Sr., Charleston Southern\n\nD: Mary Tierney, Jr., Campbell\n\nD: Marina Bradic, Sr., Gardner-Webb\n\nGK: Lauren Seedlock, Sr., Radford\n\nHonorable Mention All-Conference\n\nKaiya Boyd, F, Soph., UNC Asheville\n\nKennedy Dunnings, D, Jr., Radford\n\nAnna Kate Highsmith, F, Fr., Winthrop\n\nAshley Finn, F, Soph., USC Upstate\n\nJenea Knight, F, Fr., Charleston Southern\n\nAll-Freshman Team\n\nKat Parris, F, Fr., Radford\n\nEmily Mashinski, F, Fr., High Point\n\nKaleigh Backlund, MF, Fr., Campbell\n\nJenea Knight, F, Fr., Charleston Southern\n\nAnna Kate Highsmith, F, Fr., Winthrop\n\nTaylor Gardner, F, Fr., UNC Asheville\n\n•Brooke Bonner, D, Fr., Longwood\n\nAll-Academic Team\n\nJessica Donald, Sr., Campbell\n\nLauren McDonald, Jr., Charleston Southern\n\nMichaela Stone, Sr., Gardner-Webb\n\nCamille Pereira, Sr., Hampton\n\nSkyler Prillaman, R-Jr., High Point\n\n•Madison Hommey, Gr., Longwood\n\nCaroline Dipzinski, Sr., Presbyterian College\n\nBrianna Oliver, Gr., Radford\n\nCourtney O'Malley, Sr., UNC Asheville\n\nRaegan Meyer, Soph., USC Upstate\n\nHaley Hocking, R-Jr., Winthrop\n\nOffensive Player of the Year\n\nMaddie Turlington, F, Sr., Gardner-Webb\n\nGoalkeeper of the Year\n\nJenna Moran, Jr., Charleston Southern\n\nDefensive Player of the Year\n\nKayla Thomas, D, Sr., Radford\n\nFreshman of the Year\n\nKat Parris, F, Fr., Radford\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nSamar Azem, Campbell\n\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\n\nJessica Donald, F, Sr., Campbell\n\n#HorsePower"
