        "text": "Girls Varsity Tennis (10-2; 8-0 HVAL)\n\nA Clean Sweep in Trophies for Harvey Girls\n\nWhat a spring for Harvey’s girls varsity tennis team! The Cavaliers won the 2024 HVAL championship and then capped off their memorable season by capturing first-place trophies in both the newly instituted singles and doubles championships.\n\nHead coach Tim Cornell and assistant Keri Kiamie did a fabulous job in guiding the squad to achieving great success. Also deserving of credit was the leadership of the team’s senior captains Rachel Dickey, Kayla Lichtenstein, and Lucia Menn.\n\nThe season was full of highlights. Of course, the biggest one was Harvey’s girls’ very first HVAL regular season title and playoff championship.\n\nIn the championship match against the Watkinson School, the Cavaliers entered the doubles round having only won their No.1 singles match with sophomore Cindy Wang. “It was up to our doubles teams to bring home the title, which they did,” said Coach Cornell. The key match was at No.1 doubles with the team of Menn and sophomore Campbell French pairing up to win in a tiebreaker 7-5 to ensure Harvey’s first girls HVAL championship.\n\nAnother major highlight was seeing Wang follow up the team championship victory with her outstanding performance in capturing the league’s first HVAL singles championship. The icing on the cake was the victory of the team’s No.2 doubles team of ninth graders Arabella Serfilippi and Sarah Fisher in the HVAL’s first doubles championship.\n\nWang, who finished the season with nine wins and only two losses, earned both All-NEPSAC and HVAL All-League honors. Also winning recognition from both leagues were Serfilippi and Fisher, who went 8-2 as a doubles team. Junior Gabi Schneider also garnered HVAL All-League recognition. She went 6-3 in her singles matches. Lichtenstein, 7-0 in doubles and 1-0 in singles, earned HVAL All-League honorable mention:\n\n“In sweeping the conference, singles, and doubles tournaments to bring home three titles, the Harvey girls varsity tennis team had a historic season,” said Coach Cornell. He said what separated the Harvey girls from other teams in the league was their mental toughness and depth as they went 14-7 in matches that were decided by two games or fewer. “Our mental toughness up and down the lineup was huge as the girls never seemed to buckle under the pressure of a big game or match,” Coach Cornell said, adding “We had several absences throughout the season, but because of our depth, we were able to continually win in doubles.”\n\nThe coach credits much of the team’s success to the fact that the Cavaliers ended up with a 26-9 record in doubles over the course of the season. He also singled out this year’s newcomers singles players Wang and Schneider, and the “super freshman duo” of Serfilippi and Fisher “for adding to a nice nucleus from last year allowing us to take things to the next level this year.”\n\nWith the 2024 season now in the history books, Coach Cornell looks with enthusiasm to 2025. “With eight of our top 10 players coming back next year, the future looks very bright,” Coach Cornell said.\n\nAt the postseason dinner, Coaches Cornell and Kiamie announced the following recipients as winners of the special team awards:\n\nMVP: Cindy (Xinping) Wang\n\nMIP: Kayla Lichtenstein\n\nCoaches: Gabrielle Schneider\n\nCavalier: Arabella Serfilippi & Sarah Fisher\n\nJV Girls Tennis (1-6)\n\nShowing Clear Signs of Growth\n\nGrowing in knowledge of the game and developing the skills necessary to succeed on a competitive level are the aims of JV programs in high school sports, and it’s good to know that Harvey’s JV girls tennis team had its share of growth this spring season. Guided by head coach Kristen Allan and ably assisted by Michelle Menacho, the JV squad got a taste of interscholastic competition as the players grew through experience.\n\nCoach Allan said the season had several highlights. For one, there was the 8-7 victory of sophomores Evie Gambetta and Emma Trigona over Oakwood Friends Academy that clinched a 4-3 win. The coach said the consistent play and 100% effort of three ninth graders, Zoey Berman and Mallon and Rylan Gilligan, in the first positions was another highlight. A third standout moment for the coach was seeing ninth grader Chloe Campbell win the first singles match she ever played. Coach Allan also saw as a season highlight “all players being flexible about shifting lineups each week and showing a positive response to being paired with new team partners.” Last, but not least, the fact that all her players were gracious in defeat is a highlight as well, the coach said.\n\nWhile Coach Allan appreciated the effort and attitude of each of her players, she wished to recognize ninth grader Morgan Marable, whose early-season injury prevented her from seeing action on the courts. The coach said Morgan deserves mention for consistently showing up and supporting her teammates from the bench.\n\nWith growth as the aim, Coach Allan said the spring campaign was successful. “With many players brand new to the sport, the season reflected a year of growth,” Coach Allan said. “Many players commented at the close of the season that they enjoy the sport and would like to play more tennis and continue to work on skill development over this upcoming summer,” the coach said. Further reflecting, Coach Allan said, “Positive team outcomes over the course of the season include enthusiasm, collaboration, and laughter with partners and sportsmanship with the opposing team.”\n\nAt the end of the season, Coaches Allan and Menacho named the following as recipients of the special team awards:\n\nMVP: Mallon & Rylan Gilligan (doubles team) and Zoey Berman (singles)\n\nMIP: Joy (Jiayi) Chen\n\nCoaches: Chloe Campbell\n\nBoys Varsity Tennis (10-5 overall; 7-1 HVAL)\n\nBoys Enjoy a Turnaround Season\n\nThe boys varsity tennis team had a marvelous season, finishing as the HVAL runner-up. Head coach Peter Everett and assistant Brandon Paguada saw their team come one point away from winning a league championship as the Cavaliers battled Wooster in the title match, eventually losing 4-3. The big consolation to the team’s second-place finish was seeing the doubles team of junior captain Logan Alexander and sophomore Emmett Cahill capture the league’s inaugural doubles championship.\n\nThe season had several memorable highlights. Although the Cavaliers lost the championship to Wooster at the end of the spring campaign, they had beaten the Generals 5-2 earlier when the two rivals had met in the first league contest of the season and the first league match that Wooster had lost in five years. In the two teams’ second regular season meeting, the Generals edged Harvey 4-3.\n\nAnother major highlight was Alexander and Cahill’s winning the HVAL doubles championship in the first year the HVAL had established it.\n\nCoach Everett credits the remarkable turnaround of the program from last year’s 2-11 season to the depth of talent that this year’s team had. “Our doubles teams had excellent records because the bottom of our ladder was so much stronger than most of our opponents,” Coach Everett said. “Stats don’t help much here because our MVP Brian Goldban actually had a mediocre record of 7-7, while lesser players had strong records because they faced lesser competition,” the coach explained.\n\nCoach Everett called his team’s season “an unqualified success.” He said, “After winning only one match all of last season, we went 10-5 and came within a game or two of winning the league championship.”\n\nThe coach expects more good things to come next season. “I am equally excited about the future as we graduate nobody from this group, and the top three singles players this year were ninth graders,” Coach Everett said, adding, “We have a bright future ahead of us.”\n\nAt the end of the season the coaches selected the following two players for special team awards:\n\nMVP: Brian Goldban\n\nCoaches: Emmett Cahill\n\nJV Boys Tennis (0-4)\n\nSuccess Measured in Growth of Their Game\n\nThe JV boys tennis team, although finishing the season without a victory, came out of the spring campaign a winner in what is most important in JV participation – growth. JV head coach Jeff Seymour said he was very pleased “to see solid growth and improvement in every single player, both individually and in their work as teammates.”\n\nCoach Seymour and his assistant Ryan Johnson guided a team that was big on effort but short on experience. “Having our roster of tennis players double since last year has meant a lot of rebuilding for our new JV squad,” said Coach Seymour. “On our team were some of last year’s varsity members and some who had never played tennis before,” he said. It was the lack of experience that produced some tough matchups against Harvey opponents. “While we were overmatched in most of our contests, no player gave up or gave in,” Coach Seymour said, adding, “I’m proud of the team’s perseverance and ability to take on all comers, no matter how skilled.”\n\nThe season was not without highlights, however. Coach Seymour said one was seeing Samuel Koester and Lee Birch, two freshmen “newbies,” as he called them, hold off their opponents in a match against Masters. Another memorable match was freshman Daniel Kiamie’s singles victory over his Greenwich Country Day School opponent. Coach Seymour also enjoyed seeing senior Hayden Zhang and sophomore Henry He “grow from being novice players to vying for spots in our singles ladder,” Coach Seymour said.\n\nThe team captains this season were juniors Teddy Clement and Gianluca Putek. Coach Seymour was pleased with their efforts. “I appreciated Teddy and Gianluca’s daily leadership, getting us going each day and keeping the team in good spirits,” said the coach who credits the captains with helping to set the right tone. “On bus rides to Bedford Courts, the team developed a relaxed camaraderie, but always took practice seriously,” Coach Seymour said.\n\nThinking about what next season might bring, Coach Seymour believes this year’s growth and experience should make the prospects bright for a successful season. Coach Seymour said, ”With a year under our belt, the JV Cavs are looking to be a threat next year.”\n\nAt the end of the season, coaches Seymour and Johnson selected the following players for special team awards:\n\nMIP: Samuel Koester\n\nCoaches: Henry (Jiaxing) He\n\nVarsity Softball (4-3)\n\nTeam Spirit Abounds in Softball Season\n\nHarvey’s softball team enjoyed a solid season filled with some fine individual contributions and overall excellent team performances. In her first year as head coach, Michelle Marotta, along with veteran assistant coach Carolyn Bean, led the Cavaliers to a winning season.\n\nTeam captain and ace of the pitching staff, senior Gabby Bonilla, put up some impressive strikeout numbers. In six games pitched, she faced 144 batters, striking out 79. Another pitching highlight was seeing ninth grader Felicity Ristau in the circle for the first time on varsity and picking up a win for her team. Both Bonilla and Ristau were selected as WNEPSGSBA All-Stars. Bonilla was also an All-NEPSAC selection.\n\nAnother individual player highlight involved right-fielder Maria Marcos Munoz who made a clutch play to catch a ball that ended an inning and thwarted a possible rally by the opposition. Another defensive star was senior Fernanda Alexandre who stopped almost every ball hit her way at second base. Coach Marotta also singled out the season-long defensive play of sophomore Peyton Forde who handled the catching duties this season. “Peyton had the most plays behind the plate, 52 in total,” Coach Marotta said, adding, “She worked hard behind the plate, squeezing the third strike and not giving up many passed balls.” The coach also praised Forde’s enthusiasm. “Peyton always led the cheers while she was in the dugout, and always had a positive attitude,” Coach Marotta said.\n\nOn the offensive side, Bonilla finished with the highest team batting average at .571, which included three singles, five doubles, three triples and a home run. She collected 10 RBIs. The team’s second leading hitter was Ristau with a .533 average on four singles, three doubles, and one triple. She knocked in nine runs.\n\nCoach Marotta was impressed with the quality of the at-bats of several of the team’s hitters. “Felicity, Peyton, Maria, Sara (Strnad), and Sienna (Colgan) were most patient at the plate, with each drawing eight walks,” Coach Marotta said. In addition to her good eye at the plate, Strnad was adept at laying down perfectly executed bunts to move runners over.\n\nCoach Marotta was also impressed with the team’s overall attitude and performance. “With every pitch, the girls were always moving in the field, backing each other up, and In the dugout they were always cheering on their teammates,” Coach Marotta said.\n\nThe coach voiced her pride in what the Harvey girls accomplished as a team throughout the season. She said, “Having a 4-3 record is impressive considering half of our girls had never played. Everyone improved tremendously as softball players and being great teammates. They supported each other, cheered each other on, and helped in every way possible. Each girl walked away with her head up high, loving the sport and gaining as much knowledge as possible.”\n\nCoaches Marotta and Bean made the following selections for the team awards:\n\nGolden Glove: Fernanda Alexandre\n\nSilver Slugger: Gabriella Bonilla\n\nMVP: Gabriella Bonilla\n\nMIP: Peyton Forde\n\nVarsity Baseball (7-7)\n\nBoys Enjoy Second-Half Turnaround\n\nThe spring season for Harvey’s varsity baseball team took a few weeks to pick up steam, but the Cavaliers found some mid-season momentum and rode it all the way to the New England Small School Championship Tournament. The season did not end with a first-place trophy, but the Cavs can find satisfaction in knowing they gave it a good ride after a sluggish start.\n\nHead coach Ray Lacen and assistant Mark Milroy provided a steady hand when the team’s struggles to find wins in the early part of the season could have torpedoed the hopes of seeing any fruits of their labors.\n\nCoach Lacen said the turning point of the season was the game against Rye Country Day School when the Cavaliers notched their first win of the season against a team from a strong conference. “We played confidently and aggressively in that game,” Coach Lacen said. Entering the game the Cavs were just 2-4 on the season, but junior Jack Amann turned in the team’s best pitching performance of the season up to that game as he earned a 5-3 victory. “Jack was dominant in a complete-game win, and he set the tone for the other pitchers moving forward in the season,” Coach Lacen said. Sparked by that victory, Harvey went 4-2 the rest of the way. “After many weeks, the boys demonstrated what they were capable of when they play to their potential,” Coach Lacen said.\n\nAnother major highlight of the season was the one-hit, 1-0 shutout that senior Edwin Sanchez, an All-NEPSAC selection, tossed in the quarterfinal of the Small Schools championship tournament. Harvey’s ace left-hander’s gem came against The Wheeler School. He racked up 13 strikeouts in his masterful mound performance.\n\nThe team had three outstanding offensive players. Junior Luca Marano led the team in hitting with a batting average of .486. Freshman Jake Acosta was second with a .405 average, and junior Max Hernandez was third with his .371 avg. Hernandez’ hitting and catching earned him an All-NEPSAC honorable mention. On the pitching side the staff was led by a \\the three-man group of All-NEPSAC selection Sanchez, Amann, and junior Will Hargreaves.\n\nOne of the bright spots this season was freshman Jake Acosta, a catcher regularly, who played an exceptional shortstop. “Jake’s athleticism allowed for a smooth transition,” Coach Lacen said. Freshman Ben Shaw also made a position change this season as he moved from the infield to being the team’s everyday left fielder. “With a strong arm and a willingness to learn, Ben got better with every game,” Coach Lacen said. “Versatility like this is essential when you have a short roster as we did this year,” added the coach.\n\nReflecting on the season, Coach Lacen said this year's team was “formed and strengthened daily.” He said he stressed early on the importance of the players developing “trust in each other, in the coaches, and in the process.” The coach said, “We worked on this daily as a team and made it a priority. It will continue to be what drives us and we will always make it the marker of our success.”\n\nCoach Lacen is pleased with what the team accomplished and he looks forward to next season. “This is a young and talented group of young men who started to understand not only how to play the game, but how to think the game,” Coach Lacen said, adding, “The Cavs are coming in 2025!”\n\nCoaches Lacen and Milroy made the following selections for the special team awards:\n\nMVP: Jake Acosta\n\nMIP: Luke McCarthy\n\nTop Pitcher: Jack Amann\n\nTop Hitter: Luca Marano\n\nCavalier: Edwin Sanchez Jr.\n\nVarsity Golf (3-2 HVAL)\n\n2024 Team Makes History\n\nHarvey’s varsity golf team enjoyed a big finish to their spring season with the team capturing the HVAL first place trophy and junior captain Cade Gilligan producing the lowest score in the championship round to win the individual player championship trophy. It was the first time since 2003 that the Cavaliers won the team championship and a teammate was the medalist in recording the best score among all the competing golfers.\n\nHarvey head coach Doug Plaskett said seeing his team winning the league title was very satisfying. “We set out this season with a goal to be HVAL champions and we were able to reach our goal,” Coach Plaskett said.\n\nIn addition to entering the record books, Harvey’s 2024 squad of Gilligan, fellow junior captain Rohan Singh, ninth grader Leo Marano, and eighth grader Theo Yanni improved their play on some of the area’s most beautiful courses. Harvey’s home course is Bedford Golf and Tennis. When the Cavaliers traveled to compete against other schools, they played on meticulously manicured country club courses in Connecticut, Green Woods in Winsted, Candlewood Valley in New Milford, and Highfield in Middlebury. The team also played at New York’s Ardsley Country Club.\n\nAnother individual highlight was seeing Marano shoot a 45 and become the medalist in a meet against Forman at Candlewood.\n\nIn league postseason honors, Gilligan, Marano, and Singh were selected as HVAL All-League while Yanni earned an honorable mention.\n\nLooking toward next year, Coach Plaskett said he’s very excited knowing the entire team will be returning for another go at a first place trophy. “Our team is still fairly young and we are already thinking of next year -- thinking of another HVAL championship,” Coach Plaskett said. “Many players will continue to play over the summer and even find summer jobs in golf … like being caddies,” he quipped.\n\nCoach Plaskett and assistant Al Morse selected the following players as recipients of team awards:\n\nMVP: Cade Gilligan\n\nMIP: Lucien Fried\n\nSportsmanship: Leo Marano\n\nBoys Lacrosse (12-3 overall: 9-1 HVAL)\n\nRunners-Up in Rank; Champions in Grit\n\nIt was quite an exciting season for Harvey’s boys lacrosse team, who produced another spectacular regular season which put them in the hunt for a run at both the HVAL and NEPSAC championships. When all was said and done, the Cavaliers finished as champion runners-up in both leagues, a testament to their standout effort.\n\nTeam coaches Michael Scarsella, Jim Donohue, and Nick Leahy guided a team that went undefeated in the HVAL during the regular season for the second consecutive season and went to the HVAL championship game for the third straight spring.\n\nThe coaches received excellent team leadership from senior captains Jared Effinger, Wes Elkind, Mike Sorio, and Peter Sorio, and junior Jackson Saccomanno who joined their teammates in producing a powerful offense and a stingy defense. Their No. 1 seeding in the HVAL playoffs marked the second straight year they were the top seed.\n\nThis spring the Cavaliers were also invited to the NEPSAC tournament as the No. 2 seed and got the chance to play for the conference title. “The invitation to the NEPSAC tournament as the second seed and, ultimately, as conference finalist was tremendous recognition for the program,” Coach Scarsella said.\n\nIn addition to team highlights, there were a few personal achievements in 2024: Effinger achieving and surpassing his 200th career point, Saccomanno reaching and surpassing 100 career goals, and Oliver achieving and surpassing 200 career saves in goal. HVAL All-league and All-NEPSAC honorable mention honors went to Saccomanno who recorded 53 goals and 32 assists, Effinger, 28 goals, 24 assists, Elkind, seven goals, an assist, and 67 ground balls, Oliver, 113 saves plus four goals scored, and Mike Sorio with a goal and 30 ground balls.\n\nHaving lost in overtime in the 2023 HVAL championship game to Williams, the 2024 team came into the season prepared and determined to make another run at the league title. The majority of the team travelled to Florida during spring break to get ready for the upcoming season. Early season injuries to Effinger, the reigning Class C offensive player of the year, and Joe Altman (out for the season) could have put a damper on the start of the season, but the team stepped up and filled the void playing well and notching some early season wins until Effinger returned to play.\n\nThe team started the season 6-0 before Class B nonleague Greens Farms Academy ended the streak. The Cavaliers responded to that loss by going on another 5-0 run to end the regular season.\n\n“The 2024 team played with a tremendous amount of effort and determination throughout the year,” Coach Scarsella said, adding, “Despite having only 16 players for the majority of the season, the team showed incredible resolve.”\n\nWhen Effinger suffered a knee injury in the team’s last regular season game, Coach Scarsella called it “a huge blow” to the team. “More importantly,” he added, “the coaches and players felt terrible that Jared would miss the playoffs in his last season after seven years as a varsity player, four of which he was a captain.”\n\nReflecting on the season, Coach Scarsella said the team “made tremendous strides in 2024, coming off a successful 2023 season that had us fall just short of the HVAL playoff title.” The program says goodbye to six seniors who were major contributors to its success the past few years, especially in 2024. Among the six, three are going off to play college athletics, Effinger and Elkind, lacrosse and Oliver, football. “It’s great to see these players continue to play a sport beyond Harvey and is a testament to their dedication to athletics,” Coach Scarsella said. Effinger was selected as the New England Prep School D3 Offensive Player of the Year for a third straight year. Elkind, an All-NEPSAC selection, was chosen as a 2024 New England Prep School All-Academic player. Oliver was also an All-NEPSAC selection. Mike Sorio earned an All-NEPSAC honorable mention.\n\nAs for Harvey lacrosse next year, Coach Scarsella believes the 2025 team will have a strong group of returning players including co-captain Jackson Saccomanno, Ryan Byrne, Evan Vasile, Will Bland, Wyatt Bland, Jonah Kass, Connor Hardy, Jordan Collins, Ryan Dey and Jack Brockmann. He said he expects to see the Cavs next spring continue the success of the last two seasons.\n\nAt season’s end the three coaches made the following selections for the special team awards:\n\nMVP-Offense: Jared Effinger\n\nMVP-Defense: Wesley Elkind\n\nMIP: Ryan Byrne\n\nPlayers’ Player: Jackson Saccomanno\n\nCoaches: Evan Vasile\n\nUnsung Hero Award: Richard Sullivan\n\nVarsity Coed Track and Field\n\nProgram Making Great Strides in Year 3\n\nWith their third year now in the books, Harvey’s varsity track and field athletes can relax and take the time to reflect on another productive season. Under the guidance of head coach and program founder Christian Coscio and his assistant Brianna Sayegh, the track and field team saw 20 athletes set or break 20 records in individual events and relays this spring.\n\nThree team members in particular enjoyed a standout season. Junior Shae-Anne Falconer had a phenomenal end of the season, particularly in the shot put, which was her strongest event. From last year to this year, she improved in the event by about 6 feet. Falconer scored at both the NEPSTA and NYSAIS championships, the only athlete in school history to do so. Her efforts also earned her the first-ever All-NEPSAC honors for a Harvey track and field athlete. “Shae was more dedicated than ever before and put in the work to succeed,” Coach Coscio said. “We’re excited to see her continued growth and development next year.”\n\nCoach Coscio also singled out junior Felipe Torres who continued to perform well for Harvey this school year. He set numerous school records and earned All-NEPSAC honorable mention status in the 3000m run. “Felipe is dedicated to the sport and pushed himself all season,” Coach Coscio said. “He was unafraid to push himself and try new strategies and tactics when racing,” said the coach. “Felipe’s tenacity helps to motivate the other athletes and is much appreciated,” Coach Coscio said.\n\nA third athlete, seventh grader Ally Zimmerman, had a breakout season. “Ally may have been the most consistent athlete this season,” Coach Coscio said. Zimmerman helped set six different school records and placed well at the NEPSTA Championship in the 800m run. “Ally is a fierce competitor, unafraid to go for broke in her races,” Coach Coscio said. The coach is most impressed with her versatility. “Ally is strong enough to race the 1500 and competes in cross country but also has enough speed to drop down to the 400m dash and succeed there,” Coach Coscio said, adding, “I’m excited to see her continued growth and development in the coming years.”\n\nAlso getting a special shout-out from the coach are the team’s captains, juniors Sophia Beldotti, Adalay Shalov, and Spencer Hanson, and sophomore Mollie Weisberger. “Having four amazing captains made our coaching job so much easier and made the team so much better,” said Coach Coscio, adding, “We’re lucky to have them all returning next year.” In fact, most of the standout athletes are returning next year as only two team members were seniors. Some who performed well were brand new to the team and sport. This year’s roster also included four middle schoolers who made contributions both on and off the track.\n\nIn reflecting on the squad as a whole, Coach Coscio said, “We had a solid team that truly bought into the program.” He said, “This year’s group was probably the most consistent and dedicated track and field team I have coached in the three years it has existed at Harvey. They came into every practice to work, aiming to get better, and I’m proud of them for all their hard work and many accomplishments.” Coach Coscio said he is looking forward to “the many accomplishments yet to come.”\n\nAt the end of the season, Coaches Coscio and Sayegh announced their selections for the special team awards:\n\nMVP: Felipe Torres\n\nMVP: Shae-Anne Falconer\n\nTop Newcomer: Jake Brokaw\n\nTop Newcomer: Ally Zimmerman\n\nMost Improved: O’Neil Ellis\n\nCavalier Spirit: Lilah Groff\n\nBoys Varsity Rugby\n\nA Growing Youth Core\n\nA relatively young squad took to the pitch this season to represent our school. Under the direction of head coach Phil Lazzaro and assistants Connor Welles and Joseph O’Connell, the team grew tremendously over the season.\n\nTeam leadership was amply supplied by sophomore captains Jordan Falk and Vishal Thadani and senior Eli Cornell. Coach Lazzaro was pleased to have the team start the spring with a bonding trip down South. “The pre-season trip to New Orleans provided much-needed time to train as most of the team was comprised of rookies,” Coach Lazzaro said. “Many newcomers were thrust into starting roles due to injury, and the coaching staff was pleased with the team's overall development,” he added.\n\nThough unable to notch a victory on the season, a solid foundation, with 14 ninth and 10th-grade students, saw a great amount of match time, which will only help on the pitch next season.\n\nCoach Lazzaro appreciated the efforts of his two coaches. “Assistant coaches Welles and O’Connell did a tremendous job throughout the season in skill development of the young team,” Coach Lazzaro said.\n\nAt the year-end banquet, awards were given as follows:\n\nTed O’Connor Alumni Award: Spencer Hindle and Julian Marin\n\nBravery: Ben Lawrence-Comerford and Jason Nelson\n\nDiscipline: Jordan Falk and Will Herman\n\nJazz: Vishal Thadani\n\nGirls Varsity Rugby (9-4-1) ​\n\nA Solid Season for the Harvey Ruggers\n\nHarvey’s girls rugby team enjoyed a very successful season of playing seven-on-seven matches. Co-coaches Maddy Visintainer and Shannon Horan guided a gritty group of athletes who displayed skill and toughness on the pitch.\n\nThe season’s first match against a tough Rye High School team showed the Harvey girls were ready for a productive season. Harvey swept the visiting Garnets in three 7s matches, winning 7-5, 10-5, and 19-15. Sophomore field captain Sophia Collum scored a try and fellow sophomore Casey Kelly made a conversion kick to give Harvey a 7-5 win in the first match. In the second match, ninth grader Zoe Seltzer led the way, scoring two tries, and in the final match, Kelly scored two tries and made all three conversion kicks for 14 points, and sophomore Tessa Walsh scored what proved to be the game-winning try for Harvey.\n\nCoach Visintainer said Harvey’s victory against Horace Mann was another highlight. The Cavaliers were happy to avenge an earlier season loss to Horace Mann. In their second meeting, Harvey and Horace Mann played two matches of 7s with Harvey winning the first one 15-10 and the second match ending in a 25–25 tie. Sophomore Maeve Lazzaro scored two tries and Kelly one in helping their teammates take the first match. The second match was a battle as both sides played fast and fierce leading to a back-and-forth contest. For Harvey, Walsh scored two tries and Lazzaro and Seltzer scored one each.\n\nThe coach also enjoyed seeing her team play in a fun prom dress rugby scrimmage in which the players took on school mates with both sides, girls and boys, donned in prom dresses. “What a fun way to celebrate the end of our season,” said Coach Visintainer.\n\nThe coach acknowledged the leadership of Collum on the field and the team captains, junior Lily Acrish and Lazzaro and Kelly. Lazzaro and Kelly were two leaders on offense, tallying the most tries. Junior Savanna Acosta was a standout on defense, leading the team in tackles.\n\n“Coach Horan and I are so proud of our team,” Coach Visintainer said, adding, “Not only do they love the sport, but they bring so much positivity to every practice and game and are truly committed.”\n\nCoach Horan shared her delight in how the girls rugby program is developing. \"Another successful season, not just in terms of record, but also in the development of both individual players and the team as a whole,” Coach Horan said. “The growth of the team in numbers and skill from last year has allowed the program to continue to advance,” the coach said, adding, “Having more returning experienced players helped cultivate a positive and supportive environment for new players to learn and improve.\" Coach Horan also said, \"It's exciting to see what this program can continue to do in the years to come.\"\n\nAt the end of the season, the two coaches made the following selections for the special team awards:\n\nMVP-Offense: Casey Kelly\n\nMVP-Defense: Savanna Acosta\n\nSportsmanship: Grace Xue\n\nMS Baseball (5-2)\n\nTeamwork and Sportsmanship Stood Out\n\nThe Harvey Middle School baseball team enjoyed a winning season as the players grew in their knowledge of the game and honed their skills. Head coach Greg Littleton and his assistant Nate Alexander were at the helm of a squad that came together as a team and played the game the right way.\n\n“The boys were invested in each of the games, even the ones that were runaway wins on our side,” said Coach Littleton, who was impressed with how well they performed. “Even the losses were close games, with the final decision coming down to just one or two key plays,” added the coach.\n\nIn a season when the team won five of its seven games, there were plenty of highlights, but Coach Littleton said it was the little things his team did that he chooses to single out. He recalled a game in which he gave Sam “Bart” Palevski the steal sign with two outs and two strikes on Derek Lugo, the team’s best hitter who would lead the team in hits and batting average. Coach Littleton said, “Sam couldn’t believe I was asking him to steal, but indeed I was. He almost made it safely to second base, but was thrown out. That third out ended a hitless inning for us, but it allowed Derek to lead off at the top of the next inning when he ripped a double to spark a high-scoring inning. That kind of teamwork, coming at an unexpected time, was the type of collaboration on the field that made our team strong.” The coach added, “Sam won the Spotlight Award for his strategic attempted steal of second base.”\n\nCoach Littleton shared another recollection from a game in which his team overmatched the opponent. The coach recalled: “The opposing batter drew a walk -- perhaps his first time on base all season. As the batter approached first base, our first baseman Jonathan Cappucci gave him a high-five on making it onto the base paths. It was not a condescending gesture – John wasn’t gloating – but an actual congratulations from one of our most experienced players to an opposing player for his accomplishment.”\n\nA third memorable moment for the coach was a game in which Ben Tobias, a player well-seasoned at third base, had a sore arm and was replaced at the last minute with first baseman Gavin Fogarty. “Gavin made several amazing plays at third base, proving that our experienced infield was well-rounded and capable of playing many different infield positions,” Coach Littleton said.\n\nIn addition to timely hitting, Coach Littleton credits the team’s success to the pitching, catching and fielding, “The infield was outstanding all season long and it was flexible so we could move guys around as needed and to keep other players healthy,” Coach Littleton said.\n\nAlong with coaching a well-rounded team with many excellent players, Coach Littleton also enjoyed working with Coach Alexander who served as first base coach and became a soft-toss expert over the course of the season. “This group was amazing,” Coach Littleton said while reflecting on the season. “Each and every member of the team supported each other and always cheered each other on. For me, that’s the kind of coaching experience that makes a season memorable.”\n\nAt the end of the season, the coaches announced the following selections for the team awards:\n\nMVP: Peter Adler\n\nMIP: Samuel Palevski\n\nCavalier: Jonathan Cappucci\n\nMS Coed Tennis (2-5)\n\nLearning How to Court Success\n\nThe Harvey Middle School coed tennis team had its fair share of joy and heartbreak in playing competitive tennis this spring, but as it is with all middle school sports, the emphasis is on learning how to play the game and developing the skills needed to match up with an opponent on the court. Under the guidance and tutelage of head coach Octavia Man Jones and assistant Angela Pignataro, the middle school squad enjoyed a fruitful spring.\n\n“This was an amazing season with continuous improvement throughout the season,” said Coach Jones. “There were great wins and heartbreaking losses, but, most importantly, every single match was played with heart, amazing effort, and with great attitude, and I’m extremely proud of the whole team,” the coach added.\n\nEighth graders Corinne Owen and Sameera Britton were not only the team captains but match partners who did a fine job in both roles. “Corinne and Sameera made a great doubles team who received a lot of praise from parents and coaches of opposite teams for their excellent attitude on and off the court,” Coach Jones said. “Their contributions were certainly one of the highlights of the season,” the coach added.\n\nAnother highlight for Coach Jones occurred when the team lost some of their key players to other school commitments and the remaining players welcomed three new members, seventh graders Jack Campagna, Jake Schindler, and Matt Leand, and brought them up to speed on team matters. “I was impressed with how well they performed,” Coach Jones said, adding, “Together, they played some of the best games and adapted very well to the change and didn't lose a beat.”\n\nCoach Jones also singled some individuals for their contributions. She said, “Eighth grader Ethan Gabin and seventh grader Adam Desrocher played very well together and helped out each other a lot.” They won the first and last game for the team for the season. Also praised were seventh graders Marcus Espitia and Emerson Sanchez for playing “with a lot of energy and delivering some good wins.” Coach Jones also saluted seventh grader Cole Nevens for being “calm, calculated, and very encouraging toward his teammates.” The coach also recognized the contributions of seventh grader Johann Fueting who received the Spotlight Award. “Johann always played with a positive attitude and gave a tremendous effort no matter the opponent he played against or who his double partner was,” Coach Jones said.\n\nIn reflecting on the growth and development of the skills of the players, Coach Jones shared her pride in the quality of the effort and the desire to become better at the game. The coach said, “The team worked extremely hard to improve their serves, forehands and backhands, and I’m very proud of what they accomplished.”\n\nCoaches Jones and Pignataro selected the following players for special team awards:\n\nMVP: Ethan Gabin\n\nMIP: Adam Desrocher"
