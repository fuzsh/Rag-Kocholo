He was obviously disappointed to be left out of the Chelsea side a few months ago, but he has come back and taken his chance again.\n\n\"He has been different class and is England's best centre back. For me he has been brilliant all season long.\n\n\"The manager has taken him out and stuff, but for me he has been playing at a very high level. In the big games he has a lot of experience and he steps up to the plate.\"\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
