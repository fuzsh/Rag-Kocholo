        "text": "While Diplo is most known for his skills on the turntables, he’s also a father of three kids: Lockett, Lazer and Pace.\n\nThe DJ, whose real name is Thomas Wesley Pentz, shares sons Lockett and Lazer with his ex-girlfriend Kathryn Lockhart, and son Pace, with model Jevon King.\n\nOn Father’s Day in 2023, Diplo posted a carousel of photos and videos on Instagram of all three of his sons and penned a heartfelt message in the caption about the parenting lessons he’s learned over the years.\n\n“Best advice I heard about being a dad was to imagine being 80 years old and looking back at the way you interact with your children,” he wrote in part. “I always want to be there for my boys to make sure they know they are loved more than life itself and they are always enough.”\n\nHere is everything to know about Diplo’s three kids: Lockett, Lazer and Pace.\n\nLockett Pentz, 13\n\nDiplo and Lockhart welcomed their first child together, son Lockett, in October 2010.\n\nThese days, Lockett is taking after his dad and has an interest in music. Diplo frequently shares videos of him and his brother Lazer playing the drums, the piano and other instruments on his Instagram Stories. In the last video featured in Diplo’s 2023 Father’s Day post, Lockett can be seen belting out the lyrics to U2’s “Sunday Bloody Sunday” during a family jam session.\n\nLockett has also gotten involved with his father’s performances, taking the stage during a September 2023 show in Canada. Diplo put him on flag duty and in a video the proud dad shared on Instagram, Lockett hoisted and waved the Canadian flag as Diplo deejayed.\n\nAside from music, Lockett’s mother has described him as a “free spirit” and has shared that he is very passionate about social activism. Following the school shooting in Ulvade, Texas, Lockhart shared a photo of Lockett holding up a poster with the words, “No more gun violence,” written on it.\n\nShe captioned the post: “He takes active shooter drills seriously. He gets upset when kids laugh during these drills, because he knows if it wasn’t a drill, they would be dead. I’m proud of him, but I’m also sad for him.”\n\nLockhart also shared photos of Lockett protesting with her during the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Four years later, Diplo took Lockett and Lazer to a music festival in Montana, and wrote on Instagram that spending time with his boys is \"truly important.\"\n\nLazer Pentz, 9\n\nDiplo and Lockhart welcomed their second son, Lazer, in November 2014, however, the pair had already split by the time he was born.\n\nLike his brother, Lazer is also a budding musician. In fact, as Diplo shared on Instagram in 2023, he hosts a summer camp for kids every year at his house where kids can learn music, and both of his elder sons attend.\n\nOn Lazer’s 7th birthday in 2021, Diplo shared more insight into his son’s personality and music talents on Instagram.\n\n“You love to draw and play with your sword u just started to learn trumpet, you are very uncooperative but I can get you to play in my band sometimes,” he wrote alongside a series of photos and videos of Lazer.\n\nThe following year, on his 8th birthday, Diplo revealed in another birthday tribute that Lazer’s ultimate dream is to become a YouTuber. While he might not want to fully follow in his dad’s footsteps, the “Lean On” producer supports his son’s dreams.\n\n“As your dad ... Whatever your dreams are I will do my best to make them come true,” he wrote in the caption. “In a few years when your deep into your career as a youtuber / social media / parkour rap / rock star and discover this old post I want you to know I love you with all my heart.”\n\nIn February 2024, Diplo shared some of his favorite moments from a skiing trip with Lazer and Lockett, including a picture of him and his middle son taking a cuddly nap.\n\nPace Pentz, 4\n\nDiplo and King welcomed their son, Pace, in March 2020.\n\nThe model and former Miss Universe contestant announced her pregnancy and Pace’s birth on social media, however, she didn’t reveal the identity of his father for several months.\n\nOn Mother’s Day 2020, Diplo confirmed that King was the mother of his third child with a sweet Instagram tribute to all the moms in his life, including his own mother, Lockhart and King. Since then, Diplo and Pace have shared plenty of father-son moments, including trips to the zoo and teaching Pace how to swim.\n\nIn March 2023, Pace turned 3 and King took him to Disney World to celebrate, documenting the trip in an Instagram Reel. In the video, the mother-son duo both wore matching shirts that read, “Pace turns 3.\"\n\nThe toddler celebrated another big milestone in September 2023: his first day of preschool. King shared a carousel of adorable photos of Pace dressed for the big day, as well as a sign that stated he wants to be a pilot when he grows up and a few of his favorite hobbies, including reading, traveling and playing with his friends."
