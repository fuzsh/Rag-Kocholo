        "text": "TOWSON, Md. – While most students are enjoying time off this summer, junior goalkeeper Kristen Sample of the Tiger women's soccer team is working in Ireland while training for the upcoming season. Over the next several weeks, she will check in with TowsonTigers.com to tell her experiences of life in Ireland.\n\nIn her latest entry, Sample talks about attending a professional soccer game featuring Real Madrid and traveling to Holland to visit friends.\n\nWhat a week! Hard to believe I'm almost done my time here. I feel like I haven't been here very long at all. I'm almost at a month and it feels like I've been here only a week. So, I have a whole week to catch up on. First I would like to correct a typo in my previous entry. At the end of the last entry, I said I play with my “co-stars.” I'm not a star and I don't work with people who are stars, so I don't know why I wrote that. I play with my co-workers.\n\nI did end up going to Holland for the weekend. I really wanted to train with the U19's, but my friend couldn't have me over the other weekend, so I had to work around her schedule. It worked out well though. I got up early on Saturday, made it to the airport and I was in Holland by 10:30. When I had talked to Wendy the night before, she said that the weather had been pretty good and was expected to be nice on Saturday as well. I arrived to rainy weather. Meanwhile, it was sunny in Dublin. Grass is always greener in Ireland, I suppose ☺.\n\nAnyways, I got into Holland, saw my friend who I hadn't seen in several years and met her boyfriend for the first time. I was amazed at how good his English was! I knew Wendy spoke very good English, but I had not expected it with Walter. It was comical actually. Whenever Wendy would start speaking Dutch, he would interject and say it's rude to the guest to not speak English around me. Later on, I realized that most of their television shows are in English with Dutch captioning at the bottom. Apparently, Holland is one of the only countries in Europe to do that, which is probably why the Dutch are better with their English than most other non-English speaking countries.\n\nWe went to their new house first. They had just moved in a year ago, but luckily, it was still close to her village. When I had visited her last time, I enjoyed how relaxing it was to be in a small town, yet at the same time, there was always something to do, whether it was watching a match, or going to a bar/restaurant.\n\nLucky for me, Saturday is one of the two days that the market in the village runs. Wendy's parents run a stand in the market that's all dog foods and treats. Of course, I had to think of my pups back at home and I certainly got them some goodies that I'll be shipping back this weekend. I also picked up some Dutch cheese. I'm not really a big cheese fan, but oh my lord, I could eat that cheese all day any day. It's an anytime meal for me. It was delicious. Actually to be fair, everything was delicious as it was a refreshing break from the more traditional (bland) Irish foods. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Ireland, but it's definitely not a destination that will thrill your taste buds.\n\nWe went to Germany that night for dinner and for the first time ever, I had Schnitzel. What a treat. I'll be on a hunt to find a good authentic German restaurant in Towson when I return. And I have every intention to go back to Germany some day after sampling some beers with my dinner. The last time I had gone to Holland, I also went to a really delicious ice cream shop in the village. Unfortunately, the ice cream was too big for me - or rather, my eyes were much bigger than my stomach. Needless to say there was a large portion of ice cream that went to waste. That was not the case this time. I ate all of my ice cream ... and some of Wendy's and Walter's. I also got hooked on Nutella while I was over there. When I came back to Dublin, I picked up a jar to put on my toast!\n\nThe real excitement of the week happened on Monday night. I DID get to go to the Real Madrid game. The stadium was filled at 10,951 people, who were mostly Rovers supporters. We took the tram to get to the game and then went to a bar across the street from the stadium. By “a bar,” I mean the only bar in the general vicinity. There were no other options and they don't serve in the stadium. It took 30 minutes in the MASS of people to finally get our orders in. We moved on to the game and I was thrilled to see we were literally 3 rows from the field. How beautiful. I've been to 2 professional soccer games so far; I was 10 rows from the field for the first game, 3 rows for the second game. I'd say it was absolutely worth the €60.\n\nI can say that I got to see Christiano Ronaldo's first game for Real Madrid. Thoughts? He's much taller in person than I would have expected from watching him on TV - must be because he has a tiny head. He only played for a half and I'm about 90% sure that Iker Casillas, the chief reason that I wanted to go to the game, was not even on the island of Ireland. Apparently, the coach gave players who had participated in the Confederations Cup some extra time off. That was really a letdown. I idolize Casillas and was so looking forward to watching him play. Imagine my surprise when I realized he wasn't even warming up.\n\nAll in all though, still a great game. I forgot that Metzelder and Sneijder played for Real Madrid and both were on the side of the field that I was on. It was really incredible watching the touch some of the players have. It's absolutely mind blowing when you think you've seen good soccer in the U.S.; Then, you come to Ireland to watch the League of Ireland, which is certainly not one of Europe's top leagues, and you see how good some of the players are. Even more incredible was the fact that Real Madrid put so much money out for Ronaldo when he was playing against players who have to work day jobs as well. Hearing the ridicule towards Ronaldo from the fans was really funny and it was enhanced by the fact that Ronaldo didn't score once and Real Madrid just won the game in the last 5 minutes.\n\nThe atmosphere for the stadium was unlike anything else I've ever experienced. I've always heard it's an incredible opportunity to go to a professional game in Europe because of the fans alone. I don't know what I expected in Ireland, but if Ireland is just the tip of the iceberg, then I am DYING to go to a proper EPL match. One player for the Rovers, Gary Twigg, played for Manchester United. The Rovers fans have a special song for him that goes to the tune of “You Are My Sunshine.” I was definitely not expecting that, but I couldn't help but laugh every time I heard it.\n\nAfter watching Real Madrid and seeing Ronaldo only play for 45 minutes of the game though, you have to wonder how conceited is that Kaka would say that he and Ronaldo are worth as much as was spent on them when Kaka himself didn't even play! Regardless, I can still say I got to see Christiano Ronaldo's first game with Real Madrid.\n\nI think I've taken more pictures at matches than I have anywhere else in Ireland. In fact, one guy that I work with, Ollie Cahill, is a defender for Rovers and he played the entire second half on my side. I got a plethora of pictures of him, Ronaldo, Metzelder, Sneijder, and Barry Murphy (Rovers GK).\n\nShamrock Rovers will play one more big game (that I know of) on Monday against Hibernian from the Scottish Premier League. I don't plan on attending that one though. I should probably hold onto some of my money.\n\nThere's not much else that's new. We still play football on Wednesday but we only had 8 for most of the time yesterday and then 6 for about 15 minutes (got a great run in that way). One of the teams in the League of Ireland is competing in Champions League and they had one of their big deciding games last night (which they lost in the last 3 minutes), so a lot of the people who normally play were at that game. I can't complain too much though; it just means I get to touch the ball more!\n\nMy parents sent me a packet and with it was some Old Bay, so I'm very excited to make some Maryland style dishes for my co-workers and my roommate. I love cooking for Brian because he thinks everything is great! And he assumes it's all hard to make too! It's very flattering. I'm glad I have Irish cooks that I'm competing with. I made brownies for Brian last night and he had NEVER had them before. I couldn't believe it. Brownies were a regular part of my diet for about 5 years of my life. He had a whole row in one sitting because he liked them so much.\n\nTomorrow, a bunch of people from our work are going to a stand up comedy gig in town. From there, the weekend only gets better. One of my favorite bands had their show sell out in Baltimore but as luck would have it, they are playing in Dublin on Sunday. Yes, I will be going to that show.\n\nI love my job and I love the people I work with. I wake up every morning and think that my life couldn't be much better than it is right now. I'm right where I want to be, working for the company I want to work for, and literally just living my dream."
