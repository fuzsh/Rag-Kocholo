        "text": "On International Mentoring Day, I look back on my own career, through which I've been fortunate enough to have mentors and sponsors who believed in my potential and provided support that has been instrumental in my journey. I've talked before about how important it is for women to have a support system of female mentors around them when they're rising in the ranks. What's not spoken about enough in my opinion is the importance of also having male sponsors. Not only do they offer alternative perspectives from our own, but their advocacy can be a catalyst for change, breaking through gender biases and fostering environments of inclusion. One way of describing it is in the context of having a seasoned guide on a challenging mountain expedition. ‚û°Ô∏è A mentor, regardless of gender, is like a knowledgeable sherpa, providing advice, sharing insights, and helping you navigate the unpredictable terrain. Now, think of a male sponsor as not just a sherpa but a seasoned mountaineer who has conquered those peaks before. They not only guide you but also actively pave the way, helping you climb higher and faster. Just as a seasoned mountaineer can open up new paths, male sponsors can break through barriers that might be harder to dismantle from the outside. #InternationalMentoringDay #Inclusion #Mentorship #Sponsorship\n\nIt's always heartening to see an organization that truly commits to the holistic development of its players. One such organization that caught my attention is Rees Foundation's Whai Basketball, right here in our backyard - Tauranga, New Zealand. You know what really stands out about them? Their multidisciplinary approach to training, which spans across numerous modalities including Men's NBL, Women's Tauihi, 3x3, and their deeply integrative Academy structure. Picture this, a new recruit just steps onto the court under the strong Tauranga sun for his first Men's NBL training. Fresh-faced, eager but also understandably nervous. At Whai Basketball, he's not just drilled on jump shots and lay-ups. Instead, he's gently integrated into a culture that prioritizes skills, tact, and strategy in equal measure with mental tenacity, sportsmanship and even academics. An all-rounded skillset that not only makes him a better player on the court but a sharper individual off it. Now let's zoom out a bit. Whai Basketball also promotes women's basketball through their Women's Tauihi programme. Here, it's not just about perfecting the three-pointer, but empowering women athletes, fostering a sense of community, and breaking gender stereotypes. What about the fast-paced, exhilarating 3x3 game format? Nutritional awareness, physical conditioning, and quick decision-making are the champions here. The message? Adaptability. Resilience. Then, of course, comes the Whai Basketball Academy. Think of it as the cradle where the future Kiwi stars are groomed. Here, young talents are nurtured beyond just competitive play, emphasising character-building, teamwork development, and ethics. Isn't that the true spirit of sports? I'm often asked, John, what is the key to a successful sporting career? My answer is almost always the same - a complete and sound foundation. By tailoring unique programs across different facets of basketball, Whai Basketball is genuinely delivering this foundation to its players. Inspiring? Certainly. But also, a testament to how sporting organisations can create a larger positive impact on society when they think beyond the court. So, here's to fostering sporting cultures that cultivate athletes who are not only victorious in their games, but also in their lives. Now that's a slam dunk.\n\nüèÄToday, I had the incredible honor of sitting down with Benny Mills, a true changemaker in the world of basketball. His program for Indigenous Basketball Australia is not just a game changer; it's a life changer. Benny's dedication to nurturing young talents is lighting up pathways for the next generation, offering them opportunities to shine both on and off the court. His work is a beacon of hope and a testament to the power of sports in transforming lives. In our conversation, we delved deep into the essence of basketball and its impact on society. We also discussed my own efforts in educating society about breaking down biases, especially in understanding adolescence. One key topic we focused on was the importance of a gender-neutral approach in addressing the cycle of intergenerational abuse and domestic violence. It's this kind of progressive change that's vital for creating a safer, more inclusive future for all. Benny Mills is not just developing athletes; he's nurturing leaders and visionaries. His work is a reminder that when we invest in our youth, the future indeed looks brighter. That‚Äôs my book House of Shadows in this hands.

This snapshot on the stats of how girls in sport are more likely to advance in their careers and in life caught my attention. It makes me proud to work at the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club and the Senators Community Foundation as a woman leader in sport, promoting healthy, active living as well as encouraging girls‚Äîand all kids‚Äîto get involved in sport in some way. If each of us took a moment to think about how getting active, getting outside, or getting involved in a sport has impacted us or someone we know, I believe we would all come to similar conclusions: Moving our bodies improves our mindset. Physical activity releases endorphins, which can enhance mood and reduce stress. Regular participation in sports can also build mental resilience and improve overall well-being. Along with sports teams, come friendships and people we can count on. Being part of a sports team fosters a sense of belonging and community. It creates opportunities to form lasting relationships and provides a support system that extends beyond the field or court. The lessons that sport gives us include losing and winning gracefully, the ability to believe in ourselves, and the trust to rely on our teammates. #Sports teach valuable life skills such as perseverance, teamwork, and leadership. They also help us learn to handle success and failure with grace and to believe in our abilities. All of these life lessons lend itself to living our best lives ‚Äì in person and in the workplace. As a passionate leader who is interested in lifting up others, in particular women, to advance their careers, I want to know what YOU think the benefits of getting involved in sports are. Let's share our thoughts and experiences to further highlight the importance of sports in our lives and how it has impacted our careers.\n\nü•Ö Interested in gender-inclusive coaching in sports? The adidas Breaking Barriers Project launched last week its second research paper ‚û° Empowering Her Game: Exploring the Importance of Gender-Informed Coaching. This research, led by Breaking Barriers partner Women Win, \"shows there is a need to change the design of the sports system, with coaching being just one of many elements that help create an environment where anyone can thrive. This is not just about driving for greater equality but about creating an inclusive, equitable system where girls‚Äô differences are recognized and celebrated\". Coaches aren't only sports specialists but also role models and mentors. Let's keep investing in coaching approaches and strategies that are more suitable for everybody!

Baker, along her two daughters, has founded Women's Coaching Alliance. Here's the not-for-profit's vision, per the organization's website: \"When more young women see coaching experience as leadership experience, more will raise their hands to coach. Investing in these young women are at the core of our values because then: More kids will see women as leaders and role models early on. More communities will have the coaches they need so more kids can play. More young women will see the value of making a difference in their communities. More young women will speak confidently about the leadership skills they learned through coaching. More mentors will emerge to support these young women making a difference. More young women will emerge with the foundational skills, confidence, and support to lead. More organizations will have a growing pool of leader-ready young women to hire in their communities for roles in business, sports, community organizations, non-profits, education and beyond.\" This could not ring more true to us at Whole Child Sports, Pam. Kudos to you and your girls. Thank you for such a succinct depiction of the society altering, generational impact more equitable engagement and representation in youth sports coaching can have. Back in 2013, Scott Lancaster, Kim John Payne and I wrote about the importance of recruiting more women coaches to youth sports. Among the many reasons more women in youth sports is a must, we wrote that \"As a woman and a mother, you have a great deal more to contribute to your children‚Äôs sports experience than scheduling, carpooling, preparing snacks, and cheering from the sidelines. We know this is obvious, but it still bears mentioning. You can imbue your coaching style with sensitivity to your players‚Äô physical and emotional needs, teach them with age-appropriate rather than command-driven attitudes, and nudge them along while shielding them from the soul-damaging focus on winning at all costs that permeates the youth sports system today.\" #girls #women #womeninsports #wholechildsports #youthsports #leadership #womenincharge #socialchange, #womensrights, #womenleadership, #womenempowerment #football #sports #coaching #mentoring #change\n\nDeveloping and empowering young people extends beyond mere social responsibility; it stands as an investment in the future of societies and the global community. We are compelled by numerous reasons to emphasize the imperative nature of nurturing and empowering our #youth. This investment not only aligns with moral principles but also holds significant strategic value. It lays the foundation for a more robust, prosperous, and equitable future, benefiting both individuals and communities alike. By equipping #young people with the essential tools, resources, and opportunities, we illuminate the path toward a brighter tomorrow. The @Foundation for Generational Thinkers (Foget gh) is unwavering in its commitment to a diverse array of programs and projects designed to holistically develop #young individuals, thereby preparing them for responsible adulthood. Below, we provide an introduction to some of our pioneering initiatives: ü©∏ 1. My Identity Boot Camp: My Identity is a gender-focused program designed to help #young boys and girls discover their unique qualities, appreciate their collaborative differences, and understand the roles each gender plays in society. This initiative aims to address gender-related issues, dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions, and promoting the importance of embracing the distinct attributes of each #gender. ü©∏ 2. SCHOOL CLUBS: The Generational Thinkers School Club is a mentorship program that empowers students across various academic levels. We focus on nurturing strong mindsets, positive attitudes, and smart goal setting to position our members as transformative contributors to society. Through engaging workshops, we inspire club members to make lasting impacts within their schools, homes, and communities, emphasizing the importance of leaving meaningful legacies for future generations. The Generational Thinkers School Club operates as an integral part of the @Foundation for Generational Thinkers, furthering our mission to shape responsible and forward-thinking leaders for generations to come. ü©∏ 3. STUDENT LEADERSHIP SUMMIT: This leadership initiative is spearheaded by the Foundation for Generational Thinkers (Foget gh). As the architects of molding aspiring young individuals into influential leaders, FOGET introduced the Student Leadership Summit (SLS) as a mentorship workshop, aimed at equipping student leaders with the skills needed to become enduring, dedicated, and impactful agents of change. The SLS leadership program employs a practical and interactive framework as its educational cornerstone, providing these budding leaders with a welcoming yet informative introduction to the captivating, albeit sometimes intricate, realm of leadership. FOGET's overarching mission is to revolutionize the existing #leadership paradigm, fostering a more altruistic and sustainable approach for the betterment of society. #FOGET #lifecoaching #youthdevelopment #GES #values #Ambassador"
