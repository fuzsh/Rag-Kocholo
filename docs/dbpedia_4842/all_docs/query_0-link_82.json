        "text": "There appears to have been a breakthrough of sorts in the ongoing row between the Ireland women's soccer team and the FAI.\n\nMediation talks will take place this evening.\n\nIn a statement SIPTU have confirmed that the team will not attend training this afternoon ahead of Monday's friendly against Slovakia.\n\nPFAI Ireland Player Executive, Ollie Cahill, explained:\n\n\"At a team meeting the members of the Women's National Team decided that they are unfortunately unable to attend today's training camp.\n\n\"The players have not taken this decision lightly. The players wish to make clear that they simply want the FAI to respect their right to choose their own representatives and have all the outstanding issues which are affecting their ability to achieve their maximum potential for their country resolved in a swift, amicable and professional manner.\"\n\nMembers of the team and their PFA Ireland and SIPTU representatives will attend a meeting at six this evening with a mediator to discuss the issues in the dispute. Representatives of the FAI will also be meeting with the mediator.\n\nIreland winger, Aine O'Gorman, says having the player body represent them is not an unreasonable request.\n\n\"It's been a frustrating time that us as a nation are staying stagnant\", she said.\n\n\"A lot of countries like England, Australia and America have the right that their players association can represent them and deal with their negotiations on their behalf so that they can focus on football.\n\n\"We just haven't been given that right which is really frustrating. We just want the PFAI to deal with our player welfare so that we can get proper travel apparel, reimbursement for loss of earning and wi-fi in hotels - all so we can focus on our football and being the best that we can be as a team.\""
