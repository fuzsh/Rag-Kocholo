        "text": "Lateral Ankle Pain in a Female Runner—An Under Diagnosed Etiology\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Colleen Maher, DO\n\nAustin Klomp, DO, and Kathryn Vidlock, MD\n\nAffiliation: HCA HealthONE Family Medicine Residency, Aurora, Colorado.\n\nHistory: A 48 year-old female presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of right ankle pain for several months. The pain was localized to the lateral aspect of the ankle, was described as aching, and was rated moderate in severity. Pain was worse with exercise, particularly running. There was no associated numbness, tingling, swelling, redness, ecchymosis, popping, clicking, buckling, grinding, or instability. Patient had not tried physical therapy (PT) or injections. Her only past medical history was hypothyroidism. Patient had a ganglion removed from her lateral right talus approximately 3 years prior with residual catching over the lateral aspect of her ankle. Prior MRI imaging demonstrated scarring over the peroneal tendons. She had seen several orthopedic surgeons who suggested surgery to debride the scar tissue, but she declined as she was worried about recurrence.\n\nPhysical Exam: General: Healthy-appearing, no acute distress, normal body habitus, normal gait, no limp, ambulating without assistance devices, single limb heel rise. Cardiovascular: Posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses normal bilaterally. No edema or varicosities bilaterally. Normal capillary refill bilaterally. Ankles and feet: No erythema, induration, swelling, warmth or deformity bilaterally. No tenderness of the bony, soft tissue, or ligamentous structures bilaterally. Active range of motion limited to 20 degrees of plantar flexion on the right. Negative anterior drawer and talar tilt bilaterally. 4/5 strength of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and posterior tibialis on the right.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n1. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome\n\n2. Fibular stress fracture\n\n3. Cuboid stress fracture\n\n4. Sural nerve entrapment\n\n5. Achilles tendinitis\n\nTest Results: Ultrasound: intact peroneus longus and brevis tendons without tearing or subluxation. Scar tissue throughout, specifically surrounding the sural nerve. MRI: posterolateral subcutaneous, fascial, and Kager's fat pad scarring with slight subcutaneous tissue and surrounding nerve retraction with concern for nerve entrapment. Mild peroneus longus tendinosis without tear and flattening of the peroneus brevis without tear. No peroneal tenosynovitis. Mild distal achilles tendinosis without tear.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Sural nerve entrapment.\n\nDiscussion: Given its superficial location, the sural nerve is a common site for peripheral nerve biopsy, grafting and as a block for general anesthesia. However, the superficial location also predisposes to injury and entrapment. Entrapment is most commonly due to fascial thickening at the superficial sural aponeurosis where the nerve runs superficially to the gastrocnemius. In the literature, sural nerve entrapment is described as rare, however this is thought to be due to underdiagnosis. While surgical intervention for decompression via fascial release is an option, a less invasive option of ultrasound guided hydrodissection can provide significant symptom relief and allow for return to activity.\n\nOutcome: The patient did PT for Graston and dry needling therapy. After 4 weeks, she returned with improved flexibility and balance, but no change to her pain when exercising. She underwent successful ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of the sural nerve with 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine and 1 mg of Dexamethasone. She used crutches as needed for 2 weeks. On re-evaluation, her symptoms had significantly improved.\n\nFollow-Up: The patient was able to return to all of her normal activities including her prior vigorous running routine. She has been able to run several local races and has remained pain-free at all subsequent follow ups.\n\nA Case of Severe, Intermittent Left Gluteal Pain\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Michelle Gorbonosov, MD\n\nJill Kropa, MD, and Jason Womack, MD\n\nAffiliation: Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Family Medicine Residency, New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nHistory: A 46-year-old male was referred to the sports medicine clinic for 7 years of left gluteal pain. The pain was intermittent, radiated down the left leg, and woke him up at night. The pain was triggered when pressure was applied to his left gluteal muscle. He denied weakness, numbness, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder incontinence. He took naproxen and acetaminophen with some relief. Previous imaging of his lumbar spine showed a degenerative disk at L4-L5. He completed over 12 weeks of physical therapy and had multiple lumbar epidural injections with minimal improvement. An EMG showed slowing of the left peroneal nerve. He was referred to the office to evaluate for an ultrasound guided piriformis injection.\n\nPhysical Exam: General: No acute distress, sitting comfortably. Back: Tenderness to palpation of the posterior left hip in the area of the piriformis. No tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine. Strength 5/5 of bilateral iliopsoas, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Full range of motion of the back and bilateral hips without pain. 2+ DTRs of the bilateral knees and ankles. Sensation to light touch intact. Normal gait.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n6. Piriformis syndrome\n\n7. Femoral Acetabular Impingement\n\n8. L4-L5 Disc Herniation\n\n9. Schwannoma\n\n10. Sarcoma\n\nTest Results: POC US: A 2 × 3 cm hypoechoic, non-calcified, well circumscribed mass in the area of the left piriformis and greater sciatic foramen. The sciatic nerve was not well visualized at the level of the piriformis. MRI Left Hip w/contrast: Along the left sciatic nerve is a mildly lobulated, sharply marginated, fusiform 4.4 × 3.5 × 3.2 cm lesion with intermediate T1 and heterogeneous T2 signal. There is intense enhancement post gadolinium and peripheral fat signal intensity with mild central enhancement.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Schwannoma.\n\nDiscussion: Point of care ultrasound showed a hypoechoic round mass noted in the left piriformis without good delineation of the sciatic nerve. An MRI of the left hip was ordered to further evaluate the mass before considering further intervention. The MRI showed a probable schwannoma of the sciatic nerve. The patient was informed of this result and was referred to a surgeon for evaluation and removal of the mass.\n\nOutcome: The patient underwent excision and biopsy of the sciatic nerve tumor with decompression of the sciatic nerve. The pathology was consistent with a schwannoma.\n\nFollow-Up: After successful removal of the schwannoma, the patient's symptoms resolved. He was able to return to daily activity without any residual pain.\n\nGroin Pain in a Dancer After Landing a Jump Split\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Darcy Lei, DO\n\nVictoria Heasley, MD, Stephen Dailey, MD, and Timothy Foster, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nHistory: A 13 year old female competitive jazz and pom dancer presented for evaluation of acute right groin pain. During a dance performance, she did a jump and landed in a right leg forward split with immediate sharp, right-sided groin pain radiating to her gluteal region and medial thigh. She reported pain walking off the stage and could not perform the rest of the day. She localized the worst of her pain along the right ischial tuberosity and into the groin. The pain was diffuse even at rest and provoked with walking, standing on the right leg, or trying to turn in bed. She described the pain as sharp with movement, but sore at rest and at the end of the day. She had rested from dance practice and tried ibuprofen without pain relief at the time of presentation.\n\nPhysical Exam: She had antalgic gait with moderate limping on the right leg while walking into the exam room. She was tender to palpation along the ischial tuberosity, directly over the pubic symphysis and just lateral to it. Active range of motion was painful with decreased adduction and extension. Her strength was 3/5 with hip extension and adduction, but 5/5 with hip flexion and abduction. Pain worsened with standing on the right leg and log roll maneuver. Sensation to light touch was intact throughout lower extremity dermatomes, and there was no bruising or swelling noted.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n11. Ischial tuberosity apophyseal avulsion\n\n12. Ischial tuberosity apophysitis\n\n13. Pubic symphysis apophyseal avulsion\n\n14. Adductor strain\n\n15. Quadratus femoris strain\n\nTest Results: Initial x-ray of the pelvis showed open growth plates without avulsion fracture or physeal widening. An MRI was ordered which showed Grade 2 muscle injury with partial thickness tearing of the right obturator internus, obturator externus, and quadratus femoris muscles. There was no evidence of ischial tuberosity avulsion fracture or pubic symphysis abnormality.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Right grade 2 muscle strain with partial tearing of the obturator internus, obturator externus, and quadratus femoris muscles.\n\nDiscussion: Obturator externus, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris are external rotators of the hip and help with joint stability. Tears in these muscles are uncommon in adults and adolescents. To our knowledge, there are no current reports of acute injury to all 3 simultaneously. These injuries typically result from strong eccentric contraction or extreme end range of motion. Clinical diagnosis is challenging since tears of these muscles can present as nonspecific groin, hip, or gluteal pain and require MRI for definitive diagnosis. It is important to keep acute injury to the hip external rotators in mind for athletes working at end range of motion, such as in our case.\n\nOutcome: At follow-up after her MRI, she still had pain with range of motion and weakness with hip extension and adduction. Due to her continued pain with weight bearing and limited motion, she was placed on rest from dance practice and competition for 4 weeks. She started with physical therapy to work on hip strengthening and range of motion and used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed.\n\nFollow-Up: After 1 month of physical therapy, she slowly started returning to dance specific activities but continued to have some pain with range of motion. At 2 months post-injury, she started to move through functional progression pain free. By 3 months, she had returned to full dance practice without pain or functional limitations.\n\nGroin Pain in a Lacrosse Player: It Is Not That Hip\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Caitlyn Haines, MD\n\nJayson Loeffert, DO\n\nAffiliation: Penn State Hershey, Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\nHistory: An 18-year-old male college lacrosse player presented to training room complaining of severe left groin pain and inability to bear weight. He was seen in the Emergency Department a few days prior, was diagnosed with a muscular strain and discharged home with crutches. No imaging was performed at time of initial evaluation. He noted that he had since developed subjective chills and worsening of his pain to the point that he was unable to put weight onto his left leg. Pelvic radiograph was obtained and he was then directed back to the ED for further evaluation. On admission, his vital signs were meeting sepsis criteria.\n\nPhysical Exam: General: well-appearing in no acute distress. MSK: unable to weight bear. Tender to palpation over anterior/lateral hip. Full passive range of motion but no active range of motion secondary to pain. Motor strength 2/5 hip flexion and extension. Neurovascularly intact. FADIR positive, FABER negative, 90/90 test negative.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n16. Septic arthritis of pubic symphysis\n\n17. Osteitis pubis\n\n18. Adductor muscle strain\n\n19. Femoral neck fracture\n\n20. Pelvic stress fracture\n\nTest Results: (1) Bloodwork - leukocytosis 12.25 K/µL, ESR 31 mm/hour, CRP 27.83 mg/dL. Positive blood culture for MSSA. (2) x-ray pelvis—Osteitis pubis and irregularity at the pubic symphysis. (3) MRI pelvis—Numerous subchondral sclerosis about the pubic symphysis and cortical irregularity with some edema. Evidence of symphyseal joint effusion, left adductor/rectus aponeurosis. (4) Ultrasound-guided aspiration—small pubic symphysis joint effusion. Aspiration with return of grossly purulent fluid.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Our patient was diagnosed with septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis.\n\nDiscussion: Case reports of spontaneous septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis in athletes have been described but are rare. Other risk factors include female incontinence surgery, pelvic malignancy, and intravenous drug use. The predominant pathogen found in athletes is Staph aureus. It is critical to differentiate this diagnosis from osteitis pubis, which is a sterile inflammation of the pubic bone that results from muscular stress. Septic arthritis usually differs from cases of osteitis pubis due to acute onset and concomitant fever in the majority of cases. Management usually includes antibiotic treatment over 6 weeks due to high prevalence of osteomyelitis.\n\nOutcome: Orthopedic surgery recommended an MRI as well as an ultrasound-guided aspiration of the pubic symphysis, which yielded grossly purulent fluid. He was discharged home on a course of IV cefazolin for 6 weeks. He worked with physical therapy for introduction of gentle exercise. His labs were followed outpatient with improvement in inflammatory markers and resolution of leukocytosis.\n\nFollow-Up: Following completion of his antibiotic course, he began gradual activity progression. At this time, he has resumed all activity without restriction or pain. He recently played in a lacrosse tournament without difficulty and is starting practices in anticipation of the spring season.\n\nAbnormal Involuntary Foot Positioning With Prolonged Biking\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Crystal Graff, MD\n\nLindsay Burke, MD, and Adele Meron, MD\n\nAffiliation: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.\n\nHistory: A 60-year-old male with history of right ankle fracture status post fixation in 2008 and essential tremor presented with right foot pain and muscle spasms while biking. He reports a 2 year history of spontaneous involuntary ankle supination occurring about 5 miles into his typical twenty mile per day bike ride. He notes associated discomfort due to malpositioning of the foot inside his biking shoes, as well as cramping pain which radiates proximally into his calf and posterior knee. Toe curling of the affected foot typically precedes these events. He made mechanical alterations to his bike and used an ankle brace without relief of symptoms. He denies weakness, paresthesias, or history of low back pain.\n\nPhysical Exam: Physical exam was significant for tenderness to palpation over the right anterolateral tibiotalar joint near previous hardware placement, full strength throughout bilateral lower extremities, and intact sensation. He had notable large amplitude right upper extremity resting tremor, mild right lower extremity resting tremor, asymmetric bradykinesia and rigidity. Achilles' and patellar reflexes were 2+ bilaterally; he had no clonus and downgoing Babinksi. His posture was stooped and gait was non-antalgic.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n21. Focal task-specific dystonia\n\n22. Chronic ligamentous ankle instability\n\n23. Ankle fusion hardware failure\n\n24. Peroneal neuropathy\n\n25. Lumbar plexopathy\n\nTest Results: Right ankle x-ray 6/2022: Status post ORIF of a bimalleolar fracture right ankle which appears well-healed without hardware complication. Mild early degenerative changes of the tibiotalar joint. MRI brain w/wo contrast 9/2022: Unremarkable brain MRI. Specifically, no structural abnormalities to account for history of parkinsonism. Dynamic biking video 7/2022: Evidence of involuntary plantarflexion of the foot and inversion of the ankle with prolonged stationary biking.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Focal task-specific dystonia/paroxysmal kinesiogenic dystonia associated with Parkinsonism.\n\nDiscussion: Focal task-specific dystonias most often affect the upper limb and are characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contraction. They are often associated with activities such as writing, playing an instrument, or playing sports. In this case, the patient experienced a dystonic posturing of his right foot with prolonged biking, which has not been reported in the literature to date. Symptoms were elicited and captured on video with prolonged stationary biking. Dystonias are often associated with a central movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease, therefore an extensive work-up is warranted in this case, especially given history of essential tremor.\n\nOutcome: The patient underwent a medical bike fit with physical therapy without relief of his symptoms. Referral was placed to a neurological movement disorder specialist for further work-up for Parkinsonism. He was started on paroxetine for tremor suppression. Future treatment options may include oral anti-spasticity agent or botulinum toxin injections for optimal management of focal dystonia.\n\nFollow-Up: Discussed with patient that he may continue to bike as tolerated; however, pain level and perceived ankle instability may necessitate reduction in bike riding distance at least temporarily. Return to biking at the intensity prior to injury will be determined by his response to oral tremor/tone suppressing medications.\n\nRunning Up That Hill: A Case of Nighttime Arm Pain in a High School Cross-Country Runner\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Dylan Rogers, DO\n\nLaura Owczarek, MD\n\nAffiliation: Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan.\n\nHistory: A 16 year-old male cross-country runner presents to the sports medicine clinic with right upper arm pain that began 10 months prior. No history of injury or traumatic event. Describes the pain as achy, present throughout the day, but it is much more significant at night and has been interfering with sleep. The pain has been stable since it's onset and is neither improving nor worsening. Lifting weights will mildly aggravate the pain. He has not tried any medications for treatment. He was evaluated at an urgent care shortly after the pain began. X-rays were performed that showed a periosteal reaction, and he was referred to our department. He denied any fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, weight loss.\n\nPhysical Exam: Inspection: No erythema or lesion noted bilaterally. Palpation: Tenderness to palpation in the right mid-humerus. ROM: Full active ROM bilaterally. Muscle strength: 5/5 in biceps, triceps, and rotator cuff bilaterally. Pain reproduced with manual muscle testing of biceps, triceps, and rotator cuff on right side. Neurovascular: Intact, no deficits.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n26. Ewing Sarcoma\n\n27. Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis\n\n28. Osteoid Osteoma\n\n29. Osteomyelitis\n\n30. Stress Fracture\n\nTest Results: XR: Periosteal reaction of the mid shaft of the R humerus. MRI: Marked periosteal thickening and edema of the posteromedial aspect of the R humeral diaphysis. CT: Long segment of periosteal reaction surrounding the diaphysis of the humerus with thickening of the bone cortex. Bone Scan: Area of increased radiotracer uptake at the site of the periosteal reaction. No other lesions are noted. Path: Fragments of reactive woven bone with associated fibrosis and inflammation. Negative for malignancy.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO).\n\nDiscussion: CRMO, also described in the literature as Chronic Non-bacterial Osteomyelitis (CNO), is a rare condition with reported prevalence of 0.4/100 000 worldwide. Typical presentation includes insidious onset nighttime bone pain with or without fevers, and 1 to 20 active bone lesions- most commonly affecting the metaphysis of long bones. Histologic hallmarks of this disease process are bone inflammation in the absence of infection or malignancy. NSAIDs are first line treatment, however some patients require methotrexate, TNF inhibitor and/or bisphosphonate therapy. The IL-1 inhibitor, anakinra, has also been reported as a successful treatment option.\n\nOutcome: Our patient underwent a bone biopsy to rule out malignancy/infection and confirm the diagnosis of CRMO. Due to the rarity of this disease, a second opinion was obtained from an outside pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis of CRMO. NSAID therapy was initiated with resolution of his pain.\n\nFollow-Up: Four weeks after bone biopsy he was cleared to return to running. He will be evaluated by rheumatology as approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with CRMO have an associated autoimmune disorder, including skin disorders and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Due to an average reported remission rate of 40% (with common recurrence) he will be followed closely by orthopedic oncology.\n\nFriday Night Palsy Saturday Morning Mystery\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Jorge Sucar-Marquez, MD\n\nPeter Rippey, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of South Alabama, Alabama.\n\nHistory: Sixteen-year-old male football player with no significant medical history was found face-down on the sideline after unwitnessed injury on the field. Patient was involved in a punt-return play and walked off the field apparently unscathed. A few minutes after, the sports medicine staff was alerted that a player was collapsed on the sideline. He was found face-down, confused, and indicating significant pain in his head and neck; with no recollection of the mechanism of his injury. Spinal stabilization protocol was performed by the Sports Medicine staff. Patient was noted to have altered-mental status and hemiplegia of his right arm and leg. Patient was transferred to the nearest trauma center where seizure activity was noted.\n\nPhysical Exam: General: In moderate distress due to pain. Head: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Cardiovascular: Radial and DP pulses 2+ bilaterally and equal Eyes: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extra-ocular movements intact. Neck: Midline tenderness along C3-C5. Neurologic: AO x2, following commands. Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Hemiplegia of the right upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact bilaterally Musculo-Skeletal No visible deformities. LUE and LLE strength 5/5 grossly. RUE: 1/5 elbow flexion, and shoulder abduction. Unable to grip. RLE: 1/5 plantar/dorsiflexion, 1/5 hip flexion and abduction.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n31. Spinal cord injury\n\n32. Concussion with abnormal findings\n\n33. Todd's paralysis\n\n34. Intracranial hemorrhage\n\n35. Transient ischemic attack\n\nTest Results: Chest x-ray: Normal. CT head without contrast: Normal. CT cervical spine without contrast: Normal. CT thorax with contrast: Normal. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast: Normal. MRI head and neck: Normal. Comprehensive metabolic panel: ALT 65, AST 73, otherwise normal electrolytes and renal function. CBC: WBC 5.83, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 181 9. Coagulation studies: PT 14.4, PTT 27, INR 1.09 10. Urine drug screen: negative.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA).\n\nDiscussion: SCIWORA is defined as traumatic myelopathy without radiologic evidence of fracture or instability. It is mostly seen in children often occurring in the cervical spine due to its increased mobility, ligament laxity, and large head-to-body ratio. Incidence reports from different authors vary from 6% to 19% and 9% to 14% of spinal injuries in children and adults respectively. The mechanism of injury is often from hyperextension from direct frontal trauma. The onset of symptoms may be immediate or delayed for up to 48 hours after trauma. Absence of pathology in MRI is predictive of good outcomes. External immobilization and avoiding increased-risk activities are the most common treatments.\n\nOutcome: The day after the incident the patient had significant improvement. However, incomplete resolution of the hemiplegia prior to discharge was noted. The right upper extremity strength was 3/5 and right lower extremity strength was 4/5. Symptoms were completely resolved 2 months after the incident.\n\nFollow-Up: Our patient continued to wear an Aspen collar for 2 weeks post-injury. He followed up with neurosurgery and by 2 months had full return of motion and strength and was cleared to begin a gradual return to sports activities.\n\nJust Keep Swimming … Just Keep Swimming\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Jack Italiano, DO, RT(R)\n\nJason Zaremski, MD\n\nAffiliation: Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Florida Health.\n\nHistory: We present a 15-year-old right hand dominant high school swimmer with no significant past medical history, who complains of right elbow pain along the distal biceps' tendon for a 2 months. Pain was insidious in onset, sharp, intermittent, and described as a 0 to 6 out of 10. The patient has been swimming more frequently over the last few months to prepare for competition and noticed progressive pain with swimming. He went on vacation and then was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection and took an additional 2 weeks off due to fatigue. He returned to sport without re-integration and increased his swimming intensity to 1 to 2 hours daily, which worsened his pain. Performing the butterfly and breaststroke provoke symptoms and cessation of activity reduces the pain. Denies pain at rest. He took Advil which did not reduce his pain. Denies acute trauma, prior injuries, or paresthesias.\n\nPhysical Exam: Inspection of right elbow: no swelling or signs of discoloration. Palpation: Tenderness at the distal biceps tendon but can hook the tendon without pain. No shoulder or wrist tenderness. Active Range of Motion: Elbow extension 0 degrees, elbow flexion 130 degrees, supination and pronation normal. Normal shoulder and wrist ROM. Muscle strength: 5/5 grip, wrist extension, and wrist flexion. Pain elicited with resisted elbow flexion at the distal humerus. Maneuvers: pain with distal humerus squeeze. Negative Maudsley and negative Cozen test.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n36. Distal Biceps Tendonitis/Tear\n\n37. Stress Reaction of the Distal Humerus\n\n38. Medial Epicondyle Apophysitis\n\n39. Capitellar Osteochondritis Dissecans\n\n40. Radiocapitellar Plica Syndrome\n\nTest Results: x-ray right elbow: AP and Lateral views indicate no abnormalities to the bones, alignment, or soft tissue structures. MRI right elbow No IVCON: Biceps tendon intact. There is periosteal edema and endosteal aspect marrow edema along the medial aspect of the distal diaphysis and metaphysis of the humerus. Several small foci of increased cortical signal. No fractures, joint effusion, or chondral defects. Findings comparable to Fredrickson grade 4a distal humerus diametaphysis stress injury.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Right Elbow Supracondylar Grade 4a Stress Reaction.\n\nDiscussion: Actives that involve repetitive motion are susceptible to overuse injuries. Cases of upper extremity stress reactions in swimmers have been documented along the inferior angle of the scapula, upper ribs, and olecranon. Stress reactions along the distal humerus in swimmers is not well documented. This pathology has been seen in baseball players, cricket bowlers, and tennis players. In swimming, the butterfly technique requires significant endurance and athletic strength. During a sprint, fast synchronized upper extremity revolutions occurring up to 60 cycles per minute counterforce water surface area friction leading to excessive loading forces even at 50 meter distances.\n\nOutcome: The patient was withheld from upper body work outs and swimming for 6 weeks. Vitamin D and Calcium levels were drawn revealing a normal calcium level (10.2), but a vitamin D level of 28.1. Patient was started on 600 IU of Vitamin D and 1300 mg of Calcium daily. The patient started a return to swim program and returned to full competition at 7 months post presentation.\n\nFollow-Up: At 6 weeks, started an upper extremity low impact non-aquatic physical therapy program. Then a slow progressive return to swimming was initiated at 50% effort for 4 weeks. At 10 weeks, a return to sport plan including 200 m all strokes except butterfly, progressed to 250 m at week 2, 300 m at week 3, and 350 m at week 4. Finally, initiated speed work in 50 to 100 m increments and elbow loading workouts.\n\nHanging in There: A Unique Case of Shoulder Pain in a Young Female Soccer Player\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Jeremy Swisher, MD\n\nZachary Sitton, MD, and Chris Miles, MD\n\nAffiliation: School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nHistory: This was an 8-year-old female soccer player with a past medical history of Holt-Oram Syndrome who presented with left shoulder pain after a fall the previous day. She reported that she was about to go down a slide when she was pushed off the slide and landed directly on her left shoulder. Since this injury, she had complained of a constant, 7/10, non-radiating, sharp pain in her left shoulder and that she had decreased range of motion. Of note, she had a similar mechanism of injury in which she had a fracture of her left medial epicondyle 3 years ago which has fully healed. She denied hitting her head, having a headache, pain in her elbow, wrist, or hand as well as any changes in sensation.\n\nPhysical Exam: Vitals: BP 113/90|Pulse 65|Ht 4'2|Wt 54 lb | SpO2 98% Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at LLSB. Inspection: Left shoulder effusion and deformity present. Absent left thumb and shortened radius/ulna. Palpation: TTP left proximal humerus. No TTP of radius, ulna, SC joint, clavicle, AC joint. ROM: Unable to significantly move left arm with flexion at 10 degrees, abduction to 10 degrees, IR 15 degrees and ER 5 degrees. Strength: exam limited due to pain. Shoulder abduction 1/5, elbow extension 1/5, elbow flexion 1/5, grip strength 5/5. Neurovascular: 2+ radial and ulnar pulses, cap refill < 3s, no deficits in sensation.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n41. Fracture of the proximal humerus\n\n42. Fracture of the distal clavicle\n\n43. Anterior shoulder dislocation\n\n44. AC Joint Sprain\n\n45. Fracture of the Acromion\n\nTest Results: XR Shoulder Left (7/23/22): Acute displaced fracture along proximal humeral physis with anterior displacement of the humeral shaft (Salter-Harris II). XR Shoulder Left (9/2/22): Healing Salter-Harris II fracture of the proximal left humerus.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Salter-Harris II fracture of the proximal humerus in the setting of Holt-Oram Syndrome.\n\nDiscussion: Holt-Oram syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. It is characterized by upper limb malformation (abnormal carpal bone, radius, or thumb), congenital heart malformation (ASD or VSD), and cardiac conduction disease (sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation). Patients need to be monitored with serial EKGs/holter monitors to assess their risk for progression of conduction abnormalities as well as receive echocardiograms every 1 to 5 years depending on the significance of septal defects. The upper limb abnormalities are often bilateral and asymmetrical with the left side being more severely affected. The most specific upper limb finding is abnormalities of the carpal bone.\n\nOutcome: She was managed with a hanging arm cast, which uses its weight and length adjustments to correct the angulation and allow for reduction and healing. At 6 weeks, she had significant periosteal reaction as well as clinically no longer having any TTP of the humerus. Her cast was removed, and she was referred to pediatric cardiology for EKG and echocardiogram as well as to PCP follow-up.\n\nFollow-Up: After 6 weeks of immobilization with the hanging arm cast, she was cleared from an orthopedic standpoint to return to soccer. She will continue to have follow-up yearly with her PCP and cardiologist to assess her risk for progression of cardiac conduction disease with EKG and holter monitor as well as to get her echocardiogram to assess the significance of her VSD.\n\nRib Pain in a Runner\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Stephanie Clark, DO, MS\n\nRonan Cahill, MD\n\nAffiliation: Swedish Sports Medicine Fellowship, Rehabilitation and Performance Medicine, Swedish Medical Group.\n\nHistory: An otherwise healthy 43-year-old male endurance sport athlete presented with 8 months insidious onset left anterior rib pain. Pain was located at approximately ribs 8 to 10 on the left and was initially exacerbated only with running and improved with rest. His pain had progressed to bother him with any up and down movements such as jumping and stairs. He also developed back pain at the same level as the rib pain and it was worse at night. Symptoms were described as achy and stabbing and rated 6 to 7/10 in intensity. An appropriate course of physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation had provided him with minimal relief. He denied associated arm or leg weakness, numbness, tingling, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fevers, chills or recent weight loss.\n\nPhysical Exam: GEN: Fit, healthy appearing male in no distress. RESP: non-labored breathing. CV: Pulses are regular rate and rhythm to palpation of radial pulse. Capillary refill is normal. PSYCH: Alert and oriented, mood is stable, and affect is pleasant. Neuro: Sensation intact to light touch. Physiologic and symmetric reflexes in upper and lower extremities. MSK Inspection: No chest wall asymmetry. No exaggerated kyphosis or scoliosis. Palpation: Non-tender anterior rib cage and spinous processes. ROM: full, pain-free spine flexion, extension, rotation and side bending. Strength: Normal muscle bulk, strength and tone in bilateral upper extremities. Provocative maneuvers: Negative Carnett sign.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n46. Slipping rib\n\n47. Intercostal nerve entrapment\n\n48. Thoracic radiculopathy\n\n49. Spondyloarthritis\n\n50. Malignancy\n\nTest Results: Bedside US: narrowing of the costal space without clear fascia disruption between ribs 8 and 9 which corresponds with his area of pain. x-ray thoracic spine: 14-degree dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis. MRI Thoracic spine w/wo contrast: 2.5 cm enhancing intrathecal extramedullary mass centered dorsal to the spinal cord at T8-T9 with associated cord displacement and compression and relatively high-grade canal stenosis but no cord edema.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Spinal nerve sheath tumor.\n\nDiscussion: Back pain has a wide prevalence range among athletes, with thoracic back pain being less common than lumbar. Also uncommon are spinal tumors (ST) which are categorized by their location. Intradural-extramedullary tumors account for less than half of all ST with the most common being schwannomas and meningiomas. The median time to diagnosis is 12 months and pain is the most common initial symptom. MRI is the preferred imaging modality and surgical resection is often required to prevent neurologic compromise. Though ST are rare, they are an important differential to consider in adults complaining of thoracic back pain that does not resolve with conservative management.\n\nOutcome: Patient was referred to neurosurgery who recommend surgical management. He underwent T8-9 laminectomy for gross total resection and final pathology revealed Schwannoma (WHO grade 1). Two weeks post-op, he was only needing over the counter medications for mild incisional pain, and he had a normal neurological physical exam.\n\nFollow-Up: He was started on a gradual return to activity with 10 to 15 pound weight limit and no bending for 6 weeks post-op followed by a 25 pound weight limit and allowance to bend at the waist post-op weeks 6 to 12. At his last follow-up visit, his rib pain had completely resolved, and he was able the sleep, cough and go up and down stairs without any aggravation of symptoms.\n\nSeeing the Bigger Picture: Anterior Shoulder Pain in a Baseball Pitcher\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Nathaniel Tang, BA Neuroscience\n\nCasey Kohr, DPT, ATC, and Carly Day, MD\n\nAffiliation: Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHistory: A 22-year-old right-handed baseball pitcher presented with 3 weeks of right shoulder pain. He first noticed a pulling sensation in his posterior upper arm after throwing a slider. He worked with an athletic trainer/physical therapist on rehabilitation and noted close to 100% improvement over 2 weeks. Unfortunately, shortly after his pain improved, the right shoulder pain returned located primarily in the axilla and posterior upper arm. Pain was up to 9/10 and worse with follow-through during pitching. He did not recall trauma and denied numbness, tingling, and radicular symptoms. He endorsed occasional neck tightness. The athlete tried diclofenac gel 4 times a day and continued rehabilitation with no improvement. Oral anti-inflammatories were not recommended due to congenital solitary kidney.\n\nPhysical Exam: Physical examination was notable for full cervical range of motion without pain. There was no tenderness in the shoulder other than at the medial proximal humerus. Bilateral shoulder flexion was 150 degrees, external rotation 70 degrees, internal rotation to T8 and abduction to 160 degrees. There was no pain with active range of motion and there was 5/5 strength without pain during resisted shoulder internal and external rotation, elbow flexion, and empty can. He had mild discomfort with resisted adduction. He had a negative Neer's, Hawkin's, Speed's and Yergason's and a positve O'Brien's. Distal pulses and sensation were normal.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n51. Glenoid labrum tear\n\n52. Strain of right latissimus dorsi muscle\n\n53. Strain of right teres major muscle\n\n54. Strain of right triceps muscle\n\n55. Tear of latissimus dorsi tendon\n\nTest Results: x-ray of the right shoulder was normal. An MR Arthrogram of the right shoulder showed no rotator cuff tear, labral tear, or cyst. The shoulder MR arthrogram did not give an adequate explanation for this athlete's pain with pitching. Images were inspected again and only a small portion of the proximal humerus was visible. An MRI of the humerus was ordered and a latissimus dorsi tendon avulsion from the humeral attachment with 3 cm retraction into the axillary fold was present.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Avulsion of latissimus dorsi tendon from humeral attachment.\n\nDiscussion: With more emphasis on speed in today's pitchers, latissimus injuries are more common. Unfortunately, they remain a challenging diagnosis. One reason is non-specific physical examination findings. Our patient's physical exam and right shoulder MR arthrogram were largely unremarkable. Accurate diagnosis of latissimus tendon avulsion was only found with wide-field MRI of the right humerus because the shoulder MRI did not include the latissimus attachment to the humerus. It is therefore vital to consider imaging that reveals an upper arm injury as opposed to narrow imaging techniques revealing only shoulder pathology when suspicion of latissimus dorsi tendon injury is present.\n\nOutcome: The athlete underwent surgical repair of the latissimus tendon avulsion. Operation was successful and the patient worked with his athletic trainer/physical therapist on post-operative rehabilitation.\n\nFollow-Up: After 4.5 months of rehabilitation, the athlete had full range of motion and strength without pain. However, at 5.5 months follow up, the patient had developed biceps tendonitis in his shoulder and received a biceps tendon sheath injection. After the injection, he was able to progress and return to full activity as a college pitcher 3 months later.\n\nShot to the Heart, But What's to Blame? A Case of Sudden Cardiac Arrest in a D1 Softball Player\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Zainab Shirazi, MD\n\nNicholas Tsitsilianos, MD, and Elan Goldwaser, MD\n\nAffiliation: Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Columbia-Cornell.\n\nHistory: A 21-year-old female division 1 softball player with no significant history presents to the athletic training room for evaluation 4 days after cardiac event. She was playing in a softball game when she was struck in the chest by an opponent's glove, knocking her down at first base. She began to run back to the dugout but suddenly collapsed followed by whole-body shaking and loss of bladder control. She was not breathing and had no pulse, so CPR was started immediately. One shock was delivered with ROSC achieved after 2 minutes. Initial rhythm on AED is unknown. She was transported to ED for further evaluation. She was ultimately discharged home. On presentation to the athletic training room, she brings all ED paperwork. She reports feeling well and denies cardiac symptoms at this time. Denies previous syncope. She has no family history of sudden cardiac death.\n\nPhysical Exam: Physical exam on presentation was unremarkable. Vital signs were normal. She was alert and oriented x3 and well-appearing. Breathing was non-labored, without audible wheeze or cough. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or clicks. Chest wall movement and rib motion appeared normal. Extremities were well perfused with pulses equal and adequate bilaterally. There was no peripheral edema. She was neurologically intact without focal deficits.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n56. Commotio Cordis\n\n57. Myocardial Contusion (Contusion Cordis)\n\n58. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n\n59. Congenital Cardiac Anomaly\n\n60. Seizure-induced Cardiac Arrest\n\nTest Results: In ED: Trop normal, CXR without cardiomegaly. EKG with NSR, LVH, and normal QTc. Bedside Echo showed normal EF, no systolic anterior motion of mitral valve. She was referred for additional cardiac workup: TTE without structural abnormalities, cardiac MRI with mildly dilated LV and borderline EF consistent with athletic heart. Loop recorder placed for prolonged monitoring, but no arrhythmia detected. Coronary CTA (CCTA) revealed anomalous left coronary artery from main pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Sudden cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia in the setting of ALCAPA (anomalous left coronary artery from main pulmonary artery).\n\nDiscussion: The leading cause of death in young athletes is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Congenital coronary artery anomaly, such as ALCAPA, is the second most common etiology (17%). Initial diagnosis was commotio cordis given the blunt chest trauma and nonspecific cardiac workup. ALCAPA was found on subsequent CCTA, which is not currently required for return to play. Had her condition gone undiagnosed, she would have returned to sport without intervention, increasing the risk of another life-threatening cardiac event. A comprehensive cardiac workup is essential in athletes with SCA. Multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial for prompt diagnosis and management.\n\nOutcome: The definitive treatment for ALCAPA is surgical intervention. After extensive discussion between the patient, her parents, and the medical team, the decision was made to pursue surgery to minimize risk of recurrent cardiac event. She successfully underwent surgical re-implantation of the left main coronary artery. There were no complications and she was discharged home with coordinated follow up.\n\nFollow-Up: Postoperative stress echo showed improved EF and exercise capacity without evidence of ischemia or arrhythmias. Repeat CCTA was normal. She participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Three months after surgery, she gradually returned to activity in accordance with the AHA/ACC recommendations. At 6-month follow up, she remained asymptomatic and had resumed strength training and running.\n\nHut, Hut, High Heart Rate in an Incoming Football Hiker\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Kathleen Kinderwater, MD\n\nJoseph Armen, DO\n\nAffiliation: East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nHistory: Eighteen YO male incoming freshman football long snapper with a history of childhood asthma and one prior uncomplicated concussion presented for his initial, routine, pre-participation exam. He denied any current concerns. He was not taking any medications, had no allergies, endorsed a family history of type 2 diabetes in his father, and denied caffeine, tobacco, drug, or stimulant use. Complete review of symptoms was negative except for an “intentional” weight loss for sport of greater than 20 pounds over the past several months. Standard of care for the university's pre-participation evaluation includes a hemoglobinopathy screen and EKG. His hemoglobinopathy screen was unremarkable and his EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia without other abnormalities. Clearance was deferred given his sinus tachycardia.\n\nPhysical Exam: Vital signs: BP 105/72, HR 104, RR 13, Temp 97.3°F, Weight 195.5 lbs, Height 74 in. Gen: NAD. HEENT: normal appearance, PERRLA, oropharynx without erythema or exudate. Neck: non-tender, no enlarged thyroid, without palpable adenopathy. Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular rhythm. normal S1, S2, no murmurs or rubs. Negative Marfan's screening. Pulm: CTAB. Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, no rebound or guarding, no palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly. Derm: no rashes. Neuro: no focal deficits. Lymph: no cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal adenopathy. MSK: normal tone and strength in the extremities. Mental: oriented to time, place, person, normal affect and mood.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n61. Anemia\n\n62. Hyperthyroidism\n\n63. Stimulant Use\n\n64. Infection\n\n65. Malignancy\n\nTest Results: His tachycardia persisted. CBC demonstrated a microcytic anemia. Hepatic panel noted low protein and albumin and elevated alkaline phosphate. BMP and TSH were normal. Iron studies had an anemia pattern of inflammation/chronic disease. Ferritin significantly elevated to 1400. He was referred to GI given concern for inflammatory process with additional 7 lbs lost. CT abdomen showed splenomegaly with intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and hepatic lesions concerning for lymphoma.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Hematology/Oncology admitted him to the hospital. Labs remained stable. CT of chest and neck demonstrated bulky thoracic lymphadenopathy. Supraclavicular lymph node biopsy confirmed Hodgkin Lymphoma.\n\nDiscussion: The importance of vital signs cannot be underestimated. Resting tachycardia with weight changes are concerning for abnormal pathology. While the most common risk factor for cancer is older age, lymphoma is one of many malignancies that is common in younger patients. Athletes diagnosed with cancer and treated with chemotherapy are unique when considering complications and activity capability post-treatment. Aside from acute complications of anemia, infection, and bleeding, chronic complications can pose lifelong difficulties. Specifically with typical lymphoma treatment, cardiovascular complications, pulmonary fibrosis, and peripheral neuropathy are all common adverse effects.\n\nOutcome: The patient returned home for treatment. A PET scan and bone marrow biopsy done prior to chemotherapy showed extensive hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm with marrow involvement. He was enrolled in a clinical trial that he qualified for based on age and advanced stage 4 disease. He has completed several rounds of chemotherapy and has been referred to radiation oncology.\n\nFollow-Up: Return to play must consider the athlete's physical and emotional status and be a collaborative decision among coaches, care team, and patient. CBC, BMP, heart rate and fatigue level are monitored routinely. His repeat PET scan showed resolution of liver lesions with improvement in both splenomegaly and size of largest paratracheal node. He has not yet resumed activity given ongoing treatment.\n\nBlock at the Notch: Shoulder Pain in Volleyball Athlete\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Bishop Carmichael, DO\n\nKimberly Kaiser, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nHistory: Twenty-one-year-old female right hand dominant division 1 volleyball player who presented to training room for right shoulder pain. She stated her right shoulder had started to ache over the past few days with weightlifting. She subsequently woke up with severe right shoulder pain and weakness and presented to training room for evaluation. She described the pain as deep and aching, localized posteriorly and laterally. She denied any specific trauma, fall, or injury. No previous injury or surgery to the right shoulder. No recent illness. No other joint or muscle pains.\n\nPhysical Exam: Right Shoulder: No erythema or ecchymosis. Obvious asymmetry of posterior aspect of right shoulder compared to left with decreased scapular muscle volume. ROM Flexion 160, Abduction 160, External rotation 60. Strength is 5/5 with flexion, abduction, 4/5 with external rotation. Pain with empty can and O'Brien's testing. Negative Spurling's.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n66. Rotator Cuff Tendinitis\n\n67. Labral Tear\n\n68. Shoulder Impingement\n\n69. Rotator Cuff Tear\n\n70. Cervical Disc Disease\n\nTest Results: MRI Right shoulder w/o contrast demonstrated severe chronic atrophy and fatty infiltration of infraspinatus.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Infraspinatus Atrophy due to suprascapular nerve impingement at spinoglenoid notch.\n\nDiscussion: Atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle is not uncommonly seen in overhead athletes. Infraspinatus is innervated by the suprascapular nerve which exits the spinoglenoid notch to innervate the muscle. It is at this level entrapment or irritation can be seen. Many mechanisms can cause this such a paralabral cysts, bony compression, or repeated eccentric loading of the area. Specifically in volleyball athletes, rapid deceleration of the overhead movement significantly loads the posterior rotator cuff musculature, which can lead to suprascapular nerve palsy at the level of the spinoglenoid notch, resulting in isolated infraspinatus atrophy.\n\nOutcome: Athlete was mid-season at the time of diagnosis. Given that she had no structural compression on MRI, she was started on methylprednisolone dose pack and began an aggressive physical therapy and rehab program to allow her to continue participating.\n\nFollow-Up: Her rehab focused on strengthening of the periscapular musculature and rotator cuff with several modalities aimed directly at infraspinatus recovery with Russian stim and blood flow restriction being the most effective. After identifying the problem and beginning rehab, the athlete was able to continue in season with minimal time lost due to shoulder pain.\n\nAcute Weakness at the Beach\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Alex Bonilla, MD\n\nBrendan Bechard, MD, Mirhojjat Khorasanizadeh, MD, Philip Maynard, MD, Masrai, Williams, MD, Gilbert Dagher, and Benedikt Ilyaguyev, MD\n\nAffiliation: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, New York.\n\nHistory: A 26-year-old female with no past medical history presented to the ED, transferred from another hospital in the system for urgent imaging and neurosurgical evaluation. Earlier that day, she had been surfing when she began to experience fatigue in her lower extremities and a band-like sensation of pain around her pelvis. She returned to shore where, after resting, the pain became numbness and tingling and she was unable to stand, about 1 hour after surfing. At the initial ED presentation, she reported inability to move her lower extremities or urinate and a foley catheter was placed with 1.5 L urine output. She denied headaches, vision changes, trauma, tick bites, abdominal pain, lower back pain, fevers, IV drug use, and recent infections.\n\nPhysical Exam: Vitals: Temp 36.7°C BP 112/61 Pulse 64. MSK: No midline cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinous process tenderness, deformities or step offs. Neurological: Intact mental status, CN II-XII intact. Motor: UE: strength 5/5 throughout B/L with normal bulk and tone, LE: strength: 0 to 1/5 Hip flexion B/L, otherwise 0/5 throughout B/L with normal bulk and flaccid tone. Sensory: UE: intact and symmetric to all modalities, LE: light touch decreased to 30% of her normal in B/L LE, pinprick decreased B/L to T10/T11 level, temperature decreased in LE B/L, vibration intact B/L, proprioception (joint position sense) intact B/L. Reflexes: 2+ in B/L UE, 0 in B/L LE (Patellar, Achilles).\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n71. Spinal Cord Compression\n\n72. Transverse Myelitis\n\n73. Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n\n74. Spinal Cord Infarct\n\n75. Mass Lesion\n\nTest Results: CTs of the spine were negative for fractures. Spinal MRIs revealed no extrinsic compression, but were notable for intramedullary T2 hyperintensity from T8/9 to conus, central and expansile, with central gray matter involvement and enhancement at T10 and T11. MRI Brain and c-spine were unremarkable. MRA Spine did not show AVMs. CSF studies revealed WBC 46, RBC 10, glucose 65, protein 44.6. Diagnostic Spinal Angiogram was normal with artery of Adamkiewicz visualized.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Anterior Spinal Cord Infarct - Surfer's Myelopathy.\n\nDiscussion: Surfer's myelopathy is a rare, nontraumatic spinal cord injury that has been documented primarily in novice surfers. The literature suggests that the mechanism may be from prolonged hyperextension of the back while in a prone position resulting in insufficient arterial supply to the lower spinal cord. Patients may present with back pain, bladder or bowel dysfunction, paraplegia and sensory deficits. Surfers, especially novices, should be counseled on proper technique and adequate hydration as a preventive measure. With early recognition and appropriate treatment, patients may achieve complete or near-complete recovery.\n\nOutcome: The patient was admitted to the Neurology Stroke service, loaded with aspirin and monitored for hypotension, requiring only IV fluids. A lumbar drain was placed briefly to decrease CSF pressure for management of spinal cord infarct. After maximizing medical management of the spinal infarct, the patient was discharged to the acute inpatient rehabilitation for spinal cord rehabilitation.\n\nFollow-Up: The patient regained significant motor function recovery with 5/5 hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion and 4/5 extensor hallucis longus. She remained with pain, bowel and bladder dysfunction, decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the BLE and impaired mobility. She will continue outpatient rehabilitation to maximize recovery.\n\nCompressed for Time\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Jacob Holtz, DO\n\nJordan Geroski, DO\n\nAffiliation: South Bend Notre Dame Sports Medicine Fellowship, South Bend, Indiana.\n\nHistory: Seventeen-year-old female high school soccer player presented acutely to the office for lower leg pain with numbness of the dorsum of the right foot. She played a soccer game the day before and had to come out of the game due to excruciating right lower leg pain after running. She could not recall any injury nor history of an event this painful or lasting this long, she did, however, endorse a several year history of similar, less severe tingling, numbness, and pain in both lower extremities with exertion, right worse than left. Previously, the pain followed a predictable interval, became severe enough to cause her to stop activity, but had always quickly resolved with rest. She never sought evaluation for this problem prior to this acute event.\n\nPhysical Exam: Afebrile with normal blood pressure and pulse. Antalgic gait but without assistive devices. Visibly and palpably taut appearing skin overlying the anterior and lateral right lower leg. Tenderness to palpation of the anterior and lateral right lower leg. No tenderness of the posterior leg. Cold right foot compared to left. Altered sensation of the dorsum of the right foot. Diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. Full range of motion, but significant pain with active dorsiflexion. No visible color changes.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n76. Deep venous thombosis\n\n77. Tibia fracture\n\n78. Acute compartment syndrome\n\n79. Cystic adventitial disease\n\n80. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome\n\nTest Results: Resting compartment pressure testing performed in the office. Anterior compartment measured 85 mm Hg. Lateral compartment measured 68 mm Hg. Deep posterior compartment measured 15 mm Hg.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Acute on chronic atraumatic exertional compartment syndrome.\n\nDiscussion: Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a relatively rare phenomenon with an incidence of 0.5/1000 person years in active populations. The incidence of conversion to acute compartment syndrome without an associated trauma has not been well defined in the literature, if at all. This case represents an exceptionally rare phenomenon of a patient with chronic exertional compartment syndrome converting to acute compartment syndrome requiring emergent surgical correction to protect the limb. Prompt evaluation of acute compartment syndrome remains paramount. This case also serves as a reminder to be observant for symptoms of chronic exertional compartment syndrome.\n\nOutcome: Patient underwent 4 compartment release emergently within a few hours of diagnosis. She has recovered well with no complications and is planning to return to soccer in the spring.\n\nFollow-Up: The patient's wounds healed well after surgery. There were no post-surgical complications. She transitioned back to running at 4 weeks postoperatively. She is back to soccer drills and is cleared to participate fully in soccer. She has maintained close follow-up with the performing surgeon. She has planned follow-up for evaluation of chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the left leg.\n\nWhen Catching Air Leads to a Major Scare—An Unfortunate Trampoline Injury\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Pooja Sharma, MD\n\nLogan Pierce, PA-C and Joseph Powers, MD, FAAP, CAQSM\n\nAffiliation: Northside Hospital, Orthopedic Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHistory: Twenty-seven year old Female presents to clinic for evaluation of right knee pain after an injury sustained at a trampoline park. She injured her knee while jumping on a trampoline and landed awkwardly. She reported feeling a pop and numbness. She was initially evaluated at an outside ER shortly after the injury and diagnosed with tibial plateau and fibular styloid fracture and discharged home to follow up with Orthopedics. Patient was noted to be neurovascularly intact in the ER and discharged in a knee immobilizer. She presents to our clinic approximately 24 hours after the injury, and reports excruciating pain diffusely throughout the leg, rated 10/10. She continues to report numbness in the lower leg.\n\nPhysical Exam: Gen: Alert, in discomfort. MSK—(R lower extremity): Inspection: Bruising and hemorrhagic fluid filled blisters on postero-lateral knee; significant swelling of R lower extremity. Palpation: Tenderness diffusely throughout R lower leg. No palpable pulse at dorsalis pedis. Weak pulse appreciated at posterior tibialis with Doppler. No doppler signal in the right dorsalis pedis artery. R foot is warm; capillary refill <3 seconds. ROM: Unable to assess due to pain and swelling. Holds at 10 degrees of flexion. Strength: No active plantar or dorsiflexion of R foot; Unable to move toes. Neurovascular: Loss of sensation in the R superficial peroneal nerve distribution. Special: Unable to assess.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n81. Compartment syndrome\n\n82. Popliteal artery transection\n\n83. Patellar dislocation\n\n84. Multiligamentous knee injury\n\n85. Tibiofemoral fracture\n\nTest Results: R Knee XR: Comminuted fracture of medial tibial plateau. Fibular styloid avulsion fracture. Displaced flabella. R ABI: Unable to calculate ABI. Monophasic waveform in distal posterior tibial artery. Intracompartmental Pressure (mm Hg): Ant: 50; Lat: 66; Diastolic: 71. R Knee MRI: Comminuted fracture of anterior tibial plateau. Fibular head displaced avulsion fracture. ACL partially torn. Complete tear of PCL. Displaced fracture of medial femoral condyle. RLE CT Angio: Popliteal artery occluded.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Right lower extremity compartment syndrome secondary to patellar dislocation, popliteal artery occlusion, tibial plateau knee fracture and severe multiligamentous knee injury.\n\nDiscussion: Trampolining has become an exciting hobby and sport for children and adults alike. While it is gaining popularity, it also poses a significant injury risk. Many trampoline injuries occur in the spine, upper and lower extremities. Recognizing vascular injuries quickly is imperative as it can lead to compartment syndrome, ultimately contributing to increased morbidity, including amputation. Awareness about the long-term impact and seriousness of these injuries will help adults make informed decisions about participating in this activity. Further studies are needed to investigate local and national injury burden, injury prevention, and safety of trampoline parks (Arora, 2016).\n\nOutcome: She was not a candidate for revascularization and would be better served with an amputation. She underwent an ORIF of the medial tibial plateau and fibular head with debridement of fasciotomy wounds. ACL and PCL were not reconstructed. Vascular surgery deemed complete loss of sensory and motor function and new areas of necrosis. She underwent a right lower extremity below knee amputation.\n\nFollow-Up: She experienced phantom limb following surgery. Limb protector remained in place for maneuvering, transitioning and working with physical therapy. Ultimately, she was discharged to a subacute rehab facility.\n\nCough it Out Palpitations in a College Lacrosse Student-Athlete\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Emma Cronk, MD\n\nAdriana Isacke, DO\n\nAffiliation: Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine.\n\nHistory: Twenty-one year old male college lacrosse player with a long history of palpitations that occur with high intensity exercise. Heart rate noted of 180 bpm during most recent college preparticipation physical. Sensation of sudden heart racing with palpitations, 1 to 2 episodes yearly that last for 30 seconds and are always terminated by coughing or bearing down. Syncopal episode at age 6 was thought to be due to orthostatic hypotension. Underwent cardiology evaluation at 14 years old for presyncope followed by tachycardia/palpitations, negative EKG, ECHO, and Holter monitor, thought to be compensatory sinus tachycardia after postural light-headedness. Denies any other syncope event other than at age 6. Family history notable for father with hypertension. No unexplained deaths in the family. Grandfather died of myocardial infarction at age 82. Takes no medications, no known allergies.\n\nPhysical Exam: HR: 49 BP: 118/70 HT: 5'8\" WT: 173 lbs BMI: 26.3 Constitutional: well appearing male in no apparent distress, alert, attentive, and pleasant. Neck: no JVD, supple, symmetrical Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2 noted, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Pulmonary: clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement, no wheezes/rales/rhonchi Extremities: No lower extremity edema.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n86. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)\n\n87. Sinus Tachycardia\n\n88. Atrial Flutter\n\n89. Atrial fibrillation\n\n90. Atrioventricular Block (AV block)\n\nTest Results: EKG: sinus arrhythmia, ST elevation probable normal early repol pattern, right axis deviation. Holter Monitor: 3 episodes of high degree AV block, longest pause lasting 3.1 seconds during sleep. 1 episode of tachycardia with rate of 203 bpm. Second Degree AV Block-Mobitz I (Wenckebach) was present. Echo: LVEF 56%. No significant valve abnormalities. Normal right and left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. Treadmill Stress Test: negative in capturing an episode of SVT on EKG.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia, Second Degree AV Block-Mobitz I (Wenckebach).\n\nDiscussion: Associated with physical activity, there is an increase in resting parasympathetic tone (vagotonia) and a withdrawal of sympathetic activation, resulting in alterations of pacemaker function and conduction. First AV block and second AV block (Mobitz I—Wenckebach) occur in up to 33 and 10 percent of athletes, respectively, as opposed to 0.65 and 0.003 percent of non-athletes. Common alterations to an athletic heart that is associated with vagotonia include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, junctional escape beats, first degree atrioventricular block and second degree (Mobitz type I) atrioventricular block. Mobitz type 1 is often a benign rhythm and does not require treatment.\n\nOutcome: Cardiology/Electrophysiology referral. Second Degree AV block-Mobitz I (Wenckebach)- Physiologic in athletes. Echo normal. No further workup. Palpitations-Treadmill stress test negative in capturing an episode of SVT on EKG. Counseled if has sustained palpitations >20 to 30 minutes to seek medical attention. Recommend he obtain the Kardia mobile device or apple watch to record palpitations.\n\nFollow-Up: Per cardiology recommendations, no athletic restriction. If palpitations occurring more than 1 to 2 times per year, recommended to follow up with Cardiology. Upon follow up with student-athlete, no recent sustained palpitations or palpitation events.\n\nHip, Hip, Hooray: A Case of Adolescent Hip Pain\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Frances Tao, MD, MPH\n\nEmily Miller, MD\n\nAffiliation: UCLA Family Medicine Residency Program, Santa Monica, California.\n\nHistory: A 13-year-old previously healthy male presented with right hip pain and fever. While sitting in class 6 days prior to presentation, he felt a sudden throbbing ache in his right anterolateral hip, which worsened upon standing and walking. There was no radiation of pain or paresthesia. He denied hip trauma, however recently sustained a superficial abrasion to his right knee while playing basketball. Despite Tylenol and Motrin around the clock for pain and concurrent daily fevers to Tmax 101°F, his symptoms progressively worsened and caused inability to ambulate. He denied URI symptoms, abdominal pain, N/V/D, dysuria, or urethral discharge. He is up-to-date on vaccinations. There is no family history of joint disease, autoimmune arthritis, or malignancy. He has never been sexually active and denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\n\nPhysical Exam: VS: T 101°F, HR 84, BP 116/68, RR 22, O2 97% on room air. Exam: Gen: NAD, well-developed well-nourished teenage male. CV: RRR, no murmurs. Resp: CTAB, no wheezes or rales. MSK: Normal muscle bulk and alignment of RLE. No rashes, erythema or swelling over the right hip. Significant pain on passive hip flexion beyond 90 degrees, unable to flex beyond 90 degrees. Significant pain with log roll, internal and external rotation of the hip, and axial loading. Painless full ROM of right knee, ankle and toes. Healing scab noted over right patella, no active bleeding or drainage. 2+ distal pulses. Sensation intact over all dermatomes. Compartments soft and compressible.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n91. Septic arthritis\n\n92. Transient synovitis\n\n93. Osteomyelitis\n\n94. Pelvic or intramuscular abscess\n\n95. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease\n\nTest Results: WBC 5.85 (neutrophils 70.6%, lymphocytes 13.0%, monocytes 15.0%, eosinophils 0.2%, basophils 0.3%, immature granulocytes 0.9%). ESR > 40, CRP > 10. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. x-ray right hip and pelvis: well-preserved hip without acute fracture. Ultrasound: no joint effusion. MRI right hip and pelvis w/o contrast: asymmetric right hip joint fluid. MRI right femur w/ contrast: increased small right hip joint effusion; No evidence of myositis, osteomyelitis, or osseous lesions.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Septic arthritis of the right hip.\n\nDiscussion: Pediatric septic hip is an orthopedic emergency. The joint is often infected through a hematogenous route by Staphylococcus aureus. Patients may present with acute onset hip pain, limping or non-weight bearing. Although more commonly in males under 2 years old, septic hip should still be considered in older children especially in the setting of fever and limping. Maintain a high index of suspicion and a low threshold to repeat work up if the clinical picture is not improving. Use the modified Kocher criteria, imaging, and analyses of aspirated fluid to confirm the diagnosis. Treat within 4 days of symptom onset for a good prognosis. If treatment is delayed, grave outcomes can occur.\n\nOutcome: He underwent fluoroscopic right hip arthrocentesis. Fluid analysis showed WBC 58 480, PMN 89%, and Gram-positive cocci. This prompted emergent right hip arthrotomy with irrigation and debridement. Postoperatively, he was weight bearing as tolerated with early mobilization through physical therapy. IV Vancomycin and Cefepime were de-escalated to IV Oxacillin once blood & fluid cultures grew MSSA.\n\nFollow-Up: The patient followed with Pediatric Infectious Disease and Orthopedic Surgery at 2 weeks post discharge. Repeat x-rays were unremarkable. He continued IV antibiotics for 2 weeks, followed by 5 weeks of oral antibiotics. Inflammatory markers down-trended. One year later, the patient is reported to be doing well. He is now a high school freshman playing tackle football without any limitations.\n\nForearm Pain and Paresthesia in a Collegiate Baseball Pitcher\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Shane Davis, MD\n\nJustin Gellman, BS\n\nAffiliation: Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHistory: A 22-year-old male collegiate baseball player presented with 1 day of right distal biceps pain which occurred immediately after throwing a pitch. The pain was mild at rest and worsened with activation of his biceps or attempted throwing. He denied swelling, bruising, deformity or weakness; however, he had developed progressive numbness over the lateral aspect of his forearm. He had a history of Tommy John surgery on the same arm and never fully regained full elbow extension. He otherwise had no prior relevant injuries.\n\nPhysical Exam: Examination of the right upper extremity was notable for tenderness at the myotendinous junction of the distal lateral biceps and decreased sensation to light touch over the lateral forearm. There was mild pain with resisted elbow flexion with the arm in pronated and supinated positions. Otherwise, there was no pain with resisted pronation or supination at the elbow, wrist flexion or extension, or rotator cuff testing. There was no swelling, ecchymosis or deformity. The distal biceps tendon was intact. He lacked about 5 degrees of right elbow extension which he stated was his baseline. Strength testing was normal. Cervical spine exam did not reproduce symptoms.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n96. Lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) injury\n\n97. Musculocutaneous nerve injury\n\n98. Brachial plexopathy\n\n99. Distal biceps tendon injury\n\n100. Cervical radiculopathy\n\nTest Results: In-office ultrasound of the anterior elbow was normal. Elbow MRI showed post-surgical ulnar collateral ligament changes and low-grade tearing of the common flexor tendon but was otherwise unremarkable. Electrodiagnostics performed 16 days post injury revealed reduced amplitude and preserved latency of the LACN but was otherwise normal in evaluation of the C5-6 nerve roots, lateral cord of the brachial plexus and musculocutaneous nerve.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: LACN injury with axonal features.\n\nDiscussion: The LACN is the purely sensory, distal segment of the musculocutaneous nerve. Compression can occur proximally at the coracobrachialis or distally at the bicipital tendon aponeurosis. Pitching has been linked to proximal musculocutaneous nerve injuries due to excessive neural tension in the late cocking phase. These injuries present with anterolateral forearm numbness and biceps weakness, usually sidelining pitches for 6 to 12 months. Acute, throwing-related injury isolated to the LACN has not previously been described. This injury presents with purely sensory deficits and likely carries a better prognosis.\n\nOutcome: The athlete was treated with rest, oral steroids/NSAIDs and gradual return to throwing. Once pain was controlled, he successfully returned to unrestricted activity despite persistence of lateral forearm numbness. Prior reports of musculocutaneous nerve injury with motor involvement had prolonged recoveries; however, this athlete's isolated sensory deficits likely explain his early return to play.\n\nFollow-Up: Three weeks post injury his pain had largely resolved. He made gradual return to throwing 3-to-4 weeks post injury and resumed competitive play 32 days after injury. Repeat electrodiagnostic studies at 3 months post injury showed improved LACN. While his numbness persisted, it was improving. We expect full resolution of his symptoms over time.\n\nAn Adolescent Soccer Player With a Limp for One Year\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Connor Mitrovich, DO\n\nSuzanne Hecht, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nHistory: A 12 yo male, soccer player presented with one year of bilateral thigh pain and limp. It began as non-traumatic, intermittent, cramp-like pain while standing and was unrelated to exertion. Ice and analgesics did not improve the pain. Over the next 2 months the pain worsened in his right thigh, which caused him to limp and miss soccer and physical education. He had no fevers, easy bruising or bleeding, or weight loss. After 3 evaluations by primary care, which included unremarkable femur and pelvic x-rays, CMP, and CBC, he was then referred to orthopedic sports medicine. Additional history revealed recent night sweats and an extensive paternal and maternal family history of cancer. He performed well in sixth grade classes with no reports of being bullied.\n\nPhysical Exam: He had an antalgic gait. His bilateral lower extremity exam revealed no joint swelling, erythema, or ecchymosis. He was unable to actively flex or extend at the waist due to pain. He had no tenderness to palpation of the hamstring belly, iliotibial band, or tensor fascia lata. No masses were palpated. Log rolling did not elicit pain. FABER testing and knee extension produced pain at the posterior hamstring, however, full knee extension was also limited due to tightness and pain.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n101. Neoplasm\n\n102. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis\n\n103. Bone stress injury\n\n104. Complex regional pain syndrome\n\n105. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis\n\nTest Results: MRI femur and thigh revealed abnormal T2 signal bilaterally within the femoral heads and necks, ischial tuberosities, and inferior pubic rami. There was no cortical disruption, intramuscular or subcutaneous abnormality, mass, or fluid collection. Labs revealed CRP: 23.7, ESR: 37, Calcium: 10.1, Vitamin D 25-OH: 25, Alkaline Phosphatase: 229. A bone marrow biopsy was performed with no neoplastic or inflammatory cells and negative infectious cultures including AFB, bacteria, and fungus.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Bone marrow edema syndrome.\n\nDiscussion: Bone marrow edema syndrome is most often seen in middle-aged men presenting with hip pain. It is rarely seen in children, as only a small case series exists of this syndrome occurring in the feet and ankles of adolescents and has not been described in the pediatric hip. It is always a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore secondary causes such as trauma, infectious, ischemic, neoplastic, and iatrogenic must first be ruled out. This often contributes to a prolonged time to diagnosis, leading to high morbidity, as physical activity is significantly limited due to pain. Management is further complicated as no guidelines exist for the treatment of children.\n\nOutcome: After an extensive, year-long evaluation that included multiple rounds of laboratory tests, images, and consultations with oncology and an orthopedic bone tumor specialist, 2 months after his MRI, this patient reported less lower extremity pain and improved gait. Expected time to full recovery can take 9 to 24 months.\n\nFollow-Up: A DXA scan revealed normal bone density for age. He began a rehabilitation program to regain his strength and mobility to return to soccer.\n\nAbstract Title: Can’t Stand To Handstand\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Michael McCoy, MD\n\nBrian Coleman, MD and George Ghata, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of Oklahoma Primary Care Sports Medicine Fellowship.\n\nHistory: Twenty-year-old LHD F stunt performer presents with approximately 4 year history of intermittent left forearm weakness and change in sensation. She first noticed symptoms during her junior year of high school which were manifested by tingling, forearm pain and weakness in her forearm after exertion during exercises or stunt performance activities. After resting for 5 to 10 minutes symptoms would subside and she would return to being asymptomatic afterwards. No inciting event. Patient experiences symptoms on the ulnar aspect of the left forearm. Patient experiences decreased strength in forearm and grip as well as tingling and pain in forearm.\n\nPhysical Exam: No visual abnormalities of elbow and forearm. No erythema, swelling, or calor. Nontender to palpation at olecranon, medial epicondyle, cubital tunnel, and sublime tubercle. No altered sensation to light touch in forearm and hand. Full, symmetric range of motion with flexion-extension of elbow and wrist along with pronation-supination and radial-ulnar deviation. Strength symmetric and full in intrinsic muscles of hand, resisted wrist flexion-extension, resisted pronation-supination. Negative moving valgus stress test or Tinnel sign.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n106. Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome\n\n107. Pronator Teres Syndrome\n\n108. Cubital Tunnel Syndrome\n\n109. Stress Fracture\n\n110. Posterior Interosseous Nerve Compression Syndrome\n\nTest Results: x-ray- Negative. MRI- Negative. Compartment Testing: Volar Compartment: 1 minute- 15 mm Hg, 5 minute- 15 mm Hg. Mobile Wad Component: 1 minute- 18 mm Hg, 5 minute- 16 mm Hg. Dorsal Compartment: 1 minute- 30 mm Hg, 5 minute- 22 mm Hg.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome.\n\nDiscussion: Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a common cause of lower extremity pain but is a much more rare diagnosis in the upper extremities. It is most often seen in athletic populations including climbers, rowers, and motorcyclists. Typically bilateral in presentation 70% to 100% of the time. Some research indicates that compartments are interconnected based on surgical evidence. Diagnosis can be made clinically but manometry also used with general consensus of any pressure ≥30 mm Hg supporting the diagnosis. Conservative treatment includes activity modification or cessation. Definitive treatment includes fasciotomy that can be open, mini-open, or endoscopic. Revision is sometimes required.\n\nOutcome: After results of compartment testing obtained, then patient was referred to orthopedic surgeon for consultation on fasciotomy. R/B/A of fasciotomy discussed with patient. Patient and family decided to proceed with fasciotomy.\n\nFollow-Up: Patient continued to participate in stunt activities without further worsening of symptoms and was allowed to stop activity when symptoms became too bothersome. She was shutdown for several weeks after her procedure and then returned to activity under the guidance of her athletic trainers and surgeon.\n\nAn Unusual Case of Shoulder Pain in an Adolescent Athlete\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Meghan Caballero, MD\n\nKimberly Hornbeck, MD\n\nAffiliation: Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nHistory: E.P. is a 15-year-old male baseball pitcher and football quarterback with 1 year history of bilateral scapular winging who presented to the sports medicine clinic for consultation of a 6-week history of right shoulder pain. Pain was located over the periscapular region and described as a “pulled muscle.” Pain was worse with throwing and improved with relative rest. He noted a decreased range of motion (ROM) associated with his scapular winging which had caused him to change his throwing mechanics. He denied neurological symptoms in his upper extremities. He had been actively participating in physical therapy (PT) for his scapular winging for 6 to 7 months which improved his winging slightly, per dad, but provided no relief of his shoulder pain over the weeks during which they were working on it. E.P. had been very compliant with his home exercise program.\n\nPhysical Exam: Inspection revealed bilateral scapular winging, loss of cervical lordosis, underdeveloped trunk muscles, and overdeveloped trapezius muscles. Palpation was nontender over the clavicle, acromioclavicular joint, deltoid, upper trapezius, supraspinatus, periscapular region, cervical or thoracic paraspinal musculature or midline. He had no sensory deficit. He had limited ROM with thoracic flexion and shoulder abduction and required arm swinging to get momentum for shoulder flexion greater than 90 degrees. Shoulder internal and external rotator strength was 5/5 but that of periscapular muscles was 2−/5. Special tests for rotator cuff injury and intra-articular shoulder pathology were negative.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n111. Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)\n\n112. Other neuromuscular etiology/muscular dystrophy\n\n113. Peripheral nerve injury/compression/neuritis\n\n114. Radiculopathy\n\n115. Spinal cord injury\n\nTest Results: In-clinic cervical and thoracic spine x-rays were unremarkable. An MRI of the chest was ordered and was also normal. E.P. was then referred to a neuromuscular specialist. Labs were ordered and notable for elevated creatine kinase, protein, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Based on these results, clinical presentation, and E.P.'s physical features, genetic testing was pursued and positive for a 4q35 deletion, consistent with FSHD type 1.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) type 1.\n\nDiscussion: FSHD results from a pathogenic contraction of the D4Z4 gene, leading to expression of the toxic DUX4 gene. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, although approximately half of cases occur in individuals without family history of neuromuscular disease. FSHD is characterized by slowly progressive weakness in the facial, scapular, upper arm, and lower leg muscles. Life expectancy is normal, although other organ systems can be affected. Therefore, annual ophthalmologic exam and baseline cardiac, pulmonary, and audiologic exams are recommended. Patients can benefit from consistent follow up with a multidisciplinary care team for coordination of both medical and functional needs.\n\nOutcome: E.P. had baseline electrocardiogram, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and audiology and vision screens. PFTs showed a mild restrictive lung pattern, but other tests were normal. He was referred to the multidisciplinary muscular dystrophy clinic, which involves neurology, physiatry and pulmonology. He was advised to continue PT and was prescribed lidocaine ointment for his periscapular pain.\n\nFollow-Up: E.P. was encouraged to participate in sports as tolerated but was advised to avoid strenuous muscle loading. He has continued to play both football and golf without significant difficulty and is set up for annual follow up in the multidisciplinary clinic.\n\nEndurance Runner With Peri-Abdominal Pain Particularly When Running\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Theodora Swenson, MD\n\nLauren Porras, MD\n\nAffiliation: Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nHistory: An 18 year old female long-distance runner with a history of low BMI, growth hormone deficiency, pelvic and renal cysts presented with achy, cramping pain in her lower abdomen and pelvic region that occurs only when running. The pain radiates from her pelvic region up to her stomach and began suddenly during a run. Symptoms recur only when she runs and resolve 1 hour after she stops running. No back pain or radiation down her legs, and she is able to cross train without issue. She took 6 months off of running and completed a course of physical therapy with no improvement in symptoms. Menstrual periods have been regular. Review of systems is significant only for a history of diarrhea and fatigue.\n\nPhysical Exam: She was well-developed, well-nourished and in no apparent distress. Lungs were clear to auscultation and heart was regular rate and normal rhythm. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal exam demonstrated diffuse, non-focal tenderness to palpation over the lower abdomen, pubic symphysis, and hip flexor area. Hip and back range of motion were without pain or limitation. Strength was 5 out of 5 and sensation was grossly intact along L2-S2. She had a positive left greater than right Trendelenburg with positive bilateral hamstring tightness. Negative log roll, FADIR, FABER, straight leg, and Carnett's sign.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n116. Primary gastrointestinal pathology\n\n117. Referred genitourinary pathology\n\n118. Intra-articular hip pathology\n\n119. Referred lumbar spine pain\n\n120. Musculoskeletal pathology\n\nTest Results: GI performed lower and upper endoscopies which were negative. Celiac testing was negative. She was trialed on antacids without relief. External ultrasound with OB/GYN was negative for mass. Orthopedics ordered XR and MRI of the pelvis which showed an incidental small cyst in the right pubic root. She was subsequently referred to sports medicine. Due to concerns for hypermobility of the pubic symphysis, she underwent diagnostic corticosteroid injection with 50% to 60% improvement in her pain.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Hypermobility of the pubic symphysis, or pubic symphysis dysfunction.\n\nDiscussion: Hypermobility of the pubic symphysis leads to instability in the pelvic girdle. The most frequent causes are sports-related continuous overload and pregnancy-related traumatic injuries. In runners, pelvic instability can mimic abdominal pain. Initial treatment includes physical therapy. Prolotherapy involves injecting a phenol or glucose-based solution to create an inflammatory response that leads to scarring of the ligamentous complex. Prolotherapy has been used to successfully treat sacroiliac hypermobility, and case studies suggest applications for treatment of chronic groin pain in kicking-sports. There may be additional benefits in high-impact sports such as running.\n\nOutcome: Following diagnostic corticosteroid injection to the pubic symphysis, she was able to run for the first time in a year without pain. She was recommended for bracing, pelvic floor PT, and activity modification. Prolotherapy was also discussed as a longer-term treatment option. She elected to undergo prolotherapy of her pubic symphysis with 85% improvement of pain.\n\nFollow-Up: After treatment with prolotherapy, she was able to progress back to running starting with walking without pain. She was very pleased with her progress and at clinic follow-up, she was back to running 35 miles per week. She will return every 1 to 2 years for a booster injection, when treatment efficacy is expected to wear off.\n\nChest Pain and Dyspnea: An Unexpected Flip Turn\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Joseph Blessman, MD\n\nKimberly Kaiser, MD\n\nAffiliation: University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nHistory: Seventeen-year-old male freshman division 1 swimmer with a past medical history of iron deficiency anemia presented to the training room with chest pressure and dyspnea while swimming, especially during breath holding sets. This has been a chronic issue that he first noticed during club swimming and has occurred more frequently since starting collegiate swimming practices. He was previously assessed by a sports medicine physician in his home town with a normal ECG and was released to swim without restrictions. Symptoms resolve within an hour after exertion. He does not have any chest pain or dyspnea at rest. Denies palpitations, wheezing, presyncope, syncope, vision changes, back pain, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. Positive FMH of HTN in dad but negative FMH of SCD, CV disease, or Marfan disease.\n\nPhysical Exam: Vitals: BP 139/86, Pulse 55, Temp 36.8°C, RR 16, SpO2 98% General: Well developed, no acute distress Heart: RRR. Midsystolic click. Normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4. No murmurs. Lungs: CTAB in anterior/posterior lung fields, no wheezes/rales/stridor Musculoskeletal: No abnormalities. 5/5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities Chest Wall: No TTP over anterior chest wall, ribs, intercostal spaces. Neurology: CN 2-12 intact. SILT in bilateral upper and lower extremities. 2+ pulses bilaterally in radial, femoral, posterior tibialis, dorsalis pedis.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n121. Exercise induced asthma\n\n122. Costochondritis\n\n123. Arrhythmia\n\n124. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n\n125. Aortic Root Enlargement\n\nTest Results: Twelve lead ECG: Sinus bradycardia at 47 bpm. TTE: Left ventricle mildly dilated with normal myocardial thickness and mass with normal systolic function. LVEF of 59%. Right ventricle normal size and systolic function. Aortic valve is trileaflet with mild regurgitation.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Aortic root enlargement, mild aortic regurgitation, primary essential hypertension.\n\nDiscussion: Aortic and valvular disease should always be suspected in athletes with chest pain. Swimming poses an increased risk and has a larger impact on aortic root dimensions. Patients should be referred to a cardiologist for evaluation. Workup includes laboratory evaluation, genetic testing to assess for Marfan's and other hereditary thoracic aortic diseases, ECG, TTE, and CTA/MRA as indicated. Participation in sport is difficult to stratify and determined by type of sport and aortic root and valve findings.\n\nOutcome: Referred to Cardiology. Obtained genetic testing, secondary hypertension labs, renal artery duplex, and MRA. MRA demonstrated morphology of the aorta consistent with Marfan's or familial aortic aneurysm and dissection with tri-leaflet aortic valve, aortic root enlargement with mild aortic regurgitation. Losartan initiated and uptitrated to 50mg with goal blood pressure reached thereafter.\n\nFollow-Up: Disqualified from competitive swimming. Discouraged high intensity exercise and weight lifting over 30 to 50 lb. In regards to swimming, sprint swimming is the highest physical activity and should not be longer than 50 meters. Follow-up appointment with cardiology with repeat transthoracic echocardiogram in January 2023.\n\nWhen it's Not Just a Concussion\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: John Baker, DO\n\nEric Friedman, MD and Kevin Shindelus, MD\n\nAffiliation: Trident Medical Center Emergency Medicine Residency, North Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nHistory: A 9-year-old male who had recently just played in a little league football game presented to the ED for an evaluation of altered mental status. According to the patient's parents there were no specific plays or incidents where the patient may have experienced significant trauma. The patient was in normal health after the game until during the ride home when he became somnolent and confused. The patient was unable to open his front door when he arrived home. He walked into walls, was falling to the right, and was saying things that didn't make sense such as, “I am ready to eat my breakfast” and “I need to get in there.” He began complaining of a severe frontal headache and was unable to sleep so he was brought to the ED by his parents for evaluation.\n\nPhysical Exam: GENERAL: Well appearing, well nourished. No acute distress. NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented × 3. CN intact 2-12 intact, 4/5 muscle strength RUE/RLE, 5/5 muscle strength LUE/LLE, mild hemiplegic gait, 5/5 sensory in all 4 extremities. EYES: EOMI. Anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive. HENT: Moist mucous membranes. No scleral icterus. No cervical lymphadenopathy. Nontender to cervical palpation. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No accessory muscle use. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. No JVD. ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender and non-distended. No palpable masses. EXTREMITIES: No edema. Non-tender. SKIN: No rashes or lesions. Warm.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n126. Cervical/vertebral artery injury\n\n127. Spinal cord injury\n\n128. Intracranial hemorrhage\n\n129. Diffuse Axonal Injury\n\n130. Mild traumatic bran injury\n\nTest Results: MRI, MRA head/ neck—Concerning for left sided ICA dissection. CTA of the neck confirmed left sided ICA dissection.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Carotid artery dissection.\n\nDiscussion: Carotid artery dissection can be difficult to diagnose given its often delayed presentation, vast array of symptoms, and sometimes asymptomatic presentation. Clinicians should keep a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with history of recent blunt trauma associated with any significant neurological symptoms or complaints. In the setting of blunt injury there are screening tools available to help ED physicians and trauma surgeons determine the need for further specialized imaging to assess for vascular injury. Other patients, such as in this case report, may present delayed, have a low mechanism of injury or have an array of neurological symptoms.\n\nOutcome: After approximately 10 hours from his football game, the patient returned to his normal neurological baseline. Upon further examination, his weakness and gait instability had resolved. At that time, the patient denied any symptoms including vision changes, weakness, neck pain, difficulty walking or headache.\n\nFollow-Up: The patient was begun on 81 mg of daily ASA and follow up with neurosurgery regarding length of treatment and return to activity.\n\nChronic Left Ankle Pain With an Unsuspected Cause\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Sydney Karnovsky, MD\n\nNathan Cardoos, MD\n\nAffiliation: Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nHistory: A 23-year-old recreational runner with 6 years of persistent left ankle pain presented to our clinic. The pain started insidiously. She noted landing awkwardly several times in high school gymnastics but had never sprained her ankle. Fifteen months prior to presentation, the pain in her ankle worsened while training for a half marathon, limiting her with walking. She was treated with antibiotics for an infected bug bite at student health. She ran the half 2 days later, in exquisite pain. She went to urgent care and again was given antibiotics for “an infection.” Three days later, in more pain, she presented to an ED. She was told she had a “tendon issue” and saw orthopedics. Per her report, she had an XR and MRI that were normal. She started PT. She then moved cities and presented to us after waking up with severe swelling and shooting pain from her left arch to medial malleolus.\n\nPhysical Exam: General: Well-appearing. Skin: Left ankle without rashes or signs of infection. Left Ankle Exam: Mildly antalgic gait, favoring walking on the lateral portion of the foot. Pain with toe walking and hopping. Can heel walk without pain. Obvious edema over the medial malleolus. There is tenderness along the area of swelling which follows the course of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT). No bony tenderness directly over the medial malleolus or lateral aspect of the ankle. Full range of motion in the ankle but mild discomfort with active dorsiflexion. Strength is 5/5 for eversion and plantarflexion and 4+/5 for inversion and dorsiflexion, limited by pain.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n131. Posterior tibial tendinopathy\n\n132. Posterior tibial tendon synovitis\n\n133. Tarsal tunnel syndrome\n\n134. Osteochondral defect of the medial ankle\n\n135. Spring ligament sprain\n\nTest Results: US: PTT and FDL sheaths with anechoic fluid and echogeneic material. Possible tenosynovitis. MRI WO Contrast: Mass-like fatty infiltration of PTT with extension to FDL to the navicular insertion of the PTT. Possible intramuscular lipoma versus low grade liposarcoma or lipoma arboescens of the tenson sheath. MRI w contrast recommended. MRI W Contrast: Synovial tendon lipomatosis (lipoma arborescens) of the PTT and FDL. XR Ankle: No osseous lesions. Biopsy: Tenosynovial giant cell tumor.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Giant Cell Tumor, Diffuse Type.\n\nDiscussion: This case highlights the importance of using different diagnostic modalities in sports medicine. On initial work up, our patient's tumor was missed. Her in-office US was clearly abnormal, consistent with possible tenosynovitis, prompting the decision to pursue additional imaging. This led to the series of MRIs that identified a mass, described as a synovial tendon lipomatosis, which was not the biopsy proven diagnosis. Giant cell tumors are rarely seen in the ankle, and without the MRI with contrast and eventual biopsy, this would have been misdiagnosed. Given the rarity and high recurrence (up to 45%) of diffuse type giant cell tumors in the ankle, having the correct diagnosis was critical.\n\nOutcome: Our patient had an excisional biopsy of the presumed fatty mass, and the pathology revealed a giant cell tumor, diffuse type. Ninety-nine percent of it was successfully removed during surgery. She was able to return to full activity post-operatively. To our knowledge, the tumor has not recurred, and she is doing well with no more left sided ankle pain.\n\nFollow-Up: She was placed in a boot post-operatively, weight bearing as tolerated and then advanced to a sports brace at one month. She started PT and progressed activity as tolerated. She returned to running by 3 months and jumping by 6 months post operatively.\n\nAtypical Adductor Pain in a Track Athlete\n\nPrimary Author/Presenter: Haley Oosterhouse, MD\n\nHaley Oosterhouse, MD\n\nAffiliation: Long Beach Memorial Family Medicine Residency, Long Beach, California.\n\nHistory: Twenty-one year-old male track and field sprinter presents to the training room with groin/adductor pain occurring on and off for the past 2 to 3 years. The pain is 0/10 at baseline however gets to 10/10 intensity with intense physical activity, such as sprinting in competition, and squatting. The pain is relieved with NSAIDs and foam rolling. Pain has a “sharp” and “tight” sensation. Patient has also noticed a small bump/mass with flexion of the hamstring muscles. Denies knee pain. Patient denies weakness, sensory changes, fevers, night sweats.\n\nPhysical Exam: MSK: Tenderness to palpation present over the right hamstring muscles. No tenderness to palpation at greater trochanter or adductors. 5/5 strength in hip and knee flexion and extension, however reports pain with resisted right knee flexion. No pain with resisted hip adduction. With right hamstring flexion, there is a small visible and palpable prominence in the posterior thigh when compared to the left, which is non-tender to palpation and not pulsatile. No overlying skin discoloration. Sensation of the bilateral lower extremities is equal and intact.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n136. Hamstring tendinopathy\n\n137. Femoral stress fracture\n\n138. Exertional compartment syndrome\n\n139. Soft tissue sarcoma\n\n140. Venous malformation\n\nTest Results: Bedside ultrasound at the time of initial evaluation shows possible soft tissue mass over the right hamstring near the site of pain. Normal XR femur. MRI shows a mass lesion characterized by what appears to be tortuous tubular structures measuring 4.9 × 5.2 cm, with edema in the adjacent muscle belly. Structures abut a portion of the neurovascular bundle but do not encase it.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Right thigh venous malformation.\n\nDiscussion: The incidence of VMs is ∼1%, however no clear data exists on prevalence of intramuscular VMs. VMs typically present as a soft, compressible mass with skin discoloration. If the VM is in a joint, tendon, or muscle, pain with intense exertion is a common presenting symptom. Lesions often expand during puberty due to hormonal changes. Doppler ultrasound and MRI with contrast are preferred imaging studies. Complications of intramuscular VMs include deformities, limb length discrepancy, nerve compression, and weakness. Management options include sclerotherapy, which is first-line, and surgical resection for well-demarcated VMs. Recurrence is common and curative treatment is rarely possible.\n\nOutcome: Patient was referred to a vascular surgeon. Due to patient's pain and functional impairment"
