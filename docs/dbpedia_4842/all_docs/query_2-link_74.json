        "text": "Sunday June 30 was the last day when some players could officially say that they played for Chelsea.\n\nWhile the retained list had been published for most clubs, the players who were not being offered a renewed contract were still officially Chelsea players until 11:59pm yesterday.\n\nFrom today they are free agents and able to sign for other clubs. Some will already have their future sorted, while others will be assessing their options ahead of the new season.\n\nThe Blues squad will return for pre-season over the next couple of weeks.\n\nBut who has said their goodbyes at Stamford Bridge and what lies in store for them in the future? Take a look below to find out...\n\nGary Cahill\n\nThe club captain has been at Chelsea since January 2012, when he joined from Bolton Wanderers. But the former England defender has found game time hard to come by over the last season, making just two league appearances. The 33-year-old has recently been linked with a shock switch to Arsenal, but is yet to reveal where he will play his football next season.\n\nBradley Collins\n\nThe 22-year-old goalkeeper spent the 2018/19 season on loan at League One club Burton Albion, where he played a total of 35 games, keeping 12 clean sheets.\n\nThe Chelsea academy graduate will join Barnsley on the expiry of his contract.\n\nEduardo\n\nAnother goalkeeper who is leaving Stamford Bridge this summer, the 36-year-old joined Chelsea from Dinamo Zagreb in August 2016, but spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem.\n\nThe Portuguese goalkeeper has already arranged a move back to his home country by joining SC Braga for the upcoming season.\n\nRob Green\n\nThe third goalkeeper who is leaving the club following the expiry of his contract. The former England man joined Chelsea on a free transfer last summer, but failed to make an appearance for the club.\n\nThe 39-year-old has announced his retirement from football, having made a total of 636 career appearances.\n\nTodd Kane\n\nThe 25-year-old right back has had his fair share of loans away from Stamford Bridge. Most recently he was at Hull City, where he made 41 appearances last season.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Derby County, but Frank Lampard's imminent departure to Chelsea could make it an interesting summer for the full-back.\n\nJosimar Quintero\n\nQuintero was another one of Chelsea's loan army to play his football away from the Blues last season. The 22-year-old found himself at Spanish third tier side Lleida Esportiu where he played just 16 league games.\n\nHe is yet to sort his future after being included on the released list.\n\nRuben Sammut\n\nMidfielder Sammut spent the first half of the season in the Scottish Championship playing for Falkirk FC, but returned to Chelsea in January 2019.\n\nThe 21-year-old has been linked to Sunderland.\n\nKyle Scott\n\nThe midfielder spent the first half of the 2018/19 season on loan at Dutch second division side SC Telstar, but returned to Stamford Bridge in January, having made 14 appearances for the club.\n\nThe 21-year-old has made one senior appearance for Chelsea, but will be leaving the club this summer.\n\nMartellTaylor-Crossdale\n\nAs somewhat of a rarity for Chelsea, the 19-year-old striker hasn't been on loan during his time at the club. Instead, he mainly played for the U23 side, scoring seven goals in 29 appearances.\n\nJaredThompson\n\nThompson is another goalkeeper who is leaving Chelsea this season. He spent the latter part of the season on loan at Northern Irish Premier club Warrenpoint Town, where he made five appearances, keeping two clean sheets.\n\nFankatyDabo\n\nThe 23-year-old right-back has spent the season on loan at Dutch second division side Sparta Rotterdam., where he played 26 games.\n\nDabo has already sorted his future away from Stamford Bridge, signing a three-year-deal with League One side Coventry City.\n\nGonzalo Higuain\n\nGonzalo Higuain's time at Chelsea has officially come to an end, the club have confirmed.\n\nThe Argentinian forward joined the Blues on loan in January, linking up once again with Maurizio Sarri and was expected the rediscover the brilliant form showed at Napoli when the pair last worked together.\n\nBut Higuain has failed to replicate that form in west London, scoring five goals in 18 appearances across competitions.\n\nAt the time of his signing in January, Juventus confirmed that Chelsea had initially agreed to potentially extend the loan of the Argentine for another 12 months or sign him on a permanent basis.\n\nBut they've opted against taking up that option.\n\nA statement on the club's website reads: \"Gary Cahill, Gonzalo Higuain, Rob Green, Eduardo and Kyle Scott have now left Chelsea following the end of their contracts yesterday.\"\n\nKeep up to date with the latest Chelsea news, features and exclusives from football.london via our free WhatsApp service .\n\nClick here to enroll or text NEWS to 07557204594 and then add the number to your phone contacts book as chelsea dot london (case sensitive, with spaces) to receive daily updates and breaking news from Oliver Harbord and the team on Chelsea."
