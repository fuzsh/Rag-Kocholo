        "text": "Chelsea’s 3-2 loss to Burnley was shocking to many and a huge blow for many a Fantasy owner as well.\n\nGary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas both received red cards, and all of the defenders, save for David Luiz, finished with negative points. Things do not look great for the Blues at the moment but with injuries and suspensions aplenty, there could be some shake-ups in the squad that could have interesting fantasy implications. Below are three players who could see increased or changed roles at Chelsea in the coming weeks.\n\nWillian - Midfielder, £7.2m, owned in 8.45% of teams\n\nReplacing: Eden Hazard\n\nThe Belgian has just returned to first team training but, as he had no pre-season, is not expected to return until September. In the interim, Willian’s starting position on the right side of Chelsea’s attack should be secure. His assist on Saturday came via one of his seven crosses which, considering Alvaro Morata’s heading ability, should continue to be one of Chelsea’s primary modes of attack.\n\nDavid Luiz - Defender, £6.5m, owned in 21.73% of teams\n\nReplacing: Cesc Fabregas\n\nLuiz is guaranteed the start on Sunday — the big question is where? He has played in Chelsea’s midfield in the past and found himself further up the pitch in the latter stages of Saturday’s 3-2 loss to Burnley.\n\nThe Brazilian scored a goal and also managed three shots in week one and could pose an even bigger threat if he is indeed played in a more advanced position.\n\nAndreas Christensen - Defender, £5.2m, owned by 0.1% of teams\n\nReplacing: Gary Cahill\n\nAfter two years out on loan, the big Dane finally made his first meaningful appearance for Chelsea. He came into the match on the heels of Cahill’s red card, which was obviously not an ideal situation, and left with minus-two points in the Goal game.\n\nIt’s probably unwise to bring Christensen in ahead of the Tottenham match, but if he can win a starting spot in this Blues defence, his low price and ownership would make him a fantastic Fantasy option throughout the season."
