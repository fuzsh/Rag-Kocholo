        "text": "Spring 2024 Cal South Pro+ ODP Player Pools lists have been released for the Boys and Girls 2008 and 2009 age groups (April 23, 2024). Please see further down on this page to look over each of the lists, [NOTE: The lists for the 2010-2011-2012-2013age groups (announced Feb. 6th and Feb. 15, 2024) are also still listed below,]\n\nThe named players are invited to participate in the ODP 2024 Spring Pool. This invitation-only event is an opportunity for exceptional players to compete and play with or against other elite players. This provides a new experience for many players to test their abilities in a setting that is different than their normal team environment.\n\nEach age group of players will be training to be selected by position for their respective 24-player pools that will be invited to attend the Cal South ODP Elite Development Camps in Ojai, CA, where they will work with Pro+ ODP coaches in a challenging combination of training and game activities. The Boys camp will occur July 7-10, while the Girls camp will take place July 11-14.\n\nIt is asked that if your player has been named to one of these pools that you register them for their pool at your earliest convenience. Also, if you see a player or players affiliated with your team, club, or league who have also been named on these lists, that you please let them know they have been named to a pool.\n\nCongratulations to all players who made the final cut and best of luck in your upcoming training camps!\n\nEach year, we identify 18 players from each of the Boys and Girls Winter Player Pools to participate in the annual US Youth Soccer Far West ODP Championships* in Arizona. *The 2024 event was held Jan. 4-8 at the Legacy Sports Complex in Mesa, Arizona, where Cal South won 4 more regional titles.\n\nThis event is considered part of the teams’ competition phase. US Youth Soccer ODP, our governing organization, has implemented a National Player Pathway (see image below), which includes the West ODP Regional Camp, Regional Summer ID events, National ODP Interregional Event (also January 2024), and the USYS National Team Program (with international travel).\n\nReminder: the Cal South ODP Program is open and inclusive to all players in Southern California, regardless of which league they play in."
