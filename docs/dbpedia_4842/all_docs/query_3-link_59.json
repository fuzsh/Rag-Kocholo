        "text": "TYLER – UT Tyler senior Michelle Obach has been nominated for the 2017 Allstate WBCA Good Works Teams®.\n\nA senior from Tyler, Obach is in her third season with the Patriots and enters this week with 969 points in her career. A returning WBCA All-America, she is leading the Patriots with 15.2 points per game this season and ranks fourth in program history with 246 assists and 155 steals in her career. With 31 more points, Obach will become the seventh player in UT Tyler history to surpass 1,000 career points.\n\n“Athletes are examples to a lot of people,\" Obach said. \"We may not realize that early in our careers, but we are looked at by younger kids and the community as role models. You get special treatment as an athlete and we have a responsibility to help people whenever we can. It’s a really important part of what we do. We don’t have a lot of extra time with school and basketball, but our team tries to help out as much as we can.”\n\nThis esteemed award honors an outstanding group of student-athletes who represent the sport’s finest in the areas of community service and leadership among their peers.\n\nThe Allstate WBCA and NABC Good Works Teams® recognizes players at all levels of college basketball whose charitable involvement and altruistic acts stand out amongst all other student-athletes participating in the sport. From leading an initiative to help end the water crisis in Flint, Mich., to co-founding a non-profit with the mission to improve literacy rates across the country, the players nominated embody the true spirit of teamwork and giving back.\n\n“The positive impact that student-athletes are making on college campuses and communities around the world can sometimes go unnoticed,” said Thomas Clarkson, president of the west territory for Allstate Insurance Company and a member of the 2017 WBCA and NABC Good Works Teams® selection panels. “Allstate is a proud supporter of NCAA® college basketball and takes immense pride in working with the NABC and WBCA to recognize players who continue to make giving back a priority and inspire future generations of athletes.”\n\nAthletic departments and sports information directors across the country nominated the 97 WBCA and 181 NABC student-athletes for the prestigious honor. Two special voting panels, headlined by former Duke University basketball athlete, two-time NCAA® champion and seven-time NBA All-Star Grant Hill, and former Notre Dame basketball star, two-time Nancy Lieberman Award winner and current WNBA player Skylar Diggins, will select 10-member teams from both the WBCA and NABC, comprised of five student-athletes from the NCAA Division I level and five student-athletes from Divisions II, III and the NAIA. The final roster of 20 award recipients will be unveiled in February.\n\n“It is a joy each year to partner with Allstate in recognizing the many college women’s and men’s basketball players who are performing good works in their respective communities,” said WBCA Executive Director Danielle M. Donehew. “This year’s WBCA group of 97 nominees is no exception. They are truly the heroes of our sport and deserve our gratitude. Congratulations to them all.”\n\nMembers of the Allstate WBCA Good Works Team® will be recognized during the 2017 WBCA Convention and at the 2017 NCAA Women’s Final Four® in Dallas, and will also participate in a volunteer project in the local community. Members of the Allstate NABC Good Works Team® will be invited by Allstate, an official corporate partner of the NCAA, to the 2017 NABC Convention and 2017 NCAA Men’s Final Four® in Phoenix, where they will participate in a community service project benefitting the city. Allstate is an official corporate partner of the WBCA, NABC and NCAA.\n\n“The growth of the Allstate NABC Good Works Team program in five years has been remarkable with a record-setting number again for 2017,” said NABC Executive Director Jim Haney. “We are very grateful to Allstate for shining a bright light on these men and women in college basketball whose compassion and commitment continue to help so many.”\n\nIn addition to Clarkson, Hill and Diggins, the 2017 Allstate WBCA and NABC Good Works Teams® selection panel members include: former college basketball student-athletes Clark Kellogg (Ohio State University / CBS Sports), Len Elmore (University of Maryland / CBS Sports / ESPN) and Alana Beard (Duke University); media members Seth Davis (Sports Illustrated / CBS), Dana O’Neil (ESPN), LaChina Robinson (ESPN / FOX) and Brenda VanLengen (ESPN / FOX Sports); former head coaches Bobby Cremins (Georgia Tech / College of Charleston), Seth Greenberg (Virginia Tech University), Marsha Sharp (Texas Tech University) and Nell Fortner (Auburn University); and current coach Coquese Washington (Penn State University).\n\nSince 2008, Allstate has partnered with the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) as a sponsor of the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team®, which recognizes the off-the-field impact college football student-athletes have on their communities.\n\nMore information about the Allstate WBCA Good Works Team® and the Allstate NABC Good Works Team® is available at www.wbca.org and www.nabc.org.\n\nThe following student-athletes have been nominated for consideration to be named to the 2017 Allstate WBCA Good Works Team®:\n\nNCAA Division I\n\nAbilene Christian University -

The WBCA offers educational resources that coaches need to help make themselves better leaders, teachers and mentors to their players; provides opportunities for coaches to connect with peers in the profession; serves as the unifying voice of coaches to those organizations that control the game; and celebrates those coaches, players and other individuals who excel each year and contribute to the advancement of the sport. Visit www.WBCA.org for more details about the Association.\n\nAbout the National Association of Basketball Coaches\n\nLocated in Kansas City, Missouri, the NABC was founded in 1927 by Forrest “Phog” Allen, the legendary basketball coach at the University of Kansas. Allen, a student of James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, organized coaches into this collective group to serve as Guardians of the Game. The NABC currently has nearly 5,000 members consisting primarily of university and college men’s basketball coaches. All members of the NABC are expected to uphold the core values of being a Guardian of the Game by bringing attention to the positive aspects of the sport of basketball and the role coaches play in the academic and athletic lives of today’s student-athletes. The four core values of being a Guardian of the Game are advocacy, leadership, service and education. Additional information about the NABC, its programs and membership, can be found at www.nabc.org.\n\nAbout AFCA\n\nThe AFCA was founded in 1922 and currently has more than 11,000 members around the world ranging from the high school level to the professional ranks. According to its constitution, the AFCA was formed, in part, to “maintain the highest possible standards in football and in the coaching profession” and to “provide a forum for the discussion and study of all matters pertaining to football.”\n\nAbout the NCAA\n\nThe NCAA is a diverse association of more than 1,100 member colleges and universities that prioritize academics, well-being and fairness to create greater opportunities for nearly half a million student-athletes each year. The NCAA provides a pathway to higher education and beyond for student-athletes pursuing academic goals and competing in NCAA sports. More than 54,000 student-athletes experience the pinnacle of intercollegiate athletics by competing in NCAA championships each year. Visit ncaa.org and ncaa.com for more details about the Association and the corporate partnerships that support the NCAA and its student-athletes. The NCAA is proud to have AT&T, Capital One and Coca-Cola as official corporate champions and the following elite companies as official corporate partners: Allstate, Amazon Echo, Bing (Microsoft), Buffalo Wild Wings, Buick, Enterprise, Infiniti, LG, Lowe’s, Nabisco, Northwestern Mutual, Pizza Hut, Reese’s, Unilever and Wendy’s.\n\nAbout Allstate"
