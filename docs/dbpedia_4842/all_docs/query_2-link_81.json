        "text": "The ambition shown by Major League Soccer side New York Red Bulls drew Australian midfielder Tim Cahill to sign for the Major League Soccer side.\n\nCahill left Everton for the MLS, with the move subject to international clearance, where he will play alongside former Premier League players Thierry Henry and Teemu Tainio.\n\nThey are currently top of the Eastern Conference and the 32-year-old is desperate to help his side claim what would be their first title.\n\n\"I am very happy to start a new chapter of my career with the New York Red Bulls,\" Cahill told the official website.\n\n\"As we have seen over the past few years, MLS has developed into a very competitive league with many talented players.\n\n\"I am impressed with what the Red Bulls are trying to accomplish in MLS and within American soccer and I am looking forward to this new challenge. I will do everything I can to help bring New York its first MLS Cup.\"\n\nHis excitement is matched by the club, who believe his achievements in the game will make him a real asset.\n\n\"We are absolutely thrilled to bring in a player of Tim's calibre to the Red Bulls,\" said New York Red Bulls general manager and sporting director Erik Soler.\n\n\"He is the technical, physical presence we have been looking to add in our team and he brings a wealth of experience to our club having played in some of the highest levels of international soccer. Tim is a proven leader both on and off the field and we believe that he can help us immediately in our quest to win the MLS Cup this season.\"\n\nCahill played 278 times for David Moyes' men and after just eight years at Goodison Park was sad to leave the north west.\n\n\"I also want to thank everyone at Everton, from the club to tremendous supporters,\" he added.\n\n\"It has been a privilege to be an Everton player for the past eight years and it was a very difficult decision to leave. I will always support Everton and I wish the club the best of luck in the future.\"\n\nToffees chairman Bill Kenwright, meanwhile, has expressed his \"heartfelt thanks\" to Cahill.\n\n\"On a personal level, I will miss the first-ever player that David and I went to see together, and the wide-eyed bundle of energy that walked into my office a short time later and told me that Everton was his destiny,\" Kenwright said.\n\n\"And he now embarks on a new stage of his career with our heartfelt thanks, and of course our real best wishes for his future.\n\n\"I can guarantee New York Red Bulls will have many, many admirers cheering them on from across the Ocean. All wearing the Blue of Everton. Thank you Tim.\"\n\nThe transfer represents a good move for Everton also as it gets the 32-year-old, who was one of the club's highest earners on Â£55,000-a-week, off the wage bill.\n\nThat should and should pave the way for the club to step up their efforts to re-sign Tottenham midfielder Steven Pienaar.\n\n\"We accepted this offer for Tim with a heavy heart but it is a great way for him to end his Everton career,\" Kenwright added on evertonfc.com\n\n\"The transfer salutes Tim's unswerving commitment to our cause over the last eight years and also respects his desire never to play against Everton.\""
