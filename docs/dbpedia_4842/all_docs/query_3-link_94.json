        "text": "Louise Quinn holds no illusions about the challenge that awaits her and the Republic of Ireland team when they take on Germany in their final Euro 2021 qualifier in Tallaght this Tuesday.\n\n“Even if they’ve already qualified, they’re still by far one of the strongest teams in the world”, said Quinn speaking to the media ahead of the game.\n\nIreland must defeat the side they lost to 3-0 a few short months ago if they are to have any hope of reaching a play-off spot.\n\nDespite this, Quinn remains unphased: “We’ve got to believe, we’ve got to know that it is still in our hands – yes, against a very very tough opponent, but it is still in our hands to get that play-off spot as well.\n\n“We wouldn't be here if we didn't think so.\n\n“So for me, we've got to get out there, enjoy our football, give everything we've got and put out performances that we can do.\n\n“We know they're going to have a lot of possession of the ball, but its what we do to counteract that and what we do with our chances”, she added.\n\nIreland find themselves in this precarious position following a bitterly disappointing 1-0 away loss to Ukraine in October.\n\nQuinn admits that she did meditate on the defeat for some time: “[The Ukraine loss] was really difficult, there's no doubt about it. You definitely gave yourself a bit of time to be moping around the place, and a little bit moody alright.\n\n“I think that was a good way for me to just try deal with, be upset with it, take on and learn from that game.\n\n“It was very very hard to take, but at the end of the day that's football and you know for me, we actually played a really really good game, and things just didn't fall for us.\n\n“There wasn't too much else we could have done apart from scoring a goal really in that Ukraine game.”\n\nThe Fiorentina defender comes into Tuesday’s match in good form, following a steady stream of performances with her new club. Quinn hopes that her burgeoning skillset can aid her side against the Germans.\n\n“In Italy, it's something that I've really enjoyed the challenge of – reading strikers. They're excellent with their back to goal, and it's all about, almost reading their body language to see where they might go, they just love a little flick around the corner.\n\n“It's actually really a reading, a reading game of body language and anticipation.\n\n“Because the movement of the German players is excellent as well, you know, and they link up really well, and you see that a lot as well with the strikers in the Italian league.”\n\n“I'm just hoping I can bring a little bit of that, and even, more of that Italian passion.”"
