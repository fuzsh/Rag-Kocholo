He provides valuable advice for current players looking to transition into coaching and emphasizes the importance of mental strength and developing good habits early in a player‚Äôs career.

This year, I've had the privilege of coaching a diverse group ranging from boys and girls as young as 5 to young men aged 16-20. Through this experience, I aim to impart some wisdom gained from the game I love deeply and to further my own growth and learning from the invaluable lessons that football teaches us about life. üåü‚öΩ #FootballCoaching #LifeLessons #PersonalGrowth\n\nBeen a huge 8 months coaching the Suns Under 16 group. Has been a great period of learning and growth individually as a coach and person, and have learned so much around building a strong environment, planning, teaching fundamentals and game style and reviewing players individually. Whilst it wasn‚Äôt successful in terms of win/loss, I know we have seen 36 boys improve no end from when they started, and have given them the foundations to progress their game no matter what level they end up playing at. #football #coaching #review\n\n‚ÄúIf you can feel it you can fix it‚Äù ~Coach Weezie As a private softball instructor, I consistently repeat this phrase to my girls.
