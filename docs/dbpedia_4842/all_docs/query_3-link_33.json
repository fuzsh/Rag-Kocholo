        "text": "One of the most decorated student-athletes at Texas A&M, John David Crow was born July 8, 1935 and grew up in Springhill, Louisiana where he earned All-America honors in football and also lettered in basketball and track. He was recruited to Texas A&M by Head Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant and assistant coach Elmer Smith and came to campus as a true freshman in 1954.\n\nCrow remarked how he was glad he did not have to attend the football camp in Junction since freshmen were ineligible at that time.\n\nIn addition to playing running back he played defensively and was known for his tough, physical playing style. Crow earned three letters under Coach Bryant from 1955-57. In 1957, he and his teammates helped the Aggies reach No. 1 in the polls. He was the first Heisman Trophy winner in Texas A&M history and the only Heisman Trophy winner in Coach Bryant’s illustrious career. (A partial list of his awards will follow at the end of this release.)\n\nWhen Coach Bryant retired from coaching football, he was quoted as saying, “John David Crow was the finest player I ever coached. Watching film on him was like watching a grown man play with boys.”\n\nIn addition to his exploits on the field, Crow, Texas A&M Class of ’58, earned his degree in business administration and was named to the 1957 Scholastic All-America team presented by the America Peoples Encyclopedia and was named to the Who’s Who in American Colleges and Universities.\n\nThe second player selected overall in the 1958 NFL draft by the Chicago Cardinals, Crow played 11 seasons in the NFL serving as a team captain of the Cardinals and finishing his career playing and serving as a team captain for the San Francisco 49ers. He was a four-time selection to the Pro Bowl and was named to the All-Pro team of the 1960’s as a halfback.\n\nAfter his playing career, Crow went into coaching. He began with Coach Bryant on the Alabama coaching staff and also coached on the NFL level with the Cleveland Browns and the San Diego Chargers.\n\nHe was named the head coach and athletics director at Northeast Louisiana University, now known as the University of Louisiana Monroe.\n\nTexas A&M athletics director and head football coach Jackie Sherrill brought Aggieland’s favorite son back home in 1983 to serve as associate athletics director and remained in that role until he was promoted to Athletics Director in December of 1988. Crow served in that capacity until 1993.\n\nDuring his time as the associate and athletics director, Crow was at the forefront of gender equity at Texas A&M. Something he always felt strongly about was instilled by his parents and Coach Bryant—“if you do anything, do it to the best of your abilities.”\n\nCrow would continue to serve Texas A&M as the Director of Athletic Development from 1993 until he officially retired from Texas A&M University in June of 2001. In his role, Crow was responsible for the endowment of several scholarships as well as overall fundraising for the athletics department.\n\nCrow was inducted into the Texas A&M Hall of Fame in 1968, the Louisiana Hall of Fame in 1976 and was named to the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame in 1976 and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1982. In 2004, he was named a Distinguished Alumnus by Texas A&M and was recently honored during the Aggies’ first year in the Southeastern Conference as an SEC Legend at the 2012 SEC Championship Game.\n\nCrow attended the Heisman Trophy ceremonies whenever possible and took great pride in Johnny Manziel winning the trophy in 2012.\n\nThe core values of Texas A&M University—respect, integrity, leadership, excellence, loyalty and selfless service truly describe this Aggie legend, John David Crow.\n\nHe passed away on June 17, 2015 at the age of 79 surrounded by his wife, Carolyn, their two daughters, Annalisa Stenklyft and Jeannie Pietrowiak, and several grandchildren.\n\nACCOLADES\n\nNamed SEC Football Legend honored at SEC Championship Game (2012)\n\nNamed a Distinguished Alumnus by Texas A&M (2004).\n\nNamed the PricewaterhouseCoopers Doak Walker Legends Award (2004)\n\nA member of the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame (1976)\n\nA member of the Texas A&M Athletic Hall of Fame (1968)\n\nA member of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame (1982)\n\nA member of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame (1976)\n\nA member of the Louisiana Sports Museum of Champions (2001)\n\nMorris Frank Touchdowner Award (1979) presented by the Houston Touchdown Club for contributions and outstanding achievements reflecting honor and scholarship to the game of football\n\nWinner of the 1957 Heisman Memorial Trophy presented by the Downtown Athletic Club of New York\n\n1991 recipient of the Distinguished American Award presented by the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame\n\nWinner of the 1957 Walter Camp Memorial Trophy presented by the Washington, D.C.
