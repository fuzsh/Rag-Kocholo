        "text": "Incorrect penalty decisions were made by the video assistant referee in all three of Thursday's games, a former referee working for the Premier League match centre told BBC Match of the Day.\n\nBruno Fernandes won a spot-kick which he scored in Manchester United's 3-0 win over Aston Villa.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse hit the bar after a disputed penalty as Southampton drew 1-1 with Everton.\n\nAnd Tottenham should have had a penalty for a Joshua King shove on Harry Kane in a 0-0 draw with Bournemouth.\n\nEx Premier League official Dermot Gallagher advised that United and Southampton should not have been given penalties, but Tottenham should have been awarded one.\n\nFormer Everton midfielder Tim Cahill, a Match of the Day pundit, said a former player should be involved to work alongside the VAR officials at Stockley Park.\n\n\"I think that would really help them, to understand the movements,\" the former Australia international said.\n\n\"When a player falls to buy a penalty you can feel it. It must need a player there to give advice on what the player is doing.\n\n\"They're there to make the big decisions and they can't do it. It's really disappointing.\"\n\nFifa is taking over direct responsibility of VAR from football rulemakers IFAB and is expected to insist on greater consistency across more than 100 global leagues, on issues such as the use of pitchside monitors.\n\nThere has been confusion in the Premier League, with referees' chief Mike Riley limiting the use of monitors to ensure the game is not slowed down.\n\nTottenham manager Jose Mourinho said \"everyone in the world\" thought his side should have had a penalty, apart from video assistant referee Michael Oliver.\n\nKing pushed Kane in the back as he defended a cross but referee Paul Tierney did not award a penalty and Oliver chose not to intervene.\n\nOliver, who will referee Sunday's north London derby against Arsenal, was also the VAR official when Kane had a goal ruled out in Spurs' 3-1 defeat by Sheffield United last week.\n\n\"The game had the most important moment - you know when, you know who,\" said the Spurs boss.\n\nMourinho told BBC MOTD he feels \"powerful people do not like to be criticised\".\n\nAsked to clarify who he was referring to, Mourinho told Sky Sports: \"The same referee that was the VAR against Sheffield United. In the world, everybody knows that is a penalty. And I say everybody, I mean everybody.\n\n\"Like Sheffield, the man of the match was not one of the players. But at Sheffield I could blame myself and the players, today I could not do that.\"\n\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Dion Dublin said: \"It's clear because Harry is setting himself ready to head that ball and he gets fouled. It is a penalty.\"\n\nThe pre-planned move for Fifa to manage the implementation of VAR comes at the end of a four-year process as it was phased into elite football.\n\nAlthough Fifa has declared VAR to be \"a universal success\", the lack of pitchside monitors in the Premier League went against the general guidance and the expectation is Fifa will expect this to be used more extensively.\n\nIn addition, rules around handball, offside and goalkeepers standing on their lines for penalty kicks will all be dealt with through Fifa, with clarification expected for next season, which individual leagues will be expected to adhere to."
