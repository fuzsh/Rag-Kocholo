        "text": "Speaker Dr. Jon Oliver\n\nYoung athletes represent a truly unique population. Inevitably those athletes with aspirations to excel in sport will need to specialize at some point. However, intensified sport-specific training around periods of rapid growth and development can bring many challenges. Rapid growth and lag times in the growth of different systems can make young athletes more susceptible to injury, while the underlying processes that contribute to growth, maturation and development may have implications for how young athletes adapt to training. While practitioners should not shy away from using high training-intensities with young athletes there is a need to first develop training skills, to progress training appropriately and to consider the extra time that young athletes may need for recovery between sessions. By investing time in building solid foundations a long-term athletic development program should be able to create robust athletes who are better able to avoid and recovery from injuries, and athletes who are able to train and perform at a higher level when they leave a youth program.\n\nThis will be a practical session where delegates are introduced to solutions for developing a broad range of athletic motor skill qualities in young athletes. Together with developing good base levels of strength, these athletic motor skills represent the building blocks of training and provide the foundations that can then be progressed to more complex training to benefit both performance and injury. Different types of athletic motor skill competencies will be introduced together with a framework for progressing skills and demonstrations provided to show how this can work in a practical setting with young athletes of varying ability and experience.\n\nDuring this lecture, we will look at other aspects of running that are often missed in training and often lead to a stagnation of training or lack of development, or even in some cases injury. More specifically, we will look at the role of lateral stability in the hip and the function of the foot/ankle complex. This will be practically demonstrated during the workshop to reinforce take home messages for practitioners to make a difference with their athletes.\n\nDuring this workshop, we will look at other aspects of running that are often missed in training and often lead to a stagnation of training or lack of development, or even in some cases injury. More specifically, we will look at the role of lateral stability in the hip and the function of the foot/ankle complex. This will be practically demonstrated during the workshop to reinforce take home messages for practitioners to make a difference with their athletes.\n\nResisted sled training (RST) is a commonly used method of sprint specific training, however there is a lack of uniformity on training guidelines and best practice. RST can be used as a mode of horizontal strength training to compliment a well rounded training program to improve speed. This workshop is aimed at providing valuable practical insight from evidence based research on young athletes to better equip coaches to assess, prescribe and coach RST to enhance speed. Of particular interest to practitioners dealing with young athletes will be the interaction of maturation and training competence on the phase of targeted sprint adaptation.\n\nThis session will cover practical methods of managing athletes training and performance throughout the in-season phase of the annual cycle. With the goal of creating “optimal performance” repeatedly throughout the team sport season, athletes must be trained appropriately throughout the off-season, and then trained/managed accordingly during the competition cycle. These management techniques include, but are not limited to, weight room training, practice planning, and occasionally return to play procedures. Each of these require a high level of communication and understanding among staff and athletes if players are to be “fast and fresh” for repeated performances throughout the season.\n\nThis lecture will cover the three different domains that collaborate to return the injured athlete back to sport following ACL injury: surgical reconstruction, physical therapy rehabilitation and performance. The clinician or coach is often highly specialized in one domain, sometimes lacking exposure to the roles and considerations of others involved in the continuum of care. Theoretically, the model is seamless and collaborative – in practice, it is often not. This lecture will discuss best practice for this unique patient population and highlight high-yield, practical insights and advice for use in the clinic or weight room.\n\nJon is a Professor (Full) of Applied Paediatric Exercise Science at Cardiff Metropolitan University, where he co-founded the Youth Physical Development Centre. That Centre provides an interface for evidence-based practice, housing a team of researchers and coaches who provide strength and conditioning support to young athletes aged 6-18 years old while also undertaking research in long-term athletic development. This research is centred around three key themes; injury, performance and the health and wellbeing of young athletes. Jon has published over 100 international peer-review articles, contributed to numerous consensus and position statements on youth resistance training and athletic development and works with a host of institutes, sports and professional organisations both nationally and internationally. This includes recently co-authoring the American College of Sports Medicine Essentials of Youth Fitness textbook. Jon is also an Adjunct Professor at the Sports Performance and Research Institute New Zealand.\n\nRhodri is a Reader in Paediatric Strength and Conditioning at Cardiff Metropolitan University and Chair of the Youth Physical Development Centre, which offers after-school strength and conditioning provision to young athletes. He also holds a research associate position with Auckland University of Technology and is a research fellow for Waikato Institute of Technology. His research interests surround the impact of growth and maturation on long-term athletic development, and the neuromuscular mechanisms underpinning training adaptations in youth. He is a senior associate editor for the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research and an associate editor for the Strength and Conditioning Journal. In 2016, he received the Strength and Conditioning Coach of the Year award for Research and Education from the UK Strength and Conditioning Association (UKSCA) and in 2017 was awarded the Terry J. Housh Outstanding Young Investigator of the Year award from the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA).\n\nDr. Micheál Cahill, originally from Limerick, Ireland serves as the Vice President of Performance and Sports Science at Athlete Training + Health. Micheál is responsible for the training philosophy within ATH for all training programs, the development of all coaches within ATH and the daily integration of services between hospital, academic and professional team partnerships as well as assisting in company growth and strategy. Micheál has previously worked as the Director of Sports Science at Jesuit College in Dallas catering to the needs of 750 athletes from 21 sports weekly from 2013 – 2018. Prior to that he owned a sports performance company and worked at Baylor University and the Clare Senior Gaelic Football Team. He also worked with numerous individual athletes across a broad range of sports from amateur to professional level across the world. Micheál completed his undergraduate and Masters degrees in Ireland before obtaining his PhD at Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand focusing on acceleration and resisted sprinting in young athletes. Current research interests include the influence of strength, speed and power on youth athletes of varying maturation.\n\nChris Korfist is a speed/performance coach from Chicago, Illinois. In addition to being a high school sprint coach, he also operates his facility, Slow Guy Speed School, which caters to a variety of athletes ranging from elementary school athletes to professional/Olympic athletes. He also co-owns TrackFootballConsortium.com which is a bi-annual conference bringing together outside the box thinkers who focus on building a better athlete effectively. He also is co-owner of Reflexive Performance Reset which is a system of breathing and neurological drills that empower your clients and athletes to create instant improvements in their performance.\n\nMatt Van Dyke is the Associate Director of Applied Sports Science at the University of Texas.
