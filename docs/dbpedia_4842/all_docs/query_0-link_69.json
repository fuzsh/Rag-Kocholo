        "text": "Well, there's another exciting left-sided forward waiting in the wings who has the potential to light up the Premier Division when the Boynesiders return to the top flight in 2021.\n\nCahill was sitting alongside PFA Ireland general secretary Stephen McGuinness when the players union confirmed Mark Doyle as First Division Player of the Year at their awards ceremony, held via Zoom last Wednesday.\n\nDoyle has been with the Drogs since the age of 16 and is still only 22, but the level-headed Skerries native believes he needs to make an impact against the big guns like Shamrock Rovers and Dundalk to stand any chance of making a career out of soccer.\n\nDoyle faced tough opposition for the First Division honour - he was on the short list of three with UCD strikers Yousef Mahdy and Colm Whelan - but PFA Ireland members voted for the Drogheda player who bagged 13 goals from 19 starts, including a hat-trick in a crucial 3-2 win over Shamrock Rovers II towards the end of the season.\n\nNow the challenge gets tougher and Doyle is only too aware of the challenge he and his Drogheda teammates face, having made eight starts and eight substitute appearances for the club the last time they were in the Premier Division, in 2017.\n\n'I'd like to think that I'm improving every year,' he said.\n\n'Ever since Tim [Clancy] and Kev Doherty came in, they've put so much confidence in me. They give me their trust and everything I need to improve really. Up in Drogheda they have so much faith in me and I always want to do well for them and for the fans.\n\n'I'm working hard and hopefully I can improve again another step next year, but it's going to be tough. We'll be coming up against players now in the league who are full-time, so we have to be ready for it.\n\n'We're going to be up against it most games. Hopefully we can surprise a few people. Maybe people won't know much about us. We might be able to cause a few shocks and get a few results.\n\n'It'll be important to pick up points against the teams around us that'll probably be towards the lower end of the table.\n\n'I think once you get promoted, your aim has to be to stay up and try to work from there.'\n\nThree years ago Drogheda weren't able to achieve that and they finished bottom of the pack 12 months after Pete Mahon had steered them to a thrilling play-off victory over Wexford.\n\n'I think I was only 17 when I made my [Premier] debut against [Shamrock] Rovers,' Doyle recalled. 'I started up front and got Man of the Match, but I wasn't consistently in the team. I was in and out most of the time - I can't really remember - but it was tough and a lot faster than the First Division.\n\n'I feel more prepared for it now than I would have been back then, definitely.'\n\nAs for the longer term, Doyle clearly feels it would be premature to give any thought to eventually carving out a career for himself across the water.\n\n'I don't know, to be honest,' he said when asked if such a move was on his radar.\n\n'Full-time football is probably an aim of mine in the future, but I'm training kind of full-time myself anyway and putting all my focus into football, doing a lot of work in the gym even though it doesn't look like it. So it's not too much different for me at the minute [compared to full-time football] - just training in the evenings obviously.\n\n'I had a good season in the First Division, but without disrespecting the First Division you're not getting looked at for doing well from anywhere else.\n\n'You have to become a Premier Division player first, an established Premier Division player, and do well and then maybe you'd have a chance [of going across the water], but for now definitely not.'\n\nNevertheless, it's perhaps just as well for Drogheda United that Doyle had already put pen to paper on a new deal before his award was confirmed last week - not that he was likely to be swayed by any other League of Ireland club after completing six seasons at United Park.\n\n'I've been there now since I was 16, so to come up through the age groups is always good,' he reflected.\n\n'I was playing with Glebe North Under-16s in Balbriggan and was doing well there and I wanted to make the step up to a League of Ireland team so I could go then hopefully go up through the age groups and get into a first team.\n\n'It was an open trial with Drogheda Under-17s [that led to joining the club]. Rob McQuillan was the manager then and he obviously liked me and he picked me and then from there I progressed onto the 19s and then to the first team.\n\n'The first time I was in with the first team was 2016 when we got promoted, but I didn't really feature. This year because I was playing every week I really felt part of it. Obviously it was great to be around in 2016, but to play a key role and actually get promoted was much better.\n\n'We've been trying for three seasons and we missed out in the play-offs for the last two years. Drogheda is a Premier Division club and it was an easy decision [to stay] because for three years we were trying to get up and now that we've done it you have to give it a go with Drogheda in the Premier.\n\n'You can see what it means to everybody and we deserved to be there at the end of the season because the league table doesn't lie.'"
