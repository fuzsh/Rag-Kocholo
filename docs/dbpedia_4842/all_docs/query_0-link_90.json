        "text": "Success breeds success at Páirc Nh Uinsionn as St Vincent’s intermediate footballers defeated St Pat’s of Donabate, 1-14 to 1-8, in last Sunday’s IFC Final at O’Toole Park.\n\nOllie Cahill kicked an invaluable 0-4 from play for the Marino men over the course of the hour while Ronan Brady’s 19th minute goal helped Vincent’s to a 1-5 to 0-3 interval lead.\n\nEarly in the second half Vincent’s moved eight points clear following points from Alan Moore, Ronan Brady and Matthew Garland.\n\nHowever, Pat’s refused to buckle and Dinny Corcoran’s 41st minute goal and a brace of points from Dean Styles had them right back in contention.\n\nPoints from Albert Martin and Ollie Cahill settled Vincent’s nerves and despite a lot of late aerial pressure from Pat’s the Marino side held on for victory.\n\nIn the Dublin IHC final Castleknock came with a scoring surge going down the home straight to defeat Nh Mearnóg 0-15 to 0-9.\n\nMearnóg led 0-6 to 0-5 at half-time but the introduction of Dublin footballer, Ciarán Kilkenny, gave Castleknock a greater physical presence close to goal in the second period.\n\nThe match was there for the taking in the last quarter but it was the Dublin 15 lads who found the scores with Niall O’Callaghan, Jamie Tunney and Frank Murray on target to see their side to victory."
