There was plenty of promising talent on show and the League of Ireland managers who were present would surely have been impressed by what they saw.\n\nBelvedere took control of the game from the kick off and went into a 2-0 lead with goals from Christopher Forrester and Anthony Corcoran. The Orchard though fought their way back into the game and forced the game into extra time with goals from Karl Connaughton and Gareth Deasy.\n\nExtra-time ebbed and flowed from end to end, Belvedere went back in front only to be pegged back again but Belvo finally ran out winners by 4-3 with Christopher Forrester bagging his second and the winner of a pulsating game.\n\nStuart Byrne was on hand to present Belvedere captain Craig Sexton with the impressive winner's trophy and Ollie Cahill gave Sean Skelly of Belvedere his well deserved Man-of-the-Match award.\n\nWe are sure we will be seeing some of these players grace the League of Ireland pitches over the coming years and already we've seen Craig Sexton and Christopher Forrester sign for Bohemians.\n\nThe PFAI will be there to assist all young players every step of the way and help them make the transition from schoolboy football to senior football.\n\nThe PFAI would like to thank DDSL Chairman Tommy Heffernan and Secretary Fran Ray for their help and vision and we look forward to our relationship growing even stronger in the years to come. Any player who is coming into the league and needs any advice please feel free to contact us at any time on 01 899 9350.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nWINNERS The Belverdere under 17 team who defeated Cherry Orchard"
