        "text": "Last week the Football Association of Ireland jetted a number of domestic club managers off to San Marino for a few days, to take in the international game as a treat (we use the term lightly), mend fences and talk about the new league starting in a few weeks' time. Most of them, possibly in some bizarre group-flagellation moment, packed their notebooks and cilices and headed over. There was one high-profile absentee however: title-holders Shelbourne didn't send anyone. The reason? Well, right now they don't have a manager. Or a team. Or a whole lot else for that matter, except debts and doubts for the future. And thing is, thier plight isn't surprising. Shels, with fancy dreams of the Champions League group stages, had been living hand-to-mouth for a while.\n\nSuffice to say it was always a long shot. Ollie Byrne, owner and one-man-band when it came to running the show, had spotted a chink of European glory when 24,000 came to Lansdowne Road a couple of years ago for a Champions League qualifier against Deportivo La Coruna. Byrne gambled all his chips, assembled a huge squad, paying massive wages for the top players and sat back in hope it'd come together. It didn't, at least not financially. Last season - a title-winning one - Shels could only manage average attendances of around 1,500, and that was the main income stream. The owner admitted that one Intertoto match brought in gate receipts of 7,000 that needed to last a fortnight. TV money (about 5,000 a game for the home team) and prize money just don't match up with other leagues in Europe. The wage bill was 38,000 a week. You don't need to work with Ernst & Young to know those sums don't add up.\n\nSo players went unpaid for weeks at a time, especially in times when the were few home games, and unpaid taxes led to three winding-up orders at different times. Byrne usually managed to scrape the money together but it was all very random and haphazard. Recent estimates point to a debt of over 10m - made up variously of those unpaid wages and taxes, monies borrowed from individuals to pay weekly running costs, and mostly of money drawn down against the sale of their ground, Tolka Park, over the last few years (about 6m).\n\nIf that's the off-field kerfuffle, the on-field matters don't make any better reading. The real fun and games started pretty much right after lifting the title in mid-November. Manager Pat Fenlon was gone within a week and up in Derry a little while later. The players were mostly free agents - some of them due to contracts running out, some because unpaid wages made contracts void - and the likes of Bohemians (Glen Crowe, Owen Heary), Drogheda (Stuart Byrne, Ollie Cahill, Richie Baker) and St Pat's (Joey Ndo, Gary O'Neill) all scavenged their share until the largest squad in the country was gone for nothing. Of others, Jason Byrne went to Cardiff, Sean Dillon to Dundee Utd and Colin Hawkins to Coventry. Think the Juve clearout of last summer without the huge fees and without anyone actually staying behind. As cheap talent leaving a club goes, it's up there with the latest Britney Spears/Paris Hilton night out.\n\nThe ins and outs of the story might be as straightforward as your average episode of Twin Peaks, and it's still all rather blurred right now. When Byrne ended up in hospital for brain surgery (that's right, it's been a real humdinger of a month or two), former chairman Finbarr Flood went about putting a deal together to draw down more funds from Ossie Kilkenny, the option-holder for the ground. The sticking point seems to be that Byrne won't be allowed to run the club on a day-to-day basis. Right now, Shels are trying to convince the FAI licensing group that they're fit to continue as a club and that they can work their debts, though chances are that some penalty (relegation, points deduction) could be imposed or even that they could be denied a license and go out of existence.\n\nDeadlines have come and gone and Shels have been the college student looking for more time. The feeling is that the FAI will do whatever it can to ensure they survive, but the coming year will be a tough one with a hugely reduced budget (last year's expenditure was 2.6m - double their income). Oh yeah, and there's the small matter of a manager and some players before the start of the season in March. If they don't get the chop, Shels will have learnt the hard way."
