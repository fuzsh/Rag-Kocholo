        "text": "A REVIEW OF SHELBOURNE F.C.'S 2002/03 SEASON\n\nThe executive summary of this review reads as follows - knocked out of Europe thanks to a very late goal, knocked out of the FAI Cup thanks to a very late goal, and eventually knocked out of the running for the league thanks to a very late goal. Yes, it was THAT bad and that's without even mentioning the Great Flood of 2002 However, there were also some positive moments along the way and these will hopefully leave a more lasting impression in the memory than some of the other events that will be painfully recalled below.\n\nThe buzzword this season was \"transitional\". Firstly, there was the move from a \"winter league\" format to a summer one. This meant that this season's campaign lasted just 27 matches in order to accommodate the change-over, with the Cup Final played mid-season. Secondly, there was the managerial change at Shelbourne with rookie Pat Fenlon becoming player-manager, although it would soon prove to be more of the latter than the former. Thirdly, the perennial sight of a Shelbourne squad being reconstructed in the close-season meant continuity had once more been sacrificed in the attempt to find a more successful combination of players. All in all, it seemed likely that it would take the Reds some time to get going and the first dozen or so competitive games would later confirm this view.\n\nBefore that, though, pre-season preparations went smoothly enough with a decent run of warm-up results finally ended by successive thumpings by Glasgow Celtic and a full-strength Manchester United team that notably featured the first footballing appearance by Roy Keane following that infamous pre-World Cup spat with Mick McCarthy. From Shelbourne's point of view, these games also gave most fans their first glimpses of new signings Stuart Byrne, Mark Roberts, Trevor Molloy, Ollie Cahill, and David Crawley.\n\nHowever, any early confidence quickly vanished when Shelbourne became the first of many scalps a dynamic young Cork City side would take in front of a heaving Turner's Cross crowd. A 3-0 battering seemed a let-off in the circumstances. A shell-shocked team then nervously see-sawed its way to a 3-3 home draw with another of the campaign's fast-starters, Drogheda United. It was a rocky start, but even worse, though, was to follow in Europe\n\nDrawn with Hibernians of Malta, the Reds had the enticing carrot of playing Boavista of Portugal dangled in front of them should they emerge triumphant from the first qualifying round of the Champions' League. A 2-2 away draw seemed like a respectable first-leg result, with the Reds' superior fitness making up for the difficulties caused by the heat. However, the home leg was as sorry a tale as has befallen this club in Europe. Having battered the away goal all game, only to be stopped by a combination of poor finishing, a keeper in exceptional form, and a debatable \"offside\" decision, the Reds still looked to be going through on the \"away\" goals rule, until the Maltese threw everything into one last effort and nicked a precious winning goal with time virtually up. It was a desperate, desperate moment that will probably haunt the club for many years to come.\n\nPerhaps angered by this result, the Reds then produced 21 goals in their next 6 games, with 16 of these coming in successive hidings dealt out to Rockmount in the Cup and then Bray and UCD in the league. Stephen Geoghegan produced this site's Goal-of-the-Season with a fine scissors-kick against College. But another low point in the season was only a couple of games away\n\nFor better or worse, the coming together of Shelbourne and St. Patrick's Athletic has recently become a great source of publicity for the league. So when their first league meeting was to be immediately followed by a third-round Cup clash, comparisons with that great battle in 1998 were inevitable. Shelbourne may have emerged victorious from the earlier epic struggle, but Pats won both of this season's matches. Having lost the league game 2-1 in Tolka, Shelbourne crossed the river knowing they would need to produce much better football to remain in the Cup. Great was the surprise of all Reds then to be greeted with an absolute meadow of a playing surface that seemed deliberately prepared in order to stop Shelbourne from playing its brand of football. The match itself was a fearsome struggle, with Shelbourne eventually cancelling out an early lead for Pats with just minutes to go. Once more, though, came that dreaded late sting in the tail, as a very dubious free-kick was awarded and then converted to give the home side a fortunate win.\n\nWith only the league really left to focus on, Shelbourne seemed to get its season back on track with a win over Longford and a draw with Shamrock Rovers, before claiming a rare President's Cup win when Tony Sheridan, beginning a third spell with the club, bagged a brace against Dundalk. However, another worrying collapse came with successive defeats to, firstly, run-away league leaders Bohemians and then Derry City. Shelbourne had done more than enough to earn a result in both games, but good fortune was notable by its absence. Accordingly, a title challenge was looking less and less likely.\n\nHowever, the tragic news that popular former Shelbourne player, Stephen Yeates, had passed away at the age of 38 came as an undesired reminder that there are much more important things in life than losing some football matches. Sympathies go out once more to his wife and young family.\n\nFortunately, though, having lost four of its first nine league games, Shelbourne would lose only four more over the remaining eighteen games of the season, starting with a run of eleven wins in fourteen matches. To begin with, a 2-2 draw in Inchicore was sandwiched on either side with wins over Cork, Longford, Drogheda, and UCD, before the Reds slipped to another unlucky defeat - this time to Shamrock Rovers, who had the good grace to acknowledge as much in their subsequent match-day programme.\n\nThis defeat, though, left Shelbourne in a precarious position as it headed into what had become a do-or-die confrontation against unbeaten table-toppers Bohemians, in a game being screened by TV3 as its first \"live\" broadcast of National League football. The weather that night was horrendous and seemingly played its part in the first goal, when the referee considered a foul on Ollie Cahill to have occurred inside the area, despite the strong appeals from Bohemians' players that the offence had taken place outside, but that the rain had washed away the pitch-markings. Either way, there was no mistake by David Crawley with the penalty. One of the best games of the season ensued, with Wes Houlihan twice almost scoring with great individual efforts, while wave after wave of attacks by the home team were repelled by Steven Williams and his defence. Stephen Geoghegan then came on to finish a lovely counterattacking move, with Glen Crowe (who else?) giving the score-line some injury-time respectability for the league leaders.\n\nThe terrible weather was not finished meddling in Shelbourne's season though. After a month of persistent rain, the Tolka river finally burst its banks, producing the worst flooding in Drumcondra for over thirty years. Tolka Park was devastated, with the pitch submerged, and much damage done to the facilities beneath the stands. It was a grim moment that seemed to flatten even the most optimistic of Shelbourne patrons. Happily, though, the club proved to be made of stern stuff, and thanks to Bray Wanderers - which agreed to swap venues for the remaining two meetings between the sides - and the voluntary efforts of Shelbourne players, officials, and fans, as well as those of other clubs (particularly old rivals Shamrock Rovers), the Reds got back on their feet once more and were able to fulfil their remaining home fixtures.\n\nThe one bit of good news during this time was the call-up of Wesley Houlihan to the senior international side for the friendly game against Greece. Having only broken into the under-21 team this season and then having impressed with several good performances, Wes was asked by caretaker-manager Don Givens to provide cover on the bench for the senior team. Sadly, though, his cross-European excursion was not awarded with a first senior cap.\n\nWith all these off-the-field distractions going on, it seemed easy to forget the league title which Shelbourne was suddenly back in with a moderate chance of winning. However, a late away win against Bray was followed by another defeat in Turner's Cross and hopes of a late rally seemed to dim once more. Fortunately, Pat Fenlon had other ideas and his side produced its best form of the season to beat Derry twice, Pats, UCD and Shamrock Rovers in successive games without conceding a single goal. What is more, the win over Rovers effectively guaranteed Shelbourne a place in Europe next season.\n\nThings got even better when Bohemians could only manage a draw with Drogheda United and, almost out of nowhere, Shels suddenly had the chance of winning the league in its own hands, if it could win its four remaining games. However, having pulled itself right back into contention, Shelbourne immediately spurned the opportunity by only drawing with a highly-competitive Longford side. This result meant that Bohemians would be champions if they won in Tolka Park in the final meeting this season between the two sides.\n\nAfter a mostly dull and tense game, Bohemians at last brought their supporters to life when Bobby Ryan headed in a late, late winner to bring the title back to Dalymount Park. It was another unpleasant moment. At least, though, by the time the Reds next took to the field, they had been guaranteed runner's-up spot and a place in UEFA Cup next season. Perhaps this was just as well, as Drogheda threatened to make Shelbourne's end-of-season truly miserable by also pinching a 1-0 away win. Nevertheless, the Reds finished the season on a high note with a 3-1 win over Bray Wanderers in a game that was surprisingly competitive for a meeting of no consequence for either side. This result also ended Shelbourne's tortuous run of last-day games without a win.\n\nTo conclude this review, its worth remembering that old Irish seanfhocal:\n\nTús maith leath na h-oibre.\n\nA good start to this season would have made this quietly impressive Shelbourne side far more competitive in the league. On a more positive note, though, for new manager, Pat Fenlon, this season proved a good start to his new career. Now to complete the job and bring a league title to Tolka Park."
