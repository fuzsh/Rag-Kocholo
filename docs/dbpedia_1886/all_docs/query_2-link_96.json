        "text": "I love the color gray. Not only is it one of the best colors that complements my pink undertones, but it had been branded “the non-color of elegance” over the past year. And fortunately, it will continue to be popular for more cold seasons to come, according to Jason Wu’s collection in the Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week fall/winter show. The collection was accompanied with black and white minuscule details (more or less!)\n\nYou just can’t go wrong with black, white or anything in between, know what I mean?\n\nFollowing the grayscale religiously makes for effortlessly chic dressing every day, and with a structured piece or two (of notably contrasting textures and quality) in addition to a casual dark outfit, the transition from day to night or “flat to bold” could not be any easier.\n\nPersonally, I love sharp, masculine pieces, such as the oversized “boyfriend” sleeveless blazer or long structured vests. These items are perfect for adding slight refinement and seriousness to a slouchy T-shirt (like the one I wore today) and/or breaking up more free-flowing feminine looks.\n\nAlso, it is imperative to juxtapose different textures in order to make a statement with shades that are very close together. In this outfit in particular, I found the contrast from the microfiber suede of my heels against my leather pants and blazer to add just the right amount of dimension.\n\nIn the monochromatic scheme of dressing, each subtle contrariety makes all the difference!"
