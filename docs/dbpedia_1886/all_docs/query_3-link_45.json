You can announce which resources you need and what you are willing to trade for them. The other players can also make their own proposals and counter offers. Important: Players may only trade with the player whose turn it is. The other players may not trade among themselves.\n\nb) Maritime Trade\n\nYou can also trade without the other players! During your turn, you can always trade at 4:1 by putting 4 identical Resource Cards back in their stack and taking any 1 Resource Card of your choice for it. If you have a settlement or city on a harbor, you can trade with the bank more favorably: at either a 3:1 ratio or in special harbors (trading the resource type shown) at 2:1. Important: The 4:1 trade is always possible, even if you do not have a settlement on a harbor."
