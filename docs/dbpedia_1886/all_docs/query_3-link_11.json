In early settlements the deciding factors were natural site factors.\n\n​\n\nBuilding material , shelter, protection, water, wood, rivers and flat land are all examples of natural site factors. Create a mind map in your exercise books explaining why each of these natural factors would have been significant to early settlers.\n\nImagine you are an early settler (e.g. Roman) and you are looking for a place to live.\n\n1. Look at the images and write down the natural advantages (good site factors) and disadvantages (bad site factors).\n\n2. As a group decide and explain which site you would choose.\n\nWhat are different types of settlement?\n\nSettlement Function\n\nThe number of services that a settlement provides increases with settlement size.\n\nSmall settlements will only provide low-order services such as a post offices, doctors and newsagents. Large towns, cities and conurbations will provide low and high-order services such as leisure centres, chain stores and hospitals.\n\nLarger settlements and conurbations have a much larger sphere of influence than smaller ones. This means they attract people from a wider area because of the facilities they offer. Cities such as London have a global sphere of influence, whereas a small hamlet or village may only have a sphere of influence of a couple of kilometres.\n\nServices such as department stores selling high order goods have a higher threshold than those selling low order goods such as newsagents. This means they need a higher number of people to support them and make them profitable, therefore they will only be found in larger settlements. It also means that there are fewer big department stores than small newsagents.\n\n​The range of a service or product is the maximum distance people are prepared to travel to purchase it. The range of a newspaper is much lower than an item of furniture for example.\n\nSettlement Pattern\n\nA settlement pattern means the shape of a settlement. The shape of early settlements was usually influenced by the surrounding landscape.\n\nWhat makes a good location for a settlement?\n\nSite and Situation.\n\nThe location and growth of an settlement depended upon its site and situation. The site was the actual place where people decided to locate their settlement. This is the place where the settlement is located, eg on a hill or in a sheltered valley.\n\nGrowth of that settlement then depended upon its situation in relation to accessibility and availability of natural resources. This describes where the settlement is in relation to other settlements and the features of the surrounding area, eg is the settlement surrounded by forest or is it next to a large city?"
