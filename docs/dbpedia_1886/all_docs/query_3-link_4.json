        "text": "Community of any size, in which people live\n\nFor other uses, see Settlement.\n\nIn geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community of people living in a particular place. The complexity of a settlement can range from a minuscule number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by particular people. The process of settlement involves human migration.\n\nIn the field of geospatial predictive modeling, settlements are \"a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work\".[1]\n\nA settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woodlands, wind and water mills, manor houses, moats and churches.[2]\n\nAn unincorporated area is a related designation used in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest geographical evidence of a human settlement was Jebel Irhoud, where early modern human remains of eight individuals date back to the Middle Paleolithic around 300,000 years ago.\n\nThe oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000 BC at the Ohalo site (now underwater) near the edge of the Sea of Galilee. The Natufians built houses, also in the Levant, around 10,000 BC. Remains of settlements such as villages become much more common after the invention of agriculture, The oldest of them is Jarmo, located in Iraq.\n\nIn landscape history\n\n[edit]\n\nLandscape history studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are dispersed or nucleated. Urban morphology can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a settlement hierarchy. A settlement hierarchy can be used for classifying settlement all over the world, although a settlement called a \"town\" in one country might be a \"village\" in other countries; or a \"large town\" in some countries might be a \"city\" in others.\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nGeoscience Australia defines a populated place as \"a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons\".[3]\n\nThe Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia used the term localities for rural areas, while the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses the term \"urban centres/localities\" for urban areas.[citation needed]\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina uses the term \"populated place\" / \"settled place\" for rural (or urban as an administrative center of some Municipality/City), and \"Municipality\" and \"City\" for urban areas.\n\nBulgaria\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Canadian government uses the term \"populated place\" in the Atlas of Canada, but does not define it.[4] Statistics Canada uses the term localities for historically named locations.\n\nCroatia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian Bureau of Statistics records population in units called settlements (naselja).\n\nIndia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Census Commission of India has a special definition of census towns.\n\nIreland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Central Statistics Office (CSO) of the Republic of Ireland has had a special definition of census towns. From the 2022 census of Ireland, the CSO introduced an urban geography unit called \"Built Up Areas\" (BUAs).[5]\n\nPakistan\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Pakistan Bureau of Statistics records population in units of settlements called Tehsil – an administrative unit derived from the Mughal era.\n\nRussia\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are various types of inhabited localities in Russia.\n\nSweden\n\n[edit]\n\nStatistics Sweden uses the term localities (tätort) for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is urban areas.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK Department for Communities and Local Government uses the term \"urban settlement\" to denote an urban area when analysing census information.[6] The Registrar General for Scotland defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to population density and postcode areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.[7]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) has a Geographic Names Information System that defines three classes of human settlement:\n\nPopulated place − place or geographic area with clustered or scattered buildings and a permanent human population (city, settlement, town, village). A populated place is usually not incorporated and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding \"civil\" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.[8]\n\nCensus − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).[8]\n\nCivil − a political division formed for administrative purposes (borough, county, incorporated place, municipality, parish, town, township).[8]\n\nPopulated places may be specifically defined in the context of censuses and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as \"place\" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau or census-designated places.\n\nGeospatial modeling\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the field of geospatial predictive modeling, a settlement is \"a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work\".[1]\n\nThe Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The GHSL operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).\n\nAbandonment\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Abandoned village and Ghost town\n\nThe term \"Abandoned populated places\" is a Feature Designation Name in databases sourced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency[10] and GeoNames.[11]\n\nSometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a ghost town, and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.[citation needed]\n\nA town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAdministrative division – Territorial entity for administration purposes\n\nColony – Territory governed by another country\n\nHuman outpost – Human habitats located in environments inhospitable for humans\n\nInformal settlement – Housing outside of official government control, regulation, or protectionPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nList of Neolithic settlements\n\nLost city – Human settlement that has become uninhabited\n\nRequirements for permanent settlements – Transition from nomadic lifestyle to a society that remains in one place permanently\n\nSettlement geography\n\nUrban sprawl – Expansion of auto-oriented, low-density development in suburbs\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
