        "text": "Rural settlement: a residential area away from the city, in the countryside (with less than 10,000 residents)\n\nUrban settlement: a residential area such as a town, city or megacity\n\nRural settlements tend to have a lower population and fewer services than urban settlements.\n\nSettlement site and situation\n\nSite refers to the land on which a settlement is built.\n\nSituation refers to the relationship between a settlement and its surrounding area.\n\nA wet point site is a site along a supply of water in otherwise dry areas.\n\nA dry point site is a site in an elevated position where the surrounding land is wet.\n\nDefensive sites are sites that are easy to guard against enemies and are usually located on higher grounds. eg. Edinburgh\n\nMost settlements are located:\n\nin areas that provide flat or gently sloping, fertile land for farming\n\nat cross-roads or locations of trade\n\nin areas with a reliable fuel supply\n\nwhere the aspect provides shelter to the houses eg. on a north-facing slope as a protection against heavy storms from the south.\n\nSettlement patterns:\n\nLinear: houses are situated along a transport route, eg. a street or a river\n\nNucleated: houses are concentrated around one central feature, eg. a church\n\nDispersed: houses are scattered in no particular pattern\n\nCauses of settlement dispersion:\n\nMountainous areas, which are difficult for construction\n\nMainly land for farming\n\nVulnerable to extreme weather conditions or climate (eg. Arctic tundra)\n\nFew natural resources available\n\nSettlement hierarchy\n\nA settlement hierarchy can be used to portray the rank order (in terms of size, population and services) of settlements.\n\nThe larger a settlement, the fewer settlements there will be of its type. In other words, there are many villages, but few megacities.\n\nFactors that limit the size of settlements\n\nLimited availability of flat land\n\nInfertile land\n\nPoor communications and transport networks\n\nLack of job opportunities and employment\n\nFunctions of settlements\n\nOriginally, most settlements had only one distinct function- such as agriculture- but nowadays the majority of MEDC settlements has multiple functions. The most common settlement functions include:\n\nResidential: An area whose main purpose is to provide habitation to its people\n\nMarket town: A town or city that is primarily responsible or known for its commerce and trade\n\nTourist resort: An area whose main purpose is attracting the tourist industry and generating revenue from natural and physical attractions.\n\nAdministrative: A place that houses the administrative branch or government of a country or region\n\nSphere of influence\n\nSphere of influence is the area served by a settlement or service (ie. the area from which people come to access a service).\n\nRange refers to the maximum distance that consumers are willing to travel to obtain certain goods. Generally, people will travel farther for higher order (comparison) goods or specialised shops. People are also more willing to travel further for high quality products or cheaper offers. Still, the range is impacted by the availability of each service.\n\nThreshold population is the minimum population required to support a service. Higher order goods will have a higher threshold population than lower order goods.\n\nHigh order goods or comparison goods are bought less frequently and they are more expensive. Due to their higher cost, people tend to compare the prices. Examples of higher order goods include jewellry, dishwashers (or other costy household equipment)\n\nUrbanisation\n\nUrbanisation is the movement of an increasing percentage of the population into the urban areas.\n\nCauses of urbanisation\n\nRural to urban migration: People move from the countryside to the cities due to population pressure and a lack of resources in rural areas.\n\nIn LEDC’s infrastructure of cities is expanding faster than in the rural areas, thus attracting industrial investment and people seeking employment.\n\nPopulation increase is often higher in cities due to better health care facilities (lower death rates) and a younger population in cities.\n\nMore people work in secondary and tertiary industries, which are often found in urban areas\n\nCounterurbanisation\n\nCounter-urbanisation is the movement out of cities into rural areas. It is most common in MEDC’s.\n\nReasons for counterurbanisation\n\nLess crowded housing and larger availability of land, cheaper housing\n\nLess traffic congestion and exhaust fumes (air pollution)\n\nScenic beauty and increased tranquility\n\nLower crime rates/higher safety\n\nIncreased mobility allows people to commute for work\n\nEffects of counterurbanisation\n\nIncrease in housing prices due to high demand\n\nCar ownership reduces public transport, isolating the youth and the elderly\n\nTraffic congestion due to high car ownership and commuting\n\nMore dormitory villages as people commute to work in the city\n\nUrban land use patterns of LEDC’s and MEDC’s\n\nUrban land use models attempt to portray common patterns of how the land is used in cities. These models split cities into different functional zones, such as :\n\nThe CBD (or central business district): the commercial centre of the city that features shops and offices, tall buildings, little housing\n\nInner city: areas used for light manufacturing, poor quality housing, lower class residential area\n\nOuter city: better quality housing, middle class residential area\n\nSuburbs: best quality housing, high class residential\n\nThere are two main land use models:\n\nIn both MEDC’s and LEDC’s:\n\nthe CBD is located centrally and there are distinct zones of different quality housing\n\nindustry is close to transport links\n\nIn LEDC’s:\n\nHigher cost housing tends to be closer to the CBD than in MEDC’s\n\nLow quality housing tends to be further from the CBD than in MEDC’s\n\nThere may be squatter settlements\n\nProblems of urban areas\n\nDecline of the CBD of cities in MEDC’s due to congestion and poor accesibility, including a lack of parking spaces. Also, retailers may leave the CBD due to high rents, leading to empty derilict buildings. Furthermore, companies and administration may decentralise to the outskirts or suburbs.\n\nSolutions:\n\nIncrease pedestrianisation to reduce air and noise pollution from vehicles.\n\nImprove transport facilities such as underground railways to reduce congestion.\n\nIncentivise the development of shopping malls to prevent retailers from moving to greenfield or brownfield sites.\n\nHousing issues\n\nThe following housing issues may occur in urban areas:\n\nHousing shortages: not enough housing available to meet demand\n\nLow-quality housing: poor living conditions, such as lack of access to clean water, sanitation, electricity and space. Old properties in the city centre may also need to be renewed.\n\nAffordability of housing: housing may be hard to get by and local residents may not earn enough to pay high rents or purchase their own dwelling (e.g. due to excessive property prices and high demand thanks to immigration)\n\nSolutions:\n\nReplace old housing by blocks of flats or houses in the suburbs\n\nConstruct new towns where land is available.\n\nDecline of the transition zone (twilight zone) in MEDC’s due to derelict land, high rates of crime and social issues.\n\nSolutions:\n\nCity governments can encourage redevelopment\n\nTraffic congestion\n\nTraffic congestion often occurs in old city centres or areas not designed for mass (public) transport. It can be caused by the increased use of private cars, a large increase in commuters, and people passing through the city on their way to other places, as well as people visiting the CBD for tourism and entertainment.\n\nCongestion may result in delays for work and delivery of products, which may increase transport costs and cause companies to lose profits. Also, congestion can increase air pollution from exhaust fumes, thus contributing to global warming and the likelihood of acid rain. Photochemical smog may reduce visibility and cause breathing problems, especially for asthmatics.\n\nSolutions:\n\nImprove public transport facilities by constructing underground railways and creating designated bus lanes\n\nConstruct ring roads and roundabouts to reduce congestion from traffic lights\n\nEncourage park and ride schemes\n\nMake suburban services better to reduce the need to commute into city centres\n\nEncourage working from home to reduce commuter traffic\n\nLack of Security in MEDC’s and LEDC’s may lead to high crime rates and graffiti.\n\nSolutions:\n\nIncrease patrols by police or private security firms\n\nInstall closed circuit TV to scare away pick pockets and shop lifters\n\nCrime and racial conflicts in MEDC’s and LEDC’s due to high levels of poverty, inner city ghettos (MEDC’s) or informal settlements (LEDC’s).\n\nSolutions:\n\nProvide social facilities such as sports clubs\n\nEncourage job creation schemes to provide employment\n\nProvide language lessons to immigrants\n\nSquatter settlements\n\nSquatter settlements are a type of slum housing often located in the outer city areas of less developed countries (LEDCs). Squatter settlements can face the following issues:\n\nResidents typically do not have a legal right to occupy the land, so could be evicted any time\n\nHouses may not be weatherproof\n\nLack of sanitation and quality water supply -> this can lead to disease outbreak (e.g. cholera)\n\nNo refuse collection\n\nPoverty and unemployment\n\nExtreme overcrowding\n\nLong commuting times into the city centre, worsened by lack of public transport\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nLow-cost housing schemes, including flexible loans and subsidies for home building\n\nProvision of water, electricity and sewerage systems\n\nConstruction of health and educational services\n\nSupport for the informal sector and local businesses\n\nConflicts over land use change\n\nLand use in urban areas may change over time. For example, old industrial zones may be converted into a residential areas, or commercial activities may displace housing.\n\nLand use change may occur thanks to:\n\nUrban planning: the city council introduces new policies to change how land should be used and which activities are permitted in different zones throughout the city\n\nCompetitive demand/market factors: Commercial activities may displace lower-income residents from increasingly desirable locations if they can afford and are willing to pay more for owning and/or using the land.\n\nRedevelopment: Attempts may be made to use old, run-down urban areas more effectively than before, for example by investing in new transport infrastructure and local services and facilities.\n\nLand use changes can lead to conflicts when one type of land use negatively impacts another, or when disagreement over land use policies arises.\n\nFor example, residents may complain about the noise and gases from nearby factories, or the fact that the construction of anew main road has led to increasing traffic congestion and air pollution.\n\nIn suburban areas, primarily on the outskirts of a city, complaints about noise and odour from agricultural activities are also common."
