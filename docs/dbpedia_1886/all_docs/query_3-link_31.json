        "text": "Amenities: These may be within the home, in which case they refer to baths, toilets (w.c.'s), hot water etc., or outside people's homes in which case they would include parks, shops, public transport provision, etc..\n\nBreak of Bulk Point: the place where goods have to be unloaded e.g. a port.\n\nBridging Point: a settlement site where a river is narrow or shallow enough to be bridged. The bridge becomes a route centre and trading centre, the natural location for a market. It is also a good defensive site. The lowest bridging point on a river is the bridge nearest to the sea; this site is ideal for a river port settlement.\n\nBrownfield land: urban land that has previously been developed, such as a the site of a demolished building or factory.\n\nBurgess Model: an urban land use model showing five concentric zones, based upon age of houses and wealth of their inhabitants. (See concentric ring model).\n\nBy-pass: A road built around a busy urban area to avoid traffic jams.\n\nCBD: Central Business District or city centre; the commercial and business centre ot a town or city where land values are at the highest. This is the most accessible part of the town or city. High land values lead to intensive use of the land and buildings are built as high as possible to maximise office space and therefore rental income.\n\nCentral Place: any settlement that provides goods and services for smaller neighbouring settlements.\n\nCity: cities are urban places. They are usually large (more than 20,000 people) and are economically self- sufficient (unlike a large dormitory or suburban town).\n\nClustered Settlement Pattern: a settlement where buildings are clustered around a particular point.\n\nCommuting: the process by which people living in one place, travel to another place to work.\n\nComparison Goods/Services: these are high-order (usually expensive) goods such as antiques, jewellery, and some clothing and electrical equipment. They are called comparison goods because people like to compare prices, quality and other features before buying them. Comparison goods are usually sold in shops in city centres or large out-of-town shopping centres. People visit comparison shops only occasionally so they need a large market area.\n\nComprehensive Redevelopment: an area, usually in the inner city, where the whole urban landscape was demolished before being rebuilt on a planned basis by the council or city government.\n\nConcentric Ring Model: see Burgess model.\n\nCongestion: overcrowding on roads causing traffic jams.\n\nConsumer: these are people. As trade in goods and services increases, the power of the consumer increases. Industries must create what people want (or think they need).\n\nConurbation: a large urban settlement which is the result of towns and cities spreading out and merging together.\n\nConvenience Goods/Services: these are low/order goods - inexpensive things that vary little in price, quality or other features that we need to buy regularly e.g. newspapers, cigarettes and bread. Convenience shops are found on most street corners where they have a small market area of people who visit the shop on most days.\n\nCorner Shop a shop typical of the inner city zone (but also common in all zones except the CBD) found on every street corner, selling a range of every-day needs. (See convenience goods and low-order goods/services).\n\nCounterurbanisation: The movement of people from the MEDC cities to the countryside seeking a better quality of life. Many still commute into the city to work, but increasing numbers are moving to completely change their lifestyle and work in the rural area, often by teleworking.\n\nCycle of Deprivation: a sequence of events experienced by disadvantaged people in which one problem e.g. lack of work, leads to other problems and so makes things worse.\n\nDefensive Site: a settlement which usually grew at or around a fort or castle on top of a hill, although river meander bends, bridges, dry-point sites and coastal sites with cliffs were also good for defence.\n\nDemand: the willingness and ability of consumers to pay for a particular good or service; As long as the supply of goods and services meets the demand, prices remain the same (stable). High demand for land in the CBD from businesses wishing to locate there results in very high land values because supply cannot be increased to meet the demand.\n\nDependant person: This is either a dependant child, or a person with long-term sickness preventing him/her from working.\n\nDeprivation: The degree to which an individual or an area is deprived of services and amenities. There are many different types and levels of deprivation included poor and overcrowded housing, inadequate diet, inadequate income and lack of opportunity for employment.\n\nDerelict: abandoned buildings and wasteland.\n\nDetached house: a house standing alone (not joined to another) typical of the wealthy suburb zone of a city.

The 'improving' social group changes attract more people of the similar wealthier social group.\n\nGreen Belt: An area around a city, composed mostly of parkland and farmland, in which development is strictly controlled. Its purpose is to prevent the outward growth of the city, preserve countryside for farming, wildlife and recreation, and, often to prevent two or more cities from merging to form one huge urban area.\n\nGreenfield land: a term used to describe a piece of undeveloped rural land, either currently used for agriculture or just left to nature.\n\nHectare: this is an area equivalent to 2.471 acres.\n\nHierarchy: a ranking of settlements or shopping centres according to their population size or the number of services they provide.\n\nHigh-order goods/services: a good or service, usually expensive, that people buy only occasionally e.g. furniture, computers and jewellery.

It benefits from cheap land and the new trend to shopping by car, with large carparks to cater for this. Prices are kept low by the supermarket buying in bulk which enables it to negotiate the lowest possible prices from its suppliers.\n\nIndustrial Revolution: the growth and development of manufacturing industry and the factory system which began in the UK in the eighteenth century.\n\nInformal Sector: casual, irregular work, e.g. street selling.\n\nInner City: the part of the urban area surrounding the CBD; it often contains older housing and industry, in a state of poor repair and dereliction (See urban redevelopment and urban renewal).\n\nLinear Settlement: a settlement which follows the line of, for example, a road or river.\n\nLoose-Knit Settlement: a settlement with many gaps between its buildings and little, if any, pattern. (See dispersed settlement pattern).\n\nLow-order Goods/Services: a good or service, usually inexpensive, that people buy on a regular, often daily daily basis - for example, newspapers, bread and milk. Low-order goods and services are usually purchased from shops located in suburban or neighbourhood centres close to where people live.

Some form of redevelopment is often required to start re-urbanisation.\n\nRibbon development: when housing grows out from a town along a main road.\n\nRing-road: a by-pass that provides a route around the CBD.\n\nRoute Centre: a settlement located at the meeting point of several roads/railways; the meeting point of two or more river valleys (which provide good road and rail routes through high land), is often the location of a route-centre settlement. Bridging points, ports and gap towns are also natural route centres.\n\nRural-Urban Fringe: a zone of transition between the built-up area and the countryside, where there is often competition for land use. It is a zone of mixed land uses, from shopping malls and golf courses to farmland and motorways.\n\nSecond Homes: homes purchased by city dwellers in country villages or areas of usually great natural beauty for holiday or weekend use only. These create problems for local communities since house prices in the area of second homes rise out of the reach of young people, and shops, schools and bus services are forced to close due to lack of customers. The newcomers also bring unwanted social changes to the villages.\n\nSector Model: see Hoyt model.\n\nSelf-help Housing Schemes: groups of people, especially in LEDCs, are encouraged to build their own homes, using materials provided by the local authority.\n\nSemi-detached house: a house joined to one other.

Spontaneous settlements are very common in cities in LEDCs and are illegal because the residents neither own the land on which the houses are built, nor have permission to build there.\n\nSquatter Settlement: another name for a spontaneous settlement.\n\nSuburbs: the outer zone of towns and cities.\n\nSuburbanisation: the process by which people, factories, offices and shops move out from the central areas of cities and into the suburbs.\n\nSuburbanised Villages/Towns: dormitory or commuter villages/towns with a residential population who sleep in the village/town but who travel to work in the nearby large urban area. The suburbanised village has increasingly adopted some of the characteristics (new housing estates, more services) of urban areas.\n\nTeleworking: working from home using telecommunications.\n\nTenant: a person who rents his/her home from a private landlord or the local council.\n\nTenure: the way in which property is held.
