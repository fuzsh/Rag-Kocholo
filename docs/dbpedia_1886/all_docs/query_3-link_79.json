        "text": "“Where do you live? Kota Kinabalu, London, Tokyo, New York? They’re all settlements – it just means a place you live and settle!”\n\nClick on the following link to download the revision checklist for this topic\n\nChecklist for revision\n\nSettlements can be big or small, urban or rural. They can range in size from;\n\nOne isolated house…\n\nAll the way up to a large capital city\n\nA rural settlement = a settlement found in the countryside such as a village or hamlet\n\nAn urban settlement = a built up settlement such as a town or city\n\nWhen we put settlement types into a specific order, this can be called a Settlement Hierarchy.It is based on their size, importance and number and range of services you find there.\n\nAs you move up a settlement hierarchy, the size of the settlement increases. The frequency of the settlements decreases as you move up the hierarchy, for example, there are less cities than villages.\n\nThere is also an increase in the amount and type of services provided.\n\nServices can be divided into two groups\n\n1) Low order services–\n\nServices which need a small population to support them They are usually in large numbers and are found in most settlements. They will be used frequently. Examples are general stores, local primary school and a post office.\n\n2) High order services-\n\nServices which need a large population to support them. There are less of these and they are often only found in larger settlements . Examples are big department stores and universities.\n\nThe maximum distance that a person is willing to travel to use a particular service or good is called the range of a good.\n\nThe area around a settlement that people will travel from to use the services in that settlement is called the sphere of influence.\n\nPeople will travel much further to visit a larger settlement like a city to use their services or buy certain items, as they often only available in larger settlements. Whereas in smaller settlements the types of services and goods can be found everywhere , so not many people would travel to a smaller settlement to use their services.\n\nSettlement patterns\n\nWhen you look at a rural settlement from above they have different shapes/patterns. There are three common patterns.\n\n1) Nucleated- these are settlements where buildings are grouped together around a central area.\n\n– initially for defence\n\n– now for social and economic reasons\n\n2) Linear- these are settlements where buildings are grouped in a line . They developed normally along a road (access), a river valley (flat land and water supply)\n\n3) Dispersed- These are settlements where there is only one isolated building or a group or 2 or 3 buildings dotted around. They occur in areas of physical difficulty with few natural resources.\n\nSettlement site and situation\n\nThe land on which a settlement is located is called its SITE\n\nSITUATION describes what the area around a settlement site is like . A situation can be good if it has good surrounding features (e.g. rivers, the sea, resources, other settlements)\n\nKota Kinabalu was created on this site due to its good SITUATION.\n\nWhat did original settlers look for in a settlement site?\n\nEarly settlers had to be fairly self sufficient within their chosen settlement as transport was not always easy and there was no supermarket down the road or tapped water and electricity! They had to make sure their settlement site and situation provided most of what they needed, including the following…\n\n1) Building materials– including stone, wood and clay. They would be too heavy to move from a far location as transport was not very good.\n\n2) A fuel supply- This was needed for heating and cooking. Normally it was wood.\n\n3) Food supplies- Needed land nearby their settlement which was suitable for the rearing of animals ( grazing land) or growing crops.\n\n4) A water supply- Needed to be near a spring or river in order to supply essential water for drinkning, cooking and washing.\n\n5) Dry point site- In a relatively wet area, settlers had to make sure they were above flooding levels and away from marshy areas.\n\n6) Defence- Often settlers needed to defend themselves against surrounding tribes. Good defensive sites would be on a steep hill side so they could see all around.\n\nLook at the map below of Longtown- What could you suggest as the reasons for the original settlers choice of this site?\n\nIt is important to remember that in the modern world, many of these factors are no longer important when considering the site for the new settlement. Most settlements will have piped water, electricty and gas as their fuel, and shops providing food!\n\nSettlement Function\n\nA settlement’s functions are the main activities existing within a settlement that relate to its economy and social development (E.G. TOURISM)\n\nSettlements normally have a number of functions but one may be more important than the others.\n\nSome common settlement functions are defined below with a real life example of a settlement next to them.\n\nMarket Town = Originally served as a settlement where farmers buy and sell goods from their farms in the surrounding area. – RANAU/ WINNIPEG\n\nPort = Located on coasts, rivers and lakes for the movement of goods and people from land to sea. SOUTHAMPTON/ KOTA KINABALU\n\nIndustrial Town = A settlement where raw materials are processed into manufactured goods, normally in factories. BIRMINGHAM\n\nTourist Resorts = A settlement where the many tourists visit on their holidays, normally in an attractive coastal or mountain location. KOTA KINABALU/ SEMINYAK\n\nResidential = A settlement that is mainly made up of housing and a few shops. The majority of residents live but do not work in this settlement.\n\nCommercial = A settlement that contains a large number of businesses. NEW YORK / LONDON\n\nCultural/ Religious = A settlement that attracts people for educational or religious reasons. MECCA /ROME\n\nHow can you recognise settlement function on a map?\n\nUse the flow chart to work out the settlement function of the settlement shown in the map extract below.\n\nUrban land use models- is there a pattern to how land is used across certain settlements?\n\nUrban = Cities and towns\n\nLand use = is what land is used for (e.g. housing)\n\nA model = a theoretical diagram which helps to explain reality. It is not always exactly like real life, but suggests a pattern\n\nSo an Urban land use model is a theoretical picture which suggests where you might find land use within a cities and towns.\n\nThere are three urban land use models that you should know\n\n1) Burgess’s Model- Based on Chicago- An MEDC urban land use model\n\nBurgess suggested that even though all cities are unique , they tend to grow and develop outwards in a similar way. He suggested the following layout was common in many MEDC cities.\n\nThe CBD- This is the central business district where most shops, banks and offices are found. It would normally be found in the centre of a city, as this the most accessible part of town. It can therefore be reached by everyone in the surrounding city. Land prices are high here and therefore often buildings are high rise to maximise their land. They are often congested with pedestrians and traffic\n\nFactories/Industry\n\nDuring the industrial revolution in some MEDCs like the USA and the UK, large factories were built around the centre of a city where there was enough space for them. Industry was often located beside rivers and canals for transport and water use. Often in the modern day, these factories have been forced to close due to lack of space for expansion and some have now moved out of the city\n\nLow class residential (inner city housing)\n\nAs industry grew around the CBD, there was a need for workers. Lots of people moved from the rural areas to the cities to work in the factories and they needed low cost housing. At that time there was little public or private transport so they also needed to be close to the factories. Low class terraced housing was therefore built surrounding the industry. It was high density (packed in) and often lacked indoor bathrooms or electricity. Living conditions were often not good. In recent times people have improved this housing (urban renewal).\n\nMiddle class residential (inter war period)\n\nBetween the two world wars (1920’s-1930’s) urban areas grew rapidly. This was because public transport like buses and trains were introduced and there was an increase in private cars. This meant people could work in the CBD but live further out of the city. Middle class housing therefore developed around the inner city areas. These houses were often semi-detached and had gardens at the front and back. As the new housing was further away from the shops of the CBD, often these areas of housing had their own little shopping parades and some park areas.\n\nHigh class residential (Modern Suburbs)\n\nAs cities have expanded further (urban sprawl) in modern times, larger, detached housing has been built on the land furthest from the CBD, where there is space for it stretching out to the rural-urban fringe. These houses were ofnte built with large gardens, garages and tree lined roads. These areas on the edge of a city are know as the suburbs and people will live here and commute into the city.\n\n2) Hoyt’s Sector Model- – An more recent MEDC urban land use model\n\nHoyt took Burgess’s model which was created earlier and adapted it after the creation of large scale public transport. He suggested that urban areas developed in wedges, alongside main transport routes into and out of a city. Industry would want to locate along a main transport route to bring materials in and out of their factories, and high class housing may develop along a key commuter route.\n\n3) Urban land use model for an LEDC city\n\nThe first two models only really apply in MEDC cities. More recently a model has been created to try to explain the pattern of land use in a typical LEDC city.\n\nIt is different to the other two models as it has\n\n– High class residential closer to the CBD\n\n– The quality of housing decrease as you move out from the CBD as many people are forced to live in shanty towns on the edge of a city\n\nUrbanisation\n\nUrbanisationis an increase in the proportion of people living in towns and cities\n\nIn 1800 = 3% of people lived in towns or cities\n\nIn 1950 = 29% of people lived in towns or cities\n\nIn 2008 = 50% of people lived in towns or cities\n\nIn 2012 = 54% of people lived in towns or cities !\n\nUrbanisation has meant that cities are often growing in size\n\nThe world’s top five largest cities are shown below\n\n1) Tokyo, Japan = 35.2 million\n\n2) Mexico City, Mexico = 18.7 million\n\n3) New York, USA = 18.6 million\n\n4) Sao Paulo, Brazil; = 18.3 million\n\n5) Mumbai, India = 18.2 million\n\nSome key questions to consider about urbanisation are listed below- Have a look at them and their answers.\n\nWhere are the most urbanised countries in the world?\n\nContinents which are highly urbanised are North America, South America, Europe and Oceania\n\nAfrica is the least urbanised continent currently. However, it has the fastest rate of urban growth so this may well change in the future!\n\nWhat are million and mega cities and where are most located?\n\nMillion cities are cities which have over a million residents\n\nMega cities are cities which have over 10 million cities\n\nPrior to 1950 most of the million cities were found in Europe and North America. However, there has been an increase in million cities in LEDCs in Asia, South America and Africa.\n\nWhat has happened to city growth in MEDCs and LEDCs?\n\nSince the 1970s city growth in MEDCs has slowed down, but city growth in LEDCs in Asia, Africa and South America has increased.\n\nWhich continents have the world’s largest cities and how has this changed since 1970?\n\nIn the 1970s most of the world’s largest cities were in North America and Europe. Now they are in Asia and South America!\n\nEffects of urbanisation on the environment and people- A set of mini case studies\n\nCould you answer this exam question?\n\nUsing named examples, which you have studied where urbanisation has taken place.\n\nDescribe its effects on people and the natural environment (8m)\n\nIf not look at some of the effects of urbanisation on people and the environment shown below and make sure you understand why each occurs.\n\n1) Air pollution from road traffic in Mexico city- as a city grows, the number of cars increases. This leads to extra gases being released such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which causes air pollution.\n\n2) Air and water pollution from industry in Osaka , Japan- as a city grows, the number of industries, factories and power stations increase. This leads to extra gases being released such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which causes air pollution. Oil spilled from ships, pollutes the water of Osaka Bay\n\n3) Water pollution from waste dumped at sea in Kota Kinabalu- as the city has grown, new migrants have built houses on stilts in the water villages. The city council does not provide rubbish collection for them, so any waste in dumped straight into the water.\n\n4)Traffic congestion from cars in Kuala Lumpur- as a city grows, more people arrive with vehicle, this leads to roads becoming busy, particular at peak commuting times (morning and early evening).\n\n5) Noise pollution- Rio de Janiero- as a city grows, the number of cars increases and their is high density housing with many people packed into small areas. This can lead to noise pollution.\n\n6) Urban Sprawl- Paris- if a city is allowed to expand outwards and the growth is uncontrolled, this is known as urban sprawl. The city begins to take over the surrounding rural areas as it spreads.\n\n7) Housing shortages in Mumbai- in Mumbai, urbanisation is caused by many migrants moving from the rural areas to the city. This leads to housing shortages as there are not enough houses for them, or they can afford the houses available. This often leads to the development of shanty towns.\n\nKEY TERM HELP- the terms shanty town, squatter settlement, slum and favela all mean the same thing! They are areas housing built by people themselves out of material they can find, often around the edge of LEDC cities. They are often illegally built and can have no sanitation, water or electricity connection.\n\n8) High land prices in the city centre- Hong Kong. As Hong Kong has grown and more people have wanted to live there, this has led to there being a lot of competition for property in the centre of Hong Kong. This competition means people can charge more for housing, therefore making prices higher.\n\nProblems in LEDC cities- Kibera Slum- Nairobi, Kenya\n\nNairobi is Kenya’s capital city. Just like in other LEDCs, rural to urban migration has led to many migrants turning up in the city every day. When new migrants from rural areas turn up in Nairobi, they can not afford housing in the city centre (there is an affordable housing shortage). So they build their own housing on the outskirts of Nairobi. This has developed into a slum/shanty town called Kibera. It is Africa’s 2nd largest slum.\n\nDescription of Kibera Problems in Kibera Positives in Kibera 1 million people live on one square mile of land\n\nVery densely populated\n\nAverage size of a shack is 12ft x 12ft- often shared by 8 people\n\nToilets are shared between 50 shacks\n\nNo government hospitals- only charities clinics\n\nNo government schools- only charity run schools\n\nOnly 20% of the shacks have electricity\n\nOnly two main water taps shared between the whole of the shanty town\n\nMedication is too expensive for most residents\n\nDiseases such as typhoid and cholera spread through dirty water\n\nNo rubbish collection\n\nHigh unemployment\n\nMany women are forced to work as either prostitutes or cleaners for richer residents\n\nCrime, drug abuse and rape are common place\n\nOften good community spirit between neighboursPeople are often incredibly resourceful and use waste which would otherwise be thrown away to create housing, and items to sell\n\nLEDC cities: Improving squatter settlements/shanty towns/slums\n\nYou worked in class to improve an imaginary shanty town called Ariba. Even though it was not a real place, the improvements you made are all real possibilities and have been done in the real world to existing shanty towns.\n\nLook below at how improvements have been made to shanty towns in Sao Paulo in Brazil\n\nSome ideas on how shanty towns can be improved from Sao Paulo and Kibera.\n\n1) Low cost improvements given by either the government or charities\n\n– Sewage networks or community taps can be placed across the shanty town\n\n– Roads can be concreted to allow for better transport\n\n– Rubbish disposal can be arranged\n\n– Water tanks can be provided for each house\n\n– Breeze blocks can be used to rebuild some houses to make them stronger\n\n– Electricity connections can be added\n\n– Set up weekly/monthly health clinics\n\n2) Self help schemes\n\nSometimes charities or governments will give resources to residents of the shanty town to make improvements to buildings themselves. These are called self help schemes\n\n– Provide building materials for houses (concrete and wood)\n\n– Provide tools to allow construction to take place.\n\nSolutions to MEDC city problems.\n\nAs you may have read above. Urban sprawl and traffic congestion can be two major problems in MEDC cities. In the UK they have tried to solve these two problems.\n\nUrban sprawl- London and other UK cities were spreading out into the countryside\n\nSolution to Urban Sprawl: Greenbelts\n\nIn 1947 the UK government set up green belts. These are areas of green land (countryside) surrounding a city which is protected. This means you can only build or develop it with special permission from the UK government. The idea is to stop the city growing outwards. The UK government created 14 green belts around some of its major cities. Sometimes greenbelts have been built on where local government councils have allowed people to develop on them, however, mostly the designation has worked.\n\nTraffic congestion occurs in London like other MEDC cities\n\nSolution to traffic congestion: The Congestion Charge\n\nThis scheme was introduced in London in 2003. It was introduced because road vehicles were responsible for 66% of London’s air pollution. All vehicles (cars, lorries etc) have to pay an 8 pound charge (40rm) to enter the centre of London. The idea was to put people off driving into the centre. It has reduced traffic by 21% in the central zone and there has been a 45% rise in cyclists and bus passengers. However, the owners of many businesses who must transport goods around the capital are annoyed it reduces their profits"
