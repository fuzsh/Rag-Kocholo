        "text": "Objective: To be able to explain how physical factors (relief, soil, water supply) and other factors such as accessibility, agricultural land-use, influence the sites and patterns of settlements.\n\nSettlement - A place where people live. A settlement can range from one isolated building to a capital city with over 20 million people like Mexico City.\n\nSettlement Site - The site of a settlement is the land upon which it was built. There is a range of human and physical factors that determine the site of a settlement.\n\n​\n\nSettlement Situation - The situation of a settlement is its location in relation to surrounding human and physical features. We usually describe the situation when we are telling someone where a settlement is.\n\nStarter: Watch the Human Planet BBC video to the right. This shows people living in areas that are right on the limit of what we can survive. What factors stop people from living in certain places?\n\n​\n\nTask 1 - Settlement site & situation - Click on the tab below to access your worksheet. Complete the activities set out before printing out for your folders.\n\n​Task 2 - Settlement Situations & Changing Functions\n\n​\n\nSettlement function (what it does) may change over time. Using Google Street View for the settlements in task 1 (Conwy, Toulouse, Chesterfield Inlet & your home town), visit each place and look for evidence of the following ways that functions can change:\n\n​\n\nShopping (Retail)\n\nBusiness (Commercial)\n\nFarming (Agricultural)\n\nHousing (Residential)\n\nEducational\n\nHealthcare\n\nAdministration (local or national government)\n\nFishing\n\nTourism\n\nEntertainment\n\nSporting\n\nAnnotate on any changes in function that you can see to your photos using a different colour.\n\nTask 2 - Use the second side of the worksheet from Task 1.\n\nComplete the activities on the sheet by using the resources below.\n\nSettlement Definitions.\n\nIsolated Place - Just one dwelling surrounded by countryside.\n\nHamlet - Perhaps a phone and a few houses.\n\nVillage - Village shop, church, post office.\n\nSmall Town - primary school, supermarket, library, bank, hotel\n\nLarge Town - Shopping centre, secondary school, college, cinema, sports centre,\n\nCity - Primark and other department stores, cathedral, university, football and rugby stadiums, airport.\n\nConurbation - A city that has expanded into the surrounding towns (urban sprawl) and is now one big settlement under one name.\n\nPibrac Population 8000\n\nGrande Toulouse Population 1,200,000\n\nTask 3 - Click on the blue tab above to access the Google Map and study the location of each of the settlements above.\n\ni. Look carefully at the communication routes through each type of settlement (roads, railways and metro (underground) stations.\n\nii. Complete a piece of writing to complement your worksheet in task 2. Your questions is:\n\nCan you find a link between the size of a settlement and:\n\n** the number of roads and railways and other forms of transportation.\n\n** the shape of the land (relief)\n\n​\n\n** proximity of other settlements."
