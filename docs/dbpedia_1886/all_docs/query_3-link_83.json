        "text": "The settlement largely dependent on primary sector activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing etc. is known as rural settlement.\n\nMajor factors that shape the rural settlement are water supply, fertile lands, relief features, building materials, etc.\n\nOn the basis of forms or shapes of the settlements, rural settlements are classified as −\n\nLinear,\n\nRectangular,\n\nCircular,\n\nStar like,\n\nT-shaped village,\n\nY-shaped village,\n\nCompact,\n\nDisperse,\n\nPlanned, etc.\n\nThe settlement in which houses are constructed along a road, railway line, river, canal edge of a valley, or along a levee is known as Linear Pattern.\n\nThe settlements in which houses are constructed in a rectangular shape is known as Rectangular Pattern. Such kind of settlements is found in plain areas or/and in wide inter-montane valley.\n\nThe settlements in which houses are constructed in a circular shape is known as Circular Pattern. Such kind of settlements is found around lakes, tanks, or a planned village.\n\nThe settlements in which houses are constructed in a star shape is known as Star like Pattern. Such kind of settlements is found around the points where several roads cross each other (making star shape).\n\nThe settlements in which houses are constructed at the tri-junctions of the roads is known as T-shaped Pattern. Such kind of settlements is found along the road, which meets with another road at the dead end (the straight going road ends) and bifurcates left and right (T-Shape).\n\nThe settlement in which houses are constructed along the straight going road, which further bifurcates into two roads (similar to Y shape) is known as Y-Shape pattern.\n\nBased on shape, the settlements are classified as −\n\nCompact or Nucleated Settlements − Under such type of settlements, the houses are built very close to each other. Normally, plain fertile land regions have such compact or nucleated settlements.\n\nDispersed Settlements − In such kind of settlements, houses are spaced far apart and often interspersed with fields; however, their market and some other activities are centralized where they participate together.\n\nPlanned settlements are the settlements that planned and constructed by the government; governments provides shelter, water, and other infrastructures on acquired lands.\n\nDepending upon the functionality of the urban settlement, towns are classified as −\n\nAdministrative Towns,\n\nCommercial Towns,\n\nCultural Towns,\n\nRecreational Towns, and\n\nIndustrial Towns.\n\nThe settlements that established for the administrative purpose or having largely administrative function are known as administrative towns. For example, such as Washington D.C., New Delhi, Canberra, Paris, Beijing, Addis Ababa, and London etc.\n\nThe settlements that facilitate commercial opportunities are known as trading and commercial towns. For example, Agra, Lahore, Baghdad as an important transport node; Manchester and St Louis in land centers; Winnipeg and Kansas City as agricultural market towns; Frankfurt and Amsterdam as banking and financial centers; etc.\n\nThe settlements established because of religious adherence are known as cultural or religious towns. For example, Jerusalem, Mecca, Jagannath Puri, Madurai, and Varanasi etc.\n\nThe settlements established for the recreational purpose are known as recreational towns. For example, Miami, Panaji, etc.\n\nThe settlements established because of industrial development are known as industrial towns. For example, Pittsburgh, Jamshedpur, etc."
