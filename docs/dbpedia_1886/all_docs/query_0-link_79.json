        "text": "Blog from Karen Johnson\n\nFeb19\n\nHow do you capture in words the effects of five days in a foreign country, even though it is in a setting you are familiar with? This mission to Kalibo was my first trip to Asia and will be a high point in my life. Emotionally, it has been rewarding and soul-searching. Seeing the children and knowing we are giving them a chance of a healthier life is the greatest gift of all. Walking the halls of the hospital has been surreal at times and difficult to process. By day three, the sights and sounds no longer stood out. You just want to get done what has to be done in the short time you are here. I hope I have helped these families through this challenging and exciting time. They have given much more to me than they will ever know.\n\nFinal Thoughts from Our Volunteers\n\nFeb14\n\nHere is a collection of thoughts from a few members of the Mending Faces volunteers from the 2014 trip to Kalibo:\n\nIt was a difficult job working in recovery op ward. After we started an intervene line, the child was dressed for surgery. This is one of the most intense jobs I have ever had. It’s very rewarding. I couldn’t wait to see him in post op - from Kerry Ariana, RN\n\nThe kids in the post op ward were scared of the blue scrubs, but I had a secret weapon – a teddy bear. Once I smiled and shook the bear the child smiled and laughed. It was magical, moving and powerful – from Kerry Arellano, RN\n\nI came in to the ward with the photos of post and pre op. The child ran to my arms grabbed the picture and did a dance – she was so happy! As I teared up she came over and hugged me. In a rare moment she let me hold her. It was awesome – from Tony Thirodopolous\n\nI helped release a family from the post op ward and they needed help carrying the fan they had brought from home. I walked with them to the exit and I realized they had brought the contents of their entire house and they were taking a tuk tuk home. I helped them load the gear and the mom started crying, and hugging me. They were so thankful as I was to be a part of it!- from Scott Angus\n\nI was so happy to be part of the process of giving pre and post op photos. It was so emotional, I teared up as the mother of the child thanked us for our work – from Cathy McNamara\n\nThe kids are amazing. What a powerful experience – from Barbara Allen, MD\n\nLocal Outreach in Kalibo – Dental Education Program\n\nFeb14\n\nBy Cathy McNamara\n\nThe school we visited for one of our dental education programs was also a recipient of a rotary donation to repair the roof that had been torn off due to typhoon Yolanda back in November. Our visit also coincided with the special dedication of the new water treatment facility and school reconstruction. The school was a small rural school in a poor part of the province that I am sure no white people had ever visited before. The children had nothing in their classrooms, but their desks, and not a single thing on the walls. It was a blank environment void of any bright or child centered decorations. It broke my heart to see that these teachers had no materials to enrich their learning environment whatsoever. Luckily, we had brought three bags of art supplies ranging from scissors, bright paper, glitter, glue, markers and the big boxes of crayons, etc. The kids seemed delighted when we sat down and drew pictures of cats, dogs and flowers. Though it felt good to be able to add something fun to their day, I also felt sad knowing they still need so much more.\n\nMothers by Usha Barry – Day 2 in Kalibo\n\nFeb12\n\nSometimes small things can shift your perspective powerfully. That is what happened to me here on Day 2 in Kalibo. I spent the early part of the day distracted by an issue with my return airline ticket to the U.S.A. Then, late in the afternoon as I brought a five-year old boy into the recovery room after his cleft lip repair, his mother handed me the following note:\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nThank you very much for the time, effort and kindness you gave to us. This day will always be remembered as my son lives with us, his whole face is the proof of your generosity. Thank you very much for giving him the chance as a new and a whole person ready to face for his more brighter future.\n\nOnce again thank you very much and God Bless!!!\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMorlie M. Acain\n\n(Mother of Feolo Isaac M. Acain)\n\nI read the words, looked up to see her tear-filled, smiling face watching me, and I was immediately brought back into the moment – all thoughts of paperwork hassles and plane tickets pushed aside. Although I know that the “Doctor” she addresses is really a whole team of people (nurses, surgical assistants, physicians and support volunteers), I was grateful to be the one who was handed that letter. I really needed the shift in focus. For the first time that day, I stopped and took a really good look around… This is what I saw:\n\nEverywhere, mothers – caring, worrying, praying, happy, relieved, hoping, and sharing the pain of their children. Not to discredit the fathers, but today I looked up and saw only mothers. So, thank you mothers for reminding me why we do this and what it means. This blog is for you.\n\nAnd BTW, Happy Valentine’s Day, Mom!\n\nJawili School Visit – by Marc Grauberger\n\nFeb11\n\nA team of eight Mending Faces Outreach volunteers had the privilege of visiting Jawili Integrated School, a private elementary school located several kilometers outside Kalibo and just a few hundred feet from the ocean.\n\nMore than three hundred bright smiling faces quickly filled an outdoor covered gymnasium in orderly fashion. An aire of electricity pulsed from the chatting uniform clad and well-behaved student body. Team members interacted with students in various ways, often posing for pictures with the suddenly shy, yet still smiling, students.\n\nThe primary purpose of our visit, dental hygiene, was addressed by handing each child a toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste and a coloring book detailing the essential components of good oral hygiene.\n\nBefore returning to their classrooms, the children left us with a heartfelt and energized “Thank you Mending Faces” farewell. Our team left the school filled with the energy and smiles bestowed upon us by the future leaders of this remarkable and resilient nation.\n\nReleased our First Patients Today by Scott Angus\n\nFeb11\n\nToday we released our first patients! It was awesome to see how happy they were to go home. The cleft lip patients are required to stay for one night, so being the second day, we said goodbye to eight patients today. We gave each of them lovely handmade quilts, stuffed animals, t-shirts, books and toy cars. The kids’ recovery is difficult and painful, but our nurses and outreach team keep their spirits up. The parents are elated when they see how well their child is after just one day of recovery. The swelling and surgical lines begin to calm and their new beautiful faces emerge. When this happens, the family of the child is filled with absolute joy in hopes that their child will begin a new life where they are not teased, bullied or considered an outcast.\n\nHere are some more photos from today:\n\nSurgery room with our dedicated team of medical professionals\n\nScreening Day from Scott Angus\n\nFeb10\n\nMending Faces screened fifty-four patients today. The team arrived in the early morning and was greeted by fifty-five patients that traveled many miles to have the free surgery. Families waited to be seen by specialists from around the world including speech therapists, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, and dentists. This is when the patient’s pre-operation pictures were taken.\n\nVolunteers were dealing with extreme heat and difficult conditions, but the families were in good spirits as they were filled with extreme excitement for what awaits them in the next few days.\n\nScott Lawrence Angus MArt, MFA\n\nTravel Blog from Kelsey\n\nFeb9\n\nMy first trip abroad and my first medical mission! I was excited, but my fear of flying was in the back of my mind. Three hours before my departure, I received a call from American Airlines that the flight from Denver to Los Angeles was cancelled and they wanted to reschedule me for the next day. I stressed to them there was no way that was acceptable because I had a string of international connections to make from Los Angeles. I was flying to Korea, Manilla and then Kalibo. Then I bumped into Tony, a fellow Mending Faces volunteer, and we were on the same flight that got canelled, so we figured it out together. I had already taken my vallium for my fear of flying and we were running around the airport, terminal to terminal, trying to solve this problem! The song “Never Let Your Fear Decide Your Fate” resonated in my brain, and I knew I could figure it out! Luckily, we rerouted to Phoenix and were able to join the rest of the group in Los Angeles. Now that I’ve arrived, I am so exstatic to get started!\n\nKelsey\n\nGiving More than a Smile\n\nFeb8\n\nMending Faces – Giving More than a Smile\n\nBy Jeremy Douglas, First Year Volunteer\n\nThe first time I ever came in contact with the Mending Faces organization was at the (now) yearly barbeque fundraiser in Boulder, Colorado. Simply put, I had no idea the organization centered its cleft palate surgery program in the Philippines. I’d heard about all of the wonderful work the organization had done with children needing cleft palate surgeries, but I didn’t realize all of this work was being completed in Southeast Asia – let alone in such an underprivileged area where cleft lips and palates affect some 4,000 plus newborn babies ever year.\n\nQuickly I learned just how passionate the volunteers for Mending Faces are and just how big of a problem they are addressing. Looking at pictures and reading information from past missions spurred my interest further, but it was the stories being exchanged at the barbeque and the discussions between the volunteers that made me examine my own life and ask “What have I done to help others in need?”\n\nI regret to say, not enough, especially compared to those that make sacrifices every year to take part in this medical mission. Suddenly, this thought drove deep because I have already lived a privileged life at the young age of 26. I basically have the opportunity and support around me to do basically whatever I choose – all that matters is whether or not I would decide to pursue these opportunities. In pondering this thought, I felt inspired to take action from the urge to want to give back and help support the underprivileged that have limited opportunity. I started to understand what it meant to take part in such a challenging, but wonderful journey the Mending Faces volunteers embark upon ever year.\n\nWhile no one can do everything, everyone can do something. I believe this truth is evident and exemplified by the Mending Faces organization because each year dozens of volunteers and even more benefactors join together for a greater cause – to change the lives of children and their families forever. As we are fast approaching our mission in February, I am realizing that our goal is not just to provide free medical care and a brand new smile to those in need, but rather a new beginning to children whom otherwise would lead lives of potential isolation and shame. Mending Faces is helping open doors to the opportunities these children might otherwise never know and experience. From someone lucky enough to have a range of opportunities ahead of him, I don’t think there could be anything more ideal to pass along to others.\n\nI am so very thankful for the opportunity to join the team in Kalibo this year and am looking forward to doing the best I can to help create new pathways for these children and their families. I know everyone on the team is looking forward to all that this journey will bring and I can’t wait to work side by side those that share such a strong passion for creating not only a beautiful smile, but a new sense of hope. With a lot to learn and even more to give, I am excited to be one of the newest members of a Mending Faces organization that inspires the urge to give to a greater cause and provides a lifetime of smiles.\n\nArnest Gene Gonzales Aguirre\n\nFeb7\n\nArnest Gene Gonzales Aguirre- by Cathy McNamara\n\nOf all my Facebook friends, I have one very special friend named Arnest, a little boy who I befriended following our medical mission to Roxas City last year. He is a former patient of Mending Faces, and has already had two surgeries, one for his left cleft lip and the second on his palate. Nestlene, his mother, has kept in touch with many of us who have gone on past trips to the island of Panay. Facebook has proven to be a wonderful way for Mending Faces to maintain contact with our patients, and has spawned new ideas of how we can follow up on outcomes, and learn more about the post-op issues of our patients. We decided to send a few interview questions to Nestlene to learn more about the impact, both short term and long term, of the work that Mending Faces does.\n\nArnest has also become the Mending Faces “poster child” promoting awareness for Mending Faces on a billboard located on 18th Street in downtown Denver, Colorado.\n\nQuestions:\n\nMending Faces (MF): What impact has the cleft lip and palate surgeries made on your son’s life?\n\nNestlene: After the first operation Arnest opened himself up to people around him and gave him a life anew.\n\nMF: What has this surgery meant to you?\n\nNestlene: It gave me big hope that my son will gain more confidence. I cannot afford to pay for his operation, and when I heard the Mission of Mending Faces I felt so happy for my son, much more when his first operation finished.\n\nMF: Have there been any changes in your son’s attitude, confidence? Does he socialize more now?\n\nNestlene: Yes, plenty of changes! After the operation, he become more jolly, socialized, and felt so confident!\n\nMF: Has there been anything challenging after the surgery?\n\nNestlene: Plenty of challenges came after the surgery. When there was a bit of pain in Arnest’s mouth, we went straight to Dr. Hilario. He has become the very best of friends to Arnest, he even called him Uncle Doc. Dr. Hilario is the only doctor that Arnest wants to see, even if he has another sickness, he wishes to see Uncle Doc.\n\nMF: What differences have you noticed in your son since the surgery?\n\nNestlene: He has become happier and very confident, but as he got older and started to go to school, he become a little bit ashamed to talk because of troubles with his speech.\n\nNestlene: We are very much thankful to Mending Faces, to the Doctors and all the people who support Mending faces. I still wish and pray that his speech will improve after his 3rd operation. Keep up the good work and god bless your upcoming trip here in the Philippines.\n\nThe Mending Faces team is hoping to have Arnest join us in Kalibo in just one week, and help to comfort other young patients who may be nervous and apprehensive about having surgery by sharing his success story. The responses in this interview are hopeful, yet also illuminate the need for continued speech therapy in some of our patients. With two speech therapists joining us from a Norwegian cleft team this year, we feel confident we will be able to help Arnest and his mother address the speech issues that can continue post-op. They also will work with new patients and their parents with take-home speech therapy instructions as needed. It also reminds us that the work continues and with the help of our benefactors, volunteers, and Mending Faces missioners that come from far and wide, our combined efforts are truly making a difference! Thanks to all of you for your support. Be sure to get your friends and family to sign up for the e-blast to follow our trip departing on February 6th, so you can enjoy the inspiring and hopeful photos and stories as they unfold!\n\nA minor miracle, Kalibo 2013 – By Jay LaVigne\n\nFeb25\n\nRunning a medical mission is a lot like working the trapeze or walking the tight rope with only part of a net. Falling does not always mean disaster but it does involve a few moment of terror as you figure out if the slip means a big bounce or a sudden splat. With an inventory list that is pages long, dozens of electrical devices that are shipped (really sent via ship and ground carriers which takes 2 months or more) or stored for a year in the humidity of the Philippines, with surgeons, anesthesiologists and other doctor who each have their own demands and preferences, getting the mission set up and ready to operate is truly a study in chaos and crisis management. This year was no exception, as we discovered missing oxygen regulators (that control the flow from the tanks to the anesthesia machines) to a bove (electro cautery device) which would not work with our cautery pens, the list of things that need to be fixed or found on set up day seems endless.\n\nIt is not that these same crisis do not arise at home, it is that in Roxas City, the easy answers were all 10,000 miles away. Into this maelstrom stepped our guardian angel Dustin Vlcek, a bio med tech from Good Samaritan hospital north of Denver. Dustin was a last minute addition primarily tasked to help set up anesthesia machines in Kalibo (more on that below) but he became a critical player in addressing all the equipment issues that arose as things were unpacked and turned on.\n\nThe prime example, was the failure of one bove machine to work with the cautery pens. This devices cauterizes tissue to stop bleeding and is important in facial operations as the profusion to the lips and mouth is extensive. This year we did an exceptional number of palates as we took the cases that many missions refuse as too complex so a bove for each table was key.\n\nThe new bove pens have a switch built in so we have not been shipping foot pedals with the machines. Having a bove machine down was a huge problem. In stepped Dustin who determined that the problem could be resolved with a foot pedal. Of course, we had none of those so we were left scrambling to develop an effective work around.\n\nThe answer was surprisingly simple, after a scavenger hunt at the local hardware store (not Home Depot or even a small Ace, but more like the hardware store in Mayberry), we located a door bell and 4 meters of speaker wire, shazam, we had a functional foot pedal. While the most memorable of the emergency work arounds it was simply one of many and we are all grateful to Dustin for his ingenuity and good humor and keeping it all working.\n\nAfter days of extinguishing one fire after another, Dustin’s real mission arose on Wed as we traveled to Kalibo to reassemble 3 full sized anesthesia machines that had been donated almost 2 years ago by the Golden Ridge Surgery Center. Working anesthesia machines are a precious commodity in the Philippines. The main hospital in Kalibo that is the only source of care for 100,000 indigent Aklanons and it only has 2 and one does not have a ventilator which means for certain procedures the anesthesiologist has to squeeze and air bag 12 times a minute for hours at a time. If we could get these devices up and running, not only would the Kalibo hospital have more capacity but outlying district hospitals would also get a machine as well.\n\nThe Anesthesia Machine Odyssey on the domestic side was truly a Greek tragedy that involved multiple false starts, 2 fancy crates that we could not use and finally the stomach twisting decision that disassembling them was the only course so they would fit into reasonable sized box for shipment by a local freight forwarder (the heartburn related to the fundamental question, once you take them apart, can you put them back together?)\n\nThe cast of characters in the disassembly was large as Dustin and Sami Lababidi helped me rip the covers offer and disassemble the first unit. Randy Paulsen who helped develop the plates that we used to secure the main cart in a box so it could survive the 10,000 mile trip, Don Bailey who was instrumental in the disassembly of machines 2 & 3 along with Abe from Colorado Forex who shipped the boxes without incident to Kalibo.\n\nMiracle number one was that the boxes arrived in Kalibo intact and did not cost the Province one peso (which they truly do not have).\n\nThe next trick was for us to reassemble the units and verify that they worked. Dustin was unfazed by the 101 pieces that came out of the boxes (this was one unit) and immediately set to working with the local hospital maintenance to get the boxes together. The first machine were assembled and through a miracle of good fortune, we turned it on and it worked. See a picture Doctor Charles (Mending Faces chair) and Dustin smiling broadly at that plan involving years of effort and 10,000 miles of travel actually came together\n\nThe hospital maintenance staff is a hearty and hardworking group faced with a barrage of donated equipment, some of which never worked, limited training and zero spare parts so the fact that anything works is a testament to their skills. With their help the other two machines were assembled. Of course, we faced our own heart attack moment as the screen for machine number 2 failed to work – but after some problem isolation (for which Dustin deserves a PhD), he figured out that it was a cable issue rather than a screen problem and some further disassembly, we located the offending cable.\n\nAs I look at the above paragraph, I realize that I have utterly failed to express to real fear as we looked at a blank screen that we spent 2 years, $1000 and hours of hard labor disassembling, packing, unpacking and reassembling an anesthesia machine that doesn’t work. This eventuality was why we brought Dustin. Good thing we did.\n\nAfter another hour, all the gear was up and working. The picture is of Dustin and one of the hospital anesthesiologists going over all the features. She was particular happy with the extra oxygen port for a nasal cannula. Apparently, they have to move hoses on their current machines.\n\nAnyways, after all the effort, fear and trepidation, wailing and gnashing of teeth, there are now three fully functioning anesthesia machines in the Province.\n\nAs a side note, there will soon be 4 functioning anesthesia machine in the province. After we finished the set up and training, the local maintenance techs asked if we could look an older model machine that was not working. Dustin again showed a flare for problem isolation, quickly determined that the machine itself was working but when he went to test the vaporizers and realized that they both were leaking. He quickly showed the techs how to disassemble the vaporizers and found that a number of the O rings had failed. All they needed to do was replace the O rings and they should be good to go.\n\nIt was a very long day but leaving the province with 3 functioning machines and a 4th on the way, is a huge benefit to the patients of Aklan. Having started the whole project in May of 2011 with nothing but a hope that these huge devices might be of value, leaving town having made it happen was really a great feeling, one we would not have had without Dustin so all of us and many future patients in Kalibo and elsewhere owe him a debt of gratitude that will be hard to properly express.\n\nAll the Mending Faces volunteers provide valuable and unique services. The mission would be less successful if we lost even one, but in 2013, Dustin proved an extraordinary addition to the mission and we are already recruiting him for 2014.\n\nFinal Day – by Usha Barry, MD\n\nFeb24\n\nAfter the previous long days in the operating room, we finished our last day of cases refreshingly early. With amazing efficiency, all of the machines, equipment, medications and supplies were inventoried and packed away to be stored in Kalibo until next year. Extra supplies, surgical scrubs, even our OR shoes were donated to the very appreciative local hospital staff. The ORs and recovery area were once again empty except for a couple of tables. There was no sign left of what had taken place there for the last week. It was a relief to have completed the mission, but there was also a tinge of sadness in those bare rooms. Having been out of the hospital very little, I was eager to hear about the experiences of the outreach volunteers who have been in the community at schools, orphanages, and patients’ homes. My husband, Jeff, was able to accompany a patient home after discharge from the hospital today. Upon hearing his story and seeing his photographs, I was struck with a sentimentality that had been missing this week. Out of necessity, the atmosphere in the OR was definitely one of “business as usual” in order to get the operations completed. But learning about a little girl’s return to her rural home made real the impact of those hours we’ve spent in the hospital. I am grateful to the outreach volunteers who have made the medical team’s work more comfortable with a steady supply of drinks and snacks, made runs for emergency supplies, delivered care packages to the patients, and in every way have made the mission unique and meaningful through their enthusiastic and empathetic interactions with patients, families and the community.\n\nThe day ended with the (vice) Governor’s dinner reception. After a long week, I was tired and just wanted to sleep, but couldn’t neglect the gracious show of appreciation and hospitality by our sponsors. With food and speeches and singing and dancing, the Filipino’s thanked us for our efforts here. The experience was a surreal departure from the rest of the week, but as I looked across the room at one of the outreach volunteers, Kathy Snider, tapping her toes to the music, I couldn’t help but sing along myself. It has been a good week.\n\nFollowing a Patient from Pre to Post-Op – by Dr. Kay O’Leary\n\nFeb24\n\nToday, I followed one of my favorite patients, Michael, through his surgery. He is 10 and has both a cleft lip, and palate. Both he and his mom are delightful. The ORs are large rooms outfitted with two operating tables and anesthesia units. Upbeat music is playing constantly, keeping time with the beeps from the monitoring equipment. Everybody is upbeat, excited to be involved with the procedures they know will make such a difference in the lives of these children. When I asked a hospital official about locating patients for next year’s mission via the schools, he told me that the kids with cleft lips were kept at home and did not attend public school. Now these children will be able to go to school, make friends more easily and have a better self image and a chance at a better future. The buzz in the OR is also from the excitement of being able to work with and learn from some of the top professionals in the world. Surgeons assist each other, and they show each other different techniques that they use. Michael’s surgeons were gracious to the entire team, answering questions from observers, inviting us in for closer view of the procedure, and pausing to allow photos to be taken. It took an hour to close Michael’s palate, and another hour to change the set up and repair the lip. With two operating tables going at the same time, there is constant movement with nurses floating in and out to find necessary supplies in an unfamiliar setting. As the surgery progresses from the anesthesia prep, to the surgical prep, to the surgical procedure and the final finish/cleanup, the rhythm in the room moves from quick pace to steady, then back to quick as the patient is bundled up and rushed to the recovery room. In recovery, the patients have the undivided attention of the doctor and nurses, holding them and comforting them with soothing touches, and soft, kind words as they wake from the anesthesia.\n\nThe long job of healing is just starting. For patients with a lip repair, there is the discomfort of having stitches in the lip and nose. Once food is in the mouth, chewing will pull against the new sutures, but the adjustment goes pretty quickly. For the patients with palate repair, it is a different story. In order to get enough tissue to bridge across a large opening in the palate, the skin and muscle along the base of the teeth must be released to allow the tissue at the cleft site to be pulled together to be stitched. Special white mesh is then tucked into the area at the base of the teeth to cover the open wound. A few stitches hold it in place and the body will heal that area and cover it with new skin over time. There are stitches in the floor of the nose, the roof of the mouth and along the teeth. Eating is more difficult, so food must be processed until the patient is able to tolerate chewing and the movement of food in the mouth. It is amazing to see how tough and resilient these kids are.\n\nA Nurse’s View of Post Op – by Emily Feedar\n\nFeb24\n\nToday has been fantastic. I’ve been working alongside Annie Hardwick, Jenny Phillips, and Dr. Altrip in the post-operative ward. Most of the children are doing quite well and recovering without negative incidence. At times, I felt like nurse Ratchet faced with feeding a child water through a syringe while he cries and kicks me away; he may have to stay another night in the hospital for more fluids if he continues to refuse to drink. The parents try to get him to drink to no avail. I’m sure all parents know how easy it is to get a four year old to do something they don’t want to do! Many others are taking the water graciously while I swat flies away from their faces. I have been appreciating the challenge of communication without translators.\n\nA young boy was crying quietly in obvious pain. Unfortunately, the only medication they have here is equivalent to extra strength Tylenol, and is given every 6 hours. He had his only two hours prior, so nothing left to do but get him ice, wrapped in an examination glove, to ease his pain. It took some coaxing, but I hope it eventually helped. I am honored to be here to help in any way I can. It humbles me to see the strength of these children and their families huddled around cots in hallways and cramped rooms.\n\nThe Pre- and Post- Surgical Ward and Its Unsung Heroine – by Marilyn Toomey\n\nFeb24\n\nAs much as Americans might like to think we are idealistically superior to the Brits, having soundly trounced them in the Revolutionary War in order to “pursue our right” to have no king or man tell us what to do, there comes a time, and with respect to certain individuals, we need to realize that some of our best character traits (genetically, culturally, and spiritually) stem from across the Atlantic. Such a representative individual would be Annie Hardwick who is in charge of the pre- and post- surgical ward for our Mending Faces cleft palate/lip revisions.\n\nAlthough Nurse Hardwick would say she detested the idea of spawning children, she in fact nurtures, mothers, and places healing hands on our young and beautiful patients every day. She is responsible for minding the shop that cares for all the children who undergo the surgical correction of their cleft lips and palates (some quite severe and deforming). It is a feat that requires loving patience and extreme endurance, which I would question my ability to muster.\n\nAnnie has worked as a nurse for years, and an impressive, and versatile résumé she has. Born in Nottinghamshire, U. K., living for a few years in Canada, and then returning to Derbyshire, U.K., she has worked in midwifery, pediatrics, gynecology, and is currently a stroke research nurse for the Lincolnshire Clinical Research Facility in the United Kingdom. Oh yes, she keeps bees as well.\n\nA typical day on the ward might include 30 children, with 2/3rds being post op. With these children you have their mothers, sometimes fathers, and their siblings; grandma might be there too. They lay on small “camping” cots with no more than 3 feet between them, and if the whole family is there, they all sleep on the same cot. IV’s are strung along the wall on clotheslines. Very few children cry, but most are extremely well behaved. This is a pointed reminder of how we Americans have allowed our children to run amuck. The ward’s overflow patients line the hallway outside along one wall; the other wall is already taken up with women who have given birth or about to give birth making it even more confusing.\n\nThe parents are smiling and grateful and remarkably trusting of these perfectly strange and pallid foreigners who are about to perform surgery on their children’s mouths and faces. Some of the younger children cry hysterically if approached too quickly by one of the white giants (the Philippine people have darker skin tones and are diminutive compared to those of us who are of Northern European extraction), and since many of these children have been victims of malnutrition, they are even smaller than the norm. As we attempt to guess their ages, we discover that they are years older than what we first assumed.\n\nYesterday, I saw an unbelievable sight, from an American perspective: asleep on a cot was the cleft lip and palate patient, his Mom with his 1-month-old brother (also a cleft, but too young for surgery) at her breast, and his older sister. Count them….that’s 4, all neatly nestled together, soundly asleep, in 85-degree heat (no air conditioning) accompanied by an unsettling decibel level. The current tropical depression hovering over the Philippines, drumming inches of rain onto the hospital corrugated tin roof, creates a humidity level of 99% indoors…100% outside, of course, and the chaos of all those families in one room is truly an experience not soon forgotten. And mention must be made of the skulking hospital cats that keep darting in and out of the open doors, windows, and slinking about between beds and nurses feet. Quite unsettling to have one of those mangy, parasite infested creatures brush against one’s leg, but they are hungry as many are here.\n\nBut back to our unsung heroine, Annie Hardwick: these are the conditions that she faces every day. On the ward early, long before the rest of us are required to be at the hospital, and staying late, for sometimes several hours after the last surgery. She wants every child settled in properly before she turns the ward over to the local nurses at night. Each mother or father must be carefully instructed to “water” his or her child every 30 minutes, gently with a 20 cc syringe. The children must not eat or drink anything but clear liquids for two weeks, must not chew, must not smile, must not talk excessively to avoid tearing the delicate tissue and sutures of their newly reconstructed palates and lips. Since language and cultural traditions are barriers, this often requires more than a few, re-translated, reminders and demonstrations. Annie carefully observes and lays hands on each child to determine his, or her, condition. In addition, she trains the local nurses, trains the parents, trains the unskilled volunteer such as me, with infinite wit and wisdom in this 85 degree heated, 99% humidified state of bedlam.\n\nAnd with Annie, comes her abiding sense of wonder of all that exists around her. Life is a Miracle of God to be respected and honored. As she efficiently and skillfully cares for each child, you readily catch sight of her compassion and thoughtfulness. In difficult cases that struggle a bit post operatively, she ponders, she tries different approaches, she asks questions, and she never ever hurries to “just get through it all.” She exemplifies that the art of nursing is to ensure that the patient’s well-being is foremost. She truly personifies self-less giving of her life for others. Then she stands in the courtyard between the ward and the operating rooms, taking a quick break, and she quickly spies 3-inch long, neon green caterpillars with glowing, bluish, alien eyes, or a large snail sporting a 4-inch long shell. She pauses and sees all the wonders of creation about her and marvels at them. She is a whole person who in turn can treat a patient as whole person and then step back and still be amazed.\n\nAnd I must mention, before shutting down my computer, that her witty command of the English language leaves us Americans looking rather dull. Her patients’ Moms who catch on quickly are “sensible”, and if not, well… Children who won’t or can’t “settle” are “fractious,”…. I could have applied that term for my own children, frequently. And I was promptly told yesterday, in regard to my feeling a bit achy, that I no doubt was suffering from “supratentorial overlay.” Which of course I had to ask and was informed that it was “all in my head;” I was not being “sensible;” it was only the heat. And finally, per Annie, I should “Foxtrot Oscar” before my readers become senseless with my babbling. Polite British version of “taking my leave has become imperative.” Annie is really a humble person, and I hope I shall have thoroughly embarrassed her, because she deserves to be richly praised. She is truly God’s healing hands.\n\nEverything Under One Roof – by Dave McHale\n\nFeb22\n\nWhat’s a mall that has the look of an indoor strip mall and the feel of a flea market with a full blown grocery store? I give you Gaisano’s, the Philippine’s largest, well, it’s hard to describe, but I guess it’s a mall operator. Located about a half block walk from the provincial hospital it was perfectly located to fulfill the mission’s many needs.\n\nPart of my mission, ok a pretty big part, has been to hit Gaisano’s for everything people needed to drink, snack on, glue, wipe up, cool down, carry, secure, put on their feet, bandage, and otherwise wear. And it’s all under one roof! Some of the stores carry the Gaisano label, others do not, so I will never be able to fairly describe it…think of something that looks like a multi-level Wal-Mart on steroids, rolled up with the a mass of economic activity of a public market.\n\nAll of us on the mission are asked to contribute in many different ways. As a corporate exec in “real life”, I always tell my reports “don’t walk, but run to where your skill set can be fully utilized”. That said, I am not sure what it means when I very quickly tumbled to (err, unwittingly relegated to?) the designation of “Gaisano’s Minion”. I feel as a minion I am a strong performer and would put my minion assets up against those of any other minion. And please don’t misunderstand, I am truly happy to help get things the mission team really needs, but rest assured that given the speed with which I fell into this assignment will cause me to reexamine my own skill sets when I return home.\n\nOh yes, back to Gaisano’s. It’s not a very well designed building in terms of flow. They maximize space by jamming stuff together. But they have to because it’s structured in such a goofy way, more kiosks than your average US mall, a grocery store on the first floor, with a really curious odor in the meat department that left some who accompanied me to feel a little uneasy. By my tenth trip I was just used to it…A department store, toy store and hardware store along with dozens of others shops and kiosks on the second floor and more on the third floor, including a furniture store. It has a two screen movie theatre that currently features the most opposing of films; Les Miserable and some karate movie from Jackie Chan that I had never heard of. The epitome of Gaisano’s, expect one thing and sometimes get another.\n\nAfter my fourteenth, yes I have graced Gaisano’s fourteen times in three days; one of the most striking things is the number of people working in the facility. If there were that many people working in a grocery or a department store in the US, first you would be amazed, but you’d have to shop there quickly because that store would not be open for long. Workers constantly stocking, then three sometimes four to a check-out counter, armed security and a number of people at customer service…but not talking to customers. I do not want to leave you with the misimpression that all the staff made Gaisano’s a picture of efficiency. The opposite actually, which always made my trip there so full of excitement. They always had me guessing; how many people would I have to ask to find the super glue? Three including the one that said they didn’t even have super glue. How long would it take for one of three stockers in the drink area to get me three cases of water? I don’t have an answer because after waiting 20 minutes I gave up and just took all the individual bottles of water from the refrigeration section…which, not surprisingly, were not at all refrigerated. Getting the picture? A good minion who ply’s his minion trade at Gaisano’s learns to take what he’s given and roll with it.\n\nI end today confident that I will return to Gaisano’s several times tomorrow and, therefore, I again welcome a day full of promise and excitement at the unexpected. Rumor has it that that the kiosk selling little Filipino ice cream cones for eight pesos (about a dime) may be featuring cheese flavored ice cream. I don’t know what kind of cheese flavor (I rather doubt it’s a good Gouda), but I am going to have it because, like everything at Gaisano’s, you never know when you’ll be surprised.\n\nTaking a Patient Home – by Mark Horton\n\nFeb22\n\nWe had the opportunity to escort home a very young couple and their baby following the child’s cleft lip surgery. The tremendous poverty of their surroundings was “outshined” by the richness of their smiles, laughter, and appreciation of our mission efforts. We will be forever moved by tears of joy shed as we departed the warmth of their family and friends.\n\nThe living conditions………a dirt floor, no running water, a bucket for a sink, cook stoves in the street – they all faded in the glow of hope and inspiration as we waved good bye and returned to the hospital for another day of surgery!\n\nTales from the OR – by Amy Kennedy\n\nFeb22\n\nDay number 3 in the OR – we are running like a well oiled machine. There are 4 operating tables running simultaneous each with a team of talented professionals. We also have the help of several Filipino nursing students. They are eager to learn and grateful for the opportunity to scrub in and assist on cases.\n\nIn reality, we are working our tails off from 8 until 6 or 7pm daily. As of Wednesday evening we had finished surgery on 38 patients, specifically we had performed 19 palate repairs and 23 cleft lip repairs. Several dental procedures have also been done; the dental team has worked on 7 patients, pulled about 20 teeth and made one obturator for an older patient with a cleft palate that could not be repaired.\n\nReally our feet are tired, our backs ache, and our ankles have grown larger due to all the hours on our feet and humidity and the “eau de parfum” in the OR is strongly reminiscent of bug spray. But at the end of each day, we are joyous, humbled, inspired and wouldn’t have it any other way!\n\nP.S. – Our Dr. Mimi Wong was surprised to see her name used on a hospital poster that warns patients against Dengue Fever. Best we can tell, MIMI, is the acronym used to explain the sources of the fever – stagnant water, mosquitoes, etc. Mimi tells us that the poster will have a special place in her home in Denver!\n\nMending Faces Nurses and Outreachers Visit Inzo Arnald Elementary School – by Jessie, Karen, Becky, Missy and Coni\n\nFeb21\n\nWe just arrived back at the hospital from Inzo Arnald Elementary School, an urban school set in a bustling neighborhood full of city sounds and commotion. The school was selected for a visit as it was identified as a school in need and close to the hospital. The moment we pulled in, we heard shrieks of excitement coming from the classroom. Apparently our arrival had been a great distraction and the teachers seemed equally pleased to have something new and different to do a part from their everyday lessons. There were more than 400 children waiting to meet us from kindergartners to 6th graders!\n\nWe had never been greeted so warmly in our lives. The kids were so excited to see us. We walked into one classroom and we were greeted by the class standing up and in unison saying, “Good morning Ma’am!” We were there to give a presentation on dental hygiene, specifically tooth brushing. The principal translated for us, emphasizing the two by two rule – “twice a day for two minutes”…. just to make sure it was not a “Charlie Brown school teacher” experience. Each child received a toothbrush, toothpaste and a coloring book that illustrated how to properly brush their teeth. After the demonstration, we were treated like celebrities. The kids swarmed us and asked for our autographs. Now we know what it feels like to be famous! It was so overwhelming to be treated with such respect from the staff and the kids. They seemed genuinely interested and were eager to learn.\n\nWe even had time to do an art project with a small group of kindergartners, with art supplies sent by a Mending Faces supporter. The children were shy and a little tentative at first; however, after we gave them glue, glitter, scissors, and markers the shyness disappeared. Great fun was had by all! Our “kindies” seemed to soak up the opportunity to just have fun, and were quite enthusiastic to get “crafty” with the Outreach Team. For us, it was a delightful break from the grind of the OR, where we have been spending 10 hours a day on our feet. We felt so grateful to be able to touch their lives because they definitely touched ours!\n\nThe Road to Cuartero – by Dave McHale\n\nFeb21\n\nSo, the opportunities to do and experience wonderful things on outreach arise daily. I have witnessed the surgeries where cleft lips are pulled together for the first time, visited schools and an orphanage and have learned much about the wonderfully strong Philippine culture and her unbelievable friendly and endearing people. All unforgettable experiences that I was sure could never be topped. Until today.\n\nOne of the things I think we all think about when the many kids come though the mission is what are they lives like when they go home? Where and under what conditions do they live? What are their families like….what do their parents do for a living? A hundred questions that no one, not even veterans of the missions, have ready answers to, as we always said goodbye at the front doors of the hospital as the patients are discharged home.\n\nI was initially introduced to her on Monday as “Patient 18″. She is an adorable four year old kindergartner and was brought to the Roxas Memorial Provincial Hospital for the repair of a cleft lip. I was asked to take her “before” picture. She was in the pre-op ward with her mother and paternal grandmother. Smiling easily at all the strange people who were suddenly interested in her and all immediately taken by her easy-going nature in such unusual circumstances. What a courageous little girl I thought…then went about the hundred other things that outreach volunteers can do on this trip and never gave her another thought until this morning when I was told that I would have the opportunity to accompany her and her family to her home. Whoa.\n\nHer name is Milden. She lives with her family about an hour’s drive, a bumpy, twisty, sometimes sketchy, drive outside of Roxas in the town of Cuartero. Milden understandably slept most of the way home, but through an interpreter we were able to learn that she lived with her maternal grandparents and a 97 year great grandmother. Her father is a security guard in Manilla who travels home for several weeks only once a year to see his family. Her mother washes clothes when she can. Their combined monthly income is 7200 pesos, give or take, which comes out to $180 a month. No, it’s not a typo!\n\nTheir home backs up to a large rice field and is adjacent- in a very random way- to an indoor outdoor basketball court that is inexplicably covered in spots and fully exposed in others. We had to walk across the basketball court to get to the front gate as it is situated mid court and well off to the side. Inside the gate to the right was the family outhouse. To the far left is the pump from which the family draws all of it’s water. Yes, there is no indoor plumbing. The home is of bamboo construction with a metal roof. We were experiencing a tropical depression which in the Philippines means rain and lots of it, so the first thing you noticed when you entered the home was the noise of the rain hitting the tin roof. The second thing you noticed was all the jugs for drinking water, a jug for water used for doing dishes, laundry, bathing, etc., that had to be carried from the courtyard into the home, and the faint smell of smoke from the wood burning stove. There were a total of four lights in the entire home. They were very small bulbs so on a cloudy afternoon the interior of the home was almost dark.\n\nWe met Milden’s aunt, her grandparents and her great grandmother. They are very loving people who were so very happy to have “their” little girl back home with them. After staying a while and learning a little more about the family it was time to go. One of Milden’s grandmothers referred to the mission medical team as “gifts from god” as she and Milden’s mother thanked us for the thousandth time for allowing Milden to have a life changing procedure. The entire time we were in the home, Milden never left her mother’s arms. We were able to see Milden’s bedroom, replete with mosquito netting and no lighting. But to see how happy she was to see her bed, and how much she wanted to just get in it after her last 36 hours, whatever I or anyone else may conclude about living conditions in a relative sense, she was home, with her family, and that was clearly all that mattered.\n\nI hope others on our mission will have the unbelievable opportunity to visit our patients after discharge. Yet another truly unforgettable, moment courtesy of Mending Faces.\n\nThe British Perspective – by Dr. Stuart Binks\n\nFeb21\n\nI have attended 2 Mending Faces missions and each time I am overwhelmed by the poverty of the people and how I feel about being a part of changing children’s lives. The children are small for their age, for obvious reasons, and require less medication than European children but bear the surgery stoically with very few complications.\n\nWhen I see the children for screening the parents are happy with expectations but even more so when they are cleared for surgery. Anything we do is accepted with thanks from the family who are often, so gratefully, give us small gifts which, of course, we accept graciously.\n\nThe operation and the time spent in recovery are tense moments but when all is done and the child returned to the ward and their family there is obvious joy. The overnight care is provided by Philippine nursing staff. I perform a ward round before I leave the hospital and this the families find reassuring. The following morning ward nurses clean them for discharge and there is more joy for the family. Being part of process is a most satisfying thing and justifies all my training and time spent in Medicine.\n\nThe team is largely from the Western States of America with a few other nations represented (mainly Britain). We work all day, and at the end of the day we enjoy a quiet meal and a few pints followed by a lot of talk and laughter. The well known relationship between the “people across the pond” does truly exist. We British are learning the English language again and with a few subtle alterations manage to make ourselves understood. So much so that the Yanks are learning new words such as theatre instead of OR, recovery room not PACU, nappy not diaper and their own history since few of them knew that BOSTON, the original, is in England and a few of its inhabitants helped found the United States of America.\n\nInside the Operating Room – by Anna Domingo\n\nFeb20\n\nThere are many new faces in the OR this year. It is the 1st day of surgery; as always there is a lot of activity and excitement inside the OR. We make sure that our assigned rooms are well stocked and that all the equipment we set up the day before was working properly. This year we are fortunate to have Dustin (a medical equipment technician) along to troubleshoot any issues with our equipment. OR staff assisted him as best we could and felt like a team of McGyvers (remember the TV show).\n\nMy OR team today included Dr. Samman, Dr. Sia, Dr. Usha Barry and Mark Horton. At 8 am this morning, I went off with Usha Barry (an anesthesiologist) to pick up our first patient of the day at the ward. The parents were so excited and anxious for their child. As expected- there was a bit of separation anxiety; tears were shed as we departed the ward on our way to the OR. The patient arrivals in the ORs were staggered in each room, to ensure there was enough back up of personnel for the unexpected. Of course there were a few bumps as the day went on; but nothing that could not be quickly resolved. The local Filipino OR staff helped us out with procuring supplies that we didn’t have and they were very eager to assist us in any way. The outreach group made sure that we were hydrated and fed well all throughout the day. We completed surgeries on 13 patients, 6 cleft palate repairs and 9 cleft lip repairs by 7pm on the first day. The surgeons worked together as needed through the day, as there were some complicated and challenging cases. Excellent 1st day!\n\nThrough the Eyes of an Orthodontist – by Dr. Kay O’Leary\n\nFeb20\n\nSurgeries started today. We continue to have more people come to the hospital, hoping to get their life changing cleft surgeries. The decision was made to accommodate as many latecomers as possible. In the hall outside the screening room, where the decision is made if the individual is a good surgical case, people waited four and five deep. Some were from the day before, who were there to be admitted for surgery. Some were there due to the regular flow of patients seeking treatment at the hospital, and some were the thirteen additional patients that hadn’t been screened on Sunday, our designated screening day.\n\nAlong the wall waiting was David, who was one of the most disfigured patients we had screened on Sunday. As a child, he had a bad infection on the right side of his face, known as Noma, that exposed many of the teeth. The flesh-eating virus had taken most of his lip, and some of the cheek, leaving tight, constricted scar tissue that prevented him from opening his mouth more than about the thickness of 2 dimes. The teeth protruded badly, and were not functional. Being exposed, the teeth gave him the look of a skeleton, without any skin covering. David has lived this way most of his 21 years.\n\nWe decided that removing the teeth would allow him to look more normal and brush better. He wouldn’t be able to have surgery for his cleft because he couldn’t open enough to allow a breathing tube to be inserted. After we removed his upper right front tooth, and some on the lower right, he lost the skeleton look. We will see him again on Friday to remove the stitches we placed. I am anxious to see the healing and photograph the change. Most of our cases have clefts before, and are repaired to normal after the surgery. David will not have the pretty look of a repaired cleft due to the large defect. But, having those teeth removed should allow him to feel more normal, and less like people are focusing on his unusual appearance.\n\nWe also saw a young man whose cleft lip had been repaired, but the palate remains open to the floor of the nose. He has a small retainer with 2 front teeth on it, which normalizes his smile, but does not keep food from going up into his nose when he eats. It also does not help him make sounds that require pressure such as “B”s and “P”s. We took an impression with a soft material that gave us the shape of the defect in the roof of his mouth. From that, an appliance that covers his palate and seals the opening will be made, incorporating the missing two front teeth. He will come back tomorrow to have the obturator placed and fit, so we can make any necessary adjustments.\n\nLong Travel Experience – by Marilyn Toomey\n\nFeb19\n\nOnce again, my daughter, Jackie, and I, have trekked from our chilly residence in Colorado to the warm and humid climate of the Island of Panay in the Philippines. Grateful that Mending Faces allowed us to accompany them one more time on a surgical mission.\n\nAfter thirty-eight hours of late flights, a missed connection, and one volunteer photographer lost and restored, we finally arrive at the Kalibo Airport on Panay. Tired we were, but amazed to be dropped into an environment far different from our “sliced white bread,” Evergreen, Colorado experience. A soft warm breeze stirs the hair and relieves stiff joints. The landscape is green and lush, with splashes of bright color. There are no over engineered, linear contrivances of Western cityscapes. The people reflect poverty in all its blinding hues, yet also, it is a community that has learned to live with what grace it has been given. They are simpatico with their environment, imperfect and beautiful, reaching to survive, not giving up. We Americans seemed large and bloated with excess in contrast.\n\nOne could almost laugh at the cluttered yet unworried chaos of the Kalibo airport. The plane parks steps away from the terminal, and one does not wait dreadfully long for one’s luggage. This is good, because between the crowded, hot and confining space of the tiny terminal and the fact that toilet paper is not always readily available in the restrooms, one does wish, briefly, for an American airport until one thinks of the TSA. Explanatory note: toilet paper is a limited phenomenon in Asia. Why would one use toilet paper when one can dip water from a strategically placed bucket and take care of that bit of business?\n\nOutside the terminal, one is greeted, or assaulted, by vendors, selling beer, water, soft drinks, food and other items. I was overjoyed to be handed a beer and a bottle of water for 75 pesos ($1.85 US). What a phenomenal idea for American airports! As you are dragging your luggage out the door, someone hands you are beer in mid-stride for a nominal sum of money; perhaps everyone would be happier in America for just that simple reason. I was.\n\nA sign clearly stated that “We take bomb threats seriously,” the import of which is clearly countermanded by the milieu of stray people wandering freely in and out of the terminal. In March 2012, Kalibo airport security thought they had a land mine in their X-Ray machine, and the Philippine National Police prematurely announced they had foiled an attempt to bomb the Kalibo airport. They were hugely disappointed to find that their bomb was a damaged disc brake from a golf cart being shipped away for repairs. But they did take the threat seriously.\n\nAnd this airport is also under construction, but then since airports are under construction EVERYWHERE, this should not have been a surprise. It was difficult to tell from the clutter if this was a planned expansion or if half the roof was torn away in a storm, or perhaps a “not reported” bombing. It bore no signs of being an organized endeavor. I was speculating about this matter when I discovered I had left my Kindle aboard the plane. It took only a minute for me to run to security and be pleasantly surprised that they had already been asking around for the owner of the Kindle. Amazing. Yes, there was extensive paperwork involved in order to reclaim it; some things, once again, are the same EVERYWHERE. However, the conscientiousness, courtesy, and honesty of the Kalibo airport security team were refreshing.\n\nOn the Beach – by Connie Casalino\n\nFeb19\n\nWhat a great place to spend some time outside of the hospital – the beach! After the 1st day at Roxas Memorial Provincial Hospital, we did just that, “we hit the beach”. We were delighted to find warm water and breezes, waves, beautiful shells, smiling kids, and families enjoying themselves. Life unravels in front of us; the kids and families are so friendly and they LOVE to have their photo taken. This makes us feel like we are included in all the activity and fun at the beach instead of feeling like outsiders. Such a refreshing way to end the day and enjoy a place far away from our home and families!\n\nThe Speech Therapy Perspective – by Nina Helen Pedersen\n\nFeb19\n\nMy first time – and first day on the mission. Where should I start? What should I do? I felt a little lost in all the activity and preparations even though I had prepared a kind of protocol and brought some equipment from home. I was assigned a corner of the screening room where all the children came with their parents and were screened by surgeons, ENT-doctor, dentist, nurses, photographer and speech therapist. There was a lot of noise and not perfect conditions for speech evaluations. But I listened to them all and made the children repeat sound and explained to parents about cleft and speech.\n\nThe children had different speech problems due to the unrepaired clefts. All had some kind of nasalized speech, with or without audible nasal airflow and week pressure consonants. Others had nasal realizations of fricatives some again had glottal sounds and a few with cleft type characteristics like backing to velar. The most heartbreaking thing was some of the older children with unrepaired palates did not go to school. Their speech was almost unintelligible. All the children I met this first day I will meet again in the ward after surgery on Monday or Tuesday. My priority will be the children that undergo cleft repair. I will work with the parents and demonstrate oral airflow and correct placement of consonants. I have brought games and activities the parents can play with their children. As there are only 2 speech therapists on the whole island the goal is to help the parents help their children achieve better speech.\n\nBomba Radio – by Cathy McNamera\n\nFeb18\n\nThe beauty of a medical mission is you find yourself in situations that just might not happen at home. In an effort to increase awareness about cleft lips and palates and our organization, Mending Faces, we set up an impromptu radio interview with Radio Bomba. I was the Mending Faces spokesperson. I have never done radio, so the prospect seemed exciting and a bit nervewracking, but the cause is a great one….so I thought “why not”! On mission my motto is…..show up, suit up and do what you need to do to get the job done.\n\nWhen we arrived at the station, there was a politician being interviewed. We met her on her way out, a very pretty Filipina wearing a yellow dress with a purple scarf; she told us the colors signify strength for women. I mentioned to her I remembered Corazon Aquino and the yellow dress that she wore. She was pleased that I understood and could relate.\n\nWe met with a “very expressive” D.J., the station manager for Radio Bomba. We talked with him on the air about our group, what we thought about seafood (Roxas City is the seafood capital of the Philippines), why we came to Roxas and that we all traveled such a long distance to perform free surgeries. He was grateful and it struck me that he found it amazing we were doing this all for FREE.\n\nIt was gratifying as within 3 minutes of the interview, we received 15 text messages from people inquiring about cleft palate surgeries. At least one of which who will be screened for surgery tomorrow. I felt satisfied as we were able to connect with the community. Great day!\n\nCity Streets – by Connie Casalino\n\nFeb18\n\nStreet life seems chaotic and full of commotion here in Roxas City. Something we need to get use to as the streets here are noisy and busy, full of whizzing motor bikes (trikes as they are known in the Philippines) and taxis with more people and stuff than can actually fit in the vehicle, but that does not stop them. They all seem to know where they are going, honking and zig-zagging without collisions (so far). There are few stop lights, signs, or traffic cops. All this commotion is really the norm here in the Philippines; it is so different than streets and traffic in the United States. At home it seems as though everyone lives their lives inside their houses and here life unfolds on the streets in front of us.\n\nWe use the trikes to get from the hotel to the hospital and back. The 1st ride in the trike was a little unnerving but after arriving back at the hotel without a scratch, I am looking forward to the next ride. No more than 4 of us can fit in the trikes as we are all much larger than the average Filipino. Filipinos can fit 6 to 8 in the trike with groceries, books and bags. What a site to see!\n\nFamiliar Faces – by Monnie Biety\n\nFeb18\n\nI knew I had seen this family before. I just could not figure out where we had met. Finally, when I recognized the Pooh Bear that was in the bed with Arnest Aguirre, I realized that Mending Faces and Dr. David Charles had fixed his cleft lip in Kalibo in 2010. This year, Arnest has returned to have his cleft palate repaired by Dr. Charles with his mother, father, grandmother and, of course, his “Pooh Bear”. He will have his surgery this afternoon.\n\nScreening- Usha Barry, MD\n\nFeb17\n\nThanks to clear planning as well as the efficiency of the experienced volunteers, our first day of work here was much less chaotic than I imagined. We met in the morning and got our group assignments for the day. Some volunteers were to screen (pre-op) the patients for surgery tomorrow, while others would be taking patient “before” pictures and distributing beanie babies to the children, (just one set of the many wonderful items donated for the mission). I was assigned to the team that would set up the operating rooms (OR).\n\nWhen I got to the OR and saw box after box of miscellaneous equipment and supplies being brought in and unloaded, I was incredulous that all that stuff could be successfully organized into functional operating rooms in a single day! Then some of the volunteers who have been working with Mending Faces for years swooped in and really got things moving. The “newbies” quickly got into the spirit and pitched in wherever necessary. In a whirlwind, supplies were arranged and labeled, machines were assembled and equipment was set up. Things that didn’t quite work were jury-rigged; have you ever seen the 1980′s show “MacGyver?” Well, we had several real-life MacGyvers in action today, and their ingenuity was amazing. A little duck-tape especially went a long way! Would we practice like this in this in the U.S., well, no, but the fact that the volunteers are skilled and creative enough to make things work without the resources available back home is inspiring.\n\nI also spent a little bit of time in the screening clinic. The younger children were definitely frightened of the examination process. There were also older children who have already had a surgery (in some cases, a cleft lip already repaired, while their palate is yet to be done) who were stoic. With them all were their families who conveyed a sense of hopefulness. As a parent myself, I know that the feeling is more than just that. “Is this one of those chances that will change my child’s life?” I’d probably be wondering. They are putting their trust in us, total strangers, because they want what we all want, to help make life easier and better for our children.\n\nThe patients have been screened, the operating rooms are ready. Let’s do it. Let’s change some lives.\n\nDay 1- Mark Horton\n\nFeb17\n\nWe got the quick tour of the Roxas Provincial Memorial Hospital this morning and went straight to unpacking our supplies and setting up the opererating rooms, 2 rooms, four tables. Everyone stepped up and we made a fine team of putting it all together! No trip like this comes without unexpected issues…To our surprise (no surprise) we had some of our pre-shipped supplies and equipment infected with little bugs. We called them rice beetles. Some of our machines had been packed a couple months ago and shipped out ahead of our arrival, and had been packed with bundles of rice, to absorb the moisture. Apparently the little rice bundles had hatched little rice bugs, from the eggs contained in the rice! No problem, we disposed of what we had to, and utilized our wonderful equipment repair technical expert, new to our group this year, and he cleaned out the machines!, Onward and upward! OR’s all set, surgery starting tomorrow at 8 am. Full steam ahead!\n\nMark Horton\n\nIt’s Time\n\nFeb15\n\nOur volunteer medical team is currently on the plane to the Philippines as I write this. They will land in Manila in about 30 minutes, which will be Saturday morning for them, and from there they will grab a flight to Kalibo then take a hired bus to Roxas City. It has taken us almost an entire year to get to this moment and we could not have done it without our donors and volunteers as well as the dedication of our Board of Directors. It is a privilege everyday to work with such compassionate people.\n\nWhy does it take a year to plan our medical mission? Well, it all starts with identifying a city and determining if there is a need as well as if there is a community that will support our mission. In order for us to be successful we need to have the local government and a hospital partnering with us. We utilize the local Rotary Club as our main way to connect with these important organizations. The Rotary Club is a key component to our mission and we are grateful for their support year from year. Once we have those all confirmed then it is time to start putting the team together.\n\nWe start recruiting volunteers about 8-10 months out. Our team is made up of medical professionals and non-medical professionals. We work so far in advance for two reasons. The first reason is that this is a big commitment for a volunteer and we want to give them enough time to adequately plan on taking time off and/or raise the necessary funds to participate. All of our volunteers cover the cost of their flight and lodging. The second reason is that it takes almost 6 months to get our medical volunteers licensed to practice in the Philippines. We work directly with the Philippines Medical Association in making sure that all of our medical volunteers are properly licensed.\n\nOnce we have decided on the team we start booking flights, making arrangements for lodging, meals and transportation. We also begin ordering the necessary supplies, updating equipment as needed and preparing the team for the experience they are about to embark on. Throughout all of this we are spreading our message, engaging individual donors, meeting with corporations, planning events and writing grants in order to raise the necessary funds to make this possible. Of course I am giving you the short version of what our year looks like leading up to the day the team flies out but we hope you get the idea.\n\nOver the next week we will share stories and pictures directly from the team. This is where the magic happens; this is what makes all the work we did this last year worth it. We hope our stories inspire you. Some of you might have a hard time seeing the faces of the children before their surgery, others might tear up at the impact we make and many of you will feel a sense of pride and joy that you are a part of this. We truly thank you for supporting us on this journey and thank you for making a real difference in the lives of so many innocent children.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nKerri-Ann Appleton\n\nExecutive Director\n\n5 Days Until We Depart\n\nFeb10\n\nThe official countdown for departure has begun. In 5 days, I know my life will be transformed and I will be humbled by the children and parents we meet who’s lives have been challenged by cleft lip and cleft palate. I get butterflies in my stomach anticipating the range of emotions I know I will experience confronting this journey half way around the world to the little island of Panay. I have shared with my friends how rewarding and inspiring the experiences were on the trip last year, and though I don’t want to fill my head with expectations, I do know a few things are certain. The humidity will hit me like a freight train, we will arrive severely jet lagged, we will be stared at, and if we keep an open mind then anything and everything is possible! Roxas City, Philippines, here we come!\n\nCathy McNamara\n\nA few more missioner notes\n\nMar17\n\nFans\n\nThree missioners have submitted their stories and experiences. The mission was so very special that it is hard to really communicate the emotions that we felt during this spectacular week but we are going to keep trying (I grouped the pictures for each other). Jay\n\nFriends of Mending Faces:\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the mission trip was playing with the children. The Filipino children are amazing, brave, intelligent, and a lot of fun to work with. One of the little girls that we worked with especially caught my attention. I cannot remember her name but she was number 72.\n\nThis little girl would sit in a bed next to a window and keep opening and closing it as soon as someone looked at her. She had such a big smile on her face anytime one of us would make faces at her through the window. When it was time for her procedure she was so brave. She stayed perfectly calm and playful while she waited for one of the surgical staff members to come and get her. When the time came she marched herself right back into the OR without a second though and never looked back. After her palate repair she was one of the few children that still wanted to get up and look around. I was so impressed with how strong she was. I know that I won’t forget her anytime soon.\n\nJackie Toomey\n\n(Notes from new Missioners but long term supporters of Mending Faces – Steve and Cindy Lowe)\n\nDay 1 – Screening\n\nCindy and I had only imagined what Mending Faces did in the field from the stories and pictures of its volunteers. We finally made the leap and committed to our first mission this year. What the stories and pictures don’t tell are the amazing doctors, nurses, assistants and volunteers that devote their skills and compassion to changing the lives of these wonderful children.\n\nLining the humid hallways were over a hundred families and children awaiting the screening process. I had to walk outside, wipe the tears and take a deep breath. The stories and pictures don’t prepare you for what the Mending Faces team takes on in one week, in conditions that are to say the least, a bit challenging. When I walked back into the screening room the mix of hope on the parent’s faces, uncertainty in the children’s eyes and compassion in the voices of the volunteers calmed my own selfishness as I contemplated the week ahead.\n\nThe volunteers who do this year after year are a colorful combination of characters from the Philippines, South Africa, Great Brittan, Hong Kong and the United States. This experience is impossible to express in stories and pictures.\n\nWe are truly blessed to be part of this incredible Mending Faces medical mission. Due to the efforts of many unselfish and compassionate people, the Philippine children and families will be left with, well, mended smiley faces.\n\nThanks Sami and Carrie for pushing our comfort zone.\n\nDay 2 – First day of surgery\n\nAs first time “outreach” volunteers, Cindy and I were waiting for our assignments and quickly discovered you need to operate in an environment with little direction. Actually this is a good thing as the aggressive schedule, the adhoc needs of the day and the unknown requirements of doctors, nurses and patients would be impossible to schedule.\n\nYou need to get to know the families and children; this will guide your assignments. They are organized into hot, crowded wards by their day of surgery. Most will have to spend days waiting in the hospital, multiple families on each bed in the hot, humid conditions. From the rambunctious twins Kelvin and Kevin who ran up and down the halls nonstop, to Alexandra who needed her photograph taken every time we saw her, to the 16th year old John who never moved from his corner on a bed in the ward, they all appreciated the attention. While we could never get John to smile, after giving him the “thumbs-up” up sign countless times, he finally reciprocated with a “peace sign”. Cindy manned the SpongeBob Band Aids and Bennie Babies to keep the kids focus off the wait. I went to work with scissors and cardboard to create a dozen makeshift manual fans. Back into the ward, within minutes there gone and I am back making more. When I returned, Cindy had a crowd of children surrounding her with Band Aids up one arm and down the other. This is the work of Outreach.\n\nYou need to get to know the Mending Faces team; this will guide your assignments. A lesson in patient management from first timer Sam (the aspiring liberal arts student) who’s dedication to making the children’s experience as comfortable as possible was the example to follow. If we ever needed to know where a child was, just ask Sam. A lesson in hard work could be learned from everyone, but Amy is an animal. While the Doctors are all amazing, a lesson in life could be learned from Wolfgang and his lovely wife Daisy. Between them I think they have several thousand years of experience. Then there’s Jay “the Answer Man”, I think he is part Doctor, Lawyer, Atmosphere Coordinator, and Pharmacist. How can we make this team more productive? Oreos, Coke Lite, Nescafe, Chips Ahoy, and Cheetos.\n\nRookies are generally treated like rookies, but not with this group. Between comforting the patients, making designer cardboard fans, trips to get supplies (I have never bought 200 tubes of tooth paste before), making outreach kits, handing out beanie babies, documenting the trip through pictures and getting acquainted with the team we can’t imagine how exhausted the operating room team is.\n\nDay 3 – More Surgery\n\nToday Cindy and I had the privilege of spending the entire day in the Operating Room. What an incredible experience.\n\nSome of the children came into the room willingly with apprehension in their eyes, some came in crying at a high wail and then there were the one with legs and arms swinging every known direction to mankind. I never believed it would take 4 grown adults to hold down a 4 year old so Sami could send them off for a nice little nap.\n\nBy all accounts cleft lips are nothing short of a terrible disfigurement that will eventually affect the children unless corrected. I say eventually, in that the young children don’t have a care in the world as they run around the ward, interact and engage you with a smile. The older children understand and they hold their heads down as if they have done something wrong. Then the anesthesiologists, nurses, surgical assistants and doctors perform this incredible magic and transform their faces so they can lift their heads high again. Wow. The transformation is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nDuring our operating room experience we assisted and observed, asked questions and learned, but most importantly felt welcomed by all the operating room team mates who I can only image have to exercise patience with the Outreach newcomers.\n\nSteve and Cindy Lowe – Outreach\n\nNot only was Steve able to locate hundreds of tubes of toothpaste in San Jose, he donated them as well. Then dental mission was a blast – thanks to all who made this new activity possible.\n\nReport on Mending Faces Mission to San Jose in Philippines 2012\n\nDaisy and Wolfgang Losken\n\nThe 2012 Mending Faces Mission to Philippines was a great success in the impact it had on so many children and adults with cleft lip and palate. The atmosphere during the week long mission was relaxed and friendly and exceptionally efficient. The 50 volunteers had a wonderful time and it seemed that every one of them was glad that they had participated and enjoyed every minute of it. From this experience their lives have been changed forever.\n\nWhen we walked into the Hospital on Sunday morning we saw a sea of patients with so many cleft lips, that it raised the excitement level. All the children were smiling and looking at us lovingly and expectantly. What surprised me the most was the number of severe bilateral cleft lips among the group. These are a very difficult form of cleft lip and I loved doing these repairs. Their parents also looked at us hopefully and expectantly and what showed most was their appreciating that we had come a long way to operate on their children free of charge. So many of them were older and obviously did not have the finances to have the operation at the usual time. We usually operate on cleft lips at 3 months and there was a teenager and older boys and mother of 40. This was their time to be healed and cured.\n\nIt was decided that all the surgeons would see the patients together and on mental arithmetic it meant that we had 4 minutes per patient on average. We soon split into two groups to see the cleft patients. We saw cleft after cleft and documented them for an operation. Daisy came to tell me that there were twin boys with bilateral cleft lips. I am a twin and I know that people always compare twins and only once in my life have I operated on twins. In that case, one twin had a cleft lip and the second did not. It was a joy to watch them grow up and see how it affected them. What stands out in my mind was that 5 years later the parents shared that the child with the cleft lip had become the dominant child. In the Philippines we saw the twins and Kelvin was a severe bilateral cleft lip with a very prominent premaxilla and was obviously going to be a challenge. The second twin Kevin was milder. What struck me was that these two children were very close and loved to be photographed and wanted to see themselves on the camera. They were a joy to watch. I requested that I would like to operate on them. I thought it would be better if the same surgeon operated on both children so that the results would more likely be similar. This defined the mission for me. It was the mission of the Twins.\n\nWe managed to complete seeing all the children and we handed the lists to Amy to schedule. I did not envy her. The next I heard was that she had booked 5 cleft operations for each surgeon per day. The most I had ever managed on a day was 4 clefts. We were going to have a challenge. Usually the first day is chaos in sorting out all the equipment and getting the children in to operate on them. We had two operating rooms with two tables in each room. To my surprise we all finished by 7pm on the first day and most days after that. It was a wonderful and superbly organized mission.\n\nEach day I would visit the ward first thing in the morning to try to take photos of the children that were to be operated on by me. Our patients were in three rooms, with the beds very close together and some cots with three children in a bed. The beds were old and rusty and there were no mattresses. The bed was covered with cardboard or wood on which the children lay. There were a group of 4 nurses and two doctors who had come from England and they had collected money to purchase needs that they observed in the hospital. They had $5,000. They went out and purchased mattresses and beds and fans and 5 wheelchairs and a fridge. Fortunately the operating rooms were air conditioned but the wards were not and it was very hot in the wards. The fans were a Godsend. Some of the donations had come from Rotary and some from private donors. What an impact those donations were having on the Hospital in Philippines and countless future patients.\n\nOn the Monday some of the easier clefts were booked and I had a great mix of unilateral, bilateral cleft lips and a cleft palate. On the Tuesday the twins were scheduled and at 8am Kelvin, the wider bilateral cleft lip twin was ready for surgery. The challenge was to repair the lip muscle over the prominent premaxilla and this proved to be difficult. The nose correction was even more challenging and in the end it came together well with a good tip to the nose and a good airway.\n\nWe made a mistake of booking the second twin Kevin later in the day and he did not like waiting and was upset to see his twin brother return after the operation and he was hungry. We then scheduled him earlier. After the operation Kevin was not a happy little boy and did not want Liz and Sue to clean his lip or allow us to take photographs. We did manage. We are looking forward to getting post operative photos in many months when the lips have healed.\n\nSince I took 3 hours to do each of the twins, some of the other surgeons took over some of the operations that were scheduled for me, with the theory that we will strive to get perfect results in each child, even if it took us longer to do. It was such fun seeing what the other surgeons were doing and having healthy cross pollination and discussions on the operations and conferring on difficult problems.\n\nWe rotated round the tables and so had different anesthesiologists each day. They were all excellent. Bonnie helped me superbly and I requested to have her stay with me for the entire week and it was a joy to work together. Of course that was no reflection on the other scrub nurses who stayed with their surgeons and developed their own team.\n\nThe cleft palates were another challenge. As many of the patients with cleft palates were older, they were very wide and I was worried that they would not close. Two of the clefts were 25mm wide at the posterior border of the hard palate and one was 20mm – that is very wide. Fortunately they all closed and looked great the next day.\n\nOne aspect of note was the noise in the operating room. There was a constant din of people talking and in high spirits and one thing was obvious was that everybody was having a wonderful time. It would have been a pity to reduce this specialness of the mission. It was obvious that everybody was having the time of their lives and enjoying being part of the mission to help poor children in a country so far from home. There were many volunteers and for some of them this was the first opportunity to be in an operating room and watch the surgery. They would see the surgeon mark the plan of action and dissect the lip and the nose and then put it all together – and what a transformation. There is a beautiful normal lip and nose. Each time it is like magic. We loved having volunteers watch and the joy of them seeing the transformation emphasized to us what a pleasure and an honor it was for us to be able to repair cleft lips and palates.\n\nThe volunteers were kept busy. They had 2,000 toothbrushes donated and Steve and Cindy Lowe purchased toothpaste and combined them in a package with a neat bow and gave them to the children in the hospital and in the orphanages. They were taught how to brush their teeth and encouraged to do it twice a day. They also visited a home for At Risk Children, Let us Care Foundation, run by Erna Vinkers. She is a Rotarian and was a great help. Rotary of Antique was wonderful in planning the mission and getting the equipment to the hospital and looking after us during the mission. They organized a great dinner. The Governor also had a dinner for us.\n\nEach child received a laminated sheet of the pre and post operative photo of themselves. It was a very special souvenir. The patients and the parents loved it. Many were overwhelmed. Many had never seen photos before and the joy and gratitude were palpable.\n\nIn the week we operated on 80 patients. This mission had a great impact on all these patients. Their parents were so appreciative. It seemed that every member of the volunteers of Mending Faces had a wonderful time and were glad that they had joined the mission and visited Philippines to give of their time free of charge to help the poor children. Jay and Donna Lavigne were wonderful in the way they organized the mission flawlessly. For me it was a special pleasure since it was my 20th mission and a joy to work with my school friend David Charles. We were at school together since the age of 10 and at university together and he taught me how to ski. David Charles and Mimi Wong were the co-founders of Mending Faces. It was also a special pleasure to meet a co South African, Tony Soboil. He is the son of a lady who had her hair done by my father and then my brother in Cape Town for 50 years and I remember shampooing her hair when I was a little boy helping my father in the hairdressing salon.\n\nDaisy and Wolfgang Losken\n\n81 – The final count\n\nMar1\n\nWith the Governor, Congressman and our own birthday boy David Charles who turns 70 on Sunday.\n\nMorning of the last day! Missed blogging yesterday, the work and dinner load got to be too much. In addition to being at the hospital at 7 and getting out around 6:30, we also had dinner on Wednesday with our host organization, the Rotary Club of Antique (they can get away with using that name since they are the only Rotary in the whole province). Last night (Thursday) was the Governor’s reception. So we get back to the hotel at 10 or 11. No chance to blog from the hospital, a little busy.\n\nIt is 5am here right now, I slept in (so comments about typos and wordos are not needed – I know). Many of us this week have been waking up at 4am which has made it possible to get anything posted at all. Of course, that is 1 in the afternoon in Denver so our bodies are still adjusting. We are not really suffering jet lag which will really hit us when we go home. Now we are a little sleep deprived, jet lag is the sudden and irresistible urge to sleep at noon.\n\nBut I wander, today we only have 5 surgeries scheduled which will bring us to 81 patients, 83 procedures. An amazing total that has required us to move with purpose all day, every day (no hurrying, just deliberate speed). The patient needs to be prepped on the ward for surgery, an IV may need to be started, the surgery takes between one and three hours. With four tables working, the flow of people in and out of the O.R. is pretty constant.\n\nThe hospital has been really supportive as well as tolerant of our presence. We are pretty much living in the Doctor’s lounge. They have other space and a lunch room available but it is all too far away. We schedule 15 minutes between cases and the table turnover is probably less than that so we try not to let the medical professionals stray too far away from the theater.\n\n(San Jose has only 2 operating rooms but each room has 2 tables – it worked well for us)\n\nOnce out of O.R. they spend some time in PACU (post anesthesia recovery unit) while the anesthesia wears off and to ensure that they have tolerated the surgery well.\n\nMending Faces is lucky to have so many special volunteers but we are particularly thankful for the “Brits” who staff the ward and PACU. There older nurses and a doctor have so much experience that these tasks are done flawlessly. Thanks to Annie, Liz, Jean and Stuart for doing their jobs so well. They hail from around Boston, England and have been coming to the Philippines with medical missions for many years. We are also happy to Sue and Rob also from the UK working as a team providing anesthesia during surgery.\n\nOur youth outreach had blast connecting with the kids: The end of the beanie baby craze has given us a huge resource of toys for the patients.\n\nThis year we had adequate staff to initiate a dental outreach component where we distribute toothbrushes and fun dental brochures to schools in the area. Aside from the needed dental awareness, it give many of the missioners a chance to see the community up close. All of us give so much to make the mission work but it is worth noting that outreach volunteers Steve and Cindy Lowe have been on a mission to not only provide toothbrushes for the kids but toothpaste as well. They have been able to locate and purchase hundreds of tubes of toothpaste so when the kids go home from school they have a full kit.\n\nIt is hard to describe the excitement that the visit by these Kanos (Americans) generate in the schools. Also defying words is the gusto with which Mark Horton performs the tooth brushing demonstration (there may be a video on the web site)\n\nMark should get a job as a spokesman for the American Dental Association. One more half day and time for a break on the beach. We earned this one.\n\nPerspective of a new missioner\n\nFeb28\n\nThis is my first year volunteering for Mending Faces, and I’m sorry it took me so long to make this connection. I am a vintage retired RN and it’s been many many years since I have been involved in direct patient care, but this mission had great appeal. And now that I am here, I am delighted with my decision.\n\nJean Coates - many years experience running the PACU\n\nAfter a day getting ready and two days working in the PACU/Recovery Room and having the opportunity to observe in the operating room, I am astonished at the heart, energy and expertise our volunteers have brought to this community. The surgical procedures are incredible – they aren’t just decent surgeries to improve a very difficult situation. They are much more – the surgeons offer such depth of expertise and have a desire to make each procedure as good as it can be!\n\nAnd how can you not be taken in by the looks of these beautiful children and their concerned parents. Even the lack of a common language cannot hide the looks of concern, fear, and appreciation. This have been an experience of a lifetime.\n\nCarol Ansley\n\nAlameda, CA\n\nThe Youth Outreach Perspective\n\nFeb27\n\nMy name is Jackie Toomey and I am a part of “outreach” for the 2012 Mending Faces mission trip to San Jose, Antique in the Philippines. Today was the second and first full day of the mission trip. I spent most of my day helping screen different patients for the group. It was a wonderful experience to see all of these amazing and beautiful children that are in need of this life changing operation. Almost all of the people I saw through administration did not speak much English but they were both happy to be there and concerned for their child or grandchild. I was really amazed by the number of people that came to see the group today. As I understand it, last year’s mission did not have as many patients as they would have liked so this year was really exciting because there were over 100 patients that showed up; including two sets of twins! At the end of the day it was very rewarding to hear that that we were able to sign up around 90 patients for surgery.\n\nOne part of my day that was particularly memorable for me was this 2-year-old boy by the name of Quin. Quin had a bilateral cleft lip repair a while back but still had a large cleft in his palate. Before this case I did not know that most children only receive the lip repair or the cleft repair. This is both because of the recovery time and also how time consuming it is to perform those procedures in tandem. This goes to show just how precious our time is here. The next few days are going to be packed but it is wonderful to know that we are making a difference in each life we touch.\n\nAn ocean of concerned yet hopeful patients and their families. San Jose does not get many missions (probably mentioned that). For these surgical candidates and their families, there is a sense that it may well and truly be: now or never.\n\nIt has been emotionally a little more difficult than last year in Kalibo. Kalibo, for a variety of reasons, has many more missions like Mending Faces’ and, therefore, when we go there, the patient pool is typically much younger. We know for the toddlers that we get to before the age of 5, their deformities will be something they remember through stories their parents tell them rather than having lived with the ridicule of being different.\n\nIt is heartbreaking to see otherwise beautiful young ladies suffering through the shame and degradation that is typically heaped upon those with deformities as obvious as a cleft lip. Above is Jenny, age 13 – an age when kids want to blossom socially, Jenny most likely avoids crowds and meeting new people who might tease her, preferring to live a more reclusive lifestyle limited to family.\n\nWhile families that have more than one child with a cleft are not that uncommon, we had a mother and daughter appear at the screening.\n\nThe causes of facial clefts are not well understood – it is not strictly genetic although genetics play a roll. The similarity in the clefts between Gina and Gine are a bit startling. (We will get the after pictures posted soon).\n\nMending Faces does devote time and effort to trying to make the kids feel special and wanted. This is a very stressful time for everyone and helping the kids relax with coloring books, crayons and more makes the process easier of everyone. Like the industrious and thrifty Filipinos, we seek to achieve the maximum value from all that we use.\n\nAfter being used as an exam glove, the glove will spend the rest of its existence as a funky looking balloon that all the kids love.\n\nScreening is an important process. Not only do we have to verify that we are able to help the patient, we also go to great lengths to ensure that the procedure can be done safely.\n\nThe surgeons use a team approach as they review cases. Sharing experience that may be relevant to a particular case helps ensure the best outcomes. Also, scheduling complexities make it impossible to have the same surgeon who did the screening review, do the surgery so the doctors use this time to get a feel for how each of them approaches these kinds of cases.\n\nAll the disciplines for ensuring great results work at screening. There is a general health screening and review of records and a chest X-ray to ensure no respiratory issues and good health sufficient to tolerate general anesthesia (people cleft palate suffer frequent infections because their airways are open to infiltration by food). We also have a dentist as well as anesthesiologists as part of the process.\n\nScreening is always a challenge but it went extremely well. We saw 81 patients and only had 2 that issues which excluded them from surgery – Dr. Ric and everyone at the local hospital did a fantastic job pre-screening the candidates and helping out during the 4.5 hours it took to see all the patients:\n\nAfter traveling 37 hours, waking up a 4am local time because that is 1pm in Denver, rushing to get everything set up and running the screening – we felt a lot like the dog below, pretty much anywhere would be a great place for a nap.\n\nScreening is also a great chance to connect with the kids, because the deformities can make us forget that, behind the deformity, is person ready to laugh and enjoy life as much as anyone else.\n\nGiving this child something to smile about for the rest of his life seems to make all the work worth it.\n\nJay\n\nA San Jose Kind of Day\n\nFeb26\n\nToday was our first day at the hospital, spent busy preparing for the coming week. “Busy” seems like it might be a theme for our mission; we scheduled surgeries for about 81 patients. It was a full day which started at 10 AM unpacking boxes and setting up the operating room. We ended around 5 PM with the last of the patients making their way through our screening process. Our whole team is looking forward, firstly, to a good night’s sleep.\n\nThe children are beautiful and enthusiastic. Meeting them and their parents confirms for all involved that we’re doing good and necessary work. It’s well worth all the scheduling headaches and the heat. Indeed, the air feels more like hot oatmeal than actual air, but it more adds to the sense of effort than actually bothers\n\nThe staff at the hospital has been welcoming and friendly. They will be a joy to work with and will, no doubt, make our jobs quite easy.\n\nOur two operating rooms are set with two beds apiece. With the great and numerous staff, we ought to be able to have quick turnover and easy procedures. We start at 8 AM tomorrow. It will be a long but ultimately gratifying week. We know it will zoom by.\n\nThe Long March: 36 Hours to San Jose\n\nFeb23\n\nDay One –"
