This document defines key terms related to labor relations and labor disputes under Philippine law. It discusses definitions of employer, employee, labor organization, and labor dispute. Some key points include:\n- An employer includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, and a labor organization can be considered an employer in relation to its own employees. \n- For a labor organization to be legitimate, it must be duly registered with the Department of Labor and Employment. A union cannot be composed of both supervisory and rank-and-file employees.\n- A labor dispute can exist regardless of whether the parties have an direct employer-employee relationship, as long as it concerns terms of employment.",
