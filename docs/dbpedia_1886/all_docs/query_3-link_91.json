        "text": "You may have heard about how many criminal cases are settled without a trial. It’s true, more than 94% of criminal cases are resolved through a plea bargain rather than going to trial. Would you believe that the statistics for civil cases are similar?\n\nEstimates vary, but somewhere between about 95% of civil cases reach settlements at some stage. And a settlement can be reached at literally any stage of the case — from before the case is even filed to after the case is over (when the winning side will offer to settle to prevent the losing side from appealing).\n\nHow Do Personal Injury Settlements Work?\n\nNo matter what stage of the case a settlement is reached in a personal injury case, the function is the same. A settlement is an agreement for the plaintiff to take a specified sum in exchange for not pursuing the case in court.\n\nThe way that settlements are negotiated can be tricky for both sides. The plaintiff—that’s the person who was harmed and is suing—risks taking a lesser amount than they might get from a verdict. The defendant—the party accused of causing the harm— offers to pay something now to avoid the expense of the trial. But the verdict could go either way.\n\nThere’s a reason why we have sayings like “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” For most plaintiffs, a guaranteed settlement sum is better than a gamble on the verdict, even if the verdict amount might be a lot higher.\n\nPersonal Injury Lawsuit Outcomes\n\nPersonal injury lawsuits almost always end in settlements. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only 4% to 5% of personal injury cases go all the way to trial.\n\nA study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2005 found that:\n\nOf all the personal injury cases that went all the way to verdict, the success rate for plaintiffs was about 50%\n\nThe highest success rate was in auto accident cases, at 61%\n\nPlaintiffs were only successful in 19% of medical malpractice trials\n\nWhat this means for someone considering a settlement offer is that, if you accept the settlement offer, you are 100% guaranteed to get the amount being offered. If you reject it, statistically speaking, your chances are about 50/50. You’ll either end up with an amount greater than the settlement, or you’ll end up with nothing.\n\nOf course, there’s another possible outcome besides settling or reaching a verdict. Cases can be dismissed at any time and for a variety of reasons. The plaintiff can simply drop the case, but the judge can also dismiss either based on motions of the parties—basically one side or the other asks the judge to dismiss—or sua sponte (on the court’s own accord).\n\nHaving an attorney working with you during settlement negotiations is incredibly valuable. After all, the statistics suggest that more than 9 out of 10 cases your personal injury attorney has worked on ended in settlements. That experience alone is invaluable.\n\nAdvocating for Your Rights\n\nWhen you’re in a personal injury dispute, the other side is going to have a team of legal professionals. The insurance companies on the other side of the table are going to be represented by lawyers who work on personal injury cases—and personal injury settlements—all the time.\n\nIf you don’t have an attorney, you’ll be on the other side of the table all alone.\n\nYour personal injury lawyer’s experience and perspective can make a huge difference in reaching a favorable settlement. From the first meeting to discuss your case, they will be learning the individual elements of your particular claim and figuring out the best way to get a favorable settlement or verdict.\n\nAn attorney will bring their experience to assessing the value of your case and any settlement offers you receive.\n\nNegotiating Settlement Offers\n\nYou may know all the details of your injuries as well as anyone, but there are a lot of factors to consider when negotiating a settlement that may not occur to you. They will be second nature to your attorney.\n\nFor example, do you know how to calculate lost wages both during your recovery and potentially afterward if your injury will have a permanent impact? Are you aware that in some states, if a car insurance company rejects a reasonable offer to settle and goes on to lose the case, the company—not the driver—is required to pay all damages even in excess of the policy limit?\n\nThat means that if you and your attorney make a good faith offer to settle that’s below the limit, there’s an incentive for the insurance company to accept.\n\nIf you’re working with a personal injury attorney who specializes in one particular type of injury—as most personal injury lawyers do—they will have a lot of experience negotiating with various insurance companies. It’s even possible your lawyer will have a relationship with the insurance company lawyers, as well.\n\nThis isn’t to suggest any sort of improper arrangement, but more working together frequently can lead to a working relationship of respect and relatively fair dealing.\n\nFiling or Threatening a Personal Injury Lawsuit\n\nIf the initial settlement negotiations—often part of the claims process—fall through, the plaintiff really only has one recourse, and that is to file a lawsuit. Lawsuits can be expensive and time consuming, and generally insurance companies would prefer to avoid them.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there’s a legal team representing most insurers. Legal teams are not cheap, however, and the more time a case requires the more expensive it becomes.\n\nAs a non-attorney, the company may not be too worried about you filing a successful lawsuit on your own. If you have an experienced personal injury attorney working on your behalf, however, the threat to file a suit can become much more potent.\n\nIn order to file a personal injury lawsuit, you’ll need to first make sure that the time limit to file hasn’t passed. Each state has its own statute of limitations which sets the amount of time after an injury that you must file a lawsuit.\n\nSome states allow as little as one year to file your claim, though others allow as long as six years. Most states have statutes of limitations of two to three years for personal injury claims. If your injury involved a government entity like a police car or a military doctor, though, you may have to file much earlier since there are special protections in place for the government in legal proceedings.\n\nFinding an attorney and preparing your case promptly protects you from running out of time, but it also ensures that evidence won’t be lost or witnesses to forget details.\n\nHow and When Are Personal Injury Settlements Paid?\n\nIf you reach a settlement with an insurance company, you can expect the process—from start to finish—to take a little less than a year on average. According to one study, the average time between injury and settlement award is 11.2 months, though some received compensation in less than two months.\n\nIf you work with an attorney, your settlement will be sent to them. Many personal injury attorneys work on a contingent fee basis. This fee arrangement means that they will keep a percentage of your compensation, and if you don’t get any compensation, they simply don’t get paid."
