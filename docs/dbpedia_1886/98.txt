About The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ibarreta

Attending church each Sunday is a respite from fast-paced daily living. Attend church at Hipolito Irigoyen y Sarmiento to reflect, worship God, strengthen your spiritual connections, and focus on Jesus. Worship with a community of people who are trying to be more Christlike and learn from each other. There are two meetings in a two hour time. The main meeting is called sacrament meeting. This meeting consists of songs, prayers, and sermons (or “talks”) given by different members of the congregation and take the sacrament (or Communion). In addition to sacrament meeting, there are a variety of other classes for both children and adults. There’s something for everyone from 18 months old and up! Each meet together for a lesson and discussion that are based on a different section of scripture each week.
