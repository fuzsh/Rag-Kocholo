        "text": "To learn more about the Esri Landsat Viewer app, click About in the lower left corner of the app. You can also learn more about the Landsat program, jointly run by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, on the program's home page.\n\nThe app opens to the location of Esri headquarters in Redlands, California. You notice right away that the landscape does not appear in colors that look natural, the way they would appear to the human eye. The urban areas are light purple, while some of the vegetated areas are bright green. Why is that so?\n\nThe Landsat satellite imagery captures different ranges of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum, including some that are invisible to the human eye. Each range is stored separately in a spectral band and is particularly good at highlighting a type of landscape feature or property. The bands are described in the following table:\n\nBandNameWhat this band shows best\n\n1\n\nCoastal\n\nShallow water, fine dust particles\n\n2\n\nBlue\n\nDeep water, atmosphere\n\n3\n\nGreen\n\nVegetation\n\n4\n\nRed\n\nManufactured objects, soil, vegetation\n\n5\n\nNear Infrared (NIR)\n\nShorelines, vegetation\n\n6\n\nShortwave Infrared 1 (SWIR 1)\n\nCloud penetration, soil and vegetation moisture\n\n7\n\nShortwave Infrared 2 (SWIR 2)\n\nImproved cloud penetration, soil and vegetation moisture\n\n8\n\nCirrus\n\nCirrus clouds\n\nYou can then combine the bands into spectral band combinations.\n\nWith this new Natural Color band combination (bands 4, 3, and 2â€”or Red, Green, and Blue), you can see that the imagery is dominated by earth-colored tones. Together, the Red, Green, and Blue bands make up the spectrum of light visible to the human eye. Combining these three bands approximates how the landscape would look to a person.\n\nThe Natural Color band combination can be useful for some applications, but analysts often choose other band combinations based on the specific features they want to highlight. The toolbar on the left lists several common band combinations available in the app.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can also zoom in or out using the mouse's wheel button.\n\nJust from observing the area with the default Natural Color band combination, you can see a clear distinction between the heavily forested Sundarbans region and the highly urbanized city of Kolkata to the northwest. Much of the original mangrove forest was cut down, but what remains is protected by the Indian and Bangladeshi governments.\n\nSince satellites can't capture the entire world in one picture, they take multiple pictures that are then stitched together into a patchwork image called a mosaic. You may see the diagonal lines that divide different images. Also, because the images were taken at different dates and times, the color intensity may differ from one to the other.\n\nTo distinguish the mangrove vegetation more clearly, you'll use the Color Infrared band combination, which combines the bands 5, 4, and 3 (or Near Infrared, Red, and Green). The Near Infrared (NIR) band distinguishes very clearly between vegetation (high value) and nonvegetation features (low value). As you can see on the spectral profile graph below, typical Forest, Urban, and Water features have very different NIR values.\n\nHealthy vegetation appears bright red in the Color Infrared band combination.\n\nSince Landsat imagery is refreshed on a regular basis with more recent images (every two weeks on average), it could be that the most current image for an area of the Sundarbans happens to be a bit cloudy or hazy. If so, pan with the mouse to another area of the mangrove forest that appears clearer.\n\nNow you can see the mangrove forest in more detail. Over the broad delta region, the forest is broken up by several rivers and complex tidal waterways. Many of its small islands are accessible only by boat, which hinders on-the-ground observation and intensifies the need for satellite imagery to monitor the forest.\n\nHealthier vegetation appears brighter red, but some areas appear in a lighter shade of red or beige. As an analyst, you could identify these areas as containing potentially less healthy vegetation and needing further investigation.\n\nYou can see a sharp contrast where the protected mangrove area ends: the land in the nonprotected area was formerly covered with mangrove forest but has now been entirely deforested. It shows as mostly beige or light pink, signifying an absence of vegetation. As an analyst, you could use these differences in color to detect illegal tree logging activity in the protected areas.\n\nMangrove forests are highly susceptible to changes in sea level and water salinity, as well as pollution, illegal logging, and other factors. Loss of mangroves would not only compromise the habitat of the diverse species of flora and fauna that live there (including many endangered species, such as the Bengal tiger), but also remove an important shield against monsoons for the neighboring localities. It is important to maintain the health of the forest, and imagery can help do that.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Color Infrared band combination and the Agriculture band combination that you used earlier in the tutorial? Both are good at highlighting healthy vegetation (in bright red for Color Infrared and bright green for Agriculture). Color Infrared is a more common band combination that is available for many types of satellite and aerial imagery, as it only requires a Near Infrared (NIR) band, besides the green and red visible light bands. The Agriculture band combination is less common, because it requires not only a NIR band but also a Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) one. The presence of the SWIR band makes it better at capturing the soil and vegetation moisture level, and it is also better at penetrating clouds.\n\nThe boundaries of the oval-shaped desert are fairly clear, even when displayed in Natural Color. Since the Takla Makan Desert is primarily made up of sand dunes, its surface appears smooth and uniform from above, with few mountains or geological features. While the desert appears dry, you'll determine whether there are areas of moisture using the moisture index.\n\nWith Landsat imagery being updated on regular intervals, your images may appear different from the example images, due to cloud cover or seasonal weather patterns.\n\nBright white areas represent clouds, and there might be more or less of them in the current scene you are observing.\n\nUnlike Color Infrared, which was only a combination of three different spectral bands, the Moisture Index is a more sophisticated use of spectral bands. It is an index, which is a calculation that computes a ratio between different bands. In the case of Moisture Index, the bands involved are 5 (NIR) and 6 (SWIR 1), and the formula is as follows:\n\n(Band5-Band6)/(Band5+Band6)\n\nIf the NIR band value is higher than the SWIR 1 band value, the result of the formula will be a higher (positive) value, denoting a high moisture level. Otherwise, it will be a lower (negative) value, denoting a low moisture level. As you can see on the graph below, Lush Grass and Water features will typically result in a positive value, and Desert features in a negative value.\n\nOn the map, the Moisture Index shows moisture-rich areas in blue tones, and low moisture areas in orange tones. As expected, most of the Takla Makan Desert appears low moisture. However, the Moisture Index reveals several places that aren't as dry as they seemed with Natural Color. You'll ignore the darkest navy blue patches at the periphery, because they correspond to clouds (these are the clouds that were previously showing in white in the Natural Color view). Instead, you'll take a closer look at some of the medium blue patches, which signal actual ground-level moisture.\n\nTip:\n\nTo zoom to a specific extent, press the Shift key while you draw a box around the area you want to zoom to.\n\nYou zoom to a place labeled on the map as Shache.\n\nShache is an oasis settlement fed by a river that runs down the nearby mountains. The Moisture Index shows that this area has a fair amount of moisture overall (although the exact amount might vary depending on the season). The Moisture Index is a great tool for monitoring drought levels and measuring desertification trends.\n\nAs you zoomed in, the Shache area may have gone from medium blue to dark blue. The reason is that the colors are chosen based on the features that currently show on the map. When there was a high cloud presence, they were the highest moisture features and were showing in the darkest blue tones. Now that most of the clouds are outside the map extent, the Shache oasis becomes the highest moisture feature and is therefore colored in dark blue. This type of rendering is called Dynamic Range Adjustment or DRA.\n\nTo reveal what the moisture in the Shache area is being used for, you'll use the Agriculture band combination.\n\nAs seen in earlier sections, the Agriculture band combination (bands 6, 5, and 2, or SWIR 1, NIR, and Blue) highlights agriculture in bright green. Most of the moisture-rich area you saw when using the Moisture Index coincides with the agriculture presence that you now see in bright green. However, you can now also see the location of the river and tributary streams that irrigate this valley, clearly distinguished from the vegetated areas by their dark blue color.\n\nUsing different band combinations and indexes allows you to uncover different types of information in the imagery.\n\nIt's important to be judicious when making visual analysis of satellite imagery. For instance, the Moisture Index indicated some areas as moisture rich, simply due to the presence of clouds. Additionally, the Moisture Index could have missed areas with plentiful underground water that has not yet been tapped for agriculture. When done properly, interpretation of satellite imagery can uncover truths about the world, but it is important to understand its limitations as well.\n\nThe Time Line slider appears. The Time Line slider shows all available imagery from as far back in time as Landsat satellites captured imagery of this area, and it allows you to filter the imagery based on cloud cover or seasonality. The oldest image of this area, on the left of the timeline, is from September 19, 1984. Since Landsat imagery is updated periodically, the most recent image on the right may be different from the example image.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can drag the Time Line window to move it anywhere in the app to ensure it doesn't obstruct interesting features.\n\nWhen does the canal appear to be completed? How long did its construction take? Can you notice some changes in the agricultural methods used? By accessing the deep compendium of Landsat imagery, you can answer these questions, as well as other change-related questions across the world. Landsat imagery can track sea ice extent, lake water-level fluctuation, and urban development. It can also monitor seasonal changes, such as crop cycles and vegetation bloom. When combined with spectral band combinations, it increases the potential for imagery analysis even further.\n\nThe Build Your Own window appears. To create a band combination, you'll input the three bands to be combined. You can also adjust the stretch and gamma, which changes the contrast and brightness in the image. As a reminder, here is the list of the spectral bands available.\n\nNumber Name What this band shows best\n\n1\n\nCoastal\n\nShallow water, fine dust particles\n\n2\n\nBlue\n\nDeep water, atmosphere\n\n3\n\nGreen\n\nVegetation\n\n4\n\nRed\n\nManmade objects, soil, vegetation\n\n5\n\nNear Infrared (NIR)\n\nShorelines, vegetation\n\n6\n\nShortwave Infrared (SWIR) 1\n\nCloud penetration, soil and vegetation moisture\n\n7\n\nShortwave Infrared (SWIR) 2\n\nImproved cloud penetration, soil and vegetation moisture\n\n8\n\nCirrus\n\nCirrus clouds\n\nWhat bands should your combination use? It depends on what you want to see. For instance, if you want to emphasize vegetation, you can use the Near Infrared, Red, and Green bandsâ€”which happen to be the bands that make up the Color Infrared combination you used in the Sundarbans.\n\nThe imagery highlights vegetation as red, just as in the ready-made Color Infrared band combination. The order of the bands is also important, however. Because the human eye can only see the red, green, and blue ranges, those three bands (or channels) are the only ones that can be used to represent any spectral band combination. So, as you choose any three Landsat bands for your new combination, the first one will always be displayed through the Red channel, the second one through the Green channel, and the third one through the Blue channel. Together, they form a single composite image, as illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nYou'll now try the same bands in a different order."
