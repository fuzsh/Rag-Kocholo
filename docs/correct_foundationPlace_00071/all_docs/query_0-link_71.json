        "text": "Jack Dangermond wants to make the world a better place.\n\nAnd he’s found an answer at the intersection of maps and technology.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Dangermond, 68, has found a way to empower industry, government and the public using software to solve problems by analyzing information geographically.\n\nAnd as technology has boomed, so has his company.\n\nEsri has grown into a sprawling Redlands-based campus, 2,500 employees with a vision and scope that has gone global. Its revenue last year topped $1 billion.\n\nIf that massive scope wasn’t known before, it became more apparent last week, after Dangermond pledged $1 billion in mapping software to all of the nation’s K-12 schools to improve student aptitude in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM knowledge.\n\nThe way Dangermond sees it, the same mapping software that researchers or governments use to model climate change or predict flooding and crime is the same high school students in Detroit use to map areas of lead contamination in dilapidated housing. In that case, it led to removal of the toxic substance after the students were hired by the city to take care of the problem.\n\n“Right now we’re going in the wrong direction,” Dangermond said Friday. “I mean environmentally, with climate change, overpopulation, the loss of natural resources and nature, all of these are bad signs. What I want is that people get conscious and use geographic information so that they put down footprints which are more sensitive to sustainable life and more resilient cities.”\n\nConsumers are liking what they hear.\n\nEsri software, called ArcGIS, is used by practically every federal agency, more than 350,000 organizations globally, including the 200 largest cities in the nation, most other countries, more than two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies and more than 7,000 colleges and universities.\n\nEsri’s software is also a major part of law enforcement, where it forms the foundation for crime and fire mapping software used by law enforcement and public safety agencies nationwide. San Diego-based The Omega Group is a major supplier of this software.\n\n“They’ve been around for a very long time and they understand how geographic information systems work,” said Gabriela Coverdale, marketing director for The Omega Group, which she said helps law enforcement and public safety agencies analyze crime and fire data to determine the best operational tactical mission. “It makes it a lot easier for us to be able to integrate our products with theirs.”\n\nLin Wu, professor of geography and chair of the geography and anthropology department at Cal Poly Pomona, said ArkGIS is the preeminent software in the field.\n\nWu, who teaches students geographic information systems, has been using Esri’s software since 1989. Cal Poly students, she says, have gone on to work for the company.\n\n“Most government agencies, non-profit organizations, and some environmental management entities do use their software,” Wu said. “They do put a lot of effort to make it as user-friendly as possibly, so I think that makes the software popular, because people can use it.”\n\nIt’s a philosophy that has fueled Dangermond’s innovation from much humbler beginnings.\n\nEsri was founded in 1969, after Dangermond graduated with a landscape design degree at Cal Poly Pomona. He studied urban design at the University of Minnesota. Dangermond, who received his masters at Harvard, was a pioneer in the field of computational geography in the mid-1960s; he helped invent it at the Harvard laboratory for computer graphics and spatial analysis.\n\nHis company started out with consulting work to help government develop regional projects, and began selling its software in the early 1980s.\n\nLittle did he know then that he’d be meeting with people like President Barack Obama to discuss how his company could help the ConnectEd Initiative, a White House program designed to help strenghthen science and math education to students across the country.\n\nDangermond hopes the use of GIS will become more widespread as the gap between technology and everyday decision-making becomes ever smaller. He hopes the widespread and free use of the technology in the nation’s classrooms will be transformative, not just for the students, but for society as a whole.\n\n“Right now, the arrows are going in the wrong direction, and we’ve got to turn them around,” Dangermond said. “One way to do that is to build an ecosystem of geographic knowledge for the planet, a kind of nervous system for the planet, so as (people) move around, they’re guided by this higher level of consciousness about the environment. Environment is a subjective political thing nowadays. We need to bring it into science-based expressions of what’s going on, so we can make more rational decisions about the future. I see this as a guidance system for the evolution of our planet.”\n\nAnd then there’s Redlands, the town Esri is based in.\n\nOn first glance, Esri may seem like a piece of Silicon Valley. But for many, Esri has helped put Redlands on the map.\n\nRedlands leaders in business and government are thankful for the company’s continued presence in town, in addition to its founder’s commitment to remaining in his hometown community.\n\n“Esri has been a great asset to the city of Redlands,” said Mayor Pete Aguilar. “They’ve continually stepped up to help the city in a number of ways, but mainly, having a couple of thousand employees on their campus, contributing to the local economy is the biggest advantage to having ESRI in town.”\n\nKathie Thurston, executive director of the Redlands Chamber of Commerce, says Esri and the Dangermonds are an integral part of the fabric of the community.\n\n“Jack was born here and raised here, his roots are planted firmly here in Redlands, so why not (be based) here,” Thurston said. “To have such an extraordinary number of employees that feed into the community, who buy homes here, their children go to school here, and become contributing members of the community. His contributions have not just been providing an industry — it’s been on such a larger scale and scope for those in the community.”"
