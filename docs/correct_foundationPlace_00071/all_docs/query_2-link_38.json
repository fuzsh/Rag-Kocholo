This system is designed to provide instructive intelligence on flood impact to support flood emergency response. Streamflow forecast provided by the National Water Model is used to understand future flow condition. A terrain analysis workflow named GeoFlood has been developed to process the lidar-derived high-resolution terrain data, convert the flow conditions into corresponding flood maps and estimate the inundation risk of each building. Overlapping the inundation layer with the address point system gives decision makers and first responders insights to better organize the emergency response activities.\n\nPresenter\n\nDr. Xing Zheng, University of Texas at Austin Center of Water and Environment\n\nDr. Xing Zheng is a postdoctoral fellow who currently works at the Center of Water and the Environment of the University of Texas at Austin. During his PhD years as a member of Dr. David Maidment research group and Dr. Paola Passalacqua research group, he has been collaborated with National Weather Services and Texas Division of Emergency Management to develop large-scale GIS-based inundation mapping strategies and develop advanced terrain analysis methods to extract hydrological features from lidar datasets.\n\nWednesday, October 24, 11:30AM – 12:00PM, Li'l Tex\n\nThe incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in civil engineering projects has dramatically increased, resulting in a significant change on the progress of the industry. Adoption of these tools has amplified the need for 3D elevation modeling using methods like Structure from Motion (SfM) to create dense 3D point clouds; However, considerable limitations continue to exist to this approach, such as the inability to accurately map steep vertical terrain or small above ground features accurately such as powerlines, roof edges, curb and gutter, and above ground piping. Another common solution has been to utilize Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, and although accurate this process can be cost prohibitive in many cases. Through highly controlled testing and processing, we propose a third approach that integrates inexpensive UAS systems with stereographic compilation, a very old photogrammetric technique to extract 3D vector information with survey grade accuracy. Using both traditional photogrammetric workflows and principles, we are able to identify and correct variables affecting the error budget to consistently create an accurate mapping product faster than conventional survey at a cost-effective approach via drones. This presentation will discuss that research and approach as well as demonstrate some real-world examples of using this technique and accuracies using the ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards.\n\nPresenter\n\nChristian Stallings, McKim & Creed\n\nChristian Stallings oversees the unmanned aerial system and aerial LiDAR services as the research and development manager for McKim & Creed, Inc.

Using 2015 LiDAR data, the area, shading, aspect, and slope of each rooftop was assessed in ArcGIS Pro, allowing the City to provide the average solar potential to electric customers in an ArcGIS Online application. Uncovering this data enabled the electric department to apply for an innovation grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies to test a new concept – the virtual power plant. Georgetown is already using 100% renewable energy via wind and solar power contracts. However, by 2021 the peak electric demand will outpace supply. Current contracts have fixed prices for the next 20-25 years, but there are cost and reliability concerns due to long-distance transmission. The virtual power plant involves installing batteries and solar panels on homes within the city. Power would be produced locally on residential rooftops. Ultimately, the vision is an electric grid that improves service, reduces the impact of outages, provides protection against emergency weather and national security events, and keeps costs steady.\n\nPresenters\n\nJack Daly, City of Georgetown\n\nJack Daly began his career with the City of Georgetown in 2013 as an executive assistant to the assistant city manager.

Across the industry, public and private utility providers are making a transition from static paper or CAD based maps to interactive and up-to-date GIS systems. Technical journals are increasingly running articles singing the praises of GIS for delivering information to field crews and office-based decision makers, as well as tying into other business systems. But where does the data, the “lines on the map,” come from? All utilities must start somewhere. This presentation reviews the City of Rosenberg’s 3 year-long program to map its existing water, drainage, and sewer infrastructure in GIS. Although Rosenberg’s endeavor dealt specifically with utilities, the presentation will focus more generally on the following points: The benefits of deliberate, thoughtful, GIS project design.

The Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute (NRI) has created smart phone apps using Survey123 from ESRI with public participation in-mind. These apps allow stakeholders to get involved in data collection by reporting species-specific sightings and other related information, which help inform important wildlife management and research projects at NRI. Our first app was created to allow locals in the Florida Keys to document sightings of the endangered Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) following Hurricane Irma, a Category 4 storm when the eye passed through the center of the Key deer’s range. This app enabled users to report real-time data on deer location, condition, and age, among other factors. Researchers can now use this data to better perform rapid population assessments and make immediate-response management recommendations to wildlife managers. The second app developed by NRI allows Texans to report wild pig (Sus scrofa) sightings and/or damage on private properties. As Texas is 95% privately owned, landowner involvement in wild pig data collection is vital. This data serves to better target extension outreach efforts to specific issues reported in affected counties.\n\nPresenter\n\nMatt Crawford, Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute\n\nMatt Crawford is a GISP and is a member on the Geospatial Data Analytics Team at the Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute.

This presentation details how resource limitations, common in both private and public organizations, spurred the iterative development of an automated extract-transform-load process. As additional hurdles were encountered, the technical implementation swung from pure python to pure SQL and ended at a python-SQL mix that plays hard, fast, and breaks the rules for ArcSDE (10.3). The final script is deceptively short and belies the more transformational portion of this odyssey; the necessity of soft skills and coming to terms with not being the best at everything. This is the story of a database, an SDE, and a boy that tried to get them together.\n\nPresenter\n\nJordan Carmona, City of McKinney\n\nJordan Carmona leads the geospatial program across four departments at the City of McKinney’s Development Services Division as a GIS Specialist.

One of the most popular options is the Managed Lands Deer Program (MLDP), which in part provides landowners with a deer harvest recommendation created specifically for their property along with the state’s most flexible deer hunting season. In recent years, the success and growth of the MLD Program has challenged the department’s capacity to serve their customers. (2) Geospatial data and technology have allowed TPWD to scale up these services and engage with landowners and representatives more effectively and efficiently. (3) This project modernized a legacy application and workflow, allowing TPWD customers, managers, and scientists to share and interact with valuable spatially referenced data from any web-enabled, connected device in real-time.\n\nPresenters\n\nJenn Sylvester, AppGeo\n\nJenn Sylvester Lash is a Project Manager with AppGeo, based here in Austin.\n\nChris Serny, TPWD\n\nChris Cerny is a Big Game Program Manager within the Wildlife Division of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.\n\nWednesday, October 24, 4:30 – 5:00PM, Li'l Tex\n\nThe Edwards Aquifer of Central Texas is home to eight threatened and endangered species that are susceptible to pressures from extreme drought, flooding, and population growth. The Edwards Aquifer Habitat Conservation Plan is a complex, multifaceted regional program that seeks to protect the vulnerable species of the aquifer to ensure their longevity during severe drought-of-record conditions. Since 2013, contractors have worked to restore and improve aquatic and terrestrial habitat in the Comal and San Marcos springs communities. Although the EAHCP annual report details the successes and challenges faced, there exists a need to reach a broader audience. ESRI’s Story Maps have proved a useful platform for documenting and sharing comprehensive habitat restoration information. The mobile-friendly, interactive features of this project help educate and increase awareness of past, present, and future restoration efforts for the endangered species of the Edwards Aquifer.\n\nPresenter\n\nKristina Tolman, Edwards Aquifer Authority\n\nKristina Tolman currently works as a Habitat Conservation Plan Coordinator in the Threatened and Endangered Species Department of the Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA).

Our objective was to create a baseline dataset on land cover change in the historical distribution of SSOP that facilitates future investigations into how vegetation heterogeneity could have shaped lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) habitat and population demography in the SSOP. We analyzed historical maps and documentation prior to the 1930s and remotely sensed data (aerial photography and satellite imagery) collected from 1930 to 2015. Land cover and land use maps from 19th and 20th centuries were digitized into a Geographic Information System. The presence of sand shinnery oak (Quercus harvardii), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) and grasses was identified through photo interpretation of canopy shape and texture information in 120 aerial photomosaics from 1930-1970 that were acquired for 22 sites within the study region. Distribution of the SSOP was analyzed using satellite imagery (Landsat time series) from 1975 to 2015. For New Mexico, results show that sand shinnery oak, sand sagebrush and grass associations have been reduced from an approximate potential extent of ~1,800,000 ha by the late19th century (mostly Lea, Eddy, Chaves and Roosevelt counties) to ~900,000 ha in 1977 and then to ~600,000 by 2015, with decreasing dominance of sand shinnery oak in the last 40 years. In Texas, sand shinnery oak prairies have been reduced to less than 25% of its historical potential extent (from 2,000,000 ha to 430,000 ha). We discuss methodological challenges in the mapping process and propose GIS-based methodologies to detect emerging trends in ecosystem loss based on time series of Landsat imagery.\n\nPresenter\n\nCarlos Portillo-Quintero, Texas Tech University\n\nCarlos Portillo-Quintero is a biologist specializing in the application of GIS and remote sensing technologies for biodiversity conservation.

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and a geographic information system (GIS) can be used by members of the public to manage the sustainability, resiliency, and environmental impact of their property while reducing cost of operation and/or increase profits with a Creative Shared Value™. 2. A history of fire suppression and overgrazing in Texas have caused conditions favorable for Ashe Juniper (Juniperus ashei) to convert grassland to woodland and dominate previously open areas, thus decreasing the foraging value of the land. Many central Texas landowners now clear Ashe Juniper to preserve valuable open areas. 3. Our process will use UAS to identify encroaching Ashe Juniper saplings and automatically mark a waypoint within a personal GIS to aid in sapling removal. The project will result in a tool available to interested individuals who seek to manage their land for an affordable price and develop a GIS that can be transferred to future owners of the property.\n\nPresenter\n\nAndrew Vanderheiden, Texas A&M University\n\nAndrew Vanderheiden is an undergraduate student studying Environmental Geosciences and GIST at Texas A&M University in College Station.
