        "text": "American billionaire businessman\n\nJack Dangermond (born 1945) is an American billionaire businessman and environmental scientist, who in 1969 co-founded, with Laura Dangermond, the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), a privately held geographic information systems (GIS) software company.[1] As of July 2023, his net worth was estimated at US$9.3 billion.[2]\n\nDangermond, Esri's president, works at its headquarters in Redlands, California. He founded the company to perform land-use analysis; however, its focus evolved into GIS-software development, highlighted by the release of ARC/INFO in the early 1980s. The development and marketing of ARC/INFO positioned Esri with the dominant market share among GIS-software developers. Esri's flagship product, ArcGIS, traces its heritage to Dangermond's initial efforts in developing ARC/INFO.\n\nDangermond grew up in Redlands, the son of Dutch immigrants.[3] His parents owned a plant nursery in the town.[4] Dangermond attended Redlands High School.\n\nDangermond completed his undergraduate degree in landscape architecture at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.[4][5] He then earned a Master in Urban Planning from the University of Minnesota, and a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 1969.[4] His early work in the school's Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (LCGSA) led directly to the development of Esri's ARC/INFO GIS software. He has been awarded 13 honorary doctoral degrees.\n\nIn December 2017, Jack and Laura Dangermond donated $165 million to establish the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve on the Pacific coast—the largest ever gift to The Nature Conservancy.[6][7]\n\nJack and Laura Dangermond have signed The Giving Pledge.[8]\n\nIn January 2020, Jack and Laura Dangermond donated $3 million to the Museum of Redlands fund.[9]\n\nIn 2005, Jack helped Duane Marble establish the American Association of Geographers Marble Fund for Geographic Science.[10] This fund serves to advance GIScience education by providing awards to undergraduate and graduate student research.[10] These awards include the \"Marble-Boyle Undergraduate Achievement Award,\" \"William L. Garrison Award for Best Dissertation in Computational Geography,\" and the \"Marble Fund Award for Innovative Master's Research in Quantitative Geography.\"[11][12][13]\n\nDangermond has received many awards, including:\n\nOfficier in de Orde van Oranje Nassau [14]\n\nHorwood Distinguished Service Award of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association in 1988[15]\n\nJohn Wesley Powell Award of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1996\n\nAnderson Medal of the Association of American Geographers in 1998[16]\n\nCullum Geographical Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1999\n\nEDUCAUSE Medal of EduCause\n\nHonorary doctorate from the University of West-Hungary in 2003\n\nCarl Mannerfelt Gold Medal of the International Cartographic Association in 2007\n\nHonorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota in 2008[17]\n\nPatron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 2010.[18]\n\nAlexander Graham Bell Medal of the National Geographic Society in 2010, together with Roger Tomlinson.[19][20]\n\nFellow of the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science in 2012[21]\n\nRecipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award (Champions of the Earth) in 2013.[22]\n\nAudubon Medal of the National Audubon Society in 2015[23][24]\n\nGeographic information science – scientific discipline that studies the techniques to capture, represent, process, and analyze geographic informationPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n\nMichael Frank Goodchild – British-American geographer\n\nNational Center for Geographic Information and Analysis\n\nTechnical geography – Study of using and creating tools to manage spatial information\n\nQualitative geography – Subfield of geographic methods\n\nQuantitative geography – Subfield of geographic methods\n\nUniversity Consortium for Geographic Information Science"
