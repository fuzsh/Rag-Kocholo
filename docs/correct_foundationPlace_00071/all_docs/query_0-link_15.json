        "text": "Carmelle Terborgh gets a little tired of explaining to people why geography excites her.\n\n“Sometimes you tell people, ‘I’m a geographer,’ ” Terborgh said, “and people say, ‘So, you know where all the capitals are.’ You try not to be offended.”\n\nTerborgh said she does, in fact, know where the capitals are. She also knows that a map can do more than pinpoint a city or tell you how to get from one place to another.\n\nMaps can save people’s lives, she said.\n\nTerborgh oversees international organizations for Esri, the Redlands-based company known worldwide for its geographic information systems — or GIS. Clients often use the computer maps it produces for such things as analyzing demographics, weather patterns and environmental changes. Terborgh, who works out of her home in Vermont, uses them to help relief agencies determine where resources are most needed.\n\nEsri started doing such work not long after its founding in 1969. But it wasn’t until 20 years ago that it formed a division, with Terborgh as director, specifically devoted to humanitarian work.\n\nOne example of that work is underway in Haiti, the island nation in the eastern Caribbean that is one of the poorest countries in the world. There, a former Redlands resident is using GIS technology to try to make a difference.\n\nImportance of maps\n\nNadege Bellande Robertson, 47, a graduate of Redlands High School and the University of Redlands, has been living in Haiti since 1994. In 2001, she took the helm of Foundation Espoir, a nonprofit organization founded by her mother. Now, the daughter of former Redlands Symphony conductor Jon Robertson is also Esri’s Haiti representative. For the past two years, she’s been building GIS maps of the country — maps that are sorely needed.\n\nWhen a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the nation in 2010, emergency and aid workers scrambled to figure out where to send resources. Buildings were flattened. Unreinforced concrete-block homes packing the hillsides collapsed into rubble. More than 300,000 people were reported dead or missing.\n\nWhat little infrastructure the country had was pretty much destroyed and there were no decent maps of Port au Prince, the capital city, let alone its outlying cities.\n\nDavid Gadsden, who manages the global nonprofit outreach of Esri out of its Redlands office, said the lack of good information crippled the response to the disaster.\n\n“We couldn’t even begin to understand the context and how to allocate our resources,” Gadsden said.\n\nAid workers didn’t know who had what, how to get supplies or support from one place to another or who to call.\n\nDespite having several years to improve the situation, when Hurricane Matthew blasted through the island nation last October, things weren’t much better.\n\nRobertson is trying to change that.\n\nPrior to the big earthquake, she and her foundation had been focused on supporting schools and health clinics and on providing support for small business startups. She knew little to nothing about GIS.\n\nNot long after the earthquake, she left the island with plans to pursue a master’s degree in communications. During a brief stay in Redlands, she attended a presentation on GIS. It’s potential immediately struck her, she said.\n\n“I said, ‘Good god, that’s the only way we can rebuild Haiti,’ ” Robertson said. “I knew that those tools were what the country needed not only to get on track but to leapfrog, to start using this knowledge to predict and change instead of just being able to react.”\n\nShe and her working partner, Daniel Birame Gueye, 42, a computer mapping expert, are hoping Haiti’s recently elected administration will come on board and utilize the data they have compiled. They feel they are on the cusp of making a real difference in country.\n\nBeyond Haiti\n\nGadsden — the manager of Esri’s global outreach division — said such efforts are happening in many developing nations. The efforts and the positive results continue to grow, he said.\n\n“This is a natural extension of our values as a company,” Gadsden said. “It is a global good that Esri takes very seriously.”\n\nWhen Terborgh consolidated the existing nonprofit outreach — mostly focused on environmental efforts — 20 years ago, she added a humanitarian dimension.\n\n“It started as a result of my inability to say no,” Terborgh said.\n\nShe was already partnering with some organizations through the United Nations, many of which were involved with large nongovernment organizations such as World Vision. The benefits of good mapping for those operations seemed clear to her. It became evident to her clients as well.\n\n“It just kept growing,” she said.\n\nEsri has been involved in such projects as the Gates Foundation’s polio eradication program, relief efforts in the wake of such disasters as the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and even smaller projects, such as making it easier for rural women in Madagascar to get pre-natal and maternal supplements.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration has been able to use GIS information to help anticipate where resources might be needed in the Syrian refugee crisis, Terborgh said.\n\nSuch organizations, she said, are “able to use our predictive analysis tools to define where people are expected to show up.”\n\nHow it works\n\nEsri uses everything from satellite imagery to people on the ground entering data on cellphones, creating multilayered maps that are sometimes updated in real time.\n\nGadsden said that when he worked with the Gates Foundation on its polio vaccine effort in northern Nigeria, it was difficult to know which communities had been vaccinated and which had not. Many of the villages had fewer than 20 people in them. The village names were often unknown, or had multiple spellings.\n\nEsri helped create a grid of the region, assigning either red or green colors to the individual elements in the grid. When volunteers moved through an area and inoculated a village, they recorded it on their cellphones.\n\n“If they missed an area, it turned red,” Gadsden said. “If they went through, it turned green. That map was used to help advise the vaccination planning team about where the team should go.”\n\nIn Tanzania, he said, a survey on child vulnerability is creating maps to help kids get what they need, he said.\n\n“It’s not only malnutrition,” he said, “it’s access to education and basic health services and mosquito nets.”\n\nTerborgh said Esri is also working with organizations who are trying to address the looming famine in East Africa.\n\n“We’re partnering with the World Health Organization,” Terborgh said. “We’re trying to put together a story map to communicate the impacts and where the need is so that organizations can raise funds.”\n\nShe compared the situation to the Ethiopian famine of 1984-1985 that generated the Live Aid effort.\n\n“That was nothing compared to this,” she said. “One half of the people Somalia are in need.”\n\nGadsden likens GIS maps as “a nervous system for the planet.” But there are holes in the system, particularly in developing countries in Africa, areas of South America and in places like Haiti.\n\n“What Nadege (Robertson) is doing is critical,” said Gadsden, who was in Haiti immediately following the 2010 earthquake and recalls. “No one could find any maps. So, we couldn’t even begin to understand the context and how to allocate our resources.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nRobertson said GIS is already being used effectively. One town, hard hit by Hurricane Matthew, had used mapping information she provided to formulate a disaster plan ahead of time.\n\n“After the storm, they knew immediately how many houses were down,” she said. “They were able to actually get aid because they had an acute assessment of what was needed in this community. They had a clinic where there were a couple of cases of cholera. They were able to identify and go out to the water source that was contaminated.”\n\nDisaster response is an important use of GIS, but Robertson and others see it as just the beginning to improving a country like Haiti. The information gleaned from identifying the characteristics and resources of the country, down to the neighborhood level, holds tremendous potential for action.\n\n“We can begin talking about agriculture, security, housing,” Robertson said. “The onus is on us to start using these tools from water management to storm management.”\n\nShe has been in talks with the new government about utilizing the data she and Gueye have compiled.\n\n“I think I’m very close actually,” she said. “There are bright and dedicated and quite well-trained specialists on different levels (of the administration). The time is now to keep pushing and showing the efficacy of the tools.”\n\nThose tools are already making a difference for Robertson and the Haitians she’s trying to help, as well as many others around the world.\n\nTerborgh believes the benefits will grow.\n\n“I’d like to see some serious diseases eradicated,” she said. “I’d like to see some good detections systems in place for things like the Ebola virus. I’d like to see land-mine removal in places where we can make a difference.”\n\nHumanitarian agencies, she said, “are able to figure out where they should put their resources and where they can save the most lives. It’s amazing what we can do now.”"
