        "text": "Asset and network management\n\nVodafone map ‘experiment’ set for enterprise adoption\n\nDriven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, Vodafone engineers created a geospatial digital twin of its Britain cellular network using ArcGIS technology. They discovered that the solution enabled virtual site visits, enhanced capacity planning, and created many other operational efficiencies. Vodafone now plans to roll out ArcGIS-powered digital twins in 12 markets across Europe.\n\nPolicy and transparency\n\nMontana ensures equitable distribution of funds\n\nWith $900 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to spend strategically, Montana’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation turned to ArcGIS. Maps and dashboards added transparency to the distribution of economic stimulus funds, showing where projects had been selected across the state. This ensured funds were equitably divided and helped simplify the complex proposal process for grant applicants.\n\nUrban planning and development\n\nVienna designs a city within a city\n\nIn one of Europe’s largest urban development projects, Vienna is transforming a derelict airfield into aspern Seestadt—one of Europe’s most dynamic planned communities and a test bed for smart city initiatives. As aspern Seestadt takes shape, ArcGIS has become a powerful integrated tool for planners and architects, providing a common virtual meeting space for project-related data. Maps and dashboards facilitate collaboration among public and private partners. A 3D geospatial digital twin helps measure progress and explore future scenarios to enhance sustainability.\n\nNatural resource management\n\nOrganic Valley optimizes pastures for sustainable dairy\n\nOrganic Valley, the largest farmer-owned organic cooperative in the US, uses custom maps and satellite imagery to improve grazing management and pasture health for their cows. A combination of ArcGIS tools and satellite imagery provides farmers with accurate pasture condition reports. The reports are highly automated and include information on paddock health, available biomass, and grazing recommendations. ArcGIS helps the co-op optimize milk production and promote environmental stewardship in organic dairy farming.\n\nRisk analytics and mitigation\n\nMarriott builds a Risk Atlas for safer travels\n\nMarriott International, a hotel brand operating in 139 countries with almost 8,700 properties, relies on a comprehensive risk assessment tool known as Risk Atlas for guest safety. Built with ArcGIS, Risk Atlas analyzes data from diverse sources like news reports, social media chatter, and meteorological information to evaluate threat levels by location. The map format makes it easy to share data across the enterprise, from real estate teams to security managers. Reliable alerts enable Marriott to make informed decisions to protect guests and assets, ensuring business continuity.\n\nTransportation and logistics\n\nFedEx manages maintenance on its global fleet of airplanes\n\nTo keep hundreds of FedEx planes flying, the right repair parts must be in the right place at the right time. ArcGIS is integrated with the FedEx maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) system, delivering timely intelligence about where planes, parts, and mechanics are, so repairs don’t lead to costly breakdowns and delays. Executives, pilots, mechanics, and flight planners can view global dashboards with real-time information on plane schedules and performance. ArcGIS empowers the FedEx team to maintain airplane health and availability, ultimately ensuring the on-time deliveries customers expect."
