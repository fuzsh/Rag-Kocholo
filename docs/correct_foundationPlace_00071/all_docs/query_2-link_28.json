        "text": "The Redlands, California-based global mapping and locational intelligence firm announced during the USGIF 20th Annual Symposium that they would be locating in The Globe Building in downtown St. Louis.\n\nShe further told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “a lot of synergy is coming together in The Globe Building,”\n\nMims was announcing that Esri would be the latest Geospatial Intelligence firm to locate its offices in St. Louis’ newest innovation district – the Downtown North Insight District: https://downtownnorthstl.com/\n\nThe Globe’s and the District’s proximity to the new NGA-St. Louis HQ campus (opening in the first quarter of 2026) are unique locational advantages, and have already helped lure other top geospatial companies to locate at The Globe in downtown St. Louis – firms such as General Dynamics, MAXAR, Ball Aerospace, and the U.S. HQ of Sweden-based T-Kartor have each “planted their flags” in the high-tech renovation of the 720,000 square foot Art Deco Globe Building.\n\nComplementing these Geospatial Intelligence firms, Westway Enterprises, LLC, also recently opened a 75,000 square foot multi-tenant SCIF in The Globe Building as well. The new SCIF is just one of three such facilities in the U.S. (the other two being in the Washington, D.C. area).\n\nAmong the 4,000 public and private sector leaders participating in the USGIF “From Maps to Metaverse” Symposium was NGA Director Vice Admiral Frank D. Whitworth, who took the occasion to formally name the 100-acre, $1.75-billion, 3,100-job National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) new HQ “NGA –St. Louis.”\n\nIn his opening keynote address to Symposium participants, Admiral Whitworth observed, “St. Louis is the place to be if you want to position yourself at the future of GEOINT.”\n\nSt. Louis Public Radio carried an online headline summarizing the NGA Director’s keynote address, which clearly reflected the Admiral’s declaration; namely, “St. Louis’ New Geospatial Identity Is Emerging, And People Across The Country Are Noticing.”\n\nThe new center city NGA HQ campus is just blocks from the Downtown North Insight District, which in addition to The Globe Building, also includes The Post Building, a 226,000 square foot high-tech artful renovation of the former St. Louis Post-Dispatch HQ; along with the GEOINT incubator and NGA Moon Shot Labs at T-Rex; and the 572,000 square foot America’s Center Convention Center (the location for the USGIF Symposia in 2021, 2023, and 2025).\n\nBecause of its sophisticated technology features, The Globe Building has been dubbed a “High Tech Castle” and, as the “Location of Choice for Geospatial and Other Tech Firms” because of the high-tech adaptive renovation of this former major rail- road station, which ironically once also served as one of NGA’s predecessors during World War II, housing a staff of over 500 map makers for the U.S. Aeronautical Chart Plant facility.\n\nRegarding the continuing evolution of St. Louis in Geospatial Intelligence, GEOINT leader Keith Masback, the decade-long CEO of USGIF, now an angel investor and international geospatial advisor posited, “At the very heart of the origin of the term ‘geospatial intelligence’ was a vision to achieve powerful synergies by combining remote sensing, geospatial data and information, data analysis, and data visualization.”\n\nMasback concluded, “In St. Louis, this has been realized at The Globe Building, and Esri will both contribute in an impactful way and benefit significantly by joining the community in The Globe Building.”\n\nIn this regard, Esri’s Mims observed, “Having all those companies in the same building, the hallway conversations, the lunches, the impromptu meetings, as well as the formal meetings we’ll be putting together is just another way of building that community.”\n\nAnother Symposium speaker, Sanjay Kumar, Founder and CEO of Geospatial World, underscored the continued growth and scope of this global geospatial cluster. Citing his firm’s newly- published GEOBUIZ 23 Report, Global Geospatial Industry Market Size, Forecast and Growth Trends, Kumar noted, the space and geospatial profession is fast evolving as an industry in itself, with an estimated market size of $512.5 billion in 2023, a market cap of $1.7 trillion, and an economic impact of $7.5 trillion worldwide in 2023.\n\nReferencing the economic impact of the GEOINT sector, Kumar opined that an anticipated $1.37 trillion geospatial industry by 2030 would have a projected overall economic impact of approximately $30 trillion.\n\nRegions throughout the U.S. and throughout the world – including St. Louis – are aspiring to become Global Geospatial Intelligence Hubs, and to capture their share of this prospective $1.37 trillion market and overall $30 trillion economic impact.\n\nAs St. Louis pursues this goal, it continues to demonstrate that it has the unique assets needed for GEOINT growth, to highlight ways in which the St. Louis GEOINT ecosystem has added capacity to meet the needs of Geospatial companies, and to highlight the world-class quality of life amenities and affordability of St. Louis"
