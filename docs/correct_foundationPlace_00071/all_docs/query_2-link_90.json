        "text": "Di Milano Nail Spa\n\nWe got a lot customer from the post you made on IG and FB. I am so thankful for your service!!\n\n226 Collective\n\nWe primarily signed up as a thank you for previous referrals, and to have our business listed in the directory. We are currently near fully booked for the the first 2 quarters, so we are not doing any active marketing at this time. All that to say that there's no need to post about us on social. Thank you!\n\nDirtbag Shop\n\nI always talk about you guys to local business owners and the first thing I usually ask is if they are a part of About Redlands. They usually know who you are, but I have experienced a few that don’t. My best explanation is that you guys help promote Redlands businesses and when they ask how I explain the different ways you do whether it’s through the directory, events, stories, feed and IGTV.\n\nI always mention how great you guys are at suggesting new ways of getting out there, especially since I am a new business. Since you guys have been updating daily on any new news for businesses during this time I mention that now and how you guys helped me.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t know who to ask and since you guys have so much contact with Redlands businesses you were the first one I thought of!\n\nThank you again for your help with everything. When all of this is over, I’m definitely going to increase my membership.\n\nAngela\n\nThree Sisters Farm\n\nI've been meaning to thank you for continuing to let folks know about the Grove Market. Despite the negative comments (which there are always bound to be), we are finally getting the exposure and traffic that we have hoped for. The vendors are so thankful to have an outlet for our produce and are happy to be selling in the sunshine and open air to customers who appreciate having access fresh fruit and vegetables. Thanks again for your service, we really appreciate your voice! Abby Harned\n\nPower Plant & Nekter\n\nKeep up the great work you do for local businesses in town. You have an amazing platform. Gagan Batta owner.\n\nClark’s Nutrition & Natural Foods Market\n\nYou have the pulse on the community and enough followers and engagement to make us want to connect-as we know people are interacting with the content we provide when it comes from AR. Mike Barnett, Marketing Director\n\nAngel's Closet Charities\n\nJust a note to let you know Eureka Burger has contacted us regarding their 10 year Anniversary - Angels' Closet Charities being selected as the Charity to benefit from the event on June 24. I can't thank you enough for the referral as it means so much to us to raise the funds to help the kids. I will send you the flyer when we receive it - or they may contact you not sure. Thank you so very much for all the help and support you have given us - it means a lot! Pat\n\nJoshua Northcott - Hounder & Co\n\nThank you for the referral! We love you all.\n\nTory Jones of Ixchel Triangle\n\nOur pop up event last weekend was a huge success. Hundreds of people turned out to support our local businesses. I had at least a dozen customers tell me they came down after seeing our Instagram live on About Redlands and even more who came after seeing your posts about our event. We have a nice social media following, but it's so important to reach our local community through social media especially for events and About Redlands has that!\n\nCathy Nobles Schmidt - resident\n\nI am so thankful for all of your information and keeping us informed!\n\nWelsh Insurance Services\n\nWe set an appointment off the IG ad you ran! Boom! Thank you! Scott\n\nSimple Touch - Interior Solutions\n\nWe just opened and are located off the beaten path. Most of our walk-in traffic has been from your site. THANK YOU! Nicole Trozzi\n\nJoe Ayers\n\nI love your \"About Redlands\" and your enthusiasm to educating us on all things Redlands. Redlands resident\n\nActive Life Chiropractic\n\nI received a new patient the very first month I signed up! After the recent Instagram post I received a lot of new followers and a new patient. Thank you! Dale Andelkovic\n\nLaura's Travel Service\n\nThe team at AR are totally committed to the business community of Redlands! She too is a small business and is all about helping the rest of us getting the exposure we need and don't have enough time or expertise to do ourselves. Her membership fee is money well spent! Owner Lynda Creatura Schauf\n\nCitrone Restaurant & Bar\n\nYou do great work. I have lived in Redlands my whole life. I am fourth generation Redlands. I bleed this town and love our business community. Your promotion and assistance to others is consistent, fair, and extremely beneficial. I enjoy reading what you write about others and especially for those very small, boutique companies, your service is tremendous. Thanks for what you do. Brandon Pearce\n\nSister Sister Rescue\n\nI love love LOVE about Redlands!!! It is my GO TO for all things Redlands. It is a very organized, and up to date site, that really keeps the community, and those visiting informed. Redlands is a special place, in a world gone crazy, we still have our gorgeous mountains, orange groves, local business, and small town charm. Also, my non-profit (Sister Sister Rescue) has been supported by About Redlands, and it has made our efforts to help local homeless animals even more fruitful. Never change Redlands! Thank you to those who work to preserve and improve our town. Allie Johnson\n\nKathy Behrens\n\nThis is the ONE PLACE to go to get the skinny on what's happening in and around Redlands. Which, by the way, is a #coolplacetovisit with #lotstodo including #gorgeousscenery #greatlocalfood and #uniqueshopping. I may be biased 'cause I live here, but having traveled nearly 10,000 miles through countless small towns across America this past year, I don't think so. Redlands rocks! #smalltowngetaway #notlosangeles\n\nKrystle Roth\n\nBest spot to find out what's happening in Redlands!!! What's new, upcoming events, Grand openings etc. Also great place to Advertise your personal business!!! Agent - Berkshire Hathaway Perrie Mundy Group\n\nThe Energy Lab\n\nAbout Redlands has given our community a home for news, services, local events and everything going on in our town! I love that it helps anyone new to the area or visiting, find the activities they might be looking for and that it serves our local businesses! It keeps our small town feeling close and our community feeling connected! Jill Ruth Rooks - owner\n\nKaley Orland\n\nThe best resource for all Redlands events and information. I always check the AboutRedlands page and website when looking for fun date ideas or things to do in town! Recent grad of U of R!!\n\nShoulder to Shoulder Communications\n\nAbout Redlands is a site created by a resident who knows what Redlanders need and want. It's everything in one spot, and like most community products, it's done with heart. This is a business that supports local businesses with honesty and enthusiasm, and gives freely of space and skill to the nonprofits that keep the town churning. If you're not taking advantage of the opportunity as a client, you're doing yourself a disservice; if you're not taking advantage as a Redlander, you're out of the loop. Toni Momberger - co owner\n\nShannon Leeton Rankin\n\nOh how I love About Redlands! As a client, it is by far THE best marketing tool around! My business increased virtually overnight when I signed on last year (no exaggeration!). Deborah is the most professional, relatable, easiest person to work with, who truly cares about peoples' success. As a subscriber, I am never left wondering what is going on in our little town. AR keeps everyone up-to-date on weekend activities, events, dining, and everything in between. I look forward to every post. So happy I stumbled upon this gem!\n\nEscape Craft Brewery\n\nLove About Redlands. Both as a business owner and a Redlands resident. Keeps us in the loop of what's going on around us, and keeps a small town feel even if the city is growing. Keep up the great job. Josh Fisher\n\nDarby's American Cantina\n\nI want you to know that I very much appreciate the hard work you do for all of Redlands Businesses. You are a huge help for us. Effective today I would like to upgrade to a Gold membership for Darby's. Thanks again, Jon Darby (Gold partner)\n\nPlayworks\n\nTHANK YOU for sharing our job flyers. I received about 25 inquiries and hired 2 college students to share the office assistant position at Playworks. FYI most of the applicants heard about it through your Instagram page. You have a much larger reach than we do, particularly since FB holds back the business page posts for a paid boost. Kelli Wilms\n\nRebecca Hawkins YMCA OF THE EAST VALLEY\n\nAs a local resident, I’ve been using AboutRedlands for a while so I was really excited to hear that you work with the Redlands Y providing inkind promotional support! (Gold Partner)\n\nBruce Herwig\n\nI wanted to let you know that the About Redlands photo contests has been such a blessing in my life. It gave me the confidence to get out there, show my stuff and make a calendar available for sale. It's added a joy and \"pride\" in my work that I didn't have before. Thank you. (Orange partner)\n\nLa Volata Pizzeria\n\nWithin one week of partnering with About Redlands we saw an increase in traffic. Tuesdays are slow days for us and that Tuesday, following the sign up and posts on the About Redlands network, 4 parties came in and told us they saw us on About Redlands. What we spent for the year to partner with About Redlands was redeemed that night. Thank you! Chris Driscoll More here (Bronze partner)\n\nBernardini & Donovan Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nI just want to say that we really appreciate your support of our business. About Redlands has been great for us. We are grateful. Adrian Donovan (Gold Partner)\n\nBarich and Associates Marketing Services, Inc.\n\nI want to give a big thank you to About Redlands.. They have been such a help with Marketing Barich and Associates Marketing Services, Inc... For all local business owners if you aren't using About Redlands you should look into it. Thanks again guys for all the help and support!!! 2014 Megan Barich (Gold Partner)\n\nScott Sames- Christian Handyman\n\nAboutRedlands.com has been a positive advertising purchase for Scott Sames, Christian Handyman. We get inquiries about 2 times a month. The first call we get has already paid for the price of the advertising package we purchased. Some of the jobs that have come from this site, have resulted in repeated business and further referrals. We highly recommend using the site to further your business exposure. (Silver partner)\n\nUltimate Carpet Care\n\nThe last time you posted something about us on Facebook we got a good few phone calls from it. Thank you! Ramez-Christina Kiriakos\n\nElizabeth\n\nI moved back to Redlands 3 days ago and this site has been very helpful. Thank you.\n\nPress-Enterprise\n\nI reference AboutRedlands.com daily to find out what's going on in Redlands. Thank you, it's a great resource. Reporter- PE\n\nESRI\n\nI follow AboutRedlands quite a bit via Facebook and have even tried my hand at one of your photo competitions several months back. I know a lot of the people at ESRI who are new to Redlands use your website quite often to find things to do, see, eat, etc. Scott\n\nNew Resident\n\nHello About Redlands!\n\nI've spent a lot of time in Redlands over the past few years but moved here permanently just weeks ago, so this is a great welcome to Redlands and your Facebook page has provided great information on local happenings and businesses. I didn't miss Parliament Chocolate's opening this past weekend due to your posting--what a great local group of people opening a shop I'll be sure to visit.\n\nThank you!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nTara\n\nGina Diaz Photography\n\nDear About Redlands, Referrals are the best compliments I can receive. Thank you so much for the recent referral of Alan C., and others, to me for my photography services. It was a pleasure working with Alan and his fiance in providing a corporate head shot required by his employer with an extremely short deadline. After a 25 day business trip, Alan returned home yesterday to Redlands and we were able to meet in the late afternoon to make this happen for him. Your AboutRedlands page continues to be a fabulous source of information for local happenings and business support. I appreciate receiving new customer referrals. Thank you again for sending new business my way. Best, Gina Diaz\n\nRob Robbins\n\nThanks Martha Green.
