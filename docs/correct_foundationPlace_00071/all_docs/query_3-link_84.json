Registration\n\nThere is tremendous potential for students to use GIS for analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 outbreak. We would like to hear from you. Send us links to your Hub sites, dashboards, or story maps on the topic, or contact us at highered@esri.com for more info or questions.\n\nWith COVID-19 causing colleges and universities to close doors for in-person courses, educators are seeking information on approaches to transition to a fully online classroom.\n\nThere are many challenges – providing access to technology in absence of the trusty physical classroom, providing licensing, adjusting our teaching style for the virtual classroom – all needing to be solved in a short timeframe!\n\nAmidst of all the disruption, there is a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. While intimidating, this gives us an opportunity to re-invigorate our courses and to innovate.\n\nNow is the time to identify and focus on your course's learning objectives and consider how ArcGIS Online (SaaS) instead of ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap (desktop GIS) will help you meet those objectives. ArcGIS Online (and other apps) have minimal hardware requirements and run on Macs, tablets, and phones, making them more accessible than desktop GIS. Web and mobile apps generally have a simpler user interface (fewer buttons and menus) that can be learned more quickly, keeping the focus on concepts and content.\n\nSome more advanced objectives (most likely in advanced GIS course work) may still require desktop GIS; in these cases, consider a blend of SaaS and Desktop GIS. ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro are designed to work together, so moving between the two is easy. Starting with SaaS can buy additional time for you and/or your IT support staff to explore virtualization and remote access solutions for desktop GIS. That said, please consider moving your course activities to SaaS – ArcGIS Online and Apps – for which students only need an internet connection.\n\nA few items to think about:\n\nDesktop-only GIS is a thing of the past - for a while now, we have encouraged the use of SaaS technology such as ArcGIS Online and associated apps. Many educational institutions are highly leveraging apps like Story Maps, Survey123, Collector, among many others. These are now the starting point for geospatial technology in the classroom. And fortunately, there are many online learning resources to get us started quickly.\n\nThe technology has grown immensely over the years - many capabilities are possible with ArcGIS Online and Apps. We can maintain our current learning objectives and map them to some of these newer online learning resources. Some examples:\n\nSymbology and Visualization –plenty of basic concepts can be covered with ArcGIS Online and apps such as Insights for ArcGIS.\n\nSpatial analysis –ArcGIS Online has fundamental capabilities for querying and summarizing data, calculating proximity, and overlaying layers.\n\nField data collection workflows – there are many apps available to collect locations and attributes, such as Collector and Survey123.\n\nBottom line: Use some of these lessons and e-learning/web courses as a base, as opposed to re-writing your existing materials, then pose additional challenges for your students.\n\nToday’s students are fast learners - they have no problem with new technology and will welcome the opportunity to experiment. In addition, the SaaS technology and apps are easier to work with than desktop applications.\n\nThis is a forgiving time – if something doesn’t work, that is OK. Students will be open/receptive in this time of disruptive change. We are not going to design a perfect online course in such a short timeframe, it is not realistic. We need to do what is practical and feasible.\n\nHere are a few quotes from Higher Education colleagues that support the above.\n\nClemson University: In our pilot to test moving a course to fully online, we limited instruction to ArcGIS Online. This is my advice if institutions haven’t virtualized yet, have little experience with it, and had to rush to move online, as students might not have the right computer/access/space) etc.\n\nNC State University: If our in-house virtual environment were to become overloaded for some reason and all else fails, we would look for ways to supplement our instruction with more ArcGIS Online examples where we can, particularly at the undergraduate level.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota:ArcGIS Online removes much of the stress associated with quickly moving my in-person courses to all online.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing many universities and colleges to virtualize their classes. Recently we have fielded many questions on how to virtualize ArcGIS, to support the moving of labs, assignments and activities to a complete online setting. Fortunately, the virtualization of Esri technology, especially ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap, is well tested across many platforms; on-premise and in the cloud.\n\nEsri Virtualization Team has provided information on various virtualization options for ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap in their newly published blog titled Virtualization of ArcGIS from the Cloud and On-Premise platforms to support Higher Education.\n\nThe blog includes information on:\n\nSpecial considerations to virtualize ArcGIS Pro\n\nUsing ArcGIS Pro on Mac\n\nVirtualization On-Premise (technology and hardware options)\n\nVirtualization in Cloud (options and providers)\n\nConnecting the Virtual Machine (VM) to the client\n\nMuch of this information is also available in the newly published Esri ArcGIS Pro Virtualization White Paper.\n\nIn addition, hear from the experts in this \"Enabling Remote Access to ArcGIS in Higher Education\" webinar. View webinar recording.\n\nPresenters include:\n\nPeter Knoop, University of Michigan\n\nPeter Wiringa, University of Minnesota\n\nSeth Peery, Virginia Tech\n\nJim Detwiler, Pennsylvania State University\n\nWendy Guan, Harvard University\n\nIf you have additional questions on virtualizing ArcGIS Pro, please emailArcGISProVirtualization@esri.com.\n\nTeaching online entails more than recording face-to-face content and placing it in an online environment. Pedagogical shifts need to take place while keeping student learning, course goals, and program objectives at the forefront. Fortunately, GIS has a 20-year history of online education, so there are successful models to follow. Advice for teaching online is widely available, and selected resources are below. And although designing a online course takes time and planning, don’t try to design a perfect online course right now. Focus on what is essential. Realize that many students will access materials on their phones and with limited internet, so videos may not be practical. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nSelected guidelines about teaching online:\n\nRecent advice about placing your courses online in light of the health emergency:\n\nhttps://anygoodthing.com/2020/03/12/please-do-a-bad-job-of-putting-your-courses-online/\n\nResources for converting to online courses from several universities:\n\nhttps://www.smu.edu/Provost/CTE/Resources/Technology/HybridOnline\n\nLessons learned from years of online teaching, from Muki Haklay, University College London:\n\nhttps://povesham.wordpress.com/2020/03/14/what-i-learned-about-online-teaching-and-research-manageme...\n\nBrief guidance from Inside Higher Ed:\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/07/12/7-guidelines-effective-teaching-o...\n\nFor more tools, books, data, and other instructional resources, see attached.
