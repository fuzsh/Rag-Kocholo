Modernize the Management of Your Buildings The spatial analysis capabilities of a GIS make it a technology uniquely qualified to help you better design and operate your facilities from a single authoritative database. And with basic templates and applications freely available, you can get started quickly. Why ArcGIS for Facilities The ArcGIS ® platform can be used to build or enhance your facilities technology systems. The ability of GIS to do analysis and apply models based on different scenarios allows facility managers to create an efficient building from the start that provides the best space usage and energy efficiency possible. As the building matures, staff can model asset usage and depreciation over time and manage security and environmental costs. Most importantly, GIS opens up facilities-specific software and data for use across the enterprise. ArcGIS improves all areas of facilities-focused business functions including: Planning Move management Real estate/Portfolio management Asset management Safety and security Environmental health Work order management Transportation planning Emergency planning and response Wayfinding (routing across campus and through buildings) IT infrastructure management Energy management Pomona College and Esri partner Critigen used ArcGIS as a central data repository and analysis platform for auditing on-site renewable energy potential via landscape water usage.\n\n3. Esri ArcGIS for Facilities ® Esri makes designing and managing facilities fast and easy. Esri partner R&K helps clients assess building conditions and understand maintenance costs easily through a dashboard app. Manage Data Better Create Healthier Facilities Easily Exchange Data with CAD Visualize Anywhere The ArcGIS platform supports data exchange between CAD technology with interoperability tools that allow the interchange of most CAD data, as well as BIM formats. ArcGIS also supports Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC), web services, including WFS, WMS, and WCS, for sharing data. Expanding support for GML and CAD applications, including the ability to consume GIS web services inside CAD, means it is easier than ever to use facilities data in ArcGIS. ArcGIS platform-based templates, downloadable for free, can be used to create, view, and use intelligent campus and room-level maps. These maps and analyses can be shared on the Internet and via any mobile device, including smartphones, and embedded into web-based applications. Create Consistent, Standard Models Esri has created data models and standardized templates to help you get started and provide consistent standards to make it easier to share and integrate data. All the features critical to support space, asset, and move management applications are supported. Find Solutions Fast Creating geographically aware facilities means managers are better equipped for everything from maintenance to emergency response. Find locations, route between points, and even ask questions that include information on multiple floors and buildings. Viewing facilities in 2D, 3D, and even 4D means facilities are more functional, and so are you. Continue to Leverage Your IT Investments Esri supports a complete GIS facilities IT solution by using open, flexible, standards-based technology for integrated query, analysis, and reporting capabilities. This ensures that GIS applications work with your standard facilities technology. Geospatial data investments can be leveraged, and you can provide a platform for geospatial integration. Find out more at esri.com/fm. Esri partner Manhattan provides the ability to view facilities usage across campus and discover vacant or underutilized space."
