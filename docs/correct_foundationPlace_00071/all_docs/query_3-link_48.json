        "text": "An outbreak investigation and response has defined steps and phases (see Chapter 3), and each has specific technology and information needs. In recent years, public health agencies have benefitted from technologic advances that support outbreak detection—whether the outbreak is caused by a known or unknown agent. For example, to detect reportable disease clusters effectively, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene each day prospectively applies automated spatiotemporal algorithms to reportable disease data by using SaTScan (Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA). This system enabled detection of the second largest US outbreak of community-acquired legionellosis by identifying a cluster of eight cases centered in the South Bronx days before any human public health monitor noticed it and before healthcare providers recognized the increase in cases (3). The identification led to an extensive epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory investigation to identify the source—a water cooling tower—and then implement measures to remediate it. Although technology is revolutionizing approaches to cluster detection, this chapter assumes the field team will be responding after a known event or outbreak has been detected; thus, the following discussion focuses on using technologies for conducting initial characterization, active case finding, enhanced surveillance, supporting and evaluating control measures, and situational awareness, and for monitoring the response and its effectiveness.\n\nConducting Initial Characterization, Active Case Finding, and Monitoring\n\nIn an outbreak setting, routine data management often changes because of new stressors or novel circumstances, particularly the need to almost immediately gather data, produce reports, and inform decision makers and the public (see also Chapters 2 and 3). To assess population groups at highest risk, geographic extent, and upward or downward trends of disease incidence throughout a confirmed outbreak, investigators can use existing surveillance mechanisms. However, such mechanisms might need to be enhanced; for example, investigators might need to\n\nCreate a new syndrome or add new queries to an existing syndromic surveillance system;\n\nAsk physicians and laboratorians to report suspected and probable, as well as confirmed, cases;\n\nConduct active case finding; and\n\nProvide laboratories with diagnostic direction or reagents or ask them to send specimens meeting certain criteria to the state public health laboratory.\n\nRegardless of whether case detection is enhanced, the technology used should support production of a line-listing for tracking cases that are part of the investigation. The system should also document what changes are made to individual cases and when those changes are made, including changes that result from new information gathered or learned or from epidemiologic findings. The system should ensure that laboratory data are easily made relational (Box 5.1). Even if investigation data are collected entirely or partially on paper, those data usually are keypunched into electronic data systems for further analysis, and the paper forms are scanned and stored electronically. As stated in a review of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto, an important step in achieving seamless outbreak management is “uniform adoption of highly flexible and interoperable data platforms that enable sharing of public health information, capture of clinical information from hospitals, and integration into an outbreak management database platform” (5).\n\nITs can be used to improve the quality, completeness, and speed of information obtained in a field investigation and the speed and sophistication of reports that can be generated from that information at the individual or aggregate level. To ensure that the full benefits of these technologies are realized, investigators need to perform the following actions:\n\nBegin with the type of output desired, create mock reports, and work backward to define the necessary input elements, ideally at the outset before any data collection begins; however, in reality this process often is iterative.\n\nTest the data export features and ensure the analytic software can easily access the necessary data.\n\nCarefully consider the questions leadership will need to have answered and ensure that the collected data elements answer the overarching questions. Completing this step may directly affect the underlying table structure of the database.\n\nDevelop a flowchart detailing the steps associated with data gathering, information sharing, data management, and data technology. This flow chart will also help to identify processes that must be or should be manual and to identify and remove duplications of data transfer and entry (Figure 5.1).\n\nRecognize that field setups typically need rapid creation and modification of the database and to allow for creation of case records from laboratory results and for addition of multiple laboratory results to case records.\n\nEnsure the database can track both cumulative data (total cases) and temporal data changes (what occurred during the previous 24 hours or previous week). Collect status changes (i.e., change-history status and date-time stamps when the data changed) for priority data elements to ensure accurate reporting of information that changed and when (e.g., the number of new cases, the number of cases that changed from probable to confirmed, or the number of suspected cases that have been ruled out).\n\nEnsure the database supports user-defined data extraction and query capabilities. Do not underestimate the need for easy access to the data by the field investigators for data entry and rapid data summary and for planning the next day’s field operations (e.g., completed interviews, number of houses to revisit, number of non-English interviewers, number of persons with specimens collected, and number of specimen collection containers or other laboratory supplies on hand and needed). Field investigators should not have to be experts in formulating relational database queries.\n\nPlan to test field data collection equipment and applications (see also Chapter 2). For example, if interviews and data collection are to be performed in a door-to-door sampling effort, are the laptop computers too heavy to hold while completing an interview? Can the screens be viewed in direct sunlight? Does the system screen navigation match the flow of the interview? Will Internet connectivity be available?\n\nUse programmed data quality and validity checks to identify and resolve discrepancies at the time of data collection. For example, date fields should only accept valid dates within a given range, or pregnancy should be available as a valid value for women only.\n\nBe aware that, typically, the more complex the data entry checks or programmed skip patterns in place, the more time that is needed to set up the form itself; during field responses, setup time can be an important tradeoff against other uses of investigators’ time and against data quality concerns.\n\nRecognize that structured data collection techniques and standardization processes can minimize data quality problems, although even highly structured data collection techniques do not eliminate data errors. The standardization process that facilitates computer-readable data forms risks losing the richness of information identified within unstructured documents (i.e., clinicians’ notes or field observations). How data elements are collected (e.g., structured drop-down lists, free text, check boxes when multiple selections are possible, or radio buttons for single-choice selections) dictates data storage format and table structures and can dictate how the data can be analyzed (e.g., symptoms being reported by interviewees can be stored in a comma-delimited string, or each symptom can be stored as yes/no choices in separate columns).\n\nUsing Routine Surveillance Data and Systems\n\nThe value and use of routine surveillance data systems should not be underestimated during outbreak investigations and ideally will be managed within a data preparedness framework. Many state reportable disease surveillance systems (both commercially available or state-or in-house– designed) now have outbreak management components (7). To avoid duplicating efforts or processes, field investigators should understand and assess existing surveillance systems that support outbreak management before determining which technologies to use (Box 5.2).\n\nIn addition to public health electronic disease surveillance systems supporting outbreak management components, reportable disease electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) is now a mainstay of reportable disease surveillance. Every state health department has operational ELR systems (9). Although ELR was designed for supporting individual identification and reporting of disease events, it can also be used to support outbreak response activities. Using existing surveillance systems, including ELR processes, supports outbreak detection, characterization, outbreak identification, and control measure evaluation (Box 5.3).\n\nSyndromic surveillance uses data about symptoms or health behaviors (e.g., substantial increases in over-the-counter medication sales) and statistical tools to detect, monitor, and characterize unusual activity for further public health investigation or response and situational awareness. The most recognized and largest syndromic surveillance data source is patient encounter data from emergency departments and urgent care centers. These data can be monitored in near–real time as potential indicators of an event, a disease, or an outbreak of public health significance or to provide event characterization and monitoring after initial detection. ESSENCE, an established syndromic surveillance system, was used to quickly facilitate active case finding when Zika virus was introduced in the US in 2016 and 2017 (8) (Box 5.4).\n\nBuilding New Surveillance Systems Versus Modifying Existing Systems\n\nThere is a danger that data management in the context of a field investigation can create more, rather than better, data systems. Condition-specific, event-specific, or stand-alone systems that are not integrated or interoperable require burdensome, post hoc coordination that is difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible.\n\nRather than setting up new stand-alone systems,\n\nWork to modify existing systems. Making an urgent system modification is typical, and modifying systems often is more sustainable than designing and developing separate, nonintegrated data management approaches.\n\nConsider stand-alone systems only when no other options are available. If used, immediately implement a plan to retrieve and share the data with other systems.\n\nLook for opportunities in which the event response can help catalyze surveillance system modifications that will strengthen future surveillance activities.\n\nUsing EHRs\n\nWith broad implementation of EHRs, opportunities exist for improving links between healthcare providers and public health departments, making data collection during field investigations more effective and timely (11). Increasingly, public health agencies have been able to establish agreements with healthcare facilities, often at the local level, to support remote access to EHRs for day-to-day surveillance activities. With such access to EHRs, staff can review medical records remotely to gather additional clinical, exposure, or demographic data about a case whose case report has been received through other channels.\n\nRoutine use of such access by local or state health department staff before an event can reduce public health learning curves when EHRs need to be accessed during a response event. Even without routine access, field investigators have been able to get time-limited system-specific EHR access during such response events, as happened during the response to the multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 (Box 5.5). This benefitted the outbreak team as they conducted active case finding, completed case abstraction after case identification, and characterized the cases. Medical records abstraction can be done remotely by technical experts who are not on the deployed field team. Familiarity with EHR systems and direct contact with vendors can be helpful. Healthcare provider office staff might be knowledgeable about conducting record-level retrieval in the EHR product, but they might be less skilled at producing system extracts or querying across records (e.g., all persons receiving a specific procedure during a specific time frame) in ways that clinical users of the EHR have little occasion to do.\n\nWhen data to support an event response might be in an EHR, field teams should\n\nUse on-site time to establish necessary relationships and agreements to support remote or desk EHR access;\n\nHave a low threshold for requesting remote EHR access;\n\nElevate resolution of any barriers to EHR access that are encountered to jurisdictional leadership and request assistance from privacy and legal teams (see also Chapter 13);\n\nExpand the response team to include experts in medical data abstraction who can support the response remotely;\n\nContact EHR vendors or use health department surveillance and informatics staff to facilitate coordination with vendors and to help with gaining remote access or to performing data extractions or queries across records; and\n\nEnsure quality EHR data integration into existing surveillance systems.\n\nUsing EHRs is new to some public health workers and can present challenges. For example, public health users require time to learn how to access, connect, and navigate systems. Where in the EHR the needed data are stored depends in part on how healthcare facilities use their EHRs; for example, data ideally stored as coded elements or in available system-designated fields might instead be located in free-text boxes. The more system users exist, the more likely the same data element is recorded in different ways or in different places. Data important to the response might even be stored on paper outside the EHR system. Ideally, public health personnel have access to an institution’s entire EHR system, but some facilities still require that those personnel request specific records, to whom the facility assigns specific record access; the latter approach slows the process. The benefits of timely data and data access have proved to be worth the effort to overcome these challenges.\n\nImproving Analysis, Visualization, and Reporting\n\nDuring outbreaks and response events in recent years, demand has increased for rapid turnaround of easily consumable information. This demand is in part driven by cultural changes and expectations, where people now have powerful computers in their pockets (smartphones) and easy access to social media, the Internet, and 24- hour news cycles. The field team must meaningfully summarize the data and produce reports rapidly, turning collected data into information useful for driving public health action.\n\nRegardless of collection method, after data are digitized, analytic and statistical software can be used to manipulate the data set in multiple ways to answer diverse questions. Additionally, advanced analytic software enables use of other types of data (e.g., electronic real-time data about air or water quality or data acquisition or remote sensing systems, such as continual or automated collection and transmission). Combining these data with geographic information system data can facilitate overlay of environmental and person-centric information by time and place (11).\n\nThe following principles apply to facilitating effective analysis and visualization:\n\nData must be easily exportable to other systems for analysis; often this process can be automated. Even when data collection occurs in one primary database, completing data analyses may require use of other, more sophisticated tools or merger of outbreak data with data from other sources.\n\nEstablish a report schedule (e.g., every day at 9 am) early during the investigation. In larger outbreaks for which data input is managed in multiple or disparate locations, communicating explicitly when data should be entered or updated in the system and what time the daily report will be run is imperative for ensuring that the most up-to-date information is available for analysis. Reports summarizing the cumulative information known, as well as daily or even twice-daily data summaries (i.e., situation reports) (Handout 5.1), might be necessary.\n\nUse software to automate report production to run at specific times. This function is useful during larger events where situation reports might be needed multiple times each day.\n\nTransitioning from Field Investigations to Ongoing Surveillance\n\nNew systems or processes at the local, state, and federal levels often have been developed for supporting outbreak responses. Because of time and resource constraints in outbreak settings, surveillance systems or processes initiated during outbreaks can partially duplicate other processes. They may be time-consuming or staff-intensive in ways that are acceptable during the response but not as part of a routine system and may present integration problems when the outbreak is over. To minimize this potential, field investigators should ensure that processes for reviewing data collection are strictly followed throughout the outbreak. Field investigators should begin transition planning for sustainability with the goal of transitioning as soon as possible to existing mechanisms, keeping in mind related data collection activities that may be needed in future, long-term records management and storage, and continued analyses.\n\nDetermining Security, Standards, and Database Backups\n\nData security is paramount in any uses of technology in a field response. Computers, tablets, and other mobile devices taken into the field must be protected against data loss and unauthorized access. Determinations must be made regarding what types of equipment can interact with the public health agency’s internal network. Confidential data storage on a local machine should be discouraged, and, if unavoidable, address the need early and through the public health agency’s privacy and security standards (see also Chapter 13).\n\nBefore data collection or device selection,"
