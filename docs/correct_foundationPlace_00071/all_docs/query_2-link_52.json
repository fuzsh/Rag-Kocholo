We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFederal Agencies – partnering with industry to get the job done\n\nFederal agencies are key to maintaining a safe, stable, and thriving nation. From the Department of Defense, that protects Americans at home and abroad, to the Department of Interior that manages America’s vast public lands, to NASA, tasked with exploring the unknown for all the citizens of our planet, federal agencies provide the structure and do the work that makes our country thrive.\n\nOne thing these agencies have in common is that they manage many types of assets across vast spaces. From ensuring that gas pipelines are built and operated safely, to marking out trails in national parks, to building dams, highways and runways, these agencies rely on the private sector for products and technologies that help get more done with fewer resources.\n\nSince the foundation of our country, federal agencies have quietly been getting the job done, ensuring stability and growth. This vital structure didn’t happen overnight, and it’s interesting to see the evolution of how these agencies developed.\n\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\n\nThe DOD is America's largest government agency, with more than 2,870,235 employees and service members. Tracing its roots back to pre-Revolutionary times, the department has evolved with our nation.\n\nThe Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were established in 1775, to support the American Revolution. In 1789, Congress created the War Department, responsible for both the Army and Navy until the founding of a separate Department of the Navy in 1798. After World War II, the War Department was reorganized and by 1949, the command structure was unified, and the Department of Defense was created.\n\nToday, the DOD has four branches (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard) with the Marines organized under the Navy, and the new Space Force organized under the Air Force. The branches are made up of 34 agencies, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and divisions including the US Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, two organizations are staffed with uniformed service members but don’t report to the Secretary of Defense. These include the Public Health Service Corps (reporting to the Surgeon General who reports to the Assistant Secretary of Health in the Health and Human Services Department) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA), reporting to the Secretary of Commerce[1]. Interestingly, the NOAA includes the National Geodetic Survey, our oldest scientific agency. In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson founded the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (as the Survey of the Coast) to provide nautical charts to the maritime community for safe passage into American ports and along our extensive coastline[2].\n\nBerntsen has been serving the DOD for decades. In fact, it was a request from the DOD that sparked a new way of creating survey markers.\n\nIn 1848, the Secretary of the Treasury Robert J Walker did a comprehensive review of the duties of the agencies under his control and other agencies throughout the federal government. He determined that the General Land Office, along with the Indian Affairs Office (in the War Department), The Patent Office (in the State Department), and the pension offices (in the War and Navy departments), had little in common with their (respective) departments. He suggested that they be moved into a new department and went about drafting a bill to accomplish his objective. On March 3, 1849, the legislation was approved by the Senate, thus creating a cabinet agency known as the Department of the Interior (DOI). Subsequently, Interior functions expanded to include the census, regulation of territorial governments, exploration of the western wilderness, and management of the D.C. jail and water system.\n\nOver time, additional functions have been added to and removed from the DOI’s management. Those added include: the US Geological Survey, 1879; the Bureau of Reclamation, 1902; the Bureau of Mines, 1910; the National Park Service, 1916; the US Fish and Wildlife Service, 1940; and the Bureau of Land Management, 1946.\n\nResponsibilities have been moved to other departments. In 1925, the Patent Office was transferred to the Department of Commerce. In 1930, the Bureau of Pensions was transferred to the Veterans Administration[3].\n\nNevertheless, the purview of the DOI is massive. For example, one of its entities, the Bureau of Land Management oversees 245 million acres of public lands, manages 30% of the nation’s mineral resources, and contributes $1.2 billion annually in economic contributions, such as solar and wind power and geothermal energy[4].\n\nThe Department of Transportation is a newer executive agency, created during the Johnson administration in 1967, reporting directly to the President. The agency coordinates funding and manages aviation, rail, highway, public transit, hazardous pipelines and other functions involved in the safe transit of people and goods[6].\n\nA request from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WISDOT) triggered the invention that built Berntsen. Back in the early 1970s, Peter Berntsen heard about the need for a lighter, more portable survey monument to be used by WISDOT. As owner of Berntsen Cast products, Peter was in the position to solve the problem. With the help of a metallurgist at the University of Wisconsin, Berntsen developed a corrosion-resistant, aluminum-alloy magnetic monument weighing just 8.5 pounds. This innovative monument (the W-1B) proved to be so durable and popular that it established Berntsen as the leader in marking the infrastructure of the world.\n\nBerntsen – providing the right tools at the right time\n\nOver the years, the DOD, DOI, DOT and their bureaus and services have all relied on Berntsen to fulfill their missions - including the US Forest Service, the US Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Reclamation, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, the National Park Service, NASA, and many more.\n\nBerntsen markers delineate the borders of national parks, and our Carsonite trail markers help citizens safely enjoy scenic trails. Berntsen offers a full toolbox for right-of-way management, from utility posts and decals to metal markers to passive RFID tagging. Our InfraMarker Connected RFID links any type of physical asset to GIS, streamlining the identification, tracking and management of everything from pipelines to dinosaur fossils.\n\nSee us at the FedGIS Conference!\n\nIn partnership with Esri, Berntsen is looking forward to demonstrating how InfraMarker RFID can help federal agencies better manage their diverse assets at the upcoming Esri FedGIS Conference. Stop by booth 830 to see how the InfraMarker RFID App for ArcGIS can help you identify, verify and update data for any type of asset in the field with a simple scan. Anything (even underground) that can be marked with an RFID tag can connect to ArcGIS for accurate identification and management. We look forward to seeing you there.\n\nMADISON, Wisc., July 3, 2023 - Berntsen International, a leading manufacturer of infrastructure marking products, announces that its InfraMarker RFID app is now fully integrated with Esri’s ArcGIS Survey123 and ArcGIS Field Maps mobile applications.\n\nBerntsen’s InfraMarker app connects passive UHF RFID – the fastest growing asset identification technology in the world, with Esri’s ArcGIS, the global market leader in geographic information system (GIS) software.

This vibrant market growth will continue as RFID is integrated into more and more systems, including Geographic Information Systems, robotics and more.\n\nThe lasting impact of one person on the industry\n\nEarly on, in 2002, a reporter for Information Week realized the potential of the fledgling RFID market. About that time, manufacturing companies were trying to get a handle on how to prevent pervasive problems with inventory management and managing shipping information. RFID was one of the many technologies that was being tested to help resolve these problems. The reporter, Mark Roberti, focused his investigative skills on learning all he could about this fledgling technology. Little did he know that the result of his efforts would create a new career and an industry powerhouse.\n\nSoon, Roberti created a website just to post his RFID articles, but it wasn’t until a reader asked about a subscription to the website that he realized he could make money by sharing his fascination with RFID. By 2003, Roberti was organizing annual conferences and online events. In 2007, his efforts received an unexpected boost by a corporate mandate by Walmart – that all suppliers must begin using RFID tags to mark their products. Of course, this mandate resulted in a rush of interest in RFID, as well as a lot of pushback from suppliers. More importantly, a patent holder for RFID technology began to enforce its patents. This stymied the corporate investment in RFID -- until Roberti stepped in and helped the industry manage licensing issues.\n\nBefore the advent of social media and e-commerce, the RFID industry found itself the focus of misinformation. In 2008, some consumer organizations began boycotting clothing with embedded RFID tags, erroneously believing that the tags would enable companies to spy on their customers. These groups got a lot of media attention, but the inherent versatility of RFID enabled manufacturers to resolve the issue (if not the misinformation). The RFID tags were simply placed on removable tags.\n\nGrowing with RFID\n\nIt’s National 811 Day – a very important, but little-known commemoration. Anyone who is planning to disturb the ground should call this number before digging or excavating – or go to call811.com and connect online. Once you provide the area of excavation, locators will come out and mark the location of buried gas pipes, water lines, power cables and other underground utilities.\n\nThis call can save your (or someone else’s) life. According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), ruptured gas distribution systems have killed 12 people already this year. Since 2005, 225 people have died due to damages to gas distribution systems, with total damages to public and industry property of nearly $8.5 billion*. These are the statistics for the gas distribution industry alone.\n\nFor firms that are excavating every day, the need to “Know what’s below” is essential for safe operations.\n\nThe 2020 DIRT Report (Damage Information Reporting Tool) provides a more comprehensive picture of damages caused by all types of underground utility strikes – though the reporting is voluntary, not mandatory. The Common Ground Alliance (CGA) estimates that utility strikes result in $30 billion of direct and indirect costs every year. The most common root cause listed for these utility strikes was “failure to notify” (they didn’t call 811) before excavation.\n\nThe top five root causes of damage (70% of all reported damages):\n\nFortunately, cost-effective technology is available to help make efficient asset management available to municipalities. Rather than keeping track of stormwater assets on paper and then digitizing the information, many municipalities have gone digital, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to keep track of their catch basins, swales, hydrants and other assets. However, in many cases, even if all the assets are viewable on a GIS system, truly useful data is not.\n\nFor example, a single intersection may have literally dozens of manholes, storm drains, catch basins, hydrants and other assets that require regular inspection and maintenance. GIS systems don’t have a way to identify discrete assets in close proximity. That’s where the InfraMarker system comes in. It offers a way to link verified physical location with the digital world using simple, proven technology.\n\nAny asset that is marked with a RFID tag can be linked to unlimited asset information in a GIS using a simple mobile app. Field technicians can verify with certainty where they’re at and then link their maintenance activity with that specific asset – no guesswork or wasted time involved.\n\nAsset managers benefit because they can view all assets online and delve into each specific record to view videos, photos and any other documentation the field tech has attached to the specific tag. An audit trail has been created so asset managers can schedule inspections and maintenance knowing that there will be no confusion or wasted time in the field dealing.\n\n*Estimated Annual Ecomonic Impacts from Harmful Algal Booms (HABs) in the United States, WHOI-2000-11.\n\nMost people don’t really think about how geographic information provides the framework for our entire existence. We exist as living organisms in time and space. Our minds may be occupied with far-way thoughts, but our memories are inextricably tied to the place where they were created. As long as we live and breathe, we always have a location. Shakespeare’s Hamlet said “To be or not to be, that is the question.” Surveyors say, “To be is to occupy a position relative to two axes.”\n\nSurveyors are trained to understand the implications of geography and location differently than most people. Precision is applied to location and this information has been the basis for civilizations for thousands of years. I’ve written about ancient surveying instruments in previous blogs: Ancient Egyptian Surveying and Ancient Roman Surveying.\n\nToday, geographic information is more important than ever and is being used in ways that were previously unimaginable. As a surveyor, I had the opportunity to work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) early on, mainly by being the boots on the ground that provided accurate geographic data that was subsequently used in GIS. We provided accurate survey-grade locations on US Public Land Survey corners (section and quarter-section corners) to be utilized into a county tax parcel database. This not only helped improve how the county taxed its citizens, it also helped citizens with land development, taking into account appropriate building sites, flood zones, wetland preservation, general zoning requirements, just to name a few. Beyond that, the GIS also is used for school and voting districts, changes in municipal boundaries and incorporations, addressing, and emergency response management.\n\nNothing stays the dame\n\nChange has accelerated quickly in the years since I started working with GIS, as evidenced by a 2009 article entitled the “Top Five Benefits of GIS”, with number one benefit being cost savings from greater efficiency using location-based data.\n\nThe example cited was Sears, which was able to use GIS to reduce the time it took for dispatchers to create routes for their home delivery trucks by 75%. I’m sure that was a huge savings, but unfortunately for Sears, Amazon was already taking over on every front. By 2021, the Sears footprint had shrunk from 3,862 stores in 2009 to just 19 stores and a website.\n\nRoute optimization is only one of the thousands of applications of GIS technology. From precision farming to spatial econometrics (the intersection of spatial analysis with economics) to creating ultra-precise road maps to facilitate autonomous vehicles. Check out the 1,000 Uses of GIS for a glimpse into the future.\n\nWhen researching this blog, I learned about a project where Toyota is using a platform that gathers crowd-sourced data from vehicle cameras and combines it with high-precision GPS and GIS to create precise and up-to-date road information. This information will be used for autonomous driving in the future, or probably already is!\n\nWhat?!\n\nInterestingly, a whole new industry is being created around monetizing the vast amount of data that is generated from vehicles. McKinsey estimates the market for this information might add up to $450-650 billion by 2030. I wish there was some way I could get a cut of these billions!\n\nYou may not even realize that the navigation systems in your vehicles are GIS. I’m partial to the Waze app. I love how they incorporate real-time data on reported crashes, speed traps and even roadkill, (important to know, because we have lots of moose and deer up here)! All this can be narrated by people from Dexter on Showtime to PAW Patrol on Nickelodeon.\n\nOther GIS uses\n\nPretty much everyone knows about the Johns-Hopkins COVID map but did you know that there’s a HealthMap that maps reports the location of all kinds of diseases? For example, in the past month, Legionnaires’ Disease was found in three locations in the U.S. Definitely worth looking at before traveling. NASA is also providing satellite data to cancer researchers to help pinpoint the types of human activity that lead to cancer in geographic areas. The Landsat Program is the longest continuous space-based record of Earth’s land in existence.\n\nAs you know, I’m a history buff, and I really like the ArcGIS Online Historical Maps. It makes all the USGS topographical maps accessible. All you need to do is find a place, and any maps that USGS has on it over time will be available. I just downloaded this map form 1890 of New Orleans.\n\nI could go on and on, but I invite you to check out the many ways GIS is being used today.\n\nI know in the past, many surveyors thought that GIS was going to obsolete the profession, but that is definitely not the case. We still need boots in the field tying the data in digital maps to real places in the real world. I’m personally involved in introducing a product that does just that, using RFID to literally tie the physical to the digital. Check it out at inframarker.com. It’s a great product with as many applications as GIS itself."
