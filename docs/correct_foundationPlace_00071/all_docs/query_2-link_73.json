The health of our community is, in large part, reliant on the health of our business community. For this reason the City offers a number of programs and services in partnership with the business community designed to assist existing businesses, encourage entrepreneurs and attract new businesses.\n\nBelow is a summary of the many ways the City works with our business partners to create and sustain a vibrant business environment.\n\nLoan Programs\n\nMicroenterprise Assistance Grant Program\n\nThe MAP Grant provides grants in amounts ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 to eligible businesses that want to establish a business or expand an existing business located within the City of Redlands. This is a grant, and does not have to be repaid as long as all program terms are met. The objective of the Microenterprise Assistance Program (MAP) Grant is to fulfill a need in the community; create opportunity for the establishment and expansion of microenterprise businesses within the City of Redlands; to create quality jobs, principally benefitting employees in the low-to-moderate income levels; and to preserve and expand the City’s tax base.\n\nEconomic Development Loan Program\n\nThe EDLP provides loans in amounts ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 to eligible businesses that want to establish a business or expand an existing business located within the City of Redlands. The loan must be 100% collateralized and be personally guaranteed by the borrower. The objective of the Economic Development Loan Program (EDLP) is to fulfill a need in the community; create opportunity for the establishment and expansion of businesses within the City of Redlands; to create quality jobs, principally benefitting employees in the low-to-moderate income levels; and to preserve and expand the City’s tax base.\n\nProperty Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing Program\n\nThe PACE Program is an energy efficiency, property-assessed, financing program designed to help commercial property owners improve their properties and realize the money-saving benefits of energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation upgrades with $0 down. The program provides property owners financing for energy projects that may not be suited for traditional funding vehicles. PACE financing also helps cities and counties create jobs, spur economic development and meet their AB 32 goals utilizing no public monies.\n\nBusiness Programs & Services\n\nOne-Stop Permit Center\n\nThe City of Redlands One Stop Permit Center offers a single place for businesses and developers to submit and coordinate projects and plan checks to ensure efficient and effective service and support from Building and Safety, Planning and Engineering personnel. The One-StopPermitCenter allows for added convenience and the streamlining of activities related to plan submittals/checks, permit applications and providing information for businesses, developers and residents.\n\nBusiness Consulting and Workshops\n\nThrough a partnership with SCORE (Service Corp of Retired Executives), the City provides free one-on-one business counseling and monthly business workshops (free and fee-based) to existing and prospective business owners. Business workshops include information on Starting a Business, Financing, Marketing and other specialized topics.\n\nSite Selection Assistance\n\nThe Economic Development Division can assist potential business investors, site selectors and real estate professionals with identifying potential business sites within the City of Redlands including providing information such as site-specific demographics, traffic counts, etc.\n\nCalifornia Manufacturing Technology Consulting (CMTC) Services\n\nThrough a partnership with CMTC, manufacturers can receive free assistance and assessments for creating solutions for the improvement of business performance by fostering innovation and sharing knowledge. Manufacturing assessment services provided by CMTC are free to applicants; fees are charged to implement specific improvements.\n\nBusiness Visitation Program\n\nAs part of the City’s business retention/economic gardening efforts, the Economic Development Division will be implementing a new Business Visitation Program in 2013. This effort is designed to 1.) Introduce City staff to existing business owners; 2.) Identify and assist business owners with potential business-related issues; 3.) Provide information/tools to assist business owners in growing and expanding their businesses.\n\nBusiness Communications\n\nThe Economic Development Division will be implementing a new business tool designed to keep the business community, potential business investors, media and other interested individuals informed about business-related news, activities and opportunities in the City of Redlands. The monthly business brief will highlight new projects, business news and real estate opportunities, and will be free to recipients.\n\nOnline Market Analysis Tool\n\nA collaborative effort between the City, Chamber of Commerce and Esri, this web-based tool allows both existing businesses and businesses considering locating to the City an online tool for analyzing the market area of a selected site. The tool is free to all users, and ensures that potential business investors can identify and analyze the best locations and opportunities available in Redlands for their business.\n\nMills Act\n\nThe Mills Act is an economic incentive program in California for the restoration and preservation of qualified historic buildings by private property owners. Enacted in 1972, the Mills Act legislation grants participating cities and counties the authority to enter into contracts with owners of qualified historic properties who actively participate in the rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, and maintenance of their historic properties. Property taxes are recalculated using a formula in the Mills Act and State Revenue and Taxation Code. The average savings for individual properties under the Mills Act contract is between 20 and 60 percent. The full amount of the tax savings received by the property owners must be used to finance the preservation, maintenance and improvements to the property.\n\nCity of Redlands Market Night\n\nThe weekly market night (farmer’s market and vendor market) allows local businesses/vendors an opportunity to participate and promote their businesses to community residents and visitors from other communities. In addition to business activities, the event typically features entertainment and a festive atmosphere that not only promotes local businesses but local tourism, as well, through the introduction of a unique downtown experience and the many restaurants and boutique businesses that comprise the downtown district.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about any of these available programs or have suggestions for other ways the City can promote a vibrant business community, please contact the Economic Development office at (909) 335-4755 or by email at redteam@cityofredlands.org\n\nStarting in 2014, almost everyone will be required to be insured or pay a fine. There are subsidies to help people who can’t afford coverage. Most employers will face fines if they don’t offer coverage for their workers. Newly created insurance markets will make insurance accessible for individuals and small businesses. And Medicaid will be expanded to cover more low-income people.\n\nInsurers will be prohibited from denying coverage to people with medical problems or charging those people more. An assortment of tax increases health industry fees and Medicare cuts will help pay for the changes.\n\nThe following may help you answer questions that you might have and help you better understand your role as an employer as the 2014 Federal ACA mandate approaches.\n\nDoes the employer have at least 50 full time equivalent employees?\n\nIf NO Penalties do not apply to small employers\n\n{If the employer has 25 or fewer employees and average wages up to $50,000.00 it may be eligible for a Health insurance tax credit.}\n\nIf YES Does the employer offer coverage to its workers?\n\nIf NO Did at least 1 employee receive a premium tax credit or cost sharing subsidy in an exchange?\n\nIf YES The employer must pay a penalty for not offering coverage.\n\n{The penalty is $2000 annually times this number of full-time employees minus 30. The penalty\n\nis increased each year by the growth in insurance premiums.}\n\nDoes the insurance pay for at least 60% of covered health care expenses for a typical population?\n\nIf NO Employees can choose to buy coverage in an Exchange and receive a premium tax credit.\n\nThe employer must pay a penalty for not offering affordable coverage.\n\n{The penalty is $3000 annually for each full time employee receiving a tax credit up to a maximum of$2000 times the number of full time employees minus 30. The penalty is increased each year by the growth in insurance premiums.}\n\nIf YES Do any employees have to pay more than 9.5% of family income for employer coverage?\n\nIf YES Those employees can choose to buy coverage in an Exchange and receive a premium tax credit. The employer must pay a penalty for not offering affordable coverage.\n\n{The penalty is $3000 annually for each full time employee receiving a tax credit up to a maximum of $2000 times the number of full time employees minus 30. The penalty is increased each year by the growth in insurance premiums.}\n\nIf NO There is no penalty payment required of employer since it offers affordable coverage.\n\nThere is no need to track down a food truck or scroll up and down you smart phone app to find a fun filled and tasty way to treat yourself and your friends to the savory delights of Redlands. For the third year, the Redlands Chamber will present Cruisin’ Cuisine on Saturday, June 22, when 10 restaurants will offer gastronomic experiences to guests as they stroll from one establishment to another in downtown Redlands sampling specialties, delighting in sophisticated tastes and nibbling signature dishes from our finest eateries.\n\nGuests will purchase a ticket that will include a map and passport to each participating restaurant. Then off they go to taste and test to theirs heart’s delight. At each restaurant guests will have hosts sign their passport that will then make them eligible for a drawing at the end of the evening. For restaurants not located in downtown Redlands host businesses will partner with them allowing use of facility providing both with great exposure.\n\n“This is an excellent opportunity to showcase our restaurants and caterers, get people out of their cars, on their feet and downtown and enjoy an evening in Redlands.” said Daney Bachiu, Chamber President. “We have some fabulous restaurants in Redlands and Cruisin’ Cuisine is an excellent way for us to highlight them.”\n\nTickets for the event are $35 per person and are limited. To purchase your tickets or for more information about Redlands Chamber Cruisin’ Cuisine call 793-2546.\n\nMarch, in like a lion, out like a lamb. You probably won’t get this unless you come from the cold North or East, in Redlands it is more like, in like a navel, out like an avocado March. This is my third message, the time certainly is going quickly. Just about the time I get comfortable in my roll as “Queen”, it will be time to abdicate.\n\nI attended the Feb. 20th City Council meeting to voice Chamber support of the underpass improvement program. The areas targeted for improvements are the underpasses at Eureka St, along Pearl Ave to the Orange and 6th Street underpasses. The improvements include upgraded lighting, landscaping, and murals painted on the underpasses. The results of these improvements will enhance the downtown shopping areas and welcome visitors and businesses looking to locate in Redlands. This project will also connect North and South Redlands serving as a conduit to what has long been perceived as a physical division through the center of town. Council directed staff to begin the development process to begin the enhancements.\n\nAt the last chamber of commerce board meeting, we set the wheels in motion for our Fantastically Fun Fundraisers. The first on the calendar is our third annual and very popular Cruisin’ Cuisine. If you are not familiar with this event, it showcases ten local restaurants with samplings from their menus. Ticket holders are given a wrist band and walk to each restaurant in no particular order. The event is limited to 200 and I have already sold 4 tickets even though they are not yet printed. It’s a fun way to discover new eateries in and fabulous menus in Redlands. So, if you want to eat your way through downtown Redlands, buy your tickets or reserve your tickets now before they are sold out! This event will be held Saturday, June 8.\n\nOur second next fabulous event brand new and promises to be all kinds of fun…it’s a “Black Tie” evening at the Bowl. What is so different about that you may ask? Well, it is not the Redlands Bowl, but the Empire Bowl! Yes, that’s right, you will get all glammed up to go bowling…for BLACK TIE BOWLING!!!.\n\nStep out on the red carpet in your gorgeous gown and your dashing tux…. Dine on delectable hors d’oeuvres then slip into your bobby socks and bowling shoes and toss your ball down the alley hoping for a strike!!!! With limited space get your team of 5 together and don’t delay. The Chamber’s Black Tie Bowling will be scheduled in October so start warming up now and call Jan at the chamber to reserve your alley. We have been unsuccessful in procuring land to wallow in the mud, so we decided to take it to the streets in electrical splendor! Kathie Thurston and I went to Irvine in December 2012 to watch their Electric run and it was phenomenal…they had 9000 runners! We don’t have the details hammered out on this one yet, but it will be in December. We will keep all you runners that want to get lit at the Redlands 5K, posted watch for details.\n\nThis is all the Queen has to report until April.\n\nThe Queen\n\nPath Forward for the Redlands Mall\n\nWithout a doubt, the most common question the City Council receives from residents and the business community is about the Redlands Mall. While the Mall isn’t the only underutilized piece of land in the City, at 12 acres of downtown real estate it’s one of the largest and most visible.\n\nThe Redlands Mall is privately owned and the current Mall owners have demonstrated for several years now that they are unwilling to develop or significantly invest in the property. It makes sense for the Mall owners to sell to a new team that will partner with the City to make downtown a destination that complements our existing shopping district. But the Mall owners have shown no interest in offers to buy the property and it has even been a struggle to get them to adequately maintain their property. The economic crisis certainly played a small role as well.\n\nDespite all this, the City is not just a bystander in the conversation; we have some leverage – most significantly, parking. The Redlands Mall has never owned dedicated parking for its patrons. The parking spaces surrounding the mall and those in the underground garage are primarily owned and controlled by the City.\n\nThis is a considerable bargaining chip for the City as we work to persuade the Mall owners to develop their property or sell it to someone who will. The agreement with the Mall states that tenants are entitled to a very limited number of parking spaces within the City parking lot surrounding the Mall. The City could also consider development uses and alternatives for the balance of the parking property but that presents problems that could impede future development.\n\nIn the meantime, the City has explored ways to use the City-owned Mall parking to support downtown, such as the highly successful Food Truck event last summer.\n\nSome members of the public and business communities have also suggested Eminent Domain. The problem with Eminent Domain, or unfriendly condemnation, is that we could not control the total price of the property. Eminent Domain would start us down a path where the City could incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in consultant, legal and court expenses to acquire the Mall.\n\nEach party would spend money challenging the other’s perceived valuation of the Mall, and then the City would pay the sum determined by the court in addition to legal expenses.\n\nThis isn’t about a lack of political will. This is about the lack of assurances that the City won’t be left with the entire cost of the Mall in addition to ongoing obligations.\n\nI am also uncertain where these funds would come from at the City. I doubt there would be any real support from my Council colleagues to jeopardize our financial footing to buy the Mall.\n\nI have yet to meet a developer or private partner who is willing to give the City a blank check to undertake these efforts. Neither does the city’s track record of buying property give me confidence that Eminent Domain is in the best interest for our community.\n\nThe City recently released a Request for Qualifications/Proposals (RFQ/P) from members of the development community to bring us proposals and formal ideas to revitalize the Mall at its highest and best use for the community.\n\nWe have three objectives in moving forward:\n\nAvoid continued neglect of the Mall;\n\nReuse and monetize the Mall site and the City‐owned property surrounding the site to generate liquidity, tax revenues, and job creation; and\n\nEnsure acquisition of the Mall property by a qualified development team who will partner with the city, bring experience of developing commercial/residential property, and has the financial resources to develop the property;\n\nIf we are successful in signing an agreement with someone who will help us meet these goals the City’s control over much of the parking associated with the development site will ensure us an active role in the discussions between the interested parties since the City has control of much of the parking associated with the development site.\n\nIt is our hope that within this calendar year we will see some movement that points to a change in ownership and a comprehensive vision for the Mall site.\n\nOur path forward on the Mall is simple – we need to partner with a new development team who can share in our vision to develop a mixed-use project that revitalizes downtown, complements the core, and generates economic activity."
