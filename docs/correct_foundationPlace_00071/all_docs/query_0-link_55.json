        "text": "As explained in comments and pointed out in the other answer, data is usually independent of software or can at least be exported in a format that can be read by many different kinds of software. There are exceptions to this.\n\nYou've mentioned a specific tutorial. I did a search on it and came up with a youtube video which seems to match your description: Importing Terrain and Imagery CityEngine Essential Skills #5. While this video does source data from the USGS, it only uses regular raster data - aerial imagery and DEM. It does not use any LIDAR data and I didn't see any mention of CLICK, at least in that one. The basic gist of the tutorial is combining several adjacent rasters into a single image, and then clipping that and the DEM to a specific area of interest. It uses the jp2 (JPEG 2000) and img formats.\n\nAll of that is quite doable in QGIS, but a full explanation of everything would well exceed what a GIS.SE question and answer should cover (there are some other questions here on the individual pieces and parts). There are numerous tutorials and documentation for QGIS out there that may assist you in trying to use QGIS to do things the tutorials might use ArcGIS for. For this one, I would suggest:\n\nRaster Mosaicing and Clipping\n\nWorking with Terrain Data\n\nNote that ArcGIS may write some helper files along with the actual images (pyramids, world files, statistics) that QGIS may not. I am not sure if CityEngine would require those helper files to work (seems kind of silly), might be able to generate them on its own, or not need them at all."
