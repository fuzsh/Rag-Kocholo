        "text": "CONSERVATION GIS / SCGIS HISTORY PROJECT DOC #A ver2 xHistory xTTT xScholars xConference xScgis xConservation GIS Alliance\n\n(- FIRST PUBLISHED in1997 on the then-new conservationgis.org website www.conservationgis.org/ecphistory/ecphistory.html\n\n-Updated and posted at SCGIS.org in 2008 for 10 year anniversary, arouind 2014 condensed to short summary.\n\n-significant updates in 2015 and addition of a summary timeline at conservationgis.org www.conservationgis.org/scgis/SCGISHistorySummary.html\n\n-project moved to GEONET in 2018 and expanded significantly)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis is the first draft document in a project to try to build a more organized & readable history of Conservation GIS. It’s scope will go back to some of the first computerized resources mapping efforts on personal computers in the 1980’s and include the origins in Esri software and it’s Conservation GIS program in 1989. Much of its content, including this first document, will focus on the Society for Conservation GIS, founded in 1997, but as this and many documents will show, had extensive antecedents in projects, programs and individuals through the preceding decade.\n\nThe style of this history will be focused on the individuals who contributed and their own stories about how they first found out about Conservation, about GIS and later about the Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS). The origins of this approach can be found in the detailed SCGIS Scholar Profiles and speaker proceedings that were begun in 2015 and can be retrieved at the following links:\n\nhttp://www.conservationgis.org/scgis/2015/SCGIS2015.html\n\nhttp://www.conservationgis.org/scgis/2016/SCGIS2016.html\n\nhttp://www.conservationgis.org/scgis/2017/SCGIS2017.html (Beginning of SCGIS members-only restricted access to proceedings, Scholar profiles open access)\n\nhttp://www.conservationgis.org/scgis/2018/SCGIS2018.html\n\nThis individual-focused approach is intended to include narrative and personal histories as much as presentations, work or publications. This community in general, and SCGIS in particular, is a different kind of social organism, heavily dependent upon the passion and dedication of it’s all-volunteer staff and board. What was lacking was a more formal, permanent way to honor and recognize the contributions and importance of those volunteers, along the lines of the scholar profiles. More importantly, unlike traditional academic profiles of the sort found on Linkedin or Researchgate, it seemed appropriate that profiles about Conservation GIS volunteers in any endeavor include equal attention to the personal narratives. The origin of their interests in conservation and GIS and more visual materials showing their work and their map designs would help highlight the conservationists and activist aspects of their interests and work. Traditional academic bios may frown on such material, but this community, and the SCGIS organization, thrives because a small subset of the academic biology community are driven by a deep love of nature and a desire to protect it and care for it in these times of unprecedented danger and threat. It is to these incredible individuals and all of the different ways they have contributed to and helped to create the field of Conservation GIS and the SCGIS organization that this project is dedicated.\n\nInformation and images used are drawn from many different sources, ranging from formal published SCGIS programs to draft materials and community email discussions where no formal materials existed. The majority of the photographs are mine with some embarrassing gaps where I just missed out or cameras were lost. For other photos original credit is given where known. Edits were made to correct mistakes in emails or reports such as misspelled names.\n\nFUTURE PROJECT TASKS\n\nThe remaining documents planned for this project are as follows:\n\nComplete the rest of the estimated 400 Detailed profiles for every SCGIS International scholar from 2014 back to 1997, following the pattern of 2017. Expand upon and update 2015-2016 profiles where needed with current conservation-GIS publications, work & project chronologies, narrative accounts, articles, SCGIS reports, photos, filmed interviews, example maps, webmaps, storymaps and published databases\n\nBegin creating profiles on the estimated 2000 conservation GIS workers at many hundreds of NGO’s who I worked with or granted to over the years, including the Esri Conservation Program, our initial Tribal, Legal Aid and Land Trust grants programs, the Conservation Technology Support Program and SCGIS volunteers, committees and board members who have served since 1997. The goal will be to create the same level of coverage as with the scholars, but these may begin as much simpler entries whose further expansion will depend upon available time and the availability, interest and permission of the person profiled.\n\nBegin working on a systematic classification of the fundamental nature of conservation GIS work and the underlying conservation goals it serves. This classification, along with some very simple geolocation data, will be applied in an appropriate manner to all project and work descriptions in order to begin to understand the nature and scope of the on-the-ground impact that this community is having. (Projects dealing with sensitive resources including endangered species and Tribal sites & claims will be treated differently, subject to additional guidance and permissions.) Surveys like this covering the SCGIS Scholars effort have been done internally twice before with a degree of success. This will be the first attempt to open up this survey methodology and shared results to the entire Conservation GIS Community. It’s primary goal will be to allow us to use GIS to become more informed and precise about the impact our community is having in the world, so that we might improve our future fundraising strategies and stories.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES:\n\nThe individuals listed below who comprised the first SCGIS leadership in 1997 had already been meeting informally for many years, and their different ongoing threads of discussion set the template for the founding committees of SCGIS. Therefore this document begins in 1994 when the first official call for a meeting of conservation GIS users at the Esri User Conference went out, and the discussions that led to SCGIS began. As an informal gathering, no formal records were taken in 1995. 1996 saw the rise of many others helping to organize this gathering. The push for forming a new nonprofit group was coordinated by Sandra Coveny, who served well as an overall James Reserve meeting organizer in 1996.\n\nThe 1997 founding board was often called an \"interim\" board because 11-15 names were needed on the 501c3 incorporation documents that Tim Bechtold of Montana was preparing for us. Once formed we then worried about the problem of board continuity and turnover, so in that first board a one-time only setup of staggered terms was established, in order to ensure that in any election, no more than 30% of the board would turn over. Of course, as a new organization, many of these staggered terms changed later as people discovered for the first time what it was like serving in this capacity, with some dropping out early and others wishing to serve longer. A point worth noting is that as a newly-created entity, the documentation and records about that chaotic time are similarly chaotic, with conflicting emails and often-varying statements about what was happening. As much as possible their actual service is what is listed here. This document stops at 2015 because that’s when more systematic and curated records of board service appear to have formally begun. If permitted and appropriate they may be added to this document at a later version.\n\nSCGIS Creation & Antecedent working groups (incl “Conservation GIS Alliance” 1994-1996)\n\n1994: Creation of the Conservation GIS Alliance source: 1994 Convis & Thacher emails and announcements\n\nFirst formal conservation GIS conference at James Reserve, organized by Shaw Thacher & Charles Convis. This new group chose the name “Conservation GIS Alliance” to help identify it’s activities over the next few year.\n\n\"The Conservation users are organizing a special user's group meeting on Saturday and Sunday, May 21-22. This meeting will be at the James Nature Reserve near Palm Springs and is free and open to all… The purpose of this meeting is to get a better sense of who we are as a general community of computer users and how we are united by use of common tools like GIS, computers, natural selection and a commitment to conservation ideals. We would like to explore other ways to organize and coordinate our mutual efforts so that we can become more efficient in our work and more effective in obtaining the sorts of support we need such as equipment and training. This will be an informal meeting, with the following loose agenda\n\n1996 Final Meeting of the Conservation GIS Alliance source: 1996 Convis emails\n\nFinal meeting of the “Conservation GIS Alliance” (CGA) as at the 1997 summer meeting attendees unanimously approved becoming a formal nonprofit organization to be called “Society for Conservation GIS” and to elect a new board of directors in the months following.\n\nFormal NGO creation & coordination: Sandra Coveny\n\n-CGA List and survey of conservation GIS people: Pat Kelly\n\n-CGA Conference Papers and Speakers: Sandra Coveny, Charles Convis\n\n-CGA Conference Scholarships & Funding: Bette Loiselle, Sandra Coveny, Charles Convis\n\n-CGA Project Sharing Forum: Peter Morrison\n\n-CGA Conference Organizing: Leads Roberta Pickert, Sandra Coveny, Kai Snyder & Michael Hamilton, with help from Peter Kiriakos, Susan Snetsinger, Bill Bushing and Will Allen.\n\n-CGA Conference logistics & rides: Kai Snyder\n\n-CGA Vendor Committee: Sara Moola, Will Allen\n\n-CGA Conservation Program Users Booth at ESRI Conference: Charles Convis\n\n1997-1998 source: 1997 annual report published in May 1998 and covering the 1997 year activities and first conference. The report was written by Gillian Bowser, Roberta Pickert & Sandra Coveny. A Secondary source was the draft and final Articles of Incorporation that Tim Bechtold oversaw in July 1997. The years listed in parentheses after each name were the agreed term for that person, ranging from 1-3 years. The standard board term was 3 years but we needed to avoid having everyone term out simultaneously 3 years later, so a system of staggered terms at the start was adopted, though not always followed, that’s why you’ll see some terms changing midstream and some names show up for more than 3 years, as the board voted in situations requiring it)\n\nSCGIS FOUNDING BOARD OF DIRECTORS 1997-1998\n\nPresident 1997-1998 Gillian Bowser, MS, National Park Service DC (board term 1997-1999)\n\nVice President 1997-1998 Cheryl Crupi, Conservation Fund VA (board term 1997-1998)\n\nTreasurer 1997-1999 Roberta Pickert, Archbold Biological Station FL (board term 1997-2000)\n\nSecretary 1997-1999 Kai Snyder, Terra Geographics, CA (board term 1997-1999)\n\nCharles Convis, Esri CA (1997-1998)\n\nEasy, Inland Empire Public Lands Council, WA (1997-1999)\n\nLeslie Backus, Archbold Biological Station FL (1997-2000)\n\nMichael Hamilton, UC James Reserve CA (1997-1998)\n\nPeter Morrison, Pacific Biodiversity Inst WA (1997-1998)\n\nSteve Beckwitt, Sierra Biodiversity Inst CA (1997-1998)\n\nSandra Coveny, Oregon Coast Range Association OR (1997-2000)\n\nJohn Mangiameli, The Ecology Center MT (1997-1999)\n\nTim Bechtold, The Ecology Center, MT (1997-1998)\n\nWill Allen, Conservation Fund VA (1997-2000)\n\n1998-1999 source: 1998 Convis emails & documents\n\n1998-1999 Board of Directors\n\nCo-President Sandra Coveny, Oregon Coast Range Association OR (1997-2000)\n\nCo-President Will Allen, Conservation Fund VA (1997-2000)\n\nVice President Cheryl Crupi, Conservation Fund VA (1997-1998)\n\nTreasurer Roberta Pickert, Archbold Biological Station FL (1997-2000)\n\nSecretary Kai Snyder, Terra Geographics, CA (1997-1998)\n\nGillian Bowser, MS, National Park Service DC (1997-1999)\n\nCharles Convis, Esri CA (1997-1998)\n\nEasy, Inland Empire Public Lands Council, WA (1997-1999)\n\nLeslie Backus, Archbold Biological Station FL (1997-2000)\n\nMichael Hamilton, UC James Reserve CA (1997-1998)\n\nPeter Morrison, Pacific Biodiversity Inst WA (1997-1998)\n\nSteve Beckwitt, Sierra Biodiversity Inst CA (1997-1998)\n\nSandra Coveny, Oregon Coast Range Association OR (1997-2000)\n\nJohn Mangiameli, The Ecology Center MT (1997-1999)\n\nTim Bechtold, The Ecology Center, MT (1997-1998)\n\nWill Allen, Conservation Fund VA (1997-1999)\n\n1998-1999 Committees\n\nConference Committee: Michael Hamilton, Peter Kiriakos, Roberta Pickert, Susan Snetsinger, Peter Morrison, Sandra Coveny, Bill Bushing, Will Allen.\n\n1999-2000 source, hardcopy 2000 conf program & strategic plan docs)\n\n1999-2000 Board of Directors\n\nPresident - Michelle Gudorf (1999-2002)\n\nVice President - Gene Martin\n\nTreasurer - Sandra Coveny (1997-2000)\n\nSecretary - Will Allen The Conservation Fund, US (1997-2000)\n\nChristina Casado Missouri Botanical Garden, US\n\nEric Treml TPMC at NOAA Coastal Services Center, US (1999-2002)\n\nEugene Martin CommEn Space, US (1999-2002)\n\nGillian Bowser Joshua Tree National Park, US\n\nHugh Irwin Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition, US (1999-2002)\n\nJoe Breman University of Haifa, Israel (1999-2002)\n\nKaren Willett Wildlife Conservation Society, US (1999-2002)\n\nKent Cassels World Conservation Monitoring Centre, UK\n\nLaurie Williams San Diego State University, US (1999-2002)\n\nLeslie Backus Chambers Group USA\n\nMichelle Gudorf National Park Service, US\n\nNick Rollings University of New England, Australia\n\nPrashant Hedao ESRI, US\n\nPeter Schlesinger Woods Hole Research Center, US (1999-2002)\n\nRoberta L.

First we would like to send special thanks to Pingkham Rattanababpha and her team at ESRI who have provided extensive organization and logistical support for this year’s event. We would like to thank Kay Sadighi who provided extensive support preparing the conference schedule. Huge thanks go to the fabulous folks of the SCGIS Web team—Tom Robinson, Bryan Baker, and Marcelle Caturia. They provided constant and reliable support throughout. They kept the conference Web site up-to-date and all the online registrations working. Finally, we need to thank Lisa Pierce, who went to great personal effort to ensure that we had a venue for this year’s conference.
