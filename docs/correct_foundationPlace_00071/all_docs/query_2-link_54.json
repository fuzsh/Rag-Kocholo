        "text": "Collaboration to Support Communities With Data-Driven Geospatial Solutions for Infrastructure, Buildings, and Development\n\nEsri, the global leader in geographic information systems and location intelligence, today announced that HDR has advanced their partnership to the Platinum program in the Esri Partner Network. HDR is a global consulting firm specializing in engineering, architecture, environmental, and construction services. Its Platinum designation strengthens a long-standing partnership with Esri that spans more than 20 years.\n\nHDR’s more than 125 geospatial and information management professionals leverage Esri’s ArcGIS software in key markets including transportation, power, water, health care, technology, media, telecom, defense, and intelligence. The company’s experts help clients map networks, automate workflows, connect systems, create reports, and improve productivity.\n\n“HDR and Esri’s joint customer focus has evolved in recent years to include deployment and implementation of enterprise-wide geospatial solutions in the markets we serve,” said Pratibha Basrao, HDR’s director of applied technology. “Our decision to establish a cross-company GeoIM program and Esri’s effort to strengthen the partner program helped us elevate our partnership. As a result, we’ve obtained expertise in several industry specialties using ArcGIS technology, and we are bringing new solutions to our clients — helping them with their toughest data challenges and important decisions.”\n\nHDR continually invests in its GeoIM program, and the company is proud to have demonstrated the credentials to earn Esri’s ArcGIS System Ready and Utility Network Management specialty designations.\n\n“Achieving Platinum partnership in the Esri Partner Network is a true honor,” said Bridget Brown, HDR’s GeoIM director. “And it’s a testament to HDR and Esri’s geospatial leadership strengths, technical expertise, focused planning, and diligent follow-through.”\n\n“Esri is inspired by HDR’s investment in ArcGIS technology and geographic approach to designing modern and sustainable communities that make a real difference for people,” said Robert Laudati, Esri’s director of global partners and alliances. “Their new Platinum partner relationship clearly demonstrates our shared vision to further implement geospatial solutions to support our mutual customers.”\n\nThe San Juan Water District in California recently hired HDR in partnership with Esri to solve an information management challenge. SJWD became the first water district to implement Esri’s utility-mapping solution, ArcGIS Utility Network, enabling them to quickly identify system and customer impacts during outages. It also helped engineering and operations teams proactively determine areas exposed to potential vulnerabilities.\n\n“Projects like SJWD demonstrate how we can drive efficiency, and we could not do this without Esri,” said Doug Morrison, HDR’s director of data solutions.\n\nAuthoritative GIS data is now available to all of SJWD via web applications, mobile applications, and a portal. The data is also fully integrated with hydraulic model and asset management software, as well as financial and customer systems, providing improved communication throughout the entire organization.\n\nTo learn more, visit the Esri Partner Network.\n\nAbout Esri\n\nEsri, the global market leader in GIS software, location intelligence, and mapping, helps customers unlock the full potential of data to improve operational and business results.
