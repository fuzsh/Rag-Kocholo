        "text": "California Institute of Technology, Resnick is renowned for its groundbreaking contributions to various scientific fields, including molecular biology, gene sequencing, nanoscience, neuromorphic computing, quarks, quasars, and seismology, among others. However, what may be less known is Caltech's significant role in translating these fundamental discoveries into practical technologies that enhance people's lives. These innovations encompass catalytic converters for smog reduction, early electric vehicles, modern-day electronics, and even advancements in surfboard design. In this forum, President Thomas F. Rosenbaum of Caltech, alongside Resnick, will delve into these remarkable achievements and share the captivating stories of the individuals who spearheaded these advancements.\n\nThomas F. Rosenbaum brings his expertise in the quantum mechanical nature of materials to his role. He has a distinguished research background at Bell Laboratories, IBM Watson Research Center, and the University of Chicago, where he held positions as Vice President for Research and for Argonne National Laboratory, as well as provost.\n\nJoin us for the inaugural event hosted by the Inland Empire Journalism Innovation Hub+Fund at the Inland Empire Community Foundation (IECF). Dr. Paulette Brown-Hinds, publisher of Black Voice News, will engage in a thought-provoking conversation with Dean Baquet, former executive editor of The New York Times. They will explore the vital role of media in democracy and the impact of community-engaged journalism on strengthening civic engagement in the Inland Empire.\n\nEstablished in 2022 by Dr. Brown-Hinds, the Inland Empire Journalism Innovation Hub+Fund at the IECF is dedicated to enhancing cooperative journalism through a network of locally owned media outlets, nurturing a local pipeline of journalists, and building trust across the region.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to be part of a critical discussion that will shape the future of journalism in our community."
