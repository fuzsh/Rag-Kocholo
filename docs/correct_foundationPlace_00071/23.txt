A Groundbreaking Partnership

The Spatial Business Initiative is a unique partnership between the University of Redlands School of Business & Society and Esri®, the global leader in geographic information systems (GIS) and location intelligence. The partnership aims to maximize the understanding and effectiveness of GIS in business through education, research, publications, and consulting.

Education has always been an important part of our mission. The business world is increasingly relying on spatial data today to make better-informed decisions, so it is more important than ever that students have a foundation in location intelligence.
