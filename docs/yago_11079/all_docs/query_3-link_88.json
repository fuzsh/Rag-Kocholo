        "text": "In the year 1952 a simple stone was placed at the Amsterdam Eastern Cemetery as a reminder to Auschwitz.\n\nThe memorial was replaced in 1977 by the Mirror memorial, designed by Jan Wolkers. It was also moved to the Wertheimpark. Later the memorial was considered too small and that's why Jan Wolkers designed a new and bigger Mirror memorial: the present one.\n\nThe memorial reflects the sky through broken mirrors, because the sky will never be the same after Auschwitz.\n\nAt this day all Auschwitz memorials are being held at the monument, followed by a remembrance-lunch.\n\nThe text by the memorial reads:\n\n\"The downfall of the Jews in the Netherlands\n\non May 10, 1940, the day of the invasion by Nazi Germany,\n\n140,000 Jewish men, women and children lived in the Netherlands.\n\nBetween July 15, 1942 and September 3, 1944 were\n\nmore than 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands.\n\nOnly 5,200 survived the Nazi concentration camps and returned.\n\nAuschwitz and Sobibor were death camps in Poland,\n\nmainly built for massacre.\n\nFor 95,000 Jews from the Netherlands were these camps their final destination.\n\nNot more than 500 of them have survived.\n\nAuschwitz has become a symbol of\n\nthe attempted destruction of the Jewish people.\n\nThis monument is erected in commemoration of the hundreds of thousands,\n\nthe millions of victims of racial delusions.\n\nThis is a place of remembrance and grief, of guilt and repentance,\n\na warning for all generations throughout the world.\"\n\nDo you have more information about this location?
