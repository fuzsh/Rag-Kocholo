Titian dominated Venetian painting during the years of its greatest achievement and, along with Raphael, set the standard for European court portraiture. The Getty's Portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos, painted in 1533, is one of Titian's most influential portraits. The exhibition presents a close look at this exceptional work and will include Titian's Penitent Magdalene, also from the Getty's collection, as well as an historical portrait by Titian of the same sitter, The Allocution of Alfonso d'Avalos, on loan for the first time in the United States from the Museo del Prado in Madrid. In addition, the exhibition will include several contemporary illustrated books drawn from the Getty Research Institute's vast collections."
