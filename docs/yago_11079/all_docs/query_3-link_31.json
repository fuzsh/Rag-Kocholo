Primarily working through a design-build process, GDK brought together a design and construction team on each project that was experienced in the manufacturing type of construction and was able to transform the needs into a reality for Magna.\n\nGDK was first invited to provide a proposal for an 84,000 sf addition and renovation to one of Magnaâ€™s existing facilities in Holland, MI. As a result of a very successful 1st project that was completed on time and came in under the original project budget, GDK has been hired to complete several additional medium to large scale projects that continue today."
