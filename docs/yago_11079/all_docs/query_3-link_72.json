        "text": "At The Slow Road we answer to many names (wanderers, bon vivants, students of life) but first and foremost, we’re a group of dedicated travellers.\n\nThat’s why we love compiling reading lists that include those books—from novels to memoirs, and everything in between—that have really opened up our favourite regions.\n\nIn this post we’ll round up a few of our favourite books about Holland, the land of tulips and windmills.\n\nMust-Read Books About Holland\n\nThe Undutchables: An Observation of the Netherlands, Its Culture and Inhabitants\n\nBy Colin White\n\nA laugh-out-loud, irreverent guide to understanding Dutch character and habits through an examination of the home, money, children and politics.\n\nLearn more on Amazon >>\n\nThe Mirror of the Artist: Northern Renaissance Art in Its Historical Context\n\nBy Craig Harbison\n\nA concise survey of German, Dutch and Flemish art of the 16th and 17th centuries. The art historian author illuminates the important themes of the period, including realism, patronage, guilds, religious ideals, specialties and travels to Italy.\n\nLearn more on Amazon >>\n\nAmsterdam: A Traveler’s Literary Companion\n\nEdited by Manfred Wolf\n\nOrganized by district, these 17 contemporary short stories by modern Dutch writers, including Cees Noote-boom and Geert Mak, are all set among the canals, cafés and neighbourhoods of Amsterdam.\n\nLearn more on Amazon >>\n\nTulip Fever: A Novel\n\nBy Deborah Moggach\n\nIn 1630s Amsterdam, tulipomania has seized the populace. Everywhere men are seduced by the fantastic exotic flower. But for wealthy merchant Cornelis Sandvoort, it is his young and beautiful wife, Sophia, who stirs his soul. She is the prize he desires, the woman he hopes will bring him the joy that not even his considerable fortune can buy.\n\nIn this richly imagined international bestseller, Deborah Moggach has created the rarest of novels — a lush, lyrical work of fiction that is also compulsively readable. Seldom has a novel so vividly evoked a time, a place, and a passion."
