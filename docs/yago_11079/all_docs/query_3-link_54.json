        "text": "CLIENT OBJECTIVE\n\nMagna Mirrors is one of the largest producers of automotive mirror and vision systems. Having outgrown their Holland South facility, Magna Mirrors was inclined to consolidate multiple operations to the same building, resulting in the need for an expansion of their manufacturing wing. They requested a cohesive “world-class” design both internally and externally.\n\nPD SOLUTION\n\nThe design team at Paradigm was able to incorporate both the new and existing facades to give the entire building a cohesive look and feel while incorporating monumental elements and focal points to guide customers and employees to the appropriate entrances. The largest addition was made in the manufacturing wing, which includes a multifunctional area that serves as a cafeteria and meeting space. A food prep and vending area were also constructed as well as an enlarged employee locker room and restroom facilities."
