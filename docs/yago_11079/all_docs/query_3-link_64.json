Instead of a conventional flat mirror, the customer desired a sculptural, three dimensional piece with many random folds and bends. This is achieved by inflating and deflating the piece many times, clamping down certain areas to create new folds in the material.\"\n\n\"After the final polish, it was securely packaged for shipping over to California, where it is now being enjoyed by its new owner in Los Angeles.\""
