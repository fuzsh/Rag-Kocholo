        "text": "The cultural centre SODAS 2123 is inviting to join in for the celebration of the 700th anniversary of Vilnius city with events addressing some pertinent questions in relation to spatial policy and encouraging to work together for a dynamic, contemporary city, which would be open for discussions.\n\nSpaces and buildings are projections of our rules, conventions, imaginations and dreams. Although architecture as a practice of spatial production is intertwined with political issues, in Lithuania we often leave this connection behind aesthetic or functional considerations, seemingly forgetting the political. In the international academic context however the architectural and political studies are gaining importance, while in practice there is also a shift towards the search for different methods of spatial agency.\n\nThe symposium Politics of Space brings together boundary crossing experiences of researchers and practitioners, architects and artists, and invites to explore together how political issues are intertwined with processes of spatial production at different levels: from smallest spatial units and our relationships in domestic environment, to agreements that shape regions and geopolitical territories.\n\nThe event seeks to deepen the understanding of architecture as a practice of the politics of space (raumpolitik) and its potential in changing social and economic structures in relation to questions such as gender equality, social inclusion, decolonisation, reduction of climate change and other.\n\nThe symposium will continue as an exhibition at gallery Atletika, showcasing the participants’ research and artworks, including unique work produced for the event. The exhibition will run until 16 October.\n\nMore information about the participants and the programme will be announced shortly.\n\nThe project is part of Vilnius 700th anniversary programme.
