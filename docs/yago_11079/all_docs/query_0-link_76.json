        "text": "Outline\n\nINTERFILM was founded 1955 in Paris by delegates of Protestant film associations in Europe. Jan Hes from The Netherlands is appointed as General Secretary, fulfilling this task until his death in 1991.\n\nIn 1961, an INTERFILM Prize is awarded for the first time. The film chosen is \"Wild Strawberries\" by Ingmar Bergman.\n\nThe first festival juries arise 1963 in Berlin and Mannheim, Oberhausen follows in 1964, Cannes in 1968; because the festival is cancelled after student protests, the first INTERFILM Prize in Cannes is awarded only in 1969. The winner is \"Easy Rider\" by Dennis Hopper.\n\n1973 the first Ecumenical Jury is created in Locarno, the members being appointed by INTERFILM and OCIC (Office Catholique International de Cinema, later SIGNIS). More ecumenical juries are built in Cannes (1974) and Montréal (1979). Since the nineties, most festival juries involving INTERFILM delegates are ecumenical. Pure INTERFILM juries exist in Luebeck (since 1996) and Venice (since 2011).\n\nSince 1989 Hans Werner Dannowski from Hannover as president (till 2004), and Hans Hodel from Bern as jury coordinator, since 2004 also as president, shape the INTERFILM acitvities.\n\nIn 2005 INTERFILM celebrates its 50th anniversary in Locarno. In the same year, Julia Helmke publishes her dissertation on the history of church film festival commitment (\"Kirche, Film und Festivals. Geschichte sowie Bewertungskriterien evangelischer und ökumenischer Juryarbeit in den Jahren 1948 bis 1988\" - Church, film, and festivals. History and criteria of Evangelical and ecumenical juries from 1948 till 1988).\n\nIn addition to festival observation and festival valuation INTERFILM regularly organises seminars and conferences, the first already in 1957 in Swanwick (UK), 1966 in Arnoldshain near Frankfurt/M, several times in The Netherlands and Switzerland, and 1987 in Colombo. 1997 a series of conferences entitled \"Faces of Europe - Europe's Face\" is launched in Bad Segeberg, followed by Riga (1999), Sofia (2011) Iasi (2003) and Crete (2004).\n\nAt the Berlinale 2000, the first INTERFILM website is launched.\n\nMarks in the history of INTERFILM\n\nfrom 1955-2005\n\nGeneral Assemblys and other meetings\n\nby Hans Hodel\n\n1949\n\nFilm Congres of the “Service Cinémathographique d’Evangelisation (SERCINEV) in Paris with representatives of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and of church film services from several European countries with propositions for future collaboration.\n\n1955\n\n22th October\n\n(1.)
