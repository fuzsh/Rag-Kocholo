        "text": "We've enjoyed several good slightly offbeat documentaries and I'd love to see recommendations for more. By this I just mean that they're not things that clearly align with a school subject. For example, we really enjoyed Life of Mammals, Life of Birds, etc. when we were studying zoology. So not that. More like things about unexpected subjects or follow a variety of issues or things that don't fit neatly into a single category.\n\nThe two that come to mind are Between the Folds, about origami, and Objectified, about the design of everyday objects.\n\nAny other well made, engaging documentaries that you and you kids have enjoyed together? Bonus if it's on Netflix or available online easily.\n\n\"You Have Used Me as a Fish Long Enough\" and others by BBC director Adam Curtis. Even the title sounds quirky. They are excellent movies and I highly recommend them, but not till at least Logic stage. Somewhat like Connections they pull together a whole lot of information from many areas, but they are all (or the ones I have seen) dealing with events from 1900 till present and mainly recent past, not long past, and are more about propaganda and politics in history and less about science in history.\n\nCooking Your Life was different and not a fit in any exact category. Not sure if I have the title exact. It features a Buddhist monk/chef. I think younger kids could possibly appreciate it.\n\nWe saw one of service dog training that was very good.\n\nTake Back Your Power doesn't fit any exact category and was one my logic age son thought so important he insisted I post about it after we saw it. He feels it is a subject that other his age should know about for the good of the world. It is a good fit with the Adam Curtis and Connections films, but easier to understand IMO than Adam Curtis films or Connections films. At age 11 my ds can understand Connections and Take Back Your Power, but the Adam Curtis films are still a bit of a reach.\n\nWe saw a wonderful documentary film about Spirit Bear, but I cannot recall the title now.\n\nSouth of the Border is excellent, though maybe not so quirky as you seek, and again a Logic stage or older film.\n\nArt Made the World\n\nThe Ascent of Money. also logic stage, IMO.\n\nOther films besides the Story of 1 by Terry ______ -- such as histories of the middle ages are very quirky in terms of the way they are done, though all of those including the Story of 1 to me fit in with standard academic subjects (history, math).\n\nMaybe Paper Clips.\n\nIncredible Human Journey if it is the one with a female anthropologist--I may have title confused with another.\n\nFor younger kids, the documentary parts that go with the Young Indiana Jones have a lot that we found good, for example, an introduction to opera better than anything in our music materials."
