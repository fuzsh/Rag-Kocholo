        "text": "So how do you live like a movie?\n\nFirst, do not live vicariously. Stop loving your favorite movie’s life. Stop loving athletes’, artists’, and other famous people’s lives while laying on your sofa — and hating YOUR life.\n\nLiving life like a movie is a mindset. You have the ability to turn every situation into an adventure. An experience. Imagine you end up on an island, alone, with no resources. You can start crying and die, or you can see the situation as a movie, put a big smile on, and start an adventure, a super fun one.\n\nNow, imagine if characters in movies would wait for things to happen to them. That would be a hella boring movie, don’t you think?\n\nMovies are interesting because characters MAKE them interesting. Go out there and live your life like a movie. Be the main character of your life. Like greatJoe Rogan said, “be the hero of your own movie”.\n\nNow, do you want to live your life like a great movie, or a boring one?\n\nA good movie is unpredictable, just like your life should be. Make your life interesting. Include surprises. Explore. Create. Conquer. Maybe you want to live life like an action movie. Or maybe you want to live life like a french movie. Make a choice and be the main character."
