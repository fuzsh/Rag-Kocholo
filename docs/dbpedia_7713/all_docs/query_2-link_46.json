        "text": "Director Taika Waititi has pulled off an impressive feat with \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\" (opening in additional cities nationwide July 8). He has crafted a film with a light-hearted, adventurous tone that makes fun romp totally enjoyable for older kids, but is sentimental (but not saccharine) and sharply written enough for adults to embrace.\n\nIn short: Troubled orphan Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) and his prickly misanthrope foster parent \"Uncle\" Hec (Sam Neill) escape into the wilds of New Zealand, relentlessly pursued by a dogged social worker. (Watch the trailer)\n\n\"Wilderpeople\" immediately feels like a book-to-film adaptation - but in a good way. Waititi has fleshed out a rich world with characters who, at first blush, appear to be caricatures - yet they radiate charm, humanity and depth.\n\nYoung Ricky, described as a \"bad egg\" (pronounced \"igg\") does, in fact, appear egg-shaped at the beginning of the film - his street \"kicks\" and ridiculous city kid clothes only make him look wholly unprepared for life with his new foster parents on a rural farm. He claims to have \"homies\" back in the city, but he's more likely to whip out a quick haiku about his feelings than he is to act like the streetwise \"gangsta\" he aspires to be. His effervescent \"Aunt\" Bella is a pure beam of sunshine wrapped in a handmade cat sweater while gruff \"Uncle\" Hec is a man of few words and even less patience for Ricky's antics.\n\nThe characters are eccentric. \"Wilderpeople,\" in tone and execution, shows flashes from the Wes Anderson playbook of quirk. But what makes \"Wilderpeople\" extraordinary is how genuinely heartfelt it is. The oddly charming idiosyncrasies of this story merely accent a sincere story of two misunderstood outcasts looking for something reliable in their world. This film is more than just a fun little jaunt into the woods; \"Wilderpeople\" is firmly rooted in its mismatched pair of heroes. While their journey is a fun ride for the audience, it's even more fulfilling to watch Ricky and Uncle Hec radically evolve from the sullen characters we first meet in the first act.\n\nAfter his 2010 coming-of-age dramedy \"Boy\" and the acclaimed, silly vampire mockumentary \"What We Do In the Shadows,\" (which was arguably the best comedy of 2015) \"Wilderpeople\" absolutely proves Waititi is no fluke.\n\nFinal verdict: Waititi deserves every credit for turning what could have been a straightforward story into a moving, entertaining and hilarious journey. This is certainly one of the great cinematic adventures of 2016. And Ricky's birthday song is pretty incredible.\n\nScore: 4/5"
