        "text": "It marks the beginning of an awards process that saw last year’s selectee, Irish-language drama An Cailín Ciúin, stage a phenomenal run after being widely embraced by the Oscars Academy.\n\nCountries worldwide put forward a contender in the category each year, and Kneecap, which is also in Irish, will now be among the eligible nominees for International Feature Film at the Oscars in 2025.\n\nAn Cailín Ciúin was whittled down to the final five for Oscar night last year after winning over a wide base of Academy Awards voters. While it didn’t win the Oscar on the night, international interest in the film led to its release in dozens of countries and strong box office at home and abroad.\n\nKneecap, which is released in US cinemas today (August 2), will be released in Irish cinemas by Wildcard Distribution on August 8.\n\n“The Irish Academy is delighted to announce Kneecap to represent Ireland in the Oscar International Feature Film category,” said IFTA Academy CEO Áine Moriarty. “What a brilliantly creative powerhouse of a film, with its bold and fearless storytelling and its raw and boisterous screen performances.”\n\nThe film - which is written and directed by Rich Peppiatt - stars real-life rappers Móglai Bap, Mo Chara and DJ Provaí alongside an ensemble cast which includes Michael Fassbender and Simone Kirby. In the film they play three Belfast rappers who set out to create their own genre of Irish punk rap. In doing so, they become the unlikely figureheads in a movement to save their mother tongue.\n\nKneecap was picked by the Irish Film and Television Academy’s selection committee, which included actors Stephen Rea, Liam Cunningham and Bríd Ní Neachtain, directors Colm Bairéad and Lisa Mulcahy, and producer Rebecca O’Flanagan.\n\nReacting to the selection, Kneecap members Móglai Bap, Mo Chara and DJ Provaí spoke of their delight at the recognition for the film.\n\nMo Chara said: “We want to thank IFTA for selecting our film to be the Irish submission for an Oscar. For a culture that was so brutally oppressed for so long, the language was almost driven to extinction, now it’s on the biggest stage of the world and it’s an absolute privilege.”\n\nDJ Provaí added: “Is mór an onóir dúinn gur roghnaigh IFTA Kneecap mar a roghnaíseachú don Oscar - tá muid fíor bhuíoch astu… agus go raibh maith agat as ucht an Oscar!” (“We are honoured that IFTA has chosen Kneecap as its Oscar shortlist - we are truly grateful… and thank you for the Oscar!”)”\n\n“One thing we’ve noticed in America is it resonates internationally,” Mogali Bap added. “It's an international story and makes people reflect on their own culture and language, and to consider the relationship they have with their indigenous or native language.”\n\nKneecap had its world premiere at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where it won a NEXT Audience Award - the first Irish-language film to win at the festival. At last month’s Galway Film Fleadh, it won three prizes, including the Audience Award."
