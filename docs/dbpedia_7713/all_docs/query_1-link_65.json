        "text": "The 'Golmaal' series director said he is no mood to experiment.\n\n\"No director wants to make a flop film. Also, it is not necessary that all commercial will do well. I should feel like doing something different from within, as of now, I don't like making an offbeat film. I am happy making people laugh,\" Rohit told PTI in an interview here.\n\n\"Today, you have Rs 100 crore club instead of silver and golden jubilee. Box office has always been very important for directors,\" he said.\n\nThe 'Chennai Express' director said he is happy on success of Salman Khan's latest release 'Kick' and does not see other film's success as a competition.\n\n\"We all make films for audiences to enjoy. So, if a film does a good business, I don't see it as competition,\" he added.\n\nOn his long term association with popular 'Golmaal' series and now taking 'Singham' as a franchise film, Rohit said he has tried making films of different genres like comedy and action.\n\n\"It is not that we only want to make 'Golmaal' and 'Singham' series films. I was making comedy films for some time and then I thought of trying an action one, and we came up with 'Singham',\" Rohit said.\n\nRohit's last directorial venture, a romantic-comedy 'Chennai Express' with Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, had set the cash registers ringing, making Rs 200 crore business. Ask him if he is willing to try different genres such as thriller, horror or a biopic film, he said, \"There are no plans as of now... There is no particular subject or person in my mind for a biopic.\"\n\nSticking to his trademark mass entertainers, the 41-year-old director is all excited about his next release 'Singham Returns' with Ajay Devgn reprising the role of a cop.\n\n\"When we were making 'Singham', we did not think it will become such a huge brand. We are happy everyone loved it, but there are no plans as of now for the third instalment. It all depends on how this ('Singham Returns') works,\" Rohit said.\n\n'Singham Returns' also starring Kareena Kapoor releases on August 15."
