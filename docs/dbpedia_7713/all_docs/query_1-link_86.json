        "text": "After a commercial film like Cocktail, what made you go offbeat again with Finding Fanny?\n\nWho says Finding Fanny is offbeat? Okay, it's not your usual fare of song and dance but it's a pretty universal story about love and longing told in my way. It explores absurdist humour. The characters do not react to situations the way one would normally expect them to. (Laughs) Shit man! This sounds a tad offbeat to me but it's really not!\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind Finding Fanny?\n\nYears ago I read about an Italian postman in a small village who had got arrested for not delivering letters for a year. He’d just go to the post-office, collect the mail, go home, drink beer and chill all day. When they caught him, they found his spare room with piles of undelivered letters up to the ceiling. That got me thinking about what would happen if I lived at that time, wrote a letter proposing to the love of my life and presumed that her non-reply was a rejection. I’d end up living a life of regret till I realize that the letter had never ever been delivered to her. Yup, so that was the seed of the story.\n\nCocktail contributed in making Deepika Padukone the superstar that she is today, how do you feel about her success?\n\nI feel so happy for Deepika when I see how she keeps honing her craft. I know the massive effort she puts into every single role that she does. I genuinely feel there’s so much talent there to exploit. I don’t think that even Deepika knows where her full potential can reach. But she is very intelligent and focused and will keep pushing the boundaries.\n\nTell us about Ranveer Singh’s cameo in Finding Fanny\n\nRanveer is a friend and always up for a laugh. There are few people who can really crack me up and when he doesn’t try, he is one of them. He shot for just half a day but we kept laughing so much that he stayed on for ten days while we continued the shoot.\n\nTell us something about Dimple Kapadia. She’s always been a part of your films...\n\nI love that woman! She is game for anything and she has a heart of gold. We trust each other implicitly, but she needs constant affirmation from me and she is never satisfied with her shot. I never knew that she has done a film called Bobby as a teenager. She scolded me while shooting for Fanny. She said, \"I was known for a film called Bobby that made me into an industry’s darling and now you bring me back to Goa decades later and make me wear a huge prosthetic bottom and paunch and you've made me into a BOBBA!!” She’s hilarious!\n\nWhat made you rope in Arjun Kapoor as Savio?\n\nArjun and I go back to the Being Cyrus days where he wanted to do the 'Making of Being Cyrus' or be an assistant director but then couldn’t for some reason or the other. He's a sensitive actor and I enjoyed his debut in Ishaqzaade. I knew that he has had experiences in his life that he could draw from for the character of Savio. I’m very particular about having a strong back story for every character that rarely makes it to the film but is very helpful for the character to achieve a unique identity. Arjun has done such a perfectly pitched and understated job in Finding Fanny and I’m very impressed the way he is growing as an actor.\n\nHow was the experience of directing Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapur?\n\nJoyful! They are brilliant actors with different approaches. Naseer is all soul. He is so experienced and knows exactly how to work it. There’s no warming up in a scene. Naseer pretty much nails the first take and then we explore variations. This is the first time I worked with Pankaj and he blew me away. He is brilliantly prepped and meticulous about his characters details, which he then imbibes effortlessly. Pankaj is impressively consistent. You know, contrary to his serious image, he’s actually a very shy guy. In spite of his regimented lifestyle, I find Pankaj totally non-judgmental and a great guy to hang out with. It’s a different process that each actor shares with a director that makes it all so interesting.\n\nThe film is having a premier 17 days before the release. Aren’t you worried about the story being out?\n\nFinding Fanny is not a thriller where the story needs to be kept under wraps. It's more about immersing into an experience with a bunch of oddball characters and that is the fun of the viewing experience even if one knows the story.\n\nDo you think that the audience expects something different from a Homi Adajania film?\n\nI wish I knew what the audience wants but I don’t think I ever will. What I do know that I want something different from myself every time or I won’t be interested in doing it.\n\nThe film is originally in English, you think you’ll lose out on a large chunk of an audience that prefer films in Hindi?\n\nThe film is originally in English because that is the organic language for the story. The characters are Catholics in Goa who primarily speak in English. The Hindi dub will be released at certain venues and in smaller towns where Hindi is primarily spoken. It was a decision that was taken after seeing the cut because it is a film that should be accessible to a non-English speaking audience. I mean if it is being subtitled or dubbed in various languages from French to Korean why should we discriminate and not share it with an exclusively Hindi-speaking audience? And the reason for opting for a dub is that out here the audience prefers a Hindi dub to Hindi subtitles.\n\nSo what next after Finding Fanny?\n\nAccording to some papers I am doing three or four films next year. I don't think that's possible for someone like me unless I was cloned and I don't think that would be a good idea for the human race at large."
