        "text": "Most people learn that you should use \"a\" before words that start with a consonant, and \"an\" before words that start with a vowel. That's actually not quite right. The real rule is to use \"a\" before words that starts with a consonant, and \"an\" before words that start with a vowel sound.\n\nEx. I just need an hour more before I run my errands.\n\nWho hasn't heard the jingle \"I before E except after C, or when sounded as 'a' as in 'neighbor' and 'weigh\"? But with all the exceptions to the rule, it's no longer really considered a good rule of thumb. Merriam Webster even debunked it with a little jingle of its own.\n\n\"I before e, except after c\n\nOr when sounded as 'a' as in 'neighbor' and 'weigh'\n\nUnless the 'c' is part of a 'sh' sound as in 'glacier'\n\nOr it appears in comparatives and superlatives like 'fancier\n\n'And also except when the vowels are sounded as 'e' as in 'seize'\n\nOr 'i' as in 'height'\n\nOr also in '-ing' inflections ending in '-e' as in 'cueing'\n\nOr in compound words as in 'albeit'\n\nOr occasionally in technical words with strong etymological links to their parent languages as in 'cuneiform'\n\nOr in other numerous and random exceptions such as 'science', 'forfeit', and 'weird.'\""
