So make yourself comfortable, and let’s start!\n\nClassic Good Ways to Say Goodnight in English\n\nThere are numerous expressions in English for different occasions, and there is no exception when it comes to evening goodbyes. Depending on the context, your relationship with the other person, and other circumstances, you can choose how to say goodnight using different phrases. So, let’s start simple and explore the most classic and traditional ways to bid farewells in the evening and examples of using them in common sentences.\n\nGoodnight.\n\nThis is probably the most common and versatile expression you can use to wish someone a good night. Depending on the circumstances, it can be both polite and casual simultaneously. You can say it to your friends, siblings, and parents or write in polite e-mail to coworkers, clients, and many other people. For example:\n\nGoodnight, Mom. See you in the morning.\n\nI’m going to bed now. Goodnight, everyone.\n\nWishing you a peaceful night ahead. Goodnight!\n\nSleep well.\n\nThis is another way to say goodnight in English. It is more relaxed than the previous one, so you can choose it when communicating with people you are close to. For example:\n\nMake sure to get plenty of rest. Sleep well!\n\nI hope you can relax and sleep well tonight.\n\nSending you good vibes for a restful sleep. Sleep well!\n\nSweet dreams.\n\n…are made of this. If you are familiar with this song, then you probably know this expression. It is also quite casual and can be used in various situations. For example:\n\nClose your eyes and drift off to sweet dreams.\n\nSweet dreams! May your night be filled with pleasant thoughts.\n\nAs you lay your head down, I wish you nothing but sweet dreams.\n\nUntil tomorrow.\n\nThis evening farewell is great to use when saying goodnight to someone you’ll definitely see the next day. It is polite and neutral so that you can say it to both your siblings and coworkers. For example:\n\nI’ll bid you farewell for now. Until tomorrow!\n\nRest up and recharge. Until tomorrow, my friend.\n\nLet’s say goodnight with the promise of seeing each other again. Until tomorrow!\n\nSleep tight.\n\nThe last expression on this list is also quite casual, but it is probably the best way to say goodnight in relaxed settings. When using it, you wish your interlocutor the warmest and coziest sleep possible. For example:\n\nRemember to snuggle up and sleep tight.\n\nWishing you a snug and cozy night. Sleep tight!\n\nDon’t let the bedbugs bite! Sleep tight, my dear.\n\nCasual Goodnight in English: Spicy Slang for Friendly Talks\n\nIn some cases, especially when communicating with friends, you want to use some unusual farewells.

You can find them all in the list below.\n\nCatch you later.\n\nThis is a great expression suitable for verbal communication and text messages. You can use it when talking to friends, colleagues, siblings, or acquaintances. For example:\n\nAlright, I’m heading off to bed. Catch you later!\n\nI’ll see you tomorrow at work. Catch you later, buddy.\n\nGonna log off now. Catch you later, alligator!\n\nNighty night.\n\nIt is another slang way of saying goodnight to someone, popular in both American and British English. It is casual, so keep in mind to use it in more informal settings. For example:\n\nTime for bed. Nighty night, everyone!\n\nOff to sleep now. Nighty night, my little ones.\n\nSending you all my love. Nighty night, sweetheart.\n\nPeace out.\n\nThis expression is also very casual and informal. It is a great way to bid evening farewells to your buddies and peers.

See you in the AM for breakfast.\n\nLights out.\n\nTypically, this expression means “bedtime,” but it can also be used as a slang way to say goodnight to someone. For example:\n\nTurning in for the night. Lights out, everyone!\n\nTime to dim the lights and unwind. Lights out, family.\n\nSleep mode activated.
