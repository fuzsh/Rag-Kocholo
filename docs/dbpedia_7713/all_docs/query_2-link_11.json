        "text": "duc748 Â· 02/10/2023 23:52\n\nI've watched a couple lately. First, fun but daft French comedy Represent, in which the French electorate is given an unlikely choice in a presidential contest. Then, (and I haven't finished it yet) Swedish comedy-drama Anxious People. A hostage drama? Or is it? Enjoyable story-telling, I think.\n\nClark (Sweden, Netflix). Think the episodes are nearer an hour, but it's a limited series so only four eps. Very offbeat, with Bill Skaarsgard as a (much) embellished version of a real life bank robber. Cheeky and loads of fun.\n\nI'm watching that now, thanks! I'm not sure it's really 'off-beat' in the same way; I had a flight of fancy that it could have been Rock Hudson and Doris Day! ðŸ˜€\n\nGood fun, anyway!\n\n@duc748\n\nIâ€™m glad someone else apart from me is watching, and enjoying it. Iâ€™ve mentioned/recommended it before on here and to my friends and family, but I donâ€™t know of anyone else who has been watching it!\n\nItâ€™s good fun, and I enjoy seeing Sofieâ€™s clothing and all the Scandi styling.\n\n\"Framed!\" Two series on netflix dubbed from Italian and funny in a \"stupid on purpose\" way.\n\n\"Nobody dies in Skarnes\" also on netflix\n\nI've just finished the first season of Love and Anarchy. Well, it's better than the average rom-com (a pretty low bar, tbf). But stylishly done, and a lot of fun. I did gasp at Max's implausibly gorgeous and tidy bachelor pad, though! And creepy husband getting steadily creepier as it went on."
