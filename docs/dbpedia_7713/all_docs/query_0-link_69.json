        "text": "About Nini\n\nHello, I'm a passionate language tutor, performance practitioner, and avid lover of theatre and film. Originally from a multilingual background, I fluently speak German, Russian, English, and Georgian. I'm currently completing my Master's Degree in Theatre and Performance practices, after having graduated with a BA in Acting and Theatre-Making.\n\nTeaching for me is more than just a profession, it's a vocation. I strongly believe in the transformative power of education, especially when it comes to languages and the performing arts. Learning a new language or refining your acting or presentation skills can not only open up new opportunities but also reshape the way you perceive and interact with the world.\n\nWith my unique background, I aim to instill a love for learning, encourage creative thinking, and boost self-confidence in my students. I offer a welcoming and inclusive learning environment, where each student's unique abilities are recognized and nurtured.\n\nThrough my teaching, I hope to inspire others to explore the diverse avenues of language, theatre, and film. I bring to the table my rich experience, cultural understanding, and ability to make learning engaging, fun, and impactful.\n\nAs a tutor, I am professional, reliable, and committed to my student's growth and success. My lessons are meticulously planned, yet flexible, catering to each student's individual needs and goals. So, whether you're embarking on learning a new language, refining your acting skills, or seeking to enhance your presentation abilities, I am here to guide you every step of the way.\n\nTeaching is an exchange, a journey that we undertake together. I look forward to sharing my passion, knowledge, and experiences with you, and to learning from your unique perspectives as well. Remember, every step you take in learning is a step towards a broader and more enriched understanding of the world. Let's embark on this journey together!\n\nSee more\n\nAbout the lesson\n\nElementary School\n\nMiddle School\n\nSophomore\n\n+7\n\nlevels :\n\nElementary School\n\nMiddle School\n\nSophomore\n\nJunior\n\nSenior\n\nAdvanced Technical Certificate\n\nAdult Education\n\nMasters\n\nDoctorate\n\nMBA\n\nEnglish\n\nAll languages in which the lesson is available :\n\nEnglish\n\nWith a diverse background in Theatre and Performance practices, my approach to tutoring is student-centered, flexible, and creatively stimulating.\n\nMy teaching methodology relies on a blend of practical exercises and theory. For language lessons, I utilize immersive learning techniques, encouraging students to engage with the language in real-world contexts. For acting and film criticism classes, I draw upon my experience in theatre-making, employing a range of interactive, analytical, and interpretive strategies. For presentation skills, my focus is on building students' confidence and enhancing their ability to communicate effectively and authentically.\n\nA typical lesson duration is one hour, however, this can be adjusted according to the student's individual needs. In each class, I strive to create a nurturing environment where learners can explore, question, and grow at their own pace.\n\nI hold a BA in Acting and Theatre-Making and I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Theatre and Performance practices. Fluent in German, Russian, English, and Georgian, I have leveraged these skills to assist students from different age groups and proficiency levels.\n\nWhether you are a beginner, an advanced learner, a student looking to polish your language skills, an aspiring actor, or someone who wants to improve their presentational abilities, my lessons are tailored to meet your specific goals and interests.\n\nSee more"
