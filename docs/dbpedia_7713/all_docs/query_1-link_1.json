        "text": "Cliff Owen’s British crime drama in which an MI5 man infiltrates the world of new-style criminals behind the robberies that fox the Yard. Starring William Sylvester, Anthony Dawson and Mai Zetterling.\n\nThe story concerns a Scotland Yard agent who deliberates changing to a life of misconduct after going secret to team up with a group of gem thieves.\n\nWilliam Sylvester gives an okay performance in his double role as Layton and Steve, the man who is welcomed by the group of thieves, while Anthony Dawson is alright in his role as James Dawson and Mai Zetterling is reasonable as Ruth Lombard.\n\nThe direction from Owen is okay but it should have been better, such as showing more facial expressions to…\n\nI rarely say these kinds of things about movies, but Offbeat could have stood to be longer and really needed a much more cinematic plot.\n\nThe thing with heist movies is that the best ones are both meticulous and have a ring of truth about them in a way that isn't so pedestrian to real life.\n\nWith Offbeat, the grand heist just being that this gang of thieves set up a construction tent in an alley and dug a tunnel into the bank is actually probably something that could/would/did happen somewhere, but it feels very stupid and low stakes. Like... either you're going to get instantly nabbed trying to pull off this robbery, or you're going to get away with…\n\nThe Third Summer of Scam\n\nCliff Owen's best two films, The Wrong Arm of the Law and A Prize of Arms, were to come shortly after Offbeat.\n\nSo this could be seen as a bit of a warm-up for those films, another crime offering with a good cast made to work with an undercooked story. The concept, of an MI5 officer infiltrating a gang of robbers, has intrigue, especially when it becomes clear that William Sylvester has other ideas about his future than just busting the gang.\n\nIt's just not especially thrilling seeing him sitting around in meetings a lot and hanging around Mai Zetterling's flat. The heist itself is quite well done and gets across what an arduous, long…\n\nWilliam Sylvester plays Layton, an American MI5 agent, working for the police and being sent undercover to infiltrate a criminal organisation. That's quite a lot of layers to work your way through, but the film manages to go one step further still when he falls for Ruth (Mai Zetterling) and threatens to go native.\n\nAnd as if all that isn't different enough for you, there's also the nature of the gang, which is run along the lines of a business, with employees, a secretary, respectable looking, suited money men, and the promise of a pension. The boss (Anthony Dawson) even makes the point that there's little difference between a criminal enterprise and big business.\n\nIf that sounds like a familiar…"
