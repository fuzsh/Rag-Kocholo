        "text": "\"Do you ever suffer from feelings of weariness?\" It's time to feature another excellent short film. This one is called You Are Whole, and it's written and directed by Laura Spini, playing at numerous film festivals all over the world before landing online. The short stars well-known actor Fred Melamed as a spiritualist missionary who becomes mistaken for a serial killer in a sleepy British seaside town. This takes a bit to get going, but it's pretty good. The comedy is dark but intelligent and she nailed the casting with Melamed. It's the kind of short that makes you think more than anything. Looking forward to seeing Spini make a feature.\n\nShort description for this film from Vimeo: \"An offbeat comedy short about a spiritualist missionary who becomes mistaken for a serial killer in a sleepy British seaside town.\" You Are Whole is written and directed by Laura Spini, produced by Laurence Brook.
