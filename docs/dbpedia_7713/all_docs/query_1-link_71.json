        "text": "CHRISTOPHER MUNCH'S sweetly intimate film, \"The Hours and Times,\" takes a footnote from the history of the Beatles -- a 1963 weekend getaway to Barcelona, Spain, by John Lennon with the group's manager, Brian Epstein -- and spins it into an imaginary portrait of a relationship. One of the aims of the trip is to explore the boundaries of a friendship that is as complicated as it is close. Epstein is in love with Lennon, who doesn't return his passion but is open-minded enough to consider the possibility of sexual involvement. Finally, in an awkward encounter in a hotel bathtub, the boundaries become more set.\n\n\"The Hours and Times,\" which will be shown in the New Directors/New Films series on April 3 and 4, epitomizes the attitude of many of the films to be presented in this year's festival, which begins screenings this evening at the Museum of Modern Art. At a time when the mass media's portrayal of the world tends to put everyone into cliched niches, many of the film makers are looking at relationships in ways that are far more problematic than Hollywood's cookie-cutter mentality admits.\n\nThe Australian Jocelyn Moorhouse's film \"Proof\" is similarly open-ended in its darkly comic portrayal of the relationships among a blind photographer, his love-smitten housekeeper and a waiter who helps the photographer to take his pictures.\n\n\"The film is about three people who see themselves in a very negative light, as powerless,\" Ms. Moorhouse says. \"What interested me most was the concept of someone shut off from the visual world most of us share, but who refuses to accept that. At the same time, I didn't want to sentimentalize blind people, for I don't believe a handicap automatically ennobles someone.\" Ms. Moorhouse's film opens the series, which is jointly presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the department of film of the Museum of Modern Art. For the next two and a half weeks, New Directors will present 22 programs, representing 14 countries, at the museum's Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters."
