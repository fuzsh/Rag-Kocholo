        "text": "Early life\n\nD'Arbanville, born May 25, 1951 in New York City, New York, is the daughter of Jean (née Scott), an artist, and George D'Arbanville, a bartender, and attended PS 41 on Eleventh Street. She went to High School at Quintano's School for Professional Children.\n\nCareer\n\nD'Arbanville acted in her first film in 1960 at age 8; a New York University student film about a girl and her cat, titled Tuesday and Blue Silk. Andy Warhol discovered her during a gig as a club disc jockey when she was 13, and cast her at age 16 in his 1968 film Flesh.\n\nIn the late 1960s she was a model in London, where she met Cat Stevens and they developed a romance. She was the inspiration for at least two of his hit songs: \"Lady D'Arbanville\", and \"Wild World\", which were released on Mona Bone Jakon and Tea for the Tillerman, respectively. She left him for periods of time to continue her modeling career in Paris and New York City, and was a part of Warhol's Factory scene. In an interview with Warhol, she said wistfully that she'd heard the song \"Lady D'Arbanville\": \"Steven wrote that song \"Lady D'Arbanville\" when I left for New York. I left for a month, it wasn't the end of the world was it? But he wrote this whole song about 'Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still.' It's about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him it was like I was lying in a coffin... he wrote that because he missed me, because he was down... It's a sad song.\" (Cat Stevens was a stage name which D'Arbanville never used; she preferred his true name, Steven Demetre Georgiou.)\n\nAfter Flesh, D'Arbanville performed in Warhol's L'Amour (1973), and as the title character in David Hamilton's movie Bilitis (1977).\n\nAfter her unabashed risqué performances in her youth, D'Arbanville has worked steadily in film and television series in the United States and France. In 1987, D'Arbanville won a Drama-Logue Award as Best Actress for her 1987 stage performance, in Italian American Reconciliation. She was well known for her role as Lt. Virginia Cooper on the FOX series New York Undercover.\n\nPrivate life\n\nD'Arbanville had a relationship with singer/songwriter Cat Stevens years before he became known as Yusuf Islam. Their breakup, as noted above, was the inspiration for at least two of his songs, \"Lady D'Arbanville\" and \"Wild World.\" Later, D'Arbanville had a relationship with actor Don Johnson from 1981-1986, the couple had a son, Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982).\n\nD'Arbanville has been married three times, with each of her marriages ending in divorce. She lived in France for 10 years, becoming fluent in French, and was married to French actor Roger Miremont then known as 'Roger Mirmont' from August 1, 1975 to 1980. From April 26, 1980 to 1981, her husband was Steve Curry. She was then married to former New York City firefighter Terry Quinn from June 15, 1993 to March 12, 2002; they have three children, Emmelyn, Alexandra, and Liam.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1968 Flesh Patti 1970 House, TheThe House Lorraine 1971 Blood Letting, TheThe Blood Letting Hillary 1973 L'Amour Patti 1975 Rancho Deluxe Betty Fargo 1977 Bilitis Bilitis 1977 La fille d'Amérique Ronni Williams 1978 Big Wednesday Sally Jacobson 1978 Fifth Floor, TheThe Fifth Floor Cathy 1979 Main Event, TheThe Main Event Donna 1979 Time After Time Shirley 1980 Hog Wild Angie Barnes 1981 Modern Problems Darcy Carson 1985 Real Genius Sherry Nugil 1985 Boys Next Door, TheThe Boys Next Door Angie 1988 Call Me Cori 1988 Fresh Horses Jean 1989 Wired Cathy Smith 1994 Frame-Up II: The Cover-Up Barbara Griffin 1996 Fan, TheThe Fan Ellen Renard 1997 Fathers' Day Shirley Trainor 1998 Archibald the Rainbow Painter Elaine Tiger 1998 Celebrity Iris 2002 Personal Velocity: Three Portraits Celia 2003 Tale of Two Pizzas, AA Tale of Two Pizzas Margie Bianco 2007 Perfect Stranger Esmeralda 2007 You Belong to Me Gladys 2008 Marconi Bros., TheThe Marconi Bros.
