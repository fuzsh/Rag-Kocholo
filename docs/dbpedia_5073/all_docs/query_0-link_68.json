        "text": "This article explores Warhol and Nico's relationship with Europe through their formative years and subsequent collaboration in Warhol's underground and experimental filmmaking. In the 1950s Warhol was a commercial artist in New York, circulating in a gay milieu, and his work often conveyed Europe and a European sensibility in its illustration of 'all things Europe', but especially fashion. Nico was a fashion model and frequently seen in European fashion magazines before landing a few film roles, including a small part in La dolce vita (Fellini, 1960) and a featuring role in the French erotic film StripTease (Poitrenaud, 1962). Nico moved to New York and found her way to Warhol's art studio and social scene known as The Factory. At The Factory Nico joined the art-rock group The Velvet Underground at Warhol's insistence and featured in several films Warhol made between 1966 and 1967, including Chelsea Girls (Warhol, 1966) and a number of portrait films called Screen Tests (Warhol, 1964–1966). This article explores the presence and negotiation of Europe in both Nico's and Warhol's life and work in the 1950s and 1960s. The article pays particular attention to their early careers and the shifts in Nico's persona demonstrated by the difference between the French StripTease and Warhol's experimental Screen Tests.\n\nThe American Pop artist Andy Warhol (1928–87) produced a series of colourful silkscreen prints in 1982 of a Roman-era bronze head of Alexander the Great. These prints were commissioned by Alexander Iolas (1907–87) to correspond with the blockbuster exhibition of ancient art and artefacts 'The Search for Alexander'. In this article we argue that Warhol’s vision of Alexander is postmodern because he encouraged his audience to receive Alexander’s identity from a multitude of viewpoints. We contrast the way that this head would have been understood in ancient times with the thinking about Warhol’s images in contemporary times. We note that there were many treatments of Alexander in popular culture, which meant that the American public was deeply engaged with questions about who this man was. By looking at the Alexander series this article contributes to an understanding of Warhol’s engagement with antiquity. Ultimately we interpret the print series using the history of nationalism, violence, and sexuality, emphasizing how in the postmodern era ancient ideas have been used for new purposes.\n\nA low-budget breakout film that wowed critics and audiences on its initial release, Stranger than Paradise would prove to be a seminal film in the new American independent cinema movement and establish its director, Jim Jarmusch, as a hip, cult auteur. Taking inspiration from 1960s underground filmmaking, international art cinema, genre cinema, and punk culture, Jarmusch's film provides a bridge between midnight movie features and a new mode of quirky, offbeat independent filmmaking. This book probes the film's production history, initial reception, aesthetics, and legacy in order to understand its place within the cult film canon. In examining the film's cult pedigree, it explores a number of threads that fed into the film – including New York downtown culture of the early 1980s and Jarmusch's involvement in music – as well as reflecting on how the film's status has developed alongside Jarmusch's subsequent output and reputation.\n\nFilm Criticism 39.2 (Winter 2015), special issue, \"New Approaches to Cinematic Identification,\" eds. Elizabeth Reich and Scott C. Richmond 1970s film theory was obsessed with sex and desire, but have we ever had a *queer* theory of the cinema? Not really: a heterosexual presumption was built into apparatus theory's key formulations, but on the other hand, yes: it is latent within apparatus theory's analysis of the structural conditions (technological, social and psychic) of the cinema. In order to make this clear, the essay turns to Metz's contemporary Andy Warhol, approaching him not as a gay iconoclast but as a theorist of the cinema, and putting him as such in conversation with Metz and Baudry, as well as Stanley Cavell and Linda Williams. Against those critics who have (for good reasons) sought to defend Warhol's films from the charge of \"voyeurism,\" the essay argues that what is indeed voyeuristic in those films discloses the voyeurism structurally inherent to the cinema and reveals it to be, if not always specifically sexual, fundamentally queer. Finally, it argues that even as apparatus theory describes a set of technological and spectatorial conditions that are no longer paradigmatic, its signal achievement was to lay bare the relation of technological elements to psychically dense modes of subjectivity, and as such it provides a crucial foundation for asking in what ways post-cinematic media produce a new orientation of, and technical infrastructure for, desire."
