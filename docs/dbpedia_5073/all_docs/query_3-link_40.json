        "text": "Last summer, Greenville filmmaker Chris White was feeling restless.\n\n“Cinema Purgatorio,” the semi-autobiographical feature film he produced with his wife Emily Reach White, was finished and entered into several film festivals, and they had hit a wall trying to raise money for their next feature.\n\nSo instead of waiting around to make one big film, the couple decided to make five smaller ones.\n\n“We’re were just feeling antsy, like we wanted to work,” White said. “But it was just taking too long to get on-set with that other movie. So we thought, ‘Hey, we’re around town for the summer, why don’t we just do this challenge where we try to make five short films within a 50-mile radius in Greenville.’”\n\nThe task they set for themselves: One short film every three weeks, which gave them a week to write a script, a week to shoot, and a week to edit the film.\n\nThe result is “Unbecoming,” an anthology of the five short films, shot around the Upstate and in Tryon, North Carolina, with local actors and a couple of Hollywood names: actress Patti D’Arbanville and veteran character actor Michael Forest.\n\nThe film will have its premiere April 3 in Tryon, at a red carpet event featuring D’Arbanville, Forest and other cast members, along with a question-and-answer session with White.\n\nD’Arbanville, who worked with Andy Warhol as a teenager, is a veteran of film and of TV series such as “The Sopranos” and “New York Undercover.” These days, she lives in Tryon, and she met the Whites at a private screening of “Cinema Purgatorio.”\n\nD’Arbanville said she attended that screening with “great trepidation,” fretting over what she could say if she didn’t like the film. The fear melted away soon after the opening credits.\n\n“I was sitting there, and I just couldn’t believe my eyes,” D’Arbanville said in a phone interview. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, this film is really good. I’m not going to have to figure anything out at all. Yay!’ So afterwards, I just started speaking with him and told him that story. I was really so very pleased that it was so very good, and so very happy that I didn’t have to lie about anything.”\n\nAs they spoke, White suggested they work together, and D’Arbanville eagerly agreed. But the role White created for her in the Southern Gothic comedy was quite a departure for the native New Yorker who started her career as a model.\n\n“I wanted to give her something she’d never done,” said White, whose production company is Paris MTN Scout. “I wanted to write against type, I wanted to challenge her. I wanted her to have fun.”\n\nAnd write against type he did; “Unbecoming” marks D’Arbanville’s first role as a goat herder.\n\n“I have a goat that has gone astray,” D’Arbanville said. “And I find myself in this politician, this senator’s office. And it’s not really clear why she’s there, or if there’s a reason other than her goat. … It’s an interesting concept.”\n\nPlaying the senator is Forest, a character actor whose lengthy list of credits includes a role in Tom Hanks’ “Cast Away,” as well as appearances in classic TV series such as “Gilligan’s Island” and “Bonanza,” and more recently, in the web series “Star Trek Continues.”\n\nForest, who’s 86, met White a few years ago while working on “Star Trek Continues.” They became friends, and White asked Forest about the possibility of working together on a film. But Forest, who considered himself retired, wasn’t keen on the idea.\n\nThen “Unbecoming” came along. White had Forest in mind for the role of a senator with a secret.\n\nEven though it was a short film, “I was a bit reluctant,” Forest said in a phone interview. “When I read it, I thought to myself, ‘Anybody my age could do this part.’ It’s not because I’m who I am. And I said to him, ‘Anybody could do this.’ And he says, ‘I know, but I want you.’ It was very flattering for him to say that.”\n\nFrom White’s perspective, Forest’s larger-than-life screen presence was perfect for the role.\n\n“I wanted to give him a role that really fit the gravitas that I believe he has onscreen.” White said. “You look at his face, he looks like he belongs on Mount Rushmore … so I wrote him the part of a retired U.S. senator who has the deepest, darkest secret of the 20th century (and) he knows it, and he shares it. And it’s just great.”\n\nThe project turned out to be a lot of fun for Forest.\n\n“For me it was just an exercise in acting. … I love to work with Chris because he knows what he’s doing. He’s a very good director. He has a good crew with him,” Forest said.\n\nD’Arbanville said White reminds her a bit of Woody Allen, with whom she worked on the 1998 film “Celebrity.”\n\nAllen, she said, “casts people that he knows can do what he wants them to do without too much back and forth. He’s not a very social person. He just has a vision, and he lets you go, and he figures that you understand his vision and will figure it out. And I thought Chris, as an actor as well, was very attuned to the personalities and … the foibles of an actor’s emotions, and he was able to kind of corral that.”\n\nIn addition to D’Arbanville and Forest, the cast of “Unbecoming” features several Greenville actors, including Teri Parker Lewis and Jack Peyrouse, and much of the crew is local as well. Shooting locations, in addition to Tryon, included Greenville’s Holy Trinity Anglican Church and Christ Church Episcopal Upper School.\n\nEach of the five vignettes runs between seven and 13 minutes, and the entire film clocks in at about 40 minutes. In the beginning, White approached each one as a short individual film, with no plans to group them together as an anthology.\n\nAfter the film was finished, White felt a bit like he’d written a collection of short stories. Then, as he looks at the finished product, he can trace what he was thinking when he created the work.\n\n“It kind of shows you where your mind was, the ideas that were important to you at the time when you were writing them,” he said. “There were definitely some recurring themes in the shorts, so they do play well together.”\n\nFOR MORE"
