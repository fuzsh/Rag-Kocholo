        "text": "Contrast with the young Cat Stevens from a few days ago. This is Cat Stevens at his metier. It’s the difference between an artist who hasn’t yet established who he wants to be, and one who has. Mona Bone Jakon was only his third album, and compared to the previous two, I have to say that it should be considered the first real Cat Stevens album. Stevens put out his first music on Deram Records, a Decca affiliate label best known for also being home to an equally uncomfortable with himself young David Bowie, as well as important artists like Whistling Jack Smith and Martin’s Magic Sounds. It was a record label that seemed to specialize in a certain type of music hall-ish campiness, and Cat Stevens was, for a time, their biggest attraction. They tried very, very hard to shove him into the role of peppy little pop star, and he was so intensely stressed out by the pressure that his immune system gave out and he nearly succumbed to tuberculosis. Fortunately, the near brush with death led to a quantum leap in maturity, and after a long convalescence, Stevens returned to the scene his own man. He grew a beard, started wearing comfortable clothes, found himself a real record company, and wrote intelligently about meaningful things. He became the Cat Stevens we know and love. Until another close brush with death brought about a radical transformation…\n\nCan this be any cuter? Because when you take ‘Cat’ as your stage name, you will inevitably be photographed piled high with kittens. Also, we have two utterly adorable promo videos of youthful mid-sixties Cat Stevens trying to do the foppy pop star thing. (He later wrote more than one marginally grouchy song about having to do the foppy pop star thing.) Not everyone is well suited to prancing around in a velvet le smoking while surrounded by listless women dancers. Cat Stevens most definitely was not. The fact that, more than anything else, he resembles Bilbo Baggins, does not help his bid for teenybop idol. Soon, he would find his true calling writing heartfelt folk songs and bringing the ‘sensitive beard’ look into fashion.\n\nCat Stevens’ Numbers is about just that. Not having read the tie-in children’s book, I can’t fully recount the concept, but it has to do with a group of anthropomorphic digits from one to nine who have an identity crisis when someone named ‘Jzero’ comes into their world. Which is really a rather off-the-wall concept for either a kid’s story or an album. Luckily, Stevens didn’t fall into the concept album trap of taking the concept entirely too seriously. You wouldn’t immediately guess that there was a concept, until you read the liner booklet. Cat Stevens, as usual, carries his ideas lightly. You could make out, with context, that this song is about paranoid numbers who’ve discovered the wizardry of double digits. You could, with the literal-minded visual aids in the video below, assume it was about a magic show or the trade of magicianship. Or you could – and I suspect this might be the intention – broadly interpret it as an expression of bewilderment and wonder in the face of forces greater than ourselves. Weird little concept to wider spiritual metaphor – all in a day’s work for Cat Stevens.\n\n“Longer than what?” is what I’ve always wanted to ask. That’s a dumb question, I know. Obviously it’s a reference to Greek mythology, wherein the Tillerman ferries souls across the river Styx and into the underworld. The Greeks did not consider the underworld either a good or a bad place; it was simply a place for souls to go, where they would be neither punished nor rewarded. The boat would take you there regardless of your earthly behavior, though paying the tillerman would help assure your arrival. Thus, families buried their dead with a few coins or valuables to pay the toll. No word on whether throwing a tea party worked just as well. Another guess would be it’s a reference to long boats, which were used by the ancient Greeks, the Vikings, and many, many other cultures up to the present day. The phrase “longer boats are coming to win us” could be a warning of a Viking attack or a pirate raid. Cat Stevens, being Greek, would have at least a passing interest in the mythology of the long boat and the tillerman, and knowing him, it sounds like he’s trying to make a point about appreciating life before the inevitable boat journey takes you away. According to Stevens himself, though, he was inspired by an alien abduction he experienced, presumably while tripping balls.\n\nCat Stevens with cats! Cat Stevens with cats! In the sixties, obviously, when literal-minded publicists made their wards pose in undignified ‘funny’ situations. Luckily for him, Stevens wasn’t all that popular in the sixties, so he didn’t have to spend too much time being goofy and cute amid piles of kittens. Although posing with piles of kittens sounds like pure heaven on earth. The problem isn’t the kittens, it’s the goofiness. Cat Stevens is a serious artists who demands to be taken seriously, dammit. Or he re-positioned himself as such in the seventies and soared to success as a mild-mannered dreamboat. Today he remains a role model for sensitive singer-songwriters with beards; I like to think of them as sensitive-beard types. And this song here is very much a sensitive-beard song. You can imagine this coming on some college radio station or being on the soundtrack of a movie about teenagers in love. Sensitive-beard music may go out of style sometimes, but it always comes back around.\n\nAnd now, a children’s song by Cat Stevens. I actually feel that a lot of Cat Stevens’ songs are children’s songs, not necessarily by intention. I thought Wild World was a children’s song for the longest time and still think it makes more sense as such. I think it’s because Cat Stevens seems like a nice friendly guy who would be down to play stuffed animals or have pretend tea party or whatever. Like a favorite fun uncle. When I was a child I loved his music and I kid of related to him in that way. And as an adult I think he’d be a great tea-and-snuggles buddy. A lot of rock stars are kind of terrifying, for a variety of reasons, and you don’t really feel like you’d honestly like to be around them very much, especially not alone. You could get stabbed by a heroin needle or something. All of which I realize is just an illusionary fantasy based on a pretty one-sided perception of public image. Lots of people who seem scary are big fluff-bunnies in real life, and a few who seem harmless turn out to be seriously twisted. But I think we can agree that Cat Stevens is very probably a person who you would ask to babysit your kids, you know, if he wasn’t world famous, and filthy rich, and deeply religious.\n\n(Photo via The Swinging Sixties)\n\nThere’s nothing more wildly romantic than writing a song for your soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend to win back her heart. But maybe you’d have better luck if the lyrics didn’t imagine her being cold and dead. Such was the mistake Cat Stevens made when his girlfriend Patti D’Arbanville took off to pursue an acting career. Or, as she recalls it, “I just have to be by myself for a while to do what I want to do. It’s good to be alone sometimes. Look, Steven [Stevens’ given name] wrote that song when I left for New York. I left for a month, it wasn’t the end of the world was it? But he wrote this whole song about ‘Lady D’Arbanville, why do you sleep so still.’ It’s about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him it was like I was lying in a coffin… he wrote that because he missed me, because he was down… It’s a sad song. I cried when I heard it, because that’s when I knew it was over for good.” Having a musical sulking fit probably wasn’t the most mature reaction on a personal level, but fortunately for everyone not involved in Stevens’ and D’Arbanville’s relationship, it did produce some of his greatest love songs. This one, with its vaguely medieval atmosphere, is pure tragic romance. The other D’Arbanville song is the much warmer Wild World, in which the singer sadly concedes his lover’s need for freedom. D’Arbanville’s acting career, by the way, turned out to be such that I have difficulty finding images of her that do not feature her naked breasts. Whether or not Stevens experiences any secret vindication that his ex never progressed beyond D-list soft-core sexploitation is unknown.\n\nhttp://www.youitube.com/watch?v=9ik1pxav-CM\n\n(Photo via Fuck Yeah Sexy Old Rockers)\n\nCutie pie! There’s lots of rock stars who make you want to do all sorts of depraved things. For example, think of all the depraved things you would do with Robert Plant. Go ahead, I’ll wait…\n\nSome guys just make you want to bust out your bad-girl panties. Cat Stevens, on the other hand, is the kind of dude you want to snuggle and drink tea with on a cold, cold night. Obviously, that’s not a realistic fantasy, because he’s old and married and religious, and even if he weren’t all of those things it’s still unrealistic and a tad creepy that you’re having all these tea-drinking snuggle fantasies about people you’ll never cross paths with in a million years, but anyway. For all I know Cat Stevens could be a total jerk. Appearances can be deceiving, after all. The point I’m making is just that his music has a warm and comforting effect, and it’s really great for teatime snuggle activities, and I can’t help but extrapolate that impression towards his whole personality. It could be it’s just me, though, because I absolutely loved Cat Stevens when I was a child, and things you love as a child tend to carry over warm and fuzzy feelings. But I think I’m not wrong.\n\n(Photo: Adventure Through Inner Space)\n\nI don’t know why, but I used to find this song delightful and now it kind of gets on my nerves. Mind you, I generally love all things Cat Stevens. I think I might not enjoy this song like I used to because it sounds very much like a children’s song. The album Numbers was based on a children’s book, actually, so it’s not surprising. It’s not meant to be a children’s album though, as far as I know. Some of the songs feel more like children’s songs than others (while some are quite sophisticated), but overall it’s definitely a proper Cat Stevens album aimed at regular, adult-size Cat Stevens fans. It’s not my favorite Cat Stevens album, but it’s a solid entry in his classic seventies period. I’ll admit the more childish sounding songs have become my least favorite, and I’m sure that growing up has something to do with that.\n\n(phot0: Cat Stevens With Pets)\n\nI had a lot of thoughts about the excellent symbiosis of Cat Stevens and Harold & Maude, and just how much that was a match made in heaven. I was thinking about it so hard that I couldn’t wait until this song came up on the playlist so I went ahead and wrote than essay and posted it with a different song. Really jumped the gun on that one. No regrets or anything. It was a decent enough piece of writing and I still agree with myself. But I should have waited, because this songs is THE Harold & Maude song. Not just in the literal sense that it written specifically for the film and wasn’t culled from an album or destined to be a single. It’s that when Cat Stevens wrote it, he just nailed the whole movie down in just a few lines."
