(Weinstein would be convicted of two felony counts in 2020, but an appeals court would overturn the conviction in 2024.)\n\nIn 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, the gunman who massacred 19 children and two teachers at an Uvalde elementary school a day earlier, warned in online messages sent minutes before the attack that he had shot his grandmother and was going to shoot up a school.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Actor Ann Robinson is 95.
