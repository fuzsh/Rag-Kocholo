        "text": "Book boat\n\nBook boats () were small merchant ships used by itinerant booksellers in China during the Ming and Qing dynasties. History Although the practice of itinerant merchants travelling along rivers and canals to sell books may have originated as early as the Song Dynasty, book boats' ubiquity to the Chinese book trade arose during the Ming Dynasty in response to expansions and repairs to waterway infrastructure. alt=A map of the Grand Canal|thumb|The Grand Canal was a vital waterway utilized by book boats to bring books to the capital at Beijing. The Jiangnan region along the lower Yangtze saw widespread infrastructure improvements during the Ming dynasty. The complex network of rivers, lakes, and canals in the region was maintained and expanded by the Ming state, allowing passenger and merchant vessels to travel between towns and cities across eastern China. The city of Huzhou, in Zhejiang, became a major center for book publishing and printing, so associated with the itinerant booksellers that book boat merchants were often referred to as \"merchants of Huzhou\" even when coming from other regions. The Grand Canal was reopened under the reign of the Yongle Emperor () in order to supply the newly establish capital city of Beijing. In addition to the flow of grain to the capital, massive numbers of books were shipped from Jiangnan via the canal. During the High Qing era, Beijing saw heavy demand for books, met mainly by book boats plying the canals from Jiangnan. This was intensified during large editing projects such as the compilation of the Siku Quanshu under the Qianlong Emperor. Although mainly bringing rare books to sell to scholars and bureaucrats, the book boats also brought more popular works, especially including law books. Floods and blockages along the Grand Canal in 1824 led to the disruption of this trade, and saw publishers move operations to Beijing in order to meet demand for legal texts. River and canal infrastructure declined as a means of transport in China over the course of the 19th century. Especially following the 1850–1864 Taiping Rebellion, itinerant book peddlers were sidelined in a reorganized book trade. Business practices Bookstores were rare during the High Qing, often only found in market towns and major cities. As such, book boats were common in rural areas and smaller towns along river routes. Some peddlers specialized in rarer books for scholars and officials, while others sold for vernacular consumption across the Jiangnan. Songjiang, Hangzhou, and Dantu were major hubs for book trading and frequented by book boat traders.

Description Miller Mountain is located northwest of Cooke City, Montana, in the Beartooth Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. It is set within the New World Mining District and the Custer-Gallatin National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north slope drains into headwaters of the Stillwater River, whereas the south slope drains into Sheep Creek → Soda Butte Creek → Lamar River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises above Sheep Creek in . The mountain is composed of gabbro, Miocene breccia, and Eocene monzonite porphyry.Contributions to Economic Geology, G. F. Loughlin, 1930, USGS Bulletin 811, US Government Printing Office, p. 35–36. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and has been featured in publications since at least 1911.Mineral Resources of the United States, USGS, US Government Printing Office, 1911, p. 492. The mountain is named after Adam \"Horn\" Miller (1839–1913), who was one of the four trappers who discovered and named the New World Mining District in 1869, with the others being Bart Henderson, J. H. Moore, and James Gourley.Black Diamonds from the Treasure State, Robert A. Schalla, Indiana University Press, 2024, Grants Mining Districts of the Western United States: Volume 2, Jerry Grant, Xlibris Corporation, 2020, Adam Miller staked a claim that he called Shoo Fly Mine at the 9,300-foot-elevation level on the south slope of this mountain which would bear his name.The New World Mining District, The Historical Marker Database, Retrieved 2024-08-04. From 1878 through the late 1880s, the Shoo Fly produced gold, copper, and lead-silver ore, but it closed in 1893 to never reopen. (Henderson Mountain is east-northeast of Miller Mountain). Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Miller Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below 0 °F with wind chill factors below −10 °F.

It is structured as a cooperative and produces chocolate from domestically grown cocoa beans. It was founded in 2014 by a group of Togolese entrepreneurs who had trained as chocolatiers in Italy. Most of its chocolate is sold locally at affordable prices, but a few sales have been made to international buyers. Chocolate bars produced by Choco Togo are unique in that they are heat resistant, able to withstand temperatures of up to . Founding Choco Togo was established as part of an international project started by the European Union in 2013. The project, titled \"Fair, Young, Sustainable, Inclusive, and Cooperative\" aimed to \"promote cooperative and inclusive thinking\" among youth in Togo. Sixty Togolese youths were trained in entrepreneurial practices and cooperative living by the association, with the support of Côte d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic, and Italy, the sponsor country. Six individuals from the larger group were then selected to travel to Sicily, Italy, for further training in chocolate making. During their time in Sicily, the trainees received instruction in cocoa processing, fair trade, tourism, and e-commerce. Upon returning to Togo, the trainees learned that domestic cocoa processing had not been attempted in the country since the colonial era, and most Togolese cocoa farmers did not know about chocolate. The trainees therefore decided to create a brand of \"Made in Togo\" chocolate and founded the Choco Togo cooperative in March 2014. Operations At the beginning, Choco Togo was funded solely by its founders. The cooperative lacked the high-performance machines used in Sicily to produce high quality chocolate, and resorted to working with unsuitable equipment. However, these financial and equipment issues were alleviated in 2015, when Choco Togo won a number of entrepreneurial and agricultural awards which included millions of West African francs in prize money. Later that same year, the cooperative held the first chocolate fair in Togo, and received an order for 4,000 chocolate bars from Togo's Ministry of Posts and Digital Economy. To source high-quality cocoa, Choco Togo tasked the Federation of Unions of Coffee-Cocoa Producers with identifying a domestic cocoa producer with organic certification. A producer representing 1,500 smallhold farmers in Akébou Prefecture was selected. Once harvested, the cocoa is transported to Kpalimé, Akébou Prefecture, where forty local women perform the initial processing, which includes sorting, roasting, shelling, and grinding. The resulting powder is then sent to Lomé, where it is refined into chocolate paste. The paste is tempered and molded into chocolate bars, most of which are sold locally at affordable prices. However, Choco Togo also sells chocolate to Asky Airlines and at one point exported 2.2 tonnes of cocoa beans to Japan. Community projects Choco Togo runs a community development project called Chocoland, which uses the cooperative's mutual savings and microcredits to fund the development of a cocoa farming community in Danyigan, a village in southwest Togo. In 2018, the cooperative expressed its goal of building a health center in the village to reduce the local maternal and infant mortality rates. Organisation Choco Togo is a member of the Association of Coffee-Cocoa Processors in Togo, which is part of the Interprofessional Council of the Coffee-Cocoa Subsidiary. This council includes producers, exporters, buyers, and consumers. Products Choco Togo's chocolate bars have a rough texture that makes them heat resistant. They can withstand temperatures of up to , making them ideal for market stallholders in Togo, which has a tropical climate and a temperature range of . In 2016, the price of an bar was 1,000 West African francs, or about 1.5 euros. Aside from chocolate bars, the cooperative also sells various derivative products, such as hot chocolate, chocolate cake, and other confectionaries. Choco Togo's chocolate is fair trade certified.

The creation of the website followed the disruptive 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and allows access to a database of recent eruptions and their details. The website's design was subsequently used in creating the website European Catalogue of Volcanoes that covers a larger area, and which has much, but not all the functionality of the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes. Current Status The website displays information on 32 Icelandic volcanic systems in English or Icelandic. It also provides information on the Beerenberg volcano. History Volcano observatory functionality in Iceland was prior to the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption partially joint funded by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) The initial June 2010 meeting of the International Volcanic Ash Task Force (IVATF), created by the ICAO after the eruption, had a working paper on improvement of volcanic monitoring and advice presented by the World Organization of Volcano Observatories that recommended increased support for the volcano observatories of the world. Seed funding originally came from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2010, for what was projected as a 3-year project to collate relevant knowledge and create a comprehensive catalogue readily available to decision makers, stakeholders and the general public. In September 2011 this project analysing and categorising volcanic activity in Iceland was noted to be beneficial for the larger long term risk assessment project funded by the Icelandic government. Later funding also came from the European Commission with the FUTUREVOLC project. By 2012 the task mainly financed by the ICAO, to improve the knowledge and behaviour information in the then catalogue of Icelandic volcanoes supplemented by information about ash particle grain-size distribution was reported to be underway. Prepublication extracts of the new catalogue were being used by 2014. The web site was showcased in April 2015 to praise and a beta version launched later that year with data on Bárðarbunga, Grímsvötn, Hekla and Katla. The website was launched formally internationally in 2016, and is official. The Global Volcanism Program website recognises it as an additional web resource. In 2019 the Icelandic version of the website was launched. By November 2020 the almost identically formatted Catalogue of European Volcanoes website went live, initially with information on active volcanoes or volcanic areas monitored by France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as Iceland. In 2024 the two websites were recognised in a peer-reviewed academic paper on tephra dispersion as important resources for modelling this. , of the two similar websites, only the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes has an additional data portal functionality.

History and description In 1451, the city gave permission for a nunnery of Observant Franciscans, following rules set forth by Bernardino of Siena (1380 – 1444), who would be canonized in 1450. The nuns were under the order of the Sisters of San Bernardini of the Penitent Third Order. A monastery with an adjacent oratory was erected by 1462. In 1513, one of the main patrons being a sister of the wife of the Count of Marsciano; four nuns were brought here from Sant'Anna in Foligno. In 1544 the monastery was transferred to Poor Clares.Guida Storico-artistica della citta di Orvieto, by Tomasso Piccolomini Adami, Tipografia Bernadini, Siena (1883); pages 142-143 The church of San Bernardino was built in 1657 to a design by Cosimo Poli, nephew of Bishop Cardinal Fausto Poli. Located between the Palazzo del Conte Lodovico di Marsciano (now called Palazzo Crispo Marsciano and the monastery. The church layout is elliptical and has four side altars. The cloistered nuns choir was located at the rear of the church. The main altarpiece depicts an Enthroned Madonna and child between Saints Peter and Paul with Saints Francis and Bernardino, attributed to Sinibaldo Ibi. Near the entrance, the travertine holy water stoup is attributed to Ippolito Scalza. The first altar on the right depicts the Education of the Virgin (circa 1650) and is attributed to Giacinto Gimignani. In the presbytery are two panels depicting the Blessed Angelina of Montegiove (also known as Angeline of Marsciano), and part of the family of the Counts of Marsciano, and including Bishop Giuseppe dei Conti di Marsciano, who consecrated San Bernardino in 1739. In 1581, the nuns sold the property to the west to Vicenzo Buzi, who built the Palazzo Buzi. They bought Palazzo Crispo Marsciano to the east in 1618.

Background Seductor was bred by Haras Argentino. Seductor was a light bay stallion with a heavy build. His hind legs were strongly built, especially his gaskins and quarters, and he had excellent shoulders. Racing career Seductor was considered one of the leading racehorses of his generation in Argentina. In the Gran Premio Jockey Club, Seductor was ridden by the famous jockey Irineo Leguisamo. In the stretch, he passed the front-running favorite and winner of the Polla de Potrillos, Remo, to win by three-quarters of a length in a final time of 2:03 for the 2000 meters. The win was the sixth Gran Premio Jockey Club win for Leguisamo and the second for Seductor's sire, Full Sail. The Gran Premio Nacional attracted the largest crowd to Hipódromo Argentino de Palermo since the match race between Botafogo and Grey Fox in 1918. That day's card set a record for betting handle in South America of m$n7,603,876. Seductor was the favorite, with field also including Remo, who had lost for the first time in the Gran Premio Jockey Club, Pinturera, winner of the Gran Premio Selección, HORSES Sedcutor took the early lead in the race and set a fast pace. 100 meters into the 2500-meter race, Caratón passed Seductor to take the lead and Remo came up to run next to Seductor in second. Around the first turn, Remo took the lead and Seductor fell back to fourth behind El Gurisito and Caratón. On the backstretch, El Gurisito took the lead, quickly opening up a 4 length lead. He maintained this lead into the final turn, at which point Seductor was running in joint-third with Recien behind Remo and Pinturera. In the stretch, Seductor made his move along with Caburé. 150 meters from the finish, Caburé took the lead from Remo with Seductor close behind. Seductor passed Caburé to win the race a neck in a final time of 2:36. Following the Gran Premio Nacional, Seductor ran in the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, finishing fourth behind Académico, who had beaten him previously in a non-stakes races, although Seductor was bumped in the race. Following the loss, Seductor won the Clásico Comparación, again defeating Caburé. Along with Académico, Seductor was named one of the best three-year-olds in Argentina in 1946 and rated equal to him at 132 pounds for 2500 meters. Seductor was the leading horse in Argentina in 1946 by earnings. Seductor was set to ship to Brazil to race in 1947, but didn't race again following the Clásico Comparación. Stud career After his racing career, Seductor was acquired by Miguel and José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz. He stood at stud at Haras Chapadmalal, Haras Comalal, and Haras Malal Hué. Seductor stamped his offspring with his own appearance, and his fillies generally did better than his colts. He is noted to have done well with mares by Rustom Pasha. As a broodmare sire, he nicked with Court Harwell. The mare Starling II, by Noble Star, was bred to Seductor multiple times, producing the full siblings Sideral, Sidérea, and Sagitaria, all successful and notable racers.

Camp Esterbrook was in the in the Laramie Peak area, closest town is the community of Esterbrook, Wyoming north of the camp. Camp Esterbrook is at about elevation near the Esterbrook Creek. Camp Esterbrook opened in spring 1944 and operated as World War 2 Prisoner of war (POW) camp. Today there are a few remains of the camp. Civilian Conservation Corps Esterbrook CCC Camp was one of 15 United States Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps in the state Wyoming during the Great Depression. Medicine Bow National Forest had other US Forest Service Civilian Conservation Corps camps: Ryan Park, Forest—at Pole Mountain, Chimney Park, Centennial Work Center, Arlington, Encampment, and French Creek. The worker first lived in tents and them built their own housing. The camp was made up of young unmarried men from the East Coast of the United States. The camp planted tree, build roads, trails, campgrounds, and US Forest ranger stations. The camp built the Esterbrook fire lookout. When needed the camp also worked as firefighters. Many of the Esterbrook CCC Camp projects are still in use today.https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5172968.pdf 100 YEARS OF CONSERVATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE, ON THE MEDICINE BOW \"The Civilian Conservation Corp\" Prisoner of war camp During World War 2, starting in spring 1944 German prisoners were housed at Camp Esterbrook. Camp Esterbrook prisoners of war were used for timber operations. Prisoner of war labor worked for civilian employers under the military officials and the Department of Agriculture's Extension Service. The camp worked six days a week, with Sunday off. The POW Labor Program benefited the US as there was shortage of labor during the war. About 75 POWs lived at the camp, with about 7 Army guards. Most POWs came from Camp Douglas (Wyoming). The local logging companies paid the prisoner labor, now lumberjacks, the same as local civilians. The POWs cut timber for railroad ties`. Evidence can still be found of the camp, including building foundations, wells and latrine pits. At the end of the war the camp closed in January 1946. At first the camp held Italian POWs. In April 1944 the Italians POWs were moved out. German POWs moved in. In April 1944 the Italians were able to volunteer for Italian Service Units, this was non-combat duty in special service units of the United States Army. To join the Italian Service Unit, each Italians volunteer could sign a pledge to perform any non-combat duty to help the United States against the now common enemy, Nazi Germany.JOURNAL OF GERMAN- AMERICAN STUDIES, VOL. 14, NO . 2 , 1979 During World War II, two large POW base camps, (Camp Douglas and Fort Francis E.

According to Christian hagiographic accounts, she was deported along with thousands of other Christians by Shapur I. After strengthening her fellow believers in the face of persecution and converting Persian women, she was reportedly tortured in various ways, imprisoned multiple times, and eventually executed by beheading. She is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which commemorates her on August 4th. However, some modern Orthodox hagiographers believe she might actually be a fictional character. She should not be confused with the martyr Eudokia of Heliopolis. Biography Hagiographic accounts Known exclusively through Christian hagiographic accounts, which begin with her capture by the Persians, she is believed to have originated from Asia Minor or Anatolia. After being captured along with a relatively large number of Christians, up to 9,000, during a military campaign by Shapur I, Eudokia was reportedly deported to Persia and placed in the service of a Persian officer's family. Through her Christian actions, she managed to soften her captors before converting them. She then became involved in providing moral support to other deported Christians and in converting many Persian women. These activities attracted the wrath of the Persian authorities, who flogged her before imprisoning her for two months. After these two months, she reportedly appeared again before the Persian officials and refused once more to renounce Christianity, leading to her being beaten with thorny rods before being sent back to prison for six months. Upon her release, the episode allegedly repeated itself; this time, she would have been bound in thorns pressed against her naked body, tearing away strips of flesh, and then tied to a gibbet with ropes used to break her bones. Finally, the saint was beheaded by her executioners. Legacy Her memory is celebrated on August 4 by the Eastern Orthodox Church; however, some modern Eastern Orthodox hagiographers express doubts about her existence. They believe she might possibly be confused with Eudokia of Heliopolis.

Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. History The building that would become the Ritz Theatre was originally built for retail in 1930. In 1939–1940, it was repurposed into the 386-seat News View Theatre (also known as Newsreel Theater), designed by Norton & Wallis and featuring a streamline moderne interior and art deco lettering on its exterior. The theater opened on May 2, 1940, boasting a policy of screening newsreels air-expressed from New York in 15 hours and London in 40. The theater's first screening included views of the siege of Warsaw, a special reel that applied words of Washington to European events of the day, and lighter fare such as sports, woman's issues, Lew Lehr commenting on bathing beauties, and various other items. The Bear's Tale, a Merry Melodies cartoon, was also screened, as was Carey Wilson's commentary on A Door Will Open and Pete Smbth's Spots Before Your Eyes. By 1944, the theater was owned by ABC Theatres. In 1949, the theater starting going by Hollywood Newsreel, and in 1954, it changed its name to New View Theatre as it transitioned from newsreels to features. In 1968, Pacific Theatres acquired the theater and renamed it Pacific New View, and the theatre was renovated, including the addition of a snack bar, in 1969. In 1974, the theater was taken over by the porno theater chain Pussycat Theaters, where Deep Throat would play for more than ten years, ending in 1989. Additionally, from August 1977 to January 1978, the theater's neighbor housed Los Angeles's first punk rock club in its basement, with a secondary access point through a staircase from this theatre. In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and while this theater is in the district, it was not listed as a contributing or non-contributing property. In 1989, the theater became the Ritz Theatre, which closed in 1991. It was managed by Johnny Legend and Eric Caidin. In 1994, the theater became a church, which closed in 2015. In November 2017, the building was reopened by Alki David as Hologram USA Theater, which closed one year later. In 2020, the building was used as a marijuana lounge. In popular culture This theater has been featured in numerous films, including Lethal Weapon, Alex in Wonderland, Death Wish II, Exit Through the Gift Shop, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

In terms of the overall history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the placement of a lifeboat at Oban is a relatively recent decision. An Inshore lifeboat was first stationed here in 1972. The station currently operates 13-50 The Campbell Watson (ON 1357), a All-weather lifeboat, on station since 2024. History With an general increase in leisure boating activity, and with the nearest lifeboat stations at and being over away, following a coastal review in 1971, the RNLI decided to place one of their larger Inshore lifeboats at Oban. An 18-foot Inshore lifeboat A-505 (previously given the All-weather designation 18-005) arrived at Oban on 5 May 1972. The boat was kept at a mooring off the wooden pier, and a small inflatable dinghy was donated by local architect and hotelier Bill Crerar, to be used as the boarding boat. A tin-roofed shed on the South Pier leased from the local council would become the 'lifeboat station', as a place to store all essential equipment. The first call for the lifeboat would come just 19 days later, when on 24 May 1972, three children, who had set out in their parents sailing dinghy, found themselves unable to return in the strong winds, and were rescued as their boat headed towards the rocks of Creag Island. A new lifeboat (A-511) was sent to the station in 1973. A contribution of £5000 towards the cost of the boat was received from the North British Hotel Trust. The North British Hotel Trust was set up in 1902, with half the shareholding placed in trust, to ensure that a percentage of the profits were distributed to charitable organisations. A service on 24 June 1974 resulted in the lifeboat towing a 16-ton vessel. Another call to two fishing boats, aground at Ardmore Point on Mull, took over two hours to reach the vessels. By 1976, it was clear that the lifeboat was being pushed to her operational limits, and sometimes beyond. In August 1978, Oban became an All-weather lifeboat station, with the arrival of a lifeboat, the Watkin Williams (ON 922). The boat was already 22-years old at this time, but had served well at , and been involved in at least two RNLI Gold Medal rescues under the command of Richard Evans. The Inshore boat would remain on service. Watkin Williams would serve Oban for 3 years, before being transferred to the relief fleet in 1981, and sold out of service in 1983. She was replaced for just one year by the Dorothy and Philip Constant (ON 967), another heading for retirement, but this boat having the advantage of being equipped with radar. However, at 8.25 knots, speed was still an issue. In 1982, the lifeboat was withdrawn, and Oban would be the first station to get a new class of lifeboat to replace the Dorothy and Philip Constant. The was a intermediate size lifeboat, with a crew of four, designed to meet operational requirements between the rigid inflatable Atlantic 21 class, and the larger lifeboats. Built by Lochin Marine of Rye, it had a GRP (Glass Reinforced Polymer) hull, and her twin Caterpillar 3208NA diesel engines would deliver 19 knots. Keen seafarers James and Ann Ritchie, of the Isle of Man brewing company Heron and Brearley, funded a lifeboat for , the James Ball Ritchie (ON 995), which arrived on service in 1970, shortly after James' death. Ann Ritchie, née Gough, President of the Ramsey Ladies Lifeboat Guild, decided to fund two more lifeboats; one for , 54-06 Gough Ritchie (ON 1051), and one for Oban. The new Oban lifeboat would be named 33-02 Ann Ritchie (ON 1080). Ann would attend and name the boat at a ceremony on 7 May 1983, and after a short trip on the boat, she was presented with a painting and a Caithness Glass bowl. These were returned to the station on her instruction, following her death in 1990. The residue of her estate became the Gough Ritchie Charitable Trust. One third of its income is distributed to the RNLI for use on the Isle of Man, and has so far funded two more lifeboats. At 03:32 on 31 January 1985, the Oban lifeboat Ann Ritchie was called to the aid of the 80-ton fishing vessel Shemara, aground on Lady's Rock, to the south west of Lismore Island. In poor conditions and shallow water, and in the dark, the 8 crew were rescued after 14 attempts. Awards were made to the Coxswain and crew. thumb|centre|350px| lifeboat14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227) On 16 July 1997, Oban would receive the lifeboat 14-23 Mara Edith Macdonald (ON 1227). This was a much larger, and much more powerful lifeboat, her twin MAN diesel engines giving a top speed of . The Trent-class lifeboat would serve Oban for more than half of the time the station has existed. In some years, over 100 callouts were made. In 2005, Mara Edith Macdonald was launched to the aid of the yacht Classic Wave which had lost power, with three people aboard. When the lifeboat arrived, the boat was aground on a shelf, and taking on water. Third mechanic Peter MacKinnon was sent aboard with a pump, but it had little effect, and the decision was taken to abandon the vessel. During this process, the boat suddenly slipped off the shelf and sank, a rope dragging MacKinnon under the water, but he managed to resurface, and all 4 men were rescued. Three men and a woman were rescued from an upturned dingy on 16 July 2023, off the Isle of Lismore. Spotted by a passing yacht, non were wearing life-jackets, and had been unable to call for help as they had no radio, and their phones were submerged. After 27 years on station, Mara Edith Macdonald was withdrawn to the relief fleet. Oban would receive a £2.2 million lifeboat on 4 March 2024, the same day as the RNLI 200th Anniversary. The boat was 2⁄3 funded from the legacy of Mrs Elizabeth Watson, née Campbell, who died aged 90 in May 2021. Two other legacies also helped fund the boat.

Goldman\n\nMark A. Goldman is an attorney and real estate entrepreneur who is notable for his work on the Marvin v. Marvin palimony case in the 1970s, as well as his co-founding of a real estate company in Southern California. Marvin v. Marvin case Goldman was the co-counselor for actor Lee Marvin in Marvin v. Marvin, a case that spanned through the 1970s. Michelle Triola, Marvin's ex-live-in girlfriend, sued Marvin for the equivalent of spousal support, or \"palimony\". Triola's attorney, Marvin Mitchelson, vowed to show that \"an unmarried couple lives exactly like a married couple\" and were subject to the same property laws upon separation; in response, Goldman agreed that the trial would \"test [the] acceptance of alternative lifestyles.\" Mitchelson said that the case \"is going to affect everyone who ever has a date\", according to the Associated Press. Goldman authored the legal briefs for Marvin in the case. His California Supreme Court brief received praise from the court in a footnote, which stated: \"We wish to commend the parties and amici for the exceptional quality of the briefs and argument in this case.\" The high court's decision gave Michelle Triola, actor Marvin's ex-girlfriend, an opportunity to prove they had an oral agreement for her post-relationship support. Goldman vowed that his client Marvin would \"make no effort\" to settle the suit but would instead go to trial against Triola. He told the Washington Post, \"If you want to get rid of a partner if you want to break up, it's much smoother to get married now because there are established court procedures. This is a much dirtier fight... The claims are getting more farfetched. These are bedroom contracts. There are never any witnesses. There's never any corroborating evidence. Some of the claims may be legitimate, but there's no way to distinguish the frivolous from the legitimate.\" Goldman estimated that Marvin's attorneys dedicated $300,000 worth of time to the case, plus expenses. After the conclusion of the trial, Goldman told the press, \"Judge Marshall has sustained Lee Marvin's position.\" Marvin himself called the result \"sensational\". Though Goldman and the rest of Marvin's trial team maintained \"a low profile in contrast to Mitchelson's high one\", Goldman's comments to the press during the trial were praised as \"disarmingly blunt\". Goldman also testified at a state Senate Judiciary Hearing concerning a bill to limit the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling; the bill did not pass. Goldman had opined that the bill would give rise to fraudulent claims. Real Estate Exchange On January 3, 1977, Goldman co-founded the Real Estate Exchange with partners Jack Guber and Myles B. \"Skip\" Zeleny. The company secured $10 million in business in its first three months. By July 1977, the firm had grown to three offices, including one in Beverly Hills. The partners sold the firm, whose 1977 sales totaled more than $24 million, to competitor Fred Sands in 1979.

It is composed of Pocho Prieto (vocals and guitars), Cucho Galarza (bass), Chachi Galarza (guitar), the historical members, also Fred Aching (drums) and Juan Carlos Fernández (keyboards). History The band was formed in early 1984 in the district of Pueblo Libre, Lima. Founders Arturo \"Pocho\" Prieto and brothers José \"Chachi\" and Lucio \"Cucho\" Galarza named the group Royal International Orchest. In this early stage, the group covered English songs. In 1984, they began to write their own songs in Spanish and released Son Colegialas through the record label El Virrey. Their first release was not very successful due to problems with the publishing house. Nevertheless, they opened doors in the Cono Norte, where they began to give concerts. The following year, the group released \"Televidente\", recorded at Elías Ponce's studio, not at \"El Virrey,\" and added Coco Tafur on keyboards. With this song, Rio's popularity grew to the point that they were hired for various gigs in Lima and even in the provinces. After many tours, they released their third single, \"La Universidad (cosa de locos).\" The promotion of the band was greatly helped by the edition of videos that circulated in some musical programs at that time. In 1986, the group released their first album titled Lo peor de todo, presented at concerts in countries like Chile (including the show Sábado Gigante), Mexico, and Bolivia. In 1988, they released their second album Dónde vamos a parar (1988), with songs like \"Todo Estaba Bien,\" \"Lo Empiezo a Odiar,\" and \"Contéstame.\" This LP took Rio on tour across many countries in Latin America. Their third production, Revolución, recorded and mixed in Santiago, Chile in November and December 1989 and released in January 1990 only in cassette format, did not achieve the success of its predecessors and went almost unnoticed. This album included songs like \"Pierdo la Razón\" and \"Mónica.\" A couple of years later, in 1992, Rio released their fourth album: Strip Tease, released in Chile and Bolivia. This album included songs like \"Al Norte de América\" or \"Tienes que Pagarme Más,\" along with \"Dulce y amargo\" and \"Tarará,\" which were promoted during the first half of 1989 but were not included in their previous album. Two years later, they released their fifth album: Rock and Qué?, featuring songs like \"Carol Quiere un Viaje a Londres\" or \"No Me cabe Duda.\" Rio's subsequent albums were Relax (1996), Día de pesca (1997), and La cría in 1999. After this album, Rio took a break before releasing what would be their ninth album, Boomerang (2003), featuring songs like \"Bella Luna,\" \"Traicionera,\" and \"Moriría por Ti.\". Rio Today In 2004, they performed for the Peruvian community in Spain, in 2006 in New Jersey, and in 2007 in Los Angeles. Since then, they have continuously toured the United States and Europe. In 2005, the group recorded the version \"Por tu amor\" by vernacular singer Sonia Morales, who also performed. That year, their album 20 años was released, featuring the band's successes from 1986 to 2006.

Background Brian Auger and Julie Driscoll recorded and performed together from 1965 to 1970, first in the band Steampacket alongside Rod Stewart and Long John Baldry, and then as Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and The Trinity. Driscoll recorded her first solo album in 1971, titled 1969; one of the musicians was pianist Keith Tippett, whom Driscoll married, taking a version of his name. Tippetts and Auger went their separate ways for most of the next decade, but reunited for Encore. They recorded the album in late 1977, and it was released in 1978. Cherry Red Records reissued the album in May 2023, with a new essay by Sid Smith. Track listing Side One \"Spirit\" (Al Jarreau) – 4:06 \"Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood\" (Bennie Benjamin, Horace Ott, Sol Marcus) - 3:32 \"Git Up\" (Brian Auger) – 3:46 \"Freedom Highway\" (Pops Staples) - 2:49 \"Future Pilot\" (Brian Auger) – 4:21 Side Two \"Rope Ladder to the Moon\" (Jack Bruce, Pete Brown) - 3:01 \"No Time to Live\" (Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood) – 6:14 \"Nothing Will Be As It Was\" (Milton Nascimento, Ronaldo Bastos, R. Vince) - 3:44 \"Lock All the Gates\" (Al Jarreau) – 5:03 Reception The album received little notice upon its release in 1978; Auger later joked that Warner Bros. “pressed 30,000 copies and forgot about it.”. However, it has come to be regarded as a minor classic, especially since its reissue in 2023. Writing in AllMusic, Thom Jurek wrote, “Listening to Encore in the 21st century is nearly a revelation. Auger, for his part as the band's musical director on his trademark B-3, acoustic piano, and a slew of electronic keyboards, is a strictly no-BS performer. He's as straight-ahead as they get, and Julie Tippetts understands that the root of the song is in its intention. Together, they make a nearly flawless pair on these nine cuts.” Reviewing the reissue, Jon Newey in Jazzwise wrote, “It may be over four decades old but in spirit, message and sheer uplifting musicality it’s uncannily on-point today.” Dave Thompson in Goldmine agreed, specifying that “Jack Bruce’s 'Rope Ladder to the Moon' reminds us that Cream was always the dullest thing its composer ever did; and the Winwood/Capaldi composed 'No Time To Live' recaptures everything you loved about Driscoll’s voice in the first place, but with the benefit of 10 more years in which to improve.” Personnel Brian Auger – producer, arranger, organ, electric piano, acoustic bass, piano [acoustic], synthesizer, tambourine, cowbell, percussion, vocals on track B3 Julie Driscoll – vocals George Doering – guitar David McDaniels – bass Dave Crigger – drums Jessica Smith – backing vocals Julia Waters Tillman – backing vocals Maxine Waters Willard – backing vocals Technical Joe Tuzen – engineer Seth Dworkin – engineer Bruce Steinberg – album design and photography References Category:1978 albums Category:Jazz fusion albums Category:Progressive rock Category:Warner Records albums\n\n77,533,339\n\nLong Branch Baldy\n\nLong Branch Baldy is a mountain in the Cochetopa Hills of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The mountain is located in Saguache County, Colorado and on the Continental Divide, which here forms the border between Gunnison National Forest and Rio Grande National Forest. Geology Long Branch Baldy is located within the San Juan volcanic field and the region is dominated by Tertiary volcanic rocks, including lavas, ash flow tuffs, and breccias. The mountain itself is composed of andesite of the Conejos Formation, deposited by andesitic stratovolcanoes 33 to 29 million years ago. Small scabs of dacite from the Bonanza eruptions (33 million years ago) are present near the summit and on the northern slope of the mountain. Long Branch Baldy was glaciated, and glacial cirques are located on the northeast and east sides of the mountain where tarns and glacial deposits are found. Climate Long Branch Baldy's climate is classified as a subarctic climate (Dfc) in the Köppen system, with cold, snowy winters and cool summers. It receives precipitation as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer, with June typically being a drier month. Hiking Hiking to the summit of Long Branch Baldy is typically done during the summer and early fall when snow is free of the roads used to reach the trailheads. A common route to the summit starts at the Long Branch Trailhead located at the end of Forest Road 780, south of the town of Sargents. A hike along the Baldy Lake Trail (Forest Trail 491) leads to the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). From there, a short hike west along the CDT to the mountain's south ridge allows for an off-trail, class 2 ridge hike leading north to the summit. This route (one-way) has an elevation gain of .Forest road and trail information is available at Colorado Trail Explorer. A distance tool also allows measuring distance and elevation gain of off-trail routes. Accessed 4 August 2024 Long Branch Baldy can also be reached from four-wheel-drive roads and trails to the west, south, and east. The shortest of these hikes begins at the Razor Creek Trailhead. From here the CDT can be followed northeast to the southwest ridge of the mountain, which can then be hiked to the summit. This route (one-way) has an elevation gain of .

Coenen has competed in the Motocross World Championship since 2022 in the MX2 class. He currently competes for the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team. Coenen took his first overall Grand Prix win during the 2024 FIM Motocross World Championship by winning the MX2 class at the Latvian round. Coenen is the twin brother of Lucas Coenen, who is also a World Championship-level motocross racer. Career Junior Career Alongside his brother, Coenen debuted in the European Motocross Championship in 2016, in the 65cc class. Returning the following year, he was able to finish tenth overall in the same class. In his first season in the 85cc class in 2018, Coenen competed on a small wheel machine for most of the year due to his size. The Coenen brothers competed around Europe in 2019, joining the Grizzly Racing Yamaha team for their second season in the 85cc class. This resulted in him winning the 85cc class at the Coupe de l'Avenir event and scoring points in both the European Motocross Championship and the FIM Motocross Junior World Championship. 2020 was Coenen's final year racing an 85, this time on a KTM. This saw him win the Espoirs 85cc class as part of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning all but one race on the way to this title. Following his success on an 85, Coenen moved up to compete full-time in the EMX125 class of the 2021 European Motocross Championship for the Bud Racing team. At the first round of the season, Coenen immediately showed his potential, qualifying second and finishing third in the opening race. By the third round in Germany, he was able to take his first European Championship-level race win. A hand injury stopped him racing in the final four rounds of the season and he eventually finished fifteenth in the final standings. In addition, Coenen finished runner-up behind his brother in the Junior 125cc of the French Elite Motocross Championship, winning three races and two overall rounds. 250 Career Continuing his rapid rise through the ranks Coenen, alongside his brother, moved to the Jumbo Husqvarna BT Racing Team for the EMX250 class of the 2022 European Motocross Championship. The young Belgian rider showed race winning speed throughout the season, but crashes cost him notable results - such as in the second race at the German round when he was leading. This combined with two rounds missed due to injury saw him finish nineteenth in the standings. Alongside this he also made his FIM World Motocross Championship debut in the MX2 class at the Czech round. After this single season in EMX250, Coenen was signed by the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team to compete in the MX2 class of the 2023 FIM Motocross World Championship. At a pre-season race he picked up a dislocated shoulder which saw miss the first four rounds of the championship. Upon his return, Coenen quickly proved his competitiveness with several top-ten finishes throughout the rest of the season. Sixth overall at the Swedish round was his highest result on the way to fourteenth in the final standings. The 2024 season saw Coenen continue his rapid adaption to the MX2 class, as he scored regular holeshots to lead races and contend for finishing positions in the top-six places. This went alongside multiple crashes which saw him miss some notable results, such as at the sixth round in Galicia where he crashed on the last lap of the qualifying race whilst leading. By the ninth round in Latvia, he was able to transform his speed into taking his first race win and with it his first overall grand prix victory. A week later, Coenen was able to win his second grand prix overall at the Maggiora track in Italy.

The large majority of species have been described from Africa and the Near East. However, a few species, including the type species, are found in southern and eastern parts of Asia. In Africa, the distribution range of Diostrombus species extends from the humid tropics of western Africa to many parts of eastern Africa, as far north as parts of Sudan and as far south as South Africa. Three species have been described from Yemen and the Iran. Like other species of the tribe Zoraidini, species of Diostrombus have long and narrow forewings and short hind wings. The main characteristic of Diostrombus is the forewing venation with the media vein having 6 branches which do not split further into sub branches. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a pointed tip. In profile the head is usually flat, but in some African species, the ridges on the sides of the face are extended in front of the antennae. The face is narrow. The antennae are short compared to other genera of the tribe Zoraidini, about half as long as the face. Type species: Diostrombus politus Uhler, 1896 Distribution thumb|Distribution ranges of the species in the genus Diostrombus (blue outline) and that of Diostrombus politus, the type species (brown outline) More than 80% of the species described in the genus Diostrombus are found in Africa, and the majority of these have been reported from the humid tropics of western Africa, from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the North to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the South. In eastern Africa the distribution of Diostrombus species ranges from parts of Sudan and Ethiopia in the North to parts of South Africa in the South. One species has been also described from Yemen (Diostrombus nike) and two from Iran (D. adila and D. jezeki). Further east in Asia, three more Diostrombus species are found, Diostrombus carnosa, D. pennatus and the type species, D. politus. The distribution of these eastern species ranges from eastern parts of India in the West, over Myanmar, parts of China, Taiwan, South Korea to southern parts of Japan in the East. It also includes parts of Indonesia in the South. Description thumb|left|Diostrombus politus - Left: head in frontal and side view - Right: shape and venation of forewing (top) and hind wing (bottom), with the media and the first media branch marked. The hind wing has a pointed tip. thumb|left|Left: Profile of Diostrombus atricollis - Right: Forewing and hind wing of Diostrombus hopkinsi Species of Diostrombus can be recognized by the venation of the forewings and the pointed tips of the hind wings. The media of the forewing has six branches, with none of them branching further into sub branches. The radius has 2 short sub branches near its tip and compared to other Zoraidini, there are 2 long and rather broad cells between the radius and the media. The hind wings are much shorter than half the forewing length and have a distinctive shape with a pointed tip near the frontal (costal) margin. The face (frons) of Diostrombus species is narrow with the ridges on its sides running approximately parallel to each other. In side view, the head typically has a flat profile. However, in some African species like in Diostrombus atricollis, the ridges on the side of the face are extended in front of the antennae. Compared to other genera of Zoraidini, the antennae are short and cylindrical, only about half as long as the face. The terminal arista (bristle) is inserted below the tip of the antennae. thumb|Diostrombus politus from Japan Many Diostrombus species are coloured orange, red or yellow like the type species which is almost completely orange-red (see the illustration on the right). Other species are only partly orange or yellow and often also have parts which are black or dark brown. A few species are predominantly black. The forewings usually have a length of 7 to 9 mm and the length of the body, from head to the tip of the abdomen, is around 4 or 5 mm. Like in other planthoppers of the tribe Zoraidini, the wings are raised and spread out when the insects are at rest. Biology There is no information on the biology of the nymphal stages of Diostrombus species. However, it can be assumed that they live in decaying organic matter like other derbids, feeding on fungi. The adults prefer to feed on monocots like palm trees, maize or rice, like other members of the tribe Zoraidini. Some Asian species can be common enough to be listed occasionally as minor pests. Diostrombus species may be also vectors of plant diseases. In Mozambique, Diostrombus mkurangai was found to be one of the most common sap-sucking insects on coconut palms affected by the lethal yellowing disease and the causal phytoplasma agent was present in this species. In Ghana, a similar disease called Cape Saint Paul Wilt also affects coconut palms and Diostrombus species were again common on diseased palms. In a transmission trial, 4 Diostrombus species were collected from diseased palms and placed in cages together with healthy palms. One of two coconut palms exposed to 4,380 insects from the genus Diostrombus tested positive for the disease with PCR, but failed to develop symptoms. Taxonomy and species thumb|left|Illustration by W.L. Distant in 1906 of Drona carnosa, now known as Diostrombus carnosa Two other genera have been described which are now regarded as synonyms of Diostrombus. These are Drona Distant, 1906 with the type species Drona carnosa Distant, 1906 (see illustration on the left) from Myanmar and Camma Distant, 1907 with the type species Camma dilatata (Westwood, 1851) from Sierra Leone. As of 2024, a total of 43 species have been described in the genus Diostrombus. The following species have been cited most frequently in the scientific literature (as per Google Scholar): Diostrombus abdominalis (Distant, 1907) Diostrombus carnosa (Westwood, 1851) Diostrombus dilatatus (Westwood, 1851) Diostrombus gangumis Van Stalle, 1984 Diostrombus gowdeyi Distant, 1914 Diostrombus luteus (Muir, 1926) Diostrombus mkurangai Wilson, 1987 Diostrombus nitidus Muir, 1926 Diostrombus politus Uhler, 1896 Diostrombus rufus Muir, 1928 References External links Category:Taxa described in 1896 Category:Auchenorrhyncha genera Category:Zoraidini Category:Hemiptera of Africa Category:Hemiptera of Asia\n\n77,533,101\n\nPalazzo del Capitano del Popolo, Orvieto\n\nthumb|View of Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo The Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, also known as the Palazzo del Podesta is a late-Romanesque-Gothic architecture, late 13th-century civic palace located in Piazza del Popolo, in the historic center of Orvieto, region of Umbria, Italy. The palace now houses some municipal offices and the main hall is used for cultural events and meetings. History and description This was erected as a single story loggia in 1156 by pope Adrian IV as a papal palace (Palazzo Apostolico) adjacent to the church of San Bernardo. However, it suffered grave damage during the wars of the following century, and was restored by pope Alexander IV in 1255. Thereafter it served as the residence of the Podestà, and later the Captain of the People, both representing the supreme local magistrate representing the pope. The structure was enlarged within ten years of its original construction and, in 1315, the bell tower was added and in the subsequent year, a great bell was hung there. The upper part of the structure was covered in 1472 and the large hall divided into two rooms, one large and the other small. The larger of the two occupied an area that corresponds approximately to the room known today as the Sala dei Quattrocento. Subsequently, the building functioned as a residence for the Capitano del Popolo, the Podestà and the Signori Sette. The reconstruction, using local pink tufa stone, created a rectangular hall as a piano nobile, standing upon five solid arcades. The second floor has six arches facing the Piazza del Popolo, four of which now have mullioned windows. The arches are flanked by a brick fretwork consisting of protuding bricks or voids, and surmounted with circular floral or geometric (plate tracery) in the tympanum. The arches are also flanked by The second floor was accessed by a wide staircase, leading to a tribune or terrace from where the magistrate could speak to those assembled below. At one time the stairs and tribune were roofed.Guida Storico-artistica della citta di Orvieto, by Tomasso Piccolomini Adami, Tipografia Bernadini, Siena (1883); pages 211-213. The stairs alter the palace from a fortress-like exterior to this open access that symbolize the citizen's new ease of entry to the Council Hall itself.Art and Architecture in Italy 1250-1400 by John White, Yale University Press, 1993, page 60. From 1596 one of the lower-section rooms housed the Studium, which had been re-instituted a few years earlier by Lorenzo Magalotti. Students of law, theology and logic came here to study twice a day, each time the bell of Palazzo del Popolo rang, until 1651. Few records of this university appear after this date. Some sources indicate that it dates back to 1013 and had connections with names such as the Benedictine monks Graziano and Gozio of Orvieto. In the 16th century, a scholarly society in Orvieto, known as the Accademia de Nobili, or of the Phoenix or of the Confusi; was allowed to build a small theater, designed by Sforzino da Todi and decorated by Ricciolini, in the palazzo. It was inaugurated during the visit of Queen Christina, Queen of Sweden.Adami, page 214. In the ground floor of the Palazzo, facing the Piazza del Popolo, was once found the offices of the Monte di Pieta, a pawn shop lending money mainly to the poor. It was established in 1463 under bishop Marinonim and the Franciscan friar Fra Bartolomeo da Colle, and with the support of Pope Pius II. A plaque with antisemitic overtones at the site read: To relieve the poverty of the poor and to depress the usury of the Jews, This Monte di Pieta was permitted by Pius II and erected and endowed by Orvietan piety.UT PAUPERUM INOPIAM SUBLEVARET ET IUDEORUM USURARIAM PRAVITATEM DEPRIMERET MONTEM HUNC PIETATIS PIO II. P. M. PERMITTENTE URBEVETANA PIETAS EREXIT DOTAVITQUE. From Adami, pages 214-215.
