        "text": "DEAR STACY: Is Krysten Ritter of \"Don't Trust the B---- In Apartment 23\" any relation to Jason and the late John Ritter? She's really something. — Angel S., Pomona, Calif.\n\nDEAR ANGEL: No, the Ritter entertainment dynasty that also includes Jason's late grandfather, country star Tex Ritter, is not the same Ritter line as that of funny lady Krysten. She hails from Bloomsburg, Pa., and grew up on her family's cattle farm.\n\nDEAR STACY: I heard that the late Davy Jones was invited to do \"Dancing With the Stars\" a while ago and turned it down. As a \"Dancing With the Stars\" and Davy/Monkees fan, I'd like to know if that's true. Was he afraid for health reasons? — Carla H., Warren, Ohio\n\nDEAR CARLA: No. Jones turned down the dance competition show because, he told me last year, he felt that the level of stars had diminished and he wasn't interested in being on the show \"with boxers and all kinds of people doing it.\" He continued, \"I don't want to be cynical about it, but if they had asked me three years earlier, I might have felt differently.\" The 66-year-old had been leading an extremely active lifestyle — performing, riding his horses, traveling, driving on the cross-country car trips he loved — before the massive heart attack that killed him in February.\n\nDEAR STACY: Can you tell me what Don Johnson is up to? Also, I am wondering if he is presently married, and how many children does he have? — A.A., New Port Richey, Fla.\n\nDEAR A.A.: Johnson is in the cast of Quentin Tarantino's currently filming \"Django Unchained!\" The story of a slave-turned-bounty-hunter stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz, Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony LaPaglia, along with Johnson. It's due for release on Christmas Day. The one-time \"Miami Vice\" star also played the father of lead character Kenny Powers (Danny McBride) — the pro baseball player-turned-middle school P.E. teacher — on HBO's recently concluded \"Eastbound & Down.\" And he's been heard in the animated \"Glenn Martin DDS,\" supplying the voice of Grandpa Whitey. Johnson is the father of a 12-year-old daughter and 9- and 6-year-old sons with his fourth wife, San Francisco socialite Kelley Phleger, to whom he has been wed since 1999. He also has son Jesse, 29, with Patti D'Arbanville, and daughter Dakota, 22, with Melanie Griffith.\n\nDEAR STACY: What happened to Richard Karn, former host of \"Family Feud\"? — Grace C., Spokane, Wash.\n\nDEAR GRACE: Karn has been hosting the Game Show Network's \"Bingo America\" since 2008. The former \"Home Improvement\" co-star has also taken on several acting roles. He was in the 2006 independent feature drama \"Mr. Blue Sky\" and the 2008 \"Snow Buddies,\" and he guested on \"True Jackson, VP.\"\n\nTo find out more about Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith and read their past columns, visit the Creators Syndicate Web page at www.creators.com."
