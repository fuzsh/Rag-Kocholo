        "text": "Two generations of mothers face the consequences of drug addiction in a typically classy “Hallmark Hall of Fame” production timed just right for Mothers Day — though, as it happens, neither mother in question would necessarily honor the other, even with a greeting card.\n\nJoanne Woodward stars as congresswoman Nell Harrington, whose family is decimated by an automobile crash that kills son-in-law Charlie (Reed Diamond) and injures her pregnant daughter, Phoebe (Laura Linney).\n\nHarrington is shocked to learn that Charlie, who was also her longtime aide, was addicted to cocaine. After the baby’s premature birth, it becomes apparent that Phoebe also has been taking drugs for some time.\n\nWhat’s a mother to do? Nell, who had held a press conference announcing Charlie’s drug problem immediately after the accident, at first rails against her daughter, then checks her into a rehab facility.\n\nNell, it becomes clear, is a rather overbearing parent, though whether it’s out of love for her family or a result of her consuming political drive is kept interestingly enigmatic.\n\nAfter being established early on as an educator who hunts with falcons as a hobby, Nell’s husband, Simon (Fritz Weaver), alternates between acting as a sounding board for Nell and avoiding confrontation entirely.\n\nAssignment of blame lingers as a subtext (“…If we hadn’t sent her to that boarding school,” fumes Simon at one point, though Phoebe’s earlier career as a jazz singer comes through unscathed), with acceptance of personal responsibility for one’s actions emerging triumphant.\n\nThere’s a happy ending — maybe they’ll exchange those Hallmark cards, after all — but bulk of film is devoted to Nell’s learning about addiction and its effect on babies, and to the slowly evolving relationship between mother and daughter.\n\nThesping is fine throughout, with Linney an actress whose future work bears watching. One of the stronger scenes under Michael Toshiyuki Uno’s assured direction is a brief, near-silent confrontation between Phoebe and the rehab clinic’s steely administrator (Cynthia Martells).\n\nPatrick Williams’ music is characteristically atmospheric, bringing in the traditional “Froggy Went a-Courtin’ ” as a leitmotif and introducing a couple of songs with lyrics by Arthur Hamilton."
