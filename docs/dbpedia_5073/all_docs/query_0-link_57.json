Joseph P. Addabbo, (D-N.Y.), to\n\ncut $988 million for the first five of an\n\neventual 10 of the nation's first new\n\nstrategic missiles in two decades. The\n\ncommittee went on to approve an\n\noverall defense spending bill of $231.6\n\nbillion.\n\nIN BRAZIL, President Reagan called\n\nit \"a vote for a stronger, more secure\n\nAmerica.\" But he said: \"We're not\n\njumping up and down and claiming a\n\nvictory, because we know it's going to\n\nbe a very tough battle on the floor\" of\n\nthe House, possibly next week.\n\nReagan personally led an intensive\n\nlobbying campaign by the ad-\n\nministration this week to turn aside the\n\nchallenge to the MX, making telephone\n\ncalls to members who were believed\n\nundecided.\n\nThe committee did approve an ams\n\nendment by Rep. Ralph Regula, 4R-\n\nOhio), that would forbid the Air Force\n\nto spend any of the production funds or\n\n$60 million of the research money until\n\nMarch 15.\n\nIN AN impassioned tone, Addabbo\n\nsaid serious questions remained about\n\nthe workability of Reagan's plan- to\n\ndeploy the missiles in a \"dense pack\"\n\narrangement of closely spaced un-\n\nderground silos near Cheyenne, Wyo.\n\n\"This was a full-blown effort by the\n\nWhite House and the Pentagon,\" Ad-\n\ndabbo said. \"If they could go through\n\nthe budget like they, went through\n\nCongress, we'd have a good defense\n\nbill.''\n\nThe bill's $231.6 billion total is $26.4\n\nbillion larger than the amount con;\n\ntained in the defense appropriation\n\nmeasure Congress enacted last year.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Commit,\n\ntee's version of the spending bill, which\n\nalso is awaiting floor action, totals abou\n\n$233 billion.\n\nYour first Strah Light o tngt\n\nof henihtA\n\n~a\n\nEPA ch\"ef cited for\n\ncontempt of Congress.\n\n\"ou a} :rosy cn 'd;ng\n\nWan! m P {;C:}'f U. 3t 1 t;v\n\n\"Loos like a\n\nStroh ight night\"\n\n'3\n\niD\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A House sub-\n\ncommittee voted yesterday to cite Anne\n\nGorsuch, head of the Environmental\n\nProtection Agency, for contempt of\n\nCongress for withholding documents on\n\nPresident Reagan's orders.\n\nThe 9-2 vote by the House Public\n\nWorks investigations subcommittee\n\ncame after Gorsuch invoked executive\n\nprivilege in withholding the documents\n\ndealing with EPA's toxic waste cleanup\n\nprogram.\n\nTHE SUBcommittee had subpoenaed\n\nan estimated 787,000 items to examine\n\nhow EPA manages the $1.6 billion\n\n\"superfund\" program to clean up\n\nabandoned chemical dump sites.\n\nGorsuch, appearing before the panel\n\nin response to the subpoena, said the\n\n\"vast majority\" of documents would be\n\nduplicated and shipped to the subcom-\n\nmittee, though it will cost EPA at least\n\n$145,000 and could take six months.\n\nBut she said that \"sensitive\n\ndocuments found in open law enfor-\n\nSHE SUBMITTED a letter signed-by\n\nReagan in which the president saisiH\n\n\"Because dissemination of sucli\n\ndocuments outside the executive bran;\n\nch would impair my solumn responi\n\nsibility to enforce the law, I instruct ybq\n\nand your agency not to furnish copieesof\n\nthis category of documents.\"\n\nShe said EPA has identified 3\n\ndocuments fitting that description s\n\nfar, and more are certain to surface a\n\nfiles are examined.\n\nthe subcommittee, however, said Jt\n\ncould not permit the administration to\n\nmake a unilateral decision of what wa\n\nappropriate for Congress to review.\n\nRobert Prolman, a member of sUb-\n\ncommittee staff, testified that this\n\ndocuments being withheld were \"th*\n\nmost critical\" in the panel's -in-\n\nvestigation.\n\ncement files\" - such as legal strategiqs\n\nand case analyses - would be withheld\n\non the president's orders.\n\nS(1 THE LAST WORD\n\n®D LIBERTY TEMPLE\n\n043 lQ LAUREL AND HARDY\n\nQ ® COLLEGE FOOTBALL \"Mirage\n\nBowl\" Clemson Tigers vs. Wake Forest\n\nDemon Deacons (from Tokyo, Japan)\n\n12:300 l ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT\n\n® TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nmBFAITH FOR MIRACLES\n\n130DSATURDAY NIGHT\n\n® MOVIE * * \"The Wonderful Crook\"\n\n(1976) Gerard Depardieu, Dominique\n\nLabourier.
