        "text": "PICTURED: Barbra Streisand and her agent/friend Sue Mengers.\n\nStreisand briefly considered directing The Main Event, but instead she hired Howard Zieff, a director of offbeat comedies. “She was particularly impressed by House Calls, which was a battle-of-the-sexes comedy,” Zieff said about his 1978 film starring Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson.\n\nZieff knew the backstage story of A Star is Born – how Streisand and her director Frank Pierson had clashed. Zieff even talked to Pierson before taking The Main Event and seemed clear that his role as director would be a collaborative one with Streisand. “I knew going in that this would not be a ‘director’s picture’ – but a Barbra Streisand vehicle,” Zieff explained. “She’s too big a star for it to be otherwise. When an audience goes to see a Barbra Streisand movie, they go to see Barbra Streisand. No matter what critics say about her, her fans will come. Nothing will affect their attitude toward her.”\n\nZieff also took the job for practical career reasons. After the picture was made, he said, “The fact that I’ve done it has already helped me as far as studios’ response to things I want to do. It gets around. ‘Hey, he can handle movie stars and still bring movies in on time and around budget.’”\n\nAssistant director Pat Kehoe confirmed, “Howard knew it was a hybridized kind of direction – that Barbra’s opinion counted for a great deal and one couldn’t dismiss it.”\n\n“Howard Zieff was directing it,” Andrew Smith added, “but Barbra was really directing it and she got mad at herself for not assuming the job of official director by the time the film was over because she made so many decisions about the shooting of it.”\n\nThe May 26, 1977 “Revised Second Draft” by Parent and Smith needed some work in order to tailor it for Streisand and O’Neal.\n\nAt this point, the story was about “Hillary Hartug,” the owner of a dress business, who discovers her business manager skipped town with all her money, leaving her with only two assets: a boxer and a small nursing home for senior citizens. “Kid Natural” was named “John Lewicki” and described as “a wonderful specimen of a man (Paul Newman, Robert Blake, Peter Falk, Steve McQueen)” who was forty-eight years old. There are many jokes about his age in this script, including a whole subplot where Hillary and ex-husband David (a dermatologist) drive around the elderly patients from Hillary’s nursing home. For the last fight, Kid Natural even wears a custom bathrobe that reads “Kid Elderly.” The Kid’s mom has a small role in the screenplay. David and Hillary have a more intimate relationship: they’re still divorced but sleep together and consider re-marrying each other later in the script. The characters of Percy and Donna are basically the same. For the finale, the Kid grabs the boxing ring microphone and admits his love for Hillary, who hides in the back of the auditorium. The film ends with Hillary running to catch the Kid’s plane, only to have the door shut on her. “I never had the chance to tell him I love him.” But the Kid is there waiting for her. “If I was ten years younger I coulda make that plane,” he says. “I got no problems with old people,” she replies. FADE OUT.\n\nWhen Parent and Smith were re-hired for the movie, they did a quick rewrite before filming began. They injected the script with some of Streisand’s male/female ideas, and tailored it for her – for example, Hillary’s perfume company was called “Le Nez” (“the nose”). Director Howard Zieff also brought 24-year-old Jonathan Kaufer aboard to do rewrites. “Howard and I started out with boyish enthusiasm. We thought we could rewrite the script from the bottom up,” Kaufer said. “But little by little our enthusiasm got chipped away. Only one line from my version remains and is delivered in context, so I can’t really take credit for anything in the film.”\n\nThe script drew its conflict from the battle of the sexes. Gail Parent explained that “in order to have a good male-female comedy, they have to be equal.”\n\nStreisand elaborated, “What is exciting is not for one person to be stronger than the other, not for the man to be stronger than the woman, and not for the woman to be stronger than the man, but for two people to have met their match. And yet, they are equally as stubborn, as obstinate, as passionate, as crazy as the other.”\n\nThe only problem was that the screenplay was not ready when the filming began. “We used to have lunches and work on the script,” Barbra confessed.\n\n“We would literally be writing up until midnight the night before we were going to shoot the scene,” Smith stated, “and we'd show up on the set with new pages and then they'd shoot it.”\n\nFor example, when the crew arrived at Big Bear Lake for the training scenes, the writers retooled the dialogue to accommodate the unseasonal snow. In the script, Hillary says she can “smell snow,” which wouldn’t have made sense because the location already had snow on the ground.\n\nEven the shooting script contained a different ending for the picture. “We didn’t have a good ending to it,” Streisand stated. “So I always encouraged everybody working on the set to be free to have ideas and come to me with them.”\n\nPICTURED: Andrew Smith and Gail Parent, the screenwriters.\n\nThere’s a short scene during the Kid’s training sequence where Streisand wraps his hands before a fight (and accidently wraps one of her hands, too). O’Neal brought in the boxer Hedgemon Lewis, who he managed for a short time. “Lewis worked with her for hours before we shot the scene,” O’Neal said. “O’Neal knows as much about boxing as almost anybody in the country,” Lewis added. “He reads a lot about it and he’s been involved with fighting since before we met in 1966.”\n\nOther locations utilized by the film crew were a hot dog stand on the corner of La Cienega and Beverly Boulevards (see “Cut Scenes”), and the mountains near Big Bear Lake (for the wintry training scenes).\n\n“The major fight sequences were shot at the legendary Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles,” said Zieff. “It was a very real situation —with cheering and booing fight fans—perfect for the climactic encounters between Streisand and O'Neal, both inside and outside the ring.”\n\nFormer light-heavyweight boxer Joe Torres staged the boxing scenes and wrote the boxing dialogue (he’s listed as a “technical consultant” in the credits).\n\nActor Richard Lawson and CBS football announcer Brent Musburger had fun shooting the sports chat show segment, “How it Happened.”\n\n“I came in, and the scene was supposed to take two hours,” Musburger stated. “It dragged on to eight, partially because Streisand didn’t like the color of the backdrop they were using for the TV show set.”\n\nLawson created a funny accent for his boxer character, Hector Mantilla. “It wasn’t a real accent, because it wasn’t specific. It was sort of a West Indies thing,” he said. Lawson recalled having fun improvising the scene. “The lines were basically there, but the imitation Barbra did of my accent was improvisational. The scene took on a life of its own. It wasn’t rehearsed like that. Some wonderful things come out of improvisation and you just go with it. It was written as a straight interview. The whole aspect of her sleeping and him waking her up, her calling him Brett then Burt … all of that was total improvisation.”\n\nMusburger shared that “the parts of the scene that you don’t see, that you only hear, were filmed.” He’s speaking of the edit that happens as the TV interview is ending and the audience is shown Percy and the Kid watching the interview in the cabin.\n\nStreisand contributed and directed the “morning after” scene in the cabin after she and Ryan O’Neal’s characters make love. They filmed it after the production had closed down.\n\n“The movie was finished,” she told John Michael Howson on The Mike Walsh Show. “The relationship just didn’t solidify, it didn’t culminate in something more tangible than just going to bed with each other the night before … One has to confront the other person sooner or later,” Barbra said. “I thought it’d be a funny chance to say something about men and women and the roles they’re supposed to play, and yet be funny.”\n\nMario Tosi was director of photography on The Main Event and had the job of making Streisand look her best in the film.\n\nAccording to Tosi, Streisand and Zieff “wanted the film to look rather clean and stark. I would have liked it with a little more diffusion so it would look a bit softer. They objected to that because the picture was a comedy.”\n\nDuring early tests and the first week of shooting, Tosi said Streisand “was trying to tell me where to put the lights and suggesting that we do things a certain way.” He explained that Streisand wanted to be photographed like she was by her favorite cameraman, Harry Stradling Sr. on earlier films like Funny Girl and Hello, Dolly! “She wanted these big, enormous, old fashioned scoop lights sitting on top of the lens. So we started with that but slowly I started bringing in my white cards and bouncing the light at an angle. She got used to it and, in fact, enjoyed it.”\n\nTosi went on to tell authors Schaefer and Salvato that he was eventually able to “sneak in a few more elements of cinematography that I felt were necessary such as filters or a certain way of lighting. Gradually I was able to photograph her in different key [lighting]; she later told me she had never been photographed that way before.”\n\n“With a lady especially,” Tosi stated, “you cannot use hard lights. The quality of the bounce light enhances beauty.” Tosi also confessed that he employed diffusion nets on the camera lens when he photographed women. “I started using nets a little bit on Barbra Streisand on The Main Event.”\n\nAn up-tempo disco song was written for The Main Event to play over the movie’s final credits and to help publicize it. Titled “The Main Event / Fight,” the song was written by Paul Jabara and Bruce Roberts, with “Fight” by Jabara and Bob Esty.\n\nJabara was a huge fan of Barbra Streisand and desperately wanted to work with her. “I’ve been in love with her since I was 15,” he told the Los Angeles Times. Since Jabara was signed to First Artists publishing he knew Jon Peters was looking for a theme song. “He and Bruce Roberts went ahead and wrote the song hoping they’d consider it,” Bob Esty said. “He submitted a demo, but it was rejected and just laid around for two months.”\n\n“Barbra hated that song,” said Gary Le Mel, who served as vice president of music operations at First Artists Productions. “So she had David Shire and the Bergmans compose a second.”\n\nBob Esty continued the tale, “but Jon Peters thought it should be an up-tempo tune since the movie’s a comedy. So he talked her into reconsidering because he wanted her to do a contemporary thing, a dance tune.”\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Jabara was nominated for (and won) an Academy Award for his song “Last Dance” from the movie Thank God It's Friday – which may have helped Streisand reconsider him for The Main Event.\n\nJabara remembered going to Streisand’s house to work on the song. “I had not seen the movie. I read part of the script. My image for the title – The Main Event – was that it was the Main Thing – a celebration. I wasn’t thinking of the fighting part. I started with the words Extra! Extra! I heard her voice enunciating those two words, and I felt they would draw immediate attention to her.” Jabara also added the line “I’ve got to thank my lucky stars above,” to the song’s intro, inspired by Barbra in Hello, Dolly! “And then I got stuck and brought in Bruce Roberts,” he said.\n\nColumbia Records released The Main Event soundtrack album to coincide with the movie's release. Soundtrack album producer Gary Le Mel told Orange Coast Magazine why different versions of the disco song were included: “We didn't want to cheat the public. We wanted to give them what they heard on the radio,” he explained. “We had made a 12-inch disco version of the song, but it was only for discos and disco radio. It wasn't available for sale, so we put them both on the album.”\n\nColumbia Records also released a promotional 12-inch single of the 11:42-minute “Main Event/Fight” disco song (#AS 625). Both sides contained the same mix."
