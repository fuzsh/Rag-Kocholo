        "text": "The Not-Quite-As-Bad\n\nIn this second batch of rankings, we see some very watchable episodes that have something amiss–whether lesser guest actors (which tend to mar the later episodes), or an obvious mystery (which is the issue with many of the earlier episodes), we have good episodes that just aren’t great, or superlative. These are not nearly so bad as the 20-30 truly awful ones mentioned in the first installment!\n\nTitle Guest Stars // Entertainment Value // Mystery = Final Score\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3: Unfinished Business (7 + 7 + 6 = 20)\n\nPat Hingle wants to catch a killer, and his reckless pursuit leads to another murder! There’s just not a lot of mystery here (Hayley Mills and Erin Moran never seem plausible as suspects), though Hingle’s tussling with Amos Tupper is fun.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 16: From the Horse’s Mouth (7 + 6 + 7 = 20)\n\nA terrific cast, led by Max Caulfield, Kevin McCarthy, and Nanette Fabray, helps Jessica figure out intrigue on a horse farm. Harry McGraw is along for the ride, which is always a good episode, but this one treads on familiar ground.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 21: The Perfect Foil (8 + 6 + 6 = 20)\n\nJessica’s drunk, irresponsible cousin, Cal, gets accused of murder at a shady club in New Orleans. Barbara Babcock, Robert Forster, David Hedison, and George DiCenzo are along for local color. It’s entertaining, but not as good as it should be, though the ending sequence is a delight.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 3: The Legacy of Borbey House (6 + 7 + 7 = 20)\n\nJessica learns that a good contractor is hard to find, since Richard Gilliland seems to be more concerned with another job than hers. David Birney is in it, and he gets killed early, so he can’t be the killer. It’s a marginally entertaining episode (thanks, Seth, we missed you!), but not all that heard to figure it out.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 1: A Nest of Vipers (7 + 7 + 6 = 20)\n\nJess is doing research at a zoo, and runs into a murder by snake venom, and people like Taylor Nichols, Susan Blakely, John Dye, and Corinne Bohrer (all regular guest stars by this point) acting suspiciously. Perfectly average, perfectly watchable.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 18: No Laughing Murder (9 + 5 + 5 = 19)\n\nThere’s a Martin-and Lewis-style comedy team, estranged for years, brought together because their kids are getting married. Murder ensues. It’s pleasures come entirely from the guest cast: young George Clooney, Pat Crowley, Buddy Hackett, Steve Lawrence, Sheree North, Arte Johnson. The plot is who-cares-ical?, but the cast is game for more.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 19: Thursday’s Child (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nVera Miles tries to convince Jessica that Frank fathered her child during the war. She does this to get Jessica to prove his innocence of a murder involving corrupt building inspection. People really respond to Dame Angie’s emoting in this episode—she gets to run a gamut of feelings in responding to this allegation against Frank—but when you look past that, it’s a basic murder mystery.\n\nSeason 6, Episode 9: Test of Wills (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nThis is one of the higher rated episodes on IMDB, and that baffles me: the central guest performer, Gene Barry as a patriarch testing his greedy family, is playing a loathsome character without any redeeming charms, and while the supporting cast tries, Marj Dusay, Keir Dullea, and Cassie Yates mainly look confused as to who their characters are supposed to be (no one is sympathetic, and Dullea’s character is particularly pointless). The episode also suffers from a terrible ending, in which a character gets away with murder (and since said character is characterized by an awful acting performance, the injustice is all the more insulting to the audience).\n\nSeason 10, Episode 15: Murder on the Thirtieth Floor (6 + 5 + 8 = 19)\n\nThis is a tricky one—a man jumps from a building, though perhaps he was murdered. Jessica gets involved in trying to figure out why, but really, she has no business being involved, and, in a MSW first, her participation is the weak point of the episode—it’s much more interesting watching the shady publishing co-workers squirm around as a conspiracy unfolds, and Jessica seems to only luck into the evidence (including an absurd encounter in a Connecticut house where an otherwise brilliant killer has just absentmindedly left some evidence for her to find).\n\nSeason 7, Episode 13: Moving Violation (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nA nasty brat (played by Dame Angie’s nephew, David) accuses Sheriff Metzger of corruption, before getting killed, bringing Susan Clark, Robert Ginty, Harry Guardino (as Haskell Drake), and Philip Baker Hall to town. Distinguished acting elevates this otherwise ho-hum exercise.\n\nSeason 8, Episode 19: Day of the Dead (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nIt’s a lot of fun watching James Coburn in action in this Mexican-themed outing, in which Jess must solve a murder mixed up with the theft of a rare Aztec artifact. Alas, the acting is really uneven in this one, and you could leave the room for 45 minutes and still come back and immediately guess the killer.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 11: Northern Explosion (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nJessica gets trapped in a Canadian mining town, and gets even more trapped with the tension in the town (it’s a powder keg, except there’s already been an episode called “Powder Keg”). Jerry Hardin, Ana-Alicia, and Graham Greene are the liveliest among the guest stars.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 11: Broadway Malady (8 + 5 + 6 = 19)\n\nThis one’s a bit of a perverse entertainment, since Milton Berle’s cameo reminds you that he was a gifted comic, once, and Lorna Luft, bless her, is not her mother, or her sister, and Vivian Blaine seems to be one sneeze away from being blown away, despite a ludicrous series of wigs and more makeup than an Ann Miller revue trying to make her look vibrant. Oh, Michael Horton as Grady is particularly annoying in this one, and the killer is pretty obvious, again, though Robert Morse is fun as a venal director. A prime example of why earlier episodes tend to be preferable: despite the so-so script, the actors are seasoned professionals.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 10: Murder in White (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nJess must help her friend prove herself innocent of murder while checking out another stage adaptation of one of her works (this time in London). It’s not the most compelling work (Jean Marsh seems stiff, or intimidated, and so her “friendship” with Jessica is not convincing), but there is easy charm in Norman Lloyd, Anne Meara, and Ian Ogilvy’s collective work.\n\nSeason 5, Episode 16: Truck Stop (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nOpenly striving for film noir realness, this black-and-white episode feels like it’s trying too hard, and while Liz Ashley and Mike Connors bring it, the rest of the cast is not up to snuff, and the plot twists are not surprising.\n\nSeason 9, Episode 19: Lone Witness (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris delivers Jessica’s groceries, and gets embroiled in murder, which Jessica attempts to clear up. Yes, there is a neat twist involving the criminal identity, and Beth Howland and Sheila MacRae class up the proceedings, but this is a perfectly average episode (that is inexplicably highly ranked at IMDB, perhaps by Doogie Howser’s admirers?).\n\nSeason 1, Episode 19: Armed Response (8 + 6 + 5 = 19)\n\nNetflix doesn’t seem to have it anymore, and really the only reason to seek it out is to spend quality time with Martha Raye, who is quite lovely and beguiling in this appearance.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 22: Murder, She Spoke (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nAlso not on Netflix right now, G.W. Bailey highlights this one as a sexist pig of a detective investigating a murder at a recording studio. Jessica, there recording an audiobook, must prove blind William Atherton is not the killer, with Constance Towers, Wendy Phillips, and Charlie Daniels among the suspects. This is also a rare one where the killer doesn’t confess (which always thrills me, since killers rarely just blurt it all out, right?).\n\nSeason 6, Episode 14: How to Make a Killing Without Really Trying (6 + 6 + 7 = 19)\n\nJessica’s lousy stockbroker gets killed, and his goofy gal Friday gets accused. Morgan Brittany, Edd “Kooky” Byrnes, David Groh, and Farley Granger give us some possible suspects to enjoy, but this one is very paint-by-numbers.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 8: Crimson Harvest (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nYet another winery episode, this one is notable for Lainie Kazan, Robert Pine, and Elizabeth Gracen, who would later be more famous for her participation in the Clinton rumors of the late 90s. There’s a dumb subplot involving a pissed-off dog that helps Jessica out, but this one is all about watching Angie and Lainie hang out.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7: We’re Off to Kill the Wizard (8 + 7 + 4 = 19)\n\nThere are faces in this one (John Schuck, Christine Belford, James Coco, George DiCenzo, Kim Darby, Richard Sanders) and names (Darby, Joaquin and Summer Phoenix), but no real mystery. Still, it’s a hoot to look at these people.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 6: The Murder Channel (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nThis dumb one, where characters watch a murder on a closed circuit TV that they mistake for ahead-of-its-time reality TV, is enlivened by Jessica Walter (as a bitch, what else?) and Doris Roberts, in yenta mode. Dumb, but watchable.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 19: No Accounting for Murder (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nGrady gets accused of murder, again, and it’s up to Jess to figure out if Bad Seed Patty McCormack, the governor from Benson, Dorothy Lamour, or Sheriff Metzger (Ron Masak here playing as a shady investor) did it. The most fun of this episode is trying to figure out where in the Flatiron District Grady’s business is supposed to be, and the Friends level of insanity that Grady can afford that apartment.\n\nSeason 8, Episode 8: A Killing in Vegas (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nJess visits Vegas and gets drawn into a murder. Howard Keel is a charming presence, but this one is dogged down by two awful performances from the ingénues playing the young, troubled couple Jess is supposed to be helping, and a funny awful one from $25,000 Pyramid stalwart and former model Shelley Smith as a drunk trophy wife.\n\nSeason 6, Episode 10: Class Act (7 + 5 + 7 = 19)\n\nAs a bookend episode goes, you could do worse, but this one drags, hard. Barry Newman is terrific, and he has mad chemistry with Lise Hilboldt, but this felt more like a backdoor pilot than a standalone episode, and so we suffered through unnecessary characters (looking at you, Heather McAdam and Hallie Todd). Bonus points for getting to see Oscar-winning producer Grant Heslov act here.\n\nSeason 6, Episode 18: O’Malley’s Luck (7 + 7 + 5 = 19)\n\nPat Hingle is a terrific character actor, so it’s a pleasure to see him get a lead opportunity. But, again, this feels like a backdoor pilot more than a standalone episode, so there is too much going on, and too many superfluous characters and plots. When Hingle and Stacy Edwards, as his cop daughter, butt heads and compare notes, the show is a delight.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 19: Christopher Bundy – Died on Sunday (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nJessica, thanks to annoying Grady, gets involved with a nasty publisher (Bert Convy), who gets murdered. Carol Lawrence and Alex Rocco are their reliable selves, and Robert Stack is Robert Stackian as the suspect she helps exonerate, but this is only higher-rated because it has the quality guest stars of the early seasons; this script, filmed in season 11, would be a clunker.\n\nSeason 6, Episode 13: If the Shoe Fits (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nYou feel like you’ve seen this one before (Jessica tries to exonerate a single mother accused of murdering her boss), and you have, although it’s Season Hubley instead of Tess Harper this time. Jonathan Brandis and Lorna Luft bring something new and different to the proceedings, but this is derivative of better stuff.\n\nSeason 9, Episode 11: Final Curtain (7 + 6 + 6 = 19)\n\nPeter Donat is a washed-up actor in town to do community theatre. Eve Simpson is, naturally, hot and bothered by this development. There’s a convoluted plot here, but it does give Donat, Bradford Dillman, and Dennis Christopher opportunity to do some work, and it’s nice to be in Cabot Cove.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 4: Death In Hawaii (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nThe camp factor is strong with this one, from Nina Foch as the spry, zesty old lady, to Ken Howard as the patriarch, to Tamlyn Tomita as a detective (despite the fact she can’t seem to find the next line, let alone a clue). There’s a shark attack, for good fun, and despite the fact Jessica never visited them when she came to help Magnum 7 years earlier, she is apparently a trusted member of the tribe in this political family. Camp, indeed, which is fortunate, because it would otherwise be a ludicrous offering.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 14: Deadly Assets (6 + 7 + 6 = 19)\n\nWhy are they named Terhune? When Dee Stone played Mildred Terhune, whose long-lost sister, Irene, comes back, in that Roddy McDowall/Brad Dourif episode, they made a big stink about how Mildred was the only one left to inherit some money. Now, suddenly, there’s a Celia, Harvey, and Libby Terhune, involved in this Cabot Cover that also involves Wayne Rogers’ Charlie Garrett and the mob?!?! It’s a perfectly ho-hum mystery, but this bugged me the entire time—this is a Golden Girls-level continuity error!\n\nSeason 11, Episode 21: Game, Set, Murder (6 + 7 + 6 =19)\n\nCasually ripping off the young pianist episode, mixed in with ripping off the Linda Hamilton tennis tournament episode, this one is about a troubled young tennis player being pressured to play by a domineering father (while having nightmares about her mother’s murder). Happily, Jessica is there (the tournament is sponsored by her publisher), and she’ll figure everything out by the end (clue: there’s only one name guest star, and he’s not the one who gets murdered, so….)\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6: Dead Man’s Gold (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nLeslie Nielsen adds some color to this one (Is he a murderer, Jess? Are you creaming your coffee to kiss your old beau one more time, Jess?), but this clunker is not particularly compelling, despite some eye candy (J. Eddie Peck, Grant Goodeve, no Speedo, alas, and Julia Montgomery) and some painfully bad “drunk” acting by the murder victim that should be more entertaining than it turns out to be.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 3: See You in Court, Baby (7 + 6 + 5 = 18)\n\nA bookend with some charming performances from Vera Miles, Nana Visitor, and Judith Chapman, and a nasty victim in Robert Reed’s bitchy divorce attorney. The plot is kinda irrelevant to Dennis Stanton flirting with everyone.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 8: Magnum on Ice (6 + 7 + 5 = 18)\n\nIt’s entertaining enough—particularly a memorable encounter when Tom Selleck’s Magnum sneaks into Jessica’s hotel suite while she is about to enter a tub—but an episode with Jessica Walter and Dorothy Loudon should be much more compelling than this one (having seen the first part that aired on Magnum P. I., I can attest that it is the better half, since the actors spend time creating motive and suspicion, which is all tossed aside in this half, which largely ties everything up, and explains why everyone is behaving as they are).\n\nSeason 6, Episode 17: Murder: According to Maggie (7 + 6 + 5 = 18)\n\nAnother bookender that people seem to like, and while I enjoy the charming Diana Canova, this one always feels weird and flat to me; we are supposed to see Maggie as a better writer than this standard cop fare, but then we are expected to identify with the performers in said series-within-a-series. Talia Balsam and Leann Hunley are always fabulous, but this one never quite fires on all cylinders.\n\nSeason 9, Episode 10: The Sound of Murder (7 + 5 + 6 = 18)\n\nJessica witnesses another murder while recording an audiobook; this one is notable as she gets a sidekick (Alexia Robinson) for much of the episode, and has some classy acting from Miles O’Keeffe, Richard Beymer, Edd Byrnes, and Mary Beth Evans, but, as is often the case for Season 9, we are happy with average, and grateful for a few good guest stars (let alone Hollywood legends or Cabot Covers we can recognize).\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6: Hit, Run, and Homicide (8 + 5 + 5 = 18)\n\nThis episode helps you see why June Allyson could sell so many Depends over the years—she could not help but be warm and inviting. Van Johnson and Eddie Albert also can’t help but do the same thing. Alas, all this is at the expense of the plot and mystery, which is pretty simple to solve once you realize how many nice people are in the episode (but Patti D’Arbanville does look gorgeous).\n\nSeason 4, Episode 13: Harbinger of Death (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nJessica visits yet another niece—this time, she’s married to a guy Jessica’s age, but cheating on him with Steven Ford, but no, not cheating (!), she’s just confused and he’s going to rape her! Heavens forbid one of Jessica’s relatives be moral suspect… This whole episode battles this kind of paradox, where people are supposedly bad but never actually allowed to show it, and people supposedly have power, but all they do is talk about it. It’s also another episode where Jessica should have ended up dead at the end, as the killer would have had her disposed of before she’d even begun a late-night confrontation. Jeffrey Tambor, Karen Grassle, and Marcia Rodd are among the wasted guest stars.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 12: Proof in the Pudding (6 + 7 + 5 = 18)\n\nGood news? It’s always nice to see pros like Tony Lo Bianco and John Saxon in an episode. Bad news? This clunker has no likability, and a ludicrous ending that expects you to believe the killer is unbelievably stupid. Still, it’s entertaining.\n\nSeason 5, Episode 20: Three Strikes, You’re Out (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nJess goes to visit one of her nephews in Arizona, where he plays baseball, and all kinds of nastiness breaks out, including poor Terri Garber getting murdered for doing her job, Anne Lockhart in wash-and-wear hand-me-downs, and Vince Edwards threatening to flash his wizened, shriveled old peeny at Jess (admittedly, she shows no restraint about barging into locker rooms). Not an inspired effort.\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6: It Runs in the Family (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nThe only episode in the entire series in which Jessica Fletcher does not appear! Her cousin, Emma McGill, must solve the murder of an old flame. Mark Lindsay Chapman, Christopher Hewett, Jane Leeves, and Anthony Newley all try, but this one is fairly paint-by-numbers, with accents.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 7: Fatal Paradise (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nAnother former neighbor to hit it big, Cynthia Harris lives in Martinique with her gambler husband, who loses part of their hotel in a poker game right around the time Jessica arrives, along with Wayne Rogers as Charlie Garrett, and a slew of familiar guest stars, like Christopher Allport, Patricia Barry, Anne Lockhart, and Cassie Yates (those two are not playing sisters this time). Once again, the clues are so ridiculous that it seems implausible that Jessica manages to tie it all together by the end, but she does, and she brings peace and love wherever she goes.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 5: A Virtual Murder (7 + 6 + 5 = 18)\n\nJessica tangles with the early-90s version of “virtual” and it is a hoot. The case is a bit convoluted (there’s bugs, there’s conniving competitor), but watching Jessica try to keep up with the times is more than enough fun, and the guest starring corps (Phil Morris, Allan Miller, Kevin Sorbo, Ramy Zada) is a little more B-list than the sad no-list that these late season episodes seem to feature.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1/2: Death Stalks the Big Top (7 + 6 + 5 = 18)\n\nJessica must figure out how her presumed-dead brother-in-law is a) alive and b) not guilty of murder at the circus he hides out at. Courteney Cox is in it for a moment as the niece, who sends Jessica on her voyage, and the cast is intriguing enough (Ronny Cox, Martin Balsam, Jackie Cooper, Florence Henderson, Laraine Day, Lee Purcell, and Greg Evigan), but this feels overblown (two episodes where one would suffice) and not at all emotionally resonant.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 1: Trials and Tribulations (8 + 5 + 5 = 18)\n\nThis is a pretty crappy episode (Jessica is sued by a sleazy lawyer, George Maharis, for wrongful death, on the flimsiest of grounds, bolstered by some bribery of key witnesses). This is a particularly bad episode. Really bad. It makes no real sense, and there’s no real sense of stakes here (you know Jessica will disprove the charges, and she’s actually pretty arrogant in how she ignores her lawyer’s advice and confronts people ex parte). It is only worth watching if you are fan of Kim Hunter, who is positively transcendent in her key scenes at the episode’s end. Skip to the end, and watch some brilliant acting.\n\nSeason 10, Episode 16: Time to Die (5 + 8 + 5 = 18)\n\nThis episode is wretchedly bad—but it’s campy bad, for those inclined to be entertained by such things (if not, lower this to a 14, as it’s one of the worst episodes in the canon). Robert Beltran is a bad bad man who coerces co-eds and runs over Jessica’s friends, and all kinds of people have motives (the best motive would be to tell them he wrote the episode, as the overripe dialogue is never worse than in this one). Graffiti and racing pigeons complicate the absurd plot, but the weirdest (not quite Jessica doing virtual reality, but up there) moment is Jess bopping along to pop/Latin/girl group fusion music that defies beat or rhythm (that last bit could apply to either the ditties or the bopping). Howlingly bad!\n\nSeason 11, Episode 18: The Dream Team (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nGrady comes to town again, and brings his questionable ability for choosing employers, as these real estate developers are shady (OMG!). Murder ensues, and thankfully Jess takes a break from teaching in NY, visiting three other continents, and befriending talentless twentysomethings who work cheaply as guest stars on long-running mystery shows, to solve the crime.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 16: Sudden Death (7 + 6 + 5 = 18)\n\nJessica suddenly becomes part owner of a football team, and she gets to deal with the artist formerly known as Bruce Jenner, Dick Butkus, and John Beck. It’s a curiosity, but not the most entertaining episode.\n\nSeason 8, Episode 21: Badge of Honor (6 + 6 + 6 = 18)\n\nSeth’s old Army buddy is accused of murder, and Jessica must prove his innocence (because friends of Seth are now included in the Jessica shield of honor). Gail O’Grady and Daniel Davis are largely wasted in this one.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2: Joshua Peabody Died Here…Possibly (5 + 7 + 6 = 18)\n\nThere’s a “Who cares?” quality to this one, where so much depends on off-screen exposition, and where the killer is patently obvious, even if you can’t figure out why until a ton of exposition at the end. Guests Meg Foster, John Astin (in the first of several Season 2 appearances), and Chuck Connors try.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 4: Hannigan’s Wake (7 + 5 + 5 = 17)\n\nAnother highly rated IMDB episode that I am baffled by—Van Johnson dies, but not before asking her to help exonerate Cynthia Harris’ brother for a crime he didn’t commit. Bradford Dillman, as a local cop, and Tony Geary, as the likely killer, give terrific performances, but this is no mystery, since we are never really sure why we should care (particularly after Jessica gets shot at mid-episode, but not by the killer, since the killer is not in the episode, which is more annoying than clever). The ending is terrible, and hard to swallow.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 11: Family Doctor (6 + 5 + 6 = 17)\n\nIt’s nice to see Seth again—even if it’s not in Cabot Cove, and it’s in this unrealistic yarn in which Seth gets kidnapped twice by the mob, once with Jessica, and somehow they both live to tell about it. The killer is even more ludicrous, and is only caught by expository dialogue that could easily be denied in court. Sloppy, stupid, not very entertaining, though Amy Yasbeck and Monte Markham have their smart acting moments.\n\nSeason 8, Episode 9: The Committee (6 + 5 + 6 = 17)\n\nThere are some classy guest stars (Norman Lloyd, John McMartin for the seventieth time, Robin Thomas, Nicholas Pryor), but this one utterly stretches credulity, as a secret society is aghast that one of its members may have killed another, and sets about giving Jess carte blanche to solve the case, all the while ready to discuss said developments with the police and to disband this “committee” that metes out punishment. Riiiiight.\n\nSeason 12, Episode 18: Track of a Soldier (6 + 6 + 5 =17)\n\nJessica goes to the Grand Tetons to recuperate from all of her other travels, and, of course, murder happens, this time involving a young man and his dog, who likes to grab items that will eventually help Jessica solve the murder. With old friends Stephen Macht, Linda Kelsey, Wings Hauser, and Audrey Landers, this should be more compelling than it is.\n\nSeason 11, Episode 5: Dear Deadly (7 + 5 + 5 = 17)\n\nEileen Brennan is an advice columnist who, like Jess, tends to butt in where she ought not. However, she gets murdered for it, leaving Jess to figure it out. It’s not a particularly good episode, though John Rhys-Davies, Daphne Ashbrook, and Rosanna Huffman give it the returning-guest-star-best-effort.\n\nSeason 9, Episode 18: Dead to Rights (6 + 6 + 5 = 17)\n\nYou want to like this one, cast with so many charming character actors (Molly Hagan, Christine Belford, Evelyn Keyes, Wallace Langham, Sam Anderson, Jeffrey Nordling), but the central conceit (that Jessica’s recent researcher, a pathological liar, is worth her investigative prowess because her public defender is in lust with her) is hard to swallow.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 9: Ballad For a Blue Lady (6 + 5 + 6 = 17)\n\nFlorence Henderson is some old friend of Jess (you don’t know from where, since Flo’s accent travels all over the country during this star turn); her cheating husband gets killed, and she almost gets killed, and it’s up to Jess to figure out the who, what, and how, and up to us to check the watch until the ending which, at least, is well-executed.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 13: My Johnny Lies Over the Ocean (7 + 5 + 5 = 17).\n\nBelinda Montgomery is in a different episode, wildly histrionic as the widowed, emotionally fragile niece Jessica is safeguarding. Thankfully, the guest stars are fun (Vicki Lawrence, Lynda Day George, JoAnne Worley, Leslie Nielsen), but again, at the expense of real mystery, since too many of them are too warm to be vicious killers.\n\nSeason 12, Episode 21: Race to Death (6 + 6 + 5 = 17)\n\nAndrea Parker is a fine skipper who is back to Cabot Cove to race her former love, John Getz, who is a bad man, and father to her [gasp] illegitimate child, who is the reason her father, Steve Forrest, has cut her off for years. Jessica is an honorary commodore because why not? Murder happens, and it’s up to Jess to figure out who offed the dude. Parker is stiff, but she’s a forceful actor, and her scenes with Steve Forrest elevate this otherwise dreary episode."
