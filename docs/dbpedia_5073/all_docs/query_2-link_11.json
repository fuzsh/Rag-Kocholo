        "text": "THE cough appears to come up from her very toes, such booming, basso bark from tiny‐ body that it convulses audiences seeing “The Main Event.” The critics called it the funniest thing in the film that stars Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal.\n\nPatti D'Arbanville has been able to produce it since she was eight years old, and because she had a cold and was unable to stifle it when she was being auditioned by Miss Streisand, the movie's co‐producer, she got the.part of Mr. O'Neal's floozy girlfriend. “I let out this enqrmous cough, and she roared and said: ‘That's great coming out of this little body. We've got to use it,’ “ Miss D'Arbanville recalled in telephone interview from California.\n\nThe lynx‐eyed actress has been used to being the focus of attention since she was very small. When she was 3, her grandmother took her to Bloomingdale's, where she won a beautiful‐baby contest. “I went on to being an Ivory Soap baby for television commercials, and for three years, I sat in a bathtub and said either, ‘And it floats,’ or ‘Get some today,’ “ she said.\n\nHer father was a bartender, her mother was an artist, and she grew up a free soul in Greenwich Village. When she was 13, she got a job putting go‐go records on a turntable at the Cafe Figaro and quit school the next year. “I was bright. I was always ahead of the others, but somehow I never thought needed school,” she said.\n\nAmong the artists who frequented the Figaro was Andy Warhol with his bizarre coterie of hangers‐on, and the artist singled her out. “I started hanging out with the Warhol crowd,” Miss D'Arbanville said. “I was very young, it seemed like an awful lot was going one and I was seeing a slice of life hadn't seen before. Warhol wanted to puirne in a film, but my mother wouldn't let me.”\n\nThe next person to discover her was Antonio Lopez, the fashion illustrator, who met her and started drawing her while she was working at Max's Kansas City. “You're a little short, but you have a really pretty face,” he told her. “Why don't you model?”\n\nSo she got some test photographs done by Richard Avedon, Richard Ballerian and Bert Stern and went with them to the Wilhelmina model agency.. Although she was only 5 feet 4 inches tall — “the shortest model who ever was there” — Wilhelmina took Miss D'Arbanville on for beauty assignments.\n\nYears later, Francesco Scavullo, the celebrated photographer who chose her and 58 other dazzlers for his “Scavullo on Beauty” book, described Miss D'Arbanville as “a delectable beauty with a kittenish quality that's pure enchantment —sexy, small and feminine.”\n\nA Smashing Success in Europe\n\nWilhelmina urged the young model to seek other assignments abroad, and so in 1968, at the age of 17, Miss D'Arbanville cast loose from New York and went to Europe, where she posed and was a smashing success in Britain, France, West Germany and Italy, with her slanting green eyes, tip‐tilted nose and honey blond hair. Expecting to be there only a few months, she stayed fdr five years.\n\nWhile living in London, she was approached by Gerard Brach, who said he was looking for a French‐speaking woman to star in “La Maison,” a movie with Michel Simon. Miss D'Arbanville plunged into French lessons for the next two months, six hours a day with private tutor, and got the part. “It didn't do too well at the box office, but it was a critical success, and I was hooked,” she said.\n\nBetween modeling jobs, she appeared in two more films, “La Saignee” (“The Bloodletting”) and Warhol movie. shot in Paris, “L'Amour.” By this time her French was fluent, but “I wasn't getting the parts I wanted and I wanted to stop modeling totally,” she said. “I wanted to come back to the United States to try my luck.” She returned to New York and studied acting for a year with Herbert Berghof. At the end of 1973, she headed for the West Coast.\n\nWhile working at a boutique called Maxfield Blue in Beverly Hills, “1 met a lot of stars,” she said. “I sold Streisand about six cashmere sweaters.” Meantime she was making the rounds of studios, connecting with “Rancho DeLuxe,” a modern western directed by Frank Perry, with Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterston, Elizabeth Ashley and Slim Pickens. She played a tough, beerdrinking barrel racer in a rodeo who was Mr. Bridges's girlfriend.\n\nWhile in Paris on her next film, “The Crazy American Girl,” directed by David Newman, she met and fell in love with a French stage actor, Roger Mirmont. They married in 1975, and, she said: “I started commuting between Paris and Los Angeles. It was not doing my career a lot of good, and it was an instant drain on the marriage. asked him if he would try to live in the United States for about a year, and he didn't think it would work.”\n\nAfter two years, the Mirmonts separated. Miss D'Arbanville now lives alone in an apartment in Venice, Calif., overlooking the ocean; before the boardwalk was closed off, she would roller skate about 12 miles a day down to Santa Monica. “I lift weights. I work out. I try to keep my body together —it's the only one I've got,” she said."
