        "text": "Linda Thompson was born in Memphis, Tennessee. She attended Kingsbury High School where she was Homecoming Queen, and after graduation, she attended Memphis State University for 4 years, majoring in English and Drama. Linda was named Miss Tennessee Universe 1972, Miss Liberty Bowl, Miss Shelby County, and numerous other titles that helped her with financing her college education. Linda met Elvis Presley in July of 1972, and her life changed forever. They lived together at Graceland for 4½ years and after their breakup, Linda embarked on an acting career. She appeared in many of Aaron Spelling's TV series, 5 TV pilots, and other shows, finally becoming a series regular on Hee Haw for 15 years. Having always written poetry, she also became an award winning lyricist, winning an Emmy, and was nominated for an Academy Award and Grammy. Linda married the then Bruce Jenner and they had two sons together. After 32 years of harboring the secret of Caitlyn Jenner, Linda wrote her NYTimes best selling memoir A Little Thing Called Life, only after Caitlyn came out. Her memoir has been critically acclaimed as kind spirited and fascinating. Linda was also married to David Foster, and after 19 years together, they divorced in 2005. Linda still writes, and now lives quietly with her two dogs in Malibu California and enjoys tennis, hiking, the beach, and most of all, her family...\n\nAmanda Peterson was born on July 8, in Greeley, Colorado. With a natural beauty, powerful charm and a strong personality this talented and truly gifted actress began her career in film industry at age 9, with the feature film Annie (1982), directed by Academy Award-winner John Huston. To participate in \"Annie\", she had to persuade her mother and then compete in a casting which included more than 8000 girls. She is the youngest of three children, she has a sister, Ann-Marie Peterson, and a brother, Rev. Jim Peterson. Her mother, Sylvia Peterson, is a full-time mother and housewife and her father, James Peterson, is a doctor. Starting in 1981, Amanda had guest starring roles in television series such as Vater Murphy (1981), Silver Spoons (1982) and Boone (1983). In 1985, she played alongside with Oscar nominee River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke, a four-time Oscar nominee, in Joe Dante fantasy-fable Explorers - Ein phantastisches Abenteuer (1985). At 14 years of age this precocious young actress, had already participated in over 50 television commercials, three television series and four movies. She was also an active member of the Greeley Saddle Club, and horse riding was one of her passions since childhood. She met her greatest international success in 1987 with the comedy movie Can't Buy Me Love (1987), directed by Steve Rash. Amanda received critical praise worldwide and demonstrated that her skills were maturing into older roles. In 1987, in Chile, Amanda acted with her elder sister, Ann-Marie Peterson, Jsu Garcia and Xander Berkeley in the post-apocalyptic movie Tödliche Flucht (1988), directed by Jon Hess and produced by Academy Award-winner Roger Corman. In 1988, for her outstanding acting in the Emmy Award-winning television series Ein Schicksalsjahr (1986), Amanda Peterson won the Young Artist Award in the category of Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Drama Series. These awards are often referred to as the Young Oscars. A year later she acted opposite Roy Scheider, two-time Oscar nominee, in the profound and moving drama Die große Herausforderung (1989), directed by Oscar nominee Douglas Day Stewart. She also drew praise for is her performance in the excellent thriller Tödlicher Charme (1990), directed by Fritz Kiersch. In 1994, after participating in the memorable contemporary drama film WindRunner (1994), she decided to leave the entertainment industry. Amanda's work involves several genres, from western to romance, science fiction to thrillers, and from dramas to comedies.\n\nAmanda found admirers on a global scale, with her delightful work. With her strong presence and dedication, she demonstrated a gift for portraying emotion and vulnerability, while immersing herself in here roles, while bringing here unique personality, an attribute that only the best actors have. In a Perfect World Amanda would have delivered many more quality character interpretations, whether in film or on television. With her movies she achieved immortality in the hearts of all who witnessed her work since her childhood. As Leonard Maltin, the most respected and recognized historian and film critic in America, once said - \"Amanda Peterson is excellent\". There is no doubt about that. After all, Amanda Peterson is one of the most talented and beautiful actress of her time and considered by many a legend. On July 3, 2015, Amanda Peterson died at her home in Greeley, Colorado, at the age 43 from an accidental morphine overdose.\n\nKirk Thomas Cameron was born in Panorama City, California, to Barbara Cameron (née Barbara Jeanne Bausmith), a homemaker, and Robert Cameron, a teacher. Though his parents initially did not project show business aspirations onto their children, a family friend in the business noted to Barbara that both Kirk and his sister, Candace Cameron Bure, were cute enough that they could easily pick up lucrative work in commercials. After Cameron began appearing in TV ads for \"Polaroid\", \"McDonald's\" and \"Count Chocula\" cereal, he found himself wound up in Hollywood's notorious child-star mill, netting minor cute-kid parts in a handful of TV movies, including a couple of Disney projects and two Junge Schicksale (1972) (1972-95). In 1983, he landed a regular gig, as a precocious kid, in ABC's Two Marriages (1983), a show that remained on the air less than a month. He found a more winning formula in 1985 with Unser lautes Heim (1985), playing the oldest son of a family headed by a psychiatrist (Alan Thicke) and a journalist (Joanna Kerns), one in a sequence of family network sitcoms characterized by with-it parents and mischievous-but-squeaky-clean kids. On the show, Cameron played the incorrigible but dumb \"Mike Seaver\" and his winning portrayal won over a large number of teen fans. In spite of scathing critical notices, \"Growing Pains\" ranked among Nielsen's top 20 network shows for its first four seasons, rising to No. 5 in its 1987-88 year. On the heels of his sitcom success, Cameron appeared in his first feature film in 1986, the Robin Williams/Kurt Russell glory-days comedy, Rocket Man - Der Beste aller Zeiten (1986).\n\nABC would pump up Cameron as its \"It\" boy, and his trademark smirk in coming years would grace covers of a raft of teen magazines. Meanwhile, job offers cropped up to exploit his proverbial 15 minutes; he played the son/father of Dudley Moore in Wie der Vater, so der Sohn (1987), one of Hollywood's periodic flavor-du-jour retreads of the mystical parent/sibling body-switch comedies; netted the starring role in a high-profile Pepsi Super Bowl XXIV commercial; rated top-billing in Die große Herausforderung (1989), an overwrought, widely-panned college drama about debate team wonks arguing against Roe v. Wade; and did a guest-shot, alongside sister Candace, on her ABC sister sitcom, Full House (1987) (1987-1995). Firmly established as the resident star of \"Growing Pains\", Cameron saw his pay jump to $50,000 a week and his fans sending him some 10,000 letters a week. But his coming-of-age took an unexpected turn, at least for everyone who worked with him. As he would later recall it in his autobiography, \"Still Growing\", the family of his first girlfriend initially exposed the 17-year-old to evangelical Christianity. Cameron experienced what he would later describe as a \"life-changing encounter with Jesus\" and declared himself \"born again\".\n\nSean Kanan's career encompasses many facets of the entertainment world including actor, author, comedian, and producer. Early in his career, Kanan was chosen at an open call by Oscar-winning Director, John Avildsen from over 2000 hopefuls for the role of Mike Barnes in the Karate Kid III. He went on to create two iconic characters, AJ QUARTERMAINE (GH) and DEACON SHARP (B&B/Y&R). Kanan's popularity as DEACON in Italy and ability to speak fluent Italian landed him on the Italian version of the popular show Dancing with the Stars where he lasted 9 weeks.\n\nOn the comedy stage, Kanan has performed at some of the countries leading clubs including the Laugh Factory, the Comedy Store, Dangerfield's, the Brokerage, Uncle Vinny's and other venues. On the theater stage, he has performed in Sam Shepard's True West twice, once at the Zephyr theater and once at the Palm Canyon Theater.\n\nSean penned The Modern Gentleman; Cooking and Entertaining with Sean Kanan (Dunham Books) and Secret of My Success. Kanan co-hosted a celebrity parenting radio talk show called Kanan's Rules, available for download on iTunes podcast. Sean Kanan spends his free time studying martial arts, writing scripts, cooking, performing his stand-up routine and further pursuing the study of the Italian, French, Mandarin, Russian and Japanese language. Sean also dedicates much of his time to numerous charitable and nonprofit endeavors including ASPCA, anti-bullying and the Red Cross.\n\nLean, angular-faced and authoritatively spoken lead / supporting actor Roy Scheider obviously never heard the old actor's axiom about \"never appearing with kids or animals\" lest they overshadow your performance. Breaking that rule did him no harm, though, as he achieved pop cult status by finding, fighting and blowing up a 25-foot-long Great White shark (nicknamed \"Bruce\") in the mega-hit Der weiße Hai (1975) and then electrocuting an even bigger Great White in the vastly inferior Der weiße Hai 2 (1978).\n\nAthletic Scheider was born in November 1932 in Orange, New Jersey, to Anna (Crosson) and Roy Bernhard Scheider, a mechanic. He was of German and Irish descent. A keen sportsman from a young age, he competed in baseball and boxing (his awkwardly mended broken nose is a result of his foray into Golden Gloves competitions). While at college, his pursuits turned from sports to theater and he studied drama at Rutgers and Franklin and Marshall. After a stint in the military, Scheider appeared with the New York Shakespeare Festival and won an \"Obie Award\" for his appearance in the play \"Stephen D.\"\n\nHis film career commenced with the campy Z-grade horror cheesefest The Curse of the Living Corpse (1964), and he then showed up in Star! (1968), Paper Lion (1968), Stiletto (1969) and Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970). In 1971 he really came to the attention of film audiences with his role in the Jane Fonda thriller Klute (1971) and then as Det. Buddy Russo (scoring his first Oscar nomination) alongside fiery Gene Hackman in the crime drama French Connection - Brennpunkt Brooklyn (1971). His performance as a tough street cop in that film led him into another tough cop role as NYC Det. Buddy Manucci in the underappreciated Die Seven-Ups (1973), which features one of the best car chase sequences ever put on film.\n\nIn the early 1970s the Peter Benchley novel \"Jaws\" was a phenomenal best-seller, and young director Steven Spielberg was chosen by Universal Pictures to direct the film adaptation, Der weiße Hai (1975), in which Scheider played police chief Brody and shared lead billing with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the tale of a New England seaside community terrorized by a hungry Great White shark. \"Jaws\" was a blockbuster, and for many years held the record as the highest-grossing film of all time. Scheider then turned up as the shady CIA agent brother of Dustin Hoffman in the unnerving Der Marathon-Mann (1976) and in the misfired William Friedkin-directed remake of Lohn der Angst (1953) titled Atemlos vor Angst (1977), before again returning to Amity to battle another giant shark in Der weiße Hai 2 (1978). Seeking a change from tough cops and hungry sharks, he took the role of womanizing, drug-popping choreographer Joe Gideon, the lead character of the semi-autobiographical portrayal of director Bob Fosse in the sparkling Hinter dem Rampenlicht - All that jazz (1979). It was another big hit for Scheider (and another Oscar nomination), with the film featuring a stunning opening sequence to the tune of the funky George Benson number \"On Broadway\", and breathtaking dance routines including the \"Airotica\" performance by the glamorous Sandahl Bergman.\n\nReturning to another law enforcement role, Scheider played a rebellious helicopter pilot in the John Badham conspiracy / action film Das fliegende Auge (1983), a scientist in the sequel to 2001 - Odyssee im Weltraum (1968) simply titled 2010 - Das Jahr, in dem wir Kontakt aufnehmen (1984), a cheating husband who turns the tables on his blackmailers in 52 Pick-Up (1986), a cold-blooded hit man in Hitman (1988) and a CIA operative in the muddled and slow-moving Das Russland-Haus (1990). The versatile Scheider was then cast as the captain of a futuristic submarine in the relatively popular TV series SeaQuest (1993), which ran for three seasons.\n\nInexplicably, however, Scheider had seemingly, and slowly, dropped out of favor with mainstream film audiences, and while he continued to remain busy, predominantly in supporting roles (generally as US presidents or military officers), most of the vehicles he appeared in were B-grade political thrillers such as Red Zone (1997), Executive Target (1997), Chain of Command - Helden sterben nie (2000) and Red Serpent (2003).\n\nHailing from Long Beach, California, talented character actor Anthony Zerbe has kept busy in Hollywood and on stage since the late 1960s, often playing villainous or untrustworthy characters, with his narrow gaze and unsettling smirk. Zerbe was born May 20, 1936 in Long Beach, and served a stint in the United States Air Force before heading off to New York to study drama under noted acting coach Stella Adler. He made his screen debut as Dutchie, one of Charlton Heston's fellow cowhands in the western Der Verwegene (1967), played a miner in Verflucht bis zum jüngsten Tag (1970), was a post-apocalyptic, lunatic messiah in Der Omega-Mann (1971), hustled a naive Paul Newman in Das war Roy Bean (1972), played a leper colony leader in Papillon (1973) and a former lawman gone bad in Mit Dynamit und frommen Sprüchen (1975).\n\nZerbe also starred alongside David Janssen in the television series Harry-O (1973) as the urbane, nattily dressed Lieutenant K.C. Trench, Janssen's sometime nemesis, for which he picked up an Emmy Award. Definitely in strong demand for sinister roles, Zerbe played a crazed scientist in the corny KISS in Attack of the Phantoms (1978), was an arrogant father in Dead Zone: Der Attentäter (1983), made a great General Ulysses S. Grant in Fackeln im Sturm II (1986), starred in the military drama H.A.R.T. - Spezialeinheit 500 (1986) and suffered a grisly demise in an airlock full of money in the James Bond thriller James Bond 007 - Lizenz zum Töten (1989). Most recently, Zerbe has been seen as Councillor Hamann in Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003).\n\nIn addition to his extensive television and film appearances, Zerbe has appeared in Broadway productions including \"The Little Foxes\", \"Terra Nova\" and \"Solomon's Child\". He was in residence for five summer seasons at The Old Globe Theatre playing several key Shakespearean characters to strong critical acclaim. He has also held residencies at the Theatre of the Living Arts in Philadelphia, the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. In 2003, he toured across several states with Roscoe Lee Browne in their production of \"Behind the Broken Words\", a performance of 20th-century poetry, comedy and drama.\n\nTim Dang is a theater director and producer, arts administrator, cultural diversity and equity advocate, adjunct lecturer, writer, and performer over the past four decades. He started out as an actor performing on stage at East West Players, appearing on television episodes, and still performs voiceover work.\n\nHe is the recipient of the Society of Directors and Choreographers' Zelda Fichandler Award for transforming the regional theatre arts landscape through theatre. He is producing artistic director emeritus of East West Players (EWP), having run the longest running professional theatre of color in the United States for 23 years through 2016. Tim has produced and directed over 100 plays and musicals at EWP, and other venues such as L.A. Theatre Works, PanAsian Repertory (NY), Geva Theater Center (NY), Perseverance Theatre (AK), Lewis Family Playhouse, Sierra Madre Playhouse (CA), and Singapore Repertory Theatre.\n\nFor four years, he served as an LA County Arts Commissioner appointed by Supervisor Hilda Solis for District 1. He was Co-Chair of the Cultural Equity and Inclusion Initiative (CEII) for the LA County Board of Supervisors through the LA County Department of Arts and Culture and served as the Arts and Culture sector leader for the Economic Resiliency Task Force during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFor six years, Tim was adjunct lecturer teaching directing and dramaturgy at the USC School of Dramatic Arts and prepared emerging artists about the audition process, industry business essentials, and networking at AMDA College for the Performing Arts.\n\nOffbeat comic actress and voice specialist Yeardley Smith has made a virtue out of her distinctive looks, small figure, and child-like nasal tones. Lending vocal life to the animated role of \"Lisa Simpson,\" the intelligent, caring, saxophone-droning, vegetarian member of the Simpson family, has been her bread-and-butter job for over a remarkable 30 years.\n\nWhile Yeardley is American, she was born Martha Maria Yeardley Smith on July 3, 1964, in Paris, France where her father served as a correspondent with UPI. By the time she was two, she and her family had moved to Washington, D.C., where she was raised. A shy, introverted child, she started her pixie-like young career as a teenager at a nearby dinner theater where she played \"Tinkerbell\" in a musical adaptation of \"Peter Pan\". After receiving her high school diploma, she apprenticed for a time at the famed Arena Stage, then headed off to New York and bigger things.\n\nYeardley understudied the role of \"Debbie\" on Broadway in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\", starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close, then took over the part for eight months. Small film offers started coming her way with Die Himmelsstürmer (1985) and Zeit der Vergeltung (1985), so in 1986, she headed West and settled. After some work on the LA stage with \"Boys and Girls/Men and Women\" (1987) and \"How the Other Half Loves\" (1988) and a recurring role on the ground-breaking gay comedy, Unter Brüdern (1984), Yeardley won the part of daughter \"Lisa Simpson\". The animated character was launched on the sketch TV comedy series, Die Tracey Ullman Show (1987). Two years later, she spun off into Die Simpsons (1989) and still going strong after 20 years.\n\nYeardley has made the TV rounds on-camera as well with amusing guest appearances on Dharma & Greg (1997) (recurring), \"Murphy Brown,\" \"Empty Next\" and \"Mama's Family.\" She also had regular role for three seasons as \"Louise\" on 4x Herman (1991). Other film supports during that time included roles in City Slickers - Die Großstadt-Helden (1991), Versprochen ist versprochen (1996) and Besser geht's nicht (1997).\n\nYeardley continues to be quite active well into the millennium. In 2004, Yeardley performed front-and-center in her own one-woman autobiographical show entitled \"More\" in New York.

On TV, Yeardley appeared as a guest on \"Becker,\" \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"Mom.\"\n\nMarried and divorced twice, Yeardley's first husband was actor Christopher Grove.\n\nIt all started 30 miles north of Boston, in the quaint New England coastal town of Manchester, Mass. At a young age, despite a loving family, proper upbringing and a good education, Tom decided to become an actor ---- Three defibrillator charges later, his parents threw their support behind him and the journey began.\n\nThat journey took him to school in New Hampshire, San Diego, England and finally the acting program at USC, where during his junior year, he landed his first professional role as Whit Champion, on the NBC drama series \"The Yellow Rose.\"\n\nAfter college, Tom continued studying acting with some of the best in the business: Vince Chase, Stella Adler, Winn Handman, and Roy London, to name but a few.\n\nHis body of work grew as well, including the television movie \"The Alamo - Thirteen Days To Glory\" with Alec Baldwin, the starring role in \"The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man,\" and stints on shows with shorter titles like \"Fame,\" \"Dynasty,\" \"Melrose Place,\" and \"Lonesome Dove.\" (He sang \"country\" on Fame, ladies).\n\nFeature films were also on the menu. Among them, \"Fever Pitch,\" directed by the legendary Richard Brooks, \"Red Rock West\" (there's a story behind that one), \"Courage Under Fire,\" directed by Ed Zwick, starring Denzel Washington and \"Conspiracy Theory,\" starring Mel Gibson, among others.\n\nTom continued to exercise his theater chops as well, with notable roles in the award winning \"Getting Out,\" at the Cast Theatre, \"The Wager,\" at the Colony Theatre and as Mark Antony in the critically acclaimed LA Shakespeare Festival production of \"Julius Caesar.\" Tom also spent eight years with the comedy improve troop WITHOUT A NET.\n\nThen came the new millennium, and with it Tom's \"multi-hyphenate\" status. Alongside friend and actor Jon Lindstrom, Tom wrote and Executive-Produced the feature film \"The Hard Easy,\" starring David Boreanaz, Vera Farmiga, Henry Thomas, Bruce Dern and Peter Weller. Their second script, \"Head High\" is currently the subject of a bidding war at two major studios - OK - \"should\" be the subject of a bidding war, or so they think. Tom has a number of solo projects in the pipeline as well. Among them, the un-romantic feature film comedy \"Dating Tammy,\" and the TV pilot \"Tee Time.\" \"Saying\" the lines however, is still Tom's first love and priority, and the past couple of years have offered plenty of that: \"Dexter\", \"Criminal Minds\", \"Without a Trace\", \" The CSI'S\", \"The Forgotten\"..... (and a really cool puppet show in Venice Beach).\n\nTom happily resides beach-side, Santa Monica, CA. Stay tuned."
