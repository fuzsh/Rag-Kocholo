        "text": "Andy Warhol Filmography\n\nGary Comenas (2020)\n\nFor cast listings go to \"Andy Warhol Actors\" here.\n\nAndy Warhol's silent films were shot at the sound speed of 24 frames per second and, during the 1960s, projected at the silent speed of 16 fps resulting in slow motion. The industry standard for silent films increased to 18 fps circa 1970 meaning that today Warhol's silent films are usually projected at that speed - still in slow motion but not as slow as during the 1960s. (AD21) The Warholstars filmography does not include all of Andy Warhol's 472 Screen Tests. For detailed information on the Screen Tests see Andy Warhol Screen Tests: The Films of Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonn√©, by Callie Angell.\n\n1963\n\nConnecticut footage\n\nFilmed: Summer 1963\n\nIncludes Andy Warhol Films Jack Smith Filming Normal Love.

For one performance Byars donned an egg-shaped headpiece and dressed an accomplice in a white couturier gown. Yvonne Rainer wore a black dress ad heels and danced improvisationally around the 'sea of white boxes' as Andy Warhol's movie camera whirled.\" (EYE191)\n\nThe footnote reads, \"A short piece of footage (forty feet) is extant.

He captures the start of an improvised solo performance in which Rainer wends her way around a Byars piece on the gallery floor.\" (MOV57)\n\nRollerskate/Dance Movie\n\nFilmed: c. late Sept. 1963\n\nCast includes: Fred Herko (SG144)\n\nIn the Stephen Koch filmography, Dance Movie is described as \"also known as Roller Skates\". But in Popism, Andy Warhol mentions both Roller Skate and Freddy Herko dance footage as separate projects:\n\nAndy Warhol (via Pat Hackett in Popism):\n\nI filmed Freddy three times. The first time was just a short dance thing on a roof. The second was a segment for The Thirteen Most Beautiful Boys...And the third was Roller Skate.

Hand Job consisted of a shorter approach to the subject of sleep. This time, Warhol would keep his Zapgruder speed film trained on his boy's face while John jerked off. He shot the film in the doorway of the toilet at the back of the Factory. It was so cold, Giorno recalled, you could see your breath. \"I said, 'Well how're we gonna do this?'\" and then Andy would suck my cock a little bit to get me going. Right after that he shot Blow Job. (LD190)\n\nBlow Job\n\nFilmed: Early 1964\n\nCast: on-screen actor DeVerne Bookwalter\n\nWillard Maas off-screen (giving blow job)\n\n(POP50/SG144/DB174/AD41)\n\nThe dating of this film depends on which source you accept. In Popism, Andy Warhol via Pat Hackett gives the impression it was filmed at the end of 1963. David Bourdon says that it was \"filmed in the Factory probably during the early weeks of 1964.\" (DB174) The Stephen Koch filmography lists it in 1963. (SG144) The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles listed it as 1964 during their Andy Warhol retrospective. Victor Bockris also listed it in 1964 in his filmography. (LD507)\n\nAlan Marlowe/Diane di Prima (AD292)\n\nFilmed: \"soon after 29 January, 1964\" (RW44)\n\nPoet Diane di Prima and Alan Marlowe were two of the founders of the New York Poets' Theater (see October 29, 1961), later renamed the American Theater for Poets. Marlowe was married to di Prima from 1962 to 1969. (DQ) He was also the lover of Warhol star Freddy Herko.\n\nFrom Andy Warhol, Poetry, and Gossip in the 1960s by Reva Wolf:\n\nWarhol filmed the short episode-like movie of di Prima and Marlowe... soon after 29 January 1964 when di Prima sent a letter to the artist that alluded to his interest in making a film of the couple: \"come see us & shoot a Day in Our House like you said & show the Alan & me pornography -.\" Warhol ended up filming di Prima and Marlowe for around three minutes, the duration of a 100-foot reel of film, rather than for the originally planned length of one day. Di Prima recalled, \"He came and shot a movie. It was a very short movie. A three or five minute movie of me and Alan. Alan is in bed, and he's covered by a tiger skin, which he's stroking the tail of in a very obviously suggestive manner. I get on the bed in a black leotard and tights and kind of trample him. It was a tiny room.\" (RW44)\n\nScreen Tests\n\nFilmed: 1964 - 1966\n\nSeries of more than 400 short films including: Gerard Malanga; filmmaker Barbara Rubin (1964); filmmaker Jonas Mekas (1964); filmmaker and poet Piero Heliczer (1964); poet Allen Ginsberg (c.64/65); John Ashbery (1965); Italian model and one time girlfriend to Gerard Malanga - Benedetta Barzini (1966); fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo (1965); Phoebe Russell (1965); model/actress/granddaughter of designer Elsa Schiaparelli, Marisa Berenson (1965); Nico (1966); Lou Reed (1966); John Wieners, Bob Dylan; Ingrid Superstar; Edie Sedgwick (1965); model Ivy Nicholson; Danny Fields; Billy Name (Linich); Salvador Dali (1966); Donovan (1966); Charles Henri Ford (1966); Rene Ricard (1966); poet Willard Maas (1966); Baby Jane Holzer; Phoebe Russell (1965); Marie Menken - filmmaker/writer/wife of Willard Maas/star of Chelsea Girls (1966); Italian millionaire publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (Benedetta Barzini's stepbrother) Nov. 66; poet Ted Berrigan (1966); Allen Midgette (1966); Anne Buchanan (early '64); and International Velvet (Susan Bottomly) (1966); Andy Warhol's \"first superstar\" Naomi Levine. (GM25)\n\nThe Madness of Lady Bright\n\nFilmed: 1964\n\nOriginally a play performed at the Caffe Cino.\n\nBruce Jenkins: \"...in one of the many unreleased films from this period, a complete live recording of Lanford Wilson's play, The Madness of Lady Bright (1964), Warhol begins one take by focusing on a striped cloth under which the titled character is writhing... While not sexually explicit, on the most 'out' projects about Warhol's early films was his documentation of Wilson's The Madness of Lady Bright, in its original Caffe Cino production Considered a seminal work in American gay theater, the play focuses on an aging homosexual on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Never finished or released, the film nonetheless signaled a commitment to gay-themed narratives...\" (MOV56/57)\n\nJill Johnston Dancing\n\nFilmed: Early 1964\n\nCast: Jill Johnston (BN28)\n\nJill Johnston was a dancer and dance critic for the Village Voice. She also had a drink problem and was committed to Bellevue several times for mental illness. Warhol filmed her dancing in the Factory using a hand-held camera, with the assistance of the artist Ray Johnson. Stills taken by Billy Name during the shooting show the paint and foil in the Factory's bathroom as \"freshly applied\" and the ceiling of the Factory as only partially painted with silver - confirming that the film is from early 1964, before the Factory paint job was finished. There are at least seven 100 ft. reels of Warhol films in existence labeled Jill Johnston, but it is as yet unknown whether any of those labeled films include this dance footage. (BN28)\n\nBruce Jenkins: Warhol \"made a half dozen short films with the dancer and choreographer Freddy Herko, as well as one of a pas de deux between Herko and the feminist dance critic and performer, Jill Johnston, shot on a Lower East Side rooftop. Johnston appears in one of the first films Warhol shot in the Factory, dancing around the empty space in an improvised solo.\" (MOV56)\n\nShoulder\n\nFilmed: Summer, 1964 according to the Mekas/Koch filmography.\n\nAccording to the first volume of the Andy Warhol film cat. rais., the film was probably shot on the same day as Jill Johnston Dancing. (AD53) In the Stephen Koch filmography, Shoulder is listed as \"16mm, 4 minutes, B/W, silent, 16 fps. Filmed summer, 1964. Lucinda Childs' shoulder.\" (SG145)\n\nEat\n\nFilmed: February 2, 1964\n\nCast: Robert Indiana (FAW13)\n\nDinner At Daley's\n\nFilmed March 6, 1964 (AD17/30)\n\nFrom Andy Warhol Screen Tests: The Films of Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne, Volume One by Callie Angell\"\n\nThe French artist Arman, one of the founders of the Nouveaux R√©alistes movement, was known in the 1960s for creating serial accumulations of various substances or objects sealed in Plexiglas boxes; for example, his Poubelles, begun in 1959, contain assemblages of rubbish, while Combustions, begun in 1963, contain assorted burned objects. Arman can also be seen in Warhol's film Dinner at Daley's, a documentation of a dinner performance by the Fluxus artist Daniel Spoerri that Warhol filmed on March 6, 1964. Warhol owned two of Arman's Poubelles and another accumulation called Amphetamines, which were put up for sale at Sotheby's auction of the Andy Warhol Collection in May 1988.

There were glamorous rumors that Waldo had escaped from Cuba with a million dollars in a suitcase... We'd shot The Life of Juanita Castro over at his house on West 10th Street in the Village early that year, with a Ronnie Tavel script inspired by Waldo, and Waldo was also in it. (POP113)\n\nAlthough the quote from POPism indicates that the film was shot at Waldo's home, it was actually shot at the Factory - but the idea for the film came about at a dinner at Waldo's. (NRG)\n\nRonald Tavel:\n\nFidel Castro's brother-in-law, Waldo Dias-Balart, was living in exiled in the center of the row of beautiful 19th century townhouses on the north side (10th Street) of Tompkins Square Park... I myself had visited Cuba after Castro was in office and before travel there for Americans was banned. I'd written short light verse and serious long poems about Cuba, knew a number of Cuban dancers-in-exile and nightclub entertainers and one celebrated stage and soap star, had several close Cuban friends and a Cuban lover, and been introduced by Andy to two very charming, politically active cuban sisters, Aniram Anipso and Mercedes Ospina, etc... Some weeks before Suicide was lensed, Waldo invited Andy and the immediate proteges to dinner. We sat around a classically extended, elegant table in the splendid home... A few drinks and naturally enough the conversation turned to the Cuban revolution and its political intrigues, particularly the in-fighting on the part of the Castro siblings, and most particularly the prima donna Juanita. Andy became fascinated and said we should do the life of story of Juanita Castro...

Hanhardt (Curator, Film and Video Whitney Museum and Director of The Andy Warhol Film Project (1991)):\n\nIn 1965, a video magazine offered to lend Warhol a Norelco reel-to-reel video recorder and player in order to write an article about his use of the equipment. It was definitely a learning experience, with Paul Morrissey, who was emerging as Warhol's key film adviser and later director, behind the camera. They encountered numerous problems working with the equipment, and no projects were initiated or developed. However, pieces were shot, including party and dance footage and a sequence showing Billy Name getting a haircut on a fire escape. An extraordinary sequence shows Edie Sedgwick in profile, speaking to Andy Warhol off-screen about Alice in Wonderland as an idea for a film and about the play of initials between Andy Warhol and Alice in Wonderland. This work was deliberately experimental, although the lighting and black background, along with the off-screen intereview technique, were to be developed further in the television shows. Yet the Norelco material, which is in the process of being restored and preserved, was a short-lived experiment at the Factory. Frustration with the equipment led Warhol to abandon video.

Fred Hughes accidentally found out she had died when he happened to answer a phone call from Andy's brother, John. Jed Johnson did not learn of her death until the summer of 1975, when he saw James Warhola, Paul's son, and asked, 'How's your grandmother doing?'

The invitation asked that Warhol and other invited artists 'produce with her a water sculpture, by submitting a water container or idea of one which would form half of the sculpture. Yoko will supply the other half - water.\" For the project, Warhol chose to create a videotape - a single 32 minute take of a water cooler from a fixed camera position, the soundtrack consisting of a group of friends, including himself and Paul Morrissey, gossiping around the water cooler at the Factory. At the exhibition, Water was shown on a monitor and a videocassette copy was displayed alongside. Yoko Ono had wanted to immerse the cassette in water as per the premise of the show, but Warhol refused.\n\nWater, 1971/ 1/2\" videotape, black and white, sound, 32 min.\n\nAndy Warhol's Frankenstein\n\nDirected by Paul Morrissey\n\n(aka Flesh for Frankenstein - shot in 3D)\n\nFilmed: Two months of filming beginning early March 1973 - at the same time as Andy Warhol's Dracula\n\nCast: Joe Dallesandro, Monique Van Voreen, Udo Kier, Arno Juering, Dalila Di Lazzaro, Srdjan Zelenovic, Nicoletta Elmi, Marco Liofredi, Liu Bosisio, Fiorella Masselli, Cristina Gaioni, Rosita Torosh, Carla Mancini (JOE120)\n\nThe Victor Bockris book on Warhol incorrectly gives the impression that Andy Warhol's Frankenstein and Andy Warhol's Dracula were filmed in the Summer of 1973. (In early August of that year, Warhol was in Italy filming his cameo appearance in The Drivers Seat with Elizabeth Taylor.)\n\nBob Collacello, who worked for Andy Warhol at the time, remembers the filming in spring 1973: \"Andy Archie, and Fred commuted between New York and Rome that spring while Frankenstein and Dracula were being shot at Cinecitta. It was a tough schedule: Ponti had given them eight weeks, and an $800,000 budget, to shoot both movies back to back.\" (BC145)\n\nColacello's recollection is backed up by that of Joe Dallesandro, who starred in both films. In Little Joe Superstar (based on conversations with Joe as well as independent research), author Michael Ferguson confirms that the two films were shot \"back-to-back over a two month period beginning in early March, 1973.\" (JOE120)\n\nIn David Bourdon's book on Warhol, he says that the films were made back to back in four weeks, rather than the two month period attributed by Ferguson and Collacello.

Similar in spirit to his film Chelsea Girls, this television program, which has never been released is a series of encounters by Warhol's associates. Vivian's Girls is a soap opera that was taped twice a week in Warhol's studio. It concerns a boarding house owned by the title character. From what little is known about it, Warhol used stock characters, improvised dialogue and a single set.\" (PS184)\n\nJohn G. Hanhardt (Curator Whitney Museum Film and Video and Director of The Andy Warhol Film Project - 1991):\n\n\"During this time, Warhol was involved in developing, with Vincent Fremont, ideas and scripts for television. The first of these, Vivian's Girls (1973), was to be a television show loosely structured around a group of models and drag queens who were living together. Shot on location, it featured Brigid (Polk) Berlin, Candy Darling, Nancy North, Paul Palmero, and others. The production, which was never finally edited or shown, played with soap opera forms and, according to Fremont (who scripted it), was inspired by both The Chelsea Girls (1966) and Gregory La Cava's Stage Door (1937). Vivian's Girls evolved into another video production, Phoney (1973)...\" (VT4)\n\nPhoney (Video)\n\n(aka Phonies (BC140))\n\nCast includes: Candy Darling, Maxime de la Falaise, John Richardson, Brigid Berlin (Polk), Charles Rydell, Susan Blonde (UW73)\n\nNothing Special footage (Video)\n\nFilmed: c. 1975\n\nCast includes: Brigid Berlin (Polk), Paloma Picasso, Nicky Weymouth, Angelica Huston, Joan-Juliet Buck (UW74/AB)\n\nIn the book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), published in 1975, Andy Warhol refered to the \"great unfulfilled ambition\" of his life - his own regular televisiion show. In the book, he tells 'B' (Brigid Berlin) that he is going to call his show Nothing Special. (AB)\n\nIn the seventies Vincent Fremont and Bob Colacello had written a treatment of the show for John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia (and later, in the eighties, deemed the second-richest man in America by Forbes magazine). Warhol and Colacello had met him at one of the dinners they attended at the Iranian Embassy. But he \"hurriedly\" rejected the TV show idea. (BC286)\n\nVincent Fremont:\n\n\"[Nothing Special] was another idea that Andy had for the name of another TV series. There wasn't really a complete idea of what this TV series would be about, but we did various tests including monologues by different people, the best done by Brigid Berlin. Her monologue about money is one of the highlights. We also practiced with Brigid doing newscasts.

(UW73) Bob Collacello recalled that originally the footage was filmed for Phoney - Warhol had suggested dong a television show on the phone saying \"It can be people calling each other up and fighting.\" (BC141) The Fight tape and some of the footage taped for Phoney were shown in 1991 at the Whitney in Andy Warhol's Video & Television Retrospective. (UW73)\n\nThe 1975 date for Fight is the 'official' date attributed to the video. If, as Colacello suggests, Fight was initially filmed as part of Phoney the actual filming probably took place earlier - as the \"official\" date attributed to Phoney is 1973.\n\nAndy Warhol's Bad\n\nA Warhol production but not directed by him.\n\nFilmed: Spring 1976\n\nScreenplay by George Abagnalo and Pat Hackett\n\nDirected by Jed Johnson (Andy Warhol's boyfriend - see 1968)\n\nCast includes: Carroll Baker, Gordon Oas-Heim, Cyrinda Fox, Matthew Anton, Cathy Roskam, Susan Tyrrell, Mary Boylan, Perry King, Michael Forella, Kitty Bruce, Tere Tereba, Renee Paris, Stefania Casini, John Starke, Ruth Jaroslow, Geraldine Smith, Maria Smith, Michael Sullivan, Tito Goya, Charles McGregor, Brigid Berlin (Polk), Lawrence Tierney, Matthew Reich, Charles Welch, Tom Quinn, Richard Cummings, Vasco Valladares, Barbara Hunt, Pat Way, Robert Hodges, Barbara Allen, Susan Blond, Jane Forth, Tamara Horax, Jerry Rosenberg, John Dunn, Joe Lambie (LD396)\n\nFashion (1979-1980) (TV Series)\n\nTen 30 min. episodes on 3/4\" videotape, colour, sound\n\nAndy Warhol's TV (Manhattan Cable TV) (1980-1982) (TV Series)\n\nEighteen 30 min. episodes on 3/4\" videotape\n\nAndy Warhol's TV on Saturday Night Live (1981)\n\nThree short segments lasting about 1-2 mins. on 1\" videotape\n\nAndy Warhol's TV (Madison Square Network) (1983) (TV Series)\n\nNine 30 min. episodes on 1\" videotape, colour, sound\n\nAndy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes (MTV) (TV Series) (1985-1987)\n\nFive 30 min. episodes incl. pilot on 1\" videotape, colour, sound\n\nMusic Videos\n\nFilmed: c. 1981-1986\n\nIncludes: The Cars, Curiosity Killed The Cat, Miguel Bose, Walter Steding, Loredana Berte (UW76/VT14-16)\n\nVincent Fremont:\n\n\"Andy wanted us to be producing not only the TV show, but camera-for-hire projects, like fashion-promo videos and music videos.
