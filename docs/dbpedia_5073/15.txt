Early life

D'Arbanville, born May 25, 1951 in New York City, is the daughter of Jean (née Scott), an artist, and George D'Arbanville, a bartender, and attended PS 41 on Eleventh Street. She went to high school at Quintano's School for Professional Children.

Career

D'Arbanville acted in her first film in 1960 at age 8; a New York University student film about a girl and her cat, titled Tuesday and Blue Silk. Andy Warhol discovered her during a gig as a club disc jockey when she was 13, and cast her at age 16 in his 1968 film Flesh.

After Flesh, D'Arbanville performed in Warhol's L'Amour (1973), and as the title character in David Hamilton's movie Bilitis (1977).

After her unabashed risqué performances in her youth, D'Arbanville has worked steadily in film and television series in the United States and France. In 1987, D'Arbanville won a Drama-Logue Award as Best Actress for her 1987 stage performance, in Italian American Reconciliation. She was well known for her role as Lt. Virginia Cooper on the FOX series New York Undercover.

Private life

In the late 1960s, when she was a model in London, she met and developed a romance with singer/songwriter Cat Stevens. She was the inspiration for at least two of his hit songs: "Lady D'Arbanville", and "Wild World", which were released on Mona Bone Jakon and Tea for the Tillerman, respectively. She left him for periods of time to continue her modeling career in Paris and New York City, and was a part of Warhol's Factory scene. In an Interview with Warhol, she said wistfully that she had heard the song "Lady D'Arbanville":

Steven wrote that song "Lady D'Arbanville" when I left for New York. I left for a month, it wasn't the end of the world was it? But he wrote this whole song about "Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still." It's about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him it was like I was lying in a coffin... He wrote that because he missed me, because he was down... It's a sad song.

(Cat Stevens was a stage name which D'Arbanville never used; she preferred his birth name, Steven Demetre Georgiou.)

D'Arbanville later had a relationship with actor Don Johnson from 1981-1986. The couple had a son, Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982).

D'Arbanville has been married three times, with each of her marriages ending in divorce. She lived in France for 10 years, becoming fluent in French, and was married to French actor Roger Miremont then known as Roger Mirmont, from August 1, 1975, to 1980. From April 26, 1980, to 1981, her husband was Steve Curry. She was then married to former New York City firefighter Terry Quinn from June 15, 1993, to March 12, 2002. They have three children, daughters Emmelyn and Alexandra, and son Liam.
