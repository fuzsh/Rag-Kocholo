        "text": "Tim Ferriss, the man who experiments in lifestyle design and renowned for introducing the 4 hour work week to the world, started his own podcast only less than half a year ago. He managed to pull off the unexpected and was invited to visit Southern California to interview the man himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThis podcast interview is just under 1.5 hours of pure gold, and gives you a chance to connect with Arnold through the interviewer’s incredible engagement ability.\n\nHere are 10 lessons that open up answers on how one man can achieve so much in a short amount of time.\n\n1. ‘My confidence came from my vision’\n\nOne advice you’ll find in many ‘self-development’ books without fail, is having a clear vision.\n\nTim mentioned about a very old photograph from the Junior Mr Europe contest, and noticed the confidence (even arrogance) on a young Arnold’s facial expression.\n\n‘I wasn’t there to compete, I was there to WIN’\n\nHe had a clear vision, so he knew ‘why‘ training 5 hours a day, eating more food, doing 200 sit ups, plus the daily jobs in the military, was paramount and easier to persevere during the time in the trenches.\n\nArnold’s mind was set on being one step closer to winning Mr Universe, one day.\n\n2. ‘That was my shot’\n\nGoing back to his first ever bodybuilding competition in 1965, the ‘impossible‘ was achieved by pushing through the barriers like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nSneaking out of the military camp (without a passport), to taking the cheapest train that stopped at every station…\n\n‘There was this will(power) there, that no matter what it takes, even if I had to crawl to Germany…I had to be there”\n\nHe knew that was his calling, a once in a life time opportunity to stand on an international stage.\n\nThis was the beginning of his epic legacy.\n\n3. ‘I felt that people were vulnerable’\n\nThe Art of Psychological Warfare. An interesting topic on how Arnold used it to his advantage to win over his competition in bodybuilding. By asking and commenting on their weak points, they would end up throwing themselves off by developing self-doubt.\n\nBack then, he felt that any area of sport was not only a physical thing was also a mental thing which ended up being much more important.\n\nHis natural leadership skills and ‘success‘ comes down to being able to control any environment by exposing an individual’s vulnerability, and finding solutions instead of ‘beating around the bush‘.\n\nHe was curious about human psychology, the strengths and weaknesses of people and how to help build them up. One extreme example is mailing (fake) cow testicals to Politicians, for not being serious enough in life…\n\n”10 years down the line we’ll look back at this day and laugh at it”.\n\n4. ‘I never auditioned’\n\nReferring to his humbling beginnings as an up-an-coming actor. It was clear he wasn’t gunning for regular spots, since being the ‘blonde guy in California…looking athletic and cute‘ was the opposite to his monstrous figure and persona.\n\nInstead, Arnold wanted to calve out a niche that would bring back the 50’s and 60’s muscle movies.\n\nDespite the criticisms, the movie ‘Conan’ earned Schwarzenegger worldwide recognition.\n\n5. ‘And of course, there were the neysayers’\n\nAh, ‘neysayers’. The famous word you may have heard from Arnold’s ‘6 rules of success speech‘ that people all over the world listen to for inspiration.\n\nA lot of big Producers and Agents would say that he is too big and muscly and wouldn’t make it in the movies. Throughout his multiple successful careers, there were always doubters and it’s obvious how little Arnold paid attention to it.\n\n6. ‘He believed in me’\n\nBoth directors, Bob Rafelson (Staying Hungry) and James Cameron (The Terminator) saw something in the newbie Austrian actor.\n\nArnold’s looks and personality had the potential to work on the camera, and without Mr Cameron’s compliment, the Terminator and the well recognised phrase…’I’ll be back’…wouldn’t exist today.\n\n7. ‘I did not rely on my movie career to make a living’\n\nAgain coming back, Arnold witnessed over the years, many people who he met in the gym and acting classes were all ‘vulnerable‘ because they didn’t have much money and took up any offers to make a living.\n\nHe instead made a wise decision to invest in real estate with money earned from bodybuilding shows, seminars, and even courses through mail orders to start off investing in an apartment. That quickly led to trading other apartments, buildings, offices and, ultimately became a millionaire before his showbiz acting career.\n\nBeing financially independent allowed him to star in other genres like the comedy movie, ‘Twins’ with Danny DeVito.\n\n8. ‘Franco would play the bad guy, and I would play the good guy’\n\nFranco Columbu was a dear close friend of Arnold’s who achieved many success stories in his own right. From powerlifting champion, boxing champion and bodybuilding champion, Mr Universe and Mr Olympic.\n\nDuring the late 60s, the first business venture for Arnold was actually a bricklaying business, who he partnered with Franco and made a success through the pair’s savvy marketing and personalities.\n\nTimely enough, the San Fernando earthquake in 1971 injected a lumpy cash-flow into the business. They were also training partners in Germany, and have remained in a very loyal relationship, even till today.\n\n9. ‘I should keep the two apart’\n\nBriefly mentioning about his upcoming movies, Tim was curious as to why at this day an age, Arnold doesn’t finance his own movies and become the sole owner.\n\nPerforming and investing is two completely different businesses, and Arnold believes everyone should play their strengths – that’s why he sticks with acting and allows other people who are better at the numbers to focus on finance.\n\n10.‘Unless I have a passion for it’\n\nThe one exception when it comes to investing money in filming, is when it comes to projects that involve giving back. Like the ‘Brooklyn Castle’ documentary supporting after school programs to help children be smart (learn to play chess) and stay off the streets.\n\nHaving a real purpose, drives his decision making and we should take this lesson on board for future open loop opportunities.\n\nTim Ferriss & Arnold Schwarzenegger Interview\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjbqVdJsr4w\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s Daily Routine\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwD8n62wj0\n\nIn the words of the Governator – Who do you want to be?\n\nTackling Procrastination and Indecisiveness\n\nHi, Joel Brown here. As the person behind Addicted to Success and Mind Strong, I’m often asked about tackling procrastination and making swift, effective decisions. It’s a common struggle in today’s world, where distractions are endless.\n\nProcrastination often creeps in when we’re bombarded with social media notifications, breaking news, and the hustle of daily life. This leads to a fear-driven indecision, where we’re paralyzed by the thought of failure or judgment.\n\nHere’s a video breakdown of how to stop procrastinating and be more decisive if you are more of a visual person:\n\nEmbracing Speed and Momentum to Stop Procrastination\n\nOne of the most impactful lessons in my journey is understanding the role of speed in overcoming procrastination. A mentor of mine, a highly successful individual, always emphasized:\n\n“Success loves speed, and money loves momentum.”\n\nThis principle is crucial in combating procrastination. It’s about seizing opportunities quickly, not just for financial gain, but for the invaluable experiences and connections they bring.\n\nUnderstanding Analysis Paralysis: A Key to Overcoming Procrastination\n\nA major hurdle in decision-making is what’s commonly known as analysis paralysis, a significant form of procrastination. It happens when our decision-making process, governed by the prefrontal cortex, gets overwhelmed. To break free from this form of procrastination, try calming techniques like deep breathing. It’s surprising how such simple steps can clear a cluttered mind and help you move past procrastination.\n\nThe Long-Term Effects of Procrastination and Indecision\n\nProcrastination isn’t just about putting off decisions; it can lead to a reduced sense of life satisfaction over time.\n\nIn a conversation I had with Tony Robbins, we discussed how the quality of our lives hinges on the quality of our decisions.\n\nTherefore, overcoming procrastination and indecision is vital for a fulfilling life.\n\nMy Top Strategies for Beating Procrastination\n\nSeek Guidance from the Experienced: To combat procrastination, connect with people who’ve achieved the goals you’re aiming for. Their experience can be a guiding light when you’re stuck in indecision.\n\nUse Deadlines as Anti-Procrastination Tools: Setting deadlines is a powerful way to break the cycle of procrastination. They create a sense of urgency that pushes you into action.\n\nAccept Imperfection to Move Past Procrastination: Understand that no one is perfect, and that includes you. Accepting this can alleviate the pressure that often leads to procrastination.\n\nIdentify Your Procrastination Type to Find Solutions\n\nProcrastination manifests in various forms. I’ve developed a quiz (find it at mindstrongacademy.com/quiz) to help you identify your specific type of procrastination. Understanding your personal procrastination style is a crucial step in addressing it effectively.\n\nAdditional Tips on Making Quality Decisions and Beating Procrastination\n\nWhen it comes to decision-making, it’s important to not get too bogged down in analyzing pros and cons. While analysis is important, excessive scrutiny can lead to procrastination. Trusting your intuition often plays a crucial role in breaking free from procrastination.\n\nHandling Major Life Choices Without Procrastination\n\nFor significant decisions in life, whether in your career or personal relationships, procrastination can be particularly challenging.\n\nTo address this, break down these big decisions into smaller steps. Assess the potential outcomes realistically to understand that often, the fear of a negative outcome is more intimidating than the actual consequences.\n\nConclusion: Your Journey Away from Procrastination Begins Now\n\nTo wrap up, remember that overcoming procrastination and indecision is about understanding your own patterns, seeking wise counsel, setting deadlines, and embracing your imperfections. It’s time to start making those impactful decisions and enjoying the journey of life.\n\nWhether it’s through the Mind Strong Academy or my procrastination quiz, I’m here to guide you on your path to decisive action.\n\nI believe in your ability to conquer procrastination and live a life of purposeful decisions.\n\nWhat if I told you that the negative thoughts or self-limiting beliefs that you may have, are not actually yours?\n\nIn this article, I will discuss subconscious programming and how it can be reprogrammed in a way that allows you to reach your greatest potential. I will also provide tips on how you can integrate this information as a leader within the workplace.\n\nThe subconscious mind is shaped before we begin forming our own conscious thoughts, and these conscious thoughts are influenced by the subconscious mind. This means that even the thoughts that you’re consciously having, are merely an extension of that pre-existing conditioning.\n\nWhen something becomes deeply ingrained within your mind through repetition, and there are other supporting thoughts that reinforce it, you will identify this information as your truth. These repeated thoughts become beliefs, and your actions will align to support and validate these beliefs.\n\nThe Importance of Observing Your Thoughts\n\nIf you continuously tell yourself that you aren’t capable or good enough, how likely are you to put in the effort to challenge this narrative? If you’ve always been a procrastinator and tell yourself that you always will be, you’re going to continue procrastinating. If you run into an obstacle and don’t believe you can overcome it, you’re not going to look for solutions or try your best to resolve it.\n\nIt’s extremely important for you to become an observer of your thoughts and understand the impacts of how those thoughts can impact your life, relationships, and overall outlook on life.\n\nHere are some questions to help guide you:\n\n– What are your recurring negative thoughts, and how are they impacting your performance and relationships?\n\n– How have these thoughts held you back from achieving your goals and living the life that you’ve always dreamed of?\n\n– What have these thoughts already cost you and what else will they cost you if they don’t change?\n\nSocietal conditioning, influenced by a lower level of collective consciousness, has made the experience of debilitating thoughts highly prevalent. It’s not your fault that you have them, but it is your responsibility to change them and choose better ones.\n\nThe Subconscious Must Be Reprogrammed\n\nReprogramming the subconscious involves positive affirmations, visualization, and consistent repetition to replace negative beliefs with positive ones. You have to become aware of the thoughts that make you feel bad and do not serve your best interest.\n\nWhat are the growth-oriented thoughts that would you rather have instead? Any time that a debilitating thought crosses your mind, always correct it with new thought that uplifts, encourages and empowers you. Be consistent, be patient and understand that your logical mind will not make this process easy for you at first.\n\nBeing Delusional vs. Consciously Creating a Better Reality for Yourself\n\nBy definition, the term delusional means “holding false beliefs or judgments about external reality that are held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary”. When you have held onto debilitating beliefs for so long and your previous actions have served as evidence to confirm their truth, it is inevitable that your logical mind will deem your new thoughts as delusional. This is where embracing change tends to become most challenging, as it involves confronting this resistance with unwavering commitment.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that your former beliefs and former actions do not dictate your future, unless they remain the same. As the old beliefs become obsolete and new beliefs take their place, there will also be new aligned actions that produce different results, and this will serve as evidence to support your new truth. That being said, the most delusional thing that anyone can do is elect to keep an unfavorable mindset that was programmed for them by external factors and willingly relinquish their own personal power as a result of it.\n\nSuccess is Fundamentally Rooted in the Mindset\n\nHow we show up for ourselves and others, communicate with employees, and perform in business are deeply connected to our mindset and everything that has shaped it.

It’s never too late to embark on an empowering journey to reprogram your mind, and achieve the life you have always dreamed of!\n\nFor more tips and strategies on how to improve your mindset, follow me at @bigdivineenergy."
