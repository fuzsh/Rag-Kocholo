        "text": "Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chairman\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognized individuals on the planet, having led an amazing life and achieving beyond his dreams in Hollywood, fitness, and public service. In an effort to give back to the country that allowed him to accomplish so much, Schwarzenegger ran for public office and was elected California’s 38th Governor.\n\nCalled “The People’s Governor,” Schwarzenegger worked with leaders of both major political parties to address the greatest challenges facing the state in a bold and historic manner. His leadership put California at the forefront of the nation in addressing climate change, pushing for the development of renewable energies, rebuilding our critical infrastructure, investing in stem cell research, and putting in place health care and political reforms. Schwarzenegger pushed for historic investment in California’s roads, bridges, water delivery systems, and schools. He proposed a comprehensive health care reform initiative and ensured California was the first state to create a Health Benefits Exchange. He also put politics back in the hands of the people through citizen-based redistricting and primary election reform.\n\nRecognizing that states have the responsibility to provide the best possible education to every child, Schwarzenegger committed himself to offering top-quality early childhood development programs, comprehensive after-school programs for all elementary and middle schools, parental choice through high-performing charter schools, and expanding career technical education programs.\n\nContinuing his commitment to environmental leadership, in 2011 he co-founded R20, a global non-profit of sub-national governments and regional leaders working together to address climate change and build a green economy. In 2012 he partnered with USC to launch the USC Schwarzenegger Institute to continue his work on the many policy initiatives he championed during his two terms as Governor.\n\nConyers Davis, Global Director\n\n[email protected]\n\n(213) 821-1748\n\nConyers Davis is an experienced communications advisor, project manager and campaign strategist. He manages communications, special projects and external relations for the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy.\n\nCalled “The People’s Governor,” Schwarzenegger worked with leaders of both major political parties to address the greatest challenges facing the state in a bold and historic manner.

In 2012 he partnered with USC to launch the USC Schwarzenegger Institute to continue his work on the many policy initiatives he championed during his two terms as Governor.\n\nChristian Grose, Academic Director\n\nChristian Grose is Professor of Public Policy; and Professor of Political Science at the University of Southern California. He is the Academic Director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. He served as the Director of the Political Science and International Relations Ph.D. program in USC Dornsife College from 2015-18. He is editor of the journal Research & Politics. In 2020, he led a team that administered the USC Schwarzenegger Institute nonpartisan democracy grants to local election administrators to open new polling places; and he is now conducting research about how best to improve voter access and voting rights based around this community-engaged work.\n\nHe is the author of more than 50 articles, chapters, policy reports, and other works about American politics; legislative politics; public administration; public policy; race and ethnicity; voting rights; and political representation; including in the American Political Science Review; the American Journal of Political Science; the Journal of Politics; the British Journal of Political Science; Political Research Quarterly; Legislative Studies Quarterly; and Political Behavior. His book Congress in Black and White (Cambridge University Press) won the best book on race and politics award from the American Political Science Association.

In total, he has raised nearly $3 million for research and other activities at USC. Grose’s research has been profiled in the Washington Post, the New York Times, National Public Radio, and other media outlets.\n\nGrose directs the Democracy Lab, where researchers, students, and policy practitioners work together to generate new ideas to reform American democracy. His recent work examines behavioral and social choices made by public officials and public election administrators, and how they are constrained by institutions and law. He is also an expert in political reforms and voting rights, including independent redistricting commissions. His research often uses field and survey experimental techniques to answer questions about public policy, political institutions, and the behavior of public administrators and elected officials. Some of this research involves partnerships with practitioners and the community.
