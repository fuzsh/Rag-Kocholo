        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn a candid interview on \"The Graham Norton Show,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger discussed his early struggles with his thick Austrian accent, which he once tried to eliminate. Surprisingly, his accent turned into a unique asset for his iconic roles in movies like \"The Terminator.\" He also reminisced about his competitive rivalry with Sylvester Stallone, which evolved into a lasting friendship. Fans can explore his career in the three-part Netflix documentary \"Arnold,\" now available for streaming.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, the iconic action star, shared some revealing insights on a recent episode of \"The Graham Norton Show.\" He discussed his efforts to shed his thick Austrian accent early in his career and how it unexpectedly became an asset in Hollywood.\n\nReflecting on his journey in the entertainment industry, Schwarzenegger disclosed, \"I had an English coach and an acting coach and a speech coach and an accent-removal coach, who has passed away since then, but I should have otherwise gotten my money back.\" He recalled the advice he received from his accent-removal coach, saying, \"I remember he'd say, 'You know you always say s-ree. It's three, with a T-H.' So he had me say, 'Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three and one-third,' with the T-H and not with the S.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger's determination to improve his accent was a part of his early efforts to establish himself in the industry. When congratulated by Norton on his improved pronunciation of \"three,\" Schwarzenegger humorously responded, \"After 5,000 years, right?\"\n\nWhat's particularly interesting is how his accent, initially seen as an obstacle, turned into an asset. Schwarzenegger explained that influential figures in Hollywood had reservations about his accent, but it eventually became a defining feature of his career. He recalled, \"When I did 'Terminator,' Jim Cameron said, 'What made Terminator work and why it became successful is because Schwarzenegger talks like a machine.'\"\n\nDuring the course of the interview, Schwarzenegger also spoke about his rivalry with Sylvester Stallone, another Hollywood stalwart. The rivalry began as the two emerged as the icons of the action genre, at the same time. It began with 'The Terminator' for Schwarzenegger and 'Rambo' for Stallone.\n\nSchwarzenegger reminisced, \"We were movie rivals, but we took the competitiveness to the extreme â€“ we each had to have the best body, we had to kill more people in our films and we had to have the biggest guns. It got out of control, and we tried to derail each other.\"\n\nSurprisingly, their fierce rivalry took an unexpected turn when they both invested in Planet Hollywood. Schwarzenegger revealed, \"Then when we both invested in Planet Hollywood, we started flying around the world together to promote it, and we became fantastic friends. He is a great human being, and we are now inseparable.\"\n\nFor fans of Schwarzenegger's career, his three-part Netflix documentary titled \"Arnold\" is now available for streaming. This documentary provides an in-depth look at the life and career of the legendary action star.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
