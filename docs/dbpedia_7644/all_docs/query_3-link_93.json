        "text": "The World of Publishing\n\nIN 1921, JUST THREE YEARS AFTER the founding of the First Austrian Republic, a Viennese observer of the book trade by the name of Carl Junker lamented that there were no literary publishing houses worthy of mention (“[kein] namhafter belletristischer Verlag”) in Austria. There is some truth in this statement, for a glance at the publishing world at the time reveals that the popular literature of the turn of the century, which is today considered by literary historians to be representative of the period and of Austrian literature in general, appeared in publishing houses in Berlin or Leipzig. The works of the modern writers of Jung-Wien, for example, appeared primarily in the publishing house of Samuel Fischer in Berlin. Those of the equally popular pan-German or nationalistic writers were published by the L. Staackmann Verlag in Leipzig, whence the term “Staackmänner.” Developments between 1918 and 1945 have to be viewed in light of the circumstances under which publishing was possible in the Habsburg Monarchy. Indeed, from the eighteenth century on, the many “Buchhändlerordnungen” — the official rules and regulations of the book trade — and general restrictions from above give the impression that printing and selling books was something to be tolerated rather than welcomed. The official attitude toward the book trade over the decades explains why Germany, not only because of the larger German-speaking population, was able to persuade so many Austrian writers to publish there, and why the book and publishing trades were so dependent on the German market. It is important to note that the major feature which distinguished the “Austrian” book trade from the “German” book trade in the nineteenth century and on up until the end of the First World War was greater commercial freedom and better copyright protection.\n\nThe fact that many nineteenth-century Austrian writers, among them Franz Grillparzer or Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, also published a good part of their works in Germany raises the question as to the characteristics of the nineteenth century publishing landscape in Austria(-Hungary), a landscape which was to change dramatically after the First World War. Traditionally, Vienna, as the capital of the vast Habsburg Monarchy, was the main book selling and publishing center.\n\nOF ALL THE LITERARY GENRES, poetry is perhaps most strongly shaped by the language in which it is written, and least determined by political territory. Poems often have no culturally and nationally distinctive setting; they are seldom peopled by characters with an obvious national identity; and reception of the poetic forms that were dominant in the twentieth century is rarely dependent on performance in a public space. Nevertheless, all poetry is specific to language communities and therefore to cultural and political communities. The complexity of those communities in Austria, and their changing identities in the political contexts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, First Republic, Third Reich, and Second Republic, have given poets a keen awareness of language and its possibilities. This is enhanced by the daily encounter with the difference between High German and dialect, between the regionally neutral “German” Schriftsprache (written language) and the regionally specific “Austrian” language of oral communication. Throughout the twentieth century, the Austrian lyric has reached out across national boundaries to the point of obscuring its cultural origins, appealing to the entire German language community. Simultaneously, it has served to articulate and strengthen local identities. The purpose of this chapter is to explore connections and continuities in Austrian poetry from the perspective of Austria as a changing political and cultural entity that is defined as much by its tensions, fissures, and dispersals as by its cohesiveness.\n\nThe Legacy of Rilke\n\nWhile the poetry of Hugo von Hofmannsthal continued to resonate in the work of younger poets, and the visionary imagery and sonorous diction of Georg Trakl provided an important stimulus for many poets between the wars and after, it was above all Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926) who constituted the benchmark for younger Austrian poets. He was born in Prague, far from the territory that was to define Austria from 1918 onward, but in a cultural center within the Austrian Empire that contributed vitally to the now established canon of German modernist literature. Much of Rilke's poetry was written, or at least commenced, before the First World War, but the works that gave him his supreme status were completed in 1922: Duineser Elegien (Duino Elegies, 1923) and Die Sonette an Orpheus (The Sonnets to Orpheus, 1923).\n\nAUSTRIAN FICTION BETWEEN THE WARS is marked by the trauma of the Habsburg Empire's dissolution. It left a former Imperial capital incongruously stranded in a small, largely Alpine republic. The progressive Socialism of “Red Vienna” was at odds with the conservatism of the provinces. Inflation, unemployment, and threats from opposing paramilitary forces culminated in the Civil War of February 1934, the suspension of parliament, and the installation of the clerical authoritarian Ständestaat (corporate state), which was nevertheless a bulwark against Nazi Germany. The Anschluss in March 1938 drove some writers to suicide and sent many into exile. Of those who remained in Austria, some adjusted to the new regime in ways that have only been uncovered by recent research. Politics and literature are therefore inextricable, yet historical distance has not only disclosed political allegiances but shown that their relation to the value of literary texts is a complex one.\n\n“Austria” is a contested term, and the spatial and temporal boundaries of this chapter cannot be firm. Writers born in the former Habsburg Empire who thematized Austria will be discussed, even if they led much of their lives abroad. Writers from Prague will otherwise be excluded, despite the injustice to the many talented German-language writers of the generation after Kafka who lived in the First Czechoslovak Republic. And some novels will be discussed which, though published after the Second World War, deal with events of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n“Young Vienna” after 1918\n\nThe writers who emerged in the 1890s as members of the “Young Vienna” circle — Arthur Schnitzler (1862–1931), Hugo von Hofmannsthal (1874–1929), Hermann Bahr (1863–1934) — were still active in the uncomfortable new postwar world, though their fiction was still set amid the relative stability of the Habsburg Empire before the war or even earlier. Hofmannsthal's unfinished novel Andreas oder die Vereinigten (translated as Andreas, or The United), begun in 1907 and written mainly in 1912 and 1913, was published only posthumously in 1932. Although Hofmannsthal set it, like his play Der Rosenkavalier (The Chevalier of the Rose, 1911), in the eighteenth century, this modernist Bildungsroman anticipates many concerns of interwar fiction.\n\nTHE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE AUSTRIAN THEATER after 1945 had initially to face the traumatic fact that the Staatsoper and the Burgtheater, previously the centers of its tradition, could no longer be used for performances. The great venues of Austrian drama had been destroyed by bombs. Performances were held in “Ronacher,” a former popular entertainment hall. This destruction of the national theaters meant the destruction of cultural and political self-respect. “Mit dem Stephansdom hat Wien seinen Glauben, mit der Burg seinen Stolz, mit der Oper die Freude verloren” (Along with St Stephen’s, Austria lost its faith; with the Burg, its pride; and with the Opera, its enjoyment), wrote the editor Rudolf Kalmar. The bombs had struck a central medium of Austrian self-presentation. A culture which had always considered “theater” a political category had to manage for over ten years without a national stage.\n\nIn this traumatic situation, all efforts were devoted to constructing a continuity that could conceal this break. When the Burgtheater and the Opera reopened on 15 October and 2 November 1955 respectively, it became clear that the renewal of the Austrian stage was not to include any reflection on how and why it had been destroyed. Not only did the restored state theaters open their doors, but on 26 October 1955, later proclaimed a national holiday, the State Treaty was signed. What was being celebrated was not liberation from Nazi rule, nor the establishment of democratic structures, but the quasi-natural return of Old Austria. “Als das Burgtheater zu spielen begann, hat sozusagen das Herz Österreichs wieder den ersten Schlag getan und den ganzen Kreislauf der Empfindungen bewegt, der uns wieder das richtige Bewußtsein von uns selbst und den Glauben an unsere Zukunft gegeben hat” (When the Burgtheater resumed its performances, Austria's heart began to beat anew, sending emotions through our veins, restoring our proper self-awareness and our faith in our future), wrote Friedrich Schreyvogl, who had vigorously promoted Austria's absorption into Nazi Germany and was from 1954 to 1961 deputy director of the Burgtheater. As the ruins of the state theaters were rebuilt, the self-image of an injured theatrical nation was given cosmetic treatment. In relation to the theater, as elsewhere, the past evoked not the period of collaboration with National Socialism, but a fantasy of theatrical culture under the Habsburgs.\n\nGERMANY's ANNEXATION OF AUSTRIA in 1938 destroyed the flourishing literary culture of interwar Austria almost overnight. Among the émigrés from Nazism were many of the most eminent literary figures of the age, and remarkably few of the exiled Austrian writers returned after 1945. This offered, as film-maker and writer Ruth Beckermann puts it, “an opportunity for the mediocre, those who stayed behind, to attain honor and glory.” The charge of mediocrity, though apposite, conceals another characteristic of those who stayed behind, namely the fact that many of them had co-operated to a greater or lesser degree with the National Socialists. The opportunity for such writers to attain “honor and glory” depended not solely on the absence of returning exiles but on a favorable cultural climate arising from developments within the wider fields of politics and cultural politics.\n\nAustrian self-understanding in the postwar decades was characterized by what has been aptly dubbed double-talk. The thesis that Austria had been the first victim of Hitlerite aggression insisted that Germans, not Austrians, were responsible for the War and the Holocaust, while domestic politics both tacitly acknowledged the fact that Nazi sympathies and willing participation in the Wehrmacht were widespread phenomena, and rehabilitated the vast majority of those who had been involved. A similar phenomenon can be seen at a microcosmic level in the re-emergence of literary culture. Although the PEN Club had enshrined anti-fascism as one of its humanitarian principles, the Vienna PEN Center — re-established in 1947 — largely failed to exclude writers who had collaborated with the Nazis. A Literaturreinigungsgesetz (Purification of Literature Act) was passed by parliament but never implemented, while the Education Ministry's list of banned authors contained, in 1948, just six names. The institution of literary prizes tended to further the rehabilitation of those who had remained in Austria between 1938 and 1945. Throughout the 1950s, numerous prominent writers of a nationalist bent, who had begun their careers under the Ständestaat (corporate state) received Austria's major literary awards. The situation was exacerbated by continuities in cultural policy and the cultural bureaucracy, which ensured that the state support available to writers tended to go to the same names as had benefited before and during Nazi rule.\n\nGIBT ES EINE ÖSTERREICHISCHE LITERATUR?” — Is there such a thing as Austrian literature? This question, posed for a survey in 1936, was famously answered in the affirmative by Thomas Mann: “Die spezifische Besonderheit der österreichischen Literatur ist zwar nicht leicht zu bestimmen, aber jeder empfindet sie” (The specific particularity of Austrian literature is not easy to define, but everyone perceives it). The vagueness of Mann's response was not designed to lay this question to rest, and it has become a standard point of departure for reflections on Austrian literary identity. In 1976, exile writer Hilde Spiel used Mann's answer as the starting point for a history of postwar Austrian literature, and in 1995 the novelist and poet Julian Schutting asked the question afresh in his contribution to a literary anthology on Austrian literature. The parameters of the question are clear: at issue is the relationship between Austrian literature and the “German literature” that ambiguously refers both to the literature produced by the larger neighbor and to all literature written in the German language.\n\nThe question of Austrian literature's identity is of interest not because it promises a stable definition of the characteristics of the country's national literature by means of robustly defensible criteria, but because it casts the spotlight on interactions between the country's literature, its linguistic identity, its cultural constellations, and the political developments that shape a continuously changing public sphere. Moreover, the introduction to this volume ought to provide the reader with some discussion of the question even if it fails to deliver a definitive answer. For the essays in this book cover ground that has already received attention in Ingo R. Stoehr's German Literature of the Twentieth Century: From Aestheticism to Postmodernism (2001), the final part of the Camden House History of German Literature. Stoehr examines literature written in the German language in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The present volume complements his wider perspective with a closer look at the continuities and tensions of a literature that has derived strength both from its integration in the community of German speakers, and from its specific national and cultural identity.\n\nIN 1895, THE MUSEUM DER VOLKSKUNDE (Museum of Folklore) was established in Vienna, a year after the constitution of the Verein für Volkskunde (Association for Folklore), which sought to understand a particular form of popular culture — traditional folk culture — from the vantage point of historical anthropology. Programmatically, the first issue of the association's journal, Die österreichische Zeitschrift für Volkskunde (The Austrian Journal of Folklore), included articles by Richard von Kralik titled “Zur österreichischen Sagenkunde” (The Study of Austrian Legend and Myth”) and Alois Riegl titled “Das Volksmäßige und die Gegenwart” (The Folkish and the Present). The whole undertaking was essentially an exercise in documenting the traditional folk culture of the Habsburg Monarchy, but it was being carried out in a period that was witnessing significant sociocultural change as industrialization brought about large-scale migration from the countryside, the location and object of these ethnographical studies, to the city. While academics devoted their attention to one form of popular culture, a different manifestation of that culture was gaining in importance. The twin processes of industrialization and urbanization brought in their wake a new form of popular culture, mass commercial culture, which developed as a result of new technological possibilities coupled with the people's experience of living in rapidly expanding cities. The First World War and the subsequent dissolution of the Habsburg Monarchy served merely to intensify this dynamic; after 1918, particularly in Vienna, mass commercial culture appeared as the dominant form of popular culture. This development was, however, not without its critics and challengers.\n\nOld and New Cultural Forms\n\nThe roots of mass commercial culture in Austria extend back into the nineteenth century and can be found in popular theater and variety theater, as well as in the “illusory world” of the Prater. The latter, in particular, often appears in Austrian literature of the first decades of the twentieth century, functioning as an alternative to the bourgeois world of high culture. After the First World War into the 1930s, the Prater remained a prime location of popular culture, home to a permanent amusement park, as well as a large number of circuses and variety theaters.\n\nTHE PHYSICAL AND TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES of Austria may not have changed since the end of the Second World War and the founding of the Second Republic, but Austria's geopolitical significance, its demographic makeup, and its citizens’ understanding of Austrian nationhood have all changed significantly over the last few decades. Austria's internal social and political fabric is altering too, with a move away from the old consensus-based social partnership model towards a pattern of non-interventionist free-market capitalism, modern technologies, international cooperation, and global financial interventions. Rudolf Burger posited that the entry of Austria into the European Union in 1995 brought to near completion Austria's status as a modern European nation. Furthermore, it canceled out both the “Ausschlußtrauma” and the “Anschlußtrauma” that characterized its relationship with Germany (exclusion from the German Reich formed in 1871, and annexation by Hitler's Germany in 1938). According to Burger, only Austria's obligation to remain militarily neutral stands in its way of obtaining full sovereignty as a nation.\n\nThe shock occasioned by the meteoric rise in popularity and election success of the extreme right-wing party the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (Liberal Party of Austria, FPÖ) in 1999 produced a huge wave of political self-reflection in Austria, both among the general population and in the books, interviews, essays, and works of literature of many of Austria's most high-profile writers and intellectuals. Most of these have been active in countering the nationalism propounded by some FPÖ politicians and likeminded Austrians. This nationalism is at best merely anti-immigrationist and at worst inherently racist, and it is a tendency that has been further fueled by the fear of increased migration to Austria from the EU's most recently added members. The European Union was so concerned about the FPÖ becoming a partner in the new ruling coalition of February 2000 that it placed diplomatic sanctions on Austria and commissioned a report on its government. Although a clean bill of health was finally returned, this was only based on an inspection of the theoretical position — the protection of minorities in law — and not on a detailed investigation of the realities of Austria's policies regarding ethnic minorities (Minderheitenpolitik).\n\n1927: The Defeat of Austrian Freedom\n\nON 15 JULY 1927, A DEMONSTRATION outside the Vienna Palace of Justice ended with corpses on the street and the building gutted by fire. It was a decisive moment in the chain of events leading to the suspension of parliamentary government in March 1933, the Civil War of February 1934, the assassination of Chancellor Dollfuss in July 1934 and the instant demise of the “state that nobody wanted” when Hitler's German troops marched in on 12 March 1938.\n\nThe effects of what Erich Fried dubbed “Bloody Friday” went far beyond the political sphere, highlighting the extent to which literature in Austria reflected (and refracted) these turbulent times. Writing as late as 1975, Manès Sperber claimed that the experience of July 1927 had never ceased being felt. Initially, the demonstration inspired Karl Kraus to a campaign against Johannes Schober, the Vienna police chief, whose men had fired on the crowd demonstrating against the acquittal of right-wing paramilitaries who had killed a child and a war veteran during a skirmish with Socialists. In Die Fackel, then in its twenty-eighth year, Kraus denounced the social system that made such atrocities possible, a religion that denied mercy and charity to the victims, a republic that pinned medals on the breast of murderers.\n\nFor Kraus's ambivalent devotee, the later Nobel Prize winner Elias Canetti, the fire at the Palace of Justice was crucial in the conception of the novel Die Blendung (Auto-da-Fé), first published in Vienna in 1936; for Heimito von Doderer it represented the “Cannae of Austrian freedom” (recalling the devastating defeat of the Romans by Hannibal at the battle of Cannae in 216 B.C.), and inspired the vast panoramic novel he finally published as Die Dämonen (The Demons) in 1956. Already completed in its first but unpublished draft in 1936, Doderer's novel is set largely in the Vienna of 1926–27 and culminates in a depiction of the chaos on 15 July. Shortly before publication of Die Dämonen, the State Treaty of 1955 had finalized the establishment of a Second Republic far more resilient than the First, whose end could already be anticipated when the flames leapt from the roof of the burning law courts.\n\nAUSTRIA's UNIQUE POLITICAL SITUATION in the first postwar decade did much to shape its popular culture of subsequent decades. The Moscow Declaration of the Allies (1943) viewed Austria as both a victim of Nazi aggression as well as a co-combatant with the Third Reich. As a result, Austria was occupied by the victorious Allies until 1955, but was nevertheless granted a large degree of autonomy through a federal government elected in November of 1945. In the first postwar decade this situation set the stage for a vibrant competition between indigenous cultural traditions and impulses from the foreign cultures represented by the Allied occupation forces. Officially absent from the Austrian cultural landscape at that time was a visible German presence, which was politically — and to a significant degree, culturally — “quarantined” from the land it had annexed in 1938. The Austrian writer Milo Dor spoke of a “paper curtain” between the two lands after 1945 that prevented the free flow of cultural information and artists. Despite censorship and travel restrictions, cultural contact between the two occupied nations slowly resumed to the extent that those Austrians who viewed their culture as distinct from that of Germany, saw cultural impulses from that nation as just one more foreign influence assaulting their beleaguered culture.\n\nOf all the foreign impulses affecting Austrian culture during the occupation, American and British influence had arguably the greatest impact, especially through the programming of the Allied radio networks — such as the American Red-White-Red and the British Alpenland networks — whose contemporary music and entertainment programming became immensely popular among Austrian youth. Although the Allies and Austrians shared many of the same traditions of high culture, they nevertheless diverged significantly with respect to popular culture. American cultural policies in Austria, for example, aimed at “reorienting” Austrian institutions such as radio and the press toward a more “democratic” approach to culture, that is, one more responsive to public taste and allowing for maximal public input and participation. By contrast, Austrian cultural policy of the postwar era, largely promulgated by the conservative Ministry of Education, saw culture as an edifying force that should shape public tastes rather than reflect them.\n\nIN THE DECADES FOLLOWING the Second World War widespread Austrian support for Austro-fascism and National Socialism as well as Austrian participation in the Nazi military and the actual degree to which Austrians had taken part in the Holocaust gradually came to light. It also became obvious that authoritarian attitudes, intolerance, racism, and chauvinism — the syndrome referred to in the 1970s as “everyday fascism” and described by Ingeborg Bachmann in Der Fall Franza (The Franza Case, published posthumously in 1981) and thematized by Elfriede Jelinek in Die Ausgesperrten (The Excluded, 1980) — had outlasted the Nazi system. The survival of old attitudes had been obvious since anti-Semitic demonstrations in 1947 in Austrian cities and the founding in 1948 of the Verband für Rückstellungsbetroffene protecting those who had benefited from the deportations that began soon after the Nazi takeover by acquiring under-priced property owned by Jews. In the 1970s and 1980s writers and critics explored lingering proto-fascist and anti-Semitic attitudes among the contemporaries of the Nazi era and realized that these patterns were perpetuated in the following generations in the absence of a legitimate public forum to express them. Latent anti-Semitism also persisted, though Vienna's small postwar Jewish community, consisting primarily of Displaced Persons, was considered only temporary, even by its members. In 1986, in the heat of the Waldheim election campaign, anti-Semitism in conjunction with anti-US sentiments regained a semblance of legitimacy. It was fostered by the invectives directed against the World Jewish Congress by the Austrian media, particularly the Kronen-Zeitung and the Kurier. Articles in these and other papers alleged or suggested that American Jews were engaging in an anti-Austrian conspiracy to topple the conservative presidential candidate and meddle in internal Austrian affairs.\n\nEven at the end of the twentieth century the trauma of the 1930s and 1940s was impossible to overcome, as the conservative People's Party (ÖVP) formed a coalition government with a successful extreme rightwing movement, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ). Along with the victory of populism, concerned critics continued the process of unraveling the events of the Nazi era. During that time of heightened uncertainty and polemics Austrian intellectuals were still — or once again — struggling to reach conclusive assessments of the cataclysmic social and political changes of the years between 1938 and 1945.\n\nAUSTRIA WAS LIBERATED FROM German occupation in May of 1945. By July of that year, while cities such as Vienna were still struggling with the ravages brought about by the fierce defense of the Reich's eastern borders, and some 34,000 Austrians had been killed in air-raids alone, the debate on the future and the function of literature in postwar Austria was already receiving considerable attention from Austrians of all political persuasions. Immediately after the war Viktor Matejka had become head of Vienna's Department for Culture and Adult Education. He had been interned in Dachau by the National Socialists and was to emerge alongside Ernst Fischer as one of the best known of the Austrian Communists in the early postwar period. On 25 July 1945 Matejka gave a lecture in Vienna entitled “Was ist österreichische Kultur?” (What is Austrian Culture?), in which he rejected as a point of contact any of the many fateful dates in Austria's history, including the emergence of the First Republic following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War, or the Austria immediately before the Nazi occupation:\n\nMögen große Teile unseres Volkes Kultur rein sentimental als Erbe auffassen, wir sehen hier eine Aufgabe, die auf einem Ruinenfeld noch dringlicher geworden ist […]. Es gibt daher kein Zurück auf 1789 oder 1848 oder 1918 oder 1934 oder gar 1938. Wir müssen uns unsere Kulturwelt selbst bauen.\n\n[Even if large parts of the population regard culture in purely emotional terms as something inherited, we see here a challenge that has become more urgent, set, as it is, amidst a sea of destruction … For this reason there will be no going back to 1789 or 1848 or 1918 or 1934, let alone 1938. We must be the constructors of our own cultural world.]\n\nRemarkably similar in both content and tone was a speech delivered before the Austrian Parliament by another former inmate of Dachau, Leopold Figl; on 21 December 1945, a day after he had become the conservative chancellor of the first freely elected postwar Austrian government, he declared:\n\nDas Österreich von morgen wird ein neues, ein revolutionäres Österreich sein. Es wird von Grund auf umgestaltet und weder eine Wiederholung von 1918 noch von 1933, noch eine von 1938 werden […] Wir wollen das neue, das junge Österreich!"
