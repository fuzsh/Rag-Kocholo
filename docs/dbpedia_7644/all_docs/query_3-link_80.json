        "text": "This paper focuses on the transnationalisation of literary fields that has been taking place since the emergence of literature by migrant writers. This development occurred earlier in some national contexts and later in others. Independent of the historical evolution, however, the presence of migrant authors and their writings caused major changes in literary fields: authors have different cultural and linguistic backgrounds than the majority of their readers, the texts are set in faraway places; thus, also literary critics and scholars start to look into new topics and regions and readers are eventually confronted with new worlds. Consequently, transnationalisation also has political implications. However, it has not encompassed all aspects of the literary field. In fact, the individual and different histories of literature and migration in various national contexts show that the national frame is still a powerful and influential aspect. This paper discusses two examples-Austria and Great Britain-of the described transnationalisation and examines the role still held by national frames in literary fields.\n\nBosnian-German writer Saša Stanišić’s debut novel, Wie der Soldat das Grammofon repariert (2006), is a transnational Bildungsroman that portrays a young male protagonist’s coming of age amidst the start of the Bosnian War and his family’s decision to seek refuge in Germany. Yet, despite the protagonist’s challenging circumstances, the author depicts tragedy through a comedic lens. Drawing on recent theories of narratology, multilingualism, migrant literature, trauma, humor, and popular culture, this article performs close readings of select passages to explore how Stanišić’s multilingual practice utilizes humor in order to narrate the protagonist’s development and his process of working through trauma."
