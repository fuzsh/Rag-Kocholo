        "text": "76-year-old bodybuilding icon Arnold Schwarzenegger is a living example of the American dream. Born in the village of Thal in Austria, Arnold Schwarzenegger grew up in poverty. However, the ambitious youngster developed a passion for bodybuilding and followed his dreams to America in 1968.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, Arnold Schwarzenegger embarked on a historic bodybuilding career. Schwarzenegger transformed himself from a young boy who came with nothing in his pockets to become a seven-time Mr. Olympia who helped bodybuilding become mainstream. Arnie’s impact on bodybuilding was immediate, and The Austrian Oak inspired bodybuilders across the globe, including his homeland.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger: From champion to inspiration\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger established himself as a bodybuilding star in Europe after moving to Berlin. Arnie’s fame skyrocketed after he won his first Mr. Universe while training at a gym in Germany. However, it wasn’t until he dethroned three-time Mr. Olympia Sergio Oliva that Arnie came into his own.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975, Arnold Schwarzenegger dominated the Olympia stage. Simultaneously, he appeared in several interviews and talk shows and actively promoted bodybuilding around the world. After 1975, Schwarzenegger promoted Mr. Olympia before returning to win the title again in 1980.\n\nDuring these ten years, Arnold Schwarzenegger had already inspired future champions. Even the 1983 Mr. Olympia Samir Bannout admitted to being inspired by Arnie. The Lebanese bodybuilder replicated Arnie’s poses onstage. During this time, the Austrian Oak inspired aspiring bodybuilders in his homeland, one of whom is still remembered today.\n\nIn the late 80s and early 90s, another bodybuilding star from Austria rose to prominence. Born in 1964, Andreas Munzer considered Arnold Schwarzenegger a massive inspiration. Munzer also stood out on stage for his incredible conditioning, becoming known as the most shredded bodybuilder in the world.\n\nMunzer also replicated Arnold Schwarzenegger on the bodybuilding stage. He eventually met his idol at the 1996 Arnold Classic. Unfortunately, Munzer’s bodybuilding dreams met an unexpected end when he passed away in March 1996, shortly after the Arnold Classic. However, Munzer was one of many.\n\nOver the years, Arnold Schwarzenegger has continued to inspire bodybuilders in his home country. While we are yet to get another Austrian Mr. Olympia, Arnie’s son Joseph Baena trains under Leo Mayrhofer, who hails from Austria. Today, Classic Physique competitors have kept the Golden Era look alive.\n\nAn inspiration to the old, new, and those yet to come\n\nAfter the Golden Era ended, Dorian Yates ushered in the mass monster era. However, even at the height of the mass monster era, eight-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman idolized Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ronnie Coleman has even gone on record to proclaim The Austrian Oak as the greatest bodybuilder of all time.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until the IFBB started the Classic Physique Division in 2016 that people understood just how many modern champions the seven-time Mr. Olympia continues to inspire. The Classic Physique division was established to bring back the Golden Era look to the Olympia stage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHowever, one can argue that today, Classic Physique is more popular among fans than the Mr. Olympia itself. Five-time Classic Physique champion Chris Bumstead has over 25 million followers on social media, far exceeding those of all who compete in the open division. Unsurprisingly, Schwarzenegger is one of Bumstead’s idols.\n\nHowever, two-time Classic Physique Olympia runner-up and former Arnold Classic Physique champion Ramon Dino is an even bigger fan of Schwarzenegger. Similarly, Wesley Vissers, the 2024 Arnold Classic Physique champion and perennial contender Urs Kalecinski, and many more idolize the 76-year-old.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nSo it’s safe to say that Arnold Schwarzenegger was, is, and will continue to be an inspiration for nearly every bodybuilding enthusiast. The Austrian Oak put the sport on the map and continues to push the boundaries. At the 2024 Arnold Classic, the 76-year-old bodybuilding legend announced a prize money increase.\n\nToday, the Arnold Classic co-founder’s mission is to increase how much professional bodybuilders earn. With his new mission, Schwarzenegger is shaping the future of the sport yet again, potentially setting off a chain reaction that boosts bodybuilding’s popularity across the globe."
