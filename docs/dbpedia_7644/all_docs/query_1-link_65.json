Head of the review board Noah Banes informs Larry that while the FDA denied human experimentation, the team has received a donation from geneticist Dr. Diana Reddin from the ovum cryogenics department.\n\nOfficer A: I don't know about that accent...\n\nOfficer B (dubbed by Schwarzenegger with his signature accent): We can fix it!"
