        "text": "Ditto accounts of excess and wild improbabilities. Enter Arnold Schwarzenegger, the boy with a dream who conquered the world. His journey took him from the backwoods of post-war Austria to governorship of California, the US state with the world’s seventh largest economy.\n\nAlong the way he became a record-breaking bodybuilding champion, a major Hollywood film star and, through marriage, a member of the Kennedy clan. Estimates of his wealth peak at $800million (£497million).\n\nDuring his film career in roles from Conan The Barbarian and The Terminator to Danny DeVito’s twin, Schwarzenegger, right, has played macho men and funny men. His number one rule is, “Turn your liabilities into assets”. Through sheer determination, this burly European with a 57in chest, a strong foreign accent and an unpronounceable name cashed in on qualities Hollywood agents told him “were all too weird”.\n\nSchwarzenegger's autobiography is a classic reworking of the American dream\n\nMatthew Dennison\n\nMidway he conquered a hereditary heart defect that threatened to derail his career as a major action hero.\n\nHis is a story of success and stubborn self-belief. In Total Recall, Schwarzenegger presents the former as the direct result of the latter. His autobiography is a classic reworking of the American dream: dream hard, work hard, aim high, let no one stand in your way. “The whole idea of a conventional existence was like Kryptonite to me,” he says.\n\nUltimately that unrelenting focus impacted on Schwarzenegger’s wife and family. The breakdown of his 25-year marriage to Maria Shriver was the result of revelations concerning a love child Arnie had concealed from his wife for years, partly through fear of her reaction, partly because, as he tells us, “Secrecy is part of me”.\n\nLike so many top Hollywood stars he is an outsider made good. Perhaps it is his awareness of this status and the insecurity that breeds which drives him so hard. Readers of Total Recall will marvel at that drive.\n\nIn his own version of himself, Schwarzenegger is someone who has never stood still. He describes himself as “relentless, disciplined, hands-on and street smart”. By the age of 10 he knew that his destiny did not lie in Austria, suffering after wartime defeat and trembling in the shadow of Soviet communism, but in the US. Despite playground teasing and the incredulity his conviction inspired among his peers, he never let go. At one level his story is stranger and more inspiring than any Hollywood film ever made.\n\nYet the Herculean force of his determination is also chilling. He has the strong man’s lack of sympathy with the weak and the successful man’s inability to understand any way but his own. Even in his political career, where every decision was submitted to committee, he seemed to struggle with compromise.\n\nL ike many people who have experienced being poor in their childhoods, his overriding aim was always to make money. It is not necessarily an attractive trait. When he sees his economics teacher in California driving a Volkswagen Beetle he comments, “I’d had better cars for years by that time. I said to myself, ‘Knowing it all is not really the answer, because this guy is not making the money to have a bigger car. He should be driving a Mercedes.’ ”\n\nNo autobiography is wholly truthful, even when it is subtitled “My unbelievably true life story”. Readers may or may not be aware of a degree of self-editing on the part of the Hollywood legend turned politician, known as The Governator.\n\nFans will revel in Arnie’s 600-page account. Others may feel this is a little too much of a good thing.\n\nSimon & Schuster, £20"
