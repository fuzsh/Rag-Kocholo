        "text": "Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life Written and Narrated by Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nPublished October 10, 2023 by Bolinda Publishing Pty Ltd – Bolinda audio\n\n4 Stars:\n\nAbout the Book: The seven rules to follow to realize your true purpose in life—distilled by Arnold Schwarzenegger from his own journey of ceaseless reinvention and extraordinary achievement, and available for absolutely anyone\n\nThe world’s greatest bodybuilder. The world’s highest-paid movie star. The leader of the world’s sixth-largest economy. That these are the same person sounds like the setup to a joke, but this is no joke. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger. And this did not happen by accident.\n\nArnold’s stratospheric success happened as part of a process. As the result of clear vision, big thinking, hard work, direct communication, resilient problem-solving, open-minded curiosity, and a commitment to giving back. All of it guided by the one lesson Arnold’s father hammered into him above be useful. As Arnold conquered every realm he entered, he kept his father’s adage close to his heart.\n\nWritten with his uniquely earnest, blunt, powerful voice, Be Useful takes readers on an inspirational tour through Arnold’s tool kit for a meaningful life. He shows us how to put those tools to work, in service of whatever fulfilling future we can dream up for ourselves. He brings his insights to vivid life with compelling personal stories, life-changing successes and life-threatening failures alike—some of them famous; some told here for the first time ever.\n\nToo many of us struggle to disconnect from our self-pity and connect to our purpose. At an early age, Arnold forged the mental tools to build the ladder out of the poverty and narrow-mindedness of his rural Austrian hometown, tools he used to add rung after rung from there. Now he shares that wisdom with all of us. As he puts it, no one is going to come rescue you—you only have yourself. The good news, it turns out, is that you are all you need.\n\nThis was an interesting book to listen to. It was not a memoir, although I did learn a lot about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s life, but more a self-help book, or one with a roadmap full of suggestions to achieve your goals. Born to a poor, struggling family in Austria, he rose to become the world’s greatest bodybuilder, one of the world’s highest-paid movie stars and the governor of California. He has a lot of advice to give, but he also recognizes his mistakes that caused difficulties in his life. I have always liked the quote, “you may not be able to control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to it.” That is Arnold’s philosophy. As a result of clear vision, big thinking, hard work, direct communication, resilient problem-solving, open-minded curiosity, and a commitment to giving back, he rose to success. All of it guided by the one lesson Arnold’s father hammered into him above be useful.\n\nI listened to this one, and enjoyed hearing this book in Arnold’s voice. As I said earlier, it isn’t necessarily a memoir, but is full of stories showing how he used the seven tools to achieve his goals. His early beginnings in the world of body building, gave him a place to develop his philosophy and use the tools. He talked about failing and learning from those mistakes to keep trying. He refers to this time in his life often, which I never really thought about. This would have been a great book for me during my working years, but I can still glean some advice from it. I loved listening to Arnold’s voice reading this one and sharing his stories, successes, triumphs and opportunities to try again, along with the tools he used to get there. If you are looking for a nonfiction audiobook that is part memoir, part self-help, then this might be just up your alley.\n\nI added this book to my TBR after reading a review on SECRET LIBRARY BOOK BLOG posted by Nicki. Check out her review HERE.\n\nThis year, I wanted to read some non-fiction books to help me study Advent and look at the Christian side of Christmas. Although one of these books had only a small part dedicated to Christmas, I liked both of these books and they left me thinking and contemplating the spiritual side of this holiday.\n\nChristmas in the Four Gospel Homes: An Advent Study by Cynthia M. Campbell\n\nPublished August 27th 2019 by Westminster John Knox Press\n\n4 Stars: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nChristmas in the Four Gospel Home is designed to be read over the four weeks of Advent. Each week, the book looks at one of the four gospels and how they tell the story of Jesus Birth. Each chapter begins with a picture of a house, designed by Kevin Burns, based on what is written in each gospel. I know the story of Christ’s birth as told in Luke. That is the one I use each year for our Christmas Pageant and to teach the story in Sunday School, so I really liked how each gospel is highlighted. We see not only different styles, but what the writer felt was the important bits to learn. From the story of Abraham and Sarah, Zacchariah and Elizabeth, John the Baptist, Ceasar Agustus and others, each gospel writer begins at a different time in history. I read this all the way through, but will also be using it as an Advent study. I will read the gospel highlighted each week, (I have already read Mark) and take the time to study their words and answer the questions found at the back of the book. This is definitely a good way to study the four gospels, at least from the beginning to the birth story.\n\nSacred Holidays: Less Chaos, More Jesus by Becky Kiser\n\nPublished October 16th 2018 by B&H Books\n\n4 Stars: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nWhen I selected this book to read, I thought it would have more Christmas than it does. This book takes all the holidays, ones we consider Christian and others and shares thoughts and ideas on how to destress and make them family friendly as well as interjecting our Christian beliefs and letting go of some secular customs that might detract from the holiday. This is a book that is part workbook, instructive and one that you can use in discussions with family and friends. The book begins with January celebrations right through to Christmas. It even includes birthday celebrations and Halloween. I really liked the emphasis on family activities and sharing. I would have made great use of this when my kids were young, had I read it then. This book will not be for everyone, but with Christmas approaching and if you are looking for a way to make this holiday more relaxing, family friendly, and to celebrate the real reason for the season, it’s not too late to pick it up."
