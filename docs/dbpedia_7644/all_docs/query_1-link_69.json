        "text": "He created a body that was to become the gold standard for muscular development. He would use it achieve one goal after another, rising to the very pinnacle of, not one, but three careers. Yet, from the very start Arnold Schwarzenegger had the odds stacked against him… He was dismissed, ridiculed and parodied mercilessly. What people failed to realize was that Arnold’s strongest muscle was, not his bicep, but his brain. With it he orchestrated career moves that took him to the very top.\n\n“For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.”\n\nArnold’s Early Life\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in the tiny Austrian village of Thal, near Graz on July 30th 1947. His father, Gustav was the local police chief. Arnold and his older brother, Meinhard, grew up under the tough discipline of a man who was used to being obeyed.\n\nGustav himself had been a champion ice curler in his younger years and he pushed his sons to excel physically. With his father’s pushing, Arnold first got into organized competitive sports at the age of ten. He played soccer passionately for almost five years.\n\nThat day would change Arnold’s life.\n\nHe was mesmerized by the size of the bodybuilders who stalked the gym, waging war with the steel weights. Arnold would later record his feelings in his 1977 autobiography Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder . . .\n\nThere it was before me – my life, the answer I’d been seeking. It clicked. It was something I suddenly just seemed to reach out and find, as if I’d been crossing a suspended bridge and finally stepped off onto solid ground.\n\nArnold embraced weight lifting. He soon discovered that he had an amazing ability to build muscle. Within two years he had already overtaken most of the other trainers at the gym in Graz where he worked out religiously. He also trained harder than anyone else. One Sunday, discovering that the gym was closed, he smashed the window to get in so that he could get in his workout.\n\nArnold’s father was less than impressed with his son’s new found obsession. Bodybuilding was very much a fringe sport in Austria at that time, with those who partook of it being look down upon and considered in some way defective. When it was discovered that Arnold had pictures of half naked men with bulging muscles on his bedroom wall, a psychiatrist was called in to ‘save’ Arnold from himself. The psychiatrist assured his parents that this was a phase that Arnold would grow out of.\n\nOh, how wrong he was.\n\nArmy Life\n\nArnold entered the Austrian army in 1965 to fulfill his obligatory one year of service. By now he’d built his body to 200 pounds of Herculean muscle. He was assigned as a driver in a tank unit. Shortly after he was inducted, Arnold received an invitation to compete in the junior division of the Mr. Europe contest in Stuttgart, Germany. But he was in the middle of basic training… No soldier was allowed to leave the base for any reason. But Arnold knew that his destiny was tied with winning this contest, so he decided to go AWOL in order to compete.\n\n“You have to fight for your fatherland. You have to take courage. Look at what Schwarzenegger did just to win this title.”\n\nFollowing his stint in the army, Arnold took a job as a gym instructor at a Health Club in Munich, Germany. This presented him with the ideal opportunity to train for the 1966 Mr. Europe competition. This was the next step in his master plan to become the best built man on the planet. He trained twice a day, working like a man possessed in order to forge the winning physique.\n\nBy the time he arrived in Stuttgart for the Mr. Europe contest, people were anxious to get a look at this “monster from Munich” who they’d heard rumors about. All of the attention infused Arnold with a great deal of confidence, and he already felt like the winner.\n\nArnold’s win that day was so emphatic that the judges offered to pay his way to the upcoming Mr. Universe contest. He arrived in London, knowing almost no English, but as soon as he stepped out of his cab, people began mobbing him. They had all been waiting for him – the first bodybuilder in Europe with 20-inch arms.\n\n“The best activities for your health are pumping and humping.”\n\nStill, he didn’t win that day. The American had a more complete, defined physique and he forced Arnold to accept second place.\n\nArnold returned to Munich and threw himself back into his training. He shut everything out of his mind and concentrated on only one thing – winning the 1967 Mr. Universe. Sure enough, on September 23rd, 1967 Arnold Schwarzenegger became, at 20 years of age, the youngest Mr. Universe in history.\n\nComing to America\n\nArnold arrived in America in September, 1968, with a gym bag, twenty US dollars and virtually no English. He settled into a small apartment in Venice Beach and was given a small stipend by Weider in exchange for the rights to use his image in magazines. Arnold’s plan was to stay in the USA for one year, absorb their training strategies and then use them to beat the Americans at their own game.\n\nArnold began training at a small gym at Venice Beach, Los Angeles called Gold’s Gym. He rubbed shoulders with all the top American bodybuilders but quickly established himself as the leader of the pack…\n\nIn 1970, Arnold won the coveted triple crown of bodybuilding: claiming the Mr. Universe, Mr. World, and the Mr. Olympia titles. He was now the undisputed king of bodybuilding.\n\nArnold went on to win 6 consecutive Mr. Olympia titles as he completely dominated the sport… Now he was ready to implement phase two of his master plan.\n\nActing\n\nIn 1970, Joe Weider got a call from a film production company looking for a bodybuilder to play Hercules in a low budget film. Weider immediately thought of Arnold, telling the producer that Arnie had been a Shakespearean actor back in Europe. They signed him up immediately.\n\nHis next paycheck took some time coming… Arnold found Hollywood less receptive than he had hoped. Several agents told him that he had everything going against him – he had a long name which was difficult to pronounce, a strange accent and, to top it off, an ‘unusual build which will never make it into films.’\n\nArnold began acting lessons in 1974. He won a supporting role in the Bob Raffelson movie Stay Hungry. He played a bodybuilder named Joe Santo, so it hardly stretched his acting talents. Still he was determined to make an impression.\n\nPumping Iron led to small roles in The Villain and The Jayne Mansfield Story.\n\nStrong Businessman\n\nBy now, Arnold was already a successful businessman, combining real estate investments, a best selling biography, and bodybuilding training courses. This meant that he could afford to wait for just the right film project. He filled his time with public appearances and social functions.\n\nOne such function was the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in Hyannisport. There he caught the eye of a beautiful dark haired girl by the name of Maria Shriver. She was the daughter of Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the niece of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\n\nArnold and Maria fell in love at first sight.\n\nIn 1979, Arnold began a career as a CBS sports commentator. He also graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a business degree. A year later, he stunned the bodybuilding world with his comeback at the Mr. Olympia competition in Australia. There he captured his 7th title, cementing his legendary status as the greatest bodybuilder of all time.\n\n“The worst thing I can be is the same as everybody else. I hate that.” Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold’s comeback, however, wasn’t without controversy. He went to Australia in the role of a TV reporter, only signing his name on the competitor register at the last minute. He was also good friends with head judge, bodybuilding legend Bill Pearl. The general consensus was that the Arnold on stage was a mere shadow of his former self. His victory was, for the first time, greeted by boo’s. Still, his 7th Mr. Olympia title was on the books.\n\nActing Breakthrough\n\nThe great shape that Arnold had got into for the 1980 Mr. Olympia propelled him into his breakthrough role as Conan the Barbarian. After spending a year in training working on his speech and learning how to use iron broadswords, he headed of to Yugoslavia and Spain for a grueling 6-month shoot.\n\nFollowing his success with the Conan movies, Arnold was offered a low budget movie by first time director and screenwriter James Cameron. This would prove to be his most iconic role.\n\nIn The Terminator, Arnold plays a cyborg sent back in time to kill the mother of the man who will save humankind from destruction. The role, it was made for Arnold. His accent and his body – the very things that the agents had said would work against him – were perfect to play the part of the T-800.\n\nThe honeymoon was barely over before Arnold flew to Mexico to film his latest action blockbuster, Predator. This movie again won him the title of action star of the year. After a string of action films – Commando, Raw Deal, Predator and The Running Man – the forward thinking Arnold was ready for a new challenge – and that, was comedy.\n\nFew were willing to take a gamble on Arnold the comic actor. But one who was was director Ivan Reitman, who created a special vehicle for Arnold. That vehicle was called Twins…\n\nOne person who noticed Arnold’s abilities on Kindergarten Cop – especially his rapport with children – was President George Bush. Bush appointed Arnold as the Chairman of the Presidents’ Council on Physical Fitness. This could have been a largely symbolic role, but Arnold threw himself into it with relish, visiting every state to promote the fitness lifestyle.\n\nThe movie winning streak continued for Arnold – with Total Recall, and Terminator 2. This sequel cost $102 million, making it the most expensive film to that date. It returned $519.8 million, with Arnie pocketing a cool $15 million.\n\nArnold’s next big movie outing was Last Action Hero, a hundred-million dollar extravaganza which seemed like a sure thing. But the film was a box office bomb, and a critical flop. Hollywood was quick to tear Arnie down, claiming that his time in the limelight was over. But Schwarzenegger had other ideas.\n\nGovernorship\n\nIn the mid-1990’s Arnold began focusing on giving back to the country that had given him so much. He became an organizer and sponsor of the Annual Inner City Games. He was also very involved in the After School Care program.\n\n“My fellow Americans, this is an amazing moment for me. To think that a once scrawny boy from Austria could grow up to become Governor of California and stand in Madison Square Garden to speak on behalf of the President of the United States that is an immigrant’s dream. It is the American dream.”\n\nIn 2003, during an appearance on the Jay Leno show, Arnold announced his candidacy for Governor of California. This was following the recall of Governor Gray Davis, sparked by the California electricity crisis. Arnold ran an energetic campaign, despite a smear campaign organized by the LA Times. A number of women claimed that, over the years, Arnold had molested them, while others claimed to have had affairs with him.\n\nHe easily won the Governorship and immediately set about cleaning house at Sacramento. Bringing his own unique style to the position he would constantly refer to his Democratic opposition as ‘girlie men.’\n\nArnold’s first term was marked by such early victories as repealing a vehicle license increase and stopping illegals from getting driver’s licenses. But then powerful state unions began to oppose his initiatives and four ballot measures he sponsored in a special election in 2005 were defeated.\n\nDespite this, Arnold was re-elected Governor in 2006 with 56% of the vote. On his second term he put a lot of effort in environmental issues. In 2006 he signed the Global Warming Solutions Act, making California the first state to put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nArnold’s second term as Governor came to an end in January, 2011. A few months later the LA Times ran a cover story reporting that Arnold had fathered a child fourteen years previously with the family’s long time maid. As a direct result of this revelation Arnold and Maria ended their 25-year marriage. She and their four children moved out of the family home in Brentwood.\n\nPost-Governorship\n\nArnold’s post Governorship movie career has seen him feature in such action flicks as The Expendables 2 & 3, Escape Plan, Sabotage and the fifth installment of Terminator in which he battles his younger self.\n\nArnold has continued to maintain strong ties to the bodybuilding world. Following his retirement from the sport in 1975, he promoted the Mr. Olympia competition. Then, in 1989, he and long time partner Jim Lorimer started the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic, which is now the second biggest Pro Bodybuilding Show, behind the Mr. Olympia.\n\nArnold credits all of his success to the self discipline, drive and focus that he learnt from his bodybuilding career.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger Video Biography"
