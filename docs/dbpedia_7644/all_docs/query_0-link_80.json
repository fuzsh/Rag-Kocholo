        "text": "Throughout one’s lifetime, it is not common that a journey one has pursued becomes a nationwide phenomenon; although, for two men, that was exactly the case. Chris McCandless and Adam Shepard both embarked new, difficult, although different journeys. McCandless embarked on a journey in search of self reliance whilst Shepard left everything to prove that the American Dream is in fact alive and well. These adventurers set out on divergent journeys, but both had a strong impact on society and those they encountered along the way. Although both of these men were hardworking and successful in what they did, it is evident that Shepard’s selfless journey to motivate people to pursue the American Dream had a greater purpose.\n\nBea Beau Chene Landscaping Case Study\n\n273 Words | 2 Pages\n\nEveryone wants to be successful and make goals become reality. Being successful and completing goals requires a commitment and constant remembrance of those goals. There are many different kinds of people in this world with many different kinds of thoughts. It takes a team and lots of thoughts, efforts, planning and decision making to become a successful organization. Successful is defined as accomplishing an aim or purpose.\n\nFormer U.S. National Security Advisor, Colin Powell, once said, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work”. Michael Jordan put in a great amount of effort and practice every day to become a famous basketball player. Tim Cook always worked harder than everyone else to become Apple’s CEO. Howard Schultz put in extra time and work to become the Starbucks CEO. Hard work and determination always lead to success.\n\nThomas talks about how Bob Herbert, in his essay, says the American Dream is over no matter how you define it, but Thomas thinks it “remains for those who would embrace it”.

He was once a Patriot, but he is now known as one of the most cowardly traitors of America. He won many significant battles for the Americans, but that does not mean that he is a hero.

Just like everyone, Siddhartha started by following his teachers and mentors. But as he became more experienced and formed his own opinions, he began to lead himself to his goal instead of following others. Although following in the footsteps of another to reach a goal is much more simple, Hesse uses characterization and figurative language (similes and metaphors) in order to show that people who lead themselves to their goal will gain more wisdom and knowledge than following another. As people, we are all prone to follow the easiest route to success, even though we might not achieve as much if we lead ourselves.\n\nJimmy Gatz The American Dream Analysis\n\n335 Words | 2 Pages\n\nDating back to the creation of the United States, the ‘American Dream’ represented one of America’s most defining characteristics.
