        "text": "Bodybuilding icon Arnold Schwarzenegger paid tribute to fellow Austrian sports legend Charly Kahr. The seven-time Mr. Olympia mourned the loss of the alpine skiing legend, ‘Downhill Charly‘. Kahr was a renowned skiing instructor and coach who led many skiers to podium finishes at the Olympic Games during the 70s and 80s.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger took to social media to write a heartfelt note for the late coach. “Charly Kahr was an Austrian skiing legend. Besides being a fantastic coach for the Austrian ski team, he was a great friend and ski instructor to me,” wrote the Austrian Oak. The note revealed that Arnie also learned under Kahr.\n\nWhile Arnold Schwarzenegger may be famous for helping make bodybuilding popular across the globe, he loves many sports. Skiing is one of his favorite pastimes during the winter months. Arnie has been skiing for decades and even considered himself a skilled skier. Now we know that it was Charly Kahr who helped him become a skilled skier.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“I will always cherish our memories of hiking and skiing the Alps. What a life! My thoughts are with his family,” wrote Arnold Schwarzenegger, reminiscing about the time they spent together. Ski Austria reported that Kahr had passed away on Saturday, April 27, at the age of 91.\n\nAlthough Charly Kahr is no more, his legacy lives on in the countless athletes he has helped and in the history books. During his time as the alpine skiing coach, the Austrian athletes under Downhill Charly won seven Olympic medals and thirteen Alpine Skiing World Cup titles. Kahr stopped coaching competitively in 1985.\n\n“I was a coach with heart and soul, I always wanted the best for everyone, including myself as a coach, and I did everything I could to make people successful,” Kahr had said on his 90th birthday, according to Ski Austria. With Charly Kahr’s passing, Arnold Schwarzenegger has lost yet another mentor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger never forgot his mentors\n\nThe bodybuilding icon takes every opportunity to thank the people who helped him become successful. It was no different in Charly Kahr’s case. While Arnold Schwarzenegger never competed in alpine skiing, he thanked his dear friend for teaching him the skill. Similarly, Arnie has never taken sole credit for his accomplishments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWhether it’s bodybuilding or acting, Arnold Schwarzenegger disliked being labeled as a “self-made” man. Last year, the Austrian Oak lost his first weightlifting trainer, Kurt Marnul, and thanked Marnul for showing him how to lift weights. So, from Jow Weider to James Cameron, Arnie has always credited others for his success.\n\nWhile Charlie Kahr stopped skiing at 25 due to a leg injury, he went on to become a legendary coach. Besides helping athletes win Olympic medals, Kahr, also helped Arnold Schwarzenegger fine-tune his beloved hobby of skiing. Along with Schwarzenegger, the entire sports world will now miss Downhill Charly."
