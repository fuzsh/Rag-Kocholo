Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.”\n\nArnold teaches us that it takes as much humility as determination to build strength. Read more of this champion’s story about pumping yourself up as you pursue your dreams—every one of them…\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger Life Story\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger describes his upbringing in post-WWII Austria as “uptight,” yet he credits this tough childhood for the strong ambition that he developed from an early age.\n\nBoth parents, poor and Catholic, were very strict, but Arnold’s father was brutal: a bitter Nazi member, police chief, and alcoholic, he did not spare Arnold any of his anger, and he even favored his older, more athletically endowed son.\n\nDespite the lack of parental support and his scrawny appearance, Arnold pursued sports with a relentless passion. His soccer training prepared him for what he saw as the ultimate athletic achievement, bodybuilding. Arnold dreamed of joining the ranks of muscular winners as he hustled to make ends meet.\n\nStarting at the unusually young age of 15, Arnold took weightlifting to the extremes of what his body could do. He tracked his process with precision, writing down his reps in chalk on the wooden walls of his gym. Nothing could stand in the way of his goal, not even the army, which he deserted at the age of 18 to compete in his first major competition, Mr. Europa Junior. He had to spend two years in jail for going AWOL, but this setback didn’t slow him down; when he was 20 years old, he became the youngest Mr. Universe in history, won the title again the following year, and then went on to be the youngest Mr. Olympia at age 23.\n\nArnold’s athletic ambition opened another opportunity when a muscle entrepreneur sponsored his immigration to America. Having grown up on Hollywood films as a form of escape, Schwarzenegger saw himself making the American Dream his own— if he could only get there.\n\nAfter moving to the U.S., he not only continued his winning streak, picking up 12 more titles, but also brought attention to the sport, helping to bring bodybuilding into the mainstream with his story of triumph.\n\nIt took a few tries, but Arnold finally put his competitive training aside to pursue another dream: becoming a Hollywood film star, just like those fantastic images that filled his head as a poor boy in Austria.\n\nGet Your Guide For Free\n\nHe appeared in several low-budget films until finally getting his break in Stay Hungry, which earned him a Golden Globe for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture. This acclaim paved the way for his memorable cult films, such as the Conan and Terminator series.\n\nWith all his proven success in action movies, Schwarzenegger tested his versatility, starring in comedies and family-friendly films as well. His acting career spans 40 years, dozens of films, and remains true to his catchphrase, “I’ll be back”: Arnold returns to the screen in 2 films coming out in 2017.\n\nLoving America from the time it was a fantasy in his head, Arnold wanted to serve his country–not just as a citizen (which he became in 1983). He stepped away from his prolific film career in 2003 to enter the race for governor of California, and despite the odds against a foreign-born athlete-turned-actor candidate, he won in a special election.\n\nGovernor Schwarzenegger struggled to help California recover from a budgetary disaster. He was re-elected in 2006 because, even as a Republican working with a mostly Democratic legislature, he was able to get enough policies in place before the recession set in, making his agenda nearly impossible. By the time he left office, his approval rating had plummeted from 65 to 23, and California’s debt was three times larger. Arnold’s response to this disappointment is to focus on the “enormous amount of things [he got] done.”\n\nSomehow, at almost 70, Arnold manages to juggle his multiple accomplishments. He still keeps up his training at Gold’s Gym, still stars in a variety of roles, and still gives his time and money to the causes he supports. He is a predominant environmental activist and investor in climate solutions and innovation, and he started a policy center, through which he continues to generate ideas for improving his state and to advocate for education, immigration reform, and water management, among other issues.\n\nAnd he shows no signs of stopping any one of his pursuits. That’s one of the lessons that stands out in Arnold’s story: to live fully, you can’t allow yourself to be pigeon-holed on one path, or to peak in one climb to achievement. You never know how one dream may lead to another inspiration or a set of challenges requiring creative solutions and committed energy.\n\nWhat we also learn from Arnold’s rise to greatness is that strength comes from struggle. If young Arnie had not felt trapped in his circumstances, we may never have thrown himself wholeheartedly into his vision of building himself up into the youngest world champion in his sport, moving to America, and becoming a Hollywood film star. There would be no “Governator” or celebrity activist if Arnold had not responded to the challenges facing his state and the planet, because he is inspired by difficulties to find ways to get things done. This is what winning looks like.\n\nPhoto by: Gage Skidmore\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger Short Biography\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-American actor, filmmaker, businessman, and former professional bodybuilder and politician.

His bodybuilding legacy and success as an actor contributed to his popularity and recognition in this new role. He advocated for fitness and health initiatives while in office. Arnold's achievements in bodybuilding, acting, and politics solidified his place as an influential and multifaceted public figure.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger Acting Highlights\n\nEarly Roles\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's journey from bodybuilding to acting began with his role in \"Hercules in New York\" (1970), where he was credited as \"Arnold Strong.\" However, his thick accent led to his lines being dubbed after filming. He faced initial challenges due to his unique physique and accent, but eventually gained recognition for his performance in \"Stay Hungry\" (1976), winning the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. Despite being told that he had no chance, Schwarzenegger persevered in his pursuit of an acting career.\n\nAction Superstar\n\nSchwarzenegger's breakthrough came with \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982), followed by a sequel and the iconic role of the Terminator in James Cameron's \"The Terminator\" (1984). He capitalized on the 1980s' demand for action films and competed with Sylvester Stallone in a rivalry that saw them challenging each other on-screen. Schwarzenegger's roles stood out for their humor and character, distinguishing him from more serious action stars. He starred in successful films like \"Commando\" (1985), \"Predator\" (1987), and \"Twins\" (1988). His commercial peak came with \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991).\n\nTransition and Decline\n\nSchwarzenegger's later roles included a diverse range of films such as \"Total Recall\" (1990), \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), and \"True Lies\" (1994). He took a brief foray into directing and saw mixed success in various projects. Following his return as the Terminator in \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" (2003), he faced challenges in his film career, with critical failures like \"Batman & Robin\" (1997) impacting his box office prominence. Despite this, he continued to star in movies like \"End of Days\" (1999) and \"Collateral Damage\" (2002).\n\nRetirement and Return\n\nAfter becoming the Governor of California, Schwarzenegger's film appearances were sporadic, including brief cameos and voice roles. He made a comeback with \"The Expendables 2\" (2012) and starred in \"The Last Stand\" (2013), \"Escape Plan\" (2013), and \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015). He also explored other ventures, such as a proposed Terminator statue and a comic book character collaboration. In 2018, he announced his involvement in the TV series \"Outrider.\"\n\nThe Celebrity Apprentice\n\nSchwarzenegger stepped into the role of host for \"The New Celebrity Apprentice\" (2016–2017), succeeding Donald Trump. Using catchphrases from his famous roles, he engaged in a humorous exchange with Trump. However, following criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced his departure from the show and exchanged playful remarks with Trump on social media.\n\nReturn to Acting and Later Projects\n\nSchwarzenegger made a return to the Terminator franchise with \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" (2019) and worked on various projects, including a scripted TV series titled \"Outrider.\" He continued to demonstrate his versatility as an actor, showcasing a dynamic career that spanned multiple decades and encompassed action, comedy, drama, and even TV hosting.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger Politics Highlights\n\nEarly Politics\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, known for his iconic roles in Hollywood, also has a notable political journey. He began his political involvement as a registered Republican with views that diverged from the left-leaning Hollywood community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger explained his Republican alignment, stemming from his distaste for the socialist rhetoric he heard from Democrats in the 1960s. He reminisced about his arrival in the United States in 1968, mentioning how he was drawn to Republican ideals such as free enterprise, limited government, lower taxes, and a strong military, which led him to adopt the Republican party.\n\nEarly Engagements\n\nSchwarzenegger's early political engagements included appearances in anti-drug campaigns during the Reagan administration and his introduction of the PBS series \"Free to Choose\" in 1990, where he advocated for individualism and free-market capitalism. He served as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports from 1990 to 1993 and championed causes related to health and fitness. However, his political ambitions became more apparent in 2003 when he announced his candidacy in the California recall election for Governor. He campaigned with the nickname \"Governator\" due to his association with the Terminator movies.\n\nGovernorship and Political Positions\n\nSchwarzenegger was elected as the Governor of California in the 2003 recall election, succeeding Gray Davis. He positioned himself as a moderate Republican with fiscally conservative and socially liberal views. He supported gay rights, domestic partnerships, and even officiated a same-sex marriage. However, he vetoed bills aiming to legalize same-sex marriage and implement a single-payer healthcare system. During his time as governor, Schwarzenegger aimed to address political gridlock and introduced the term \"girlie men\" to criticize Democratic politicians.\n\nChallenges and Re-election\n\nSchwarzenegger's early successes included repealing unpopular vehicle registration fee increases and opposing driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. However, he faced backlash from state unions and experienced defeats in a special election he called in 2005. Despite these challenges, he was re-elected in 2006 with a more moderate approach, even winning over some Democrats due to his shifting political stance towards the center.\n\nControversies and Environmental Advocacy\n\nSchwarzenegger's tenure was not without controversy. He faced allegations of sexual misconduct from several women during his initial campaign for governor, for which he later apologized. He also commuted the sentence of a close friend's son, sparking criticism. On a positive note, he demonstrated a commitment to environmental issues by signing the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, introducing carbon emission reduction initiatives, and advocating for sustainable energy solutions.\n\nLegacy and Impact\n\nDespite leaving office with lower approval ratings, Schwarzenegger's impact on California politics and his advocacy for climate change remain noteworthy. He continued his involvement in environmental causes after his governorship, establishing initiatives like the R20 Regions of Climate Action and the Austrian World Summit. While his political journey was marked by successes, challenges, and controversies, Schwarzenegger's transition from Hollywood action hero to political figure left an indelible mark on both realms.\n\nWhat is Arnold Schwarzenegger's ethnicity?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's ethnicity is Austrian.
