Carl Gottlieb, born on March 18, 1938, is a multifaceted American talent, known for his roles as a screenwriter, actor, comedian, and executive. His most notable contributions include co-writing the screenplay for the iconic film Jaws (1975) and its initial sequels, along with directing the 1981 movie Caveman.

Born into a middle-class Jewish family in New York City to Elizabeth and Sergius M. Gottlieb, Carl embarked on his journey in drama at Syracuse University, where he forged a friendship with character actor Larry Hankin. Following graduation, he served in the Army's Special Services division from 1961 to 1963 before transitioning into the realm of comedy. In the late 1960s, he became a member of the renowned San Francisco improvisational comedy group "The Committee," which produced the feature film A Session with the Committee.

Gottlieb's comedic prowess extended to television, where he made notable contributions to shows like The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, earning an Emmy Award in 1969. His on-screen appearances included roles in productions like Robert Altman's MAS*H and the film Clueless. Additionally, he co-authored David Crosby's autobiographies Long Time Gone (1989) and Since Then (2006).

His involvement in Jaws began with an acting role in the film, but his creative influence expanded as he was enlisted by his friend Steven Spielberg to enhance the script, infusing it with more depth and humor. He chronicled the tumultuous production of Jaws in his book The Jaws Log. Gottlieb's collaboration with the Jaws franchise extended to sequels like Jaws 2 and Jaws 3-D, as well as various related activities and events.

Beyond his contributions to the entertainment industry, Gottlieb demonstrated a commitment to serving fellow writers, actively engaging in Writers Guild of America politics. He served on the Board of Directors, including two terms as vice-president, and held the position of secretary-treasurer of the Writers Guild of America, West.
