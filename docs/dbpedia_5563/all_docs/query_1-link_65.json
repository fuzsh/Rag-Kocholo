Thank you so much.\n\nAdolf was conscripted into the Russian army January 4, 1914, Selma was born that June, and Ida and the 4 children had to \"flee from home\" on Feb. 9, 1916.\n\nFortunately, Ida wrote dates and events in her family Bible, unfortuately, its in German. Their story is quite amazing, and my Uncle Erich said in an interview, that they made it out just in time, 24 hours later and they wouldn't have been able to leave.\n\nCould I have your permission to use your information on Romansdorf to fill out the background on their story?\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I live in Merrill, WI, and as many Wisconsonites we will be escaping the cold for the month of March.\n\nMy email is jjbloechl@verizon.net.\n\nThank you again for the website and all the information .\n\nJerri\n\nMore About A\n\nDOLPH LENZ:\n\nBaptism: Jacobine Wittlief gb Spitzer\n\nChristening: December 21, 1885\n\nChildren of A\n\nDOLPH LENZ and IDA HERTER are:\n\ni.
