Bruss, 54, In Hospital With Fractured Leg and Paralyzed Arm As Result, Accident Saved from being ground to death in the hopper of the pit, at the Maribel Sand and Gravel Co. at Maribel by the prompt action of his fellow workmen, who shut off the power to stop the machinery as he was being borne down the conveyor, Herman Bruss, 54, is a patient at the Holy Family hospital here today, suffering from a compound fracture of his left leg and paralysis of his right arm as a result of the accident. The accident happened at 2:30 oclock this morning, as the regular shift at the Maribel pit which consists of about a dozen hands, were at their regular labor. Bruss was engaged with a pick in loosening the material that was sent down the runway into the loading hopper where the material is ground up before being loaded into trucks. Shouts For Help. In some manner that could not be explained either by Bruss or his companions, he was caught under a pile of material and carried along on the runway toward the hopper. In imminent danger of being swept into the hopper to what would have almost certain death and partially covered with the cavein of material Bruss shouted for help. While one of his fellow workmen shut down the machinery others ran to his aid and dug him from the pile of stone and gravel. As soon as Bruss was freed from his position he was taken to the office of Dr. May at Maribel, who after a hasty examination ordered that the injured man be removed to the hospital here at once. Examination here showed that Bruss had suffered a compound fracture of the left leg and his right arm was paralyzed and he could not use the member. Dr. May stated today that Bruss, who is single and resides on a rural route out of Maribel, would recover from his injuries unless complications set in.

The teamster got off his load quickly, went to where Mr. Bruss had fallen and raised him up to a sitting posture, when Mr. Bruss gasped once or twice and expired. The Coroners inquest, which was called as soon as the accident became know, decided unanimously, the Mr. Bruss came to his death by falling off his wagon and breaking his neck.
