        "text": "Prologue\n\nIn the October 2001, Felicia Bellman Tucker of Pensacola and Nancy Bellman McMillan of Mobile, granddaughters of Joseph Ralph Bellman (1870-1952), a native of Ocean Springs, and Elizabeth Missouri New Bellman (1876-1949), crossed the Atlantic in search of their Bellmann* roots. They spent two weeks in the northern Germany cities of Plön, Kiel, Schleswig, and Hamburg. Here the sisters met with German genealogists and historians who led them to their long desired dream of finding the parents and birthplace of Charles F.N. Bellman (1806-1868), progenitor of their Bellman family in America, and a pioneer settler of Biloxi. Their very successful journey and results are to be lauded and appreciated by all who seek knowledge of our romantic, but often-elusive past.\n\n*The original spelling of the family name in Germany, which is now spelled Bellman in America.\n\nFelicia Bellman Tucker\n\nThe following is a brief description of the journey to Germany by Felicia B. Tucker and Nancy B. McMillan. Felicia B. Tucker wrote it for this article.\n\nWe arrived in Hamburg and were met by my genealogical advisor, Kay-Uwe Gottorf and his wife. We were driven to Plön where we stayed in a quaint hotel on a lake. Plön is the town where Kay-Uwe Gottorf lives and he was going to be the one to help us get around Germany while we were there. The next morning he and his wife picked us up at the hotel and we drove to Schleswig where we were greeted by Mr. Thorsten Dahl, the spokesman for the Mayor. Mr. Thorsten Dahl was elected Mayor a few days after we left. Also Dr. Antje Wendt, the Doctor of History for Schleswig, told us all about our Bellmann ancestors, how they came to be in Schleswig to bring musical culture to that part of Germany by playing at the theatre for the opera. Dr. Wendt took us on a tour of the old part of Schleswig, which was originally a fishing village. We walked down the narrow cobblestone street to the St. Johannas Kloster where Carl Gottlieb Bellmann, Charles F.N. Bellman's father played the organ and wrote the anthem, \"The Song of Schlewig-Holstein\", with the help of a lawyer, M. F. Chimnitz. They arranged for a gentleman from the great church there to play on the same organ that Carl Gottlieb Bellmann had played the anthem that he wrote. The organ had been refurbished a few years before we went there. There is a statue to Carl Gottlieb Bellmann and Mr. Chimnitz in the park where they have a music festival every year. The song they wrote was written to prompt the citizens to rebel against Denmark so this part of the country could return again to Germany. We saw the house where Carl Gottlieb Bellmann and his wife lived and the house where Charles F.N. Bellman, our direct ancestor, was born. We traveled to Kiel via train to do some sight seeing and were shown around by a student that I had become acquainted with through my genealogical research. Kiel is where Charles F.N. Bellman's brother and sister taught music and had been proprietors of a music store. I could go on and on about our fascinating journey but I won't. I also have some really good photographs of the organ, statue, etc. It was a very eventful trip and so special. The German people went out of their way to tell us everything they could about our Bellmann family. They did not know that their famous musician, Carl Gottlieb Bellmann, had any descendants, as his other children never had any offspring.\n\nIn addition to the knowledge that Felicia Bellman Tucker and Nancy Bellman McMillan have provided for Bellman family genealogists, the author would be severely remiss for not lauding the exhaustive research and publications of Nap L. Cassibry II (1918-2002). Cassibry's Magnus opus, The Ladner Odyssey (1988), and Early Land Settlers and Land Grants at Biloxi (1986) are pregnant with detailed historical and genealogical data of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The latter work was particularly utilized in this essay.\n\nCharles F.N. Bellman\n\nThe progenitor of the Bellman family of Biloxi and Ocean Springs was Charles F.N. Bellman (1806-1868), an immigrant from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The name was spelled \"Bellmann\" in Germany. At least two other Ocean Springs families, Pabst and von Rosambeau, had their origins in this northern province of Germany, whose borders were often disputed with neighboring Denmark.\n\nCourtesy of Felicia Bellman Tucker\n\nCharles F.N. Bellman (1806-1868)\n\nCharles F.N. Bellman was born at Kiel, Germany on May 30, 1806, as Carl Friedrich Nicolai Bellmann, the son of Carl Gottilieb Bellmann (1772-1859+) and Friederica Christina Krause (1775-1860), the daughter of Otto Wilhelm Krause of Kiel. His birth was recorded in the Lutheran Church on June 7, 1806, at Schleswig-Friedrichberg. Carl G. Bellmann was a musician and composer from Muskau, in Saxony, now in eastern Germany. He was the composer of \"The Song of Schlewig- olstein\". Carl G. Bellmann and Miss Krause were married on December 9, 1800, in Schleswig-Friedrichberg. In addition to Charles F.N. Bellman, their other children were: Carl Adolph Eduard Bellmann, born November 10, 1801; Friederika Henriette Adolphine Bellmann, born May 25, 1803; and Carl Friedrich Fedor Bellmann, born December 29, 1811 and died May 29, 1874 in Kiel, Germany. (research of Felicia Bellman Tucker, March 14, 2002) Charles F.N. Bellman (1806-1868) was a pioneer settler of Biloxi, Mississippi. He arrived at Biloxi in 1835, and circa 1836, married Pauline Ryan (1815-1899), the daughter of Jacques Ryan (d. 1849) and Elizabeth LaForce (LaFauce). At Biloxi, Charles Bellman made his livelihood as a boarding house proprietor, druggist, and doctor. Bellman Avenue, which strikes north-south from East Beach Boulevard to Howard Avenue, in Biloxi is named for Charles F.N. Bellman.\n\nBellman children\n\nCharles F.N. Bellman and Pauline Ryan Bellman brought nine children into the 19th Century world: Theodora Bellman (1838-1901), married Louis L. \"Toon\" Ryan; Adolphine Bellman (1838-1893), married Moses Seymour (1838-1893); Charles W. Bellman (1841-1885), married Louisa Wilhemena Egan (1851-1881); Edwardine Bellman (1843-1921), married Benjamin F. Noel (1841-1910+); Harro Bellman (1847-1920) married Euphrosine \"Frazine\" Ryan (1852-1904); Bertha Bellman (1851-1932) married Ernest M. Beaugez (1862-1903); Ada Regina \"Lida\" Bellman (1854-1870+); Ralph Charles Bellman (1855-1899); and Pauline Josephine Bellman (1857-1933) married George W. McCary (1848-1925).\n\nJacques Ryan's Biloxi settlement\n\nCharles F.N. Bellman's father-in-law, Jacques Ryan, had settled at Biloxi in the early 19th Century and in July 1822, he acquired a large tract of land on the Pass of Biloxi from Jean-Baptiste Carco (d. 1823), the son of Nicolas Carco II and Catherine Ladner. Carco had been awarded a land grant of ten arpents, or approximately 160 acres, on the Biloxi peninsula from the King of Spain in 1790. The Carco land donation at Biloxi, preceded that of the Ladners, Fayards, and Dorsette Richard. (The American State Papers, 1994, p. 38)\n\nIn present day terms, the Carco land donation was bounded on the west by Lameuse Street and on the east by a line, which ran north 90 feet of Bellman Avenue. The Back Bay of Biloxi was the northern boundary of the Jean-Baptiste Carco land claim. (Cassibry II, 1986, p. 1 and p. 124) The Jacques Ryan tract on the Biloxi Channel opposite Deer Island, consisted of about forty-acres. It had a front on the Biloxi Channel of 2 and ¼ arpents, or about 432 feet, and ran north 30-40 arpents, or about 5760 feet to 7680 feet, to the Bay of Biloxi. Peter Dubuys was on the east and John Nixon claimed the western perimeter of the Jacques Ryan land at Biloxi. (HARCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 1, pp. 342-343)\n\nThe Charles F.N. Bellman family also resided on the shore of Biloxi Channel on a small plot of land, which Jacques Ryan had provided for them. The Bellman piece of land measured 100 feet in width by 120 feet in depth. From detailed maps drawn and dated by Charles F.N. Bellman and utilized in litigation in the Harrison County, Mississippi Chancery Court, it can be seen that many buildings occupied this small tract. Among these structures were: the Bellman home (1837), kitchen (1837), necrojars (1837), chicken house (1838), horse stable (1838), boarding house (1841), and ten pin alley (1843). (Cassibry II, 1986, pp. 129-131)\n\nFailure\n\nIn 1846, Charles F.N. Bellman's business failed. He was sued in 1848, for unpaid merchandise received from Curtius & Company, a New Orleans firm owned by George Lewis Curtius and F.W. Frendenthal. This litigation went against Bellman and as a result, he lost his land on the Biloxi Channel to these men to pay his debts. (Cassibry II, 1986, p. 126)\n\nSchooner Pauline\n\nIn 1853, C.F.N. Bellman and the Heirs of Jacques Ryan counter sued F.W. Frendenthal and the Estate of G.L. Curtius to have his land title at Biloxi returned and to be paid for the destruction and loss of his schooner, Pauline. Disclosure in this litigation revealed that Charles F.N. Bellman had leased this vessel to Hanson Alsbury for the shipment of slaves from Biloxi to the Balize on the Gulf outlet of the Mississippi River. Instead of depositing the slaves at the Balize, the Pauline continued to the port of Galveston, Republic of Texas. Here, the Pauline was taken into local custody and sold because she did not have registry to trade in a foreign port. (Cassibry II, 1986, p. 127)\n\nIt is interesting to note that Hanson Alsbury (ca 1805-1851+) was a resident of Ocean Springs, where he made his livelihood as a solicitor and land speculator. On February 2, 1837, he was issued a Federal land patent on Lot 4 of Section 30, T7S-R8W. Lot 4 runs from the Bay of Biloxi north 1320 feet and comprises approximately thirty-four acres. It includes the entire Biloxi Bay front from Weeks Bayou northwest to the mouth of the Ocean Springs Inner Harbor. There is some probability that Hanson Alsbury built the Anderson-Ashley structure on the present day Shearwater Pottery tract. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 63, pp. 35-36)\n\nIn addition, Hanson Alsbury possessed Lots 2, 3, and 5 of the Widow LaFontaine Claim, Section 37, T7S-R8W. He also owned large tracts of land at present day Biloxi (Section 20, T7S-R9W) and D' Iberville. In the early 1840s, at Back Bay, now D' Iberville, Alsbury operated a large brickyard with Colin McRae. This operation would later become the property of William G. Kendall (1812-1872), the Kentucky born lawyer and U.S. Postmaster of New Orleans, who bought land at Ocean Springs east of Alsbury in 1846. The Kendall property is now owned primarily by the descendants of the Dickey-White-Scharr family and the Estate of G.E. Arndt Jr.\n\nJudicial reversal\n\nIn 1853, it was adjudicated in litigation titled, Charles Bellman, et al v. F.W. Frendenthal, Executor of the Estate of George Lewis Curtius, et al, in the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi that Charles F.N. Bellman's Biloxi tract did not have proper title, as Jacques Ryan, his father-in-law, had issued no warranty deed to him. Bellman's efforts to recover his investment in the schooner, Pauline, was dismissed. A personal judgment was assessed against Mr. Bellman in favor of the defendants for past due accounts owed to the firm of Curtius & Company, a New Orleans business owned by George Lewis Curtius and F.W. Frendenthal. This judgment applied only to Bellman and not the land and improvements, as they were deemed the property of the Heirs of Jacques Ryan. (Cassibry II, 1986, pp. 126-136) Apothecary As mentioned Charles F.N. Bellman was a druggist.\n\nHe advertised in The Ocean Springs Gazette of March 24, 1855, as follows:\n\nC. Bellman & Co. Apothecaries & Druggists\n\nRecommend to the public their choice assortment of Drugs, Medicines, Lancets, Syringes, Watch Crystals, Perfumeries, and a chemical preparation called C. Bellman Healing Rock for the cure of all sores, wounds, and scratches on horses and mules. Doctor's receipts will, as usual be made up with all possible precision, neatness and dispatch. Medical advice can always be obtained at the East end of the Plank Walk. Biloxi, Miss.\n\nDivorce\n\nThe sacred union between Charles F.N. Bellman and Pauline Ryan ended in a civil divorce on May 29, 1860, in the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi. Pauline Ryan Bellman had sought a divorce from Charles F.N. Bellman because of his alleged extreme cruelty. Some of her testimony in this case revealed the following: Charles Bellman and I were married by a Catholic priest in Biloxi, circa 1836. The following children born of the marriage are alive: Theodora, a daughter, born in 1837; Adolphine, a daughter, born in 1839; Charles, a son, born in 1840; Edwardine, a daughter, born n 1842; Harro, a son, born in 1849; Bertha, a daughter, born in 1850; Lida, a daughter, born in 1851; Ralph, a son, born in1853; and Pauline, a daughter, born in 1858. In 1846, Charles Bellman was running a boarding house and drug store, but in that year of 1846, he went broke. The boarding house was torn down in 1846, and he continues at this time to run the drug store from our residence on a very small scale. (Cassibry II, 1986, pp. 137-138)\n\nIn the depositions of daughters, Theodora Bellman and Adolphine Bellman, the following was related:\n\nTheodora\n\nI am the oldest child and daughter of Charles and Pauline Bellman, and I teach school during the winter months. Some of the controversy here being adjudicated has to do with the treatment of me by my father. I am now going with and considering marriage with Mr. Gauthier, a widower with four children. My sister, Adolphine, is considering marriage with a Mr. Roose of New Orleans. My father, on every occasion, discouraged and was most insulting to every man that came to our home to call on the daughters. (Cassibry, 1986, pp. 138-139)\n\nAdolphine\n\nMy father has forbidden me to go to parties and balls with Emile Ladner, called \"Noon Gatto\", because Emile has been in a \"scrape\" with Irish Jane, also known as \"Red headed Jane\". (Cassibry, 1986, p. 137)\n\nIn his defense of cruelty charges against his spouse, Charles F.N. Bellman stated the following:\n\nHis wife for the most part communicates in the French language, which he does not speak or understand. She also impeded his efforts to teach his children. I came to Biloxi in 1835 and Pauline and I were married in Biloxi in 1837. We have nine children. I once ran a boarding house and mercantile establishment, but lost them in two long and costly lawsuits. I deny that I ever failed in business. I now run a small apothecary and drug store and I have been a medical practitioner. I have insisted that our children be educated by the best people available in Biloxi at the time. I, myself, have instructed them, purchased books, paper, and all the supplies necessary to continue their education. I instructed them every night and all are literate and well educated as compared with the people and times here.\n\nOcean Springs\n\nPrior to 1870, Pauline Ryan Bellman had left Biloxi and relocated to Ocean Springs. In the 1870 Federal Census of Jackson County, Mississippi, she was a housewife and head of household. Harro Bellman, Bertha Bellman, Ada Bellman, and Pauline Bellman were domiciled with her. Two of Mrs. Pauline Bellman's married children, Theodora Bellman Ryan (1838-1901), the wife of sailor, Louis L. \"Toon\" Ryan (1837-1909), and Charles W. Bellman (1841-1885), a laborer and the spouse of Almina Bellman (1851-1881), a native of Hanover, Germany, resided on each side of her.\n\nBellman-Schmidt Cottage\n\nThe Bellman-Schmidt Cottage is situated at present day 505 Jackson Avenue and now in the possession of Patrick Mitchell. It apparently once belonged to Pauline Ryan Bellman and the original land deed was destroyed in the last conflagration, March 1875, of the Jackson County Courthouse at Pascagoula. C.E. \"Uncle Ernie\" Schmidt (1904-1988), in his Ocean Springs French Beachhead (1972) states that: It is known that the Widow Bellman took in a few pupils at the old house still standing at the northwest corner of Jackson and Cleveland. One of her pupils, Laura Coyle, remembered years later that Mrs. Bellman excused the class so they could go to the railroad to see the first official train go through. That happened on October 29, 1870. (p. 67) Laura Coyle (1857-1931) was the daughter of Franco Coyle (1813-1891) and Magalene Ougatte Pons (1813-1904). In 1874, she married Charles Ernest Schmidt (1851-1886), commonly called, \"Handsome Charlie\", a native of New Orleans and of German ancestry. Laura C. Schmidt was the grandmother of local historian, C.E. \"Uncle Ernie\" Schmidt.\n\nTHEODORA BELLMAN RYAN\n\nTheodora Bellman (1837-1901) was born February 8, 1837 at Biloxi, the eldest child of Charles F.N. Bellman and Pauline Ryan. On December 24, 1874, she married Louis L. \"Toon\" Ryan (1837-1909), a local sailor and fisherman, and the son of Jerome Ryan (1793-1870+) and Marie Euphrosine LaFontaine (1802-ca. 1846), at the St. Alphonsus Catholic Church in Ocean Springs. (Lepre, 1991, p. 286) The children of Louis L. \"Toon\" Ryan and Theodora Bellman were: Theodora Genett Ryan (b. 1870) married Frank Thomas: Cora Ryan (1873-1934) married Robert J. Woodcock (1882-1919); Mabel Pauline Ryan (1874-1874); Lilly Ida Ryan (b. 1877) married Anthony Boyes; and Louis Ralph \"Boy\" Ryan (1880-1960) married Eva Peterson (1887-1964). As previously mentioned, Theodora taught school at Biloxi, during the winter months, before she married Toon Ryan. Her corporal remains and those of her husband lie in rest in the Bellande Cemetery in Ocean Springs. No further information. (Krohn, 1995, p. 1, p. 4, and p. 13)\n\nADOLPHINE BELLMAN SEYMOUR\n\nAdolphine Bellman (1839-1920) was born at Biloxi on August 15, 1839. She married Moses Seymour (1838-1893), the son of Jean-Baptiste Seymour (1811-1887) and Marie Fournier (1817-1890), who were the progenitors of the large Seymour family at Ocean Springs. Adolphine and Moses were the parents of: Edwin McLan Seymour (b. 1864); Isabella Seymour (1866-1928+) married Richard White (1849-1891); Norman A. Seymour (1868-1920+); Robert F. Seymour (1870-1939); Ernest Adolph Seymour (1875-1877), and Mamie Seymour (1883-1920+) married Frank Bourgh (Busch). (Lepre, 2001, pp 81-82) Jean- aptiste Seymour tract Moses Seymour was the first sibling of the family to acquire land in the J.B. Seymour tract at Ocean Springs from his parents. The J.B. Seymour tract was established on September 15, 1849, when Jean-Baptiste Seymour purchased a 13-acre parcel of land at Ocean Springs from Dr. Andrew B. Dodd (1806-1850+), a Kentucky born physician. The J.B. Seymour tract ran from Government Street to LaFontaine Avenue and was only 150 feet wide, except on its southern termination near present day LaFontaine Avenue, where it widened to 165 feet. Its western perimeter began 200 feet east of Dewey Avenue. The Jean-Baptise Seymour tract was originally a part of Andre Fournier's three arpent tract on the Bay of Biloxi and Bayou Bauzage (Inner Harbor) in Claim Section 37, T7S-R8W, the Widow LaFontaine claim. J.B. Seymour paid Dr. Dodd $11.54 per acre for this land. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 10, pp. 286-287)\n\nIn September 1877, Jean-Baptiste and Marie Fournier Seymour for $25, conveyed to Moses and his wife, Adolphine Bellman (1838-1920), a 300-foot deep lot on the south side of Porter Avenue near present day Minor Lane. It appears that the homestead of Jean- aptiste Seymour and Marie Fournier was also located on this tract. In July 1890, when Delmas Seymour sold a house for $35 to his brother, Moses, the deed concerning this structure read, \"a certain house built by me in Ocean Springs for the use of my mother during her life on the said Moses Seymour lot south of his residence on Porter Avenue\". Moses' demise From his obituary, it relates that Moses Seymour was a resident of Scranton (Pascagoula) at the time of his passing. In early January 1893, he expired suddenly, probably from a heart attack, at the L&N Depot in New Orleans as he waited for a train to return home. Moses was a well-known and financial successful, butcher. His body was sent to Ocean Springs for burial in the Bellande Cemetery. Adolphine lived until January 1920. Her corporal remains also lie in Ocean Springs on Dewey Avenue. (The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, January 13, 1893, p. 3)\n\nPascagoula Seymours\n\nSince Moses and Adolphine Bellman Seymour lived in the Scranton community, it was only natural for their children to do the same. In November 1891, in the Roman Catholic Church at Ocean Springs, their daughter, Isabella Seymour, married Richard L. White (1871-1928), a native of Ocean Springs, and the son of Englishman, Richard White (1849-1891), and Selena Sherman Hill White (1854- 919). (Lepre, 1991, p. 360) In 1900, Richard L. White made his living as a butcher. He and Isabella S. White were residing at Scranton with his son, Louis R. White (b. 1892), from a prior nuptial. Upon his death in late February 1928, Mr. White was survived by: five children; three brothers-John White, Frank White, and Harry Hill (1866-1915); three sisters-Mrs. Ralph Green, Mrs. Walter Weber, and Mrs. Lotta W. Catchot (1874-1954), the spouse of Francis \"Frank\" Catchot (1871-1943), the son of Arnaud Catchot (1834-1910) and Adele Ryan (b. 1844). (The Jackson County Times, March 3, 1928, p. 3)\n\nAt Pascagoula, Norman A. Seymour married and later divorced Condalaura Flechas (1872-1935), the daughter of Captain Joseph Flechas (1824-1883) and Condalaura Villar (1842-1908). Like his father, Moses, he made his livelihood as a butcher. Their family was composed of: Hilda Seymour Buffett (1897-1989), Mildred Seymour Pelham (1899-1961), Lois Seymour Tew (1901-1965), Hulbert Seymour (1903-1971), Norman Seymour (1905-1971), Blanche Seymour Spavin (b. 1908), and Bernard Seymour (b. 1910). (Lepre, 2001, pp 81-82) Robert F. Seymour also appears to have settled at Pascagoula. In 1900, he made his livelihood as a stevedore on the East Pascagoula waterfront. With Laura Tousell (1869- 909), a Louisiana lady of French parentage, he had five children: Edward M. Seymour (b. 1896), Martin Van Buren Seymour (1897-1897), Eugenie B. Seymour (b. 1898), Leo R. Seymour (1902-1934), and Clifton Seymour (b. 1903). Members of both these Seymour families are buried in the Greenwood Cemetery at Pascagoula. (Lepre, 2001, p. 82)\n\nCHARLES WHITEALL BELLMAN\n\nCharles W. Bellman (1841-1885), as previously mentioned, made the short relocation from Biloxi to Ocean Springs with his family, mother, and siblings.

Here at Ocean Springs, near the end of its \"Steamboat Days\", the Bellmans settled on Jackson Avenue near Cleveland. Charles W. Bellman made his livelihood as a laborer and carpenter.

Bellman (1872-1927)\n\nEagle Point Oyster Company Philip Bellman made his livelihood at Ocean Springs as a butcher prior to his employment with his father-in-law's organization, Narcisse Seymour & Sons, pioneer oyster packers and shippers. In late 1915, he became associated with Anton P. \"Tony\" Kotzum (1871-1916), the son of Joseph Kotzum (1842-1915) and Josephine Kotzum (1845-1920), and the proprietor of the Eagle Point Oyster Company. In November 1915, Tony Kotzum had entered into a five-year lease agreement with Clara Tillman Seymour (1889-1952), the widow of Hugh C. Seymour (1876-1913), on the oyster beds and grounds and house located at Marsh Point. This was the property that Hugh Seymour had purchased from F.A. \"Dolph\" Schrieber (1871-1944). In 1904, Mr. Schrieber and his brother, Joseph L. \"Dode\" Schrieber (1873-1951), had built the \"Black Diamond\", a house over the water at Marsh Point. Dolph Schrieber lived here intermittently to protect his oysters from poachers. Anton P. Kotzum agreed to pay the widow Seymour $250 per year and \"carefully cultivate and attend the oyster beds and grounds so manage the beds that they will be in good physical condition at the expiration of this lease as they are at present and to return all shells removed from the grounds properly spread or their equivalent in steam shells\". (The Progress, July 9, 1904, p. 4 and JXCO, Ms. Chancery Court Cause No. 3616-October 1917)\n\nThe Eagle Point Oyster Company advertised their product as, \"our oysters are unsurpassed for flavor and excellence, being grown from original stock, on grounds long noted for their superior qualities\".(The Ocean Springs News, November 24, 1915, p. 12)\n\nTony Kotzum died in September 1916. He was also a fine musician and directed the Ocean Springs Concert Band, an outgrowth of the Ocean Springs Brass Band led by T.J. Ames (1876-1927). Kotzum once crusaded for more benches in Marshall Park, as he felt that the spectacle of a hundred or more ladies standing during his concert was a poor advertisement of civic pride. In September 1916, Frank Kuppersmith (c. 1850-1920) came to Ocean Springs from Mobile, Alabama and took a lease on the Eagle Point Oyster Company building on Front Beach. (The Jackson County Times, September 23, 1916)\n\nOcean Springs Fish & Oyster Company\n\nIn March 1916, Philip Bellman created the Ocean Springs Fish & Oyster Company. His packinghouse was situated on the front beach between Jackson and Washington Avenue, on the former site of the Hugh Charles Seymour (1876-1913) oyster shop. Mr. Bellman was noted for his affable humor and relaxed attitude. (The Ocean Springs News, March 23, 1916, p. 6 and Margaret Seymour Norman, June 1995)\n\nPhilip M. Bellman's inventory for his seafood business included: a one-ton Ford truck; the Leo D, a motor vessel; fifteen skiffs; the Clara Seymour oyster lease, oyster shop, and wharf privileges; and oyster leases from the Ramsay Estate and Bouslog. (JXCO, Ms. Chancery Court Cause 4648-February 1925)\n\nMr. Bellman advertised his new business in The Ocean Springs News of March 30, 1916, as follows:\n\nOcean Springs Fish & Oyster Company\n\nPhilip Bellman, Manager\n\nLocated on Beach Between Washington and Jackson Avenues\n\nSmall or Large Orders Promptly Delivered Anywhere in Town\n\nEast Beach and Eagle Point Oysters a Specialty\n\nWe Solicit a Share of Your Patronage\n\nWe Also Take Out Boating Parties\n\nFor Prompt Service-Ring Phone 55\n\nIn mid-December 1916, two of Bellman's fishermen, Alphonse Cox and Emile Beaugez (1901-1967), took his vessel, Kentucky, in search of shrimp outside of Dog Key. The motor quit and they rigged a crude sail to get home. The resourceful seamen reached Belle Fontaine Beach and walked ten miles back to Ocean Spring having been without food for nearly two days. (The Daily Herald, December 19, 1916, p. 1)\n\nSale\n\nIn August 1923, Philip M. Bellman sold a two-thirds interest in the Ocean Springs Fish and Oyster Company to C.L. Martin and S.J. DeBleau who planned to continue the business at the same site and under the same lease terms from Mrs. Hugh C. Seymour. Bellman vended his business to Martin and DeBleau for $600. (The Jackson County Times, September 15, 1923, p. 5 ) By early1925, Philip M. Bellman was in serious litigation with Martin and DeBleau. He alleged that they still owed him $385 from the sale of his interest to them in the Ocean Springs Fish & Oyster Company. In their response, Martin and DeBleau declared that: Bellman owed them $2800; the Ocean Springs Fish & Oyster Company lease with Mrs. H.C. Seymour had expired and that they were required to pay her $120 to retain their oyster beds and utilize the oyster shop; Bellman had represented the number of merchantable oysters on the Seymour lease as 5000 barrels, when in reality there were less than 1000 barrels of oysters; and the one-ton Ford truck was their property and not that of Philip M. Bellman. The litigation between Bellman and Martin-DeBleau was adjudicated in December 1926, in favor of Bellman. The defendants were ordered to pay him $310 and placed a lien in favor of Bellman on the truck, motor boat, and fifteen skiffs owned by the Ocean Springs Fish & Oyster Company. (JXCO, Ms. JXCO, Ms. Chancery Court Cause 4648-February 1925)\n\nBiloxi\n\nThe Philip M. Bellman family moved to Biloxi in 1923, and resided at 612 Reynoir Street.

Brou set a record at the Southern AAU swim meet in New Orleans, when he swam the mile in 25 minutes and 59 seconds. Young Brou placed second in the two-mile event. At Baton Rouge in August 1939, Margaret M. Brou was the Southern AAU junior relay champion. (The Jackson County Times, September 5, 1936, p. 1 and August 12, 1939, p. In recent years, Claire E. Brou, a retired Navy-Air Force veteran, has distinguished herself in the National Veterans Wheelchair games. In 1997, she won five gold medals in San Diego at the veterans games for her skill in air rifle shooting, bowling, swimming, table tennis, and motorized wheel chair rallying. (The Sun Herald, July 18, 1997, p. D-1)\n\nMrs. Brou's other son, Philip E. Brou (1923-1958), distinguished himself as a carrier based naval aviator in the South Pacific Theater during WW II. He was an engineering graduate of Tulane University and was employed in the air conditioning business at New Orleans. While on naval reserve duty, Lt. Commander Philip E.

Lee (1874-1936), the owner and editor of The Progress, began to fail and he sold his newspaper to his printer, Ernest E. Beaugez . Mr. Lee left Ocean Springs for New Orleans and was there when a conflagration destroyed the printing plant of Mr. Beaugez on March 4, 1905. Returning here after the fire in order to review his business interests, A.E. Lee was met by enthusiastic supporters who were desirous of him to commence a new publishing venture at Ocean Springs. Thusly, The Ocean Springs News was born on March 15, 1906, from a two hundred dollar loan to A.E. Lee for the initial payment on a small printing plant. The Ocean Springs News was a success from the initial issue. (The Biloxi Herald, March 31, 1906, p. 8) Young Ernest E. Beaugez died untimely at Ocean Springs in August 1907. His corporal remains were interred in the Bellande Cemetery.
