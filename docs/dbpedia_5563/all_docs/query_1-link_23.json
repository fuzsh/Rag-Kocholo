        "text": "The Washington State Jewish Archives grew out of the Jewish History Project, a collaborative effort begun in 1968 between the Women’s Division of the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle and the Manuscripts and University Archives Division (now Special Collections) of the UW Libraries to collect primary source materials from the Jewish community. The project first focused on conducting oral history interviews with pioneer and long-time members of Seattle’s Jewish community but soon expanded to collect manuscript and photographic materials as well. In 1978, Ancestry and Achievement: An Exhibit of the Early Beginnings of the Seattle Jewish Community was held at Suzzallo Library at the UW to showcase the first decade of collecting. The exhibit received great response from the Jewish community, who then enthusiastically began to donate materials. From the outset, an agreement between the Jewish Federation and the UW Libraries gave the UW Libraries ownership of all collected materials, with Special Collections assuming custodianship of the archive. The NEH grant for collection development, received in 1981, filled many gaps in the WSJA and augmented its existing collections.\n\nAs a corollary to the Jewish History Project, the Washington State Jewish Historical Society (WSJHS) was established in 1980 to promote, develop, and support interest in and study of the history of Jewish communities in Washington State. From its inception, the principal mission of the WSJHS has been to collect and preserve primary source materials from the Jewish community. In addition to collecting historical materials (which are given to Special Collections to administrate), the WSJHS helps to prepare genealogies, develops and publishes materials based on the collections, exhibits materials of Jewish interest, sponsors and promotes lectures and programs specific to Jewish history, encourages research, and maps the landmarks of Jewish life in Washington State.\n\nWashington State has a large and active Jewish community that has been part of its history for nearly 150 years. Jews were among the first settlers in Seattle; merchant Bailey Gatzert opened a grocery and hardware store in 1869 and by 1875 was Seattle’s sixth mayor. Jews settled elsewhere in Washington as well; Marcus Oppenheimer arrived during the German migration of the mid 1800s, settled on the banks of the Columbia River, and in 1862 named a town (Marcus) after himself. The original town of Marcus was destroyed for the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam, but the town still exists in a nearby location.\n\nBy 1889, when Washington Territory became the forty-second state in the Union, Jewish citizens and businesses throughout Washington had been contributing to its development for four decades. Though the population of Jews in Territorial Washington numbered less than one percent of the area’s total population, their impact on the commercial and civic life of the territory was significant. Washington’s early history includes a Jewish Territorial Governor, Jewish state legislators, and Jewish mayors of several Washington cities. In Seattle’s non-Jewish community, Jews have had a leadership role disproportionate to their numbers. Though only about 2 to 4 percent of the total population, Seattle Jews have been influential in the city’s political, business, civic, and cultural past.\n\nGerman Jews arrived with the first wave of settlers to the Northwest in the early to mid part of the nineteenth century, and Eastern European Jews arrived in the 1880s. By the first half of the twentieth century, strong Ashkenazic Orthodox and Reform communities had taken root in Seattle. The city’s two early Orthodox synagogues included a large number of learned men committed to traditional values, an extraordinary trait for a relatively small, remote Jewish community.\n\nUnlike like most other American Jewish communities, Seattle also became the home for a large number of Sephardic Jews (Jews who trace their ancestry back to Spain and Portugal). The Sephardim who immigrated to the Northwest (mainly Seattle) in the early twentieth century came from Turkey, Greece, and the Island of Rhodes. By 1913, the six hundred members of Seattle’s Sephardic community made it the largest Sephardic community in any U.S. city outside of New York. Today, Seattle has the third largest Sephardic community in the U.S., after New York and Los Angeles."
