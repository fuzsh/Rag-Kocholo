        "text": "William P. Gottlieb was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1917 and died in 2006 in Great Neck, New York. He was a photographer and journalist who became known particularly for his portraits and reviews of jazz musicians. Beginning in the late 1930s, he covered jazz for The Washington Post. Between 1943 and 1945, he served in the Army Air Corp as a photo officer. After the war, he took up residence in New York, where he worked for Down Beat magazine as a staff writer and photographer. In 1948, he retired from photography. He subsequently started a filmstrip company and also wrote several children's books. In 1994, several of his jazz photographs were featured as United States postage stamps.\n\nThe collection consists of approximately 500 black and white photographs taken by William Gottlieb of jazz, classical, and pop musicians between the years 1938 and 1948. The majority of the photographs were taken during performances and rehearsals inside New York City night clubs, including the Aquarium, the Spotlite Club, the Pied Piper, the Onyx Club, Eddie Condon's, and the Famous Door. Several photographs were taken at the National Press Club and the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., at the Decca Records Studio, and at the offices of Down Beat magazine."
