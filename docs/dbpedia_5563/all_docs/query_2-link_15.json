Carl (Gottlieb; Gottfried) Guttenberg (b Wöhrd, nr Nuremberg, 21 Aug 1743; d Paris, 20 May 1790) attended the Zeichenschule in Nuremberg under Johann Justin Preissler, and for three years studied calligraphic engraving under Daniel Adam Hauer (1734-?89). In 1765 he worked in Berne as an etcher and engraver for Johann Ludwig Aberli, the architect Erasmus Ritter (1726-1805) and the publisher Beat Ludwig Walthard. In 1767 he went to Paris to train with the engraver Jean Georges Wille, who greatly encouraged him. From 1771, if not before, he apparently shared a studio in Paris with his brother Heinrich Guttenberg (b Wöhrd, 29 April 1749; d Nuremberg, 16 Jan 1818), who also trained as an engraver with Preissler and Wille. Carl Guttenberg worked as an engraver for Christian von Mechel in Basle from 1772-3, but thereafter worked in Paris as a draughtsman and engraver of calligraphy, portraits and illustrations. He engraved his own designs, such as Views of Münchenstein and Angenstein and Harbours of Bruges and Ostend, and those of other artists, including Greuze, Pierre Alexandre Wille and Henry Fuseli.\n\nPerson TypePerson"
