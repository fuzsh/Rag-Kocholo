        "text": "- While their son, Heinrich Wilhelm Krause Jr, was a child (i.e. after March 15, 1921), they moved to Germany. In 1928, at the urging of Jake Kornelsen (Maria's brother), they moved to the seventh concession, Wheatley, Ontario. They shortly moved to Port Crewe where W. F. Krause worked on a fishing boat [at Crewe's Fishery]. In 1938, they moved to Point Pelee where he and Maria purchased their own fishery.\n\n- Heinrich Kornelsen - miller by trade, and Jack of all trades with machinery - and Maria Voth were the parents of Maria Mietz Kornelsen\n\n[Editors Note: Friedrich Wilhelm Krause (January 18, 1897 - December 9, 1983) was an excellent gymnast while in school in Bischofswerda]\n\n[Note according to Elisabeth Kornelsen (May 31, 1916-), daughter of Heinrich Kornelsen (April 17, 1876 - 1947)] and Anna Kroeker (September 11, 1884-October 11, 1936), who married Dietrich Reghr: \"I was five years old in 1921, when the last German soldiers withdrew from Russia. My sister Mariechen [Maria Mietz Kornelsen (May 5, 1900 - April 2, 1991)] who was married to a Willie Krause [Friedrich Wilhelm Krause (18 January 1897 - 9 December 1983)] , went with them. At the time, they already had a little son, just a baby [Heinrich Wilhelm Krause (15 March 1921 - 15 January 1980)], in the travel cradle. I remembered that time, as from then on we suffered of terrible hunger. Besides me, Liesa, and my parents [who all remained in Tiegenhagen, Molotschna CoIony in Russia], there were also my siblings Lena, Jasch, Heins, Nut, Sascha, Sara, Katja [who all remained in Tiegenhagen, Molotschna CoIony in Russia]. Except for Mariechen, we were still all together [in Tiegenhagen, Molotschna CoIony in Russia].\n\nHis profession was commercial fisherman. His religion was Mennonite. His wife was Anne Mathies, born February 25, 1923, in Alexanderkrone, Molotschna, USSR. They were married on April 18, 1942, in Leamington, Ontario, by Abram Driedger, Oak Street United Mennonite Church. [Married: Jacob N. Driedger; Marriage License No. L36571, Certificate # 9430]\n\n- Bill - 7 years in Germany where he started school - was baptized Lutheran at the age of 5, but changed to Mennonite in 1963. He was a professional commercial fisherman (Port Crewe (1936-1938 [Crewe's Fishery]) and Point Pelee (1938-1978 upon retirement), served on several school boards, was an amateur architect and 1963-1965 chairman of the Building Committee for the construction of the Faith Mennonite Church (Leamington), built mostly by volunteer workers. He was a jack of all trades. In c. 1975-1976 he contracted leukemia and died January 15, 1980 while vacationing in Florida.\n\n- Annie was baptized Mennonite in 1941. She was a homemaker, community volunteer, and jack of all trades.\n\n[Annie Krause - Born: February 25, 1923, in Alexanderkrone, Molotschna, USSR; Baptism: June 01, 1941, N. N.
