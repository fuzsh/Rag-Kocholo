        "text": "Gottlieb Daimler (born March 17, 1834, Schorndorf, Württemberg [Germany]—died March 6, 1900, Cannstatt, near Stuttgart) was a German mechanical engineer who was a major figure in the early history of the automotive industry.\n\nDaimler studied engineering at the Stuttgart polytechnic institute and then worked in various German engineering firms, gaining experience with engines. In 1872 he became technical director in the firm of Nikolaus A. Otto, the man who had invented the four-stroke internal-combustion engine. In 1882 Daimler and his coworker Wilhelm Maybach left Otto’s firm and started their own engine-building shop. They patented one of the first successful high-speed internal-combustion engines (1885) and developed a carburetor that made possible the use of gasoline as fuel. The two used their early gasoline engines on a bicycle (1885; perhaps the first motorcycle in the world), a four-wheeled (originally horse-drawn) carriage driven by a one-cylinder engine (1886), and a boat (1887). The two men’s efforts culminated in a four-wheeled vehicle designed from the start as an automobile (1889). This commercially feasible vehicle had a framework of light tubing, a rear-mounted engine, belt-driven wheels, and four speeds. In 1890 Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft was founded at Cannstatt, and in 1899 the firm built the first Mercedes car."
