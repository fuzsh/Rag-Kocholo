Mini Biography

Courteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 into an affluent Southern family. Her father Richard L Cox (1930-2001) was a business man married to her mother Courteney. She was the baby of a family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother Richard Jnr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal Daddy’s girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974 her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.

She became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new step-father, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax. She was the first person to ever say “period” on American TV, in a Tampax commercial.

While modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of “As the World Turns” (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the infamous Bruce Springsteen video “Dancing in The Dark”. In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in “Misfits of Science” (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox’s girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in “Family Ties” (1982).

In 1989, “Family Ties” (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom “Friends” (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. She was named one of People Magazine’s 50 Most Beautiful People of 1995 and appeared on the cover. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven’s horror/comedy Scream (1996/I) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character twice more, as Scream became The Scream Trilogy. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox’s film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr and Mrs Arquette.

Personal Quotes

I like keeping Gale bitchy. She has a reputation to live up to. She may have changed her hair but not much else. [About her character Gale Weathers in the Scream (1996/I) series.]

I get so bored! I had a treadmill… I gave it to my mom. I had a stairmaster… gone. I had a recumbent bike…I dont know where that is. So I hate exercise except for Pilates.

I’m a gemini, and I get so bored so easily. I mean, I have moved six times in the last eight years.

A lot of my humor does come from anger. It’s like, you’re not gonna pull one over on me-which is pretty much my motto anyways.

I’m not a huge fan of romantic comedies- my taste goes much more to the offbeat and dark. I’d love to sink my teeth into something like Fargo (1996).

I only have to do three things to look halfway decent, curl my eyelashes, fill in my eyebrows and put some lipstick on.

I have to be physically attracted to someone. But I can’t just be with someone just because it’s great sex. Because orgasms don’t last long enough.

Honesty is the key to a relationship. If you can fake that, you’re in.

Before he moved in, David would say ‘How are we ever going to meld together, because our tastes are so different? Maybe it’s because we’re truly in love that we can. [On husband David Arquette.]

I want people to be happy, so I think that’s one of the reasons why I wanted to do the show in the first place… just to see somebody, even if it’s just for the day. To see their life change for that moment when they walk into the room and are that happy. It really makes you cry. It does. I hope I don’t lose this feeling. [On producing her show “Mix It Up” (2003).]

It’s so much fun for us. I have a new love for the show since I’ve gotten into this relationship. Honestly, I was a little bored the first four years. I had some fun things to do and some good relationships, but Monica was developing and I felt like there was a lot of straight man stuff. Now we have something really fun to play – two really neurotic people trying to have a relationship. They’re both afraid to commit, to get married, or take these steps. I have a really good time playing with him [Matthew Perry]. It’s kind of like our relationship in real life – except we don’t kiss. [About playing Monica and Chandler on “Friends” (1994).]

I can definitely act even if I don’t appear to have any particular style. I know I’m not a method actress, but I do believe in being physically and emotionally prepared for the role. If I have a scene where I’m supposed to be emotionally drawn out, then I’ll think of the saddest thing in my life. If I have to be five pounds lighter to be the right physical type, I’ll run my little tail around the block to make the weight.

I wasn’t going to go far. I’m only 5′ 5″ and I don’t have that look. (on her early modeling days)

[Asked “What’s my pet peeve?”] Not being heard. You don’t have to agree with me, just hear me. (Marie Claire – August 2006 – “The Real Me: Courteney on Courteney”)

I don’t think anyone in our show really comes off smelling like a rose. (on the show “Dirt”)
