        "text": "Hey, Friends Fans!\n\nWe all love friends (that’s what friends are for), but I was talking about the TV show. And while every lead character was pretty friendly on that show (hence the show title), I always had a soft spot in my heart for the charm of Courteney Cox. In fact, this isn’t the first time I’ve talked about her on the Everything Summer Camp Blog!\n\nAs I posted about her some five years back, I thought it might be time to retread some water and look at Courteney a little closer. In her previous post, I discussed how she attended Camp Mac in Munford, Alabama and some other info on her, like how she is the ‘baby’ of her family with two older sisters and one older brother.\n\nI also covered interesting little tidbits, like how she wasn’t actually going to be Monica. She was initially offered the role of Rachel in ‘Friends’, but she turned it down. Today, however, I want to go real deep so we can attempt to really get to know this woman.\n\nShe’s a Foodie\n\nShe really loves to eat. “At a diner, I’ll get scrambled egg whites, turkey bacon, sliced tomato, cottage cheese and a scooped-out onion bagel with cream cheese,” she’s said. “My favorite meal is New York grilled steak with sautéed garlic spinach and broccoli and maybe garlic chips or garlic fries.”\n\nShe Holds an Unbreakable Record—Period\n\nCourteney Cox was actually the first person to ever say the word ‘period’ on American television—and she wasn’t referring to the grammatical symbol. She was featured back in 1985 (almost a decade before her role as Monica) in a Tampax commercial.\n\nShe’s Not JUST a Talented Actor\n\nYou may know her for her incredibly successful acting career, but Courteney is talented in the musical department as well! She plays the piano and drums. In fact, she opened the ceremony with a drum solo at MTV’s Movie Awards in 1995.\n\nShe’s into House-Flipping\n\nAlong with her acting career and musical interest, she’s also into house-flipping for a hobby! House-Flipping is when you purchase a house that needs some fixing up, renovate it, and then put it back on the market for more than what you initially paid.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the friendships you make at summer camp as Courteney appreciated the honest friendships she made throughout her summer stays. “I don’t have time for superficial friends,” she’s commented. You’re sure to make sincere friends during your summer camp stay. And check out Camp Mac by clicking here if it seems like a good fit for you. As always, thanks for reading, Camp Fans!\n\n- John"
