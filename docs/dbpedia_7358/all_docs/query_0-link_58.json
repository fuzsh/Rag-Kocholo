        "text": "Yeah, that's right. Famous people live here, in Alabama, too!\n\nEaster weekend, might be a time to hang out with family, back in Dixieland! In fact, Channing Tatum has been all over Alabama in the last few months. He's been in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham and Huntsville of late.\n\nHe just loves us 'Bama people.\n\nIt's not just California, several celebs own homes/property in the great state of Alabama.\n\nSo, here goes, eight celebrities you could run into here in Alabama with properties in our state, according to The Land Report.\n\nCHANNING TATUM\n\nChanning is from the mighty Cullman, Alabama. He is starring in the new (and final) \"Magic Mike\" movie right now. At some point Tatum was a roofer and then a male stripper. After divorcing his wife Jenna Dewan, he bought some property in Alabama.\n\nDEBBY RYAN\n\nDebby Ryan was born in Huntsville, Alabama. She was a star on the Disney Channel for many years. She has property around the Huntsville area.\n\nMORGAN FREEMAN\n\nThe voice of so many film and TV shows, Morgan Freeman has a house in Gulf Shores, Alabama. He even helped pick the police chief a couple years ago. Now that is dedication to your community.\n\nCOURTENEY COX\n\nCourteney is known for so many things. The \"Scream\" movies and the iconic tv show \"Friends\", to name a couple. She was raised in Mountain Brook, Alabama and who wouldn't want to own property in that town? Can you blame her?\n\nLAVERNE COX\n\nLaverne Cox was born in Mobile. She got her break with a little show on Netflix called \"Orange Is The New Black\" and has appeared on \"Law & Order\" as well. Cox became the first transgender person to appear on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nLUCAS BLACK\n\nLucas Black got famous as the little boy in \"Sling Blade\". He was born in Decatur, Alabama and reportedly has never been a fan of living in California. So, he owns plenty of property in Alabama and travels back to California when he needs to shoot a movie/show.\n\nOCTAVIA SPENCER\n\nBorn in Montgomery, Octavia has always had homes in Alabama. This, even though she has been a huge star in Hollywood. I would love to run into Octavia out in Alabama, anywhere, because I have always wanted to meet this lady. I will even forgive the fact that she attended Auburn University.\n\nWALTON GOGGINS\n\nWalton has one of those faces that you instantly recognize. Born in Birmingham, he has been in multiple Hollywood projects. \"Django Unchained\", \"The Hateful Eight\" and TV's \"Justified\" only scratch the surface of his resume. He just seems like he would be fun to talk to or have a beer with anywhere in Alabama!\n\nMust-Visit Quirky Museums in Alabama"
