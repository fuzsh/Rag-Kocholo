She played the young woman Bruce Springsteen pulled onto the stage to dance with.\n\nCox was auditioned for the role of Rachel Green but was selected for the role of Monica Geller.\n\nRegistered in the Gunniese Book of World Records, is the record that she became the highest paid actor along with her co-stars. She was paid $1 million per episode for the last two seasons.\n\nEveryone had “Arquette” added after their names in the credits of the episode “The One After The Vegas”. Also, Chandler decides not to get married in that episode!\n\nCox met her ex-husband on the sets of Scream, who played her on-screen love interest in the movie.\n\nShe was producer Marc’s first choice for the role of Susan Mayer on Desperate Housewives. She had to turn it down because she was pregnant.\n\nThe news was in the air that there is going to be a movie, based on the TV show FRIENDS as the movie Sex in The City was a good success; but Warner Bros. Denied it!\n\nJenifer Aniston is Courtney’s daughter Coco’s Godmother!\n\nShe got divorced from David after two long years of separation. They still have a close friendship and partners in a business.\n\nShe knows how to play drums and piano.\n\nOn being asked in an interview that which FRIEND would you like to “do”, she said it would be Chandler cause his sarcasm matches Monica’s. They did hook up in the show after one year exactly!\n\nJust like her character, she is a clean freak in real life too. She would clean other people’s dresser rooms.\n\nShe had “Courtney’s Candy Cabinet” on the FRIENDS set. Her favorite is Butterfinger.\n\nShe was pregnant while shooting for the final season of FRIENDS.\n\nCox got her first modelling work when she was in first year, for the store Parisians.\n\nCourtney is funding and raising awareness for the skin disease epidomolysis bullosa.

They received it for six consecutive years. One each aye!\n\nShe appeared in a TV commercial for Tampax and was the first person to use the word “period” on TV.\n\nShe is the youngest in the Cox family.\n\nCourtney has changed four houses that she fixed and redecorated herself.\n\nCox quit smoking the night just before the day David proposed her."
