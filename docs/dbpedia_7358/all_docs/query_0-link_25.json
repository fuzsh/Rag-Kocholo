        "text": "A Facebook Watch series on pregnancy hosted by actress Courtney Cox will feature a double -- or maybe that should be triple -- connection to Alabama on Thursday.\n\nThe Alabama connections start with Cox: The star known for her roles in “Friends,” “Cougar Town” and the “Scream” movies was born in the Birmingham area and graduated from Mountain Brook High School. They continue with twin sisters from Loxley who are featured in Cox’s newest series.\n\n“9 Months with Courteney Cox” is a documentary series structured and distributed unlike anything in her history on the big screen of the movies of the smaller ones of TV. The first season, which debuted in January 2019, consisted of 20 episodes averaging about 15 minutes long, “airing” on Facebook. While Facebook Watch isn’t quite on the same level with Netflix and Amazon Prime, it has been funding and presenting a slate of original content since 2017.\n\n“9 Months” was renewed in summer 2019 for a second season. That run opened on Mother’s Day with an introduction from Cox that spelled out the mission:\n\n“Last season on ‘9 Months’ we embarked on a groundbreaking social experiment where we asked people all across America to document their pregnancy,” Cox says. “This season, another group of hopeful parents have invited us to document their pregnancy journey. And the stakes couldn’t be higher.”\n\nLike the first season, this one is a brisk mix of narrative segments featuring Cox, combined with footage apparently shot by the couples themselves. Like the first, it will feature 10 couples struggling with various issues that complicate their pregnancies. The premiere introduced four of them. The second episode, which is to premiere Thursday, May 14, will present twin sisters in Foley who find themselves pregnant at the same time.\n\n“Tiesha and Dienesha are 28-year-old twin sisters living together and are both pregnant with boys with the same due date,” according to information provided by the show’s producers. “Tiesha became pregnant via IUI, and Dienesha’s is an unexpected pregnancy and they’re both very excited to share their pregnancy journeys together.”\n\nThe two will be featured in “a number of episodes” through the finale on July 2, according to information provided by show producers."
