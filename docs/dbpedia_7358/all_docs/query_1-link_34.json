The petite brunette has been in the Hollywood circuit since her role on Family Ties in the ’80s.

Since the end of the Central Perk era, Cox has returned to TV starring in and producing the FX show Dirt, which ran for a full season before being cancelled in spring 2008.

Cox is back to work filming her new ABC series Cougar Town. After 11 years of marriage, Cox and Arquette announced they were separating in October 2010. Cox has been in an off-again, on-again relationship with Musician Johnny McDaid. The couple met is 2014 and is currently together.",
