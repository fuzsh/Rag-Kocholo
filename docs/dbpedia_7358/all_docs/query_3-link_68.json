        "text": "Ed Sheeran wowed his close friend Courteney Cox after he played her a song he wrote inspired by the sitcom that made her famous.\n\nSharing a video to his Instagram page where he was hanging out in the kitchen with Courteney, Ed, 32, whips out his guitar as he gears up to serenade her with the track titled American Town. As he strums the strings ready to begin Ed turns to Courteney, 59, to explain what he is about to perform for her.\n\nHe says: \"Courteney, I wrote a song inspired by Friends, the show you were on and I'm going to play it to you. It's called American Town.\" He then sings: \"We're a long way from home, haven't seen you in so long / But it all came back in one moment.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"And the years started cold but I didn't notice at all and we found there's a room with both in / We ate Chinese food in small white boxes / Lived a life we saw in Friends / Your room it barely fits the mattress, wake up late for work again. The wind it seems to blow right through us / Down jackets are the trend / The rush of rushing deep into love.\n\n\"English girl in an American town, elevator to the fifth floor out, ringing the buzzer then l be right down, I wish time would freeze. Dungarees over the hoodie we're out, three feet off the ground / Lost in love and we don't wanna be found, it's just you and me / English girl in an American town.\"\n\nSeemingly impressed by the acoustic track Courteney then asks: \"Wait, that was really about the show Friends?\" To which Ed responds: \"Well inspired by it, yeah. Because you eat Chinese food in small white boxes, living the life we saw in Friends.\" Courteney then jokes: \"Wow I love that, wow. Do I get paid?\"\n\nEd captioned the fun video clip: \"Impromptu kitchen jam of American Town with my landlady @courteneycoxfficial, sorry for the late rent, I'm good for it.\"\n\nFans loved the interaction and quickly headed to the comments section to praise the pair. One user loved Courteney's response, writing: \"\"do i get paid\" hahahha courteney is so real for that.\" Another added: \"This crossover is unexpected and awesome.\"\n\nThe pair have been close friends for more than 10 years now with Ed introducing Courteney to her partner Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol. Ed was seen out to dinner with Courteney, Johnny and movie director Ben Winston earlier this month.\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook\n\nAll the latest news, showbiz, lifestyle and sports updates, brought to you by our dedicated American team.\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook to make sure you're not missing out."
