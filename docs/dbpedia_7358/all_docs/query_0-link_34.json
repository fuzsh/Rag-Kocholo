        "text": "MAD Magazine #339 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nCourteney Cox as \"Moniker\" and Jennifer Aniston as \"Regal\" have a heart-to-heart in this fourth-page panel from MAD's Friends parody. Written by Josh Gordon and illustrated by Mort Drucker, \"Fiends\" originally appeared in MAD #339 (September '95) and was given the rainbow treatment for MAD Color Classics #3 (April '01).\n\nMAD Magazine #355 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nBy the time Angelo Torres got the call to illustrate Arnie Kogen's Scream 2 satire (\"Screech 2,\" MAD #368, April '98), he had already illustrated Courteney Cox and her Friends castmates for the ending of MAD's spoof of The Single Guy (\"The Sinking Guy,\" written by Josh Gordon for MAD #355, April '97).\n\nMAD Magazine #368 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nRoberto Parada's first-ever MAD cover, for #368 (April '98), featured the first of two Courteney Cox MAD cover appearances and marked the second consecutive cover for Sarah Michelle Gellar - a rare feat for any MAD cover target.\n\nMAD Magazine #394 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nSo what does Courteney Cox look like today, at the age of 52? Does Bill Wray's artwork for the final verse of \"Wes Craven\" (MAD #394, June '00) give a clue? Wray aged franchise co-stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox, in addition to now-deceased director Wes Craven, to close the brilliant Andrew Schwartzberg parody of Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven.\"\n\nMAD Magazine #413 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nMark Fredrickson's cover art for MAD #435 (November '03), which featured a combined five pages' worth of material to mark Friends' tenth and final season on NBC. Fun fact: All three female Friends cast members have each made two MAD cover appearances, with Matthew Perry getting a cameo on the cover of MAD #413 (January '01). David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc haven't scored a single cover appearance other than this Alfred-ization.\n\nMAD Magazine #435 • USA • 1st Edition - New York\n\nOh, come on now! A Friends spinoff where Monica ISN'T married to Chandler?!? Why, I oughta...ooo... Writer Greg Leitman and artist Drew Friedman teamed up for \"More Ridiculous Friends Spinoffs We're Sure To See,\" which ran in MAD #435. Courteney Cox's most prominent role in the Dennis Snee-penned \"Signs That Friends Just Doesn't Give A Damn Anymore,\" which ran in MAD #435 (November '03)."
