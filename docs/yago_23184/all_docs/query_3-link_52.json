        "text": "The Jordanian royal palace announced Wednesday that Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah and his wife, Princess Rajwa Khalid Al-Saif, are expecting their first child, due in the coming summer.\n\nThe official statement did not specify whether it was a boy or a girl, but it included congratulations and well-wishes to King Abdullah and Queen Rania, who are set to become grandparents.\n\nThe prince and his Saudi Arabian wife tied the knot last June in a lavish ceremony held at the \"Zahran\" Palace in the capital, Amman. Princess Rajwa hails from a prominent family with influence in Saudi Arabia, and both sides hope that their union, broadcasted live on social media, will strengthen ties between Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Guests from around the globe attended the event, including the British heir apparent, Prince William, and his wife, Kate."
