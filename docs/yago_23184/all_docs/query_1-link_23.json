In 1980, King Abdullah entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, where he received his military education.\n\nKing Abdullah attended Oxford University in 1984, undergoing a one-year Special Studies course in International Politics and World Affairs. Upon returning home, His Majesty continued his military path, gaining experience and working his way to the rank of Captain and the Commander of a Tank Company in the 91st Armored Brigade. From 1986-1987, also as Captain, His Majesty was attached to the Royal Jordanian Air Forces Helicopter Anti-Tank Wing as a Tactics Instructor, where he received qualification as a Cobra Attack Helicopter Pilot.\n\nIn 1987, King Abdullah attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and was in residence as a Mid-Career Fellow. He undertook Advanced Study and Research in International Affairs under the auspices of the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program.\n\nUpon returning home, His Majesty was assigned to the 17th Tank Battalion, 2nd Royal Guards Brigade and in the summer of 1989, he became Battalion 2nd-in-Command, with the rank of Major. In 1991, King Abdullah was the Armor Representative in the Office of the Inspector General. He was promoted to Lt. Colonel at the end of the year and assumed command of the 2nd Armored Car Regiment in the 40th Brigade.\n\nUpon handing over the battalion in January 1993, King Abdullah was promoted to full Colonel and assigned as deputy commander of the Jordanian Special Forces.

His Majesty was appointed Commander of the Special Operations Command on October 1997, and in May 1998, he was promoted to the rank of Major General.\n\nIn addition to his career as an army officer, King Abdullah has served his country many times in the official capacity of Regent in the absence of His Majesty King Hussein, and he regularly traveled with the late King Hussein. Before his accession to the throne, King Abdullah represented Jordan and his late father on visits to many countries throughout the world, and developed close relationships with leaders and officials of a number of Arab countries during the course of his career.\n\nKing Abdullah is committed to building on the legacy left by the late King Hussein to further Jordans democratic institutionalization and political pluralism, while working for a just and comprehensive peace. Following in his late fathers footsteps, King Abdullah has placed great emphasis on improving Jordans economy and streamlining the government which will lay the foundations to allow Jordan to enter the next century with confidence.\n\nKing Abdullah married Queen Rania on June 10, 1993. Their Majesties have one son, Prince al-Hussein, born June 28, 1994, and one daughter, Princess Iman, born September 27, 1996."
