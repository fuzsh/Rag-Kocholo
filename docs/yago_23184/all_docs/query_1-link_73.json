        "text": "Princess Rajwa, the wife of Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan, gave birth to a baby girl on Saturday, marking the couple’s first child and the first grandchild for King Abdullah II, according to a statement from Jordan’s Royal Hashemite Court. The newborn, named Princess Iman, was introduced to the world in a heartwarming video posted on Rajwa’s official Instagram page, where Crown Prince Hussein is seen cradling his daughter while the classic American ballad “You Are My Sunshine” plays in the background.\n\nThe birth of Princess Iman comes nearly a year after Hussein and Rajwa’s high-profile wedding, which was attended by notable figures, including Britain’s Prince William and Kate Middleton and US First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nRajwa, 30, who hails from a prominent Saudi Arabian family connected to King Salman, married Crown Prince Hussein, also 30. Hussein has held his title since 2004, when his father, King Abdullah II, appointed him as heir. The King has been a steadfast ally to the West and a moderating influence in a region often plagued by instability.\n\nAccording to Jordanian law, only males are eligible to inherit the Hashemite throne, making Princess Iman’s birth a symbolic addition to the royal family. The Royal Hashemite Court expressed its congratulations to the royal couple and to King Abdullah II and Queen Rania on this joyous occasion."
