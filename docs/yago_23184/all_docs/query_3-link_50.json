His wife Rajwa, was an architect who had also lived and worked in the US - and is a second cousin to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nOn 10 April, the Royal Hashemite Court announced that the couple were expecting their first child.\n\n\"We are pleased to share that their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Princess Rajwa Al Hussein are expecting their first baby this summer,\" the announcement said."
