        "text": "Jordan celebrated the royal wedding of Crown Prince Al Hussein Bin Abdullah and Crown Princess Rajwa al-Seif in Jordan's capital city on Thursday.\n\nThursday was declared a national holiday in commemoration of the royal couple's marriage.\n\nPrince Al Hussein first announced his marriage to al-Seif in August 2022.\n\nAl-Seif, 29 years old, comes from a prominent family in Saudi Arabia, the Sudairis, and is the first cousin of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe studied architecture at Syracuse University in New York and speaks Arabic, English and French.\n\nThursday's wedding is a three-part affair, starting with a traditional Islamic marriage \"katb ktab\" in the Zahran Palace in Amman which will see the two sign an official marriage contract.\n\nThe bride and groom will then drive across Amman to the al-Husseiniya Palace in the traditional motorcade consisting of eight red Land Rovers, 11 motorcycles, as well as horse and camel riders.\n\nThere they will host a reception for 1,700 guests alongside the king and queen, culminating in the cutting of the wedding cake.\n\nFinally, the nuptial day will conclude with a banquet attended by members of the Hashemite royal family, foreign and Arab heads of state, as well as other high-ranking officials.\n\nThe wedding is the result of months of preparation, with the roads of Amman that the motorcade will cross being subject to renovation and repair.\n\nOn Wednesday, King Abdullah II hosted a dinner for over 4,000 Jordanians in line with local customs.\n\nMembers of civil society, businesspeople, officials and community representatives dined on Mansaf, the country's national dish comprising of stewed lamb on rice drenched in a fermented yoghurt sauce.\n\nThe day prior, a free concert featuring Egyptian singer Tamer Hosny was held in the country's capital, attended by tens of thousands of Jordanians.\n\nOn 22 May, Queen Rania hosted a Henna and dinner party for 500 women across the kingdom, a common pre-wedding tradition in Jordan.\n\nJordan had another royal wedding just two-and-a-half months earlier when Princess Iman married a Venezuelan venture capitalist Jameel Alexander Thermiotis.\n\nThursday's wedding is higher-profile given that the Crown Prince is getting married and Jordan is gaining a future queen.\n\nCrown Prince Al Hussein, 28, has focused most of his royal activities on youth empowerment and employment, particularly in the fields of technology.\n\nThe Crown Prince has rarely commented on matters of internal politics but has taken on an increasingly public role in recent years through his foundation and with foreign leaders.\n\nThe Crown Prince frequently accompanies King Abdullah on official visits, meeting with US President Joe Biden in February 2023.\n\nHe has also given speeches at the UN, delivering Jordan’s address at the General Assembly in May 2017.\n\nThe Crown Prince also \"regularly enjoys practising various sports, including football, diving and archery. He also enjoys riding motorbikes and adventure sports,\" the Hashemite Royal Court said."
