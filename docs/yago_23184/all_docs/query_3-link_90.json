        "text": "Hello All, it's has been a while, only 10 years\n\nI was looking for HMKA II visit photos to the light dragoons regiment in Yorkshire, can you please help me\n\nWelcome back\n\nFollowing are two photos published by KA II`s photographer Yousef Allan:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/2009778899...173689263718/1841173572597063/?type=3&theater\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/2009778899...173689263718/1841173562597064/?type=3&theater\n\nCrown Prince Hussein and his future\n\nHi guys! I am new in this forum?!\n\nThere is something that I always think about CP hussein and wanted to know what you guys think about it (sorry if it's a dumb question)\n\nDo you think CP hussein would accept a arranged marriage? Like marry his 2nd/3rd cousin or someone from an other muslim/arab royal family (like saudi arabia, bahrein, dubai)? Cause he seems to be more \"traditional\" than his parents and maybe he prefer to marry a arab royal blood girl to keep a \"tradition\" or a \"good relationship\" with those countries or something...\n\nTypically threads by members who are also actively engaged in other topics are more likely to be answered than a new member starting a new thread to ask one question never to be seen again.\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\nBTW, who is 'we'?\n\nAnd: Welcome on TRF! Hope you'll enjoy it and become interested in other royal houses as well.\n\nWhy's no one answering this? We're very curious! Can any Jordanians tell fangirls whether or not your Crown Prince is single?\n\nNow he is single but I heard from some one that he was with an Arab girl during his last year at university but he broke up with her before Sandhurst or something like that!\n\nHi guys!

But I think he will probably marry a Jordanian like his father.\n\nHe doesn’t have to marry a woman from the royal or ruling Gulf families, his mother isn’t from one the ruling families but she is of course Jordanian and his grandmother, Queen Muna is of British origin so it’s possible for him to marry a foreign woman, but of course the children would have to be Muslim. But I think he will probably marry a Jordanian like his father.\n\nThe Queen is a Palestinian born in Kuwait who didn't move to Jordan until 1991.\n\nIt's quite interesting looking at how the Hashemites went from favouring marriages among themselves and related families or to members of the Egyptian Royal family and aristocracy to marrying commoners and foreigners in only a few decades. It's a similar but somewhat faster development to what has happened in Europe since World War I.\n\nWere Queen Muna more popular than Queen Noor and if so do we know why? I have a possible answer to my own question, but want to see what other thinks.\n\nThe Queen is a Palestinian born in Kuwait who didn't move to Jordan until 1991.\n\nIt's quite interesting looking at how the Hashemites went from favouring marriages among themselves and related families or to members of the Egyptian Royal family and aristocracy to marrying commoners and foreigners in only a few decades.

I have a possible answer to my own question, but want to see what other thinks.\n\nWhich member married a member of the Egyptian royal family? As for the marital policies, they changed overtime due to geopolitics, traditional politics and their fairly recent liberal tendencies about their spouses.\n\nKing Hussein's first wife, Queen Dina, was related to the Egyptian royals (as well as Hussein) iirc.\n\nHussein was nervous about marrying a non-Arab (hence Muna wasn't queen) and Muna was intensely domestic by everyone's choice, seemingly. Noor came after the much-loved Alia. Neither of them spoke great Arabic. I'd be surprised if either Muna or Noor were particularly popular, at least back in the day.\n\nAnd it didn't really matter, did it? Everything revolved around Hussein."
