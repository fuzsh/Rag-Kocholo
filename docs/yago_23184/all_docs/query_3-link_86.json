        "text": "This weekend, the Jordanian royal family announced the birth of HRH Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa Al Hussein’s first daughter, Iman.\n\nJordan’s Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II and Princess Rajwa Al Hussein have welcomed their first daughter, as seen in an announcement shared by the royal family on Saturday. Named Princess Iman bint Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, she is the first grandchild to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania.\n\nThe family members shared the happy news, with the king’s Instagram account releasing a heartwarming video of the prince softly reading the Islamic call to prayer to his newborn, a tradition followed in most Muslim families around the world. “Praise be to God who gave us our first granddaughter, Iman bint Al-Hussein,” the announcement read. “I congratulate Al Hussein and Rajwa on their newborn baby. We ask God to give her good growth and protect her for her parents.”\n\nThe child’s name was also confirmed in a post by Queen Rania, who shared a picture of herself holding the baby, with the caption: “Iman, you’ve already got a hold of my heart. Our family has never been happier.” In Arabic, the name simply translates to “faith” or “belief”, however, it also holds a deeper meaning. In Islam, having faith, and believing in Allah, his prophets, the Quran, the angels, and the hereafter, is fundamental to practicing the religion. According to the hadith or reported sayings, Iman has also been described by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as “an acknowledgment in the heart, a voicing with the tongue, and an activity with the limbs.”\n\nMany women across the region have the name Iman or similar, such as Imaan, Emon, and Imane. While the name is also common in popular culture, it is easily a favorite in the Jordanian royal family, which already has one Iman. Crown Prince Hussein’s sister is named Princess Iman bint Abdullah II, who is the second child in the family and married to Jameel Thermiotis. While the family is yet to confirm whether the 27-year-old was the inspiration behind the newborn’s name, pictures of Princess Iman holding her namesake are enough to prove that she is a doting aunt regardless of the fact."
