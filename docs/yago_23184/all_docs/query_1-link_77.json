        "text": "Crown Prince Abdullah has a penchant for wearing snakeskin cowboy boots and driving fast cars - he is his father's son when it comes to living the lifestyle of a wealthy Arab with Western tastes.\n\nBut in two important respects he differs from his father. One difference will be of benefit to him in his future life as king while the other may be an impediment.\n\nFirst the bad news. His command of Arabic is said to be poor. 'He speaks street Arabic, not classical,' said a source. 'He has no problem communicating with the soldiers under his charge but, like the elite class of Amman, his first tongue is English. This will be a problem for him once he has to take the international stage beside the other Middle Eastern rulers,' the source added.\n\nAbdullah's poor grasp of Arabic is testament to his strong bond with his mother, Princess Muna al-Hussein ('Hussein's Delight'). Born Toni Gardiner, she was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker Gardiner of the Royal Engineers, an adviser to Jordan on water conservation.\n\nKing Hussein married Princess Muna, his second wife, for love rather than politics and although the marriage was short-lived, they have maintained good relations.\n\nWhen the 19-year-old met the king, dressed as a pirate at a fancy dress party, her first words to him were: 'You look pretty scruffy your majesty!' according to a new biography by Roland Dallas, who claims the marriage failed because of the king's roving eye.\n\n'She could have left, returned to England and still received her royal stipend, but she chose to stay and stand by her children,' said a source close to the court.\n\nThe result is that Abdullah, a career soldier, has turned out unmistakably English in deportment, character and outlook. Although Abdullah was briefly crown prince as a toddler, his father changed the constitution in his brother Hassan's favour because of the regime's instability at that time.\n\nAbdullah has always been ruled out of contention for the throne because of persistent doubts about whether his mother ever converted to Islam.\n\nThe king's enduring intimacy with Princess Muna has been a source of friction in his relationship with his present wife, Queen Noor, a Muslim convert who has pressed for her eldest son, Hamzah, to succeed King Hussein.\n\nThough Queen Noor attended the wedding of Abdullah and Rania Yassin in June 1993, she was kept out of the official photographs. King Hussein was pictured with the happy couple and his ex-wife Princess Muna.\n\nAbdullah, who turns 37 tomorrow, enrolled at Sandhurst military academy when he was 18 - like his father - and went on to study international politics for a year at Oxford University - like his deposed uncle Hassan. Later he attended Fort Knox Armored School and Georgetown University in the US.\n\nIn his masters degree thesis on the Arab-Israeli conflict Abdullah wrote that Israel's retaliatory operations against Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation across the border into Jordanian territory were justified. He earned an 'A' grade.\n\n'He was an excellent student who never told anyone that he was King Hussein's son, never displayed his status, demanded and received treatment identical to every other student,' said Alon Pinkas, Abdullah's Israeli-born teacher at Georgetown who now serves as an aide to the Labour party leader, Ehud Barak.\n\nIsrael's former prime minister Shimon Peres established a relationship with Abdullah at the time, which was broken off when Crown Prince Hassan learned of it.\n\nAfter his studies Abdullah returned home to pursue an army career and in October 1997 was made commander of the Special Operations Command, the mailed fist of the Hashemite regime. The loyalty of these crack forces to Abdullah is not in doubt.\n\nIn a rare interview with Jane's International Defence Review in November 1996 Abdullah spoke of the SOC's role in maintaining border security in support of the peace process with Israel.\n\n'The police are being outgunned and outmanoeuvred by a very professional and very well-equipped smuggling organisation on the Iraqi border and terrorist infiltrations on the Syrian border,' he said.\n\n'He has always had a very nice and easy life, lots of cars, girls, you name it,' said a source close to the court. 'There's this frivolous side but he's ambitious within the army. I don't think he ever thought he would be king. He's no saint, but that goes for the rest of the family too, except for his brother Faisal who is very serious and religious.'\n\nIn the future king's favour - apart from the army's backing - is his marriage to Princess Rania, whose family is from Tulkarm in the West Bank. His wife is a double refugee. Her parents left their home in 1967 when Israel invaded and occupied the West Bank, moving to Kuwait. After the 1991 Gulf war Kuwait expelled its large Palestinian population in revenge for King Hussein's support of the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. Abdullah therefore has excellent credentials as far as the 70 per cent Palestinian population of Jordan is concerned.\n\n'He has the potential to become a worthy successor to his father, but he lacks political and foreign policy experience,' said one veteran palace-watcher.\n\n'He is affable, humble even, gets on easily with everybody. The best thing that could happen now would be for King Hussein to make a recovery but to abdicate and put himself to work in preparing Abdullah for the role. Abdullah needs a year at least of his father's tutelage,' he added."
