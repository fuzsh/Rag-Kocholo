        "text": "Update: Princess Iman married Jameel Alexander Thermiotis at Beit Al-Urdon Palace on Sunday, March 12. See all the photos from their royal wedding here.\n\nThere's a royal wedding on the horizon: Princess Iman of Jordan is getting married! Princess Iman, the eldest daughter of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, is set to marry Jameel Alexander Thermiotis. Thermiotis was born in Caracas, Venezuela to a Greek family, and now works in New York City as a managing partner at a venture capital firm.\n\n\"The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Her Royal Highness Princess Iman and Mr. Thermiotis on this occasion and wishes them a lifetime of happiness,\" the palace said in a statement announcing the engagement.\n\nThe news was released with a portrait of the couple (above), where Iman is already leaning into bridal whites: She wears a lovely white pleated dress and poses with her sparkling engagement ring.\n\n\"Congratulations my dearest Iman; your smile has always been a gift of love that I’ve cherished since the day you were born. I wish you and Jameel a life filled with love and laughter!\" Queen Rania wrote on Instagram, sharing the official portrait.\n\nPrincess Iman, 25, and Thermiotis, 28, will tie the knot on Sunday, March 12, and it's sure to be a glamorous affair. Queen Rania wrote on Instagram, \"The first time I held my baby girl, I knew my life would never be the same. In a week, she will be a bride. My precious Iman, I am so happy for you and so proud of everything that you are.\" Further details of their wedding—including where it will take place—have yet to be announced.\n\nIn the Rania's Instagram Reel, a photo of Princess Iman wearing the Diamond Tiara was included, sparking speculation she could wear it on her wedding day. Queen Rania has worn it three times before, including to a State Banquet at Windsor Castle in 2001.\n\nQueen Rania wears the Diamond Tiara to Windsor Castle in November 2001.\n\nIman is the first of her four siblings to marry—her older brother, Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II will marry Rajwa Al-Saif in June.He posted a photo of himself with the happy couple to his Instagram, writing \"Warmest congratulations to my dear sister Iman and to her fiancé Jameel on their engagement. I wish you a lifetime of happiness together.\"\n\nQueen Rania and King Abdullah married in 1993 at the Zahran Palace in Amman, Jordan, where Rania wore a dress by British designer Bruce Oldfield.\n\nAbdullah and Rania on their wedding day in Amman, Jordan, June 1993.\n\nRania glances at Abdullah on their wedding day.\n\nAt a pre-wedding henna party, Princess Iman wore Queen Rania's Bruce Oldfield wedding belt—a sweet nod to her mom's wedding day outfit.\n\nThe last member of the Jordanian royal family to marry was King Abdullah's half-sister Princess Raiyah. Princess Raiyah married Roald Dahl's grandson, British journalist Ned Donovan, in July 2020.\n\nWe will update this post as soon as we learn more about Princess Iman and Jameel Alexander Thermiotis's wedding."
