It is very normal to find monogamy in Jordan or even other Muslim countries. In fact, in plenty of them, monogamy is the norm. It is very common. Also I don’t see Rania as a woman who can accept her husband having more than one wife. In most cases, a Muslim man needs his 1st wife’s permission to marry a 2nd one. As for the Dubai sheikhs, it is a different culture there. The rich people in the Gulf states like UAE or Saudi Arabia tend to marry multiple wives, probably because they are rich enough to afford the same lifestyle for their wives equally as suggested by the teachings. Also, the religious culture there is more \"orthodox\" where it's more accepted and common for a man to have multiple wives."
