        "text": "Just over 30 years ago, on 10 June 1993, the eyes of the world were on King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan, as they tied the knot in one of the most romantic royal weddings of all time.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Olivia Henson, the new Duchess of Westminster? Let Tatler reveal all\n\nOlivia Henson and Hugh Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster married at Chester Cathedral on Friday 7 June. The Marlborough alumna has snapped up one of the most eligible bachelors in the land, so who is the bride?\n\nAbdullah, eldest child of King Hussein and his second wife, Princess Muna, was still a prince when he met the radiant Rania Al-Yassin at a dinner party in Amman in January 1993. Rania, a business graduate of the American University in Cairo, held jobs at Citibank and in the marketing department of Apple before crossing paths with her royal beau. Born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents, Rania and her family had moved to the Jordanian capital in 1991, following the end of the Gulf War.\n\nRania’s life changed almost overnight. On 10 June 1993, less than six months after meeting Abdullah, 22-year-old Rania became a princess. At the time, she did not expect to be queen. Abdullah was not due to inherit the throne due to political instability in the country. Instead, it was set to go to his uncle, Prince Hassan. However, his father changed his mind shortly before his death in 1999, and allowed Abdullah to inherit the throne. Queen Rania described the change as ‘a big shock,’ according to Oprah.com.\n\nRead More\n\nWho were Olivia Henson's flower girls? How the Duke of Westminster's nieces accompanied the bride down the aisle at her wedding to Hugh Grosvenor\n\nHugh Grosvenor's nieces, Isla van Cutsem, Zia Snow and Orla Snow, wore matching dresses for the big day - and their outfits even included a touching nod to bride-to-be Olivia Henson\n\nThe wedding was a grand state affair. The day was declared a national holiday, and people lined the Jordanian streets to catch a glimpse of the royal couple as they processed through the streets in an open-top car. Royal guests at the ceremony included Princess Irene of Greece and Queen Sofia of Spain, who was also one of the royals who attended Crown Prince Hussein’s wedding last year.\n\nFor the ceremony itself, Rania wore a gold-trimmed, short-sleeved gown designed by Bruce Oldfield, who is also a favourite designer of Queen Camilla. Oldfield was reportedly inspired by a series of formal Syrian costumes on exhibit at the V&A. The wedding dress was distinctive, with a short-sleeved jacket, complete with wide lapels and elaborate gold patterns. Meanwhile, the cascading silk gown had a magnificent belt to keep it in place (her daughter, Princess Iman wore this same belt for her henna party ahead of her own royal wedding last year). Rania accessorised with white gloves, but opted not to wear a tiara, instead choosing to wear a dramatic headband with her hair in a sweeping up-do.\n\nRead More\n\nWho are the Hensons? Meet Olivia Henson's aristocratic family, who have ties to banking empires and the social scene's most sought-after sisters\n\nTwo households, both alike in dignity, in fair Chester where we lay our scene …\n\nThe then Prince Hussein wore a suit which mirrored his father’s wedding suit. According to Town and Country, the Hashemite court said: ‘The Crown Prince will don a suit that draws inspiration from the distinguished design worn by His Majesty King Abdullah II on his wedding day. Embodying the rich legacy of the Hashemites, the suit's sleeves pay homage to the timeless style displayed by both Their Majesties King Abdullah II and King Abdullah I.’\n\nThe wedding took place at Zahran Palace. Following the ceremony, the couple danced the night away together at a magnificent reception, where Rania opted to wear a V-neck dress with short sleeves which was also designed by Bruce Oldfield."
