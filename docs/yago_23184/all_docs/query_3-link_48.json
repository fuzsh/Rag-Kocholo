        "text": "The Jordanian Royals, who belong to the Hashemites dynasty, are a family whose modern and peaceful approach to ruling over their country is legendary.\n\nTheir history as a dynasty dates back hundreds of years and is currently the oldest in the Muslim world.\n\nTheir quiet and timeless elegance is as admired and respected as much as their humanitarian efforts across the Middle East and internationally.\n\nWhere does the Jordanian royal family live?\n\nThe many royal palaces in Jordan are unique extensive properties with big gardens and unimposing exteriors. While they still boast elegance, they are strategically built and all have a specific purpose in how they are utilised by the family.\n\nRaghadan Palace in Amman was once the full-time residence of the current King and Queen of Jordan. Built in the 20th century it represents both the traditional and modern aspects of the family’s history.\n\nWhile the King and Queen now reside in a private residence closer to the suburbs of Amman, the palace is still used to host state visits and receptions.\n\nContinue reading to discover all the current members of Jordan’s Royal Family.\n\nWho are the King and Queen of Jordan?\n\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein\n\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein ascended to the throne after the death of his father King Hussein. He is the eldest son of the late King and Princess Muna Al Hussein, his second wife.\n\nKing Abdullah underwent his early education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, and then at St. Edmund’s School in England. His high school education took the young prince to Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy in the USA. Furthering his studies, His Majesty attended the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, UK, and finished an additional year of International Politics and World Affairs at Oxford University.\n\nThe Jordanian King proceeded to grow a rather impressive army career, and in 1987, underwent additional study in International Affairs at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1993, King Abdullah married Queen Rania. The following year the royal couple welcomed their first child, Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah. They went on to have three more children, Prince Hashem, Princess Iman, and Princess Salma.\n\nAfter the death of his father on February 7, 1999, 37-year-old Prince Abdullah II bin Al Hussein took his place as King.\n\nQueen Rania\n\nBorn Rania Al Yassin, Her Majesty grew up in Kuwait to Palestinian parents.\n\nLater in life, she went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree from the American University of Cairo in Business Administration. While working in information technology and banking, a 22-year-old Rania met King Abdullah at a dinner party.\n\nThe pair began seeing each other and six months later were married, making Rania a Princess. The following year they welcomed their first child, Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah.\n\nAccording to her official website, Queen Rania is globally renowned for “her efforts to challenge stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims and promote greater understanding and acceptance between people of all faiths and cultures.”\n\nWhen her husband was officially sworn in as King in 1999, Princess Rania became Queen. At only 29 years old she was the youngest Queen in the world at the time.\n\nCrown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah\n\nCrown Prince Al Hussein was born in 1994. The first child of King Abdullah and Queen Rania Hussein is heir apparent to the Jordanian throne.\n\nIn June 2023, at the age of 28, he married Princess Rajwa. The pair announced in April 2024 that they were expecting their first child together.\n\nIn August 2024, they welcomed their daughter Princess Iman bint Al Hussein bin Abdullah II. The little Princess shares a name with her Aunt, Prince Hussein’s sister.\n\nPrincess Iman bint Abdullah\n\nPrincess Iman bint Abdullah was born in 1996, the second eldest child of King Abdullah and Queen Rania.\n\nThe 27-year-old graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Iman was the first of her siblings to get married, tying the knot with New York financier, Jameel Thermiotis in March 2023.\n\nPrincess Salma bint Abdullah\n\nBorn in 2000, Princess Salma bint Abdullah is the third child of King Abdullah and Queen Rania.\n\nA first lieutenant in the Royal Jordanian Air Force, Salma became Jordan’s first female pilot after she graduated from The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst.\n\nToday, at 23 years old, she is accompanying other military personnel, as they drop aid to the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza.\n\nPrince Hashem bin Abdullah\n\nThe youngest of King Abdullah and Queen Rania’s four children, Prince Hashem bin Abdullah was born in 2005.\n\nIn 2023, after a huge year of weddings and other graduations, the whole family came together to watch the second in line to the Jordanian throne graduate from King’s Academy.\n\nKing Hussein bin Talal\n\nBefore His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, his father King Hussein bin Talal was sovereign. The late King was known for his peaceful and stable approach to ruling Jordan. His people remember him as “The Humane King”. King Hussein strived throughout his 47-year reign to promote peace in the Middle East.\n\nKing Hussein bin Talal was married four times throughout his life and fathered 11 children. His final marriage was to Queen Noor in 1978, an American philanthropist of Jordanian decent."
