        "text": "All eyes were on Jordan this week as Crown Prince Hussein married Rajwa Al Saif, now Princess Rajwa, in a spectacular wedding that featured royalty from all around the world (and so many tiaras!). The wedding, hosted by Hussein's parents King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, called back to their own royal wedding nearly 30 years ago to the day.\n\nOn June 10, 1993, Abdullah—then Prince Abdullah bin Al-Hussein—married Rania Al-Yassin. Rania, then 22, was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents, and had met Abdullah at a dinner party just six months earlier. At the time of their wedding, Abdullah was not expected to inherit the throne. Now the King and Queen of Jordan, Rania and Abdullah have four children: Prince Hussein, Princess Iman, Princess Salma, and Prince Hashem. Princess Iman got married earlier this year, and Prince Hussein, as Crown Prince and heir to the throne, had a wedding that was similar to that of his parents.\n\nHere, see how the two weddings compare:"
