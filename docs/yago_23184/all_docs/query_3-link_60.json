        "text": "King Hussein of Jordan decreed on Monday that his eldest son, Prince Abdullah, would be next in line for the throne, Jordanian officials said.\n\nThe King, 63, has already told his brother, Prince Hassan, that his position as designated heir, as signified by the title Crown Prince, is ending after 34 years.\n\nPrince Abdullah, who will soon turn 37, is a major general in the army and leads Jordan's special forces. He is said to share his father's common touch and is popular within the military, where support for the monarchy is deeply rooted.\n\nIn a public letter to his brother published early today, the King suggested that Prince Hassan's actions had led to his removal. He accused his brother of trying to exert influence over the army, and criticized what he said had been the Prince's opposition to his plans for longterm succession.\n\nA separate copy of the royal decree, also published today, designated Prince Abdullah as the new Crown Prince with ''all rights and priveleges.''\n\nUntil less than a week ago, when the King returned from six months of cancer treatment abroad, few in Jordan had doubted that his brother would be next to assume the crown. The change in successors could have more than a ceremonial effect on this tiny country, which has been ruled by King Hussein for 47 years. Jordan's stability is of concern to its neighbors, from Israel to Iraq. Among its biggest challenges are the deepening unpopularity of the peace with Israel, signed by the King in 1994 against the wishes of most Jordanians, and widening concerns about the economy, which has been in a crisis for most of the last decade.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
