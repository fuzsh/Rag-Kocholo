        "text": "Known as the Hashemites, the Jordanian royal family have ruled Jordan since 1921. They hail from the House of Hashem, which ruled Mecca from as early as the 10th century.\n\nHere’s absolutely everything you need to know about the big Arab wedding everybody is talking about …\n\nHussein and Rajwa’s Islamic wedding ceremony\n\nHussein and Al Saif were married in an Islamic ceremony known as katb ktab. The event, held at Zahran Palace, was attended by around 140 guests. According to custom, it began with King Abdullah II and Queen Rania welcoming guests.\n\nThe Jordanian Armed Forces Musical Band performed during the arrival of high-profile dignitaries. After Hussein joined guests at a gazebo in the palace garden, Al Saif, who was escorted by the prince’s younger brother Prince Hashem bin Abdullah II and younger sister Princess Salma bint Abdullah II, entered the gazebo.\n\nThe gazebo’s arched walls and carved stone columns reflect the Islamic styles seen at the palace. The decor included simple greenery and seasonal plants, showcasing the Jordanian ecosystem.\n\nThe bride and groom signed a marriage contract during the ceremony. Royal Hashemite Court Imam Dr. Ahmed Al Khalaileh presided over the ceremony, speaking about the importance of marriage in Islam.\n\nAfter the official ceremony was concluded, women performed the zaghrata, a ululation to express happiness.\n\nZahran Palace\n\nPrincess Rajwa’s stunning wedding dress\n\nThe bride also stunned guests with her decision to wear d’Orsay style flats.\n\nThe princess wore her hair in loose curls with a diamond tiara and matching earrings.\n\nThe bride’s second look\n\nThe newly crowned princess donned a second gown for the wedding banquet. This ball gown was more elaborate, with floral swirls around the skirt giving it a 3D effect. She wore her hair up with a diamond tiara and long opera gloves.\n\nCrown Prince Hussein’s outfit inspiration\n\nThe crown prince looked dashing in a suit that the palace said drew inspiration from the design worn by King Abdullah II on his wedding day. The sleeves pay homage to the legacy of the Hashemites, displaying styles worn by both King Abdullah II and King Abdullah I.\n\nThe luxury car\n\nThe marriage procession\n\nAfter the Islamic marriage ceremony concluded, the newlyweds made their way to Al Husseiniya Palace as part of the country’s celebratory red motorcade. They rode a 1984 Range Rover that was customised for the late Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Range Rover is named “Sheer Rover” and has been elongated with an added cut-off roof. It was previously in the Royal Automobile Museum but was recommissioned for the wedding.\n\nKing Abdullah I, the country’s founder, started what is now known as the red motorcade. He would arrive at events atop a white horse accompanied by riders dressed in dark blue pants and red blazers.\n\nToday, the red motorcade is used for special occasions like the opening of parliament and Independence Day. Motorcade members wear full Jordanian military regalia and the shemagh, the national red and white checkered headdress. The motorcade has eight Land Rovers, 11 motorcycles, horses and camels. The Jordanian Armed Forces Musical Band with bagpipes is also part of the procession.\n\nAl Husseiniya Palace\n\nUpon arrival at the palace, a procession known as a zaffeh took place. This is when people clap, sing and play the drums in celebration. The couple passed through the Arch of Sabers towards a main stage where they were joined by King Abdullah II and Queen Rania to greet around 1,700 guests for the reception.\n\nGuests entered the reception on a path replicating the Jordanian dessert. There was also a 20-metre-long handwoven traditional Bedouin rug, which was created especially for the wedding. Inside the reception, guests were treated to native olive trees surrounded by a display of dates, representing the Jordanian and Saudi cultures.\n\nThe wedding banquet took place after the couple cut the cake while fireworks went off in the background. It combined elements of a diplomatic event as well as traditions followed at a wedding.\n\nPrince William and Princess Catherine joined the high-profile guest list\n\nThere was much speculation about whether the Prince and Princess of Wales would attend the royal wedding.\n\nTheir attendance was only confirmed a few hours before the ceremony got under way, reports AP. Princess Beatrice and husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi also made an appearance.\n\nIt was a sight to behold as the world’s royals gathered together for the big event.\n\nAnd they were all looking stylish as ever.\n\nQueen Rania stunned in Dior\n\nTown & Country reports that for her son’s wedding ceremony, Queen Rania opted for a black-and-gold gown from Dior’s autumn/winter 22 couture collection. It had wide cuffs, wrist embellishments and a high-neck collar.\n\nShe accessorised with gold dangling earrings and a gold handbag."
