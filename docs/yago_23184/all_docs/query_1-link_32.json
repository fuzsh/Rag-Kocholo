        "text": "The Jordanian royal court announced the engagement of Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan, the eldest son of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, and Saudi Arabian architect Rajwa Al Saif, now Princess Rajwa in August 2022. Less than a year later, on 1 June 2023, the couple exchanged vows in a breathtaking royal wedding attended by international royals including the Prince and Princess of Wales, who made an unannounced appearance. Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi were also among the glittering guests. Here, Tatler remembers the majesty of the day…\n\nRead More\n\nThe Princess of Wales sparkles in rose pink Jenny Packham at Jordanian royal wedding banquet\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales bowed and curtsied to King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan as they arrived alongside other royals for the lavish banquet at Al Husseiniya Palace, following Crown Prince Hussein’s marriage ceremony\n\nThe bride looked radiant in a custom white gown designed by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, featuring an asymmetrical neckline and a sweeping white train embroidered with flowers. Despite speculation that she may not opt to wear a tiara, she was wearing a sparkling diadem to fix her flowing veil in place. She walked down the aisle accompanied by her new brother-in-law, Prince Hashem bin Abdullah, the younger brother of Crown Prince Hussein. Her sisters-in-law Princess Iman and Princess Salma followed behind and sorted her veil as she made her grand entrance.\n\nThe wedding took place at 4pm on Thursday 1 June in the gardens of Zahran Palace, in the capital of Amman – the venue of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania’s wedding in 1993. Later, the wedding party processed through the streets to the modern Al Husseiniya Palace, where the newlyweds are set to receive guests before an evening banquet for 1,700. Performances will pay tribute to Crown Prince Hussein’s military career and the bride’s Saudi Arabian heritage.\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan at 53: celebrating her 53 best style moments in honour of her birthday\n\nRead More\n\nBuilt in 1957 in west Amman, Zahran Palace serves as a headquarters for the Hashemite Court and is where official functions, including royal weddings, are held. Al Husseiniya Palace, meanwhile, was built in 2006 and houses the offices of the king and queen, and the crown prince. It is also a popular venue for royal occasions, including the henna party for Princess Iman of Jordan, Crown Prince Hussein's sister, earlier this year.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAmong the international royals in attendance were King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark, who represented Queen Margrethe II; King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands; and Princess Takamado of Japan, who represented Emperor Naruhito. The guests were greeted on arrival by King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, who looked stunning in a Dior gown.\n\nThe fact that Prince William and Princess Catherine attended is a testament to the close ties between the UK and Jordan (King Abdullah II and Queen Rania also attended the Coronation of King Charles III). Prince William and Crown Prince Hussein are both graduates of Sandhurst and have spent time together over the years – including watching the World Cup in 2018.\n\nQueen Rania, who has a close relationship with her daughter-in-law, also posted a selection of photographs. One image shows the queen and bride-to-be walking hand-in-hand through the party, reflecting their close bond. Another shows Rajwa wiping away a tear as Queen Rania delivers a moving speech.\n\nFor the henna party, Rajwa wore an intricate white and gold creation by HONAYDA, from her home country of Saudi Arabia. ‘For Miss Rajwa, a two-piece Najdi dress known as the Sahabi Thoub, was designed for the occasion, bridging the past and present infusing the bride’s heritage in a fully handcrafted veil and dress flourishing through 3D ornaments with a mix of silk, metallic threads and traditional reed strings featuring the iconic palm of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,’ the designer explained on Instagram. ‘Seven stars are exclusively featured in the veil, symbolizing the 7-pointed Jordanian star. The veil pays homage to the couple’s eternal love story, in a famous verse of Tunisian poet Abu al-Qasim al Shabi translating the beauty of life at one’s sight.’ Typically refined, Queen Rania of Jordan opted for a soft blue bespoke gown by Saiid Kobeisy, paired with breathtaking diamond earrings."
