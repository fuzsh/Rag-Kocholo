Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary were also in attendance, a pair who have been at the forefront of royal discussions this year, since Frederik’s mother Queen Margrethe’s shock abdication on New Year’s Eve. So, all the major players were out for the celebration in Jordan.\n\nAnd now, it has been announced the couple are going to have a baby. The news was revealed today by the Jordanian Royal Family in a statement, which said: ‘The Royal Hashemite Court is pleased to announce that Their Royal Highnesses Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince, and Princess Rajwa Al Hussein, are expecting, with God’s help and grace, their first child, in the summer of this year.\n\nRead More\n\nAs Nicola Peltz Beckham celebrates her wedding anniversary, Tatler revisits her August 2022 cover where she opened up about marriage to Brooklyn\n\nBig-screen success, A-list connections and a glamorous surname.

In January, Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan and Princess Rajwa made a rare public appearance as they set off on an official visit to Singapore. The pair attended the launch of the Jordan-Singapore Tech Alliance Forum, an event organised by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship, Jordan’s embassy in Singapore, the Singapore Business Federation, and SH Tech. Prince Hussein was a major feature at the event, making a speech to outline how Jordan ‘aspires to be a rising force on the global tech scene.’"
