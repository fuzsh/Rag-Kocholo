        "text": "\"A mum and a wife with a really cool day job.\"\n\nThat's how Queen Rania describes herself to her combined 17 million followers on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIt's a humble way of explaining her role as Queen Consort of Jordan, a role she was never meant to have — but in a strange twist of fate, that's what happened when she found herself crowned the world's youngest queen aged just 28.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Charlene of Monaco: A closer look at the enigmatic royal\n\nNow, 52 (her birthday is August 31) Rania has spent the time in her exalted position to improve the lives of her people with a special focus on refugees, influenced by her Palestinian family's escape from war-torn Kuwait.\n\nRania is the world's most high-profile Arab woman, and Muslim royal, and has become a global activist.\n\nShe is probably best known for her glamorous outfits, with her Instagram often looking like that of a model's instead of a queen's. But Rania is more than her beauty, and her humanitarian work is a proven track record that she means business.\n\nRania the humanitarian\n\nShe is married to King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom, a small country that shares borders with Syria, Iraq and Israel/Palestine.\n\nJordan has become the face of the global humanitarian crisis, having taken in more refugees than all of Europe.\n\nFor Rania, it is vital her husband kept the borders open when the mass exodus began in 2011, rather than turning his back like so many other world leaders have done.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Rania praises Queen Elizabeth as an 'inspiration'\n\n\"Does my husband order his soldiers to close the borders? How is he going to sleep at night? It was never a question of yes or no, it was always a question of how are we going to make it work,\" Queen Rania told The Times in 2017.\n\nSpeaking of her husband, she says: \"Seeing every challenge we face and how he handled it, I become a bigger fan of his\".\n\nRania hasn't shied away from visiting the thousands of refugees living in camps in Jordan — it is home to the world's biggest camp outside Africa — along with others abroad, including the Kara Tepe refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.\n\nShe has used her global platform to call for more humanity in dealing with what she describes as a situation with none \"more heartbreaking and urgent\".\n\n\"There is a whole generation of children under seven growing up knowing nothing but war and loss,\" she says.\n\nShe has taken part in numerous related global events, including co-chairing a roundtable at the 2016 UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants, and has accepted countless humanitarian awards.\n\nHer own humble beginnings\n\nBorn Rania Al Yassin on August 31, 1970, in Kuwait, her family were Palestinian refugees. In 1991, during the first Gulf War, they were forced to flee Kuwait and settled in Jordan's capital, Amman.\n\nAt the time, Rania was doing an MBA in Cairo and joined them, before finding a job in marketing at Citibank before moving to Apple, where she worked in marketing.\n\nIt was 1993 when she first met Prince Abdullah, the eldest son of King Hussein of Jordan. A friend had invited her to a dinner party the prince was attending, and they married just six months later.\n\nThe unexpected Queen\n\nRania never expected her husband to become king. He wasn't even a crown prince when they met.\n\nKing Hussein ruled alongside his fourth wife, American-born Lisa Halaby, known as Queen Noor, and his brother Hassan was crown prince.\n\nBut six years after Rania and Prince Abdullah married, the king fell gravely ill with cancer and had a major change of heart.\n\nREAD MORE: Royals who have married commoners: 'Why royal weddings to \"normal\" people fascinate us'\n\nIn 1999, the king, on his deathbed, sent his brother, who was acting as regent, a letter accusing him of slandering the royal family and meddling with the army. The king then named Abdullah as heir instead and two weeks later, he died.\n\nAbdullah was king and Jordan had a new, very glamorous Muslim queen who didn't wear a hijab.\n\n\"It was a big shock to me,\" Rania said in a previous interview with Oprah's magazine.\n\n\"First of all, to lose the king, whom we all loved so much. And then, the other thing.\"\n\nShe added: \"You think it is like a fairy tale. It sounds like a fairy tale. But in fact, it is not a fairy tale. Being queen is overrated.\"\n\nRania the mother\n\nQueen Rania and King Abdullah have four children: Crown Prince Al Hussein, 28, Princess Iman, 25, Princess Salma, 21, and Prince Hashem, 17.\n\nThey live at the Al Husseiniya palace in Amman.\n\nIt's been a big year for Rania and her family.\n\nRecently, Crown Prince Al Hussein announced his engagement to Rajwa Khaled bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz Al Saif.\n\nAnd weeks earlier, Princess Iman bint Abdullah II announced her engagement to New York financier Jameel Alexander Thermiotis.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Rania shares special photos for her husband and son's birthdays\n\nIn her interview with The Times, Rania joked that being a mother was often tougher than her role as queen.\n\n\"Sometimes, trying to convince the kids to finish their homework is harder than some of the issues I deal with in the office. Being a parent really hones your negotiating skills.\"\n\nIn February 2019, Rania spoke about the struggle to protect her children from online bullies and how she juggles being a mother to a future king.\n\n\"When my kids started becoming old enough to be on social media and on the internet, as a mum my protective antennae shot up,\" Queen Rania told Harper's Bazaar Arabia.\n\n\"But then I realised that snooping around is not going to be helpful because it will erode the trust between us and they will stop sharing things with me, so I'd rather we have an open dialogue.\n\n\"I tell my kids to spend less of their lives on the phone and more of their lives being in the present, being in nature, picking up a book.\"\n\nShe described how she's trying to raise her son, Crown Prince Hussein, as normally as possible despite his destiny.\n\n\"I want them to be normal kids. Sometimes I feel like I'm swimming against the current because obviously they're royals and people sometimes treat them that way, but I try to make sure that they have an identity outside of their title.\n\n\"I always tell them, 'You carry your title, it doesn't carry you' and to think of it more as a responsibility and not a privilege.\"\n\nRania the fashion icon\n\nIn that same interview, Rania said part of being a queen with a global platform meant putting up with constant commentary on her \"outfits and appearance\".\n\n\"But at the end of the day, I hope it is my work that defines me, not my wardrobe,\" she said.\n\nRania's elegant approach to modest dressing is why she has become a fashion icon, particularly in the Arab world.\n\nHer brands of choice are high end — Dior, Givenchy, Valentino — but she frequently wears Middle Eastern brands, including Lebanese designers Azzi and Osta and clothes by Jordan's Rasha Noufal's boutique Karma Fashion.\n\nIN PICTURES: The best gowns worn by royal women across Europe\n\nShe loves towering heels and designer handbags, but Rania isn't doesn't hesitate to dress down in sneakers and jeans when the occasion calls for it, such as visits to local women's co-operatives and artisan centres.\n\nPart of Rania's role is working to change the perception of Muslim women and break down stereotypes.\n\nOf her decision not to wear a headscarf, she said: \"I really do think that religion is a very personal thing.\n\n\"Many women in my country wear the hijab, and you'll also find many women dressed like me. It just baffles me sometimes that there's a huge debate about an issue that should really be a non-issue.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Queen of style: The royal with multiple ear piercings\n\nIn 2008, Rania created her own YouTube channel aimed at engaging Western viewers in a discussion about their perceptions of the Arab world.\n\n\"The West can help by resisting easy stereotypes of Arab women as submissive and helpless,\" she said. \"They are not, and once we stop seeing them that way we can reach out. Women lift each other up.\"\n\nRania also has multiple ear piercings and has been seen wearing up to four pairs at once.\n\nHer push for better education\n\nRania has become a powerful advocate for reform in education and youth empowerment, especially women.\n\n\"I always find that, with women, if you empower them a little bit, they lift everyone around them,\" she said.\n\n\"Education for girls is the best investment you can make, because the ripple effect affects so many issues — health, child mortality, economic empowerment all benefit when you give girls an education.\"\n\nShe created the Queen Rania Foundation for Education and Development including one of its initiatives, the Queen Rania Teacher Academy.\n\nNot only working for Jordanians, Rania is also a global voice for access to quality education for children around the world and has served as a Global Honorary Chair of the UN Girl's Education Initiative.\n\nThe Queen Rania Family and Children Centre has helped hundreds of young people from Jordanian, Palestinian and Syrian backgrounds, along with hundreds of refugees, with holistic therapies to combat the stress of gender based violence.\n\nThe young girls are educated on topics which have often been taboo in the region, including personal hygiene, personal space and emotional intelligence.\n\nQueen Rania has written four children's books; the most recent one, The Sandwich Swap (2010), was a New York Times bestseller and was inspired by her own childhood.\n\nHer work with the environment has also strengthened her already-firm friendship with the British royal family.\n\nRania and the British royals\n\nThe Jordanian royals and the British royals have long had close ties, with both King Abdullah and his eldest son being graduates of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst — much like Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nQueen Rania recently spoke of her admiration for Queen Elizabeth when Prince Charles and Camilla visited Jordan in November.\n\n\"I think the whole world turns to her as a symbol of what it means to be a true figurehead and stateswoman and giving inspiration to the rest of the world through her discipline, through her hard work, through her steady approach to everything,\" Rania told ITV.\n\n\"I think we all find comfort when we think of her.\"\n\nRania praised the British royal family for their work in campaigning on the environment and described Prince Charles as \"a leading figure in the fight for our planet\".\n\nRecently she partnered with Prince William for his landmark Earthshot Prize, sitting on the Earthshot Council to ultimately decide the winners of the £1 million prize ($1.8 million AUD) to find solutions to some of the world's most pressing climate issues.\n\nPerhaps the Duchess of Cornwall summed up Rania's mission best while in Jordan last year. Camilla referenced a speech previously made by Rania at the Women of the World in November.\n\n\"Some wise words, from Queen Rania, that are particularly apt for this occasion,\" the Duchess began.\n\n\"Her Majesty once said, 'When a woman succeeds, she reaches out to those around her and pulls them up with her. That is why if you empower a woman, you empower a whole society'.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
