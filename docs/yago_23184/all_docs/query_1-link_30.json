        "text": "Update: Prince Hussein married Rajwa Al Saif, now Princess Rajwa by royal decree, in an intimate ceremony at Zahran Palace and a larger, glamorous reception at Al Husseiniya Palace. See all the photos from Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa's wedding here. Below, the original story on their engagement.\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan's eldest son, Crown Prince Hussein, is set to be married soon! The royal family announced in August 2022 that the prince was engaged to Rajwa Khaled bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz Al Saif, and recently, the royals shared that the two will tie the knot on June 1, 2023. Their wedding will take place at Zahran Palace, and a reception will be held at Al Husseiniya Palace.\n\n\"The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah on this occasion, and wishes His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif a lifetime of happiness,\" they wrote in a statement sharing the wedding date, along with a new portrait of the couple.\n\nAccording to Prince Hussein's website, he proposed at Rajwa's family's home in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the presence of members of the royal family, including Hussein's parents, Queen Rania and King Abdullah.\n\nTo celebrate the news, Hussein shared a photo of himself and his bride-to-be, writing, \"Alhamdullillah. We pray that God grants us His blessings. Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes\"\n\nMany fans immediately noted a similarity between the pleated navy dress Rajwa wore in the photos and the famous navy dress that Kate Middleton wore when she and Prince William officially announced their own engagement back in 2010.\n\nQueen Rania made her own posts to Instagram congratulating the happy couple, including a carousel of photos from the engagement.\n\n\"I didn’t think it was possible to hold so much joy in my heart!\" she wrote. \"Congratulations to my eldest Prince Hussein and his beautiful bride-to-be, Rajwa\"\n\nShe also shared a photo of herself and Rajwa with the caption, \"Excited to welcome my third daughter, Al Hussein’s bride-to-be, Rajwa, to the family! We’re so happy for you both.\"\n\nWhile she's not yet as well known as her royal fiancee, according to Harper's Bazaar Arabia, Rajwa is the youngest daughter of Saudi businessman Khalid bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz al-Saif and his wife, Azza bint Nayef Abdulaziz Ahmed al-Sudairi. Raised in Sauda Arabia, she has a bachelor's degree from the College of Architecture at Syracuse University in New York as well as a degree in Visual Communications from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, and previously worked at an architecture firm in L.A. (Read more about Rajwa Al Saif here.)\n\nPrince Hussein's engagement news came just weeks after his younger sister Princess Iman shared the news of her engagement to Jameel Alexander Thermiotis. Princess Iman married Jameel in March 2023.\n\nAt Prince Hussein and Rajwa's wedding in June, royalty from around the world is expected to be in attendance. The first to confirm they will be attending were Japan's Princess Hisako and Princess Tsuguko; other royals who have RSVP'd \"yes\" include Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, Prince Frederik and Princess Mary of Denmark, and King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands. Festivities for the wedding began on May 22, with a henna party Queen Rania hosted for her future daughter-in-law.\n\nOn the wedding day itself, the Islamic wedding ceremony (the katb ktab) will take place at Zahran Palace, and after, the newlyweds will travel in a motorcade procession to Al Husseiniya Palace. There, the reception and a royal banquet will take place."
