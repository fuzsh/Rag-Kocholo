        "text": "\"Queen of Jordan\" redirects here. For the \"30 Rock\" episode, see Queen of Jordan (30 Rock).\n\nThis is a list of the women who have been queen/princess consort of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan since the emirate was elevated to the status of a kingdom in 1949. As all monarchs of Jordan have been required by law to be male, there has never been a queen regnant of Jordan although the law can be bypassed by royal decree.\n\nIt is necessary for the king to give his wife the title of queen consort after his accession and their marriage; otherwise she would only have the lesser title of princess consort. Only one Jordanian consort has not held the title of queen during her marriage.\n\nList of royal consorts\n\nImage Born as Consort as Born Marriage Consort from Consort to Died Spouse to Musbah bint Nasser Queen Musbah 1884 1904 25 May 1946\n\nJordan elevated to kingdom 20 July 1951\n\nhusband's death 15 March 1961 Abdullah I Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil Queen Zein 2 August 1916 27 November 1934 20 July 1951\n\nhusband became king 11 August 1952\n\nhusband's abdication 26 April 1994 Talal Dina bint Abdul-Hamid Queen Dina 15 December 1929 18 April 1955 24 June 1957\n\ndivorced 21 August 2019 Hussein Toni Avril Gardiner Princess Muna 25 April 1941 25 May 1961 21 December 1972\n\ndivorced living Alia Toukan Queen Alia 25 December 1948 24 December 1972 9 February 1977\n\nher death Lisa Halaby Queen Noor 23 August 1951 15 June 1978 7 February 1999\n\nhusband died living Rania Al-Yassin Queen Rania 31 August 1970 10 June 1993 7 February 1999\n\nhusband became king incumbent Abdullah II\n\nSee also"
