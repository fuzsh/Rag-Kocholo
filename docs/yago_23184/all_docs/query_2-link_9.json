        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2023\n\nOn June 1, 2023, Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan married Rajwa Al Saif at Zahran Palace in Amman, Jordan.\n\nYouTube: The Wedding Ceremony of Their Royal Highness Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince, and Princess Rajwa Al-Hussein\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Index\n\nCrown Prince Hussein of Jordan\n\nCrown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah of Jordan was born at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan on June 28, 1994, the eldest child of the then Prince Abdullah bin Hussein and Rania al Yassin. His father was the eldest son of King Hussein I of Jordan and his second wife Princess Muna al-Hussein, born Antoinette Gardiner in the United Kingdom. When King Hussein I died on February 7, 1999, Abdullah became King of Jordan and respected his father’s wishes, appointing his half-brother Hamzah Crown Prince. In 2004, King Abdullah II stripped Hamzah of the Crown Prince title. As he did not name a replacement, this made Hussein his father’s heir-apparent under the existing succession laws. On July 2, 2009, King Abdullah II issued a decree formally granting Hussein the title of Crown Prince.\n\nCrown Prince Hussein has three younger siblings:\n\nPrincess Iman (born 1996), married Jameel Thermiotis, born Dimitrios Alejandro Thermiótis Hernández\n\nPrincess Salma (born 2000)\n\nPrince Hashem (born 2005)\n\nCrown Prince Hussein completed his secondary education at King’s Academy in Madaba-Manja, Jordan in 2012. In 2016, the Crown Prince graduated from Georgetown University in Washington DC with a degree in international history. In August 2017, Crown Prince Hussein graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, a family tradition.\n\nCrown Prince Hussein often attends state and military functions with his father and takes an active interest in the welfare of the Jordanian people. He has also served as Regent when his father is out of the country.\n\nRajwa Al Saif\n\nBorn in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on April 28, 1994, Rajwa Khaled bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz Al Saif is the youngest of the four children of Khalid Al Saif and his wife Azza Al Sudairi. Rajwa’s father is the CEO of the Al Saif Group, a privately-owned company with a diverse portfolio of healthcare, construction, and security services businesses. Rajwa is a member of the Al Saif family which dates back to the Subai tribe in the town of Al-Attar in Sudair, Najd, Saudi Arabia, where her ancestors were the sheikhs of the town.\n\nAfter completing her primary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia, Rajwa attended the School of Architecture at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, in the United States, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture. In addition, Rajwa also holds a degree in Visual Communications from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, California, in the United States. Rajwa was employed by an architecture firm in Los Angeles, California, and at the time of her engagement, she was employed by Designlab Experience, a design studio in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Engagement\n\nOn August 17, 2022, the Royal Hashemite Court of Jordan announced the engagement of Crown Prince Hussein and Rajwa Al Saif. The engagement ceremony, where Hussein presented Rajwa with a pear-shaped Harry Winston diamond ring, took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at Rajwa’s family home and was attended by members of the Al Saif family and the following members of the Jordanian royal family:\n\nKing Abdullah II and Queen Rania, Crown Prince Hussein’s parents\n\nPrince Hassan bin Talal, Crown Prince Hussein’s paternal great-uncle\n\nPrince Hashem bin Abdullah, Crown Prince Hussein’s brother\n\nPrince Ali bin Al Hussein, Crown Prince Hussein’s paternal half-uncle\n\nPrince Hashim bin Al Hussein, Crown Prince Hussein’s paternal half-uncle\n\nPrince Ghazi bin Muhammad, Crown Prince Hussein’s paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrince Rashid bin El Hassan, Crown Prince Hussein’s paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPre-Wedding Celebrations\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Queen Rania hosted a traditional henna party in honor of Rajwa Al Saif at the\n\nMadareb Bani Hashem, located at Raghadan Palace. A henna party, a significant pre-wedding celebration that many cultures celebrate, is usually held several days before the wedding. The bride, her female relatives, and her friends celebrate the upcoming wedding by having a professional henna artist apply beautiful, elaborate designs on their hands and feet. Older women may offer guidance and wisdom to the bride-to-be as she begins her married life.\n\nRajwa’s henna party was a joyous affair, with traditional music and dancing. Traditional Jordanian and Saudi songs were performed by Nedaa Shrara, Diana Karazon, and Zain Awad, with performances by the Haleem Musical Group, the Al-Salt Girls Band, and the Misk Dance Company. The henna party was followed by a dinner hosted by Queen Rania, who gave a speech in honor of her soon-to-be daughter-in-law.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Hussein’s first cousin Prince Omar bin Faisal, hosted a groom’s shower attended by male relatives and friends. That evening, King Abdullah II hosted a dinner party in honor of the wedding at the Royal Madareb Bani Hashem, located at Raghadan Palace. Over 4,000 male guests attended the dinner party that showcased the culture of Jordan’s Hashemite rulers. The guests included representatives of Jordan’s tribes, Circassian and Chechen communities, members of civil society organizations, businesspeople, youth figures, former and current government officials, and army and security agencies personnel.\n\nWedding Guests – A Partial List\n\nThere were 140 guests at the wedding ceremony and over 1,700 guests at the wedding reception so not all the guests attended the wedding ceremony.

Prince Hashem (age 18) escorted Rajwa, Princess Iman (age 26) and Princess Salma (age 22) followed behind the bride, fixing her dress train and veil as she made her way through the garden to the gazebo. Rajwa walked down the aisle accompanied by Prince Hashem. Princess Iman and Princess Salma followed behind, adjusting the bride’s train several times. Rajwa sat next to Hussein, close to her father.\n\nRoyal Hashemite Court Imam Dr. Ahmed Al Khalaileh, who was appointed to his position in January 2021, presided over the wedding ceremony. Hussein and Rajwa signed the marriage contracts with their fathers acting as their two witnesses. In addition, Prince Hassan, King Hussein’s I’s only surviving brother and Crown Prince Hussein’s great-uncle, signed the marriage contract.\n\nBefore exchanging rings, Hussein and Rajwa recited the first verse from the Quran: “In the name of God (Allah), the Compassionate and Merciful. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, the Compassionate and Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgement. Thee we worship and from Thee we seek help. Guide us upon the straight path, the path of those whom Thou hast blessed, not of those who incur wrath, nor of those who are astray.”\n\nWhen the wedding ceremony was over, a few women performed the Zaghrata, an ululation traditionally used to express happiness at Jordanian and Arab celebrations. The newlyweds kissed each other on the cheeks and exited to the garden where they greeted the wedding guests. Then they traveled in a motorcade, through the streets of Amman, where huge crowds turned out to greet them, ultimately arriving at Al Husseiniya Palace, where their wedding reception took place.\n\nThe first fifty-five minutes of the YouTube video below show the arrival of the wedding guests, the arrival of the groom and bride, and the wedding ceremony.\n\nYouTube: The wedding ceremony of Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa Al-Hussein\n\nThe Wedding Reception\n\nThe wedding reception was held at Al Husseiniya Palace, which was built in 2006, and houses the offices of King Abdullah II, Queen Rania, and Crown Prince Hussein.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, King Talal.\n\nKing Abdullah I\n\nKing Abdullah was the first King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He was born in February 1882 to the Emir of Mecca and his first wife. Following the Great Arab Revolt in 1916, Abdullah was named King of Iraq but refused the throne. The Iraqi throne went instead to his brother Faisal. In 1921, Abdullah was recognized by the United Kingdom as Emir of Transjordan, a British protectorate. In 1946, Transjordan ceased to be a British protectorate and became the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (later renamed Jordan in 1949), with Abdullah as its first King. He had three wives and five children, including his successor, King Talal. The only Arab ruler to accept the UN’s plan for Palestine, Abdullah later took part in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, annexing the territories of the West Bank captured by Jordanian troops in Palestine. He later entered into secret peace negotiations with Israel, which likely led to his assassination.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Abdullah I of Jordan\n\nThe Assassin – Mustafa Shukri Ashu\n\nMustafa Shukri Ashu was a 21-year-old tailor’s apprentice, who was described as a “former terrorist” and had been recruited to kill the King. While he was the one who pulled the trigger, ten men were tried for the part in the assassination, including Colonel Abdullah at-Tell who had been the Governor of Jerusalem, and Musa Ahmad al-Ayubbi, a vegetable merchant. At-Tell and al-Ayubbi were found guilty and sentenced to death, despite having fled the country.\n\nThe Assassination\n\nOn July 16, 1951, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Riad Bey Al Solh, was assassinated in Amman, Jordan. Four days later, on July 20, King Abdullah, accompanied by his grandson, the future King Hussein I of Jordan, traveled to Jerusalem to attend Al Solh’s funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque. While waiting for Friday prayers to begin, the king was approached by a Palestinian activist Mustafa Shukri Ashu who fired three shots, hitting the king in the chest and head and killing him instantly. The young Hussein was also caught in the gunfire, miraculously escaping harm when a bullet ricocheted off a medal he was wearing at his grandfather’s insistence.\n\nWhat happened to King Abdullah?\n\nKing Abdullah I died instantly from his wounds. His body was returned quickly to Amman, where his funeral and burial took place. As his son and successor King Talal was in a hospital in Switzerland being treated for mental illness, Abdullah’s second son, Naif, was appointed as Regent until Talal could return to Jordan. Naif, along with the Regent of Iraq, presided over the funeral services, after which Abdullah’s body was interred in a mausoleum at the Royal cemetery near Raghadan Palace.\n\nJust a year later, King Talal was forced to abdicate due to his mental illness and was succeeded by his eldest son King Hussein, who was just 16 years old at the time.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was the eldest of the two children of Sharif Jamal bin Nasser, Governor of Hauran and Wijdan Hanim. Her father was the nephew of Sharif Hussein bin Ali of Mecca (the father of King Abdullah I of Jordan) and her mother was the daughter of Shakir Pasha, Governor of Cyprus. Zein had one brother and one sister:\n\nSharif Nasser bin Jamal (1927 – 1979), Commander-in-Chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces\n\nSharifa Nafea bint Jamal\n\nOn November 27, 1934, Zein married her first cousin Prince Talal bin Abdullah, the eldest son of the future King Abdullah I of Jordan. The couple had six children:\n\nKing Hussein I of Jordan (1935 – 1999), married (1) Dina bint ‘Abdu’l-Hamid (Queen Dina), divorced 1957, no children (2) Antoinette Avril Gardiner (Princess Muna), divorced 1971, had four children including King Abdullah II of Jordan (3) Alia Baha el-Din Toukan (Queen Alia), died in a helicopter crash, had two children (2) Lisa Halaby (Queen Noor), had four children\n\nPrincess Asma bint Talal (born and died 1937)\n\nPrince Muhammad bin Talal (1940 – 2021), married (1) Firyal Irshaid, had two sons (2) Taghrid Majali, daughter of the late Hazza’ al-Majali, Prime Minister of Jordan, no children\n\nPrince Hassan bin Talal (1947 – ), married Sarvath Ikramullah, had one son and three daughters\n\nPrince Muhsin bin Talal, died young\n\nPrincess Basma bint Talal (1951 – ), married (1) Colonel Timoor Daghistani, had two children (2) Walid al-Kurdi, had two children\n\nOn July 20, 1951, Talal’s father, King Abdullah I of Jordan was assassinated as he entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem, probably because of his moderate attitude towards Israel. The assassin was Mustapha Shukri Usho, a 21-year-old tailor from Jerusalem who belonged to a group that wanted to prevent a permanent division of Palestine by Jordan and Israel. King Abdullah had been accompanied by Zein’s 15-year-old eldest son, the future King Hussein I of Jordan. Hussein was at his grandfather’s side and was hit too, but a medal that had been pinned to Hussein’s chest at his grandfather’s insistence deflected the bullet and saved his life.\n\nAt the time of his father’s death, Talal was in a sanatorium in Switzerland being treated for a nervous breakdown. At first, it was unsure whether Talal would succeed his father due to his mental condition, but on September 5, 1951, he was proclaimed King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Zein became Queen Zein al-Sharaf Talal. On June 4, 1952, the Jordanian Cabinet announced that it was necessary to form a Regency Council because Talal’s condition had worsened despite the treatment he was receiving in Switzerland. The Jordanian Parliament declared Talal mentally unfit on August 11, 1952, and proclaimed his eldest son Hussein as king.\n\nQueen Zein played a major role in the formation of the Jordanian state. In 1944, Zein founded the first women’s association in Jordan. She established the women’s branch of the Jordanian Red Crescent (affiliated with the Red Cross) in 1948 and organized assistance to Palestinian refugees during the Arab-Israeli war in 1949. She participated in the writing of the Jordan Constitution in 1952, which guaranteed women’s rights. After the assassination of King Abdullah I in 1951, Zein held the power while the newly proclaimed King Talal was treated outside the country. She again took the reins of power in August 1952, when her son Hussein was proclaimed king, until May 1953, when he turned eighteen and assumed full constitutional duties. During the reign of her son, King Hussein I, Zein was an influential figure behind the scenes.\n\nQueen Zein died on April 26, 1994, at the age of 86 in a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland where she was being treated for a heart ailment. She was buried the next day at the Royal Cemetery, near Raghadan Palace within the Royal Compound (Al-Maquar).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In 1921, Transjordan became an autonomous division of Palestine under the leadership of Sharif Abdullah bin al-Hussein who then became Emir of Transjordan. Abdullah bin al-Hussein was the son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif and Emir of Mecca, who was instrumental in starting the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In 1916, Hussein bin Ali proclaimed himself King of Hejaz, a region of present-day Saudi Arabia, and also declared himself King of all Arabs. This last move enraged another Arab leader, Abdul Aziz Al Saud, who defeated Hussein bin Ali in 1924, caused him to abdicate the throne of Hejaz, and then became the first King of Saudi Arabia. Hussein bin Ali’s three sons all became kings: Ali was briefly King of Hejaz, Abdullah was King of Jordan, and Faisal was King of Iraq and Syria. Faisal was an important figure in the revolt against the Ottoman Empire and received assistance from British Army Captain T. E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia. In 1946, Transjordan became a kingdom, Emir Abdullah was proclaimed the king and the name of the country was changed from the Emirate of Transjordan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. In 1948, the Parliament of Transjordan approved the creation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which is the complete name of the country.\n\nKing Abdullah I of Jordan was the first King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He was born His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah bin al-Hussein of Mecca and Hejaz in February 1882 in Mecca, Hejaz, Ottoman Empire, the third of the five children and the second of three sons of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif and Emir of Mecca and his first wife Abdiyya Khanum. Mecca is now in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAbdullah had four full siblings:\n\nPrince Ali, the last King of Hejaz (1879 – 1935), married Nafissa Khanum, had one son and four daughters\n\nHasan bin Hussein, died young\n\nPrincess Fatima, married a Muslim businessman from France\n\nFaisal I, King of Iraq and Syria (1885 – 1933), married to Huzaima bint Nasser, had one son and three daughters\n\nAbdullah had one half-sister from his father’s second wife Madiha Khanum:\n\nPrincess Saleha, married Abdullah bin Muhammed\n\nAbdullah had one half-sister and one half-brother from his father’s third wife Adila Khanum:\n\nPrincess Sara, married Muhammad Atta Amin in July 1933, divorced in September 1933\n\nPrince Zeid (1898 – 1970), married Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, had one son\n\nAbdullah had three wives. His first wife Musbah bint Nasser was the first Queen Consort of Jordan and Abdullah’s senior wife.\n\nIn 1904, Abdullah married his first wife Musbah bint Nasser. They had three children:\n\nPrincess Haya (1907 – 1990), married Prince Abdul-Karim Ja’afar Zeid Dhaoui\n\nKing Talal I of Jordan (1909 – 1972), married Zein al-Sharaf Talal, had six children including King Hussein I of Jordan\n\nPrincess Munira (1915 – 1987), unmarried\n\nIn 1913, Abdullah married his second wife Suzdil Khanum in 1913. They had two children:\n\nPrince Nayef (1914 – 1983), Princess Mihrimah Selcuk Sultana, had two sons\n\nPrincess Maqbula (1921 – 2001), married Prince Hussein bin Nasser, Prime Minister of Jordan, had one son and one daughter\n\nIn 1949, Abdullah married his third wife Nahda bint Uman in 1949. They had no children.\n\nIn 1916, Abdullah took part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans with his brother Faisal. As a result, Abdullah was proclaimed King of Iraq on March 8, 1920, and on the same day, Faisal was proclaimed King of Syria. However, Abdullah refused the throne of Iraq. After his refusal, Faisal, who had just been defeated in Syria and was in need of a kingdom, accepted the position. In 1921, Abdullah was recognized by the United Kingdom as the Emir of Transjordan under British protectorate. In May 1946, Transjordan was released from the status of a British protectorate and recognized as the independent nation of Jordan. Abdullah became the first King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (renamed the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949). In 1947, Abdullah was the only Arab ruler to accept the United Nation’s plan for Palestine. However, Jordan took part in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and annexed the territories of the West Bank captured by the Jordanian troops in Palestine.\n\nOn July 20, 1951, 69-year-old King Abdullah I of Jordan was assassinated as he entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem, probably because of his moderate attitude towards Israel. The assassin was Mustapha Shukri Usho, a 21-year-old tailor from Jerusalem who belonged to a group that wanted to prevent a permanent division of Palestine by Jordan and Israel. King Abdullah had been accompanied by his 15-year-old grandson, the future King Hussein I of Jordan. Hussein was at his grandfather’s side and was hit too, but a medal that had been pinned to Hussein’s chest at his grandfather’s insistence deflected the bullet and saved his life. King Abdullah’s son succeeded him as King Talal and Talal’s son Hussein was named Crown Prince. However, King Talal suffered from mental illness and was forced to abdicate just a year later. The 16-year-old Crown Prince became King Hussein I with a regency council established until he reached the age of 18.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Assassination of Abdullah I, King of Jordan\n\nKing Abdullah I was buried in a mausoleum at the Royal Cemetery, near Raghadan Palace within the Royal Compound (Al-Maquar).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

At the time, Hussein’s grandfather was the Emir of Transjordan, becoming Abdullah I, the first King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in 1946 (the name was later changed to simply ‘Jordan’). Hussein began his education in Amman, after which he attended Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt. He then attended the Harrow School in England before enrolling in the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.\n\nOn July 21, 1951, Prince Hussein was accompanying his grandfather King Abdullah I to a mosque in Jerusalem when the king was killed by an assassin’s bullet. Hussein was at his side and was hit too, but a medal that had been pinned to Hussein’s chest at his grandfather’s insistence deflected the bullet and saved his life.\n\nWhen his father became King of Jordan, Hussein was named Crown Prince in September 1951. His father King Talal suffered from mental illness and was forced to abdicate just a year later. The 16-year-old Crown Prince became King Hussein I with a regency council established until he reached the age of 18.\n\nKing Hussein’s mother Queen Zein played a major role in the early years of her son’s reign, guiding him in political and personal matters. She arranged his first marriage, when Hussein was just 19 years old, to Sharifa Dina bint ‘Abdu’l-Hamid, a third cousin of his father. The couple separated and were divorced in 1957. They had one daughter: Princess Alia (1956).\n\nThe King married a second time in 1961 to the British-born Antoinette Gardiner, who took the title HRH Princess Muna al-Hussein. This marriage, too, ended in divorce in 1971. The couple had four children: King Abdullah II (1962), Prince Feisal (1963), and twins Princess Aisha (1968) and Princess Zein (1968)\n\nIn December 1972, the King married Alia Baha ad-Din Toukan, the daughter of a Jordanian diplomat. Upon marriage, she became HM Queen Alia al-Hussein. Tragically, Queen Alia was killed in a helicopter crash in 1977. The couple had two children, as well as an adopted daughter: Princess Haya (1974), Prince Ali (1975), and Abir Muhaisen (1972, adopted in 1976).\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Hussein I of Jordan\n\nLisa Halaby’s Background\n\nLisa Najeeb Halaby was born on August 23, 1951, in Washington DC in the United States, the eldest child of Najeeb Halaby and Doris Carlquist. Her father, of Syrian descent, held several prominent positions including head of the Federal Aviation Administration and CEO of the airline Pan Am. Coming from an affluent family, Lisa attended private schools: The National Cathedral School in Washington DC, The Chapin School in New York City, and Concord Academy in Massachusetts. She attended Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, as a member of the first coeducational class, graduating in 1974 with a degree in architecture and urban planning.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Noor of Jordan\n\nThe Engagement\n\nIn the winter of 1976, Lisa Halaby traveled with her father Najeeb Halaby, then the chairman of the International Advisory Board for Royal Jordanian Airlines, for a ceremony celebrating the purchase of Royal Jordanian Airlines’ first Boeing 747. There she met King Hussein and his wife Queen Alia. Around the time of Queen Alia’s tragic death in a helicopter crash on February 9, 1977, Lisa agreed to fill in for an ill manager of her father’s aviation company in Jordan, Arab Air Services, which provided aviation design, engineering, and technical support to Middle East countries.\n\nBy the middle of 1977, the ill employee had returned to work and Lisa had been accepted to Columbia University’s School of Journalism. However, she received an interesting job offer. Ali Ghandour, the founder and chairman of Royal Jordanian Airlines, offered Lisa a job heading up a department within Royal Jordanian Airlines to coordinate the planning, design, and maintenance of the airline’s facilities in Jordan and throughout the world. It would be a challenging job, but Lisa accepted the challenge, a challenge that would change her life.\n\nIn the course of her work, Lisa’s path occasionally passed the path of King Hussein. On April 6, 1977, Lisa’s father insisted she accompany him to an audience with King Hussein. At the audience, King Hussein asked Lisa if she could come to his home Hashimaya to look at some construction problems. A lunch appointment was made for the next day. Little did Lisa know that a whirlwind courtship would start. In her autobiography, Queen Noor wrote: “Hash, 12:30 reads my diary entry for April 7. What it does not say is that I did not get home until 7:30 that evening.”\n\nOne week after that first lunch, King Hussein invited Lisa for a weekend at Aqaba, a seaport popular with tourists, with his children and a group of friends. After the weekend, Hussein and Lisa had numerous dinners at his home Hashimaya. They watched videos of films, went on motorcycle rides, and Hussein flew her in his helicopter, but most of all they talked and shared their thoughts and feelings.\n\nOn April 28, 1978, King Hussein said that he wanted to see Lisa’s father, and Lisa knew what he meant. The next day, King Hussein went out of the country on official business, but when he returned, he mentioned Lisa’s father in every conversation and finally, with a few chosen words, proposed marriage. For eighteen days, Lisa agonized over the decision, but finally, on May 18, 1978, Lisa agreed to marry King Hussein. Hussein called Lisa’s father at his home in Alpine, New Jersey, and said, “I have the honor to ask for your daughter’s hand in marriage.”\n\nThe Wedding\n\nKing Hussein I of Jordan and Lisa Halaby were married on June 15, 1978, at Zahran Palace in Amman, Jordan, home of Queen Mother Zein, the mother of King Hussein, and the traditional site of royal marriages. King Hussein wanted the marriage to occur as soon as possible but was persuaded to allow some time for family members to come to Amman. King Hussein gave Lisa a new, Arabic name: Noor al-Hussein, “Light of Hussein.”\n\nKing Hussein’s secretary commissioned a wedding dress from the French fashion house Dior. Two Dior designers came to Amman with sketches of elaborate wedding dresses, but Noor did not like the dresses. She wanted a simple dress that would be in line with Islamic ideals, so she showed the designers her favorite dress from her own closet, a Bohemian style Yves Saint Laurent boutique dress, and asked the designers to use that style as a model. The final design was a simple white silk crepe dress with a high neckline, long bell sleeves, and a plain long skirt.\n\nDuring the brief engagement, Noor studied books on Islam and Jordanian history. Her parents had not brought her up in any particular religion. The Jordanian Constitution does not require that the King’s wife be Muslim, but there was no question in Noor’s mind that she would become Muslim. She became a Muslim on the morning of her wedding by proclaiming the testimony of faith: “I declare there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger.” King Hussein decided that Noor would receive the style and title Her Majesty Queen Noor al-Hussein. Only one other of King Hussein’s previous three wives, Queen Alia, had been so honored.\n\nNoor prepared for her wedding in a simple manner. She persuaded the hairdresser to arrange her hair as simply as possible, a band of white flowers holding her long blond hair in place with a simple veil, and she wore no makeup. She partially followed the Western tradition and wore “something blue and something new.” The something blue was a wedding present from her father, a sapphire stick pin from Tiffany. The something new was a pair of diamond drop earrings from a set of jewelry, a gift from Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The diamond drop earrings were quite dramatic, so Noor decided to remove the drops and wear only the tops.\n\nWhile 500 guests waited on the lawn of the Zahran Palace, Hussein and Noor were married in an oriental-style sitting room in the palace. Noor was the only woman allowed, and the witnesses were Noor’s father and brother and the male members of the Jordanian Royal Family. A Muslim wedding ceremony is basically a contract in which the bride and groom agree to the contract and sign it in front of witnesses. Noor and King Hussein sat on a damask settee during the ceremony. They repeated simple marriage vows in Arabic. Noor said: “I have betrothed myself to thee in marriage for the dowry agreed upon.” King Hussein replied: “I have accepted thee as wife, my wife in marriage for the dowry agreed upon.” No rings were exchanged, instead, the vows were sealed by the couple clasping their right hands and looking at each other.\n\nA two-hour reception was held on the lawn of Zahran Palace. The couple emerged from the ceremony to cut the seven-tier, three-foot-high fruitcake wedding cake with a golden Hashemite sword. They then mingled for ten minutes with family members who gathered to congratulate them. Soft drinks were substituted for champagne at the reception as Islamic law prohibits alcohol. The armed forces band played lively music in the background\n\nThe guests included the elite of Jordanian society, the diplomatic corps, government officials, and senior officers of the armed forces. There were no foreign guests except the Halaby family, Mrs. Cyrus Vance, the wife of the then-American Secretary of State, and a handful of Noor’s friends from the United States. One of King Hussein’s former wives, the British-born Princess Muna, was also present.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Abdullah has eleven siblings from his father’s four marriages. At the time of his birth, Abdullah was Crown Prince and heir-apparent to the Jordanian throne. However, in 1965, due to the political unrest in the region, King Hussein instead named his brother Prince Hassan as Crown Prince. The succession laws in Jordan follow agnatic primogeniture but King Hussein had the constitution changed to allow the reigning King to override the usual line of succession and appoint someone else in the royal family as his heir.\n\nAbdullah began his education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, Jordan before attending St Edmund’s School in Hindhead, Surrey, England and the Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts in the United States. He then enrolled in the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant in 1981. He served in the British Army in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars Regiment as a reconnaissance troop leader. He returned to Jordan in 1985 and began serving in the Jordanian Armed Forces. By 1993, he had become Commander of the Jordanian Special Forces, and by 1998, had risen to the rank of Major General.\n\nOn February 7, 1999, Abdullah became King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan upon the death of his father King Hussein. Just two weeks earlier, King Hussein had stripped his brother Prince Hassan of the title of Crown Prince and named Abdullah as his successor.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Abdullah II of Jordan\n\nRania al-Yassin’s Background\n\nRania al-Yassin was born on August 31, 1970, in Kuwait, to Faisal Sedki Al-Yassin and his wife Ilham. Following her primary and secondary education at the New English School in Jabriya, Kuwait, Rania attended The American University in Cairo, Egypt, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration. She then attended The School of Business Studies in Geneva Switzerland, earning a post-graduate diploma in Business Management. She worked for a while at Citibank, before taking a job with Apple, Inc. in Jordan.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Rania of Jordan\n\nThe Engagement\n\nIn January 1993, a friend of Rania took her to a dinner party hosted by Prince Abdullah’s sister. “The minute Rania walked in, I knew it right there and then,” said Abdullah in a 2005 interview with People magazine. “It was love at first sight.” A whirlwind courtship began. Abdullah took Rania on motorbike rides across the desert, waterskiing on the Red Sea, and flying in helicopters. After a courtship of just two months, King Hussein reportedly drove his son to the home of Rania’s parents so Abdullah could propose. With King Hussein and her family looking on, Rania accepted.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nAbdullah and Rania were married on June 10, 1993, at the Zahran Palace in Amman, Jordan. Zahran Palace, built in 1957, has become the headquarters for official events involving the Jordanian Royal Family. The wedding day was a national holiday. At the time, Prince Abdullah was not Jordan’s crown prince. That title was held by King Hussein’s brother Prince Hassan. Still, as the oldest son of King Hussein’s twelve children, Abdullah’s marriage was a grand state occasion and a glittering affair with royalty flying in from around the world to attend.\n\nRania chose British designer Bruce Oldfield to make her two wedding gowns. During the traditional Muslim ceremony, Rania wore a modest, short-sleeve gown with exaggerated lapels and a large belt. Inspired by Syrian formal dresses at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Oldfield added gold detailing to the gown’s trim, matching hair ornament and gloves. The skirt was voluminous and ended in a train at the back. A long veil covered her face during the Muslim ceremony. Her hairdo was so tall that she had difficulty getting in and out of the car.\n\nPrince Abdullah wore his formal military dress uniform adorned with numerous medals and a ceremonial sword.\n\nQueen Rania had five young girls as attendants. They wore dresses with puffed sleeves in a peachy gold color and carried small bouquets of white and yellow flowers tied with yellow bows. Each girl wore a white hairband with flowers fastened at each end. Several young boys, dressed in sailor suits, served as the pages.\n\nThe Muslim wedding ceremony is known as a nikah. On the wedding day, the bride and groom are seated in different rooms accompanied by close friends and family. A nikha namah (marriage contract) is presented containing the conditions of the marriage and the agreed mahr (mandatory gift promised to the bride by the groom). An imam (Muslim worship leader) or any male knowledgeable in Islam is qualified to perform this ceremony, which involves proposing the wedding match to both parties and announcing their acceptance. Abdullah and Rania’s marriage was performed by King Hussein.\n\nAfter the marriage, the newlyweds toured the streets of Amman in an open convertible decorated with flowers and bows as they waved at cheering crowds.\n\nFor the evening reception, the couple changed into less formal attire. Rania wore a less modest, floor-length white sleeveless gown designed by Bruce Oldfield. It featured slender shoulder straps, a V-neck, and a slight plunge in the back. Abdullah wore a short white dinner jacket and dark pants.\n\nThe wedding cake, which the newlyweds cut with a sword, was multi-tiered with each tier in the shape of a rectangular room decorated with crowns and lace.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born Alia Baha Ad-Din Touqan on December 15, 1948, in Cairo, Egypt, the daughter of Baha Ad-Din Touqan and Hanan Hashim. Her father was a former Jordanian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey, and Egypt. He served under King Abdullah I of Jordan, was instrumental in the writing of the Jordanian Constitution, and served as the country’s first ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBecause of her father’s diplomatic work, the family moved often and Alia attended school wherever they lived. She attended the Rome Center of Liberal Arts in Rome (now the John Felice Rome Center), a branch of Loyola University Chicago, and studied political science, psychology, and public relations at Hunter College in New York. In 1971, she moved to Jordan where she worked for Royal Jordanian (at the time named Alia Airlines, in honor of King Hussein’s eldest daughter Alia). She was then asked to organize the first International Water Skiing Festival in Aqaba. It was there, where King Hussein had a holiday villa, that the two began their relationship.\n\nThey married privately on December 24, 1972, and Alia was named Queen Alia al-Hussein. The couple had two children and one adopted daughter:\n\nPrincess Haya (born 1974), married Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Emir of Dubai, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, had two children, divorced\n\nPrince Ali (born 1975), married Rym Brahimi, a former CNN journalist, had two children\n\nAbir Muhaisen (born 1972, adopted in 1976), Abir had been orphaned when her mother was killed in a plane crash at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan.\n\nAlong with raising her family, Queen Alia broke with tradition by taking on a much more public role than any of her predecessors. She established the Office of the Queen of Jordan and began working with numerous charities and organizations – particularly those dealing with women, children, and social development. She established a large number of scholarships to help impoverished children gain a quality education. She also promoted the arts and literature in Jordan, helping to establish libraries around the country, and starting several Arts festivals which continue to this day.\n\nQueen Alia also tackled some political issues. She very publicly fought for the rights of women to vote and be elected to public office. Thanks in part to her efforts, a law was put forth in 1974 allowing both. However, it would not be enacted until 1989.\n\nOn February 9, 1977, Queen Alia was killed in a helicopter crash in Amman. She was returning from a trip to Tafileh, about 140 miles south of Amman, where she was inspecting a hospital after reading negative reports about it in the media. Flying in a violent rainstorm, the military helicopter crashed and all aboard were killed. Completely devastated, King Hussein announced Alia’s death on television and radio. Following a traditional funeral service, Queen Alia was interred at the Royal Cemetery at Al-Maquar. King Hussein had a huge mausoleum built for his wife on a hill outside of the city and Queen Alia’s remains were moved there in 1980.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
