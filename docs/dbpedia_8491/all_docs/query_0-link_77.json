T^HERE is a vice among tourists which irritates the placid traveller. Looking over his neighbour’s territory, the lesser passer-by will deny the singu- larity of the scene spread out before him. It suggests some choice spot in his own country, or, worse still, a “bit” in the landscape of the people next nation but one away. It is sometimes patriotism and pedantry which prompts such observations, but more often it is merely the bad habit of comparison. Thus in Ireland visitors and guide books refer to Palestine, North Wales, Switzerland, Holland, Madeira. Here is Paris, there Bruges, and, of course, Paradise and Arcadia are dragged in. The Midland Rail- way, not to be outdone by the claim for Cornwall by the Great Western, have invented a Northern Riviera in Antrim. Near Carrigart, through which the stranger passes on arrival by land or sea, is the Rosapenna Hotel, well- equipped, commodious, and famous as r resort for golfers and anglers. To build it in foreign style, and to emphasise the lack in Donegal of the necessary material, a quantity of timber was shipped across the North Sea. Already there was a horded coast, and “ Nor- way in Ireland ” was the sequel. There was some ex- cuse for this parallel on other than scenic grounds. Norwe- gians instruct the Irish fisher- men in departments of mack- erel curing, and the pattern of their boats has been adopted ; geologists say that the granite of the two countries is similar ; for salmon fishing, large and gaudy flies are necessary in either land ; and in the explor- ation of the deep seas of the Irish Atlantic the steamship Helga is Norwegian in name if not in complement. Still, whoever christened Rosa- penna with a Scandinavian attribute was guilty of the wasteful and ridiculous excess which, the play tells us, at- * Articles on * Londondeiry and Neigh- bourhood ' appeared in 1906, pp. 343, 359.

Viking blood may be necessary to animate the fisheries, but splendid natural resources give the Mulroy district a reputation of its own. It needs no imported character, no disguise. Eyes unaccustomed to the eccentricities of the world’s surface may be magnetised when confronted with some extraordinary effect on land or sea, and the testimony of some great traveller alone can give assurance that in this or that country is a prospect unparalleled in the gorgeously illuminated book of nature. It is acknowledged by those competent to judge, that on the coast of Ireland there are scenes which are to the tourist what the conjuror’s trick is to an audience. The illusion is complete. Leave the garage at Rosapenna and look over Sheephaven from the volcanic rocks a few miles past Derry Hassan on the Ross- gull Peninsula. On the other side of Horn Head some hidden fire throws up an unimaginable glare, and the ponderous mass of land moves slowly out to sea. It is a trick of nature.

It was once a stronghold of great importance, owned by the McSweeneys, and in com- paratively recent years it was adapted to the pur- poses of residence. But its ancient and modern use is destroyed, and the exul- tant waters press noisily on the surrounding rocks. Through the top of the building the rain pours to the earth, and the sodden perforated floois protest when the trespasser cauti- ously treads his way through the abandoned chambers.

'1’he view of the castle is more romantic than that from it. Seen from the western side of the Lackagh River, or from the sea, it is an impressive land- mark ; nearer, this quality is lost in the desolate condition of the place. Walk along the inside ledge of the outer wall, and the commanding position of the fortress is apparent. Creeslough, at the base of the Muckish Mountain, is very much alive on the occasions of the periodical fairs, but usually it is as undisturbed as every other town in which such events are the chief excitements. These fairs are not like the ones made up in London to advertise Irish home industries. Locally, the business of the day is concerned with cattle, sheep, or produce. Friendly buffoonery goes on, and a free fight occurs sometimes when commerce is dull : but, as a rule, the transactions are as business-like and quiet as at Covent Garden or Smithfield. An ordinary tourist hankers for none of the frolics of Donnybrook or Ballinasloe, where the presence of the Viceroy or of the London swell mob used to keep affairs lively between the transfer of high- priced equine “ toppers.” But it would add charm to the meetings if, as in the Taillten times, each fair had its high wall and small opening through which girls would put a hand, to be chosen in marriage. A year and a day these contracts lasted, and it was a sound enough bargain for those of a speculative turn. If, when the tourist approaches Creeslough, bright sun- shine alternates with heavy showers, he will see on the hills before him a number of silver spots sparkling in the light. Doe Castle. By W. Monk, R.E. 6 THE ART JOURNAL. The rocks, burnished with trickling water, are like mirrors, and it seems as though the black background is pierced and jewelled. Perhaps a rainbow will give unexpected colour to the scene. In Donegal there is a special kind of wet blanket called a Smirr, and it cannot be denied that with this, or another variety of bad weather, the tourist must be prepared for some discomfort. Probably the difficulties of the clay will not be quite forgotten when the comforts of the evening are being enjoyed, but there will remain the satis- faction of having seen some amazing effect on the scenery caused by a sudden change in the weather. Bright water is quickly black-leaded, grey mountains turn purple in majesty, and a few minutes later sulky clouds are scuttling away before the light. The penalty of being drenched need not be considered, disconcerting though it is to feel rain driving disrespectfully upwards instead of downwards, as it does in most countries. Once hardened to the climate, the forecast of the day is a matter of indifference. Fine day or soft day, the traveller goes on a piece. Days may come or go, with nothing but rain without interval, but gradually the stranger will find himself echoing the invariable opinion of his optimistic host, and think that, indeed, though it is not looking very favourable to day, it may mend. A few miles south from Creeslough is Glen Yeagh, described as one of the wildest, if not the most wild, of mountain passes in Ireland. It is more easily approached from Letterkenny or Gweedore. Set among the uncultivated fruits of the earth and civilized with artificial gardens and rockeries, Glen Veagh Castle owes much to its picturesque surroundings. It may be considered one of the most desirable of Donegal residences ; but a few years after it was purchased by the late John G. Adair, it was not safe for himself or his servants to go about without an escort. The landlord put the question to the Government of the day if it was right that he should be compelled to defend his property, as in the first stage of society, with his own armed retainers. The road to the Castle winds pleasantly along the side of the Lough, and hidden water roars down the adjacent hills. Near here is the Poisoned Glen, to which reference will be made in future. Some Rare Miniature Portraits in Oil. By Dudley Heath. THE popular idea of the miniature portrait is one that is painted in water-colour, a l' aquarelle or “ gouache,” on ivory, vellum or card. But the traditional method of the mediaeval miniaturists was closely akin to tempera painting, the surface being prepared with a white ground on which the picture was painted in colours mixed with yolk of egg. Later the process was modified in that the picture was partially painted transparently on a white ground, and partially opaquely or in “ gouache.” The transparent method of painting the flesh was adopted by the Italian Clovio in the early fifteenth century, and carried to great perfection by means of stippling. Pacheco describes the two processes in his elaborate treatise ‘ Arte de Pintura,’ 1649, find likens the solid method to ancient tempera where the carnations are laid in their natural colours and their tones varied, as is done in good oil painting. In reality the technical qualities ol oil, tempera and water-colour are essentially different, as we understand them in the present day, but this was not always the case, at any rate to the same extent. The work of the Flemish Primitives, who were pioneers of the process of painting in oil, is so nearly allied, in its general character, to the work of the manuscript miniaturists that the medium and scale of the picture does not seem to have affected the handling. Their processes were as strictly defined as their restricted vision of nature and the limitations of their pictorial effects. The small panel portraits of such painters as the Van Eycks, Hans Memlinc, Quintin Matsys, and Jean Gosseart, in their qualities and elaboration possess all the attributes of minia- tures, even if their dimensions may be considered outside the limits. The painters of Germany, Italy and France soon discovered the advantages of the new medium, and in learning its secrets from the Netherlandish painters also acquired, as we know, many of the characteristics of their work, such as their unique powers of portraiture in broad effects of light, and simple masses of tone and colour. One of the first Italians to produce panel and miniature portraits under their influence was Antonelli da Messina. Of the German school, Lucas Cranach, a contemporary of Albert Diirer, was perhaps the earliest to whom we can credit miniature portraiture, and, like his countryman Holbein, painted the great Erasmus. Then we have the Clouets in France, whose work will always be such a source of conten- tion. These names are the pivots around which the various national schools are classified, but there must have been numerous painters whose work, but little less worthy, has never been identified. Most of the early Netherlandish and German portrait miniatures were painted in oil on panel, but even the well-seasoned panel was liable to crack, warp, and destruction by insects ; and besides, for pictures of such small dimensions it required very careful preparation of the surface to obliterate the grain and render it smoother and more equal in texture. For these reasons we find later that gold, silver, copper and other metals, besides bone, slate, millboard, card, vellum and even paper are used as bases for the minia- ture in oil. It is very unusual to come across portrait miniatures painted in tempera, but I have handled a few ; one very good example being a portrait of Ferdinando I. de Medici, on vellum with a background of gold. It is not always easy to distinguish the tempera miniature from the oil miniature, when both are varnished, and the oil is painted very thin on a gesso ground. I can only hope to show, in a short article like the present, that the subject is one that might well occupy the attention of the collector more thoroughly than hitherto, more especially as there has been little attempt to classify SOME RARE MINIATURE PORTRAITS IN OIL. 7 the number of ex- cellent oil minia- tures to be found in most important collections. So little is the charac- teristic of the medium under- stood by the aver- age collector, that one invariably finds oil miniatures are treated in pre- cisely the same manner as those in water-colour, and are kept shielded from the light : a treatment excellent for the latter, but most pernicious to the former, as oil has the property of darkening and yellowing unless allowed free access to strong light. This was thoroughly understood by the early Italian painters, who were in the habit of drying and bleaching the oil in their pictures in the direct rays of the sun after each successive painting. The Italian portrait of Pico della Mirandola, 1463-1494, is undoubtedly correctly named as to the subject (p. 7). Pico was a Florentine distinguished for his precocity and varied literary genius. Niccolo Fiorentino, the famous contempo- rary Florentine medallist, produced various medal portraits of this savant, and in at least one of these, very considerable likeness to the miniature can be seen. Any doubt, however, as to the portraiture is at once set at rest by a comparison with an excellent wood engraving of the Florentine poet given in ‘ Vies des Homines Illustres,’ by A. Thenet. There are certain facts about this miniature which prevent one from accepting it as a contemporary painting. The quality of the painting and colour and the fact that it is on gold suggest that it is of later date, and this is borne out by the treatment of the hair, which is obviously inspired by a sculpturesque rendering. It is probably a later painter’s translation into colour of an 'existing portrait in relief, by no means an uncommon practice. A curious feature of this example is the fact that on the reverse side of the same gold plaque is the painting of an elderly lady, which might possibly represent the mother of Pico della Mirandola. 'Phis miniature of Pico has none of the interest of the portraits by such a painter as Antonelli the Venetian, or indeed any of those which were inspired by the Netherlandish School, neither does it seem to be essentially the work of a miniaturist. If we compare it with the small sixteenth century miniature of a lady of the time of Charles V. (p. 7), we see how far superior is the latter in its feeling for portraiture ; the delicacy of its handling of the details proving it to be the work of the professional miniaturist, although the drawing is somewhat primitive. Miniature portraits were so often duplicated and translated from one medium to another that it is extremely difficult to identify the hand of an individual artist. This is abundantly proved by the varying opinions of experts. Again, the custom of making pattern drawings from which portraits were painted, as in the case of the Clouets and Holbein, has A Lady : Time of Charles V. In Oil, on Oak Panel.

The French miniatures of the Clouet School show us such a remarkable advance in every quality which gives grace, vitality and refinement to portraiture that it is Katherine Howard : Oil, on Panel. In the style of Clouet. THE ART JOURNAL. The Artist : Water colour, on Card. By Hans Holbein. comparatively easy to recognise them, though the arbitrary distinction which is sometimes drawn between indivi- dual examples does seem to me a little ven- turesome. As a case in point let us take the two beau- tiful little oil portraits called ‘Jean de Thou’ and ‘ Renee Baillet,’ at Hertford House. These are oil miniatures painted apparently on a prepared millboard, both possessing exactly the same marginal painted border or frame. With reference to the man’s portrait, the catalogue tells us “ it is an exact contemporary copy, in reduced proportions, of a drawing by Francois Clouet in the Bibliotheque National of Paris.” In the case of the lady’s portrait there is no reference given to a pattern drawing. Whereas the first is attributed only to the French School of the later sixteenth century, the latter is positively ascribed to Frangois Clouet. Putting aside the question of their relative merits, which seems to me much more debatable than the author of the note would acknow- ledge, I think the serious student must admit that the painter of the man’s portrait is a remarkable exponent of the Clouet School, and the fact that it is an exact copy of a drawing by Clouet seems to warrant us in not adding un- necessary mystery to its identity. The miniature of Katherine Howard from Montagu House, illustrated on page 7, is another beautiful example of the same school. When compared with the Renee Baillet miniature, it suggests that it was produced from a pattern drawing rather than from life ; still it is exquisitely subtle in drawing, modelling, and detail. The portraiture immediately recalls the famous circular miniature by Holbein at Windsor, and in its even greater refinement we at once distinguish French feeling. In one important particular it lacks the German painter’s consummate art — the faculty of decorating a given space, in which quality the Windsor Howard is one of his finest ex- amples. In the little oil picture of Holbein (p. 8) we have a very interesting duplicate of the water-colour minia- ture at Hertford House. Every detail of the draw- ing is copied with scru- pulous care, the only variation that I can discover being a very slight difference in the angle of the pencil, and the drawing of the hands is somewhat heavier.

Whilst it proves the excellence of some unknown copyist, it emphasises the beauties of the two original water-colours, the finest of which is certainly that belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch. If this one (p. 8) is compared with the oil miniature, it will be seen there is very considerable difference in the drawing and expression, and the hair and beard are closet clipped. It is, I think, more subtle in rendering, more thoughtful in expression, less intense in its definition. The little miniature of Sir Thomas More (p. 8) may certainly be considered in the nature of a discovery, inasmuch as it has never been referred to in any of the recent theses on the miniatures of Holbein nor by any previous writer.

By Cornelius Jansseen. is all the more curious because a portrait ot Sir Thomas More belonging to Mr. Ernest Godolphin Quicke has only recently been brought into the light of publicity. I do not claim in any way to have discovered the present miniature. Its exquisite subtlety of expression and drawing certainly held my immediate attention, and proclaimed it at once to be the work of a master, but it is one of the many fine examples belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch, and one which His Grace pointed out to me as a miniature he particularly admired. That in some ways it cannot be considered so important a miniature as Mr. Godolphin Quicke’s example, must be admitted. It is smaller, and the fact that it is in oil with a dark brown background and somewhat low in tone, detracts from the general effect. But in expression and feeling it certainly appears to me to surpass the larger miniature. This little picture, which can as confidently be attributed to Holbein as others have been, is peculiarly interesting, being, though slightly larger than the reproduction, the smallest known portrait in oil which the master painted. It is on silver, and the lowness and warmth of tone make it particularly difficult to photo- graph, but such work as this seems to enforce its merits even through the imperfections of a reproduction.

John Bettes is admittedly a very rare master of miniature and we have had various dates given as his term of life. It is generally sup- posed that he died about the year 1570, and the latest date, I believe, has been authoritatively given as 1573. We know that he was Nicholas Hilliard’s pupil, and that, like his master, he was employed by Queen Elizabeth. He is said to have painted a very exquisite little portrait of the Queen’s favourite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The only evidence I know of, that he painted in oil, is the portrait of Edmund Butt, ascribed to him, in the National Gallery. This painting certainly possesses the thin and somewhat poor quality of technique suggestive of a hand accustomed to paint in water-colour on a small scale. On page 8 is an oil miniature on card, which is signed 1580, B., not J. B. as has been asserted, and which has been ascribed to Bettes. If this is correct, which seems most probable, then we must add seven years on to his term of life. On the other hand, no student of painting could pretend to see any similitude between the handling of this miniature and the oil portrait mentioned, neither is there any trace of Hilliard’s teaching in its achievement, as in the water- c o lo u r of Essex. On the contrary, it has painter- like qualities that indicate an adept in the oil-colours and is altogether a very fine piece of work. One of the most distin- guished por- . . , „ . . trait painters An Aged Monk ( Spanish) : In Oil, on Paper. who produced miniatures in oil was Cornelius Jansseen, and the fact that he also copied many of his larger works in minia- ture has been the reason for assigning many speci- mens to this painter that he probably never saw. The example, however, that I give here from the Welbeck collection (p. 9) is one of those that I have little hesita- Portrait: In Oil, on Copper, tion in ascribing to him, Cromwellian Period, on account of its breadth and masterly qualities of technique. It is catalogued as a portrait of the painter himself, but it is quite unlike any other that I have seen. Another oil portrait about which some doubt may be expressed is that of Ben Jonson (p. 9). It is similar to one or two miniatures in water-colours that exist, and is excellent in its qualities. Houbraken engraved it as a portrait of the poet in all good faith, yet if we compare it with Gerard Honthorst’s portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, from which most other engravings of Ben Jonson were taken, this likeness certainly seems, in most character- istics, dissimilar. The engraving is dated 1738, just a hundred years after his death, but the portrait which we give is undoubtedly a contemporary production on copper, and is one of many excellent oil miniatures about which we must remain uncertain. That it is from the hand of Peter Oliver, as has been several times suggested, seems to me unsupported by any evidence whatever. There are numbers of wonderfully skilful little portraits in oil belonging to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which prove beyond doubt that there existed many clever An Old Man (Spanish ) : In Oil, on Rough Paper. SOME RARE MINIATURE PORTRAITS IN OIL. miniaturists who practised this medium long after water- colours had become the favourite method. Amongst the few names which are associated with this branch of the art, the Cleyn family must be placed promi- nently. Their authenticated works are very scarce, but always show an excellence of finish peculiarly and typically characteristic of the art of the miniaturist. In identifying their miniatures we again meet with some confusion. Walpole distinctly states that, according to the register at Mortlake, “ Francis Cleyn the elder had three sons, Francis, Charles, and John ; Francis, the eldest, being born in 1625 and dying in 1650.” The other two “appear to have been expert artists.” There are several water-colour miniatures extant signed with two C’s intertwined, and these are undoubtedly by Charles. As will be seen by the two beautiful oil examples I give here, certain miniatures have been definitely assigned to Francis (p. 9). The one of Andrew Marvell was exhibited at the Burlington Fine Art Exhibition in 1889 and catalogued as by Francis Cleyn. The other portrait of an unknown gentleman, which belongs to the same collection, is described as being signed F.C., and by Francis Cleyn. I have examined the monogram signature on this last very carefully, and the initials are certainly not F.C., but F.S. As the two paintings decidedly have the appearance of being from the same hand, it appears to me probable that the incorrect reading of this monogram has led to the error in the ascription of both. As the eldest son Francis died ten years before the Restoration, his sitters would hardly have been dressed as in the second miniature, which altogether suggests a later date. It is quite possible that some minia- tures assigned to Francis Cleyn may have been done by the father, who is said to have taught miniature painting to Richard Gibson and others, and we know he lived to the year 1658. It is always a pity to have to throw doubt on any existing ascription ; on the other hand, it is only by frankly admitting errors that any advance in our knowledge is attained. These two miniatures are so remarkably fine and possess such distinctive characteristics that it would be of great interest to determine their authorship. Two other excellent little portraits of the Cromwellian period l am also able to give here, one of General Desborough (p. 10), brother-in-law to Cromwell, executed with great delicacy, and the other of an unknown gentleman, very freely painted and full of character. Both are painted on copper, but they show two completely different methods of handling. I will conclude with a reference to some clever small portrait studies, on paper, of the Spanish school (p. 10). These can hardly be legitimately considered miniatures inasmuch as their qualities are too impressionistic, and yet if it can be claimed that Goya painted miniatures in producing pieces of equally small dimensions, these may at least be classed in the same category. I should be inclined to say myself that they but prove it is not the scale, but rather the technical execution, that constitutes a miniature. We have to acknowledge our indebtedness to His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch for his kind permission to reproduce most of the miniatures illustrated here, and to His Grace the Duke of Portland for a similar privilege in respect to the one by Cornelius Jansseen. The Romance of the Spoon. By E. Avery Keddell. ‘ Ah, fill the cup ; what boots it to repeat How Time is slipping underneath our feet?” HP RLE is it that volumes of absorbing interest could be written upon the romance clinging around the spoon ! The immortal Virgil dwelt about a gnat, Apuleius discoursed upon the ass ; Lucian made much in the written word of a fly, whilst Homer dwelt upon a battle loyal between frogs and mice. A bucket provided Tasso \" material for twelve cantos. Again, Pope gave us a poem on a lock of hair ; Gray, lines on a cat ; Cowper eulogised his sofa, and no less a person than Prior set down in writing concerning a ladle. Swift mused on the stump of a besom, and one John Haywood, who lived in Henry VIII.’s time, wrote no less than seventy-seven chapters upon spiders and cobwebs ! In the very sound of a spoon there is life, history and romance. Is it not the life-giver ? What visions of feasting and feasting’s pleasure it conjures to the poor and hungry, even as to the rich and the voluptuous. We are all, more or less, acquainted with the adventures in many different countries of an immortalised spoon-maker of the sixteenth century no less than our familiar old friend Sancho Panza, that short, fat husband of Tereza, whose shrewd simplicity, jokes, and proverbs have been so cleverly portrayed for us by the pen of Cervantes. Yet, familiar as we are with the pen-work II THE ART JOURNAL. of this writer, there are things that the reviewers of Cervantes have overlooked. For instance, had he withheld from Sancho Panza his penchant for making wooden spoons and fondling them, the history of Don Quixote might just as well have been without the owner of Dapple. From what were the jolly round face and sly looks of Sancho derived, if not the free use of spoons ? To what else but their cruel neglect was to be attributed the ghastly appearance of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance? Had the knight lived after the fashion of Panza he would, of a surety, never have lost his wits ; and had the latter dieted as his master, he would never have had any to lose ! The moral of the great Spanish romance has been much misunderstood ; evidently the real intention of the author was to teach the world of men one invaluable truth, viz., that the proper use of a spoon could make a sensible man of a fool, and the neglect of it — a fool of a sensible man. A spoon is absolutely one of the first things needed when we enter the world, and it is one of the last we part from when we go out with the tide. If it is not the very best music to mankind, and the companion of childhood, woman- hood, motherhood and old age, it does play its part, and has, therefore, some claim to reverence and retrospection. The influence of the spoon is felt in every department and station of life. Above even the knife and fork it moulds the manners, morals, and national characteristics, and much of individuality Six Apostle Spoons. English. Period 1544- and personal character is told in the method of its usage. It is a healer of wounds oftentimes, alike for the body and the mind of us. What bad tempers it has softened, what evil passions it has been known to lay. Whilst many a knife has committed murder, and the most presentable fork been guilty of felony, how little of evil has the spoon lent itself to. Stolen in all ages, it has not returned evil to its captors. The spoon opens the mouth of the dumb and, what is some- times much more difficult to accomplish, it has been known to stop the loquacious one ! Like unto the black stone at Micca, it is polished by the lips of its admirers, and though a censorious world might stigmatise this as being mere lip service, it is, in reality, from the heart or its neighbourhood, if we give credence to the Chinese philosophy, that the seat of the soul is in the centre of the stomach. Many are the standpoints we may study the spoon from, and might even affirm that it had played its part in mould- ing the destiny of nations. The vivacity of the French is said to be due to their frequent and clever manipulation of the spoon. Too wise are they to follow the example of their taciturn neighbours in an everlasting use of knife and fork. The difference in the temper and habits of Briton and Gaul may be, perhaps, traced to roasts and ragouts, to beef and bouilli. What a wealth of antiquarian lore has the history of the spoon attached itself to. Egyptian specimens of hoary Folding Spoons (German and Dutch) of Seventeenth Century. French and Scotch Rat-tails, and flat stem with Pied-de-biche termination. antiquity show that the mouths of people three and four thousand years ago were much of the same size and capacity as ours of to-day, for these spoons and ours are much of an average size. Again, what philanthropists, in their quiet way, spoons have shown themselves to be. Often and often have they rescued their owners from dire extremities. Even pewter spoons have been known to help the cause of Freedom against Tyranny by being melted into bullets to fire at the enemy. In every city of the world frequently have silver spoons left home and family in order to raise money for the purchase of food when their possessor’s purse has been so empty as to leave the cupboard bare. The flinty-hearted money-lender has his soft side for the spoon, and will often lend more than their worth on them, in the sentimental hope of obtaining them for his own collection. The mess of pottage which Esau bought for the price of his birthright needed a spoon to eat it with, so some sort of a rough spoon must have existed from the earliest times. Doubtless these earlier spoons were all natural ones, and after the hollow of the hand, the shells of cockle, mussel, clam, and many other bivalves were brought into requisition and were obviously suited, though strictly limited as to quantity, for conveying liquid to the mouth. History teaches us how the choicest liqueurs of the ancient Piets and Scots were served in cockle-shells, and it was thus there arose that familiar phrase, “ rejoicing in a shell,” which, in olden days, was equivalent to the more modern fashion of drinking toas's in wine. Until quite recently, your true Highlander drank his whisky in the same way. Nature shells have now made way for artificial ones, and are, we suppose, very seldom used. Sir Walter Scott reminds us of these old customs in his “ St. Ronan’s Well,” where he made the old Nabob describe the ladies as “ sipping cat-lap out of cockle-shells.” Somewhat more natural spoons, as we regard them, were obtained from the horns of animals— goats, oxen, bison, and buffalo. It may not seem very extensively known, yet the spoon plays an important part in the most solemn even as in the most pompous of our national pageants. At the anointing of our monarchs at their coronation in Westminster Abbey it has always been indispensable, and the consecrated oil is first put into a spoon before being poured over their devoted and august heads. Many of the sacred articles used on such ceremonial occasions were lost and done away with during the Civil Wars, and, of course, Oliver Cromwell, the austere, made sad havoc amongst these baubles. On the restoration and return of Charles II., his crowning was delayed on account of the absence of the anointing spoon, amongst other things. So the reader must admit that in the history of spoons there is romance, and a dignity mated to fine utility. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries old pocket spoons, or folding spoons, as they were called, were not rare. In the grand progresses and visits of Elizabeth we read of a golden one, and there are still in existence some good examples of the gold folding spoon of that time. In some old spoons the handles are separable from the bowls. I have seen Persian sherbet spoons fifteen inches long, which were fashioned, and beautifully too, of box- or pear-tree wood. THE ART JOURNAL. THE ROMANCE OF THE SPOON. i5 In China and some parts of Asia, spoons are made of earthenware, though the chop-sticks perform for the Chinese the same duties as our fork and spoon. The prevalent idea that your monogram or crest on your spoon is not altogether an ancient custom may be dispersed, for the Greeks and Romans had their initials cut on the spoons of their use. Quaint devices, too, were adopted during the middle ages, and many a good churchman had his spoons embellished with an Agnus Dei, or the figure of one of the Twelve Apostles, and it is from these older spoons we gain the Apostle spoon of a later age. It is recorded that Hogarth began his career by engraving arms and initials upon plates and spoons, and although we have very little information on this subject, it is undoubtedly authentic. With our more immediate forefathers, it was considered evidence of a dire poverty, or of an exceeding meanness, not to possess spoons or some of the table service of silver. In northern Europe, the young women on festival days adorned themselves with rows of silver spoons strung together, and worn either as a necklace or girdle. A person of considerable importance was the feminine possessor of the longest necklace or best filled girdle. The possessor of a good collection of antique silver spoons is now a someone who may justly arouse in others the sin of covetable envy. Such articles may be of almost fabulous value, and in order to enable my readers to recognise the genuine and prized examples, I am giving a few particulars of some of the more sought-for patterns. The majority of the spoons made before 1499 had either what is termed a plain “ knop” or knob, or a spear-point. In the fifteenth century, some spoons were produced whose stems were adorned with a representation of the Virgin Mary. This particular type of spoon eventually came to be known as the “ Maiden-Head ” spoon, and a considerable number of these were made during the sixteenth century, for they were extremely popular. Again, some of the most famous sets of Apostle spoons were made about that same period. Complete sets, numbering twelve, of these old Apostle spoons are both rare and, when they are to be purchased, fetch long prices, for so many sets have in the course of the last three or four hundred years been divided or broken up. Some two years ago, at a famous spoon collector’s sale, one Apostle spoon fetched no less a sum than £600. Since the cult of the antique has become the fashionable pastime of the English and American woman, the market price of old spoons has steadily increased each year. In 1858, it is recorded that a complete set of twelve Apostle spoons, dated 1592, were sold for ^430. If anyone boasts a set of thirteen Apostle spoons— that is, the Twelve Apostles and the “ Master ” spoon with a figure of the Saviour holding a cross, they would fetch quite easily a princely sum. Such sets of thirteen are exceeding rare, and so far as I have been able to discover, only four such Master sets of English manufacture are now known to be in existence. The six Apostle spoons we are able to reproduce in these pages are of silver parcel-gilt, with large bowls, and bear the English Hall mark for 1544. At the end of each spoon we may note the figure of one of the Apostles, whilst along the i y * | I A * j v A English Spoons of Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Centnries, showing examples of the diamond-pointed spoon, the lion sejant, acorn headed, maiden-headed, the slipped-end, and the seal-headed. i6 THE ART JOURNAL. stem, engraved in Gothic characters, is the name of the individual Apostle, followed by the word, “Apostolus.’’ The spelling of some of the names is peculiar, thus : “ Sanctus Batholomeus,” “ Sanctus Andreas,” “ Sanctus Mattheus,” “ Sanctus Phelippus.” Of ancient date was the custom of godfathers and god- mothers at christenings to present spoons, and the origin of the saying, “born with a silver spoon in her mouth,” is easily traced to this. Were the sponsor a wealthy man or woman, a set of Apostle spoons might have been given, while folks not so rich would give a pair of spoons, or even one, adorned with their own particular saint. .Spoons with “slipped” ends were made as early as 1580, and there- fore there appears to be no foundation for the theory, atone time held by a large number cf collectors, that these were reaily Apostle spoons which had been mutilated by the Roundheads. But spoons with these sliced stems are, amongst many people, still termed “Puritans.” The lion sejant spoon seems to have been produced chiefly during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Another pattern which apparently was made before, but not after, the reign of Charles II. is the seal-headed spoon. A device which found favour with the silversmiths from the time of the Commonwealth until well into George I.’s reign was known as the “ pied dr biche” In these, as their name implies, the handle is cleft in two places, making three divisions much resembling a hind’s foot. Following closely upon the welcome advent of the tea- caddy came those dainty little shovels or scoops for measuring the tea into the teapot, and a considerable number of these tea-caddy spoons were wrought by the craftsmen of the eighteenth century. Many of these specimens exhibit great variety, and the wonderful originality of design typical of things wrought in that notable era. Some of these caddy spoons show bowls of shell shape, with short, dumpy handles ; others again have the oval bowl mated to the fiddle-pattern stem, but there is practically no limit to either the variety or design for these pretty and dainty little spoons, the collection of which is quite amongst the latest craze. Naturally enough there are many other kinds of spoons which space will not permit me to describe in a single article, but this article itself would not be complete were no mention made of the progress or rather diminution of the “ Rat’s-tail ” spoon, as that long tongue running down the back of the bowl and joining it to the handle is called. 'Phis particular type of decoration may be found upon spoons made in several reigns prior to that of George II. Towards the end of the seventeenth century the bowls on our spoons commenced to be elongated, and to be made more oval than round, and the handles or stems were then made flat and broad. This will be noticed to be the characteristic of spoons fashioned in the days of Good Queen Anne. The joining of these elliptical bowls to the handles was in reality strengthened by the rat’s-tail decoration. With the Hanoverian dynasty in England the handles of spoons became rounded, and there was a sharp ridge running down the centre. Subsequently, the handle, instead of turning up at the end in front, was made to turn down, just as we are accustomed to see spoons of the present day, and as these grew more popular the rat’s-tail became shorter and shorter. Since the days of George II., spoons, while changing slightly in mode of ornamentation, have not sub- stantially altered in main outline. Have 1 said enough to show that an old spoon may have had not only an historic, but, more possibly still, a romantic past? While theologians may wrangle as to the transmigration of souls, the transmigration of spoons is beyond dispute. Futhermore, the spoons we use to-day may have, in the distant ages of the past, been silver sheckles in some far-off temple, or possibly, have belonged to those paid by Abraham for that field at Hebron. The most care- less among us can spare a thought for these old relics, and handle them with a reverence to which their age and history entitle them. Who is there amongst us to-day can tell but what some treasured spoon may have once upon a time been in the possession of Andromache, or Artaxerxes, of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, or have been lifted to the red lips of the beauteous Cleopatra herself? Reparabit Cornua Phcebe. By Tom Scott, R S.A. Tom Scott, R.S.A. By Edward Pinnington. OF the small group of Scots artists who restrict their practice to water-colours, Mr. Tom Scott is one of the most prominent and capable. He has mastered the qualities peculiar to the medium of his preference — not less its delicacy than its strength — and, accord- ing to his mood and subject, compels the rendi- tion alternately of tenderness and force. The latter is found chiefly in his figure-paintings, where the vigour of the drawing and action is carried out in the reserved strength of the colour. The former is most strikingly apparent in landscape. The colour of nature in Scotland was likened by Millais to a wet pebble. He meant that the low greens and greys and purples of moor, rock, and heather, the richer tints of autumn, “ and lichened crags, orange and grey and brown,” have, in the moist air, a glistening sheen akin to that of an eye swim- ming in tears. In the southern districts, when, through rolling mists, the autumn sun strikes the dripping uplands, the prevailing tint is lower, nearer that of a polished moss agati . The driving moisture wets like fine rain, and makes the landscape “ gleam like waters in the sun.” The effect is often caught on the moors of Galloway, in the rugged Carlyle country about Craigenputtock, and eastward from Criffel and the Solway to Norham and the Tweed. To reproduce it in art — the glassy clearness of the air and the sparkle of the greenery — demands an eye and a brush trained to fine A Reiver’s Ride. By Tom Scott, R.S.A. D THE ART JOURNAL. subjects belong to his life. They are part of himself, and his treatment of them in art is, therefore, only a form of self-expression. Circumstance has been a powerful agent in making Scott what he is. He was born at Selkirk in 1854, and educated there. When a little boy of four or five, he “scratched away,” he says, with pencil and coloured crayons, and became the happy possessor of a box of water-colours. By a circumstance so trifling he was led in life’s beginning to use water-colour, and the early associa- tion has never been broken. It was, rather, strengthened by what he saw in after years of the work of other aquarel- lists, and especially of Bough. In boyhood he found critics in the workmen in a neighbouring shoemaker’s shop. His only conscious impulse at the time was a vague desire to imitate, and he accordingly drew anything that struck his fancy. At school, his faculty showed itself in the excep- tional form of ornamental lettering, at which, amongst his schoolmates, he was an easy first. His slate was a con- venient drawing-board and sketch-book, and his slate- pencil was seldom idle. Leaving school, he went into the clothing trade, and — as too many have done in kindred pursuits— wasted many precious years in the workshop and sales-room. He had reached his majority before he won his freedom, and soon afterwards he began to exhibit, appearing in the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition of 1878 with a water-colour landscape, ‘ A Yarrow Brae.’ The fact is noteworthy as indicative of the value of industry to an untutored artist. Although, in truth, Scott got no lessons, he practised almost incessantly. His life at that period, as he drew near the parting of the ways, presents few variations upon an often- told tale. There was the old battle to be fought once more with circumstance and authority. Scott used to rise in the morning hours for sketching purposes, sometimes setting out as early as three o’clock, to catch the mystery-making greys, the opals and half-tones that make the impalpable fascination of the world, and of the rose-tinged sky before sunrise. In landscape lay the field of his first choice, and, there being no local artist to consort with, he found a companion in one of his father’s workmen. The two untrained enthusi- The Troutlawford. By Tom Scott, R.S.A. distinctions. The eastern section of the Border, from Ber- wick to Selkirk, is Mr. Scott’s chosen field. Nature has taught him something of her own subtlety, and, from the riches strewed on hill and haugh by the passing seasons, he works back to the corresponding wealth of history, tradition, and minstrelsy. The Border is an inexhaustible mine of subjects for every form of pictorial art. In the sense of Schopenhauer, style is “ the physiognomy of the mind,” and pertains to conception, design and tech- nique. Personal style surrounds Mr. Scott like an atmo- sphere, although it has been affected by environment, and the associations of poetry and history. The peculiarity of his case is that external influence has made for individuality. He is par excellence the artist-minstrel, the pictorial makkar of the Scottish Border. He is not a wandering harper, but indigenous to the Borderland, a reflection of Border life, of the spirit of the typical Borderer, of the poetic melancholy of Border nature. Born in the reiver’s home, he was reared amongst the places sung by the minstrels. To have lived within the fringe of the rich-netted mantle of romance which envelops the Border from Merrie Carlisle to Berwick is Scott’s privilege and distinction. To be of the Border, to have Border blood in his veins, to be a Scott, is his inheritance. It tinges life, colours thought, and decides character. It has re- sulted in his being as intimately associated with the Border, with the legends ot the moss-trooper, as Mr. Robert Gibb is with battle, or as was Sir Noel Paton with religious symbolism and Gospel story. Scott paints himself — and that is style. His leading Jock o’ the Syde. By Tom Scott, R.S A. TOM SCOTT, R.S.A. 19 asts sketched together and, meeting again at nights, painted together. During those early years Scott not only followed art without his father's sympathy, but in the face of his opposition, as he wished his son to follow his own business. Authority, exhortation and remonstrance were, however, alike unavailing. Instead of being bent or melted, the young artist conceived only an invincible hatred of business, and was so far fortunate that, in his mother, he had a steadfast ally and comforting friend. About the time of his first exhibit, the serious work of academic education began. He entered the Trustees’ Academy in Edinburgh about 1877-78, and attended the antique class under Mr. Charles Hodder. His drawings were chiefly in chalk and water-colour, the latter by prefer- ence, which, of all the students in the class, he alone used. On entering the Life class, he was again the only pupil who employed that medium, and in it all his life studies were made. At the Trustees’ Academy Scott learned to draw, and the comparative efficiency of the training and course of study followed at that institution twenty-five years ago may be measurably estimated by the easy vigour of his work and the combined force and accuracy of all his drawings. Sam Bough was one of his unofficial teachers, and Bough’s masters became in turn Scott’s adopted guides, especially Constable, Cox, Muller of Bristol, and Fred. Walker. In figure-painting he was attracted by the Cornish pictures of Walter Langley. But of all recent and contem- porary painters, he was most powerfully drawn to Bastien Lepage, whose ‘Joan of Arc’ impressed him more deeply, he thinks, than any other picture he ever saw. Lepage he has studied in all his moods, and has thereby reached a wholly exceptional comprehension of that artist's wonderful versatility and elasticity of style. In the majority of his works, and those upon which his reputation mainly rests, Return to Hawick from Harnshole, 1514. By Tom Scott, R.S.A. Lepage is broad, but in his picture of the Maid of Orleans he paints every leaf, every little detail, with the dainty delicacy of a miniature Creswick. Taking the group — Constable, Walker, Lepage — Scott’s masters were the selection of a healthy instinct, and primarily an artist’s choice. In order to perfect his art-education Scott went to Italy, where, besides studying the Old Masters, he gratified a decided antiquarian taste. His admiration was stirred by the old work of the cinque cento period, by the metal-work of Cellini and the enamelled relievos of Luca della Robbia. He made architectural studies and drawings of such works as the Arch of Titus. He made one centre of Rome and another of Florence, dividing his time between them, and occupying himself partly with work, partly with study. The Florentine people won almost as much of his attention as their art. From Italy he crossed to Tunis, and there again his attention was drawn from nature to the picturesqueness of a people new to him and strange. The majority of his I unisian sketches consisted of figure-subjects. He was, no doubt, inspired by what he saw in these wanderings, and his art-feeling was probably deepened and strengthened, but he really got little practical knowledge in the course of his travels abroad. He spent a few weeks in Paris at the time of the Exhibition of 1889, but visited none of the studios, lo sum up, his foreign touring may have quickened his artistic sense, enriched his mind, broadened his culture and raised his standard of excellence ; but, with the exception of Lepage, his masters were British and his education was Scots. As he grew older, and the range of his reading became more extended, his intellectual outlook gradually increased in scope, but his sympathies found a centre in the Border. As he turned from nature out-of-doors, and looked for something at home that might take in art the place of the picturesque, brightly-costumed figures of Italy, France and North Africa, he found it in Border ballad, history and tradition. In so far as traceable to an external source, Mr. Scott’s Mr. Tom Scott, R.S.A. first impulse towards Border life and story, as a field for art, came from Scott and Wilson, from “ Guy Mannering,” “ The Lay of the Last Minstrel,” “ Marmion,” “ Border Minstrelsy ” and the “ Tales.” Mr. Scott never uses oil, and does not paint portraits. Apart from history, tradition and minstrelsy, he is partial to Border landscape. He is deeply touched by the subtle spell of the Border, the melancholy charm that rests alike upon upland and river, upon peel-tower and ruined keep. They all lie under the magic light lingering in the wake of “ days that are no more.” The occupations of Mr. Scott’s leisure all tend to keep him in touch with nature, and so have a sustaining influence upon his art. He sees Nature in both her sunny and shadowed moods when, fishing-rod in hand, he rambles by Ettrick, Tweed and Yarrow. Her wintry mien is equally familiar, watched from the curling rink between the blood- red sun at dawn crimsoning her robe of white, and the frosty sunset in the copper-coloured west. With angling and curling Mr. Scott combines the studious pastime of an antiquary. He has gathered many relics of the ancient Britons, knives, axes and arrow-heads of flint, up the vale of Yarrow and in Berwickshire, about his old home at Earlston. Imagination hovers between the living world and antiquity, between Ettrick Kirk and Druid ritual, and one more strand is added by the artist antiquary to the bond between present and past. These things show the impossibility of dividing the man’s life from the career of the artist. Like many other painters, and those the most capable, Mr. Scott cannot be classified. He has given as formally accurate renderings of many scenes as the rankest realist could desire; and, thinking out a border foray or adventure sung by the minstrels, he has pictured them with all the harmonised The Legend of Ladywood. By Tom Scott, R.S.A. THE ART JOURNAL TOM SCOTT, R.S.A. 21 completeness, the unbroken unity of effect, at which, from Tintoretto’s day to the present, impressionists have aimed. It can only lead to confusion to assort into sects the men who, looked at broadly, ignore them. The realities of Mr. Scott’s life, its physical setting, his studies, pursuits, all the outlets of a Scottish Borderer’s vitality, have this bearing upon his art — that the one is the complement and counterpart of the other. Art is the outcome of life. It may be that landscape does not move Mr. Scott so deeply as historical or legendary incident. He seems, at any rate, to be less sympathetic in the former than in figure-painting. His style in the latter is more manifestly individual, more of a personal development, than in landscape. His imagination creates a unity, centred in movement and interest, one in conception and effect : his eye, less comprehensive, seizes upon Nature’s details. This, however, is distinctive of his practice in every walk — he approaches all his subjects from the inside. While another painter seems to stand aloof from his theme, and to state only an external and visual impression, Mr. Scott establishes himself in the heart of it, and having assimilated it in spirit, action, in aspect, signifi- cance or passion, lays these down in their totality in colour. One of the latest and best of the moss-trooper pictures is seen in the illustration quaintly entitled ‘ Reparabit cornua Phcebe.’ Not only will the moon “refill her horns,” but, from the cattle in the middle distance, the inference is that a successful moonlight raid is bidding fair to replenish the raiders’ store of horned cattle. Arts and Crafts. F' ROM Nature, the embodied joy of life, and Toil, the service of the living spirit, came, as is written in an ancient scripture, Invention, their fair daughter, who received from the Creator the gift of being, and power to rule all potencies of creation. As above, so below, written on the stone tablets that are the record of the imperishable law accomplished through the changing forms of life. Wherever Nature is an awakened spirit of joy, and Work a joyful energy, their issue — Invention — receives life and rules activity to beauty, so that what is made is created. Art in all its forms, of substance, of sound, of movement, of creative words, is the type of that archetypal power whose being is in the fulfilment by all things of their essential beauty, the manifestation of life in transfiguration. The belief in art as a creative force issuing from the spirit and the energy of life, possessing as its kingdom all human capability to perceive and to construct, implies, for the student, its study and appreciation in all inventive uses of material. For the artist it implies the widest possible recognition of the functions of art. So long as uninspired life and drudgery are driven together to produce mechanically the utilities of life, so long as beauty is regarded as a luxury, and the artist is only the painter or sculptor, the art that has glorious birth and fair being in the world must be a memory and a hope. Yet the hope grows stronger, and the ideal lives Designed by Edward Spencer. Executed by the Artificers’ Guild. THE ART JOURNAL. Candlesticks in wrought iron. Lamp in wrought ron with brass shade.

To-day it is represented in work, organisation, ideas, that are the utter- ance of a common faith in the desirability and use of art, and of practical acquaintance with craft-processes that no one even talked about a quarter of a century ago. Ideals that a little while since lived in the energy and inspiration of one or two men are now accepted as the creed of a multitude. But the impulse that dictated the adventure of the leader into a forsaken place of art, signifies a stronger ima- ginative apprehension of the beauty and sig- nificance of a process or use of materials than the many can share. It is one thing to choose to learn a craft when it is displayed and arranged for teaching. It is another and far more intense purpose that inspires the artist who has to find his own knowledge of ma- terials and processes, and in the result of such eager research one looks to find a living invention, quick- ened by the individual life and the individual labour. In the enamels of Mr. Alexander Fisher, the reviver of the art of enamelling, and first among the many who now practise the beau- tiful, vivid craft, per- sonal delight in the art, its fitness to his imagi- native energy, are finely evidenced. He found enamelling a dead art, Altar Cross for st. Ives, a mere device of cover- Designed by Edward Spencer. ing engine-turned or Executed by the Artificers’ Guild. ARTS AND CRAFTS. 23 Bowl in translucent Pate de Verre. By A. L. Dammouse. Pot in Pate de Verre. By A. L. Dammouse. stamped metal with a crude glassy surface. Of the ex- quisite methods that had served to add imaginative beauty to the metal-work of the great goldsmiths there only remained a coarse, me- chanical travesty of champ- leve' in pieces of cheap jewel- lery. Of the infinite jewel- tinted, jewel-varied colour- range of true enamel only the crudest uniform tints were in use, their translucency, the play of dim or vivid lights, neglected. From this com- mercialised process to the masterworks of Mediaeval and Renaissance enamellers the way was forgotten. Mr. Fisher set himself to become the pupil of the masters, to master their methods, to enrich his colour-sense with the splendid fantasies they wrought on cup and casket and missal, to discipline his hand to work, like theirs, cunningly on the metal that was to re- ceive the lovely over-laying of enamel. That the metal- work, whether of the ground for the enamel, or of its set- ting, should be beautiful, is a fundamental necessity in such an endeavour ; and whether in conjunction with the lovely colour and quality of his enamels, or in use without enamel, Mr. Fisher’s metal-work is of fine skill and imagina- tion. But it is with gem-like colour, veiled or brilliant, that the artist weaves his most alluring fantasies. Thrilling like an opal with flameless fires, like a rainbow mist, like smoulder- ing sunsets, or the gleaming depths of water, deep and still in colour like the still waters or cloudless night sky, or flashing with splendour through splendour, there is no Peacock Sconce. By Alexander Fisher. magic of dream or pageant for which enamel has not a dress to offer the master-worker. In itself it is an allure- ment to the imagination to embody the irradiated figures ot saints and angels, and of the Light incarnate, or, in another mood, the enchanted vestures, gardens and gifts of legend and Faerie. Mr. Fisher’s imagination works in this luminous medium as though it were a true dream-material, one with 24 THE ART JOURNAL. (See detail in colour opposite.) The Song of the Storm. By Alexander Fisher. cross of life, not of death, of hope and faith through the life that is seen to what is unseen. The towered city with its gleaming jewel-lights ; the vine stem and branches intertwined in symbol of the manifold life that has one root, one fruitage, one sacramental use ; the gathering of the birds in the four angles of the cross, the blade-like cleanness of the upper cross, the symbols of the fourfold message, and the central enamel of the Lamb, are as delicate and fine in workmanship as they are significant. In colour, too, whether of the metals used or of the enamel, it is a fine invention. The one failure is in the base, where the treatment of water is inexpressive, and in the pediments, which are not coherent with the rest of the design. The strong standard lamp in wrought iron with a great beaten brass shade, the simple and complex intertwisting patterns of the candelabra, if, imaginatively, work of less distinction than the altar cross, are not less valuable in their kind, nor less delightful to discover among the strained or clumsy forms of most recent light-holding objects. The name of Dammouse signifies much that is vivid and exquisite in the ceramic art of modern France. In his work there is a delicate particularity of effect which only the rare masters of potting can achieve. It is the work of a virtuoso, yet the display of power is in reticence, in the precise attaining of some dainty motif of butterflies and flower-petals on the translucent shape of a little bowl. Pure colour, glowing or pale, an exquisite surface, nothing that is not fine, and finely used, are notes of the art of M. Dammouse. The bowls and goblet in pate de verve, translucent and opaque, are examples shown in the last summer exhibition of the Socie'te' Nationale des Beaux Arts. the idea. Only by setting intimate or splendid pieces of his work beside any ancient or modern enamel is one re- minded how individual, and therefore how practised and disciplined an art this is, whose beauty suggests no toil, but only swift delight. Yet its origin is in patient labour to discover and perfect fine methods of work, and in- dividual life and toil live in the fair invention of each piece. Recent metal-work by the Arti- ficers’ Guild includes an altar cross for St. Ives, Cornwall — where already fine work of the Guild is in use— in beauty of form and colour the true expression of the harmony of idea which informs it in every part. Mr. Spencer has never designed a more beautiful cross, and that such work takes shape in our own times is an assurance to rest on, when, sometimes, it seems as though our effort after beauty only measured its strangeness to our invention : as if, for this genera- tion, only the dust and heat were to show that the race is once again renewed whose vision and final end is the immortal garland.

BY ALEXANDER FISHER. Recent Publications Venice, its individual growth, from the earliest beginnings to the fall of the Republic, by Pompeo Molmenti, translated by Horatio F. Brown (vol. i., the Middle Ages, two parts, Murray, 21s.), is the work of trained historians, whose other studies ensure special attention and support to the present work. The story of the Veneti, their commercial and social life, their wars and sports, is attractively written down and illustrated. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh is the seasonable book of W. Graham Robertson (Lane, \"js . 6 d.) ; simple, beautiful thoughts and refined illustrations. This year the drawings are reproduced in colours, and the interest of the book is thereby increased. The twelve designs, and the book of words, “ pageants for a baby girl,” show that the dexterous touch has not forsaken Mr. Graham Robertson. In preparing entertainment for his Little Woman, the artist shows rare imagination, and the new volume is a welcome addition to the others. An important work of history, illustrated with reproductions of many rare engravings and pictures, is The Golden Hays of the Renaissance in Rome (from the Pontificate of Julius II. to that of Paul III.), by Rodolfo Lanciani (Constable, 2Ij.). This study of a new period in the artistic and social life of Rome is of absorbing interest, and Professor Lanciani’s volume of research is a desirable addition to the library. One of the most successful of travel books lately issued is The Shores of the Adriatic (the Italian side), an architectural and archaeological pilgrimage by F. Hamilton Jackson, R.B.A. (Murray, 2 is.). The lesser places on the east of Italy have not attracted a fair proportion of visitors, but the coast towns leave little to be desired for picturesqueness and interest. Line reproductions of sketches by the author, and half-tone blocks from photographs by Mr. J. Cooper Ashton complete the descriptions. A delightful book of imaginative costume is Flowers from Shakespeare’s Garden, by Walter Crane (Cassell, 6s.), a book of fancies inscribed to the Countess of Warwick, whose old English garden at Easton Lodge inspired the designs. Here are forty masterly plates in colours, in which floral ly-dressed figures represent the blossoms and plants mentioned in the plays. From Messrs. Cassell comes also The MacWhirter Sketch Book (5 s.), an album of twenty-four bright illustrations in colours, and many other reproductions from sketches in Scotland, Switzerland and Italy. Mr. MacWhirter gives place-notes, and Mr. Edwin Bale contributes an introduction. Decorative Plant and Flower Studies, by J. Foord (Batsford, 30 s.), a book for the use of artists, designers, students, and others, contains forty colour-plates, a description of each plant, and 450 studies of growth and detail. Size, imperial quarto. Miss Foord’s similar book, “Decorative Flower Studies,” commended her work to those who need such facts of nature ; and, as Mr. Lewis F. Day notes in his introduction to the present volume, there are occasions when, the living thing being out of reach, such a work of reference is indispensable. Aims and Ideals in Art, eight lectures delivered to the students of the Royal Academy by George Clausen, A.R.A. (Methuen, 5j-.), is as full of sound reasoning and expert advice as the author’s work, “ Six Lectures on Painting,” which has proved so acceptable. Pro- fessor Clausen introduces many illustrations to support his words. An account of the country and the peasantry of Southern Siam is given in Lotus Land, by P. A. Thompson (Werner Laurie, 1 6j. ) . The frontispiece is a colour reproduction of a sketch by Nai Cham, a Siamese artist, and the other illustrations, with the exception of the map, are from sketches and photographs made during a three years’ visit. An instructive and interesting book, by a keen observer. In Saunterings in Spain (Unwin, ioj. 6 </.), Frederick H. A. Seymour visits Barcelona, strikes inland to Madrid, and on his iourney south touches Toledo, Cordova, Seville and Granada. The author wished to explore the cities where the Moors founded their greatest seats, and with some help from a camera he records his impressions. The Life of Auguste Rodin, by Frederick Lawton (Unwin, 15J.), is a substantial record of the famous sculptor, who has achieved distinction in history. Many of the works of genius reproduced in the book have been seen in exhibitions, and soon London will possess a public monument by the artist. Mr. Lawton has enjoyed the confidence of M. Rodin, and he has given a good account of his interviews. Country Cottages and Week End Homes, by J. H. Elder- Duncan (Cassell, 5 s.), gives information on a subject which is attrac- tive to those who intend to secure such retreats, and to those who care only to know what others are doing. Here are designs by many architects, and photographs of completed homes ; and the subjects of water supply, lighting, and other needs are considered. A more imposing volume, with many illustrations in colours, is Houses and Gardens, by M. H. Baillie Scott (Newnes, 31J'. 6d.). Here are shown the schemes and devices which have given to the author his place of importance in the list of designers of country residences and furniture. In this book of bright ideas there are some effects which seem curious on paper ; but Mr. Scott’s practical know- ledge is well known, and his work is always refreshing. An attractive volume for presentation is Stories of the Italian Artists (from Vasari), arranged and translated by E. L. Seeley (Chatto and Windus, 7 s. 6 d., or bound in while parchment, with extra plates, 15.F.). The book does not pretend to be critical, and Miss Seeley gives history and anecdotes with agreeable prudence. Well printed, and illustrated with reproductions, some in colours, from pictures of the period. Chats on Old Prints, by Arthur Hayden (Unwin, 5-r.), gives much useful information in the popular manner of “ Chats on Old China” and “Furniture,” by the same author. The collector is told the best works to seek, and whether steel or wood engravings, mezzo- tints or etchings take his fancy, he will find some guiding references in this book. In similar style is Chats on Costume, by G. Woollis- croft Bhead, R.E. (Unwin, 5J.). The author treats the subject of dress as an artistic matter, a decorative art of the first importance to the larger half of the community. Both books are suitably illustrated. Collectors of engravings will find interest in the octavo edition of Eighteenth Century Colour Prints, by Julia Frankau (Macmillan, 7 s. 6d.). “ A short resume of the little that is on record of the art of printing copper-plate engravings in colour.” No illustrations. From the Clarendon Press, Oxford, edited by C. F. Bell, comes Evelyn’s Sculptura (5.5-.), “or the History and Art of Chalcography and Engraving in Copper, with an ample enumeration of the most renowned Masters and their works. To which is annexed a new manner of Engraving or Mezzo Tinto communicated by His Highness Prince Rupert to the Authour of this Treatise, 1662.” The book contains much that is of interest to artists and readers. It is one in the “ Tudor and Stuart Library ” series, and collectors will do well to add to their possessions such a fine and cheap example of book reproduction. The demand for simple designs produces Wood -Carving Patterns from oak furniture of the Jacobean period, a series of thirty examples selected and drawn in facsimile from rubbings by Margaret F. Malim (Batsford, 8j. 6 d.). In a smaller portfolio with the title Wood- Carving Designs, by Muriel Moller (Batsford, 6s.), Mr. Walter Crane introduces six sheets of original desigus by an accomplished carver. These thirty-one working drawings will be of use to students and amateurs. Messrs. Newnes have added to their “Drawings of Great Masters” series Leonardo da Vinci, by C. Lewis Hind (7 s. 6 d.), and Gainsborough, by Lord Ronald Gower ( -js . 6 d.) ; to their “Great Etchers” series, William Strang, A.R.A. , by Frank Newbolt (\"js. 6 d.) ; to their “Art Library” series, Correggio, by E 26 THE ART JOURNAL. Selwyn Brinton (y. 6c/.) ; and to their series on the National Gallery, The Spanish, French and German Schools, by Walter Baytos (3J. 6 d.). Part 8 of The Churches of Shropshire, by D. H. S. Cranage (Hobson, of Wellington), deals with the Hundred of Bradford (North). The photographs are by Mr. Martin J. Harding, and the ground plan of Shawbury by Mr. W. Arthur Webb. Messrs. Macmillan publish Crome’s Etchings, a catalogue and an appreciation, Vvith some account of the artist’s paintings, by H. S. Theobald (ioj. 6c'.). No illustrations. A second edition, revised and enlarged, of A Manual of Historic Ornament, by Bichard Glazier, is now ready (Batsford, 6s.). The Calendarium Londinense, the London Almanack for 1907, by W. Monk, R.E. (Elkin Mathews, is. 6c/.), is headed by an etching of Hyde Park Corner, with miscellaneous traffic passing by and through the screen hext Apsley House. The type is set up at the artist’s private press, and the whole sheet as printed is good evidence of the advantage of personal enterprise compared with distributed labour. The plate for 1907 of the Art Union of London is Day-dreams, painted by W. R. Symonds, and engraved in mezzotint by E. M. Hester. Every subscriber of one guinea gets the certain reward of an impression on India paper of this excellent plate, with a chance of the original painting at the drawing in April. Among other publications may be mentioned The Old Castle Vennal of Stirling, by J. S. Fleming [Stirling Observer office), illustrated by eighty drawings by the author ; Model and Common Object Drawing, by E. A. Branch (Ralph, Holland, is. 6 d.) ; The Fesole Club Papers, lessons in sketching, by W. G. Colling- wood (Holmes, of Ulverston, 2s- 6z/. ) ; Art Crafts for Beginners, by F. G.

By Frank NT OVEMBER is, “ exhibitionally,” always one of the J plethoric months. Like May, it flows with pictorial milk and honey, though not all the kine have been on rich pastures, not all the bees on sun-awakened flowers. There were more new exhibitions than days in November, and at least a dozen were in varying degrees attractive, save for those entrenched behind outworks of invincible ignorance or invincible indifference. The societies which organised shows included the New English, the Portrait Painters, the R.oyal Water-Colour, the “ Twelve,” and the “Twenty-five.” Yet again Messrs. Agnew caused us, nationally, to break the Tenth Commandment, by dis- playing a pair of masterly portraits by Hals which already Mr. Pierpont Morgan has presented to the Metropolitan Museum of New York. The modern Jew has ceased to interpret literally the commandment against the making of any graven image or the likeness of things or persons, and a representative collection of Jewish art and antiquities was brought together at the Whitechapel Gallery, its success largely due to the efforts of the enterprising secretary Mr. C. Campbell Ross. Four or five of the “ one-man ” exhibitions were im- portant. At Mr. W. B. Paterson’s gallery the portraits, the solidly serene little landscapes and river-side studies, secure as early Whistlers, by Mr. William Nicholson, prove him to be one of our most original and progressive artists. ‘ Mrs. Bristowe,’ in white sealskin coat, is a stronger character- isation, and of greater flexibility even than ‘ La Belle Chauffeuse,’ seen at the International. The gold locket, Rinder. whose content shows as a dark, is an inspiration against the white fur, shot with gold. Quite as individual is the silhouette, ‘ Mrs. Stafford of Paradise Row,’ in which Piero della Francesca is most ably brought “ up to date.” Mr. Nicholson is bold in his simplifications, and, now that he has painted more, his use of colour is expressive, not arbitrary. At Colnaghi’s were thirty-one pictures by Mr. The'odore Roussel, including a life-size study of the nude, ‘Reading Girl,’ first seen at the New English in 1887, which is one of the finest accomplishments in its kind of recent years. The ‘ Lord Milner,’ commissioned by the Town Council of Johannesburg, despite excellent passages, is not throughout on a level with some of the delicately perceived, exquisitely gradated nocturnes, small full-length portraits, and sunlit little studies of sea and land. Mr. Arthur Rackham found a congenial theme in ‘ Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens ’ for a fresh series of his deft, daring, ingeniously intricate water-colours. He can, so to say, delve into the realm of gruesome grotesque, dance light- somely on the eternal green of the fairies, balance himself on a gossamer film, or wing his way towards the blue with the ‘ Little White Bird.’ Of the Brabazon Memorial Exhibition at Goupil’s the critic of the Daily Telegraph wrote with rare understanding and sympathy in that paper on November 21. The article should be read in conjunc- tion with Mr. Sargent’s informed estimate of Brabazon, pe"
