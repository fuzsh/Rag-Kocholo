        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia, May 4 (AP)—An exhibition of nine paintings attributed to the late American artist Jackson Pollock will be dismantled and sent to the United States for a check of their authenticity, the exhibitor said yesterday.\n\nPollack authorities, the artist's wife and local art critics have raised the possibility the works were forgeries. But the exhibitor, Bohdan Ledwij, a gallery owner from Perth, said he still believed they were genuine.\n\n“I am no expert,” he said, “and have never claimed to be, but I have documentary evidence these are genuine Po'locks.” He did not elaborate, but said the paintings were being sent to Los Angeles, where his legal adviser would start an investigation.\n\nClement Greenberg, an authority on the Expressionist painter‐ who died in 1956, told The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday from New ‘Ybrk that six of the paintings recently reproduced in an Australian magazine were not Pollocks.\n\nA New York lawyer for Pollock's wife, the artist Lee Krasner, said she noted that four of the works were supposedly studies for his large painting “Blue Poles,” but that Pollock had never made such studies.\n\n“Blue Poles” was bought by the Australian Government five years ago for $1.5 million and is in storage until a national museum is built in the capital, Canberra.\n\nSome of the paintings on display here were listed as being four separate studies: “Blue Polls,” “Autumn Song,” “Arabesque” (Nos. 2, 12 and 18) and “Vacant Spaces.”\n\nGerald Dickler, lawyer for Pollock's wife, was quoted in Australian news dispatches as saying a four‐volure catalogue of Pollock's works by the Yale University Press did not include any of the studies in question.\n\nMr. Ledwij offered no explanation of the titles, including the use of “polls,” but critics said the names could have been given by private owners.\n\nNancy Borlase, art critic for The Morning Herald, wrote: “A satisfactory explanation of provenance has yet to be supplied. While admittedly titles were appended without the concurrence of the artist, the misnomer ‘Blue Polls’ for ‘Blue Poles’ does little to inspire confidence.”\n\nShe described the largest painting In the exhibition, “Arabesque No. 2,” as beign “devoid of the Pollock magic.” “It is signed at the back,” she added, “and it is on aged canvas, with a lively overlay of the well‐known drip technique. If ever there was a bad Pollbck, this is it.”\n\nThe other paintings are on paper, vacuum pressed on hardboard between sheets of rice’ paper, all handsomely framed.\n\nMiss Borlase said she‐saw “no hint of the great neurotic genius, the wild anguished man” in the paintings."
