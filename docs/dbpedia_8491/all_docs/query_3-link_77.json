        "text": "ELINOR WROBEL: August 24, 1933 – March 12, 2023\n\nElinor Wrobel was born in the slums of Paddington during the Great Depression, and became a fixture of the Sydney art world who set up a museum in her own home for one of Australia’s most renowned modernist artists, John Passmore.\n\nJust before her death last month, Wrobel had been working with auction house Bonhams on a sale of her artworks which took place on Sunday. She was 89, and it was typical that she had been working almost to the end.\n\nShe was born Elinor Ring in pre-war Paddington when the now-desirable Sydney suburb was full of the unemployed and the desperate. She had a difficult relationship with her mother Freda. Her father, John Ring, was a bus driver who brought her up to make her own way in the world. She took her father’s words to heart. Wrobel became a prime mover in Sydney’s cultural life as an art collector, a commercial art gallery director and a curator.\n\nShe once threatened to go on hunger strike to save the medical history museum she had established at Sydney Hospital, having been a nurse at the hospital in the years following her graduation from St Catherine’s school in Waverley in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.\n\nIn 1957 Elinor married Fred Wrobel, who had migrated from Poland to Australia after losing his entire family in the Holocaust. The couple established the Woolloomooloo Art Gallery in 1983, where they exhibited new art and displayed retrospective exhibitions of artists they believed were unjustly neglected.\n\nWrobel loved artists, and they were always part of the rich brew of Sydney creatives and members of the cognoscenti who attended her salon-style gatherings at her Double Bay home. Wrobel’s “adoption” of one such artist in particular would lead to one of her most impressive achievements – the creation of the John Passmore Museum of Art in 2003.\n\nPassmore was a difficult, eccentric man who came to rely heavily on Wrobel’s interest in him. After he rang her one day, distraught and threatening to destroy all his artworks, she raced to his decrepit digs and talked him out of it.\n\nIt was a ploy Passmore used again. Barry Pearce, emeritus curator of Australian art, Art Gallery of NSW, received a similar call from Passmore at about the same time. Worried and upset about the artist, Pearce convinced a reluctant Edmund Capon, then director of the AGNSW, to send a truck to collect all Passmore’s work and bring it to the gallery for safekeeping.\n\nThere it stayed, until the death of the cantankerous and reclusive Passmore in October 1984 revealed that he had left the entire cache of 270 paintings and drawings to Wrobel. The artworks were valued at about $1.3 million.\n\nBut the path to her possession of the works was not smooth. Passmore’s estranged widow and son had received about $70,000 in the will. They were bequeathed no artworks. They immediately launched legal action in the NSW Supreme Court.\n\nThe case heard that Wrobel had been a close friend and confidante of Passmore. But the artist’s widow and son John claimed Passmore had lacked testamentary capacity, or had come under undue influence before signing his will in May 1984.\n\nIn November 1989, after four years of legal wrangling, the judge pronounced in favour of the will, under the terms of a settlement that were not to be disclosed. Wrobel was left with a huge amount of art, and needed to do something with it.\n\nShe and Fred sold up their Woolloomooloo art gallery as well as their Double Bay home of 45 years. They acquired the former Merryfield Hotel, a pub in Woolloomooloo near the Art Gallery of NSW. Here the Wrobels established the John Passmore Museum of Art on the ground floor. The couple lived in the two storeys above the gallery.\n\nLoading\n\nThe museum was open on weekends and by appointment, and regularly welcomed tour groups of like-minded art lovers. Cramming the upstairs living quarters were hundreds of pictures by Australian artists such as Nancy Borlase, Max Meldrum, Adelaide Perry, Jean Appleton, Dorothy Thornhill, Elaine Haxton, Portia Geach, David Strachan and Roy de Maistre.\n\nWrobel described herself as “custodian” of the work, and was generous in lending paintings to exhibitions. She even created entire exhibitions out of the collection and formed alliances with NSW regional art galleries to tour these exhibitions to as large an audience as possible.\n\nWhen she was a young woman, Elinor’s father had urged her to study pharmacy. She dreamt of studying stage design, but the times were not favourable. Instead, Elinor became a nurse at Sydney Hospital, working alongside surgeons in theatre. She was fascinated.\n\nPolish-born Fred Wrobel had arrived in Sydney after losing his entire family in the Holocaust. He took to crewing on sailing boats on Sydney Harbour, and it was in this environment that he met Elinor. They married in 1957.\n\nFred Wrobel, a boat builder, began to collect maritime artworks. That obsession soon broadened to encompass other types of art, and the couple became fixtures in Sydney’s art scene, regularly buying works in galleries and at auction.\n\nThe family home assumed a salon atmosphere, as art historian Joanna Mendelssohn noted in an essay for the Bonhams auction. “Small gems by some of Australia’s best-known artists were hung next to works by artists not even mentioned in standard art histories,” Mendelssohn wrote.\n\n“Works by some of these artists were held in storage at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, but for the most part the paintings in the Wrobel collection were more interesting.\n\n“The many paintings by women meant that in 1995 the Penrith Regional Art Gallery was able to hold a comprehensive exhibition, Australian Women Artists of the 20th Century, drawn entirely from the Wrobel collection.”\n\nElinor left her Sydney Hospital job before the birth of her first child. But she returned to the institution decades later to establish the Lucy Osburn-Nightingale Museum in 2001. Human hairballs, gallstones and diseased bones were lovingly displayed by Elinor, who described all the exhibits as “beautiful”.\n\nPassmore wasn’t the only eccentric Wrobel championed. She was also fascinated by the Australian composer Percy Grainger, and did a great deal of consultant curatorial and conservation work for the University of Melbourne’s Percy Grainger Museum.\n\nElinor Wrobel was an avid conservationist. In 2004 she and gallery owner Stephen Mori spent two weeks living in a tent under a threatened fig tree in the Domain. The fig tree was saved.\n\nShe even claimed to have been the one who publicly revealed Grainger’s unusual sexual proclivities. Wrobel sought the clearance of police before displaying whips and other objects in one of her Grainger exhibitions, just in case of public indignation or complaints.\n\nIn 2009 she told Richard Fidler on ABC Radio’s Conversations program that Madame Lash (aka Gretel Pinniger) had told her she was the only person brave enough to publicly display Pinniger’s dominatrix gear.\n\nIn the early Paddington days, Elinor’s aunt had taught her to sew. This expanded into a lifelong love of fashions and costumes, and led to Elinor’s work with costumes for theatrical productions and with various costume conservation projects."
