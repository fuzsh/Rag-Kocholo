[MUSIC] Milton Ebbins (19122008) Film executive, songwriter (\"Yale Blues\", \"Basic Boogie\") and composer. Ebbins helped produce JFKs 1961 Inaugural Ball and the subsequent 1962 JFK Anniversary Gala. In May of 1962, Ebbins escorted a very late Marilyn Monroe to Madison Square Garden where she famously  and breathlessly  sang Happy Birthday, Mr. President. He was also the man that Lawford called after speaking to Monroe the night of her death in August of 1962. Ebbins was one of the few allowed inside the White House after the JFK assassination. As the link between Washington and Hollywood, Ebbins helped Kennedy family patriarch and former ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy navigate through the movie business, not only keeping him apprised of his son-in-laws career moves but at one point advising him against purchasing United Artists movie studio. At the time of his death, Ebbins was working with his friend, actor Bill Paxton, on an HBO project about the Kennedy assassination. Ebbins music career began in 1936, he formed his own orchestra, then became music director at CBS, and went to New York in 1938, joining an advertising agency's radio department. He also had been a road manager for the Jack Jenny and Count Basie orchestras, and then a personal manager. He left his career as bandleader and became a talent manager, rising to become one of Hollywoods top personal managers, guiding the careers of Count Basie, Sarah Vaughn, Billy Eckstine and singer Vic Damone. Because of Ebbins musical background and his adeptness at arranging scores, he had a knack for picking hit songs for his clients. He also represented actresses Elizabeth Montgomery and Patty Duke, comedian Mort Sahl and actor Peter Lawford, who Ebbins managed for 35 years. TLS, 1963, 1p.

Ordained into the Unitarian church he first became an active minister at Louisville, Kentucky, then a slave state, and soon threw himself into the national movement for the abolition of slavery. In 1839 he returned to Boston where he and his friends established (1841) the Church of the Disciples which brought together a body of people to apply the Christian religion to social problems of the day. Clarke contributed essays to The Christian Examiner, The Christian Inquirer, The Christian Register, The Dial, Harper's, The Index, and Atlantic Monthly. In addition to sermons, speeches, hymnals, and liturgies, he published 28 books and over 120 pamphlets during his lifetime. In 1855, Clarke purchased the former site of Brook Farm, intending to start a new Utopian community there. This never came to pass, instead the land was offered to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War; the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training and named it \"Camp Andrew\". In November 1861, Clarke was in Washington, D.C. with Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe. After hearing the song \"John Brown's Body\", he suggested that Mrs. Howe write new lyrics; the result was \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\". ALS, 1874, 1p, 5x8\". VG...........50-75\n\n9.

Salvini's most famous role was Othello, which he played for the first time at Vicenza in June 1856. Salvini acted frequently in England, and made five visits to the United States, his first in 1873 and his last in 1889. In 1886 he played Othello to the lago of Edwin Booth. Salvini's acting in Othello greatly inspired the young Russian actor Constantin Stanislavski, who saw Salvini perform in Moscow in 1882 and who would, himself, go on to become one of the most important theatre practitioners in the history of theatre. Stanislavski wrote that Salvini was the \"finest representative\" of his own approach to acting.

[FILM] Norma Zarky (1917-1977) was a prominent lawyer in Los Angeles, active in the fight for abortion rights and other civil rights. She then worked for a number of lawyers, including Joseph L. Rauh, Jr., a prominent civil rights lawyer, and for Arthur Goldberg. She co-authored a number of briefs with Rauh on civil rights cases during the 1950s. In 1954, during the McCarthy Era, the Department of Justice sought to fire Hilbert Zarky from his position with the Department, based primarily on Normas very brief involvement with Communism when she was an undergraduate in the mid-1930s, along with such crimes as their belonging to a liberal book club and being at meetings attended by suspect individuals. After she and her husband filed numerous declarations from friends and prominent individuals regarding their loyalty to the United States, he was reinstated to his position. In 1961 joined the law firm of Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, becoming the firms first woman partner in 1968. At Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, she practiced primarily in the field of entertainment law. Zarky was the first woman to serve as President of the Beverly Hills Bar Association and was a founding member of Women in Film. She was influential in establishing Public Counsel, which is now the largest pro bono public interest law firm in the world. She also was active in the Constitutional Rights Foundation. She was also a founder of California Women Lawyers. Zarky was particularly active in the fight for legalized abortion. She was one of the two leading California attorneys strategizing the legal battles. She authored the ACLUs amicus brief in People v. Belous, in which the California Supreme Court upheld a womans right to abortion. She then wrote an amicus brief on behalf of the American Association of University Women in Roe v. Wade, the case that established the right to abortion on a nationwide basis. In 1979, Women in Film established The Norma Zarky Humanitarian Award, which is presented to individuals who, like Ms. Zarky herself, have demonstrated enlightened support for the advancement of equal opportunity for all and devotion to the improvement of the human condition. Lengthy TLS, 1965, 1p, to Milt Ebbins, Chrislaw productions, about Bill Asher, mentioning the film JOHNNY COOL and The Patty Duke Show.

Details of the early life of the Morgan family, which included three other sisters besides Angela and a brother Albert, are somewhat scanty. According to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan, which has custody of Angela Morgan's earlier papers, she was most likely born circa. 1875 or thereabouts during the time when her family was residing in Yazoo County, Mississippi. Her given name at birth was \"Nina Lillian\" which she later changed to Angela. According to the Bentley sketch her father was Albert Talmon Morgan, a Quaker, who had left Oberlin College in 1861 to join the Union Army where he rose to the rank of Lt. Colonel. After the war he settled as a \"carpetbagger\" on a plantation in Mississippi where he met and married Carolyn Victoria Highgate (1860-1926), the daughter of a mulatto father and a white mother, and who was a teacher in the Freedmen's Bureau. His experiences in Mississippi during Reconstruction are described in his book Yazoo, Or On the Pickett Line of Freedom in the South (1884). From 1876 until 1885 the family resided in Washington, D.C. The Morgans then moved to Lawrence, Kansas where Col. Morgan engaged in business and in the practice of law. But he proved unsuccessful at both. In 1890 he left his family in Topeka to prospect for gold and silver in Colorado, returning to visit his family only occasionally. He died in Denver on April 15, 1922. After the departure of their father the Morgan sisters formed a quartet, and managed by their brother Albert who also sang baritone, earned their livelihood on the stage by giving musical performances as \"The Morgan Sisters\" and \"The Angela Sisters\". The group apparently performed until 1898 when the death of one of the sisters (Helen) and the marriage of the others ended the collaboration. Angela then became a journalist. A major break in her career which permitted her to escape from the drudgery of newspaper work and to devote herself entirely to creative writing occurred in 1915 when a prominent preacher (G. Campbell Morgan) whom she had been assigned to interview, read her poem \"God's Man\" from his pulpit in New York. This led to its publication in Collier's Weekly, and to the launching of her career as a free lance poet and author. Offered here is a nice 8x10 sepia photograph boldly signed on the front \"Faithfully yours Angela Morgan.\" On the back she has and inscribed it to Rev.

[ART] ALBERT STERNER (1863-1946) Noted American artist. OFFERED HERE: ORIGINAL charcoal drawing unsigned, image size approx. 9-1/2 x 8 in. plus margins. The image is in very good condition. STERNER'S influence is seen in the works of both Rockwell Kent and George Bellows who he introduced to the technique of lithography and put in touch with master printer/artist Bolton Brown. In 1915, Sterner rallied a group of printmakers together to raise the general quality of American prints. The founders of the Painter-Gravers of America included, along with Sterner, Childe Hassam, Bellows, & George Elmer Brown. He became a member of the National Academy, won a bronze medal at the Paris Exposition of 1900; gold medal at Munich in 1905, a bronze at Buffalo Exposition in 1901, and Carnegie Prize in 1941. He was President of Soc. of Illustrators, 1907-09. Sterner concentrated increasingly on portraits of famous people, for which ultimately he was to become best known. His personality, wit, charm, erudition, and talent endeared him to many of his famous patrons. His opinions - definite and energetically stated - were such that he took no nonsense from sitters, which included the nobility and gentry of three generations, among them, the Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Reids, Wideners, Armours, and members of the royal family of Siam.

White was able to capture a number of equivalent French, Spanish and Dutch vessels and on one occasion was instrumental in the destruction of a much larger French frigate by a British squadron. In 1798 he was with the squadron that discovered the French invasion attempt on Ireland and acted as a messenger in the campaign to destroy the invasion force that ended at the Battle of Tory Island. He was later flag captain for Sir John Borlase Warren and participated at the Action of 13 March 1806 and the destruction of the Regulus in 1814.
