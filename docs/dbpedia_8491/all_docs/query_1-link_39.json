        "text": "Tamara Łempicka, commonly known as Tamara de Lempicka (16 May 1898 – 18 March 1980) was a Polish Art Deco painter and “the first woman artist to be a glamour star”. Influenced by Cubism, Lempicka became the leading representative of the Art Deco style across two continents, a favorite artist of many Hollywood stars, referred to as ‘the baroness with a brush’. She was the most fashionable portrait painter of her generation among the haute bourgeoisie and aristocracy, painting duchesses and grand dukes and socialites. Through her network of friends, she was also able to display her paintings in the most elite salons of the era. Lempicka was criticized as well as admired for her ‘perverse Ingrism’, referring to her modern restatement of the master Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, as displayed in her work Group of Four Nudes (1925) among other studies.\n\nLife\n\nShe was born Maria Górska in Warsaw, Congress Poland under the rulership of the Russian Empire, into a wealthy and prominent family. Lempicka was the daughter of Boris Gurwik-Górski, a Russian Jewish attorney for a French trading company, and Malwina Dekler, a Polish socialite who met him at one of the European spas. Maria had two siblings and was the middle child. She attended a boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and spent the winter of 1911 with her grandmother in Italy and on the French Riviera, where she was treated to her first taste of the Great Masters of Italian painting. In 1912, her parents divorced, and Maria went to live with her rich Aunt Stefa in St. Petersburg, Russia. When her mother remarried, she became determined to break away to make a life of her own. In 1913, at the age of fifteen, while attending the opera, Maria spotted the man she became determined to marry. She promoted her campaign through her well-connected uncle, and in 1916 she married Tadeusz Łempicki (1888–1951) in St. Petersburg—a well-known ladies’ man, gadabout, and lawyer by title, who was tempted by the significant dowry.\n\nIn 1917, during the Russian Revolution, Tadeusz Łempicki was arrested in the dead of night by the Bolsheviks. Maria searched the prisons for him and after several weeks, with the help of the Swedish consul, she secured his release. They traveled to Copenhagen then to London and finally to Paris, to where Maria’s family had also escaped.\n\nParis and painting\n\nIn Paris, the Lempickis lived for a while from the sale of family jewels. Tadeusz proved unwilling or unable to find suitable work, which added to the domestic strain, while Maria gave birth to Kizette Lempicka. Her sister, the designer Adrienne Gorska, made furniture for her Paris apartment and studio in the Art Deco style, complete with chrome-plated furniture. The flat at 7 Rue Mechain was built by the architect Robert Mallet-Stevens known for his clean lines.\n\nLempicka’s distinctive and bold artistic style developed quickly, influenced by what André Lhote sometimes referred to as “soft cubism” and by the “synthetic cubism” of Maurice Denis, epitomizing the cool yet sensual side of the Art Deco movement. For her, Picasso “embodied the novelty of destruction”. She thought that many of the Impressionists drew badly and employed “dirty” colors. Lempicka’s technique would be novel, clean, precise, and elegant.\n\nFor her first major show, in Milan, Italy in 1925, under the sponsorship of Count Emmanuele Castelbarco, Lempicka painted 28 new works in six months. A portrait would take three weeks of work, allowing for the nuisance of dealing with a difficult sitter; by 1927, Lempicka could charge 50,000 French francs for a portrait, a sum equal to about US$2,000 then and more than ten times as much today. Through Castelbarco, she was introduced to Italy’s great man of letters and notorious lover, Gabriele d’Annunzio. She visited the poet twice at his villa on Lake Garda, seeking to paint his portrait; he in turn was set on seduction. After her unsuccessful attempts to secure the commission, she went away angry, while d’Annunzio also remained unsatisfied.\n\nIn 1925, Lempicka painted her iconic work Auto-Portrait (Tamara in the Green Bugatti) for the cover of the German fashion magazine Die Dame. As summed up by the magazine Auto-Journal in 1974, “the self-portrait of Tamara de Lempicka is a real image of the independent woman who asserts herself. Her hands are gloved, she is helmeted, and inaccessible; a cold and disturbing beauty [through which] pierces a formidable being—this woman is free!” In 1927 Lempicka won her first major award, the first prize at the Exposition Internationale des Beaux Arts in Bordeaux, France, for her portrait of Kizette on the Balcony.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties\n\nIn Paris during the Roaring Twenties, Tamara de Lempicka became part of the bohemian life: she knew Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, and André Gide. Famous for her libido, she was bisexual. Her affairs with both men and women were conducted in ways that were considered scandalous at the time. She often used formal and narrative elements in her portraits, and her nude studies produced overpowering effects of desire and seduction. In the 1920s she became closely associated with lesbian and bisexual women in writing and artistic circles, such as Violet Trefusis, Vita Sackville-West, and Colette. She also became involved with Suzy Solidor, a night club singer at the Boîte de Nuit, whose portrait she later painted. Her husband eventually tired of their arrangement and abandoned her in 1927. They were divorced in 1931 in Paris.\n\nObsessed with her work and her social life, Lempicka neglected more than her husband; she rarely saw her daughter. When Kizette was not away at boarding school (France or England), the girl was often with her grandmother Malvina. When Lempicka informed her mother and daughter that she would not be returning from America for Christmas in 1929, Malvina was so angry that she burned Lempicka’s enormous collection of designer hats; Kizette watched them burn, one by one.\n\nKizette was neglected, but also immortalized. Lempicka painted her only child repeatedly, leaving a striking portrait series: Kizette in Pink, 1926; Kizette on the Balcony, 1927; Kizette Sleeping, 1934; Portrait of Baroness Kizette, 1954–5, etc. In other paintings, the women depicted tend to resemble Kizette.\n\nIn 1928, her longtime patron the Baron Raoul Kuffner von Diószeg (1886–1961) visited her studio and commissioned her to paint his mistress. Lempicka finished the portrait, then took the mistress’ place in the Baron’s life. She travelled to the United States for the first time in 1929, to paint a commissioned portrait for Rufus T. Bush and to arrange a show of her work at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. The show went well but the money she earned was lost when the bank she used collapsed following the Stock Market Crash of 1929.\n\nLempicka continued both her heavy workload and her frenetic social life through the next decade. The Great Depression had little effect on her; in the early 1930s she was painting King Alfonso XIII of Spain and Queen Elizabeth of Greece. Museums began to collect her works. In 1933 she traveled to Chicago where she worked with Georgia O’Keeffe, Santiago Martínez Delgado and Willem de Kooning. Her social position was cemented when she married her lover, Baron Kuffner, on 3 February 1934 in Zurich (his wife had died the year before). The Baron took her out of her quasi-bohemian life and finally secured her place in high society again, with a title to boot. She repaid him by convincing him to sell many of his estates in Eastern Europe and move his money to Switzerland. She saw the coming of World War II from a long way off, much sooner than most of her contemporaries. She did make a few concessions to the changing times as the decade passed; her art featured a few refugees and common people, and even a Christian saint or two, as well as the usual aristocrats and cold nudes.\n\nLater life\n\nIn the winter of 1939, Lempicka and her husband started an “extended vacation” in the United States. She immediately arranged for a show of her work in New York, though the Baron and Baroness chose to settle in Beverly Hills, California, living in the former residence of Hollywood director King Vidor. She cultivated a Garboesque manner. The Baroness would visit the Hollywood stars on their studio sets, such as Tyrone Power, Walter Pidgeon, and George Sanders and they would come to her studio to see her at work. She did war relief work, like many others at the time; and she managed to get Kizette out of Nazi-occupied Paris, via Lisbon, in 1941. Some of her paintings of this time had a Salvador Dalí quality, as displayed in Key and Hand, 1941. In 1943, the couple relocated to New York City. Even though she continued to live in style, socializing continuously, her popularity as a society painter had diminished greatly. They traveled to Europe frequently to visit fashionable spas and so that the Baron could attend to Hungarian refugee work. For a while, she continued to paint in her trademark style, although her range of subject matter expanded to include still lifes, and even some abstracts. Yet eventually she adopted a new style, using palette knife instead of brushes. Her new work was not well received when she exhibited in 1962 at the Iolas Gallery. Lempicka determined never to show her work again, and retired from active life as a professional artist.\n\nInsofar as she still painted at all, Lempicka sometimes reworked earlier pieces in her new style. The crisp and direct Amethyste (1946), for example, became the pink and fuzzy Girl with Guitar (1963). She showcased at the Ror Volmar Gallery in Paris from 30 May to 17 June 1961.\n\nAfter Baron Kuffner’s death from a heart attack on 3 November 1961 on the ocean liner Liberté en route to New York, she sold most of her possessions and made three around-the-world trips by ship. Finally Lempicka moved to Houston, Texas to be with Kizette and her family. (Kizette had married a man named Harold Foxhall, who was then chief geologist for the Dow Chemical Company; they had two daughters.) There she began her difficult and disagreeable later years. Kizette served as Tamara’s business manager, social secretary, and factotum, and suffered under her mother’s controlling domination and petulant behavior. Tamara complained that not only were the paints and other artists’ materials now inferior to the “old days” but that people in the 1970s lacked the special qualities and “breeding” that inspired her art. The artistry and craftsmanship of her glory days were unrecoverable. In 1978 Tamara moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico, to live among an aging international set and some of the younger aristocrats. After Kizette’s husband died of cancer, she attended her mother for three months until Tamara died in her sleep on March 18, 1980. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the volcano of Popocatepetl on 27 March 1980 by her Mexican friend Victor Manuel Contreras and her daughter Kizette.\n\nLempicka lived long enough for the wheel of fashion to turn a full circle: before she died a new generation had discovered her art and greeted it with enthusiasm. A retrospective in 1973 drew positive reviews. At the time of her death, her early Art Deco paintings were being shown and purchased once again. A stage play, Tamara, was inspired by her meeting with Gabriele D’Annunzio and was first staged in Toronto; it then ran in Los Angeles for eleven years (1984–1995) at the VFW Post, making it the longest running play in Los Angeles, and some 240 actors were employed over the years. The play was also subsequently produced at the Seventh Regiment Armory in New York City. In 2005, the actress and artist Kara Wilson performed Deco Diva, a one-woman stage play based on Lempicka’s life. Her life and her relationship with one of her models is fictionalized in Ellis Avery’s novel The Last Nude, which won the American Library Association Stonewall Book Awards Barbara Gittings Literature Award for 2013.\n\nLegacy\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter and actress Madonna is an admirer and collector of Lempicka’s work and has lent paintings to events and museums. Madonna has also featured Lempicka’s work in her music videos “Open Your Heart” (1987), “Express Yourself” (1989), “Vogue” (1990) and “Drowned World/Substitute for Love” (1998). She also used paintings by Lempicka on the sets of her 1987 Who’s That Girl and 1990 Blond Ambition world tours.\n\nOther notable Lempicka collectors include actor Jack Nicholson and singer-actress Barbra Streisand.\n\nBernard Howell Leach, CH, CBE (5 January 1887 – 6 May 1979), was a British studio potter and art teacher. He is regarded as the “Father of British studio pottery”.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years (Japan)\n\nLeach was born in Hong Kong, but spent his first years in Japan, until his father, Andrew Leach, moved back to Hong Kong in 1890. Later, he attended the Slade School of Fine Art and the London School of Art, where he studied etching under Frank Brangwyn. Reading books by Lafcadio Hearn, he became interested in Japan.\n\nIn 1909 he returned to Japan with his young wife Muriel (née Hoyle) with a view to teaching etching. In Tokyo he gave talks and attended meetings along with Mushanokōji Saneatsu, Shiga Naoya, Yanagi Sōetsu and others from the “Shirakaba-Group”, who were trying to introduce western art to Japan after 250 years of seclusion. In etching, Satomi Ton, Kojima Kikuo, and later Ryūsei Kishida, became pupils of Leach.\n\nAbout 1911 he attended a Raku-yakipottery party which was his first introduction to ceramics, and through introduction by Ishii Hakutei, he began to study under Urano Shigekichi 浦野繁吉, 1851–1923), who stood as Kenzan 6th in the tradition of potter Ogata Kenzan (1663 -1743). Assisting as interpreter for technical terms was the potter Tomimoto Kenkichi, whom he had met already earlier. From this time Leach wrote articles for the Shirakaba.\n\n1913 he also drafted covers for Shirakaba and “Fyūzan”. Attracted by the Prussian philosopher and art scholar Dr. Alfred Westharp, who at the time was living in Peking, Leach moved to Peking in 1915. There he took on the Name 李奇聞 (for “Leach”), but returned the following year to Japan. – It was the year 1919, when young Hamada Shōji visited Leach for the first time. Leach received a kiln from Kenzan and built it up in Yanai’s garden and called it Tōmon-gama. Now established as a potter, he decided to move to England.\n\nIn 1920, before leaving, he had an exhibition in Osaka, where he met the potter Kawai Kanjirō. In Tokyo, a farewell exhibition was organised.\n\nBack in England\n\nLeach returned to England in 1920 on the invitation of Frances Horne. Horne was establishing a Guild of Handicrafts within the existing artist colony of St Ives in Cornwall. On the recommendation of a family friend, Edgar Skinner, she contacted Leach to suggest that he become the potter within this group. Leach and his wife Muriel were accompanied by the young Hamada Shoji and, having identified a suitable site next to the Stennack river on the outskirts of St Ives, the two established the Leach Pottery in 1920. They constructed a traditional Japanese climbing kiln or ‘noborigama’, the first built in the West. however the kiln was poorly built and was reconstructed in 1923 by Matsubayashi Tsurunosuke. Leach promoted pottery as a combination of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. His work focused on traditional Korean, Japanese and Chinese pottery, in combination with traditional techniques from England and Germany, such as slipware and salt glaze ware. He saw pottery as a combination of art, philosophy, design and craft – even as a greater lifestyle. Publishing A Potter’s Book in 1940 defined Leach’s craft philosophy and techniques, and became his breakthrough to recognition.\n\nIn 1934, Tobey and Leach travelled together through France and Italy, then sailed from Naples to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where they parted company, Leach heading on to Japan. Leach formally joined the Bahá’í Faith in 1940. A pilgrimage to the Bahá’í shrines in Haifa, Israel, during 1954 intensified his feeling that he should do more to unite the East and West by returning to the Orient “to try more honestly to do my work there as a Bahá’í and as an artist…”\n\nMidlife\n\nLeach advocated simple and utilitarian forms. His ethical pots stand in opposition to what he called fine art pots, which promoted aesthetic concerns rather than function. Popularized in the 1940s after the publication of A Potter’s Book, his style had lasting influence on counter-culture and modern design in North America during the 1950s and 1960s. Leach’s pottery produced a range of “standard ware” handmade pottery for the general public. He continued to produce pots which were exhibited as works of art.\n\nMany potters from all over the world were apprenticed at the Leach Pottery, and spread Leach’s style and beliefs. His British associates and trainees include Michael Cardew, Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie, David and Michael Leach (his sons), Janet Darnell (whom Leach married in 1956) and William Marshall. His American apprentices include Warren MacKenzie (who likewise influenced many potters through his teaching at the University of Minnesota), Byron Temple, Clary Illian and Jeff Oestrich. He was a major influence on the leading New Zealand potter Len Castle who travelled to London to spend time working with him in the mid-1950s. Many of his Canadian apprentices made up the pottery scene of the Canadian west coast during the 1970s in Vancouver.\n\nLeach was instrumental in organising the only International Conference of Potters and Weavers in July 1952 at Dartington Hall, where he had been working and teaching. It included exhibitions of British pottery and textiles since 1920, Mexican folk art, and works by conference participants, among them Shoji Hamada and US-based Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain. Another important contributor was Japanese aesthetician Soetsu Yanagi, author of The Unknown Craftsman. According to Brent Johnson, “The most important outcome of the conference was that it helped organize the modern studio pottery movement by giving a voice to the people who became its leaders…it gave them [Leach, Hamada and Yanagi] celebrity status…[while] Marguerite Wildenhain emerged from Dartinghall Hall as the most important craft potter in America.”\n\nLater years.\n\nHe continued to produce work until 1972 and never ended his passion for travelling, which made him a precursor of today’s artistic globalism. He continued to write about ceramics even after losing his eyesight. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London held a major exhibition of his art in 1977. The Leach Pottery still remains open today, accompanied by a museum displaying many pieces by Leach and his students.\n\nHonours\n\nJapan Foundation Cultural Award, 1974.\n\nCompanion of Honour, 1973 (UK).\n\nOrder of the Sacred Treasure, 1966 (Japan).\n\nCommander of the Order of the British Empire, 1962.\n\nEdmund de Waal’s book\n\nEdmund de Waal, British ceramic artist and Professor of Ceramics at the University of Westminster, had been taught pottery by Geoffrey Whiting, a disciple of Leach, at the King’s School, Canterbury. Whilst in Japan de Waal worked on a monograph of Leach, researching Leach’s papers and journals in the archive room of the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum,\n\nDe Waal’s book on Bernard Leach was published in 1998. He described it as “the first ‘de-mystifying’ study of Leach. “The great myth of Leach,” he said, “is that Leach is the great interlocutor for Japan and the East, the person who understood the East, who explained it to us all, brought out the mystery of the East. But in fact the people he was spending time with, and talking to, were very few, highly educated, often Western educated Japanese people, who in themselves had no particular contact with rural, unlettered Japan of peasant craftsmen”.\n\nDe Waal noted that Leach did not speak Japanese and had looked at only a narrow range of Japanese ceramics.\n\nWritings (selected)\n\n1940: A Potter’s Book.

He is especially known for his postmodern work since the 1980s.\n\nIn 1930, he founded the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1978 he was awarded an American Institute of Architects Gold Medal and in 1979 the first Pritzker Architecture Prize. He was a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Johnson was gay, and has been called “the best-known openly gay architect in America.” In 1961, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1963. He came out publicly in 1993.\n\nJohnson died in his sleep while at his Glass House retreat in 2005. He was survived by his partner of 45 years, David Whitney, who died later that year at age 66.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohnson was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was descended from the Jansen family of New Amsterdam, and included among his ancestors the Huguenot Jacques Cortelyou, who laid out the first town plan of New Amsterdam for Peter Stuyvesant. He attended the Hackley School, in Tarrytown, New York, and then studied at Harvard University as an undergraduate, where he focused on history and philosophy, particularly the work of the Pre-Socratic philosophers. Johnson interrupted his education with several extended trips to Europe. These trips became the pivotal moment of his education; he visited Chartres, the Parthenon, and many other ancient monuments, becoming increasingly fascinated with architecture.\n\nIn 1928 Johnson met with architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was at the time designing the German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. The meeting was a revelation for Johnson and formed the basis for a lifelong relationship of both collaboration and competition.\n\nJohnson returned from Germany as a proselytizer for the new architecture. Touring Europe more comprehensively with his friends Alfred H. Barr, Jr. and Henry-Russell Hitchcock to examine firsthand recent trends in architecture, the three assembled their discoveries as the landmark show “The International Style: Architecture Since 1922” at the Museum of Modern Art, in 1932. The show was profoundly influential and is seen as the introduction of modern architecture to the American public. It introduced such pivotal architects as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe. The exhibition was also notable for a controversy: architect Frank Lloyd Wright withdrew his entries in pique that he was not more prominently featured.\n\nAs critic Peter Blake has stated, the importance of this show in shaping American architecture in the century “cannot be overstated.” In the book accompanying the show, coauthored with Hitchcock, Johnson argued that the new modern style maintained three formal principles: 1. an emphasis on architectural volume over mass (planes rather than solidity) 2. a rejection of symmetry and 3. rejection of applied decoration. The definition of the movement as a “style” with distinct formal characteristics has been seen by some critics as downplaying the social and political bent that many of the European practitioners shared.\n\nJohnson continued to work as a proponent of modern architecture, using the Museum of Modern Art as a bully pulpit. He arranged for Le Corbusier’s first visit to the United States in 1935, then worked to bring Mies and Marcel Breuer to the US as emigres.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1940, Johnson openly sympathized with Nazism, so by June the Office of Naval Intelligence marked him as suspected of being a spy, expressed antisemitic ideas, and was involved in several right-wing and fascist political movements.Regarding this period in his life, he later said, “I have no excuse (for) such unbelievable stupidity… I don’t know how you expiate guilt.” In 1956, Johnson attempted to do just that and donated his design for a building of worship to what is now one of the country’s oldest Jewish congregations, Kneses Tifereth Israel in Port Chester, New York. According to one source “all critics agree that his design of the Port Chester Synagogue can be considered as his attempt to ask for forgiveness” for his admitted “stupidity” in being a Nazi sympathizer. The building, which stands today, is a “crisp juxtaposition of geometric forms”\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Johnson resigned his post at MoMA to try his hand at journalism and agrarian populist politics. His enthusiasm centered on the critique of the liberal welfare state, whose “failure” seemed to be much in evidence during the 1930s. As a correspondent, Johnson observed the Nuremberg Rallies in Germany and covered the invasion of Poland in 1939. The invasion proved the breaking point in Johnson’s interest in journalism or politics he returned to enlist in the US Army. After a couple of self-admittedly undistinguished years in uniform, Johnson returned to the Harvard Graduate School of Design to finally pursue his ultimate career of architect.\n\nThe Glass House\n\nJohnson’s early influence as a practicing architect was his use of glass. The Glass House (1949) that he designed as his own residence in New Canaan, Connecticut was a profoundly influential work, but “universally viewed as having been derived from” the Farnsworth House, according to Alice T. Friedman. Johnson curated an exhibit of Mies van der Rohe work at the Museum of Modern Art in 1947, featuring a model of the glass Farnsworth House.\n\nThe concept of a Glass House set in a landscape with views as its real “walls” had been developed by many authors in the German Glasarchitektur drawings of the 1920s, and already realized by Johnson’s mentor Mies. The building is an essay in minimal structure, geometry, proportion, and the effects of transparency and reflection.\n\nThe house sits at the edge of a crest on Johnson’s estate overlooking a pond. The building’s sides are glass and charcoal-painted steel; the floor, of brick, is not flush with the ground but sits 10 inches above. The interior is an open space divided by low walnut cabinets; a brick cylinder contains the bathroom and is the only object to reach floor to ceiling.\n\nJohnson continued to build structures on his estate as architectural essays. Offset obliquely fifty feet from the Glass House is a guest house, echoing the proportions of the Glass House and completely enclosed in brick (except for three large circular windows at the rear, set in wooden frames, 5 feet in diameter, which reveal the interior of the building that was originally designed with a window in each of three rooms, two guest bedrooms at each end and a study in the middle). It now contains a bathroom, library, and single bedroom with a vaulted ceiling and shag carpet. It was built at the same time as the Glass House and can be seen as its formal counterpart. Johnson stated that he deliberately designed it to be less than perfectly comfortable, as “guests are like fish, they should only last three days at most”.\n\nLater, Johnson added a painting gallery with an innovative viewing mechanism of rotating walls to hold paintings (influenced by the Hogarth displays at Sir John Soane’s house), followed by a sky-lit sculpture gallery. The last structures Johnson built on the estate were a library and a reception building, the latter, red and black in color and of curving walls. Johnson viewed the ensemble of one-room buildings as a total work of art, claiming that it was his best and only “landscape project.”\n\nThe Philip Johnson Glass House is a site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and now open to the public for tours.\n\nThe Seagram Building\n\nAfter completing several houses in the idiom of Mies and Breuer, Johnson joined Mies van der Rohe as the New York associate architect for the 39-story Seagram Building (1956). Johnson was pivotal in steering the commission towards Mies by working with Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the CEO of Seagram. The commission resulted in the iconic bronze-and-glass tower on Park Avenue. The structure was designed by Mies while the lobby and other internal aspects were designed by Johnson including the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants\n\nCompleting the Seagram Building with Mies also decisively marked a shift in Johnson’s career. After this accomplishment, Johnson’s practice grew as projects came in from the public realm, including coordinating the master plan of Lincoln Center and designing that complex’s New York State Theater. Meanwhile, Johnson began to grow bored with the orthodoxies of the International Style he had championed.\n\nLater buildings\n\nAlthough startling when constructed, the glass and steel tower (indeed many idioms of the modern movement) had by the 1960s become commonplace the world over. He eventually rejected much of the metallic appearance of earlier International Style buildings, and began designing spectacular, crystalline structures uniformly sheathed in glass. Many of these became instant icons, such as PPG Place in Pittsburgh and the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California.\n\nJohnson’s architectural work is a balancing act between two dominant trends in post-war American art: the more “serious” movement of Minimalism, and the more populist movement of Pop Art. His best work has aspects of both movements. Johnson’s personal art collection reflected this dichotomy, as he introduced artists such as Mark Rothko to the Museum of Modern Art as well as Andy Warhol. Straddling between these two camps, his work was seen by purists of either side as always too contaminated or influenced by the other. With his thick, round-framed glasses, Johnson was the most recognizable figure in American architecture for decades. As an art collector Johnson’s eclectic eye supported avant-garde movements and young artists often before they became widely known. His collection of American art was strong in Abstract expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Neo-Dada, Color Field, Lyrical Abstraction, and Neo-Expressionism and he often donated important works from his collection to institutions like MoMA, and other important private museums and University collections like the Norton Simon Museum, the Sheldon Museum of Art and the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University among many others.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1991 Johnson collaborated with John Burgee. This was by far Johnson’s most productive period — certainly by the measure of scale — he became known at this time as builder of iconic office towers, including Minneapolis’s IDS Tower opened 1972. That building’s distinctive stepbacks (called “zogs” by the architect) created an appearance that has since become one of Minneapolis’s trademarks and the crown jewel of its skyline. In 1980, the Crystal Cathedral was completed for Rev. Robert H. Schuller’s famed megachurch, which became a Southern California landmark.\n\nThe AT&T Building completed in 1984 in Manhattan, now the Sony Building, was immediately controversial for its neo-Georgian pediment (Chippendale top) characteristic for Postmodernism architecture and close – in concept – to the 1982 Humana Building by Michael Graves. At the time, it was seen as provocation on a grand scale: crowning a Manhattan skyscraper with a shape echoing a historical wardrobe top defied every precept of the modernist aesthetic: historical pattern had been effectively outlawed among architects for years. In retrospect other critics have seen the AT&T Building as a flagship of Postmodernism, necessary in the context of modernism’s aesthetic cul-de-sac. In 1987, Johnson was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Houston. The institution’s Hines College of Architecture is also housed in one of Johnson’s buildings.\n\nJohnson’s publicly held archive, including architectural drawings, project records, and other papers up until 1964 are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the Getty, and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nNotable works\n\n1943–1980\n\nJohnson House at Cambridge, “The Ash Street House”, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1942–1943)\n\nBooth (Damora) House, Bedford Village, New York (1946)\n\nJohnson House, “The Glass House”, New Canaan, Connecticut (1949)\n\nJohn de Menil House, Houston, Texas (1950)\n\nRockefeller Guest House for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, New York City (1950)\n\nSeagram Building, New York City, New York (in collaboration with Mies van der Rohe; 1956)\n\nReactor Building, Soreq, Israel (1956-1959)\n\nThe Four Seasons Restaurant, New York City, New York (1959)\n\nAcademic Mall at the University of Saint Thomas, Houston, Texas (1959)\n\nExpansion of Anselm’s Abbey, Washington, D.C.

Morris filmed at both sites over the course of several months, among other locations including The Four Seasons Restaurant, the Seagram Building, Mies van der Roheʼs controversial 860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments, and Chicagoʼs Newberry Library. Morris utilized The Four Seasons, a place that Philip Johnson practically used as his personal office, as the meeting point between the two architects. The restaurant remains a site of projection and desire – active as a site of negotiation and display. Morrisʼs film is both a record of preservation of two structures and a document of power plays that left a mark in the pragmatic idealism of the late modern period.\n\nTate Modern is a modern art gallery located in London. It is Britain’s national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the Tate group (together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, Tate St Ives and Tate Online). It is based in the former Bankside Power Station, in the Bankside area of the London Borough of Southwark. Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art.\n\nHistory\n\nThe galleries are housed in the former Bankside Power Station, which was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. The power station closed in 1981. In 1992 The Tate Gallery at the British National Art Museum proposed a competition to build a new building for modern art. The purpose for the new building would help with the ever-expanding collection on modern and contemporary art. In 1995 it was announced that Herzog & de Meuron had won the competition with their simple design. The architects decided to reinvent the current building instead of demolishing it. The Tate modern is an example of adaptive reuse, the process of finding new life in old buildings. The building itself still resembles the 20th century factory in style from the outside and that is reflected on the inside by the taupe walls, steel girders and concrete floors. The façade of the building is made out of 4.2 million bricks that are separated by groups of thin vertical windows that help create a dramatic light inside. The history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern. This challenging conversion work was carried by Carillion. The southern third of the building was retained by the French power company EDF Energy as an electrical substation (in 2006, the company released half of this holding).\n\nThe galleries\n\nThe collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today\n\nTate Modern currently has seven floors, originally numbered 1 to 7 they were then renumbered 0 to 6 in 2012. Levels 0 to 4 contain gallery space.\n\nCollection exhibitions\n\nThe main collection displays consist of 4 wings each taking up approximately half a complete floor of the main building. Each wing has a named theme or subject. Within each wing there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject of the wing.\n\nPrevious collection exhibitions\n\nWhen the gallery opened in 2000, the collections were not displayed in chronological order but were rather arranged thematically into four broad groups each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4):\n\n‘History/Memory/Society’\n\n‘Nude/Action/Body’\n\n‘Landscape/Matter/Environment’\n\n‘Still Life/Object/Real Life’\n\nThis was ostensibly because a chronological survey of the story of modern art along the lines of the Museum of Modern Art in New York would expose the large gaps in the collections, the result of the Tate’s conservative acquisitions policy for the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006. It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:\n\nMaterial Gestures (now closed)\n\nThis focuses on abstraction, expressionism and abstract expressionism, featuring work by Claude Monet, Anish Kapoor, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Henri Matisse and Tacita Dean.\n\nPoetry and Dream\n\nThis features a large central room dedicated to Surrealism while the surrounding rooms feature works by artists influenced by Surrealism and its methods.\n\nEnergy and Process\n\nThis focuses on Arte Povera, with work by artists such as Alighiero Boetti, Jannis Kounellis, Kasimir Malevich, Ana Mendieta, Mario Merz and Jenny Holzer.\n\nStates of Flux (now closed)\n\nThis focuses on Cubism, Futurism, Vorticism and Pop Art,containing work by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and the photographer Eugène Atget,\n\nCurrent collection exhibitions\n\nAs of mid-2012, a third rehang is in progress. The current arrangement is:\n\nPoetry and Dream\n\nAs above.\n\nStructure and Clarity\n\nFocussing on abstract art, replacing States of Flux\n\nTransformed Visions\n\nFocusing on Abstract Impressionism and related fields after the Second World War, replacing Material Gestures\n\nEnergy and Process\n\nAs above.\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nA smaller section, located between wings, covering installations with theatrical or fictional themes.\n\nIt has not been announced whether the current rehang will eventually replace all four of the sections introduced in the first rehang.\n\nTemporary exhibitions\n\nThe Turbine Hall\n\nThe Turbine Hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace. It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year. This series was planned to last the gallery’s first five years, but the popularity of the series has led to its extension until at least 2012.\n\nThe artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the turbine hall as part of the Unilever series are:\n\nDate Artist Work(s) May 2000 – November 2000 Louise Bourgeois I Do, I Undo, I Redo June 2001 – March 2002 Juan Muñoz Double Bind October 2002 – April 2003 Anish Kapoor Marsyas October 2003 – March 2004 Olafur Eliasson The Weather Project October 2004 – May 2005 Bruce Nauman Raw Materials October 2005 – May 2006 Rachel Whiteread EMBANKMENT October 2006 – April 2007 Carsten Höller Test Site October 2007 – April 2008 Doris Salcedo Shibboleth October 2008 – April 2009 Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster TH.2058 October 2009 – April 2010 Miroslaw Balka How It Is October 2010 – April 2011 Ai Weiwei Sunflower Seeds October 2011 – March 2012 Tacita Dean Film July 2012 – October 2012 Tino Sehgal These associations\n\nUntil 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, Unilever. Between 2000 and 2012, Unilever had provided £4.4m sponsorship in total including a renewal deal of £2.2m for a period of five years agreed in 2008.\n\nWhen the series is not running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. Most recently it has been used to display Damien Hirst’s For The Love Of God and a sell out show by Kraftwerk in February 2013 which famously crashed the ticket hotline and website causing a backlash from the band’s fans.\n\nIn 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around £5 million with Hyundai to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom. The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, Abraham Cruzvillegas.\n\nMajor temporary exhibitions\n\nTwo wings of the main building are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the Gilbert and George retrospective due to the size and number of the works. Currently the two wings used are on levels 2 and 3. It is not known if this arrangement is permanent. Each major exhibition has a dedicated mini-shop selling books and merchandise relevant to the exhibition. A 2014 show of Henri Matisse provided Tate Modern with London’s best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run.\n\nThe Tanks\n\nThe Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection.\n\nProject Space\n\nThe Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) is a smaller gallery located on the north side of the building on level 1 which houses exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically run for 2–3 months and then travel to the collaborating institution for display there.\n\nOther areas\n\nSmall exhibition spaces can be created between the wings on levels 2 to 4. These have been used to display recent acquisitions and other temporary displays from the collection. Works are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members’ room. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the building.\n\nOther facilities\n\nIn addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:\n\nA large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.\n\nThe Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.\n\nThe Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.\n\nOne large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.\n\nA cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members’ room.\n\nTate Modern community garden, co-managed with Bankside Open Spaces Trust\n\nExtension project\n\nTate Modern has attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it have been in preparation since 2004. These plans are focused on the south west of the building and will provide 5,000m2 of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.\n\nThis project was initially costed at £215 million Of the money raised, 50 million pounds is coming from the U.K. government; 7 million pounds from the London Development Agency; 6 million pounds from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch.\n\nAs of 2 June 2013, international shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer pledged £10m to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable “an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art”.The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a “truly twenty-first-century museum”.\n\nThe Tanks\n\nThe first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and are used to show live performance art and installations. Tate describes them as “the world’s first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art”.\n\nThe western block\n\nThe new western block will occupy the space no longer required by EDF Energy for their electrical substation. The original block has been demolished and a new building will be built with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 will have natural top lighting. A bridge will be built across the turbine hall on level 4 to complete the upper access route.\n\nThe tower\n\nAn eleven storey tower, 65 metres high, is being built above the oil tanks. The new building is scheduled to open in 2016.\n\nThe design, again by Herzog & de Meuron, has been controversial. It was originally designed as a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building) despite planning consent to the original design had been previously granted by the supervising authority.\n\nThe tower will provide 22,492 square metres of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.\n\nThe Chimney\n\nThe chimney is one of the most recognizable monuments on The South bank. It is directly across the river from Saint Paul’s Cathedral. The chimney stands at 325 ft, made completely out of brick except for The Swiss Light added on top by the architects Herzog and De Meuron.\n\nAccess and environs\n\nThe closest station is Blackfriars via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include Southwark, as well as St Paul’s and Mansion House north of the river which can be reached via the Millennium Bridge. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.\n\nThere is also a riverboat pier just outside the gallery called Bankside Pier, with connections to the Docklands and Greenwich via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.\n\nTo the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of Express Newspapers and Sampson House, a massive late Brutalist office building.\n\nSir Alfred James Munnings KCVO, PRA (8 October 1878 – 17 July 1959) was known as one of England’s finest painters of horses, and as an outspoken critic of Modernism. Engaged by Lord Beaverbrook’s Canadian War Memorials Fund, he earned several prestigious commissions after the Great War that made him wealthy.\n\nBiography\n\nAlfred Munnings was born 8 October 1878 at Mendham, Suffolk across the River Waveney from Harleston in Norfolk. His father ran a water-mill on the river at Mendham. At fourteen he was apprenticed to a Norwich printer, designing and drawing advertising posters for the next six years, attending the Norwich School of Art in his spare time. When his apprenticeship ended, he became a full-time painter. The loss of sight in his right eye in an accident in 1898 did not deflect his determination to paint, and in 1899 two of his pictures were shown at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. He painted rural scenes, frequently of subjects such as Gypsies and horses. He was associated with the Newlyn School of painters, and while there met Florence Carter Wood (1888–1914), a young horsewoman and painter. They married on 19 January 1912 but she tried to kill herself on their honeymoon and did so in 1914. Munnings remarried in 1920; his second wife was another horsewoman, Violet McBride. There were no children from either marriage. Although his second wife encouraged him to accept commissions from society figures, Munnings became best known for his equine painting: he often depicted horses involving in hunting and racing.\n\nWar artists\n\nAlthough he volunteered to join the Army, he was assessed as unfit to fight. In 1917, his participation in the war was limited to a civilian job outside Reading, processing tens of thousands of Canadian horses en route to France — and often to death. Later, he was assigned to one of the horse remount depots on the Western Front. Munnings’ talent was employed in his position as war artist to the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, under the patronage of Max Aitken in the latter part of the war. During the war he painted many scenes, including a mounted portrait of General Jack Seely Warrior in 1918 (now in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa). Munnings worked on this canvas a few thousand yards from the German front lines. When General Seely’s unit was forced into a hasty withdrawal, the artist discovered what it was like to come under shellfire.\n\nMunnings also painted Charge of Flowerdew’s Squadron in 1918. In what is known as “the last great cavalry charge” at the Battle of Moreuil Wood, Gordon Flowerdew was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for leading Lord Strathcona’s Horse (Royal Canadians) in a successful engagement with entrenched German forces.\n\nThe Canadian Forestry Corps invited Munnings to tour their work camps, and he produced drawings, watercolors and paintings, including Draft Horses, Lumber Mill in the Forest of Dreux in France in 1918. This role of horses was critical and under-reported; and in fact, horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries.\n\nThe Canadian War Records Exhibition at the Royal Academy after war’s end included forty-five of Munnings’ canvasses.\n\nLater career\n\nMunnings was elected president of the Royal Academy of Art in 1944. He was awarded a knighthood in 1944. His presidency is best known for the valedictory speech he gave in 1949, in which he attacked modernism. The broadcast was heard by millions of listeners to BBC radio. An evidently inebriated Munnings claimed that the work of Cézanne, Matisse and Picasso had corrupted art. He recalled that Winston Churchill had once said to him, “Alfred, if you met Picasso coming down the street would you join with me in kicking his … something something?” to which Munnings said he replied, “Yes Sir, I would”.\n\nHe died at Castle House, Dedham, Essex, on 17 July 1959. After his death, his wife turned their home in Dedham into a museum of his work. The village pub in Mendham is named after him, as is a street there.\n\nMunnings was portrayed by Dominic Cooper in the film Summer in February, which was released in Britain in 2013. The film is adapted from a novel by Jonathan Smith.\n\nAt auction\n\nHis immensely popular sporting art works have enjoyed popularity in the United States as well as the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Represented by agents Frost & Reed of London while he was alive, Munnings’s works were bought by some of the wealthiest collectors of the day. As of 2007, the highest price paid for a Munnings painting was $7,848,000 for The Red Prince Mare, far above his previous auction record of $4,292,500 set at Christie’s in December 1999. It was one of four works by Munnings in the auction. The Red Prince Mare is a 40-by-60-inch oil on canvas that was executed in 1921 and had an estimate of $4,000,000 to $6,000,000.\n\nWritings\n\nAn Artist’s Life (London 1950)\n\nThe Second Burst (London 1951)\n\nThe Finish (London 1952)\n\nClaudio Bravo (November 8, 1936 – June 4, 2011) was a Chilean hyperrealist painter. He was greatly influenced by Renaissance and Baroque artists, as well as Surrealist painters such as Salvador Dalí. He lived and worked in Tangier, Morocco, beginning in 1972. Bravo also lived in Chile, New York and Spain. He was known mainly for his paintings of still lifes, portraits and packages, but he had also done drawings, lithographs, engraving and figural bronze sculptures. Bravo painted many prominent figures in society, including dictator Franco of Spain, President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos of the Philippines and Malcolm Forbes.\n\nEarly Life and Education in Chile\n\nBravo was born in Valparaíso, Chile, to Tomás Bravo Santibáñez and Laura Camus Gómez. His father was a successful businessman who also owned a ranch, and his mother was a housewife. They had seven children: María Inés, Claudio Bravo, Patricia, Ana María, José Tomás, Hernán, and Ximena. One of his earliest childhood memories was being put on a horse at the age of three.\n\nIn 1945, he left the family ranch to join the Colegio San Ignacio (Santiago de Chile)|Colegio San Ignacio in Santiago, Chile, where he excelled in choir, literature and music. In order to raise his grades in math, physics or chemistry, he would give his teacher a portrait. The prefect, Father Dussuel, noticed his self-taught artistic ability and paid for him to study art in the studio of Miguel Venegas Cifuentes in Santiago. Eventually, Bravo’s father granted him permission to take the classes and took over the responsibility of paying for them. Bravo studied under Venegas from the age of 11 to 20 and it was the only formal art training he ever received.Bravo’s developing hyperrealist style was encouraged by Venegas who was known for being a strong supporter of the realist movement in Chile. Chile has a strong tie to European arts and did not experience a large modernist movement that other Latin American countries did.\n\nIn 1954, he had his first exhibition at “Salón 13” in Santiago at the age of 17. It consisted of mostly oil paintings with some red chalk drawings. The exhibit received good reviews and was considered a great success. All the works were sold, although they went to family and friends. He became very involved in the cultural scene of Santiago and was influenced by people such as Luis Oyarzun, a poet and philosopher. Bravo and Oyarzun hitchhiked together throughout Chile with Oyarzun acting as a teacher of philosophy, art, and life. Benjamín Subercaseaux was another friend who encouraged Bravo to expand his knowledge through reading. In 1955, he danced professionally with the Compañía de Ballet de Chile and worked for Teatro de Ensayo of the Universidad Católica de Chile and had his second exhibition at “Salón 13”.\n\nMadrid, Spain\n\nPortraiture\n\nAt 21, Bravo began doing portraits in Concepción, Chile, and quickly gained many commissions. He saved his earnings and bought a ticket aboard the Amerigo Vespucci to sail to Paris. The trip, however, was very stormy and Bravo got off at Barcelona and made his way to Madrid where he stayed. Bravo established himself in Madrid in the 1960s as a society portraitist, gaining recognition for his astounding ability to create verisimilitude. His ability to depict complex objects and shapes is reminiscent of Velázquez. There was even a dress designer, Balenciaga, whose dresses had a Renaissance quality to them. Bravo made women of nobility purchase one of Balenciaga’s works before he agreed to do their portrait. A year and two months after his arrival, he was already painting Francisco Franco’s daughter.\n\nHis interest in Renaissance and Baroque works came from his many visits to the Museo del Prado in Madrid where he admired paintings done by old Spanish and Italian masters. Specifically he was inspired by Diego Velázquez for his light effects, Francisco de Zurbarán’s cloth studies, Juan Sánchez Cotán’s still lifes, Juan van der Hamen who popularized still life painting in Madrid, and Luis de Meléndez who had great technical skill in using light to depict texture.\n\nIn 1968, Bravo received an invitation from President Marcos of the Philippines to come and paint him and his wife, Imelda Marcos, as well as members of the high society. He spent six months there doing portraits and traveling. Bravo found that the quality of light there was more intense than in Spain or Chile and it transformed how he painted while there. He held an exhibit at the Luz Gallery in Manila where he displayed over 50 works.\n\nPackage Paintings\n\nWith Spain under Franco’s rule, most art was constrained to his ultra right-wing policies. Bravo’s portraits appealed to the conservative public, but he became frustrated with the lack of intellectual values concerning art. His art shifted one day when he three visiting sisters brought home some packages and left them on the table. He was fascinated by their forms and the texture of the paper they were wrapped with. Bravo’s first exhibit in Spain, at the Galería Fortuny in 1963, had all types of paintings, including these new package ones.\n\nWhite and Yellow Package, painted in 2005, is a good example of Bravo’s continuation of the parcel series. One of the first things to catch the eye is his use of trompe l’oeil, a technique from the Baroque period meaning “to deceive the eye”, used to create the illusion of three-dimensionality. This painting style is similar to his approach to still lifes and helps to emphasize the tactile qualities of the paper. The way the package fills the frame elevates its status in a similar manner to what Pop art was doing in the 60s when he began. It also abstracts the package, almost breaking it into clean colour blocks, if it weren’t for the string keeping it contained. This abstraction is similar to Rothko’s paintings that employ fields of color and encourage almost a meditative state.\n\nWhile similar to modern movements, White and Yellow Package also mimics the old masters and their use of draping cloth. Bravo’s use of light is similar to that of Caravaggio, a Baroque painter who used a dramatic lighting style called tenebrism to highlight a climatic moment and to bring attention to the front plane by concealing the background in darkness. Many of Caravaggio’s works were spiritual and Bravo’s Catholic upbringing left him with interest in themes of ritual, mystery, spirituality, death, and the idea of saints. This connection is made obvious through the title of one of his pieces, Homage to St. Theresa, also oil on canvas painted in 1969. A subtle reference to commercialism lingers in the simple fact that it is a parcel, but the mystery of what the paper conceals seems to be more important. The package is teasing the viewer by slowly opening up and while the internal structure is hinted at, it will never be revealed. In this painting, the act of teasing also becomes sexual, reinforced by the colour scheme that resembles an egg – a symbol for rebirth and fertility.Overall, White and Yellow Package showcases his ability as a painter and is a mix of contemporary imagery done with traditional values.\n\nNew York\n\nIn 1969, Bravo met Melvin Blake and Frank Purnell who were in Spain collecting art – especially figure and surrealist pieces. They encouraged him to move to the United States and helped him get connected to the art scene. He moved into an apartment in the East Side of Manhattan. In 1970, Bravo had his first exhibition at the Staempfli Gallery in New York, receiving rave reviews from renowned New York Times art critic John Canaday. Years later, when Bravo’s work reflected the hippie movement, Canaday would refer to Bravo’s work as “cheap and vulgar”.\n\nMorocco\n\nBravo’s relationship with the New York art scene stayed strong, but he began to feel the gray cement and urban setting affecting his work. That, paired with the active social demands in both New York and Spain, caused him to start looking for a new place where he could dedicate more of his time to painting. Not wanting to cut himself off completely from his friends in Madrid, Bravo decided to spend some time in Morocco. The fact that was a completely different place in almost every aspect of life (religion, language, clothing, etc.) was intriguing to him. Bravo moved to Tangier in 1972, where he purchased a 19th-century three-story mansion. He had many of the walls removed, and the remaining walls were painted white to encourage the Mediterranean light so present in his paintings.\n\nHe hadn’t intended on staying in Morocco, but it was there that he found the colors and light he had been searching for. Bravo considered what he was able to paint “…symphonies of color.” Morocco quickly became the place that he considered to be home and with his gardens and view, Bravo rarely needed to leave his house. However, in an attempt to reconnect with the Moroccan world around him, he bought a second home in Marrakech that became his winter residence. Later, Bravo purchased a third home in Taroudant.Though Bravo’s style is hyper-realistic in nature, he rejected the assumption that he based his work on photographic imagery. Instead, Bravo had a daily ritual of painting that began with a walk in the garden and ended after he spent hours in his studio painting a present subject. He took his dedication to painting very seriously and tried to paint every day.\n\nStill lifes, packages and figurative paintings make up the majority of these works created in Morocco. While these all have connections to his previous work, they became infused with Moroccan culture. His use of Surrealism becomes more prominent as well, noticeable in his juxtaposition of objects, dreamlike compositions and ethereal backgrounds. Bravo became interested in the spiritual aspects of the Islamic culture that had a sense of religious intensity that matched his preoccupation with mystery and spirituality. Many view his works as being a hybrid of multiple religions and styles – traditional techniques with contemporary sensibilities, Biblical saints displaced in a Moroccan world, and exotic objects next to common Western imagery. This is supported by the fact that despite his interest in his surroundings, Bravo rejected the label of Orientalist because he did not consider himself to be a part of any particular culture but rather a man interested in many. Though he was fascinated by the Arab world around him, his use of exotic objects and imagery was not done as an attempt to merge his work with the culture.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nThe artist died at his home in Taroudant, Morocco, on June 4, 2011, due to an epilepsy attack.\n\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art, El Museo del Barrio (New York City), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Santiago, Chile), Museo Rufino Tamayo (Mexico City), Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (Rotterdam, The Netherlands), the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), Museum Ludwig (Cologne, Germany), the Palmer Museum of Art (Pennsylvania State University), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art are among the public collections holding works by Claudio Bravo.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBravo was celibate for the last 2 decades of his life, in an interview for El Mercurio he stated, “That (romantic love) was very complicated for me…I’m too passionate and jealous. I decided that my paintings and my animals were my best sources of love. I don’t think I’ve had anyone in my bed since I was 50. I got tired of it.”\n\nBravo was assisted by Bashir Tabchich who was first hired as chauffeur but later relocated to Bravo’s residence with his wife and children and worked as Bravo’s assistant since 1979. Tabchich currently permits tours at Bravo’s Taroudant Palace, “Agwidr Claudio Bravo Camus.”\n\nExhibitions\n\nSolo Exhibitions\n\n1954 – Salón 13, Santiango, Chile\n\n1955 – Salón 13, Santiago, Chile\n\n1961 – Universidad de Concepción Chile\n\n1963 – Galería Fortuny, Madrid, Spain\n\n1965 – Galería Edurne, Madrid Spain (through 1966)\n\n1967 – Galería Fortuny, Madrid Spain\n\n1968 – Luz Gallery, Manila, Philippines\n\n1970 – Staempfli Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1971 – Galería Egam, Madrid, Spain\n\n1972 – Staempfli Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1974 – Galería Vandrés, Madrid, Spain\n\nStaempfli Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1976 – Galerie Claude Berndard, Paris, France\n\n1978 – Staempfli Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1980 – FIAC (Foire Internationale d’Art Contemporain), Grand Palais, Paris, France\n\n1981 – Galerie Levy, Hamburg, Germany\n\nMarlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1982 – Museo de Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico\n\n1983 – ARCO, Madrid, Spain\n\nMarlborough Fine Arts, London, Great Britain\n\n1984 – Galería Quintana, Bogota, Colombia\n\nMarlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1985 – Marlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1987 – Marlborough Fine Art, Tokyo, Japan (through 1988)\n\nElvehjem Museum of Art University of Wisconsin, Madison;\n\nthen to Meadows Museum, Southern Methodist University, Dallas Texas,\n\nthen Duke University Museum of Art, Durham, North Carolina\n\n1989 – Marlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1991 – Marlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1992 – FIAC Grand Palais Paris, France\n\n1993 – Carlsten Art Gallery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin\n\nMuseo del Grabado Español Contemporaneo, Granada, Spain (through 1994)\n\n1994 – Museo Nacional de Bellas Arte, Santiago Chile\n\n1995 – Galeía Marlborough, Madrid, Spain\n\n1997 – Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach, Florida\n\n1998 – Marlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n1999 – Marlborough Gallery, Madrid, Spain\n\n2000 – Marlborough Gallery, Boca Raton, Florida\n\nMarlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\n2001 – Marlborough Monaco, Monaco\n\n2003 – Marlborough Gallery, New York, New York\n\nGroup Exhibitions\n\n1971 – Art of Dream, La Jolla Museum of Art, La Jolla, California\n\n1972 – Documenta 5, Kassel, Germany\n\nHumor, Satire and Irony, Art Center, The New School for Social Research, New York, New York\n\nSharp Focus Realism, Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, New York\n\nLa Paloma, Galería Vandrés, Madrid, Spain\n\n1973 – Artes hyper-realistes, Galerie des Quatre Mouvements, Paris, France\n\nHyper-realisme: maîtres américains et européens, Galerie Isy Brachot, Brussels, Belgium\n\nContemporary Sapnish Realits, Marlborough Fine Art London, Great Britain\n\nRéalisme Relativiste, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium\n\nTropic of Cancer – Tropic of Capricon: Contemporary Latin American Art, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts\n\nSuper Realist Vision, De Cordoba Museum, Lincoln, Massachusetts\n\nJovenes en torno a la figuración, Torre del Merino IV Exposicíon de Arte Actual, Santillana del Mar, Madrid, Spain\n\n1974 – Ars 1974: Alternatives of Realism, The Fine Arts Academy of Finland, Helsinki, Finland\n\nDrawings, Nancy Hoffman Gallery, New York, New York\n\nKijken naar de werkelijkheid Amerikaanse Hyperrealisten-Europese realisten, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\n\n1976 – Modern Portraits – The Self and Others, Wildenstein & Co., New York, New York\n\nAspects of Realism, traveled through 30 Canadian museums til 1978\n\n1977 – Illusion and Reality, traveled through Australian museums til 1978\n\n1979 – Figurative/Realist Art, Marlborough Gallery (a concurrent exhibition with Brooke Alexander Gallery, Terry Dintenfass, Fisbach, Alan\n\nFrumkin, and Kornblee Galleries, New York, New York)\n\n1980 – Realism and Latin American Painting: The Seventies, Center for Inter-American Relations, New York, and Museo de\n\nMonterrey, Monterrey, Mexico\n\nLatin American Paintings, Latin American Gallery of the Metropolitan Museum and Art Center, Miami, Florida\n\nPrinted Art: A View of Two Decades, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York\n\n1981 – International Contemporary Art, Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City, Mexico\n\n1982 – Drawings, Nahora Haime Gallery, New York, New York\n\nImportant Paintings by European Figurative Artists, F.I.A.C., Grand Palais, Paris, France;

He grew up and was educated in Argentina. He attended the University of Buenos Aires, receiving a Diploma in Architecture in 1968 and a Master of Architecture from the School of Architecture and Urbanism in 1969.\n\nIn 1964, he formed the “Manteola-Petchersky-Sanchez Gomez-Santos-Solsona-Viñoly” Estudio de Arquitectura (architectural firm) with six associates. This practice would eventually become one of the largest architectural practices in South America, completing many significant commissions in a very short time.\n\nIn 1978 Viñoly and his family relocated to the United States. For a brief period he served as a guest lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, settling permanently in New York City in 1979. He founded the firm Rafael Viñoly Architects PC in 1983. His first major project in New York was the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which was completed in 1988. In 1989, he won an international competition to design the Tokyo International Forum. Completed in 1996, many people consider this building to be the most important cultural complex in Japan. His firm’s design was one of the finalists in the World Trade Center design competition (see THINK Team).\n\nDuring the course of his forty-plus year career, Viñoly has practiced in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nViñoly is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and a member of the Japan Institute of Architects as well as the Sociedad Central de Arquitectos.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nDesign Honour, Salvadori Center, 2007\n\nInternational Fellow, The Royal Institute of British Architects, 2006\n\nNational Design Award Finalist, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2004\n\nNeutra Medal for Professional Excellence: In recognition for his contributions to the Environmental Design Profession and in honor of Modernist architect Richard Neutra, 2000.\n\nHonourary Doctorate, University of Maryland, 1997\n\nMedal of Honour, American Institute of Architects, New York City Chapter, 1995\n\nNational Academician, The National Academy, 1994\n\nFellow, American Institute of Architects, 1993\n\nDesign philosophy\n\n“Architecture is a dialogue with the forces of life. As a major form of social intervention, its essential responsibility is to elevate the public realm.” In every project, I seek to maximize the opportunity for civic investment with a goal of forming iconic works that fulfill the needs of the client. For me, this makes architecture the most unique form of artistic endeavor.\n\nMy design philosophy is rooted in the development of architectural ideas that are powerful, distinctive, and relevant to the specifics of both program and context. This assures that each project receives a unique interpretation rather than a premeditated solution based on a specific architectural vocabulary. I also focus on the integration of structural systems that complement the design idea, ensuring the synthesis of engineering with architectural form.\n\nMy longstanding commitment to design excellence, practiced over 45 years, is particularly evident in the success of our firm’s many civic initiatives, which demonstrate our ability to creatively integrate buildings into contextual urban sites and to work within larger master plans. However, our global work spans nearly every architectural typology, each one delivered with equal passion and commitment to purpose.\n\nBuildings\n\nCompleted\n\nLehman College Physical Education Facility, Bronx, New York, 1994\n\nTokyo International Forum, Tokyo, Japan, 1996\n\nBronx Housing Court, Bronx, New York, 1997\n\nPrinceton University Stadium, Princeton, New Jersey, 1998\n\nJongno Tower in Seoul, South Korea, 1999\n\nColumbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Palisades, New York, 2000\n\nThe Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 2001\n\nVan Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2002\n\nBrown University, Watson Institute for International Studies, Providence, Rhode Island, 2002\n\nPennsylvania State University, Information Sciences and Technology Building, State College, Pennsylvania, 2003\n\nDavid L.

In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara’s south-facing tower could make swimmers in the hotel pool uncomfortably warm, as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the “Vdara death ray”. During an unusually warm 2013 summer in London, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts on a parked car as well as scorching the carpet of a nearby barber shop.\n\nThe New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a designated national landmark botanical garden located in the Bronx, New York City. It spans some 250 acres (100 ha) of Bronx Park and is home to the Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory. The facility offers exhibitions and flower shows throughout the year and is visited by over 900,000 visitors annually.\n\nMission statement\n\nThe New York Botanical Garden is an advocate for the plant kingdom. The Garden pursues its mission through its role as a museum of living plant collections arranged in gardens and landscapes across its National Historic Landmark site; through its comprehensive education programs in horticulture and plant science; and through the wide-ranging research programs of the International Plant Science Center.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lorillard family owned most of the land that later became the New York Botanical Garden. That land and adjacent acreage was acquired by the City of New York and set aside for the creation of a zoo and botanical garden. The Garden was established on 28 April 1891 on part of the grounds of the Lorillard Estate (formerly owned by the tobacco magnate Pierre Lorillard) and a parcel that was formerly the easternmost portion of the campus of St. John’s College (now Fordham University). The Garden’s creation followed a fund-raising campaign led by the Torrey Botanical Club and Columbia University botanist Nathaniel Lord Britton and his wife Elizabeth Gertrude Britton who were inspired to emulate the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1967.\n\nGrounds\n\nThe Garden contains 50 different gardens and plant collections. Sightseers can easily spend a day admiring the serene cascade waterfall, wetlands and a 50-acre (20 ha) tract of original, old-growth New York forest, never logged, containing oaks, American beeches, cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees—some more than two centuries old.\n\nGarden highlights include an 1890s-vintage, wrought-iron framed, “crystal-palace style” greenhouse by Lord & Burnham, now Haupt Conservatory; the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden (originally laid out by Beatrix Jones Farrand in 1916); a rock garden; a 37-acre (15 ha) conifer collection; extensive research facilities including a propagation center, 550,000-volume library, and an herbarium of over seven million botanical specimens dating back more than three centuries.\n\nAt the heart of the Garden are 50 acres (20 ha) of old-growth forest, the largest existing remnant of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest itself is split by the Bronx River, the only fresh water river in New York City, and this stretch of the river includes a riverine canyon and rapids. Along the shores sits the landmark Stone Mill, previously known as the Lorillard Snuff Mill built in 1840. Sculptor Charles Tefft created the Fountain of Life on the grounds in 1905. “It was conceived in the spirit of Italian baroque fountains, with the surging movement of galloping horses and muscular riders.”\n\nResearch laboratories\n\nThe Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory, built with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New York State and New York City, and named for its largest private donor, is a major new research institution at the Garden that opened in 2006. The laboratory is a pure research institution, with projects more diverse than research in universities and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe laboratory’s research emphasis is on plant genomics, the study of how genes function in plant development. One question scientists hope to answer is Darwin’s “abominable mystery”; when, where, and why flowering plants emerged. The laboratory’s research also furthers the discipline of molecular systematics, the study of DNA as evidence that can reveal the evolutionary history and relationships of plant species. Staff scientists also study plant use in immigrant communities in New York City and the genetic mechanisms by which neurotoxins are produced in some plants, work that may be related to nerve disease in humans.\n\nA staff of 200 trains 42 doctoral students at a time, from all over the world. Since the 1890s, scientists from The New York Botanical Garden have mounted about 2,000 exploratory missions worldwide to collect plants in the wild.\n\nAt the Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory, genomic DNA from many different species of plants is extracted to create a library of the DNA of the world’s plants. This collection is stored in a 768-square-foot (71.3 m2) DNA storage room with 20 freezers housing millions of specimens, including rare, endangered or extinct species. To protect the collection during winter power outages, there is a backup 300-kilowatt electric generator.\n\nThe Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has granted the NYBG $572,000 to begin a project called TreeBOL, the Tree Barcode of Life. By sampling the DNA from all 100,000 different species of trees from around the world over the next few years, TreeBOL will document the diversity of plant life, and advance the process of plant DNA barcoding.\n\nLuEsther T. Mertz Library\n\nWhen, in 1881, land was set aside by the New York State Legislature for the creation of “a public botanic garden of the highest class” for the City of New York, the Library and Conservatory were the first two structures built on the grounds. Prominent civic leaders and financiers, including Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and J. P. Morgan, agreed to match the City’s commitment to finance the buildings and improvements.\n\nFounded in 1899, the LuEsther T. Mertz Library is considered to be the largest, most comprehensive botanical library in the Americas. In addition to botany, horticulture, the Library’s collections are used for studies in fields as diverse as history, anthropology, landscape and building design, architectural history, ethnobotany, economic botany, urban social history, and environmental policy. In addition to current scholarly books and serials, the Mertz Library holds many rare, and historically important works ranging from medieval herbals, to 17th-century depictions of the princely gardens of Europe, to accounts of botanical exploration and discovery in the 18th century, to the writings of Carl von Linné (Linnaeus) and Charles Darwin.\n\nThe Library has been led by a series of accomplished individuals during its over 100 year history. Their names and dates of service are as follows:\n\nT. MacDougal (acting librarian, 1899)\n\nAnna Murray Vail (January 1900 – September 1907)\n\nJohn Hendley Barnhart (October 1907 – December 1912)\n\nSarah Harlow (January 1913 – October 1937)\n\nElizabeth C. Hall (November 1937 – 1960)\n\nJames J. Daly, Administrative Librarian (1960–1961)\n\nRobert Jones, Administrative Librarian, 1962\n\nMulford Martin, Acting Senior Curator of the Library (1964–1965)\n\nJohn F. Reed, Curator of the Library (1965–1971)\n\nCharles R. Long, Administrative Librarian (1972–1986)\n\nJohn F. Reed, VP for Education and Director of the Library (November 1992 – June 2003)\n\nSusan Fraser, Director of the Library (2004 – present)\n\nThe collection grew both through purchase of books and through the generous donation of significant botanical and horticultural libraries from notable botanists, gardeners, scientists and book collectors Among the important personal collections to be given to the LuEsther T. Mertz Library are donations from\n\nEleanor Cross Marquand\n\nSarah Gildersleeve Fife\n\nLucien Marcus Underwood\n\nRobert Hiester Montgomery\n\nEmil Starkenstein\n\nJohn Torrey\n\nHarriet Barnes Pratt\n\nDavid Hosack\n\nEnid A. Haupt Conservatory\n\nThe Enid A. Haupt Conservatory is a greenhouse located toward the western end of the NYBG. Inspiration for the park and the conservatory stemmed from Nathaniel Lord Britton and his wife Elizabeth. The couple had visited the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew on their honeymoon and thought a similar park and conservatory should be built for New York City. The conservatory was designed by the major greenhouse company of the late 1890s, Lord and Burnham Co. The design was modeled after the Palm House at the Royal Botanic Garden and Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace in Italian Renaissance style. Groundbreaking took place on January 3, 1899 and construction was completed in 1902 at a cost of $177,000. The building was constructed by John R. Sheehan under contract for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Since the original construction, major renovations took place in 1935, 1950, 1978, and 1993."
