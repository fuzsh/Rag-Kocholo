        "text": "It's been a busy time for Nancy Borlase, with all this living and learning. The artist, who turned 90 last month, is preparing an exhibition for the Ray Hughes gallery and becomes an honorary doctor of fine arts at Newcastle University on Monday.\n\nShe will tell the gathering in Newcastle how she arrived in Sydney from New Zealand in 1937 with two pounds in her pocket, but \"with the arrogance of youth\".\n\nHer first job was at a cafe on William Street, where she lived upstairs and found prostitutes using adjoining rooms. Later she worked at the Top Hatters cabaret in Kings Cross, not realising prostitutes worked there too. \"All was calm until I was caught reading Havelock Ellis's Psychology of Sex,\" Borlase says. \"It was a matter of live and learn.\"\n\nThe artist as an old woman reckons she is still learning. A retrospective of her work toured NSW galleries 10 years ago but Borlase thought it premature. The exhibition at the Hughes gallery will be of new work.\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Borlase survived the 1931 earthquake in Napier that destroyed her house. Deciding at 16 that art was her life's calling, she adopted the name Madame Rosa and read tea leaves to help support herself before coming to Australia at 22.\n\nShe studied sculpture under Lyndon Dadswell at East Sydney Technical College before switching to painting. \"I was on my way! It was a precarious existence, but I survived.\"\n\nShe lived for a while next to Sidney Nolan in Melbourne, befriended by his benefactor John Reed, and worked as an artist's model, leading a models' strike for better pay and conditions.\n\nShe married Laurie Short in 1941. Short, then a Trotskyist, won fame as a trades union leader by wresting control of the Federated Ironworkers Association from the communists in 1951.\n\nTheir marriage has placed them close to the centre of political and cultural change for 63 years. \"I'm the painter's labourer now,\" he quips in the third-floor Mosman flat they have shared for 40 years.\n\nBorlase started as a figurative painter before moving to abstract impressionism. Her work was influenced by a visit to New York in 1956, where she encountered Jackson Pollock, William de Kooning and Mark Rothko.\n\nShe became active in the then radical Contemporary Art Society and was the Herald art critic for six years from 1975, apart from when Madam Mao invited her to China on a cultural visit. \"Madam Mao was arrested while we were in Shanghai and the people rejoiced.\"\n\nBorlase now concentrates on portraits, although she says: \"I don't call them portraits. I'm painting people.\"\n\nOne painting for the Hughes exhibition is of herself with her husband, which she calls \"After Gainsborough\" - English artist Thomas Gainsborough painted himself with his wife, Margaret."
