        "text": "The following is a transcript of notes that Michael Canney made for a talk in 1983 (adapted, where possible, for readability), focusing on the transition from âtraditionalâ art to âmodernâ.\n\nAlthough much of it takes the form of lists, it is given here in the hope that it might be a useful snapshot for anyone researching art in West Penwith, particularly St Ives, during the mid-20th century.\n\nTourism latterly priced artists out of St Ives, with the result that they moved to surrounding areas and Newlyn.\n\nThe old St Ives Society at the Porthmeor Gallery had the air of a French atelier. The Marinerâs Chapel was Church of England, but the fishermen were mostly Methodists, so had little use for it. As a result, it was available for use as a gallery. Borlase Smart and Lamorna Birch were sympathetic to the âmodernsâ, and a corner in the gallery was given over to them, Hepworth and Nicholson. Hotels and cafÃ©s in St Ives used to be full of paintings. There was a large mural in the teashop in the main street (still there?). When the moderns came in, old artists thought St Ives was finished as a colony. The moderns supported Alfred Wallis and this was thought to be a pose on their part and an indication of their wrong thinking. The general opinion of the old guard was that CÃ©zanne (who was God to the moderns) could not draw and had defective eyesight.\n\nEarly artists studied in ateliers, and brought this camaraderie and friendly spirit of the atelier to St Ives and Newlyn. The moderns were more individualistic and tended to keep themselves to themselves much more. The open studio was not so common. Old artists did not look much beyond the Royal Societies and the Royal Academy. Moderns looked to the international scene.\n\nShow days, on March 6th annually, were an open house which revealed the mystery of the artistâs studio to the public. The modernsâ mystery lay in their art. At old St Ives Arts Club, the social gatherings were very different from the more self-conscious and intense meetings of a later generation.\n\nA vital change from the old days to later was from a publicly demonstrated art â artist with easel and paints in the streets or on the coast â to the abstract artist in his studio, a private preoccupation. As a result, there was less rapport with the locals, and less appreciation and respect for the work done and for those who did it. This did not mean that the moderns did not have a good relationship with some of the locals, but the general appreciation had to be less. Castle Inn was favoured, as opposed to the old bohemian Sloop: at the Sloop, paintings on the walls were supposed to have been given to settle debts, or were caricatures of locals. Castle Inn pictures, by contrast, were exhibition pictures â polemical in nature.\n\nOriginal art had been sunny, nostalgic, picturesque, of idealised days on the beach, views, old fishermen, stormy seas, basically holiday art, holiday souvenirs, escapist,Â of the sub-Impressionist Manet-cum-Barbizon School. It was atmospheric painting, essentially â a particular time of day in particular weather. The modern works, on the other hand, used local colour, and were concerned with the construction of the picture, structure in nature and in art, the essential West Penwith. They were, curiously enough, more like the place as it really was.\n\nCharles Simpson [a noted painter of animals and birds] had a school of painting in St Ives, 1921-25.\n\nBorlase Smartâs book on Marine Painting was very well received. Smart painted seas, Lamorna Birch, running water!\n\n[John Singer] Sargent was a strong influence in local water-colours.\n\nAnnie WalkeÂ (wife of clergyman Bernard Walke) painted at St Hilary. She exhibited always at St Ives.\n\nMarlow Moss left Cornwall in 1926 to work on the Continent; she returned to Lamorna in 1941 and died in Penzance in 1958. She did not exhibit locally.\n\nCornish-born artists\n\nJohn Barnicoat\n\nMichael Canney\n\nPeter Ellery\n\nDick Gilbert\n\nJeremy Le Grice\n\nGert Harvey\n\nHarold Harvey\n\nMarion Grace Hocken\n\nMary Jewels\n\nLamorna Kerr\n\nDenis Lane.\n\nAndrew Lanyon\n\nPeter Lanyon\n\nMargo Maeckelberghe\n\nJoan Manning-Saunders\n\nBill Marshall\n\nScott Marshall\n\nBrian Pearce\n\nJack Pender\n\nTerry Pope\n\nMichael Praed\n\nRobin Welch\n\nJohn Wells\n\nChild prodigy\n\nJoan Manning-Saunders, exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1930s.\n\nArt schools\n\nFalmouth\n\nPenzance\n\nRedruth (with evening classes at Camborne School of Mines)\n\nTruro\n\nPrivate schools\n\nCharles Breaker and Eric Hillerâs Sketching Group.\n\nGulval-Trevaylor Summer School\n\nLeonard Fullerâs St Ives School of Painting\n\nPorthleven Summer School\n\nSt Peterâs Loft, St Ives\n\nStanhope and Maude Forbesâ Newlyn School\n\nPrincipal\n\nAt Redruth and Camborne â Arthur C Hambly, RWA, trained at West of England College of Art, Bristol.\n\nStudents\n\nAt local schools included:\n\nSven Berlin\n\nMichael Canney\n\nPeter Ellery\n\nTerry Frost\n\nJeremy Le Grice (at St Peterâs Loft)\n\nMarion Hocken\n\nPeter Lanyon\n\nTerry Pope\n\nMichael Praed\n\nRobin Welch\n\nNancy Wynne-Jones (at St Peterâs Loft)\n\nTeachers\n\nBernard Leach and John Tunnard both taught at Penzance Art School, Denis Mitchell at Redruth and Pool Technical College.\n\nGalleries\n\nCheviock Gallery, North Cornwall\n\nFore Street Gallery, St Ives\n\nOrion Gallery, Penzance\n\nPassmore Edwards Art Gallery, Newlyn\n\nPenwith Gallery\n\nPolytechnic Gallery, Falmouth\n\nPorthleven Gallery\n\nRoyal Institution of Cornwall Gallery, Truro\n\nSail Loft Gallery (Elena Gaputyte)\n\nSt Ives Society of Artists\n\nArtists\n\n(signifies small or large collections of artists)\n\nFalmouth\n\nNewlyn\n\nLamorna\n\nLizard peninsula.\n\nLooe\n\nMevagissey\n\nMousehole\n\nPaul\n\nPolperro\n\nPorthleven\n\nSennen\n\nSt Agnes\n\nSt Ives\n\nOutsiders\n\nRobert Adams/St Ives\n\nFrancis Bacon/St Ives\n\nSandra Blow/Zennor\n\nMerlyn Evans/St Ives\n\nCharles Ginner/Porthleven.\n\nAdrian Heath/Newlyn/St Ives\n\nFrances Hodgkins/Newlyn and elsewhere\n\nKokoschka/Polperro\n\nPeter Potworowski/Sancreed\n\nWilliam Scott/Sennen/Mousehole/Sancreed\n\nJack Smith/Sancreed\n\nMatthew Smith/St Columb\n\nChristopher Wood/St Ives/Mousehole/Hayle/CharlestownÂ\n\nArtists showing at Newlyn\n\n(Many of the following could be seen regularly at Newlyn 1956-64.

The last named introduced a number of modern artists for the first time. Michael Canney extended this policy, refurbished the gallery, opened up the lower gallery and installed a spiral staircase to it from the main gallery, and started a successful film society, Christmas exhibitions of low-priced works (Â£10 and under) and obtained an Arts Council grant for the Society in 1956. The gallery was visited regularly by the Directors of Art of the Arts Council, Philip James and Gabriel White, and by the Regional Officers of the Arts Council, including Alan Bowness. Mark Rothko visited the gallery.\n\nNewlyn\n\nCompared to St Ives, Newlyn represented a quiet scene, less frenetic or active. During the period 1956-65, artists in Newlyn were:\n\nGiles Auty\n\nSydney Josephine Bland\n\nCharles Breaker\n\nEdna Bridge\n\nMichael Canney\n\nJune Feiler\n\nPaul Feiler\n\nDerek Guthrie\n\nGert Harvey\n\nEric Hiller\n\nRoger Hilton\n\nBouverie Hoyton,\n\nInez Hoyton\n\nMary Jewels\n\nAlexander Mackenzie\n\nMarjorie Mort\n\nDod Procter, RA\n\nHassel Smith\n\nBarbara Tribe\n\nGillian Watkiss\n\nReg Watkiss\n\nJohn Wells\n\nEarlier Newlyn artists had included:\n\nFrank Dobson (pupil at Stanhope Forbesâs school)\n\nHarold Harvey\n\nFrances Hodgkins (pupil at Stanhope Forbesâs school)\n\nHarold Knight\n\nLaura Knight (she had a studio, subsequently bought by John Tunnard, at Lamorna)\n\nAlgernon Newton (father of film actor Robert Newton)\n\nCedric Morris\n\nLamorna Birch resided at Lamorna. All of these artists were preceded by the early Newlyn School of Forbes, Bramley, etc, although Birch could be said to represent a link between old and new artists.\n\nThe latest influx of artists to Newlyn has included Terry Frost, Denis Mitchell, Michael Broido, and Breon OâCasey at Paul.\n\nArtists at Paul included Midge Bruford, Ithell Colquhoun (still there), and I think Mary Duncan, Paul Feiler at Kerris, and June Feiler.\n\nArtists at Mousehole\n\nJoan Gilchrist\n\nGeorge Lambour (who had a school and a gallery)\n\nJack Pender\n\nAlbert Reuss (who had a gallery too)\n\nAdrian Ryan\n\nWilliam Scott (in the 1950s)\n\n-- Seeley\n\nHassel Smith\n\nArnesby Brown painted around Camborne.\n\nAt St Ives, immediately pre-warÂ and after:\n\nShearer Armstrong\n\nGarlick Barnes\n\nBarry\n\nDorothy Bayley\n\nFred Bottomley\n\nC.
