Particularly helpful have been Paul Tucker’s insights, transcription of Stokes’s not always easy to read handwriting, and Paul’s pursuit and encouraging my pursuit of details I might otherwise have overlooked and ignored. I am also very grateful to Ann Stokes, to Stokes’s sons, Philip and Telfer, and to Ann’s husband, Ian Angus, for all their unstinting help and hospitality to me over the many years I have spent writing this book, during which time my husband, Sean Sayers, has kindly read and commented on several of its many versions. My thanks also to the following who have read and discussed with me parts or all of the book, namely, Helen Douglas, Steph Ebdon, Mary Evans, Thomas Evans, Jill Halpin, Judith Hattaway, Lyn Innes, Stephen Kite, Stephen Laird, John Rodden, Telfer Stokes, Shirley Toulson, and Clare Ungerson. I first got to know about art and psychoanalysis at school in Devon at Dartington (where Stokes often spent time in the 1930s). This has resulted in further help with this book from people connected with Dartington, specifically Martin Bernal, Anne Buchanan Crosby, Alasdhair Campbell, Judith Conway, Anwyl Cooper-Willis, Elaine xvii\n\nxviii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nFitch, Helga Forrester, Stephen Forrester, Michael Foss, Rachel Kidd, Annette Morreau, Liz Piper, and Leina Shiffrin.

Through bringing his close friends—Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson and, with them, Naum Gabo—to St Ives in Cornwall in 1939 he also became the main catalyst of the town’s transformation into an internationallyacclaimed centre of modern art. Less well known is Stokes’s innovative use of the visual arts together with his experience of many years of psychoanalytic treatment by Melanie Klein as means of innovatively highlighting ways the outer world of the senses gives form to the inner world of fantasy and imagination. Nor are many aware of the moving story of his falling in love again in his mid-forties and the way this contributed to his pioneering psychoanalytic understanding of our experience of art, of everyday objects, and of our surroundings more generally. How did all this come about? What were its turbulent precursors during Stokes’s early love affairs while becoming a protégé of the\n\nxxv\n\nxxvi\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nwriter, Osbert Sitwell, and then of the poet, Ezra Pound? Why, after this, did Stokes become a psychoanalytic patient of Melanie Klein in his late twenties? What did her treatment of Stokes reveal about his psychology? And how did he use this in writing about art? In answering these questions I will begin with his early years before, during, and immediately following the First World War.\n\nPART I CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nEarly years\n\n“\n\nG\n\noing down the hill one morning towards Lancaster Gate, my eldest brother remarked on an orange cloud in a dark sky: a thundercloud, he said. And sure enough, that afternoon there was a thunderstorm,” recalled Adrian Stokes at the time of doodlebug raids on England in the Second World War. “At nearby Stanhope Gate, an old lady sold coloured balloons. It was as if the whole lot had burst,” he continued in recalling himself aged six and his eldest brother, Philip, before the First World War.1 Philip, it seems, had been named after his and Adrian’s stockbroker grandfather, Philip Leon, who had died when his daughter, Philip’s and Adrian’s mother, Ethel, was six. Through her mother she was related to the once famous financier, banker, philanthropist, and Sheriff of London, Sir Moses Montefiore. Adrian was “pleased about the Montefiore” connection “but not about being Jewish”.2 Perhaps he was more pleased that his father, Durham, came from a non-Jewish Irish family. Born just over a year before Ethel on 8 April 1871, Durham also lost his father early, not through his father dying but through his father deserting Durham, his older sister, and their mother. It was this, apparently, which caused Durham to leave school, St Paul’s in Hammersmith, where he had 3\n\n4\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nproved an able mathematician, at the age of sixteen, and obtain paid work in a solicitor’s office where, he bragged, he received a pay rise through getting a firm across the road to offer him a higher salary. By the time he married Ethel on 15 August 1896 Durham was working (like his father, Edwin) as a stockbroker in the City. His and Ethel’s first child, Philip, was born on 15 August 1897. The same year Durham was sufficiently wealthy to buy a grand terrace house, 18 Radnor Place, which, with its classical brick and stucco façade, was similar to handsome-looking houses in nearby Sussex Gardens.3\n\nEthel Stokes, 1898 It was at 18 Radnor Place that Adrian’s brother, Geoffrey, was born on 19 April 1900, and that Adrian himself was born on 27 October 1902. Ethel was disappointed that he was yet another boy. She had wanted a daughter. She was nevertheless very fond of Adrian and even more fond, it seems, of herself; she had been a great beauty in her youth, and was remembered by Adrian as vain, “frigid”, and obsessed with “order and cleanliness”.4 He also recalled her dislike of Durham. Not without reason. Durham was evidently a tyrant at home. This included his saving money, despite being a remarkably successful stockbroker, by starving\n\nE A R LY Y E A R S\n\n5\n\nEthel of adequate heat and light, and by forbidding her to make outgoing telephone calls. He was also ridiculously penny-pinching with himself. Examples included his only allowing himself “a three penny cigar after breakfast, a six penny one after luncheon, and a shilling one after dinner”. And he dominated the family with his absurd ruling that dinner must be at “8.14” and lunch at “1.11”.5 Ethel remembered Adrian, as a very young child, challenging Durham with repeated “Why?” questions at the dinner table. At this, Durham, who, said Ethel, “was very unkind indeed”, reprimanded Adrian, whereupon Adrian got under the table and continued his “Why?” questions from there.6 Adrian’s older brother, Geoffrey, also retaliated against Durham, in his case by urinating in Durham’s bath out of hatred of him. Unlike Geoffrey, it seems, Adrian courted Durham and succeeded, as a toddler, in transforming him from being “monosyllabic and very undemonstrative” into becoming “more affectionate”.7 Perhaps he missed Durham when he was away from home, including campaigning (unsuccessfully) as Liberal Party parliamentary candidate for Stepney in London in January 1906, and taking Ethel on exotic foreign holidays to Ceylon, Egypt, and Tunisia.\n\nEthel and Durham in Egypt, c.1907\n\n6\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nDurham and Ethel consigned the care of their sons to a succession of nursemaids and governesses. At the age of three Adrian began sharing Philip’s and Geoffrey’s governess, Miss Drew, who ruled that if the boys’ “shoelaces came undone while out for a walk, there would be no jam for tea: if they came undone again, no cake as well”. Miss Drew particularly meted out this punishment to Geoffrey, for whom it seemed to be primarily designed. Adrian did not remember it happening to him albeit he continued into adulthood to be “entirely bad at tying laces or anything else”.8 By the time he was six Geoffrey, as well as Philip, had gone to boarding school. Geoffrey was sent to a naval cadet school, probably Osborne College on the Isle of Wight. And Philip, who initially attended a day school, King Alfred’s in Hampstead, was sent to boarding school preparatory to going to public school, Rugby. In their absence Miss Drew was dismissed after someone saw her “maltreating” Adrian in the park. His next “caretaker”, Miss Harley, used to sing him hymns. “She was for me the Salvation Army of morbid streets and morbid walks,” he recalled in also recalling himself, perhaps on account of his mixture of bullying and taking care of his less able brother, Geoffrey, as akin to the brothermurdering Cain in the Bible asking “Am I my brother’s keeper?” to which Adrian added: “That was a wicked, frightened joke of Cain’s.”9 Happier memories followed. He remembered himself, aged seven, admiring twelve-year-old Philip’s love of geology on a seaside holiday at Hythe. “Philip my eldest brother still asleep … Unravels stones with hammer, doesn’t chatter,” Adrian related from that time.10 He also remembered Miss Harley being replaced as his governess by “a Swiss, French speaking … fairly normal girl”, Mathilde. She was still with the family it seems when Durham, who had been seriously ill, was sufficiently recovered to watch through binoculars from a balcony at 18 Radnor Place the funeral procession for Edward VII pass along the nearby Bayswater Road. “What stays in the mind were the long thin festive poles swathed in scarlet cloth, tipped with golden spear-heads that lined both sides of [the] Bayswater road. Even railings were tipped with gilt,” Adrian recalled from the coronation of George V the following June\n\nE A R LY Y E A R S\n\n7\n\n1911. “The coronation brought soldiers to the park. Thousands were encamped there,” he also remembered. “Both Mathilde and I worshipped the soldiers,” he wrote. For a time, I clung to military pomp and discipline as the “solution” of the park and its environs. I had tried to order the universe in earlier years by the array of my lead soldiers. I was inconsolable if one fell. And so, the face of the park came in part to be symbolized by a hybrid image of soldiers in scarlet jackets and Marble Arch orators standing on soap-boxes. At this time, too, Mathilde and I sought the press of the crowd, in Rotten Row on a Sunday morning or around the bandstand of a summer evening. I have a pictorial, almost Renoir-like image—the only one—of those times based, I have little doubt, on much later experiences. For it is night, a dark, still night with rain in the air. The speakers at Marble Arch are lit with their torches. The outer fringe of whispering couples are lit by the public lamps. The crowd where it is dense is dark. Hats are in outline, so too railings …11\n\nThen, like his older brothers before him, Adrian, having started day school when he was seven, was sent away to prep school, Heddon Court in Cockfosters on the outskirts of London. “Under the blare of King’s Cross [station] almost every boy is led by a parent far along the platform to be sick, sick from frightened anticipation, in front of the train that will throng him on an iron journey,” he recalled from the journey to Heddon Court. London drags out along the route; against the will it begins to thin: less and less people live here as if a curse lay on the glowering land. In the semi-country at Barnet we stamp our way over a bridge that clatters; we take brake for the school. Masters are with us, a matron awaits. There will be a fire-practice tomorrow …12\n\nHe hated Heddon Court. He also hated Ethel for reneging on her promise to take him away if he disliked it.\n\n8\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nGeoffrey, Philip, Durham, and Adrian, c.1913 He nevertheless did very well at Heddon Court. Encouraged perhaps by Philip’s interest in philosophy, he became precociously interested, aged eleven or twelve, in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Encouraged also by playing tennis with Philip it seemed possible that he might become a schoolboy champion. But this was thwarted by lack of tennis at Rugby where he first became a pupil in May 1916. That month, Geoffrey, who had been called up a few months earlier for naval service in the First World War, served in a crow’s nest at the top of a ship’s mast during the Battle of Jutland. Several fires broke out on board his ship, HMS Malaya. There were heavy crew casualties. By the end of the battle, over 6000 fellow combatants were wounded or dead. Geoffrey survived but he was traumatised. Nevertheless, after his ship was repaired, he rejoined it before joining another ship, HMS George V, with which he served till after the end of the war when he was then sent on a course of instruction in Cambridge. Meanwhile, in 1915, Philip won a place in his school rugby team and a scholarship to begin studying history and classics the following autumn at Queen’s College, Oxford. Then, after staying on at Rugby till Easter 1916, and after the institution that March of the Military Service Act making eighteen-year-olds liable for military conscription, he did\n\nE A R LY Y E A R S\n\n9\n\narmy officer training and was then stationed as a qualified officer at Sheerness in Kent.\n\nGeoffrey and Philip, c.1916 “It is a great comfort for me to know that you have habituated yourself into a state of calm … about everything. I have had to do the same, & am now without cares of any sort,” Philip wrote to Durham and Ethel after being sent in early January 1917 to Le Havre in France.13 In further letters home he asked after Adrian’s and Geoffrey’s wellbeing; he thanked Ethel and Durham for sending him food parcels from Fortnum & Mason in Piccadilly, and clothes parcels from Whiteleys in the Bayswater Road; and he asked them to arrange for a new pair of breeches to be sent him by his tailor, Gieves, in Savile Row. “There is much less damage in this warfare than in the trench to trench work,” he wrote reassuringly from the front where he was put in charge of sixty men in his rifle brigade.14 The following day, 4 April 1917, during fighting at Havrincourt Wood, near the River Somme, he suffered gunshot wounds to his head for which he was hospitalised in Rouen. “Regret to inform you that 2nd Lieut P D Stokes Rifle Brigade was reported … dangerously ill … permission to visit cannot be granted,” the War Office reported in a telegram to Ethel, then on holiday that Easter in Tunbridge Wells.15 “He was admitted this morning & an operation was performed this afternoon. His general condition is good at present & we hope that he will improve,” a matron looking after Philip told Durham.16 Worse news followed. “I am very grieved to send you the sad news of your son’s death,” she wrote on 10 April.\n\n10\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nHis case was practically hopeless from the first—but everything was done to try to save him. He became unconscious this morning & passed quietly away this afternoon. He was quite conscious up till yesterday—but did not realize his condition at all. He will be buried in the Cemetery of St Sever—With much sympathy for you in your great loss …17\n\n“Lieut Stokes was only with us 4 days:- he talked very little although he was perfectly rational. He left no message because I am sure that he had not the faintest idea that he was going to die,” the matron subsequently wrote in reply to a letter from Ethel. He said several times that he hoped his people would not be anxious about him—& that we would not write alarming letters about him. He complained of headache at times—but on the 3rd & 4th days he was practically unconscious the whole time & at the end,—just quietly stopped breathing. I asked the medical officer this morning if his brain would have been affected had he lived. He said that undoubtedly it would: & he would never have been the same again. In time:- even if you cannot realize it now—you will be glad that under the circumstances—he did not live …18\n\n“I was 14½ and I consider that that event has crippled my life, partly because I felt alone, partly because of the added responsibility to parents,” said Adrian in later recalling the devastating effect on him of Philip’s death.19 He had been “the jolliest boy” in his boarding house at Rugby on first arriving there in May 1916. After Philip’s death the following April he became “much more serious”.20 Previously Adrian had been “a leading light in his maths set” at Rugby.21 Now he became a “Socialist”,22 and, following the posthumous publication in 1918 of Philip’s poems as a book,23 he took on Philip’s death-thwarted wish to become a “poet, philosopher, scientist or art critic”.24 His poetry included a poem about himself as a lone, self-conscious, long-distance runner. “Softly tread the ashen path,” it began. Flowers close in when you go by, Daffodils and daisies stare and peep, Whispering shyly, “Who is there?”25\n\nE A R LY Y E A R S\n\n11\n\nHe also presented an essay about Joseph Conrad to the school literary society which was very much admired and sent to Conrad who replied agreeing with Adrian that his novel, The Secret Agent, was his best. Influenced, it seems, by this novel’s account of Hyde Park, Adrian devoted an essay to the park which was published as an article in the school literary magazine, The Rugbeian. “I stood in Hyde Park by night … I stood alone, and London moaned around,” this article begins. I was listening to the pulse of the drowsy monster which I had once loved … But this was all gone. … The night was cold, and I turned towards the Rotten Row and saw the long line of pale, sallow lights, anaemic mediocrities of pain and ugliness … Above them the plane-trees rustled in abject melancholy.26\n\nIn another article, mindful perhaps of Philip’s death and of Geoffrey having become an invalid seemingly due to the trauma he had suffered in the Battle of Jutland,27 Adrian wrote: When we see around us the smallness of the world and the carelessness of man, who is often poured into life only to die, others living only to be ever invalids … while we think of stars undiscovered, innumerable—then we begin to understand how petty is the world of one mind, the triviality of life, the individual, how he is only a particle of dust which defies the world and which in convivial moods exclaims, “I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul!”28\n\nA similar contrast between triviality and imagining himself the master of his fate bothered Adrian at Oxford.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nOxford\n\nP\n\nhilip had been prevented by his fatal wounding on the battlefields of the Somme from taking up his scholarship to begin studying history and classics at Queen’s College, Oxford, in October 1917. Two years later Adrian also applied to study history at Oxford where he won a scholarship to begin studying at Magdalen the following October. History attracted him as a means by which, he said, “all that was carried inside my mind, could be pinned down, arranged, comprehended”.1 It was, he also wrote, “an antidote to imaginative despair”.2 Oxford, however, made him feel gloomy. “Oxford is so massive,” he wrote, So dismally imposing. The giant grey blocks of clerical stone Frown down and breathe tradition.3\n\nNo surprise then, perhaps, that he decided to quit tradition and history for philosophy on first becoming a student in October 1920 at Magdalen where he registered for that year’s newly introduced degree, Modern Greats, comprising philosophy, politics, and economics. 13\n\n14\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nAt Rugby he had studied the philosophy of Hegel, including Hegel’s emphasis on the unity of reality and reason. To this Adrian now added study of the neo-Hegelian philosophy of the Oxford don, F. H. Bradley, emphasising the interdependence of part and whole, the unity of appearance and reality, and identity in difference. Later Adrian would develop these aspects of philosophy in psychoanalysing art. Neither psychoanalysis nor art, however, interested him particularly at Oxford, where, as well as studying philosophy, he doodled and tried out his skill as a writer. “Ah, how pleasant to hear that barrel organ! I am sitting in a dull old College Hall at Oxford one hard grey February morning. The lecturer is droning on,” he wrote. The barrel organ is a godsend for me. I am back again in my nursery amongst my toys. I live again the days when Santa Claus really existed and when I thought that the French people spent their time walking about France singing the Marseillaise. I have lived in London all my life, and a barrel organ has visited me every Wednesday between 1 and 2 o’clock, the same barrel organ, the same barrel organ tunes. Whenever I hear a barrel organ, I think of the days when I did not yet know that life was for many a morbid struggle, so sad and perplexing …4\n\nThen he doodled—“The other half of the half-witted old man,” he labelled the result.\n\nOxford doodle, c.1920\n\nOX F O R D\n\n15\n\nMeanwhile, bereft of their beloved eldest son, Philip, Ethel and Durham sold their 18 Radnor Place home and moved to a large house, Lower Stonehams, in Pangbourne, less than thirty miles from Adrian at Magdalen. Here, in the grounds of their new home, they had a garden created in memory of Philip in which no one but Ethel was allowed to go because his loss was “a sorrow that she kept to herself”.5\n\nLower Stonehams, Pangbourne “I feel powerless to face even the greatest moments of life, and how much less the smallest … so conscious am I of an emptiness and the inadequacy of even the grandest and most sublime,” their bereaved son, Adrian, wrote at about this time at Oxford. We can see the stars and count the ages; we know of the multitude of men who have lived captivated by the same interests and emotions; we scan what seem great truths, yet we have to watch all our interest at one moment centre around a letter to be posted, a dog to be stroked, or meat to be eaten …6\n\nHe imagined a self-hating philosophy don—“a queer, unnatural, unearthly creature”—berating “hearties … pipe-smokers … aesthetes” for their trivial preoccupations. He imagined this don also berating himself. “I am in a state of complete flux, not knowing where to turn, I watch myself and laugh derisively,” the don tells his lecture audience.7 Adrian was also derisive about himself at Oxford where he described himself as “a miserable recluse”.8 Yet he was also involved in the manic\n\n16\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nhomosexual whirl of early 1920s post-war Oxford later described by his friend, Evelyn Waugh, in the novel, Brideshead Revisted. For Adrian this whirl included the start of close friendships with various Old Etonians including Robert Byron (who became an expert in Byzantine history); John Strachey (who became a leading Labour Party politician); and Edward “Eddy” Sackville-West (later well known as a music critic and novelist). Like Adrian, Eddy had recently been bereaved. Whereas Adrian had been bereaved by the death of his brother prior to becoming a student at Oxford, Eddy had been bereaved by the death of his mother. Now, in 1922, Eddy began writing a novel in which he depicted his mother admiring an Adrian-like character as immensely “attractive” with “his big fair head, his square shoulders, his strong thighs and ankles” and “subtle mischief in his bright eyes” which, together with “the magnetism of his strength and beauty”, this character uses to win from others the “confidence and admiration” which, said Eddy, he craved.9\n\nEddy Sackville-West, c.1922 Eddy might well have been the cause of a “homoerotic” letter which Durham and Ethel discovered and which decided them to persuade Adrian to join them away from Oxford at Rapallo at the end of his third autumn term at Magdalen.10 He remembered the train journey taking him from France into Italy as a revelation. “Although the last day of\n\nOX F O R D\n\n17\n\nthe year, December 31st, 1922, the air was soft, tender, a darkness as of a perfect fitting lid upon the radiant world through which I passed,” he wrote. The revelation continued when, after he was taken by horsedrawn carriage to Durham’s and Ethel’s hotel in Rapallo, he awoke the following morning.11 “There was a revealing of things in the Mediterranean sunlight, beyond any previous experience, I had the new sensation that the air was touching things; that the space between things touched them, belonged in common; that space itself was utterly revealed,” he marvelled. There was a neatness in the light. Nothing hid or was hidden. Soon, an electric train passed, gliding with ease on the hard way just below, entered a tunnel. Unlike the electric trains on London’s metropolitan railway, which had always been a disturbance, this train and the tunnel did not prolong themselves inside me. It seemed that, for the first time things were happening entirely outside me. Existence was enormously enlarged by the miracle of the neat defining light.12\n\nThen he was again in Oxford where he captained the Magdalen tennis team and wrote the best finals paper of his year in philosophy.\n\nMagdalen tennis team, 1923, Adrian (centre)\n\n18\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nAfter graduating that summer, 1923, he stayed at Lower Stonehams where he hoped to write a book. Durham, however, had other ideas. He was determined that Adrian should earn his own living. Giving in to this determination Adrian got paid work as a journalist in London. But he hated travelling on the underground. “All these people, different faces; they’re all different, and I can’t stand it,” he complained to his Old Rugbeian friend, Joseph Macleod, who not unreasonably asked, “Wouldn’t it be worse if they all looked the same?”13 Adrian was not persuaded. On 26 July his brother, Geoffrey, got married to a young bride, Kathleen Spagnoletti. Then, after provoking an argument with Durham, to which Durham retaliated by asking when he was leaving home and never coming back, Adrian “drew lots for a ship” and left London, on 18 August 1923, “alone, and without a watch”, on board the SS City of Lucknow bound for Bombay.14\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nEast and west\n\nP\n\nrevented by Durham from writing a book at Lower Stonehams, Adrian instead began writing it in the form of a diary during his voyage east to Bombay. As though he were the Greek hero, Theseus, following a thread provided by Ariadne as a means of retracing his footsteps in a labyrinth away from the monster Minotaur, he called the resulting book, The Thread of Ariadne. For him the monster seems to have been the “Victorianism” and “Mathematical Thought” of Durham and his generation cutting up experience with numbers, words, and future-oriented ideals.1 Against this monster Adrian championed “the realization of Youth” and “the art of creating a harmony of emotions and states of mind, diverse in themselves but incapable of standing alone, pure, and without contrast, and so, interdependent from their very nature”. He called it “the art of concocting a mixture of jostling ingredients” through the method of attending to whatever free associations were suggested by the world around him.2\n\n19\n\n20\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\n“It rains, and a bird flies across in front of me,” he wrote. Then, pursuing the associations this brought to mind, he added: Wet, dull-red tiles, and the quad at Rugby with a disused bat soaked by the rain in the middle. Half an hour before three o’clock and afternoon school, and masters arriving with umbrellas; the most dismal time of the day for rain. A maid scurries along one of the dully-expectant dormitories above, looking for a duster she left under a bed in the morning …3\n\nFurther associations occurred to Adrian on first seeing Bombay. “All that I could distinguish were some chimney factories and a large dome— some old mosque, no doubt,—and scenes from ‘Chu Chin Chow’ and ‘The Garden of Allah’,” he reported in a newspaper article.4 “I had visions of tea and telling people how stupidly depressed I had been as I hurried on,” he said of himself after disembarking and getting lost in Bombay’s zoological gardens. It was now beginning to get dark and there was that melancholy awe about which fills public gardens at dusk when noises are so distinct and park keepers so noticeable. As I turned to the left to go out by the imposing main entrance into the busy main street I was conscious only of the atmosphere of Kensington Gardens and the noises of Bayswater road mingling with the smoke of an autumnal bon fire—and Peter Pan and time to go home in my pram with the first lights to high tea and bed.5\n\nOther associations occurred to him on appointing himself agent of the British Raj’s apartheid exclusion of non-Europeans from its Europeansonly railway compartments. “As the Madras mail train left Bombay, two men boarded the carriage who looked as if they would be more at home in the other 3rd class carriages,” he wrote. I tactfully pointed this out to them as we were rather full. “We are Europeans,” they said. “Why?” I asked helplessly. “We are Jews,” they said triumphantly. Now this was puzzling … the fact remained that Jews came from Palestine which is in Asia. … There certainly are lots of Jews in Europe but what of that …6\n\nHe himself, of course, was a Jew who mostly lived in Europe. But that did not abate his anti-Semitism in this encounter. Then he was in Madras and on his way to Ceylon where he contrasted east and west.\n\nEAST AND WEST\n\n21\n\n“The other night, accompanied by Silva and other members of the hotel staff, I visited a Buddhist temple … A real religion with no sticky Earlscourtian sentimentalism,” he wrote. “Sincere religious emotion in the temple, and meditation on God and the transitory nature of things. Walk out and crack any joke and light a cigarette,” he added. “Why no qualms,” he asked. Perhaps, he replied, because “ordinary life is necessary to give this holiness its meaning”. It was the same with the ordinary life depicted in the modern novel—in Virginia Woolf’s Jacob’s Room, for example—which he praised as antidote to the western habit of cutting-up experience with “the definiteness of words”.7 He studied “the six systems of Indian philosophy” while camping near the River Ganges with a missionary, Charles, in Colgong. Here he went with Charles to a leper colony and to a market. This prompted further associations, specifically about men in “the trenches just before going over the top”; translating “Sunt loca non procul …” from Virgil into “An old grove of Dionysus now used as a market, far in the rustic forest”; and memories of “picking up potatoes” with German prisoners of war at Rugby.8\n\nTaj Mahal, Agra\n\n22\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nIn one of his newspaper articles published in India he mentioned getting together with a British soldier—“a Tommy”—on the train taking them to Agra and the Taj Mahal. “Not a bad hutch by any means,” said the Tommy.9 For Adrian the Taj became the first instance, at least in print, in which he dwelt at length on the physical materials from which art is made. “Marble when in such beautiful proportions has the attraction of a little model or a delicate doll’s house; definite, complete and suggestive, only of itself,” he wrote of the Taj. But above all the Taj is felt to be ageless and weatherless. Surely that marble cannot be sullied by anything, one feels—the rain only dances on marble—the Taj is weatherless—an indoor effect successfully defying the elements. It is like a house we build with ivory black-backed dominoes on a table—clean cut to a degree affording the only complete suggestion of the sheer.10\n\nThe Taj caught his attention in India. So did musing on the philosophy of identity in difference which he had learnt at Oxford. “Now suppose everything in the world were black … then … we would not see things as black—in fact we would have no conception of colour, just as if there were no light, we would have no conception of darkness,” he wrote. “Just one spot of yellow somewhere, and black would come into existence,” he philosophised. “Nothing that we can conceive is independent. However ultimate it may seem, it is interdependent for its very meaning. Good and Evil, Subject and Object, Beauty and Ugliness—are all defined by one another.” Hence, he said, his distrust of the “definiteness of words” in the west cutting off one thing from another on which it depends. He preferred the east and Benares— “indefinite like a dream” with its “mass of colours and crooked storeys forming the wonderful sweep of the river crowned by a Venetian sky”.11 Then he was on his way from India to Burma, Penang, Hong Kong, Canton, Shanghai, and across the Pacific to Canada where he marvelled at the sight of the Niagara Falls that winter. [E]verything, except the half-frozen fall, was white and still with several feet of snow. The water fell in steady tons, too gigantic to be hurried. A perpetual rainbow flitted at the base amongst the froth and steam, and all around this display of ungovernable power, in some places within a few inches, hung long, disdainful stalactites,\n\nEAST AND WEST\n\n23\n\ncomatose and beautiful. Here were mutually-heightened contrasts, here was Interdependence of meaning.12\n\nHis philosophy of interdependence preoccupied him. He was also preoccupied with lack of cash for which he cabled home to Durham. Mean as usual, however, Durham only sent him “the exact fare” for his ticket home,13 which Adrian supplemented by getting paid for playing his Swannee whistle—“the latest Jazz instrument”, he called it—in a band.14 After returning to London he earned money again as a journalist. This included writing for the Westminster Gazette; contributing to a gossip column in The Manchester Guardian; and getting work, on the strength of a trial baseball report, with the Daily Sketch. When the rent on his attic room at 28 Bloomsbury Street in London became overdue he accepted the invitation from his Magdalen College contemporary, John Strachey, to move into the home Strachey shared with Eddy Sackville-West in London while Eddy was away being psychoanalysed in Germany. “Now I am a journalist I report. I have to be smart, slick, funny— Frightfully good for me—much better than your London Season which requires much the same things but whose demands are not so rigorous or so long,” Adrian had previously boasted to Eddy.15 After moving into Eddy’s room, however, he became abject and contrite. “I write this sitting at your desk listening to a Mozart Quartette [sic] on your gramophone—and about to sleep in your bed,” he apologised to Eddy. I didn’t realize what colossal cheek it is … Of course I pay telephone, gas, washing etc and I am keeping an account of everything and I don’t touch anything, and nothing of mine comes out of my box. I take great care. Is it alright … till you come back … I shan’t use your envelopes again … I do love all your things and they are so good for me. I know you much better while I live amongst your things and I treat them with great reverence. Is it Sacrilege? … I think I must have wanted to come very much. I don’t even risk not being tidy. I don’t unpack anything. For goodness sake be angry if you are angry, otherwise you will hate me …16\n\nFearful of annoying Eddy by staying on in his room he nevertheless remained there till Eddy returned after which he went to stay at Lower Stonehams.\n\n24\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nFrom there, or from the flat at 13 Porchester Terrace (off the Bayswater Road) which Durham acquired that year, Adrian regaled Eddy with news of his travels. They included planning to go to Finland, probably with an Old Rugbeian school friend, Rolf Gardiner; and going to the Lido in Venice. He also boasted to Eddy about various casualseeming affairs including one with someone he mysteriously referred to as “the pipe man”, who was, he said, “joining the guards as a Tommy”, and with whom he was thinking of joining the then Rif Rebellion against Spanish colonial rule in Morocco.17 The pipe man did indeed go to Morocco. Not so Adrian who was busy finishing his book, The Thread of Ariadne, on which he had worked during his round-the-world travels. “What about the chapter ‘The Bridge’—must I rewrite that too, and tell me honestly, can the rest of the book stand or am I still open to the charge of ‘formlessness’,” he asked Eddy. Strachey’s sister, who worked on their father’s paper, The Spectator, advised Adrian about his book. So did her brother, John. “[He] thinks I apologize too much, and so do you with the ‘Young book’ etc,” Adrian told Eddy. “[B]ut you must not forget that it is not a novel, and when you preach to the world at 21 and revolt against everything, there is no point in pretending to be unaware of your apparent enormity.”18 John’s father advised Adrian about his Ariadne book. He also recommended it to the publishers Hodder & Stoughton. But they rejected it, as did the publishers Jonathan Cape, Chatto & Windus, and Allen & Unwin. Then on 18 November 1924 Kegan Paul, Trench & Trubner wrote to Adrian agreeing to publish the book provided he pay half the cost of its production and promotion. He was furious, however, when they still had not sent proofs the following month; and when Geoffrey, his wife, Kathleen, and her parents made him lose his temper that Christmas. Perhaps he was cheered up by an Old Etonian friend, George Rylands, inviting him to “a little party of four” at the Café Royal to “celebrate the death of 1924”; and by the publication of his Ariadne book the following February.19 “In form [it] is an account of the bewilderments and contradictions and despairs through which the author passed before he found peace of mind and certainty of value (or ‘meaning’, he terms it) in everyday life,” summarised a review in The Spectator.20 This certainly seems a fair assessment of Adrian’s Ariadne book in which he described himself as “driven from pillar to post … in this world of intertwining tremendosities”; and as having suffered “the full buffetings of presuppositional\n\nEAST AND WEST\n\n25\n\ndemands” against which he had developed an obsession, he confessed, with “putting things straight in a docketed, precise manner”.21 He followed this by deriding the “picking and choosing” of “Hearties” and “Aesthetes” and of “Idealists” and “Fanatics” for failing to attend to “ordinary circumstances” and the “associations” these circumstances evoked.22 He linked this failure with the division of inner and outer, subject and object, in the philosophy of Descartes and Kant. He much preferred, he said, the philosophy of interdependence developed by Hegel and Bradley. “The conception of reality only gains meaning in contrast to appearance,” he went on. As illustration he gave the example of “Chaos” and “Coherency” each giving the other meaning by virtue of their contrast with each other. “[W]ords and arguments”, he added, are also given meaning by what is visible in the world around us. He also wrote approvingly about a painting by Bernardino Luini showing Christ, said Adrian, “searching away in the distance far beyond the words He speaks and the arguments He is upholding”.23\n\nLuini, Christ with Elders in the Temple, c.1515–1530\n\n26\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nAs further evidence that the outside world gives meaning to what is within us Adrian included notes from his round-the-world travel diary. They included the observation that “ordinary life” might be necessary to give “holiness its meaning”; and his telling himself, “Keep your highflying thoughts, but also remember that they are easily redressed, and would have no meaning if you did not also attach meaning to your cup of tea.”24 “The essential is to touch life, to enlarge our living relationship with the world,” explained a review in the Times Literary Supplement, “and we can do this only by throwing off the shackles and conventions of logical consistency and launching ourselves upon the uncharted sea, confident in our ability to assimilate realities of which we are a part,” this review continued.25 “The spectacle of a passionate, thoughtful youth, solitary and despairing in a world peopled by gigantic, meaningless abstractions, mastering the monsters … and achieving serenity—if this is not drama, where is one to find it?” asked the writer, Hulbert Footner, in the New York Saturday Review, referring to The Thread of Ariadne when it was published in America.26 By then Adrian’s travels had taken him again to Italy.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nSitwell protégé\n\n“\n\nT\n\nhe brothers Sitwell are here,” Adrian wrote excitedly from the grand Hotel Bristol in Rapallo in early 1925.1 By then the brothers, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, together with their older sister, Edith, had become leading lights of the British avant-garde with their promotion of the Ballets Russes productions of Sergei Diaghilev; with the organisation by Osbert and Sacheverell of one of the first exhibitions of modern painting in London; with Edith’s public reading in 1923 of her poem, Façade, to music composed and conducted by the Sitwells’ protégé, William Walton; and with the publication in 1924 of Osbert’s first work of fiction, Triple Fugue, and Sacheverell’s book, Southern Baroque. “The Sitwells were the first to open my eyes, met by chance in Italy,” Adrian later said of his first becoming a Sitwell protégé in 1925 in Rapallo.2 Here, persuaded by Osbert, Durham agreed to give Adrian money to fund his life as a writer rather than putting pressure on him to get paid work as a journalist and train as a lawyer.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nOsbert, Edith, and Sacheverell Sitwell Free from this pressure, Adrian accompanied the Sitwells that March to Valencia, Madrid, Seville, Ronda, Malaga, Cordoba, and Granada in Spain. “They were really quite alarming—alarming rather than forbidding. All of them were wearing black capes and black Andalusian hats and looked magnificent,” said Cyril Connolly after seeing the Sitwells and their entourage that April 1925 at the Washington Irving Hotel in Granada.3 “Write to me about your plans and when you want to go to Venice. May I think will suit me. I will go there to settle for several months as I propose having Venice as a background for a book,” Adrian had meanwhile written to Eddy from Seville.4 “I will be back 4–6 April—not later. Stay in London a little longer,” he wrote again to Eddy after learning that Eddy had reneged on staying with him that May in Venice.5 Whether or not he met up with Eddy on his return from Spain to London that spring, it was without Eddy that Adrian arrived in Venice on 5 May, booked himself into a box room at the Hotel Savoia e Iolanda near the Doge’s Palace, and began making notes for his next book. “Far better than admitting the neuralgic pang of conscience is to try to be receptive, to live the inspiration of such moments when there is no thought of pleasure or pain but only ecstasy,” he noted.6 “In my mind all the time is, of course, sex,” he continued.\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n29\n\nMoral indignation, religion at a standstill, hovering with evening— dressed dry-mouthed, fish-eyed, pouncingness on any form of aimlessness, the Ruskinicate, the stone-throw between Sunday church and Sunday lunch, Sunday nap and week-day nightly salutation to the children—upset me more than anything else. You see, my dear, religion is hot inspiration, a pouring forth, a prostration, an ecstasy, and its indignation is not a moral indignation, not something staunch with a red face. I think Ruskin must have been an eunuch although a great man. He lashes me daily, hurls at me Stones of Venice.7\n\nIt was not clear where this was leading. Nor did further notes help—the following included. Distant thunder and lightning that plays about the eager dome of the Salute—lust-life, trickly water that comes lip lap in ripples that wash with lingering dabs the fondamenta when burnished-prowed gondolas dart past—music that lingers beneath the stars widening as the inlaid porphyries of the Palazzo Dario, swallowed up to the stars to the cup chimneys of the Palazzo Dario that have drunk down the air in quiet ecstasy these five hundred years …8\n\nBy then he had moved to the Casa Scomparin by the Grand Canal in Venice from where he wrote to Eddy who was staying in Switzerland with a specialist in oriental ceramics, William “Billy” Winkworth.9 “I don’t know the man, but fancy going to Switzerland,” Adrian expostulated from his “enormous room with countless beds” at the Casa Scomparin, from where he grumbled to Eddy: “I live alone—absolutely and don’t speak to anybody and all day silly words like ‘grist’ and ‘Christostoms’ run in my head.”10 He had raged against words in his Ariadne book. Now he raged against words used by a friend (with whom he had previously sailed on the Norfolk Broads and spent time in the Pyrenees, Germany, and Austria) after this friend joined him in Venice from where they travelled together to Ravenna and Rimini. “It was about the word ‘Forrarder’ that he aired … He used the word in some connection and I took violent exception to it as being suggestive of stale-tea, squalid, smugness which was most repulsive if one still had soul to get satisfaction in other ways,” Adrian explained.\n\n30\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nHe then said that it was a word “Jorrocks” (!) uses. At which I was really angry and said that although I did not know exactly what Jorrocks connoted … I knew enough to understand that it was connected with hunting and whiskey-drinking and was quite unpardonable in Italy … He then said that his father and mother were both hunting people and that his father had drunk whiskey …11\n\nFed up with what he described as Adrian’s “love of bullying” this friend and travelling companion quit Adrian in Rimini for Lora and Valparaiso in Spain.12 It was therefore without this man that Adrian travelled on that July to Urbino where Osbert Sitwell had particularly recommended him to see the town’s very beautiful ducal palace. Adrian was especially impressed by the palace’s courtyard which, together with the early Renaissance Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (see p. 52), gave him, he later said, “the greatest architectural kick I have ever had”.13 Meanwhile that summer of 1925 he travelled on from Urbino to Bologna, Modena, Mantua, Verona, and Venice from where he was “whirled … almost unnoticing”, perhaps by Eddy’s lover, Billy Winkworth, to the Grand Hotel Villa D’Este in Crenobbia by Lake Como. “Alone at night you walk an ancient garden and at its end quietly the waters of the lake insist,” Adrian wrote referring to Lake Como. The scene is beautiful, complete to itself, transmuting all else into a bad dream, but—but what? It may be absurd but you cannot entirely forget that impossible journey from Milan, those heaving females … you could not experience horror at enormity if you were not also capable of realizing the peace of the lake.14\n\nIt was another example of the interdependence of opposites—in this case peace and horror of heaving females. Females continued to bother and annoy Adrian on his return to Venice, especially an English woman who had booked every room at the Casa Scomparin leaving him with little hope, he complained, of finding somewhere else to stay near the Grand Canal that summer. Soon, however, he found beautiful accommodation with Billy Winkworth in an art nouveau building, the Casa dei tre Occhi, which had been designed by a painter, Mario de Maria, and built across from the Doge’s Palace on the Giudecca.\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n31\n\nCasa dei tre Occhi, Venice Here, at the Casa dei tre Occhi, Adrian and Billy were joined by the art historian, Leigh Ashton (later a director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London). Osbert Sitwell was also in Venice by early September. But he was in great distress at having lost his usual travelling companion, his brother Sacheverell, to imminent marriage to Georgia Doble in Paris. Osbert’s friends, Dick Wyndham and Raymond Mortimer, kept him company in Venice. But they were no compensation for Sacheverell not being there. Nor was Adrian. He had piles and could “hardly move”.15 He was nevertheless well enough to quit Venice with Osbert who wanted to avoid the imminent arrival there of his father, Sir George.\n\n32\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\n“Venice wound up rather hectically but I will slink any somewhere to spend the winter quietly. I have been consistently ill for the last 3 weeks—in pain and then without,” Adrian wrote after leaving Venice for Brescia and Parma.16 From there, with travel directions from Osbert, he went south to stay at a converted convent, the Hotel Cappuccini, high above the Bay of Naples at Amalfi where he read, and wrote down examples from, James Frazer’s study of magic and religion, The Golden Bough. These examples included the following ritual described by Frazer whereby in Chittagong in east Bengal … when a woman cannot bring her child to the birth, the mid-wife gives orders to throw all doors and windows wide open, to uncork all bottles, to remove the bungs from all casks, to unloose the cows in the stall, the horses in the stable, the watchdog in his kennel, to set free sheep, fowl, ducks, and so forth …17\n\nThis woman-centred ritual interested Adrian. Yet he was also paranoid about women. “A Russian woman has given me the fright of my life. I’ve been taking part in a sort of Phillips Oppenheim story for the last fortnight, treading between bombs amidst a flutter of death-dealing anonymous letters,” he told Eddy from Amalfi.18 Then, in reply to Eddy asking for more details, he wrote: The woman fooled me. She now runs up and down terraces heaving bosoms to show me how young she is. I have now reached such a state that if a woman slapps [sic] herself accidently [sic], it makes me feel rather faint.19\n\nFearful of women, he was also fearful of what he diagnosed in himself as “claustra-phobia” at the Hotel Cappuccini. “This is a foul place shut in by a nasty shanty Norquesan beach met by the landsliding mountains all bulwarked up,” he griped. [V]ery ugly and then there is the hotel with a knitted woollen scarf of a convent thrown into it perched on the bulwarks, all cells and one passage. The only place where you can walk is on a parallel terrace where you see the only orange that you are going to have for dinner.20\n\nNor, it seems, was Adrian much comforted by being joined at the hotel by Osbert, Sacheverell, and Georgia Sitwell; by the composer, William Walton; and by another Sitwell protégé, a young poet and student from Oxford, Peter Quennell.\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n33\n\nHotel Cappuccini, Amalfi Adrian was unhappy at the hotel. So was Quennell. He found the Sitwells’ working holiday regime there oppressive: Osbert writing a novel, Before the Bombardment; Sacheverell “weaving the rich autobiographical tapestry of All Summer in a Day”; Walton “hammering away at a decrepit upright piano”; and Adrian “launching an imaginative expedition into modern art-criticism”.21 Quennell was glad to get away. So was Adrian. By early 1926 he was again in Rapallo at the Hotel Bristol. Also at the hotel that month was the British foreign minister, Austen Chamberlain; his visitor, Benito Mussolini, who had just become Fascist dictator of Italy; and the artist, William Rothenstein, who recalled Adrian at the hotel that winter as having a “blonde head chockfull of ideas, very abstract ideas”.22 Later that spring Adrian was in Rome where, through his Old Rugbeian school friend, Rolf Gardiner, he met Rolf’s sister, Margaret. “He is a lovely person,” Margaret soon after wrote to Rolf thanking him for introducing her to Adrian.23 “He really was the most fabulous looking young man I think I had ever met, then or since. He had this fair hair, wonderful large eyes set at a strange sweeping angle, very blue,” she said of Adrian.\n\n34\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nHe looked down most of the time, but when he looked up it was absolutely breath-taking. And he had a beak-like nose. He had a general air of being some sort of magnificent bird. And he moved very well. And he had beautiful hands. I loved talking to him. I loved doing things with him. But there was always a certain remoteness about him as far as I was concerned and I dare say that that was true of his relation to almost everybody. There was a distance between him and other people. There was what I would call a secret quality about him as though his life were elsewhere.24\n\nHis life was evidently elsewhere when, after leaving Rome in the early spring of 1926, he found himself “mentally arranging” the town’s churches during a Diaghilev production of Boris Gudonov which he attended in Naples.25\n\nRehearsing Les Noces\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n35\n\nFrom Naples he went to Portugal where he stayed with Osbert at the Palace Hotel in Bussaco and “motored” to see Romanesque monasteries in Coimbra, Batalha, and Alcobaça.26 Then, after further travels, he returned to London where, for the first time, he saw the avant-garde productions of the Ballets Russes which included Les Matelots and Les Noces that June, and Jack in the Box and Parade that July. “It was all in black and white. The dancers, when they were not more actively employed, piled themselves and laced themselves into pyramidal patterns, from which peered forth sorrowful heads,” complained a reviewer of Les Noces in Punch.27 Adrian, by contrast, was delighted. “In the music” of Les Noces “Stravinsky de-ridiculizes the sublime,” he wrote admiringly. “What else in Art can banish for a moment the world of comparison and the bridging of distance, what else can forestall the nimble regret,” he asked. [W]hat other appreciation is free of the irksome muslin about the mind through which the past is strained and which is at once fatally rent by a voice in the street, need not spend itself upon the choice and ordering of associations? As we stand behind the dress circle at the ballet, for once in a way we live with double intensity our own existence, and our attention is absorbed rather than shoved and jostled on some path.28\n\nGrateful to Les Noces and to other Ballets Russes productions by Diaghilev for taking him out of himself, Adrian devoted much of the preface of his now nearly completed book to praise of Jean Cocteau, Eric Satie, Igor Stravinsky, and others involved with the Ballets Russes. While awaiting this book’s publication Adrian stayed that June and August with Eddy in rooms which had recently been assigned to Eddy over the gatehouse of the Sackville-West home at Knole Castle in Kent. Adrian was “thrilled” by the prospect of staying there.29 It was evidently a great relief to be with Eddy rather than at Lower Stonehams from where he had told Eddy: “Am really thoroughly wretched what with one thing and another and don’t seem able to leave this terrible place.”30 Getting away from Lower Stonehams often took him abroad. More immediately that September it took him to a small house, Winstons, owned by William Rothenstein, on the outskirts of a remote hamlet, Far Oakridge, in the Cotswolds. Staying there, however, did not cheer Adrian up. “This cottage is a real Wuthering Heights and it is almost\n\n36\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nimpossible to get food,” he complained in thanking Eddy for dedicating to him his then newly published novel, The Ruin. “It arrived yesterday and I read it all day. I was very moved and dreamed about it all night. I really do appreciate the book. I hope this will not set you against it,” he wrote. “I think it is a lasting achievement—this writing about your own house. You have succeeded in doing something that only you could do. This, surely, is the height of triumph.”31 No mention in this letter of the fact that Eddy prefaced The Ruin with a quote from Nietzsche: “Bist du ein Tyrann? So kannst du nicht Freunde haben” (“Are you a tyrant? Then you can have no friends”). Nor was there mention of Eddy depicting him, or someone very like him, saying, “I cannot live without a slave! I want and must have a complete ascendancy over another being, no matter who it is”; or of this character seeking to get away from an inner “daemon … that possessed him and urged him in turn to possess others” and from his craving “admiration” from them so as to transform or “metaphorise” terrible inner “realities” into outward form.32 Perhaps these inner realities exacerbated the physical ills from which Adrian suffered at Winstons that September. Nor was this helped the following month by his having “an awful row” the following month with Durham from which he escaped to Rapallo for which he renewed his passport.33 “What has one left behind?” he asked. “Discipline and licence. Waiting. Waiting for the rain to stop, waiting for the spring, waiting for the evening paper, for the cinemas to open … No moment is self-sufficient. Waiting for Saturday night.”34\n\nPassport photo, 1926\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n37\n\nHe was happier, it seems, early that November when, through asking Henry Rhode, the owner of tennis courts in Rapallo, if there was anyone living in the town who spoke English and might give him a game, Rhode introduced him to Ezra Pound. Pound’s tennis-playing (see p. 47) was apparently very eccentric and peppered with “very unorthodox yells and interjections”.35 Nevertheless Adrian often played tennis with him, beginning that autumn, before he returned to London where he wrote about his unhappiness there. “The world has turned monk. In the fields the smoking rubbish heaps draw a cowl over the stubble’s beard. In Hyde Park, too, they are burning rubbish, and peacocks hoot at the sinking year,” he wrote. London is sacked. In the hot months the city laid its heart upon the busy thoroughfares. Autumn has wizarded it away. … The red tennis courts at Queens Club are hard to the feet. Over a red and blue brick wall of a type common to maternity homes in the big thoroughfares, over a street in which the gas lamps are always burning, there stands a row of residential houses of an ugliness that is only surpassed by Harrods. The air is black and cold. Hold back the grimy net.36\n\nHow different from the title of his book, Sunrise in the West, which was soon after published and later billed by its American publishers as a challenge to the German writer Otto Spengler’s then recently published tome, Decline of the West. Far from being in decline, declared Adrian, the west was beginning a new renaissance with the modern art of Braque, Proust, and the Ballets Russes. So saying he went on to dwell on the “poetry” and “mystery” of eastern ritual, and on the “Christian Catholicism of the Dark and Middle Ages”. He then proceeded to praise the influence of “Byzantine art” and “Greek tradition” on the art of early Renaissance—quattrocento—Italy.37 “Blue skies shouted, and before the world could wake secure and processional captivity, the Quatro Cento [sic] had fired the exuberance of boyish prowess,” he said of this renaissance. As examples he cited a doorway designed by Francesco di Giorgio, a marble low relief attributed to Agostino di Duccio, and an early cinquecento painting, Madonna, Child, and Two Saints, by Giorgione. “The trusting thoughts lie deep within her sad eyes,” Stokes said of this Madonna.\n\n38\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\n“St Francis, too, far below by the side of the throne, contemplates as singly, reading his sharp visions and impetuous love into the marble.” Meanwhile the saint in “shining armour … does not stare at the ground but looks ahead … taki[ng] trust, not through the persuasion of doctrine, but from the ardour of blue skies”.38\n\nGiorgione, Madonna, Child, and Two Saints, c.1503–1504\n\nS I T W E L L P R OT É G É\n\n39\n\nAfter thus praising quattrocento and early cinquecento art Adrian reviled the “prose-poetry”, as he called it, of art inspired by neoPlatonist ideas, the ideals of Calvin, or by the moral strictures of “Honesty, Justice, Coherence, Duty” and by the “mighty giants” of “God, Good, Beauty”. They weigh down the soul, he complained. They frighten children and make “man’s life like a pudding, with ingredients measured according to his abilities and station, every ingredient as docile as a prune … of endless calculation”.39 The best art, he insisted—“a good drawing by Picasso, the mosaics in the Church of San Appolinaris” in Ravenna, or “the loggia del Capitanio” in Vicenza, for example—results not from the prose of preconceived ideas, ideals, and calculation. It results from the poetry of what artists find in the physical world around them “impelling” their “immediate vision”.40 Both are needed: the poetry of immediate vision together with the prose of fact and reason. D. H. Lawrence was right to distrust “thought-consciousness”. What is also needed for the best art to come into being is outward-looking “spontaneity” together with the “otherness” of prose as a channel absorbing “the alloy of poetry”.41 “[W]e must have faith in our age, faith in the clean-sweep of matured prose, modern consciousness, faith in the starkness of machinery, courage to accept the interdependence of values … which … when courageously admitted … provide the medium, dig the channel down which the chasing waters of a pure poetry may flow,” he excitedly concluded. “We have discovered prose and poetry … and the supreme rule of their relationship, the sacred source of life itself and the secret of its everlasting youthfulness.”42 “No published book by a new writer contains more beauty of phrase and imagination, more strangeness and vitality than this,” admired Edith Sitwell.43 “Rhythmic prose is invoked to defend the Occident,” announced a review in the New York Times praising Sunrise in the West for its “passages of uncommonly good poetic prose”.44 “Exhilarated, pardonably enough, by the originality of his ideas, Mr. Stokes pours out images and arguments helter-skelter … throwing out a brilliant picture … or condensing the history of a thousand years into an epigram,” applauded the Times Literary Supplement.45 He had evidently begun making his mark as an exciting and excited young writer earning homage from Pound as “the rising Stokes”.46\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nSigismondo Malatesta and Ezra Pound\n\nE\n\nzra Pound first applauded Adrian as “the rising Stokes” after seeing a copy of his book, Sunrise in the West, with a copy of a marble low relief from the Tempio in Rimini on its cover (see overleaf). “Has a Rimini plaque on his wrapper and a great many mixed metaphors inside it; but it is not pifflingly frivolous,” Pound told his mistress, Olga Rudge, from Rapallo, soon after seeing the book in early January 1927.1 “Young chap called Adrian Stokes has drifted into the village, with large trunk full of highbrow books (Spengler etc) which I am swallowing in return for tips on the XV century,” Pound also wrote that January.2 Stokes himself, however, knew scarcely anything about fifteenth century Italy when he first saw the Tempio in early July 1925. All he knew then, he said, was that Sigismondo Malatesta, at whose command a church, San Francesco, was converted into the Tempio in 1450s Rimini, was “a great military leader” who gathered painters and scholars at his court to “secure immortality for himself” and for his mistress, later his wife, Isotta.3 By the time Stokes learnt this Pound had been so inspired by Sigismondo’s Tempio in Rimini, and by meeting with members of Mussolini’s Fascist party there, he had done research in the nearby 41\n\n42\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nBook cover\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n43\n\nMalatestiana library in Cesena into the life and times of Sigismondo.4 He also persuaded the reluctant Ernest Hemingway and his wife to join himself and his wife, Dorothy Pound, on a tour in early 1923 of sites associated with Sigismondo’s military exploits, after which T. S. Eliot published four of Pound’s Malatesta Cantos in The Criterion that July. These poems were then included in Pound’s book, A Draft of XVI Cantos, a copy of which he gave to Stokes who soon after drafted an essay which he called “Preliminary Cantos”. “Pilasters, swift as steel, friezes that are thin strips of line, arcs that hurry to their bases, ogival ribs, delicate as the legs of a suspended daddylong-legs vaulting a dome or a loggia, are drawn upon the stucco canvass,” he wrote in this essay in which he criticised the speeded up quattrocento architecture, as he saw it, of Brunelleschi and his followers in Florence. “In the Pazzi chapel, it is as if an inspired giant had seized a pointed pencil of pietra serena and had impetuously scribbled, line upon line, over the walls. Brunelescho [sic] speeded up the Gothic,” he continued. By rounding off the point of the Gothic arch with a rush of concentric lines, he overcame the pause of the apex, tuned the energy of the vanishing point into a speed that rushes one on to the next arch. To stand before the west wall of San Lorenzo is to experience again the release marked by the pistol shot that sends one off on the hundred yards race after the tension of straining at the leash.5\n\nHe much preferred the steadying effect of the “hard red marble of Verona” which he credited as inspiration of sturdy elephantine decoration in the Tempio (illustrated overleaf).6 The hard red marble of Verona, not the “soft grey pietra serena” of quattrocento buildings in Florence would guide the aesthetic Stokes adopted in writing a trilogy devoted to the art of quattrocento Italy.7 Like Ruskin in Stones of Venice he would use this trilogy to emphasise the inspiration of art by the physical materials from which it is made. Unlike Ruskin and his praise of Gothic architecture, however, he would devote his trilogy to praise of the post-Gothic revival in quattrocento Venice, Rimini, and other towns in Italy of the classicism of ancient Greece and Rome. He was excited doing research for this trilogy. He was also “very cold” that winter. And he again suffered with paranoid fear, this time fear of being “poisoned” by “a disgusting German woman”.8 “I’ve had a terrible winter and my work has gone badly,” he told his Old Rugbeian friend, Rolf Gardiner. “I have a peculiar and lonely genius,” he added.\n\n44\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nElephantine decoration in the Tempio Actually, at the moment, I am not alone. Not knowing one’s own being yet, one fills in the waiting by helping others. So it was with my brother [Philip], so it is again now, an obligation taken on six months ago. I cannot break it, for my will is not sufficiently determined so as to excuse the causing of misery.9\n\nNot wanting to cause Osbert Sitwell misery, he kept him company after leaving Florence in February 1927 for Sicily. After staying there through March and April he perhaps spent more time with Sitwell in mainland Italy, and at the premiere in Paris on 7 June 1927 of the Ballets Russes production, Le pas d’acier. “I have never been so thrilled,” he told Pound after returning from Paris to Lower Stonehams where, encouraged by Pound, he continued “slogging away” at research he had by then begun into the life and achievements of Sigismondo Malatesta, research which he continued that July in Venice.10 Here he again stayed at the Casa dei tre Occhi; spent time with Pound and his mistress, Olga Rudge (pictured on p. 46);\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n45\n\nand wrote to Eddy telling him he had had “no affair” before or since leaving England but was nevertheless “fairly happy”.11 This was scarcely the case when, after taking his ailing brother, Geoffrey, to Rapallo, he returned to Lower Stonehams where he was described that August by an acquaintance, Kyrle Leng, as unsettling and insane.12 He was indeed evidently very unsettled by then having battled for some time with what he described as an inner daemon of fear. “I have never ceased to war with it, a war terribly acute these last miserable, unspeakably miserable, seven months,” he wrote overleaf from notes about quattrocento sculpture. [T]he latter months [fear] has issued forth with destruction every moment day and night leaving me only for moments that I may be drenched in bitterness, as for other moments in which I must make my choice between a state of bitterness and a state of insane, evil, worry.13\n\n“I’m completely undone—by England and my family. It’s like losing my memory. Lost all touch with reality. My own like a lot of horrible ghosts, and the light here,” he wrote wretchedly to Olga. “I am nearly insane with not getting on with my work yet I funk another lonely pilgrimage. Can’t stand being alone any more, for I have never had a companion of any sort,” he told her. My life has been spent in being with my family (they never see anybody, loathe everybody) and getting away from them. I have met very few people even casually. Perhaps you are a kindred spirit, perhaps you aren’t. At any rate I shall prize beyond words the chance sometime of getting to know you. Would you let me know where you are, and perhaps tolerate me in the same town sometime?14\n\nOlga invited him to stay near her in Venice. But he could not bring himself to go there. Anyway, he said, he had to stay home at Lower Stonehams to look after the family silver while Durham and Ethel were away and when they returned he was such “a nervous wreck” he had to be dosed up with strychnine and was too “cowardly” to leave.15\n\n46\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nOlga Rudge “In terrific hurry to pack as I am off to Italy tomorrow,” he wrote excitedly to Olga three weeks later from London. “I am going to Rapallo. I suppose Ezra, to whom remember me, will turn up there later? … I am taking a companion as I can’t stand being alone just yet.”16 His companion, Adrian “Curly” Kent—“a very tall, vague, bohemian\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n47\n\nfigure with wild hair”—had been at school with him at Rugby and had subsequently completed a year’s drawing and painting course at the Slade.17\n\nEzra Pound playing tennis\n\n48\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nNow, shortly after his twenty-fourth birthday, Curly arrived with Stokes on 25 September 1927 in Rapallo where they stayed at the Hotel Marsala near Ezra and Dorothy Pound’s flat in the same street. “Adrian seems all right. I think his trouble is philosophic thought a la Russe. He is very lively on the tennis court,” Pound soon after reported.18 “Apart from restorating [sic] himself playing tennis, and attempting to disentangle Adrian’s ideas of ‘significance’ and of the that which is incapable of schematic treatment, etc. at lunch, he has done nothing constructive,” Pound wrote again the following week referring more to himself than to Stokes.19 “Have just, I HOPE, prevented Adrian from buying a house, and thereby annihilating his income,” Pound announced a few days later.20 Instead of buying a house Stokes moved on 18 October with Curly into rented accommodation, the Villa Giuditta, next to a church, San Bartolomeo, in hills above Rapallo. Here, with Curly for company, and with books about Sigismondo sent him by Olga from Paris, all initially went well. After Curly left, however, Stokes became distraught. “Have been in a state of siege. It is almost impossible to break the silence of the evenings here. I screech like a peacock from time to time and also play two mouth organs at once,” he wrote unhappily in early December.21 His unhappiness was compounded by worries about his “pipe-man” friend about whom he had previously written to Eddy.22 Now, in connection seemingly with the suppression in 1926 of the Rif Rebellion against Spanish colonial rule in Morocco, the pipeman had been imprisoned there. Stokes sent him tobacco and tried, but failed, “to aid his escape”.23 Bereft both of this friend and of Curly, he persuaded Osbert Sitwell to keep him company at the Villa Giuditta and help pay the rent. Osbert was also miserable. A play he had written with Sacheverell, All at Sea, had opened and closed after three performances that November in London. Now, in Rapallo that December, he missed Sacheverell and did “a good bit of solitary howling” perhaps, he speculated, because of “some sort of nasty spiritual crisis combined with the first flush of old age”.24 He also seemed to Pound to be “very depressed by freddo” in early January 1928 when Stokes was apparently briefly away in Milan, and was perhaps also away when Osbert invited the writer, Ethel Mannin, to lunch at the Villa Giuditta.25 “On the appointed day I climbed the mule-track to the villa in a deluging rain. The water came cascading down over the cobbles in miniature waterfalls, and the tops of the ranges of the great hills were blotted out by swirls of low-hanging clouds,” she recalled.\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\nVilla Giuditta renamed Villa Bice The villa was foursquare and whitewashed, and stood behind a little whitewashed church, so close that there was no more than a cobbled alleyway between church and house. Below the villa a lovely valley grey-green with olive terraces went down to the sea. … The two predominant features of the tiny room into which the\n\n49\n\n50\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nItalian woman servant showed me were an oil-stove and a small table supporting a huge bowl of press-cuttings.26\n\nThe press cuttings might have pleased Stokes. Some were very positive. Having Osbert living with him, however, made him unhappy as did the presence of Durham and Ethel in Rapallo that winter. “I have had a terrible time and am fairly reduced. But all the encumbrances of my life, for long accumulating, are being swept up in these terrible months,” he wrote at the end of January.27 Then, in early February, the encumbrances were gone: Osbert left to join Sacheverell in San Remo; and, after being entertained to tea and lunch by Pound, Durham and Ethel also left Rapallo. Having longed for them to go, Stokes was miserable in their absence. “Noises now come hollow from the valley into this once-populated cottage. For I am alone here. Life seemed so solid but yesterday. Now my purposes are playing with the wintry boulders in the stream below,” he wrote. The strongholds of the mind vacate. Unreality looms larger and larger like an emptied drawer. The cold hand of a nightmare makes a pass, and lo! a dreadful case, the world is lost to me for ever! The endless winter of the Absolute has me. Why one thought rather than another, why that response, how can unreality stop. I choose nothing. Emotions are provoked by circumstance. Why do I have fear now and appetite later? What ever I feel, even if poignantly, I can suggest to myself that I might be feeling something else more worthy to be felt.28\n\nThe Absolute was no solution. Nor was the intellect with its habit of “smothering” life with “dead leaves of fear”. Nor was the “abstraction beauty”.29 “[We] give that [abstraction] as the cause for our pleasure in the landscape, whereas the cause lies in the need of the soul for externalization,” he wrote. Thus the origin of all abstractions. The feeling that the interest in an object is never confined to its particularity, is explained by conceiving that object as the particularization of some generality, or interesting abstraction. Abstraction, then, is due to the unexpressed, unexternalized soul which finds its medium of expression\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n51\n\nin particulars, regarding them essentially as the occasions of its expression.30\n\nWith this decision about the soul finding itself in its externalisation Stokes seemingly felt better. “Adrian to tea latish, recovered or nearly so from alien presences,” reported Pound.31 “Adrian’s friend out of jail in Africa,” he added before sending the following to Olga.32 The elegant elongated Stokes Constructed a wheel without spokes, He said: Simply you feel That the thing is a wheel From the image that it invokes.33\n\nThen Stokes was gone having “dumped several books, 4 Criterions, and the last botl of Osbert’s eyetalyan champagne, and 6 tennis balls”.34 From Rapallo, it seems, he travelled around Italy gathering material for his quattrocento trilogy. By June he was in Scandicci from where he was volunteered by D. H. Lawrence, who was living nearby, to take proofs of his novel, Lady Chatterley’s Lover, to his publisher in Florence. Stokes undertook this errand, reading the novel on the way and remained “very miserable”.35 Previously he had been buoyed up by news that his pipe-man friend had been released from jail in Morocco. But it turned out that he was still in jail. All he had been promised was a fair trial which could scarcely be guaranteed, Pound noted, “without some preliminary enquiry into the fax.”36 Stokes, however, was reasonably confident, while staying in northern Spain in early July, that he had secured the pipe-man’s release through bribing “his Spanish judges”.37 “No everything is wrong,” he nevertheless told Eddy, referring not to the pipe-man but to himself.38 Osbert was just about to complete a novel, The Man who Lost Himself, about a Stokes-like figure who was inspiring but mentally unwell. He had now replaced Stokes in his affections with another young man, David Horner. Much more upsetting for Stokes, however, was the fact that Curly had a girlfriend. “Adrian 1st reported to have left Venice for England—evidently dis- or pur-turbed by lady now occupying attention of Adrian 2nd,” noted Pound on 29 September.39\n\n52\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nNevertheless, on 16 October, the two Adrians were together again when they arrived in Rapallo, Stokes bearing what Pound described as an “opus about orl the bhloomink renaissance” consisting of four typed essays devoted to Sigismondo, the Tempio, and to four quattrocento artists, Pisanello, Pasti, Agostino, and Alberti.40 With these essays Stokes sought to illustrate his previously developed emphasis on “the need of the soul for externalization” to which he added that this is achieved through the “zest for life” becoming visible as an outward “thing complete in itself”.41 After the dark ages of inward-looking medieval mysticism, the outward-looking humanism of the early Italian Renaissance impelled men to “manifest” and “embody” their inner experience in objective physical form, he declared. Sigismondo was an “archetype” of this humanist impulsion or compulsion to harness inwardly given energy in the outward physical form of the Tempio, claimed Stokes. “Sigismondo personifies, his building proclaims a constriction upon energy … pent-up to instant manifestation … mass all at once like mountains in unbroken sunlight,” he added.42\n\nSigismondo’s Tempio in Rimini\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n53\n\n“Sigismondo was the best fighter of the day. Violent the life but not extravagant. Constriction is never released; the same with Quattro Cento art, particularly the Tempio,” Stokes continued. Mass all at once, projection of stone, these quarries the opportunity for the Quattro Cento to create, just as the large earth, the driving rain, the prolific sun give birth to the blossom and compact fruit. Consciousness of stone, of the material as such, so that the stone itself palpitates, the flower of it drawn out by men upon the surface, arabesque in low relief rooted still to the inner core. Sigismondo was compressed with will to be manifest, so too the old stones which he touched …43\n\nWhat a contrast this, declared Stokes, with modern artists looking inwards to “their personalities and intelligence” for inspiration in creating their art.44 “What quality is common to Sta. Sophia and the windows at Chartres, Mexican sculpture, a Persian bowl, Chinese carpets, Giotto’s frescoes at Padua, and the masterpieces of Poussin, Piero della Francesca, and Cézanne,” Clive Bell had asked in forging ideas influential on modern artists. The answer, proclaimed Bell, is that all the best works of art are imbued with the idea of “significant form” so that the resulting “forms and relations of forms … stir our aesthetic emotions”.45 “I remember when this fact became clear to me,” said Roger Fry, one of the then leading advocates of modern art. I came upon a picture by Chardin. It was a signboard painted to hang outside a druggist’s shop. It represented a number of glass retorts, a still, and various glass bottles, the furniture of a chemist’s laboratory of that time. You will admit that there was not much material for [Freudian] wish-fulfilment (unless the still suggested remote possibilities of alcohol). Well, it gave me a very intense and vivid sensation. Just the shape of those bottles and their mutual relations gave me the feeling of something immensely grand and impressive and the phrase that came into my mind was “This is just how I felt when I first saw Michael Angelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel.”46\n\nNo mention here of the physical materials of art inspiring its creation which Stokes emphasised in the four essays he now showed Pound.\n\n54\n\nA R T, P S Y C H OA N A LY S I S , A N D A D R I A N S TO K E S\n\nIn them he developed this emphasis in terms of the claim that the best quattrocento sculpture and architecture was inspired by the marble from which they are made to bring forth the sea and animal life it suggested as “incrustation” and “stone-blossom”. As illustration he cited low reliefs in the Tempio externalising a host of zodiacal figures and Roman deities—Diana and Saturn, for instance—as well as a “court of dolphins, maidens and infants” from the “centuries of watery weight” converting the lime droppings of once alive animals into limestone and marble.47 Like the power exercised over Sigismondo by his mistress, Isotta, the Tempio’s marble low relief of Diana shows her, said Stokes, “in an excess of hypnotic power” summoning “the yet remaining lords of the universe”, represented by other figures in the Tempio.\n\nTempio low reliefs Diana and Saturn, c.1456\n\nS I G I S M O N D O M A L AT E S TA A N D E Z R A P O U N D\n\n55\n\nThey hasten to enrich the element that sustains the human form to its greatest glory … Venus comes reborn out of the further sea into the new element, her chariot drawn … by two white swans. Trees stand upon the tallest waves that move in procession behind her. Doves descend to give her greeting and to inspect the open shell, her birthplace, that she flourishes. As she touches land she disappears. Infusion is complete. Nothing remains to the outer senses, all is music now, imperceptible to the ear, loud in the blood.48\n\nImpressed by this Pound declared Stokes, together with himself, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, and Wyndham Lewis as “the only writers of the day”.49 Stokes was excited by this. But he was also downhearted when, as before, Curly left him alone in Rapallo. In the absence of Curly he went to the cinema with another frequent visitor to Rapallo, W. B. Yeats. He was also entertained to tea and dinner with him by Pound. Then, at the end of November, he left Rapallo for London before returning to Italy, not to Rapallo but to nearby Genoa where he stayed close to the town’s railway station at the Hotel Aquila. “Do come in with Dorothy sometime if you feel like it, though I now feel rather nervous about Genoa as it is not turning out quite right and it would be awful if I have nothing to show you,” he told Pound from the Hotel Aquila, where Curly joined him.50 Then again Curly was gone, but soon after met up with Stokes in Paris. From there, it seems, they almost immediately left at the beginning of February 1929 for Venice where they found Olga staying at their hotel, the Pensione Seguso, near the house she had just bought at 252 Calle Querini. Soon, thanks to money from Durham, Stokes moved with Curly into “a really magnificent apartment” at the Casa dei tre Occhi, “the main room having one of the occhi [eyes] … at one end from which it runs back to windows at the other end almost on the lagoon, and getting all the sun”.51 Not only that, it was also “full of Titians and Tiepolos” exclaimed Evelyn Waugh after visiting Stokes there that spring.52 From the Casa dei tre Occhi (pictured overleaf) and with help from Pound’s librarian friend, Manlio Dazzi, Stokes did research both for Pound and for himself in Venice. He also used the findings of Dazzi’s art historian friend, Arnoldo Ferriguto, “a young Italian of the Fascist state”, Stokes called him, in deploring "
