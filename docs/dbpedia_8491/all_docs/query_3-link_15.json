        "text": "While the eyes of many artists glaze over at the mention of copyright, the explosion in use of visuals in communication means that artists creating those images need to be well-informed and well-represented in copyright issues. Mark Ferguson spoke with VISCOPYs new Chairman, Adelaide photographer Mark Fitz-Gerald, about the role of VISCOPY and the developing awareness amongst visual arts and craftspeople of the importance of copyright royalties.\n\nBrook breaks this argument down into sub categories: The rationale of the art history museum, The cabinet of curiosities, Evolution, Cultural evolution, Art as the source of memetic variation and The cultural museum.\n\nRecent auctions held by Christie's, Sotherby's and Deutscher-Menzies have clearly demonstrated that the market is now looking towards artists in their fifties and even younger. The relationship between artists and auction houses is here discussed with reference to artists Juan Davila, Charles Blackman, Imants Tillers, Mandy Martin, John Wolseley, Howard Arkley, Lloyd Rees, Emily Kngwarray, Lin Onus and groups Desart, Balgo Artists and Utopia Arts."
