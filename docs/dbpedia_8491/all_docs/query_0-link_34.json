        "text": "Archives such as photography, letters, invoices, interviews reveal sometimes the name of the materials used by the artists and this documentation could be consider as precious source of information for the conservation of modern and contemporary artworks. Unfortunately this cited name is sometimes only a trademark without any relation with the chemical composition of the paint or of the varnish. Then begins a long investigation with manufacturers to collect more information on the chemical composition of their products. These contacts are often fruitless for different reasons: the manufacturers fail to respond to the information request, the product and its data sheet are no longer available, the documentation contains too vague information or the mentioned trademark corresponds to a variety of products. The analyses of micro-samples from artworks are the only solution to have access to the chemical composition of the materials. For the characterization of the paint binder, the Py-GCMS is the most powerful analytical technique, especially when the sample is unique: no preparation is required and with the same pyrolysis temperature and chromatography parameters, as a screening method, it’s possible to identify many kind of paints: oils, alkyds, vinyls, acrylics, epoxy, urethane etc , some organic pigments and to detect additives in most cases present in trace quantities. The results improve the knowledge of artist’s practices but more significantly could inform us on the state of preservation of the artwork and they are important tools for the conservation treatments. The following case studies demonstrate sometimes the necessity of analyses to modulate what it can be read, hear or see. In this way, a photography showing Keith Haring preparing the paint for the mural at the Hopital Necker in Paris indicates the use of a paint named Pantex 1300®, a product for interior and exterior decoration. This paint is no longer produced in France and it’s possible to read on the can \"acrylic\". The analyses, from mural samples and from old Pantex 1300 cans, allow today to establish that it was a vinyl paint made with a PVAc copolymerised with a vinyl ester of fatty acid. For the conservation of the painting le bain turc (1973) by Phlippe Artias [1], his wife has been interviewed. She explained that her husband begun to use vinyl paint in the 1970’s and acrylic at the ends of this decade. She specified that he used Caparol®, a vinyl dispersion for decorative purposes. Analyses confirmed the presence of this vinyl paints but revealed that some colours are made with an acrylic paint: it seems that Artias experimented acrylic sooner. The copolymer identified, a styrene-acrylic, suggests that it refers also to a decorative paint. In the same manner, the son of Jurg Kreienbuhl explained that his father made his paints by mixing pigments to a product called Elotex 55 TW 25®. The technical data sheet detailed that it’s a homopolymer dispersion with two external plasticizers : dibutyle phtalate and tri-o-cresyl phosphate. The results obtained from samples of the painting Secteur d’Argenteuil(1965) [2], confirm the use of Elotex 55 TW 25® as binder for coloured layers but also for the varnish. They indicate that fifty years later both plasticizers are still presents in the binder, so the paint is still flexible. Thank to the analyses of micro-samples of various colors from Le Grand serpent (1976) de Bernard Bazille,[3], a concomitant use of acrylic and vinyl paints also has been demonstrated while the artist mentioned to the curator only the use of Flashe paints. For the yellow color, in the same analyse, the PVAc binder and the azo pigment (PY3) could be identified. By comparison with our older (1980’s) Flashe paints references conserved at the C2RMF[4] it’s possible to specify that the hue of the yellow sampled is probably Lemon Yellow and not Senegal ( PY1+PY3) or Gold (PY1) yellow. In all these examples, it is evident that collect reference materials allows us to have more accurate information that the ones available on archives (labels on tubes, catalogs or color chart). As a result, a series of paint samples (artist grade, household and industrial paints) from 1985 to nowadays is evolvingat the C2RMF (around 500 references) available in various amount from small samples (microscope slide) to original cans or tubes. Acknowledgements I would to thank Hélène Bluzat, Céline de Courlon, Emilie Faust and Will Shank for sharing the information they could collected through interviews of artists or their families, or by contacting artist foundation. The gathered information was valuable help in the interpretation of the analytical results and the knowledge development about these materials.
