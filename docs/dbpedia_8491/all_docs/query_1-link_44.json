        "text": "In 1923 Frank Rinder, the international Felton Adviser for the National Gallery of Victoria, discovered a painting titled The wave (La vague) at Barbizon House in London. The work, which belongs to a series of marine pictures by the French Realist painter Gustave Courbet, depicts a wave approaching a beach on a stormy day. In his letter to the Gallery, Rinder strongly recommended purchase: ‘Only once in a hundred times does even an eminent artist compass so dramatically elemental a pictorialisation of the sea. The waters of deep green convey a wonderful sense of volume and momentum, the churned foam, done with the palette knife, is arrestingly expressive, the ominously dark sky, with its break in the upper left section and elsewhere, is a broad and masterful generalisation.’ What struck Rinder was the extraordinary handling of paint in this work and the mood it creates. The palette knife, that flexible metal implement traditionally used to mix colours on the artist’s palette, had been used in this painting like a paint brush. Courbet smeared thick layers of paint across the canvas in a series of broken areas, emphasising the material quality of the pigment. The dark hues of the clouds, the heaving sea, and the distant boats, whose straining sails and tilting masts evince a strong wind, all suggest stormy conditions. As Rinder pointed out, it is a powerful image of the elemental force of nature, but also a work that draws attention to its own properties and which can therefore be considered a work of early modernism. This is not the only possible reading of this image, however. Courbet’s associations with prominent radical French writers, his involvement in the Paris Commune and imprisonment for his alleged role in the destruction of the Vendome Column have led to him being seen as an overtly political artist. This is a relatively straightforward claim with regard to his figurative works, many of which are overt forms of social critique; some commentators have also seen social and political meanings in his later landscapes and seascapes. Jules Antoine Castagnary in his catalogue essay for an 1882 retrospective of the artist’s work viewed the wave motif as carrying a meaning of political liberation at a time when ‘democracy was rising like a cresting wave’. More recently, the German art historian Klaus Herding has argued that the dissolving forms of Courbet’s wave paintings are part of an argument in favour of social equality in which ‘the sea … stood as a metaphor for the people’. But how legitimate is this socio-political reading of Courbet’s seascape paintings, particularly those that feature almost no human presence, such as The wave? In this essay I will seek to answer this question."
