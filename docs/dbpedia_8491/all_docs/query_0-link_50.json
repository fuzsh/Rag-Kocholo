That is when you need a professional written valuation document for one artwork or for an entire collection.\n\nContact us to see how we can assist you and ask for a free quote.\n\nClients such as the National Art School, the National Museum of Australia, the Manly Art Gallery and Museum, the Dubbo Regional Art Gallery, and numerous corporate and private clients have used our services to value and document their artworks.\n\nWe value Australian and international art, including oil paintings, works on paper, drawings, etchings, lithographs and other limited edition art prints, photographs and sculpture. Your insurance or market valuation document will include a full description of the artwork, colour photographs and of course the insurance values and / or market values, together with an explanatory report.\n\nTo learn about our valuations, visit our Services, and if you are thinking of selling or buying art, go to the Art Brokerage page.\n\nSee what our clients say about our services in the Testimonials page.\n\nSee also our latest art news or subscribe to our mailing list to get updates directly to your inbox.\n\nLIST OF AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS A – Z\n\nA\n\n– Ian Abdulla (1947-)\n\n– John Allcot (1888-1973)\n\n– Davida Allen (1951- )\n\n– Rick Amor (1948- )\n\n– Angry Penguins\n\n– Jean Appleton (1911-2003)\n\n– Suzanne Archer (1945-)\n\n– Howard Arkley (1951-1999)\n\n– Ian Armstrong (1923-2005)\n\n– Julian Ashton (1851-1930)\n\n– David Aspden (1936-2005)\n\n– J.
