        "text": "Sir Cedric Lockwood Morris, 9th Baronet (11 December 1889 – 8 February 1982) was a British artist, art teacher and plantsman. He was born in Swansea but worked mainly in East Anglia. As an artist he is best known for his portraits, flower paintings and landscapes.\n\nEarly life\n\nCedric Lockwood Morris was born on 11 December 1889 in Sketty, Swansea, the son of George Lockwood Morris, industrialist (ironfounder) and Wales rugby international, and his wife Wilhelmina (née Cory). He had two sisters – Muriel, who died in her teens, and Nancy (born in 1893). His mother had studied painting and was an accomplished needlewoman; on his father’s side he was descended from the first baronet Morris, whose sister Margaret married Noel Desenfans and helped him and his friend, Francis Bourgeois to build up the collection now housed in the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Cedric was sent away to be educated, at St Cyprian’s School, Eastbourne, and Charterhouse School in Godalming.\n\nHe failed the exams to enter the army as an officer, and at the age of 17 he set out on a steamship to Ontario, Canada, to work on a farm. After a succession of jobs, including as a dishwasher and bell boy in New York, he returned to South Wales, and then entered the Royal College of Music, London, to study singing. But he gave up singing for painting, and went to Paris, where from April 1914 he studied at the Academie Delacluse in Montparnasse before the interruption of World War I.\n\nDuring World War I he joined the Artists Rifles, but before embarking for France was declared medically unfit for action in consequence of the effects of a failed operation during his childhood. As an experienced horseman, however, he was allocated to the training of remounts at Lord Rosslyn’s stables at Theale, Berkshire. He worked in the company of Alfred Munnings, under Cecil Aldin. He was discharged from this when the army took over the Remounts in 1917.\n\nCornwall, Paris and London\n\nMorris went to Zennor in Cornwall, where he studied plants and painted water colours. There he became friendly with the painter Frances Hodgkins, whose portrait he painted. At the time of the Armistice with Germany in November 1918 he was in London, when he met the painter Arthur Lett-Haines. Morris and Lett Haines fell in love and began a life-time relationship, and shortly afterwards Morris moved in with Haines and his second wife, Aimee. The trio planned to go to America, but in the event Aimee Lett-Haines left on her own, and the two men moved to Cornwall. They converted a row of cottages at Newlyn into a larger house and stayed there until the end of 1920, when they moved to Paris.\n\nParis was their base for the next five years, when they travelled extensively in Europe. Morris also studied at the Academies Moderne and La Grande Chaumiere. Morris had successful exhibitions in London in 1924 and 1926, and later in that year they settled back in Britain.\n\nAfter staying with his sister Nancy Morris in Corfe Morris and Haines found a studio in London at Great Ormond Street to which they moved in 1927. Morris became a member of the London Artists Association and the Seven and Five Society, for which he was proposed by Winifred Nicholson and seconded by Ben Nicholson. He became especially friendly with the painter Christopher Wood, and renewed friendship with Frances Hodgkins. At the end of the 1920s Morris became involved with much commercial work designing textiles for Cresta Silks with Paul Nash and posters for Shell and B. P.\n\nCountry life\n\nMorris chose the country life to pursue his passion for horticulture. Early in 1929 Morris and his companion took the lease of Pound Farm, Higham, Suffolk, and in February 1930 they gave up the London studio.\n\nIn 1932 the owner of Pound Farm, who was for a while a student, died and left it to Morris. Morris had resigned from the Seven and Five Society in 1930 and he resigned from the London Artist’s Association in 1933. There were many visitors at Pound Farm, including Frances Hodgkins, Barbara Hepworth and John Skeaping. Joan Warburton who was a student described Pound Farm as a paradise, mainly because of the spectacular gardens which Morris developed. She was also impressed by their spectacular parties.\n\nMorris often went painting in his native South Wales, and in 1935 at the time of the Depression was moved by the plight of the people of South Wales Valleys. He initiated a major touring exhibition of Welsh art in 1935, and was a regular teacher at Mary Horsfall’s Art’s centre at Merthyr Tydfil. In 1935 he painted two large flower murals on board the liner Queen Mary. In late 1937 Morris and Haines joined the Hadleigh Labour Party after attending a meeting addressed by Professor Catlin.\n\nEast Anglian School of Painting and Drawing\n\nMorris and Lett-Haines opened the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing at Dedham in April 1937. Within a year they had 60 students. Lucian Freud was one of his most noted students.\n\nIn 1939 the building at Dedham was destroyed by fire (with several of Morris’s paintings also destroyed) to the conspicuous enjoyment of Alfred Munnings. By the end of the year the school was reestablished at Benton End. Benton End was a rambling ‘Suffolk Pink’ farmhouse on the outskirts of Hadleigh, set in three or 4 acres (16,000 m2) of orchard. In addition to running the school, Morris indulged his passion for plants. He grew about 1000 new Iris seedlings each year and opened the house to display his collection, and used to walk the fields and hedgerows searching for softer colour variants of poppies. Morris’s work as a horticulturalist resulted in a number of plants being names after him.\n\nMorris was intolerant of cruelty to animals and at Benton End had a running feud with a local gamekeeper who shot cats and dogs – until the latter tripped over his shotgun and shot himself.\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1947 the Morris baronetcy came to his father from a distant cousin three months before his death and Cedric Morris succeeded his father in the same year to become the 9th Baronet Morris. He became a lecturer at the Royal College of Art in 1950.\n\nFrom about 1975 Morris virtually gave up painting because of failing eyesight.\n\nHe died on 8 February 1982. His former pupil, Maggi Hambling visited him on the day before his death and afterwards drew a portrait of him. In 1984 the Tate Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of Morris’s work.\n\nHis grave in Hadleigh cemetery is marked by a Welsh slate headstone cut by Donald Simpson.\n\nHis painting style\n\nCedric Morris had a distinctive and often rather primitive post-Impressionist style, and painted portraits, landscapes and very decorative still lifes of flowers and birds.\n\nAs a portrait painter he produced notable studies of subjects such as Arthur Lett-Haines (1919; 1925; 1928), Anita Berry (1920), Hilaire Hiler (1920), John Banting (1923), Rupert Doone (ca. 1923), Mary Butts (1924), Barbara Hepworth (1931), Arthur Elton (1931), Rosamond Lehmann (1932), Audrey Debenham (1935), The Sisters [F.

He was often called ‘the father of the Newlyn School’.\n\nPersonal life\n\nForbes was born in Dublin, the son of Juliette de Guise Forbes, a French woman, and William Forbes, an English railway manager, who was later transferred to London. He had an older brother named William, who, like his father, was a railway manager; William worked for the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway.\n\nHe was married in the summer of 1889 to fellow painter Elizabeth Armstrong at Newlyn’s St Peters Church. Their first home was at the “Cliffs Castle” cottage, which overlooked the sea. They had a son named Alexander, nicknamed Alec. The couple had a home built for the family in Higher Faughan, Penzance. Elizabeth died in 1912.\n\nIn 1915, Forbes remarried friend and previous student Maudie Palmer, who had been “assistant, helper and friend to the whole Forbes family.” During World War I Forbes’ son Alec served under the Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry. Alec died on the battlefield in August, 1916.\n\nForbes died in Newlyn on 2 March 1947 at the age of 89.\n\nEducation\n\nSchooled at Dulwich College, he studied art under John Sparkes who later taught at South Kensington School of Art. His father then worked for the Luxembourg Railway and after a period of poor health Forbes was removed from Dulwich College and studied under private teachers in Brussels. This also afforded additional time to draw. After the end of the Franco-German War, the Forbes returned to London. Dulwich College professor John Sparkes helped influence William Forbes of his son’s artistic talent, Stanhope Forbes then attended Lambeth School of Art (now the City & Guilds of London Art School). By 1878 he attended the Royal Academy under Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir John Millais. Fellow students at the academy included Arthur Hacker, Henry Herbert La Thangue and Solomon J. Solomon. He participated in his first exhibition there.\n\nForbes returned to Ireland for a few months to visit Dr. Andrew Melville, family friend and Queen’s College professor. While there the men shared their appreciation of art and Forbes painted landscapes of the Galway area. He also received his first commission for a portrait. Back in London and at the age of 18, he received another commission for a portrait of a doctor’s daughter, Florence. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1879.\n\nHe then studied at the private atelier of Léon Bonnat in Clichy, Paris from 1880 to 1882. Henry Herbert La Thangue who also attended Dulwich College, Lambeth School of Art and the Royal Academy came to Paris, too, and studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. Arthur Hacker, a friend from the Royal Academy joined Forbes at Bonnat’s atelier. In 1881Forbes and La Thangue went to Cancale, Brittany and painted en plein air, like Jules Bastien-Lepage, which became a technique that Forbes used throughout his career.\n\nOf Brittany, Mrs. Lionel Birch wrote:\n\nIn that most beautiful and interesting portion of France, there seemed to be found everything that an artist could desire. Inhabited by a race of a distinct and marked type, wearing still the beautiful national costumes which had been handed down from bygone ages, and retaining the old language of their forefathers, each village followed religiously the old traditions which ordered the fashion of their dress and the conduct of their lives. Here was a country dear to all who love that which is old and quaint, time-honoured, and reminiscent of past ages.\n\nA painting made there, A Street in Brittany, was shown and well received at the 1882 Royal Academy exhibition and sold later that year to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. During an 1883 trip to Brittany, Forbes stayed at Quimperlé. His Breton Children in an Orchard – Quimperlé, was shown at the 1884 Royal Hibernian Academy. Two other works were made Fair Measures: a shop in Quimperlé and Preparations for the Market, Quimperlé; They were both shown at the Royal Academy in 1884. True to his degree of satisfaction, the Fair Measures painting was well-received and the Market painting was found to be too blue and shadowless. Since blue was the colour of the Breton costumes, Forbes decided that it might be useful to change locations for a broader range of subjects and colours.\n\nOther artists who were painting in Brittany at the time of his visits, and who Forbes may have met, were Norman Garstin, Nathaniel Hill, Joseph Malachy Kavanagh and Walter Osborne.\n\nCareer\n\nHaving completed his studies in France, Forbes returned to London and showed works he made in Brittany at the 1883 Royal Academy and Royal Hibernian Academy shows. In 1884 he moved to Newlyn in Cornwall, and soon became a leading figure in the growing colony of artists. Of this place, Forbes said:\n\nI had come from France and, wandering down into Cornwall, came one spring morning along that dusty road by which Newlyn is approached from Penzance. Little did I think that the cluster of grey-roofed houses which I saw before me against the hillside would be my home for many years. What lode-some of artistic metal the place contains I know not; but its effects were strongly felt in the studios of Paris and Antwerp particularly, by a number of young English painters studying there, who just about then, by some common impulse, seemed drawn towards this corner of their native land… There are plenty of names amongst them which are still, and I hope will long by, associated with Newlyn, and the beauty of this fair district, which charmed us from the first, has not lost its power, and holds us still.\n\nThe Slip was Forbes first painting made in Newlyn. The artist colony received national attention with the Royal Academy exhibition of Forbes works in 1885. Henry Tate bought The Health of the Bride, which is now at the Tate Gallery in London. The exhibition of A Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach also brought notoriety to Forbes and the artist colony. He was one of the founders of the New English Art Club (NEAC) in 1886.\n\nIn 1892 Forbes became an Associate of the Royal Academy. Forbes was the founding chairman and trustee of the Newlyn Art Gallery beginning in 1895.\n\nForbes and his wife founded the Newlyn Art School in 1899. It attracted students such as Ernest and Doris “Dod” Shaw, Frank Gascoigne Heath and Jill and Geoffrey Garnier. The Newlyn area had experienced an economic downturn as the result of failing fishing, mining and farming industries. The school helped to bring an economic resurgence to the area by encouraging individuals to vacation in the area and study and practise art.\n\nHis friends included Henry Herbert La Thangue, Blandford Fletcher and Charles E. Hannaford, who had also been a student. In Newlyn, Forbes tutored the landscape watercolourist Mabel Mary Spanton.\n\nFor a 1909 publish date, Forbes illustrated Mary Russell Mitford’s Sketches of English Life and Character. Some of the illustrations were Old Cronies, Bringing Home the Milk, and February Sunshine.\n\nIn 1910 Forbes was elected a Royal Academician. Forbes became a member of the St Ives Society of Artists in 1928. In 1933 he was made a Senior Royal Academician.\n\nWorks\n\nForbes generally painted genre scenes and landscapes en plein air.\n\nAfter a Day’s Work, made in 1907, provides a snapshot of life in a small village in Cornwall. In it a man, covered to protect himself from the rain, leads his horse through the wet streets, which bare the light and reflection from light from inside a house. “With superb skill, the soft light is reflected off the rain-soaked road.” A girl is held back from crossing the street by her mother until the man and his horse pass by.\n\nAlthough many of his paintings were en plein air, he also painted interior scenes and was adept at painting the “warm and charming” effects of lighting on a room and the people in it, such as The Lantern, made in 1897. More poignantly, Mrs. Lionel Birch writes of his style and particularly the painting The Health of the Bride: The painting depicts the “dominant note of his life’s message, his sense of sympathetic humanity. These people in their humble little parlour, are real and living. Intolerant of all shams and false sentiment, the painter has made himself one with the people he depicts; he has understood the humour which lies so close to tears.”\n\nOf Forbes’s works, Norman Garstin said: “he is a good unsentimental painter, his work has a sense of sincerity that appeals to everyone”.\n\nA partial list of his other works includes:\n\nStudy of a Fisherwoman, 1884, oil on canvas, Penlee House\n\nA Street in Newlyn, 1885, oil on canvas, Penlee House\n\nOff to the Fishing Grounds, 1886\n\nTheir Evershifting Home, 1886\n\nThe Sweet-stuff Shop, 1886\n\nThe Village Harmonic, 1888, multiple light sources, exhibited at Royal Academy\n\nPalmistry, 1888, won Calcutta Gold Medal\n\nThe Health of the Bride, 1889, purchased by Henry Tate.

His father was a clothes manufacturer, pacifist, socialist and leading member of the Leeds Arts Club. In 1925 the Heron family moved to West Cornwall where T M Heron took over the running of Crysede and four years later the family moved to Welwyn Garden City where Tom founded the firm Cresta Silks and was to become the original mind behind Utility Clothing during the war. It was here at his new school that Patrick Heron met his future wife Delia Reiss, daughter of Celia and Dick Reiss (R.L.Reiss, co-founder of Welwyn Garden City).\n\nBecoming a painter\n\nHe attended St. George’s School in Harpenden and on a school visit to the National Gallery, London in 1933 saw paintings by Paul Cézanne for the first time. He immediately began to paint in a Cézanne-influenced style. Shortly after this he was asked to make designs for Cresta Silks and continued to design for Cresta until 1951. When he was 17 he attended The Slade School of Art for two days a week, returning to the West Country to draw the landscape. In World War II he registered as a conscientious objector and worked as an agricultural labourer for three years, then at the Leach Pottery at St Ives in 1944–45, where he met Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and many other leading artists of the St Ives School. He had just seen Matisse’s The Red Studio, exhibited at the Redfern Gallery, London and soon after this completed what he later considered to be his first mature work, The Piano in 1943.\n\nEarly influences\n\nThe Georges Braque exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1946 deeply impressed him and he wrote an essay on Braque for The New English Weekly. Then up to 1953 he spent time in Europe visiting Paris, Provence and Italy. Heron visited Braque in his Paris studio and presented him with the New English Weekly article. His first one-man exhibition was at the Redfern Gallery in London in 1947. In 1953 he organised, wrote the catalogue and exhibited in Space in Colour, an exhibition of ten contemporary artists, at Hanover Gallery, London. Following this he exhibited twelve paintings at the Il Bienal di São Paulo, Brazil. The same year he began teaching at Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and continued there until 1956. In 1956 he saw, and praised highly the American Abstract Expressionists who showed their work for the first time in England at the Tate Gallery. He was inspired by this group of eight painters, their confidence and the large scale and flatness.\n\nA development towards abstraction had been evident in his paintings, for example, Square Leaves (1952) and Winter Harbour (1955) The effect on Heron of the New York City painters, together with his move to live at Eagles Nest, overlooking the cliffs at Zennor, that year was a pivotal point in the transformation into his now characteristic language of interlinking forms; his balancing of colour and space. Heron’s deepest influences were Braque, Matisse and Bonnard and he was connected first of all to the pure abstraction of European lineage, represented by Naum Gabo and Pierre Soulages.\n\n“Heron used that most rare and uncanny of gifts: the ability to invent an imagery that was unmistakenly his own, and yet which connects immediately with the natural world as we perceive it, and transforms our vision of it. Like those of his acknowledged masters, Braque, Matisse and Bonnard, his paintings are at once evocations and celebrations of the visible, discoveries of what he called ‘the reality of the eye’ “.\n\nHeron’s writing on art and art education\n\nPatrick Heron’s writing about art began when in 1945 he was invited by Philip Mairet, the editor of The New English Weekly to contribute to the journal. His first published article was on Ben Nicholson, followed by essays on Picasso, Klee, Cézanne and Braque. Two years later he became art critic of the New Statesman until 1950. He became London correspondent to Arts Digest, New York (later renamed Arts(NY)). The Changing Forms of Art, a selection of his criticism was published in 1955. A further selection of writings, edited by Mel Gooding, was published in 1998 to coincide with his Tate Gallery retrospective exhibition\n\nIn 1966, 1968 and 1970 he published a series of articles in Studio International questioning the perceived ascendancy of American artists. His final essay on the subject was in a closely worded article of some 14,000 words published over a period of three days in The Guardian in October 1974.\n\nHe defended the independence and autonomy of the English Art Schools, resisting their integration into the polytechnic system. The publication of his article ‘Murder of the art schools’ in The Guardian in 1971 precipitated an enormous correspondence over a period of six weeks. The article was reprinted in Patrick Heron on Art and Education, published by Bretton Hall Wakefield to coincide with presentation of Honorary Fellowship of Bretton Hall, University of Leeds and a one man show of gouaches.\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1947 Heron began a series of portraits of T.S.Eliot. The final cubist version, painted in 1949, was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 1966. His daughter Katharine was born early in 1947, followed by Susanna in 1949. The summer of 1947 was spent in St Ives (as were consecutive summers until 1956 when the family moved permanently from London to Cornwall) followed by his first London exhibition at Redfern Gallery in October Heron’s writings were admired by American art critic Clement Greenberg who sought him out in London in 1954. The friendship they formed eventually disintegrated when they disagreed as judges of the John Moores Prize Exhibition in 1965.\n\nIn April 1956 the family moved from London to Eagles Nest in west Cornwall, and in June he exhibited ‘Tachiste Garden Paintings’ at Redfern Gallery. The following year his first Stripe paintings were exhibited in a group exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, Metavisual Tachiste Abstract (exhibition title invented by Delia Heron).Towards the end of the next decade Alan Bowness wrote: “I can think of few more disconcerting pictures shown in England in the last twenty years than Patrick Heron’s striped paintings of 1957.”\n\n“Heron’s Garden Paintings of 1956 mark a singular achievement within British Art of the period. With these canvases Heron found a route towards abstraction, not of a given motif, but instead formed from the formal balance achieved between the visual reality of what he saw in the garden at Eagles Nest and the pictorial reality of what he painted. The resulting paintings were executed at a remove from an idea of a representational subject and so freed Heron to deal directly with a pictorial reality.\n\nIn 1958, he moved to Ben Nicholson’s former studio at Porthmeor, St Ives, and two years later he held his first exhibitions in New York at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery and at the newly arrived Waddington Galleries in London.”The American critical response was enthusiastic and perceptive. Dennison, in Arts (April 1960) was struck by the subtlety and richness of his colour and ….He was able to discern a crucial distinction ” Where Rothko arrives at an impersonal and yet lyrical grandeur, Heron develops a personal image….” ….For Stuart Preston of The New York Times, Heron was ‘ balancing [his specific, squarish shapes] in compositions of momentary equilibrium. Their state of suspended animation gives his pictures their extraordinary lightness despite the positive existence of his forms.’\n\nHe visited Australia in 1967 and 1973, exhibiting at the Bonython Gallery, Sydney. He delivered the Power lecture in Contemporary Art entitled The Shape of Colour. He wrote, “There is no shape that is not conveyed to you by colour, and there is no colour that can present itself to you without involving shape. If there is no shape then the colour would be right across your retina “.\n\nIn 1978 he delivered the William Doty Lectures in Fine Arts at University of Texas at Austin entitled ‘The Colour of Colour’ coinciding with a presentation of over thirty large canvases from the previous twelve years. This was the culmination of the ‘wobbly hard-edge’ period, works filled with intense fields of unadulterated colour and spatial brushwork “with an immediacy of sensational impact … only possible in the actual relation of spectator to painting”. On the same visit Patrick and Delia Heron were made honorary citizens of Texas by order of the Secretary of State.\n\nDelia died quite suddenly and unexpectedly at Eagles Nest in 1979. For some years Patrick was unable to paint. He returned to drawing and slowly a foundation for the later Garden paintings emerged (see ‘Red Garden Painting : 3–5 June 1985’ illustrated above, completed in time for the retrospective at the Barbican the same year).\n\nFrom 5 November 1989 to 28 February 1990, Heron was artist in residence at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. During this period he produced six large paintings and forty-six gouaches creating “…the final great breakout into the freely executed paintings inspired by his new acquaintance with theRoyal Botanic Gardens, Sydney and, once more, his abiding love, the garden at Eagles Nest.”\n\nIn 1994 his Exhibition “Big Paintings” was held at Camden Arts Centre. Heron’s largest and most ambitious paintings were 15–22 ft long.\n\n“One major change that came about in Heron’s painting as a result of his time in Sydney, was a greater awareness of the white primed canvas as a colour space in its own right. …the Sydney Garden Paintings gave Heron the licence to create works that were seemingly quickly wrought and sparsley painted – which even appear at first to be incomplete or negligent. Ones expectations of what should be are affronted. Nevertheless, this reaction belies a complexity that the artist worked through in his last paintings … and reached a highpoint … in 1998”.\n\n“His last paintings were full-on, risky, filled with bright squiggles, painterly flurries and cartoon doodles. They should have been chaotic and absurd, but they were instead open and vital, eye-rocking and beautiful. Heron’s retrospective was ravishing, and had the vitality of a much younger artist.”\n\nHe continued painting until the day before he died. He died peacefully at his home in Zennor, Cornwall, on 20 March 1999 at the age of 79. He was survived by both his daughters, Katharine Heron, now an architect, and Susanna Heron, a sculptor\n\nOn 24 May 2004, the Momart warehouse fire destroyed a number of Heron’s most important works.\n\nPatrick Heron’s paintings are in public collections worldwide.\n\nRetrospective exhibitions\n\nHe held retrospective exhibitions of his work at Wakefield City Art Gallery Hepworth Wakefield (Paintings and Drawings, 5 April – 3 May 1952), the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford in 1968, the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1972 and at the Barbican Art Gallery in 1985. A major retrospective exhibition of his work was held at Tate Britain in 1998 selected by David Sylvester.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nHeron won the Grand Prize at the John Moores Prize Exhibition in Liverpool in 1959 and the silver medal at the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1965. In 1978 Patrick and Delia Heron were made Honorary Citizens of Texas by Order of the Secretary of State. He was awarded an Hon. D.Litt. in 1982 by the University of Exeter and in 1986 an Hon. D.Litt.by the University of Kent at Canterbury, by Chancellor Jo Grimond whose portrait he had painted for The Scottish National Portrait Gallery. In 1987 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Royal College of Art and in 1989 he was made an honorary PhD, CNAA by Winchester School of Art, in 1992 an Honorary Fellow of RIBA and in 1996 an Honorary Fellow of Bretton Hall, University of Leeds. He turned down a Knighthood under Margaret Thatcher and declined to become an RA. He was a Trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1980–1987.\n\nPublic works and collaborations\n\nPatrick Heron made several Public Works, in 1992 he designed the coloured glass window for Tate St.Ives and in 1996 a site specific outdoor installation at Stag Place ‘Big Painting Sculpture’ in collaboration with his son in law Julian Feary of Feary and Heron Architects.\n\nWorks in public collections\n\nOver sixty seven paintings by Patrick heron are held in public collections in Britain.\n\nPaintings in Tate collection can be seen online at Tate Collection Online and at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nPublic collections (British)\n\nAberdeen Art Gallery; Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford; C.E.M.A., Belfast; Bristol City Art Gallery; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; Eliot College, University of Kent, Canterbury; National Museum of Wales, Cardiff; Bishop Otter College, Chichester; Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; Exeter Art Gallery; Cornwall House, Exeter University; Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal; Leeds City Art Gallery; Leicestershire Education Committee, Leicester; Arts Council of Great Britain, London; Barclays Bank Collection, London; British Broadcasting Corporation, London; British Council, London; British Museum, London; Contemporary Art Society, London; Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, London; National Portrait Gallery, London; Shell-Mex Limited, London; Peter Stuyvesant Foundation, London; Tate Gallery, London; Victoria & Albert Museum, London; Granada Television, Manchester; National Westminster Bank Contemporary Art Collection, Manchester; Manchester City Art Gallery (Rutherston Collection); Hatton Art Gallery, Newcastle University; Norwich Castle Museum; Oldham Art Gallery; Merton College, Oxford; Pembroke College, Oxford; New College, Oxford; St John’s College, Oxford; Nuffield College, Oxford; Plymouth City Art Gallery; Southampton Art Gallery; University of Stirling; Wakefield City Art Gallery; University of Warwick.

Portraits of the artist Patrick Heron can be found at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nBenjamin Lauder “Ben” Nicholson, OM (10 April 1894 – 6 February 1982) was a British painter of abstract compositions (sometimes in low relief), landscape and still-life.\n\nBackground and training\n\nBen Nicholson was born on 10 April 1894 in Denham, Buckinghamshire, the son of the painters Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde, and brother to the artist Nancy Nicholson, the architect Christopher Nicholson and to Anthony Nicholson. His maternal grandmother Barbara Pryde (née Lauder) was a niece of the famous artist brothers Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. The family moved to London in 1896. Nicholson was educated at Tyttenhangar Lodge Preparatory School, Seaford, at Heddon Court, Hampstead and then as a boarder at Gresham’s School, Holt, Norfolk. He trained as an artist in London at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1910–1914, where he was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Mark Gertler, and Edward Wadsworth.\n\nNicholson was married three times. His first marriage was to the painter Winifred Roberts; it took place on 5 November 1920 at St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church, London. Nicholson and Winifred had three children: a son, Jake, in June 1927; a daughter, Kate (who later also became a painter), in July 1929; and a son, Andrew, in September 1931. They were divorced in 1938. His second marriage was to fellow artist Barbara Hepworth on 17 November 1938 at Hampstead Register Office. Nicholson and Hepworth had triplets, two daughters, Sarah and Rachel, and a son, Simon, in 1934. They were divorced in 1951. The third and final marriage was to Felicitas Vogler, a German photographer. They married in July 1957 and divorced in 1977.\n\nLife and works\n\nHis first notable work was following a meeting with the playwright J. M. Barrie on holiday in Rustington, Sussex, in 1904. As a result of this meeting, Barrie used a drawing by Nicholson as the base for a poster for the play Peter Pan; his father William designed some of the sets and costumes.\n\nNicholson was exempted from World War I military service due to asthma. He travelled to New York in 1917 for an operation on his tonsils, then visited other American cities, returning to Britain in 1918. Before he returned, Nicholson’s mother died in July of influenza and his brother Anthony Nicholson was killed in action.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1933, he was married to the painter Winifred Nicholson and lived in London. After Nicholson’s first exhibition of figurative works in London in 1922, his work began to be influenced by Synthetic Cubism, and later by the primitive style of Rousseau. In 1926, he became chair of the Seven and Five Society.\n\nIn London, Nicholson met the sculptors Barbara Hepworth (to whom he was married from 1938 to 1951) and Henry Moore. On visits to Paris he met Mondrian, whose work in the neoplastic style was to influence him in an abstract direction, and Picasso, whose cubism would also find its way into his work. His gift, however, was the ability to incorporate these European trends into a new style that was recognizably his own. He first visited St Ives, Cornwall, in 1928 with his fellow painter Christopher Wood, where he met the fisherman and painter, Alfred Wallis. In Paris in 1933 he made his first wood relief, White Relief, which contained only right angles and circles. In 1937 he was one of the editors of Circle, an influential monograph on constructivism. He believed that abstract art should be enjoyed by the general public, as shown by the Nicholson Wall, a mural he created for the garden of Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey. In 1943 he joined the St. Ives Society of Artists. A retrospective exhibition of his work was shown at the Tate Gallery in London in 1955.\n\nNicholson married the photographer Felicitas Vogler in 1957 and moved to Castagnola, Switzerland, in 1958. In 1968 he received the British Order of Merit (OM). In 1971 he separated from Vogler and moved to Cambridge. In 1977 they divorced.\n\nNicholson’s last home was in Pilgrim’s Lane, Hampstead. He died there on 6 February 1982, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 12 February 1982.\n\nSome of Nicholson’s works can be seen at the Tate Gallery, Tate St Ives, Kettle’s Yard Art Gallery in Cambridge, and The Hepworth Wakefield. An auction record for this artist of $1,650,500 was set at Christie’s, New York, for Sept 53 (Balearic), an oil and pencil on canvas, on 1 November 2011. His painting Fiddle and Spanish Guitar, in oil and gravel on masonite, was sold for €3,313,000 by Christie’s in Paris on 27 September 2012.\n\nIvy Priaulx Rainier (3 February 1903 – 10 October 1986) was a South African-British composer. Although she lived most of her life in England and died in France, her compositional style was strongly influenced by the African music remembered from her childhood. She never adopted 12-tone or serial techniques, but her music shows a profound understanding of that musical language. She can be credited with the first truly athematic works composed in England. Her Cello Concerto was premiered by Jacqueline du Pré in 1964, and her Violin Concerto Due Canti e Finale was premiered by Yehudi Menuhin in 1977.\n\nBiography\n\nPriaulx Rainier was born in 1903 in Howick, Natal, South Africa, to a father of Huguenot descent and an English mother. One of her sisters was a cellist. She studied the violin at the South African College of Music in Cape Town after her family moved there when she was aged 10, but moved permanently to London at the age of 17, in 1920, when she took up a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). She studied there with Rowsby Woof and Sir John Blackwood McEwen. She taught at Badminton School, Bristol, and also played violin in a string quartet. She had encouragement as a composer from Arnold Bax, and studied with Nadia Boulanger during 1937 in Paris but considered herself essentially self-taught.\n\nEarly career\n\nPriaulx Rainer started composing in 1924 but little came from her pen until 1937, after a long period of recuperation following a serious car accident in 1935. Her first acknowledged work was Three Greek Epigrams for voice and piano. Her first mature work was the String Quartet No. 1 in C minor (1939). It was given a private performance in 1940 but not performed publicly until 1944, at the Wigmore Hall. It was recorded in 1949 by the Amadeus Quartet. The music was used for a ballet, Night Spell, performed by the José Limón company in the USA in 1951 and at Sadler’s Wells Ballet in 1957. She often used ostinato-like repetition and alternation in her works, often of a percussive character. These characteristics are apparent in the Viola Sonata and the Barbaric Dance Suite for piano (1949; premiered in November 1950 by Margaret Kitchin).There is also a Suite for clarinet and piano (1943), a Sinfonia da camera for strings (1947; commissioned by a close friend,Michael Tippett; premiered by Walter Goehr), and a Ballet Suite (1950). Her first large-scale work for voices was Orpheus Sonnets for soprano, baritone, chorus and orchestra.\n\nIn 1939 she was appointed a Professor of Composition at the RAM, where she remained until 1961. She was elected a Fellow in 1952. Her students included Nigel Butterley, Jeremy Dale Roberts, Rachel Cavalho and Christopher Small. She and Michael Tippett co-founded the St Ives September Festival, first presented in June 1953.\n\nOrchestral works\n\nThe first of Priaulx Rainier’s large orchestral works was Phalaphala (the word refers to an African chief’s ceremonial horn), first heard in 1961, celebrating Sir Adrian Boult’s tenth anniversary with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1960).\n\nPeter Pears and the Purcell Singers gave the first performance of Priaulx Rainier’s Requiem (1956; tenor and unaccompanied chorus) at the Aldeburgh Festival that year. It was set to the poem Requiem, written for her in 1938-1940 in Paris by David Gascoyne and dedicated to the future victims of war. Pears also commissioned Rainier’s Cycle for Declamation (1953) and The Bee Oracles (1970), a setting of Edith Sitwell’s poem The Bee-Keeper scored for tenor, flute, oboe, violin, cello and harpsichord. Pears first sang it publicly at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1970.\n\nThe oboe quartet Quanta was commissioned by William Glock, Head of Music at the BBC, and written for Janet Craxton and the London Oboe Quartet. The title comes from the Quantum Theory.\n\nThe Cello Concerto was written for a Prom Concert held on 3 September 1964 where it was introduced to the world by Jacqueline du Pré and the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Norman Del Mar (at the same concert, du Pré played Edward Elgar’s Cello Concerto with the same orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent, the year before she made her famous recording of it under Sir John Barbirolli.) It has been claimed that du Pré “loathed every second” of the Rainier concerto, “not only because of its idiom, but also because it was technically beyond her”.\n\nPriaulx Rainier’s largest work of that period was the orchestral suite Aequora Lunae, a continuous piece in seven sections, each one descriptive of one of the Moon’s seas. It was dedicated to Barbara Hepworth, whose acquaintance she made in the summer of 1949 when she stayed in St Ives, Cornwall, using a fisherman’s loft as a studio. She remained a close friend of Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. She claimed that only sculptors and architects fully understood her music. Another work premiered at a Prom Concert was Ploërmel (1973), an evocation of one her favourite places, Ploërmel in the North West of France, near the mouth of the River Loire. It uses an orchestra of winds and percussion, including timpani, tubular bells, hand-bells, antique cymbals, high and low gongs, xylophone and marimba.\n\nHer violin concerto, Due Canti e Finale, was commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin, who performed it at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Groves. Menuhin described Rainier as “having a musical imagination of a colour and variety scarcely to be believed”. On the other hand, after hearing her music, William Walton commented that she “must have barbed-wire underwear”. Concertante for Two Winds and Orchestra was written for and dedicated to Janet Craxton and Thea King and was premiered at the Proms in 1981.\n\nThere have been infrequent performances of Priaulx Rainier’s music as they are difficult for both performer and listener. Premieres of her music were not always adequate, reducing the chances of there being further performances. Her complete chamber music was recorded and broadcast by the BBC in 1976.\n\nLater life\n\nShe was awarded a Doctorate in Music (Honoris Causa) by the University of Cape Town in June 1982. She was also a passionate gardener and ecologist who helped design, and planted the exotic plants in, Barbara Hepworth’s Sculpture Garden in St Ives. Her last work, Wildlife Celebration, was commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin and performed in aid of Gerald Durrell’s Wildlife Conservation Trust.\n\nPriaulx Rainier died on 10 October 1986 at Besse-en-Chandesse in France, aged 83. The date was the 70th birthday of David Gascoyne, the poet to whose words she had written her Requiem of 1956.\n\nLegacy\n\nMost of her music manuscripts are now housed at the J. W. Jagger Library at the University of Cape Town.\n\nOn 28 March 1987 a concert in celebration of her life and work was held at Wigmore Hall. A pictorial biography, Come and Listen to the Stars Singing, written by June Opie, was published in 1988.\n\nHer centenary on 3 February 2003 was marked by a special program on Australia’s ABC Classic FM.\n\nHer “lost” early String Quartet (1922) was given its world premiere on 8 September 2004 at the Tate St.Ives Visual Music Week."
