Born in New Zealand in 1914, Nancy Borlase arrived in Australia in 1937 aged 22. She studied art at the Canterbury College School of Art in New Zealand and sculpture and painting at the East Sydney Technical College. A figurative and then abstract impressionist landscape and portrait painter, from 1951 to 1970 she was an active member of the Contemporary Art Society and later became an art critic for the 'Bulletin' and 'Sydney Morning Herald'. A trip to New York and Europe in 1956 and exposure to abstract expressionism influenced her work and in 1960 she held her first solo exhibition.
