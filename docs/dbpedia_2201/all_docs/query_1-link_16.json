        "text": "Volume is the main stylistic element to be considered when playing rock is. Typically, rock should be played at a much higher volume than other styles: the right hand keeps time on either hi hat or ride cymbal, the left hand plays a strong back beat on counts two and four, and the bass drum is played with a heel up technique. The hands usually keep more strict time while the bass drum rhythm can appropriately accompany the song or match what the bass player is playing. The loudest element of the set is typically the snare drum, which is often played as a rim shot. This means to aggressively play the drum head and the rim at the same time. While “rock” is an umbrella term referring to many styles and sub-genres, the techniques and general considerations mentioned above typically work for what is considered rock music."
