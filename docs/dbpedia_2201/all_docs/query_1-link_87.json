If you're really in that place, I was going to send you $100 so you could buy a brick of sticks.\n\nOriginally Posted by weezy\n\nI'm in the midst of trying to prove this to myself. I haven't broken a hickory stick through the shaft or shoulder in a long time, but I'm constantly finding my tips chipped. Those flat sides on the tip don't bounce right and makes for some pretty uneven feeling rolls. So, I'm giving oak a whirl.\n\nOriginally Posted by FlyByNight\n\nOut of every pair of drumsticks I've ever had, every single pair ends up splinting right in the middle.

If it's not up to snuff, I might just have to get used to nylon tips. I'm not really into the feel of nylon tipped sticks though.\n\nI don't feel that my ride really requires any brightness or definition, being an AA extra heavy, but I know what you mean.\n\nOriginally Posted by gdmoore28\n\nI've been using nylon tipped sticks since the 1970s. Occasionally I'll purchase a few pair of wood tipped sticks and use them a little, but I always go back to the nylon. I love the cymbal sound, pure and simple. The only damage my sticks ever display is caused by the hi hat cymbal offset. I've tried different seat types and every imaginable setting with the bottom cymbal tilt screw, but no matter what I try I always end up with the bottom cymbal extending about 1/4\" beyond the top cymbal when played with a stick. When used in the regular hi hat function, the two cymbal edges align perfectly.\n\nSo there's a good suggestion for a new invention: a hi hat seat that keeps both cymbals perfectly aligned no matter how the hi hat is used.\n\nGeeDeeEmm"
