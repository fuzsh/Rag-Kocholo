        "text": "Rim Shot Canyoneering Canyoning Caving\n\nIntroduction\n\nApproach\n\nPark at the Moab Rim Trailhead on Kane Creek Road.\n\nWalk down Kane Creek Rd past Moonflower and to the Mastadon trailhead. After finding the Mastadon pictographs, hike up Mastadon canyon. At the top of Mastadon head left/north and across the Moonflower drainage. Continue up the slickrock to the Juniper sitting at the entry rappel.\n\nAlt approach: as the KML shows, follow the Moab Rim trail up and around a large sandstone dome. Take a right onto the Moab Rim Safari route, then exit on slickrock, cross a sandy patch, and climb a weakness in the walls to the top of the Rimshot drainage.\n\nDescent\n\nThe upper half has three rappels:\n\nR1: 40ft anchored of a juniper tree.\n\nR2: 70ft anchored off a juniper tree.\n\nR3: 210ft from a bolt station on the slickrock floor. Note that a 200 foot rope will not reach. The long rappel is the highlight of the route, mostly free-hanging and spectacular.\n\nThe lower half also has 3 rappels:\n\nR4: 65ft off bolts\n\nR5: 95ft off a boulder\n\nR6: 80ft off bolts\n\nExit\n\nAfter the last rappel, continue down canyon 5 minutes to the road, then go right 5 minutes to the parking lot.\n\nRed tape\n\nBeta sites\n\nhttp://www.climb-utah.com/Moab/rimshot.htm\n\nNote: the beta on climb-utah is for the lower half only, 3 rappels, longest 95 feet.\n\nTrip reports and media"
