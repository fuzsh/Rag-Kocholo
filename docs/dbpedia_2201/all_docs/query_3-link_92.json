        "text": "Been a long time since I've posted anything... been very busy with band stuff and work, of course. Iraconji is going awesome, and we're about to celebrate the release of our debut album in October. And more recently, I joined another band called Flummox, so now I'm pulling double duty! Totally worth it.\n\nANYWAYS,\n\nA month or so ago, I traded one of my guitars for an Alesis DM5 drum module and a Roland 10KT kick drum trigger, for use in Iraconji. I utilize a lot of double bass, and a fair amount of blast beats, and the trigger just sounds awesome cutting through the guitarist's full stacks. We're pretty noisy.\n\nI'm still pretty new to utilizing a trigger (just one trigger on one kick drum, mind you). I've got it pretty dialed in to where I want it, I think, but I wanted to pick your brains about the subject.\n\nAnyone else here use a trigger? I have a feeling it's probably an unpopular opinion around here, but I want to ask anyway.\n\nIs there a strategic best spot to mount the trigger? I've had to do a lot of tweaking to eliminate crosstalk. I've got it about 95% eliminated, but once in a while the trigger will still be set off by other drum hits. I rimshot the snare a LOT, and sometimes that will set it off. If I play the higher toms a little hard, that will do it too. Like I said, I've done a lot of tweaking and I've been able to eliminate a lot of it, but I'm curious if there's any other tricks of the trigger trade.\n\nAlso, given my particular trigger, it has a foam cone as the sensor. Should that cone mush up against the head a little? A lot? Or should it just barely touch the head?\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention - I have the trigger mounted about 5 o'clock, near the beaters.\n\nAnd lastly - kick drum head tension. I would think that tightening the kick drum head a little would help in the trigger's function, but again, I want to get some opinions.\n\nSo, anyone else use triggers here? What do you use? And what are your tips and tricks?\n\nI've used pintech triggers for a while and then switched to axis ekits for my bass drum.I found that getting accurate triggering can be tricky for fast double bass for a few reasons.\n\nFirst problem I had was that I have a habit of keeping the beaters buried into the drum head when I'm not playing a note which an cause double triggers. Also, you need to have a tight drum head and I found that having the inside of the drum padded or filled with pillows or blankets helps a lot. Unfortunately, if you want to play without triggers your bass drum will sound awful.another hurdle is dialing in your module. You'll wat to have your settings just right. This can be a lot to overcome, but if you get it right a triggered kick can sound awesome , especially for heavier music genres.\n\nI'm taking a break from playing really heavy metal right now, so I'm not triggering live. The current band does a lot of recording and I record with mics and then take the recorded bass drum and use a kick to MIDI gate and trigger my bass drum after the fact.this has worked really well for me.\n\nI used triggers for years on my kicks because I did extremely fast and complex bass drum patterns in my old progressive metal bands. Mics just loose that tone and feeling vs triggers. I was just using ddrum triggers. I also had two bass drums and they were not low like yours. I found that my foot taping could set them off. I kept them around 2 o'clock on the right bass and 10 o'clock on the left bass drum. I also had them a hair tighter but not smashed on the head. The head it self was tighter to get quicker rebound but not horribly tight. As far as settings I didn't make them super sensitive because I am a heavier hitter.\n\nAwesome replies everyone! Just what I was hoping for. I'm going to quickly reply to some points.\n\nYes - I used triggers to cut through the mix and it in a thrash/death metal band where all guitar players (2 guitars and bass) all play full stacks, the triggered kick cuts through the mix perfectly and it sounds awesome.\n\nI have band practice here in an hour or so, and I'll adjust my kick drum head a little bit tighter and see how it goes.\n\nWhen we are playing punishing tempos, I tend to rest the beaters on the head (usually the left one), but I have my module threshold set just right to where it doesn't cause double hits. I like it this way, honestly, because I do have a habit of resting the beaters down, haha. It aids in my personal comfort and keeps me right on top of bring the left foot into the action. Also, tapping the head lightly with the beaters doesn't set it off either - I still need to play with moderate force, and I'd like to keep it this way. This will keep me from \"cheating\", and of course, cuts way down on crosstalk.\n\nNewTricks - cool setup! I have a Pearl traveller kit that still has the mesh heads... now I'm wondering if I can turn that into an experiment.\n\nNow, when we recorded our album, I didn't have the trigger setup yet. The kicks were \"triggered\" in post-production, rather than in the signal directly. The kick was mic'd like normal, but replaced later on. But now that I'm using an actual trigger, it's consistent with the album material - and it sounds awesome regardless!\n\nThanks for the replies, everyone. Anyone else have trigger experiences to share?\n\nBack in the early 90's in Houston Texas I met Terry Bozzio at his clinic at the \"Drum & Keyboard Shop\" . He was using REMO drums back then . Anyway..back when he was playing with \"Missing Persons\" he was using an all electronic kit with his own custom set and samples . I was really big on the electronic stuff and triggering my own acoustic kit (also a REMO set) . So I got to spend a whole hour with Terry alone along with \"Texas\" Tim Root talking about his electronic stuff and his custom kit . Terry and Tim had partnered and had developed the Cooper \"Treasure Chest\" module which was basically a sample module . But it was strictly for drums and it came loaded with custom 12 bit samples of drums and you could buy ..discs (yea as in floppy) with more samples . Anyway Tim Root (he works for Roland now . He's the big wig for V-Drum development) gave me the best advise there was for triggering . What he told me to do was to mount the trigger to the inside of the shell with the side just touching the head . Now keep in mind that back then most of us made our own triggers . You would go to the Radio Shack and buy a bunch of piezo buzzers , pop the back off of them and solder some longer leads . So..the trick to the shell mount was that you used thick double sided tape , the kind made out of foam . This would cushion the trigger from the shell vibrations so it wouldn't trigger if you hit the shell or when you laid into your toms . And since it wasn't on the head it wouldn't double trigger either . You had to play with the velocity settings and such but you had to do the pretty much with any trigger module . This worked perfect ! I was using a K.A.T. \"Midi Kitty\" pad/trigger to midi converter into a Proteus \"Procussion\" drum sample module . I was deep into the electronic stuff so I had dove into that module and messed with the waveforms and came up with my own sounds . What we did was tuned the sampled drums from the module to my acoustic drums and layer them through the house mix . It was genius ! The sound out front was so clear and BIG . Worked perfectly every time thanks to Terry's and Tim's advice !\n\nMan I could go on with this ..but I won't . These days I have simplified my setup to a Roland SPD-S sample pad and a powered floor monitor ."
