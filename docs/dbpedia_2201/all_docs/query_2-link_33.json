Is there a proper term for either one to differentiate between the two?\n\nA rimshot is just a accent from the regular head. It gives you a louder crack when you hit the rim and head. The \"ba-dum CHING\" are just regular hits (I guess?) where you hit only on the drum head itself. Just another tool to your toolbox of sounds.\n\nThe joke thing isn't a rimshot. The first definition is the correct one, hitting head and rim.\n\nRIM SHOT is the only term I know but I have heard another but can't remember what it is.\n\nI've always wondered this myself.\n\nLike when someone writes a joke like:\n\n\"What's brown and sticky? A stick (rimshot).\"\n\n\"BA DOOMP CHING\" isn't actually a rimshot. A rimshot is a \"CRACK\"."
