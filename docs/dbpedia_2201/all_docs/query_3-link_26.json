        "text": "Drums respond very differently depending on where you hit them, how hard you hit them, what you hit them with, and so on. They're very dynamic instruments in every sense of the word. So I think the short answer is just that. If the drummer does something different, the drum will sound different.\n\nWhy specifically is there a difference with your rimshots? Well, I think the general consensus is that rimshots give you more attack and woody pop but less body. So perhaps the \"doofy\" sound you're referring to is just the darker tone that you get with more body and less attack. From the images, it appears the rimshot has a lot more midrange energy. Beyond that, I can't give you a detailed breakdown of the physics involved.\n\nI would be cautious about taking those snapshots from the frequency analyzer too seriously.\n\nAre each of those pictures truly representative of all the strokes of that type?\n\nThe difference may have been exagerated by processing. Are these frequency spectrums of the raw tracks or have these post EQ and/or compression?\n\nThe resolution in the low end is iffy and the bottom ends look almost identical except for the peaks. Look at the down slopes on the left side. Almost identical.\n\nThese 2 hits are clearly at very different dynamics so it's not really a fair comparision. I can see there is WAY more energy in the rimshot -- at least 2dB across the board and as much as 5dB in the mids and low mids. Cumulatively across the whole spectrum, that's a huge difference! So it's hard to know without doing a controlled experiment how much of the difference in timbre is attributable to the different technique vs the dynamics. In the commerical track you reference, the snare at 1:08 is being played more softly than the usual backbeats in the surrounding sections, so it's a similar situation.\n\nFinally, gotta say, why would you EQ out that sound? I didn't hear your \"doofy\" snare sound, but I like the \"doofy\" sound in the referenced track. I wouldn't EQ that out in an effort to make non-rimshots sound like rimshots. Generally, I wouldn't EQ out frequencies unless they're actually problematic.\n\nSnare wires too tight.\n\nThat seems to be the strongest contributor here.\n\nMy initial assumption is that it was most likely related to the relative tunings of the batter and resonant heads. I did an experiment where I tried 9 or so different tunings on the same drum, recorded them, and analyzed them, but I could find no pattern.\n\nEventually, I realized that I get more consistency between taps and shots with loose snare wires. Tightening your snare wires too much chokes the resonance of the drum, this is pretty well known. But it seems that this dampening effect can be non-constant with velocity. So, it is possible to get a tuning where the fundamental can speak fairly loudly at low volumes, but gets choked at higher velocities (i.e. rim shots.)\n\nYou engineer your rim shots to sound good, but then the taps are super \"doofy\" by comparison. You're stuck wondering why the taps are so doofy, when the problem is really that the rim shots are not doofy enough!\n\nThe tuning that gave me problems was a tom-like tuning with snares pulled too tight. Wet, yes, but only for taps."
