Traditionally \"rim shot\" means hitting the head and the rim at the same time -- it's generally hit hard, for example when you're hitting backbeats on 2+4 in a rock tune. Is that what you're talking about here?\n\nForgive me if I am using terms wrong, I was referring to just hitting the rim only with a normal grip, as opposed to holding the heel of the stick against the inside edge of the drum with an overhand grip and closing your hand downward.\n\nPlease let me know if I am using the wrong terms.\n\nThanks all for the help.\n\nNewbie, question.\n\nIs there some theory on when to use crosstick and when to rim- shot?\n\nIm trying to play a Bossa beat and both sound ok, (ok, for me, lol).\n\nI prefer to use the rim shot so I can add some little fills here and there and occasionally hit the HH on the 1.\n\nIs there any reason to use one over the other?

The “crosstick” (also rim click or side stick), as noted above, is the standard bossa nova or RandB ballad or “clock beat” sound (ala Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones). It can be played soft or louder depending on the context. In Bossa it is played more subdued. The “rim shot” (stick hitting head and rim together, normal playing position) is for strong backbeats and dramatic moments. There is also the “stick shot” which can sometimes be substituted for a rim shot. This is the one where you place the tip of the stick on the head while holding the stick butt above the drum (normal position) and then strike that stick with the other. I’m reiterating and rephrasing what has already been said.\n\nForgive me if I am using terms wrong, I was referring to just hitting the rim only with a normal grip, as opposed to holding the heel of the stick against the inside edge of the drum with an overhand grip and closing your hand downward.\n\nPlease let me know if I am using the wrong terms.\n\nThanks all for the help.\n\nThanks for the clarification! That's generally referred to as a \"rim click\" or \"playing on the rim\". It's a thinner sound than the \"cross-stick\" sound, so it's not the \"authentic\" sound for bossa nova (or rock ballads, e.g. \"Color My World\" by Chicago or \"Tennessee Whiskey\" by Chris Stapleton), but if it works for you, then it's fine to use. There's not really _rules_ about when to use one or the other, but if you're playing with a bandleader, there's a strong chance they'll be \"expecting\" you to use the standard cross-stick, so I'd definitely be comfortable performing it that way, even if you don't play that way when you're \"in charge\"\n\nYeah, Im not good enough to switch from a French Grip to crosstick\n\nok no reason to alter grip.\n\nCrossStick= butt end out\n\nLift stick from snare move to toms cymbals whereever;\n\nMove back to snare when time comes.\n\nthere's no grip switching; butt end out matched\n\nThis isn't exact what I mean but you see the (no-grip switch) mobility possibility\n\nNot exact but you see. In this Q-Tip video...Not exact-because there's no \"fills\" but mobility from Cross-stick to other drums requires no grip alter"
