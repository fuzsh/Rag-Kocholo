        "text": "Before the late 1960s, a rim job was almost exclusively the domain of automotive mechanics: the work of putting new rims onto a car’s wheels. With the rise of the adult film industry in the late 1960–70s, rim job entered the public discourse as an informal term for anilingus.\n\nThat more technical word for rim job, anilingus, is recorded in an 1899 translation of Psychopathia Sexualis, a German encyclopedia of sexual terms. Rim job is evidenced by 1970, based on job for “sex act” (e.g., blowjob for oral stimulation of the penis). The rim apparently refers to the shape of the anus—a kind of ring of muscle that acts as the “rim” around the hole.\n\nRim job isn’t for polite conversation, as it is an intimate sex act.\n\nThat said, rim jobs is often the source of unintentional (or intentional) humor, especially when making puns on automative rims. Actually, all types of rims are fair game for cheap rim shots."
