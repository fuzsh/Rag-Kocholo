        "text": "I'm sure that most of you know that writing out music is very time consuming, whether you're spending 20 minutes on drawing your staff neatly for your notes to sit on, or constantly erasing notes on Finale because your mouse slipped by a centimeter and placed a Snare Drum buzz roll instead of a rim shot.\n\nOver the years of composing marching percussion music, I've developed another method of composing music that may prove useful to composers with limited time. Because this is so different in comparison to the notation that has always been used throughout the history of music, this probably won't gain any popularity at all among percussion composers. But I guess this is worth a shot, since it works for me, and might work for you. So let me begin presenting to you what I call the \"Alphabet Notation\" for rhythm or percussion.\n\nThis is what one measure of rest looks like:\n\n/ [ . . . . ] [ . . . . ] [ . . . . ] [ . . . . ] /\n\n/ = measure bar\n\n[] = one count\n\n. = 16th subdivision of a measure\n\nA note's value is determined by the number of \".\" subdivisions that follow it (A 1/16th note having no following subdivisions, an 1/8th note having one following subdivision, and a 1/4 note having 3).\n\nKeep in mind that one count can fit four 16th notes in it.\n\nThe classic \"Eights\" warm-up would look like this:\n\nTD (4/4) / [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] / [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] / And so on...\n\nBD (4/4) / [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] [ 1 . 1 . ] / [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] [ 2 . 2 . ] / And so on...\n\nSD (4/4) / [ R . R . ] [ R . R . ] [ R . R . ] [ R . R . ] / [ L . L . ] [ L . L . ] [ L . L . ] [ L . L . ] / And so on...\n\nFor tenor and bassline, notes are represented by numbers corresponding to drum size.\n\ns = Spock Drum 1\n\nS = Spock Drum 2\n\n5 = Bass 5\n\nX = rimshot\n\nx = stick click\n\nr = on the rim\n\nFor snareline:\n\nR/L = right or left hand for each note\n\nRr/Ll = flam notes\n\nRz/Lz = buzzed notes\n\nX = rimshot\n\nx = stick click\n\nr = on the rim\n\nTremolo is tricky, but hear me out. As most of you know, a tremolo line divides the notes value by two and fills the original value with notes of the new value. (A 1/4 note with a tremolo sounds like two eight notes; an 1/8th note with a tremolo sounds like two 16th notes.) In alphabet notation, consider this and maintain the count's value of four 16th subdivisions. When adding tremolo lines in this notation, you need to cancel out the subdivisions that the sound of the tremolo note goes over in that count. For example:\n\n(4/4) / [ R . L . ] [ R . L . ] [ R, L, ] [ R, L, ] //\n\nThe first two counts are normal. But on counts three and four, you can see that I didn't include the second and fourth subdivisions on that count. That's because with the \",\" tremolo line, the eight note's value doubles into the next subdivision. Applying this concept may become increasingly difficult with drags on 16th notes, thus creating 32nd notes.\n\nTo put it somewhat simple, you eliminate the \".\" subdivision that is played over with the preceding tremolo note.\n\nTwo tremolo lines indicate a double stroke roll, which is basically 32nd notes filling the value of the original note. When placing two tremolo lines on a \"[ R . . . ]\" quarter note, you would write [ R,, ] since the entire count is played through, leaving no room for \".\" subdivisions. When placing two tremolo lines on \"[ R . R .]\" one of two 1/8th notes, you would write [R,, R . ] since the roll fills the 1/8th note value, leaving no room for the subdivision after the \"R.\"\n\nMoving on, triplet figures indicated by underlining. For example,\n\n(4/4) / [ R L R L R L ] [ R . R L L ] [[ R Rl Rl ]] / [ R L R ] [ L R L ] [ R . . . ] [ R L L ] / [ R . . . ] [ . . . . ] [ . . . . ] [ . . . . ] //\n\n**Envision the bracket topped with a \"3\" that indicates a triplet figure in traditional notation.**\n\nThe first count in the first measure presents a sextuplet figure, while the second count presents an regular 1/8th note followed by a triplet figure of 1/8th notes. For figures that last more than one count, you can combine the count brackets like I did in the first measure. It presents a triplet figure of quarter notes in the third and fourth counts. And in the second measure, the first, second and fourth counts present 1/8th note triplet figures, with a regular quarter note on the third count.\n\nTime signature in boldface preceding the first measure. Dynamics can be placed before the count in which it should be expressed in italics or cursive. Crescendos/Decrescendos between counts.\n\nFor example:\n\nTD (4/4) / f [ 1 . 2 2 ] [ 3 . 4 . ] [ 3, 2, ] [ 1, S . ] / [ 1 1 1, ] > [ 2 2 2, ] > [ 3 3 3, ] > [ 4 4 4, ] > / p [ 4 . 4 4 ] [ . 4 4 . ] [ 4 . . . ] [ . . . . ] //\n\n>/< = crescendo or decrescendo\n\nAnd Accents indicated by bold faced notes.\n\nI'm sure most of you understand that one count consists of 4 16th subdivisions. That's basically what this notation is based on. There are no rests, you're pretty much looking at the subdivisions for each count and plugging in the notes from there. I believe this can make music translatable through keyboard without needing a special program. And when writing music by hand, this can safe the time-consuming preparations, like drawing the 5-line staff.\n\nAnd this is new, so of course, there's tons of room for evolution if Alphabet Notation turns out useful to anyone else."
