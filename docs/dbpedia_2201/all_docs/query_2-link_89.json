I don't think in the way I play , I could use a wood rim on the snare. I would destroy it. I can see the merit in wood rims on toms, but just wanted to get some opinoins. They look cool though.\n\nI used to bust the lugs on my old Pearl snare in the 7:00 spot from rim shots and overtightening.\n\nMy Ayotte snare has wood hoops. Along with easing up a bit (joint/arm damage is far worse than a busted hoop), I'm also very particular to rotate the snare a tick each time I set it up so I spread the force around. I also rotate the hoop when I change the head.\n\nThe Yamaha-style wood hoops are fairly easy to get, are rather inexpensive, and should fit most makes. The rim shot difference is quite dramatic, and I enjoy having wood hoops on one of my snares. As far as the toms go, though, I'm sticking with regular steel/aluminum flanged hoops. I don't rimshot my toms on purpose.\n\nAlternately, Yamaha was also selling a percussion accessory called a Russ Miller Groove Wedge (or Groove Block?). It basically was a section of a wood hoop you could install onto a drum similar to how RIMS (Gauger) mounts work.\n\nI wouldn't use Corpsmaster sticks on them, but I've had this snare for about two years without trouble."
