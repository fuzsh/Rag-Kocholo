        "text": ">>A rimshot is the sound produced by hitting the rim and the head of a drum at once, with a drum stick. Rimshots are usually played to produce a more accented note, and are typically played loudly.\n\nThere are two standard types of rimshots in marching percussion. The first, more common shot is called a „ping shot“. In a ping shot, a drum stick hits the head and the rim at the same time, with the bead very close to the rim. This produces a high pitched sound. The other, called a „gock„, is produced by putting the bead of the drum stick close to the center, the rim making contact closer to the hand than in a ping. This makes a lower sound.\n\nIn orchestral percussion, a rimshot is performed by placing one drum stick with the stick head near the middle of the drumhead, and the shaft pressed against the rim, and striking with the other stick. This produces a less powerful, but more precise and accurate rimshot than its marching cousin. This method is known as a „stick shot„.<<\n\nWikipedia"
