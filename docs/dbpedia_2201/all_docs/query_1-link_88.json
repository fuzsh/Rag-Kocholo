        "text": "So I actually found this book to be very disappointing for the purpose of notation.\n\nThere are detailed descriptions of a good range of percussion instruments, including photos, but the author does not give notation details for each (only a few instruments, sporadically).\n\nI was expecting a reference like this to show examples of all of the basic techniques with the common notations for each of these instruments in each of their respective entries.\n\nTake bongos for example. If you want to notate music for bongos, you should start with its common appearance on a staff and examples of its common articulations shown in notation.\n\nHere we don't get that. We get a picture and a paragraph description.\n\nScouring around for \"bongos\" will get you examples of bongos used in kits, where the composer will assign any space or ledger to the drums.\n\nAnother example. Snare drum.\n\nNowhere in the book does it actually present common usage of cross-stick, rim, rimshot notation (circled X, X, and slashed notehead respectively). It does suggest that rimshot is written often written with \"R.S.\" but I've never even seen that used once.\n\nLater on the book has an emaciated legend for drum kit.\n\nIt is missing 3 toms, any snare variations, multiple cymbals and puts the ride on the wrong note (ledger line A instead of top F).\n\nSomewhere else in the book it suggests beater changes are notated with notehead changes, (which certainly you can if you want to) but it makes no mention of the most common score indicators which is just a text directive (usu. \"w/hard mallets,\" \"hard mallets\" or \"to hard mallets\").\n\nThat misses the major elements needed.\n\nWhat are we missing? We need two things here.\n\n1) To start with how the instrument appears on the staff if it is the default instrument (i.e. what note on the staff = what drum)\n\n2) Standardized notation of the most common articulations for that instrument (i.e. hits, finger taps, slaps, center palm, w/sticks etc.)\n\nNow, *some* of these things show up for *some* of these instruments, but in unpredictable places around the book, making this a slipshod reference book given the methodology.\n\nYes, I'm trying to start with the perspective of one stave : one instrument (or in the case of obvious sets like bongos, temple blocks etc. each being one stave).\n\nI have a preference towards using different notehead types, rather than lettering above/below, so if there is no real \"consensus\" for hand drum notation what I will do is make my own legend and try to be as consistent as possible retaining a sound : icon correlation.\n\nDefinitely + and o for mute and open.\n\nNow, what is the standard notation for a dead stroke? I couldn't find one but saw both staccato and tenuto being used. Also, for that matter, what is a proper dead stroke? I've seen demonstrations (on snare) where it is treated as a press mute, and another where it was played as a one-handed fading buzz roll.\n\nNow for ghost notes, the most common I have seen are in () or small noteheads.\n\nX's on drum kit I see as rim (rim click, not to be confused with rimshot).\n\nAs for style improvisation, my first priority in the percussion maps here is for mock-up programming, so everything is either meticulously notated, or I am playing it in.\n\nI just want to keep things coherent between libraries so that I'm not using any old symbol for similar techniques, with hopefully having the added benefit that it would be well organized enough for actual percussionists to interpret if need be.\n\nSo I actually found this book to be very disappointing for the purpose of notation.\n\nThere are detailed descriptions of a good range of percussion instruments, including photos, but the author does not give notation details for each (only a few instruments, sporadically).\n\nI was expecting a reference like this to show examples of all of the basic techniques with the common notations for each of these instruments in each of their respective entries.\n\nTake bongos for example.

I felt terribly guilty when I received this notification considering I recommended this book. But going through your criticism, with the book in hand, I realised (and please don't take offense) you're reading it wrong... If what you wanted was a quick reference guide, I'm sure I can find a PDF somewhere in my computer which I will post here. I thought you wanted a detailed explanation of every aspect of percussion, in that case this marvelous book has you covered!\n\nI refer you to the index and chapter 3, this will explain everything about notation, good practice and things to avoid. Furthermore, appendix C covers extended techniques. Specifically bongos, page 56. You really need to give it a once over to get the general idea, but I have never encountered a better book about all percussion practices in 30 years of composing professionally...\n\nOh dear!

I wasn't saying it was useless, but just that presentation system was not good for the specific kind of reference I am looking for. I quite like the book and will look into it more about general creative outlook on those instruments. At one point it mentions roto-toms as being the upper range of the timpani family and I thought that really made sense and gave me some ideas to make more continuity between them.\n\n... I was asking for a reference to notation, something that would effectively be a metastudy....\n\nThis is a fascinating topic. Not to derail the thread, but have you (or anyone else) come across a meta system of articulations for orchestral instruments?\n\nFor example, I find the articulation terms and systems used for strings are all over the place. Some people use French terms, others use Italian. Some mix them up based on colloquial usage, others insist the actual articulations are different based on the fact there's a French and an Italian term for it in common day to day usage. Sautille vs Saltando? And so on... It's a nightmare.\n\nI have a ~70 year old book on violin techniques that attempts to set up a classification of string articulations, but would appreciate it if you came across anything modern and comprehensive... Cheers!"
