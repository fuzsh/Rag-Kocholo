I also can’t not bury the beater, but that’s a topic for a different thread.\n\nI tend to rimshot for about 90% of the gigs I do, but tonight I seemed to gravitate towards no rimshot back beats for almost all the gig. They sounded really full and seemed to balance well with the sound of the rest of the kit and the band in general. Sometimes rimshots can be quite sharp sounding.\n\nJust wondering if many here play mostly no-rimshots for 2 and 4 for backbeat pop/classic rock ?\n\nI don’t play a lot of backbeat music but when I do it’s mostly no-rimshots, unless I’m playing something like Cissy Strut where it sounds to me like all of the backbeats on the original recording were rimshots.\n\nMostly no rimshots here. I really like the sound and feel of a dead-ish center hit. Works great in what I play and it gives me some headroom. Once I've reached maximum velocity with my regular hits, I still have an option to go \"one louder\" with a RS.\n\nOr sometimes I'll use a RS as a special effect on a short section like a bridge or a crescendo leading up to the ending of a song.\n\nWhen I started out in the early 90's, I was in a band in wich I didn't play drums (lead singing and rythm guitar)\n\nThe drummer in that band was a hard hitter. He had a brass shelled free floater and he rimshotted each and every 2's & 4's . And each hit was like a shotgun blast right in my eardrums. When I started playing I promised myself that I would never play needlessly loud. We now play with IEMs and I crank my kit way loud in my ears so when I start getting a bit over enthusiastic with the upper end of my dynamic range, it gets uncomfortable fast. It forces me to not stay up there for too long, wich in turns makes it somewhat more impactful when I do.\n\nWhen I was playing prog-rock and rock cover tunes for 4 hours a night every backbeat was a rimshot.* I needed to do that to be heard (mid-1970s, minimal mics on the drums).\n\n* I was hitting so consistently that I broke the top rim of my snare drum directly under the rimshot location — twice within a few months. After the second time I replaced it with a cast hoop and played rimshots 4 hours a night for another 2 years with no problems.\n\nIt's really all about the music (sometimes the volume).\n\nMost modern pop/rock has a rimshot as the snare sound. So if you're playing centre hits you won't sound like the record.\n\nA lot of 70's classic rock, funk and soul had centre hits, so to me when someone plays that music with a rimshot it sounds wrong to me.\n\nIt should be about playing the snare in an appropriate way to serve the music. The only exception is if you are in a very low volume environment, like a restaurant or small bar, then I would change my playing style. Although I can play mid volume rimshots, playing very quiet rimshots for a whole set is a waste of time IMO.\n\nI play center almost all of the time. I occasionally play them as an effect or accent. A lot of drummers I like do one every backbeat though.\n\nMy father in law was a wildly successful A-List LA session drummer in the 80s and he was always a proponent of rimshots on every back beat but he admits that he came up playing in the 60s were there were never/rarely mics on the kit. He also tended to do fills on the snare and I remember him saying that tom toms were barely audible to a crown when he grew up playing.\n\nI won't be in a band that requires maximum loudness for a number of reasons. If every strike is a rimshot what do you do when you need a louder accent? It's a legit style, just one I don't care for.\n\nI'm a great believer in dynamics. On brushes I use light rim shots to mark 4 and 16 measure ends and to interact with the soloist.\n\nExcessive use of rim shots to me is a little like excessive use of exclamation points. I'm a believer that exclamation points are like laughing at your own joke.\n\nI won't be in a band that requires maximum loudness for a number of reasons.
