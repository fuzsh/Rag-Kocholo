        "text": "No other instrument can make us walk to the beat better than a good set of drums.\n\nAside from being the world's oldest musical instrument and coming in many shapes and sizes, drums are living proof that true classics never go out of style, as their basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\n\nIn fact, drumming is known to burn more calories in half an hour than cycling, hiking, or weight lifting. Guess it's time we all added a drum session to our workout routine!\n\nBut why exactly are we just drumming about? Let's get straight to the punchline, and no punchline would be properly delivered without an authentic rimshot. Ba dum tss!\n\nWe've all heard this iconic sound, a sting perfectly timed to punctuate jokes commonly told by live comedians, which may or may not include a simultaneous cymbal crash for some added oomph.\n\nPopularised in standup comedy mainly by the comedians of Jewish heritage who performed in the Catskill Mountains' resorts and known as the \"Borscht Belt comics\", this technique produces an accented backbeat by hitting the rim, hence the name, and the head of the drum with the stick.\n\nWhile many people's perception of the rimshot is that it comes completely unexpected for the comedian, this isn't quite the whole truth, as many comedians would often instruct the drummer when to use or not use the rimshot. Thus, when the comedian would jump, blink or act as if he had been slapped, the drums would kick in and heighten the audience's response. Comedy is indeed a thoroughly well-crafted work of art.\n\nNext time the humdrum of life starts playing, we say playback! March to the beat of the drums with this pair of Rimshot Socks."
