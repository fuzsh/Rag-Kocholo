        "text": "Ok, I have been playing for 25 yrs. Off and on. Seriously for the past 4 yrs. I'm a good drummer not great. No formal training other than at the age of 13 my parents hired a teacher. He came over and we would play flams and such on the practice pad for an hour. Unfortunetly I would not practice or listen so the lessons stopped abruptly. What if I had practiced what was taught?! Damnit!!! But I digress.\n\nI play a rim shot just about 100% of the time on the snare. I love the tone. I chew thru sticks about every 3rd practice. Practice being 4 hours twice a week. I play matched grip. If you go to the myspace page and listen to \"Playing with fire\" you can hear my typical style. I have good \"touch\" meaning I don't \"bash\" unless I need to. Is this a technique shared by some, or is this too much rim shot? Your feedback is much respected.\n\nI rim shot a lot also and my sticks have a short life span.\n\nIf you don't want to rim shot so much, one thing you can do is angle your snare to lower the rim on the striking side. I tried it but didn't like it so I went back to a flat setup and just use cheap sticks for practice.\n\nIt seems a habit I've gotten into lately as well. Rim shots most of the time. I took some lessons recently and the drum teacher emphasized cracking the snare with rim shot. I picked it up. What I don't like is sometimes I get all rim/no snare which sounds like a missed hit. Even tho it's become kind of habit I'm not trying on purpose, but it does make my 2s and 4s more powerful. I do think part of it too is my snare height/placement in relation to the angle of my strike. I guess I could adjust it out if I wished. No complaints from the band yet...\n\nI view rimshots like I view swear words. They are there to punctuate the main phrase. However, if you overuse them, then they have less of an effect.\n\nWhen my buddy that works in construction (beam welder) swears, no one pays attention. Mainly because every other word is some sort of swear. Yet, when my sister in law was recently at a family gathering, and called someone a {censored}, it was almost as if everyone in the room stopped and gasped in collective horror. She rarely swears, and that makes the punctuation of a swear word have much more of an effect than any of the swears coming out of my construction worker buddy's mouth.\n\nSame thing with a rimshotting drummer. A sound man will dial them back to balance them with the band if all that is coming from the set is rimshots. And, if that happens, there is no dynamics or extra umph that the drummer can add to the performance. Yet, if the soundman is dialed into regular backbeats, rimshots can really add in some emphasis and make the music sound more dynamic and exciting.\n\nI should add, this is for heavy rock music. If I were playing something lighter, or more dynamic, it might be different.\n\nThe first rock album I recorded, I really tried to play as dynamically as possible, wanted lots of nuance and texture, and it ended up sounding weak in the mix. Since then, I smack the drums pretty good and add some spice in other ways. Seems most drummers are so inconsistent that the big backbeat and explosive sound makes me stand out.\n\nI think a lot of folks forget that rim shots don't have to be an all-out smacking fest. I play rimshots a lot too, but much of the time, I play them softly. This allows me to tune my snare so that I get good ghost note action and response, but when I need that 'crack' (at any volume) out come the rimshots.\n\nKnow what I mean?\n\nI remember in reading somewhere Dave Weckl said he would rimshot with the last few inches of the stick to get a different sound for coloring. He's just full of great ideas. hehe I believe it was back in the days when words were still written on paper. It was from a book or magazine or something like that. Way before internet. It might have been in Modern Drummer Mag.\n\nI think a lot of folks forget that rim shots don't have to be an all-out smacking fest. I play rimshots a lot too, but much of the time, I play them softly. This allows me to tune my snare so that I get good ghost note action and response, but when I need that 'crack' (at any volume) out come the rimshots.\n\nKnow what I mean?\n\nYou know it just goes to show, there really are no rules to drumming or music in general really. If everybody played text book we would all sound the same, that would be incredibly boring if you ask me. And who decides what \"proper\" technique is any way? Sounds to me like that's your style, I say roll with it...."
