        "text": "Now that your drum models are selected and named, it’s time to train Sensory Percussion to recognize each drum and the different ways that each drum can be played. You only have to do this once for each drum you are using with Sensory Percussion. It’s a pretty quick process.\n\nSelect track 1 and then click the learn... button in the Pad Visualizer window. Now select the pad you want to train first, like Center.\n\nTrain each pad using the following methods:\n\nPlay the center of the drum, striking it 50 to 100 times at varying volumes and speeds. Feel free to play the center of the drum musically during this process, because it is helpful for our software to get a real-world representation of your strokes.\n\nRemain in, or return to learning mode and select the Edge pad and play all around the edge of the drum at varying volumes and speeds. (50 - 100 hits)\n\nIn learning mode select the Rimshot Center pad and train the system to recognize rimshots by playing them in the center of the drum at varying volumes and speeds. The rimshot has a more predictable timbral response and therefore only requires 20 to 40 hits for training.\n\nSelect the Rimshot Edge pad in and train the system to recognize rimshots on the edge of the drumhead by playing them at varying volumes and speeds. (30 - 40 hits)\n\nSelect the Rim Tip pad and train the pad to recognize playing the rim of the drum with the tip of your stick at varying volumes and speeds. (50 - 100 hits)\n\nIn learning mode select the Rim Shoulder pad and train the pad to recognize playing the rim of the drum with the shoulder of your stick at varying volumes and speeds. (50 - 100 hits)\n\nSelect the Cross Stick pad and train the pad to recognize playing cross stick hits at varying volumes and speeds. Train the pad with the stick upside down and right side up if you play cross sticks both ways.\n\nPlace one hand flat on the drumhead and play the drum at various volumes, speeds and locations. Train the drum with different amounts of palm pressure for best results (50-100 hits).\n\nPlace one stick on the drumhead and strike that stick with your other stick at various volumes, speeds and locations on the stick. Move the striked stick to a few different spots on the drumhead for best results (50-100 hits).\n\nPlay the shell of the drum at various volumes, speeds and locations (30-40 hits).\n\nTrain the \"closed\" kick drum pad by digging the kick pedal mallet into the head after each strokes (50 - 100 hits).\n\nLet the mallet rebound off of the drumhead after each stroke (50 - 100 hits).\n\nPlay the rim of your kick drum with the tip of your stick at various volumes, speeds and locations (30 - 50 hits).\n\nPlay the rim of your kick drum with the shoulder of your stick at various volumes, speeds and locations (30 - 50 hits).\n\nTrain Sensory Percussion to recognize the hardware of your kick drum by playing it at various volumes and speeds (30 - 50 hits).\n\nPlay the shell of the kick drum with the tip and/or shoulder of your stick, varying volumes and speeds (30 - 50 hits).\n\nIf you make a few mistakes while training a drum pad, don’t worry, Sensory Percussion recognizes and removes outlier strokes from training. But if you accidentally train the wrong pad, simply right click the pad (while still in learning mode) and select clear training, and then retrain the pad correctly.\n\nAfter you have retuned your drums, or if Sensory Percussion has stopped responding well even with over 100 hits on the pads, then it is time to clear training on all pads and retrain your model."
