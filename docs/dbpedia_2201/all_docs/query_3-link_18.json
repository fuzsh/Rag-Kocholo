        "text": "How do IÂ make sense of drum terminology?\n\nAuthor: Simon DasGupta.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nIn this article\n\nIn general, the world of drums, percussion, and music is filled with many weird and wonderful terms. It can be daunting but don't worry. Our free glossary is here to help you understand popular:\n\nterms used in drums and percussion.\n\nterms used in music theory generally, that are often seen by drummers.\n\ncommon buzz-words and confusing \"drummer slang.\"\n\nWhy are drumming terms so confusing?\n\nA drum head is the new accepted term for what we once called a drum skin. You tighten your drum heads by adjusting the tension bolts, and you fit the head onto the bearing edge of your drum shell.\n\nâThat one paragraph alone has multiple drum terms that can confuse beginner drummers, and we haven't even touched the weird ones like batter heads, hybrid drums, crotchets, and x-hats.\n\nWhat is a rack tom, and why might you need a memory lock? How does a rim shot differ from a rim click? How does a boom cymbal stand compare to a straight stand, and what on earth is a snare basket?\n\nThe Glossary."
