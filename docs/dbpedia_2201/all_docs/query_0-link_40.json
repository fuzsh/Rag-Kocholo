        "text": "Batterhead, Flam and Rimshot are all terms associated with which musical instrument?\n\nThe result had been a saga that spanned 26 months and provided a litmus test of sorts to LPFM and translator supporters who seek local, community voices and believe \"rimshot\" or out-of-market signals should be used to deliver what larger corporate-owned stations don't.\n\nThe new friends never come to understand the error in their thinking, and the comic rimshot of an ending--a bird appears to tell them they are \"two weird-looking birds\"--leaves readers hoping an epiphany will follow.\n\nWith three Baptists, you have six opinions (rimshot by Doug C).\n\nThe tracks are \"Nighty Noodels\" (2:41), \"Further and Farther Around the Bend\" (4:09), \"Noodles Interlude\" (0:37), \"Skeezy Boofer's Wonderful Ears\" (11:42), \"Noodles Interlude 2\" (0:27), \"Why Slipper Stream Sings\" (5:51), \"How Is that Scrape on Your Knee?\" (2:15), \"Swing the Gate and the Worm Brigade\" (13:56), \"Noodles Interlude 3\" (0:37), \"Melody Rimshot and the Tub of Pickles Band\" (11:28), \"Pages of a Book are Like Leaves on a Tree\" (2:17), \"Carmela Cellar Door and Her Bedtime Song\" (10:35), \"Carmela's Song\" (2:33) and \"Nighty Noodles - Reprise\" (0:48).\n\nRimshot! The directing team deserves only partial blame for what goes wrong.\n\nBrad was without question the greatest Ska drummer around, his technique was copied by others but never equalled, Brad (or Prince Rimshot) put it down to \"muscle memory\", the fans knew it was more than that.\n\nSome of Asia's Performances for 2012 ElleLumnation \"The Sequel\", Entertainment Heat Fest - Taste of Decatur, Back to School drive in Kingsland, GA, Kids X-Factor Friday Night Live in Alpharetta, GA Sugarloaf Mills Mall Talent Search in Lawrenceville, GA, and The Theatrical Production \"The Rimshot Urban Musical.\" Some of Asia's Performances for 2013 Black History Month Parade Atlanta, GA, Uniquely Us Teens & Kids Fashion show in Smyrna, GA, Constructive kids Youth & Teen Summit Tour East Point, GA.\n\nEaton got applause, and apparently was waiting for a rimshot from the band when Letterman struck.\n\nAlso available is RimShot Rim Salt, made with red and black Hawaiian sea salts, alder-smoked sea salt, celery salt and black pepper."
