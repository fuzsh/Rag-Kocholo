        "text": "Anyone got any good tips for synthesising good rimshots on the RYTM?\n\nI have tried on both machines, but am not getting satisfactory results and tend to resort to samples. Very interested to hear if anyone has any good tips for doing it with the synthesis machines.\n\nI find that the tick is barely audible even when maxed out. The symmetry parameter doesn’t seem to do much except when >64 and then things just get quieter. I have to crank the overdrive way up just to get it even halfway useable. Feel like I’m missing a trick. Anyone got any good tips for getting good a good analog RS sound?\n\nWell the lack of response has me thinking you is all like “who is this chump not getting a good RS out the RYTM”.\n\nBut anyway… progress.\n\nTurns out the sweet spot is quite tight and the range of the RYTM parameters is quite wide.\n\nAttempting an 808 style rim.\n\nSample of the original for context:\n\n/uploads/default/original/3X/e/5/e5e9d8ef2b443574c828a7e2fef0957cd750d3b5.wav\n\nManaged to get to here:\n\n/uploads/default/original/3X/5/8/584d5204e9dd7f471900e5085682b11fb1fd4487.wav\n\nStill needs a little bit of work. Not sure if the envelopes on the RYTM will quite allow me to get it quite as punchy but will keep tweaking\n\nParameters if interested\n\nNo LFOs samples or any other bits at play\n\nIt wasn’t me! I’m watching this thread in hopes of learning something.\n\nWell, a confession to start with.\n\nAs it turns out, a lot of my issues were to do with the fact that I had the volume on the amp page turned far too low. So that explains why even when I had the synth volume maxed out, I was getting such quiet results and was needing to crank the OD and barely hearing the tick or influence of the symmetry parameter\n\nHowever, the sweet spot is still tight. Esp when it comes to the interaction between the sweep time, depth and the decay parameters on the synth page.\n\nhere’s my attempt, no lfos, only RS HARD with filter, 909 sample for reference. I’m sure you can fine tune even more to get it closer.\n\n/uploads/default/original/3X/9/0/90d45310b5d3673509bae0eb7a656b1b3cd04810.mp3\n\nbut I wonder why? I mean, if I’d be after roland sound I’d just use sample or in my case I have tr-6s which is relatively cheap solution for all the roland synthesis, imo the advantage of rytm is that you can expand the sound beyond the standard sound…\n\nfor example yesterday I’ve played with the RS HARD and it’s so good as bass/kick/snare whatever lol\n\nOh sure. I agree. Use whatever tools are at your disposal to achieve the intended aim.\n\nBut these sounds are classic for a reason. They are pretty ace. So the reasons I can think of to try to synthesise it on the RYTM are:\n\nIf I can synthesise them it will free up the sample slot and could try layering with a sample to give a new dimension.\n\nThe parameters on the originals are fairly limited. By getting to a sound that I like on the RYTM synthesis engine I can then start to deviate and see if I can create something more original. Still have LFOs, effects, filter envelopes, overdrive etc. to play with.\n\nChallenge! It’s fun to try and do it. But also by doing so I’ll get to learn more about drum synthesis."
