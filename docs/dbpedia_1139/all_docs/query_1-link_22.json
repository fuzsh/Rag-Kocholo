While there is a lot of effort going into creating radio with artificial intelligence and synthetic voices, this approach misses the whole point radio. It's not just hearing a playlist, it's feeling connected to the people who love what you love. It‚Äôs about how imperfect moments achieve perfection on air. That‚Äôs magic for our listeners, and that‚Äôs why TuneIn is investing in passionate creators like Debbie and Tom. ‚ù§Ô∏è #reinventradio\n\nHappy Native Language Day! Yesterday was the day to celebrate the beauty of diversity in languages, dialects and cultures. We all have the privilege to explore so many new perspectives through the art of language. And what better way to celebrate than with TuneIn Explorer?! Bridge the gap between people of different languages by tuning in to music, stories and news from around the globe. Give it a try- you might find something amazing! tunein.com/explorer"
