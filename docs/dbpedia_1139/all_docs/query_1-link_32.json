        "text": "I’m delighted to announce that John Wordock has been promoted to Executive Editor for the WSJ and MarketWatch Radio Networks.\n\nWhile we will continue to keep both brands and offerings distinct as they focus on different customers — both radio stations and audiences alike — John will be charged with dramatically increasing internal cross-collaboration in our recently streamlined radio team, and leveraging all our on-air and off-air talent. Patrice Sikora, Managing Editor of WSJ Radio, will continue in her vital role and significantly ramp up on her first love: on-air journalism.\n\nJohn brings with him a strong passion for the radio business, providing extraordinary customer relations for traditional over-the-air partners such as WINS-AM in New York, WTOP-FM in Washington, WBBM-AM/FM in Chicago and KCBS-AM/FM in San Francisco. During John’s tenure as Managing Editor of MarketWatch Radio, its affiliate roster has grown to some 250 stations.\n\nJohn’s team has also captured numerous accolades for its reporting the last few years, including several National Headliner Awards for breaking news and enterprise reporting, SABEW’s Best in Business Award, the Excellence in Financial Journalism Award judged by NYSSCPA and the New York Financial Writers Association, and NAREE’s Best Real Estate Broadcast Award.\n\nJohn’s also been quite progressive in moving MarketWatch Radio online, developing a radio page for listeners, a widget for affiliates, and podcasts for iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn and other content partners. He’s also been an early adopter of social media. MarketWatch Radio has been on Twitter and Facebook for almost a half-decade now.\n\nAs a managing editor at MarketWatch.com since 2007, John has also worked closely with top editors there in planning story coverage and finding a complementary role for audio. That experience will especially help in his new role as we seek to expand audio offerings for current and future WSJ, MarketWatch and Dow Jones products.\n\nJohn’s role will be effective March 1 when he will start commuting to New York and South Brunswick, with an eye on moving his family permanently this summer from Bethesda, Md.\n\nPlease join in me congratulating John."
