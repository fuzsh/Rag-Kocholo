        "text": "What is the application deadline for summer 2024 internships?\n\nApplications for U.S. summer internships close on Monday, Oct. 23, 2023 at noon Eastern time. Applications for London and Singapore close Monday, Dec. 4, 2023 at noon Eastern time.\n\nWhere can I find the application links for the internships?\n\nThe links can be found at WSJ.jobs. Applications for internships in 2025 will be posted in the fall of 2024.\n\nIs there an age requirement?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal internship program is an opportunity primarily for college juniors to work in our award-winning newsrooms. Seniors and graduate students enrolled in a degree program by the application deadline are also eligible to apply. All applicants must be at least 18 years of age.\n\nEarly career journalists with one to three years of journalism newsroom experience who have a curiosity about financial markets or about the ways people spend, save and invest can apply to our WSJ Finance Reporting Fellowships.\n\nHow long is the summer internship program?\n\nThe summer internship program runs for 10 weeks from mid-June to mid-August and requires full-time interns to work 35 hours per week.\n\nWhat prior experience is needed?\n\nApplicants should have at least one previous professional news media job or internship, or published exceptional work with a campus news outlet or as a freelancer.\n\nWhat does the application process require?\n\nA cover letter, including a response to the following question: Based on the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections, what could news organizations do differently to cover the 2024 presidential election? (max. 800 words)\n\nYour résumé.\n\nThree examples of your published work. Late or incomplete submissions will not be considered.\n\nCan I apply for more than one internship for the summer?\n\nWe appreciate that you may have more than one interest or base of skills, but we encourage you to present your best application to the internship for which you feel most qualified.\n\nDo you have to be a citizen to apply?\n\nYou need to be authorized to work in the country where the internship is based. We do not sponsor new work visas for the internship.\n\nDo work samples need to be in English?\n\nYes. All work samples for the U.S.-based internships must be submitted in English. For internships in Europe and Asia, work samples published in a language other than English should be accompanied by a full English translation.\n\nAre interns paid?\n\nYes. It is our policy to pay everyone who works for us, including interns. For 2024, the salary for U.S. summer interns is $1,000 per week.\n\nWhat do interns actually do?\n\nThe summer 2023 interns reported front-page news, created interactive graphics, edited photo projects, wrote colorful features, produced videos, assisted in daily production of podcasts, reported and produced long form narrative podcast episodes, curated and published our journalism across platforms, and much more. Interns are encouraged to pitch their own stories and projects.\n\nDo you offer remote internships?\n\nNo. We prefer to have our interns work in the office where they can best take advantage of the program. Our internships are mostly based in our New York City newsroom. We may also offer internships in Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco or Washington D.C. In Europe our interns are based in London. In Asia, our interns are based in Singapore.\n\nDoes The Wall Street Journal assist in finding summer housing?\n\nNo. Interns are responsible for their own housing arrangements.\n\nHow many interns are selected?\n\nUp to 20 interns globally for the summer.\n\nIs the WSJ application process separate from the Dow Jones News Fund internship program?\n\nYes, the WSJ application process is separate from the Dow Jones News Fund internship program. We typically select 2 or 3 DJNF’s program participants for our internship program.\n\nHow soon will I hear whether I’ve been selected?\n\nDue to the high volume of applicants, only finalists will be contacted. We will review applications on a rolling basis and strive to make selections for the U.S. internship by the end of January and by mid-February for Europe and Asia.\n\nHow can I check the status of my application?\n\nYou can check the status of your application by logging into your candidate account. Only finalists will be contacted.\n\nI’m having trouble attaching my résumé and work samples to the application.\n\nIn Workday, you can upload only one document (your résumé) using the Quick Apply feature at the start. You may upload additional application materials, such as essays and work samples, in the “My Experience” section named “Additional Documents.” One PDF (max. 10MB) containing all materials is preferred."
