        "text": "ROBERT REILLY: In 2001 the BBG wanted to eliminate VOA radio broadcasts to Uzbekistan. Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote the board not to do this because of U.S. strategic interests. The chairman sent him a letter back thanking him for his point of view.\n\nThe board ultimately relented and soon thereafter the U.S. deployed troops in Uzbekistan to support operations in Afghanistan. I asked a board member if he was glad that they hadn’t eliminated the Uzbek service, so we can explain to the people there why U.S. troops are in their country. “Oh no,” he responded, “we go in and out of radio markets all the time.” It didn’t occur to him that the Voice of America was the on-the-air American flag to the Uzbek people and that one does not continually raise and lower the flag without a depressing effect on the people whose confidence we are trying to gain.\n\nThis episode was unfortunately typical of board members who had no experience in foreign policy or public diplomacy, much less in the war of ideas (though the current board is a big improvement in this respect). Most BBG members have been highly accomplished individuals who made their fortunes in the media. They sought to replicate their success according to commercial criteria, which meant aiming at large youth audiences and abandoning markets where such audiences could not be attracted.\n\nThus the BBG eliminated VOA broadcasting to Brazil, India, Russia and the Arab world (replacing it with a pop music station, Radio Sawa, which had only two short newscasts per hour), and repeatedly tried to eliminate VOA’s China services. Who listens became less important than how many listened, or to what. Too often board members proclaimed that government broadcasting had nothing to do with U.S. public diplomacy. At which point, one might reasonably ask, then why are we doing it? And why should the U.S. taxpayer pay for it?"
