        "text": "Binance counts China as its largest market, followed by South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and then the British Virgin Islands, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Journal reports that despite the ban on crypto within China, teams from Binance regularly collaborate with Chinese law enforcement to detect potential criminal activity. It also has 900,000 active users in-country, according to the Journal.\n\nData from the Journal shows that China is a $80.6 billion futures market and a $9.4 billion spot market for Binance. South Korea provides $56.9 billion in futures volume and $1.39 billion in spot volume. In contrast, the British Virgin Islands is responsible for $12.82 billion in spot volume and $5 billion in futures volume.\n\nTypically traders based in China use a combination of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and a digital residency program such as Palau’s RNS.ID to bypass geographical restrictions."
