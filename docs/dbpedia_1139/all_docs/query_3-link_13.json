        "text": "The Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) was named among the country’s worst in the Wall Street Journal’s recent 2023 rankings of the 50 busiest airports in the country.\n\nThe WSJ’s rating system is based on reliability, value, and convenience. PHL ranks 27th out of the 30 busiest midsize airports in the nation with a score of 58.5 out of 100.\n\nPHL received a 54 in overall reliability, determined by 10 different categories, and a 63 for value and convenience across 17 categories, which cover all factors in a customer’s airport experience outside of their actual flight.\n\nPHL came in last among midsize airports for its layout, taxi and ride-share options, bathrooms, child facilities, staff and announcements, water filling stations and the number of seats at its gates.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Business Journal, the airport will open two new dining options next year: Philadelphia-born Elixr Coffee Roasters in the winter and an airport version of the popular South Philadelphia restaurant Sabrina’s Cafe in the spring.\n\n“We are confident that these improvements, along with exciting new and upcoming concessions from PHL Food & Shops and the opening of the Chase Sapphire Lounge will enhance the passenger experience at PHL,” the airport said in its statement.\n\nFor all the latest news, follow us on Facebook or sign up for Glenside Local’s “Daily Buzz” newsletter here.\n\nPhoto: Philadelphia International Airport"
