        "text": "“The Daily Wrap from The Wall Street Journal with Michael Castner” is scheduled to debut April 4 as a weekday talk and opinion show that will air from 6-9 p.m. ET. Journalist and radio personality Michael Castner has signed on as the show’s host and will air from The Journal’s HQ in NYC.\n\nCastner will break down the major news and developments of the day on a range of topics, including U.S and world news, politics, entertainment, health, technology, sports and more – with contributions and analysis from some 2,000 Wall Street Journal reporters, editors and opinion writers as well as newsmakers and special guests.\n\nListen to the demo, by clicking the speaker below, it’s great.\n\nThe Daily Wrap:\n\n“The Daily Wrap will showcase the breadth and depth of reporting and resources from across Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal to serve high-quality news and analysis, interviews and opinion across myriad topics,” said Nancy Abramson, executive director of The Wall Street Journal Radio Network. “The show will complement the Journal brand – expanded content and scope, fascinating stories and new ideas – and provide an exciting new opportunity and alignment for advertisers.”\n\nThe WSJ Radio Network currently serves more than 400 affiliates in the U.S. with breaking news, business, consumer spending and financial market news. Programming includes The Wall Street Journal Report, The Dow Jones Money Report, Watching Your Wallet, Barron’s on Investment, The Wall Street Journal This Morning and The Wall Street Journal This Weekend.\n\n“My goal for the show is to quickly and informally capture the essence of the day’s top issues,” said Castner. “I’ll be talking with reporters and opinion leaders who will share information and observations. We’ll look for unique details through conversation, not confrontation.”\n\nCastner’s broadcast career has spanned news, entertainment and politics. He currently serves as a host on WRNO-FM in New Orleans and WJBO-AM in Baton Rouge. He previously hosted the Nightside Project heard on KSL- AM/ FM Salt Lake City, KTAR in Phoenix and Talk Radio 3WT in Washington DC., and served as news anchor for KFI-AM LA.\n\nGabe Hobbs Media is serving as a consultant for the show; Westwood One is the ad sales rep."
