        "text": "Update: itâs gotten pretty good recently. Waymo autonomous cars, aircraft safety, charging while driving were all interesting and relevant today. And what happened to the bias â¦ did a memo go out? Someone fired the light weight social advocates and replaced them with proper journalists. Nice. The shows are a bit short and light for my taste and one speakers voice sounds like a 15 year old, but the latter is my problem not hers. Anyway, well done wsj. Previous review from a year or so ago. This has to be a separate group from WSJ. Both light weight and biased. The recent Rosetta Stone article talked about how the recent decoding of the entire human genome (filling in the 8% that was missing) was groundbreaking and would change our understanding of diseases. However, the only evidence was essentially the person who did the work saying it was groundbreaking and would change our .... If \"felt\" like Dr Eichler and his team did a lot of hard work over something that didn't matter all that much and was deparate to make it sound important. Just give me some facts next time and you'll have me. The recent \"As we work\" episode was embarassing. All about the unfairness of the wage gap to women, minorities, etc. Zero from the studies which showed where, in large part, this comes from. At least for women, it's that they choose or are forced in some way to take the less intense job. So, take the town lawyer job at 30 hours per week vs. the corporate 60 hour a week one. You can argue against what I said, but at least mention that this data is out there. And the host must know about this, or is incompetent. The last thing we need is another NPR podcast. I'm done."
