        "text": "Private-equity firm ATL Partners has acquired a majority stake in space technology provider Geost LLC as the U.S. and its allies focus more of their defense efforts on outer space.\n\nGeost, based in Tucson, Ariz., develops and services technology, such as infrared sensors, that helps detect and prevent potential threats to satellites and other U.S. assets in space.\n\nThe company’s technology supports what is known as space domain awareness, or identifying, characterizing and understanding factors that could affect U.S. operations in outer space with the potential to threaten the country’s safety and security. The U.S. Defense Department and intelligence agencies are devoting more resources to improving space domain awareness, particularly as rival nations such as China and Russia step up their space activities."
