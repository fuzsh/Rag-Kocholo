        "text": "The University of St. Thomas-Houston continues to receive national accolades. Last week, UST published a story in its newsroom that Princeton Review included it in its ‘2024 Best Colleges: Region by Region’ rankings. This week, statistics showed that UST ranked No. 4 of 23 universities in the State of Texas, only behind Texas A&M - College Station, Rice University and UT-Austin. UST is ranked as a top national college by the Wall Street Journal/College Pulse in its ‘2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.’ rankings and Forbes 2023 named it to its ‘America’s Top Colleges’ list.\n\n“These rankings highlight many aspects of UST and continue to raise our standing,” UST President Dr. Richard Ludwick said. “Our great faculty and their work, the care each staff member gives to students, and the impressive success achieved by our students all factor into those rankings in one way or another. The driving force, however, for UST’s increasing impact is our Catholic mission and how we strive to honor the dignity of each human person and empower them to flourish with the potential God gives to each of us.”\n\nWall Street Journal/College Pulse ‘2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.’\n\nThe institution was recently recognized as one of the ‘2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.’ by the Wall Street Journal and College Pulse in collaboration with the independent market research firm Statista.\n\nUST ranks No.158 out of the top 400 universities in the country. According to America’s Best Colleges 2024 webpage, “This ranking reinforces the University of St. Thomas’ standing as a college with the highest quality of learning environment and student experience across the nation.”\n\nThe rankings are based principally on outcomes-focused metrics, which quantify the college's contribution to the students' success.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Best Colleges in the U.S. 2024 ranking aims to guide prospective students nationwide, while recognizing the colleges doing an outstanding job in higher education. This ranking of the top 400 colleges is based on student and alumni surveys and student outcome metrics, including student engagement, student outcomes, the learning environment and diversity.\n\nIn addition, WSJ/College Pulse worked with data scientists at Statista to use the most recent available data and put colleges on a more level playing field, with a focus on comparing the outcomes of each school’s graduates to those of students who were likely to achieve no matter where they went to school. Schools are evaluated against a benchmark that shows how the schools improve the trajectories of their students’ careers.\n\nForbes 2023: ‘America’s Top Colleges List’\n\nEvery year, Forbes spotlights the 500 U.S. colleges that check all the boxes: impressive graduation rates, high graduate salaries, and great outcomes for low-income students, to name a few. This year on Forbes 2023: America’s Top Colleges list, University of St. Thomas-Houston ranked No.345.\n\nUST’s profile on the Forbes Top Colleges webpage includes: “The University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas, blends the Catholic faith with a comprehensive educational experience. …UST’s core curriculum exposes students to a range of disciplines from mathematics to theology.
