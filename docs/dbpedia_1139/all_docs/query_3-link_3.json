        "text": "We are the definitive source of news and information through the lens of business, finance, economics and money, global forces that shape the world and are key to understanding it. Our audience is anyone who wants or has a job, a career or an ambition; who seeks money, makes money, spends money and saves money; who desires an edge as an investor, an employee, a manager or an entrepreneur; or who simply wants to better understand how the world works.\n\nWe provide facts, data and information, not assertions or opinions. We believe in full separation between News and Opinion. We pursue exclusive stories, with the goal of breaking all important scoops in our core areas; deep insight and analysis; and actionable intelligence—being the first read and the last word. We have a unique, trusted responsibility as a watchdog and custodian. Across coverage, we seek a genuinely diverse set of voices and experiences with every story striving to speak to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nAs journalists, we are humble, curious, empathetic, informed and open-minded. Our work is plain, direct, concise and accessible, but not simplistic. Trust in our news, information and authority is the currency we seek to earn with all we produce.\n\nWe have an important social purpose. Society benefits from a common set of verifiable facts and a broad set of voices that reflect our world, even in times of stress and division—indeed, especially in such times. Providing those facts informs debate and contributes to the greater good.\n\nNewsroom Standards & Ethics\n\nOur adherence to the highest and most rigorous standards of fairness and integrity have enabled The Wall Street Journal to flourish for more than 130 years. Our reputation is our most cherished possession. We strive to be a model for ethical, fact-based, ambitious news reporting.\n\nThis dedication is a central reason we are so trusted by readers. National surveys repeatedly rank The Wall Street Journal among the most trusted news organizations in the U.S. on both sides of the political divide. Readers trust us because they see us as fair, accurate and impartial. There are many journalistic practices that are the bedrock of this trust.\n\nOur journalists are committed to the most ethical conduct in pursuing our work and aim to uphold the legacy of integrity above reproach, including adherence to the Dow Jones Code of Conduct. We aspire to honest and ethical conduct in all iterations with colleagues, competitors, sources, subjects and our readers. We avoid the perception of bias as rigorously as we do any real bias. We forswear financial entanglement with, or perceived obligation to, our sources or the subjects of our work. We avoid partisan political statements or activities. We offer professional support for our colleagues to raise ethical concerns.\n\nNo Surprises Journalism\n\nWe adhere to a long legacy of 'no surprises' journalism. That means performing the highest level of due diligence to assess the credibility of our sources, and providing an opportunity for full and fair comment for all parties involved in an article before it publishes. We never pursue an agenda other than an unwavering commitment to the truth, which is why we strive to attribute all disputable facts as precisely as possible to relevant parties, and write in a neutral declarative tone."
