        "text": "BENGALURU â€“ Microsoft is asking about 700 to 800 people in its China-based cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence (AI) operations to consider transferring outside the country, The Wall Street Journal reported on May 16.\n\nThe employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality, were earlier in the week offered an option to transfer to countries including the United States, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe move comes amid spiralling US-China relations as the administration of US President Joe Biden cracks down on various sectors of Chinese imports, including electric-vehicle batteries, computer chips and medical products.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson told the Journal that providing internal opportunities is part of its global business, and confirmed the company had shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees.\n\nReuters reported in May that the US Commerce Department is considering a new regulatory push to restrict the export of proprietary or closed-source AI models, whose software and the data they are trained on are kept under wraps.\n\nThe spokesperson, however, told the newspaper that the company remains committed to the region and will continue to operate in China.\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
