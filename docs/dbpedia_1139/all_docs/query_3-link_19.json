        "text": "FIU is the No. 29 university in the nation and the fourth-ranked public university, according to the America’s Best Colleges 2024 rankings published today on WSJ.com.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also ranks FIU in the top 10 overall, both for social mobility and student experience.\n\nThe rankings were compiled by The Wall Street Journal and College Pulse, in collaboration with the independent market research firm Statista. The America's Best Colleges 2024 ranking aims to guide prospective students across the nation while recognizing the colleges doing an outstanding job in higher education. The rankings were based on:\n\nStudent and Alumni Survey: Over 60,000 undergraduates and recent undergraduate alumni were asked by College Pulse to provide feedback on colleges that are a great value to its students in terms of tuition, learning environment, degree completion, and the likelihood of a higher salary after graduation.\n\nStudent Outcomes Metrics: A variety of metrics around student outcomes were used to compare salary impact vs. similar colleges, the number of years to pay off net price, and graduation rates vs. similar colleges. An assessment of level of diversity on campus also was a part of the analysis.\n\n“FIU is a great return on investment and this ranking is the latest indication that FIU is providing an excellent university experience, in and out of the classroom, that supports student success,” said FIU President Kenneth A. Jessell. “This is more proof that FIU is Forward-thinking, Innovative, Unstoppable.”\n\nAccording to the publication: “The WSJ’s college rankings are based on a comprehensive evaluation of over 1,000 colleges and universities, taking into account a variety of factors that are deemed important for students and their future success. Unlike many other college rankings, which often focus solely on measures such as academic reputation or endowment size, the WSJ’s rankings take into account a wide range of factors, including the earning potential of graduates, the level of student debt, and the cost of attendance.”\n\nThe latest rankings join a list of milestone FIU achievements over the past year. Last week, Washington Monthly’s annual College Guide and Rankings ranked FIU among the top 20 universities in the nation. The rankings rate four-year institutions on their commitment to three goals: social mobility, public service, and research. FIU ranked 19th among all universities and 6th among public universities. It is the No. 1 university in Florida.\n\nIn June, FIU earned the highest score in the State University System according to the Florida Board of Governors performance-based funding (PBF) metrics. In fall 2022, FIU became the fastest–rising university in U.S. News & World Report’s public university rankings, jumping 62 spots in a decade. Then, in May, FIU Law climbed 38 spots to rank No. 60 among the nation’s law schools – and No. 32 among public schools – according to U.S. News and World Report. That puts FIU Law among the top three law schools in the state.\n\nDegree Choices also ranked FIU No. 8 nationally for students’ return on investment, based on the cost of attending and the earnings a student can expect.\n\n“FIU is a research university fueled by high-achieving and driven students who recognize the value proposition of an FIU degree,” said FIU Executive Vice President, Provost and Chief Operating Officer Elizabeth M. Béjar. “As an anchor institution and economic engine of Florida, FIU continues to positively impact the economic mobility and upward trajectory of our students and graduates.”"
