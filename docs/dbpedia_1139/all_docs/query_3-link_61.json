        "text": "The World Scout Jamboree (WSJ) is an international gathering of Scouts and Guides from all around the world. The World Scout Jamboree is an opportunity for young people and adult volunteers to make international friendships with people from different cultures, and take part in a safe, inclusive and sustainable programme of activities\n\nAbout the Jamboree\n\nThe first Jamboree was held at Olympia, London in 1920. Since then, the Jamboree has taken place roughly every four years, bringing 14-17 year olds together from all around the World. Providing an opportunity for young people to share their cultures, learn about the world around them and participate in a variety of activities.\n\nThe event takes place every four years, and a different country hosts the event and its participants. In the Summer of 2023, over 4,500 Scouts and Guides from across the UK made their way to Korea for the 25th World Scout Jamboree.\n\nThe UK Contingent\n\nThe UK Contingent (UKC) is made up of Participants, Unit Leaders, International Service Team (IST) and the Contingent Management Team. Together, the UKC represents the UK at the World Scout Jamboree.\n\nPreparing for a Jamboree is no small task. At The Scouts, we provide support through the Contingent Management Team, a team of volunteers and staff that plan and organise the UK's attendance at the Jamboree; providing information to participants, Unit Leaders and IST along the way."
