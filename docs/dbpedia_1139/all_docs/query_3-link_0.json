        "text": "American business daily newspaper\n\n\"WSJ\" redirects here. For other uses, see WSJ (disambiguation).\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ), also referred to simply as the Journal, is an American newspaper based in New York City, with a focus on business and finance. It operates on a subscription model, requiring readers to pay for access to its articles and content. The Journal is published six days a week by Dow Jones & Company, a division of News Corp. The first issue was published on July 8, 1889.[2]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is the second-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, with a print circulation of around 560,000 and 3 million digital subscribers as of 2023.[1] WSJ publishes international editions in various regions around the world, including Europe and Asia. The editorial pages of the Journal are typically center-right in their positions,[3][4][5][6] while the newspaper itself maintains commitment to journalistic standards in its reporting.[3] The newspaper has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes.[7][8][9]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding and 19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Journal, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed flimsies, hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers' Afternoon Letter. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.[10]\n\nIn 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the Journal's Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nJournalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902 (equivalent to $4,578,000 in 2023); circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, Barron's, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.[11] Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.[11]\n\nThe Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its \"What's News\" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1 million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials.[11]\n\nIn 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.[12]\n\nThe period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \"Factiva\", The Wall Street Journal Asia, The Wall Street Journal Europe, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \"WSJ Weekend Edition\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones.[citation needed] WSJ., a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.[13]\n\nA complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.[14] A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.[15]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal's print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements.[16] In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.[11] Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind The New York Times with 3 million digital subscriptions.[17] In May 2008, an annual subscription to the digital edition of The Wall Street Journal cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.[18] Digital subscription rates increased dramatically to $443.88 per year as its popularity increased over print, with first-time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.[19]\n\nOn November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and The Wall Street Journal released an app that would allow users to access content from The Wall Street Journal Online via their mobile phones.[20]\n\nIn September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.[11]\n\nIn 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million, and an average age of 55.[21]\n\nIn 2007, the Journal launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival Financial Times.[22]\n\nDesign changes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.[23]\n\nFront-page advertising in the Journal was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.[24]\n\nAfter presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century – always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, \"What's News\" digest in the second and third, the \"A-hed\" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column[25] – the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12 inches while keeping the length at 223⁄4 inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18 million a year in newsprint costs across all The Wall Street Journal papers.[26] This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the \"A-hed\" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).\n\nThe paper uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls,[27] in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. the Journal still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert.[28][29] The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more \"lifestyle\" sections.\n\nThe daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.[30]\n\nNews Corporation and News Corp\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share.[citation needed] The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.[31]\n\nThree months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement.[32] The US$5 billion sale added The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, London's The Times, the New York Post, and the Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).[33]\n\nOn December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.[34]\n\nIn an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the Journal's news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent.[35]\n\nA special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.[36]\n\nA 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long \"expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations\". Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when \"Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.\" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.[37]\n\nIn 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the Journal agreed to run \"articles\" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.[38] The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice.[39] As a result, the then Wall Street Journal Europe CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.[40][41] Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.\n\nThe Journal, along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp.[42]\n\nIn November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the Journal's editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections. The new \"Business & Finance\" section combined the former \"Business & Tech\" and \"Money & Investing\" sections. The new \"Life & Arts\" section took the place of \"Personal Journal\" and \"Arena\". In addition, the Journal's \"Greater New York\" coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper.[43] The section was shuttered on July 9, 2021.[44]\n\nIn an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, The Wall Street Journal was ranked the most trusted news organization by Americans. Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University wrote that the paper's \"combination of respected news pages and conservative editorial pages seem to be a magic formula for generating trust across the ideological spectrum.\"[45]\n\nThe Personal Journal section branding was brought back in July 2020.[46]\n\nFrom 2019 through 2022, the Journal partnered with Facebook to provide content for the social-media site's \"News Tab\". Facebook paid the Journal in excess of $10 million during that period, terminating the relationship as part of a broader shift away from news content.[47]\n\nOn June 13, 2022, the Journal launched a product review website called Buy Side.[48] The website remains free and has a distinct team from the Journal newsroom.[48]\n\nIn February 2024, the Journal laid off about 20 employees, primarily economics reporters based in Washington, D.C. Moving forward, those beats will be covered by the newspaper's New York-based business team.[49] The next month the paper laid off another five people from its standards and ethics team.[50] In April, the paper laid off at least 11 people from its video and social media desks.[51] In May, the Journal cut six editorial staff positions from its Hong Kong bureau and another two reporter jobs in Singapore. Moving forward the paper will shift its focus in the region from Hong Kong to Singapore with new the creation of several new jobs at that bureau.[52] More staff were laid off a few weeks later amid further restructuring, including at least eight reporters.[53]\n\nRecent milestones\n\n[edit]\n\nWSJ Noted., a monthly digital magazine, launches on June 30, 2020, in a bid to attract younger readers.[54]\n\nReaches 3 million subscribers in May 2020[55]\n\nWSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011.[56]\n\nWSJ Weekend, the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: \"Off Duty\" and \"Review\".[57][58]\n\n\"Greater New York\", a stand-alone, full-color section dedicated to the New York metro area, ran from April 2010 until July 2021.[59][44]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print Journal and every day online at WSJ.com/SF.[60]\n\nWSJ Weekend, formerly called Saturday's Weekend Edition: September 2005.[61]\n\nLaunch of Today's Journal, which included both the addition of Personal Journal and color capacity to the Journal: April 2002.[62]\n\nLaunch of The Wall Street Journal Sunday: September 12, 1999. A four-page print supplement of original investing news, market reports and personal-finance advice that ran in the business sections of other U.S. newspapers. WSJ Sunday circulation peaked in 2005 with 84 newspapers reaching nearly 11 million homes. The publication ceased on February 7, 2015.[63]\n\nFriday Journal, formerly called First Weekend Journal: March 20, 1998.[64]\n\nWSJ.com launched in April 1996.[65]\n\nFirst three-section Journal: October 1988.[64]\n\nFirst two-section Journal: June 1980.[64]\n\nFeatures and operations\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1980, the Journal has been published in multiple sections. At one time, the Journal's page count averaged as many as 96 pages an issue,[citation needed] but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the Journal in 2009–10 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue.\n\nAs of 2012 , The Wall Street Journal had a global news staff of around 2,000 journalists in 85 news bureaus across 51 countries.[66][67] As of 2012 , it had 26 printing plants.[66] Its Asia headquarters is in Hong Kong, but will move to Singapore after it stated it would do so in 2024.[68]\n\nRegularly scheduled sections are:\n\nSection One: Every day; corporate news, as well as political and economic reporting and the opinion pages\n\nMarketplace: Monday through Friday; coverage of health, technology, media, and marketing industries (the second section was launched June 23, 1980)\n\nMoney and Investing: Every day; covers and analyzes international financial markets (the third section was launched October 3, 1988)\n\nPersonal Journal: Published Tuesday through Thursday; covers personal investments, careers and cultural pursuits (the section was introduced April 9, 2002)\n\nOff Duty: Published Saturdays in WSJ Weekend; focuses on fashion, food, design, travel and gear/tech.

Jenkins Jr.\n\nThursdays: Wonder Land by Daniel Henninger\n\nFridays: Potomac Watch by Kimberley Strassel\n\nWeekend Edition: Rule of Law, The Weekend Interview (variety of authors), Declarations by Peggy Noonan\n\nIn addition to editorials and columns from the printed newspaper, wsj.com carries two daily web-only opinion columns:\n\nBest of the Web Today by James Taranto, the editor of the former OpinionJournal.com website (no subscription required).[69]\n\nPolitical Diary edited by Holman W. Jenkins Jr. and featuring John Fund (separate subscription required).\n\nIn addition to these regular opinion pieces, on Fridays the Journal publishes a religion-themed op-ed, titled \"Houses of Worship\", written by a different author each week. Authors range from the Dalai Lama to cardinals.\n\nWSJ.\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: WSJ.\n\nWSJ. is The Wall Street Journal's luxury lifestyle magazine. Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Sarah Ball is Editor in Chief and Omblyne Pelier is Publisher.[70]\n\nLaunched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014.[71] The magazine is inserted into the weekend U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal and is available on WSJ.com and in the newspaper's iPad app.\n\nPenélope Cruz, Carmelo Anthony, Woody Allen, Scarlett Johansson, Emilia Clarke, Daft Punk, and Gisele Bündchen have all been featured on the cover.\n\nIn 2012, the magazine launched its Innovator Awards program. An extension of the November Innovators issue, the awards ceremony, held in New York City at Museum of Modern Art, honors visionaries across the fields of design, fashion, architecture, humanitarianism, art and technology.\n\nIn 2013, Adweek named WSJ. the \"Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year\" in its annual Hot List.[72]\n\nOpinionJournal.com\n\n[edit]\n\nOpinionJournal.com was a website featuring content from the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal. It existed separately from the news content at wsj.com until January 2008, when it was merged into the main website.[73] The editorials (titled \"Review & Outlook\") reflected The Journal's conservative political editorial line, as did its regular columnists, who included Peggy Noonan, John Fund, and Daniel Henninger.\n\nWSJ Noted.\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 30, 2020, the Journal launched WSJ Noted., a monthly digital \"news and culture\" magazine for subscribers aged 18–34 in a bid to attract a younger audience to the Journal. The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As with Noted staff.[54]\n\nEditorial board\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board members oversee the Journal's editorial page, dictating the tone and direction of the newspaper's opinion section. The Wall Street Journal does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page, appear on Fox News Channel's Journal Editorial Report, where they discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958–1971) and Robert Bartley (served 1972–2000) provided a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.[74]\n\nContrasts have been noted between the Journal's news reporting and its editorial pages.[75] \"While Journal reporters keep busy informing readers,\" wrote one reporter in 1982, \"Journal editorial writers put forth views that often contradict the paper's best reporting and news analysis.\"[76] Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the Columbia Journalism Review[77] criticized the Journal's editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. One reference work in 2011 described the editorial pages as \"rigidly neoconservative\" while noting that the news coverage \"has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes\".[78]\n\nIn July 2020, more than 280 Journal journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages' \"lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence\", adding that \"opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by WSJ reporting.\"[79][80] The editorial board responded that its opinion pages \"won't wilt under cancel-culture pressure\" and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the Journal's news content and offer alternative views to \"the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today's media.\"[81] The board's response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter.[82]\n\nEditorial positions\n\n[edit]\n\nEconomic\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.[83]\n\nIn the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates.[84]\n\nPolitical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Journal's editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles.[85] Despite this, the Journal refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928.[86]\n\nThe editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.[87]\n\nThe Journal's editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill.[88] The Journal's editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy.[89][90][91]\n\nOn October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia.[92] In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation.[93][94] The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within The Wall Street Journal, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.[93][94][95]\n\nIn October 2021, the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages. Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election.[96][97][98] The next day, the editorial board published their own critique of Trump's letter.[99]\n\nScientific\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Journal editorial pages were described as a \"forum for climate change denial\" in 2011 due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud.[100][101] A 2011 study found that the Journal was alone among major American print news media in how, mainly in its editorial pages, it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether.[102] That year, the Associated Press described the Journal's editorial pages as \"a place friendly to climate change skeptics\".[103] In 2013, the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama's plan to address climate change, mostly without mentioning climate science.[104] A 2015 study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.[102]\n\nClimate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, determined that multiple opinion articles range between \"low\" and \"very low\" in terms of scientific credibility.[105][106] The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in 2016 that 14% of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of \"mainstream climate science\", while the majority did not. The Partnership also determined that none of the 201 editorials concerning climate change that were published in The Wall Street Journal since 1997 conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.[107]\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Journal published numerous opinion columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second-hand smoke,[108][109][110] acid rain, and ozone depletion,[111] in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos.[112][113][114][115][116] The Journal later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful, a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments.[117]\n\nPolitical views\n\n[edit]\n\nIts reporting has been described as \"small-c conservatism\".[75] Some of the Journal's former reporters[who?] say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.[118]\n\nBias in news pages\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-Murdoch ownership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Journal's editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.[35] According to CNN in 2007, the Journal's \"newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.\"[119] Ben Smith of the New York Times described the Journal's news reporting as \"small-c [conservative]\", and noted that its readership leans further to the right than other major newspapers.[120]\n\nIn a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo argue the Journal's news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of the Journal was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or The New York Times). The study did not factor in editorials.[121] Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that \"the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.\" The authors assume that \"think tank ideology ... only matters to liberals.\"[122]\n\nThe company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch.[123] An August 1, 2007, editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to \"maintain the values and integrity of the Journal\".[124]\n\nDuring Trump presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the Journal leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom[who?], who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid.[125] Particularly controversial was the Journal's November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's false claim that \"millions of people\" had voted illegally in the election, only noting that the statement was \"without corroboration\".[125]\n\nAlso controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to Journal editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase \"seven majority-Muslim countries\" when writing about Trump's executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note \"clarifying that there was 'no ban'\" on the phrase, \"but that the publication should 'always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.'\"[125]\n\nAt a town-hall-style meeting with Journal staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being \"dragged into the political process\" through a dispute with the Trump administration.[125]\n\nA 2018 survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that The Wall Street Journal was considered the third most-accurate and fourth most-unbiased news organization among the general public, tenth among Democrats, and second among Republicans.[126]\n\nOn February 19, 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing. China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible.[127]\n\nIn June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the Journal sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance. The reporters stated that they \"frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources' credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities\".[128]\n\nNotable stories\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Journal has won 38 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.\n\n1987: RJR Nabisco buyout\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO.[129]\n\n1988: Insider trading\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s, then-Journal reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg,[130] who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his 1991 book, Den of Thieves.[131]\n\n1997: AIDS treatment\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement.[132] He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.[133]\n\n2000: Enron\n\n[edit]\n\nJonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of The Wall Street Journal, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000.[134] Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly,[135] and wrote a book, 24 Days. In October 2021, the Journal released Bad Bets, a podcast that recounted the papers reporting on Enron.[136]\n\n2001: 9/11\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Journal claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.[137] Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.[138] Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey,[138] who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal's offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.[139]\n\nThe Journal subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from The Wall Street Journal bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.[140] It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.\n\n2007: Stock option scandal\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic gold medal,[141] for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.\n\n2008: Bear Stearns fall\n\n[edit]\n\nKate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns.[142][143][144]\n\n2010: McDonald's health care\n\n[edit]\n\nA report[145] published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report \"speculative and misleading\", stating they had no plans to drop coverage.[146] The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.[147][148][149]\n\n2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, a report[150] published by The Journal alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper. The Journal's reporting on the 1MDB scandal was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.[151]\n\nThe report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation. On July 28, 2020, Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1MDB scandal. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.[152]\n\n2015–present: Theranos investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, a report written by the Journal's John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors.[153][154][155] According to Vanity Fair, \"a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham—that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment.\"[154] The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility.[156][157] In May 2018, Carreyrou released a book about Theranos, Bad Blood, which met with critical success (and was compared to Stewart's Den of Thieves[158]). The following month, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges in relation to her role as CEO of Theranos.[159] Holmes was found guilty on four of the eleven original charges in January 2022.[160]\n\nRupert Murdoch—at the time a major investor in Theranos and owner of the Journal—lost approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos.[161]\n\n2018–present: Investigation into Stormy Daniels payment\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in The Wall Street Journal that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair. In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered. In April of that year, FBI agents stormed Cohen's home, seizing records related to the transaction.[162] On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment.[163] The coverage earned the Journal the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.[164]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from 2021 Facebook leak.\n\nIn 2021, an internal document leak from the company then known as Facebook (now Meta Platforms, or Meta) showed it was aware of harmful societal effects from its platforms, yet persisted in prioritizing profit over addressing these harms. The leak, released by whistleblower Frances Haugen, resulted in reporting from The Wall Street Journal in September, as The Facebook Files series, as well as the Facebook Papers, by a consortium of news outlets the next month.\n\nPrimarily, the reports revealed that, based on internally-commissioned studies, the company was fully aware of negative impacts on teenage users of Instagram, and the contribution of Facebook activity to violence in developing countries. Other takeaways of the leak include the impact of the company's platforms on spreading false information, and Facebook's policy of promoting inflammatory posts. Furthermore, Facebook was fully aware that harmful content was being pushed through Facebook algorithms reaching young users. The types of content included posts promoting anorexia nervosa and self-harm photos.\n\nIn October 2021, Whistleblower Aid filed eight anonymous whistleblower complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on behalf of Haugen alleging securities fraud by the company, after Haugen leaked the company documents the previous month.[166][167] After publicly revealing her identity on 60 Minutes,[169] Haugen testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security about the content of the leaked documents and the complaints.[170] After the company renamed itself as Meta Platforms,[171] Whistleblower Aid filed two additional securities fraud complaints with the SEC against the company on behalf of Haugen in February 2022.[172]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong Journalists Association\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2024 Wall Street Journal editors learned that WSJ journalist Selina Cheng was a candidate for the leadership role, or Chair, of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, the local press union. Cheng's editor demanded that she withdraw from the election and from participation in the union. However, the right to stand for election and participate in a union without employer consent are established under Hong Kong employment law. Cheng did not withdraw and was elected to the leadership role.[173][174][175][176] In July 2024, Wall Street Journal chief editor Gordon Fairclough travelled to Hong Kong and fired her from her role at the WSJ. In response to press queries, the WSJ declined to comment on Cheng's case except to acknowledge there had been 'restructuring'. Cheng responded that the restructuring was a layoff of one person.[177]\n\nThe WSJ's action against Cheng attracted a storm of criticism from media organisations, press unions and Human Rights Proponents across the globe.[178][179][180] Media organisations issuing critical statements include International Federation of Journalists,[181] Reporters Without Borders (RSF), PEN America,[182] IFEX,[183] Columbia Journalism School,[184] Index on Censorship,[185] International Women's Media Foundation, Women in Journalism, Asian American Journalists Association,[186] Coalition for Women in Journalism[187] and Media Action Plan.[188] Statements of support were issued by unions representing WSJ employees in the US (Newsguild[189] and IAPE TNG/CWA1096[190]) and UK (Society of Professional Journalists[191]). Foreign Correspondents Clubs and Organisations across Hong Kong,[192] China, Japan[193] the Philippines also voiced support. Human Rights organisations including Human Rights Watch, Hong Kong Watch,[194] Human Rights Foundation, Article 19,[195] HK Labour Rights Monitor,[196] Hong Kong Centre for Human Rights issued statements of concern.\n\nChinese state media, meanwhile, celebrated Cheng's sacking, with the Global Times tabloid calling the press union \"a malignant tumour that harms the city's safety and security\".[197] When Hong Kong's Security Minister made a similar statement, Cheng responded that The Wall Street Journal fired her to avoid advocating press freedom in the city.[198][199]\n\nIn a series of articles on News Corp, Australian online news outlet Crikey described Cheng's firing as part of \"turmoil\" at the WSJ and that \"the global purging of newsrooms is as much about creating a politically correct workforce of reliable journalistic cadres as it is about simply saving costs.\"[200]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nJournalism portal\n\nNew York City portal\n\nWilliam Peter Hamilton\n\nThe Economic Times\n\nFar Eastern Economic Review\n\nIndex of Economic Freedom – an annual report published by the Journal together with The Heritage Foundation\n\nLucky duckies\n\nMedia in New York City\n\nOn the Money (2013 TV series) – the current title of a CNBC-produced program known as The Wall Street Journal Report from 1970 until the CNBC/Dow Jones split in January 2013.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Special Editions\n\nWall Street Journal Radio Network\n\nWorth Bingham Prize\n\nBillion dollar whale\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
