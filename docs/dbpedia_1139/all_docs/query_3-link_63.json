        "text": "Bloomberg Philanthropies is donating $1 billion to Johns Hopkins University. The gift will allow the university to offer free tuition to medical students whose families earn less than $300,000 annually, starting with the fall semester this year. In addition, the university will cover living expenses such as rent for medical students from families that earn up to $175,000 a year. The university said nearly two-thirds of current and entering medical students will immediately qualify for either free tuition or free tuition plus living expenses. The endowment will also be used to increase graduate financial aid in the university’s school of public health and school of nursing and other graduate programs. According to Becker’s Hospital Review, the average debt of graduating medical students in 2020 was approximately $207,000. Bloomberg Philanthropies donated $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University in 2018 to assist low- and moderate-income undergraduate students.\n\nExecutive Moves\n\nCedars Sinai Health System will have a new CEO starting Oct. 1. Dr. Peter Slavin, who served as president of Massachusetts General Hospital from 2003 to 2021, will take the helm when Thomas Priselac retires. Priselac has been with the Los Angeles-based nonprofit health system for 45 years and has served as president and CEO for the last 30 years, according to the announcement.\n\nDr. Imran Andrabi assumed the role of president and CEO at Froedtert ThedaCare Health in Milwaukee on July 1, the health system announced. Froedtert Health combined with ThedaCare in January, with a plan for Dr. Andrabi, who previously was president and CEO of ThedaCare, to serve as president of the combined organization for six months and for Cathy Jacobson, who previously was president and CEO of Froedtert Health, to serve as CEO of the combined organization for six months and then retire."
