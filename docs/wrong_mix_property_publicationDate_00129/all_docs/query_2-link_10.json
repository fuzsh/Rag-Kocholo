        "text": "Information about John Boyd is unfortunately, extremely sparse. Indeed, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that his name was actually James. In any event, Boyd was probably a landowner in South Carolina. At some point after the British capture of New York City, Boyd traveled north and met with Sir Henry Clinton, receiving a commission and orders to form a loyalist regiment in the South. In November 1778, Boyd accompanied Col. Archibald Campbellâ€™s expedition to Savannah, Georgia, which was captured by British forces on December 29, 1778. After Campbell followed up his victory by moving inland and capturing Augusta, Georgia, Boyd was dispatched north to raise of force of Loyalists in the Carolinas. He was attacked at Kettle Creek on his return journey after completing his recruitment expedition. Boyd was buried in an unmarked grave on the Kettle Creek battle site.\n\nSuccess!\n\nAn access link has been emailed to you.
