He was the son of Robert Boyd. The family emigrated from the Province of Ulster, Ireland before 1750. They first settled near present day Salisbury, North Carolina.\n\nAt the time of his death, John Boyd lived in today's Lincoln County and/or Catawba County, North Carolina. John Boyd died at the American Revolutionary War Battle of Kings Mountain. The battle took place on 7 October 1780, 9 miles (14 km) south of the present-day town of Kings Mountain, North Carolina in what is now rural Cherokee County, South Carolina.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain\n\nIn 1756, Fort Dobbs was built about twenty miles west of Salisbury, North Carolina for the protection of isolated settlers. But, due to the numerous depredations and occasional murders, many of these settlers sought refuge elsewhere until the Indian matter had been settled. Thus, we find the Boyds removal to Augusta County, Virginia where they are found near the Ramsey's in the North River Settlement of the Shenandoah on the head of Fischer's Creek. This tract of land was patented to Robert Boyd on 20 Sept 1768, and was later sold by John Boyd, heir of Robert Boyd, to Joseph Douglas on 8 May 1776.\n\nJohn married Miss Mary Buchanan of Augusta County, Virginia. John Boyd and his sister Maria Agnes \"Nancy\" Boyd and her husband William Ramsay settled on the Gum Branch of Long Creek, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina by 1769. (Most likely, James son of William Ramsey and Agnes-Maria Boyd, was born in the North River settlement of Augusta County, Virginia prior to his parents joining the migration to Mecklenburg County, North Carolina with the family of James' uncle, John Boyd.) https://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:James_Ramsey_%2828%29\n\nOn 10 Jan 1771, John Boyd and William Ramsey witnessed a deed from James and Sarah Tom to James Douglas for 200 acres on both sides of Long Creek, which included Miller's improvements and adjacent to John Anderson's line. On 1 Jan 1783, William Ramsey and John Johnston witnessed a deed from David McCord to John Buchannan for 200 acres on both sides of Long Creek about a half mile west of Tools' Road. This land was originally patented to John Moore in 1763, and sold to David McCord in 1772.\n\nOn 30 September 1773, John Boyd conveyed his 300-acre land grant on Long Creek to William Ramsey located on both sides of Long Creek, including the forks to Tools' old fording and John Moore's line, crossing the creek and joining the land of James Douglass. The name \"Tool's Fording\" originated from Matthew Toole, an early settler during the 1750's. He had lived on the eastern bank of the Catawba River near Long Creek and became a well-known Indian interpreter. He lived among the Catawba and married the daughter of King Haigler. https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Toole-733 http://www.scgenweb.org/lancaster/bios/bio_newriver.htm\n\nBy 1779, John Boyd had moved across the Catawba River into Lincoln County, North Carolina. A deed dated 18 June 1779, shows John Boyd of Lincoln County, son and heir of Robert Boyd, decd., deeding to John Johnston 150 acres on Gum Branch of Long Creek, adjacent to the land where William Ramsay now lives and land of Patrick Sullivan. William Ramsey, Patrick Sullivan and David Rodgers were witnesses on this deed. John Anderson deeded this land on Gum Branch to Robert Boyd in 1759, which until 1762 was in Anson County, North Carolina, and still part of the Western frontier of North Carolina. It continued to be claimed by the Western Tribe of the Cherokee Indians as their territory. https://services.dar.org/Public/DAR_Research/search_adb/?action=full&p_id=A110863\n\nReports of British atrocities after the Battle of Waxhaw Creek on 29 May 1780 and the massacre of Colonel Abraham Buford's men galvanized reluctant frontiersmen in the backcountry of the Carolinas to support the Revolutionary War. To quote Dr. Bobby Gilmer Moss, \"The Scots-Irish in the South are descendants of the defenders of Londonderry and Enniskillen. They have fighting in their blood. They are born warriors.\" Colonel Issac Shelby and Colonel John Sevier relayed the threat of Major Patrick Ferguson to all frontiersmen in the Blue Ridge settlements that Ferguson was going to subject their homes to \"fire and sword\". On 25 September 1780, the Overmountain men rendezvoused at Sycamore Shoals on the Watauga River. They came with their long rifles, their horses, their determination, and their seething anger.\n\nJohn Boyd was killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain on 7 October 1780\n\nWhile approaching the battleground, Lincoln County commander Colonel William Graham was called away (Draper 1881, 232). Command was reassigned to Major William Chronicle. Lincoln County men marched to the furthest side where they blocked the only road escape. Historian Lyman Draper wrote about the Lincoln County men, nicknamed the ―South Fork Boys.‖\n\nMajor [William] Chronicle and Lieutenant Colonel [Frederick] Hambright led their little band of South Fork boys up the north-east end of the mountain, where the ascent was more abrupt than elsewhere, save where Campbell’s men made their attack. As they reached the base of the ridge, with Chronicle some ten paces in advance of his men, he raised his military hat, crying out—\"Face to the hill!‖ He had scarcely uttered his command, when a ball struck him, and he fell; and William Rabb, within some six feet of Chronicle, was killed almost instantly thereafter. The men steadily pressed on, under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Hambright, Major Joseph Dickson, and Captains Mattocks, Johnson, White, Espey and Martin—a formidable list of officers for so small a body of men; but they all took their places in the line, and fought with determined heroism. Before they reached the crest of the mountain, the enemy charged bayonet— said to have been led by DePeyster—first firing off their guns, by which, Robert Henry supposed that Captain Mattocks and John Boyd were killed, and William Gilmer, a brother of the noted scout, and John Chittim wounded—the latter of Captain Martin’s company, was shot in his side, making an orifice, through which, according to tradition, a silk handkerchief could be drawn, and yet he recovered, living to a good old age. (Draper 1881, 257). https://q.bstatic.com/data/bsuitewf/ec2445bbf1494f90ceaf060252ba85aee84855cd.pdf\n\nhttps://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/OCA/Books2012-06/kingsmountainits00drap/kingsmountainits00drap.pdf John Boyd killed, pages 302, 322, 596\n\nhttps://www.obcgs.com/battle-of-kings-mountain/\n\nIn September 1780, Lt. Colonel William C. Campbell led his regiment on a march from Southwest Virginia to Kings Mountain, North Carolina. There on October 7, 1780, Col. Campbell lead his regiments in the Battle of Kings Mountain, defeating the British Forces lead by Major Patrick Ferguson. The victory by Col. Campbell destroyed the left wing of Cornwallis’s Army and forced the British to retreat from Charlotte into South Carolina.\"\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson wrote the following after the Battle of Kings Mountain: I remember well the deep and grateful impression made on the minds of everyone by that memorable victory. It was the joyful annunciation of that turn of the tide of success which terminated the Revolutionary War with the seal of our independence.\n\nThe Over Mountain Men and the Long Rifle\n\nThe Over Mountain Men's advantage was a superior weapon. The Long Rifle (later called the Kentucky Rifle) followed the immigration along the Old Wagon Road out of Pennsylvania, through Virginia, into North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\n\n“Long, slim, elegant, the American rifle at its best was a masterpiece of the gunsmith’s craft.” ‘Fresh Prime Your Guns’: Leading The Over Mountain Men, July 15, 2017, by JimC\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_rifle\n\n\"These fighters resembled the Boer Commandos of the next century. The Over Mountain Men and their Back Country comrades “neither had nor needed an administrative structure.” Each man “had a rolled blanket, a cup, and saddle bags filled with food.” The horses would find their own forage. Along with tomahawks and knives, they carried the “Kentucky rifle.” Most actually were made in Pennsylvania by German gunsmith Jacob Dickert, famous “for the accuracy of his barrels. . . . It was “deadly at 200 yards in the hands of an expert marksman….””\"\n\nhttps://frontierpartisans.com/11066/fresh-prime-guns-leading-mountain-men/\n\nLoading the Kentucky Long Rifle.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://bkmnp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Boyd-John.pdf\n\nDedication date: July 4, 1815 Materials & Techniques: Slate Sponsor: Dr. William McLean of Lincoln County, North Carolina Unveiling & Dedication: Dr. William McLean of Lincoln County, North Carolina erected this marker at his own expense on July 4, 1815.\n\nSubject notes: Considered the earliest commemorative activity at Kings Mountain as well as the second oldest Revolutionary War monument in the country, this stone known as the Old Chronicle Marker was erected by Dr. William McLean to honor his fallen comrades Captain John Mattocks, William Rabb, John Boyd, and William Chronicle and to the memory of Major General Ferguson, an officer in the British army. McLean was a Revolutionary War veteran, having served under Major General Nathanael Greene. At the time McLean visited the site and dedicated the marker, he was running for Congress. https://www.ncpedia.org/monument/kings-mountain-1815\n\nNote: A photo of the above monument also appears at: https://www.ncpedia.org/monument/kings-mountain-1815\n\nSome sources indicate that all four men listed on the Chronicle Monument fell in the same volley: William Chronicle, John Mattocks, William Rabb, and John Boyd. It was said that a very young Dr. McLean (who built the marker) might have been at the battle, but given how young he would have been in 1780 it is more likely that he only knew of his fellow Lincoln County Patriots, or at least their families. Traditionally the marker was thought to be a gravestone, with all four named casualties buried underneath or nearby. Archeology efforts have proven that false. The actual final resting place of each man listed is unknown, but the marker was erected near where they fell at the northeast end of the battlefield. Notes from Kings Mt.

Hammett, Coordinator\n\nThe most obvious reason, one that has been ignored by many historians, is that the Overmountain Men had no choice but to fight and to win—--not if they wanted to remain Overmountain.\n\nThe Overmountain Counties of Washington and Sullivan, North Carolina (present-day Tennessee) did not even exist until enacted by North Carolina's Revolutionary government (whose land policies, from the beginning, ignored both Royal Grants and Indian Treaties). With the exception of a few families who lived \"North of Holston\" on land earlier granted by Virginia Colony, the remainder of those who lived Overmountain were Intruders (white settlers on either Indian or Granville lands)—at least in the eyes of the British. And even the North of Holston settlers were actually Intruders, or would have become such once the North Carolina provincial government had figured out their land wasn't in Virginia.\n\nA British victory would have most certainly resulted in the majority of the Overmountain men being ousted from their lands—assuming they hadn't already been hung by Ferguson. Clearly, neither was an \"option.\" (3)\n\nTwo additional factors must also be entered into the equation of how and why the Overmountain men responded so strongly pro-Rebel : (a) They had chosen to live Overmountain, and this fact alone predisposed them toward independence—at every level; and (b) They were hunters and killers by nature: This was how they survived, how they fed their families (man does not live by corn crops alone). (4)\n\nInsofar as the Rebel leaders were concerned, regardless of where they lived, whether east or west of the Blue Ridge, victory had become a requirement—if there was to be Life After War As We Want It. North Carolina's Revolutionary government, including the counties of Sullivan and Washington, had been actively confiscating the estates of all Tories. (5) Would the British do the same if they regained control? All of the leaders, and many of their men (particularly land-owners) had taken positions so strong that there would be no going back if the British won, nor even if they \"half-won,\" a possibility that had become a strong rumor during the summer after the Rebel defeats at Charlotte and Camden (the only two Major battles in the South in 1780—both of them lost). https://www.tngenweb.org/revwar/kingsmountain/history.html\n\nhttps://www.historynet.com/the-overmountain-men-battle-for-the-carolinas.htm\n\nRef: Brig. Gen. William C. Campbell, Commander, Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Campbell-1786 Note: Campbell was married to Elizabeth Henry, sister of Virginia Governor, Patrick Henry (\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\"). Campbell Co., VA and William Campbell High School are named after William Campbell. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Campbell_(general)\n\nHistorical Context for the Campbells, Seviers, Logans, Knox and others who left for the Holston in the fall of 1769. https://archive.org/details/annalsofaugustac00wadd/page/326/mode/2up Page 326\n\nLyman Draper, Kings Mountain and Its Heroes: History of the Battle of King's Mountain, October 7, 1780, and the Events Which Led to It, (Overmountain Press, 2nd edition, January 1, 1996).\n\nWilma Dykeman, With fire and sword : the Battle of Kings Mountain, 1780, (United States. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 1978).\n\nBobby Gilmer Moss, The Patriots at Kings Mountain (Scotia-Hibernia Press, Blacksburg, S.C.,1990).\n\nThe nickname “South Fork Boys” was a reference to the South Fork of the Catawba River where some of these Lincoln County Men lived. However, not all lived there including the leaders William Graham and Frederick Hambright. Also, this expression does not appear once in approximately 20,000 transcribed pension applications dated from 1832–1850 (Graves and Harris 2005–2015). Apparently, it appeared first about 1850 in Robert Henry’s narrative (Henry 1850 in Schenck 1891, 34–36) and repeated in Draper’s book of 1881 (Draper 1881, 257). Some historians apply this nickname strictly to Major William Chronicle’s company of 18 men, not all of whom were in the battle (Hall 1965). But even with this interpretation, the nickname is imprecise because some of these men’s homes, including Chronicle’s, were in the Catawba River watershed. So, in summary, the nickname “South Fork Boys” first arose about 70 years after Kings Mountain and has been used ambiguously ever since. Arguably, the name Lincoln County Men is more descriptive since it explicitly associates with the organization’s actual identity, the Lincoln County Militia. It is also a name the actual participants would have recognized. Page 28\n\nhttp://www.elehistory.com/amrev/LincolnCountyMenAtKingsMountain.pdf\n\nRobert M.

There were herds of fleet-footed deer; there were clumsy brown bears and fierce wild cats and panthers; there were droves of buffalo, and countless beavers building their dams on the creeks. The early settlers waged a relentless war on these animals and set a bounty on many of their scalps. The scalps on which a price was set were the wolf, panther, wild cat, and such other as preyed on domestic animals. For killing a grown wolf the price was one pound; a young wolf ten shillings; a wild cat five shillings. The claims filed in court were for \"scalp tickets.\" As late as October Sessions, 1774, there were audited in favor of individuals forty-nine \"wolf scalp tickets.\" We still retain Indian, Beaver Dam, and Buffalo Creeks, Bear Ford, Wolf Gulch, and Buffalo Mountain, Buffalo Shoals, and the Indian names Catawba and Tuckaseegee, memorials of these primeval days. http://files.usgwarchives.net/nc/lincoln/history/other/nixon.txt\n\nJohn Boyd is often confused and conflated with John Boyd born 1746 Renfrewshire, Scotland who settled on the South Fork of the Catawba River in Lincoln County, North Carolina. https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boyd-13847\n\nYouTube Video of Patriot John Boyd\n\nPatriot John Boyd - Battle of Kings Mountain - Revolutionary War - Long Hunter - Overmountain Men.mp4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCGCYL47ORc\n\nFind A Grave Memorial\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13700685/john-boyd"
