        "text": "By Richard Gwynallen\n\nRobert Boyd\n\n1728 – 1806\n\nEleanor McCullock\n\n1732 – 1819\n\nRelationship to Fawn: 6th great-grandparents\n\nI had heard about a Boyd farm in County Tyrone in Ulster and another in Lancaster County,\n\nPennsylvania. Various branches of our family are connected to both those areas. So, I was wondering if there might be a relationship between those farms and our family. I was trying to find information about those possibilities while also casually searching around for anything about an old Boyd homestead in North Carolina. Nothing was coming up on those accounts, but I did run across the document, Two Lines of Boyd Crossing Paths in the Frontier, complied by the Rev. Christian D. Boyd of the Newton County Missouri Boyds.\n\nThe following will refer to many different relationships within our family, but I identified Robert and Eleanor above because that is the marriage in this country from which our Boyd line descends.\n\nRev. Boyd noted that the ancestry information in Two Lines of Boyd Crossing Paths in the Frontier was “pieced together from family history given by the children and grandchildren of John Boyd, son of Robert and Eleanor of Iredell Co., NC, and the research forged by Linda Lawhon and others in the Boyd family, as well as Ewing clan.” It’s a nice find for amateurs like me when the work of experienced genealogical researchers and holders of family history have some of their work compiled.\n\nI’ll focus here on the items that build on our previous essay, Our Boyd Line. As a reminder, in that essay we identified the immigrant ancestor as Robert Boyd who came to Pennsylvania from Ireland with two sons, William and Robert. It is his son Robert from whom we are directly descended. One small point we learned from this compilation was that Robert had “raven locks.” His brother William was a red head for those who might be curious. It’s a small thing, but it gives a little bit more of a picture of someone for whom we have no picture.\n\nLocating where Robert and Eleanor lived in North Carolina\n\nAs we know, Robert (the son) married Eleanor McCullock, and they would remove to what was Burke County and would become Iredell County, North Carolina.\n\nFrom this compilation we learn that Robert and his family “settled along the Muddy Fork of the Lower Little River and acres on Lower Little River including the Big Falls and his own improvements for complement. Present day, this parcel is located northwest of Taylorsville, NC, in Alexander Co., with HWY 16 running through it.”\n\nWe also learn from these accounts that Robert and Eleanor operated a mill, most likely a grist mill, on Lower Little River during the Revolutionary War.\n\nMost of the early grist mills were replaced in the 1780s and 1790s with improved construction. I haven’t found any images of 18th century grist mills from Lower Little River, but the two pictured here offer an idea of what it may have looked like.\n\nMills of the time were frequently refitted over the years to serve many purposes in addition to milling grains; sawing wood, for instance. In addition to offering services needed in rural life, the mills were one of few places where the community gathered to reinforce relationships, share news, and discuss matters of communal interest.\n\nFourth Creek Congregation connections\n\nRobert and Eleanor’s son, John (my 5th great-uncle), was born in 1764. This account gives Philadelphia as the place of his birth, as I have thought to date, but also indicates it could have been Richmond, Virginia as the family migrated south and was thought to have spent some time in Virginia, particularly Bedford County.\n\nJohn Boyd is listed on the 1810 Census as a head of household in Burke/Iredell County, North Carolina. He and his family appear in the records of the Fourth Creek Presbyterian Church in Iredell County, North Carolina.\n\nWe have seen Fourth Creek as a cradle of our family in previous essays involving the Mordah, Wasson, Milligan, Sloan, and Watt families. I had not seen confirmation that the Boyds were part of that community. Prior to this the only certain early congregation connection I knew of for the Boyds was the Concord Presbyterian Congregation. Robert and Eleanor’s grandson, Robert (my 3rd great-grandfather), is buried in the Concord Presbyterian Church cemetery, as are Nancy Angeline Boyd and John Murdock (my 2nd great-grandparents). Since Concord grew out of Fourth Creek I had thought that earlier Boyds might have been part of Fourth Creek, but didn’t have anything certain.\n\nTombstones in Concord Presbyterian Church Cemetery for\n\nJohn Franklin Murdock and Nancy Angeline Boyd.\n\nJohn Boyd’s grandson, James Hall, would become a well known minister of the Fourth Creek Congregation. I knew about Hall, but didn’t know there was a (distant) relationship to our family (2nd cousin 4x removed to me).\n\nAnother interesting intersection occurs here when a daughter of Alexander Witherspoon (a 6th great uncle to me), Martha (1st cousin 6x removed to me), married John’s nephew, John Boyd (1st cousin 5x removed to me), son of William (a 5th great-uncle to me). The comments in the document indicate that Alexander Witherspoon was also a Fourth Creek Congregation member.\n\nMigrations and connections – Related families?\n\nJohn Boyd and his wife, Elizabeth Ewing, and their family left North Carolina about 1811 and migrated to Logan County, Kentucky where they farmed and became active members of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. This document has much more information about John and his descendants, but I will not be including all that here as our direct ancestor remains in North Carolina.\n\nHowever, one matter I will explore is the possibility described in Rev. Boyd’s paper that the Boyds and Ewings, and through the Ewings another Boyd line, were related. It can be hard to follow. Bear with me.\n\nJohn and Elizabeth had 13 children. One was Hannah Ewing Boyd. Hannah stated that the Boyd farm in Logan County was adjacent to the farm of Rev. Finis Ewing and his brother, Chatham. She also claimed that her father, John Boyd, and Finis Ewing were cousins.\n\n“About 1817, John and ten of his children moved to Stewart Co., TN. There he purchased 271 acres on the north bank of Green Tree Grove Creek, about a mile south of the Trigg Co., Kentucky line, not too far from Canton, KY, which was founded by Finis’ nephew-in-law, Abraham Boyd. . . . By [the] 1850 [census], only Robert, John’s son, remained with his parents on the farm.”\n\nThis Abraham Boyd was married to Nancy Agnes Linn. Both Abraham and Nancy were born in Bedford County, Virginia in 1765. They married on 1 April 1794 in Davis County, Tennessee She was the daughter of Adam Linn who lived in Bedford County, Virginia during the Revolutionary War. (Source: A Jessamine County, Kentucky database, drawing this information from The Wilford-Williford Family Treks Into America, Vol. 2 by Eurie Pearl Wilford Neel, Nashville, TN, Rich Printing Co., pp. 108-109.)\n\nAbraham was a contemporary of John Boyd. Abraham’s grandfather William also emigrated from Ireland to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania about 1718. He later settled in Bedford County, Virginia enroute to South Carolina. Abraham migrated to Tennessee where he married Nancy Agnes Linn, then settled on the banks of the Cumberland River in West Kentucky at a spot known as Boyd’s Landing in 1785. In 1800, he donated land for the town of Canton, Trigg County, Kentucky.\n\n“Traces of rude log cabins were found in many places along the Cumberland River when the first permanent settlers came, and the belief is current that families of trappers and adventurers made this a rendezvous many years before any effort was made to open up and improve the country. As early as 1799, a party of emigrants . . . . [that was the] family of Abraham Boyd . . . a native of North Carolina but had been a resident of Tennessee in the neighborhood of Nashville for a number of years, and removed thence to the point above stated. The trip must have been made in flat-boats, for there were no roads, and an old settler remarked that he assisted them in cutting a road through and it took several days to complete it. He erected his first dwelling on the ground where the present church stands. His father-in-law, Adam Linn, Jr. accompanied him and made a settlement three miles out from the river on the Luster place.” Adam Linn, Jr.’s father, Adam Linn, was born in Ireland, possibly Belfast, about 1720.\n\nAbraham’s wife, Nancy Agnes Linn was also of Irish descent. Her mother, Sidney Ann, was a Ewing who had run away and married a native Irishman named Adam Linn, last residing in Belfast, against her parents wishes. Quite the scandal.\n\nThe compilation notes that Abraham Boyd’s family was also of interest. His parents were James and Martha Burns. “Abraham’s mother was born between 1735 and 1740 and was a close “blood kin” to poet Robert Burns (1759-1796), born in Ayershire, Scotland.” Not that important to our essay here, but a fun note.\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is nothing conclusive to prove Hannah Boyd’s assertion that our Robert Boyd’s line is related to the Ewings and the line of Boyds brought to the colonies by William Boyd, grandfather of Abraham Boyd, though there s also nothing to indicate a reason she would have been misled on the point. However, what this document describes is a pattern of migration that places all these families in similar geographic areas. As it concludes, “It is interesting to see the migration pattern of various Boyd families related to Robert and Eleanor and of William and Elizabeth. Where Abraham Boyd went, not too far in his tracks were also the sons and grandsons of Robert.” All the families spent time in and around Philadelphia; Bedford County, Virginia; Tennessee; Logan County, Kentucky; and Trigg County, Kentucky.\n\nIn any case, we have a few new details added to our knowledge of the Boyds. We know Robert had “raven locks,” Robert and Eleanor settled on Lower Little River in Burke/Iredell County, North Carolina, ran a mill on on the river during the Revolutionary War, and were part of the Fourth Creek Presbyterian Congregation.\n\nBy Richard Gwynallen\n\nRobert Boyd\n\n1728 – 1806\n\nRelationship to Fawn: 6th great grandfather\n\nIn The McCulloch Journey to America, we introduced the Boyds when Robert Boyd married Eleanor McCullock. In this essay I want to look at Robert Boyd’s line of descent, and where our Boyd-McCullock family migrated here in America.\n\nWe do not know exactly where or when Robert and Eleanor married. Some believe they immigrated separately and married about 1752 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Others believe they married in Ireland. There is no proof of either. However, they seem to have had their first child, William, in 1754 in Pennsylvania. Their second child, Robert, also seems to have been born in Pennsylvania about 1757, and then Thomas, on 10 March 1761 in York County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe date and place of Thomas’ birth come from his application on 20 August 1833 for his pension for his service in the Revolutionary War:\n\nI was born on the 10th of March in the year 1761 in York\n\nCounty Pennsylvania according to the uniform statements of my Father and\n\nto the registry of my age which I have seen in my Father’s bible . . .\n\nBy the time Moses, the son we are descended from, was born in 1768 they were in North Carolina.\n\nThe Boyd Family\n\nThere is a family story among some Boyd descendants of Robert and Eleanor’s son Joseph, that Robert’s father, also named Robert, was born in Scotland and had migrated to Ireland as a weaver of silk and fine cloth. Robert apparently also learned the weaving trade, but emigrated to America when the Irish textile industry suffered a severe depression, which spurred significant Irish emigration. His father and some of his brothers emigrated with him.\n\nMike Boyd of the Historical Committee of the House of Boyd Society offers information from a book he purchased in 2010, Song with a Tenor Lead, The Story of Joseph William Boyd and Mary Cerena Hampton, with Ancestors and Descendants (Jim Boyd, 2002). This book claims that Robert was born in Scotland and met Eleanor, described as an Irish girl, on board ship to the American Colonies. This inclines one to believe that the ship sailed from an Irish port, whatever the circumstances might have been of Robert’s birth. The book claims that Eleanor’s father was a ship builder and owner, and was lost at sea in one of his boats. This does accord with the idea that Eleanor’s father was Robert MacCulloch on the Banffshire coast of Scotland, though the book also asserts that her father had moved to Ireland. In my mind, she remains a mystery, but this does add an interesting possibility. The book claims that Eleanor is thought to have come to America with friends, not in the company of family. Then: “A romantic relationship developed between Robert and Eleanor such that in 1752, about seven years after they arrived in America, they were married in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” Mike Boyd suggests that “the period of seven years poses a question: could it simply be a coincidence; or, since it is the usual term of servitude for indentured servants, could Robert have contracted out his services to pay for his passage.)” The same question could apply to Eleanor. Coming to the colonies without family it’s reasonable to think she could have arrived as an indentured servant as a way of paying her passage. She must have been very young, possible early teens.\n\nPhiladelphia in the 1750s\n\nIf Robert and Eleanor were in the Philadelphia area in the 1750s, what was happening around them when these ancestors of ours were marrying and starting a family?\n\nBy the 1750’s, Philadelphia was a busy commercial center. Benjamin Franklin was one of its most prominent citizens. During this time Franklin was named one of the city’s post master generals and created postal routs connecting major towns.\n\nThe first hospital in the colonies opened in 1752, the same year the College of Philadelphia received its charter of incorporation.\n\nThe French and Indian War began in 1754 and the city was attracting refugees from the western frontier. Militias were being raised.\n\nFrench and Spanish privateers were a threat and two batteries were created in the city for protection.\n\nPutting Down Roots in North Carolina\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century many Scots and Ulster Scots families that settled in Pennsylvania began to move toward North Carolina as land became harder to purchase in Pennsylvania for their expanding families. We first find a record of Robert Boyd and Eleanor McCullock when they moved to North Carolina, settling in Earl Granville’s District. When the Earl died in 1763 the district land offices were closed. The only way for a newcomer to buy land was from another person who had received land before this time. Many of the people in this frontier area were squatting on the land.\n\nWith the declaration of American independence, these lands were taken over by the North Carolina government and soon after, the land was available for purchase. In 1772, in Burke County, North Carolina, Robert appeared on a tax list of Walter Lindsey, living near the present day town of Taylorsville.\n\nThis is a bit of an aside, but occasionally one runs across small bits of life that give color to our ancestors’ everyday activity. There was such a small moment recorded for 1776 or 1777 referenced in Thomas Boyd’s 1833 application for his pension for his Revolutionary War service.\n\nThomas had a Mr. John Hereford testify on his behalf to establish further proof of his service. Hereford was a child at the time, but knew the Boyds well in Wilkes county, North Carolina having lived within a mile and a half of their home. The application records that Hereford, “recollects very well that Thomas Boyd came to this deponents house to get this Deponents mother to make him a napsack, the said Boyd’s mother having no daughters to help her though she had seven sons – and as there was a hurry Mr. Boyd got this Deponents mother to help him to fix it.”\n\nSo Thomas required a knapsack for provisions to go off and join the army, and he went to a neighbor to help him put it together. This fits with Thomas’s statement in the same application that he ran away from home to join the militia his brother had already enlisted in.\n\n“A brother of mine having volunteered, in order to go along with him, I ran away from my father, being about fifteen years old, in the same company which was commanded by one Captain James Morrison, our Lieut was named Samuel Carson.”\n\nIt sounds like Robert and Eleanor had not given permission for Thomas to go off and fight at his young age, but determined to go he ran away. That makes his visit to the neighbor a little more understandable than not having sisters to help him put the knapsack together.\n\nOn with our story.\n\nIt was not until 1778 that the Boyds are recorded as buying land. On 23 December 1778 in Burke Co., North Carolina, Robert Boyd received several grants:\n\nGrant #1569, was for 200 acres on the Muddy Fork of the Lower Little River.\n\nGrant # 1570, was for 200 acres on Lower Little River including the Big Falls and his own improvements for complement was transferred to John Cummins.\n\nGrant # 1571, 100 acres to Robert Boyd on Mountain Branch between John Smith’s and John Russell’s entry.\n\nThen on 27 November 1792 in Burke County, North Carolina:\n\nGrant # 1591, 200 acres on Little River on the south west side of Whitstone Hill including meadow ground for complement.\n\nGrant # 1545, to Robert Boyd Sr., 2 acres (sic–probably 200 acres) on both sides of the Muddy Fork on the waters of Little River, joining Watts and John Lutches [Leach, lbl]. Registered 16 May 1806.\n\nIn 1790, the area where Robert Boyd lived, north of Taylorsville, was listed in the census of Wilkes County. He was in the Morgan District, Fifteenth Company.\n\nIn 1791, in Wilkes County, North Carolina, Robert Boyd Sr., Robert Boyd, William Boyd, Moses Boyd, and Thomas Boyd are listed as separate landowners in Capt. Forrester’s District.\n\nIn 1792, in Wilkes County, North Carolina, Robert Boyd Sr., Robert Boyd, William Boyd, Moses Boyd, and Thomas Boyd are again listed in Capt. Forrester’s Dist. (14)·\n\nIn 1793, in Wilkes County, North Carolina, we have listed in Capt.Smith’s District (14) Robert Boyd Sr., Robert Boyd, Aaron Boyd, Moses Boyd, and Thomas Boyd.\n\nAfter that, they are found in the Iredell County records, where they were still well established as family farmers, the yeoman farmer class described in the essay From the Farm to the City, when Nancy Angeline Boyd married John Murdock in 1867.\n\nWILL OF ROBERT BOYD\n\n“In the name of God Amen. I Robert Boyd Senr. being in a\n\nsickly and Weakly state of health but of sound and perfect memory for the\n\npromoting of peace and preventing disputes and mistakes do make this as\n\nmy last Will and testament in manner following: First that of my goods\n\nand chattels, lands and tenements I will that all my just debts be all\n\npaid.

The estate papers\n\ninclude Eleanor Boyd’s estate delivered to Moses Boyd, Dec’d, in trust by\n\nRobert Boyd to Hannah Boyd, Admrx. of the estate of Moses Boyd, dec’d.\n\n“The amount of Elenor Boyds estate delivered to Moses Boyd Decd in trust\n\nby Robert Boyd, Exec. of Robert Boyd, dec’d on the 23rd of January 1812\n\nwas two hundred and sixty six dollars.” There were receipts from Joseph\n\nBoyd, Moses Boyd and Aaron Boyd.
