        "text": "The portrait above is often attributed to John BOYD Jr. However, it forms the frontispiece of [JBBC], which is about the descendants of John BOYD Sr. I would be grateful to anyone who can provide more information on this.\n\nJohn BOYD first appears in 1754, as owner of land consisting of 101 acres, about 5 miles west of Martinsburg, designated as Tract 801 in Tablers Station Quadrangle. He later acquired some of the adjacent properties. A map of this land appears in [JBBC, p. 7]. The property is on the southeast slope of North Mountain, which is a long ridge, running southwest to northeast, like many of the mountain ridges in this region.\n\nThis area was included in the part of Orange County, VA which became Frederick County, VA in 1743, and it was in the part of Frederick County, VA which became Berkeley County, VA, in 1772, and became Berkeley County, WV when WV was formed in 1863.\n\nJohn Boyd biography in Aler's History\n\nJOHN BOYD,\n\nFather of Gen. Elisha Boyd and a native of England, was one of the earliest settlers in the County of Berkeley. He acquired his land in this county by original grant from Lord Fairfax, the patents of which are still preserved by his descendants. He resided near the North Mountain, about five miles west of Martinsburg. He was a man of herculean frame of body, and some anecdotes are related of his hand to hand conflicts with the Indians, which demanded all his activity and strength, but in which he was generally victor.\n\nHe was married about the year 1754, to Sarah Gryfyth, a native of Wales, and died in the year 1800, leaving eight children, born in the following order, to wit : Charles, Margaret, Fulton, John, William, Rachel, Bayley, Elijah, Mary, Munford and Elisha ; the first born on the 13th of April, 1756, and the last on the 6th of October, 1769.\n\nHis widow, Sarah Boyd, survived him some years, dying in 1806. With the exception of Elisha, the children were among the earliest emigrants to Kentucky. It is said that Hon. Lenn Boyd, of Kentucky, for several years Speaker of the House of Representatives, was one of that stock, and his striking resemblance to Gen. Boyd in stature, feature and general appearance would seem to confirm that remark.\n\n[Note: the names Fulton, Bayley and Munford should probably be set in parentheses, if they were the married surnames of Margaret, Rachel and Mary. – W.H.]\n\nAler's History of Martinsburg and Berkeley County, West Virginia, by F.

Of course they are only guesses, and should not be taken too literally.\n\nAll the children of John and Sarah, except Elisha, the youngest, migrated to Kentucky. This must have been a hard time for the family. Mary BOYD died in 1800, and Elijah in 1803, then William died in 1805. Meanwhile, back in West Virginia, John BOYD Sr died in 1800, and his wife Sarah in 1806.\n\n4. William BOYD was born 17 Dec 1761 in Frederick County, VA. He first married Jane PARKS on 10 Nov 1796, Berkeley County, VA. They had no known children, and Jane probably died in 1798. William next married Alice \"Elcy\" GRAY in Berkeley County, 1 Apr 1798. Elcy GRAY was born about 1776, the daughter of Hugh and Elcy GRAY. William and Elcy had 2 children, both sons.\n\nBetween 1 Apr 1798 and 30 Jun 1800, William and Elcy moved to Nicholas County, KY, to join his brothers John and Elijah. William BOYD died in Apr 1805, in Kentucky, at age 43, when his sons were both under 5 years of age. Elcy (GRAY) BOYD remarried, had 5 more children, and died on 13 Aug 1838, in Nicholas, KY, at age about 62. [JBBC, p. 11]\n\nThere were 9 William BOYDs in the Kentucky Tax List of 1799-1801. Only one was in Nicholas County. He paid taxes in 1800.\n\nThe 2 known children of William BOYD and Elcy GRAY were both in Bath County by 1840, as the US Census has them both in the small town of Sharpsburg, about 1 mile from the Bath-Nicholas County line. The population of Sharpsburg was 158 in 1830, and Bath County had 8,799.\n\ni. Andrew BOYD was born 30 Jun 1800 in Nicholas, KY, and died 1 July 1881. [JBBC, p. 11] He married in 1824 to Nancy WITHERS, born 22 Apr 1803 and died 6 Apr 1878, daughter of James WITHERS and Nancy ELGIN. They lived in Sharpsburg, Bath County, KY, and had 1o children.\n\n5. Rachel BOYD was born 17 Aug 1763, probably on the BOYD farm near Martinsburg, then in Frederick County, VA, later in Berkeley County, VA (now WV). She married William H. BAILEY on 8 Aug 1793, in Martinsburg.\n\nWilliam Harrison BAILEY was born about 1760, probably in VA, the son of William BAILEY Sr, who wrote his will in 1817, in Nelson County, KY. In the will, William Sr named his sons, Thomas, Andrew and William H. He also named his daughter Ruth and her husband John MILLER and daughter Elizabeth and husband Joseph STANLEY. He named his grandchildren (the children of William H. & Rachel BOYD) as Boyd, William, Sarah, Elizabeth and Ammitey BAILEY. [KM]\n\nThere were, of course, many William BAILEYs, and it's sometimes hard to tell which record is for which person. The will mentioned above is crucial, since it names Rachel BOYD. It gives us a starting point, in searching for the children of William and Rachel.\n\n(I had originally thought that the William BAILEY who appeared in Bourbon County in 1810 and 1820 was the son of John and Sarah. Thanks to Kay MCGEE for finding the right William. [KM])\n\nWilliam BAILEY the Methodist\n\nWe have had occasion to speak of a colony of Kentuckians, that settled on the west bank of the Mississippi, where Helena now stands. During the year 1818 there was a valuable addition to that colony in the person of William Harrison Bailey, who, with his family, came down from Nelson County, Ky., in a flatboat and settled at Helena. His earnest, consistent Christian life soon made an impression upon his neighbors. He opened his house for prayer meetings for his neighbors, and finally organized a society of Methodists in Helena, which was the beginning of Methodism in Helena. [HMA, p. 36]\n\nThe first positive information that we have in reference to the introduction of religious service in this colony was in 1818. William Harrison Baily and his pious wife came from Kentucky that year and settled at Helena. This Mr. Baily was a nephew of William Henry Harrison—President Harrison. Mr. Baily was a very devoted Methodist, and, although he was not a minister, in the absence of the regular minister he would hold religious services. Although he was not a physician, yet being a man of good education, he knew something of the nature of medicine, and would visit the sick and relieve their wants, and in this way he very greatly endeared himself to the people. He opened his house for the accommodation of his neighbors and held prayer-meetings for them in his own house, and in this way laid the foundation for the first Methodist congregation in Helena. [HMA, p. 355]\n\nWilliam H. BAILEY purchased land originally owned by Moses BURNETT in 1819. On 2 Sep 1820, land owned by William H. BAILEY amounting to 376 acres Arkansas County was sold for taxes. The previous owner was Moses BURNETT, so it was probably the same land William had purchased the previous year. It might seem like William had come upon hard times.\n\nWilliam and Rachel were generous to the poor, and took in several orphaned children. Charles and Augusta Maria LOOMIS, aged 5 and 12, were bound in indenture to William and Rachel in 1820, after the death of their father, Isaac B. LOOMIS. On 20 March 1821, Hannah BELOUT was bound to William and Rachel for 15 years. [KM]\n\nWilliam became a Phillips County Magistrate 20 March 1821. He was Justice of the Peace and Judge of Elections in 1823. [KM]\n\nWilliam Harrison BAILEY died in 1824, probably in Helena. He left no will. Rachel, his widow, was executor of his estate, and she had 6 children, all of William. They are named in the court records related to the division of lands in William's estate. They are: Boyd, William C., Sarah (wife of Philip RAYMER), Margaret (wife of John BAILEY, deceased), Virginia (wife of Elijah BOYD), and Elizabeth (wife of Isam SINGLETARY).\n\nChildren of William Jr and Rachel, from the 1817 will of William Sr:\n\nBoyd, William, Sarah, Elizabeth and Ammitey.\n\nChildren of William Jr and Rachel, from the 1824 land division of William Jr:\n\nBoyd, William C, Sarah, Margaret, Virginia, and Elizabeth.\n\nSo it looks like one of {Margaret, Virginia} is Ammitey, and the other was born between 1817 and 1824. Later records show that Margaret was married in 1811, so she was born before 1795, and she must be Ammitey. However, Virginia had her first child in 1824, so she must have been born before 1808. We have a dilemma. Below are my best guesses.\n\nChildren of Rachel BOYD and William H. BAILEY (probably not in the right order):\n\ni. Sarah B. \"Sally\" BAILEY was born, probably in Berkeley, VA or Nelson, KY, between 1790 and 1800, based on the 1830 and 1840 censuses, below. She moved in 1818, along with her parents and siblings, to Helena, and married Phillip RAMER/RAYMER about 1823.\n\nIt seems that in the early 1800s, the name was usually spelled RAMER, sometimes RAIMER, RAMES, RAMERS. Later descendants used the spelling RAYMER.\n\nOne Phillip RAIMER appeared on the tax list for Arkansas County, AR in 1819. Since Phillips County was formed from Arkansas and Lee Counties on 1 May 1820, it may be that Phillip had already settled near Helena by 1819. He must have been an adult in 1819, so probably born before 1798.\n\nOn 28 Nov 1823, Phillip and Sally sold 640 acres on the bank of the Mississippi River, in Phillips County. Phillip purchased 40 acres of public land in 1837, and almost 80 acres in 1844.\n\nNotice of Administrators\n\nNOTICE\n\nTHE following Administrators and Guardians, having filed their account for settlement and confirmation, at the last term of the Probate Court for the county of Phillips, in the State of Arkansas, which was begun and held on the first Tuesday after the third Monday in July, A.D. 1840, to wit: Obadiah Roberts, Administrator of the estate of Henry Kimble; Boyd Baily and Phillip Raymer, Administrators of the estate of Elijah Boyd; William Keller, Administrator of the estate of Thomas Bailey; Richard Powers and Elijah Green, Administrators of the estate of George Turner; M.

BOWIE ! ! ! Daniel M. Brickey, WILLIAM M. BOSTWICK ! ! and BOYD BAILEY ! ! are free in giving publicity to slanderous reports, concerning Maj DAVIS THOMPSON, calculated to injure and impair his fair standing in the estimation of his fellow citizens, and thereby if possible, to defeat his election. This we have just learned, and have no hesitancy in giving it publicity, as the source we consider worthy the most implicit coincidence—will these men avail themselves of the present state of Maj. Thompson’s health and thus assail him, on the very eve of the Election, when they imagine it will be impracticable for him to meet their dastard charges? Do they suppose that the Major’s fate is sealed, because he has been so unfortunate as to be sorely afflicted with disease, both in person and his family.—And will they thus try to avail themselves of this misfortune? Fie on you men!—Such conduct deserves the ex????? & contempt of every gentleman in the land—because it is a species of moral turpitude, by far more ?????? than we had thought it were possible for men to perpetrate with impunity in a community, characterized as ours is, for morality and gentility. Will these men dare to confront Major Thompson with these charges—if so, we are willing to rest the cause with them. If he does not prove in the satisfaction of every honest man in the community, that he has been slandered, grossly slandered by these men, we will retract with pleasure, my remarks which may have been elicited on the occasion. If a man’s private and public character is to be thus wantonly assailed, at a period when he is disabled by disease and sickness, from vindicating himself; we would say with as much propriety, might he be ???? ???? and his wife and children turned out of home, and striped of their just property, when the life blood of the husband and father, had been chilled by the icy hand of Death.\n\nWe have made the charges above, and are responsible for the consequences. Our authors are at hand, and their names freely offered to those concerned.\n\nWe will, when more particularly advised of the particulars pertaining to this matter, hold these men up before the public in their proper light. We have no vindictive or personal feeling to gratify—what we do, is the result of a spirit of justice, and a duty which we owe to that gentleman, who has been so grossly injured. More anon.\n\nThe Arkansas State Democrat, and Helena Commercial Advertiser (Helena, AR), Friday, 18 Sep 1840, page 2\n\nHelena Fire of 1852\n\nGREAT CONFLAGRATION !\n\nThe most Beautiful Portion of Helena in Ruins.\n\nOn Monday night last, Helena was visited by that awful calamity, fire, which destroyed the most valuable part of Helena, taking into consideration the same amount of ground. The fire was first discovered issuing from the roof of Dr. H. P. Hargraves’ Livery stable, about 12 o’clock Monday night last. It consumed the stable all the provender contained in it, as well as all the notes, accounts, &c., of Dr. Hargraves, besides some $300, in L??d Scrip. The horses were all saved, with the exception of one, which was brought to the door of the stable, but rushed back from fright into the flames, and was burned up.\n\nJudge Bruton’s office, to the right of the stable was next consumed; but its contents were saved. The fire stopped there in that direction.\n\nThe conflagration extended south, burning the Helena House, belonging to Turner W. Goswick, and occupied by A. G. Robertson. Part of its contents were saved.\n\nThe flames rapidly spread down the street consuming the house of J. Q. Taylor; occupied as a drug store by King & Comfort, and as a Doctor’s office by Drs. Deputy & King; but a small portion of its contents saved.\n\nThe buildings belonging to Boyd Bailey, occupied by Messrs. Norton, Fackler & Moore, by Hicks & Bumpass, by F. F. Howerton, and the Masonic Lodge, were destroyed, together with a great portion of their contents.\n\nThe building owned by Jesse Locke, occupied by J. Levy, merchant, and as a Barber shop by James Alexander, fell a prey to the flames.\n\nThe fire crossed over to the row of law offices belonging to Messrs. Bailey & Horner, and H. P. Coolidge & Co., burning them to the ground, destroying a portion of their contents. These buildings were occupied by T. J. Moore, Esq.; R. F. Sutton, Esq.; the Swamp Land office (the papers and books of which, were saved); and by Jackson & Trousdale, Esqs.\n\nThe fire was here checked by the application of wet blankets to the roofs of the adjoining buildings, and the desperate exertions of our fellow citizens, and by the unusual calmness of the atmosphere, together with the fact that there had been a steady rain during the early part of the night, which served to dampen everything inflammable. Had there been the least wind during the fire, Helena would have been totally destroyed, and it is the wonder of all that our town escaped as it did. The fire was doubtless the deed of an incendiary. The amount of property lost, is calculated at some $50,000, as follows:\n\nDr. R. H. Hargraves, $6,000; J. C. Bruton, 200; T. W. Goswick, (insured,) 3,000; A. C. Robertson, 1,000; Q. K. Taylor, 1,100; King & Comfort, 6,000; Boyd Bailey, 7,500; Norton, Fackler & Co., (10,000; insured,) 12,000; Hicks & Bumpass, (5,000; insured,) 6,000; F. F. Howerton, 500; J. Levy, 3,000; The Masonic Lodge, 250; Baileys & Hornor, and H. P. Coolidge & Co., 1,500; T. F. Moore, 200; R. F. Sutton, 50; Jackson & Trousdale, 300.\n\nBesides this amount, Baileys & Hornor lost $1,000 by damage in removing goods, as did several others, business men, lose various sums in like manner.

Elijah BOYD was born on 5 Apr 1765, in Berkeley County, VA. He married Phebe O. HAYES or HAYS, on 21 Aug 1789 in Berkeley County. They had 4 known children, with at least one born in VA. [JBBC, p. 12]\n\nThe family moved to Bourbon County, Kentucky by 7 Dec 1795, when Elijah and his brother John appear in a legal document. On 10 Feb 1797, Elijah purchased 250 acres from John, and soon resold it for £300, a large sum at the time. Between 1797 and 1800, Elijah BOYD and his family moved to Washington County, KY.\n\nThe 1799-1801 Kentucky Tax List had 32,000 taxpayers, of whom 47 were BOYDs, but there was only one Elijah BOYD. He was in Washington County, taxed in 1800.\n\nPhebe must have died, because on 11 Oct 1802 Elijah married Ann MOODY, daughter of Benjamin MOODY. Elijah BOYD himself died in 1803. An inventory of his estate was made on 4 May 1803, so he died before that date, at age 37 or 38, having been married to Ann less than 7 months.\n\nAnn (MOODY) BOYD may have remarried, as she filed a prenuptial agreement with Edward DORSEY on 19 Nov 1812. This agreement concerned 5 slaves: one Sarah and her 4 children, Delia, Harriet, Jack and Cato. It also involved \"a tract of land being her part of 4,800 acres willed to her by her father.\" That's 7.5 square miles - quite an impressive estate.\n\nThe estate of Elijah BOYD was not settled immediately after his death in 1803, probably because some of his heirs were minors, and perhaps their inheritance was held by a trustee until they reached majority. A preliminary settlement was reached in 1811, and the final settlement was made on 25 Sep 1818, at a meeting in Washington County, KY, attended by attorney William B. BOOKER, estate administrator Justice HAYS (a relative of Phebe?), and the two heirs, John and Elisha BOYD. [JBBC, p. 12]\n\nThe 4 children of Elijah BOYD and Phebe HAYS:\n\ni. John BOYD was born some time between or about 1790 [JBBC, p. 34] or between 1792 and 1800 [JBBC, p. 12] . He was named in his grandmother Sarah (GRIFFITH) BOYD's will in 1805. His name appeared on the final settlement of his father's will in 1818, mentioned above.\n\nThe birth dates of John and Elisha are switched in [JBBC] between pp. 12 and 34. The birth c. 1790 was probably in Berkeley County, VA, but the one between 1792 and 1800 could have been in VA or KY.\n\nii. Elisha BOYD was born about 1790 [JBBC, p. 12] or between 1792 and 1800 [JBBC, p. 34]. Elisha was undoubtedly named after his uncle, the famous General Elisha BOYD. Like his brother John, he appeared at the meeting on 25 Sep 1818 in Washington County, KY.\n\niii. Abigail BOYD married James C. SHORT on 29 Sep 1817, in Mercer County, KY. [KPC, p. 140] Mercer County shared its western boundary with Washington County. They lived in Stanford, Lincoln County, in central KY. See the 1822 map, above.\n\nFrom [JBBC, p. 34], Abigail was born before 1803 (presumably because she was married in 1817), and that she did not appear in her grandmother Sarah (GRIFFTH) BOYD's will, written in 1805. The only data on the birth dates of Abigail and James comes from censuses. The 1850 US Census (below) has them both at age 54, so they were born about 1796, James in VA and Abigail in KY. This agrees with the 1820 and 1830 censuses, but not the 1840 census, which is probably in error on this point.\n\n7. Mary BOYD was born 29 Apr 1767, in Berkeley (then Frederick) County, VA. She married William MUNFORD/MUMFORD/MANFORD on 6 Apr 1786, in Berkeley County. They had 5 children. [JBBC, p. 13]\n\nThe children were all born in Berkeley, VA, except possibly the youngest. Most of them seem to have ended up in Pleasant Township, Switzerland County, in the southeastern corner of IN. The name was sometimes spelled MUNFORD or MUMFORD in VA and later in KY, but always MANFORD in IN. [JBBC, p. 35]\n\nMary must have died before her father, who died in Apr 1800, as she is not mentioned in his will, although her children are. However that means that Margaret could not have been born after 1800. At any rate, like her brothers William and Elijah, Mary also left several small children. Her husband, William, died in 1804.\n\n1 Mary BOYD b: 29 Apr 1767 in Frederick, VA, d: 1800 in Nicholas, KY\n\n+ William MUNFORD b: 1763 in Frederick, VA, m: 06 Apr 1786 in Martinsburg, Berkley, VA, d: May 1804 in Nicholas, KY\n\n......2 Sarah MANFORD b: 20 Jan 1787 in Berkley, VA, d: 21 Apr 1868 in Switzerland, IN\n\n...... + Abraham WEAVER b: 01 Nov 1784 in Germany, m: 20 Jun 1814 in Nicholas, KY, d: 27 Dec 1864 in Pleasant, Switzerland, IN\n\n......2 Mary \"Polly\" MANFORD b: 1789 in Berkeley, VA, d: 1820\n\n...... + John ALFREY m: 11 Apr 1815 in Nicholas, KY, d: Aft. 1832\n\n......2 John W.
