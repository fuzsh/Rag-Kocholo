        "text": "John Michael Boyd of Baden, MD, beloved husband, father, G’Pa, and Great G’Pa, died Saturday March 16, 2024 at the age of 71.\n\nJohn is preceded in death by his parents, Timothy A and Mary R Boyd, his wife Diane “Cookie” Boyd. John is survived by son, Nicholas Boyd, and wife Alesha; daughter, Amanda McQuaid, and husband Michael; sister Kathy Stauffer; five grandchildren (Gabie, Michael, Amina, Mason, and Sophia); and two great grandchildren (Braelynn and Isabelle); as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nJohn graduated from Surrastsville High School, class of 1971. After graduation, John started the family business of Clinton Welding Company. Once retired, he enjoyed soaking up the sun rays aboard their boat, Too Grand. He was always making friends wherever he went. He also enjoyed rides on the dune buggy down to the river. When not on the boat, he could be found building something at his home in Baden. He had a passion for eating lobsters. Always willing to help anyone that he met in any way that he could. He will be deeply missed by all who met him. He would always say “He had one hell of a ride.”\n\nA celebration of life is being planned for a later date."
