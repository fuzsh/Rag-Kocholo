        "text": "John Boyd was born in Carlisle, England and studied painting in the Slade School of Art. He has resided in Ireland for many years and has exhibited both here and internationally since the late 1970s, most often in London and America. His work has a consistent style, with surrealist themes that play with the observer. He is represented in collections both public and private, in Ireland and abroad; including Allied Irish Bank, Morgan Grenfell, De Beers, Mason Hayes & Curran Solicitors and The Merrion Hotel."
