        "text": "(1840–1921). Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon John Boyd Dunlop developed the pneumatic (air-filled) rubber tire. Although it was invented as an improvement on the bicycle, the pneumatic tire arrived on the scene just in time to contribute to the success of the automobile.\n\nDunlop was born on February 5, 1840, in Dreghorn, Ayrshire, Scotland. In 1867 he settled in Belfast, Ireland (now Northern Ireland) as a veterinary surgeon. Twenty years later he constructed a pneumatic tire for his son’s tricycle. Patented the following year, the tire went into commercial production in 1890, with Dunlop holding 1,500 shares of the Belfast manufacturing company that developed into the Dunlop Company."
