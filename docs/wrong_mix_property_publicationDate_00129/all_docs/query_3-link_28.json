        "text": "The Conspiracy in the Corpse\n\nBrennan and the Jeffersonian team are desperately working to get Booth out of jail, clear his name and absolve him of crimes he did not commit. The remains of a man who has been dead 16 years could be the point of origin in the entire government conspiracy that ultimately put Booth in jail. Meanwhile, Booth is faced with a challenge from a new and politically ambitious FBI agent (guest star John Boyd). As he awaits trial, Booth also realizes that many of the convicts with whom he is locked up are criminals he put in there, and Daisy and Sweets have a surprise for the rest of the Jeffersonian team.\n\nErrors and Omissions\n\nAn open and close case becomes anything but when Harvey's accused of an inappropriate dalliance with a married woman. Louis forces Mike to make a difficult decision, one that could net the firm a wealthy client, but cost him Harvey's respect."
