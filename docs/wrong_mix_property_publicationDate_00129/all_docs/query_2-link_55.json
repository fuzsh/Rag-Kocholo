        "text": "John Franklin Boyd, age 84, of Tipton, passed away peacefully on Thursday, April 11, 2024 at The Waters in Tipton. John was born on March 1, 1940, in Elwood, to his parents, Guerine and Bessie (Calvin) Boyd. On July 13, 1963 he married the love of his life, Shirley K. Dickerson. The two enjoyed 39 years of marriage, before Shirley passed away in 2002.\n\nJohn graduated from Tipton High School in the class of 1958. He then went on to proudly serve in the United States Army. Upon returning to civilian life, John farmed and raised livestock. He had a meticulous work ethic and always provided well for his family.\n\nAnyone who knew John would tell you he was a friendly and kindhearted man. He had a knack for making people feel valued and appreciated. He had the gift of gab and could talk to anybody about anything. John was a very proud husband, father, and grandfather. He will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him!\n\nThose left to carry on John’s legacy of love are his children, Kevin Boyd of Tipton, Kathy Baugher of Tipton; grandchildren, Zack Baugher (Kiersten) of Kempton, Olivia Baugher of Noblesville; and one great grandchild, Hazel Grace Baugher.\n\nJohn was preceded in death by his wife, Shirley Boyd; parents, Guerine & Bessie Boyd; sister, Marjorie Strebin; and brother, Harold “Fred” Boyd.\n\nA graveside service celebrating John’s life will be held on Monday, April 15, 2024 at 2:00 PM at Nevada Cemetery with Pastor Pete McGuire officiating.\n\nTaylor & Cowan Funeral Home is honored to serve the Boyd family in their time of need. Please feel free to leave an online condolence or share a special memory of John with his family on his tribute wall."
