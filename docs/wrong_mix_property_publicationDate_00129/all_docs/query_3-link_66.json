        "text": "Alan Nelson\n\nAlan Nelson\n\nCo-Managing Partner at CRA | Admired Leadership\n\nPublished Nov 17, 2021\n\nLast year I read Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War by Robert Croam. It is hard to summarize John Boyd. Wikipedia makes an attempt. I had been exposed to a greatly simplified version of Boyd's OODA loop, and his name kept popping up in different places, so I decided to read this bio. I'm glad I did. Few people outside of the military have any idea who John Boyd was. Reading his biography was a revelation, both in understanding the scope of his contributions across multiple domains and in trying to come to terms with his obvious genius. Understanding more about his theories of planning and strategy informed a lot of my own thinking in 2021 during the unfolding pandemic, and I plan to write a post detailing a bit more about some of those lessons. In the meantime, here are my book notes, and if you want to learn more about Boyd (beyond reading the book) his colleague Chet Richards has an excellent summary of his work here, including Boyd's famous brief, Patterns of Conflict.\n\nWhat Boyd was obsessing about—and that is not too strong a word—was trying to understand the nature of creativity.\n\n“If you want to understand something, take it to the extremes or examine its opposites,” Boyd said.\n\nGenerating a rapidly changing environment—that is, engaging in activity that is so quick it is disorienting and appears uncertain or ambiguous to the enemy—inhibits the adversary’s ability to adapt and causes confusion and disorder that, in turn, causes an adversary to overreact or underreact.\n\nWhoever can handle the quickest rate of change is the one who survives.\n\nIn these victories by numerically inferior forces he found a common thread: none of the victorious commanders threw their forces head-to-head against enemy forces. They usually did not fight what is known as a “war of attrition.” Rather, they used deception, speed, fluidity of action, and strength against weakness. They used tactics that disoriented and confused—tactics that, in Boyd’s words, caused the enemy “to unravel before the fight.”\n\nBoyd said von Clausewitz’s second major flaw is that he spends a lot of time talking about how a commander must minimize “friction”—that is, the uncertainty or chance that always appear in the “fog of war.” He does not deal with maximizing the enemy’s friction—as does Sun Tzu—but only with minimizing his own.\n\nBoyd, borrowing from Sun Tzu, said the best commander is the one who wins while avoiding battle. The intent is to shatter cohesion, produce paralysis, and bring about collapse of the adversary by generating confusion, disorder, panic, and chaos.\n\nOnly the explicit part of the Loop is [commonly] understood. The military believes speed is the most important element of the cycle, that whoever can go through the cycle the fastest will prevail. It is true that speed is crucial, but not the speed of simply cycling through the Loop. By simplifying the cycle in this way, the military can make computer models. But computer models do not take into account the single most important part of the cycle—the orientation phase, especially the implicit part of the orientation phase.\n\n[What is important is not] the mechanical cycle itself, but rather the need to execute the cycle in such fashion as to get inside the mind and the decision cycle of the adversary. This means the adversary is dealing with outdated or irrelevant information and thus becomes confused and disoriented and can’t function.\n\nA commander can use this temporal discrepancy (a form of fast transient) to select the least-expected action rather than what is predicted to be the most-effective action. The enemy can also figure out what might be the most effective. To take the least-expected action disorients the enemy. It causes him to pause, to wonder, to question. This means that as the commander compresses his own time, he causes time to be stretched out for his opponent. The enemy falls farther and farther behind in making relevant decisions. It hastens the unraveling process.\n\nTrust emphasizes implicit over explicit communications. Trust is the unifying concept. This gives the subordinate great freedom of action. Trust is an example of a moral force that helps bind groups together in what Boyd called an “organic whole.”\n\nBoyd, like Sun Tzu and Napoléon, believed in attacking with “moral conflict”—that is, using actions that increase menace, uncertainty, and mistrust in the enemy while increasing initiative, adaptability, and harmony within friendly forces.\n\nA crucial part of the OODA Loop—or “Boyd Cycle,” as it has come to be known—is that once the process begins, it must not slow. It must continue and it must accelerate.\n\nHelp improve contributions\n\nMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.
