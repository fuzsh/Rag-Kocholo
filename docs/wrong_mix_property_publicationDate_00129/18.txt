John Boyd Nicholson, better known as Boyd, was born in the hometown of David Livingston, in the town of Blantyre, Scotland on July 14, 1922. He had one sister, Ella, who died as a child. His family moved early in his childhood to Moss Park in Glasgow, where Boyd attended the Shawlands Academy.

Parents

His father was Stewart Boyce Nicholson (b. 1898 Pollockshaws, Glasgow, Renfrewshire, Scot. - d. 1970), who was employed in 1914 as a mason, and in 1946 as an electrotherapist. His mother was Catharine Granger Cumberford Nicholson (b. 1895 High Blantyre, Scot. - d. 1968).

Ancestry

Stewart's parents were John Boyd Nicholson (b. 1854 Ballymiscaw, Co. Down, N.I. - d. 1939 Eastwood, Renfrew, Scot.) and Margaret Jane "Maggie" Norris Nicholson (b. 1856 N.I. - d. 1937 Lanarkshire, Scot.), who married Jul. 16, 1875 in Eastwood. Margaret's father, William, was a police constable.

John (1854-1939) was employed as a masons builder, and died when Boyd was 17, and his final words were quoting Ps. 23:6, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever", which played a direct influence in Boyd subsequently placing his trust in Christ. John's parents were John Nicholson (b. 1830 Dundonald, Co. Down, N.I. or Toxteth Park, Liverpool, Eng.) and Mary Ann Henderson Nicholson (b. 1821 Ireland), married 1849 in Ireland.

Catharine's parents were Hugh Cumberford (b. 1869 Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire, Scot. - d. 1940 Blantyre, Lanarkshire, Scot. and Ellen Pettigrew Mathie Cumberford (b. 1865 Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scot. - d. 1933 Blantyre, Lanarkshire, Scot..

Military

During WWII, Boyd qualified as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, training some in Canada, where he met Bernice Robertson who would eventually become his wife. He spent two years on tours of duty in India and Burma, and although trained in bombers, he flew transport of supplies behind enemy lines.

Marriage and Family

On Dec. 5, 1946, Boyd and his parents arrived to Canada and settled in St. Catherine's, Ontario. In 1947, Boyd and Bernice were married in Toronto, and the following year, Cathie was born, followed by J.B. in 1951, and Bill in 1955. In their early years, they were in fellowship with Queenston Street Gospel Hall.

Bernice's family

Bernice's family

Boyd's wife Bernice's father, William "Bill" Fowler Robertson, was born in Montreal, Quebec, on Aug. 28, 1894, his parents emigrating from Scotland in 1888, along with three other Brethren families, who all joined the St. Antoine Street Gospel Hall, presently known as Westend Bible Chapel. The Robertson family relocated to Toronto, Ontario about 1902, and in 1911, at the age of 16, Bill was working alongside his father, also William (b. 1863 St. Nicholas, Aberdeen, Scot. - d. 1932 Lincoln, ON), as machinists for a local radiator company.

The elder William Robertson (Bernice's paternal grandfather) previously worked at the age of eighteen as a fisherman in St. Nicholas in Aberdeen. He was the son of Helen Robertson (b. 1840 Strathdon, Aberdeen, Scot., bap. 1841 Insch, Aberdeen, Scot.). Helen was employed in 1861 in Strathdon, Aberdeen, as a nurse, and by 1871 in St. Nicholas as a fisherwoman and seller of whitefish. Helen was a daughter of David Robertson and Margaret Sim Robertson.

Bill's mother was Mary Ann Guyan Robertson (b. 1864 St. Nicholas, Aberdeen, Scot. - d. 1934 Lincoln, ON), the daughter of John Guyan (1829-1917 Aberdeen, Scot.) and Mary Baxter Guyan (1829-1890 Aberdeen, Scot.).

In his later years, Bill, with the assistance of his grandson, J.B. Nicholson, Jr., compiled a history of early assembly work, entitled The Road Home, published by Clarion Press in 1983.

Career and Ministry

After working numerous jobs, Boyd settled in printing and commercial art, which he pursued until 1960 when they attempted to relocate to Africa, but this was thwarted by the Simba Rebellion, and the War of Independence in the Belgian Congo. Instead, Boyd and Bernice were commended to the Lord's work in North America, travelling extensively in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America, and Boyd wrote and edited several Christian periodicals including Food for the Flock, Counsel and Uplook, and authored several books. For many years he was also a regular speaker on the Family Bible Hour radio broadcast. After a month-long illness, he passed into the Lord's presence on Sunday, Nov. 12, 2000.
