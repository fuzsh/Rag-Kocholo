"The crowing touch for Stan came when he bought a luxury yacht and sailed to the bridge where , as a child , he had first glimpsed what he hoped would be his future."

Hello all, this is a sentence I got from a translation forum, I haven't the faintest notion about "crowing touch", is it a typing error or a latest term? I put it in some of my favorite dictionaries, I got no answer, do you know?

Thanks

Hello Aar, thank you at first, but look back to your quotation, you can see all of which are used as "verb", 1. to make... 2. to utter... 3...., so I want to suggest that crowning here shall be an adjective, right?

and according to its part of speech, I got two definitions of crowning:

1. representing a level of surpassing achievement, attainment, etc.; supreme

2. forming or providing a crown, top, or summit

So here, I guess the crowning is an adjective instead of verb.

I agree on the definition of 'to crow' but you wouldn't say 'crowing touch' and I have never heard of anyone crowing upon acheiving something

I guess I should have completed my sentence "crowning touch" is idiomatic but "crowing touch" is not (I've never heard these two words put together either).

Hi, I cannot understand the meaning of the red part of the following sentences, from the first episode of the first season of Frasier TV show. Would you please help? Thanks.

I need an extension cord to plug in the vibrating part.

Yes, that will be the crowning touch.

His dad bought a new chair for himself and changed Freiser's decoration to set up his new chair in the house. Freiser is angry but his dad did not care and wanted to set up its vibrating part.
