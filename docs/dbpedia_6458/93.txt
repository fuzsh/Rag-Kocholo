Lance and his entire team were amazing to have as part of our wedding day. They were timely, organized, professional, and their videos truly captured the joy we felt on our wedding day so well. Our videos are a wonderful keepsake to have and look back on for years to come. I cannot recommend their videography services enough for your big day!

As a photographer, I was not initially sold on the idea of having a videographer at my wedding. But after a family member convinced me, going with Crown and Lace was an easy decision. We briefly met with Lance over the phone and were impressed by his professionalism and kind demeanor. Our wedding was shot by Jordan and Cruz, who were a joy to work with and paired wonderfully with our photographer. They made the entire process of filming the day easy and fun. A short couple months after our wedding, my wife and I were blown away by the incredible quality of the wedding film we received. We watched it three times in a row and were left stunned each time. While I love photography, having Crown and Lace shoot our video was the best investment of the wedding. Thank you to Lance, Jordan, and Cruz. You captured a snapshot in time of one of the most meaningful days of my life in an unparalleled way. If you’re someone on the fence, my advice is to look at the prior work of Crown and Lace. It speaks for itself. They are incredibly talented at what they do and you won’t regret having this team film your wedding day.
