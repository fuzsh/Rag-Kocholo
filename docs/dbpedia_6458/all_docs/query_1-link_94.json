        "text": "It was May of 1973 and my dad had taken me into New York City for my 12th birthday. We were waiting for a train to the American Museum of Natural History and a huge poster on the subway platform caught my eye. It announced “THIS IS CINERAMA IS BACK” and pictured an audience watching a huge wraparound screen with the image of a roller coaster. I was very curious, especially with the bold proclamation, “Puts YOU in the picture!” Now I knew a bit about film, I had been around it all my life. My dad was an avid home movie buff and we even had an 8mm projector and screening room in our basement, but I had never heard of Cinerama and wanted to know all about it. My dad told me all that he could remember and also mentioned seeing 3-D movies back in the 1950’s. He recalled BWANA DEVIL and HOUSE OF WAX and having to wear special glasses for the 3-D effect. The immersive aspect of these movies fascinated me and I wanted to see those films too.\n\nI had a very limited knowledge of 3-D. I owned a View-Master set at the age of five and must have looked at the Batman reels hundreds of times. When I was 9 years old, I read an article about 3-D horror movies in Famous Monsters of Filmland, and there were ads for a couple of films in the Columbia 8mm home movie catalogs. For whatever reason, none of these had made much of an impression on me at that time. But suddenly, I found the audience participation concept most intriguing and I was eager to learn more.\n\nThere were no books on 3-D so I began going to the library and looking through film journals for more information. The real technical details, which I was most anxious to discover, were frustratingly elusive. Finally, two years later, I spotted a small ad for a publication on the history of 3-D and immediately mailed one dollar to Texas for a copy.\n\nIn addition to my growing fascination with 3-D movies, I was a huge Martin and Lewis fan. I had just watched the ABC television premiere of MONEY FROM HOME on June 15, 1975. The very next day, I received the magazine, “Everything You Wanted to Know About 3-D But Were Ashamed to Ask.” It was written and published by Paul E. Adair, a man who (I was later to discover) had been the first person to ever undertake the difficult task of searching for original 3-D prints.\n\nAs I read through the magazine, I was amazed at the amount of 3-D movies made in the 1950’s. I knew of the horror films but had no idea there had been so many westerns, comedies, musicals and even a travelogue in the process. I turned the page and saw ads for MONEY FROM HOME. I thought “Wait a minute, the movie I watched last night was originally in 3-D?” I now wanted to see it that way! Having just watched it flat on TV was disappointing, to say the least.\n\nI was able to find a used copy of Columbia’s 8mm red/blue anaglyph version of THE MAD MAGICIAN and ran it repeatedly for my friends and family. The 3-D effect was somewhat diminished in the anaglyph format but I didn’t care, I was finally able to see something in 3-D! I convinced the teacher in my 8th grade class to let me show it as a special end of school presentation. At that time, 3-D movies were extremely hard to find so the kids had never seen anything like it. That was my first public exhibition for an enthusiastic audience and I was hooked.\n\nJust a few months later on October 16, 1975, I was finally able to see my first vintage 3-D movies on the big screen. The Paramount Theater on Columbus Circle in New York was showing a double feature of IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. Even though they were presented in the converted anaglyph system (they were originally shown in Polaroid) I was thrilled to finally see them. I sat through the double feature two different times, not knowing if I’d ever have the chance to see them again.\n\nOnce again, my classmates were exposed to my three-dimensional obsession. For my 9th grade English class, I submitted an 8 page article, “A Look at 3-D Motion Pictures.” As part of my presentation, I brought in the 8mm projector and ran SPOOKS with the 3 Stooges. They loved it, and that was the only time in Junior High School that I got three A’s for one report!\n\nIn January 1976, Monarch Releasing Corporation in New York began distributing the controversial feature film SNUFF. The hype concerning a supposed on-screen murder generated a ton of free publicity and Monarch made a fortune. They looked to acquire other properties a bit more mainstream and wound up buying the rights to Arch Oboler’s 1966 3-D feature, THE BUBBLE. They were planning a re-issue under the more sensational title FANTASTIC INVASION OF PLANET EARTH. Being an aggressive 15 year old and not terribly shy, I called Allan Shackleton, President of Monarch, and somehow talked him into giving me a private screening. On the afternoon of June 30 1976, I saw my first Polaroid 3-D film and it knocked me out. I left the screening room and thought now more than ever; I want to see those films from the 1950’s in their original versions.\n\nJust a few years later, I finally had my chance. I was working weekends at a record store in New York and the Thalia on 95th street was showing a revival of MISS SADIE THOMPSON, SPOOKS and MAN IN THE DARK. I asked my boss if I could take an extended lunch break and go watch a little bit of one film. He reluctantly said yes, but told me not to stay too long. When I saw that first dual-strip 3-D presentation on November 25, 1978, I was hooked. I wound up staying for both features and when I finally got back to the store three hours later; my boss was not terribly pleased with me. He understood that I had my priorities.\n\nThroughout 1979, I was able to see several dual-strip revivals at the Thalia, including an original 1953 left/right pair of IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE on New Year’s Day. The print had some wear but it was a revelation seeing it in the original Polaroid version. I never wanted to see the anaglyph again."
