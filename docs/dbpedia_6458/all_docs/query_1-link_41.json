        "text": "ROCKPORT — Adventure Advertising purchased Crowning Touch Embroidery on September 3, 2020 and moved the equipment and inventory to their location at 29 Commercial Street in Rockport.\n\nFormerly owned by Joseph and Virginia Ryan for more than 30 years, Adventure Advertising was purchased on October 1, 2019 by Alyssa and Dale Landrith. The company has long been known for vehicle graphics and custom signs as well as websites, printed products, custom apparel and design, according to AA, in a news release. In 2020, Adventure has added to its historical offerings with additions of digital marketing as well as embroidery and screen-printing.\n\n“Purchasing Crowning Touch Embroidery allows us to bring our embroidery work in-house to improve quality and turn-around times for our clients,” said Dale Landrith. “We are excited to welcome the customers of Crowning Touch Embroidery and continue the great quality and service that they have received. Martha, the owner of Crowning Touch, will be joining us in Rockport to educate our team and ensure we achieve the quality and service her customers have come to expect.”\n\nCrowning Touch Embroidery has operated in Union for more than 15 years, and has served many businesses, non-profits, schools, and individuals from the surrounding areas. Martha Johnston-Nash, the owner of Crowning Touch, has worked hard to ensure her work provided quality and great customer service, and developed many relationships and friendships along the way, according to AA.\n\nJohnston-Nash currently serves on the Town of Union Select Board.\n\n“My priority has always been to sell my business to someone who would carry on the tradition of service and customer satisfaction that we at Crowning Touch have always prided ourselves for. Alyssa and Dale Landrith, owners of Adventure Advertising, are dedicated (as I always have been) to making sure their customers are satisfied,” said Martha Johnston- Nash. “I am confident they will continue to produce quality work.”"
