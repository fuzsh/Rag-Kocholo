        "text": "The Market and Festival reference in Animation, video games and new media changes its name to Weird to include new forms of expression\n\nNearly 800 professional meetings, more than 1200 participants and 41 short films from America, Asia, Europe and Oceania, are some of the numbers that show the importance of the event\n\nAmong the outstanding presences of the edition: Beatriz Navas, Vincent Tavier, Jean-Baptiste Wery, Lina Foti, Marc Aguesse, Eleanor Coleman, Silvina Cornillón, Nuria G. Blanco and international studios such as Tumblehead or Exit 73\n\nWeird is the new designation of the reference Market in Spain for the Animation, Video games and New Media sector, which in its 11th edition, held this October in Segovia, has strengthened its position as a focus for professionals and industry. Weird will be held again in the fall of 2020, established as a reference for the sector. This year, its data reinforces it as a talent catalyst, project showcase and industry focus with more than 1,200 participants, 153 selected projects, 41 short films in competition and nearly 800 professional meetings.\n\nThe new denomination represents a step forward that seeks, from its continuity, to encompass new artistic expressions such as comics or board games. “In recent editions we have seen that it was necessary to broaden the focus and focus more on the concept of ‘IP’, a wider spectrum that fits the reality of this industry,” says José Luis Farias, director of the event.\n\nThe impact of Weird goes beyond the borders of the Iberian Peninsula, with speakers from Europe and various parts of America. Highlighted presences such as the ICAA director, Beatriz Navas, the new president of Diboos, Nico Matji, the president of DEV, Valeria Castro, the multi-award-winning animators Alberto Vázquez and Nuria González Blanco or the international professionals Vincent Tavier, Jean-Baptiste Wery , Lina Foti, Marc Aguesse, Eleanor Coleman, Silvina Cornillón, among many others. Likewise, in 2019 there were conferences by renowned international studios such as the Danish Thumblehead Studios or the American Exit 73, who showed the progress of their #Blud project, an idea originally thought as a series that has been converted into a video game. This adaptation has been praised by critics and the specialized press from around the world and Segovia was the scene chosen to show some of its advances.\n\nThe weight of programming has also been reflected in multiple specialized media, as well as national and international press such as Variety, Animation Magazine, Latamcinema, Audiovisual 451 or RTVE. More than fifty interviews in just three days that serve as speaker for millions of people around the world, an audience that accesses the latest news about animation, video games and new media.\n\nWeird also has an important area dedicated to professional meetings, networking and the search for new talent. On the opening day of the last edition there were about 800 professional meetings that took place among the “recruitment” session – with 13 companies doing interviews -, project consultancies and B2B co-production meetings. In addition, this year a soft skills games workshop was organized with the Gecon Foundation, where video game professionals were able to verify the entertainment potential and evaluation of skills that their own video games can have.\n\nThe crowning touch was put by a list of winners where the short films Muedra by Cesar Díaz, Sweet Night by the Belgian Lia Bertels and the Frenchman I’m Going Out For Cigarettes by Osman Certon were the winners of the jury. The public, meanwhile, opted for the French Mémorable by Bruno Collet (in the International section) and La Noria by Carlos Baena (in the National section). The list of winners also included multiple awards for the projects selected by the Segovian appointment, as was the case of Leopoldo, el del bar, by Diego Porral (Short Film Project Movistar + Award) or Gris de Nómada Studios, (RTVE Award for the most innovative video game project)."
