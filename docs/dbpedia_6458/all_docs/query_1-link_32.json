        "text": "FLEDGLING film festivals are generally the preserve of Quentin Tarantino aspirants, screening shakily produced indies edited in a garden shed while dreaming of Hollywood stardom.\n\nThey are not â Colin Burrows is explaining earnestly â held in five-star resorts, or feature the hottest, Sundance-winning releases and names as acclaimed as Leonardo DiCaprio, Greta Thunberg and Richard Curtis.\n\nSo this monthâs inaugural Turks and Caicos International Film Festival (TCIFF) with screenings at the luxurious Shore Club and The Palms, among others, is \"already punching above its weightâ.\n\nWith more than 30 years in the business, Burrows is well placed to comment. As CEO of London-based Special Treats Productions, his creative content company has lent a hand to everything from James Bond to Star Wars.Â\n\nHe chuckles as he admits to \"shamelessly exploitingâ a few personal contacts to give the eagerly-anticipated festival some credence.Â\n\nWhat further sets this particular event apart is its focus on the escalating pressures facing the worldâs oceans.\n\nAmong the environmentally-themed flicks being showcased is eco-thriller documentary Sea of Shadows â executive produced by DiCaprio â which kicks things off on November 15.Â\n\nThe troubling exposÃ© of Mexican cartelsâ deadly poaching methods, threatening some of the planetâs most endangered marine life, has already bagged itself the Audience Award at this yearâs Sundance Film Festival and is now in the running for an Academy Award in February.\n\nThe short Thunberg-narrated Nature Now, which demands natural solutions to mitigate against climate change and which Special Treats helped edit, will also make an appearance.Â\n\nRenowned late filmmaker Rob Stewartâs stand-out documentary Sharkwater Extinction is the result of Stewartâs oceanic travels to lay bare the illegal and violent underbelly of shark finning.\n\nThe Canadian conservationistâs fascination with the marine world was to ultimately claim his life; he died tragically in a diving accident in January 2017 shortly before production ended.Â\n\nHis parents Sandra and Brian Stewart will be present on island for Sharkwater Extinctionâs TCI debut and to take part in a Q&A open to festival-goers.Â\n\nOther eminent names the public will have a chance to meet include British screenwriter Richard Curtis, behind classics like Bridget Jonesâs Diary and Notting Hill.\n\n\"The festival is the star, not the people, but itâs certainly nice to have some big names too,â Burrows, TCIFFâs director, tells the Weekly News.\n\nFeaturing productions in line for Oscar success in the illustrious line-up is another way of drawing industry bigwigsâ eyes to the event, he continues.\n\n\"This festival means a lot for TCI. Like many islands in the region, we are on the frontline of climate change; we all look out into the Atlantic and are very conscious of rising sea levels and other pressures.\n\n\"Having a festival that acknowledges that is good for the Islands,â Burrows says.\n\n\"Secondly, we have not had a cinema here for a few years. I am a passionate believer in the big screen experience so I am very excited about bringing cinema back to the island.\n\n\"Finally, there is a lot of creativity here and young local filmmakers are excited about the festival and the mentors we are bringing in.\n\n\"It sends a message that TCI is open for the film business and puts us on the map for Hollywood,â Burrows adds.\n\nTCIFFâs open submission process has already attracted a handful of emerging Caribbean stars.Â\n\nAmong those hoping to make their mark on the world is TCIâs own Dalia Engler. Her short film, Carried by the Current, will be shown on the festivalâs final day and includes stunning imagery of the beauty beneath the waves.\n\nAudiences will also be treated to a 16-minute short from a collaboration of young TCI filmmakers.\n\nBahamian-produced Plastic Warriors is included in the line-up too, along with two movies from Dominica created in the aftermath of devastating hurricane Maria which exterminated homes, infrastructure and agriculture across the nature isle.\n\nIt is not the first time the TCI has staged a film festival; the Friends of the Arts Foundation (TCFAF) held a private one in 2004, followed by three annual events headed by former First Lady LisaRaye McCoy.\n\nNeither are they new to the region with counterparts staged in Trinidad, Antigua, Dominican Republic, Barbados and Jamaica, to name a few.\n\nBut as environmental plunders and plights continue to garner worldwide headlines thanks to vociferous young activists like Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion movement, TCIâs festivities will attract attention from diverse and heavyweight international observers.Â Â\n\nFor Barbara and Mark Pankhurst, founders of TCFAF which is now in its 18th year, the film festival is a crowning touch on the 100-plus shows in the foundationâs chronology.\n\nThe Pankhursts are on the brink of retiring from TCFAF but they remain ardent supports and funders of its work and are among the film festivalâs distinguished board of directors.\n\nThe foundationâs raison d'Ãªtre has been to instill an appreciation of the arts in youngsters, so it is only suiting that a major part of TCIFFâs remit is encouraging local children on board.\n\nAn outreach programme, led by photographer and environmentalist Kim Mortimer, has reaped dividends in raising schoolchildrenâs consciousness of green sensitivities, Barbara Pankhurst says.\n\nIt has included conservation-themed poster and video competitions, and even a visit by Jamaican former sprinter Usain Bolt who helped launch the festival in May before an audience of delighted kids.\n\n\"The children have been very touched by the issues affecting our planet and have really picked this up,â Pankhurst explains.\n\n\"Theyâve been learning about overfishing, the use of plastics and the pollution of our oceans, and the fact that our reefs are dying for many reasons.\n\n\"We gave all the kids metal bottles and bamboo straws as an alternative to plastic and talked to them about reef-safe sunblock,â she continues.\n\nThe creation of a film commission will further promote rising local talents, Pankhurst hopes.\n\n\"This festival is long overdue. Not only do we have good reason for advertising what we have in TCI, we need to protect our oceans and our famous reef,â she says, adding: \"This is just the inaugural event; we want it to be known internationally and to sustain it every year.\n\n\"Itâs vital to get the kids involved so they understand what we need to do to change the world â and ensure our Islands continue to exist.â\n\nThe Turks and Caicos International Film Festival takes place from November 15 to 17. Visit www.tciff.org for more information and to buy tickets.\n\nVolunteers are also being sought for a variety of positions. Email bstrogatz@aol.com or emilie.faulkner.meek@gmail.com for details."
