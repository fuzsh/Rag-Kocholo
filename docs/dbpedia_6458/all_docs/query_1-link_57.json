        "text": "Storybook style was born from the imaginations of Hollywood designers seeking to re-create medieval Europe for movie sets. As with most things from Hollywood, fans took notice and so did architects and builders who capitalized on the idea and brought it to Main Street, Southern California.\n\nYou’ve no doubt spotted some of these homes. Maybe you were even tempted to knock on the door and ask for a peek inside. Well, now you can see many of them without the risk in the new book “Storybook Style: America’s Whimsical Homes of the 1920s’’ (Schiffer Publishing, 2017, $35). It offers gorgeous snapshots from photographer Douglas Keister and informative prose from author Arrol Gellner for the uninitiated as well as those who can’t get enough of the fanciful architectural style.\n\nThe two collaborated on a book of the same content back in 2001 with another publisher. But the 2017 version with Schiffer seems like a brand-new book, Keister said.\n\n“I found out so much more, and people started fixing up their houses. There are a number of homes in the Los Angeles area, including Long Beach, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Eagle Rock, the Los Feliz area and Hollywoodland. Actually, the genesis of the book was in Hollywood, specifically a studio in Culver City. The most well-known (and first) storybook-style home is at the corner of Walden and Carmelita in Beverly Hills. It’s called the ‘Witch’s House’ and was moved there in the mid-1920s from Culver City.’’\n\nThere’s no fairy dust involved, but the houses built in this fashion may make you look twice. The whimsical structures look like they’ve come straight out of central casting and were popular throughout Los Angeles in the early part of the 20th century. Most are distinguished by their unusual roof design, appearing thatched with shingles applied in what looks like a wave. Some have turrets or cone-shaped roofs. Technically the style is called Provincial Revivalism, but since much of its origins lie in movie backlots, the storybook title stuck. One thing’s for sure, you know one when you see it.\n\nFanciful nicknames aside, a common trait is the not-your-everyday-cookie-cutter structure.\n\n“I think that, from a contemporary perspective, storybook houses are appealing because they actually reflect a bit of human personality,’’ said Gellner. “By contrast, most home designs nowadays come from big corporate developers, and they’re really just collections of focus group-inspired clichés that they’ve found will sell houses.”\n\nYou can find them everywhere throughout the country, but he offered tips that can narrow the search.\n\n“We didn’t have the time or money to scout areas surrounding Los Angeles County. There are undoubtedly storybook examples in Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties,’’ he said. “They’ll naturally be found in the old 20s-era portions of cities and towns, which are usually just a few blocks outside of the original town centers.\n\n“This was essentially the game that Doug and I had to play to spot storybook houses. We’d find the 20s-era blocks in any given town, and then just drive up and down those streets (what Robert Ballard called ‘mowing the lawn’ when he was searching for the Titanic).”\n\nThe curious probably could pull off the same kind of detective work in their own towns. But Los Angeles remains the epicenter.\n\n“The storybook style is quintessential Los Angeles in the 1920s and ’30s, with English-cottage-style buildings featuring exaggerated sagging roofs, cobblestones and an overall playfulness in design,” said Adrian Scott Fine, director of advocacy for the Los Angeles Conservancy. “It was all about creating a fantasy and a sense of age, something straight out of Hollywood’s world of make-believe. No place better exemplifies this type of architecture than Los Angeles.”\n\nWith most storybooks, there’s usually a bit of the good with the bad — in this case, architecturally. A loving attention to craftsmanship is clear with all of them, found in the “humor of a swaybacked roof or the artistry of a round chimney,” Gellner said. But what’s not so good can be exactly the same.\n\n“It can take a lot of effort and expense to maintain, say, a seawave roof as opposed to your standard tract house roof of brown composition shingle,” he said. “Also, borrowing from Hollywood set construction techniques as they often do, some of these homes were not built with a particular eye toward permanency, and they need particular tender loving care for this reason. However, anyone who really loves architecture will already understand that it’s a labor of love to own houses like these.”\n\nFor Keister, it was capturing them on film. In fact, the photographer will be in town Sept. 14 for a book signing at the Los Feliz Library, sharing his insight into the work.\n\n“Storybooks are light in their whole approach,” he said. “And the style is the architecture style that makes you smile. They evoke a whimsy or fantasy. Really can’t define it but you always recognize it.’’\n\nA self-professed sleuth, he loves a mystery and considered tracking these houses down similar to a treasure hunt.\n\n“The first time was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle without knowing what the cover looked like.”\n\nMore than 15 years later, the puzzle isn’t quite as puzzling.\n\n“For those already familiar with the original edition, I’d want to let them know that the new book is simply brimming with fascinating new archival material showing the movie-industry origins of the style,” Gellner said. “Previously, we either didn’t have access to these images or simply couldn’t fit them in the original edition. For those who have never seen the original edition, good grief, this is a story that’s simply not to be missed if you have even the slightest interest in architecture. It reads, well, like a Hollywood movie.”\n\nBook signing\n\nPhotographer Douglas Keister will sign his “Storybook Style: America’s Whimsical Homes of the 1920s”\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 14\n\nWhere: Los Feliz Library, 1874 Hillhurst Ave., Los Angeles\n\nCost: Free\n\nInfo: 323-913-4710\n\nResources\n\nstorybookers.com"
