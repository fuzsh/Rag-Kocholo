        "text": "William Shakespeare is kind of a big deal. Maybe you’ve heard of him — his plays being globally renowned cornerstones of the English-language canon. Those plays also have been frequently adapted into films, sometimes successfully (Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo + Juliet, various Macbeths, Ran as an adaptation of King Lear and My Own Private Idaho as an adaptation of elements from Henry IV and Henry V) and sometimes not (Gnomeo and Juliet).\n\nTo grab the imagination of modern international audiences, such productions often play with the original time or setting. What’s rarely been attempted is not only Shakespeare done in the original period but an attempt to actually film his interconnected historical plays. The Hollow Crown is such an effort, adapting Shakespeare’s both tetralogies and containing Richard II, Henry IV Part 1, Henry IV Part 2, Henry V, Henry VI Part 1, Henry VI Part 2 and Richard III (the three Henry plays are simply just shot as two films). It’s got a killer cast as well in Ben Whishaw, Patrick Stewart, Simon Russell Beale, Jeremy Irons, Tom Hiddleston, Anton Lesser, Benedict Cumberbatch and more. It’s a chance to see Shakespeare done really, really well, and it’s a fantastic entry point for audiences that love Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon.\n\nThe production value is appropriately stellar, taking advantage of many real-life shooting locations in England, and the battles are appropriately big. For those that just want their Shakespearean history straight and want it good, it’s hard to imagine a better version available — especially given that many of these productions have never seen a full-blown film adaptation in one form or another. Honestly the only issue here is time, with the full production of both seasons (and they are technically TV seasons although each episode is essentially a feature film) running 885 minutes, or 14 hours. That might not actually seem that long, and that’s right: The plays are somewhat abridged. But I think that’s acceptable in the name of access and engagement with some of English literature’s finest stories.\n\nThe discs themselves display the visuals well, thankfully featuring subtitles to help wade through all the olde English dialogue. There are also three sets of behind-the-scenes documentaries with both the cast and crew on hand to explain how they managed to pull off the greatest televised Shakespeare adaptation this century. Reading this, you’ll probably know if The Hollow Crown is something you’re keen on, but if you’ve got that itch, this very nice Via Vision set will scratch it."
