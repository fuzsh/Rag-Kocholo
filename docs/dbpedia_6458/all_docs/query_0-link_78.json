        "text": "Opens today in Manhattan Directed by Florian Habicht Not rated; 90 minutes\n\nIn \"Woodenhead\" Florian Habicht latches onto the Tilt-a-Whirl moment and tries to extend it to an hour and a half. He's not entirely successful, but the effort is awfully interesting.\n\nThe Tilt-a-Whirl moment is that disorienting few seconds, after you get off the ride, when your senses aren't working properly: you reach for a friend's shoulder to steady yourself but grab his nose; you sit on what your eyes tell you is a bench, only to land in a baby carriage.\n\n\"Woodenhead,\" a freakish fairy tale from New Zealand about a dump attendant named Gert who is escorting a lovely woman named Plum to her wedding, induces this effect with multiple disruptions of the cinematic norm. It is all in black and white, for one thing, and the camera crew is big on odd angles and jitteriness. The crowning touch, though, is Mr. Habicht's decision to record the dialogue first, then film the scenes. Sometimes words and visuals match, sometimes they don't. (Nicholas Butler plays Gert, but Steve Abel provides the voice; Teresa Peters is Plum, but Mardi Potter does the talking.)\n\nMr. Habicht is striving for the type of fairy tale that isn't meant for children. Gert and Plum drop their clothes instead of bread crumbs to mark their path, and they encounter unpleasant beings who make trolls look good."
