        "text": "Nina Simone can now officially be what so many of us have referred to her as for decades: a hall-of-famer. Next year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will induct her into the fold, and with all due respect to Bon Jovi, Dire Straits and The Cars, hers feels like the most momentous and well-deserved. Don’t get me wrong. When I hear a song from one of the aforementioned bands, I jump on my bed like a little kid and rock out. Especially when it’s a joint by The Cars. But Simone’s voice tapped into the feelings of oppressed people around this country, with an introspection normally attributed to literary types. She wanted you to feel her pain, revel in it, and buy a mortgage to live on the same block. Simone didn’t just understand what it was like being a woman during times of societal change, but what it meant to be a black woman. No doubt, the struggle was real.\n\nBut her music wasn’t just good for raising a fist to or burning candles. In 1999’s The Thomas Crown Affair, either legendary director John McTiernan or his music supervisor had the brilliant idea to lace the heist movie with bits and pieces of her 1965 dope joint, “Sinnerman.” What does a Gospel-turned-Blues song have to do with a ’99 heist flick starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo? I’m glad you asked.\n\nThe most obvious connection is the title itself. Thomas Crown is, what Christian folk would say, quite the sinner. He’s a thief and a liar who’s chief transgression is lying about being a thief. Crown is a titan of industry and bored. While Alexander wept when he saw there were no more lands to conquer, Crown decided to rob the biggest art museum in New York City just to see if he could. To make matters worse, he becomes romantically entangled with the bounty hunter (Russo) called in to find the painting and bring some restitution to the musuem. They engage in a lot of witty banter, do the whole “cat and mouse” thing, and decide whether they’ll be star-crossed lovers or get together and leave it all behind. From us ordinary people, the film gets at something we’ve probably all questioned once or twice: Do we really want this person or is it the thrill of the chase?\n\nCrown needs a place to run as the walls begin to close in. He’s finally in a position where all the money in the world can’t save him from the wrath of the NYPD, the FBI and, of course, a bounty hunter. It all builds to all of our main players being back at the scene of the crime. As the audience, we know “Tommy” is walking into a trap. He knows it, too. So the fun and suspense come in watching him pull off one last trick.\n\nOn its own, it’s a good scene. It’s edited beautifully with different cuts to illustrate the slight of hand and fast pace of his plan. The scene is a classy version of the shell game; we’re watching one thing when we really should be watching something else. But it’s Ms. Simone’s voice that brings everything home. She takes a good scene and makes it great. She adds emotion and depth to something that could be weightless on its own. Admittedly, a song questioning “where you gon’ run to” when a character is doing his best to hide from surveillance is a touch on the nose, but it works because we’ve heard the tune in bits and pieces throughout the film.\n\nMusic in film is nothing new. Some use it really well, others? Well, the less said about them, the better. But there is an art to it. It’s less about finding something you like and more about finding the right tune that verbalizes the emotion in a scene. Sometimes it’s the score hitting the right notes, like John Williams has shown time and time again with Jaws, Star Wars, Close E.T., or really anything that’s gotten you emotional for the past 30 years. Other times, the best way to convey the emotion is to drop the music. Alfred Hitchcock and his partner-in-crime Bernard Herman got into a bit of an a disagreement as to whether or not The Birds should have a score. Obviously, Hitchcock won that argument and the flick is better for it. The quiet and natural sounds provide the right notes for that movie and are pitch perfect.\n\nMovies like Belly or Above the Rim use music to inform character and shed light on the world around them. Before you know anything about Kid or Play in 1990 coming of age flick House Party, you know the type of music they listen to and can instantly trace that music to a specific year. Rather than getting a boring info dump, music fills the gaps for us and does it in a way that doesn’t induce sleep. Or at the very least, an eyeroll.\n\n“Sinnerman” feels like something Thomas Crown listens to. Thanks to Brosnan’s acting, there are even hints that he feels the desperation of the song and truly has no place to run to. The song underscores his soul but propels the scene. It needs the music to say what the characters shouldn’t and elicit a response from the audience. Not sure if the response they were going for was “I’m a huge Nina Simone fan now” but that’s the one they got from me almost 20 years ago. Her song became the movie’s unofficial theme music. It’s fair to say Simone’s music was the theme for a lot of people’s lives and possibly enhanced it. According to WhoSampled.com, her music has been sampled over 250 times and I’m willing to bet several steak dinners your favorite rapper is on that list. Kanye probably did it the best when he and Talib Kweli wanted to help us all “Get By.” Jay-Z recently used her as the soundtrack to our struggle on “The Story of O.J.” and the world feels like a much better place because of it.\n\nNina Simone was a boss. And it’s because of her, a good movie from 1999 brushed shoulders with greatness and can still be remembered today.\n\nMarcus Benjamin is a danger to the public, an alum of American University, St. John’s University, a screenwriter, and has an intense relationship with words.
