        "text": "Could someone please post the direct quotes from Colonel Sun. I'd really appreciate it. I’ve not yet read the book but I will! It may heighten my appreciation of the scene.\n\nFor me, it is Waltz's big scene of the film, equivalent to the moment Bardem gets when Bond and Silva meet. I just feel that the material wasn't good enough for Waltz, he could have been so much better. Furthermore, in the December draft a more interesting scene plays out with Oberhauser and Bond playing cards. It would have worked as a direct reference to an event in their childhood when Bond beat him at cards. Plus the main thrust of the sequence from December is the childhood the pair shared. In the final film, it’s almost an afterthought with Waltz saying: “You’re probably wondering why I hate him so much.” YES we are! Mainly because the character of Franz Oberhauser has been so poorly weaved into the fabric of the film leading to this point.\n\nThe December scene would have effectively built the tension and animosity between the characters. Plus it would have been a little more atypical of a Bond villain not to embark on another groanworthy torture sequence. (We all know Bond will escape!) This is the stuff SF did well as it bucked the trend and was subversive. It was a film that was bold enough to introduce its villain in a 10 minute dialogue scene with minimal gimmicks. Even the William Tell scene has a lot of brio and chutzpah.\n\nIt would seem that Mendes was struggling with this Oberhauser/Bond confrontation scene for months. The initial Solar Furnace idea is totally pants and straight outta some poorly conceived parody film. It would seem someone shoved Colonel Sun under his nose and it was decided that they should just nick the sequence.\n\nI actually thought this scene was quite brilliant. One of the very best scenes of the film for me. I haven't read Colonel Sun yet—one day, one day, I know—but for some reason I immediately thought of John Gardner when this scene appeared. I'm sure the scene reminded me of the end of\n\nNobody Lives Forever, when Bond is threatened by guillotine in the bright, sterile deathbed room of the modern head of SPECTRE. Been awhile since I've read it, but if I recall correctly, he rigs some kind of explosive to annihilate the new SPECTRE head and get himself out of that trap as well.\n\nAnyway, Waltz reads his most eccentric in this scene, the torture is edgy and Gardner-esque (or Amis-esque as the case may be)—and therefore derivatively Fleming-esque—and the whole scene was just what the doctor ordered for this Bond fan.\n\nIt's definitely interesting though to hear what some fans consider too far for the Bond franchise. A couple scenes in Skyfall went too far for me: the grotesquery of Silva's deformed face; the absolute, ridiculous crudeness of playing games with and shooting a bound Severine in the head, not to mention her unsettling and all too real for the world of Bond backstory. Anyway, those things bothered me and felt like they didn't belong in the fantastical world of Bond. But I guess on account of my upbringing on the contributions of Gardner (though it sounds like this scene may in fact be directly attributable to Amis), I found SPECTRE's torture scene a breath of fresh air.\n\nPierce2Daniel wrote:\n\nI think this scene deserves it's own thread.\n\nSoo....what did we think?\n\nI've seen the film a few times and for me it's really the most unusual sequence in the film. It feels kinda tacked on and a little unwelcome. Firstly, let's start with the staging and camerawork. The actual cinematography and set-design are a little flat. It almost feels like the sequence was hurried together quickly as an afterthought. Also the strange dentist chair felt like it was deliberately trying to be a more high-tech reimagining of the low-fi torture scene in CR. Only this time complete with a dodgy CGI drill.\n\nThe surprising thing is that every time I've seen the film people seem to genuinely be squirming in their seats during it. The woman next to me on Friday was covering her mouth and jumping every time the drill went in. Why doesn't this scene have the same impact on me? Is it because it's poorly staged? Or is the issue deeper-seated? Maybe it has something to do with the lack of drama in the plot? Or the film's failure to build Oberhauser up as a credible bad guy by that point?\n\nAlso, it feels like a total wasted opportunity to lobotmise James Bond only 2 minutes later to have him completely recover and shoot up Oberhauser's entire lair. This guy just had a drill in his f@*@king brain!!!! He should be mess, it would have been so much more effective to have him make mistakes during that shoot-up (still being competent but maybe passing out and struggling to keep up - Craig's Bond is all about vulnerability after all), it would have allowed Madeline to pick up the pace and actually protect Bond, she should have blown up the compound! She knows how to use a gun and I'm sure her Dad would have taught her a thing or two. It would have increased our emotional attachment to her if she protected Bond.\n\nAdditionally, there is probably the most ham-fisted piece of dialogue during the torture scene from Oberhauser when he says something like \"the daughter of an assassin, the only one who could understand you\" - talk about on the nose. Whatever happened to the subtlety and nuance of SF?\n\nThoughts?\n\nI think this is a terrible scene. In terms of its gruesomeness its right up there with the torturing of Severine in SF, as described in a posting above.\n\nI find these two scenes to be the most unsettling in the series. Both scenes are in Sam Mendes films. I'm not sure what that means, if anything.\n\nThe SP torture scene does feel tacked on, and it was, as those familiar with the leaked Dec shooting script know.\n\nIt's a radical rewrite of a more civil tete-a-tete between Bond and Blofeld, with Swann present, before Bond launches the exploding watch and makes his escape. How this tedious torturescene is an improvement is beyond me.\n\nThe torture scene robs us of a DN style Bond and Blofeld dinner scene with girl present.\n\nThat's what I was hoping for, but Mendes made such a mess of the actual story, it's as if he couldn't decide how to stage the Blofeld reveal. Unfortunately someone on set, had a copy of Colonel Sun. Cue the rewrite.\n\nAnd cue the garish blinding light and Blofelds sockless fishbelly white legs and ill-ftting pants practically hiked up to his knees, as added torture bonus.\n\nVery unfortunate, as I thought the Ernst reveal was actually handled quite well. Nice touch with the cat. But it would have worked much better, over a tense dinner scenario, with death for dessert looming over the proceedings.\n\nMy main objection though is broader in scope.\n\nNamely, that cinematically especially, Bond should not be subjected to such demeaning torture.\n\nIf the filmmakers are going for gritty edgy realism, then they also fail, because in gritty realistic world those who are tortured also die. This type of torture is just a form of sadistic slow execution. So be done with it and kill Bond. Then you've got your realism.\n\nAs the learned @perilagukhan suggests, are we watching Saw or Bond?\n\nBut in edgy fantasy adventure, which is what Bond is, the needles don't penetrate, just as Goldfinger's encroaching laser never even singed Bond's pants, nor did Stampers torture implements ever graze Bond's actual skin, while in DAF Bond was pulled from certain death by Slumber and Tree, before the crematorium flames even singed his hair.\n\nBy all means, position Bond under threat of any manner of heinous death, and knock him around some, but spare us actual helpless strapped to a chair, sadistic torture.\n\nFleming wrote exactly one torture scene, followed by 13 books of nada. It's not exactly a recurring element in Fleming.\n\nAnd even Fleming didn't allow Bond the fantasy of escape from such plight.\n\nHe allowed that Bond was dead, once the goings got started. Bond was fortuitously rescued. He did not escape the impossible.\n\nYet one continuation author after another, not to mention later film directors, Tamahori and Mendes, seem determined to get their CR torture bonafides in. Yawn.\n\nMaybe they could take their cue from the 13 books in which Bond is not subjected to helpless torture.\n\nColonel Sun I find to be a tedious continuation novel at best. Amis's torture sequence is sadistic and twisted in the extreme. Why Mendes felt a need to lift from this better forgotten scene, boggles. Mendes is a strange cat. Amis stranger.\n\nThis is just my preference btw, but I believe it to be sound.\n\nBond is escapist action hero. He doesn't get strapped to a chair and tortured. Rather he manages to escape before such indignities are visited.\n\nIf it were 1952 and I could sit down with Sir Ian, I'd say to him, ditch the torture scene in CR.\n\n\"I come from the future, where all the lameass imitators that follow you, are going to go hogwild on torturing Bond, as you did, all of one whole time.\n\n\"Your acquaintance Amis will write one of the most tedious scenes in all of Bond continuation lit, in one of the dullest most plodding continuation novels ever served up.\n\n\"Thank you Sir Timmer.Good advice. I will dispense with that scene entirely, and rework the entire scenario, and scold Mr Amis accordingly.\n\n\"May I offer you some of my my fine Jamaican rum?\n\n\"Thank you Sir Ian, don't mind if I do."
