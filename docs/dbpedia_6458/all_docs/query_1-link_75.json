This classic love story unfolds in the tradition of a Cuban bolero — a ballad telling of their shared love of music, romantic passion and moments of triumph as well as their heartache and separation.\n\nTold via flashback, the story begins in Havana, 1948. Chico is a young Cuban songwriter and pianist who dreams of making a place for himself in the jazz world. Rita is a beautiful singer with a captivating voice. Music brings them together and they embark on a passionate and tormented love affair. Separately, and together, over the decades they move through the music scene in Cuba, the U.S. and Paris, performing with many of the luminaries in the jazz world.\n\nThe look and the mood of the era are exquisitely captured with a convincing depiction of real people and attitudes of the period. That uniqueness is refreshing. The atmosphere, street scenes, and even the fashions are evocative and the production gives us the leisurely, deliberate pace of natural people.\n\nEven the sound effects are spot on, from the way the piano tones echo through a room to footsteps across a floor to the sounds of traffic outside a window, everything has the feel of real life. The music is the common thread and crowning touch it all comes together beautifully, creating a nostalgic, emotional and memorable experience!\n\nWith sumptuous compositions, CHICO & RITA is a love letter to a bygone era where Cuban and American musicians mixed and created a vital, magical mestizo music.\n\nWith the emergence of Afro-Cuban jazz and its adoption in New York and elsewhere as a parallel theme to the love story, we’re immersed in a world of passion and music.\n\nWell-known artists Woody Herman, Tito Puente, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Nat King Cole all make appearances, and we also hear the music of Cole Porter and Thelonious Monk, all giving the story a historical foundation. Chano Pozo, a conga player in Gillespie’s band, also has a cameo and his untimely death becomes a minor plot point.\n\nCuban composer and pianist Bebo Valdés wrote the score and plays on the soundtrack as Chico. The movie, which contains parts of his own life, is formally dedicated to him. Idania Valdés (no relation) provides Rita’s singing voice. Her performance of Bésame Mucho is one of many standouts.\n\nAfro-Cuban jazz combines the rhythmic traditions of traditional Afro-Cuban music with the progressive harmonies and improvisation of American jazz music. For decades, this style of music has formed the basis of Latin jazz in the United States, Cuba, and around the world.

This truly international, distributed processing effort was accomplished well before Covid-19.\n\nThe rotoscope technique of capturing the animation from actual live-action scenes was the same as used with stunning effect in A Scanner Darkly and Belleville Rendez-Vous.\n\nThe filmmakers imbue the action and character movements with a realistic, yet floating, dream-like feel. The use of light and shadow, movement and rhythm to depict the central characters brings a lovely simplicity to the animation that tells the story in a magic and enchanting way.\n\nThe pen-and-ink creation of street- and cityscapes adds an exquisite level of detail in recreating old Havana, New York, Paris, Hollywood and Las Vegas. The use of color and shape sets the mood – warm yellow, orange and brown in the horizontal topography of Cuba; muted blues and grays in the verticality of New York City in winter.\n\nThe inclusion of real-life luminaries from the world of jazz further grounds the film within a realistic and human setting. Story, visuals and music combine to create a real sense of place. You’ll marvel at the filmmakers’ abilities and achievements in breathing life, genuine emotion and love into their characters and the environment they inhabit."
