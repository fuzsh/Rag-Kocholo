        "text": "Life is absurd, and in a world of blind rules and regulations, the 'crazy' people will always come out looking more sane. Saw a beautiful 4K restoration of this at Quad Cinema yesterday and I gotta admit it warmed my heart to this movie a little more to see it again so clearly and in brilliant colors.\n\nKing of Hearts is the type of simple, straightforward movie that could easily be dismissed as 60s counterculture nonsense, but this movie is just so sincere and sweet that it elevates above the noise. Don't get me wrong, it’s about totally depressing things, such as mortality and the absurdity of war, and it doesn’t treat those things frivolously.\n\nYet it never gets depressing,…\n\nGentlemen... dark shores ahead. There's no reason to be needlessly alarmed, but it appears that the outcome of this whole campaign is now in the hands of a stark, raving lunatic! Private Pumpernickel has gone crackless!\n\nDon't you think these actors are a bit over the top?\n\nKing of Hearts was a movie I came across last year when I fell (more so than before) for Geneviève Bujold in Alan Rudolph's Trouble in Mind and Choose Me. The summary won me over so hard so fast, and my mind was made up right then and there: I was going to love this movie when I got around to seeing it. I just knew. In the past, this has come back…\n\nKing of Hearts plays a royal flush in visual comedy whilst succinctly revealing its war microcosm. In a small picturesque town established in France, towards the end of the First World War, a squadron of Imperial German troops implement an explosive booby trap in the conspicuous “blockhouse” that will obliterate the entire vicinity when the “knight strikes midnight”. Its inhabitants desperately escaping in a flurry of fear. With the town now abandoned, a nearby Scottish French-speaking soldier is sent at the behest of his commanding officer to disarm the bomb before it detonates. However, in the midst of the mass scarper, the local asylum is left unlocked, resulting in the patients leaving their confinements and inhibiting the roles of the…\n\n☆\"Don't you think these actors are a bit over the top?\"☆\n\nNOPEtober 2022 – Film #16 of 31\n\nMy mom and dad saw this movie together on one of their first dates in 1976, re-released ten years after its French premiere as it developed cult status in America with Baby Boomers willing to look at European anti-war political satire with fresh eyes and new global outlooks. Of course, that same generation then put Ronald Reagan in the White House a few years later as they started families and cared only about their wallets and stock portfolios and not the CIA operations to topple democratically elected foreign leaders.\n\nAnyway! Le Roi de cœur [\"King of Hearts\"] by Philippe de Broca. It's…\n\nMental illness as portrayed in art has a lot in common with dreams. It's a territory sufficiently detached from \"the real\" that the artist feels free to throw in all their ideas and symbolism, carefree of what those very real things are actually like. I mention this because King of Hearts absolutely requires that you accept that the inhabitants of an asylum are all symbolic projections, a dreamlike circus of an innocent id, more than anything relating to flesh and blood people.\n\nMake your peace with that and it's quite compelling as a silly-tragic farce. This is the full flower of absurdism - World War I is mad, and against that larger ghoulish madness, a few innocent souls cavorting as…\n\nThis Euro co-pro was an international hit and is still today, in some (diminishing) circles, a cult favourite. Alan Bates plays Private Plumpick an ornithologist and reluctant Scottish soldier during WW1. He's sent on a mission to investigate a French village mined for destruction by the retreating Germans. Plumpick finds that the village isn't completely abandoned, it's populated by the inmates of a local insane asylum. The premise is that war is the ultimate expression of madness with de Broca's take being sort of a Catch-22 as Commedia dell'arte. Yet, what's truly absurd is that the inmates are far from your usual unkempt mutterers, they're attractive, non-violent and drool free. There's no variety in their dementia, it's a Pollyanna's view…\n\n20 Films x 5 Decades: 1960s\n\nPhilipe de Broca’s King of Hearts is positively surreal. An anti-war film possessing both surrealist and comedic instincts, the film stars Alan Bates as Charles Plumpick. A Scottish soldier during World War I, Plumpick is tasked with heading into a French town in order to make sense of the recent intel sent to the Scottish forces warning of some kind of planned explosion but written all in code and cut off before its completion. Upon arriving, the kilt-wearing Plumpick finds the town empty, aside from the local insane asylum and German troops. Integrating himself into their lifestyle by declaring himself the “King of Hearts” to hide from the German troops who saw him moving…"
