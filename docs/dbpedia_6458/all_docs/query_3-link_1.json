        "text": "During this time, Linda and seven employees were supposed to maintain the product line in Roanoke, Virginia until the new company could absorb her old one.\n\nThis was her plan for the foreseeable future, but it had an expiration date.\n\nTowards the end of this agreement, an old friend and colleague who now owned a moving company in Roanoke approached Linda.\n\nHe wanted Linda’s help developing a new profit center for his moving company. This was when she created the concept of a senior moving company. She agreed to do the R&D and build a new profit center for him. After presenting it to him and the board, she expected to be paid.\n\nWhat she didn’t know, was that this moving company was going under. Linda was left without her promised income, resulting in her homelessness.\n\nAfter four months of due diligence, Linda knew this idea was too good to abandon. It was a great new concept; it just needed legs to go somewhere. She had no money, but she was determined to develop the idea because there was nothing else like it in the United States.\n\nLinda had never hired a mover before, but she started pursuing the idea. She interviewed senior citizens, their children, and directors of retirement communities to help build the service menu still used today. The demand was there.\n\nThese were people of strong character who had a set schedule, so Linda knew they would be a perfect fit.\n\nAt one point, Linda recalls walking out on a basketball court while they were playing.\n\nShe put her hands up and said: “I’ve got a move tomorrow! Anybody out here wanna come help me?” And it worked.\n\nLinda went to rent the truck herself, took blankets from the room she was staying in, and taught her workers how to pack.\n\nShe created Crowning Touch’s unique method of packing based on good common sense and treating items the way anyone would want them to be treated.\n\nThis unique method of packing has earned Crowning Touch Senior Moving Services over a decade of awards for zero insurance claims in any of their moves.\n\nThe next big step came in the form of a meeting with a local bank and its executives. Linda was supposed to do a presentation for them. When the day came, she was in a rush. Coming from a pack, she was dirty, sweaty, and dressed in her uniform, complete with a ball cap. She had no time to change.\n\n“I had to be just real,” she says, laughing as she describes this big day.\n\nAfter the presentation, one of the vice presidents asked her to come to his office. She went inside, he closed the door and says: “I want to buy stock in your company.”\n\nLinda was shocked. She told him she didn’t have a business plan. His response?\n\n“I’m not investing in your company; I’m investing in you.”\n\nAfter he came back from a vacation, he gave Linda $10,000 to invest in her moving company. She took $5,000 of it and invested that into an old GMC pack truck.\n\nShe also rented a storage unit for packaging materials and blankets to use as furniture pads. It was at this time that she sought out new investors. With new money coming in, she found used equipment for great prices, like her first moving truck.\n\nThe company was growing, but little did Linda know that an even bigger change was coming into her life.\n\nShe soon realized that, if the customers could wait, instead of taking cash immediately, she could sell the items for them on consignment and split the profits 50-50.\n\nThis allowed her to take items off their hands, but still put money in their pocket.\n\nLinda, her daughter, and her husband put this idea to the test. They put out ads in the newspaper and invited people to come to the warehouse space to purchase the items she had collected.\n\nIt worked very well, which gave Linda the confidence to expand her business model. This is how the consignment shop of Crowning Touch was born.\n\nMeanwhile, Linda had expanded out of the basement in her home and rented office space in downtown Roanoke. The rent was $600 a month. It added visibility and credibility to her brand. She was even able to hire a receptionist and a bookkeeper.\n\nThe building on Williamson Rd was perfect. Linda and her husband could use it to expand the business even further, but it was $400,000, and she needed 25% as a down payment.\n\nLinda didn’t have $100,000 to put down on this building, so she decided to sell the Richmond office. A local couple bought the business in Richmond and agreed to pay royalties. She had money now, but it was only enough to renovate the space.\n\nDespite this, she went forward with selling the Richmond office. Her instincts told her it was a good move, but it was risky. According to Linda, if you’re not willing to risk it all, then you’re not ready to be an entrepreneur.\n\nShe recalled an equestrian expression as a lover of horses herself:\n\n“Throw your heart over the jump, and the horse will follow.”\n\nThis phrase, according to Linda, represents a lot of what it means to be a small business owner. In the spirit of this phrase, she signed a contract on the building with a 90-day close. She knew she didn’t have the money, but she took the risk anyway.Sitting in her downtown office one evening, five days before the option was going to expire, Linda gets a phone call.\n\nThe person on the other end confirms it is her and then asks “Is Jesus Christ your Lord and savior?”\n\nShe, of course, said yes, but wanted to know who was on the other end of the line.\n\nIt was a man named Mark Laubach who owned a roofing company in southern California. He had gone to school with someone here in Roanoke who knew Linda needed $100,000 and he wanted to help.\n\nThey moved into the building and fixed things up. The consignment shop opened, and everything was going smoothly.\n\nEven with all of these things in place, Linda saw that there were still items she couldn’t accommodate. Cars, boats, furniture, tools, and much more were still being left on the table. She was out of space.\n\nThat was when she came up with the idea to open Crowning Touch’s auction house. There was a building next door that would be a perfect fit. Linda called the owner and expressed interest in buying the building.\n\nThat was when Charles Helvey came to visit a Crowning Touch auction. He was a software engineer who wanted to help Linda optimize their unique way of bidding.\n\nHe agreed to write the program and take a percentage of the profits until he was paid off. The program has since been updated and copyrighted, but it is still a one-of-a-kind bidding platform.\n\nAuctions happen in real-time with people bidding on their phones or calling in to place a bid. People can come and see the items in person before they bid. You can even set a limit and let the computer proxy-bid for you up to that point. The new Browse and Bid is a hybridized system that combines online bidding with a physical event."
