        "text": "The Sunset Tower is a Hollywood landmark. Up to the 1950s it was as much a tourist attraction as the Hollywood sign itself. It has appeared in a number of films, including The Italian Job, Get Shorty, The Player and Strange Days. Its first literary mention was in Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely (1940). The film version of that novel, Murder, My Sweet, released four years later, was its first screen reference.\n\nCONTINUING THE LEGACY OF HOLLYWOOD’S GRAND DAME\n\nThe iconic landmark regained its status as the unofficial epicenter of Hollywood when hotelier Jeff Klein purchased the building in 2004, enlisting designer Paul Fortune to revive the property’s classic art deco style- pairing old world charm with the modern conveniences of a luxury hotel. A little over a decade later in 2018, Klein put his personal touch on another refresh; giving “the lady” (as he often refers to the building) yet another facelift. Klein embarked on a refresh of the hotel and common areas with his personal touch; with the goal of restoring its heart and soul while not compromising the character of such an iconic building.\n\nOriginally opened with enormous success in 2005, the hotel’s famous Tower Bar has also expanded to include a dark and sexy bar, reimagined restaurant and updated pool area- with its quintessential LA vista beyond. The style throughout is subtle, chic, understated and elegant, and Tower Bar continues to be known as the chicest yet most welcoming room in town.\n\nDeluxe Rooms & Suites feature a dusty pink tone, with soft cream and brown accents; and feature bespoke wallpaper in the bathrooms created by famous fashion illustrator Donald Robertson, with louche scenes from the hotel’s life, from the Sunset Boulevard sign to a martini in the Tower Bar.\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nSunset Tower is all about characters. Klein himself is more host than traditional hotelier and this is reflected in how ‘at home’ the great and good of Hollywood feel in situ at the hotel, bar and restaurant.\n\nGeshie Wilmot serves as Tower Bar’s elegant Maitre’d. Wilmot seamlessly choreographs the room with grace. Sunset Tower probably has one of the most paparazzied doorways in LA but the irony is that in this social hub, in the world of social media, no pictures are allowed inside.\n\nGeneral Manager Barbara Marie has also joined the team at Sunset Tower to run the day to day operations and elevate the experience as the hotel enters the newest chapter of her storied life."
