        "text": "\"A good-looking, well-wrought film with some knockout special effects…\" – Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times\n\nFrom the master of suspense, John Carpenter, comes a chilling new version of the sci-fi classic. Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birth... and the reign of supernatural terror begins. In what The New York Times calls \"one scarifying trip,\" the people of Midwich must try to find a way to stop the unstoppable in the Village of the Damned.\n\nSpecial Features:"
