        "text": "(Warner Bros. Home Entertainment provided me with a free copy of the blu-ray I reviewed in this Blog Post. The opinions I share are my own)\n\nUntil Warner’s blu-ray came along I’ve never seen the original Village Of The Damned (I was and still am a fan of John Carpenter’s 1995 remake though), but have always been aware of its existence going as far back as childhood when I used to love reading books about science fiction and monster movies. Back then movies about “evil children” could never make a blip on my radar; they just didn’t interest me. Frankly, they still don’t, and I only wanted to see this one finally because it’s a British made science fiction flick, I love those types of movies, especially the classics, and I’m happy to say I loved this film!\n\nBased on John Wyndham’s 1967 novel, The Midwich Cuckoos, Village Of The Damned starts off with a mysterious event that strikes the small British village of Midwich, at 11am everyone, and I mean everyone (including animals), is suddenly rendered unconscious, and this “time-out,” as it’s referred to later by the military, lasts for several hours. Anyone passing over the border of Midwich will suffer inexplicable unconsciousness too, and that includes anyone piloting a plane too low. You can imagine the tragedy that would and does result in a plane getting too low over the town.\n\nBy nearly 3pm everyone wakes up none the worse, well, except for all women of childbearing age—they’ve all been knocked-up! Even those who are virgins and who haven’t been with a man for some time.\n\nWhere is this all leading?\n\nAliens!\n\nThe children born of these women, some are normal, but twelve of them (sixty in the novel, according to historian Steve Haberman on the commentary) have white hair and “arresting eyes.” Once they get older, and they age quicker than a normal human, we’ll see they have mind reading and mind controlling abilities, so much so if you teach one child something they all learn. The movie focuses on two particular parents, Professor Gordon Zellaby (George Sanders) and his wife, Anthea (Barbara Shelley), who are try to cope and understand what their son, David (Martin Stephens), is exactly.\n\nThe alien angle isn’t too explicit in the beginning, but becomes obvious nonetheless as the movie goes on. At first a theory is given that impulses from another galaxy may have impregnated the women, but that theory is pretty much hammered home when Gordon is given a year to see if he can teach the kids , and in so doing learn more about what they are, and posing the question one day to the them, “Are you aware of life on another planet?” the kids respond by saying nothing, and looking down. At this point we’re not quite sure if they’re “evil,” but there’s no doubt when a car accident happens that almost gets one of the kids run over. Despite the drive being sincerely apologetic, they use their powers to make him get back in and kill himself by ramming his car into a brick wall where it explodes. There’s one more death later when the brother of that driver seeks revenge and attempts to kill them by gun, but the kids force him to blow his own brains out instead.\n\nWhat they want is never really answered and because it never is it makes them all that more chilling to watch. Midwich isn’t the only place to get a “time out,” it’s revealed several other places throughout the world had this happen too, but in all those other cases the kids were “dealt with,” (aka killed either by their respective governments or by society, one batch died during child birth. Lucky them).\n\nOf course this movie is leading to a downbeat ending and Gordon is the one who’s going to initiate it. Keep in mind his son, David, is the leader. When he comes to the conclusion he’s not going to make them more “moral and empathic,” he decides he’s going to have to kill them to save mankind, and he does this by blowing them up in the schoolhouse where he meets daily with them. In the process he sacrifices his own life.\n\nI recognized three actors that I never knew were in this. The first being without a doubt Barbara Shelley, whom I’ve seen in two Hammer Films I adore, Quatermass And The Pit (1967, aka Five Million Years To Earth) and The Gorgon (1964), along with one of Hammer’s Dracula sequels (the third one in the franchise), Dracula, Prince Of Darkness (1966), that I became a fan of several years ago when defunct Millennium Entertainment released their blu-ray of it here in the U.S. The second actor was another Hammer player, Thomas Heathcote. I recognized him from Night Of The Big Heat (1967), and he played a vicar in Quatermass And The Pit. The third guy took some doing to remember. In Village he’s the local doctor, Willers, but once I finally placed Laurence Naismith I remembered him as Argus from Jason And The Argonauts (1963). There’s one more actor who was in Jason that I didn’t realize until Stever Haberman pointed him out. Micheal Gwynn, who played Anthea’s brother, Major Alan Bernard, was Hermes in Ray Harryhausen’s movie.\n\nThe one creepy element this movie blatant has in its arsenal is showing us how the irises of the kids’ eyes glow when they’re using their powers.\n\nWarner Brothers has had a double feature DVD out of Village Of The Damned and it’s 1964 sequel, Children Of The Damned, in release since 2004, and just a few weeks ago they finally blu’d the first one through their Warner Archive Collection sub-label! (their DVDs are indeed manufacture-on-demand, their blu-rays are not)! You can buy it here on Amazon.\n\nVideo/Audio/Subtitles: 1080p 1.78:1 high definition widescreen—2.0 English DTS-HD Master Audio—English SDH subs only\n\nThe transfer, as usual with most if not all of the Warner Archive titles I’ve reviewed, looks fantastic!\n\nExtras Included . . .\n\nCommentary By Screenwriter/Film Historian Steve Haberman (ported over from the 2004 double feature DVD)\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nMy favorite kind of audio commentaries are ones with the cast, but when it comes to classical movies like this one, I prefer commentaries by film historians and Steve Haberman’s is as informational as I prefer them to be. He covers the histories of the actors as well as the making of the film and it’s deviations from Wyndham’s novel!"
