From the master of suspense, John Carpenter, comes a chilling new version of the sci-fi classic. Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birthâ€¦and the reign of terror begins. In what the New York Times calls \"one scarifying trip,\" the people of Midwich must try to find a way to stop the children in the Village of the Damned.",

        "text": "There's nothing worse than an un-scary scary movie. \"Damned\" is too long on drama, too short on horror and, what is most annoying, too insulting to our intelligence.\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nAlthough it's not in the same league as Carpenter's other notable remake (his 1982 version of The Thing remains unparalleled), it's well worth reassessment.\n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\nThe film feels somewhat dead. It's not tapping into a cultural vein, or expressing some sort of parental nightmare, it's just echoing those prior ones in a totally unsatisfying way.\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\nIt's the kind of film that appears to have been made by filmmakers who don't understand a thing about storytelling, pacing, tone, or atmosphere, which is only made all the more shocking by the fact that it was directed by the legendary John Carpenter.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nThe real shock came when I noticed that a woman filing out of the premiere screening beside me had actually marked her rating card with an \"excellent\" grade.\n\nAugust 15, 2017"
