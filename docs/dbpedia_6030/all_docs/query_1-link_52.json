        "text": "Village of the Damned | 1960\n\nVillage of the Damned location: the village of ‘Midwich’: Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire\n\nThis genuinely creepy sci-fi horror, from John Wyndham’s novel The Midwich Cuckoos, has a clutch of unemotional, super-intelligent kids born simultaneously in a small English village. The damned village of ‘Midwich’ is Letchmore Heath, just east of Watford and, conveniently, within four miles of MGM’s Borehamwood Studios.\n\nThis area of southeast England is so convenient for studios that it is jam-packed with filming locations. In fact, so many TV series of the 60s and 70s were filmed around here that it's been dubbed Avengerland. TV fans, check out the excellently detailed Avengerland site.\n\nAmong the many other films shot in the immediate area are The Abominable Dr Phibes, The Vampire Lovers, The Devil Rides Out, and Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita."
