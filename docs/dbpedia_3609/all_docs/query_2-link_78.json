The DIT has its roots in Kohlbergâ€™s original stage theory of moral judgment development and asks respondents to rank a set of stage typed statements in order of importance on six stories. However, the question to what extent the DIT-data match the underlying stage model was never addressed with a statistical model. Therefore, we applied item response theory (IRT) to a large data set (55,319 cases). We found that the ordering of the stages as extracted from the raw data fitted the ordering in the underlying stage model good. Furthermore, difficulty differences of stages across the stories were found and their magnitude and location were visualized. These findings are compatible with the notion of one latent moral developmental dimension and lend support to the hundreds of studies that have used the DIT-1 and by implication support the renewed DIT-2.\n\nNo References for this article.\n\nNo Supplementary Data.\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics\n\nKeywords: Defining Issues Test (DIT); item response theory (IRT); moral judgment; stage\n\nDocument Type: Research Article\n\nAffiliations: 1: Department of Developmental Psychology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands 2: Department of Educational Psychology, University of Alabama, College of Education, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA\n\nPublication date: 02 October 2019\n\nMore about this publication?\n\nEditorial Board\n\nInformation for Authors\n\nSubscribe to this Title\n\nIngenta Connect is not responsible for the content or availability of external websites\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\n\nFree content\n\nPartial Free content\n\nNew content\n\nOpen access content\n\nPartial Open access content\n\nSubscribed content\n\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content"
