(May 2016)\n\nThe purpose of this descriptive case study was to assess the status of vocal (KayPentax APM) and noise (Etymotic ER200D dosimeter) dosages acquired by an elementary school music teacher (N=1) during waking hours across (a) a full teaching week (5 days) and (b) 2 weekends (4 days), one prior to and one and after the teaching week. Various studies to date have examined vocal dosages acquired by music teachers. Other studies have analyzed noise dosages acquired by music teachers. No study, however, has yet examined vocal and noise dosages acquired simultaneously by the same music teacher. Primary findings indicated: (a) mean vocal distance doses and noise doses acquired during teaching hours exceeded doses acquired during non-teaching hours; (b) the most elevated Dd and noise dosage levels occurred during choir rehearsals and sixth grade general music classes; (c) the participant exceeded recommended NIOSH noise doses on 4 of the 5 teaching days. (d) comparison of noise dose percentage and vocal dose percentage during teaching hours indicated, overall, that voice dose percentage appeared to align directionally with noise dose percentage; (e) however, there were some class periods where vocal dose percentage exceeded noise dose percentage. These results were discussed in terms of proactive voice and hearing care for elementary school music teachers, possible relationships between acquired vocal and noise doses, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research.\n\nBrown, Debra R.Listening Lesson Practices in the Elementary General Music Classroom: A Mixed Method Approach. ME-PHD, DH 2016. (May 2016)\n\nThe purpose of the study was to examine elementary general music teachers’ listening lesson practices in kindergarten through sixth grade using a mixed-method research design. The listening lesson practices were investigated by musical genres used and by curricular application of the music. The belief system for the role of listening lessons in the curriculum was examined as well as materials and technology used to teach the lessons. Finally, the frequency and duration of the lessons were investigated. Two phases of research were implemented using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design (Creswell, 2014). The first phase consisted of an online survey distributed to all NAfME members in the Midwest identifying as elementary general music teachers (n = 4,432). The second phase followed, that consisted of personal interviews with Midwestern elementary general music teachers (n = 6). Data from the survey questions were analyzed through percentages and frequency counts. From the survey data, the open-ended questions for the interviews were constructed. The interview participants were distributed evenly in three locales, two rural, two suburban, and two urban. They lived in three different Midwestern states and worked in six different districts. Each phase-two participant was interviewed twice for about 30 minutes. The researcher transcribed all interviews and coded them using Gilligan’s listening guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, & Bertsch, 2006). Results indicated the participants integrated listening lessons into their instruction regularly. Though they used listening lessons to teach biographical, historical, and/or cultural aspects of music, they showed a preference for listening lessons integrated with musical element concepts such as timbre, form, rhythm, meter, melody, harmony, texture, tempo, and/or dynamics. Participants used a variety of materials to teach the lessons, which included published as well as participant-generated resources. Technologies used to present the music included digital recordings, images, and various video materials viewed on a monitor or projected. Participants felt that listening ivlessons supported curricular goals for singing and playing skills, music literacy, and creating music. The lessons were also connected to teaching about performers, composers, historical topics, and cultural music. Participants indicated that most used 11-30% of their class sessions teaching listening lessons. Younger children had lessons of shorter duration. The duration did not generally affect the frequency of lessons; however, the topic, for example form, sometimes affected the duration. Participants incorporated listening lessons for four reasons; (a) as exposure to music genres, (b) to reinforce or introduce musical concepts, (c) to aid in classroom management, (d) as an expectation of the profession. Recommendations and implications were discussed in connection to these results.\n\nCaine, Kara N. A Conceptual Framework for a Music-Based Bonding Intervention for Fathers with Premature Infants in the NICU. MT-MME, DH 2016 (May 2016).\n\nPremature birth has long-term effects on an infant’s development. Admittance to the NICU is stressful for both the infant and the parents. In this environment, parents may have barriers to bonding with their infant, making it more difficult to form a secure infant-caregiver attachment. The quality of attachment between an infant-caregiver can be predictive of future psychopathology or can act as a protective factor. Research is emerging regarding the father’s distinct role and experience of becoming a parent in the NICU, and no published music therapy literature has focused specifically on fathers and their bonding and attachment with their premature infants in the NICU. The purpose of this study is to understand the unique experience of fathers with a premature infant admitted to the NICU in order to generate a conceptual framework, grounded in theory, for how music therapy intervention can increase secure father-infant attachment relationships. An iterative review of literature, and ecological systems theory and causal modeling were used to identify the key constructs relevant to the father’s unique experience in this setting. A theory-based conceptual framework for a music-based bonding intervention for fathers with premature infants in the NICU is illustrated. Implications for further research and clinical practice were also explored.\n\nChin, Yu-Ling. Exploring the Feasibility of Group Musical Dual-Task Training in Community-Dwelling Older Adults Who Have Concerns About Falls.MT-PHD, CC 2016. (May 2016)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and limited efficacy of Group Musical Dual-Task Training (G-MDTT) for community-dwelling older adults who had concerns about falls. G-MDTT asked the participants to practice performing two music-related tasks at the same time and was designed to reduce fall risk factors including impairment of executive function, dual-task cost, and balance, and concerns about falls. Six participants with a mean age of 79 volunteered for the study. They were requested to attend a 40-minute group session, two times a week, across one month, for a total of eight sessions. Overall results support the feasibility of GMDTT to community-dwelling older adults who have concerns about falls and revealed the potential of G-MDTT to reduce the dual-task cost on walking speed in task-specific trained tasks such as “Subtraction 3” task and “Auditory Stroop” task, with some modifications. Recommendations for modifications were discussed and included in the G-MDTT Intervention Manual for clinical application.\n\nFitch, Katie N. Music Therapy Internship Directors’ Perspectives on the Importance of Emotional Intelligence. MT-MME, CC 2016. (December 2015).\n\nEmotional Intelligence is one’s ability to perceive and use emotional information in oneself and in others, and to make decisions based on this information. It is made up of emotional competencies, which encompass perceptions and expressions of the self, relational interactions, decision-making, as well as coping and regulation skills. To date, little information is available concerning the observation and assessment of the emotional competencies in music therapy students as they navigate the internship application process. This study investigated the extent to which a student’s Emotional Intelligence impacts National Roster Internship Directors’ decision-making processes for determining a student’s suitability to their internships. Specifically, it examined the importance of Emotional Intelligence in determining student suitability, the methods used during the internship application process to assess the emotional competencies, and the importance of Emotional Intelligence as compared with other skills typically assessed. Fifty-four National Roster Internship Directors completed an online survey. Responses were collapsed and examined using descriptive statistics. Internship Directors indicated that Emotional Intelligence is an important factor in selecting their interns. All respondents indicated that the emotional competency, Empathy, was either ‘important’ or ‘very important’ (on a Likert-type scale ranging from ‘very unimportant’ to ‘very important’) in determining a student’s suitability. The development of consistent language regarding Emotional Intelligence may provide cohesion between Internship Directors and Academic Program Directors and better prepare students to thrive in the music therapy profession.\n\nJoplin, Kendall. Survey Results For the Current State of Censorship in Adult Psychiatric Music Therapy Sessions. MT-MME, AD 2016. (May 2016)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate current censorship practices and beliefs of music therapists working in adult mental health settings. The research questions are: (a) what music, or elements of music, do music therapists censor during music therapy sessions? (b) If music therapists censor, what are their reasons for censoring? The participants for this study were 42 board-certified music therapists who completed an online survey investigating their current censorship practices within sessions. Censorship was broadly defined as music therapists refraining from using, or redirecting clients away from using, certain lyrics, themes, songs, or genres of music during therapist planning and facilitation of sessions. The majority of respondents (78.57%) censor at least one musical element, including themes (69.05%), lyrics (66.67%), and genres (16.67%). Reasons for censorship revolved around issues with treatment, including other group members’ responses, client comfortableness, emotional distress, self-esteem issues, and negative impact on the therapeutic relationship. However, about 25% reported personal beliefs affected censorship, such as their comfort with the content, religious beliefs, and believing the client cannot benefit in any way from hearing the music. Further research needs to be conducted on how lyrics, themes, and genres impact clients, and if these elements facilitated by a music therapist could be used to address and work through some of the issues and concerns presented by the music.\n\nMartin, Tenessa G. Teacher Time Use in an Elementary General Music Classroom. ME-MME, DH 2016. (December 2015).\n\nThe workload of a teacher is often demanding, and according to a variety of studies, often causes teachers high levels of stress and early burnout. To better understand the composition of that workload, a descriptive case study was undertaken to investigate specific time use. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to learn how an elementary music teacher spent her time during the workday in teaching and non-teaching activities. The participant, purposefully selected on her schedule variety and willingness to participate, taught music in an elementary school in a Midwest suburban school district. Her teaching load included kindergarten through sixth grade (roughly ages 5-12) and seven blocks of class times per day with each grade being represented for forty-five minutes each, demonstrating a typical teaching assignment. The study was conducted using a three-pronged approach and focused on one music teacher in one elementary school. The data were collected from a self-reported time diary, direct observations, and an interview. Data were analyzed for the participant’s time diary and the observer’s diary for: (a) instructional time and non-instructional time and (b) particular activities related to each category; and for the interview, for narrative explanations of time usage. Results indicated that the participant was required to be present at work for seven hours and fifteen minutes each day. Of that time, the participant was required to teach class for five hours and fifteen minutes. Over the four-day investigation period, which included a self-reported time diary and direct observations from the researcher, the participant exceeded her requirement by a total of seven hours and thirty minutes, essentially working the equivalent of an additional day. Over the four-day investigation period, the results indicate the participant spent 1,270 minutes or 57.99% on instructional activities which centered on singing and playing instruments; and 905 minutes or 41.32% on non-instructional activities, particularly on set-up/cleanup time and personal business. The iv results also showed the participant was consistent in her time usage. From the interview, data demonstrated that time was a challenge and inadequate to complete necessary tasks. The findings in this study suggest that adequate preparation time is important to actual classroom teaching.\n\nRollings, Amelia A. Head Over Heels: The Effects of Three Heel Heights on Postural and Acoustical Measures of University Female Voice Majors, and Measured Relationships Between Heel Height, Pitch, Vowel, Behavior, Head Position, Jaw Opening, and dB SPL. ME-PHD, JD 2016. (August 2015).\n\nThe purpose of this study was (a) to determine the effects, if any, of 3 simulated heel height conditions (0.0 in., 1.5 in., 3.0 in.) on postural (head position, jaw opening) and acoustical (LTAS, dB SPL) measures of university female voice majors (N = 35) in 2 conditions (silence, singing sustained [α] and [i] vowels on each pitch of a 2-octave A-major scale [A3-A5]), and then to (b) assess selected relationships between heel height behavior conditions, postural data, and acoustical data.\n\nPrimary finding included significant main effects for heel height, pitch, vowel, behavior, and formant location conditions on participants’ postural and acoustical data. As heel height increased, participants significantly (a) decreased head position angle 1 and angle 2, (b) decreased jaw opening, (c) decreased LTAS mean signal energy, and (d) increased amplitude (dB SPL). When singing the open vowel of [α] compared to the closed vowel of [i], participants significantly (a) increased head position angle 1 and angle 2, (b) increased jaw opening, and (c) increased amplitude (dB SPL). From silent to singing behaviors, participants significantly (a) increased head position angle 1 and angle 2, and (b) increased jaw opening. Participants significantly increased head position angle 1, head position angle 2, and jaw opening when singing pitches above the point where the fundamental frequency (F0) would equal or exceed the first format frequency (F1) of the low pitch of A3.\n\nData analyses yielded multiple significant interactions between independent variables and indicated significant, moderate to strong, positive relationships between (a) pitch and dB SPL, (b) pitch and jaw opening, (c) jaw opening and behavior, (d) jaw opening and head position angle 1, and (e) jaw opening and dB SPL, and significant, moderate, negative correlations between (a) jaw opening and vowel, and (b) heel height and head position angle 1.\n\nResults were discussed in terms of general outcomes, considerations for vocal music education and voice research, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future investigations.\n\nKeywords: heel height, pitch, vowel, head position, jaw opening, formant tuning\n\nSkarbakka, Lisa. The Influence of Music-Assisted Coping Strategies on Dyspnea, Anxiety, and Self-Efficacy for Patients in Home Care Occupational Therapy: A Feasibility Study. MME-MT, CC 2016. (August 2015).\n\nReview of Literature: Current dyspnea research shows a need for more investigation of nonpharmacologic interventions that promote self-efficacy, address multiple dimensions of dyspnea, and help disrupt dyspnea-anxiety cycles. Clinical studies and emerging information on the neurophysiological effects of music show evidence and potential mechanisms for music to enhance dyspnea self-management strategies.\n\nMethods: The researchers recruited participants receiving home care occupational therapy for dyspnea management. Participants received an audio compact disc with verbal cues for guided relaxation and breathing techniques, with or without supportive music based on random assignment. Participants were asked to complete Modified Borg Dyspnea Scales for dyspnea intensity and unpleasantness (MBDS-I and MBDS-U) and a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) before and after each practice period, as well as a Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale (SECD6) at the beginning and end of the treatment period.\n\nResults: Three participants initiated the study, and data was collected for one participant with COPD (n=1). The pre-treatment SECD6 reflected moderate self-efficacy, and a posttreatment SECD6 was not collected. The MBDS-I, MBDS-U, and SUDS showed consistent decreases between pre- and post-intervention (mean decrease of 1.4 points in dyspnea intensity, 1.9 points in dyspnea unpleasantness, and 3 points in subjective distress).\n\nDiscussion: Though the data showed decreases in dyspnea and anxiety, the sample size was too small to interpret the results. The study revealed potential improvements for future research.\n\nKeywords: dyspnea, occupational therapy, coping strategies, self-management, music intervention, breathing, relaxation\n\nSmiley, Alison. A Systematic Review of Attachment-Based Interventions for Caregivers and Young Children Living in Poverty. MME-MT, DHA 2016. (May 2016).\n\nAlmost half of the 11 million children under the age of three in the United States live in low-income families. Early childhood may be the developmental period most sensitive to the conditions affected by income and living in poverty places children at greater risk for low quality attachment. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize common themes, differences and shortcomings of interventions that aim to improve child-caregiver attachment and caregiver behaviors with children under the age of three who have been identified as living in poverty or a low socioeconomic background. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction identified specific intervention characteristics and the quality of intervention reporting using the TIDieR checklist. Characteristics of the caregivers, children, and interventionists involved in the studies, intervention delivery method, group or individual intervention, location of intervention implementation, the duration, and dose of the intervention were coded from each article. Studies were also analyzed to identify cultural aspects of the participants involved in the interventions, and how those characteristics may have modified or changed the interventions. TIDieR intervention guidelines clearly revealed that more detail was needed in all aspects of intervention reporting. Identification and description of the procedures and materials were most often missing, making it difficult to compare and contrast intervention procedures, and replication of interventions. However, common characteristics of interventions were noted. Mothers were the primary caregivers involved in the intervention, most of were delivered face-to-face (n=18) and in the home (n=17). The majority of interventions (n=14) were provided in individual family/dyad settings as opposed to group settings. Eight studies addressed cultural characteristics regarding the participants involved or how attachment definitions may change regarding participants’ culture; most addressed language (n=6). Based on the results of this systematic review, it is recommended that interventions to enhance child-caregiver attachment and caregiver behaviors for those living in poverty should incorporate a multidimensional and culturally relevant approach, and be reported in a detailed way to allow for deep understanding and replication of the interventions.\n\nTast, Rebecca L. Jacquelyn Dillon: An Innovative Force in String Music Education in the United States. ME-PHD, CJ 2016. (August 2015).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to provide a history of Jacquelyn Dillon’s life, career, and influence on string music education. Although this study covered Dillon’s childhood and education, the primary research questions centered around the regional and national aspects of her career and the impact of these events on string music education in the United States.\n\nThe most important contribution of Jacquelyn Dillon’s career involves her usage and promotion of the heterogeneous string classroom teaching method, especially with beginning-level strings classes. Throughout her early teaching career, Jacquelyn Dillon explored and refined her skills teaching large heterogeneous classes. Dillon’s early teaching experiences, coupled with her work in the music industry, allowed her to turn the organization and development of a public school string and orchestra program, using the heterogeneous method of teaching, into a process that anyone could replicate.\n\nDillon was the first to provide a highly detailed, step-by-step approach to developing and teaching string and orchestra programs at all levels in her book, How toDesign and Teach a Successful School String and Orchestra Program. This text was the only one available at the time to provide a comprehensive approach to every aspect of the public school orchestra program. She then carried the process one step further in offering the Strictly Strings method book series, which contained a sequential approach to teaching beginning-level strings in a heterogeneous classroom setting.\n\nAt Wichita State University, Jacquelyn Dillon built a string music education program that gained national recognition as being on the forefront of change for teacher training procedures. It was through her work, that Wichita State University became known as one of a few select institutions that were producing quality string music educators in the United States during this time.\n\nJacquelyn Dillon is one of many individuals who have shaped the field of string music education to its current form. Her lasting contributions and resulting influence on the profession have made Jacquelyn Dillon deserving of a place in the written history of string music education in the United States.\n\nTerrell, Daniel B. Examination of the Patterns of Band Ratings at the Iowa High School Music Association State Large Group Festival. ME-MME, CJ 2016. (August 2015).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the patterns of ratings received by concert bands at the Iowa High School Music Association (IHSMA) State Large Group Festival from 2006 through 2014. Specifically, trends related to classification (school size), geography (district assignment), and literature selections were examined. Data used to examine patterns in classification and district were collected from the Iowa High School Music Association. The district assignments designated by the Iowa Bandmasters Association were adopted. It was found that school classification was an indicator of differences in ratings received at the festival. Post hoc comparisons indicated that ratings for Class 1A are significantly lower than Class 2A which are significantly lower than Class 3A and Class 4A. District assignment was also an indicator of differences in ratings. Post hoc comparisons indicated that only the Southwest district had significantly different (lower) ratings than the other five districts. Data used to observe patterns regarding literature selections were collected from band directors at schools where the festival was hosted over the nine-year span of the study. Despite incomplete records of performance literature, certain discernible trends were noted. Compositions with a difficulty level of “Grade 4”, newer pieces, and works by Frank Ticheli tended to receive higher ratings at the festival.\n\nWheeler, Beth A. The Effect of Using a Recording Paired With Specific Feedback On the Self-Evaluation Calibration Accuracy of Novice Performers.ME-PHD, CJ 2016. (May 2016).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using a recording of students’ performance paired with specific feedback on the ability of middle school performers to accurately assess their own performance. Two conditions were employed: the introduction of specific verbal feedback while listening to a recording of the group’s performance (treatment) and listening to a recording of the group’s performance with no verbal feedback (control). The independent variable was the use of verbal feedback, and the dependent variable was the difference in calibration scores. Other factors examined for possible effects on the dependent variable include event, loci of focus (group versus self) and performance level (low-level versus high-level). Three research questions guided this study: (1) To what extent does specific feedback, combined with self-evaluation using a recording, promote self-calibration accuracy among middle school performers in instrumental music environments? (2) To what extent does the specific feedback impact the bands’ performance improvement, thus reflecting a group increased awareness over repeated events? (3) To what extent are middle school students able to differentiate their individual performance from the performance of the group in instrumental music environments? The band in the treatment condition started off worse, but improved more than the control group band. Students in the treatment group became better at differentiating their performance from the performance of the group than did the students in the control band. Differences noted for increases in awareness in the group environment did not transfer to calibration improvements in the solo performances. Entry level performance skills did not impact calibration awareness results. Verbal feedback worked for all students across the group.\n\n2017\n\nBybee, Molly R. Music Therapists and Work: Experiences of Occupational Oppression in the Profession of Music Therapy. MT-MME, DH 2017. (May 2017).\n\nOccupational oppression is a system of invisible barriers created by those in power that reduces the professional’s ability to perform work at the highest level. Barriers result from a combination of beliefs related to the value or worth of set occupations and their members. Occupational oppression is based on the assumption that certain professions are inherently superior or inferior. Barriers result from a combination of beliefs related to the value or worth of set occupations and their members. Oppressive experiences have been described within music therapy literature on burnout. However, the phenomenon of occupational oppression has not been explored within the profession of music therapy. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to establish and describe the phenomenon of occupational oppression within the profession of music therapy. Experiences of oppression were described using Young’s five categories of oppression – marginalization, cultural imperialism, exploitation, violence, and powerlessness (1990). Participants, 634 currently practicing board-certified music therapists, completed an online survey that was comprised of multiple choice, Likert-scale, and short-answer questions. Results support the existence of occupational oppression within the profession of music therapy. A majority of participants identified as having experienced oppression within their workplaces (56%) and identified the profession as being oppressed (76.6%). All of Young’s five categories of oppression (1990) were reported within participants’ responses. Forms of cultural imperialism were described most frequently, followed by marginalization, exploitation, powerlessness, and violence. Descriptions of experienced oppression occurred both in respondents who did and did not identify as having experienced oppression, suggesting that music therapists may have difficulty labeling oppressive experiences. Acknowledging occupational oppression within the iv profession of music therapy may be a critical first step towards developing solutions to improve workplace experiences for music therapists.\n\nDavis, Megan. The Effect of Music Therapy on Joint Attention Skills in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. MT-MME, CC 2017. (August 2016).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore further whether children with Autism Spectrum Disorder displayed more joint attention behaviors—interacting and requesting joint attention—during music therapy, cooperative play, or independent play conditions. Joint attention is defined as the shifting of attention between an object or event and an individual. The effects of different types of music therapy interventions on these joint attention behaviors were also examined. Participants (n = 4) engaged in 3 session types: 1) cooperative music therapy, 2) cooperative play, and 3) independent play. Using a 15- second observe, 5-second record time sampling method, intervals were coded for the presence or absence of interacting and requesting behaviors. Data were graphed and a visual analysis of the data revealed that a higher percentage of interacting behaviors occurred during music conditions than both cooperative and independent play conditions across participants. Data for requesting behaviors was inconsistent across participants, and therefore the results were inconclusive. Graphic analysis of the effects of music therapy intervention types on joint attention behaviors revealed that when the participant and researcher played the same instrument more interactions occurred, whereas when the researcher and participant played different instruments more requesting behaviors occurred.\n\nEdwards, Evan R. All Tied Up: The Effect of Wearing a Necktie on Acoustic and Perceptual Measures of Male Choral and Solo Singing. ME-MME, JD 2017 (May 2017).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess acoustically (long-term average spectra and multi-dimensional voice profile) and perceptually (participant perceived phonatory ease and expert listening panel) the effect of wearing a necktie on male singing in choral (Experiment 1) and solo (Experiment 2) settings. No study to date has assessed the potential effects of wearing neckties in both choral and solo vocal settings. Among primary results: (a) statistically significant differences in spectral energy between performances with and without a necktie in both the choral (2-4 kHz) and solo (0-10 kHz) settings, (b) increases in mean jitter and shimmer percentage measurements of solo singers with necktie, (c) significant reduction in perceived phonatory ease when singing while wearing a necktie in choral and solo settings, and (d) listener preferences for singing without a necktie in solo and homophonic choral settings. Results were discussed in terms of limitations of the study, suggestions for future research, and implications for voice pedagogy.\n\nKeywords: necktie, choral singing, solo singing, long-term average spectra, multi-dimensional voice profile, perceived phonatory ease, expert listening panel\n\nHutchison, Steven J. The Effect of Providing Band Students with a Simplified Score on Their Performance Quality and Perceptions of Their Experience. ME-MME, CJ 2017. (August 2016).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of providing band students with a simplified score on their performance quality and perceptions of their experience. Subjects were students (N = 38) enrolled in two intact high school band ensembles at two different K-12 parochial schools in the Midwest. Subjects learned and performed two pieces of band literature; one with traditional single-line parts and one with an experimental simplified score. Pretest and posttest recordings were made of band performances with each score type and then rated by professional music educators (N = 33). In addition, students filled out a reflective survey about their experience learning and performing the piece with each score type. Rehearsals were also video recorded to observe student and instructor behaviors in relation to the score type used. Results of video analysis and coding did reveal a few significant differences; however, these could possibly be attributed to instructor individuality. Survey results indicated there was no effect of score type on the positivity of a student’s perception of the learning experience. However, results did show students liked the new simplified score. The results of the simplified score’s effect on performance quality varied between schools and no significant effect of score type was found. However, further analysis suggested there may be more learning potential with the simplified score.\n\nJoseph, Megan. Clinical Decisions of Music Therapists in the Treatment of Individuals with Eating Disorders. MT-MME, CC 2017. (May 2017).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine common treatment goals and subsequent musicbased interventions used by music therapists who work/worked with patients with eating disorders and to begin gathering information on the intentional adaptation of the elements of music commonly used to increase success of these treatment outcomes. Further, the intent of this survey was to provide a synthesis and overview of current clinical practice and wisdom useful to students and clinical music therapists interested in working with this population or those interested in conducting intervention-based research to determine the impact of music-based interventions on the needs of individuals with eating disorders. Emails were obtained from the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) for music therapists working in private practice, general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, mental health facilities, and eating disorder recovery centers. Results of the survey found that majority of participants did not work full time with people with eating disorders and indicated that 1-5% of their caseload was dedicated to people with eating disorders. The top two goal areas and associated interventions were emotional expression using improvisational instrument play and songwriting interventions and decreasing anxiety using relaxation/imagery interventions. The top chosen musical elements to adapt were lyrics and rhythm adapted in the context of improving verbal and non-verbal expression. Further findings and implications are discussed.\n\nKim, Borin. An Examination of Differences between Music Therapy and Talk Therapy on Intimacy in a Family-Patient Relationship at the End-of-Life. MT-MME, AD 2017. (December 2016).\n\nThe purpose of the study was to examine differences between music therapy and talk therapy on intimacy in a family-patient relationship at the end-of-life. The present study examined if music therapy is different from talk therapy in developing intimacy in a relationship between family caregivers and patients approaching death. To determine differences between music therapy and talk therapy, the researcher measured frequency of intimacy for ten family caregivers of dying patients, as indicated by (a) verbal intimacy, (b) affective intimacy, and (c) physical intimacy. Results showed no significant differences in verbal intimacy actions of family caregivers towards a dying loved one when comparing music therapy with talk therapy. Significant differences were found in affective intimacy and physical intimacy between the treatments. Music therapy resulted in significantly higher affective intimacy, and physical intimacy measures, when compared to talk therapy. Music therapy may be an effective therapeutic modality for family caregivers of dying patients to increase emotional and physical intimacy in a family-patient relationship at the end-of-life.\n\nLesiak, Marie. Mindfulness-Based Music Therapy Group Protocol for Individuals With Serious Mental Illness and Chronic Illnesses: A Feasibility Study. MT-MME, AD 2017 (May 2017).\n\nMindfulness is the practice of being fully aware of the internal and external happenings in the present moment (Kabat-Zinn, 2012). The purpose of this research study was to determine the feasibility of a mindfulness-based music therapy protocol for people with a combined serious mental illness and chronic illness. The research questions included: To what extent can the mindfulness-based music therapy protocol be delivered as intended to participants? Does this six-week mindfulness-based music therapy protocol affect (a) emotional, psychological, and social well-being and/or (b) increase mindfulness? Nine adults diagnosed with a serious mental illness and chronic illness participated in the six-week mindfulness-based music therapy protocol. Participants completed the Mental Health Continuum- Short Form (MHC-SF) (Keyes, 2009) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) (Brown and Ryan, 2003) as pre- and post-test measures. The researcher implemented the mindfulness-based music therapy protocol as intended with minor modifications. Suggestions for future implementation are indicated. Due to fluctuating attendance and limited numbers for follow-up, the researcher used descriptive statistics to analyze change from pre-test to post-test. Results indicated an overall positive change in mindfulness scores, but a decrease in well-being scores. Follow-up questionnaire responses were positive and indicated psychosocial benefits as a result of participating in the group. Clinical implications for music therapists interested in implementing a similar mindfulness-based music therapy protocol are included.\n\nNelson, Heather R. The Effects of Actual Recital Hall and Four Digitally-Produced Variable Practice Room Environments on Phonatory, Acoustical, and Perceptual Measures of Vocal Performances by Experienced Female Singers. ME-PHD, JD 2017 (December 2016).\n\nVirtual acoustics practice rooms have been marketed as a means to simulate acoustics of larger performance venues, thus potentially allowing users to practice as if they were in a given performance venue. No study to date has examined singer phonation behaviors in such virtual acoustics environments, compared these behaviors to phonation behaviors exhibited by the same singers in an actual recital hall, and solicited singer perceptions of virtual acoustics environments.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess selected phonation behaviors and perceptions of female vocal soloists (N = 20) as they performed in two rooms: (a) a university Recital Hall, and (b) an individual practice room with 4 digitally-adjustable simulations of reverberation and reflections (Practice Room, Large Auditorium, Large Recital Hall, and Arena). Participants performed the same sung material at the same tempo in each environment, with the order of the 5 environments randomized among participants to control for potential order effect.\n\nPrimary results of this study indicated that participants on the whole (a) exhibited significantly greater mean distance dose and timbral spectral energy in the Real Recital Hall than in the virtual acoustic conditions and (b) perceived significantly greater hearing efficiency and singing efficiency in the Real Recital Hall compared to the four simulated conditions. Although (c) there appeared to be no significant relationships between participants' exhibited amplitude and their perceptions of hearing and singing efficiency, (d) participant comments favored singing in the Real Recital Hall over singing with the virtual acoustic conditions.\n\nRawlings, Nicholas W. The Impact of Music-vs. Athletics-Based Social Skills Training on Adult-and Self- Ratings of Social Competence and Antisocial Behavior of At-Risk Youth.MT-MME, CC 2017 (August 2016).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a music therapy-based social skills training program compared to an athletics-based social skills training program for children with social skills deficits and interfering behavior problems. Eight fifth and sixth grade boys age 10-11 who had displayed social skills deficits or interfering behaviors in the school setting participated in five 1-hour social skills training (SST) sessions once a week for five weeks. The participants rated themselves on measures of Social Competence and Antisocial Behavior at pretest and posttest using the Multisource Assessment of Social Competence Scale (MASCS). The participants’ homeroom teacher and para-educator rated each participant on measures of Social Competence and Antisocial Behavior using the School Social Behavior Scales, Second Edition (SSBS-2). Results were mixed and varied according to the rater. Teacher ratings of multiple dimensions of Antisocial Behavior indicated the Music Group improved significantly more than the Basketball Group and indicated Defiant/Disruptive increased for the Basketball Group. Conversely, para-educators ratings of Social Competence and Antisocial Behavior indicated the Basketball Group improved while a decrease in functioning was observed for the music group although no significant results were obtained. Self-ratings of Social Competence decreased in both groups from pretest to posttest with the Music Group ratings decreasing more than the Basketball Group. Self-ratings of antisocial Behavior did not reveal any significant differences between or within groups. Future researchers should continue to work with small groups (three to six participants per group) but should repeat each condition with multiple groups in order to increase the sample size overall. Future studies should also consider increasing the number of sessions per week and extending the overall length of participation in an SST program.\n\nSims, Julia D. A Phenomenological Examination of Imposter Phenomenon in Music Therapy Students. MT-MME, DH 2017 (May 2017).\n\nThe current study investigated the prevalence, or lack thereof, of imposter phenomenon in music therapy students. Imposter phenomenon (IP) is an internal experience that describes feelings of fraudulence an individual may encounter, regardless of their achievements. A sample of music therapy students (n = 7) at a large, Midwestern AMTA-approved university were recruited to participate in one-time focus groups. An interpretive phenomenological analysis was performed on the transcripts, resulting in the development of three recurrent themes of discussion regarding IP: (a) uncertainty in transitions, (b) challenges of the music therapy profession, and (c) awareness and impact of IP constructs and patterns. These findings provide insight into the prevalence of IP in this population, and inform professors, supervisors, and other key stakeholders about the needs may of developing music therapy students. In addition, these findings aid in further solidifying and modifying the guiding theoretical framework of this study.\n\nStefan, Emily J. Effects of Conductor Preparatory Gesture Direction on Diaphragmatic Breathing of Individual Singers. ME-MME, MG 2017 (May 2017).\n\nThis study examined teenage participants’ (N=30) lateral abdominal expansion while breathing before singing America and viewing a videotaped conductor demonstrating an upward or downward preparatory gesture. PhiMatrix grid overlay software placed over participant videos allowed for measurement of abdominal expansion in millimeters. Results indicated: (a) a difference in abdominal expansion measurement, although not significant, between breaths taken while observing upward and downward conductor preparatory gestures; (b) no significant overall difference on measurement of lateral abdominal expansion when comparing all participants; (c) participants with knowledge of diaphragmatic breathing had consistently larger abdominal measurements than participants with little to no knowledge; (d) male participants consistently displayed larger abdominal measurements when compared to female participants in three out of the four categories; (e) female participants demonstrated a larger abdominal measurement while viewing the downward preparatory gesture than while viewing the upward preparatory gesture; and (f) participants with more choir experience results were not significantly different than participants with less choir experience.\n\nStewart, Lindsey M. Traditional Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Recorder. ME-MME, DH 2017 (December 2016).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether cooperative learning strategies or traditional direct instruction would more positively affect the performance achievement of fourth- and fifth-grade recorder students. It was hypothesized that students participating in cooperative learning activities might perform differently in the areas of pitch accuracy, rhythm accuracy, and tone production than students who participated in traditional instruction. Many studies have indicated that cooperative learning positively affects achievement in the general education classroom because it addresses factors that impact student learning such as motivation, participation, practice, and self-efficacy. Because achievement in music, like achievement in the general classroom, was affected by these factors, it was possible that cooperative learning combined with direct instruction might suggest different results in the area of recorder performance than direct instruction alone. This study was initiated in a public school in Kansas and included 61 students (N=61). There were two fourth-grade classes and two fifth-grade classes, with one class in each grade randomly assigned to the control (n=30 ) or experimental group (n= 31). Students met for six class periods of 45 minutes each over a three-week period of time. The control group participated in direct instruction followed by Kagan Cooperative Learning activities, and the experimental group participated in direct instruction followed by teacher-led, whole group practice. Identical written and performance pre- and post-tests were administered to individuals before and after the study was conducted. An analysis of co-variance determined statistical differences between control and experimental groups in the areas of overall score, pitch accuracy, and tone production, but not in the area of rhythmic accuracy.\n\nWade, Leanne M. A Pilot Study of Pursed Lip Breathing, Singing, and Kazoo Playing on Lung Function and Perceived Exertion of Participants Who Smoke. MT-PHD, CC 2017 (May 2017).\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\n\nSymptoms of COPD include persistent cough and dyspnea. Currently, music therapy protocols relating to COPD are therapist dependent and exceed 5-minutes. This pilot study examined if a 5- minute intervention of pursed lip breathing, singing or playing kazoo affected lung functioning or perceived physical exertion. Participants reported which interventions they found to be most helpful for breathing and whether they would choose to participate in those interventions either alone or with a music therapist. Participants completed a pre-intervention spirometry reading, all three 5-minute interventions (pursed lip breathing, singing, and kazoo playing) randomized to reduce order effect, and a post intervention spirometry. Participants completed the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion after each intervention and a post-intervention questionnaire. Participants ranked the interventions in order of which was perceived to be the most helpful for breathing. Mean results indicated pursed-lip breathing decreased the lung functioning while both singing and kazoo playing increased the lung functioning. The Ratings of Perceived Exertion results had minimal differences among interventions. Participants stated they would be willing to complete an intervention alone on a daily basis with three times a day being the most common answer. Participants ranked all three interventions similarly as being the most helpful to their breathing. Each music based 5-minute intervention (singing and playing kazoo) demonstrated a trend toward a positive change in lung functioning. The participants rated their perceived exertion as low with minimal change for all three interventions.\n\nKeywords: COPD, lung function, singing, kazoo, smoking\n\n2018\n\nGilespie, Melissa. Music Therapy In Public School Settings: Current Trends As Related To Service Provision Models. MT-MME, CC. 2018 (May 2018).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate existing school music therapy service provision, including the role of the therapist and models of service delivery to provide an up-to-date overview of the field as of 2017. Participants included board-certified music therapists working in public school settings (n = 217) who completed an online survey of demographic, job, and caseload characteristics; model(s) of service delivery; and decision-making variables that may impact chosen service delivery model(s). This study expands upon previous surveys by providing an updated and more detailed profile of practicing school music therapists and their caseloads, as well as considering variations from “traditional” service delivery models to provide a more complete picture of the public school music therapist in the 21st century. In comparison to the most recent school music therapy survey data from nearly two decades prior (Smith & Hairston, 1999), participating music therapists in the present study had more master’s degrees, were required to have dual certification less often, held more part-time positions, and had worked for less time in schools. Most music therapists provided direct services to whole, self-contained special education classrooms (68.4%). Comparisons of survey results indicate that relationships may exist between the model(s) of service delivery chosen by school music therapists and their (a) number of years employed as a public school music therapist, (b) region of employment, (c) additional certification held, (d) number of music therapists in the district, (e) SPED team model, and (f) how music therapy is listed on the IEP. Further findings and implications for clinicians, administrators, and music therapy educators are discussed. Future studies are warranted to understand the numerous variables related to school music therapy practice, support evidence-based practice, and promote the benefits of music therapy as a related service for students in public school settings.\n\nGlaser, Emily. An Exploration of Enrollment and Retention Trends of Beginning Band and Orchestra Students in the First Year of Instruction. ME-MME, CJ. 2018 (December 2017)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore student attitudes towards enrollment and retention in first-year beginning band and orchestra classrooms. A secondary purpose of this study was to investigate if different instrumental ensembles or various school settings demonstrated unique student attitudes regarding enrollment and retention rates in beginning band or orchestra classes.\n\nEnrollment and retention rates of participating ensembles were reported to supplement qualitative results. Seven categories of themes influencing enrollment and retention in beginning band and orchestra classes emerged through a constant comparative, grounded theory approach\n\nof analysis: (a) family, (b) fun, (c) music, (d) musical history, (e) opportunities, (f) social, and (g) teacher. Results indicated that students enrolled in their first year of beginning band or orchestra because of the encouragement or influence of a parent or trusted adult. All students that elected to continue their enrollment in band or orchestra after the first year of instruction did under perceived support from their parents and/or instrumental music teacher. Ensemble- and location specific results were found, but were interpreted as circumstantial. Further research is necessary to explore the unique enrollment trends of these groupings. Results were discussed in terms of their value to band and orchestra teachers, their relationship to existing literature, limitations, and suggestions for further research.\n\nHernandez-Ruiz, Eugenia.Parents can do it, too: Developing a model to coach parents in the use of music interventions for children with ASD (systematic review, conceptual framework and limited-efficacy study). ME-PHD MT.CJ. (May 2018).\n\nEarly intervention has been considered best practice for children at risk or diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders for at least a decade. However, professional services can be limited due to availability or cost constraints. Parent-mediated interventions, where parents are trained in effective strategies to support their child’s development, have been investigated as a viable alternative. In music therapy, such services are scarce. The present work attempted to develop a model for parent coaching of music interventions anchored in the Parent-Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM, Rogers et al., 2012). Three independent, yet connected, studies were undertaken: a systematic review of parent-mediated music interventions, development of a conceptual framework of parent coaching of such interventions, and a limited-efficacy study with an alternating treatment design. Results showed that parent education in music therapy is an emerging research interest, particularly in the last five years (2012-2017). An extensive narrative review of the literature in music, autism, and parent-mediated interventions showed that music could enhance the relationship-based treatment model by supporting the psychophysiological synchronicity of parent and children. Finally, a single-case study showed that parents can indeed learn the strategies and achieve initial fidelity, and that music might enhance the child’s communicative responses, compared to the original P-ESDM. Future research should study different approaches to music training that complement the P-ESDM coaching, as well as other feasibility measures.\n\nJang, Sekyung. Music-Based Emotion Regulation (MBER) Intervention Manual for Prevention of Depression in Older Persons. ME-PHD MT, CC 2018 (December 2017).\n\nDespite unprecedented growth of the aging population and the need for evidence-based programs that target prevention of age-related depression, there is paucity of such programs in and outside music therapy. Lack of music-guided prevention programs makes it challenging for music therapists to make informed decisions about how to use music to increase emotion regulation skills of older adults in depression prevention framework. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop an intervention manual based on the Music-based Emotion Regulation (MBER) model, a theoretical model that suggests four emotion regulation strategies targeting depression prevention in older persons (Jang, 2016b). The manual was created within two integrated models of intervention and manual development (i.e. Preventive Intervention Research Cycle, Stage Model of Manual Development) and provided program overview, theoretical mechanisms of change, literature support, Therapeutic Function of Music Plan, program delivery schedule, session-by-session content, and fidelity criteria. The intervention was designed and described in a way that supports transparent and detailed reporting which may contribute to increased clinical utility, facilitation of replication studies, and further refinement and tailoring of the intervention. The manual development process was strategically placed within the author’s own research and will direct future MBER research line. Implication for future research and clinical practice are discussed.\n\nListhartke, April. An Introduction and Evaluation of a Preventive Music Therapy Intervention in the Context of Poverty: A Conceptual Framework. MT-MME EQ, DH-A 2018 (January 2018).\n\nPoverty is a serious health problem accompanied by many consequential risk factors, that exist within Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory. These environmental and parental risk factors lead to complex trauma and toxic stress. When traumatic events occur early in life, there is a detrimental impact on the development of attachment, self-regulation, language development, and social skills. Preventive interventions can help support these impacted developmental areas. One preventive intervention, Therapist and Music Attuned Co-regulation (TMAC), was developed at an inner-city child development center (ICCDC). This research establishes the theoretical foundation of this intervention within the context of the needs of children and families living in poverty. In addition, a conceptual framework will be discussed and compared to these theoretical foundations. This research includes an evaluation of this intervention and whether it addresses the identified needs of the population, followed by future recommendations to further address the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\nMartin, Alan. Time Use and Reported Perceptions of University Voice Students During Self-Guided Practice Sessions: A Quantitative Content Analysis. ME-PHD, JFD 2018 (June 2017).\n\nLittle research has appraised the behaviors of musicians in practice rooms during self-guided practice sessions, and no study to date has investigated singers’ behaviors across multiple self-guided practice sessions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to document by audio-recordings and questionnaires the audible behaviors and expressed attitudes of university vocalists (N = 40) across 5 self-guided practice sessions with attention to (a) duration of practice sessions compared to previously expressed estimations, (b) participants’ attitudes and strategies with respect to vocal practicing, and (c) audible behaviors occurring during the first 15 minutes of practice. Among primary results: (a) Singers overall evidenced during the course of this study a mean practice session duration of 28 minutes; (b) There were significant differences in practice durations between male and female participants, and among some participants grouped according to reported years of voice lessons (<1-3 years and 6-9 years); (c) Mean estimations of participants’ practice durations based on prior questionnaire data exceeded by 9 minutes actual mean practice time; (d) A majority (65%) of singers said they followed an established practice routine, including a significantly greater percentage of female than male participants and a significantly greater percentage of students reporting more than three years of prior voice lessons than those reporting fewer years; (e) Undergraduate students indicated to a significantly greater extent than graduate students they had received advice on how to practice from a studio voice teacher; (f) Participants, on average, said they practiced 5 days per week; (g) Analyses of the first 15 minutes of recorded lessons indicated that these voice students on average spent the largest percentage of time (43%) on singing of repertoire, and the second largest percentage of practice time (36%) on warm-ups and vocal technical exercises, with non-performance majors spending significantly more time on repertoire and less time on technique than voice performance majors; (h) To a significant degree, practice time devoted to technique generally increased and time devoted to repertoire generally decreased as years of reported voice lessons (<1 – 9 years) increased; (i) Among participants overall, results indicated no significant difference between previously described modal first vocal practice behaviors (addressing warming up and technique) and actual first behaviors; (j) Of the 200 individual practice sessions examined, 141 (70.5%) began with singing behaviors not focused on repertoire. Results were discussed in terms of directions for future research, singing voice pedagogy, and limitations of the study.\n\nRigby, Lauren E. The Effects of Practice and Memorization Techniques on Goal Specificity among Novice Students. ME-MME, JMD 2018. (August 2017).\n\nThe purpose of this problem-driven content analysis was to examine differences between self-reported goals of novice high school orchestra students (N = 31) when given directions to either practice or memorize music during a 10-minute rehearsal. Participants were then interviewed about their definition of practice or memorization, what they did during rehearsal, and what they had planned to do during rehearsal. Findings from a Mann-Whitney U indicated no significant difference between median goal specificity among practicers and memorizers; however, results of interview coding revealed that participants who memorized demonstrated distinctly different rehearsal behaviors and goals than those who practiced, indicating unique strengths associated with each instruction. Profiles of what educators can expect to see from memorizers and practicers are included, and other implications for educators regarding deliberate practice are discussed.\n\nWeingarten, Kevin. Bringing Hands Together Through Music: Dick and Georgia Bassett and the Association for Music in International Schools. ME-MME, CJ 2018. (December 2017).\n\nThe Association for Music in International Schools (AMIS) is an international music education organization that currently serves 93 international schools in 53 countries on five continents. AMIS supports the students, teachers, and music programs of its member schools through honor ensemble festivals, conferences, and workshops held at various locales across the world each year, with 21 events taking place throughout the 2017-2018 school year. Though the scope of the organization is global today, its roots can be traced back to the creation of a standalone Honor Band and Choir Festival at the American School of London (ASL) in 1975 that provided an honor ensemble experience for the top music students at international schools across the United Kingdom. This honor band and choir owed its existence to the two founders of the organization, Dick and Georgia Bassett. The main goal of this research was to highlight the efforts of two remarkable, yet largely unknown, music educators who were integral to the advancement of western art music in international schools around the world. The research questions guiding this ethnographical account of the Bassetts’ and AMIS were: (1) How did the Bassetts come about creating and growing the AMIS organization and, (2) how has that organization impacted music education world-wide for the last 42 years? The narrative was constructed through analysis of Mrs. Bassett’s personal memoirs; extensive interviews with the Bassetts and current AMIS Executive Director, Keith Montgomery; informal interviews with AMIS teachers and festival conductors; AMIS Executive Council documents, including founding documents, board meeting minutes, and festival repertoire lists; and the discussions of AMIS teachers on the AMIS Music Educators’ Facebook Page. Mr. Bassett, an accomplished clarinetist, and Mrs. Bassett, a vocalist and violinist, met at Oberlin Conservatory, where they were studying to become music educators. The Bassetts’ Iv participation in honor ensembles in their formative years and in the “Oberlin in Salzburg” program - a year-long study abroad experience for Oberlin music majors at the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg – provided the inspiration to look for opportunities for teaching overseas. “We were just sure we wanted to be different; to do something different” (Bassett G., Interview with author). Throughout their career, the Bassetts held teaching positions at the American Community School of Athens, Greece, the Community School in Tehran, Iraq, and ultimately in ASL in London, England, where the honor festivals began. Over the next twenty years, the festival grew in size and geographic scope, and other festivals were added to the calendar, as well. Officially founded in 1996, AMIS has continued to expand ever since to the global organization it is today. In 2014, the Bassetts officially retired from AMIS, but they still maintain active ties to the organization as consultants. AMIS creates musical experiences in international schools that would otherwise be unavailable to them: a professional network for teachers, unique learning opportunities for music students, and the promotion of music and music education in international schools around the globe. Because of the Bassetts, AMIS “brings hands together through music” (ibid.).\n\nWells, Kori E. The Perception of Music Therapy by Direct Care Staff of Older Adults with Intellectual Disabilities: A Phenomenological Approach. MT-MME, AD 2018. (July 2017).\n\nThe purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of direct care staff of older adults with intellectual disabilities who participate in music therapy services. Participants (N =5) were direct care staff (DCS) over age 18, either currently working or formerly worked as DCS at Cottonwood Retirement, and observed a minimum of one music therapy session with their client(s). Participants shared their experiences in individual 60-minute semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Six themes emerged: (a) DCS find music therapy effective in changing social, physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning, (b) DCS find personal enjoyment through connecting with consumers in music therapy experiences, (c) DCS are experienced and knowledgeable about consumers and encourage student music therapists (SMTs) to ask for help, (d) DCS apply and reinforce experiences practiced in music therapy to consumer activities outside of sessions, (e) DCS encourage SMTs to focus on physical, emotional, and social functioning, instead of cognitive functioning, of older adults with ID, and (f) DCS encourage SMTs to consider consumers’ individual characteristics and preferences in order to increase therapist flexibility and intuition.\n\nWilson, Jacob B. The Reasons Cited by Latino Students for Their Discontinuation in Band after the First Year. ME-MME, JMD 2018. (June 2017).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the reasons cited by Latino students for their discontinuation in band after the first year of instruction. Participants were students (N = 10) enrolled one middle school in the Olathe Public School district in Olathe Kansas. Data was collected through two focus group session lead by the researcher. Focus groups were audio recorded in order to create transcripts for data coding. The study revealed four primary themes which students attribute to their decision to discontinue their participation in band after the first year; Personal Cost, Social Cost, Monetary Cost, and Denial of Choice. The first three themes, Personal, Social, and Monetary Cost are examined through the lens of Eccles’s Expectancy Value Theory Framework (1983). The fourth theme, Denial of Choice, is discussed as it relates to the idea of Autonomy versus Control in education.\n\n2018\n\nCoffman, Ashley K. THE EFFECTS OF CIRCULAR SINGER GESTURES ON ACOUSTIC AND PERCEPTUAL MEASURES OF MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL CHORAL SINGING. ME-MME, MG 2018 (May 2018)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the effect of three singer conditions (low circular arm gesture, high circular arm gesture, no arm movement) performed by nine middle and high school choirs while singing. Recordings were analyzed on acoustic (long-term average spectra [LTAS]) and perceptual (singer and expert listener preferences) measures. Among primary findings: (a) results of a repeated measures ANOVA of LTAS data indicated a significant interaction effect; (b) entire spectrum grand mean and range differences between gestures comparisons indicate twelve pairings of more than 1 dB difference (Just Noticeable Difference); (c) more than half of the singer participants noticed differences in overall choral sound while using the high circular arm gesture; (d) participants in high school choirs noticed differences in individual vocal sound (80%) and overall choral sound (78%) when singing with the low circular arm gesture; (e) singer preference responses indicate 5 choirs preferred the high circular arm gesture, 3 choirs preferred singing without arm movement, and 1 choir reported a preference for the low circular arm gesture; (f) 63% of singer participants reported liking the addition of gestures while singing, (g) expert listeners ranked tone quality while performing with no arm movement highest for 5 choirs and while performing the low circular gesture highest for 3 choirs; and (h) 4 choirs received the same ranking from the expert listeners: (1) no arm movement, (2) high circular gesture, and (3) low circular gesture. Results were discussed in terms of comparisons of acoustic and perceptual measures, limitations of the study, and suggestions for further research.\n\nHan, Ruozao A MENTAL MODEL OF MUSIC FAMILIARITY AND MUSIC PREFERENCE FOR MUSIC THERAPY PRACTICE. MT-MME, DHA 2018 (August 2018)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to review the researcher’s initial mental model of music familiarity and preference in music therapy and propose a revised mental model for the use of preferred and familiar music based on psychological and neurological constructs of music preference and familiarity. In order to collect exiting theories of related topics, the researcher identified several key words and then conducted searches in database and reference lists. Based on the psychological and neurological constructs of familiarity and preference, the researcher operationally defined familiar music and preferred music in music therapy, explained the relationship between familiar and preferred music, and presented a revised mental model. Suggestions for music therapy education and research were made based on these findings\n\nPolasik, Shelbi L. A Theoretical Framework to Foster Parent-Infant Attachment during NICU Hospitalization through Music Therapy. MT-MME, DHA 2018 (May 2018)\n\nA premature birth and subsequent admission into the NICU is a uniquely stressful event in a family’s life. This hospitalization has effects on the infant’s developmental trajectory, the parents’ ability to provide cares for their infant, and the formation of secure attachment between the parents and the infant. Due to attachment’s impact on future development of the infant, it is necessary to consider the impact of hospitalization on the ability of the family unit to develop a secure attachment. Research discussing attachment and developmental needs of infants and their families is emerging and, currently, no music therapy literature exists that focuses on music intervention involving developmentally sensitive care and promoting secure attachment between parents and infants in the NICU. The purpose of this study was to create an evidence-based theoretical framework for a music intervention that can promote attachment between parents and an infant in the NICU. A review of literature and combination of the formal theories including transtheoretical model of behavior change, synactive theory of development, hierarchy of needs, and pediatric psychosocial preventative health model inform a moderated causal model that identifies important components of the attachment process between parents and infants in the NICU. A theoretical framework to foster parent-infant attachment during NICU hospitalization through music therapy is illustrated. Implications for clinical practice and future research are also discussed.\n\nTeters, Caitlin E. An Investigation into Environmental Sound Levels and Vocal Behaviors of Female Secondary School Choir Teachers: A Collective Case Study. ME-MME, MG 2018 (May 2018)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate voice use and vocal behaviors of female middle and high school choral music teachers (N = 3) across three standard school days by measurement of duration of specific vocal activities, average classroom sound levels during specified activities, and self-perceived voice use and classroom sound level for the full day containing middle school choirs, beginning/intermediate high school choirs, and advanced high school choirs. Among primary findings: (a) female secondary choral teachers spent the majority of voice use in the classroom speaking alone, speaking while students are speaking, and singing while students sing with piano accompaniment; (b) female secondary choral teachers spoke more while students were speaking during advanced high school choir rehearsals than middle school or beginning/intermediate high school choirs; (c) female secondary choral teachers sang while students were singing and the piano was playing more often when teaching middle school choir than high school choirs; (d) the highest classroom sound level occurred when teachers were singing along with students singing with piano accompaniment; (e) the use of the piano in the secondary choral classroom was largely responsible for high sound levels; (f) female secondary choral teachers underestimated amount of time spent speaking alone; and (g) female secondary choral teachers overestimated total voice use during instructional time. Results are discussed in the context of previous research, implications for present and future music educators, and recommendations for future research.\n\nYoo, Jeehyun THERAPEUTIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE UPPER EXTREMITY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PARESIS AND APRAXIA AFTER STROKE. MT-PHD, CC 2018 (May 2018)\n\nTherapeutic Instrumental Music Performance (TIMP) has been shown to improve upper extremity (UE) functions in stroke survivors. While numerous studies have examined stroke induced paresis, research on stroke-related comorbid disorders remains limited, with relatively little consideration being given to the consequences of stroke. Ideomotor apraxia (IMA) is one such common post-stroke consequence that may hinder the purposeful UE action and movements necessary for the performance of daily living tasks. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of TIMP intervention to improve UE functions in post-stroke patients suffering concurrently from paresis and IMA. Seven left-hemisphere stroke patients with IMA participated in 9 individual 1-hour TIMP interventions over a period of 3 weeks. During each intervention, participants engaged in gross and fine motor exercises that primarily utilized drum and keyboard playing. All outcome measures were assessed at baseline, pretest, posttest and a follow-up test 3 weeks post-intervention. Clinical measures included the UE section of the Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Box and Block Test (BBT), strength, ADL/IADL, and hand domains of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The Apraxia Screen of TULIA (AST) was used to assess apraxic impairments. While therapeutic benefits varied, all UE functional levels of the participants demonstrated post-intervention improvements in gross and fine motor skills (FMA, WMFT, BBT) as well as perceived ADL skills (SIS). Moreover, such positive gains persisted for 3 weeks after the intervention. Participants continued to experience persistent IMA across the study timeline. The results of this study indicated that patients with post-stroke IMA were able to reap benefits from the TIMP intervention, as evidenced by improvement in their UE functions and perceived ADL skills despite the persistence of IMA. The findings of the study support the perception of TIMP intervention’s iv emerging efficacy in individuals suffering from post-stroke paresis and IMA, providing new information, implications and applications for both for researchers and clinicians. Rigorous future research is recommended to spur the development of efficacious and innovative rehabilitation interventions aimed at optimizing patient quality of care.\n\nHoard, Ronette. DECISION FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO MUSIC THERAPY STUDENTS SELECTING AN INTERNSHIP IN THE HOSPICE SETTING. MT-MME EQ, CC 2018 (DECEMBER 2018)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the general factors that contribute to the decision making process when choosing a music therapy internship and ascertain targeted factors that might impact an individual when considering a music therapy internship in a hospice setting. Participants who completed the survey (n=472) included student music therapists pre internship, student music therapists currently at internship or internship arranged, and professional music therapists and music therapy educators. Results indicated the general factors that participants considered when selecting an internship were: geographic location, setting, and population. Targeted factors that caused participants to make a selection for an internship in the hospice setting included: providing services to both the patient and their family, emotional context of working in a hospice setting, and working within a transdisciplinary team model. Through analysis of additional comments participants provided, some viewed hospice as a rewarding experience, while others commented on how they had experience working within the hospice setting and felt called to this setting. Targeted factors that caused participants to not want to consider an internship in the hospice included: working around individuals who are dying, emotional context of working in a hospice setting, and driving to multiple sites to provide therapy services. These participants were also provided an opportunity to make additional comments about their decision-making process and stated that they did not choose hospice because of the emotional strain, or perhaps had a desire to work in a specific setting other than hospice.\n\nTu, Wei-Hsuan. AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANAYLSIS OF MUSIC THERAPY CLINICAL SUPERVISION PROCESS. MT-MME, CC 2018. (DECEMBER 2018).\n\nThe aim of this Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) study was to explore the process of clinical supervision for music therapy practicum from the perspective of the supervisor. Supervised clinical training in music therapy is required of student music therapists as part of their academic and clinical training prior to being qualified to take the board-certification exam. While music therapy supervision has been studied from different vantage points, the literature appears limited regarding the perspective of the supervisor in that process. With IPA as the methodology of the current study, the author conducted semi-structured interviews to investigate six supervisors’ lived experiences and sense-making process of the process of clinical supervision. Twelve superordinate themes emerged as a result of data analysis, suggesting that supervisors’ past experiences were impactful for their own growth in making effective decisions regarding supervisory models/approaches, techniques and formats. Supervisees’ behavior, personality characteristics and clinical potential were factors that impacted the supervisor’s perception of the supervisory process and supervisory relationship established on personal perspectives.\n\n2019\n\nDame, Nathan. A MIXED METHODS INVENSTIGATION INTO SINGLE-SEX CHORAL ENSEMBLES AT THE MIDDLE-LEVEL. PHD-ME, DH 2019. (February 2019)\n\nThe purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine the frequency of single-sex choirs in middle school music programs, motivations for offering these ensembles, and both strategies for the implementation of and obstacles preventing single-sex choirs at the middle-level. The study merged simultaneously collected data from quantitative and qualitative sources to provide a greater depth of understanding of the research problem, thus aligning with Creswell and Plano Clark’s (2017) convergent mixed methods design. Quantitative data were collected through the Survey on Single-Sex choral Offerings (SSCO), a nationally-distributed survey disseminated to members of NAfMe, TMEA, and state ACDA chapters who also self-identified as middle school/junior high choral music educators. SSCO data were analyzed using descriptive statistical measures. Qualitative data were acquired through interviews of four middle-level choral directors who had recently separated their choirs into single-sex ensembles. Participants were demographically diverse, representing various geographical regions, school settings, type of school, campus socioeconomic status, and teaching experience. Data were transcribed, and coded into mutually exclusive categories, allowing themes to emerge.\n\nThe findings demonstrated that organizational designs varied among programs, with mixed-voice choirs the most common voicing used by responding choral directors. Director motivations for including either single-sex or mixed-voice choirs. Directors reported varying ease when facilitating change to include single-sex classes, used a variety of strategies and key players to do so, and experienced similar difficulties when presenting change initiatives.\n\nWhile many of the programs with mixed-voice choirs preferred such designs, responses indicated either an interest of previous attempt by some directors to separate classes into single-sex ensembles. Recommendations for future research, implications for music education, and a conceptual framework for separating choirs into single-sex choirs were discussed, based on the results and responses of participants.\n\nSmith, Amy. THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR A MUSIC INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE AUDITORY DEVELOPMENT IN VERY PRETERM INFANTS. PHD-MT, DHA 2019. (May 2019)\n\nVery preterm infants are at a high risk for language delays that can persist throughout their lifetime. The auditory system is rapidly developing and highly sensitive to acoustic stimulation during the third trimester of pregnancy. The acoustic nature of the womb provides the essential foundation for auditory perceptual skills necessary for language acquisition. In contrast, the NICU environment presents a wider spectrum of sounds that can alter the early development of the auditory system and cause delays in language acquisition. Research supports the importance of early exposure to speech sounds for optimal development of auditory perceptual ability and the critical role of the intrauterine characteristics of language. Pitches below 300 Hz, as well as rhythmic patterns and prosodic contours are highly salient intrauterine features of language that make up the infant’s initial auditory experience. The purpose of this study is to form a theoretical framework as a structure for understanding how intrauterine speech characteristics of pitch, rhythm, and prosody can be implemented as active ingredients in a music intervention to improve auditory development and long-term language outcomes in very premature infants. The framework is presented and described in detail. Implications for a future research agenda and applications for clinical practice are explored.\n\nStafford, Karen. MUSIC TEACHERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES OF INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCAION PROGRAMS. PHD-ME, DH 2019. (May 2019)\n\nThe purpose of the study was to report on music educators’ perceptions of their involvement in the implementation processes of Individualized Education Programs. This included information about and participation in the IEP meetings and subsequent reception of communication of IEP documentation for the purpose of making appropriate adaptations for students with special needs in the music classroom. The study was conducted using a survey containing 7 Likert-type queries, two demographic questions, and an open-ended response option. Data from the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with the open-ended responses examined through coding and categorization to divide responses into themes with accompanying patterns. Overall, results indicated participants received information about upcoming IEP meetings and attended them at varying degrees or used alternative means to provide information to be used to determine adaptations. However, most did not request to attend meetings, even though those who did reported a belief that they would be welcomed. Participants also received IEP documentation, although reports of updates and details in the paperwork varied. Even though most participants utilized IEP paperwork to make decisions on adaptations, some reported difficulties making the necessary changes. Results implied professional participants and special education personnel did communicate with each other about adaptations to varying degrees, generally with good working relationships. By highlighting the experiences of music teachers had with their students’ IEP processes, this study may possibly contribute to music educator practices regarding the full implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates and more focused research on how successful implementation might take place.

The Effects of a Music Therapy Voice Protocol on Selected Perceptual and Acoustic Parameters of the Speaking Voice and the Psychological States of Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease. PHD-MT, AAC, 2006 (May 2006).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a music therapy protocol for patients with Parkinson’s disease on (a) speech intelligibility; (b) voice quality; (c) vocal intensity range; (d) intonation; (e) positive affect; (f) negative affect; and (g) depressive state. Seventeen patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and three patients with Parkinson syndromes volunteered to participate in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the music therapy group (N= 10) or the control group (N = 10). The patients in the music therapy group received eight individual Music Therapy Voice Protocol (MTVP) sessions, focusing on vocal and singing exercises. Participants received assessments prior to the first session (test 1), after the fourth session (test 2), and following the eighth session (test 3) on each dependent variable. The remaining 10 participants received the same three tests as the music therapy group, but received no music therapy voice protocol sessions. The statistical calculation revealed that speech intelligibility, resonant voice quality, vocal intensity range, intonation, and positive affect significantly increased in the music therapy over time, but not in the control group. In contrast, no significant difference was identified in clear and smooth voice quality, negative affect, or depressive state in either group, which might indicate that more than eight sessions are required to achieve treatment effect. The study provided important information about potentials of music therapy speech rehabilitation on vocal parameters related to disease and psychological effect.\n\nKim, Ji Hyun. The Effect of a Music Enhanced Stretch Program on Fatigue of Individuals With Cancer: Four Case Studies. MME-MT, AAC, 2006 (August 2005).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a music enhanced stretch program on fatigue of individuals with cancer. Four participants served as their own controls. Two participants were instructed to engage in a 20-minute prescribed home-based stretch program five times per week across six weeks in an ABAC format: (A) No Treatment (1 week), (B) Stretch Program with Music (2 weeks), (A) No Treatment (1 week), and (C) Stretch Program with Music (2 weeks). The remaining two participants followed the same schedule as that of those in a ABAC format except for a change in order of the stretch program with and without music. Data for fatigue and adherence levels were collected daily by using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and a self-report stretch log. Results from graphic analysis indicated that fatigue levels tended to be slightly lower overall during a music enhanced stretch program than during no treatments. Still, it should be noted that the difference in fatigue levels for one of the four participants did not appear to change. Meanwhile, the stretch program without music did not achieve noticeably greater treatment effect over no treatment. In the comparisons of the stretch program with and without music, fatigue levels were lower during the stretch program with music for only one participant. For the other two participants, only very slightly lower fatigue was observed during the stretch program with music. The graphic analyses of adherence levels for participation in a stretch program did not indicate increased levels of participation for music enhancement. Even though the findings of this study did not lead to a definitive conclusion regarding the program’s effectiveness in treating fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, results associated with fatigue levels revealed the possible benefits of a music enhanced stretch program, and its clinical implications for fatigue treatment of cancer patients. The study also served to develop a non pharmacological, self administered protocol and to demonstrate its feasibility. Additional research in a larger subject sample is recommended.\n\nListon, Robin E. The Short-Term Effects of Milk Consumption on Selected Perceptual and Objective Measures of Vocal Fold Function and Appearance. PHD-ME, CMJ, 2006 (December 2005).\n\nSingers and other individuals who use their voices professionally are familiar with the common admonition to avoid dairy products because of their mucus-causing properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate empirically the short-term effects of milk consumption on perceptual and objective voice measures. Volunteer participants (N = 30) drank four common beverages, milk, cola, orange juice, and water. For pretest data, participants filled out a physical sensations response form rating the physical condition or “feel” of their mouths and throats. They then provided sustained /a/ vowel voice samples from which the acoustic measures of jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonies ratio were extracted. Finally, a speech-language pathologist performed a video strobe to record the amount of mucus present on the vocal folds. After drinking the first of the test drinks, participants repeated the pretest steps to provide posttest data and repeated the entire process for each subsequent beverage. Results indicated significant differences between pre- and posttest measure for the dependent variables of mucus rating and self-reported mouth/throat feel. Participants reported significantly more mucus after drinking milk, cola, and orange juice, milk by the largest margin. Participants reported significantly more mucus present on the vocal folds after each of the test drinks. No significant differences were indicated by the objective acoustic measures jitter, shimmer, and NHR. Participant belief in the “milk-mucus connection” appeared to be unrelated to the perceptual measures of participant mouth feel and amount of mucus on the folds.\n\nMcCready, Matthew T. Effect of Long Notes, Tied Notes, Dotted Notes, and Rests on High School Student Rhythm Performance. MME-ME, CMJ, 2006 (December 2005).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of long notes, tied notes, dotted notes, and rests on high school student rhythm performance. Thirty-six high school band students from three varying socio-economically areas served as subjects for this study. Each subject sight read six monotonic rhythm examples of four measures each. These examples were crafted using the Claude T. Smith Symphonic Warm Ups for Band rhythm studies as a model. The six examples contained certain similar rhythm patterns and figures to check for correlation. In order to determine error causation, rhythm variables were separated into their own measures. Consequently, each six-measure example contained one measure of each variable (long note, tied notes, dotted notes, rests). Utilizing the Autoscore pitch to MIDI software program, all rhythm performances were recorded and then notated. Via the printed rhythm results, trends of rhythm errors were evaluated. Results showed overwhelming rhythm performance errors. Of 864 possible measures, only 8 were performed correctly. Due to such a majority of errors made, no conclusion was able to be reached, other than long notes, tied notes, dotted notes, and rests might all have likely caused an inordinately large amount of errors during the study.\n\nSlattery, Valerie A. A Survey of Current Piano Use in the Elementary General Music Classroom. MME-ME, DGH, 2006 (May 2006).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to identify teacher opinion about piano use in the elementary general music classroom, and the amount of use and purposes for pianos in elementary general music classrooms according to teacher self-reporting. Out of the sample selected, 189 general music teachers completed the piano use questionnaire. The data indicated that teachers thought piano (a) was an important part of elementary music, (b) should be used for accompaniment more than any other purpose, and (c) was most commonly used on a weekly basis. Several moderate correlations were found indicating: piano use tends to increase the more years of teaching experience a teacher has accumulated, the more years of piano lessons a teacher has taken, the more a teacher uses other instruments in the classroom, and the younger a teacher was when beginning piano lessons; and piano use decreases the more a teacher uses a cappella singing in the classroom. Qualitative statements made about piano use were overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. However, specific comments made concerning using the piano for pitch learning and over-use of the piano were generally negative. This study serves as a baseline study of piano use in elementary general music and provides direction for future research in the investigation of relationships between piano use and specific teaching factors.\n\nTobita, Shiho. Comparison of Musical Tension Between Contemporary Background Piano Music and Common Practice Piano Music. MME-MT, CMC, 2006 (August 2005).\n\nThe purposes of this study were: 1) to compare the degree of musical tension among the different genres of music (background music and common practice music) from the aspects of both perception and theoretical prediction, and 2) to test the validity of the theoretical prediction of musical tension. The methodological procedures were two-fold, 1) analytical procedures and 2) experimental procedures. For the analytical procedures, ten music pieces were chosen from background and common practice music respectively, to compare the difference in calculated musical tension, applying the Tonal Pitch Space (TPS) theory. The results showed a significant difference in harmonic tension between background and common practice music, but not in harmonic attraction (p = .06). For the experimental procedures, undergraduate and graduate students (N = 40) from the University of Kansas participated as volunteers. They were randomly divided into four groups and listened to four music excerpts (two excerpts from background music and two from common practice music (chosen from the twenty pieces in the analytical procedures. During the experiment, participants measured the ongoing musical tension using the Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI), a continuum measurement device, while they listened to the four music excerpts. The obtained data were computed and compared to examine the difference in perceived musical tension between background music and common practice music. The results showed a significant difference in perceived musical tension between background and common practice music. However, the results also showed a significant difference between the two common practice music excerpts. In addition to the analytical and experimental procedures, the correlation between calculated and perceived musical tension was computed. The results were inconsistent with the results from previous studies. In general, the current study found the difference of the degree of musical tension between background music and common practice music in both theoretical prediction and subjects’ perception. The applicability of the TPS theory to music genres other than common practice music was also indicated.\n\n2007\n\nFox, Cassandra. Perceived Effectiveness of Music Therapy Clinical Techniques to Increase Vocal Response and Improve Verbal Intelligibility in Persons with Aphasia. MME-MT, AAC, 2007 (December 2006).\n\nThis study examined music therapists’ perceptions of the effectiveness of singing rhythmic speaking/ chanting and accompaniment techniques as interventions to increase vocal response and improve verbal intelligibility in persons with aphasia. Data were gathered through a survey sent to music therapy practitioners who were listed in the American Music Therapy Association national directory as professionals who have worked with speech impaired, stroke and elderly populations. Information from the survey was analyzed for outcomes that specifically described current music therapy practice for increased vocal response and improved verbal intelligibility in persons with aphasia. Outcomes confirmed certain clinical techniques that were found in the literature as effective, and indicated additional techniques that music therapy practitioners use or have used with this population. Limitations and implications of the study were discussed and recommendations for further study were indicated.\n\nGilglio, Leigh Lauren. The Effect of a Music Therapy Intergenerational Program on Cued and Spontaneous Behaviors of Older Adults with Dementia. MME-MT, CMC, 2007 (August 2006).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether older adults with dementia would exhibit a change in cued behaviors (on-task, verbal prompting, visual prompting, physical guidance) and spontaneous behaviors (i.e. smiling, extending hands, hugging, laughing, etc.) when children were present during a music therapy program. Twenty-two older adults diagnosed with dementia and 17 preschool children from a nursing home/daycare center in Missouri served as participants in this study. Older adults were ranked in order of their Mini Mental State Exam test scores and by gender. To ensure that groups were equal in cognition levels and gender, older adult participants were then matched based on this rank and then randomly placed in one of three groups, Intergenerational music Therapy Group (Group I), Music Therapy Only Group (Group M), and the Control Group (Group C). Children in the preschool class were only assigned to Group I. Each group met one time per week, for 30-minute sessions across an 8-week period. All sessions were videotaped for later analysis and coding of cued and spontaneous behaviors. A brief post-study questionnaire was given on the last day of the study to the memory care unit staff members and child daycare staff that assisted in the study to document any changes seen in the older adults, as well as provide an opportunity to give feedback on the study. Graphic analysis of weekly percentage means and percentage means across the 8-week period revealed that older adults in intergenerational music therapy programs did not have a lower mean percentage of observed cued behaviors when interacting with children in an intergenerational program. Older adults would generally maintain their “normal "
