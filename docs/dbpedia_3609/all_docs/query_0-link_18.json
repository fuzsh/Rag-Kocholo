Youth empowerment\n\nOral presentation\n\nWell-being among indigenous children and youth in the Arctic – with a focus on Sami and Greenland Inuit\n\nLarsen, CVL. Ingemann, C.\n\nNational Institute of Public Health, University of Soutern Denmark, Copenhagen K., Denmark, kd.hpin@llc\n\nIntroduction: Children and youth in the Arctic regions of the Nordic countries represent Indigenous Peoples and are in some aspects a vulnerable group. The aim of this study was to scope the literature to identify knowledge gaps, action taken and needed, as well as directions for future research and interventions in regards to indicators for the well-being of indigenous children and youth in the Arctic region of the Nordic countries and Greenland.\n\nMethods: Literature (both scientific and grey) on the well-being among children and youth in the Arctic region was reviewed. The search was limited to the timeframe 2009–2017. A search syntax inspired by Augustsson and Hagquist was applied in the databases PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO.\n\nResults: From 247 scientific articles focusing on well-being of children and youth, 27 were found relevant to the Arctic context. Additionally, 31 documents and 46 homepages categorised as grey, non-peer reviewed literature were reviewed of which 28 sources were selected.\n\nDiscussion: The findings of the scoping review indicate that the focus on indigenous children’s and youth’s well-being in the Nordic countries is limited. This study reveals how the efforts for promoting children’s and youth’s well-being and mental health in the Arctic need to be developed in close collaboration with the local population in the Arctic region, children as well as adults. The evidence for actions and initiatives with a focus on involving cultural identity, skills in the nature and local connection are increasing in the north American literature, but hardly existing in literature on Sápmi and Greenland.\n\nOral presentation\n\nHonouring Indigenous Stories to Protect our Youth – Family, community, and self healing through storytelling\n\nLewis, JP.\n\nWWAMI School of Medical Education, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, USA, ude.aksala@siwelpj\n\nAlaska Native Elders have experienced hardships, from boarding schools to periods of drug and alcohol dependence and as they grew older their responsibilities and expectations shifted to a concern for others (i.e. children, grandchildren, community). Indigenous Elders have a strong belief that reconnecting with their cultural practices and values can assist them in reclaiming their values, beliefs, and skills.\n\nA qualitative, research design was utilised to gather data on experiences of successful ageing in three different studies conducted across the State of Alaska. 71 interviews with Alaska Native Elders in rural and urban communities were completed. Using Nvivo qualitative software, thematic analysis was used to obtain cultural perspectives on successful ageing. These studies were approved by the University and numerous tribal review boards. Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse, and report patterns in the data.\n\nSuccessful ageing is never achieved, nor is it a checklist, but rather lessons and stories acquired over a timeline of experiences, including hardships, that are passed on to younger people. Being generative enabled them to fill the role of a respected Elder, gave them a sense of purpose, and opportunities to health their family and community, as well as heal themselves through sharing their stories, termed “indigenous cultural generativity.”\n\nDeveloping a successful ageing model for Alaska Natives, and focusing on generativity and intergenerational activities, serves as the foundation for future work exploring this developmental stage as a cultural protective factor and improving the health and wellbeing of AN Elders experiencing various stressors (alcohol use disorders, depression, diabetes, dementia, and so on). The results suggest being engaged in meaningful cultural activities with family and community are important for AN Elders and their understanding of how they age successfully.\n\nOral presentation\n\nTe(a)ch: Teaching coding for youth empowerment and wellness in Nunavut\n\nTabish, T. Oliver, R.\n\nResearch, Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre, Iqaluit, Canada, ac.crhq@hsibat.ahat\n\nIntroduction: Technology is ubiquitous in Northern Canada, and Nunavut is no exception. Nunavummiut (people from Nunavut) use their devices daily. However, computer science instruction is minimal in schools, so youth are not learning the skills to use these devices to create their own solutions. The te(a)ch program aims to address this in a culturally-relevant way, while focusing on building youth empowerment and wellness.\n\nMethods: This program teaches youth the concepts and application of computer science through the creation of video games, and its method is embedded in Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (traditional knowledge). The program is a week long, involving older youth who are provided the skills to teach video game design to younger youth participants and peers in a mini “club” program that follows. The design of the program and the skills taught act to build agency, resilience, and empowerment, providing youth with a creative outlet to tell their stories, use their language, and build on their overall wellness. Direct observation and participant feedback is used to evaluate the program delivery.\n\nResults/Conclusions: A key focus of the program has been to shift the relationship between youth and technology from one based solely on consumption, to one that includes creation and innovation. Since 2014, over 100 youth participants and over 20 youth trainers have participated in the program across Nunavut. The response to the program has been overwhelmingly positive. Next steps are focused on how to make it more sustainable while scaling the program.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nMakimautiksat Youth Wellness and Empowerment Camp: A Model for Promoting Community Well-being, Culture, and Resilience\n\nSallaffie, MC.\n\nYouth Mental Health and Wellness, Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre, Iqaluit, Canada, ac.crhq@eiffallas.hairom\n\nIntroduction: The Makimautiksat Youth Wellness and Empowerment Camp is a program developed by Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre (QHRC) out of a consultation process with community members and in Nunavut. It is a 10-day camp focusing on fostering wellness, positive Inuit identity, community building and skill building. Makimautiksat was developed following these core components:\n\nMethods: Through community consultation, literature reviews, and input from Nunavut youth service providers, the Eight Ujarait/Rocks Model for the camp was developed. The model was developed to provide a foundation for the curriculum and to bring Inuit and Western knowledge together to address mental health and wellness for youth. The Eight Ujarait represent the foundation needed to hold in place the qammaq/traditional skin tent.\n\nResults: Makimautiksat is a practical model for promoting mental health and wellness among youth. By using evidence-based camp programs with culturally relevant curriculum built on Inuit values and knowledge, QHRC has developed a unique program and practice of delivering education that has proven to contribute to overall Nunavut youth mental health and wellness. Makimautiksat serves as a model for ways that indigenous communities worldwide can deliver culturally relevant curriculum developed by and for their community.\n\nConclusions: On behalf of QHRC I propose to present on how Makimautiksat was developed, evaluated, how it promotes well-being, culture and resilience in Nunavut, and how the model for developing, piloting and evaluating this program can be used in other communities to deliver culturally relevant education.\n\nOral presentation\n\nMental health services in the Northwest Territories: A scoping review\n\nElman, A. Etter, M. Fairman, K. Chatwood, S.\n\nResearch, Institute for Circumpolar Health Research, Toronto, Canada\n\nIntroduction: The colonial history of the Indigenous Peoples in Canada has negatively impacted mental health and wellness in the Northwest Territories (NWT). Mental health services can be challenging to provide because of remote populations and limited resources addressing these unique mental health needs. It is important that communities have access to services in a culturally relevant way in achieving mental and community wellness. The objective of this research is to identify mental health services on national, territorial, regional and community levels. These services will then be organised using the First Nations’ Mental Wellness Continuum Model (FNMWCM) to further understand the landscape of these services.\n\nMethods: A scoping review of grey literature was conducted to collect data on mental health and wellness services in the NWT.\n\nResults: Data was collected and extracted; 68 mental health services were included in this review, from 41 different sources. Results were summarised and described by jurisdiction, where it was offered and location on the Continuum of Essential Services from the FNMWCM.\n\nDiscussion: This approach is useful for mapping mental health services for communities in the NWT. It highlights existing mental health services and gaps. Common themes and strengths emerged through the mapping of the mental health services, such: culture, social determinants of health, collaboration with partners and northern, rural and remote considerations. This data can identify gaps in services based on the FNMWCM, and guide communities and health authorities in planning, implementing and coordinating a full range of optimised mental health services in the NWT.\n\nMonday 13.08. 13:30–15:00.\n\n2. Psychiatry and mental health overview\n\nOral presentation\n\nCultural construction of Dementia among Alaska Natives and providers and implications for arctic communities\n\nLewis, J.\n\nCollege of Health, WWAMI School of Medical Education, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, USA, ude.aksala@siwelpj\n\nIntroduction: The proportion of the Indigenous population aged 65+ is projected to increase between 2015 and 2045, from 7–12%, and health care providers across the Arctic are ill-prepared to meet the demand of Alzheimer’s Disease and related disorders (ADRD). There is an increasing urgency to better understand Indigenous views of ADRD to establish health care services and supports.\n\nMethods: Guided by Kleinman’s explanatory model of illness, a qualitative, research design was utilised to gather data on experiences with ADRD. 21 interviews with Alaska Native caregivers and 12 interviews with health care providers in rural and urban communities were completed. Using Nvivo qualitative software, thematic analysis was used to obtain cultural perspectives on ADRD. This study was approved by the University and regional and local tribal review boards.\n\nResults: Many Alaska Natives view ADRD as a natural part of the ageing process, resulting in not always seeking medical care. Caregivers challenges included family denial, exhaustion and isolation, and family distancing themselves due to fear and limited understanding of ADRD. Caregiving benefits included spending time with older adult, learning family history, and sharing experiences with other caregivers. Healthcare provider challenges included rigidity of the healthcare system, no research on Alaska Natives, limited health literacy, limited community resources, and no knowledge of Alaska Native views of ADRD.\n\nConclusions: Understanding the cultural underpinnings of ADRD provides insight into how health care providers can integrate cultural beliefs into treatment to improve the processes of care that may mitigate the impact of ADRD on individuals and families in communities across the Arctic. Culturally-responsive education and training about ADRD is crucial to connecting Indigenous families and individuals with ADRD to care and culturally responsive educational materials that can assist them in ageing more comfortably and provide supports in remote communities with limited supports and services.\n\nOral presentation\n\nIndigenising Mental Health Laws in Canada ’s North\n\nDrossos, A.\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, ac.retsamcm@sossord\n\nINTRODUCTION: For many years, scholars have called for the inclusion of Indigenous legal traditions into Canada’s laws. Many of Canada’s current laws negatively affect the health and mental health of Indigenous peoples, including Mental Health Laws (MHLs), which are rooted in colonial law. None of Canada’s MHLs incorporate Indigenous legal traditions, even in the circumpolar north where Indigenous peoples predominate the population. Furthermore, they are not designed to account for the remote nature of geography, and often scarce availability of resources.\n\nMETHODS: Applying an Indigenous lens to MHLs, and using resources published by the World Health Organization (WHO) for developing human rights oriented mental health laws, an analysis was conducted on how MHLs can be modified to include Indigenous legal traditions. This analysis is also rooted in principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\n\nRESULTS: This analysis of MHLs, with a focus on Canada’s three northern territories, identifies their strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, opportunities for improvement are highlighted. For example, disclosing suicide attempts to family members (despite potentially breaching confidentiality) may ultimately save lives, and many consider it in keeping with Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Incorporating Indigenous legal traditions into mental health laws (MHLs) can improve the mental health of all Canadians, including Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, it echos many of the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada final report, as a path to inclusiveness, access to justice and ultimately reconciliation.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nDiscrimination, Mental Health and Resilience Among Indigenous Sami and Non-Sami Populations in Norway: The SAMINOR2 Study.\n\nHansen, KL.\n\nThe Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT Thef Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway, on.tiu@nesnah.trenel.litek\n\nBackground: New research shows that many Sami people experiencing various forms of discrimination. The aim of this present study is to give updated information on the challenges of discrimination, mental health status and Sami people face in Norway.\n\nMethods: The figures are based on qualitative data collected in 2012 from 11,600 individuals (both Sami and majority Norwegians), from 25 municipalities in the five northernmost counties in Norway. The study is part of a health and living conditions investigation in areas with Sami and Norwegian communities, called the SAMINOR 2 questionnaire survey.\n\nResults: In the sample, approximately one in five experienced discrimination. About a third of those who had been discriminated against, say that the incident happened in the last two years. Sami people experience discrimination much more frequently than majority Norwegian. Discrimination is generally negative for mental health and well-being; however, few studies have examined protective effects of resilience factors, especially among minority indigenous people.\n\nConclusion: The findings from this study show that the Sami people still experience high levels of discrimination in Norwegian society. Our findings suggest that interventions specifically designed to prevent discrimination against the indigenous Sami people of Norway should be implemented.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nRestoring Indigenous miyo-mahcihoyān (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellness)\n\nGraham, HA. Ramsden, V. Butt, P.\n\nCollege of Nursing, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, ac.ksasu@maharg.ylloh\n\nIntroduction: Dr. Graham (PI) a member of the Thunderchild First Nation and her two co-investigators facilitated a research project to: develop, implement, and evaluate the relationship between the collaborative development of a community-based plan and the empowerment of the Plains Cree people (néhiyawak) from Thunderchild First Nation, SK. This research project built on the previous work done by the primary investigator with the Thunderhcild First Nation with the addition of the voices of the Elders and youth prior to developing the community-based plan.\n\nMethods: The medicine wheel, an Indigenous holistic approach to wellness, provided the conceptual framework. Action research and participatory processes guided the research process and relationship with the community. Interviews were conducted with youth and Elders, guided by narrative inquiry. Data analysis was conducted according to the principles of thematic narrative analysis. Defining and measuring success of the community-based plan was a collaborative endeavour with the community using Arnstein’s Ladder as the frame; Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment (CREA); as well as Rissel’s Model of Community Empowerment which links personal and community empowerment with collective action.\n\nResults: The plan reinforced healthy relationships, supported their spiritual beliefs and cultural practices, and expanded their tānisīsi wāpahtaman pimātisiwin (worldview) by a variety of events planned and coordinated in the community.\n\nConclusions: The researchers have added to evidence-informed strategies and processes that facilitate empowerment in and with First Nations. This project highlights community and research success by adhering to participatory processes and the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS-2nd Edition) Chapter 9 that outlines research process when involving Aboriginal peoples in Canada.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nRelationship between health behaviours and marital adjustment and marital intimacy in multicultural family female immigrants\n\nLee, J. Kim, J. Kim, S. Jeong, J. Yoon, S. Kim, S. Lee, S.\n\nDepartment of Healthcare centre, The Catholic university of Korea Daejeon St.Mary’s hospital, Daejeon, South Korea, moc.revan@00gnilapgnay\n\nBackground: This study analysed the relationship between health behaviours and marital adjustment in multicultural couples to evaluate their health status.\n\nMethods: Married couples (70 Korean husbands and their immigrant wives) completed a structured interview on health behaviours and sociodemographic factors, the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS), and the Marital Intimacy Scale (MIS). Based on the cut-off value of the RDAS, respondents were classified into two groups: high/low dyadic adaptation groups. The collected data were compared with health behaviour regarding smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and weight.\n\nResults: The odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) by logistic regression with adjustment for age, education, career, occupation, length of residence in Korea, nationality, religion, age difference between couple, number of children, monthly income, and proficiency in Korean was 1.279 (1.113–1.492) for unhealthy exercise and 1.732 (1.604–1.887) for unhealthy body weight in female immigrants with low marital adjustment. In Korean husbands with low marital adjustment, the OR (95% CI) was 1.625 (1.232–2.142) for smoking and 1.327 (1.174–1.585) for unhealthy exercise. No significant relationship was found between marital intimacy and health behaviours in female immigrants or Korean husbands.\n\nConclusion: More desirable health behaviours were observed in highly adapted couples. Therefore, family physicians should be concerned with marital adjustment and other associative factors to evaluate and improve multicultural couples’ health status.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nNenets and the Arctic: Forms of Adaptive Behaviour\n\nLobova, VA. Mironov, AV.\n\nInstitute of Humanities, Yugra State University, Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, ur.xednay@avobol-av\n\nIntroduction. The research took place in the territory of the Arctic region in the settlement Nyda. Surveyed representatives of the indigenous people of the North belong to the Samoyed (Nenets) group. The group included 41 people.\n\nMethods. Life Style Index (LSI).\n\nResults. The study of deep mechanisms of personality showed that such type of psychological defence as a projection is the most expressed in the Nenets, which is closely associated with their mythological perception of the world, characterised by installing the personification of animals, trees, and a tendency to attribute own motivations, feelings and desires to the phenomena of nature. The second active mechanism of psychological defence of the Nenets is negation, which has traditionally been one of the main mechanisms of fear and indicates the ignoring of the emerging danger. Another type of defence used by the Nenets is overcompensation, which explains a strong feelings in violation of personal space. It also demonstrates the importance of such aspects of life as order, commitment to comply with cultural norms and traditions in the consciousness of Nenets. Among the forms of the Nenets adaptive behaviour there have been highlighted independence, evident readiness to external confrontation, contemplation. Women has actualised communicative need, men – expression of freedom, self-reliance and originality.\n\nConclusions. The Nenets adaptive behaviour is characterised by evident tension of psychological defence mechanisms and importance of such aspects of life as the commitment to the preservation of traditions and customary principles of life in the consciousness of the Nenets.\n\nTuesday 14.08. 11:00–12:30.\n\n3. Mental wellness and social determinants\n\nOral presentation\n\nMoving to a new house in the Arctic: Significant improvements in housing conditions and in psychosocial and physical health outcomes\n\nRiva, M. Perreault, K. Fletcher, C. Dufresne, P.\n\nDepartment of Geography and Institute for Health and Social Policy, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, ac.lligcm@avir.enelym\n\nIntroduction: In 2014–2015, over 400 social housing units were constructed in Nunavik and Nunavut. This presentation describes changes in housing conditions and psychosocial and physical health outcomes of participants before and after moving to a new house.\n\nMethods: The study was developed according to an integrated knowledge translation approach, in partnership with several Inuit organisations. Households ranked at the top of the waitlist for social housing were recruited by local housing officers, in 12 communities in Nunavik and Nunavut. Of the 179 Inuit adults who moved to a new house, 102 completed the study. Questionnaires were administered 1–6 months before moving, and 15–18 months after, to measure pre-post housing conditions and health outcomes.\n\nResults: Participants (57% women, mean age 31) had been on the waitlist for 42 months on average at baseline. After moving, the proportion of participants living in overcrowded dwellings and in dwellings needing major repairs significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Sense of home, including factors such as perception of space, control, privacy, identity with the house, relationships, significantly improved (p < 0.001). Improvements were observed in asthma symptoms (p = 0.004), mental health (p < 0.001) stress in daily life (p = 0.025), and sense of mastery (p = 0.002), while food security and self-rated general health did not change. Finally, housing wealth decreased after moving (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Results suggest that more housing can contribute to improving health and well-being in Nunavik and Nunavut. Integration of housing, social and health policies are potential avenues to maximise benefits of new housing construction and to avoid or mitigate unintended effects.\n\nOral presentation\n\nMoving to a new house in Nunavik and Nunavut: assessing the associations between changes in housing conditions and improvement in mental health\n\nPerreault, K. Riva, M. Fletcher, C. Dufresne, P.\n\nDepartment of Social and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, University of Montreal, Montréal, Canada, ac.laertnomu@tluaerrep.k\n\nIntroduction: In 2014–2015, investments in social housing permitted the construction of more than 400 new social housing units in Nunavut and Nunavik. The objective of this study is to identify changes in housing conditions with the potential to improve mental health among Inuit adults.\n\nMethods: In collaboration with Inuit organisations, a pre-post study was conducted, without control group, to which 102 Inuit adults participated. People ranked at the top of the waitlist for social housing were recruited by local housing officers. Indicators were measured 1–6 months before moving, and 15–18 after: crowding (number of people per room), housing quality (number of problems with the house), sense of home (score), and psychological distress (Kessler 6-item score). Associations between changes in all indicators, adjusting for individuals’ covariates, were estimated using multilevel linear regression models.\n\nResults: Decrease in crowding was not directly linked to improvement in psychological distress, but was significantly associated with increase in sense of home (p = 0.015), which in turn was associated with decrease in psychological distress (p = 0.009). Improvements in housing quality was significantly associated with both increase in sense of home (p = 0.015), and decrease in psychological distress (p = 0.003).\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest that improvements in crowding and housing quality have the potential to improve mental health among Inuit adults living in Nunavut and Nunavik, although for crowding the effect seems to transit through increases in “sense of home”. Partner organisations intent to use these results to inform housing and public health strategies.\n\nOral presentation\n\nThe effect of housing characteristics on health outcomes among Inuit in Greenland\n\nHansen, CB. Larsen, CVL. Riva, M.\n\nCentre for Public Health in Greenland, National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark., København K, Denmark, kd.dehdnuseklof-is@ahbc\n\nIntroduction: Housing conditions experienced by Indigenous peoples can impact health over the life course. This study examines the long-term effects of household overcrowding and composition on self-rated health and mental health among Inuit in Greenland.\n\nMethods: A cohort of 1283 adults was constructed, based on two population-based cross sectional surveys among the Inuit in Greenland, the Inuit Health in Transition survey 2005–2010 (IHIT) and the Health survey in Greenland 2014 (B2014). Cohort participants took part in both surveys, lived in Greenland at the time of the surveys, and were born in either Greenland or Denmark. The IHIT survey was used for baseline measures and the B2014 survey for follow-up measures. Health outcomes included self-rated health (SRH), and a measure of mental health (12-item General Health Questionnaire). Associations between household characteristics at baseline and health outcomes at follow-up were examined using logistic regression models, adjusting for individuals’ characteristics.\n\nResults: Participants who lived in an overcrowded house at baseline had significantly higher odds (42%) of experiencing poor SRH at follow-up compared to those who were not living in an overcrowded house at baseline. Additionally participants who lived alone at baseline had significantly higher odds (77%) of experiencing poor mental health at follow-up compared to those who lived with children at baseline.\n\nConclusion: This study demonstrates that household overcrowding and household composition influence health on a long-term basis among Inuit in Greenland. Results confirm the importance of improving housing conditions in Greenland, which might contribute to improving the overall health.\n\nOral presentation\n\nMine, yours or ours? Income inequality and mental health in Northern Sweden\n\nSan Sebastian, M. Mosquera, P. Gustafsson, PE.\n\nPublic Health and Clinical Medicine, Epidemiology and Global Health, Umeå, Sweden, es.umu@naitsabesnas.leugim\n\nBackground: The relationship between income and population health has received considerable attention in the last decades. Three main explanations of the relationship have been identified: the absolute, the contextual, and the relative income effects hypotheses. The evidence about their relevance, particularly in egalitarian societies like the Scandinavian one, is however inconsistent. The present study aimed to test the three hypotheses in relation to psychological distress in northern Sweden.\n\nMethods: Data come from the 2014 cross-sectional survey “Health on equal terms”, from the four northern-most counties in Sweden, and included people 25–84 years (n = 21,004). Psychological distress was measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 and information on income came from population registers. Absolute income was operationalised by individual disposable income, contextual income as the municipal-level Gini coefficient and relative income by the Yitzaki index.\n\nResults: First, a strong individual income gradient in mental ill health was observed, with the very poor more likely to report poor health (PR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.19, 2.04) compared to the highest income quintile. Second, municipalities in the quintiles 2–4 of the Gini coefficient had a better mental health than those municipalities in the extremes of the distribution. Third, a clear statistically significant association of relative deprivation and ill mental health was also found (PR = 1.37 95% CI = 1.06, 1.76).\n\nConclusion: This study suggests a strong, moderate and lack of support for the absolute, relative and contextual income effect hypotheses, respectively. Interventions targeting a reduction in the individual income gap are probably necessary in order to reduce psychosocial distress differences in this population of northern Sweden.\n\nOral presentation\n\nUsing Traditional Arctic Games to Promote Sustainability & Peace in the North\n\nKilbourne, J.\n\nMovement Science, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan, USA, ude.usvg@jruoblik\n\nWith climate change expanding trade routes in the Arctic and the resultant pursuit of oil, gas, mineral deposits, and fish, it is imperative that the eight Arctic countries find paths towards sustainability and peace in the region. Revisiting and understanding the traditional games of the indigenous people of these regions can go a long way towards helping those determining the region’s future to work cooperatively towards these goals. By reconnecting with and understanding the games of our past, we can build meaningful bridges between our past and present, and hopefully gain a better understanding of our modern world. The aforesaid are timely and important, especially as they relate to indigenous people throughout the world who are trying to preserve their traditions in a fast changing modern world. This presentation/paper will offer, based on my research and experiences in the Arctic, lessons learned from traditional Sámi and Inuit games that may help promote sustainability and peace in the Arctic world. Hopefully by acknowledging these lessons we can pursue a path forward, together reconnecting with the traditional games of the Arctic with the hope of building meaningful bridges between the past and present and moreover, helping to enhance our understanding of the important role traditional games can play in shaping an Arctic where sustainability and peace flourish.\n\nTuesday 14.08. 13:30–15:00.\n\n4. Suicide\n\nOral presentation\n\nAn integrated knowledge explanation of factors leading to elevated rates of child and youth suicide behaviour in some Indigenous communities – and implications for suicide prevention strategies\n\nHicks, J.\n\nDep’t of Community Health and Epidemiology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, ac.ksasu@skcih.kcaj\n\nIntroduction: This paper will review the “integrated knowledge explanation” (after Goldney 2003) which has informed the Nunavut Suicide Prevention Strategy, the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy and the Saskatchewan First Nations Suicide Prevention Strategy.\n\nMethods: Review of the literature which informed the design of these three suicide prevention strategies, and analysis of how key risk and protective factors were addressed in the strategies.\n\nResults: Priority must be placed on addressing the ways in which colonialism is mediated into elevated rates of child and youth suicide behaviour (by addressing the intergenerational transmission of unresolved historical trauma, reducing rates of early childhood adversity, and improving living conditions) in many Indigenous communities, in addition to strengthening the continuum of culturally-appropriate, trauma-informed addictions treatment and mental health care services.\n\nAs Crawford and Hicks 2018 noted, “The growing attention being paid to the link between early childhood adversity and later suicide is urgent and overdue. Suicide prevention approaches that focus all of their efforts on adolescence and adulthood may be too late in development to ameliorate risk and build resilience”.\n\nConclusions: Three recent suicide prevention strategies developed by Indigenous organisations in Canada have somewhat different areas of focus than do suicide prevention strategies for the general, non-Indigenous population. The three strategies seek to address upstream risk factors by promoting optimal early childhood development and reducing socioeconomic and early life disadvantage. This approach has the strong support of Indigenous leaders at the national, regional and community level.\n\nOral presentation\n\nUsing Research to Inform Community Prevention Practice: Sharing Participatory Approach and Results from Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES) in Alaska\n\nWexler, L. Johnson, RM. Moto, R. McEachern, D. Dombrowski, K.\n\nHealth Promotion and Policy, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, USA, ude.ssamu.hploohcs@relxewl\n\nIntroduction Youth suicide is a pressing health issue that disproportionately affects rural arctic Indigenous communities. This health disparity is fairly recent, and linked to forced social, economic and political change, and intergenerational trauma. It is imperative that suicide prevention includes – at its heart – decolonisation, while also using “best practices” from research. Methods PC CARES is a community-based, self-determined approach to Indigenous suicide. The model shares research with community stakeholders, and guides them through learning circles (LCs) that invite interpretation and application of knowledge to local contexts. The goal is to create a community of practice that enables Alaska Native communities to create local multilevel evidence-based efforts. Trained local facilitators conducted a series of nine monthly LCs in Northwest Alaska; 376 unique participants attended at least one LC, which were audio recorded. Surveys compared participant responses about knowledge, attitudes and behaviours at baseline and three months post-intervention. We compared participant responses with community members who had not attended LCs. We conducted a social network analysis to detect potential social diffusion of the prevention behaviours of participants, those “close to” them, and others. Results. Participants showed statistically significant positive change in attitudes, perceived knowledge, perceived skills from their pre- and follow-up surveys, and participants implemented significantly more suicide prevention behaviours compared to non-participants. Persons close to participants were more likely to have taken preventative action than others. Conclusion. PC CARES shows both community acceptance and positive impact on participants and people close to them. The model offers a practical, scalable method for translating research evidence into community-driven, culturally responsive prevention practice.\n\nOral presentation\n\nCommunity Intervention to Prevent Repeated Suicide Attempts\n\nMishara, B. Crawford, A. Hicks, JR.\n\nCommunity Health & Epidemiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, ac.ksasu@skcih.kcaj\n\nMany studies in different cultures have found that simple, non-professional follow-up after a suicide attempt can prevent repeated attempts. The SUPRE-MISS program, tested by the World Health Organization (WHO) in eight general hospitals in five low- and middle-income countries, involved regular follow-up contacts over 18 months, and found that the participants were less likely to die by suicide than control groups that did not receive the follow-up.\n\nThis presentation presents a project in Nunavut focusing on people who have been seen in a medical facility for a suicide attempt. In Nunavut, like elsewhere, people who attempt suicide are at greater risk of repeated attempts, and of dying by suicide. Principal Investigator Brian Mishara (Université du Québec à Montréal) and Co-Investigators Allison Crawford (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) and Jack Hicks (University of Saskatchewan) will see if a similar program can be adapted and successfully implemented in Nunavut, and if it has the same beneficial effects. The project has been funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).\n\nAs part of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) initiative, a parallel project will be conducted in China’s Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Data between the participants in the two programs will not be compared.\n\nThis presentation will present the evidence base used to support the Nunavut project proposal, and will describe the project’s methodology.\n\nOral presentation\n\nForum Theatre for Indigenous Youth Suicide Prevention\n\nJardine, C. Friedel, T. Crowshoe, L. Henderson, R. Montesanti, S. Lines, LA.\n\nFaculty of Health Sciences, University of the Fraser Valley, Chilliwack, B.C., Canada, ac.vfu@enidraj.ydnic\n\nIntroduction: Tragically, suicide accounts for over a third of all deaths among Indigenous youth in Canada and is currently considered a major health crisis. High rates of youth suicide are understood to be reflective of the impacts of cultural disruptions linked to colonial forces. Forum Theatre was investigated as a primary suicide prevention strategy with Indigenous youth in Canadian First Nations and Métis communities. A form of Theatre of the Oppressed, Forum Theatre involves communities in identifying issues of concern, analysing current conditions and causes of a situation, and collectively exploring solutions for change. It is distinguished by the interactive participation of the audience, who function as “spectactors” in exploring alternative outcomes to the play.\n\nMethods: Forum Theatre was introduced to five Indigenous communities representing a range of identities, geographies and governance systems. Activities to date include community meetings to gauge interest, training sessions for community members to actively participate in implementation, and pilot studies with youth.\n\nResults: Experiences from these initial implementation activities will be presented, from the viewpoint of both the university researchers and community participants.\n\nConclusions: Forum Theatre represents a unique form of intervention that appears to be particularly well-suited for involving Indigenous youth in a critical exploration of the risk factors and systems that shape youth suicide, and working with community members to develop concrete strategies for suicide reduction and prevention. It also offers a culturally responsive means to explore youth suicide through community contexts and use intergenerational knowledge and cultural practices to effect change.\n\nOral presentation\n\nEnhancing well being for Indigenous young men and boys through land-based program\n\nJong, M. Baker, K. Healey, G.\n\nFamily Medicine, Memorial University, Happy Valley, Canada, ten.dlfn.praw@gnojm\n\nIn northern Canada, suicide is a leading cause of death in many Indigenous communities. Indigenous males, especially youth, are disproportionately impacted, with suicide rates from 3 to 11 times higher than their non-Indigenous peers.\n\nWe have created a multi-sector partnership to develop, deliver and evaluate a series of land-based mental health programs which combine Indigenous cultural knowledge with therapeutic and health promoting interventions in a wilderness setting in three Canadian territories and one province.\n\nOur programs have improved the mental health of Indigenous males by targeting factors that promote mental health and protect against suicide risk including cultural identity, personal agency, the ability to cope with stress, social support, connection to positive role models, and a sense of community belonging.\n\nThis presentation includes contextualising the issue and showing a 10 minute film “The boys of Nunavut”.\n\nWednesday 15.08. 11:00–12:30.\n\n5. Photovoices and On the Land\n\nOral presentation\n\nCapturing the process – Photovoice as an evaluation method for students participation in the Healers of Tomorrow Gathering\n\nShea, J. Sturge Sparkes, C.\n\nCommunity Health and Humanities, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. Johns, Canada, ac.num.dem@aehS.refinneJ\n\nIn 2008, the Faculty of Medicine at Memorial University began a project supported by the Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nation Chiefs’ Secretariat entitled Making Memorial’s Faculty of Medicine a Better Place for Aboriginal Students. Since 2010 the initiative, now identified as the Aboriginal Health Initiative (AHI), is funded entirely by the Faculty of Medicine. One of the key areas of work for the initiative are services and programs designed to recruit more Aboriginal students into the Faculty of Medicine. One such program is the Healers of Tomorrow Gathering. This biennial gathering brings together Indigenous students throughout Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) from grade 9- to first year university. It provides an opportunity to explore a cross-section of college and university health careers including integration of Aboriginal cultures and medicines. The second offering of this gathering occurred in August 2017 and included participation from Nunavut in addition to NL. To assess the impact of the camp various evaluation methods were employed including surveys, photovoice and sharing circle discussions. Using photography, participants are able to raise their own questions, direct discussions, and share their experiences and opinions [1]. While originally designed as a research methodology, photovoice uses have been widespread and have included application as an evaluation tool [2]. This presentation will share students’ experiences and evaluation of the gathering through their images and words.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Wang C, Pies C.

Wells, S. George, J. Bernards, S. Plain, S. George, T. Graham, K. Linklater, R.\n\nInstitute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, London, Canada, ac.num@mydolem\n\nIntroduction: In Canada, the legacy of colonisation is directly linked to current issues of mental health, substance use, and violence for many Indigenous people. In efforts to address health disparities between Indigenous people and the general population of non-Indigenous people, a study has been funded to build on local community data and strengths-based approaches to develop and implement community mental wellness strategies in five First Nation communities in Ontario.\n\nMethods: Using mixed methods and participatory action research approaches, our program of research engages the community at large and includes consumers/patients, families and informal caregivers, service providers, community leaders, and Elders. This study involves community advisory circles, community surveys, interviews, community forums, participatory action methods such as Photovoice, service or program implementation, and knowledge translation and exchange initiatives throughout the study, all driven by First Nation community stakeholders.\n\nResults: This presentation will focus on the rationale and process of conducting a large study with multiple First Nations communities. We will also share and discuss how the research approach is co-developing relevant and comprehensive mental wellness strategies that build on existing community supports and resilience factors.\n\nConclusion: In addition to implementing community-identified mental wellness strategies, two key objectives for this study are to 1) produce strengths-based guidelines and models for improving mental health, substance use, and violence issues for people in First Nation communities, and 2) disseminate shareable tools, resources, and lessons learned with other Indigenous mental wellness stakeholders in Canada and globally.\n\nOral presentation\n\nUnderstanding Youth-Identified “Connection to the Land” as a Determinant of Dene First Nations Peoples’ Health\n\nLines, LA. Jardine, CG.\n\nSchool of Public Health, University of Alberta, Yellowknife, Canada, ac.atreblau@senil\n\nIntroduction: Social determinants of Indigenous health are known to include unique structural determinants that consider history, political climate, and social contexts that stress the importance of relationships, interconnectivity, and community. Understanding these determinants from the perspective of Indigenous youth is vital to identifying means of alleviating future inequities.\n\nMethods: In 2016, Yellowknives Dene First Nation (YKDFN) youth in the Canadian Northwest Territories participated in the On-the-Land Health Leadership Camp. Using a strength- and community-based participatory approach through an Indigenous research lens, the YKDFN Wellness Division and university researchers crafted the workshop to provide opportunities for youth to practice cultural skills, and to capture the youth’s perspectives of health and health agency. Perspectives of a healthy community, health issues, and health priorities were collected from fifteen youth through sharing circles, PhotoVoice, mural art, and surveys.\n\nResults: The overall emerging theme was that the land connection was imperative for Dene health. Some examples of land connection included practicing cultural skills, Elders passing on traditional knowledge, and surviving off the land. The youth framed future health solutions to include roles for youth and an on-the-land component that builds YKDFN culture, community relations, and traditional knowledge transfer.\n\nConclusions: This research supports the argument that structural context has a direct relationship to determinants of Indigenous Peoples’ health and can play a role in creating future positive impacts.\n\nOral presentation\n\nKeeping Our Traditions for the Mental Wellbeing of Our Youth: “What do we do at the fish camps when there ’s no fish?”\n\nVan Bibber, M. Kassi, N.\n\nResearch, Arctic Institute of Community-based Research, Yukon, Canada, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, ac.wahs@rebbibnavm\n\nIntroduction: Fish camps along the Yukon and Pelly Rivers are a major source of food and way of life for Selkirk First Nation. Declining returns of salmon however puts the very existence of the fish camp tradition in jeopardy. Fish camps are at the heart of transferring traditional knowledge between Elders and youth; healing past traumas and promoting youth mental wellbeing; advancing food security; and encouraging an age-old responsibility to take care of the land. These concerns prompted the research question, “What will we do at the fish camps when there’s no fish?”\n\nMethods: Guided by a local advisory committee, a fish camp survey, community meetings, winter fish camp and photovoice produced rich data, analysed using NVIVO. The community Elders counselled that the research should result in action-oriented materials.\n\nResults: Key strategies for keeping the fish camp traditions alive and ways to mitigate adverse impacts on salmon populations. The creation of a fish camp guidebook is one example of knowledge translation to promote youth mental wellness through land activities. The resilience and depth of knowledge of the Northern Tutchone people is a valuable asset in the face of changing environments.\n\nConclusion: The voice of Northern Tutchone in addressing declining salmon and climate change to the Yukon and Pelly River waterways is integral to overall global strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate changes upon human health. While youth face an uncertain future, this research has reaffirmed the importance of traditional knowledge and on the land activities.\n\nOral presentation\n\nGrowing Hope: Youth gardening in Black Tickle a photovoice project\n\nShea, J. Hudson, A.\n\nCommunity Health and Humanities, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University, St. John’s, Canada, ac.num.dem@aehs.refinnej\n\nThroughout Canada Indigenous communities continuously experience issues with food security; this is enhanced in Northern, remote and Inuit communities (Lardeau, Healey & Ford, 2011). While it is important to be mindful of inequalities it is even more critical to acknowledge and build on strengths. Resilience has repeatedly been showcased by Indigenous communities and youth despite long colonial histories and inequalities. Black Tickle, Labrador is a recognised Southern-Inuit remote community within the NunatuKavut Community Council (NCC); despite its small size (population of 140) it remains a vibrant and resilient community. Presently there is a garden that is being grown by youth in the community at St. Peter’s all grade school. School gardening programs have been shown to improve health outcomes for students as well as engagement, learning, confidence and teamwork (Block et al. 2012). Growing Hope explores the youth’s experiences participating in and contributing to the school garden utilising photovoice methodology. Photovoice is regarded as a participatory research method that enables people to “identify, represent and enhance their community” though photography (Wang & Burris, 1997). It concludes with a feast to share findings with the community and to celebrate the youth’s work. Our presentation provides an overview of the project development, preliminary findings and future directions.\n\nOral presentation\n\nProject Jewel: On-the-land Wellness Program and Inuvialuit-informed Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nEtter, M. Ruttan, J. Giles, A.\n\nCommunity Development Division, Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Inuvik, Canada, moc.tiulaivuni@rettem\n\nIndigenous peoples are increasingly required to engage in monitoring and evaluation, despite Indigenous peoples’ knowledge that on-the-land programs are key to Indigenous health. In partnership with local Elders, knowledge holders, counsellors, policy makers, researchers, past and current participants, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC (Working Group)) is evaluating the effectiveness of Project Jewel, an on-the-land healing program offered to residents of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. Our goal is to determine an Inuvialuit-informed approach to monitoring and evaluation that generates data that are useful for funders, policy-makers, and those who deliver on-the-land programs.\n\nAfter obtaining funding, the Working Group determined that it would assess the experiences of participants and program stakeholders through photo-voice, one-on-one interviews, and focus groups/sharing circles.\n\nData collection, began in the summer of 2017 on-the-land with participants, and in town with stakeholders. Data collection will continue. Project Jewel stakeholders discussed the importance of participants sharing their stories, as these stories do a better job of capturing the benefits than surveys. Participants enjoyed using cameras to take photos and discuss their contents. Some felt that focus groups were difficult contexts to share their feelings, though others appreciated group members’ support. Most supported the use of one-on-one interviews.\n\nEveryone recognised the importance of evaluation as a process not just a product. Next steps include further collaboration with participants to co-determine broader research findings for practical benefit (Scougall, 2006). We hope his research informs culturally-safe evaluation approaches of on-the-land programming.\n\nTrack 2: Culturally sensitive health care\n\nMonday 13.08. 11:00–12:30.\n\n1. Urban Inuit health and education\n\nOral presentation\n\nThe Qanuikkat Siqinirmiut project – developing a research partnership to describe Inuit health in Southern Quebec\n\nFletcher, C. Baron, A. Lyonnais, MC. Pisuktie, AP. Pisuktie, T. Riva, M.\n\nDépartement de médecine sociale et préventive, Université Laval, Quebec, Canada, ac.lavalu.demf@rehctelf.rehpotsirhc\n\nOur paper describes the development of research objectives and partnership between the newly created Southern Quebec Inuit Association (SQIA) and a multi-disciplinary research team. Our project adopts a community-based and participatory research strategy that seeks to develop a knowledge base on community health from an Inuit conceptual framework and on which Inuit community and institutional capacity, services and programs can be developed. It is well established that people in Inuit Nunangat – the four Inuit land claims regions of Nunavut, Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Northwest Territories), Nunatsiavut (Labrador), and Nunavik (Northern Quebec) – suffer disproportionately from a range of chronic and communicable diseases when compared to non-indigenous and southern Canadian populations. Much of this burden can be accounted for within the social determinants of health approach in which access to the resources and conditions that support individual and community health is inadequate, unequal to the other regions of the country, or simply unavailable in northern communities. In contrast, the health of the roughly 20% of the Nunavik Inuit population in Southern Quebec has never been examined in any systematic way. Indeed, Inuit living outside of Inuit Nunangat are largely invisible to northern and southern health authorities. While it is clear to community members and their allies that there are serious health and social issues in the urban centres there is no systematic and comprehensive data available for the population. Given the important health disparities which exist and the growing community capacity of the urban Inuit community our project has the potential provide a deeper understanding and effect positive change in the long run.\n\nOral presentation\n\nMarginalised Greenlanders in Denmark and the impact of current initiatives\n\nMøller, H. Baviskar, S.\n\nDepartment of Health Sciences, Associate Director Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada, ac.udaehekal@relleomh\n\nBackground: While most Greenlanders in Denmark are doing well, a minority group (6–10%) live under marginalised and socially isolated circumstances most (about 1/3) in the larger cites of Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, Esbjerg and Copenhagen. Nation-wide initiatives (projects) to help improve the living conditions of this minority group were launched in 2013 and four follow-up initiatives (transition and peer support; Strategy for marginalised Greenlanders; the Inclusion initiative; securing of unique supports for marginalised Greenlanders) commenced in 2017, spreading beyond the five initial cities. Currently little is known about the outcome of the follow-up initiatives and about how marginalised Greenlanders living outside the five initial major cities are faring.\n\nMethods: Through document review and qualitative interviews with project leaders and frontline workers we give an overview of the current situation for marginalised Greenlanders in Denmark and a point in time status of the four initiatives underway.\n\nFindings: Similar to other persons living under marginalised circumstances in Denmark, marginalised Greenlanders are heterogeneous, have differentiated needs and respond to initiatives in diverse ways. In order to be able to support individuals in the best way possible trusting relationships must be developed and the small changes for the better in the social circumstances and general living conditions of an individual are time intensive but also perceived to be successes.\n\nConclusion: In order to support marginalised Greenlanders as best as possible and with the goal of positive integration in the local milieu, individualised approaches with continued frontline worker contact and longer term initiatives are necessary.\n\nOral presentation\n\nTransforming the academy: The University of Manitoba ’s Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing\n\nCook, C. Anderson, M. Lavallee, B. Lavoie, J. McKinnon, M.\n\nIndigenous Institute of health and Healing Ongomiizwin, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, ac.abotinamu@kooc.enirehtac\n\nIn June 2017, the University of Manitoba launched the Indigenous Institute of Health and Healing, Ongomiizwin (an Anishnabee word which means clearing the path for generations to come). This launch was the culmination of a number of factors, including,\n\n50 years of northern health service provision through the J.A. Hildes Northern Medical Unit;\n\nThe success of the Manitoba First Nations Centre for Aboriginal Health Research in promoting partnership-based research between Indigenous communities and organisations, and university-based researchers;\n\nThe pivotal role of the Centre for Aboriginal Health Education in supporting Indigenous students engaged in health professional programs; and\n\nA critical mass of Indigenous leadership as well as support for reconciliation within the Faculty and the University of Manitoba’s broader priority of Indigenous Achievement.\n\nThe Institute’s scope and scale is unprecedented in Manitoba and Canada. Ongomiizwin’s mission is to provide leadership and advance excellence in research, education and health services in collaboration with First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities. Its work is led by the Vice-Dean of Indigenous Health and guided by Knowledge Keepers and Elders, who help to blend Indigenous and Western health paradigms. This presentation will discuss Ongomiizwin’s transformation agenda under the three pathways,\n\n• Embedding antiracist curriculum in professional programs offered by Rady Faculty of Health Sciences’ five colleges;\n\n• Supporting Indigenous communities and organisations towards the development of their own research capacity and leadership in Indigenous health research;\n\n• Expand efforts for culturally safe, effective and integrated service delivery models. Help create an environment patients need to facilitate health and wellness.\n\nOral presentation\n\nDifferences in socioeconomic characteristics and health status between Inuit living in and outside Inuit Nunangat\n\nRiva, M. Dufresne, P. Fletcher, C.\n\nInstitute for Health and Social Policy and Department of Geography, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, ac.lligcm@avir.enelym\n\nIntroduction: At the 2016 Canadian Census, 17,695 (27%) of Inuit lived outside Inuit Nunangat. While health status and social disparities in Inuit Nunangat have received attention of public agencies and population health researchers, less is known about Inuit living in the South. This paper examines and compares socioeconomic characteristics and health status of Inuit living in and outside Inuit Nunangat.\n\nMethods: Data from the 2012 Aboriginal People Survey (APS) is analysed. Participants self-identified as Inuit. Socioeconomic characteristics considered include: educational attainment, work status, income, housing conditions. Participants reported their self-rated general and mental health, health-related behaviours, and health care use. Data were analysed using weighted descriptive statistics.\n\nResults: Having completed high school and higher income were significantly more prevalent among Southern Inuit. The prevalence of household overcrowding and repairs needed were significantly lower among Southern Inuit, but residential mobility was higher. With regards to health status, Southern Inuit reported better general and mental health, lower smoking, but higher frequency of alcohol consumption. Whereas unmet health care need did not vary between groups, consulting a health professional was more common among Southern Inuit.\n\nConclusions: Southern Inuit enjoyed, overall, more favourable socioeconomic conditions and health status than Inuit living in Inuit Nunangat. Yet the health and social needs of the unstably housed or marginalised Southern Inuit living are not captured by this survey. More work is needed to produce a more comprehensive social and health profile of Southern Inuit in order to develop culturally appropriate programs and policies in southern urban centres.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nCultural Competency Training in a National Organization; Realising the Truth and Reconciliation ’s Calls to Action.\n\nHutchinson, P.

For the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (The Partnership) and cancer care across Canada is to minimise the disparity realised amongst First Nations, Inuit and Métis. An evidenced based strategy to reduce this disparity recognises a strong correlation between health outcomes and culture. This strategy is also informed by the recognised need to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into the delivery of cancer care.\n\nBy providing cultural competency training Partnership staff will be prepared to engage First Nations, Inuit and Métis in respectful effective relationships to advance the priorities and engage the strategies of First Nations, Inuit and Métis within cancer care. Cultural competency training will increase the knowledge of Partnership staff on material that contextualises First Nations, Inuit and Métis and influence health outcomes and health care utilisation.\n\nMethods: Six training modules have been developed to deliver cultural competency training. The approach utilises the stages of change model and an Indigenous informed social change model. Evaluation of the modules is meant to improve uptake and understanding of cultural competency.\n\nResults: Evaluations demonstrate increased understanding and increased uptake of culturally competent practices.\n\nConclusions: People are moving through the modules in understanding and intellect. The qualitative feedback indicates an understanding and awareness of the necessity for cultural competency and the need to place this awareness within their work immediately. Limitations to uptake are addressed and program revisions to increase diffusion are described.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nRural Week: Medical Student Perspectives on a one week first year placement in Northern and Remote Settings – 12 Years of Reflection\n\nDurcan, A. Goulet, S. Conroy, D.\n\nOngomiizwin Health Services, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, ac.abotinamu@teluog.aras\n\nIntroduction: In the late 1990s, educating medical students in a rural environment was identified as a priority at the University of Manitoba (U of M). Rural exposure in medical school is associated with choice of rural practice in the future. (1). Early, frequent, and longer duration of rural exposures have the greatest impact on choice of rural practice. (2) The U of M partnered with Manitoba’s Office of Rural and Northern Health (ORNH) in planning and delivering a rural clinical and community experience at the end of first year medical school. The J.A.Hildes Northern Medical Unit (NMU; now Ongomiizwin Health Services OHS) had a long history of sending learners to communities served. NMU/OHS partnered in sending students to communities in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut and northern Manitoba. Student evaluations over 12 years were entered into a database held by ORNH.\n\nQuestion: Did students positively evaluate their experiences in NMU/OHS communities? Did their experience change their level of interest in working in a rural or northern community?\n\nMethods: Student level of satisfaction with the clinical and community experience, attitudes to rural medicine and were analysed. Results from 2014–2017 students’ surveys pre and post Rural Week regarding interest in working in small communities were used to see if attitudes to northern medicine changed after the exposure.\n\nResults: Qualitative and quantitative data will be presented regarding level of satisfaction with clinical and community experience, and changes in attitude regarding work in small communities upon graduation.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nA paper media review of patient experiences in the Northwest Territories\n\nAffleck, Z.\n\nResearch Intern, Institute for Circumpolar Health Research, Yellowknife, Canada, ac.rhci@kcelffa.rednaz\n\nBackground: There has been a need identified to understand patient experiences in the NWT. Patient experiences entail elements such as quality of care, resources, health plans, accessibility, and availability. In the Territory there is consistent use of media to share information and is seen to be one source of patient experiences. Media reviews have previously explored issues around domestic violence, and travel emergencies in the Northwest Territories.\n\nPatient experiences in the media have yet to be explored. This information is being sought to provide a lens on the voice of patients in the NWT. Methods: This voice will be categorised as per the Ontario patient experiences framework which recognises patient aspirations including “don’t hurt me”, “safety”, “heal me” etc. This framework outlines the shared commitment and responsibility to respond to the needs and aspirations of patients. Results: Our analysis of patient experiences in the NWT and Nunavut aims to improve patient outcomes by improving our knowledge of issues important to the public. Through an analysis of digital media, we hope to indicate common illnesses, patient experiences, and outcomes. Conclusions: Key findings that may help address reoccurring issues to ensure better outcomes concerning the health and wellbeing of patients in Canada’s North will be shared.\n\nMonday 13.08. 13:30–15:00.\n\n2. Health education\n\nOral presentation\n\nCircle of Care: A holistic approach to caring for First Nations peoples and communities.\n\nKyoon-Achan, G. Walker, J.\n\nCounselling, Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, Manitoba, Canada, ac.ssenllewncn@euqcaj\n\nIntroduction: The Circle of Care approach is a service delivery planning process that is embedded in Cree indigenous values and culture. Rooted in the Medicine Wheel teachings, it takes a deeply holistic approach in ensuring that services provided to community members are meaningful and meetings specific needs. Service providers plan together and cluster around Individuals and families to provide relevant health and social supports. Methods: This participatory, action oriented and community-based approach emanates directly from and aligns with First Nations medicine wheel teachings of holism and balance. The teachings have been passed on and applied for generations among various indigenous peoples. Results: The model as a service planning tool, provides children, youth, Elders, families and their communities with collaboratively coordinated health and social services/supports. Services pool and muster strengths to target needs and attain desired outcomes for clients. It is implemented in six steps including 1. An intake process, 2. Transfer of family to primary worker, 3. Comprehensive Circle of Care assessment, 4. Development of a Circle of Care plan, 5. Facilitating a Circle of Care Meeting, 6. Service coordination and follow-ups. The process is enhanced using a life wheel assessment tool which is used as necessary and assists in determining specific areas of most crucial needs in an individual or family’s being. Conclusion: This approach promotes shared responsibility, shared decision making, shared services goals and shared accountability towards strengthening individuals and families in all aspects of their being physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.\n\nOral presentation\n\nEnhancing cultural sensitivity in health care services in Nunavik by developing pedagogical tools for interveners working in health and social services\n\nPlourde-Léveillé, L. Fraser, S.\n\nPsychology, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montréal, Canada, ac.maqu.reirruoc@ael.ellievel-edruolp\n\nIntroduction: Many authors discuss the importance of culturally sensitive training for non-indigenous workers in indigenous communities to improve services. However, little is known about the factors that foster the appropriation of training tools. In Nunavik, health and social service workers have consistently expressed the lack of material representing their reality.\n\nMethod: A participatory approach was used for this study. The Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Service (NRBHSS) selected themes for pilot tools: Working with interpreters and Self-determination and Empowerment based on results from a qualitative study conducted in the region. The tools were developed with the material from the study coupled with scientific literature and fieldwork experience. Andragogy inspired reflective exercises were developed. The tools were reviewed by 15 professionals from the field, Inuit and non-Inuit, and their comments were transcribed. Thematic analyses were conducted.\n\nResults: The tools were considered very relevant and respectful of their reality. It responded to a need for more contextual information to refer to. The clinical examples helped to understand the reality of Inuit colleagues and patients. Community names and verbatim quotes made them feel like the tools were tailor-made which fostered trust towards the content.\n\nConclusion: The NRBHSS will present the tools as a complement to the pre-departure training. This innovative solution has the potential to improve health and social services in Northern regions by enhancing the cultural sensitivity in health care.\n\nOral presentation\n\nCultural Based Health Interventions: Indigenous Doulas for First Nations Women Who Travel for Birth\n\nCidro, J. Sinclair, S. Phillips-Beck, W. Mercer, J. Bluesky, K.\n\nResearch, First Nation Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, moc.msshnf@kceb-spillihpw\n\nMedical evacuation or confinement has been a practice across Canada for expectant Indigenous women in rural and remote communities. Women typically leave their communities at 36–38 weeks gestation and are placed in hotels or hostels while they wait to deliver their baby. Up until recently, First Nations women were often going unaccompanied or with little support for escorts. The displacement of women during this critical time in their pregnancy has shown to have tremendous psychosocial impacts on mother, child, family and community by removing this important journey away from cultural traditions, land and family. This presentation will focus on the development of Indigenous doulas or birth companions in Manitoba with a specific focus on First Nations women who travel for birth. Wiijii’idiwag Ikwewag (Manitoba Indigenous Doulas Initiative – MIDI) is a group led by Indigenous women focusing on supporting the sacred bonds of, family and culture to the birth of a new baby who are training women in the city and in First Nations communities to become birth helpers. The birth helpers are trained to provide emotional, physical and spiritual support to expectant mothers but do not provide clinical skills for prenatal women, during the delivery and postpartum. Each First Nation established a community advisory circle which guided the implementation of the project in their community. The research methods included training local research data collectors which interviewed the mothers at three times throughout their pregnancies using both established prenatal measures and qualitative questions. The project demonstrated that the support of cultural based birth helpers results in improved birth experiences for First Nations women who travel for birth.\n\nOral presentation\n\nArctic health research at Umeå University – a bibliometric content analysis\n\nNilsson, LM.\n\nArcum, Arctic Research Centre at Umeå university, Umeå university, Umeå, Sweden, es.umu@nosslin.anel\n\nIntroduction: According to a bibliometric analysis supported by the Swedish Research Council less than 5% of all Arctic publications 2008–2010 had a clinical medical perspective (1). A bibliometric analysis supported by the University of the Arctic (UArctic) showes a growing interest in Arctic health research and a proportional contribution of at least 13% 2011–2015 (2). The aim with this presentation is to provide an overview of Arctic health research at Umeå University, Sweden.\n\nMethods: Arctic research have been systematically indexed for the period 2010–2017 in collaboration between Arcum, the Arctic Research Centre at Umeå University, and the University library. Based on these indexed publications a content analysis was performed by a quantitative keyword search in titles, abstracts and registered keywords.\n\nResults: Of totally 1892 indexed Arctic publications, 32% (n = 608) were related to health, of which 88.5% were peer-reviewed journal papers (n = 538). Among the journal papers, health research related to occupation (n = 198), food (n = 114), infection (n = 77), and climate (n = 61) dominated in numbers. Among uncommunicable diseases cardiovascular disease (n = 76), cancer (n = 53), and diabetes (n = 40) were the most common issues to be targeted. Gender (n = 179) and indigenous issues (n = 59) were another important factor in common for many of these publications.\n\nConclusion: At Umeå University Arctic health research is strongly related to living conditions (occupation, food, climate), and infectious diseases. Cardiovascular morbidity is the main public health concern and gender and indigeneity are horizontal criteria of significant importance.\n\nOral presentation\n\nHow standard is standard? Examining the standard scores of the CELF-P2 in Northern Populations of the Beaufort Delta\n\nHay, ALM. Boyle, JM.\n\nOngomiizwin – Health Services (formerly known as J.A Hildes Northern Medical Unit), University of Manitoba, Rankin Inlet, Canada, ac.un.vog@yaha\n\nIntroduction: One of the many challenges of providing Speech-Language Pathology services to Northern populations is the lack of culturally appropriate normative language data for assessment tools. Current standardised assessments have no normative data for this population, therefore causing clinicians to question the validity of their data versus regional dialectal differences. In 2011, 4 communities across the Beaufort Delta were assessed using standard Speech Language Pathology measures. The purpose of the study was to determine how the average student performs on the standardised assessment measures.\n\nThere is documented need for greater understanding of regional dialects, supporting the early language development of Inuit and Northern Indigenous peoples, thus decreasing the mismatch between mainstream services and the needs of the community (Ball and Lewis, 2004).\n\nMethods: Kindergarten classes in 4 communities across the Beaufort Delta were administered the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – Preschool 2nd edition (CELF-P2). Additional factors considered include: language spoken at home and cultural identity/ethnicity.\n\nResults: Standard scores were consistently lower than expected based on the available normative data.\n\nConclusion: Normative data based on assessments normed on the general North American population should not be applied for assessment and treatment of speech and language concerns in the Inuvialuit and Gwich’in populations of the Beaufort Delta region of NWT. This may impact other northern indigenous and Inuit populations for the purposes of speech and language assessment. Further understanding of regional dialects should be considered.\n\nPoster presentation\n\nCulturally-responsive arts and social media-based interventions to promote positive sexual health, attitudes and behaviours among Nunavut youth\n\nHorlick, S. Diakite, N. Healey, G.\n\nFamily Health Research, Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre, Iqaluit, Canada, ac.crhq@etikaid.elocin\n\nRecurrent Syphilis outbreaks and high reports of Gonorrhoea and Chlamydia in Nunavut communities confirms the need for responsive, innovative, and evidence-based intervention strategies. The purpose of the project is to shift attitudes and behaviours towards, and improve knowledge about, sexual health, sexuality, intimate relationships, and sexually transmitted infections through Inuit knowledge sharing and teaching techniques through the use of a social marketing campaign.\n\nA mixed methods approach will be conducted to include the collection of quantitative and qualitative data through the implementation of pre and post workshop surveys focused on safe sex and self-efficacy, STI knowledge, attitudes towards HIV, attitudes towards intimate partner violence, agency and decision-making, and peer pressure experiences to provide baseline data for the social marketing campaign. As youth report the largest number of STIs, the primary audience will include Inuit youth between the ages of 14 and 25 who reside in Nunavut.\n\nPreliminary data was collected in Cambridge Bay and Iqaluit, Nunavut (n = 35) to provide insight into youth use of social media. Self-report indicated Facebook and Snapchat are the most popular social media platforms in this population. Next steps are to use this data to: develop a social marketing campaign for Facebook and Snapchat to focus on sexual health messaging; Engage local gender and sexual diversity youth groups to develop the campaign content; Pilot and evaluate the social marketing campaign based on the engagement with and uptake of campaign messaging, visuals, and stories.\n\nTuesday 14.08. 11:00–12:30.\n\n3. Community involvement\n\nOral presentation\n\nInuit community perspectives and population health surveys: the example of the “Community Component” of Qanuilirpitaa?, the 2017 Nunavik Health Survey\n\nRiva, M. Fletcher, C. Lyonnais, MC. Lynch, M.\n\nInstitute for Health and Social Policy and Department of Geography, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, ac.lligcm@avir.enelym\n\nIntroduction: Understanding the salience of community conditions for health is necessary for health promotion efforts. Doing so requires new approaches and sources of data to describe community conditions in line with local knowledge, experience and meaning. We present a locally-informed framework conceptualising community conditions relevant to Nunavimmiut’s health and well-being, as developed in the context of the “Community Component” of Qanuilirpitaa?, the 2017 Nunavik Health Survey.\n\nMethods: In 2016, workshops were conducted in two Nunavik communities to conceptualise community conditions important for health and well-being. With the concepts of inuqatigitsiarniq (the ties that bind people together) and piusiq (way of life or “core of things”, referring to both the strengths and values of the community), ten dimensions of community conditions emerged (e.g. family, community relationships). Data collection to characterised communities along the 10 dimensions took place in Fall 2017/Winter 2018, using three approaches: survey questionnaires; in-depth interviews with key informants; and mapping of local resources addressing the 10 dimensions.\n\nResults: More than 1300 Nunavimmiut responded to the survey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 65 community members. Over 350 local resources related to one of the ten community dimensions were inventoried, characterised, and geo-located.\n\nDiscussion: The ultimate outcome of the Community Component is to identify ways that local factors contributing to community health can be recognised and enhanced, and areas where new programming and policy can be directed. The analysis and synthesis of the multiple sources of data will support community mobilisation efforts championed by the region and the communities.\n\nOral presentation\n\nInnu eishkupenanu – Planning collaborative research on Innu minuinniuin (wellbeing): a case study in Indigenous community-based participatory research (CBPR)\n\nWard, LM. Hill, MJ. Piccard, A. Andrew, A. Poker, C. Chreim, S. Jull, J. Morton Ninomya, ME. Olsen Harper, A. Pollock, NJ. Wells, SL.\n\nPopulation Health PhD Program, Interdisciplinary Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, moc.liamg@drawronoel\n\nIntroduction: The Innu live in two remote and isolated First Nation (FN) communities in Canada’s North. Both communities form the Innu Nation of Labrador. Innu experience significant health inequities compared to non-Indigenous populations in Canada. Thus it is imperative that research to action models are developed to improve Innu health. This presentation will share the process of jointly planning a research study and key lessons learned.\n\nMethods: We formed a collaborative team of Innu stakeholders and researchers with the aim of co-creating and translating knowledge to improve Innu health applying a strength-based approach that considers Innu understanding of “minuinniuin” (wellbeing).\n\nResults: Jointly planning the study was an iterative and active process, where mutual learning and sensitivity to community context brought about strategies for community-based participatory research (CBPR). Some of these strategies included approaching team members individually for input away from larger groups, and incorporating Innu leaders in the advisory group to facilitate results uptake. We propose a model of study co-planning where community stakeholders and researchers collaborate in the research process from conceptualisation, planning, conduct, to knowledge translation. The process highlights principles of self-determination, mutual learning and community empowerment.\n\nConclusions: The process of engagement between FN partners and researchers to co-plan a study requires building space for mutual learning and sensitivity to context from the inception of the collaboration. Based on lessons learned, we propose a model of collaboration and offer insights that contribute to a body of literature on CBPR with FN and other Indigenous communities.\n\nOral presentation\n\nCollaboration with Manitoba First Nations communities, sharing our experience of working together on the Rights path.\n\nPhillips-Beck, W. Lavoie, J. Katz, A. Kinew, KA. Kyoon-Achan, G. Ibrahim, N. Sinclair, S.\n\nResearch Centre, Nanaadawewigamig, The First Nation Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, moc.msshnf@kceb-spillihpw\n\nIntroduction: Innovation in Community-based Primary Health Care (CBPHC) Supporting Transformation in the Health of First Nation and rural/remote communities in Manitoba, Canada – (iPHIT) is a 5-year research partnership between the University of Manitoba, Nanaandawewigamig and 8 First Nations (FN) which aimed to understand FN perceptions & experiences with PHC; and use this knowledge to improve the scope and delivery of CBPHC services.\n\nMethods: The FN ethical principles framed our work: 1) free prior and informed consent; 2) ownership, control access and possession of data (OCAP ™); 3) FN ethics and 4) benefit to First Nations. We will review the process of engaging multiple FN partners throughout the research project from planning to dissemination of results. This involved the creation of joint FN and university co-led research teams; FN oversight, coordination and data management; maintaining ongoing communication; community support and formation of Local Advisory Committees; hiring and building skills locally (Local Research Assistants) and FN directed interpretation and implementation of innovative projects.\n\nResults: Key elements and methods of successful collaboration include: 1) investing time and resources into developing respectful research relationships; 2) strong FN leadership and governance; 3) clearly defined roles and responsibilities; 4) meaningful participation of FNs; 5) multiple opportunities for community engagement; and 6) ongoing, consistent, multiple forms of communication.\n\nConclusion: We will describe the essential elements of meaningful partnerships and collaborative research. These elements are integral to creating and maintaining the integrity of the research as well as developing and implementing research that is useful and valued by FN’s.\n\nOral presentation\n\nEnhancing collaboration with Inuit community members in health and social services to reduce health inequities in Nunavik\n\nFraser, S. Plourde-Léveillé, L. Gagnon, D.\n\nPsychology, University of Montreal, Montréal, Canada, ac.maqu.reirruoc@ael.ellievel-edruolp\n\nIntroduction: According to the WHO (2018), integrating community workers in health and social services has the potential to reduce health inequities in access to care while improving the cultural sensitivity of interventions. The literature in this field of research is abundant in global health. However, very little is known about the specific realities of working with indigenous workers within North American structures of services.\n\nMethod: Fraser and colleagues (2016) conducted qualitative interviews to explore collaboration in child health care, social care and wellbeing services in Nunavik. Inuit and non-Inuit, workers from different institutions and professions, as well as families were interviewed (N = 60). Excerpts referring to collaboration with Inuit community members working or volunteering in health and social services were extracted. A thematic analysis was conducted to explore the roles taken by or given to Inuit workers, the challenges and the experienced benefits of such collaboration.\n\nResults: Although many jobs were described, the roles were very limited. Lack of training, absenteeism and confidentiality issues were the most frequently mentioned challenges. Many benefits were highlighted including better relationships with families, better communication with the patient and better understanding of patients’ realities. Structural and contextual barriers were identified as limiting the roles and possibilities for Inuit within the current structure of health and social services.\n\nConclusion: Even though collaboration can be challenging, the experienced benefits are important. Our research brings to light many factors that have the potential to enhance this collaboration to eventually improve the accessibility and the cultural sensitivity of care.\n\nOral presentation\n\nExploring Aajiiqatigiingniq as an Inuit-specific therapeutic approach to community justice in support of a Wellness Court in Nunavut, Canada\n\nFerrazzi, P. Tagalik, S. Karetak, J. Baker, K. Angalik, L.\n\nAqqiumavvik Society, Arviat, Canada, moc.liamg@qajuapkuni\n\nIntroduction: This research explores the potential for using culturally appropriate systems to more effectively address wellness and justice related issues. Definitions of wellness, addiction, mental illness and rehabilitation are currently embedded in Western systems of health and justice. Since colonisation, Inuit cultural systems of care, wellbeing and rehabilitation have been compromised. Western systems often fail to consider Inuit perspectives that emphasise reconciliation of an individual to the community. This research which defines health and wellbeing within an Inuit context aligns with the collective Canadian process of reconciliation with Indigenous communities.\n\nAajiiqatigiingniq, an age-old cultural system, may offer new possibilities for community wellness and justice within Nunavut. It is a system embedded in a holistic worldview that addresses the individual, family, community within a complex spectrum of wellbeing and the supports required to establish health and harmony. In our exploration of this Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit guiding principle, we assess the potential for aajiiqatigiingniq to provide Inuit-defined therapeutic support to a Wellness Court.\n\nMethods: The study involves focus groups and individual interviews with Elders to assess the agility of the concept of aajiiqatigiingniq as a foundational construct for a wellness framework. A consensus group process then engages knowledge holders across the community to develop wellness indicators.\n\nResults: This collaborative project develops a culturally embedded wellness indicator framework that enables the community to assess its capacity to provide Inuit-defined consensus driven therapeutic support to a prospective Wellness Court. We use video creation to document and reflect our discussions and ideas back to the community\n\nOral presentation\n\nCreating an Innovative Pathway for a Culturally Relevant Health Workforce: Lessons Learned from Knowledge Keepers Forum\n\nButler, L. Moller, S. Kuosa,, K. Berry, L. Manskow, U. Mougaard-Frederiksen, H. Isidor, S. Olesen, P. Lennert Olsen, L. Frandsen, S.\n\nOffice Vice President Research, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, ac.ksasu@reltub.anrol\n\nIntroduction: Universities are well positioned to provide leadership in developing a local health professional workforce in northern communities, yet on-site opportunities for post-secondary education have been a significant challenge, due to geographical barriers, reluctance to change methods and delivery of teaching and a lack of available resources. For many northern students the reality of attending university requires them to leave their communities and for those who do, attrition rates remain high. Distributed learning, using advanced technologies offers possibilities that can be tailored for programs, faculty, and individual students. Given the low numbers of health professionals in rural and remote northern communities, collaboration is essential for effective service delivery. This creates excellent opportunities for interprofessional education of health professionals.\n\nMethods: The first of three knowledge exchange activities began with the Knowledge Keepers Forum held in Nuuk, Greenland. Participants included health educators from Norway, Canada and Greenland and representatives from health care organisations in remote community settings, leaders of health region – urban and rural, Ministry level policy-makers long term care facilities, and patient advocates.\n\nResults: Key areas explored were: Global Synergies for Innovation in Health; Culture, Context and Social Determinants, and Technology: Connecting Circumpolar Countries for Care. Foundational information obtained for a pathway reflected a shared interest in taking education to the students rather than leaving communities.\n\nConclusions: Although foundations were evident, more work is needed to create a plan for distributed learning and interprofessional education. Suggestions included the opportunity to experience a rural and remote community with more traditional stories and experiences. Local knowledge is not necessarily traditional knowledge. Linking education to culture and existing best practices would strengthen a pathway. Additionally beginning with a focus on distributed interprofessional continuing education of existing health professionals would aid success.\n\nTuesday 14.08. 13:30–15:030.\n\n4. Youth\n\nOral presentation\n\nEquitable health services for the young? A decomposition of income-related inequalities in young adults’ utilisation of health care in Northern Sweden\n\nMosquera, PA. Waenerlund, AK. Goicolea, I. San Sebastian, M. Gustafsson, PE.\n\nEpidemiology and Global Health, Norrland’s Observatory for Equity in Health and Health Care, Umeå, Sweden, es.umu@naitsabesnas.leugim\n\nIntroduction: Despite the goal of the Swedish health system to offer health care according to the principle of horizontal equity, little is known about the equality in access to health care use among young people. To explore this issue, the present study aimed i) to assess horizontal inequity in health care utilisation among young people in Northern Sweden; and ii) to explore the contribution of different factors to explain the observed inequalities.\n\nMethods: Participants (N = 3016 youths aged 16–25 years) came from the “Health on Equal terms” survey conducted in 2014 in the four northernmost counties in Sweden. Concentration indices (C) and horizontal inequity indices (HI) were calculated to measure inequalities in the utilisation of general practitioners (GP) and youth clinics, and subsequently decomposed.\n\nResults: Even after taking health care needs into consideration, the utilisation of youth clinics remained significantly pro-rich (HI = 0.099); and consistently pro-poor for the GP visits (HI = −0.058). The decomposition analyses suggest that socioeconomic inequalities explain a considerable portion of the pro-rich utilisation of youth clinics services and that need factors and socioeconomic conditions accounted for the pro-poor concentration of GP visits.\n\nConclusions: The distribution of GP visits among young people in Northern Sweden slightly favoured the low-income group, and thus seems to meet the premises of horizontal equity. In contrast, the findings suggest substantial pro-rich horizontal inequity in the utilisation of youth clinics among young women, which are largely rooted in socioeconomic inequalities.\n\nOral presentation\n\nSpoken words and silence use in young children medical consultation: the interactional dimension of healthcare, Nunavik, Quebec Arctic\n\nBenoît, A.\n\nAnthropology, Inalco, Créteil, France, moc.liamg@tionebira\n\nIn Nunavik, the need to promote Inuit language and culture expression in medical institution is acknowledged. While « Qanuippitaa ? » 2004 health survey identified significant nuances regarding Nunavik inhabitants’ health, this approach involves considering Inuit conception of health and interpersonal relationships.\n\nThrough an ethnographic study including the observation of 16 medical consultations and interviews with Inuit patients and Franco-quebecers medical personnel, verbal and non verbal means of communication are described. Speech act theory and the concept of maintaining, losing or saving « face » in interaction are two notions used to analyse the expression of Inuit social skills, and spoken words and silence effects on health.\n\nDespite a shared concern to maintain harmonious interactions, tensions due to contextual, cultural and language factors have been identified.\n\nThese tensions can undermine interpersonal relationships and overall health, but can also be transformed by developing common social skills and sharing knowledge.\n\nOral presentation\n\nRemoval of Parents: A Manitoba First Nation community approach to reducing the trauma of child apprehension\n\nKyoon-Achan, G. Walker, F.\n\nNCN Family and Community Wellness Centre, Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, Winnipeg, Canada, ac.abotinamu@nahcAnooyK.ecarG\n\nIntroduction: Child protection services in Manitoba are mandated to protect children who experience physical injury, emotional disability of a permanent nature or sexual exploitation because of an action or failure to act by any person. In practice, this “protection” has involved apprehending children who are often removed from their homes and placed in the care of agencies or foster care in environments that are foreign to the child. This process can profoundly destabilise and traumatise children creating feelings of shame and guilt. The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation in Northern Manitoba decided to protect children by removing the parents from troubled homes rather than the children. Methods: The approach was developed following wide consultations with Ketiyatisak Elders in the community, families and the community at large. Results: Parents removed from homes are supported to change the behaviours and conditions that may have resulted the neglect or harm to children. The children are then supported to remain within the comfort of their homes surrounded by familiar environments and other family members. Conclusion: The “Removal of Parents” encourages a holistic approach to child protection which does not destabilise or merely rely on child apprehensions, causing hardships to the child or children and trauma to parents without recourse. The model sets in motion a process wherein, all parties involved work together towards a desired end. Ultimately, children are secure and sheltered, parents are supported in meaningful ways and protection workers take on mediatory roles that are fundamental for community enhancement.\n\nOral presentation\n\nImplementation of School Clinics as a way to Address Gaps in Health Provision among the Paediatric ADHD Population of a Northern Manitoba First Nations Reserve\n\nPaniak, A. Morrow, A.\n\nGeneral Physician, University of Manitoba -Norway House Cree Nation Reserve, Winnipeg, Canada, moc.liamg@kainap.atina\n\nIntroduction: Hospital clinic staff and administrative staff from the two schools located on Norway House Cree Nation reserve, identified numerous gaps in healthcare provision of the paediatric ADHD population:\n\nLegal guardians identified multiple barriers in accessing healthcare regularly\n\nA lack of consistent communication permeated the physical-teacher relationship\n\nIneffective use of time among individual resource teachers providing care existed\n\nThis culminated in lack of treatment as well as inappropriate wholistic treatment, non-adherence, poor school performance and subsequent school and home life dysfunction. An ADHD program was designed at each school where the same physician provided care at regular intervals, having direct contact with school staff and parents simultaneously.\n\nMethods: Objectively, the rate of attendance was documented. A five minute anonymous written questionnaire using both the Likert scale and open ended questions requiring written responses was disseminated among all stakeholders at both schools.\n\nResults: The attendance rates were documented. Generally, more time efficient, consistent care was provided with easier accessibility for all stakeholders. On-going barriers were identified, and recommendations focused on improving efficiency within the current care model and addressing the need for non-pharmacological ways to improve care.\n\nConclusion: School ADHD clinics are a demonstrated better alternative in addressing healthcare gaps of the ADHD population compared to the previous in hospital clinic model and new suggestions will be implemented.\n\nWednesday 15.08. 11:00–12:30.\n\n5.
