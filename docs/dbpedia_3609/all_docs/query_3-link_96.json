This document discusses the development of a research instrument called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) adapted specifically for tax contexts. The DIT was originally created to measure ethical reasoning but has been criticized for not representing reasoning in professional contexts like tax. The authors developed a tax-specific version of the DIT to compare the ethical reasoning of tax practitioners and non-specialists in both tax and general social contexts. They detail the process of creating context-specific scenarios and items to measure reasoning levels in developing their tax DIT, which will aid comparison across studies of ethical reasoning in different domains and groups.",
