        "text": "The notion of moral dilemma is frequently used experimentally across some fields such as psychology, social sciences, management, medical studies, and humanities where serious decisions have to be made between two unpleasant things that can have serious life consequences. In the present article, though briefly in scope, we tried to supply related information regarding the noticeable characteristics of dilemmas, their differences, and the regular number of dilemmatic scenarios that have been usually employed in experimental experiences. We, therefore, explained that dilemmas could be of two major types: Self-imposed or other- imposed with either high level or low level of personal involvement. Then, across tentative situations by renowned scholars, the dilemmas have ranged from 2 to 40 stories for experimentation. Furthermore, because of the sensitivity and importance of decision making under dilemmatic situations and different cultural interpretations of these situations."
