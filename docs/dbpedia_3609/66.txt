Instructions

On the next page, you will be asked to complete the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2). This questionnaire is concerned with how you define the issues in a social problem. Based on Lawrence Kohlbergâ€™s theory of moral development, these issues ask you to judge what is important when making a decision. The DIT-2 presents you five very short stories, each describing a different ethical dilemma. After reading each situation, you are asked to decide on a course of action, rate the importance of 12 issues pertaining to the situation, and rank the four most important elements influencing your evaluation of the situation.

As you complete the DIT-2, please keep in mind:

Once the results have been processed you will receive a score for this test, and our interpretation of the Duke results overall.

If you have any questions about the study or the DIT-2 questionnaire, you are welcome to contact The Office of Assessment, at assessment@duke.edu
