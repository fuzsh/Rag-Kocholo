        "text": "The idea of power is shown through symbolism in “But in Sydney money buys status and is the greatest equaliser”, the effect of symbolism establishes an idea that money is a currency that forms an individual’s reputation that creates them to be a superior character amongst those who are considered not of equal value. Further evidence of corruption is occurring in Marele’s novel through the use of idiom and colloquial language in “Respectable businessman rub shoulders with bookies, judges, and high ranking police officers” this states that individuals usually support powerful characters with more authority so they many benefit themselves in terms of power and authority which reflects as an act of corruption. The use of juxtaposition and imagery in “Commissioners are seen in night clubs with well-known crime figures, and I don’t mean statistics, crime figures who themselves are “Respectable businessmen”, Commissioners are high ranking federal officers, however the imagery of a night-club with well-known crime figures may arouse suspicion of corruption through “white collar activities” that highlights the occurrence of crime in Sydney that is known seen by others. Day's novel states that corruption was forged in the early stages of the\n\nGreed is a major flaw, it shows selfishness. The character who shows this very well throughout the play is reverend Paris. Paris tends to be greedy throughout the play in many different times. Reverend Paris makes several references of greed. For example as when he is talking to a certain group of people (Putnam, proctor, Rebecca nurse and Giles). In this scene of the play he is demanding that he receive plywood on top of his salary. This example shows how greedy Reverend Paris was greedy, he had a lot of money but it was never enough.\n\nChinaTown, directed by Roman Polanski, is a non-traditional hard-nosed detective film made in the 70's. The typical elements of character type are there; J.J. Gittes (a private detective in LA) played by Jack Nicholson is the central character, sharing the spotlight is Fay Dunaway playing the femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray. This film breaks all types of norms when compared to the hard-nosed detective films it is modeled after. The film is filled with allusions to the Big Sleep, especially taken from scenes of Marlowe and Vivian. Chinatown has formal elements indicative that it is going to be in the style of traditional Film Noir hardboiled detective, until you examine the characters' personalities\n\nSomeone who is abusing the power that is given to him or her defines corruption, however, the word in its self is more than a simple idea; it is an intricate network. Since people’s views about ethical and moral behavior affect the way corruption is examined, the word has a slightly different meaning to each person. Additionally, misconduct across various societies is viewed differently due to social and cultural borders. The criminal justice system has had many instances where corruption had affected the outcome of a case and has inserted itself into the legal process.\n\nIn The Big Sleep, Chandler portrays Marlowe as the knight in shining armor. This establishes a motif of the stained glass window in General Stern wood’s home in the first chapter of the novel and is an appropriate motif in dictating Marlowe’s knightly role in the novel. The stained glass that is reflected in the novel places Marlowe in the position of the knight as it shows a knight who strives to reach a woman to set her free. The fact that he stares at the glass makes him develop the need to offer assistance. This motif is suitable because it sets the stage for what is to take place in the aftermath when Marlowe rescues Carmen. Secondly, Chandler tries to connect Marlowe with the knightly personality from the beginning of the novel that he intended to name his detective the modern knight and a brave man fighting for General Sternwood. He takes the role of the servant to Sternwood’s lord and therefore, in the knightly terms, it is sufficient to say that Marlowe is striving to find justice. Moreover, he is dedicated to rendering his services in the line of duty with much loyalty and honor despite the sexual and financial temptations that come his way. Like the ancient knights, Marlowe has deeply invested in his personal code of chivalry that contain among others, the need to overcome the sexual temptation of whatever magnitude that comes his way. Lastly, as a representation of the modern-day knight, Marlowe comes out in the novel as a tough detective and a brave individual\n\nIn the book there is a lot of deception which is also prevalent in our world today. There is always going to be someone who is going to decieve another for their own benefit. This applies in our society because when you see a homeless person on the street or around town you immediately feel the need to give them money, but what if the homeless person isn’t who they say they are? Sometimes the person doesn’t have the right intentions and ends up spending money for the wrong things like liquor, instead of spending it on food or clothing. In the book we meet the king and the Duke, who are a couple of con artists that spend their time cheating people out of their money. They are always looking for ways to lie and use deception to their advantage.\n\nTulia, a small town in Texas of just under five-thousand people, is a frightening example of how the judicial system is governed solely by racism as well as one corrupt man’s word. In 1999, nearly ten percent of the town’s African American population was arrested in a single drug bust. Of the forty-six people arrested, thirty-eight were African-American, furthermore all were convicted. The remaining seven arrested where know to associate more with the black community than the white in Tulia as well. With the towns income levels averaging at or below the poverty line, most arrested could not afford to hire a good attorney that cared or had the time to care, left therefore with one provided by the state. Consequently, convictions were up to ninety years in jail for allegedly selling three and a half grams, more commonly known as an eight ball, of cocaine in drug-free zones. In was only on appeals, that the convictions where revoked on insubstantial evidence.\n\nThe novel “The Big Sleep” by Raymond Chandler was published in 1939 during the heart of the Great Depression. The novel is written in a very sinister, dark and kind of a gangster tone and carries much of the cynicism of 1930s America. The Big Sleep is a story of intrigue, corruption, delinquency and obliquity with a rather complex plot which can be very confusing. The main character in “the Big Sleep” is the private detective Philip Marlow who is very masculine man with values and a good moral. His strong moral is often evidenced throughout the novel. Marlowe is the only one in this complex world who cannot be corrupted because the other characters are all described as sleazy,\n\nCorruption has always been a danger to law enforcement, just as it has been a danger to all of mankind since the beginning of time. Since the very first police agency was formed in the 1800s, corruption has been widespread. The 19th century was an era in which politics played a very large role in police forces. Various political parties essentially had some police departments in their pockets, and as long as officers served to further those political parties’ agendas, the officers’ continued employment was guaranteed. Since politicians have not always been known for being straight-laced, one can easily see how corruption within police departments became prevalent. Since officers were not serving the people, but rather the political elite, their motives were constantly in question. It was not long before politicians began employing police officers to overlook and even protect their illicit activities. Through this practice, officers began to see the potential monetary and political benefits of allowing and participating in certain illegal actions. Even after the establishment of countermeasures such as police commissions, civil service exams, and legislative changes, corruption remained rampant. This corruption was perhaps best exemplified by none other than the actions of many officers within the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n“It has often been remarked that woman have a curious power of divining the characters of men”(75). This quotation from The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens reflects the opposite of what a typical Dickensian society is supposedly based upon. In this standard society, the plot would be based around the life of a dominant male. Although the title reflects a male name, the movement in the novel is directly related to the exploits of a particular character, Rosa Bud. Fondly called Rosebud by her peers, she is the apple of every man’s eye and the envy of every woman’s. She takes control in the plot not because she evidences forceful or masculine qualities, but because the powerful characters in Cloisterham, males, are all in love or\n\nMany people in the world today grow crazy and mad when surrounded by even the slightest bit of wealth and good fortune. Even a strong person who recognizes their priorities can still become corrupt with too much power. There is no better example of a person falling into the path of evil and corruption than in a novel written by John Steinbeck. In the novel The Pearl, by John Steinbeck, the author writes about a poor Indian man named Kino who becomes corrupt from the wealth of a magnificent pearl. Steinbeck uses the motifs of music, light and dark imagery, and values to develop the theme that good fortune, wealth, and prosperity steer even the most innocent of people towards a path of evil and corruption. The reader learns that one\n\nThese two combined techniques adds to the effect of how women from Tahiti are being over sexuilised and made out to be animalistic throughout the whole poem in order to give the reader an overall theme of exploitation of women. Marsh makes ironic use of positive connotations such as ‘delectably’ when describing the breasts of the Tahitian girls to heighten the erotic pleasure these men find in these young girls. However the most unnerving line is when she uses a simile in ripen like paw paw’ to add to the already unpleasant objectification of young women as sexual objects through the metaphor of fruit which are ‘best slightly raw” very tempting to them. Marsh uses this to show how sexually driven these european colonists such as gauguin where to these polynesian women. It also sets the ideas of how these women women were desirable from a young age and Gauguin states that for his reasoning behind sleeping with all of these women, as if it was not his fault."
