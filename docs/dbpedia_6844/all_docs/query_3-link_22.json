        "text": "Yeah, I decided I was done having integrity in the eyes of the mystery community…\n\nAnthony Berkeley is one the most widely-sung maestros of the Golden Age of Detection, whose output is well known for its meta-reflexive, bordering on post-modern, discussions on the genre. The novel perennially touted as Berekely’s unrivaled masterpiece is the eternal The Poisoned Chocolates Case.\n\nThe Poisoned Chocolates Case deals with a small group of theoretical criminologists known as “The Crime Club”, a circle of people who love discussing, ruminating, and speculating on all things criminal, hosted by none other than Berkeley’s beloved bastard Roger Sheringham. The very same beloved bastard has on this day brought to the club a proposition:\n\nThey will endeavor to solve to the club’s satisfaction the case of the murder of Mrs. Bendix, who received poisoned chocolates from her husband, who received the chocolates from a friend named Mr. Eustace Pennefather, who received the chocolates at his gentleman’s club from an anonymous sender pretending to represent the Mason’s chocolate company.\n\nNaturally, the police’s understanding of the case is that a demented opportunity killer wanted to kill Eustance for sick kicks, but upon running up against the problem that this means quite literally anyone in the world could be a viable suspect, realized they were entirely without a means to arrest a murderer.\n\nEnter, the Crime Club.\n\nOver the course of six days, the six members of the Crime Club will present the fruits of their investigations and theories pertaining to the truth of the Bendix case, with the understanding that if one of them manages to unearth the unsavory truth, the police will be immediately alerted.\n\nWith this, The Poisoned Chocolates Case has established its structure: broadly speaking, aside from a handful of “intermissions”, the entire novel is a protracted series of detective novel denouement scenes in which each of the amateur sleuths spend two chapters presenting their solutions, only for the following chapter or two to be dedicated to the other five members dismantling their cases piece-by-piece, often times pointing out fallacies and biases, sticking wedges into gaps in evidence, or revealing hitherto unknown, shocking information.\n\nUntil (hopefully?) the “truth” is revealed…\n\nWhat can said in The Poisoned Chocolate Case’s favor is already on record from all the praise that gets heaped onto this landmark novel from all angles. The prose is, as is apparently par for the course of Anthony Berkeley, extraordinarily well-written. There’s a dry but nonetheless salient wit running through every other paragraph. Better yet, the characters are crisply written and deftly portrayed. Golden Age mystery novels often struggle with the unique characteristics of their cast being drowned out by the similarly affected voice of 20th century British aristocracy being shared generously between every actor in the story. The Poisoned Chocolates Case, however, does very well at giving every character fully-realized personalities, presented so clearly through body language and voice that I feel like, were I more artistically inclined, if I drew a scene from the book in memory, one could easily pick out each character from nothing less than the ways they’re sitting in the chairs! The rivalry between the melodramatic thespian Mabel Fielder-Flemming and persnickety defense attorney Sir Charles Wildman, the affected, effeminate rapture of Mr. Morton Harrogate Bradley at his clubmates’ theories, the detached intellectualism of Alicia Dammers, and the self-effacing, pity-inducing humbleness of Ambrose Chitterwick shine through the dialogue as clear and as authentically as if I were watching a group of six real people bicker about murders and crimes and other such entertaining insignificances.\n\nThe structure, it can also be said, is conceptually quite fascinating. The idea of the entire novel essentially being one long, segmented denouement scene is quite unique, and an idea I’ve only seen explored again in the blog’s omnipresent Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series. Every central member of the cast has their moment to be in the spotlight, which enhances the already solid characterization. Furthermore, Anthony Berkeley does a very good pacing the plot within the confines of this structure, expertly making sure there are no anticlimaxes by arranging all of the false solutions in order of least ingenious to most ingenious. In a way, the members are constantly one-upping each other, with the explanations slowly expanding in complexity as new information is brought to light, and this assures that the plot never has moments where it feels, perhaps, a bit deflated after a heavy moment — you know a heavier one is coming soon!\n\nYes, indeed, in every sense from character to structure to prose, The Poisoned Chocolates Case is an engrossing and expertly composed novel..\n\nWere that I could end the review on that unambiguously positive note and avoid the condemnation that is sure to follow the publication of this post…\n\nThe Poisoned Chocolates Case, for all that can be said of it as a wonderfully contrived novel, unfortunately falls flat on its face in one critical — in my mind, the absolutely most critical — element: the novel’s themes on truth in detective fiction, the nature of the “artistic proof”, the ability of a person to assemble enough convincing evidence to satisfy an audience of even the most outrageously incorrect claims imaginable. In what “truth” can we believe if even these seemingly airtight cases are dismantled, disassembled, and their entrails proudly presented for all to see? If even the final, “correct”, solution is merely an implication in afterthought, a thick but entirely unconfirmed coat of suspicion and nothing more?\n\nA possibly intriguing question to tackle if it wasn’t answered with the same biases against which Berkeley charges his characters.\n\nThe most essential aspect upon which its themes of the transience of truth are erected is the premise that every single one of the false solutions should be thoroughly convincing bordering on the apparently airtight to the satisfaction of the mystery-reading public, only to be revealed to be riddled with fallacy, confusion, misapprehension, bias, oversight… That, Berkeley indirectly posits, would discredit the infallibility of the solutions brought forth by his fellow mystery writers’ favorite detectives.\n\nIn other words, the operative bit of information here is that the theories must be convincing, else the argument that “seemingly airtight cases can still be false” isn’t well-substantiated. Right?\n\n…Oh, dear, well… this certainly is awkward, now isn’t it..?\n\nThey really aren’t all that convincing.\n\nThe book’s themes on the fallibility of seemingly airtight solutions are themselves an ostensibly convincing argument with holes large enough to drive a Navy legion through them, and the holes nearly all come in the form of the book’s many false theories neither being convincing, nor approaching the level of logical that often goes into the better of mystery novels.\n\nWhether or not I agree with the premise is immaterial: this book does not make the case well.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that Berkeley himself was not being fair to his contemporaries. While the solutions start with the so-mundane-it’s-impossible-to-be-the-truth and slowly ramp up to the level of complexity that you’d believe in a relatively skilled second-stringer’s detective novel, the nature of the solutions are not the issue. From theory 1 to theory 6 — the supposedly correct one — no matter how convincing the nature of the solution was, the clues and reasoning were never convincingly airtight. Not a single one of the theories is erected on greater evidence with more conclusiveness than you’d expect to find from the unsubstantiated suspicions of the witness official policeman in any other mystery novel.\n\nFollowing, I will break down the issues with the six theories in as general, un-spoiling terms as I can mustered, but if you wish to avoid reading these specific criticisms, feel free to skip ahead to the section marked SPOILERS OVER.\n\nThe first and second theories’ faults should be plainly apparent to anyone engaging with the novel. Both solutions suffer from the very plainly obvious issue that the two amateurs don’t even pretend to have any evidence beyond parallels with an old case and very vague notions of possible motives and slightly suspicious behavior. It is immediately and flatly obvious that not a single ounce of logical rigor went into the detection or summation of these crimes, and in fact the book immediately acknowledges this issue. However, the fact it’s nearly impossible to miss for even the most cursory of readings does render the first two theories inert in terms of the novel’s critique of the mystery genre. In fact, I’d say it goes doubly for the fact that neither solution even approaches the level of rigor you’d expect from a proper mystery novel solution, so unless you’re reading awful mystery novels I don’t find these two theories very accurate, damning caricatures of the type of reasoning you’re liable to find therein.\n\nThe third and third-and-a-half theory suffers from what I often refer to as “generalized psychological clues”. Such arguments as “a public-schooler would never do this because they demand more direct confrontation”, “all men would discriminate between men and women when selecting murder methods”, so on and so forth. It isn’t just a single instance of it, however, and in fact features incredibly prominently in both the solutions presented here.\n\nThe natural issue with these clues, as is brought up by one character, is that they’re impossible to substantiate, and for that matter pretty short-sighted. Not a single group of people on the planet is a monolith. There’s no such thing as a definitively “Anglo-Saxon method to stab someone” or a “feminine manner of theft”; Anglo-Saxons and women are, believe it or not, deeply varied, complex, individual groups of people. To present any clue in the language of “All X would Y” or “No X would Y” is obnoxious, on top of unconvincing.\n\nI’ve criticized this style of cluing multiple times on the blog, once in my post detailing my personal 10 rules for writing detective fiction and quite frequently in my reviews of James Yaffe’s Mom short stories, so I am aware this sort of thing occurs quite often. Unlike the first two theories, I am unable to claim this is an unfair criticism to bring up against a certain class of mystery novels.\n\nOnly, however, the irony here is that the idea of “psychological impossibilities” is NOT being criticized as unsubstantiated, speculating nonsense. One character expresses disdain, and is immediately shot down by the rest of the Crime Club. In fact, quite a few characters are vindicated in their “general psychology” being absolutely, 100% correct!\n\nThe hole that is poked in this man’s theories isn’t that the “All X would Y” psychology is wildly speculating on baseless grounds, but rather that he simply made the wrong over-arching, generalized, unsubstantiated conclusions, and the characters who follow actually made the correct over-arching, generalized, unsubstantiated conclusions.\n\nSo, ironically, the one point in the novel I felt could’ve been a worthwhile criticism of Berkeley’s contemporaries, he fails to follow-up on meaningfully.\n\nThe fourth theory is the closest approaching convincing. While the character still induces quite a lot of details from, again, overly generalized psychology, they do substantiate quite a lot of their conclusions by focusing on the specific psychology of the characters and finding seemingly credible eyewitness testimony. However, the information discrediting the theory is a bit of a cheat, but nonetheless a very funny one that criticizes amateur detection in a very human, natural way.\n\nThe fifth theory is quite complex and ingenious (but also, I feel, obvious for the seasoned armchair sleuth) compared to the previous ones, but has quite a lot of the same obvious issues as the earlier theories. The circumstantial evidence and the logic that follows have very major, easily-seen alternative explanations. The logical rigor displayed here feels like the sort of thing you’d see in the early pages of a detective novel, when the official police officers give their almost-barely-convincing cases that the detective can quite easily explain away.\n\nThe final theory is nearly the worst of the lot. The amateur claims to have assembled the “correct” pieces of everyone’s theories into one , ultimate, “true” solution, but the methodology by which he achieved this is invisible to the reader, and quite a lot of what he selected as “given truths” and “conclusively proven facts” I certainly disagree with being particularly convincing explanations… Quite a few of the elements he selected fall into the very same holes I’ve already outlined, and therefore make his chimeric solution come off as arbitrary.\n\nSPOILERS OVER\n\nThe recurrent throughline here, though, is not only are the solutions not convincing– an essential point for the novel to establish for its themes of “even seemingly conclusive arguments can be easily disproven” — the solutions aren’t even convincing recreations of Golden Age mystery denouements — also an essential point on which the novel needs to succeed to complete its critique of the genre.\n\nThese solutions are not just unconvincing, they’re so artificially and transparently unconvincing that it wraps around into reflecting poorly on Berkeley’s fairness towards the works he critiques. Whatever case you want to make about mystery novels and their solutions and the nature of the puzzle and the infallibility or otherwise of the truth, the fact remains that the best of the works do hold themselves to a certain standard of at least attempted logical rigor. Mere circumstantial evidence is rarely enough to Christie or Queen or Carr; counter-theories, possible alternative explanations, are considered, explored, and to a certain level of satisfaction discredited on usually solid-enough grounds, even if not to the degree of 100% certain conclusiveness. The novels attempt to bring forth evidence — actual evidence — and flagrant guesswork is often, ideally, avoided.\n\nIn order to make a critique of the genre, Berkeley, just like his characters, cheated. He twisted tropes to fit his case, and presented flaws that don’t truly exist, and to a major degree avoided acknowledging a lot of the work authors go to in order to avoid just the very same pitfalls outlined in The Poisoned Chocolates Case. I will not comment on whether or not I agree with the premise of the novel, but merely that the method by which it goes about establishing it is slanted, skewed, and biased in the extreme, often requiring outright unflattering, dishonest depictions of the work done by authors of the genre.\n\nIn short? I do not agree with the popular view that The Poisoned Chocolates Case is either a brilliant or even a damning critique of the genre at large. While it is a brilliantly written novel, the (anti-)mystery plot at the heart of it fails on the grounds of being so preoccupied depicting the perceived negatives in the genre that it winds up dragging down the rest of the work with it. The false solutions are unconvincing, and ultimately, unfortunately, fail to bring its themes on the transience of truth to fruition. As much as I enjoyed the reading of this novel, I did not walk away holding it in very high esteem as a post-modern take on the genre. It is a seemingly-convincing argument, filled with holes and bias — just like the ones it wished to write for its characters.\n\nIt would be unfair to call the video game franchise Ace Attorney a “titan” of Japanese mystery pop-culture, but a persistent and noteworthy influence, it certainly is. Often paired with the manga (comic book) series Detective Conan and fellow mystery video game Danganronpa, it isn’t uncommon to find leaders of Japanese detective writing who are fans of at least one of these series, or to name them influences on their career. Not the least that there are multiple examples of mystery novels that clearly aim to emulate Ace Attorney‘s plotting style, along with no small number of inspired Ace Attorney-esque video games as well, but also that many youths find their first exposure to classical fairplay detection through these thrilling courtroom adventure video games.\n\nI also happen to be one such youth.\n\nIt’s been an open secret on this blog that Ace Attorney is the series that propelled me into the world of Golden Age mystery fiction and continues to be, to this day, my favorite mystery series of all time in any medium. I first covered the franchise on an under-performing review of the first game of the series, lamented about the lack of attention it gets in my post about animated mysteries in Japan, mentioned the series yet again in my review of Masahiro Imamura’s Death Among the Undead, and then one case got represented on my list of my 15 favorite impossible crimes and 6 cases on my list of 30 more favorite mysteries of all time, before finally my, as friend and fellow blogger Nick Fuller of The Grandest Game in the World lightly put it, enthusiasm for Ace Attorney culminated in The Comprehensive Guide to Ace Attorney for Video Game-Averse Mystery-Reading Persons (+ other mystery games to try!), a post in which I try to make the series as accessible as possible for people who enjoy mysteries but are wary of video games, as well as breaking down the creator’s inspiration from famous classical mystery writers, everyone from Perry Mason to Ellery Queen.\n\nWith that, I thought I’d be able to wash my hands of Ace Attorney as far as this blog is concerned. Writing what is literally the comprehensive overview and retrospective on the series seemed to be a fitting cap on my insistence for this random mystery video game. I’ve talked about every case of every game, broken down what the series is, why you should play it, how you can play it, and basically done everything short of buying every reader of this blog a copy of the game. As far as mystery fans care, I’ve touched upon every meaningful part of the official Ace Attorney franchise.\n\n…Or so I had believed…\n\nRecently I’ve begun to hear from certain trustworthy sources, knowledgeable fans of both Golden Age mysteries and Ace Attorney, that quite a bit of untapped, genuine mystery media exists in the franchise of which I was somehow terribly unaware. And not only does it exist, it’s also apparently… quite good!\n\nAs the resident Ace Attorney superfan, I felt embarrassed at how negligent I was in covering all of the bases of this series I claim to love so much. Not only were there two novels called Turnabout Airline and Turnabout Idol, translations of which I didn’t even know existed, but there were also two promotional manga series, simply titled Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth (after their respective game entries), released and officially localized into English. The novels are themselves one full case each, and then the Phoenix Wright manga contains seven, while the Miles Edgeworth manga contains eight. In other words, there are 17 further official cases of Ace Attorney mystery writing which I simply totally missed while writing my “comprehensive” guide — that’s almost as good as missing four of the games themselves! Knowing that most of them are supposed to be quite good, too, I decided I had to rectify this oversight immediately, starting with the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney manga series…\n\nWhen Ace Attorney was first created, the series started as a trilogy of games for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance, and released exclusively in Japan! The series was thought to be finished at that point, but with the announcement of a fourth game — Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney — and the remakes of the original three games for the Nintendo DS, all of which would be released in English for American audiences as well, Capcom decided to do a spontaneous promotional campaign in order to drum up excitement for Ace Attorney both in Japan and overseas. Kuroda Kenji was commissioned to write the scenarios for 7 all-new, totally original mysteries for Ace Attorney, which would be compiled into a short 5-book run of comics, in order to give a new audience a taste of Ace Attorney’s mystery plotting prior to its proper release in the interest of enticing fans to buy the four upcoming games.\n\nAlthough the comics are based on the characters and premise of the video games, the serialized stories would require absolutely zero foreknowledge of the original material to understand, making them suitable both for newcomers and veterans alike. Nothing needs to be known about Ace Attorney besides the context that it stars Phoenix Wright, a somewhat hapless rookie defense attorney who uses on-the-spot bluffing to point out logical flaws in witness testimony that falsely implicates his (innocent) client of a murder! By unraveling the seemingly airtight case presented by the prosecutor through Ellery Queen-esque chains of deductions, Phoenix Wright not only proves his clients innocent of wrongdoing, but always manages to find the true perpetrator in the process.\n\nThe manga series features characters from the first three games of the series, but otherwise stoutly avoids revealing any information that would meaningfully spoil the gameplay or mystery-solving experience of the games. In fact, the comics exist in something of a floating timeline, meaning that their location in the canon of Ace Attorney is particularly ambiguous.\n\nIn other words, you readers who never played Ace Attorney, have no fear! You are free to jump into this series as you please! Furthermore, this manga, like most of the mystery genre, is majorly episodic. You could dip in and out into any of the self-contained mysteries as you please and miss out on very little and run the risk of being spoiled on nothing.\n\nEach case is an attempt to compress into short story form the Ace Attorney formula of having a single person be accused of a crime in which the circumstances make it so only they could be guilty, finding contradictions in the testimony of witnesses hell-bent on seeing your client go to jail, and through Ellery Queen-esque chains of deductions finally proving their innocence and discovering the true killer, all while arguing against a prosecutor who believes with all their heart that your client is guilty.\n\nHow successful the comics are at adapting the formula is variable between stories, however. A few of the cases really struggle with a plot that doesn’t quite suit the format being pigeon-holed into a structure they don’t really fit. Case 2, titled “Turnabout Gallows”, epitomizes this entirely, with a trial segment that barely involves physical evidence and instead involves arguing about dubious psychology (something the games never do). Add to this a murder involving a “Man-Spider” who crawls on ceilings and plays Saw-like games with his victim, and you get a plot befitting Detective Conan or The Kindaichi Case Files much before Ace Attorney.\n\nBut then some cases truly do feel like what an Ace Attorney short story would and should feel like. Capturing not only the essence of the games’ style, but also perfectly mimicking very small, but nonetheless important, nuances of their approach to plotting and cluing. Clues recontextualizing themselves as they’re brought back to mean different things two, three, four times, killers being caught on very natural slips of the tongue, and even Phoenix being cocky, bluffing with a seemingly airtight piece of evidence that appears to prove the client’s innocence, only for the prosecutor to point out that there’s a very natural explanation that Phoenix merely overlooked which destroys his entire argument in one fell swoop. This strength of cluing, in which one minor piece of information never means exactly what it appears, and in fact represents three totally different facts altogether, clues and evidence are twisted and turned on their head, and every hint is doing double-time at all times is in the best of these stories very impressively carried over from the games to the manga, not the least impressive because the manga was written by a different person and, even more so, the cases are probably about 1/10 the length of an average case from the game.\n\nBut where consistency is lacking in the manga’s success at adapting the Ace Attorney formula, it more than makes up for it with the consistency of the mystery plots. Of the five cases I’ll be discussing today, there is only one which is not all of clever, entirely unique, and entirely fairly clued. These stories are, in fact, so well-clued and plotted, that one might find them on the whole a little easy to figure out — scrupulously fairplay to a fault, in fact. But for that fault, they’re not obvious for a lack of creativity or cleverness, because those are qualities these mysteries have in spades. Amusing and unique settings — a murder in a Mansion of Spiders, or a girl possessed by a Death God to commit murder in a locked-room, or “the world’s smallest locked-room mystery” — lend themselves to equally amusing and unique explanations. The quality of mystery writing here really shows off the strength of short-form mystery plotting, and rivals in places even some of the best of the more eminent Detective Conan, Kindaichi Case Files, and Detective School Q manga series.\n\nI really do feel comfortable calling Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney something of a hidden masterpiece of shin-honkaku mysteries and mystery manga, managing to not only imitate the strengths of Takumi Shuu’s plotting style and twisty evidence-placement, but also to infuse into it Kuroda Kenji’s own highly imaginative settings and solutions. Add to all this being perhaps the most truly scrupulously fairplay mystery I’ve seen in the manga-sphere, and, in short, any mystery fan should be pleased to read this exceptional little piece of Japanese mysteries.\n\nA break-down of the individual cases would be essential, but it’s worth noting that as of the time of writing this, I only have access to five of the seven stories available in the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney manga. Therefore, this review will only be part 1 of 2, and the remaining two stories will be reviewed once they’re available to me…\n\nCase 1 – Turnabout of the Wind sees Phoenix’s hapless childhood friend Larry Butz be accused of murdering Bright Bonds, the ex-boyfriend of Belle Windsor, his new girlfriend. The two had been dating for a long time, but Belle soon found out Bright was married and dumped him on the spot. Since then, Bright had continued to harass Belle, begging her to come back to him. Angered by this, Larry leaves Bright a threatening voice mail… a fact which, when combined with his fingerprints being found on the murder weapon, makes him a prime suspect for the prosecution. Just as he’s done a few times before, Phoenix defends Larry of these false accusations!\n\nEvery game in the series has a bit of a formula with how they handle their first cases. Each first case takes place over only a single day, doesn’t feature an investigation, and usually features only one witness who is, usually, the true killer. The manga stays true to this formula, and so is a bit simplistic compared to the rest of the series, but none the worse for it! It isn’t hard to figure out the killer, or how they committed the crime, but as always Ace Attorney is as much about the “how does Phoenix figure it out?” as anything else, and this aspect of the case is wonderful. Just like Ace Attorney proper, there’s this aspect of clues and hints coming back over and over again, being used in different contexts and taking on different meanings. Quite a few of the clues and reasoning here are brilliant, besides! Ace Attorney trial segments are essentially protracted denouement scenes, so the mystery writing is very engaging, as you’re asked to walk through the reasoning with Phoenix as he does it in court, step-by-step — there’s even a challenge to the reader!\n\nThat all being said, the way the formula is changed for the manga is a bit hard to get used to, since it doesn’t involve finding contradictions in testimony so much as the testimony is just a source of information as Phoenix and the prosecutor argue with each other directly. The main issue with this case is that the two begin arguing before the case is even fully established so it’s not even fully clear why the prosecutor thinks Larry is guilty until the case is more than half over, and then by that point Phoenix is already confronting the real killer, making it a bit of an awkwardly paced case. That’s a minor gripe, though, because this is still a wonderful little mystery story that recalls, like the best of Ace Attorney, “Ellery Queen but in court”, and it’s a promising sampler of the future cases!\n\nCase 2 – Turnabout Gallows sees Phoenix Wright summoned by Robin Wolfe, the CEO of a prominent tech company. An employee of Wolfe’s, Eddie Johnson, has recently taken his own life by leaping from the top of a wall, but Wolfe is irrationally paranoid that he’ll be accused of somehow murdering Johnson. In anticipation of that, the CEO decided to enlist the aid of defense attorney Phoenix Wright to clear him of any suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\nUnfortunately for Wolfe, though, Phoenix and his assistant Maya Fey discover that Robin Wolfe has a mentally disturbed younger brother named Bobby, towards whom he is deeply abusive. Bobby is a reclusive spider fanatic who is condemned to a windowless building on the Wolfe property called “The Spider Manor”. When Phoenix then finds that the building is not only filled to the roof with books on spiders and cages containing the very same arachnids, but also equipped with a remote controlled torture-chair that holds a captive person’s entire body, he begins to believe their prospective client really did murder his employee. The arachnophobic Eddie Johnson could be bound and held captive in the Spider Manor, until he’s so emotionally disturbed he accidentally kills himself trying to escape…\n\nBut before Phoenix and Maya can reject Robin Wolfe’s requests for defense, the man suddenly vanishes… Before long, the man’s entire family is summoned together in front of an intercom to talk to him. He says that he’s being held captive in the Spider Manor, and that he’s being harassed by a Man-Spider who can walk on the ceilings! Just as everyone decides to go save Robin, however, the Spider Manor bursts into flames…\n\nAnd in the charred rubble of the building, Robin Wolfe is found, murdered, having been beat over the head! And when the murder occurred, everyone was together and in clear sight of each other… Everyone, that is, except for Bobby Wolfe, Robin’s abused younger brother. Can Phoenix solve this bizarre case of a man walking on the ceiling and airtight alibis in order to prove Robin Wolfe’s innocence of the murder!?\n\nThis case is by far and large the least faithful adaptation of the Ace Attorney style in the manga. Psychological torture chambers, mental disability, apparent spider-demons who challenges his victim a Saw-like game for survival… The overall darker tone and supernatural overtones (besides the Ghost-summoning that exists in Ace Attorney) recall Detective Conan and Kindaichi Case Files long before it even begins to recall Ace Attorney. Add to that the fact that the first half of the trial is concerned with debates on psychology and motive (something Ace Attorney rarely focuses so much on, with a preference for rigorous physical cluing), and you’ve got yourself a mystery story that really does not recall the source material even in the slightest.\n\n…But it’s none the worse off for it, because “Turnabout Gallows” really is spectacular! The trick behind the alibi is perhaps a little easy to piece together, because the story audaciously shows you a little too much of the murder occurring in real time, but it’s still very original, ambitious, and massive-in-scale, not unlike something that might be dreamt up by the mind of Soji Shimada.\n\nAnd where the story misses the Ace Attorney stylization, it more than makes up for it with the standard of cluing and the tendency to wrap clues and off-handed remarks back around multiple times to take on different meanings. As you can tell from the titles, “Turnabout” is a theme of Ace Attorney; the defense turning around a seemingly hopeless case, evidence being turned around and taking on new meanings… and the trick of “Turnabout Gallows” applies the theme of “turnabout” in a very, very literal way, the first of three cases that take the concept of “turnabout” and apply it, entirely literally and entirely at face value, to their mystery plots. There’s one particular clue that is emblematic of “turnabout” in this way, too, that really is brilliant; it turns on entirely specialistic knowledge, but Kuroda’s crafty plotting allows the reader to see its significance without ever once directly providing the reader with the specialistic knowledge in one of the most utterly ingenious and daring visual clues of the mystery genre!\n\n“Turnabout Gallows” falters in being a little too ambitious in showing the commission of the murder to the audience in such a way that almost entirely spoils the trick, and not being a very faithful take on Ace Attorney as a mystery series. But to its benefit it has a daring and original alibi trick that makes great use of its congruous elements brilliantly, some phenomenal cluing, and one of the series’ best takes on the theme of “turnabout”. A smidge weaker than stories to come, but nonetheless great little mystery, this!\n\nIn Case 3 – Turnabout Showtime, Phoenix treats Maya to a day out at SparkleLand so they can watch the amusement park’s mascot-themed stage show! However, during the show, an actor stumbles onto stage and collapses, blood flowing from within his costume!\n\nPhoenix, Maya, the fellow actors, and the announcer — a young girl named Julie Henson — drag the actor, still in his costume, back stage, and undress him… only to find him stabbed through the chest! However, due to the circumstances in which he was stabbed, his death is soon revealed to be “the world’s smallest locked-room mystery”…\n\nWhen he was stabbed, the victim, Flip Chambers, was inside of a full-body costume. The costume wasn’t damaged, meaning Flip had to be removed from the costume before being stabbed and returned to the costume! The only way to remove someone from the costume is through a zipper on the back, which can only be reached by a second person; the costumes cannot be removed by the person wearing them! However, the only person at the crime scene who is capable of removing costumes was Julie Henson, the only member of the cast who wasn’t also wearing a costume that severely restricted her dexterity!\n\nIn order to prove Julie innocent of this murder, Phoenix Wright must contend with the world’s smallest locked-room mystery… a “locked-costume mystery”!\n\nThe best case in the manga, and it isn’t even close! Not only is “Turnabout Showtime” just a great, original, little locked-room mystery (the smallest in the world!), it’s also pure, vintage Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney cases are on average four to six hours long, whereas this story is a single less-than-100-page manga chapter, and yet despite that this case manages to represent everything that makes Ace Attorney what it is. It is, plain and simple, everything an Ace Attorney short story would and should be.\n\nMany of the defining elements of Ace Attorney‘s plotting and cluing are on full-display in this fantastic story. Just like in the games, the logical rigidity of the courtrooms is weaponized against Phoenix as he finds evidence he believes effortlessly proves Julie’s innocence, only for the prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, to point out a simple, entirely reasonable oversight that totally flips Phoenix’s argument on its head. Evidence seems to be one thing and is later flipped around to mean something else entirely, at one moment seeming to prove someone’s guilt and at the next proving them innocent, at one moment being critical to Phoenix’s case and at the next being disastrous to it! Off-handed remarks that appear to mean nothing in reality mean everything. The battle of wits between two equal forces trying to prove diametrically opposite cases and the way this causes evidence to be twisted, manipulated, misshaped, rearranged, and recontextualized. It’s all here, crammed tightly but elegantly into this short but crafty mystery tale.\n\nAdd to all that a very clever and original locked-room mystery set-up with an equally clever and original explanation — the second impossibility in which the theme of “turnabout” is taken entirely at face value — and you have a charming mystery short story you can take little fault with.\n\n“Turnabout Showtime” is the only case in the manga I failed to figure out before the ending, and the surprise was more than earned by this well-plotted little gem of Japanese murder mysteries. The whole manga itself is an overlooked masterpiece of Japanese mystery plotting, but this is the story that really elevates it to that level, as it stands as one of my favorite short-form mysteries of all time.\n\nIf you read only one case from this manga, I recommend this one! It is emblematic of everything Ace Attorney (albeit in abridged form), and manages to stand on its own two feet as a great and unique impossible crime at that!\n\nCase 4 – “Turnabout Prophecy” takes Phoenix and Maya to a fortune-teller’s court — a group of fortune tellers set up in the top floor of a department store — where a young girl named Russi Clover is told she’ll be possessed by a demon God from Venus and commit murder. So, when a murder happens in the locked-and-sealed audience chamber of Oracle Hecate, and Russi is the only one in the room with the victim, she immediately breaks down and confesses to the crime, saying she was taken over by the Venutian God to commit murder!\n\nPhoenix, however, doesn’t believe that Russi could commit this crime; and if you rule out demonic possession, that means she can only be innocent! But, as always, Phoenix is forced to compete with a situation in which his client is the only possible culprit in order to prove their innocence…\n\nLike “Turnabout Storyteller”, “Turnabout Prophecy” is a perfect exemplar of what an Ace Attorney short story really should be — perhaps an even more perfect one than the previous case! Everything is there, including Phoenix being overly-cocky over an ace up his sleeve only to find out a perfectly reasonable explanation exists to destroy his argument, the solution being built up from a long-series of small contradictions in Ellery Queen Chain of Deduction fashion, brilliantly re-purposed clues, and a great back-and-forth logical tug-o-war between the prosecution and defense — all of it. Add to that a more elegant explanation for why the defendant is the suspect, and you’re given the most perfectly executed abridging of the Ace Attorney formula the manga has to offer.\n\nHowever, where this case fails is in its pretty trivially easy locked-room mystery. The seasoned armchair sleuth should be able to figure out the solution to the locked-room mystery very easily. However, for how easy the story is to figure out, it isn’t a result of the story being uninspired; no, the story really is quite clever and original, only it suffers for over-tipping its hand much like the earlier “Turnabout Gallows”, thanks to the Christianna Brand-ian touch of the solution being based on a half-correct explanation that’s written off over the course of the story.\n\nHowever, just like the first case, “Turnabout of the Wind”, it’s worth keeping in mind that Ace Attorney is just as much about the process of how the culprit is discovered in a courtroom battle as it is about who- and howdunit. The trial segment is brilliantly plotted, with many great contradictions, surprising reversals, and spectacular clues; even if you’ve seen the solution coming from a mile away, no other case in the manga makes the process of arriving at the truth as engaging as this case anyways.\n\nAnd, yet again, “turnabout”, in the literal sense, is utilized wonderfully here…\n\nIt loses points for being easy to figure out, but the courtroom battle on display here is the best of the manga so far. This is another perfect adaptation of Ace Attorney with all of the same logical rigidity and transient clues-of-a-million-shapes you’ve come to expect! Fantastic, fun, and clever!\n\nCase 5 – Turnabout from Heaven involves a young woman with contradictory memories about the ghost of her mother appearing to her and promising to kill her abusive father. Naturally, the girl is brought to court and accused of the crime, and although the court flatly rejects the possibility of her mother’s ghost being the culprit, the young woman has proof! When she was a child, her mom promised to give her her necklace on her eighteenth birthday, and the day after the murder… the promised necklace was left on her pillow!\n\nPhoenix doesn’t believe the gentle young girl would commit the murder, and so, as always, he gets to work proving her innocence in impossible circumstances.\n\nWhile all the other cases in the manga are whodunits and impossible crimes, this minimalist case is interesting in that the culprit confesses nearly immediately, but argues that the crime was an accident, turning this into a whydunit in which the goal is to prove motive. It’s not hard to spot the answer, since it’s very typical kidnapping mystery fare, but there’s a contradiction and line of reasoning in this case that’s super brilliant and the Ace Attorney format is actually used really well here despite the story being very different from anything you’d see in the games, with Edgeworth constantly trying to prove that the killer’s confession is false in order to secure a guilty verdict for the defendant. The clues and reasoning here are quite good! However, you can fault the story for being a little simplistic, and the happy ending being very forcibly engineered (even if still quite clever from a mystery-plotting perspective…)\n\nA more pressing criticism to levy against this case, though, is the fact the court flatly rejects the existence of ghosts, even though all of these characters have seen actual, honest-to-God ghosts in the courtroom on multiple occasions. This is an inconsistency the series refuses to acknowledge, but ghosts empirically exist in the Ace Attorney universe and have appeared in court through spirit mediums’ bodies on more than one instance. In the sixth game in the series, you discover a country exists where the memories of the murder are manifested through the victim’s spirit as a basis for its entire judicial system; it is very silly that the games still insist on making skeptics of people who have seen undeniable supernatural phenomena with their own two eyes.\n\n….You’re saying that that’s not THAT pressing an issue, are you? Well, it’s annoying to me….\n\nAce Attorney is already my favorite mystery series of all time, but I’ll admit I came into this spin-off series with more than just slightly low expectations. I expected to be greeted with lazy, half-baked regurgitations of series tropes, lame and uninspired mystery plots, and generally be annoyed with misunderstandings and mistakes here, there, and everywhere.\n\nInstead, I was met with a surprising gem, not only of Ace Attorney-onia but also of mystery plotting in general. Nearly all of the cases perfectly capture the essence, style, plotting, cluing, and structure of Ace Attorney — the turnabout of evidence at multiple critical junctures of the trial to mean different things at different points, the contradictions and chains of deductions, the logically rigorous battles of wits — while also just producing consistently clever, and entirely original mystery plots. While many of the stories can be faulted for being easy to solve, their originality and creativity aren’t hindered by this; not the least because the process of discovering the truth is always littered with brilliant clues, reasoning, and reversals through the series’s chronically engaging courtroom battles.\n\nAce Attorney the manga is an undeservedly overlooked gem of the series and mystery plotting at large. Fans of mysteries who are unacquainted with Ace Attorney will still find plenty to love in this fabulous little collection of mystery shorts. In short, wow!\n\nThe last two cases of the manga are currently unavailable to me but if this is the standard one can expect, I eagerly look forward to finishing the series and reviewing them for your pleasure!\n\nTo wrap things up, a ranking of the cases….\n\nCase 3 – Turnabout Showtime\n\nCase 4 – Turnabout Prophesy\n\nCase 2 – Turnabout Gallows\n\nCase 1 – Turnabout of the Wind\n\nCase 5 – Turnabout from Heaven\n\nMysteries and thrillers have had such a wedge driven between them that for the two to overlap is often a spectacle worth noting as rare exceptions, such as the spectacular “puzzle boxes” of film director Christopher Nolan (Inception, Interstellar). While the western incarnations of these exceptions are often highly well-documented in our little blogging niche of the internet, those crossovers between purified detective stories and thriller from Japan are significantly less publicized than their straightforward honkaku (“authentic”) detective story counterparts.\n\nAnd so, cribbing the title of this post from Jim Noy’s “FIVE TO TRY” posts over at his spectacular blog, The Invisible Event, I intend to offer to western fans of Golden Age mysteries and detection five Japanese thrillers which appeal even to our specific sensibilities! These aren’t just any old “mystery-thrillers” or “thriller-mysteries” or whatever other permutation of genre names you want to think of; these are thrillers which contain a style and nature of plotting which I believe should specifically appeal to fans of the Golden Age standard and method of mystery plotting!\n\nSo, below are my five picks for Japanese thrillers which I believe even those in our little nook of the internet can enjoy!\n\nDeath Note\n\nThe quintessential Japanese mystery-thriller, Death Note is predominantly a manga series about Light Yagami, a high-school student who discovers a supernatural notebook called “The Death Note”, writing in which allows Light Yagami to kill any person as long as he knows both the real name and face of that person. Now going by the alias of “Kira” (Killer) ascribed to him by the media, Light Yagami is tracked down by a master detective who goes by the enigmatic name of “L”.\n\nDeath Note is the very first entry that came to my mind when I decided to compile a list of thrillers which I believe even English-speaking authentic mystery fans could read and enjoy. The series is possibly the most well-known “cat-and-mouse” thriller from Japan to English-speakers, with the story following both the perspectives of the criminal Light and the detective L in equal measure.\n\nDespite its supernatural premise, the eponymous Death Note is guided by a set of strict, unbendable rules which dictate how it can and cannot be used, making it a verifiable example of the hybrid mystery. Furthermore, while L can sometimes resort to “moon logic” (wildly convoluted or counterintuitive reasoning), typically his reasoning is based on information the audience is also privy too. And since Light/Kira’s responses are equally guided by reasoning based on information known to the audience, it can be said that despite being labeled a “supernatural thriller”, Death Note is as much a fairplay detective story as any other inverted mystery, in which we’re equally capable of reasoning along with both sides of the crime: commission and detection.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like inverted mysteries and capers; don’t mind supernatural elements in their mysteries; enjoy following the psychology of the villain.\n\nLIAR GAME\n\nBilled by Wikipedia as a “psychological thriller”, LIAR GAME is a multi-media franchise which began with a manga (Japanese comic book) about Nao Kanzaki, a naive college student who is suddenly sent 100 million yen (roughly $760,000 USD) and instructed that is now a competitor in the Liar Game Tournament, a multi-stage competition in which participants are encouraged to cheat, betray each other, and lie in order to get their hands on each other’s money!\n\n…A problem, indeed, for the “foolishly honest” Nao Kanzaki.\n\nIn this tournament, the competition is split into various stages in which contestants play games of wits to overcome their opponents and win their money. For instance, the very first game is a game called “Minority Rule”, in which contestants are asked to answer yes/no questions. If your answer is the minority, you move on to the next round of the game, but if your answer is the majority you are immediately disqualified… Of course, however, as players are permitted to lie, there are three questions you must ask yourself every round: (1.) how many of my competitors does this question apply to, (2.) how many of my competitors know the answer to question 1, and therefore (3.) how likely are the competitors to lie, and is it beneficial to me to answer correctly or lie?\n\nAs Nao Kanzaki moves through the various stages of this tournament, instead of keeping the money for herself, she begins to use the earnings to buy her contestants out of their debt and, hopefully, slowly dismantle the Liar Game Tournament Organization from within the game itself…\n\nLIAR GAME is almost certainly the closest thing you’re going to get to “fairplay mystery plotting” in something which is, frankly, not even a “mystery” at all. Rather than dealing with murders or thefts, in LIAR GAME the puzzle is always “how can Nao mathematically maximize or even guarantee her chances at winning each game?” Information is never hidden from the audience, and with a close enough understanding of the rules, the player is constantly in possession of all the details they need to see Nao’s path to likely or certain victory! In every game, outcomes can be forced, rules can be cleverly exploited, and nothing is ever left entirely up to chance or victory. A stage for many complex math puzzles and logic problems, LIAR GAME is almost like a mystery story in which you follow a protagonist who has to solve, not crimes, but purified riddles! Something like The Hunger Games, but with competitive puzzle solving.\n\nThis genre of story is not uncommon in manga, often called “gambling” or “game” stories, but very few few manage to be as good as LIAR GAME, which is as complex, satisfying, and fair as any crime story!\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like riddles, logic problems, and math puzzles; are interested in game philosophy, game theory, and logic theory, especially as it applies to gambling; enjoy heavily rule-dictated conflicts.\n\nRaging Loop\n\n“Werewolf” is a social deduction board game in which players are randomly assigned roles like “Townsperson” or “Werewolf”. Every round of the game is separated into two stages: nighttime, in which the players assigned the role “Werewolf” secretly select one person to kill (remove from the game), and daytime, during which players debate about who they believe the Werewolves are, vote them out, and then kill them.\n\nHowever, imagine if instead of a board game, these rules dictated the real murders and deaths of real people in a cursed mountain village out in rural Japan. Then, you’d have Raging Loop.\n\nIn the “visual novel” (a video game with lots of text that mostly only exists to tell a story) Raging Loop, Haruaki Fusaishi bikes into the mountains with no idea of a destination. However, during his trip he gets stranded in a remote mountain village which, he discovers, has been the battlegrounds for a war between the God of the Mountain and the demons of Yomi (Hell)…\n\nIn order to keep the battle fair, rules have been established: at the start of the “war”, a random number of villagers are killed and replaced with Werewolves who take on all of the traits of the person they’re replacing! Every night these Werewolves are allowed to kill one person of their choosing, and every day the survivors debate amongst themselves who they believe are the Werewolves. And, if they believe they’ve found an impostor, they vote, and the accused person is hung by the cliffside… If all the Werewolves are exorcised, the Mountain wins, but if the Werewolves ever outnumber the surviving humans, the survivors are murdered and the mountain is overcome by the Yomibito…\n\nWhile competing in this bizarre murder game, Haruaki is murdered and discovers he has the ability to go back in time and make difference decisions by dying. Using this ability, Haruaki tries to stop the deaths. But, as he continues to change things in the village, the “game” begins to take on different, progressively complicated permutations, putting Haruaki more and more at risk of being unable to overcome this bizarre curse…\n\nRaging Loop‘s first three chapters are very interesting exercises in mystery-writing in which you, the player, read about the characters participating in a murder game following specific rules. While early on the characters are comically awful at Werewolf, which might be frustrating to real-life veterans of the game, it helps ease newcomers into understanding the concept, and as the games progress and more and more characters compete in the game, the games begin to get more creative and more deceptive!\n\nBecause the murders are based on the real rules of a real-life “mystery game” which are easy and intuitive to understand and we have access to all the same information as the characters, despite being easy to sum the game up as a psychological horror game, it also means we have the ability to reason along with the players as they play the game. It’s easy to intuit what the characters will do (to the same degree as it’s possible to do it in the real-life party game), and it’s possible to reason about who is and isn’t the Werewolf on the same level as the characters within the narrative. Using a heavily rules-dictated conflict makes this a fantastic thriller game for fans of mystery fiction, as it hits a lot of the same notes, focusing on tight strategizing and clever logic required for the characters to survive!\n\nWhile the chapters following the multiple “games” aren’t nearly as interesting, the first 20 or so hours of the game are fantastically fun mystery-thriller fare! Check out my friend “Bad Player”‘s review here.\n\nI recommend this to people who: like social deduction party games; are interested in psychological horror; enjoy conflicts in which the players are forced to apply creative strategic thinking in order to survive/come out on top.\n\nParanormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo\n\nParanormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, but what I can say is that it’s a supernatural horror-mystery puzzle game in which the player is tasked with investigating the truth behind seven curses befalling seven groups of people…\n\nThe game’s narrative is incredibly dense and complex, and while it’s the furthest thing from a traditional detective story on this list, it is still a satisfyingly complicated mystery tale involving the interplay between a giant collection of brain-teasing plot threads and puzzles which mystery fans should enjoy if they’re comfortable with a more heavily video game-ish experience.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like J-horror; enjoy ghost stories; are comfortable playing video games\n\nThe Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria\n\nKazuki Hoshino is an average student at an average high-school trying to live an average high-school student life without anything getting in the way of his very peaceful, un-compromised existence. Hoshino’s ardent commitment to maintaining as unspectacular an existence as humanly possible has attracted the amusement of a being named “O”, who wishes to give Hoshino a “Box” — a wish-granting implement that will give him anything he asks for. When Hoshino rejects the wish, insisting he doesn’t want anything he doesn’t already have, “O” decides to make it his mission to subject Hoshino to as gruesome conditions as he can until the high-schooler relents and accepts the “Box” to wish for his everyday life back…. in an experiment to test the furthest possible limits of human homeostasis.\n\nDuring this experiment to push Kazuki into accepting a wish, more and more of the people in his life are given “Boxes”, and these “Boxes” take the wisher’s deepest desires and externalizes them into supernatural phenomena… all entirely centralized around disrupting Kazuki Hoshino’s average, everyday life!\n\nIn order to restore balance to his existence without wishing the “Boxes” away, Kazuki Hoshino, along with Maria Otonashi, must continue to (1.) discover what the nature of the supernatural phenomenon targeting them is, (2.) figure out what manner of which produced the phenomenon, and (3.) figure out who would make such a wish and convince them to unhand their “Box”…\n\nThe Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria is, strictly speaking, a “supernatural psychological thriller” novel series told in the form of semi-episodic mystery stories. There are seven volumes in the series, each one focusing on a different incident with a different wish produced by a different “Box”, and in each case the protagonists are required to deduce details about the wish and wisher, making this another honest-to-God example of the hybrid mystery plotting style. While it isn’t strictly-speaking always fairplay, and the first book is more of a straight-forward supernatural drama, some of the books like Volume 2 really get close to purified detective fiction, including genuinely fair clues, clever logic, and format-breaking storytelling that make this a super interesting and enthralling supernatural detective series.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: are comfortable with high-school drama; are interested in supernatural mysteries; want a series that gets progressively more surreal over time; are interested in psychological drama.\n\nWhile their shin-honkaku brethren are more publicized in our nook of the internet, these five and more represent how varied and intelligent the world of Japanese thrillers can be, and just how amenable they can be to the sensibilities of lovers of puzzle plots and Golden Age mysteries. Oftentimes they can be found not far from the hallowed grounds of authentic mystery we love so much, so if you choose to pursue any of these stories, happy sleuthing, and good reading!\n\nG. K. Chesterton’s mystery writings featuring the crime-solving parish priest Father Brown stand today as some of the most influential in the entire history of genre. To refer to a plot-point as “Chestertonian” is a term so ubiquitous that even someone who has never read his works understands the paradox of hiding something without really hiding it at all — clues snuggled neatly in the boundary between information which isn’t explicitly made known and information which certainly must exist. With G. K. Chesterton’s writing inspiring crime writers all the world over, from slivers of Chestertonian plotting in Agatha Christie’s Death in the Clouds to entire series inspired by Father Brown’s exploits in Japan’s A Aiichirou, he’s an author who almost needs no introduction.\n\nAs one of the founding members of the Detection Club, as well as its first president, G. K. Chesterton was one of the first authors whose stories started to show the seeds of the style of plotting the Golden Age of Crime Fiction came to be known for. Tricky plots and multi-layered misdirection started to replace basic criminal precaution, foreshadowing became more salient, and the “impossible crimes” began to mature past their pre-Golden Age crudeness — it is thanks to G. K. Chesterton that the purely naturalistic, rational mysteries of the 19th century would slowly become replaced with imaginative plotters and clever criminals.\n\nHowever, though The Innocence of Father Brown can be seen flirting with a kind of plotting that would go on to dominate the puzzle plots of the 1920s to 40s, it cannot be said that the notion of “fairplay” has actually yet fully formed. Often times, Father Brown solves the crimes through information hitherto unbeknownst to the reader, thought processes that sometimes don’t even begin to approach rational or concrete (in one story, Brown argues that a man is innocent of a theft merely because he is a Socialist!), or simply divining the answer from mid-air. Nonetheless, the seeds for the Golden Age are clearly here, and it’s easy to see how Chesterton preempted (or even created) many of the elements of what would become the “fairplay” detective novel half a decade before its formal existence. Many famous Golden Age mysteries, such as Ronald Knox’s “Solved by Inspection”, Agatha Christie’s Death in the Clouds, and John Dickson Carr’s The Four False Weapons have borrowed, adapted, reworked, inverted, subverted, reimagined, and reconstructed tricks from Chesterton’s tales, so much so that it can be said Chesterton invented many of the forms of misdirection for which the genre would go on to be known.\n\nAs a weaver of yarns of crime, Chesterton was forward-thinking. Many gimmicks appear in these stories which represent Chesterton and Chesterton alone and, in that way, create so many stories that even 110 years later can be seen as original. Occasionally, a story few of the stories may show their age in such ways as a unique concept clearly mimicked ad nauseum from Chesteron’s oeuvre.\n\nThe famous highlights of the stories, however, are not merely the tricky plots, but also the prose, which is defined by its whimsy, humor, and most prominently those “paradoxes” for which Chesterton is so famous. Sometimes these “paradoxes” are more like “dichotomies”, but regardless of how you classify them they stand out in Chesterton’s writing as the most straightforwardly evocative, often relying on contrast or irony to convey a lot of information in very little space. Lines like “bad clothes which were too good for them” are often quotable.\n\nThese paradoxes also inform the most unique aspect of Chesterton’s mystery plots: those “intuitive reasoning” stories where the exact form the mystery takes isn’t quite apparent until the denouement. These tales differ from most detective stories in that they don’t focus on a well-defined criminal problem, instead dealing with Father Brown’s investigation into apparent paradoxes of character, nature, or behavior, and offering a decidedly reasonable explanation from his intuition. Such examples include the pre-eminent “The Queer Feet”, in which Father Brown must figure out the mystery behind “feet which run in order to walk” and “walk in order to run”, and “The Honour of Israel Gow” , in which Father Brown is called upon to explain the bizarre behavior of a man who may or may not have lived and may or may not have died. These stories stand out as the most unequivocally “Chestertonian” in the Father Brown canon.\n\nBut the series is not perfect and without flaw. A major percentage of the charm in these stories can be found in their religious preoccupations. The stories concern themselves intimately with themes of religious proselytizing, with practically every murderous culprit being an atheist who simply needs to see the graces of God and Christianity, with humanity often explored through the lens of Roman Catholicism. Those who find this charming will be sure to enjoy the stories, but those who aren’t religious may find themselves forced to reckon with the fact that the author clearly thought that people like themselves were statistically guaranteed to be murderers. The series’ perspective on religion and humanity can be argued to occasionally be naïve in that uniquely religious way. For stories wherein the large portion of the appeal is in those musings, those who find themselves at the butt-end of Chesterton’s theocentric moralizing may feel somewhat alienated.\n\nBut, putting taste aside, I can’t help but respect Chesterton for his typical brilliance. The man was clearly imaginative in the extreme, and even the social commentary can be alienating, when I manage to look at the heart of his best tales I can see why Chesterton’s name has lived on in respect to detective fiction, and not just for his theology…\n\n“The Blue Cross” has “The Greatest Detective in the World”, Frenchman Aristide Valentin on the trail of the world’s greatest thief Flambeau. Flambeau is a man who, although notably over six feet tall, was a master of disguise and a thief of great (and often humorous) exploits, such as picking up two policeman and running down the street with them under his arms. Detective Valentin has tracked Flambeau to London, and suddenly starts to find various bizarre occurrences like a priest throwing soup at a wall, smashing a window and then immediately paying for the damages, swapping the signs for the nuts and the oranges in a storefront and the containers for the salt and sugar in a restaurant… all of which he suspects will lead him to Flambeau.\n\nOriginally published as “Valentin Follows a Curious Trail”, this clearly relies on the subversion of you believing that this is a Valentin story, with Valentin standing in as “the Great Detective” like Auguste Dupin or Sherlock Holmes, when it is in fact a Father Brown story… a pretty open secret in a collection of short stories with “Father Brown” plastered all over the cover.\n\nThis is the first story with the very Chestertonian problem of “mysteries with an unclear form that don’t make sense until the end”, though the solution doesn’t work as well with the foreknowledge that this is a Father Brown story. A good introduction to the principle cast of Father Brown, but as a mystery story it only functions as intended if you read it when published and absolutely no later. Still, there is quite a bit of cleverness here establishing Chesterton’s fondness for paradox in the mechanics of the crime.\n\n“The Secret Garden”, then, is the cleaning up of “The Blue Cross”‘s subversion to make room for Father Brown to formally take over the series as feature sleuth. The Great Detective Aristide Valentin is hosting a dinner party where the guest of honor is Julius K. Brayne, a man who seems to belong to all religions, an indecisive agnostic who donates moneys to all movements of all churches. However, the festivities are interrupted when a corpse is located in the garden by another dinner guest, decapitated with the head is nearby. The man is unrecognizable to everyone, which creates something of an impossible problem: the front door of the house was guarded by a servant, the garden is entirely enclosed and can only be accessed from within the house, therefore… how did this murder victim get into the garden without being seen by anyone? Julius K. Brayne goes on to vanish from the house under similarly impossible circumstances, conspicuously establishing his own guilt…\n\nIt’s a very atmospheric and Carrian decapitation plot, but when you boil it down to its central trick, the decapitation trick is basically the two classic decapitation tricks put together into one story, making it pretty predictable (I’d be shocked to hear that the seasoned reader was fooled by this story for even a second). However, to the story’s benefit, I’ve never seen these tricks be utilized to create an impossible problem in quite this way, so even today it still stands a pretty clever variation on the idea in principle, even if none the less obvious for it.\n\nThe killer is the subversive element of the story, though I found the religious motive to be pretty random for what role the character was supposed to be playing in this series… It’s also pretty ludicrous, based on the idea that atheists are as religious about their atheism as theists are in their faith. No real human would ever commit murder for the reason provided in this story…\n\nGripes aside, it really is an inspired idea for an impossible crime. The mechanics of the decapitation themselves are old hat and predictable, but to see it employed not just for identity obfuscation but to create a genuine impossible crime is a really smart idea on Chesterton’s part. Sits firmly in the “obvious but clever” category.\n\nI wonder, actually, if this is the first appearance of this particular decapitation trick…\n\n“The Queer Feet” has Father Brown at a hotel that is exclusive for the sake of being exclusive, taking the unknown confessions of an employee who has fallen ill… While locked into the room he’s been provided to do his writing, he’s harassed by the sounds of footsteps out in the hallway which seem “to run in order to walk” and “to walk in order to run”…\n\nThis is another of that uniquely Chestertonian problem of “the exact nature of the mystery isn’t quite clear until the end”, and the explanation really is brilliant. This is the first appearance of Chesterton’s favorite gimmick of “congruous invisibility”, and I think this one works better than other, more famous examples of this trick in the Father Brown canon. The congruity is explicitly established early in the story by the palpable social satire, and requires active effort on the culprit’s part to perform (as opposed to simply relying on an unreliable quirk of language).\n\nIf there’s a gripe to be had with this brilliantly clever story, Father Brown’s detection of the crime would’ve been more impactful had he revealed it before the crime was made known to the audience — having Father Brown solve a crime which we, the readers, didn’t even know had occurred until he explicitly explained his reasoning? Would have been something else entirely!\n\nStill, great story with a perplexing riddle, and Father Brown’s final line is great…\n\n“The Flying Stars” sees Father Brown as a guest at a Boxing Day dinner where the family puts on a masquerade play to entertain themselves. Only, of course, crime follows, as The Flying Stars, jewels as well as the patriarch’s gift to his daughter, are stolen from a man’s pocket during the proceedings! Father Brown immediately divines the solution.\n\nA pretty standard theft elevated by the thief’s clever use of the improvisational play makes this a fun comedy-cum-detective story. However, though the thief’s “trap” is brilliant, it’s also perfectly unnecessary and clearly done for no better reason than the thief wanted to do some kind of flashy trick. The narrative admits that he easily could’ve stolen the gems with equal efficacy and gotten away scot free while doing half as much work, and that the thief knew this, and was simply having fun with it. So much so that the impact it had on his plan continues to elude me entirely…\n\nWell, the idea for the trap is nonetheless brilliant, so it gets a pass. Kind of an inversion of “congruous invisibility” — making an incongruous person perfectly congruous by sheer nature of all the incongruity surrounding him. Decent story.\n\n“The Invisible Man” is G. K. Chesterton’s most famous story. A woman rejects two “ugly” “freaks”, telling them that if they wish to marry her they must make something of their lives on principle. While the first of these “freaks” — a borderline-dwarf — succeeds in making autonomous servants, the second seems to merely be stalking the woman, promising in threatening notes to murder the dwarf if she marries him… all while appearing to be invisible! Naturally, this comes to a head as the invisible man truly does commit the murder he promised to commit… in front of four witnesses who swear that nobody walked into the victim’s house, despite the fact footprints show otherwise.\n\nAs I’ve hinted at above, I simply do not enjoy this story or consider it even remotely possible — not merely implausible, but I believe this story would never work out the way as described in real life. It utilizes Chesterton’s well-worn trick, but in this case brought to the point of absurdity so to not even be conceivable. It ultimately relies on a false premise that Chesterton tries to explain away as a quirk of language, but all I know is that the way Father Brown claims people answer questions is not the way I answer questions, that’s for certain! The solution could’ve involved the killer paying off everyone in the city to lie on his behalf, and I’d find it more believable and more enjoyable than the solution Chesterton gives us here. Hokey and overrated.\n\n“The Honour of Israel Gow” sees Father Brown at a Scottish castle, investigating the life of a man who may or may not have lived, and the death of the very same man who may or may not have died. Brown’s newly reformed friend, former thief and current genius amateur detective, is up the wall with oddities surrounding the life and death and person of the Earl of Glengyle. He left out snuff with no snuffbox, had candles with no candlesticks… and from just this, and a conversation with the late Earl’s groundskeeper Israel Gow, Father Brown can expound on the mysteries of the house of the Earl of Glengyle.\n\nAnother of those intuitive reasoning stories with no apparent criminal element, same as “The Blue Cross” and “The Queer Feet”, “The Honour of Israel Gow”‘s solution is perfectly natural given the provided information, so long as you can find the missing link; it is, perhaps a less inspired, but more credible deduction than the one seen in “The Queer Feet”! There is a long series of false solutions at the beginning which are very pleasantly clever.\n\nSometimes Chesterton likes to do soft style parodies, with “The Honour of Israel Gow” clearly and evidently having fun at the expense of the stories written and inspired by Wilkie Collins. The characters in the story themselves lampshade this by calling their conundrum a melodrama straight from the mind of Collins himself. Much to be enjoyed here; these intuitive reasoning stories tend to be highlights.\n\nThe Wrong Shape” has Flambeau and Father Brown appearing at the summons of a writer of oriental romantic poems. The odd artist has a fascination with all things Asian, with his furniture being a complex hodgepodge of various Asian crafts, and the man even having an odd Indian visitor in his home. And so, when he winds up dead in his locked and sealed atrium with a note nearby reading “I die by my own hand, yet I die murdered”, it’s wondered if maybe this odd Indian visitor used hypnotism to compel the author to kill himself…\n\nI am going to choose my words tactfully, because this topic seems to cause questionable debates in certain circles where pointing out racism in classic mysteries gets you labeled a “revisionist woke liberal”. No, I do not think this story should be censored, yes I think this story deserves to exist (as all art does), no I do not think that it should be rewritten in any way. That being said, it is still flagrantly racist. “The Indian” is referred to in exactly those terms throughout the entire story; he is not given any other name, unless you want to count “n****r” as a name. The presentation of the impossibility relies on multiple people who are otherwise rational and supposedly kind-spirited (why is Father Brown calling people “n****rs”?) to not only be incredibly racist, but so cruelly mean-spirited it overwrites all of their rational human beliefs to even for a moment believe that Indian people have access to mind-warping voodoo powers. As someone who reads these stories for enjoyment, and does not enjoy racism, I think it’s fair to say that the racism impeded my ability to derive the maximum amount of enjoyment from this story. It is free to exist as it does, but I am also free to not enjoy that it does so. On this one point, I do not care if you disagree; do not tell me.\n\nAnyway, as concerns the investigation; I didn’t like this story when I first read it, because the mechanisms of the impossible crime are ostensibly quite crude for someone as forward thinking as Chesterton. But on closer inspection, I realized that the misdirection deflecting away from the solution was actually quite crafty, with a typically Chestertonian “congruity” clue hiding it all the while. The presentation of a paradox to mull over was a smart red herring and distraction, the sort I don’t think I’ve seen very often; I almost feel like this clue would’ve functioned even better in a visual medium, like a television show or a comic. As an impossible crime story, this is fairly well-told and quite good, but not a favorite.\n\nIn “The Sins of Prince Saradine”, Flambeau is summoned by an Italian prince for a meeting on the condition that Flambeau is only allowed to come once he is fully reformed. In this dreamy, fairyland-like islet, nothing is quite as it appears to be as Father Brown is assaulted by senses of foreboding and impending Doom…\n\nThe fourth intuitive reasoning story in the collection, this one is solid but only just. Despite being an intuitive reasoning story, the explanation relies on principles often seen before in criminal mystery stories, dulling the charm of these stories, which comes from the very fact that the explanation is so brilliantly far-removed from typical mystery fare. They’re ideas that already weren’t very new when this story was written either, making it a little more predictable and less knee-slappingly brilliant than its kin.\n\nIn fact, this repurposing of a criminal trick in an intuitive reasoning story was very much the point, as a trick utilized earlier in a criminal Father Brown story was explicitly the inspiration for the culprit in this case, a really smart clue that is established early on. Overall, this story is charmingly well-written and somewhat clever, but aside from its beautifully magical imagery unremarkable in this collection of generally much more inspired stories.\n\nIn “The Hammer of God”, after declaring his intentions to go and sleep with the wife of the local blacksmith, Norman Bohun is soon found dead under puzzling circumstances. His skull was destroyed with a massive blow, but next to him was a murder weapon: a tiny hammer… No woman could’ve delivered such a blow with such a weapon, and no man would ever consciously choose to use such a weapon, creating a seemingly inexplicable crime…\n\nThe explanations for why the paradox is a problem to begin with aren’t entirely convincing, and the solution is one of those solutions where it’s only a problem if you uncritically accept conditions laid out for you by the story without challenging them. An ounce of common sense without any extraneous mystery reading nonsense should allow any reader to easily pick out the killer and the murder method without much suspense or difficulty; neither are particularly clever. Perhaps the most well-known Father Brown this side of “The Invisible Man”, but certainly overrated.\n\nOne of the few instances in which the Father Brown culprit isn’t an atheist.\n\nA typewriter saleswoman named Pauline falls to her death in an empty elevator shaft in “The Eye of Apollo”. However, her death is decidedly impossible. Her sister Joan, towards whom the victim Pauline was abusive, was in another office at the time of death; and Kalon, the patron of a sun-worshiping religion, was proselytizing from his balcony at the time Pauline fell. With suicide additionally off the table, Father Brown must solve the seemingly impossible circumstances of Pauline’s murder…\n\nA phenomenally clever little story and the second best in the collection so far. While it isn’t so hard to figure out, relying on a principle people are likely familiar with, the specific application of the principle, combined with the neatly laid religious elements, make this a pretty smartly realized alibi problem. This is apparently the predecessor to Knox’s “Solved by Inspection”, but by all accounts I think this is the superior variation.\n\n“The Sign of the Broken Sword” sees Father Brown and Flambeau haunting the tombs of famous English general St. Clair, searching for clues into his mysterious historical death. General St. Clair led a small force of his soldiers against a much larger Brazilian battalion, whereupon St. Clair was taken prisoner by Brazilian general Olivier and subsequently hung, with his broken sword dangling from his neck… However, Father Brown disagrees that this version of events is true; St. Clair was too clever to wage this suicide mission for no reason, and Olivier was too altruistic to hang a prisoner… so surely there must be a more profound spirit of evil running under this bizarre moment in English history…\n\nI was spoiled on this short story’s connection to a certain Agatha Christie novel by one of my fellow bloggers, and I’m very sad for that because it let me clue into the true solution much sooner than I would’ve liked. This is actually a spectacular “historical cold case” story. The explanation behind St. Clair’s bizarre behavior is a brilliant way to take advantage of a wartime setting for classical misdirection in a murder mystery, and the explanation behind St. Clair’s subsequent death is genuinely creepy, both taking advantage of the large scale of war for their impact. Brilliant story, this, new second best in the collection.\n\n“The Three Tools of Death” see Father Brown investigate a bizarre crime, in which a man died by being thrown out of the window onto the bank of a traintrack below, and yet there still seem to be three weapons responsible for his death: a rope tied around his legs; a gun fired in his bedroom; and, a knife with fresh blood on it!\n\nThe set-up doesn’t super intuitively make sense because there isn’t any ambiguity surrounding the nature or cause of his death (that being defenestration). The idea of three false weapons being present at the crime scene is one John Dickson Carr would revisit in his own The Four False Weapons, and it’s a worthwhile prospect but it isn’t a premise G. K. Chesterton established very well, and this bizarre half-set-up does dull the story’s impact. The anti-solution has all of Father Brown’s characteristic cleverness, but part of me wonders if maybe this story was written on a tight deadline with its rather short length (~30% shorter than the average Father Brown story) and messy set-up.\n\nThe Innocence of Father Brown might not be the beacon of perfection it’s often heralded as, but what can be said about it is that it’s a fascination and illuminating look into what the genre would become. The clever, imaginative, tricky plots of the Golden Age essentially owe their existence to G. K. Chesterton and Father Brown, a purifying force that elevated detective stories from their crude and rational forms into something a little more artistic and crafty. Quite a few classics of the genre make their appearance here, and while I don’t think I’ve walked away thinking of Chesterton himself as a favorite author, I can say that some highlights like “The Queer Feet” will stick with me as some some of my favorite individual mystery short stories of all time!\n\nI will absolutely return to this formative author’s mystery stories in the near future, as it is interesting to see the DNA of so many beloved novels and stories first form in these pages… As it is, The Innocence of Father Brown is a solid collection from one of the most important detective fiction authors of all time!\n\nAs is standard, I’ll wrap this all up with a ranking of the Father Brown stories…\n\n“The Queer Feet”\n\n“The Sign of the Broken Sword”\n\n“The Eye of Apollo”\n\n“The Secret Garden”\n\n“The Honour of Israel Gow”\n\nThe Wrong Shape”\n\n“The Three Tools of Death”\n\n“The Blue Cross”\n\n“The Flying Stars”\n\n“The Sins of Prince Saradine”\n\n“The Hammer of God”\n\n“The Invisible Man”\n\nThis is not a review of Death Among the Undead by Masahiro Imamura.\n\nWhen I first discovered Golden Age mysteries I was 15 years old, a freshman in high-school whose only experience with mystery fiction was my fondness for the the still eminently wonderful Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney video game franchise, a few odd parodies in cartoons, the odd Sherlock Holmes story, and occasionally catching my aunt watching Criminal Minds or crime documentaries in the living room while she folded clothes. I heard the name Agatha Christie thrown around a few times, I knew she was the most famous mystery author (no, the most well-sold author of any genre in any language!), but it never occurred to me there was any link between this silly lawyer video game I enjoyed and the types of mysteries this Agatha Christie lady wrote… Her works were old and Ace Attorney was new, so surely I’d have no interest with these dusty old “classics”?\n\nBut then I stumbled across a recently-translated interview with Takumi Shu, the creator of Ace Attorney, who began listing his inspirations for the series. Agatha Christie’s name didn’t come up specifically, but a lot of authors whose names I’ve heard in relation to hers were mentioned — John Dickson Carr, Ellery Queen, Anthony Berkeley. I realized that Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney wasn’t a style of plotting unto itself, but a modern reinvigoration of a whole sub-genre of similarly-written mystery stories I simply had no idea existed!\n\nSo, finally, after going back and forth on whether or not it was worth it to read her novels, I decided to ask my high school librarian and go home with a borrowed copy of The Mysterious Affair of Styles under my arm. I read it on the school bus, even though the bullies tried to rip it from my hands. I read it at my house, even when the sun began to set and I was supposed to be in bed. I read it over breakfast instead of eating, even though I knew I was supposed to be hungry. By the time I even made it back to the library, I’d devoured the book whole and was already ready to ask my librarian for a copy of Murder on the Links.\n\nThe book was exactly what I thought it wouldn’t be! It was just like that collection of puzzles, riddles, and clues in Ace Attorney, and just the kind of mystery writing I’d fallen in love with and thought didn’t exist anywhere else! A whole genre of exactly the kind of story I’ve always wanted to read existed, against my knowledge, and I didn’t know about it!? No, no, no, that just wouldn’t do! I was already struck by the possibilities of plot and theme and setting, inspired by the potential of tricks and misdirection, keen on picking apart clues and breaking down alibis. This was a whole new world that felt like it was built just for me, and I was ready to explore!\n\n…Fast forward seven years.\n\nI am a third year in university. I still love Golden Age mysteries, but the room left for genuine surprise felt… narrower. Yes, I still stumbled upon brilliant and unprecedented gems of the genre, but after obsessively feasting into every corner of the Golden Age mystery I could find, it became less and less often I felt like the explorer I did as a freshman in high school. I was enjoying the mysteries I read, but so many felt like I was just amusing myself with variations and remixes of ideas I’ve seen dozens, hundreds of times before. I am not an explorer anymore; I am a hiker, traveling up and down the paths I’ve become comfortable and complacent in. Yes, sometimes you find that the odd traveler has come by and left a large stone carving or dug a lake near the path, but outside of these diversions, it is the same path. I found myself walking the path a little less frequently, and doing it for shorter periods at a time. I was no longer staying out until the crack of dawn, instead using the first sign of darkness as an excuse to return home…\n\nIt almost feels silly to say I’ve reached this point so quickly…\n\nBut then one day I noticed a change in the path that really stole me away. Most changes in the path are minute at worst, like someone shifting the pebbles in the road, and one-off diversions at best, like a fireworks show that comes suddenly, amazes you with its spectacle and explosive ambition, and then dies away again. But this was more than just a negligible modification to the road I’ve been walking for seven years; it was a whole other walkway, branching sharply off to the east. Equal parts eager and hesitant, I curiously followed the path and found at the end of it a copy of Death Among the Undead by Masahiro Imamura, sitting in the middle of a grassy grove.\n\nWhat the Hell?, I thought. Death Among the Undead? Undead, as in… zombies? But the world’s tired of zombies already! I’m tired of them, dammit! and I gracelessly put the book down, weaved my way back through the three-lined path and continued along the well-worn hiking path I’ve become accustomed to.\n\nEvery time I revisit the road, walking through the growing depressions of my own feet in the pebbles, I see that path branching off towards the east and I feel my own hypocrisy. I was complaining about the monotony of the hiking path. I was complaining that I didn’t feel like an explorer anymore! Well, there you go! A murder mystery with zombies. That’s as different as you can get, idiot! I kept waiting for the next fireworks show or for the next traveler to come by and drop a new artwork along the path, because I realized I wanted something different, but I didn’t want something different, did I?\n\nConfronted with my own absurd hypocrisy, I stomped into the wooded path to the east, angrily snatched the book up off the grass, planted my ass there and told myself I would not move until I’ve given Death Among he Undead its fair shot and read the whole damn thing from beginning to end.\n\nAnd I did. I read the whole book in two sittings, and just like with Mysterious Affair at Styles I read late into the night until the bags forming under my eyes began to ache and throb, and even then I didn’t stop until I knew I wasn’t getting the most out of the book reading it like that. I went to sleep right there in the grove, woke up, and immediately dove right back into the book until I had entirely finished it.\n\nAnd then I stood up and returned to my hiking path… only, it wasn’t quite the same anymore. The road beneath my feet phased transiently from pebble to cobblestone to wood to asphalt, the curves in the path began to shift up and down, and left and right like waves. The trees weren’t only green anymore, now taking on hues of blue and purple and orange, and only sometimes were the trees even trees, as sometimes they took on the forms of stone towers and steel-paneled, probing lights. Every step along this well-worn path suddenly felt like I was diving into a brand new world, a shifting world at once always recognizable as the one I love as well as a scary, alien world totally beyond my expectation of what could even be.\n\nBut I didn’t hesitate. I dove headlong into this same-different world.\n\nI was an explorer anew.\n\nDeath Among the Undead by Masahiro Imamura is a work that awoken me to new possibilities in the mystery story. Hybrid mysteries… Those puzzlers in the tradition of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen and John Dickson Carr were running their course, some would say. There’s only so much you can do in our world to commit murder and get away with it!\n\nLong ago I’d have agreed with them. It’s only reasonable that the puzzle mystery genre would die; our world is defined by too many limitations. I felt disheartened that such limitations could only be overcome in inimitable, bombastic fashion, and even those options were dwindling day by day. It wasn’t until Masahiro Imamura that I realized that the natural answer… is simply to go beyond our own world.\n\nMasahiro Imamura’s debut is a fantastic locked-room mystery with three impossible crimes in them, all of which use zombies as a murder method. Three impossible crimes which simultaneously could not be committed by humans, for the corpses have been eaten, and yet could not be committed by zombies, as they are incapable of entering the locked and sealed rooms and then escaping. It is a brilliant and wildly imaginative mystery novel that can only exist due to its fantastical and supernatural elements.\n\nBut it’s also personally important to me because it is the novel that turned me onto new possibilities in detective stories. The ability to take Agatha Christie and put that kind of writing into fantasy worlds, or science-fiction worlds, or zombie apocalypses… No, I’m not talking about occult detective fiction like The Dresden Files, but 100% authentic Golden Age-inspired puzzle plots inspired by the worlds beyond our own.\n\nIt’s a potential I have become passionate about exploring. It’s the whole reason I study Japanese, to explore all of those fantastical mysteries that have followed Death Among the Undead. Nothing fascinates me more in the genre at this very moment than the possibilities those wildly creative authors in Japan have unlocked by tapping into this unexplored frontier of murder and mystery. My mind is flurried with thoughts, feelings, ideas, theories, daydreaming, all of the brand new stories that can come from a little dip into the surreal and fantastical. Reading Death Among the Undead makes me feel lost in the very same lovely way that I felt when I first walked into my library and asked for one copy of The Mysterious Affair at Styles — suddenly I don’t have expectations or ideas, I’m not endlessly savvy in tropes and tricks anymore, and I’m struck head over heels with the infinite potentiality of mysteries from worlds beyond.\n\nThis is not a review of Death Among the Undead by Masahiro Imamura. I am not qualified to write a review, because I love the book way too much to be truly impartial. All I can say is that this novel was so fantastically superb, imaginative, creatively ambitious, and awe-inspiring it motivated me to learn a whole other language. I couldn’t go another day without acknowledging this book on my blog beyond its inclusion on my list of my favorite impossible crimes… It’s brilliant, and has tapped into a new level of passion and interest in the genre I never knew I could have.\n\nThis is not a review of Death Among the Undead. This is a love letter, and a thank you.\n\n(*Note, although this is the sixteenth in this series of reviews, I only encourage you to read my review of the first volume to get a summary of the series and my preamble about the reviews. It is not necessary to read any other entry in the series besides the first)\n\nYou may or may not have noticed that I haven’t updated my Detective Conan reviews in a while. The last update was a review of volume 15, nearly a third of a year ago… This is NOT because I haven’t been reading it, but quite the opposite: I’ve been reading it between classes, while bed-ridden with sciatica, at the hospital waiting to be diagnosed with sciatica, during mental health burnouts, over lunch… It’s such a breezy and easy to read series that it’s become a go-to comfort read for me when I feel like I haven’t touched enough mysteries lately.\n\nI’m actually at book 30 in Detective Conan now, and reviewing these somewhat weekly means I’ll never catch up and never have room to discuss any other non-literature mysteries! So I kept putting off writing new Detective Conan reviews, but then continued reading the series until one day I realized… oh no… I’ve only reviewed half of what I’ve read!\n\nSuffice it to say, this was unideal. Anxiety set in (as it always does when I’m facing the most insignificant problems a person has ever faced) and I had no idea how I was ever going to catch up with myself reviewing them one measly book at a time!\n\n…So why review them one book at a time? Why not write one massive catch-up review post, covering all 14 volumes I’ve read since I last updated the series, and continue from there? Does this seem inefficient and inelegant? Probably.\n\nBut I’m still doing it. It makes me feel better.\n\nDetective Conan is one of if not simply the largest “classical-styled” mystery series in the entire world, boasting exactly 700 disparate mystery stories across 1109 chapters of 104 books, and 1067 episodes of 31 seasons of television (only counting the stories original to the television adaptation), and that’s before taking into account video games, novels, movies, audio plays, and other random, obscure micro-entries… and the franchise isn’t even done yet, as it’s slated to continue in full force later this year! Suffice it to say that when I set out to consume nearly 2200 micro-units of media for review on this blog, I was making a huge commitment of time, energy, and effort, not to mention sacrificing my integrity in the eyes of more conservative mystery readership…\n\nNaturally the project sometimes gets away from me, as I’ve read 15 whole books in the series since I last reviewed it. If it were one or two books I was behind, that’d be one thing, but 15…!? That’s not reasonable at all. I was simply not on top of the project. In order to get myself back on track, I’ve decided to carry out the worst plan in the history of plans and cram 14 reviews into one by going through a lightning round review of all 41(!) stories I’ve read but have yet to cover on the blog…\n\nHurray?\n\nI don’t want to waste too much time on this preamble for a rushed and slapdash review, so without much further ado, let’s start with…\n\nVolume 16 (1997)\n\nVolume 16 only fully starts on Chapter 4 with Casebook 043 – Elementary School Mystery Case (Chapters 4-5), a Junior Detective League case borrowing from Japanese schoolkid mythology of every school having “seven mysteries”. The Junior Detective League investigates running skeletons and moving statues, but the solution is intentionally silly and not entirely interesting, even if the “motive” is really cute.\n\nCasebook 044 – KAITO KID and the Black Star Case is a landmark case for the series, as it is the first crossover between Detective Conan and Gosho Aoyama’s other series Magic Kaito. Magic Kaito is a heist series about a magician-turned-supercriminal who seeks to steal every gem in the world until he can find the magical jewel that is responsible for his father’s death..! The protagonist, KAITO KID, often crosses over with Conan in heists told from the detective’s perspective, and this blend of heist fiction and classical detection results in an exceptionally fun and outstandingly unique story in this franchise. A+!\n\nCasebook 045 – Famous Potter Murder Case (Chapters 10-2) involves a famous potter and his proteges excitedly showing the famous Detective Richard Moore their work when the potter’s daughter-in-law accidentally breaks his magnum opus… She’s naturally torn-up with grief, so when she dies by hanging in the shed the very next day, when everyone was together in the living room of the house with an alibi, it’s determined that her death must’ve been a suicide…\n\nMy biggest gripe with Conan alibi tricks is that the cases tend to get lazy by giving everyone a perfect alibi, highlighting the very existence of an alibi trick and making the tricks less functional and more obvious as a consequence. What’s here is a decent idea for a trick, but the cracks on the foundation become more apparent when your set-up shouts “hey, everybody look! Alibi here! There’s an alibi trick here!”. Some later Conan stories handle this better. Middle of the line story.\n\nVolume 16 is fairly unremarkable if not for the exceptional KAITO KID case. It’s hard to recommend the volume on the weight of one story alone, but it is a landmark, so I’d suggest checking out the anime adaptation of this story to get context for future KAITO KID crossovers (of which there will be many)\n\nVolume 17 (1997)\n\nVolume 17 opens with Casebook 046 – Scuba Divers Attempted Murder Case (Chapters 3-5), in which a bride-to-be almost drowns after being bitten by a rare, poisonous sea-snake! But a chance observation by Conan, a"
