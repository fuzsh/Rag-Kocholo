        "text": "Over the last few weeks, I’ve taken an in-depth look at “La La Land” and many of its influences. While I admire that movie greatly, it’s time to move on to other topics.\n\nI thought I’d try to stick with a theme for my next set of movies, and I landed on the film world of Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is perhaps the most famous of the hard-boiled private detectives of the film noir’s heyday, but he began as a character on the page, in the crime novels of Raymond Chandler.\n\nNo matter what description you read of Marlowe as a character, you’re bound to see some of the following details listed:\n\nHe was born in Santa Rosa, California and works out of a Los Angeles office.\n\nHe worked for the D.A. for a time but was fired.\n\nHe’s a quick-witted smooth talker.\n\nHe is fond of liquor, cigarettes and chess.\n\nHe’s no stranger to the ladies, though he’s smartly wary of them.\n\nHe works alone, and often clashes with the LAPD.\n\nI don’t know about you, but after reading that list, I’m in on Marlowe.\n\nDuring the marathon, we’ll be taking a look at five movies, and five different actors portraying the private eye. Here are the movies, in the order that I’ll review them, with the actor playing Marlowe listed afterwards:\n\n“The Big Sleep” (1944), Humphrey Bogart\n\n“Murder, My Sweet” (1942), Dick Powell\n\n“Farewell, My Lovely” (1975), Robert Mitchum\n\n“Marlowe” (1969), James Garner\n\n“The Long Goodbye” (1973), Elliott Gould\n\nI’m planning to do one joint post for “Murder, My Sweet” and “Farewell, My Lovely,” as the latter was a 1975 remake of the former. Otherwise I’ll dive into each of the movies and performances separately. If you like shadowy scenes, private detectives, shady characters, guns and dames, I hope you’ll follow along."
