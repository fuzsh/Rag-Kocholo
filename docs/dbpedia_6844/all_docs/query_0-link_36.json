        "text": "Edward Dmytryk's MURDER MY SWEET (1944), from Raymond Chandler's ''Farewell My Lovely,'' compounded the flow of granite-hard detective movies that belately followed the success of Dashiell Hammett's ''Maltese Falcon'' in 1941. A harshly intriguing tale of blackmail and homicide, it spotlights Dick Powell as a California sleuth -- a new image for the vocalist, who is entirely credible in the role. So are Claire Trevor, Anne Shirley, Otto Kruger and Mike Mazurki. -- Tuesday at 11:30 A.M. on AMC.\n\nMitchell Leisen's GOLDEN EARRINGS (1947), returning Marlene Dietrich to Hollywood after her extensive wartime touring as an entertainer, is a campy charade, with Dietrich as a gypsy who aids a British spy (Ray Milland) in flight across Nazi-held territory. The tone is more skittish-romantic than farcical, with some menacing plot overtones and fringe diversions, like the sight of a heavily made-up Dietrich at a cooking cauldron and the rousing campfire delivery of the title ballad by Gypsy Vye. Milland's performance is both dignified and sporting -- Wednesday at 2:15 P.M. on AMC.\n\n''Titanic'' viewers curious about the early films of Gloria Stuart may want to tape Busby Berkeley's GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935,notable for two Berkeley musical stagings, including ''Lullaby of Broadway,'' and Miss Stuart's beauty, with an adoring Dick Powell -- Wednesday/Early Thursday at 4:15 A.M. on TCM.\n\nUnrequited love amid the strictures of New York high society in the 1870's is the theme of Martin Scorsese's AGE OF INNOCENCE (1993). Coming from the director of ''Mean Streets,'' with its pavement realism, this exquisitely wrought version of Edith Wharton's Pulitzer-winning novel is a satisfying jolt in performance and design. Daniel Day-Lewis plays an engaged lawyer attracted to a lovely, spirited outcast (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Winona Ryder is a short-sighted but shrewd bride-to-be. The show stealer is Miriam Margolyes as a wise matriarch -- Friday at 8 P.M. on USA. Howard Thompson"
