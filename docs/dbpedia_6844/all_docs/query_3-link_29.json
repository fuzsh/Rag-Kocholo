        "text": "Kitty Campbell is an archaeologist, but for some reason, she's also a detective--or that's what people seem to think. Whether she likes it or not, her colleagues trust her to seek out the truth when a crime is committed, and her new position on an excavation in Greece proves no different.\n\nWhen a researcher is discovered hanged in an olive grove, Kitty immediately knows all is not as it seems. As a paleoethnobotanist, an archaeologist who studies plants in prehistory, her in-depth knowledge of plant and human interactions gives her clues that help track down a killer--and for the first time, she begins to wonder if maybe she enjoys solving crime as much as she enjoys exploring the past! After all, aren't people the same, no matter where or when they are?\n\nCome along with Kitty to explore all of Greece--ancient and modern--as she unknots a crime that no one saw coming! Track the killer through olive groves & olive oil factories; through the mists of the oracle in the mountains and to the edges of the sea in Crete; along rocky volcanic calderas and along the winding streets of a resort town on a speeding moped, all alongside Kitty as she unravels a mystery and, for the first time, kinda loves it.\n\nYour quilt will grow as the clues pile up, and along the way, you'll learn skills, make friends, and discover a community you can count on.\n\nThe 2024 Murder Mystery Quilt is the story of a brilliant, haunted scientist's moxie & mental agility--and you get to solve the case alongside her!\n\nPiece your quilt in stunning colors that reflect the warm air and ocean breezes of Greece, from Santorini to Crete and even the ruins in Athens. Imagine a sunset over Mediterranean waters, with groves of olive trees on the hillside in the background--glorious!\n\nAlong the way, you're accompanied by your own Clue Crew of new quilting friends, warm support to grow your skills, and fun treats to keep you motivated!\n\nIncluded in the Murder Mystery Quilt: the How To Sew video series, where you can refine your skills NOW as you wait for the fun to begin. Whether you're new to quilting or you've been quilting for years, we have the resources and inspiration to make THIS YEAR the one where you sew your favorite quilt. Do it all with support and encouragement to finish together alongside your newest quilting friends!\n\nWe can't wait to quilt with you!\n\nEach year, the Murder Mystery Quilt brings you a brand-new mystery in an exciting setting for you to explore.

Presented on an exclusive social community platform, you can start your Yellowstone adventure TODAY as you wait for the 2024 Murder Mystery Quilt to begin.\n\nThis exclusive opportunity to gain access to Murder In Yellowstone is reserved for members who subscribe to the BUNDLE option, and won't last!
