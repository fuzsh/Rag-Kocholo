        "text": "MBC’s upcoming drama “Black Out” has unveiled new posters offering a sneak peek of its characters!\n\nAdapted from the best-selling German mystery novel “Snow White Must Die,” “Black Out” is a crime thriller drama that follows the story of a young man accused of murder in a mysterious case where no corpses were found. 11 years later, he embarks on a journey to uncover the truth of that fateful day. The drama stars Byun Yo Han, Go Joon, Go Bo Gyeol, Kim Bo Ra, and more.\n\nGo Jung Woo (Byun Yo Han), who was convicted of murdering two of his classmates 11 years ago, is shown in his poster surrounded by unknown hands covering his eyes and ears. The poster’s caption reflect his frustration and inability to prove his innocence due to lost memories, reading, “I have no memory of killing them, but… I also have no memory of not killing them.” The tears streaming from behind the hands on his face add to the mystery surrounding his character and what his tears might mean.\n\nDetective Noh Sang Chul (Go Joon), who suspects convicted murderer Go Jung Woo as he investigates the case from 11 years ago, is depicted covering one eye with his own hand, suggesting that he is looking at the situation from only one point of view. The scar on his forehead also hints at a challenging career as a detective. His intense gaze reflects his deep mistrust of Go Jung Woo, as does his poster’s caption: “You… killed someone? And two people at that?”\n\nMeanwhile, top star Choi Na Gyeom (Go Bo Gyeol), who is in love with Go Jung Woo, shows her dangerous devotion by saying, “He’s my first love. I… don’t care if he killed someone.” Her intriguing pose, with her fingers covering her lips as if to hide something, hints that she may have a secret.\n\nMeanwhile, newcomer Ha Seol (Kim Bo Ra) arrives in Mucheon Village and asks pointedly, “Is he pretending not to remember, or did Go Jung Woo not kill them?” Her strong stance is emphasized by her refusal to cover her ears, heightening interest in whether she will uncover the village’s hidden secrets.\n\n“Black Out” is set to premiere on August 16 at 9:50 p.m. KST.\n\nIn the meantime, watch Byun Yo Han in “Hansan: Rising Dragon” below:\n\nWatch Now\n\nOr watch Go Joon in “Cheat On Me If You Can” below:\n\nWatch Now\n\nSource (1)\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
