        "text": "ENG 381-Film Noirs: Visual Style and Fortune\n\nWednesday 5:30-8:20p\n\nSpring 2016\n\nSTV 101​\n\nWarning: The content of the books and films in this class are designed for mature audiences only. If issues of race, sex, violence, class, drugs, profanity or politics cause you discomfort or upset, please consider enrolling in a different class.​\n\nFrom ’40s Hollywood, film noir is disillusionment, alienation, and nihilism painted with German expressionism’s shadows and canted frames richly juxtaposed by European Neo-Realism. In this film and literature seminar we will immerse ourselves in this rich field of cultural inquiry (note the over 50 selected readings below). We’ll read as a class the “big three” noir novelists of the hard boiled tradition, Hammett, Chandler, and Cain, and two writers who pick up that noir thread 50 years later, Ellroy and Miller. We will study and discuss dedicated theoretical texts. And of course each week we will chronologically big screen the films listed below, asking, “Is film noir a genre?” Back in 1970 Raymond Durgnat in “Paint It B lack: The Family Tree of the Film Noir (1970) argued no, unlike the Western or gangster film, “ film noir is not a genre,” rather it “takes us into the realm of classification by motif and tone.” We’ll see if these films evince a particular political ideology. What was the impact of the Hayes Office and McCarthy hearings on noir? In what ways can we theorize noir’s gender and racial codes? We will consider such Durgnat’s schemas as Crime as Social Criticism, Hostages of Fortune. Middle Class Murder, Pathologies and Psychopaths, as we develop eyes and ears attuned to noir style, learn the language with which to describe it, and apply that knowledge. A Harold K. Sage Foundation grant will bring the former international private detective and bestselling crime mystery author of the Harlan Donnally and Graham Gage series, Steven Gore (http://stevengore.com/books.php), to campus for a public lecture and participation in the seminar for a discussion of Chinatown, which will be screened at the Normal Theatre and open to the public. Professor Chris Breu will also join us one evening to discuss his book Hard-Boiled Masculinities. Look for non-compulsary continuations of weekly seminar discussions at one of the local hotel watering holes. Weekly 500 word posts; critical essay.\n\nFilms Noir\n\n1/20-4/27\n\nPre-Noir\n\n1 Slightly Honorable (Garnett 1939) F. G.
