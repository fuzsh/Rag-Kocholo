        "text": "Film Noir\n\nfilm ˈnwär/ noun. a style, category or genre of film marked by a post-war mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace. The term was originally applied by French film critics to American thriller or detective films made in the period 1940–59. Foreign émigré directors such as Otto Preminger, Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, Billy Wilder, and others, who had been influenced by the highly stylized German expressionist* cinema, created films that featured morally ambiguous protagonists put in difficult situations which eventually lead to their downfall. There are very few happy endings in film noir. Film noir features highly theatrical acting, but emphasizes an almost documentary, real-life feel.\n\nThe following films all are prime examples of film noir. There are many more available in the Black Gold system as well. After each film description I have included a line (or two) of dialogue that helps to describe, or give a feel for, each film. I hope you enjoy this list as much as I did putting it together.\n\n*German Expressionist elements in film feature:\n\n• Anti-heroic (if not downright evil) characters at the center of the story...\n\n• which often involves madness, paranoia, obsession and...\n\n• is told in whole or in part from a subjective point of view.\n\n• A primarily urban setting, providing ample opportunity to explore the criminal underworld...\n\n• and the complex architectural and compositional possibilities offered, for example, by stairways and their railings, mirrors and reflecting windows, structures jutting every bit as vertically as they do horizontally so that...\n\n• the director can play with stripes, angles and geometric forms sliced from the stark contrasts between light and shadow.\n\n• Shadows, in fact, can take on an ominous presence of their own; think of the monster's shadow ascending the stairs in “Nosferatu”, the shadow preceding the murderer in “M” or the pursuit and capture of Maria in “Metropolis”.\n\n– from an article by David Hudson on German Expressionism at http://www.greencine.com.\n\nAce in the Hole\n\nAn early look at the impact of mass media in the public arena, featuring the story of a cynical and manipulative journalist.
