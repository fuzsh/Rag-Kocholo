Her parents were the late Bernard and Ernestine Quast Engels. She was married here July 21, 1880, to Mr. Sachs, who preceded her in death in 1933. They settled in Oakland at first, moving to Weimar in 1890.

Yeloow fever is reported, and there is riot in our midst [riot refers to later story]. Drs. Bowers, Moore and Brown report the following cases of yellow fever this morning: J. B. Russell, manager of Western Union Telegraph office; L. Boatright, Mr. Sachs, Mr. Brown and Mr. McCoy. Messrs. Sachs, Brown and McCoy have since died. Many of our citizens are leaving town, and seeking refuge in the country. [Burial place unknown]\n\nGalveston Daily News, October 21, 1873, page 2\n\nSachs, Herman P.\n\nANOTHER OLD TIMER IS CLAIMED BY DEATH HERE\n\nOne by one the old time citizens of Weimar are being claimed by Death. The latest of these to join that innumerable caravan gone on before was Mr. Herman P. Sachs, a resident of Weimar for the past thirty -nine years and at all times one of our most public spirited and enterprising citizens.\n\nMr. Sachs had been in ill health for the past several years. His illness was of a type that produced great suffering and no one except the patient and God himself will ever know the agonies this poor man endured through his many months of affliction. It became known several weeks ago that there was no hope for recovery for this good man, still when news of his death was wafted about our city early Saturday morning it caused many a pang of sorrow and deepest regret to pervade the hearts of all our people, for Mr. Sachs was truly a good and muchly beloved man.\n\nHis death occurred a few minutes after 11 o'clock Friday night. Funeral arrangements were made and the body transported to the Evangelical Church, where amid a great mass of people, mourning friends of the family, beautiful tributes were paid to deceased by Revs. Piepenbrok of Schulenburg and Meyer of Weimar, an appropriate song service was also held, participated in by members of the various choirs of the city. From the church the funeral assembly wended its way to the Masonic Cemetery, where all that was mortal of poor Herman Sachs was committed to the grave. Attendance at the funeral was about the largest ever witnessed at a similar gathering in Weimar, an ample manifestation of the love the people of this section had for this truly good man. And there were many sad and sorrowing hearts In that assembly!\n\nActive pall bearers at the funeral were Messrs. F. J. Nitschmann, C. G. Schietinger, Ed Rabel, John Mozisek, Adolf Schindler, Henry Brasher, Henry Guenther, Sr, Anton Beck.\n\nDeceased, Mr. Herman P. Sachs, was born in Germany May 19, 1866. He came to America at the age of 17 years, landing in Schulenburg Sept. 11, 1883. His work took him to Oakland, where he lived for a number of years, following the trade of blacksmith. On July 24, 1890, he was married to Miss Alvine Engels. Three children were born to them, two sons dying In infancy. One daughter, now Mrs. Hilda Wern, resides at La Grange.\n\nIn 1894, thirty-two years ago, he moved to Weimar to follow his trade of blacksmith. On March :1 1896 he accepted the Weimar agency for the San Antonio Brewing Association.\n\nHe was a man of public -spirit, being for awhile chief of the Weimar Fire Department, an alderman of our city; was one of the founders of the Weimar Evangelical church, served for twenty-five years on the board of trustees, and was often its president. He remained an active member of the church until the end, and one of his main grievances against his malady was that it prevented him from attending to his duties and services to his church. If we mistake not Mr. Sachs was also an almost life-long member of the Hermann Soehne Lodge.\n\nDuring the last three years he was repeatedly laid law with severe attacks of pain. In spite of the best medical attention it soon became apparent that the deteriorating forces of the malady could not be checked. He passed away Friday night at the age of 67 years, 4 months and 11 days.\n\nHe leaves to mourn his departure his grief-stricken widow, his daughter, Mrs. Chas. W. Wern, two grandchildren. Florence and George Wern, one sister, Mrs. Christoph Kelky of Breslau, and numerous relatives and many, many friends.\n\n\"Blessed are they who sleep In the Lord, for they rest In peace, and their works follow after them\".\n\nThe writer of these lines knew Herman Sachs when resided at Oakland, during the many years that elapsed after he moved to Weimar to become one of us\" and always felt that he was one of our best and truest friends. You always knew where Herman Sachs stood upon every question. He was outspoken for what he considered right and just, yet he tolerated the opinions of others, conceding that they, too, bad a right to their belief. This showed the greatness, the big heartedness of the man. He was a public spirited man at all times, generous to a fault, an honest, honorable, upright citizen, one who never tailed to do his part by his community or fellow-man, always \"a man among men.\" He was true to his convictions as he was true to his friends, and those of us who knew Herman Sachs through the score or two score years he spent among us realize that one of the biggest and best citizens we ever possessed has passed from among us.\n\nMay God comfort his bereaved ones is our heartfelt prayer!\n\nWeimar Mercury, October 13, 1933, page 1\n\nSachs, Herman P. jr.\n\nHerman Sachs, jr., the 10-months-old baby boy of Mr. and Mrs. Herman Sachs, died last Wednesday night of congestion, after a brief illness, and was buried Thursday afternoon at 3 oclock in the Odd Fellows cemetery. This is the second child these fond parents have lost by death, and they are almost prostrated with grief. God pity and comfort them in their distress, is the sincere wish of THE MERCURY.\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 9, 1895\n\nSachs, Oscar\n\nOakland Remarks\n\nDied, Tuesday morning at 8 a. m. little Oscar Sachs, aged 8 months, infant and only son of Mr. and Mrs. Herman Sachs.

He was able the day before his death to arise from his bed and walk to the door of his home and take a look at the outside. Everything looks just the same, he remarked, but I wont be here much longer. He realized that the end was near and said that he was ready for the call of his Master.\n\nIn the passing of Charles P. Salladay, Colorado County has lost one of its best citizens, for he was a good man  a gentleman. His honesty of purpose was never questioned. He was a friend. His heart was warned by the noble virtues praised by God and loved by men.\n\nAs the spirits of the just made perfect on high scan the pages that tell of those who lived and wrought in the little community of Chesterville, they will pause and read with joy the lines that record the lifework of Charles P. Salladay, and no doubt that great company of the blest will say, Here, truly was a man whose heart-beats echoed the heart-beats of the Master and whose hand, like His, lifted from his fellows every burden that it could. He has left a record for service that sought not altogether his own, for he looked not to a gathering that he might hold and enjoy, but rather to a scattering that those whose lives touched his might find earths pilgrimage more thickly settled with the jewels of comfort, cheer and happiness. It is great to leave a record like this when one steps from the shore of Time to the silent barge that bears him to Eternity  and truly it is. It is great to live so unselfishly and so well that when life ends, friends stand beside the casket and say I have lost a friend. It is great for one to have scattered the flowers of love with a lavish hand that when the heart is numb and the hand is cold flowers come as tributes of holy love from hearts that have been gladdened and blessed because he lived, ant to his loved ones he leaves a proud heritage that cannot vanish and which time can never tarnish  a good name.\n\nThe Headlight joins with all of the people of the entire community in extending to Mrs. Salladay and the two sons, and all others who are bowed down in grief, sympathy deep and sincere.\n\nEagle Lake Headlight, July 22, 1933\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nSalladay, Winnie (Campbell)\n\nMrs. Winnie Salladay Dies Friday\n\nFriends throughout the area were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Mrs. George (Winnie Campbell) Salladay, a resident here for most of her life.\n\nMrs. Salladay passed away Friday, January 19th in the Columbus Convalescent Home at 6 a.m. after two years of residence there.

The murder was undoubtedly committed Tuesday of last week, although the body of the murdered man, afterwards identified as K. Sandow, a vegetable peddler of Houston, who was en route home from San Antonio, was not discovered until late Thursday evening.\n\nThe man's truck was first noted by the side of the road late Tuesday and the body was found cold in death by Geo. W. Keith, near his farm, concealed in some bushes, late Thursday evening. It is evident the man was forced off the main highway from Houston to San Antonio, taken from his truck and shot to death then robbed of his money. as his pockets were turned inside out.\n\nThe murdered man was seen and recognized at Helmcamp's filling station in Schulenburg Tuesday, afterwards being seen at a filling station in Alleyton. At the last named place two rough looking men were with him, and he seemed to be fearful of them. It is believed these men forced him at point of pistol to leave the main highway, after which they murdered him.\n\nOne arrest was made a few days ago. but the party was released, as it was evident he had no connection with the crime. So far there is no clue to the murderers. The murdered man was of Japanese nationality.\n\nWeimar Mercury, October 24, 1930, page 1\n\nSandusky, Genevieve \"Susie\" (Hutchinson)\n\nGenevieve (Susie) Sandusky, 87, of Columbus, died Thursday, April 7, 1994, in Columbus.\n\nBorn Aug. 5, 1906 in Lincoln, KS, she was the daughter of George E. and Sarah Elizabeth (Young) Hutchinson.

Brandt residence, and about seven miles northeast of this city. The river was on a rise a the time. Young Eddie Sassin and his brother, Victor, were among the number who decided to go in bathing , altho' neither could swim. We are told that they were warned to keep out as it was not considered safe. Wading slowly in the muddy waters, they apparently did not realize their danger. We understand that young Victor Sassin first got into a deep \"step-off.\" As he went under and was struggling, his brother, Eddie, although himself unable to swim promptly went to his rescue. Both boys went under, but Eddie, so we are told, never came to the surface again. Victor was struggling and in a drowning condition, when a young man named Walla jumped in and managed to drag him out. The alarm was given and soon scores of men and boys were endeavoring to locate poor Eddie's body. The search continued all afternoon and night, but without results. Monday morning a large crowd went out from town and the search was renewed. Every known means of locating a drowned body was resorted to, but it was not until nearly noon that Jos. Knebel, while patrolling the banks of the river about a mile and a half from the spot where the boy was drowned, found him lying against a sandbar on the opposite side of the stream, the body partially submerged. Word was quickly sent to the others and the body soon afterward was brought to town, where it was taken in charge by Undertaker Klockmann and prepared for burial.\n\nThe funeral took place Tuesday morning from the family residence to St. Michael's Cemetery, services being conducted by Rev. J. Szymanski. The funeral was largely attended, and there were many expressions of sympathy for the bereaved parents, who so suddenly and unexpectedly have been deprived of a bright and loving son.\n\nYoung Eddie Sassin was an unusually bright, good boy. Throughout vacation he was employed at the store of Horak & Vacek, where his services were highly regarded both by the firm and their customers. Eddie was one of the young men from this city to go to the Citizens' Military Training[sic] Camp at San Antonio, and he had returned from said duties but a week prior to his death. Losing his life in an effort to save a younger brother proves that he was a hero in every sense of the term. His playmates and friends everywhere will sure miss his cheery presence.\n\nOur heartfelt sympathy goes out to the bereaved parents in the heavy and irreparable loss they have sustained.\n\nWeimar Mercury, September 7, 1823\n\nSassin, John V.\n\nJohn V.

After a protracted illness, Mrs. SALLIE SCATES, consort of W. B. Scates, Esq. Mrs. Scates was born in Alabama in 1814, came to Texas in early life, and in 1848 was happily married to Mr. Scates, (a Texas veteran) by whom six children were born, five of whom are now living. It is but a just tribute to the memory of one whose life and character exhibited so many lovely and noble virtues, to say that few were her equal, and none, perhaps, excelled her. Passing through many of the hardships and privations of early Texas history in company with her devoted husband, with that calm, patient and hopeful spirit that so beautifully distinguished him for all the relations of life, she had learned to know and fully meet the sacred responsibilities of wife and mother. Of Mrs. Scates it may be truly said: \"She was a true Christian,\" having professed religion at Osage, near which place she had lived for a number of years, and in the Cemetery at which place her remains were deposited. She made no ostentatious display of her piety. \"Having received Christ\" with retiring modesty and fidelity, she \"walked in him,\" and while the beauty of her Christian character was seen and admired by all, yet it was in the sacred precincts of home and home life that the purity of her heart and life were seen and felt. Her life was exemplary, pure, consistent and triumphant. Now\n\n\"Calm on the bosom of thy God\n\nFair spirit rest thee now.\n\nE'ven while in life thy footsteps trod.\n\nHis seal was on thy brow.\"\n\nTo the old, decrepit and deeply afflicted husband, and afflicted daughters, our heartfelt sympathies are tendered.

HENRY SCHAWE, LONG TIME CITIZEN OF WEIMAR, IS CLAIMED BY DEATH\n\nAt about 3 oclock Tuesday afternoon, the spirit of Mr. Henry Schawe, for many years a resident of Weimar, left its tenement of clay and passed unto its Creator, after an illness of several weeks. Mr. Schawe had been in feeble health for the past few years, due to his advanced age, but kept up and about the greater part of the time until but a comparatively short time before his death. Being a man of steady habits, he had a remarkable constitution for one of his age, and his longevity is due in a great measure to this cause. Surrounded by family and friends, he quietly passed away, resigned and willing to go and meet those who had gone on before.\n\nThe funeral took place Wednesday afternoon from the residence of his son-in-law, Chas. Fahrenthold, to the Masonic [Odd Fellows] Cemetery, the services being conducted by Rev. Paul Piepenbrok, Lutheran pastor and were attended by a large assemblage of mourning relatives and friends. The floral offerings were many and beautiful.\n\nMr. Schawe had lived in this city for many years. Of kindly, cheerful, friendly disposition, he ever had a pleasant greeting for all he met, and his presence in any assemblage was always welcomed. He was an honest, upright, good citizen, a man who had endured the hardships of early days in Texas, and who was ever willing to lend a helping hand to those less fortunate than himself. He had a splendid recollection of the early days of Texas, and it was a pleasure to listen to reminiscences he told.--of the struggles, hardships, and experiences of many of the early settlers of the Lone Star state. Mr. Schawe was an interesting character, the head of a large and prominent family circle, and his death has brought genuine sadness to the hearts of many citizens of this section.\n\nAn interesting sketch of the life of Mr. Schawe is given below, same being taken from a book entitled, History of Southwest Texas.\n\nAmong the prominent and progressive German citizens of Colorado county, and one of its most extensive land holders, is Henry Schawe, who is now living retired from active pursuits in the thriving town of Weimar. He is a man of strong and intelligent convictions, possessing fine business tact and judgment, and by his wise investments and excellent management has become quite well to do. A son of the late Heinrich Schawe, he was born April 20, 1832, in Perleberg, Prussia.\n\n“While living in the fatherland, Henry Schawe attended school very regularly, obtaining a substantial education, and also working as he had time on the home farm. Coming with his parents to Texas in 1847, he helped his father clear and improve a homestead in Brenham, remaining at home until attaining his majority. His father then presented him with a tract of land adjoining his own possessions, and for a short time he manage his farm successfully. Desirous of changing his occupation, Mr. Schawe sold out, and for four years was engaged in mercantile pursuits in Brenham. Disposing of his store and stock of goods, he then resumed farming, buying a tract of land near by, and there continuing until 1867. Selling that estate in 1867, Mr. Schawe, with his three brothers-in-law, bought three farms aggregating more than 300 acres, in Fayette county. Each of the partners had 175 acres as his own, the remainder of the land being held in partnership for a few years, when they sold out. Mr. Schawe was very successful in his agricultural labors, and at different times bought tracts of land in Fayette and Colorado counties. In 1879 he moved to a farm that he had purchased near Weimar and resided there for seven years. He then bought land in Victoria count, and was there profitably employed in agricultural pursuits for twelve years. He has since been a resident of Weimar, and retired from active labor although he is still an extensive land owner, having valuable tracts of land in Colorado and surrounding counties.\n\nMr. Schawe married in 1857 Mary Merintz . who was born in Germany, a daughter of Karl Merintz, who emigrated to Texas with his family in 1854, settling in Washington county. Mrs. Schawe died in 1898. Of the union five childen were born, namely: Adeline, wife of Charles Fahrenthold, of Weimar; Adolph, residing in Victoria county; Frederika, wife of Dr. Eugene Potthast of Weimar; Albert, living in Victoria county; and Otto, who was a practicing physician, died at the age of 29 years.\n\nWeimar Mercury, February 24, 1922\n\nSchawe, Mary (Merintz)\n\n(See Otto A. Schawe)\n\nSchawe, Otto A.\n\nDr. Otto Schawe, a well known physician of Ammannsville, and a son of Mr. and Mrs. Schawe of this city, died suddenly at his home at Ammannsville Wednesday night. He was in apparent good health on that day. He came to Weimar that morning to see his mother, who was sick, remained until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then returned home and went to see several patients, but kept up waiting on the sick until fully 11 o'clock p.m. Shortly after retiring for the night, his wife noticed him breathing heavily. She became alarmed and went to his side, but he was then in a dying condition, and lived only about ten minutes, his death being caused from heart failure. He was a young man of about 28 years, kind hearted, generous, with a large, practice, and the possessor of a large circle of friends. He leaves a wife and little daughter and many relatives and friends to mourn his death. His remains were laid to rest in the Odd Fellows' Cemetery this ( Friday) afternoon at 3 o'clock. Our sincere sympathy is extended the family in its sad hour of bereavement.\n\nWeimar Mercury, August 6, 1898\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nDr. Otto Schawe of Ammannsville, whose parents and some other relatives reside here and whose boyhood home was here, died suddenly at his home at Ammannsville, Wednesday night of last week, about midnight. He had been in Weimar that day to see his mother, who was and is quite sick and scarcely expected to recover, leaving here for home late in the evening. About 11 oclock that night he was waked by a party who came for prescription and medicine for a friend. The doctor attended to the matter, saying he would call the next morning if the patient were not better, and then retired again. In a short time his wife was awakened by his hard breathing. when she discovered that he was in a dying condition, and sent for a physician, who lived near; but Dr. Schawe was dead before the physician arrived. It is supposed that he died of heart failure. He was a young man, about 28 years old; left a widow and one child, Adeline, about two years old. Little Adeline had been sick with fever for several days when her father, died, and sad to say, her death occurred last Friday evening , about three hours after her father was buried here in the Odd Fellows cemetery, where her remains were also laid to rest next morning (Saturday.) Dr. Schawe had a great many friends both here and at Ammannsville, and the funeral procession that followed his remains to the grave last Friday evening was a very long one. The little girl [Adeline] died at the residence of Mr. Chas. Fahrenthold in Weimar, having been brought here by her mother, when she followed the remains of her husband from Ammannsville. The hearts of all in this community are keenly touched with sympathy for the bereaved ones in their sad affliction.\n\nSince writing the foregoing the death of Mrs. Marie [Mary] Schawe, wife of Mr. Henry Schawe and mother of Dr. Schawe, deceased, has occurred. She died Sunday evening, about 8 oclock, and was buried there Monday evening in the Odd Fellows cemetery, where her son was buried last Friday and her little grand-daughter the next day, as before stated in these locals. She had been in bad health about sixteen months; was a lady of many noble qualities and had many friends. She leaves a husband and four children, two sons and two daughters, Her daughters, Mrs. Dr. Potthast and Mrs. Chas. Fahrenthold, reside in Weimar. Her two surviving sons, Adolph and Albert Schawe, live in Victoria county. A large assembly of mourning friends followed her remains to the cemetery. On account of three deaths in the same family within a few days the hearts of the community are melting with sympathy.\n\nColorado Citizen, August 4, 1898\n\nScheller\n\n(Browse all obituaries with Scheller surname)\n\nSchenk\n\n(Browse all obituaries with Schenk surname)\n\nScherbig, Herman\n\nLast Rites Are Held Wednesday For Herman Scherbig\n\nFuneral services for Herman Scherbig, 61, who died near his home at Alleyton Monday evening of heart attack, were held Wednesday morning at ten oclock at Columbus Funeral Home.

Schetzing\n\nMrs. Emma Schetzing wife of the late M. Schetzing, died Tuesday morning at her home in Weimar, at the advanced age of 82 years, 6 months and 6 days. She had been ill about six weeks.\n\nFuneral services were held Wednesday afternoon at the Hubbard Funeral Home, with the Rev. C. Emigholz, local Evang. Lutheran minister, officiating. Interment was made in the Odd Fellows Cemetery.\n\nMrs. Schetzing was a daughter of the late Frederich and Amalie Seydler, and was born at High Hill in Fayette County, January 12, 1862. She was united in marriage to M. Schetzing on August 27, 1888. The couple spent most of their married life in Weimar, where Mr. Schetzing conducted a jewelry store for over half a century. Mrs. Schetzing was a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nThe Weimar Mercury, July 21, 1944\n\nTranscribed by Dennis Boatright\n\nSchetzing, Magnus\n\nOldest Business Man in Weimar Passes Away at Age of 88; Buried Wednesday\n\nFuneral services for Magnus Schetzing, 88, Weimar's oldest businessman, whose death occurred at his home here last Tuesday, were held from the family residence Wednesday afternoon, the Rev. R. Uhlhorn, Evangelical pastor officiating. Addtional tribute was paid by Weimar's Fire Department of which the deceased had been a 54-year member.\n\nThe deceased was a native of Rendzburg, province of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, where he was born Dec. 28, 1850, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Schetzing. There, as a youth, he was apprenticed as a watchmaker-jeweler. In 1881, emigrated to the United States, settling in the state of Virginia. He later moved to Marshall, Texas,.and moved from there to San Antonio, where he became associated with a pioneer jewelry firm. In 1885, he came to Weimar for a picnic. The next day, he decided to make the town his home, becoming one of Weimar's first businessmen. Until three months ago, he had continuously attended to his business of watchmaking-jewelry here.\n\nOn August 9, 1888 he married Miss Emma Seydler, who survives, in addition to a sister who resides in Germany.\n\nHe was a member of the Sons of Hermann Lodge and of the once flourishing Verein Froshinn Lodge, at one time Weimar's most active organization.\n\nInterment was in the Weimar Odd Fellows' Cemetery.\n\nIn the passing of M. Schetzing, Weimar residents are unanimous in feeling that they have lost one of this town's most interesting and likeable characters. The he had a high regard for his town is evidenced by the fact that way back there in 1885, while in Weimar to attend a picnic, Mr. Schetzing decided he liked Weimar so well he'd just stay here. And he did. Since that time, fifty-four years ago, he had continured in business daily, earning the title of Weimar's oldest business man, in point of service as well as in years.\n\nIntimate friends of the deceased declare that they never heard him speak ill of anyone--one of the highest tributes a man can pay another. Year after year, Mr. Schetzing attended to his own business, never meddling in another's. Most certainly, this was an admirable trait of character.\n\nMr. Schetzing was synonymous with Weimar. He arrived here when the town was a ten years old youngster. And he stayed here long enough to see it progress to a fine town with indications of every more outstanding progress.\n\nThe Mercury publisher joins with Mr. Schetzing's countless friends here in extending sincere sympathy to the widow of the deceased.\n\nWeimar Mercury, April 14, 1939\n\nSchietinger, Aline Leona (Loessin)\n\nAline Schietinger Funeral Services Held June 18\n\nFuneral services for Aline Leona Loessin Schietinger, 87, formerly of Weimar and Bay City, were held Wednesday, June 18, 2003 in the United Church of Christ in Weimar.\n\nThe Rev.
