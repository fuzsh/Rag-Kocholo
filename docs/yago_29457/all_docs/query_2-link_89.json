        "text": "During their vacation in Tuscany, Bjørn and Louise, a Danish couple, and their daughter Agnes, meet Patrick and Karin, a Dutch couple, and their son Abel, who suffers from congenital aglossia and was born without a tongue. A few weeks later, Bjørn and Louise receive an invitation from the Dutch couple to visit their remote rural house in the Netherlands, which they accept. After eight hours of driving, the family arrives at their destination. During the first two days, Louise feels uncomfortable about the hosts' passive-aggressive behaviors, such as Patrick's ignorance about her vegetarianism, his abusive behavior towards Abel, and Karin's swearing.\n\nThe hosts invite their guests out for dinner, but Louise is concerned because the children are not coming and have to stay with Abel's babysitter, Muhajid. Her concerns are exacerbated at the dinner when Patrick challenges her vegetarianism, and the couple drunkenly make out in front of them. After manipulating Bjørn into paying for the dinner, Patrick repeatedly plays loud music while driving under the influence, upsetting Louise. He enters the bathroom while she is taking a shower, and later observes the couple having sex. When Agnes' calls to sleep next to her parents are ignored, Patrick takes her into their bed. After Louise finds Agnes sleeping on the bed next to a naked Patrick, she wakes her husband and the family leaves, only to turn back shortly thereafter, after Agnes realizes that her rabbit doll Ninus is missing.\n\nBack at the house, they are confronted about their sudden departure by the hosts, who now act disappointed. Bjørn fails to be blunt, so Louise enumerates the things that made her uncomfortable. Patrick and Karin eventually convince their guests to stay. The women work in the yard, while the men buy groceries. On their way back, Bjørn and Patrick bond as the former attempts to explain how he often suppresses his emotions, compromising his true self. Patrick takes him to a beach where they practice screaming therapy. Later, when Louise cuts her finger in the kitchen, the couple discover that Patrick lied about being a doctor to impress them and is actually unemployed, as he doesn't believe in actual work. After the dinner, the children perform a dance that they had practiced together; Patrick treats Abel abusively for his mistakes. He throws a mug, a gift from Bjørn and Louise, at the wall, and the couples argue over the apparent abuse.\n\nThat night, Bjørn discovers a cabin behind the house, and finds a collection of empty luggage and cameras inside. The cabin's walls are covered with photographs of Patrick and Karin with other couples with young children on holidays. They suggest the Dutch couple are serial killers with a pattern of deceiving families in order to murder them and abduct their children. Bjørn realizes that he and his family are the couple's next victims. On his way to collect his family, Bjørn finds Abel's body drowned in the pool. They successfully escape, but Bjørn does not tell his wife about his discovery.\n\nAfter their car breaks down, Bjørn is forced to leave and search for help in the vicinity, but returns to find his family inside Patrick's car, after Louise apparently called them for help, unaware of Bjørn's discovery. He obeys Patrick for the sake of his family's safety, remaining silent in the car. When Louise eventually becomes suspicious, Patrick orders her to remain silent and begins to beat Bjørn into submission. Patrick stops the car, Muhajid arrives and holds down Louise while Karin cuts off Agnes' tongue. Muhajid leaves with Agnes, and her parents are taken to a deserted road. Before the Danish couple are asked to get undressed, Bjørn asks them why they are doing this to them, to which Patrick calmly replies: \"Because you let me.\"[6][7][8] Bjørn and Louise are then asked to get into a ditch, where they are subsequently stoned to death. Some time later, a mute Agnes forcibly plays the role of Patrick's and Karin's daughter as the couple targets another vacationing family for their next murder. (thanks to Wikipedia)"
