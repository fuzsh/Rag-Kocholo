The second child of Prince Harald of Denmark, son of King Frederick VIII of Denmark and Princess Louise of Sweden, and Princess Helena of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, daughter of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Princess Caroline-Mathilde grew up at Jægersborghus. In 1933, she married her first cousin, Prince Knud of Denmark, the second son of King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine of Denmark. The couple had three children; Princess Elisabeth, Count Ingolf and Count Christian (the only one to have children of his own). From 1947 to 1953, Prince Knud was heir presumptive of his brother King Frederick IX, however the change in the constitution in 1953 caused Prince Knud to lose his place in the succession to his niece, the now Queen Margrethe II. After the change, the couple were given the titles of Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess, but the matter caused a deep rift between the two families which has not completely healed even today. The family resided at the Sorgenfri Palace and at the Klitgården, and continued to undertake some official duties, even after Hereditary Prince Knud’s death in 1976, until the Princess died on this day in 1995.\n\nQueen Alexandrine’s Fringe Tiara | Russian Sapphire Tiara | Princess Thyra’s Sapphire Tiara"
