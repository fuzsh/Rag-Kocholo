        "text": "I had an opportunity to meet the State President, H.E. Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera yesterday, at a presidential function in Balaka where he officially launched the new phase of loan disbursement to the business youths and women clubs. Two Hon members of parliament for Balaka West and Mangochi North constituencies were in attendance. We happily shared smiles of hope for bright future.\n\nThe elective convention for our Malawi Congress Party is around the corner. We intend to present ourselves as an alternative choice for delegates on the position of National Director of International Affairs. We are more determined to assist the party in constructing international bridges for effective conduct of our development diplomacy. Join us in securing this position at the convention.\n\nDetermined to support the President secure re-election on 16th September 2025. The preparation is now, competing on the position of National Director of International Affairs for the ruling Malawi Congress Party.\n\nI was privileged to pass through Heathrow Airport on my way back home from MCGILL university, Canada where I attended a Parliamentary Governance conference.\n\nWe are campaigning very hard to secure a position in the Malawi Congress Party's National Executive Committee. Join us in mobilizing more support towards this campaign. Building International Bridges for effective conduct of development diplomacy is our core focus. Establishing MCP as an international political party to reckon with, is essentially our motivation to compete at higher level.\n\nJust seeking to broaden my political network so as to establish strategic friendship with Icelandic, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Canadian politicians. I believe in the power of networks to learn and relearn new things, and if necessary; unlearn. +265993512249 Email: ephraim73kayembe@yahoo.com"
