        "text": "Abel Cathrine_Bjorn_Ingebrigt\n\nHome\n\nAbel Cathrine, Bjorn and Ingebrigt\n\nAbel Cathrine, born October 8, 1809 at Sandeid in Vikedal, Norway was the first of five children born to Bernhardus Arnoldus and Cecelia Sophie Moller at Nyvold on Vestbogaard in Sandeid. The others were Soren de Fine, Bernhard Wilhelm, Arnoldine Cecilia and Hans Christian Frorup. Reared in the same neighborhood as Bjorn Kvelve, Abel Cathrine undoubtedly met him at the church in Vikedal where both families attended services. Their courtship was frowned upon and her family would not consent to their marriage, for in their eyes he was beneath their social class.\n\nTwice Abel Cathrine was sent away to live with relatives in Bergen... to hopefully forget this suitor, but to no avail. Had the aristocratic background of the Kvelve family been common knowledge at the time, it probably would not have changed the von Krogh attitude toward this alliance. Bjorn and his more recent predecessors were now of farming stock. In July 1831, the young couple were married and it is reported her father, Bernhardus, broke his sword as a sign of this disgrace brought upon his family.\n\nThe young couple settled down on a gaard known as Ege and in addition to farming, Bjorn owned a small sloop in which he carried on a coasting trade -carrying fish and produce to Stavanger in exchange for goods. In these trading pursuits with Stavanger, Bjorn met and sympathized with the Quakers and his being identified with this belief brought upon him at least the social stigma of a religious dissenter toward the Norwegian state church. Bjorn could gather a crowd around him outside of public buildings to listen to his criticisms of Norwegian laws and the office-holding class. Meanwhile, Abel Cathrine, ostracized by family and friends, found life somewhat less than agreeable. I t was no wonder that when word came to this pair and their two small boys that a ship was being outfitted to sail to the \"new world\" that Bjorn was an enthusiastic supporter of the venture.\n\nIt is said he recruited so many friends and acquaintances that a second ship was needed to transport them all. So it was that in Spring, 1836, two brigs, the \"Norden\" and \"Den Norske Klippe\", set sail for the \"promised land\". Abel Cathrine, Bjorn, Arnoldus Andreas, aged four, and Augustinus Meldahl Bruun, age two, were passengers on the \"Norden\" which set sail the first Sunday after Pentacost and landed in New York on July 12, 1836.\n\nThe ship carried 110 passengers and was filled to capacity. A letter from its Captain to a friend, states the \"passage was cold, wet and stormy\". Passengers caught severe colds, probably from lack of sufficient clothing, especially on the legs (the Captain recommended that future immigrants provide themselves with wooden shoes). His letter also refers to illness of nursing infants incurred from their mothers. Repeatedly he speaks of the voyage as having gone very well, although the ship's manifest lists five deaths... four of which were very young children. The Captain also mentions the admiration shown by Americans as the immigrants debarked in New York in their brightly-colored best clothes with most genteel manners.\n\nMost of these passengers went directly on to the Fox River settlement in LaSalle County, Illinois; however, the Bjorn Anderson family, with its newly adopted name (from Bjorn's father's Christian name, Anders) elected to stay a year in Rochester, New York with Lars Larson of the first 1825 sailing who made his home available to many of his countrymen. This delay in New York was no doubt due to the birth of a daughter who lived but a short time... the first to be named Elizabeth , after whom Elizabeth Danielson became the second. (This first Elizabeth may have been still-born, for we note that Lester Hansen omitted her from the numbering system in the genealogy.) Here Bjorn helped his neighbors by serving as \"cooper\" or barrel-maker in the Rochester settlement. Cooper is equivalent to today's \"carpenter\" and he received the name \"Tondebjorn\" that is, \"Barrel-Bjorn\". This nickname clung to him thereafter.\n\nIn the Spring of 1837 they came by canal and steamer through the Great Lakes to the town of Mission, known today as Norway, Illinois. The first six months they shared the cabin of Karl Nelson, sister of Cleng Peerson, credited with being the \"father\" of Norwegian immigration. Later, Bjorn built a small log house on the property of Endre Dahl. He did not consider the land in this area suitable and supported himself during this three year period by working for his neighbors, being an able handyman. In 1840 he set out with several companions to explore Wisconsin in search of a permanent home. They chose the Koshkonong Prairie near what is now Albion in Dane County. Here Bjorn bought 40 acres and returned to Illinois for the winter to wait for favorable weather to transport his family (now increased by two daughters... the second Elizabeth and Cecelia) to their new home.\n\nBjorn had acquired with his earnings two steers, a cow and her calf and these, with wagon, moved the family north. The Bjorn Andersons were the first couple to settle at the Koshkonong settlement and their daughter, Martha, became the first white child born in the area, and perhaps in Dane County. Bjorn's bachelor friends who had built shanties before the Anderson arrival, sheltered the family until their own cabin was built. In time the 40 acres was increased to 230 and wheat was raised, some of which was hauled to Milwaukee in exchange for necessities. Abel Cathrine made all the clothes for her children, their garments often identical. Indians were fortunately friendly neighbors... their nearest camp adjacent to the Anderson property.\n\nBjorn was a strong advocate of education and employed teachers for his children... one of which lived with them for his board. Bjorn built the first schoolhouse largely at his own expense; later donating it to the district. Though he was a dissenter to the structured Norwegian Lutheran Church, it was said his son Bruun could recite one of the gospels by memory. Bjorn would have his children read to him from the Bible as he rested from his labors.\n\nWhen all looked very encouraging and prosperous the cholera epidemic swept the area. According to an account by Rasmus, born in 1846, not a family was spared and there was fear it would take the whole community. He says they all came down with it and young Bruun at age 16 was the first to die on August 6th, 1850. The grieving father lay out on his son's grave until the family realized he, too, had the disease. On August 10th, Bjorn succumbed and was also carried to the little area set aside for burial purposes, roadside at the old homestead.\n\nAbel Cathrine was now a widow with seven children and one \"on the way\". Early in the following year, 1851, she had the children baptized by a newly-arrived Methodist minister, Christian Willerup, who probably performed this rite in the home. Brown was born in April of that year, eight months after his father's death. Also in this year there is data telling of the construction of a more permanent home (part of which is still standing). One wonders if the neighbors built this for the widow and her brood of eight. Herein lies a tale for which we have no facts. Abel Cathrine and her family had previously returned to the Lutheran faith in which she was reared. A first cousin was the wife of Pastor A. C. Preus, who came to Koshkonong in 1850 from Norway, founding the Norwegian Synod there in 1853.\n\nIn 1854, Cathrine married Ingebrigt Amundson. Ingebrigt was the elder of two sons and would have, by law, inherited the farm which, according to Ken and Eleanor Brown who visited there in 1984, is on flat land and as fine an acreage as any beautiful Wisconsin tract. Nevertheless, Ingebrigt left all to his brother, Ola, when he caught the \"fever\" that brought him to America.\n\nIngebrigt Amundson and Abel Cathrine Anderson were married by Pastor Preus of the Koshkonong Norwegian Lutheran Synod. She was somewhat older than he but obviously of such charm, pulchritude, and capabilities that this young bachelor chose to fill the void of husband and father. A son was born to Abel Cathrine and Ingebrigt in April 1855 by the name of Albert Christian and it is his descendants who have lived close to the original homesite throughout their years. 'We know that Andrew and Elizabeth left the home to be married-but know little else of what transpired during the seven years of the second marriage which terminated with the death of Ingebrigt in July of 1861.\n\nAgain a widow, Cathrine stayed on the farm until the three remaining daughters were married and Rasmus, Abel and Brown were on their own. In an attempt to make Rasmus a farmer, she deeded the homestead to him. She then lived briefly with Cecelia but settled permanently with Dina and Pastor Torgerson in Worth County, Iowa until her death. When Abel Cathrine with her youngest son, Albert Amundson, came to the Torgerson household she brought with her articles which included her bed, her loom, and her spinning wheel. The parsonage was then a simple log house... a new manse was built in 1881 for which Cathrine had woven enough carpeting to cover the 20 by 20 parlor floor.\n\nA special room was built for her in the southeast corner, with a door leading into the kitchen. A corner of the large kitchen served as her sitting roan and workshop. Here was her spinning wheel in front of a window shaded by a porch roof. Her busy fingers were constantly spinning the wheel, sewing or knitting... even during social functions... seldom idol save for periods of devotion when she would fold them in her lap.\n\nDuring her last illness, but a few days before her death, all but Rasmus (now serving as Minister to Denmark) gathered together around their mother. It was at this time that the well-known family picture was taken by a professional photographer... in which Rasmus' picture is shown being held. She died on a Saturday evening, October 31, 1885 and services on Koshkonong prairie were held the following Thursday, November 5th, at the East Koshkonong church by Pastor J. A. Otteson. Pallbearers included Martin Hollo who then owned the old homestead. There were forty to fifty carriages in the procession to the gravesite where lay her two husbands, a son and infant grand-daughter. A beautiful arch of evergreens, 12 feet high, had been placed over the gate and altogether the scene was a very impressive one ... long to be remembered by the family and her many friends."
