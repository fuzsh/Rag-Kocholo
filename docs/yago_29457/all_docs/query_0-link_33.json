No information has yet been found about the history of the territory before Lothar von Süpplingenburg Duke of Saxony increased Saxon authority there with the help of Adolf von Schauenburg, whom he enfeoffed in 1111 with the county of Holstein-Stormarn in the area north and east of Hamburg . The new county was created as a sub-fief of the king/emperors of Germany and remained subject to indirect imperial jurisdiction until the 19th century. The new counts were strongly opposed by the native nobility. The first period of crisis opened when Count Adolf II refused to recognise Albrecht \"der Bär\" as duke of Saxony in 1138, after the death of Emperor Lothar. Count Adolf was deposed and replaced as count by Heinrich von Badewide, although Adolf was restored in [1142/43].\n\nThe duchy of Schleswig, located in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula to the north of Holstein, was under Danish influence. The first identified reference to Schleswig as a separate jurisdictional entity is the appointment by Niels King of Denmark of his nephew Knud Erikssen \"Lavard/the Lord\" as count in Sønderjylland [Schleswig] in 1115. After the murder of Knut \"Lavard\" in 1131, it is assumed that the territory was reincorporated into the Danish crown, although this has not been verified. The history of Schleswig during the Danish succession wars of the 1140s/1150s is confusing, the area passing between all rival claimants to the Danish crown, and even at one time being claimed as an imperial fief by the king of Germany. Saxo Grammaticus records that Knud Henrikssen, son of Henrik Svendsen \"Skadelår/the Limper\" of Denmark, tried to usurp the duchy of Schleswig in [1150/51] . His rival, Valdemar Knudssen (later Valdemar I \"den Store/the Great\" King of Denmark), was awarded a Danish province, presumably Schleswig although this is not specified in the source, by Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" King of Germany at the diet of Merseburg, called in 1152 by the German king to resolve the disputed Danish succession , although imperial control over the territory was no more than wishful thinking on the part of the king. Another rival, Svend III \"Grade\" King of Denmark, sought help from Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony to maintain his throne. The Saxon duke invaded Jutland at end 1156, captured Schleswig and Ripen, but returned to Saxony in Jan 1157 . Knud Henrikssen's brother Buris Henrikssen is recorded as Duke of Schleswig in 1162. The duchy is subsequently recorded in the hands of Christoffer Valdemarsen, illegitimate son of King Valdemar I, who died in 1173. A degree of continuity in the rulers of Schleswig followed the appointment of Abel, son of King Valdemar II, as duke. After Abel succeeded as Danish king, he appointed his older son Valdemar as duke in 1254. When the young Valdemar died in 1257, the duchy passed to his younger brother Erik, with whose descendants it remained until the death of Erik's great-grandson Duke Valdemar VI in 1364.\n\nFollowing a further period of reintegration with the Danish crown, the territories of Holstein and Schleswig were united under the same leadership for the first time when Gerhard VI Graf von Holstein-Rendsburg was appointed duke of Schleswig in 1386. However, as Schleswig remained outside imperial jurisdiction, it was never united politically with its southern neighbour the imperial fief of Holstein, despite the personal unity achieved through its new common leadership. On the death without direct heirs in 1459 of Duke Adolf XI, son of Duke Gerhard VI, his nephew Christian I King of Denmark, son of Adolf's deceased sister Hedwig, was elected Graf von Holstein and Duke of Schleswig, the jurisdictional separation of the territories being emphasised once more with the continuation of the dual title.\n\nThe primary sources which confirm the parentage and marriages of the counts of Holstein and dukes of Schleswig have not been identified, unless otherwise shown below.\n\nChapter 1. GRAFEN von HOLSTEIN\n\nA. GRAFEN von HOLSTEIN und STORMARN 1111-1208, GRAFEN von SCHAUMBURG\n\nADOLF [I] von Schauenburg, son of --- (-[13 Nov] 1131, bur Minden Benedictine Abbey) .

The town of Lübeck was destroyed by fire in 1157. It was rebuilt by Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony, to whom Graf Adolf transferred the site in 1159. Lübeck was administered by bailiffs appointed by the duke , later developing into a free town governed by its own corporation. Graf Adolf II was killed in battle, allied with the Saxons against the Obotrites, at Verchen, west of Demmin on the Kummerower See .
