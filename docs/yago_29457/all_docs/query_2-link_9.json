        "text": "Cain, in the Bible (Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament), firstborn son of Adam and Eve who murdered his brother Abel (Genesis 4:1â€“16). Cain, a farmer, became enraged when the Lord accepted the offering of his brother, a shepherd, in preference to his own. He murdered Abel and was banished by the Lord from the settled country. Cain feared that in his exile he could be killed by anyone, so the Lord gave him a sign for his protection and a promise that if he were killed, he would be avenged sevenfold.\n\nThe biblical story may have intended to explain why a certain tribe, called Cain, had a special tattoo mark and why this tribe always severely avenged any murdered member. The story also may explain why that tribe lived the nomadic rather than the settled life. Some biblical critics believe the tribe of Cain was the Kenites."
