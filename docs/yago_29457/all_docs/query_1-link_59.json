        "text": "Subjects of the King of Denmark –\n\ntheir Genealogical Impact on South Africa\n\nby Mansell G. Upham ©\n\nAttend! We have heard of the thriving of the throne of Denmark, how the folk-kings flourished in former days, how those royal athelings earned that glory.\n\n– Beowulf\n\nThe Danish historical, cultural and genetic admixture to the peopling of South Africa has yet to be appreciated more thoroughly. The vast documentable progeny (mostly classified as ‘white’ under apartheid) born out of South Africa’s first mixed marriage between Copenhagen-born Pieter Meerhoff (c. 1637-1667) and his Cape of Good Hope aboriginal Goringhaicona wife Krotoa, baptised Eva (c. 1643-1674)[1] deserves special mention. For a country that was actively opposed to apartheid in South Africa, it is remarkable what little knowledge modern-day Danes have about their colonial and historical ties with South Africans. Alan H. Winquist in his Scandinavians & South Africa: Their impact on cultural, social and economic development before 1900 has listed the names of Danes who emigrated to South Africa for the period (1700-1825). A great many immigrants to the Cape of Good Hope and further afield were also subjects of the Danish crown. These originated from Danish-controlled territories that are now parts of the present-day Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDENMARK’S COLONIAL EMPIRE\n\nI wander and sail restlessly,\n\nI wear out a hundred soles and shoes,\n\nThe whole world’s orb and curious globe,\n\nBoth where it is hot and where it is cold,\n\nWill properly visit …\n\nHurrah, blue-coated Danish lad!\n\nRun up the flag, and the ship’s for us!\n\nWe’ll soon be flying away.\n\nPeter Møller, Farvel Min Velsignede Fødeby\n\n(Farewell, my blessed native farm! … translated from the Danish by Ken Tindall)\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark – which still includes Greenland – is one of the few European powers that has succeeded in playing down its role in the international slave trade and its colonial domination of parts of the non-European world. Being the first European country to abolish the trading of slaves[2], Denmark has managed somewhat to deflect attention from itself by giving Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) ‘home rule’ and by being the most vocal and progressive nation-state to advocate the international recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples worldwide at the United Nations (UN). Denmark’s colonial possessions, although modest in relation to the British, Dutch and French, included places on the west coast of Africa and both the East and West Indies.\n\nDANISH COLONIAL POSSESSIONS & THEIR FORTS\n\nDanish East Indies (1619-1844)\n\nIndian Sub-continent: Bay of Bengal / Coromandel Coast\n\nBaraganar (Bengal)\n\nTrankebar (Tranquebar) ‘village on the wave’ (1619-1845) – sold to England – Fort Dansborg (built 1620) by Ove Gjedde\n\nWest Africa (Gold Coast) (1649-1850)\n\nFort Frederiksborg (1649) – sold to England in 1680s\n\nFort Christiansborg (1661) – located within present-day Accra, Ghana) sold to England in 1849\n\nFort Fredensborg\n\nFort Kongensten\n\nFort Prinsensten\n\nFort Carlsborg at Cabo Corso – near Accra (1656-1657) – established by the Swedes in 1650, it was captured in the Danish-Swedish war of 1656-1657 from the Swedes but returned; later it fell into Dutch hands in 1663.\n\nDanish West Indies (1672-1817)\n\nSt Thomas & St Jan islands (1672-1917)\n\nSt. Croix island – bought from France – (1733-1917) – all sold to the USA: now the Virgin Islands\n\nFort Christiansted (Sankt Croix)\n\nSugar Islands\n\nDanish East India Company\n\nThe Danish East India Company is founded (1618) during the reign of Christian IV (1596-1648) whose reconstruction of Copenhagen includes the building of Europe’s largest and most modern naval arsenal. As a major sea power, Denmark soon participates in colonial expansionism and the slave trade – not unlike the English, Dutch and French.\n\nDenmark’s chief possession in Asia is the factory and fort at Tranquebaer [Trankebar]. Annual tribute is paid by Danish governors to the Tanjore kings – starting with Raghunatha Nayak (1600-1634) and ending with Sivaji (1832-1855) in terms of a written treaty. Some of the clauses of the treaty in question are worth quoting as they reveal the extent and sophistication (including vagueness) of negotiated trade relations that existed at the time between European and Asian powers:\n\nWe are committed always to defend the Danes throughout all our territories against hostility of any kind and against all hostile people, and we must, moreover, assist them in their affairs in accordance with their demands.\n\nThe Danes may deal not only with all our vassals and subjects, but also with all foreigners who enter our territories.\n\nOur subjects shall never be allowed fraudulently to alter or unlawfully to sell their merchandise to the subjects of the King of Denmark.\n\nWe shall never permit other Europeans or other Indians to trade or carry out any dealings or other activities in any of our territories with the sole with the sole exception of the Danes and the Portuguese in Nagapatnam.\n\nIn the course of their trade throughout our territories, the Danes shall always be permitted to use the money of the King of Denmark, which money is called Danish silver crowns, and moreover Singhalese silver larins, and the value of each crown shall be 14 or 15 gold fanoes, depending on its price.\n\nThose who deal in counterfeit coins shall forfeit their lives, and they shall moreover forfeit their property, the property of the Danes shall go to the King of Denmark and the property of our subjects shall go to Ourself.\n\nThe Danes and the Cape of Good Hope\n\n… Wan künstig die Dänen aus Nordissen landt sich nach dir thun ahnen dir werden bekandt.\n\n… If in future the Danes from northernmost lands come sailing your lanes, pray treat them like friends.\n\nJan Pietersz: Cortemünde\n\nThe Danes are the first Scandinavians to visit Table Bay, the first being the fleet under Ove Gjedde (1594-1660) en route to India in July 1619.[3] Thereafter numerous ships stop over either en route to or returning from the East. Particular mention should be made of the royal ship Oldenborg, captained by Barent Andersen Fischer which sail (23 April 1672) and calls at the Kap det gode håb in December 1672 (leaving 6 January 1673). On board is Amsterdam-born Jan Pietersz: Cortemünde [Hans Petersen Kertminde] (of Danish parentage). His original manuscript account of his travels to the East Indies via the Cape of Good Hope has been preserved and is housed in the Kongelige Bibliotek (Royal Library) in Copenhagen.\n\nDanish Ships stopping over at the Cape of Good Hope\n\n1619/1621 : 4 (Elephant, David, Christian, Copenhagen)\n\n1623 : 2 (Christianhaven & Flensborg)\n\n1652-1661 : None\n\n1672-1700 : 9 (Oldenborg 1672, Gulden Leeuw, Goede Hoop, Vliegende Wolf & Antoinette 1688, Charlotte Amelia 1690, Christianus Quintus 1695, 1698 &1700, Prins Fredrick 1697 & 1699, Princess Louise 1698)[4]\n\n1700-1714 : 42\n\n1715-1724 : 10\n\n1725-1750 : 47\n\n1751-1771 : 31 (Table Bay) & 13 (Simon’s Bay)\n\n1772-1780 : 41 (Table Bay) & 17 (Simon’s Bay)\n\n1781-1784 : 62 (Table Bay) & 22 (Simon’s Bay)\n\n1785-1789 : 70\n\n1794 : 11\n\nNevertheless the Dutch East India Company (VOC)­ is mostly responsible for the continual influx of Danes in its employ to the Cape of Good Hope and not so much the Danish East India Company. The majority of these officials and immigrants (and residents) at the Cape and further afield, however, are invariably subjects of the Danish crown originating from Danish-controlled territories rather than from what we know as Denmark today.\n\nThe Danish East India Company and Danish ships, however, were most active in the slave trade and were responsible for the sale of many slaves at the Cape. As early as 1688 four ships from Denmark returning from the East called by the Dutch:\n\nGulden Leeuw\n\nGoede Hoop\n\nVliegende Wolf\n\nAntoinette\n\ncall at the Cape. Some slaves were sold at the Cape. The sale of slaves at the Cape by Danes increases considerably during the last decade of the 17th century. At this point the Danes are bringing more slaves to the Cape than their rivals the English.[5] The slaves they bring are mostly from the Coromandel Coast, Trankebar and Madagascar.\n\nHOGE’S PERSONALIA REVISTED\n\nThe pioneering work by Dr J. Hoge on ‘German’ emigration to the Cape up to the time of the Second British Occupation entitled Personalia of the Germans at the Cape 1652-1806 [6] remains a major reference work. How many researchers, however, realise that Hoge, in compiling such a comprehensive personalia, appropriated a great many subjects of the Danish Crown who were not all necessarily ‘German’? Considering that Germany was a latter-day nationalistic invention, and bearing in mind the consequent amnesia of the Schleswig-Holstein question once the beleaguered Danish territories fell prey to an expanding Prussian-driven German Empire, it was perhaps politically expedient at the time for the Hamburg-born Hoge to contain these folk as ‘Germans’.\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope, is a Dutch VOC-occupied (and later Batavian Republican) colony. This fact creates the impression that colonial emigrants to the tip of Africa are only or mostly Dutch in their ethnic and cultural make-up. To explain that there are a great many Germans too is no easy task. How then to explain a Danish connection that included all sorts of marsh or lowland folk, including eastern and even northern Frisians? How many people are aware that Frisians now find themselves on either side of the present-day border separating the Kingdom of the Netherlands from the Federal Republic of Germany? Why is it that still today people in Ost Friesland are ridiculed as the buffoons or the Koos Van der Merwes of Germany?\n\nTo understand such complexities, it may help to consider the former titles of the Danish monarch. The present monarch of Denmark, Queen Margrethe II, whose full names are Margrethe Ingrid Thorhildur, is a member of the Slesvig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Glücksborg branch of the House of Oldenborg. Denmark is Europe’s oldest existing monarchy. On her accession to the Danish throne in 1972, she renounced her claims to the following titles: Queen of the Wends and Goths, Duke of Slesvig, Holste(i)n, Stomarn, Ditmarsken, Lauenborg, and Oldenborg.\n\nComparing the royal arms of Denmark at the time of Christian IV (1588-1648) and just prior to the amendments made at the instigation of the present Queen, we get a clearer picture about these titles and the areas they represent. The arms of Christian IV represent the following areas of sovereignty:\n\nDanmark (Denmark),\n\nNorge (Norway)[7],\n\nKalmar-unionen (the Union of Kalmar)[8],\n\nDe Gothers (the Goths / Got(h)land)[9],\n\nDe Venders (the Wends)[10],\n\nSlesvig (Schleswig)[11],\n\nHolsten (Holstein)[12],\n\nStormarn[13],\n\nDitmarsken (the Ditmarsh)[14],\n\nOldenborg (Oldenburg)[15] and\n\nDelmenhorst[16].\n\nThe royal arms for the period 1948-1972 depict:\n\nDenmark,\n\nSlesvig,\n\nthe Union of Kalmer,\n\nFaroe Island,\n\nGreenland,\n\nthe Goths (Gotland),\n\nthe Wends,\n\nHolsten,\n\nStormarn,\n\nDitmarsken,\n\nLauenborg[17],\n\nOldenborg and\n\nDelmenhorst.\n\nThe amended royal arms, with the exception of the device for the Union of Kalmar, only depict symbols currently reflecting the reality of a much reduced Denmark:\n\nDenmark,\n\nSlesvig,\n\nOldenborg,\n\nFaroe Islands and\n\nGreenland.\n\nClearly, our concepts of ‘Danish’, ‘German’ and ‘Dutch’ need clarification depending on the historical context. South Africa is a major beer-drinking country. The names Hansa and Holsten are household names to many of us. But how many of us are aware of the impact that the Hanseatic League and the area (now better known by its German spelling) Holstein – have had on South Africans of non-indigenous heritage? First we need to look at the legacy of the Hanseatic League which preceded Denmark’s domination of the Baltic and Northern Europe and its contemporaneous rivalry and consequent cross-pollination with the Dutch.\n\nTHE HANSEATIC LEAGUE: ITS LEGACY AND IMPACT ON THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE\n\nHanse Towns was a name given to certain seaport towns of Germany, which entered into a mutual league (hansa) against the pirates of the Baltic and the feudal lords of the neighbouring mainland. The Hanseatic League was first formed in 1241, between Hamburg and Lübeck. It gradually extended until it comprehended 66 cities, but began to decline, as commerce found new channels, towards the end of the 15 century, and was dissolved in 1630.[18] The Hanseatic cities were mainly German trade cities with Lübeck as its head:\n\nHamburg\n\nVisby (on the island of Gotland)\n\nCopenhagen\n\nRostock\n\nBremen\n\nHamburg\n\nFlensburg\n\nRendsburg and\n\nKiel.\n\nThe Hansa, a league of north German and northern European ports and trading centres flourished in the later Middle Ages, but was already weakened in the 16th century by the growth of independent Netherlands and English trade, and by the political consolidation of the Nordic kingdoms. The Hansa finally collapsed after the unproductive hansetag (assembly of the Hansa city representatives) in 1669.[19] The League controlled all the exports (especially the fishing industry) in Denmark. The centre of this was at the southwestern corner of Scania [traditionally part of Denmark but now southern Sweden]. Here every autumn more than 20 000 people fished, cleaned, dried and salted herring to meet the demands of the growing European market due to the ever increasing fasting, imposed by the Church. In the 15th century four days of the week were meatless. Danish people did the manual work, but the Hanseatics furnished the barrels and the salt (from Lüneburg, south of Hamburg), handled the sale and pocketed the profit.[20] The Hansa monopoly of Baltic trade began to decline from 1511 onwards.\n\nTo what extent have we looked at the movement of peoples in northern Europe during this period of heightened and consolidated economic activity? Once the Dutch and Danes interacted economically and the VOC attracted foreign labour from the rest of Europe, how would this influence the genealogical make-up of the early Cape settler population? What about the confluence of Low German, Dutch, Frisian and Danish and all the other dialects found in the Hansa areas of northern Europe? What influence did these languages and dialects have on the Afrikaans language? Is it a coincidence that in both the Danish (also Norwegian and Swedish) and Afrikaans languages (unlike Dutch and English), the verb does not conjugate and that so much of the vocabulary is remarkably similar?\n\nDUTCH AND GERMAN INFLUENCE IN COPENHAGEN\n\nHow many people in South Africa are aware of the Dutch influence on Denmark in the 17th century? The extent of Netherlands shipping in the Baltic and through the Sound was also responsible for movements (and settlements elsewhere) of peoples from their native lands. It was a Dutchman whom Christian IV dispatched as ambassador to Trankebar. The Dutch employed a great many Danish subjects in the VOC which explains the presence of so many of these people at the Cape of Good Hope who did not necessarily arrive on Danish ships.\n\nChristian IV (1588-1648) made use of Dutch architects when rebuilding the centre of Copenhagen. To this day the Dutch influence can be seen in the city. How many people know about the Dutch community who settled on the island of Amager[21] outside of Copenhagen – already during the reign of Christian II (1513-1523) and Elisabeth, his consort?[22] Besides the Dutch immigrants that settled in Copenhagen forming their own community, there were also examples of Danes having careers in the VOC, some even being 2nd-generation born Netherlanders. This is all indicative of how relative and penumbral are the terms ‘Danish’, ‘Dutch’ and ‘German’ – and even the people who are thus labelled.\n\nJan Pietersz: Cortemünde\n\nBorn (1649) in Amsterdam, Hans Petersen Kerteminde was the son of the Dane, Peter Petersen, who had been born in Kerteminde on the island of Funen [Fyn] in 1618, and Christina Braunsfeld (1636-1704). He was known by the Dutch as Jan Pietersz: Cörtemunde. Being educated, he wrote in German, not Dutch, this being the lingua franca at the royal courts of Denmark-Norway and Sweden. He sailed to the East on the Royal ship Oldenborg stopping over at the Cape of Good Hope – arriving there (26 November 1672) – and went on shore (29 November 1672).\n\nHe writes an account of his voyage in German entitled Orientalische Reijse des Königlichen Schiffs Oldenborg. The original manuscript by Hans Petersen (Jan Pietersz: Cörtemunde) was acquired by the Royal Library, Copenhagen in 1796 from the collection of the Danish historian P.F. Suhm (1728-1798).[23]\n\nHis dramatic sojourn at the Cape gives vital clues about Dutch-Danish diplomatic relations and other Danish subjects resident at the Cape at the time, eg:\n\nthe superintendent of Robben Island Christian van Aalborg from Jutland,\n\nthe superintendent of the local hospital Bartel Jensen,\n\nthe rifleman Mattis Larsen and\n\nthe free-burgher Jan van Oldenborg.\n\nIt was the last-mentioned, viz. the stamvader of the Van Eeden[24] family in South Africa, whom Cörtemunde had stabbed whilst partying at his house with fellow Danes. Eventually arrested after going into hiding, he was put on trial by the Dutch as a subject of the Danish king while the royal ship Oldenborg had to remain at anchor pending delicate diplomatic manoeuvres. His sentence was commuted to being keel-hauled thrice and compensating the court, victim and surgeon for expenses, damages and services.\n\nPerhaps his greatest claim to fame should be his meeting (26 November 1672) on Robben Island with the famous banished aboriginal Goringhaicona woman Eva Meerhoff, born Krotoa, the widow of the Copenhagen-born Peter van Meerhoff:\n\n“In the house of the local commander [of Robben Island – Danish-born Christian von Aalborg] we also met a Hottentot woman [Eva] who had been born in Africa of pagan, bestial parents, but had been brought up in the Cape by a Dutch woman, so that compared with her own countrymen she now appeared to be a masterpiece of nature. She had embraced Christianity, spoke fluent Dutch, English, French and Portuguese and was conversant with the Holy Scriptures so that she was able to discuss everything with our pastor to our very great astonishment. She was much better proportioned than is generally the case with her compatriots. In short, she was most commendable being capable and well trained in all womanly crafts and married to one of the physicians serving in the Company. After the death of her husband, the noble Company allotted her 9 rixdollars monthly for her maintenance, for so long as she would remain a widow and stay virtuous. But when, after the death of her husband, she became pregnant out of wedlock and her “fountain” dried up she was punished by being kept here in a kind of custody[25] for a certain time.”\n\nPeter (van) Meerhoff[26] from Copenhagen\n\nHis Danish origins have been questioned on the basis that Meerhoff is not an existing Danish name and has not yet been found in Danish records. In his will (dated 16 September 1661), he signs his name pieter van meer hoff. This will states quite clearly, however, that he was born in Copenhagen and mentions his father by name then serving (so he thought) in the garrison across the Sound (Øresund) at the castle at Helsingborg (in Scania) called Kärnan.\n\nKärnan (Danish: Kernen meaning `The Core`) – Medieval tower in Helsingborg, Scania, in southern Sweden and only part remaining of larger Danish fortress which, along with the fortress Kronborg on the opposite of the Øresund, controlled the entrance to the Baltic Sea. Most important fortress in Denmark and integral in securing control over strait between Scania and Zealand.\n\nThe origins of Helsingborg fortress are disputed but Danish legend places its origin to the reign of legendary King Fróði – however, legend is not supported by archaeological studies with dendrochronological dating showing that the core was built (1310s), when Eric VI of Denmark is King of Denmark. Surrendered to Sweden along with rest of Skåneland (Scania) as part of Treaty of Roskilde (1658), the fortress is retaken by Danish forces (1676) during the Scanian War and the capture is celebrated by flying a giant Flag of Denmark (Dannebrog) above it – the flag is later captured by Swedish army and preserved in Army Museum (Armémuseum) in Stockholm. The fortress returns to Swedish control by the Treaty of Lund (1679). Charles XI of Sweden orders most of it demolished fearing it to be too exposed to a sneak attack from Denmark – the only thing saved is the old medieval tower core which continues to serve as a landmark for shipping through the Øresund. The castle is restored (1893-94) under instructions from Oscar Ferdinand Trapp, Swedish businessman & engineer (1847–1916) and the architect for the restoration is Josef Alfred Hellerström (1863–1931), Helsingborg city architect (1903-1928).\n\nWas the name merely a netherlandised version or translation of a well-entrenched Danish family name: Haugaard, Havgaard, Hougaard, Hovgaard? High German – Hoch Deutsch – being the language of the Royal Court in Copenhagen, was it not the norm for educated and literate people to germanise local vernacular (Danish) names? Was the family originally from further afield in what is now the Federal Republic of Germany? Did he descend from a German immigrant who found his way to Copenhagen? We know that the name Meerhoff exists as a place name in at least two instances. There were also Dutch and German parishes in Copenhagen (such as Frederiksbergs Sogn and Skt. Petri Sogn) allowed by Frederik III (1648-1670). These confirm the type of people that were drawn to the Copenhagen designed and modernised by the king’s father, Christian IV.\n\nAttempts to locate Van Meerhoff’s baptism in Copenhagen have produced the following possibility:\n\nPeter Jacobsen: son of Jacob Jenssen, baptised (23 July 1637) at the Holmens Sogn, København.\n\nBearing in mind that Meerhoff’s eldest son was named Jacobus, this may well be the record of his baptism. Jacobus, however, was initially illegitimate. Pieter van Meerhoff, if not the biological father, was at least the adoptive father to Jacobus. We are, however, confronted with the peculiar mention of Pieter Meerhoff’s father by name in his will:\n\n… stellende ende nomineerende wijders tot sijn eenigh ende universeel efrgenaem sijnen vader genaemt Aug Ede … woonde op’t casteel Elsenborgh …\n\nAug is a peculiarly Norwegian first name. Then there are the names Augh, Aughe, Aage or Åge, and Auwe or Ove, peculiar to the Danes. The Ede, which followed by a long hyphen – if not the rare name Ede (perhaps as a patronymic) – could perhaps be an abbreviation for edele (ie ‘the honourable’). The Danish accent of Peter Meerhoff himself … sieckelijck te koij leggende … may have influenced the scribe writing up the will when rendering the father’s names phonetically.\n\nPIETER VAN MEERHOFF’S WILL\n\n(16 September 1661)[28]\n\nIn den Naeme onses Heeren Amen.

Close to Angeln, which was a ‘cradle of civilization’ to the Angles who relocated together with the Jutes, Saxons and Frisians to England (or the new ‘Angel-land’), this tiny marshland deserves greater scrutiny as a ‘cradle of civilization’ to many folk that came to designate themselves, and be designated, internationally as Boers …\n\nOn the west coast of Holstein there was a small peasant republic of Ditmarsh, whose autonomy had for centuries been a thorn in the flesh of the counts of Holstein. The Ditmarshers in many ways resembled the semi-independent Frisians living to the north along the west coast of Slesvig, and like those they obtained heavy crops of grass and grain, and entertained a considerable export of cattle to Hamburg, Bremen and the Netherlands. After some skirmishes the two rival brothers, King Hans and Duke Frederik, decided to incorporate Ditmarsh, one not begrudging the other the profit. In the winter of 1500 an army of 10,000 men occupied the area of less than 500 sq. miles, until one rainy day when the thaw had set in, the Ditmarshers opened the sluices. The cannons sank in the mud, and armoured knights were drowned in the ditches.\n\nNo sooner had the peaceful king [Christian III] died then Duke Adolf and the Holstein knights prepared a new war on the independent peasants of the Ditmarsh to revenge the defeat of 1500. Frederik II adopted the idea, but the council vetoed it. However, it had no rights in Slesvig and Holstein, so the two brothers carried it through by their authority as dukes. Taught by experience they chose the summer (of 1559) for the expedition, and were victorious. After the bloody conquest the old general Rantzau prevented a massacre, and the Ditmarshers retained local self-government.[30] In 1559, after many unsuccessful attempts, a Danish king – Frederik II – overcame the North Frisian marshland peasants, and an armoured horseman entered the coat of arms as an emblem of Ditmarsken.[31]\n\nThe Ditmarsh Origins of Stamvader of the LOUW Family in South Africa: Jan Pietersz: Louw aka Broertje\n\nThe origins of the progenitor (stamvader) of the LOUW family have been the subject of much enquiry particularly in The Louws of Louwvliet: The Story of the first South African Louws and their neighbours 1659/60-1724 by Jannie Louw and Lalie Malan (A.A. Balkema, Cape Town 1984). The book is a delightful pioneering work, being one of the first integrated and contextualized family histories ever written on an old Cape colonial family. The authors, however, did not pursue their enquiry beyond the Netherlands, assuming a Dutch origin. Cape archival records, however, give a vital clue as to the provenance of Broertje and the possible location of Caspel ter Mare. In an Interrogatarium dated 29 November 1672 the Louw stamvader is referred to as Jan Pietersz: van Ditmaersz and again in an attestation (also dated 29 November 1672), he signs with a mark and is referred to as Jan Pieters: and Jan Pietersen van Ditmaersen.[32] The evidence points strongly to Caspel ter Maere / Mare being a corruption of an older name Cappel / Kappeln ter Marne and is consequently a reference to the present-day town of Marne in the Dithmarsh.\n\nImmigrant free-burghers from the DITMARSH & environs who settle at the Cape of Good Hope (1652-1662)\n\n1657\n\nChristiaan Jansz: (from Hoesum [Husum]); arrives (1654) with the Goudtsblom[33]; obtains letter of freedom (30 June 1657); 1st appears in Muster Roll (1656) as a soldier; thereafter as adelborst (1657); listed in the Muster Roll (15 February 1658) as a free-hunter together with Pieter Cornelisz: (from Langesont [Langesund in Norway]); back in the Company’s service appearing in the Muster Roll (1660): Christiaen Jansz: (from Roesum [sic]), superintendent of the Company’s stables; 1661: superintendent of the Company’s stables; 1662: superintendent of the Company’s stables; 1 August 1657: Attestation; 5 December 1658: the slave Anthony van Angola, sold by constable Nathaniel West, who had bought him (22 April 1658) from the Company, to Christiaan Jansz: van Hoesum – no price mentioned; he marries Stijntje Jansen Steens: who arrives from Husum as the wife of Christian Jansen (from Husum, Ditmarsken) and appears in the Muster Roll (1671). Indications are that it was she who burnt to death (11 January 1673). Her death is later ascribed to the Hottentots in the Company Journal: During the past night the house of a burgher, distant half and hour from the Fort, and situated in the country, was, with the stables, sheep-shed, and 480 sheep that were in the latter, completely burnt down. The housewife, who had endeavoured to save some money, remained behind too long in the burning house, and was so hurt with the flames that she died this day; they do not appear to have had any children.\n\n1658\n\nHan Ras / Rasch (from Angel [Angeln]), ex-soldier of Het Wapen van Hollant granted letter of freedom (13 March 1658); mentioned in Muster Roll of Freemen (1660): Hans Ras (from Angel) as one of Hendrik Boom’s land lessees; listed in Muster Roll of Freemen 1661 as being part of Herman’s Company: Hans Ras (from Angel); appears in 1662 Muster Roll of Freemen in Harman’s Company as Han Ras (from Angel) as a co-owner together with Herman Remajenne [Remagen] (from Cologne); he married the widow Catharina Hostinghs: [Hustings:] (from Lübeck).\n\nJacob Balhoorn from St Margriete Parish [St Margarethen in Ost Friesland, near Brunsbüttel], arquebusier at the Fort.

As one of the many accosted attempted stowaways from the Cape, he declares (22 March 1660) that this year’s homeward bound had called out in the streets and at the freemen’s houses: “Get into the boat, who wishes to go with us? Have you any goods to stow away? We shall bring you casks in which to stow your things. Join us, freemen.” &c. He refused, however, to sign the declaration because his wife did not like him to do so.[38] A tailor, he is granted land in Table Valley (15 October 1659, 20 September 1660 and 1 November 1661). He is appointed (1660) as the Company’s sergeant of the burgher forces.

By 22 June 1672, following his death, he is succeeded by Harmen Ernst de Gresnigh.[39] She remarries (21 August 1672) Willem van Dieden (from Amsterdam).

Reared by the first Dutch commander Jan van Riebeeck and utilised by the Dutch as interpreter, envoy, trader, guide, cultural broker, mediator, agent and informant. She was the Cape’s first indigene to be baptised (3 May 1662 as Eva) and to marry according to Christian rites (2 June 1664). Wife of the VOC’s surgeon and superintendent of Robben Island, the Copenhagen-born Pieter Meerhoff (killed 1667/8 at Antongil Bay, Madagascar while on a slave trading expedition). As widow, fell into disgrace with the Dutch authorities who disapproved of her drinking, sexual and native habits. Detained and banished without trial to Robben Island. Died there (29 July 1674) aged 31 years. Her remains were later removed from the demolished church at the Castle and buried in the foundations of the Dutch Reformed Groote Kerk in Adderley Street, Cape Town. Her progeny forms a substantial proportion of the people classified “white” under the apartheid regime. See the entry for KROTOA (c. 1642-1674) in Saunders, Christopher & Southey, Nicholas: A Dictionary of South African History (David Philip Cape Town & Johannesburg 1998). The authors omit the fact that her documentable progeny form a major cross-section of South Africa’s population formerly classified ‘white’. Her other progeny possibly remain a ‘hidden’ part of the Cape’s predominantly ‘Eurafricasian’ population.\n\n[2] A royal decree (16 March 1792) prohibited the exportation of slaves from Danish possessions as well as transportation of slaves on Danish ships. Denmark was the first European country to condemn this practice though prohibition did not take effect (until 1 January 1803). Ten years later Sweden followed Denmark’s example.\n\n[3] Ove Gjedde / Gedde / Giedde (27 December 1594-19 December 1660) – Danish admiral and member of interim government following death of Christian IV and imposing harsh restrictions on Frederick III due to his close ties to Germany.

Participates in Torstenson War (1643–1645) as admiral & appointed (1645) “admiral of the realm”, but becomes sick (1648), and is granted instead the fiefdom of Helsingborg Castle [Kärnan]. After peace in Roskilde, Denmark loses Scania to Sweden. When Swedish king Karl X Gustav breaks the peace of 1658, he is taken prisoner while visiting Helsingborg. He is first sent to prison in Helsingborg Castle, and later sent to Malmö. Released (1660) during prisoner exchanges between Sweden and Denmark – old and physically weak man and having already built a grave monument in the old Danish city of Helsingborg, which had now become Swedish. Legend has it that “His bones after the Roskilde peace never found rest, after Scania became Swedish” (hans ben efter Roskildefreden fandt aldrig hvile, efter Skåne var blevet svensk).

Already from Viking times the southern parts of Sweden were the traditional lands of the Danes together with islands such as Sjaelland (Zealand).
