Deceased was born in Mielberg, Schlwswig-Holstein, Germany, March 14, 1826. He received an education at the Teachers Seminary at Tondern, from where he graduated and followed teaching for a term of five years, when he enlisted in army service, being a principal in the Denmark Schleswig-Hoostein war, which lasted some years. He came to America with his family in about 1850, coming direct to Wisconsin and settling at Milwaukee. He held a position as a teacher and organist in the first Lutheran school of that city. Two years later he removed to Chicago, where he followed clerking until 1855, when he changed his location to Racine and entered the mercantile business. In 1861 he again removed, this time to a farm at New Holstein, where he remained until coming to this city in 1892. During the first four or five years of his residence here he was secretary and treasurer of the Schwartz Mfg. Co. after which he retired to spend the remainder of his years in quiet. During his residence at New Holstein, the deceased represented his county in the assembly for four terms. He was also chairman of his town for a number of years and president of the Calumet County Mutual Fire Insurance Col. He was twice married, the first time in his native land. His wife died in 1854 and from this union two daughters survive as follows: Mrs. Henry Bruns of Beloit and Mrs. R. Hayenga of Brant. In 1859 he remarried, choosing Miss Augusta Bodenstab as his life's partner, who survives him with the following three children: Dr. F.J. Petersen of Lompoc, Cal., E.L. and Hugo of this city. Two daughters of the latter union died in infancy. The funeral took place at his late residence Thursday morning at 8 o'clock., D. Mahlsted making a few brief remarks, after which the funeral cortege went to New Holstein, where the remains were taken to the hall, and the funeral service was held at 2 o'clock, the Rev. Schildknecht of the Reformed church officiating. The pall bearers were Carl Hecker, C. Lautenbach, Nic.

Began life as a teacher, engaged in the mercantile business, was a farmer and manufacturer-took part in war in Europe, was a member of state legislature. On Monday morning C.H. M. Petersen, an aged resident of this city, was found dead in his bed, the end having come, it is believed, some time during the night. Aside from the debility which accompanied old age, he was troubled with heart disease. The evening before he was up and around as usual and there was nothing in his condition which foretold the approaching dissolution, when he retired. It was apparent that he had passed away without a struggle. The funeral will be held tomorrow. There will be brief services at the home of nine o'clock in thus having passed his eightieth year. He was educated at the Seminary at Tondern, Schleswig. After completing the course at the institution, he taught school for five years when he entered the army and took part in the Denmark-Schleswig war, which lasted two years. At the close in 1850 he came to American and clerked in a mercantile establishment in Chicago. He did not remain there long before he went to Milwaukee and engaged in teaching in a Lutheran parochial school, then under Rev. Lochner. At the end of two years he removed with his family to Racine and opened a store. In 1861 he went to New Holstein and bought a farm on which he lived until he removed with his family to Plymouth in 1890. While at New Holstein he served in state legislature four terms in 1868, 1869, 1872, and 1881. He was chairman of his town and for many years president of the Calumet County Fire Insurance Company. While living in Plymouth, he was at one time a Free Mason and an Odd Fellow but when the lodges in New Holstein broke up he dropped his membership in the two orders. He was twice married and there are two children of the first marriage surviving - Mrs. R. Hayenga of Brant and Mrs. H. Bruns of Beloit. He was married to his second wife, Miss Augsta Bodenstab in Sheboygan in 1859. Three children of the second union survive as follows: Dr. F.J. Petersen of Lompoc, California; E.L. Petersen and Hugo Petersen of this city. The deceased was a man of wide experience and of considerable education, and the account of his life shows that he was useful to his fellowmen. He was strictly honest, but by thrift and economy he was enabled to accumulate some wealth.

He was born on 03 Feb 1863, in New Holstein, Wisconsin. He died in 1913. He married Bertha Wilhelmina Pieper in New Holstein, Wisconsin on 22 Sept 1886.\n\nNotes for Frederick Julius Petersen:\n\nOn the Registration of Marriage, Frederick's occupation is a farmer. Around 1892 the couple moved from New Holstein to Plymouth. They then moved to California at some point in the late 19th century. Fred. J Petersen was a medical doctor and was highly regarded as one of the earliest homeopathic medical doctors. He had a number of articles published in the American Medical Journal and a book published about herbal remedies and dosages. Frederick J. Petersen was terminally ill and finally took his own life in 1913. This was an embarrassment to the family in California and they seldom talked about him and lost contact with the Wisconsin relatives. The book, \"Materia Medica\" that he wrote in 1905 is on line.\n\nFred J. Petersen, M.D.\n\nThis enigmatic Eclectic physician wrote a few papers for the Los Angeles Eclectic Journal and later the California Eclectic and the Eclectic Journal (all between 1904 and 1908)...and this one textbook. It is a peculiar and rather exciting approach to Eclecticism, gleefully mixing botanicals, electricity and low-potency homeopathics. He took the approach that most herbs were best employed for their \"secondary actions\", that is, not for their toxic or heroic effects, but the subtler constitutional and multi-systemic effects that were crucial to the Eclectic Medical model. He then used low-potency homeopathics, for their usual echoes of toxicity, their \"primary actions\". And then he mixed them all up, along with baths, faradic, and even light therapy. He presumed, as a sensible rural physician (the typical Eclectic), that such a doctor should be able to make most of his or her supplies, medicines and even diagnostic tools. This book is as close to a basic workbook for low-tech physicianing as I have seen, and it contains many rather unique observations that coincide with what I have experienced and observed but have not seen mentioned elsewhere. A peculiar and refreshing mixture of different schools that in many ways is more \"Eclectic\" than many better known works.\n\nAlthough all alternative physicians were united against the \"Regular School\", Homeopaths aligned together in glinty fanatacism, digging and delving into their version of pharmaceutical alchemy, the Physiomedicalists were Cleansing the Body of vitiating influences, and the sturdy Eclectics were practicing medicine (using drugs but especially botanicals) and surgery in a vitalist make-over of Standard Practice. Homeopaths and Eclectics generally traveled in alternative universes, with a common foe but little or no mingling, and the Physiomedicalists or Neo-Thomsonians, a rather anarchic bunch, were in a rather reduced state, consisting largely of semi-professional practitioners, ageing and grumpy. Thus it was at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nBear in mind, of course, that these medical divisions were most staunchly upheld by the various schools, national and local organizations, publishers, allied pharmaceutical manufacturers and periodicals...Medical Politics. At the turn of the 20th century, a licensed physician...trained in whatever sect...often, in the course of a practice of a few decades, began using methods and remedies from other medical sects. A rural country doc might, in time, end up using botanicals from Cincinnati, drugs from New York, homeopathics from Philadelphia, and some osteopathy picked up at a Still symposium. THESE docs didn't write books, however...except for Dr. Petersen.\n\nPetersen, born in 1864, graduated in 1900 from the California Eclectic Medical College in Los Angeles, was in practice in Los Olivos, California (NW of Santa Barbara), later moved to Lompoc, California, and finally ended up further north in Camp Meeker, a small village in the rolling hills south of the Russian River and Guerneville. There, in 1913, age 50, suffering from ill health, he took his own life with a gun. His death was noted in the Journal of the American Medical Association, but apparently ignored by the California Eclectic Medical Association. Peculiar.\n\nChildren of Frederick Julius Petersen and Bertha Wilhelmina Pieper are:\n\nLillie Gwendolin Peterson. She was born on 21 Dec 1888 in New Holstein, Calumet, WI, USA [1]. She died on 02 Feb 1966.\n\nHarry Eugene Peterson. He was born on 14 Jun 1890 in Plymouth, Sheboygan, WI, USA . He married Reta Roberts. They were married 1936.

He was born Dec 1869, New Holstein, Calumet County, Wisconsin and married Augusta Roehl (b. 25 Nov 1878, Germany; d. Dec 1949) In the 1920 census it looks like he was living as a lodger in Plymouth City. He is listed as single at age 50. In 1900 he was living with his parents at the age of 30.\n\nGeneration 3\n\nSwanetta (Nettie) Fredericke Laura Hajenga - [3] (Emily Doretha Fredrika Petersen - [2], Casper Henry - [1]) was born 29 May 1876 in Chilton, Calumet County, Wisconsin, and died 04 Nov in Fon du Lac, Wisconsin.
