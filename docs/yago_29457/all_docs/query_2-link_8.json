        "text": "Home\n\nAbel Cathrine von Krogh\n\nThe von Krogh name is recorded back as far as 1236 among German nobility. We pick up our descent from Berent (Bernhardus) von Krogh ( ? -1676), son of Georg von Krogh. Bernhardus was born in Lubeck, Germany and came to Denmark in 1644 with troops from Bremen to assist King Christian IV of Denmark at the end of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). Though the Danes were subdued, Bernhardus remained in the service of the Danish king and was sent to Trondheim, Norway in command of the troops there, since Norway was still under the rule of Denmark. Bernhardus married Alide von Bolton ( ? -1688), daughter of the Mayor of Bremen, and their descendants intermarried with prominent families of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\nBernhardus' only son, Georg Friderich von Krogh (1653-1696), was born in Trondheim, spending his life in military service; first as Captain of the Trondheim regiment and later becoming Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, and Chief of the Regiment in Bergen. Married three times, he produced sixteen children, a guarantee the von Krogh family name would exist for centuries in Norway. One of his sons was Christopher von Krogh (1685-1752), Abel Cathrine's great-grandfather, born in Bergen. He too, was a military officer, serving as Major, Colonel, and Commander of a regiment in Stavanger from 1719 to 1752. It was he who purchased the Hogganvik estate as his residence and he sired nine children... among whom was Soren de Fine von Krogh (1725-1795), Abel Cathrine's grandfather.\n\nSoren was born at Hogganvik and like his father was a military officer, holding the rank of Major General in command of the troops at Stavanger during the Seven Years War. Married twice, he sired fourteen children and Bernardus Arnoldus (1776-1836), Abel Cathrine's father, was the third child of Soren's second marriage to Catharina Nikolava Frorup. Both great-grandfather and grandfather of Abel Cathrine are buried in the old cemetery at Vikedal.\n\nBernhardus Arnoldus also entered military service becoming a Lieutenant in the bodyguard of King Christian VII. When Denmark became involved in the Napoleonic Wars, he was wounded in the defense of Copenhagen in 1807 and returned to Norway where he married his first cousin, Cecelia Sophie Muller von Krogh September 5, 1808 in Sandeid, a not uncommon practice in those times. The young couple lived on Nyvold, a part of the Vestbo estate, where there was an excellent spot for salmon fishing. Lieutenant Bernhardus was renowned for his gallantry and sportsmanship and excelled as a \"Halling-dancer.\" He and two of his brothers died the same week in December of 1836 in a typhoid epidemic just months after Abel Cathrine and Bjorn set sail for America.\n\nAbel Cathrine's great-grandfather, Christopher, had a brother, Georg Friderich (1687-1768), who was, in 1724, Major of the Trondheim garrison. In 1731 he was made Colonel and by 1758, Commanding General of Northern Norway. In 1760 he was made a White Knight and in 1764, Commandant at Trondheim. Upon his death, April 29, 1768 his body was interred at Trondheim's cathedral, Nidaros.\n\nHe had a son by the same name, Geog Friderich (1732-1818) who also had a brilliant military career as a staff officer under King Frederick the Great of Prussia, where he was promoted to Adjutant General. Returning to Norway, he became Commandant at Trondheim and, for a period of time, Commander in Chief of the Norwegian Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He was a prolific writer and is credited with introducing the cultivation of potatoes in Norway. In recognition of his distinguished career, King Christian VII of Denmark honored him with the \"Great Cross of Dannebrog\" and the title \"Knight of the Elephant\".\n\nIt was he who lived at Stiftsgaarden in Trondheim, the largest wooden building in Norway, which had been built for his mother-in-law, Cicilie Christine Schoeller. Upon his death three days of mourning were proclaimed by the Norwegian Army. He was buried by the south wall of the west wing of Nidarod Cathedral where a plaque marks the spot. The remains of his father are also here... having been moved during restoration, from inside the cathedral. These two Georg Friderichs are the von Krogh's about whom you might perhaps hear the most. The father - a brother to Abel Cathrine's great-grandfather Christopher (making him her great-grand-uncle) and the son - first cousin to her grandfather.\n\nAbel Cathrine received her name via her maternal grandmother, Abel Catharina Segelcke, whose paternal grandmother was Abel Catharina Sorensdatter Berg. It was the custom for a first-born to be named after a grandparent.\n\nAbel Cathrine was the only one to emigrate from her father's family of five children. However it is interesting to note that six nephews, sons of all three of her brothers, followed her to America. Three located in Spring Grove, Minnesota; two in Northwood, Iowa (where she lived in her later years with her daughter, Dina, and Rev. T. A. Torgerson; and yet another settling in Chicago and marrying there in 1892.\n\nAbel Cathrine also had a third cousin living on Koshkonong Creek, Caspar Nilson von Krogh, who emigrated in 1843 under somewhat the same circumstances as Abel Cathrine and Bjorn - marriage with a lower class and dissatisfaction with the state church. Caspar was well-educated at the University of Christiania and progressed to the Royal Academy of Engineering, becoming a Master Gunsmith. Caspar became a very wealthy man, founding the town of Kroghville on Koshkonong Creek."
