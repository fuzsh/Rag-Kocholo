Contrary to popular myth, Adolf Hitler’s war aim was never to conquer the world. He admired the British Empire and felt it served a very useful purpose for mankind, keeping the “subhuman” populations of Africa, India, and other places in check as it did. He certainly did not wish to destroy it; as early as 1924, when he lay out his program with astonishing candor in Mein Kampf, he stated that he wanted no war of revenge against England and France for what had happened in World War I. What Germany needed, he pounded out in a thousand speeches, was Lebensraum—living space. This, he pointed out, could only be obtained in the East—primarily at the expense of the Soviet Union. Poland was the ﬁrst eastern country to be forcibly annexed by the Greater German Reich. Adolf Hitler was stunned when London and Paris declared war on him on September 3, 1939. After Poland was conquered, he made peace overtures to the West. They were rejected. To the Nazi dictator’s surprise, he found that he had lost credibility with the West—he had told one too many lies. Hitler knew it would be impossible for him to successfully invade Russia with an undefeated England and France at his back. Reasonably conﬁdent that his 1939 alliance of convenience with Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, would hold for a year, he invaded France on May 10, 1940. Six weeks later, to the astonishment of the world, he dictated terms of peace to the French government. Following the capitulation of France, Hitler again made a series of peace overtures to unconquered England, but they were not accepted. Sir Winston Churchill, prime minister since May 10, saw Adolf Hitler as the anti-Christ and a threat to Western civilization.1 England fought on and survived the terror bombings and the U-boat blockade.\n\n1\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n2Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nAlthough the British were not defeated, they were certainly beaten down. Hitler, who was by now accustomed to gambling on a grand scale, correctly guessed that England would not recover for some time—perhaps years. He decided he could conquer Russia in 1941, before the British could intervene. On June 22, 1941, he launched Operation Barbarossa: the invasion of the Soviet Union. It was a fatal mistake and one of the turning points of the war. In the forward European sectors alone, the Soviet Union outnumbered the Wehrmacht almost two to one in men, ﬁve to one in armored ﬁghting vehicles (AFVs), and ﬁve to one in aircraft, although the German Army and Luftwaffe far outclassed it in initiative and leadership. The Russians, on the other hand, have often amazed the world with their incredible ability to endure hardships and suffering. Even after it suffered casualties numbering in the millions, the Red Army turned Hitler’s legions back in front of the gates of Moscow. Then came Stalin’s winter offensive of 1941–1942. Although it fell far short of the Communist dictator’s goals, it nevertheless inﬂicted upon the German Army (Heer) its ﬁrst defeat, and it was a serious one. German losses exceeded 30 percent and they were naturally higher in the combat arms. Losses of 50 percent in infantry and panzer grenadier (motorized infantry) units were not unusual. Because they lost so many of their best men, the German ground forces also lost much of their eliteness and e´lan. After the winter of 1941–1942, the Wehrmacht was never the same. Dissatisﬁed with his generals, Adolf Hitler—who had been interfering in operational matters since 1938—sacked Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief of the High Command of the Army (Oberkommando des Heer, or OKH) and replaced him himself. Hitler was now Fuehrer (leader) and chancellor of the Reich (empire), supreme commander of the Wehrmacht and commander in chief of the army. He issued his orders to the eastern armies through the chief of the General Staff of the army, whom he replaced more and more frequently.2 In 1941, Germany had launched offensives on three sectors of the Eastern Front—north, center, and south. In 1942, it had only enough strength to attack on one. Army Group South (subsequently divided into Army Groups A and B) pushed toward the Volga and the Caucasus but was ﬁnally defeated. The 6th Army was surrounded and destroyed at Stalingrad—by far the greatest military disaster in the history of the Third Reich to date. That winter, the Red Army surged forward again, only to be checked by the brilliant tactics of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein. A lull descended on the Eastern Front, but behind the lines there was feverish activity, as both sides prepared for the next battle. In 1943, Germany could launch a major offensive in only part of one sector. Hitler chose to attack at Kursk, to pinch off a major Soviet salient. The offensive was slow in developing, and Stalin, who had prior knowledge 2\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 3\n\n3\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nof it, accepted the challenge. On July 5, Hitler struck. It was the greatest tank battle in history, and Germany was defeated. Now, although the Nazi dictator refused to accept the fact, all roads led backward for Nazi Germany. As his military defeats compounded, Hitler’s hatred and distrust of his generals increased. The Waffen-SS (armed SS)—a party formation which was under the tactical control of the Wehrmacht but not part of it—gained more and more power and inﬂuence in the conduct of the war. Hitler listened to his generals less and less and, insofar as was possible, surrounded himself only with the most compliant yes-men. His own creation, the High Command of the Wehrmacht (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW) gained more and more power and authority over military operations, at the expense of OKH, the traditional Prussian and Bavarian General Staff ofﬁcers and army elite. OKW was clearly pro-Nazi and was headed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, a notorious yes-man who was privately referred to as “Lackey” by the other senior army generals. Even Hitler declared that Keitel had “the brains of a cinema usher” but, because of his doglike loyalty, kept him in power until the very end. The chief of the operations staff at OKW, Colonel General Alfred Jodl, was more talented than Keitel but was also clearly under the Fuehrer’s spell. Less important positions at OKW and at Fuehrer Headquarters were ﬁlled by men with the same mindset. Hitler therefore was able to act with less and less restraint. He even sacked Field Marshal von Manstein, Germany’s greatest strategic brain; Heinz Guderian, the Father of the Blitzkrieg; and Erwin Rommel, the famous “Desert Fox,” among others. (Rommel and Guderian were recalled in 1943, Manstein was never reemployed.) Hitler had been right about one thing: it did take Britain years to recover from her defeats of 1940, but in 1944 she was ready to reenter the battle on the European mainland. The United States, whose strength Hitler had grossly underestimated, was ready as well. On June 6, 1944, the Allies launched their D-day invasion. Rommel was able to check it but not destroy it. The Third Reich’s chances of surviving the war were now not quite hopeless, but they were dangerously close to it. In the East, meanwhile, all of eastern Europe and huge tracts of former Soviet territory were still part of the Nazi empire. As the summer of 1944 began everyone knew that Stalin and the Red Army were about to try to reconquer these regions. To defend his empire, Hitler turned to “politically correct,” pro-Nazi generals and ﬁeld marshals, such as Georg Lindemann, Ferdinand Schoerner, and Walter Model. The ﬁrst senior Nazi general whom Stalin’s armies would test that summer, however, was the least capable of them all: Ernst Busch. Stalingrad is generally considered to be the largest military disaster suffered by Hitler’s armies, but it was not. Field Marshal Paulus’s 6th Army lost only 230,000 men at Stalingrad; Ernst Busch’s Army Group Center 3\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n4Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nlost more than 300,000 men in the Vitebsk-Minsk battles, which Paul Carell called “The Cannae of Army Group Center.”3 It is not an uplifting story. ERNST BUSCH: PORTRAIT OF A NAZI GENERAL Ernst Busch was born on July 6, 1885, at Essen-Steele, in the Ruhr industrial district of western Germany. He decided early in life to become a career army ofﬁcer, worked hard at his chosen profession, and graduated from the Gross-Lichterfelde Cadet Academy (Imperial Germany’s West Point) in 1904. He then joined the Westphalian 13th Infantry Regiment at Muenster as an ofﬁcer-cadet. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 57th Infantry Regiment in 1908, and in 1913 he was promoted to ﬁrst lieutenant and assigned to the War Academy at Kassel for further training.4 (See Appendix I for a table of comparative ranks.) Busch spent almost all of the World War I period as an infantry commander on the Western Front. He was appointed company commander upon the outbreak of hostilities and was promoted to captain in 1915. Shortly afterward he was given command of a battalion in the 56th Infantry Regiment. He fought in the battles of Reims and Namur, in the Artois sector and in Flanders, at La Basse, Arras, and Verdun, and Champagne area in 1918. He was awarded the Pour le Me´rite (“Blue Max”) for his exceptional courage. In 1919–1920, under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, the German armed forces (which were called the Reichswehr from 1919 to 1935) were reduced to 115,000 men. Of these, 100,000 were allotted to the army (Reichsheer). The rest were assigned to the navy (Reichsmarine). Germany was allowed no air force (Luftwaffe) under the terms of the treaty. Ernst Busch was selected for retention in the hundred-thousand-man army. He held various staff and command assignments during the Weimar Republic era (1919–1933). As a major, he was assigned to the staff of the inspector of transport troops in the Reichswehr in 1925, and in 1930, while serving as a battalion commander in the 9th Infantry Regiment, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Two years later he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 9th Infantry Regiment at Potsdam.5 Ernst Busch was an “out-and-out” Nazi who followed Hitler with blind obedience. He was a brutal man who said that he enjoyed sitting on the People’s Court tribunal, a body that frequently invoked the death penalty. “This following story may give an idea of the man Busch,” Lieutenant Fabian von Schlabendorff, a member of his staff in 1944 and a lawyer in civilian life, was to recall: He told us one day that he had been a lay member of the National Socialists People’s Tribunal; and knowing nothing of law, had made up his mind from the 4\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 5\n\n5\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nstart to pass the death sentence upon everybody who was brought before the court. He had persevered in this practice, even when the learned judges were of other opinion. In the course of the conversation we came to discuss an astonishing order from Hitler that all parachutists, British and American alike, whether in uniform or civilian clothes, were to be shot at once. Busch did not hesitate to express his approval of this order. Disregarding his military rank, I emphatically opposed him. Busch, quite unperturbed, admitted that the order was a violation of international law, and added that, in fact, precautions had been taken to pass it on only by word of mouth, and to destroy immediately all written evidence that it had ever been sent to the Army Group.6\n\nBusch’s peacetime career was unexceptional until after Hitler assumed power in 1933, after which it was characterized by rapid promotion. He was a lieutenant colonel and number 176 on the German Army seniority list of 1932.7 Nevertheless he was promoted to colonel soon after Hitler’s rise, and in 1935 he was a major general, commanding the 23rd Infantry Division at Potsdam. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1937 and was a rabid supporter of Hitler during the Blomberg-Fritsch crisis in early 1938, when the Fuehrer ousted both the minister of war and the commander in chief of the army, despite the objections of many of the generals. Busch’s reward was quick in coming. On February 2, 1938, at the relatively early age of ﬁfty-three, he received an accelerated promotion to general of infantry and later that month replaced anti-Nazi General Ewald von Kleist as commander of Wehrkreis (Military District) VIII (Silesia and later the Sudetenland).8 In the fall of 1938 he blindly supported Hitler’s plans to invade Czechoslovakia, despite the risks involved and the objections of dozens of more senior and experienced commanders. In the invasion of Poland, Busch’s VIII Corps was on the left ﬂank of Army Group South. It took Krakow, advanced along the Vistula, and ended the campaign near Lvov.9 Busch replaced Georg von Kuechler as commander of the 16th (formerly 3d) Army for the invasion of France. He did not understand tank tactics and did not believe the panzer thrust proposed by General Heinz Guderian would get beyond the Meuse, much less reach the English Channel; his most signiﬁcant assignment in the campaign was to cover Guderian’s left ﬂank in the initial advance. In the second (mopping-up) phase of the campaign, he directed thirteen divisions (all infantry) and followed the panzers south into the French interior.10 After the French surrender he was promoted to colonel general on July 19, 1940. Busch’s 16th Army remained in France until the spring of 1941, when it was sent to Poland, and was on the southern ﬂank of Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa. Its primary missions were to cover the right ﬂank of the 18th Army as it drove on Leningrad and to maintain contact with Army Group Center on its right (southern) ﬂank. On June 27, 1941, 5\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n6Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\n16th Army controlled seven divisions—again, all infantry.11 Later that year it received reinforcements. Busch’s forces penetrated the Soviet frontier defenses and advanced to Staraya Russa, which the three divisions of his X Corps took in the second week of August after bitter street ﬁghting. In midAugust, X Corps was counterattacked by the Soviet 34th Army (eight infantry divisions, a cavalry corps, and an armored corps). General Erich von Manstein’s LVI Panzer Corps had to be diverted from the advance on Leningrad to clear up matters. The brilliant Manstein described conditions around Staraya Russa as “shitty.” He nevertheless managed to reverse the situation and surround the Soviet 34th Army, which was destroyed on August 23.12 Busch faced the Russian winter offensive of 1941–1942 with the XXXVIII, XXXIX Panzer, X, and II Corps: nine infantry divisions, one motorized division, and one SS motorized division on the line, with the 18th Motorized Division in reserve.13 On January 9, in temperatures of minus sixty degrees Fahrenheit, he was struck by the Soviet 52nd, 11th, 34th, 3rd Shock, and 4th Shock Armies. Busch signaled his commanders that he had no reserves; they would have to hold where they were, as the Fuehrer had ordered a few days before. General of Infantry Count Walter von Brockdorff-Ahlefeldt’s II Corps was surrounded near Demyansk on February 8, with more than 100,000 men. To the south, on January 28, Lieutenant General Theodor Scherer was encircled at Kholm with the headquarters of his 281st Security Division and some 5,500 men from various units. Meanwhile, in a heroic resistance, Lieutenant General Baron Theodor von Wrede’s isolated 290th Infantry Division held up a large part of the Soviet 34th Army south of Lake Ilmen for weeks but was nearly wiped out in the process. Busch managed to save the vital city and supply base of Staraya Russa only by committing his last reserves (the 18th Motorized Division under Colonel Werner von Erdmannsdorff), and even then there was hand-to-hand ﬁghting in the streets, right up to the doorstep of 16th Army’s main supply depot. Contact with the left ﬂank of Army Group Center was completely lost during this struggle. Colonel General von Kuechler, the recently appointed C-in-C of Army Group North, was so dissatisﬁed with Busch’s leadership that he requested authorization from OKH (i.e., Hitler) to relieve him of his command. Permission was not forthcoming, however. Fortunately for the Germans, the main Soviet strike forces turned south, into the rear of Army Group Center, and headed for Vitebsk and Smolensk.14 They were halted short of their objectives by General Walter Model’s 9th Army. As the Soviets exhausted themselves by attacking on a broad front and attempting to destroy all three German army groups, rather than contenting themselves with less ambitious objectives, Hitler and Kuechler reinforced the sagging 16th Army. That summer Busch was able to rescue Group Scherer at Kholm and reestablish ground contact with II Corps near De6\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 7\n\n7\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nmyansk. That Corps, however, did not regain its freedom of maneuver until March 1943, when the Demyansk salient was evacuated. From the spring of 1942 until 1944, the Soviet armies in the northern sector concentrated mainly against 18th Army, which was besieging Leningrad. Busch faced only secondary Soviet attacks and suffered no more serious defeats. He did not score any major victories either. Nevertheless, on February 1, 1943, he was promoted to ﬁeld marshal, despite his rather mediocre record. He owed his advancement strictly to his pro-Nazi background and Hitler’s favoritism, rather than to any distinguished performance on his part. On October 28, 1943, Field Marshal Guenther von Kluge was seriously injured in an automobile accident. The next day Hitler named Ernst Busch to succeed him as commander in chief, Army Group Center. He had been promoted well beyond his capabilities. The results would be disastrous, as we shall see. Hitler valued Busch as a conﬁrmed Nazi and as a yes-man; Busch, on the other hand, knew he had not really proven himself as a military commander, so he tended to rely on Hitler’s judgment, even in tactical affairs. A Fuehrer order, to Busch, was something to be obeyed without question or thought of evasion. With this attitude, Busch was a thoroughly incompetent army group commander, a fact he would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt before 1944 was out. THE CANNAE OF ARMY GROUP CENTER From north to south, Army Group Center consisted of Colonel General Georg-Hans Reinhardt’s 3rd Panzer Army (ﬁve infantry and four Luftwaffe ﬁeld divisions); Colonel General Gotthard Heinrici’s 4th Army (eighteen infantry and four Luftwaffe ﬁeld divisions, plus the 18th Panzer and 25th Panzer Grenadier Divisions); General of Infantry Hans Jordan’s 9th Army (fourteen infantry divisions and the battered 20th Panzer Grenadier Division); and Colonel General Walter Weiss’s 2nd Army (eleven infantry and four panzer divisions, plus a security division). Busch also had six Hungarian infantry divisions, three German and one Slovak security divisions, and two ﬁeld training divisions, for an army-group total of seventy-six divisions. This ﬁgure is very misleading, however. The Hungarian and Luftwaffe ﬁeld units were next to useless, and the security and training divisions were not equipped for frontline combat. Security divisions, for example, normally consisted of two security regiments, small reconnaissance, engineer and signal components, and no artillery at all. Of the remaining ﬁftyﬁve divisions, none were at full strength, and twenty-two were classiﬁed as remnants or kampfgruppen (battle groups)—divisions reduced to regimental strength by heavy casualties, albeit not without combat value.15 By the following summer, Busch had combined and consolidated several of these units and would have thirty-eight infantry divisions on June 15, 1944. The 7\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n8Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\naverage infantry division still would have only two thousand men in six frontline infantry battalions by that date.16 (See Appendix II for an outline of German unit types and their approximate strengths.) The Soviets attacked Army Group Center several times in the winter of 1943–1944. In the 4th Army’s zone, the Soviets made four attempts to take Orsha (from October to the end of December 1943) but were defeated each time in heavy ﬁghting, and the 3rd Panzer Army managed to hold Vitebsk—barely—against attacks by three Soviet armies. In these battles, Lieutenant General Rudolf Peschel’s 6th Luftwaffe Field Division particularly distinguished itself, knocking out forty-seven Soviet tanks northeast of Vitebsk on January 5, 1944, alone. By January 8, however, it had only 436 men left. Busch’s role in these victories was largely passive. In late 1943, for example, when General of Panzer Troops Georg-Hans Reinhardt, the panzer army commander, requested permission to withdraw his northernmost division, the 87th Infantry, Busch referred the matter to Hitler, who turned the request down. As a result, the division was encircled near Lobok on December 16. It escaped only when Reinhardt ordered it to break out against the Fuehrer’s orders and only then in heavy ﬁghting. It lost more than 1,500 of its ﬁve thousand men and all of its artillery, heavy equipment, and vehicles in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Geissler, the spearhead commander, was among those killed.17 Hitler also ordered 2nd Army, on Busch’s southern ﬂank, to stand ﬁrm, despite the fact that Model’s Army Group North Ukraine was retreating to the Dnieper, exposing Busch’s right (southern) ﬂank. Rather than question the Fuehrer’s judgment, Busch held the line by extending his frontage and committing the bulk of his panzer divisions to the south. As a result of this “stand fast” order, a sixty-mile gap developed between 2nd Army and Model’s northern ﬂank.18 The ﬁghting in the winter of 1943–1944 was heavy, but Army Group Center managed to hold Vitebsk and Orsha, which guarded the ﬁfty-mile land bridge between the Dvina and the Dnieper—the historic key to the Russian heartland. This represented a signiﬁcant propaganda victory for the Germans, but elsewhere they were in serious trouble: the Siege of Leningrad was broken in mid-January, Army Group North was hurled back and lost contact with the northern wing of Army Group Center; 17th Army was smashed in the Crimea; and in the spring of 1944, the Ukraine was lost to Germany. When the spring thaw brought a lull on the Eastern Front, Germany’s strategic situation was at a low ebb. Map 1.1 shows the situation in the East in the spring of 1944. In May 1944, Germany had 2,242,649 men on the Eastern Front—the lowest total since the invasion began. They were opposed by 6,077,000 Soviet troops—the highest total ever. Stalin now had ﬁve hundred infantry divisions, forty artillery divisions, and three hundred armored or mechanized brigades, with more than nine thousand tanks, 10,500 guns, 2,300 8\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 9\n\n9\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nMap 1.1 The Eastern Front, Spring 1944\n\nmultiple-tube rocket launchers, 4,200 antitank guns, and sixteen thousand ﬁghters and bombers. The Third Reich had completely lost the initiative in all sectors. Army Group Center was in a particularly bad position. True, it was the strongest army group, with 792,196 men (as opposed to 540,965 in Army Group North, 400,542 in Army Group North Ukraine, and 9\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n10 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\n508,946 in Army Group South Ukraine), but it was occupying a salient with both ﬂanks exposed, and it barred the direct route to Berlin. At the closest point, Army Group Center was still only 290 miles from Moscow; at their closest point, the Russians were 550 miles from Berlin.19 Clearly, if Stalin was going to destroy Nazi Germany, Army Group Center would have to be destroyed ﬁrst. By mid-May 1944, Army Group Center had a strength of forty-two infantry divisions (ﬁve of them Hungarian), four panzer divisions, three panzer grenadier divisions, three independent brigades, ﬁve security divisions, and a training division. On June 22, they were disposed as shown in Table 1.1. The frontline divisions were well dug in and in good positions. All had a forward trench line and two to four backup trench lines. Most of them were covered by mineﬁelds, and the approaches to the German main line of defense were heavily mined. The regiments had plenty of heavy and light machine guns and adequate ammunition. Each division was supported, on the average, by three to four artillery pieces and two assault guns or antitank guns per mile of front, although there was not enough artillery ammunition. There was not enough air support or infantry strength. Luftwaffe Colonel General Ritter Robert von Greim’s 6th Air Fleet had only 839 aircraft, only forty of which were ﬁghters, and he did not have enough fuel to keep them all ﬂying.20 Three years of ﬁghting on the Eastern Front had taken a terrible toll of the German infantry. Not all the German records from this period are extant but the ﬁgures for 4th and 9th Armies are. On June 20, XXVII Corps of 4th Army had three divisions. The 78th Assault Division had an effective strength of 5,712 men, ninety-nine guns, thirty-one assault guns and eighteen self-propelled 88 mm guns. The 25th Panzer Grenadier Division had 2,686 men, ﬁfty-nine guns, forty-ﬁve assault guns and ten selfpropelled 88 mm guns. The 260th Infantry had 2,554 men, ﬁfty-nine guns, and no assault guns or 88s. The corps had twenty-seven assault guns and forty-ﬁve self-propelled 88 mm guns in its GHQ (general headquarters) units. According to the tables of organization, each German division should have had ten to twelve thousand men. Only one of XXVII Corps’s divisions, thereafter, had more than half of its authorized strength. Adolf Hitler’s preoccupation with creating new divisions rather than maintaining the ones he had further contributed to the declining numbers in the veteran divisions. The divisions of the XXXIX Panzer Corps were in worse shape than those of XXVII Corps. The 12th Infantry Division had 3,604 men, fortyseven guns, and ten assault guns; the 31st Infantry had 2,448 men, fortytwo guns, and ten assault guns; the 110th Infantry had 2,590 men, forty-two guns, and six assault guns; and the 337th Infantry Division had 3,775 men, eighty-one guns, and ten assault guns. None had any 88s. The corps commander, however, controlled ﬁfty-eight tanks or assault guns and 10\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\n11\n\nTable 1.1 Order of Battle, Army Group Center, June 22, 1944 ARMY GROUP CENTER: Field Marshal Ernst Busch Chief of Staff: Lieutenant General Hans Krebs 3rd Panzer Army: Colonel General Georg-Hans Reinhardt Chief of Staff: Major General Otto Heidkaemper\n\nIX Corps: General of Artillery Rolf Wuthmann Chief of Staff: Colonel Georg Praefke 252nd Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Walter Melzer Corps Detachment D: Major General Bernhard Pamberg1 LIII Corps: General of Infantry Friedrich Gollwitzer Chief of Staff: Colonel Hans Schmidt 206th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Alfons Hitter 246th Infantry Division: Major General Claus Mueller-Buelow 4th Luftwaffe Field Division: Luftwaffe Lieutenant General Robert Pistorius 6th Luftwaffe Field Division: Lieutenant General Rudolf Peschel VI Corps: General of Artillery Georg Pfeiffer Chief of Staff: Colonel Willy Mantey 197th Infantry Division: Colonel Theodor Preu1 256th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General August Wuestenhagen 299th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Count Ralph von Oriola 4th Army: General of Infantry Kurt von Tippelskirch2 Chief of Staff: Colonel Erich Dethleffsen\n\nXXVII Corps: General of Infantry Paul Voelckers Chief of Staff: Colonel Joachim Staats 25th Panzer Grenadier Division: Major General Paul Schuermann 78th Assault Division: Lieutenant General Hans Traut 260th Infantry Division: Major General Guenther Klammt XXXIX Panzer Corps: General of Artillery Robert Martinek Chief of Staff: Lieutenant Colonel Martinek 12th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Rudolf Bamber 31st Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Wilhelm Ochsner 110th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Eberhard von Kurowski 337th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Otto Schuenemann XII Corps: Lieutenant General Vincenz Mueller Chief of Staff: Colonel Willy Deyhle 18th Panzer Grenadier Division: Lieutenant General Karl Zutavern 57th Infantry Division: Major General Adolf Trowitz 267th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Otto Drescher\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n12\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nTable 1.1 (continued ) 9th Army: General of Infantry Hans Jordan Chief of Staff: Colonel Kurt Gundelach\n\nXXXV Corps: Lieutenant General Baron Kurt-Juergen von Luetzow Chief of Staff: 6th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Walter Heyne 45th Infantry Division: Major General Joachim Engel 134th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Ernst Philipp 296th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Arthur Kullner 383rd Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Edmund Hoffmeister XXXXI Panzer Corps: General of Artillery Hellmuth Weidling Chief of Staff: Colonel Klaus Berger 35th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Johann-Georg Richert 36th Infantry Division: Major General Alexander Conrady 129th Infantry Division: Major General Heribert von Larisch LV Corps: General of Infantry Friedrich Herrlein Chief of Staff: Colonel Johannes Hoelz 102nd Infantry Division: Major General Werner von Bercken 292nd Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Richard John 2nd Army: Colonel General Walter Weiss Chief of Staff: Major General Henning von Tresckow\n\nI Cavalry Corps: Lieutenant General Gustav Harteneck Chief of Staff: Lieutenant Colonel Kniess 1st Hungarian Cavalry Division 4th Cavalry Brigade: Colonel Lothar von Bischoffshausen XXIII Corps: General of Engineers Otto Tiemann Chief of Staff: Colonel Heinz Langmann 7th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Fritz-Georg von Rappard 203rd Security Division: Lieutenant General Rudolf Pilz 17th Special Purposes Brigade Staff VIII Corps3: General of Infantry Gustav Hoehne Chief of Staff: Colonel Eberhard von Schoenfeldt 5th Jaeger Division: Lieutenant General Hellmuth Thumm 211th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Johann Heinrich Eckhardt 12th Hungarian Reserve Division XX Corps3: General of Artillery Baron Rudolf von Roman Chief of Staff: Colonel Wagner Corps Detachment E4: Lieutenant General Maximilian Felzmann 3rd Cavalry Brigade: Colonel Baron Hans von Wolff\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 13\n\n13\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nTable 1.1 (continued ) Army Reserves: 5th Hungarian Reserve Division 23rd Hungarian Reserve Division White Ruthenia Mil.

The XII Corps included the 18th Panzer Grenadier Division (2,787 men, ﬁfty-two guns, no assault guns), the 57th Infantry Division (2,136 men, thirty-eight guns, and six assault guns), and the 267th Infantry Division (2,498 men, forty-six guns, and nine assault guns). It no doubt had some assault guns and 88s in reserve, but this data is missing. The 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion was in 9th Army reserve on June 20. It was equipped with twenty-nine PzKw VI Tiger tanks, which were superior to most Russian armor. The 14th Infantry Division was also in army reserve; although its ﬁgures are also missing, except for the fact that it had eight assault guns. It addition, Panzer Grenadier Division Feldherrnhalle (FHH), which was part of OKH (Hitler’s) reserve, was positioned behind 4th Army. It had thirty-seven tanks and assault guns. Its tanks were PzKw IVs, which typically weighed 19.7 tons. They were considerably lighter than the Soviet main battle tank, the T-34s, which typically weighed 34.7 tons, or the KV-1, which might weigh ﬁfty-two tons or more. (The weight of tanks varied according to model. See Appendix III for a brief description of German and Russian tank characteristics.)\n\n13\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n14 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nIn all, 4th Army had an effective strength of 30,830 men, 362 medium artillery pieces, 205 heavy guns, 246 assault guns, 40 tanks, and 116 selfpropelled 88 mm ﬂak guns, used primarily in an antitank role.21 These ﬁgures, of course, exclude the units not reporting or whose records are missing, as well as any march (replacement) battalions that may have arrived from Germany.22 All in all, 4th Army had about the same strength a strong corps would have had in 1939. Ninth Army was somewhat stronger than 4th Army, having an infantry strength of 43,555, with seven thousand more in corps and army reserve. It also had seventy-six assault guns and 551 pieces of artillery. The 3rd Panzer Army, on Army Group Center’s northern ﬂank, was probably weaker than either 4th or 9th Armies. There were only three assault gun battalions and one heavy tank destroyer battalion (equipped with Hornisse, or Hornet, self-propelled antitank guns) in the entire army. This gave it a strength of sixty to eighty assault guns and tank destroyers. In all, the average frontline division in Army Group Center had to defend ﬁfteen to twenty miles of frontage, in an era when the average division could expect to hold only a six-mile front against a determined attack. (Map 1.2 shows the dispositions of Army Group Center on June 21, 1944.) To make matters worse, replacements were inadequate. Since autumn 1943, almost 33 percent of the replacements sent to Army Group Center were Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) from the occupied territories.23 They were, in general, not nearly as pro-Hitler as the men of the purely German divisions, and had little interest in risking their lives for the Third Reich. By the ﬁfth year of the war, these replacements were considered unreliable. They were an indication that Nazi Germany was losing its real secret weapon: the high quality of its individual soldier. In early May 1944, the Eastern Intelligence Branch of OKH predicted that the Soviet summer offensive would come south of the Pripyat Marshes, through Rumania, Hungary, and Slovakia, and into the Balkans, if it could get that far. Intelligence estimates stated that the sector north of the Pripyat would remain quiet even though Busch was concerned about signs of a troop buildup in the Kovel-Tarnopol area. Lieutenant General Adolf Heusinger, the Ia (chief of operations—see Appendix IV) of OKH, believed that the main attack would come against Model’s Army Group North Ukraine, though he thought a secondary offensive against 2nd Army (the right ﬂank of Army Group Center) was a likely possibility. Colonel General Kurt Zeitzler, the chief of the General Staff of OKH, agreed that the buildup at Kovel-Tarnopol could not be taken lightly and on May 10 proposed creating a reserve army on Busch’s right ﬂank to deal with a possible attack. (Since late 1941, as noted, Adolf Hitler had been commander in chief of OKH, and thus Zeitzler, as his chief executive ofﬁcer, had far more com-\n\n14\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nMap 1.2 Army Group Center, June 21, 1944\n\nPage 15\n\n15\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n16 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nmand prerogatives than the typical chief of staff. He was, in fact, the military head of the High Command of the Army.) On Zeitzler’s orders, OKH began reinforcing General of Infantry Friedrich Hossbach’s LVI Panzer Corps (the nucleus of the reserve army) on Busch’s right with tanks, artillery, and assault gun units.24 After Zeitzler suggested using the proposed reserve army for a surprise offensive, Walter Model, the C-in-C of Army Group North Ukraine, saw an opportunity to take LVI Panzer Corps away from his less alert colleague, Busch. On May 15 he asked the Fuehrer to give him LVI Panzer so he could try “an offensive solution.” This idea, of course, appealed to the offensive-minded dictator, and over the next few days Model bombarded Hitler with intelligence reports (from his own intelligence ofﬁce), suggesting the offensive north of the Carpathians would fall on Army Group North Ukraine and miss Army Group Center altogether. Hitler was soon convinced and on May 29 transferred LVI Panzer Corps to Model. Army Group Center gave up only 6 percent of its front but lost 15 percent of its divisions, 82 percent of its panzers, 23 percent of its assault guns, half of its tank destroyers, and approximately 25 percent of its heavy artillery.25 General Weiss warned Busch that Model was trying to abscond with LVI Panzer, but the ﬁeld marshal ignored him. When Hitler endorsed Model’s plan, Busch surrendered the corps without a single protest.26 Meanwhile, Stalin and Stavka (the Soviet supreme headquarters) decided to concentrate their summer offensive against Army Group Center. It was codenamed Operation Bagration, after General Peter Nanovich Bagration, a prince killed during Napoleon’s invasion of 1812. Stalin concentrated four fronts (each the size of an army group) opposite Army Group Center. North to south, they were the 1st Baltic Front (General Ivan Bagramian), supported by the 3rd Air Army; the 3rd Belorussian Front (General I. D. Chernyakovsky, a tank expert), supported by 1st Air Army; the 2nd Belorussian Front (General Matvei Vasilievich Zakharov), supported by 4th Air Army; and the 1st Belorussian Front (General Konstantin Rokossovskii), supported by 16th Air Army. The 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian Fronts were coordinated by Marshal Alexander Mikhailovich Vasilevskii, while Marshal Georgi Zhukov coordinated the 2nd and 1st Belorussian Fronts. Stalin increased their troop strengths by 60 percent, their tank and selfpropelled gun strength by 300 percent, their artillery by 85 percent, and their already abundant air strength by 62 percent. By June 21, the 700,000 men of Army Group Center were facing 2,500,000 Russians, who were supported by more than 6,000 tanks and assault guns, over forty-ﬁve thousand guns and mortars, and seven thousand aircraft.27 They outnumbered the German 6th Air Fleet 6.5 to one in airplanes and by an incredible ﬁftyeight to one in ﬁghters.28 The Soviet deployment showed real tactical sophistication and showed how far the Red Army had come since 1941. Security and march discipline 16\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 17\n\n17\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nwere very tight, and logistical arrangements were brilliant. By mid-June, Operation Bagration involved 38 percent of all riﬂe divisions in the Soviet Army, 40 percent of all of its tank and mechanized units, and 47 percent of all its aircraft. (The Red Air Force was part of the Soviet Army, not a separate branch of the service.) Although it was not possible to completely hide a buildup of this magnitude, no one on the German side realized how massive a superiority they had achieved by June 22, 1944, when the attack began. General Hans Jordan, the acting commander of 9th Army, was alarmed over the buildup, but Busch hardly reacted at all. He was more concerned about his right ﬂank and the chances of getting LVI Panzer Corps back after Model completed his offensive. Even his own chief of staff, Lieutenant General Hans Krebs, told Zeitzler that the Russians were building up and planning to launch a double envelopment against 9th Army, but he failed to convince the OKH chief that Army Group Center was facing more than a secondary offensive.29 (See Appendix IV for an outline of the various German staff positions.) Busch seemed to agree. He turned down General Reinhardt’s request to pull back the left ﬂank of 3rd Panzer Army in order to shorten his front and gain more divisions. Using one of Hitler’s favorite arguments, he told Reinhardt that such a move would free more Russian than German troops. “Under Busch,” Ziemke wrote, “Headquarters, Army Group Center had become a mindless instrument for transmitting the Fuehrer’s will.”30 In April, Hitler designated Vitebsk, Orsha, Mogilev, and Bobruisk (Bobruysk) “fortiﬁed places,” to be defended to the last man. All were to have a frontline division assigned to them except Vitebsk, which was to be defended by a corps of at least three divisions. Busch again accepted the Fuehrer’s order without question. Back at the front, Jordan, the commander of the 9th Army, appealed to Busch to question the “fortiﬁed places” concept and to retreat to the Dnieper or the Beresina, forty-ﬁve miles farther west, a move that would reduce the army group’s frontage by 150 miles.31 He was backed up by the other army commanders, and their arguments must have been convincing, for on May 20 Busch visited Fuehrer Headquarters and requested permission to withdraw to the Dnieper or the Beresina, although he never questioned the “fortiﬁed places” policy. Hitler coolly rejected Busch’s appeal, cynically remarking that he had not supposed Busch to be one of those generals who was always looking back over his shoulder. The remark was well calculated to inﬂuence Busch’s attitude and subsequent behavior. Never again, he resolved, would he appear “disloyal”: he would accept the Fuehrer’s utterances without question and force his generals to do the same, even if the orders went against his own better judgment.32 One member of his staff wrote that Busch was “a man inadequate to the military task entrusted to him, and 17\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n18 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nwho did not possess even the independence of mind of a man of average common sense.”33 Although Hitler agreed that the major Russian offensive would come in eastern Galicia (east of Lvov), he was concerned about the low strength of 4th Army east of Mogilev. In mid-May, he expressed the wish that he could send it another division, but with the demands of the Italian Front and the Allied invasion looming in the West, he simply did not have one to spare.34 Stalin deliberately waited until after the Allies landed in Normandy to launch his offensive. On the night of June 19–20, 240,000 partisans arose in the Belorussian forests and cut almost all of Army Group Center’s communications and rail lines. They accomplished little else of importance, and their performance—like that of their counterparts in France—varied from mediocre to rather pathetic, even against poorly armed, non-German, collaborationist police units. On June 22—the third anniversary of Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union—the Red Army struck. The initial aerial and artillery bombardment was devastating. Over and above the organic artillery units of the Soviet divisions, corps and armies, Stavka had brought up ten artillery divisions, twenty-one independent artillery brigades, thirty-four independent artillery regiments, three mortar brigades, eighteen mortar regiments, three rocket-launcher divisions (equipped with the multibarreled, truck-mounted “Stalin organs”), a rocket-launcher brigade, and eleven rocket-launcher regiments. Then came the ground assault. The Soviets struck along a three-hundred-mile front with fourteen armies—118 riﬂe divisions in all. On the front line, they faced only thirty-four understrength German divisions. Although they struck all along the front, they focused on six break-in sectors, where they concentrated seventy-seven divisions. In these sectors, the Red committed a riﬂe division along every mile and a half to two miles of front—an average of 1,210 infantrymen per mile. The Germans met them with 131 men per mile. At the front, the Soviets had an infantry superiority of between nine and ten to one in infantry, thirtyﬁve to one in artillery, and ﬁfty-eight to one in ﬁghter aircraft. Their superiority in armor was almost as great. On the northern ﬂank, General of Artillery Rolf Wuthmann’s IX Corps of the 3rd Panzer Army was hit by twenty-nine infantry and eight tank divisions. The VI Corps, south of Vitebsk, was attacked by eighteen infantry and nine tank divisions. The Soviets’ objective was clear: they wanted to encircle General of Infantry Friedrich Gollwitzer’s LIII Corps at Vitebsk which was being pinned down by the Soviet 43rd and 39th Armies.35 Meanwhile, in the army group’s center, 4th Army was also under heavy attack. General of Infantry Paul Voelckers’s XXVII Corps was facing twenty-ﬁve infantry and eleven tank divisions, and the XXXIX Panzer 18\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 19\n\n19\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nMap 1.3 The Destruction of Army Group Center\n\nCorps met sixteen infantry and two armored divisions.36 The next day, the offensive was extended to the zone of 9th Army, where the XXXXI Panzer Corps was smashed by twenty-three infantry and seven tank divisions, and XXXV Corps tried to hold against twenty-seven infantry and six tank divisions.37 By now, Stalin had committed almost two hundred divisions, with six thousand tanks and assault guns, supported by seven thousand aircraft.38 He was opposed by only thirty-four divisions with a few depleted tank regiments and forty aircraft (and these ﬁgures include Weiss’s 2nd Army, which was not in Stalin’s zone of attack). Busch’s four mobile divisions—the 20th Panzer and 18th, 25th, and 60th Panzer Grenadier Divisions—had only about four hundred tanks and armored ﬁghting vehicles combined. When the divisional assault gun battalions are factored in, German armored strength increases somewhat, but even by the most conservative estimates Army Group Center was outnumbered in 19\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n20 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\narmor by a ratio of 5:5 to one.39 Map 1.3 shows the development of the offensive. Busch was at the Berghof, where Hitler had his command post, when word of the offensive began, so he rushed back to his headquarters at Minsk without keeping his appointment with Hitler. Yet there was little he could do. By June 23, Corps Detachment D was smashed, the 252nd Infantry Division had lost Obol, 3rd Panzer Army had committed its last reserves, and the Red Army was closing in on Vitebsk from the north (see Map 1.4). Busch reported that he could not close 3rd Panzer Army’s front without more divisions and asked for reinforcements from Army Group North Ukraine. He did not want to take troops away from 2nd Army, he said, because he still expected a Soviet attack toward Brest. OKH, meanwhile, took the 24th Infantry Division (along with the attached 909th Assault Gun Brigade) from Army Group North, assigned them to 3rd Panzer Army, and ordered Reinhardt to counterattack, rescue the 252nd Infantry, and restore the situation on Army Group Center’s left ﬂank. Wuthmann’s IX Corps, however, was having a difﬁcult time even holding its positions. By nightfall on June 23, Russian tanks were within ﬁve miles of the Headquarters 3rd Panzer Army.40 South of Vitebsk, Pfeiffer’s VI Corps was also in serious trouble. The 197th, 299th, and 256th Infantry Divisions were subjected to massive attacks and were broken through in several places. General Pfeiffer managed to contain the penetrations only by using his last reserves. General of Infantry Kurt Tippelskirch, the acting commander of the 4th Army, gave him Major General Herbert Michaelis’s 95th Infantry Division (then in 4th Army reserve), which he used to stabilize an eight-mile section of the front along the Pskov-Kiev road. It was not enough. The Reds broke through 197th Infantry Division and pushed it northwestwards, into the Vitebsk salient. By nightfall, the corridor to LIII Corps in Vitebsk was less than fourteen miles wide. Early in the afternoon, Busch signaled OKH that 3rd Panzer Army could not restore the situation with its own resources. He recommended that LIII Corps be allowed to retreat and that Vitebsk be abandoned. He also called for reinforcements. Heusinger agreed and recommended that Army Group Center be granted the freedom of initiative to retreat to the Dnieper, but Hitler refused to permit any withdrawal. Meanwhile, on June 23, the front of the 4th Army began to crumble. All along the line the Russians were attacking with a newfound tactical skill, and even the veteran German divisions were no longer able to separate their infantry from the tanks. Soviet air-ground, ground-artillery, and close-air support was excellent; for the ﬁrst time in the war, the Russian tactical performance neared German standards. After three years of ﬁghting, the Soviet commanders had ﬁnally learned how to attack with tactical sophistication.\n\n20\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center Map 1.4 The Vitebsk Salient\n\nPage 21\n\n21\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n22 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nColonel General Gotthard Heinrici, the distinguished veteran commander of the 4th Army, had been away on sick leave since June 5. General von Tippelskirch, the acting commander, estimated that at the main focal points of the attack, one German battalion was ﬁghting one Soviet division.41 He signaled Krebs that XXXIX Panzer Corps was being attacked by ten Soviet divisions, while XXVII Corps was being attacked by a dozen more. He proposed that the army be allowed to retreat behind the Dnieper, but Busch refused to consider it. “Any voluntary abandonment of parts of the main line still intact is out of the question,” he said.42 Tippelskirch had no choice but to try to halt the Russians at the front. He committed his main reserve. Lieutenant General Friedrich-Karl von Steinkeller’s newly arrived 60th Panzer Grenadier Division “Feldherrnhalle” to the sector of the XXXIX Panzer Corps, with orders to stop up the hole east of Mogilev. General of Artillery Robert Martinek, the panzer corps commander, who did not have a single panzer unit, was astonished by this order. He asked Steinkeller just which hole he proposed to plug. “We’ve got nothing but holes here,” he said. “Your place is back on the Berezina, so that we should have an interception line there for when we can’t hold out on the Dnieper any longer. And that will be pretty soon!”43 But Hitler and Busch insisted that the front line be held. General Traut’s 78th Assault Division—one of the best in the German Army—was overwhelmed, and XXVII Corps began to buckle. By June 24, it had knocked out 116 Soviet tanks since the offensive began, and the XXXIX Panzer destroyed thirty that day alone, but at a very heavy cost. The XXVII Corps was crushed. Busch sent it the only unit immediately available, the 2nd Security Regiment—a bicycle unit—and ordered it to hold the Russians on the Pskov-Kiev road southwest of Orekhovsk. This the XXVII Corps could not do.44 By nightfall, 120 Soviet tanks had broken through. Things were no better in the zone of the XXXIX Panzer, where General Martinek signaled that the 337th Infantry Division now consisted of nothing but remnants. Only the divisions of Lieutenant General Vincenz Mueller’s XII Corps managed to hold their positions, and only with difﬁculty. In the zone of the 9th Army, the Russians ﬁred a ninety-minute artillery barrage and then launched two major attacks. One was northeast of Bobruisk against XXXV Corps, the other to the south against XXXXI Panzer Corps. The former targeted the extreme right ﬂank of Lieutenant General Trowitz’s 57th Infantry Division (of the XII Corps), which was situated at the junction of the 4th and 9th Armies. It collapsed, and the Russians pushed beyond the German front. Army Group Center reacted quickly and placed all forces in the sector under the command of the 9th Army. It also released Major General Gustav Gihr’s 707th Infantry Division to 9th Army, with orders to clean up the breakthrough. Busch also released 20th Panzer 22\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 23\n\n23\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nDivision to 9th Army, but only one unit at a time, to help it regain contact with 4th Army and restore its front. At ﬁrst, it looked as if the situation might, in fact, be quickly restored. The XXXV Corps knocked out eighty enemy tanks during the day, the 707th Infantry’s counterattack achieved a measure of success, and to the south, XXXXI Panzer repulsed several Russian attacks; however, the Soviets managed to break through northwest of Cherven, at the junctions of the of the 36th and 35th Infantry Divisions. By nightfall, they had created a gap three miles wide at its spearhead and twelve miles wide at its base, and were already eight miles behind the original German front. The XXXXI Panzer Corps signaled 9th Army that it was under attack by ﬁfteen infantry divisions and three tank units. General Jordan responded by transfering two infantry battalions and ﬁve batteries from LV Corps on his right ﬂank, which was not under heavy attack. At 10 P.M. that night, Jordan ordered the 20th Panzer Division to turn about and head south, to deal with the threat to XXXXI Corps. It would, however, take a considerable amount of time to reconcentrate the division and move it from one ﬂank of 9th Army to the other. Busch met with Zeitzler at army group HQ in Minsk on June 24. By now the Soviets were attacking along more than 430 miles of frontage with more than two hundred divisions, all at or near full strength. Army Group Center faced them in the zones under attack with only twenty-eight divisions, almost all of which were very much understrength. Even now, however, the ﬁeld marshal did not appeal for permission to conduct a general withdrawal, but, weakening from his previous resolution, he did ask permission to abandon Vitebsk and pull 3rd Panzer Army back to the southwest. Zeitzler, the chief of the General Staff, put this proposal to Hitler that afternoon but was turned down. All the Fuehrer would do was order the 212th and 290th Infantry (from Army Group North) and 5th Panzer Divisions (from Army Group North Ukraine) to Army Group Center. It would take days for them to arrive. Busch telephoned Hitler personally that evening, but the Fuehrer would not be persuaded: LIII Corps was to stay in the city.45 Meanwhile, inside the Vitebsk “fortiﬁed area,” the situation was deteriorating rapidly. In the salient, it was the same old story: too few men to defend too much space. At Vitebsk, General Gollwitzer had only four depleted divisions—the 206th and 246th Infantry and the 4th and 6th Luftwaffe Field—to hold ﬁfty-ﬁve miles of frontage. The total infantry strength of all four was 8,123, giving him an average strength of 150 men per mile of combat zone—about one man every twelve yards. His reserves consisted of one Luftwaffe special-services battalion, a battalion of heavy artillery, and two antitank companies—hardly enough to check two full Soviet ar23\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n24 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nmies. By the end of the ﬁrst day of the offensive, Vitebsk was two-thirds surrounded. “What can I do? What can I do?” Busch muttered to his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Krebs. It never occurred to him to take matters into his own hands. It was probably too late now in any event; the “fortiﬁed place” was already surrounded, and the Russians were rapidly pushing the rest of 3rd Panzer Army—IX and VI Corps—away from Vitebsk.46 Sixth Corps on the right ﬂank was in particularly poor condition. It had been attacked for four days by the Soviet 5th Tank Army (supported by more than ﬁve hundred heavy guns) and had almost been overwhelmed. All of its divisions were crushed, and Major General Count Ralph von Oriola’s 299th Infantry Division was overrun on the morning of June 25. The corps, with the 95th, 14th, 256th, and 299th Infantry Divisions, was pushed into the zone of the 4th Army, which took control of it around noon. The veteran corps commander, General of Artillery Georg Pfeiffer, was fatally wounded in a Soviet air attack outside Mogilev about 8 P.M. on June 28 while trying to rally the pitiful remnants of his command. Certainly there was nothing he could have done on June 23, 24, or 25 to save Vitebsk.47 During the course of the battle, Hitler ordered that the Luftwaffe parachute a staff ofﬁcer into Vitebsk to make sure that Gollwitzer understood that he was expected to hold until the end. Busch, naturally, passed the order down. The idea for this suicide mission was not dropped until General Reinhardt signaled Busch: “Tell the Fuehrer that if he stands by his order, there is only one ofﬁcer in 3rd Panzer Army that can carry it out, and that is the commander. I am ready to execute the order!” Busch passed this dispatch on to OKH. An hour later, Hitler rescinded his order.48 On the evening of June 24, Hitler ﬁnally decided to allow General Gollwitzer to break out of Vitebsk with three of his four divisions, leaving only Lieutenant General Alfons Hitter’s 206th Infantry Division behind. Gollwitzer disobeyed the spirit of Hitler’s orders and carried most of the 206th with him when he cut his way out on June 25; however, LIII Corps only got a dozen miles before being surrounded again the next day. Lieutenant Generals Robert Pistorius and Rudolf Peschel, the commanders of the 4th and 6th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, were both killed as the Russians compressed the pocket. Gollwitzer ﬁnally gave up on the morning of June 27. He had 270 men with him when he surrendered, two-thirds of them wounded. General Hitter capitulated the same day. Twenty-seven thousand men were lost, most of them captured during the breakout.49 On the southern edge of the cauldron, the 1st Belorussian Front threw its full weight into the attack on June 24. On June 25, General Jordan requested permission to withdraw his 9th Army from the huge pocket form24\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 25\n\n25\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\ning between the Dnieper and the Beresina, but Busch retorted that the army’s mission was to hold every foot of ground and not to give up anything voluntarily. “Having made a responsible report, one must accept the orders of his superiors even when he is convinced of the opposite,” General Jordan wrote in 9th Army’s war diary. “What is worse is to know that the completely inadequate direction from the army group is not a product of purposeful leadership trying to do its utmost but merely an attempt to carry out orders long overtaken by events.”50 Jordan delayed several hours before committing his only sizable reserve, the 20th Panzer Division, to the battle on his southern ﬂank, probably because he did not want to sacriﬁce it needlessly. Then it was delayed several more hours by the poor roads, which were now clogged with panicstricken fugitives and refugees. When it did attack, it knocked out sixty Soviet tanks in one day (June 25), but it had only seventy-one operational tanks to begin with, and about half of these were PzKw IVs, which were marginal weapons on the Eastern Front in 1944. They were opposed by three hundred Russian tanks. The 20th Panzer Division lost about half of its tanks in this battle.51 It could not prevent the Russians from breaking through General Edmund Hoffmeister’s XXXXI Panzer Corps with strong armored forces and heading for Bobruisk. On Hoffmeister’s left ﬂank, meanwhile, the XXXV Corps was torn to bits on June 25. By nightfall, the XXXXI Panzer and XXXV Corps had knocked out 120 enemy tanks, but the 134th and 296th Infantry Divisions were smashed, the 35th Infantry Division was in remnants, and the rapidly moving Russians were bypassing the 707th and 134th Infantry Divisions southwest of Buda. It is perhaps ironic that the German Army, which in 1940 stunned the world with its blitzkrieg method of mobile warfare, was the least mobile major army in Europe in 1944. This truth is not due to the fact that the German Army had retrogressed; the others had caught up with and then surpassed the Wehrmacht in every area of mobility. Anglo-Saxon (and primarily American) methods of mass production had irrevocably tilted the balance of power against it. The German panzer and panzer grenadier branches constituted only about 10.8 percent of the German Army in 1944. The vast majority of the German divisions were made up of horse-drawn units. In the typical infantry division, the only fully motorized unit was the ambulance company. The Red Army, on the other hand, had been so liberally supplied with American Lend-Lease equipment (especially 2.5-ton trucks) that it was one of the most mobile armies in the world by 1944. (The word Studebaker would be synonymous with truck in the USSR for many years to come.) Once the Soviets got behind a German infantry division—as was happening now—the German foot soldiers had little chance of catching up. They could only hope to escape, and even this depended on their comrades’ stabilizing the front, so that they themselves would not have too far to travel. 25\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n26 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nOn June 26, Busch ﬂew to Obersalzburg and met with Hitler to try to get him to change his inﬂexible defense policies, but without success. The ﬁeld marshal was accompanied by General Jordan, who had been ordered to Fuehrer Headquarters to explain his hesitant and confused instructions regarding the employment of the 20th Panzer Division. The meeting satisﬁed no one. Busch, possibly acting on Hitler’s orders, sacked Jordan for irresolute leadership on June 27 and replaced him with General of Artillery Helmuth Weidling, the former commander of XXXXI Panzer Corps.52 Weidling acted until his permanent replacement, General of Panzer Troops Nikolaus von Vormann, could arrive.53 But it was again too late: the Russians virtually destroyed XXXXI Panzer Corps in three days of heavy ﬁghting, bypassed Bobruisk, and fanned out behind 9th Army.54 It is true that Jordan had initially committed the 20th Panzer too far north and too early, and then hesitated to commit it at the proper place; later, however, even if he had committed it a day sooner and had used it in the best theoretically possible manner, it would not have made the slightest difference. Of the hundred thousand men in 9th Army, only thirty thousand escaped. Hoffmeister was among those captured, and the thirty-four thousand men of Lieutenant General Baron Kurt-Jurgen von Luetzow’s XXXV Corps were surrounded in Bobruisk, where they came under heavy attack from the second wave of Soviet assault divisions. When Luetzow ﬁnally surrendered on June 29, only sixteen thousand of his men were left alive.55 Four more German divisions had been destroyed. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Generals Ernst Phillipp and Karl Zutavern, the commanders of the 134th Infantry and the 18th Panzer Grenadier Divisions, respectively, committed suicide rather than surrender to the Russians.56 On June 25, 4th Army also faced an impossible situation. Its center (XXXIX Panzer Corps) was penetrated and overwhelmed, and the armies to its north and south—3rd Panzer and 9th—were collapsing. General von Tippelskirch took matters into his own hands and ordered a retreat to the Berezina River, without informing Army Group Center. Busch countermanded the order as soon as he learned of it, gave Tippelskirch a heated dressing-down, and instructed 4th Army to stand fast where it was, but Tippelskirch ignored this order as well. He instructed Generals Voelkers and Martinek, the commanders of the XXVII Army and XXXIX Panzer Corps, respectively, to post rearguards in their present positions and to continue the retreat with their main forces. He also warned them to be careful what they said in dispatches to army group. Clearly Tippelskirch was contravening his orders, but both corps commanders elected to obey him rather than Busch and his chief of staff, General Krebs. “It was Hitler’s destructive orders to hold ﬁrm that . . . brought about the collapse of the principle of order and obedience,” General Gerd Niepold wrote later. “To 26\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 27\n\n27\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nthe commanders in the ﬁeld, loyalty to their troops meant more than obedience to these nonsensical and pigheaded orders.”57 In addition to exhibiting great skill in deception, Tippelskirch also demonstrated considerable tactical ability during his retreat, despite the fact that the Red Air Force launched a rare carpet-bombing raid on its headquarters during the night of June 26–27, destroying most of its communications equipment in the process. He fell back in the direction of Minsk and had the Benezina River bridges wired for demolition. Tippelskirch had no choice but to make a stand east of Minsk, however, or he would have to write off the XXXIX Panzer and XXVII Corps. As he prepared to defend the city with security troops and whatever odds and ends he could ﬁnd (including ﬁve police regiments and the remnants of the 31st and 267th Infantry Divisions), the ﬁrst—and the best—of Hitler’s reinforcements reached the battleﬁeld. Map 1.5 shows the situation in the zone of Army Group Center at nightfall on June 26. The Red Army began to close in on Minsk on June 27, just as the 5th Panzer Division arrived in the city. It was greeted by a scene that could have demoralized any division. Complete pandemonium reigned. The roads were jammed with stragglers, many of them unarmed, ﬂeeing in a disorganized mob, just trying to get out of Russia. The 5th Panzer, however, did not panic. Exceptionally well led by Lieutenant General Karl Decker,58 it was one of the best units in the Wehrmacht. Its men had fought in Poland, Belgium, and France and had spent three years on the Russian Front. It was also very strong by 1944 standards, boasting seventy Panthers and ﬁfty-ﬁve PzKw IVs. Also attached to the division was the 505th Heavy Panzer Battalion, which had twenty-nine ultramodern Tigers (PzKw VIs). Although its men were startled by what they saw in Minsk, they were by no means demoralized. Tippelskirch assigned the task of defending Minsk and maintaining contact with the 3rd Panzer Army to a tough, highly decorated, and highly competent East Prussian, Lieutenant General Dietrich von Saucken. The thin, dark-haired Saucken had already distinguished himself as commander of the 4th Panzer Division and until recently, had served as deputy commander of the III Panzer Corps. Originally a cavalry ofﬁcer, he habitually wore both a sword and a monocle. Around himself, Saucken formed Group von Saucken, an ad hoc corps headquarters drawn largely from staff ofﬁcers serving in the rear area of the XXXIX Panzer Corps. (After the XXXIX Panzer broke up, Group von Saucken was upgraded and became the Staff, XXXIX Panzer Corps.) He posted the 5th Panzer Division at Krupki Station, northeast of the city and east of the Berezina, where he expected the main Soviet blow to fall. The objective of the 5th Panzer Division was clear: keep the escape routes across the Berezina open as long as possible. 27\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n28\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nMap 1.5 Army Group Center, Nightfall, June 26, 1944\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 29\n\n29\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nSaucken and Decker positioned the 5th Panzer Division perfectly, just as the 3rd Guards Tank Corps—the spearhead of the 3rd Belorussian Front— approached Krupki Station. Unfortunately for Decker, the division’s 31st Panzer Regiment (which was coming by rail) had not yet arrived, but he did have the 505th Heavy Panzer Battalion, the 5th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion, the 89th Panzer Engineer Battalion, and the 13th and 31st Panzer Grenadier Regiments in position when the ﬁrst blow fell. The 3rd Guards Tank ran into an inferno near Krupki Station on the evening of June 28; it was slaughtered by the Tigers of the 505th Heavy Panzer. Although they were vastly superior in numbers, the Russians were equipped with M4A2 Sherman tanks, which had little chance against the more heavily gunned Tigers, whose 88 mm guns had a longer range than the 75 mm main gun on the American-made tanks. The Soviets, however, continued to attack all night, largely because darkness neutralized the superior range of the Tigers. The Reds ﬁnally captured Krupki Station about 7 A.M. on June 29, but at the cost of dozens of AFVs. An entire corps had been decimated by a reinforced battalion. With Krupki Station in their hands, the Russians tried to push on to the Berezina at Borisov and outﬂank the 5th Panzer Division. Instead, they ran into an ambush prepared by the 89th Panzer Engineer Battalion. Again checked, the Soviets tried farther north, where they committed the 29th Tank Corps. They reached the Berezina at Studenka but found the crossing sites defended by the 5th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. Once more, the Russians were checked. By this point, ﬁve motorized riﬂe divisions from the 11th Guards Army had caught up with the Soviet vanguards. General Pavel Rotmistrov, the commander of the 5th Tank Army, threw them into action near the village of Kostritsa, which was stubbornly defended by the 31st Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The Reds were halted again in heavy ﬁghting. If Tippelskirch had had ﬁve or six divisions of the strength and quality of the 5th Panzer, he might have won the Battle of Minsk. But he did not, and the 5th could not be everywhere at once. By nightfall on June 29, the Soviet 29th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps had outﬂanked the 5th Panzer Division and had crossed the Berezina north of Borisov. South of that town, two riﬂe divisions from the 11th Guards Army had defeated Tippelskirch’s police regiments and were fording the river. South of that, the Soviet 31st Army had brushed aside the remnants of the 31st and 267th Infantry Divisions and was crossing the river at several points. That was enough for General Decker. He ordered the 31st Panzer Grenadier Regiment to retreat to Borisov, and then he fell back across the river with most of his division. (Group von Saucken, reinforced with elements of the 5th Panzer Division, managed to hold a bridgehead on the east bank near Shukovets until the night of July 2–3.) As the Germans retreated, an 29\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n30 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\naggressive Soviet vanguard pursued them and tried to capture the bridge intact. The panzer engineers waited until most of them were on the bridge and two Shermans were actually across it; then they blew it up, trapping the tanks and a few infantrymen in the process. As the 5th Panzer Division prepared for the next onslaught, the Soviet command inadvertently paid it perhaps the highest compliment imaginable from an enemy. It signaled its units: “If you meet the 5th Panzer, try to go round them.”59 On June 28, Busch signaled Tippelskirch to fall back behind the Berezina. He was already there by this time, but he had lost 130,000 of his 165,000 men.60 He had been forced to leave behind XXVII and XII Corps, which were trapped in a large pocket that was forming east of Minsk. Due to Hitler’s orders, 4th Army also left behind Lieutenant General Hans Traut’s 78th Assault Division, at Fortiﬁed Place Orsha, where it was surrounded and forced to surrender on June 27.61 Ninth Army also had to leave behind a division, Lieutenant General Rudolf Bamler’s 12th Infantry, at Fortiﬁed place Mogilev,62 to reinforce the city garrison, which was led by Major General Gottfried von Erdmannsdorff. After a determined resistance, both the garrison and the division were destroyed. Bamler and Erdmannsdorff capitulated on June 30 (Stalin later had Erdmannsdorff hanged.)63 Had Tippelskirch obeyed Busch, as Busch obeyed Hitler, 4th Army would have been completely wiped out. As things were, 4th and 9th Armies were mere shells, and 3rd Panzer Army was down to three understrength divisions with a total of only seventy guns.64 The full extent of the disaster can be seen by comparing Table 1.1 with Table 1.2. Even though Army Group Center had received massive reinforcements by July 15 (Table 1.2), it is clear that it had been smashed. Several ad hoc battle groups had been formed under men like Lieutenant General Hermann Floerke and Major General Friedrich Stephan, the commanders of the virtually defunct 14th and 267th Infantry Divisions, respectively.65 They controlled the shattered remnants of various commands and tried to restore them to some combat value, but with mixed results. Note also that four full corps, including ﬁfteen infantry, two security, two Luftwaffe Field, and three panzer or panzer grenadier divisions, were simply listed as “whereabouts unknown” as late as July 15.66 By any measurement, the disaster was enormous. Table 1.3 shows the senior commanders killed, captured, or missing from Army Group Center alone; it gives the reader an idea of the magnitude of the disaster. Among the units caught up in 4th Army’s disaster was the 60th Panzer Grenadier Division, which was needlessly sacriﬁced. On the evening of June 25, about a hundred Russian tanks broke through the division at Sukhari, on the Dnieper.

He was replaced by Lieutenant General Otto Schuenemann of the 337th Infantry Division, who tried to break out to the west, but it was too late by then. The next day, near Pagost, Schuenemann was also killed, the XXXIX Panzer Corps disintegrated, and its divisions ceased to exist.68 Hitler sacked Busch later on June 28 and replaced him with Field Marshal Model. The unemployed army group commander took up temporary residence at the Neuhammer Training Camp, where, on the orders of OKH, he was visited on or about July 9 by Captain Alexander Stahlberg. The captain unfolded a current situation map and placed it on a large table. When Busch “saw what had become of his Army Group in the few days since his dismissal,” Stahlberg recalled, “he clapped both hands to his face, gave a loud cry and ﬂung his massive body across the map.”69 Busch was deeply hurt by his dismissal, for he had just been obeying orders. This was true enough, but in the process he had lost more than 300,000 men and twenty-eight divisions, as well as 215 tanks and more than 1,500 guns.70 Naturally, most of the units that escaped were noncombat service-support and rear-area units. Army Group Center had been virtually eliminated as a combat force. It was the greatest disaster Germany ever suffered on the Eastern Front. It was now up to Walter Model, the “Fuehrer’s Fireman,” to save something from the wreckage. 33\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n34\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\nTable 1.3 Senior Ofﬁcer Casualties in Army Group Center, Summer 1944 3rd Panzer Army\n\n14th Panzer Grenadier Division: Lieutenant General Floerke, Killed in Action 95th Infantry Division: Major General Michaelis, Killed in Action LIII Corps: General of Infantry Gollwitzer, Captured 246th Infantry Division: Major General Mueller-Buelow, Captured 4th Luftwaffe Field Division: Lieutenant General Pistorius, Killed in Action 6th Luftwaffe Field Division: Lieutenant General Peschel, Killed in Action 206th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Hitter, Captured VI Corps: General of Artillery Pfeiffer, Killed in Action 197th Infantry Division: Colonel Hahne, Missing in Action 299th Infantry Division: Major General von Junck, Missing in Action 256th Infantry Division: Major General Wuestenhagen, Killed in Action 4th Army\n\nXXXIX Panzer Corps: General of Artillery Martinek, Killed in Action 110th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General von Kurowski, Captured 337th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Schuenemann, Killed in Action 12th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Bamler, Captured 31st Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Ochsner, Captured XII Corps: Lieutenant General Vinzenz Mueller, Captured 18th Panzer Grenadier Division, Lieutenant General Zutavern, committed suicide 267th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Drescher, Killed in Action 57th Infantry Division: Major General Trowitz, Captured XXVII Corps: General of Infantry Voelckers, Captured 78th Assault Division: Lieutenant General Traut, Captured 260th Infantry Division: Major General Klammt, Captured 9th Army\n\n9th Army Engineer Commander: Major General Aurel Schmidt, Captured XXXV Corps: Lieutenant General Baron von Luetzow, Captured 134th Infantry Division: Lieutenant General Philipp, committed suicide 6th Infantry Division: Major General Heyne, Captured 383rd Infantry Division: Major General Hamann, Killed in Action 45th Infantry Division: Major General Engel, Captured XXXXI Panzer Corps: Lieutenant General Hoffmeister, Captured 36th Infantry Division: Major General Conrady, Captured 2nd Army\n\n3rd Cavalry Brigade: Colonel Baron Hans von Wolff, Killed in Action 3rd Cavalry Brigade: Lieutenant Colonel Baron Georg von Boeselager, Killed in Action Reserves\n\n707th Infantry Division: Major General Gihr, Captured 60th “Feldherrnhalle” Panzer Grenadier Division: Major General von Steinkeller, Captured\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nPage 35\n\n35\n\nThe Cannae of Army Group Center\n\nTable 1.3 (continued ) Reserves\n\nCommandant of Brest-Litovsk: Lieutenant General Walter Scheller, Killed in Action Commander, 3rd Panzer Army Weapons School: Colonel Baron Constantin Digeon von Monteton, Killed in Action Sources: Paul Carell, Scorched Earth, pp. 596–97; Wolf Keilig, Die Generale, ff. 1; Alex Buchner, Ostfront 1944, pp. 241–43; Gerhard von Seemen, pp. 27, 90.\n\nNOTES 1.

Between the day Hitler became chancellor (January 30, 1933) and the day he committed suicide (April 30, 1945), the German Army’s General Staff had no less than six chiefs of staff: General of Infantry Wilhelm Adam (1930–33), Colonel General Ludwig Beck (1933–38), Colonel General Franz Halder (1938–42), Colonel General Kurt Zeitzler (1942–44), Colonel General Heinz Guderian (July 21, 1944–45), and General of Infantry Hans Krebs (April 1–May 2, 1945). Guderian and Krebs both served as “acting” chiefs only. 3. Paul Carell, Scorched Earth: The Russian-German War 1943–1944 (Boston: 1966; reprint ed., New York: 1971) p. 596. 4. Louis L.

Georg-Hans Reinhardt was one of the earliest panzer generals and was a highly capable army commander. Born in 1887, he joined the army as a Fahnenjunker (ofﬁcer cadet) in the infantry in 1907. Later he served as commander, 1st Riﬂe Brigade (a motorized unit) (1937–38); 4th Panzer Division (1938–40), XXXXI Panzer Corps (1940–41), and 3rd Panzer Group (October 5, 1941). Third Panzer Group was upgraded to 3rd Panzer Army on January 1, 1942, the same day Reinhardt was promoted to colonel general. He fought in Poland, France, and Russia. He became commander in chief of Army Group Center on August 16, 1944. Hitler relieved him of his command for retreating without orders on January 25, 1945. Reinhardt, however, had been critically wounded when a bullet struck him in the head some hours before; word had not yet reached Fuehrer Headquarters. General Reinhardt recovered from his wound, retired to Tegernsee, and died on November 22, 1971. 18. Zeimke, p. 193. 19. David Irving, Hitler’s War (New York: 1977), p. 674; Ziemke, pp. 311–12. 20.

March, or replacement (Ersatz), battalions were formed in Germany by the Wehrkreise (military districts) of the Replacement (or Home) Army in Germany. They were then sent to the ﬁeld armies, where they were broken up and their men sent to individual units. They were formed for security purposes (partisans infested much of the German rear by 1942), but they could ﬁght as units in emergencies. 23.

He was chief representative of the Fuehrer at OKH (1944–45) before being named acting chief of staff of OKH (March 29, 1945). At the end of the Battle of Berlin he committed suicide, probably on May 2. Krebs was promoted to general of infantry on August 1, 1944. 30. Ziemke, pp. 205, 315–16. 31.

Friedrich Gollwitzer joined the Bavarian 13th Infantry Regiment in 1908 and was a colonel when World War II began. He successively commanded the 41st Infantry Regiment (1935–39), the 193rd Replacement Division (1939–40), 88th Infantry Division (1940–43) and LIII Corps (assumed command June 22, 1943).

He later served as commander of the 30th Infantry Division (early 1941–42); German liaison ofﬁcer to the Italian 8th Army on the Eastern Front (1942–43); Commander, XII Corps (1943); and acting commander, 4th Army (June 4–July 18, 1944). 42.

Carell, Scorched Earth, p. 581. 47. The VI Corps lost contact with 3rd Panzer Army on June 25 and was transferred to the control of 4th Army. Georg Pfeiffer fought in World War I and, like many ofﬁcers of his era, spent the years 1920 to 1935 in the police. He commanded the 37th Artillery Regiment (1937–39), the 105th Artillery Command (1939–40), the 94th Infantry Division (1940–43), the 306th Infantry Division (1943–44), and VI Corps (assumed command, May 20, 1944). He was promoted to general of artillery on May 1, 1944 (Keilig, p. 255). 48. Haupt, Center, p. 196. 49. Seaton, p. 436; Carell, Scorched Earth, pp. 583–86, 596. According to Soviet sources, LIII Corps lost twenty thousand killed and ten thousand captured. Gollwitzer stated after the war that LIII Corps lost ﬁve thousand killed and twenty-two thousand captured at Vitebsk. Soviet sources are, of course, notoriously unreliable. Zaloga, Bagration, p. 53. 50. Zeimke, p. 321. 51. The 20th Panzer Division had not had a panzer regiment for some time. Because of high casualties during the Soviet winter offensive of 1941–42, the I and II Battalions of the 21st Panzer Regiment (the tank regiment of the 20th Panzer Division) were dissolved in early 1942. Their survivors were incorporated into the III Battalion, which became the 21st Panzer Battalion. The 21st Panzer Regiment was dissolved. 37\n\n01Chp01_pp001-040_FINAL_WR\n\n38 Crumbling Empire\n\n12/5/06\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 38\n\nTHE GERMAN DEFEAT IN THE EAST, 1944–45\n\n52. For reasons not made clear by the records, General Jordan had relieved Weidling of the command of the XXXXI Panzer Corps on June 20 and replaced him with Hoffmeister. Now Weidling replaced the man who had replaced him. 53. Hans Jordan, a holder to the Knight’s Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, held no further commands until April 1945, when he was placed in charge of the German defenses in the Tyrol (Alpine Italy). He lived in Munich after the war. An artillery ofﬁcer, Helmuth Weidling had commanded the 56th and 20th Artillery Regiments (1939–40), the 128th Artillery Command (1940–41), and the 86th Infantry Division (1942–43) before taking charge of the XXXXI Panzer Corps. In April 1945, he was named commander of the LVI Panzer Corps and battle commander for Berlin. He surrendered the capital of the Reich to the Russians on May 3, 1945, four days after Adolf Hitler shot himself. Weidling died in a Soviet prison in the 1950s. Nikolaus von Vormann was a West Prussian. He served on the Fuehrer Headquarters staff (1939), was chief of staff of the XXVIII Corps (1940–42), commander of the 23rd Panzer Division (1942–43) and commander of the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps (1943–44). At the end of the war, Vormann was named commander of the famous Alpine Redoubt, which hardly existed. He lived in Berchtesgaden after the war. 54. Gackenholz, pp. 370–71. 55. The son of an ancient Prussian military family, Baron Kurt-Juergen von Luetzow entered the service in 1914. During World War II, he served as the commander the 89th Infantry Regiment (1939–42), the 12th Infantry Division (1942–44), and the XXXV Corps (from June 25, 1944, until the surrender). He was not released by the Russians until 1956. 56. Carell, Scorched Earth, pp. 580, 597. 57. Niepold, p. 106. Gerd Niepold was Ia of the 12th Panzer Division during the Battle of White Russia. A War Academy graduate and a member of the General Staff, he fought in Poland and France and served almost four years on the Eastern Front before being transferred to the War Academy staff near the end of the conﬂict. Returning to school after the war, he qualiﬁed as a construction engineer and spent several years as an architect in Frankfurt-am-Main before joining the West German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) in 1956. Here he commanded a panzer brigade, a mechanized division, and III Corps at Kolbenz. His Battle for White Russia is a major source on this campaign. Niepold was born in Stargard, Pomerania (now part of Poland), in 1913 and joined the 11th Infantry Regiment as a Fahnenjunker in 1932. He has a son (a lawyer and civil servant) and a daughter (an art and design teacher). 58. Karl Decker was born in Pomerania in 1897 and entered the army as a Fahnenjunker a few weeks after World War I broke out. An excellent panzer ofﬁcer and combat leader, he commanded the 1st Anti-Tank Battalion (1936–40), I/3rd Panzer Regiment (1940–41), 3rd Panzer Regiment (1941–43), 21st Panzer Brigade (1943), 5th Panzer Division (1943–44), and XXXIX Panzer Corps (1944–45). He was promoted rapidly: to lieutenant colonel (1939), colonel (1942), major general (1943), lieutenant general (June 1, 1944), and general of panzer troops (January 1, 1945). Trapped in the Ruhr Pocket and despairing over the fact that Germany had lost the war, General Decker took his own life on April 21, 1945, rather than surrender to the Americans. 38"
