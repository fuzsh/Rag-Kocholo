They ought to be ?accepted with friendliness as equal members??On the press: He criticizes William Randolph Heart by name, but says ?The freedom of the press is necessary, despite all the dangers or abuse that come with it.?.?On pacifism and peace keeping: ?A pacifist is one who believes in his heart that to go to war is beneath the dignity of a human being?, ?Society needs some form of organization, for security and protection in international life?, and ?An international police force?is almost absolutely necessary as one step toward achieving peace. Force, when used by an impartial third party to achieve law and order, it's not contrary to pacifism?.?This document has never previously been offered for sale and was acquired by us from the family that has had it all this timeEinstein was well known as a pacifist until Hitler?s rise to power. In 1930, on his second visit to America, he joined the War Resisters League and accepted the office of Honorary Chairman. Einstein spoke to the organization that year, saying, ?True pacifists must publicly declare in time of peace that they will not take up arms under any circumstances? even if only 2% of those assigned to perform military service should announce their refusal to fight, governments would be powerless, they would not dare send such a large number of people to jail.? The league then issued a pamphlet, ?Einstein on War Resistance,? that was widely read and discussed.Meanwhile, back in Germany, the rising Nazi movement found a convenient target in Einstein and relativity, branding the latter ?Jewish physics? and sponsoring conferences and book burnings to denounce Einstein and his theories. The Nazis even enlisted other physicists to denounce Einstein; ?One Hundred Authors Against Einstein? was published in 1931. When asked to comment on this denunciation of relativity by so many scientists, Einstein replied that to defeat relativity one did not need the word of 100 scientists, just one fact.In December 1932 Einstein decided to leave Germany. The reason: it became obvious to him that his life was in danger. A Nazi organization published a magazine with Einstein?s picture and the caption ?Not Yet Hanged? on the cover. There was even a price on his head. In January 1933, Einstein came to the United States to serve at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California as a visiting professor. The appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor took effect late that month, and Einstein decided he would not return to his home in Germany where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He would instead return to Europe and assess the situation from there. He and his wife Elsa returned by ship to Belgium in March 1933 to find that that their residences in Germany had been raided numerous times. Einstein accepted the fact that he could not return to Germany and turned in his passport to the German consulate; he also formally renounced his German citizenship. By the summer, Einstein learned that his name was on a list of assassination targets. He resided in Belgium for some months and then moved to England for a short period. On October 17, 1933, he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in New Jersey. And there he remained until his death.On February 15, 1933, after Hitler had taken power but before Einstein learned that his homes had been raided, he granted an interview to the War Resisters League at the home of one of its officials, John Dorland. Dorland wanted the interview to be read aloud at the upcoming March 2 meeting of the members in Pasadena. He prepared a five page typescript of the interview and sent it to Einstein to review. As Dorland said in his cover letter to Einstein, ?Would you be kind enough to read it, and if the answers misrepresent you in any detail, may we request that you revise it in such particular, as we are very anxious to have these correct.? He also asked Einstein's permission to read the interview aloud.This is the original typescript of the Einstein interview, sent to Einstein by Dorland, complete with Einstein?s handwritten notations. It is the only such annotated interview of Einstein that we have seen, and it covers important topics.On page one, Einstein makes it clear he was not ready to abandon his resistance to war. ?The War Resisters,? he stated at the interview, ?are doing a fine work. They have done more than any other peace group. A strong organized minority who have declared themselves absolutely against war is very powerful.? Question from Dorland. ?Can we hope to convince everybody?? Answer: ?Oh no, we cannot convince everybody, but we do not need to. One strong man is worth much and has great influence, Individuals thoroughly convinced and small groups working earnestly are of the utmost value.? Q: ?In trying to arouse interest is it better to appeal to the intellect or the emotions?? A: ?To both; the intellect without the emotions is insignificant.?On page two, Einstein states that ?Public protests are very valuable?, as is control over munitions production. ?The private munitions business is a great threat to the peace of the world and there should be government control. Public opinion is not yet awake to the atrocities of the munitions firms.? Then Dorland changes the subject to ?race relations.? Einstein responded, ?The main thing is that minority groups should be allowed security in the community.? Then Einstein hand writes in some thoughts. If they are not afforded such security, ?they should isolate themselves from the rest of society,\n\nGermany as an island of intellectuals is no longer possible, he writes, blaming the fall of his country and exile of his colleagues on poor education, a vestige of Bismarck?\"I am almost collapsing under all my responsibilities.\" ?A glimpse into the tragic end to the scientific flowering of pre-Nazi Germany, along with Einstein's explanation for why it all happened?A rare letter from a brief but consequential period in Einstein's life: after he left Germany but before he arrived in AmericaEinstein had long been a revered scientist and member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and was employed by Berlin University. At the beginning of March 1932 he returned to Germany from a visit to the United States where he had discussed heading the soon-to-open Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He determined to accept, and to spend half the year in Berlin and half the year in Princeton. But that year the Nazis were on the rise. It was becoming increasingly obvious to Einstein that his life was in danger. A Nazi organization published a magazine with Einstein?s picture and the caption ?Not Yet Hanged? on the cover. There was even a price on his head.In December 1932 Einstein again left Germany to be a visiting professor at CalTech in Pasadena, California. When Hitler was appointed German chancellor on January 30, 1933, the physicist had just arrived in New York on his way to California, to lecture on his theory of relativity. Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany was now open, swift and often violent. Prominent Jews were denounced by Nazi officials, attacked in the media, and subjected to violence and arrest. As a vocal opponent of Nazism and a staunch advocate of pacifism, Einstein was a particularly attractive target. Fortunately, at the time Hitler came to power, Einstein was already in the United States. Nonetheless, the Nazis publicly agitated against Einstein as a symbol of ?Jewish degeneracy? and accused him of spreading ?atrocity propaganda.? In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family?s apartment in Berlin.Despite his own March 15, 1933, declaration of self-imposed exile from Nazi Germany, as well as warnings from friends that it was too dangerous to return, Einstein and his wife decided to travel back to Germany, intending to visit their summer cottage. At the end of March, they arrived in Antwerp on the SS Belgenland, owned by the shipping company Red Star Line. There they learned that Nazis had ransacked their cottage in Caputh, at which point they decided that re-entering Germany was unwise.In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed. Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks, where he was introduced to Winston Churchill. Einstein asked Churchill to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up his position at the Institute for Advanced Study. He had already revoked his German citizenship in Brussels, and handed in his notice at Berlin University. He would never return to Germany.Michele Angelo Besso was a Swiss/Italian engineer. A Sephardic Jew by birth, he was a close friend of Einstein during his years at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich and then at the patent office in Bern, where Einstein helped him to get a job. Einstein called Besso \"the best sounding board in Europe\" for scientific ideas. In Einstein's original paper on special relativity, he ended the paper stating, \"In conclusion, let me note that my friend and colleague M. Besso steadfastly stood by me in my work on the problem here discussed, and that I am indebted to him for many a valuable suggestion.\"After his resignation in 1890, Otto von Bismarck was venerated as unified Germany?s founding father, not only during the remaining twenty-eight years of the monarchy but also, albeit less emphatically, in the Weimar Republic, in Nazi Germany and in the Federal Republic. Throughout Germany, numerous Bismarck statues are testament to the admiration. Hamburg has three. His memorialisation even went beyond Germany; the capital of the US state of North Dakota, for example, is named after him. Einstein was evidently not a proponent of the erstwhile unifier of Germany. As Einstein wrote of Bismarck?s influence, \"The characteristic feature of this mentality is that people place the importance of what Bertrand Russell so tellingly terms ?naked power? far above all other factors which affect the relations between peoples. The Germans, misled by Bismarck?s successes in particular, underwent just such a transformation of their mentality?in consequence of which they were entirely ruined in less than a hundred years.\"In this letter, he encourages Besso to let him have his suggestions for saving Hermann Weyl from the regime ? through substituting him for Einstein on a proposed trip to Spain would seem disastrously tactless. He sends his regards to Anna Besso, with the rueful remark that the German example bodes ill for an intellectual utopia which she had proposed.? Weyl would go on work with him at Princeton.These two men were among Einstein's closest friends and colleague - Jewish or closely tied to Jewish relatives.? He is rushing to get them out.Typed letter signed, in German, Le Coq-.\n\nA symbol of the growing alliance against the NazisThe Munich Conference of 1938 led to the surrender of part of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland in the name of appeasement. Many in Britain were jubilant at the thought of having avoided war, but Winston Churchill felt the Czechs had been betrayed and told Parliament that the British people ?should know that there has been gross neglect and deficiency in our defenses; they should know that we have sustained a defeat without a war, the consequences of which will travel far with us along our road; they should know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history, when the whole equilibrium of Europe has been deranged??The annexation of the Sudetenland, completed according to the Munich timetable, was not the end of Czechoslovakia?s suffering. On March 15, 1939, all Czech areas were occupied by the Nazis and proclaimed a protectorate of the Third Reich. In exile in Chicago, the former Czechoslovak president Edvard Bene_ appealed to the Great Powers and the League of Nations to denounce German aggression and the breach of the Munich agreement. France, Britain, and the United States raised formal protests against Hitler?s takeover of the Czech Lands (often referred to as the ?rape of Prague?). When World War II broke out in September 1939, Czech exiles, including the main leaders, formed the Czech National Liberation Committee and immediately began to seek international recognition as the exiled government of Czechoslovakia. By the end of 1939, though, France and Britain had only extended it the right to conclude international treaties, but not in the name of the Czechoslovak Republic.Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940 and he was a friend of Czechoslovakia. The fall of France and the perilous military situation prompted the British Government to rally all possible anti-Nazi strength, and on July 21, 1940, the Benes Committee was recognized by Churchill as a provisional Czechoslovak Government. By this formal step, taken by Lord Halifax as Foreign Minister, the Allied powers were now able to negotiate with the Provisional Czechoslovak Government, and six months later a financial agreement was signed between the British and the Czechs providing for credits to the Bene_ government. While Bene_ was still the head of a provisional government in exile, he created the concept of Czechoslovak legal and political continuity. On this basis he claimed that everything that had followed the Munich Conference had been illegal.Nevertheless, the Committee still felt somewhat insecure about Britain?s recognition, because it specifically mentioned Bene_ as president, but did not explicitly link Bene_ to the previously-existing government. They pressed the British in April 1941 for even greater clarity. On the 18th of that month, they sent a letter to the British requesting that their agreements \"be concluded, as before September, 1938, in the name of the Czechoslovak Republic\". In other words, they wanted unqualified recognition and a declaration of legal continuity.Not all the appeasers of 1938 were gone from the Conservative Party, and Jan Smuts, South Africa?s leader, was also hostile to the idea of granting full recognition to Benes. A British change of heart came when Churchill paid a visit to a Czech military unit on April 19, 1941, and Benes gave him a summary of the Czech arguments for full recognition. Churchill was already pleased with the spirit shown by the Czech soldiers and was moved to tears when they sang ?Rule Britannia? at the end of his visit. He was struck above all by their desire to serve Britain after being betrayed at Munich. A few days later Churchill gave Benes? statement to Eden, who was already pro-Czech, with the remark: ?I do not understand why the Czechs could not have the same status as the other allies. They deserve it.? The final official recognition was issued by Britain and the USSR on July 18 and by the USA on July 31, 1941.This album leaf, April 19, 1941, contains the names of many involved in gaining full recognition for the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile. There is Churchill himself, who has dated the leaf April 1941, plus his wife Clementine Churchill.On the Czech side, there are the main players: Edvard Benes, Czechoslovak President-in-Exile; Czech Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk; and Jan Sramek, Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile. Also signing are W. Averell Harriman, then serving as President Franklin D. Roosevelt?s special envoy to Europe, and Harley ?Hap? Arnold, the new chief of the U.S. Army Air Corps, clearly there as an observer.? Affixed to a light board.\n\nNo Binding. Condition: Fine. SHAW, GEORGE BERNARD. (1856-1950). Irish-born writer. Simply Superb Typed Letter Signed, \"G. Bernard Shaw\", on his imprinted stationery. One and a quarter pages, quarto. [London] October 6, 1937. To Henry Elphick, Shaw writes: ''Mussolini and Hitler, having done extraordinary service to their countries, have been elected rulers by overwhelming majorities of their fellow countrymen. I have to accept their choice with common civility, as they had to accept our choice of Mr. Baldwin. I have, in every public reference of mine to the persecution of the Jews, denounced and ridiculed it in the most unequivocal terms. I have never suggested that the imperialist war of conquest by Japan on China is comparable in any way to the Italian conquest of Abyssinia or the present operations of the British army in Waziristan. The civilization of the Danakil desert and all the north west frontier of British India is an inevitable part of the replacement of tribal savagery by civilization; and it is useless to complain of it. The bombardment of Shanghai is quite another matter; and I have been careful not to confuse the two. General Franco has begun the class war instead of talking about it. The British Government rushed to support him by closing the munitions market against his proletarian opponents. Italy sent troops and submarines to assist him. Russia alone took the proletarian side and held back a general European capitalist and clerical attack in the open field. What this threatens is not a war of nationalities in the 1914 -18 sense, but an outbreak of civil war - class war - throughout Europe, the fundamental issue being between Capitalism and Communism. Meanwhile General Franco s attempt to restore the old order in Spain is perfectly correct according to existing usages; and there is no excuse for being uncivil to him. The denial of belligerent rights to him can now operate only in making the civil war one in which no quarter is given. For the rest my position, which can be ascertained from my writings, has not changed. I am, as I have always been throughout my political life, a Communist, though I differ from most of the members of the bodies calling themselves the Communist Party, in knowing what Communism mean, both absolutely and in its relation to Capitalism which I understand also. Faithfully, G. Bernard Shaw.'' Just one of the finest, and most remarkable letters [ from any authors' pen] we have had the privilege of offering! One of our ''Best of the Best''.\n\nLetter. This compellingly interesting item features two pieces of correspondence from early in the Second World War. The first is a typed, signed letter from then-First Lord of the Admiralty Winston S. Churchill just 10 days before he became wartime Prime Minister to German-Jewish journalist and émigré Alfred J. Fischer declining an appointment to meet. The letter is accompanied by the original Admiralty envelope. The second typed letter is signed by Churchill's Private Secretary, John Peck, dated 8 June 1940, on 10 Downing Street stationery, addressing an apparent request to make inquiries into \"the case of Mr. Fischer\". Together, these two pieces of early Second World War correspondence are noteworthy for occurring during Churchill's ascendance to the premiership, for featuring his signature on his Admiralty stationery in his final days as First Lord, and limning the fraught, perilous fate of German Jews, even those who made it to supposed haven on Allied shores.Churchill's letter is typed on a single sheet of Admiralty stationery, headed with a printed, blue Admiralty device and dated \"30 April 1940\" at the upper right. The salutation \"My Dear Sir,\" the valediction \"Yours vy ty\" [sic], and the signature \"Winston S. Churchill\" are all in Churchill's hand. The letter politely rejects a request from journalist Alfred Fischer for a meeting, Churchill offering \"I am sure that your Editor will understand how fully occupied I am at the present time\" The letter is accompanied by its original franked envelope, the flap featuring the raised, printed \"ADMIRALTY WHITEHALL\" device and still sealed with red wax imprinted with an Admiralty signet.An additional \"8th June, 1940\" letter to Fischer is from John Howard Peck, the only one of Churchill's wartime Private Secretaries to serve for the entirety of Churchill's wartime premiership. This typed, hand-emended, and signed letter is on \"10, Downing Street, Whitehall\" stationery, printed thus at the upper right, with a \"PRIME MINISTER\" device at the upper left. The letter, written less than a month after Churchill became wartime Prime Minister, is addressed to a woman who made an appeal on Fischer's behalf after Fischer was detained as a \"Category 'B' alien. Peck writes: \"Mr. Churchill has had enquiries made into the case of Mr. Fischer but he regrets that nothing can be done in the matter at the moment\"Each letter, as well as the envelope, is housed in its own clear, removable, archival mylar sleeve. The sleeves are housed in a rigid, crimson cloth folder.Alfred Joachim FischerWe know little about \"Mrs. Hochner\" other than her apparent concern and advocacy for Alfred Fisher. But Mr. Fisher's story is known, at least in part, and is intriguingly interwoven with the general tragedy of allied internment of \"enemy aliens\" and the compound brutalities visited on German Jews fleeing Hitler's Reich.Alfred Joachim Fischer (1909-1992) was a German Jew working as a journalist for a liberal newspaper in Berlin at the end of the republic. In 1933, the year Hitler became German chancellor and the first concentration camps were established, Fischer began an emigration odyssey via Czechoslovakia, Scandinavia, the Balkans, Palestine, and Turkey. In 1939 he \"fled at the last minute from Prague\" to Great Britain. But his flight from one persecutor only delivered him to another. Fischer was detained as a potential Category 'B' enemy alien. Eventually he was among those deported to Australia on the HMT Dunera. The 57-day voyage was not only under threat by German U-boats; detainees faced regular beatings and robbery at the hands of British soldiers and officers on board.As Fischer later recalled, \"I was only allowed to take a few items with me, including a personal letter from Winston Churchill.\" Ostensibly that was this same letter. (Translated from Fischer, In der Nahe der Ereignisse, p.177)PLEASE NOTE THAT A CONSIDERABLY MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS ITEM IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.\n\nSoftcover. Condition: poor to near fine. First edition. Small square folio. 12 12x11 3/4\". 51 plates (numbered in slightly confusing and nonconsecutive fashion). String-tied salmon colored wrappers, with black lettering on the front cover. Signed and inscribed by the author on the verso of the front cover. The strange, engrossing and extremely scarce Mexican Anti-Nazi/Anti-Facist publication from 1940 consists of a collection of 51 illustrated plates displaying \"historical and prophetic images\" of then recent world history leading up to events of WWII, the early stage of the war, and projections of the future of the war, as determined by the actions of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. The final plates display prophetic predictions further into the future, determining that a more utopian global society of peaceful cooperation between the peoples of the world living in harmony with nature, is necessary, guided by the author's \"Gaullic\" philosophy. Each plate is protected by a tissue guard and pasted onto heavy stock cardboard backing. All the images are b/w reproductions after original illustrations, and the plates display a combination of text and images. The publication, editing and conception of the piece is attributed to the \"Druidic Knights\" and the \"Institute of Metaphysical and Druidic Science\". The plates feature striking and powerful images of war, destruction, human suffering and political conflict. Famous and important geopolitical and culture figures depicted include Hitler, Himmler, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, King George VI of Britain, Joseph Stalin, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Pope Pius XII, and Joseph Goebbels, among others. While the style of the illustrations are very expressive, they usually tend towards the realistic, and are not overly caricatured or cartoonish. All text in Spanish. Front and back covers detached but present, with chipping and tears. Binding shaky with some a few plates detached, but present. Wrappers in poor, plates in overall very good- to near fine condition. * The publication is extremely scarce, and there is only one listing on OCLC. No other known records. * The author Enrique Crozat is not mentioned anywhere in the publication, but his \"Gaulic\" philosophy is referenced and promoted (in the third person) in the text of the final plates of the publication, and he refers to himself as the author of the work in the inscription. Additionally, in a different publication, published in Mexico City, he is credited as \"the director of the Institute of Druidic Metaphysics\". * All plates signed with artist's initial \"M.T.\".\n\nIn this letter Churchill reveals and changes some titles, and asks News of the World Director Percy Davies to Meet Him to Receive the Balance of the articles?These articles have taken me a good deal longer than those of last year as they consist so largely of entirely new matter. I think they make a very varied and readable series and I hope you will be thoroughly pleased with them.?Winston Churchill?s main source of income was not his salary as a Member of Parliament, but as an author. He was a journalist as early as the mid-1890s, and then reported from captivity during the Boer War. As a serving MP he began publishing pamphlets containing his speeches or answers to key parliamentary questions. Beginning with Mr Winston Churchill on the Education Bill (1902), over 135 such tracts were published over his career. He wrote 43 book length works in 72 volumes, including his 6-volume history of the Second World War. His first book was printed in 1898, and the last in 1958, a remarkable span of 60 years. Four of the works were fiction, showing the breadth of his writing genius. There were 28 books published containing collections of his speeches. He also wrote some 10,000 articles for newspapers and magazines over a period of decades on a broad variety of subjects.In many cases, these newspaper articles were for-hire, commissioned by such publications as Colliers, News of the World, the Daily Mail, and the Sunday Dispatch. The News of the World was so fond of his work that from 1936 and 1939, they paid him ?400 for article, which would be ?12,000 (or over $15,000 ) in today?s money. Quite a sum to pay a columnist during the Depression, and enough to keep Churchill in his Pol Roger champagne and Romeo y Julieta brand cigars. Major Percy Davies was director of the News of the World, and Sir Emsley Carr was the editor in the 1930s. When Carr died in 1941 Davies ascended to the editorial position. It was with these men that Churchill dealt.In early 1936, and ending in April of that year, Churchill contracted to write a series on ?Great Men I Have Known?, and he the News of the World executives discussed subjects. Articles were written by Churchill on Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Admiral Fisher of World War I note, King George V, General Sir John French, General Douglas Haig who was the senior British commander during World War I, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Lord Curzon, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and Georges Clemenceau, among others. In April Churchill wrote Davies with another idea, a way to continue and expand the concept. His new idea: ?Great Men of All Time,? and included a list of proposed subjects. He encouraged Davies to ?pick a dozen of these names?and add any that occur to you. I would then make a further suggestion.? Articles would then be written on these historical figures. Some of the names included such luminaries as Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Buddha, Confucius, Julius Caesar, St. Patrick, Moses, and Leonardo da Vinci.But those were not the only articles Churchill wrote for News of the World at that time. He also wrote about ?Great Events of Our Time?, concluding this in the late fall of 1936. Here he traced the evolution of the British democracy from the feudal ages, the destruction of continental monarchies during the Great War, and the rise of the Bolsheviks, Fascists and Nazis. One article was ?This Age of Government by Great Dictators,? in which he wrote of his soon-to-be adversary, Adolf Hitler, speaking of Hitler?s ?guilt of blood? and ?wicked? methods. This was a very early written critique of Hitler by Churchill (and placed here by no accident), as the Foreign Office had asked Churchill all along to soft-pedal his statements about the Nazi dictator, and for a time Churchill pulled his punches. But not here, where he decides to no longer honor the Foreign Office injunction. And looking to the future, he wrote articles on ?A Vision of the Future,? which included an assessment of the impact of the marvels of science, freedom of the seas and skies, and ?Our Supreme Task,? which title ended up as ?Mankind is Confronted by One Supreme Task?, and lists some of the recent achievements of science, technology, and medicine.Typed letter signed, on his Chartwell letterhead, Westerham, October 9, 1936, to Davies, announcing that his Great Events series of articles was nearing completion. ?You will be surprised and I hope glad to hear that I have almost completed the whole series of articles for the News of the World. I have made only one alteration in the series of titles which you gave me, which I hope you will approve. The article entitled \"Preedom of Sea, Land and Air, marvels of transport and wireless\", would run better as I have written it under the heading \"A Vision of the Future\"; whereas the article ?The Vision of the Future \" might be better called \"Our Supreme Task\". These articles have taken me a good deal longer than those of last year as they consist so largely of entirely new matter. I think they make a very varied and readable series and I hope you will be thoroughly pleased with them. If not I will gladly make any alterations which you may desire.I must thank you for the skill and thought with which you selected the topics, showing how well you knew the kind of subjects it would be easy and congenial for me to write upon. In fact I have taken every single one of then, only suggesting one change of title. I shall have the whole series fair copied and completed by the end of this week and it would be very nice if you could come down here and lunch either on Monday or Tuesday next, as I should like to hand them to you personally.?On October 30, 1936, Davies sent Churchill a News of the World check for ?5,000 in payment of series of 12 articles \"Great Events of Our Time\".\n\nLoose leaf. Condition: Near fine condition. Original document. Quarto. Remarkable one page order by Adolf Hitler on official, printed letterhead, blind-stamped with German Eagle and Swastika. The text of the document: \"I release the Professor Dr. Friedrich Brie, based on article 4 of the academy-teacher-law of January 21st, 1935 - RGBL. I page 33 - from his official obligations. Berchtesgaden, December 28, 1937. The Fuehrer and Reich-Chancellor. Signed Adolf Hitler.\" Co-signed by Bernhard Rust (1883-1945), Minister of Science, Education and National Culture, and considered a zealous Nazi, at the bottom right corner of the page. Hitler gave the order while on a retreat for the Christmas holiday at his vacation home in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. Documents signed by Hitler relating directly to actions against Jews are extremely rare. Includes small leaf (3,5 x 3,5\") with printed order for Brie's removal in English: \"On Behalf of the State I release Professor Dr. Friedrich Brie based on # 4 of the laws of the university dated 21 January 1935 - RGB1.JS. 33 - from his professional responsibilities. Berchtesgaden, December 28, 1937 The Fuhrer and Chancelor of the State Adolf Hitler.\" Dr. Friedrich Brie (1818-1948) was full professor of English Language and Literature Studies and headmaster at the University of Freiburg. Considered to be a half-Jew, according to the the Nazi laws, Brie was slated to be removed from his post. However, due to the intervention of colleagues, including Dean Metz, and Matthew Taylor Mellon of the Pittsburgh Carnegie-Mellon Dynasty, who he had become friends with, it was possible to keep him employed until Hitler removed him in 1937. Brie had met Matthew Taylor Mellon during a stay in the US in 1927/28 and solicited him as editor for the English Seminary at the Freiburg University where Mellon received his Ph.D. with a work on slavery in 1934. Brie was arrested on November 9, 1938, during the Kristallnacht, and interned at Dachau for a few days. During the war Brie held secret meeting and was supported by the members of the Freiburg professorial resistance circle. He published until 1940 and some of his articles were worded so ambiguously that resistant meaning can be attributed to them. Brie was reinstated by the French Administration to become the first professor of the university after the war to serve as Dean of the Faculty of Arts. Very light wear along folds of document, horizontal and vertical. Small leaf with sunning along edges. Very good condition.\n\nCondition: Very Good.

The 6 ¼ x 7 ¼\"diary, written in German, is dated 1942 through 1945 with over 67 ½ pp handwritten entries pages Gusty provides a riveting and intimate narrative. Culture and love, fate and practicality with the backdrop of war collide as the writer has to deal with the realities of war, the tangled web of her personal life as well as concern about her career if she should become pregnant.

The diary begins with her personal conflict. Here are some snippets: \"May 14 This book shall capture my experiences after my parting with Clemmens. I'll be alone, I hope.we want to be good friends and help each other in dismal Munich. May 15 Today is a new beginning in my life.
