        "text": "Note: In this post, I briefly consider the philosophical question whether the chance discovery of family photographs of my fatherâs first cousin Fedor LÃ¶wenstein found in a Paris flea market was fated or coincidental. The circumstances under which the event occurred was so improbable that a small part of me wonders if it was not predestined.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPOST 21: MY AUNT SUSANNE MÃLLER, NÃE BRUCK, & HER HUSBAND DR. FRANZ MÃLLER, THE FIESOLE YEARS\n\nPOST 35: FATE OF SOME JEWISH GUESTS WHO STAYED AT THE VILLA PRIMAVERA (FIESOLE, ITALY), 1937-1938\n\nPOST 105: FEDOR LÃWENSTEIN âS NAZI-CONFISCATED ART: RESTITUTION DENIED\n\nPOST 160: UPDATE ON COMPENSATION CLAIM AGAINST THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE INVOLVING NAZI-CONFISCATED FAMILY ART\n\nIn several earlier posts, Iâve mentioned my friend Ms. Madeleine Isenberg (Figure 1) who volunteers at the Jewish Genealogical Society of Los Angeles assisting members doing ancestral research. Madeleine once wrote an article for a periodical entitled âAvotaynuâ detailing one of her research endeavors. She quoted her English uncle who claimed there is no such thing as coincidence, itâs all âbeshert,â a Hebrew word for predestination or fate. My father Dr. Otto Bruck would have agreed with him.\n\nWhile I claim no adherence to this notion, Iâve come across several instances while doing ancestral research that make me think there may be an element of fate at work. Or, could it be as Branch Rickey, the brainy former General Manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, once said that âLuck is the residue of design?â Thatâs to say, by planning and knowing where opportunities lurk, perhaps one is more apt to find oneself in a place where a coincidental find may be made. I donât pretend to know the answer.\n\nBuried in Post 21, published in February 2018, I recounted the story of a similar coincidental or fated event related to my family. Before moving to the subject of this post, Iâll review that earlier incident as it may have been overlooked by readers. Interestingly, it involves two elements of chance.\n\nI estimate my uncle Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller and aunt Susanne MÃ¼ller, nÃ©e Bruck, arrived in Florence, Italy in the early part of 1936, following their emigration from Germany to escape Nazi authoritarianism. Thanks to a friend my uncle knew in the Tuscan hill town of Fiesole, above Florence [Italian: Firenze] by the name of Dr. Gino Frascani, he and my aunt leased one of his villas, the Villa Primavera. (Figure 2) Eventually, in collaboration with an Austrian Jewish woman, Ms. Lucia von Jacobi (Figure 3), whoâd also emigrated from Austria via Germany, my aunt Susanne and Lucia turned the Villa Primavera into a bed-and-breakfast. In Post 35, I discussed some of the guests who stayed there between 1937 and 1938 and their eventual fates.\n\nIn connection with my ancestral research, my wife Ann and I visited Fiesole and Florence in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Prior to our initial visit in 2014, I contacted the then-town archivist, Ms. Lucia Nadetti (Figure 4), at the âArchivio Storico Comunale,â the âMunicipal Historic Archive,â and arranged to review pertinent documents. Iâve detailed the results of those archival investigations in Post 21, so refer readers to that post.\n\nCurious whether my uncle and aunt had purchased the Villa Primavera when they arrived in Fiesole, Ms. Nadetti directed us to the âConservatoria Dei Registri Immobiliariâ in nearby Firenze (Florence) to check ownership records. Here, we learned the descendants of the former obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Gino Frascani currently own two houses along Via Del Salviatino, the street where the Villa Primavera is located. However, the family no longer owns the villa though my uncle never purchased it.\n\nThe visit to the âConservatoria,â however, resulted in the first of the two chance events mentioned above. In 2014, my wife and I were staying at a bed-and-breakfast on the outskirts of Fiesole, but rather than deal with Florenceâs traffic to get to the Conservatoria, we took the bus. While trying to ascertain where to catch the return bus at the end of the day, an English-speaking Italian woman, Ms. Giuditta Melli (Figure 5), noticed our confusion and confirmed we were in the right place. Giuditta was headed on the same bus, so we exchanged pleasantries on the ride, and she invited us to visit the ceramic shop near the Conservatoria where she teaches. Two days later we dropped by and mentioned our reason for visiting Fiesole. Giuditta was literally moved to tears because sheâd recently learned that her great-uncle was Jewish and had been deported to Buchenwald from Firenze by the Italian Fascists and murdered there; the house where Giuditta currently lives was once owned by this great-uncle. It should be noted that Giuditta is very familiar with the Villa Primavera as itâs located a stoneâs throw from her home. Regardless, as we prepared to leave, we exchanged emails and promised to stay in touch. This has turned into an exceptionally warm and productive friendship, one that led to the discovery of the second chance event.\n\nFollowing our visit to Fiesole in 2015, my wife and I had not anticipated returning in 2016. However, Giuditta made a surprising discovery while doing a casual online search of Lucia von Jacobi, the Austrian lady with whom my aunt ran the Pension Villa Primavera. As a result our plans changed. She learned of a professor, Dr. Irene Below (Figure 6), from Werther, Germany, whoâd written a full-length book about Ms. Jacobi. Giuditta immediately contacted her, explained her interest in Lucia, told her of my aunt and uncle, and mentioned she was in touch and assisting me. Dr. Below was surprised to learn of Giudittaâs interest in people sheâd studied and knew about, including my aunt and uncle. Consequently, Giuditta invited Irene and my wife and me for a get-together at her home in 2016.\n\nDr. Below explained how she came to write a book about Lucia von Jacobi. She arrived in Firenze in 1964 as a student intending to write about the history of art. While researching this topic, however, she happened upon magazines and diaries of an unknown person who turned out to be Ms. von Jacobi, a woman with very famous friends (e.g., Heinrich Mann and Thomas Mann, Gustaf GrÃ¼ndgens, etc.), and decided instead to write about her. Then, as fate would have it, in 1966, Dr. Below walked into an antiquarian shop in Firenze (Figure 7) and discovered the bulk of Ms. Jacobiâs personal papers, which she soon purchased with her parentsâ financial assistance. For those unaware of events in Firenze in 1966, great floods along the Arno in November resulted in countless treasures being swept away and destroyed; if not for Dr. Belowâs fortuitous discovery, the same would likely have happened to Ms. Jacobiâs papers.\n\nReaders may rightly wonder how or why Luciaâs personal papers wound up in an antiquarian shop in Florence. A little bit of historical context is necessary to explain how this likely happened. In May 1938, Hitler paid his second visit to Italy since becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the first since the two countries signed the Axis agreement in 1936. Over the course of seven days, Hitler and his extensive entourage were treated to a massive display of fascist spectacle in three cities: Rome, Naples and Florence. Hitlerâs tour of Florence took place on May 9, 1938.\n\nSoon after on July 14, 1938, Mussolini embraced the âManifesto of the Racial Scientists.â This Manifesto declared the Italian civilization to be of Aryan origin and claimed the existence of a âpureâ Italian race to which Jews did not belong. Between September 2, 1938, and November 17, 1938, Italy enacted a series of racial laws, including one forbidding foreign Jews from settling in Italy. Ms. Jacobi had just returned to Firenze from Palestine, but after passage of the racial laws, she escaped in October 1938 to Switzerland, forced to leave all her possessions behind. As a related aside, this corresponds with the same time that my aunt and uncle emigrated from Italy to France. Dr. Below surmises that Luciaâs personal papers remained in the Villa Primavera until Dr. Frascaniâs descendants sold the house, after which they were sold to an antique dealer.\n\nAs to belongings among Luciaâs personal papers that relate to my aunt and uncle, there were several relevant items. Dr. Below discovered a photograph of Ms. Jacobi with my Uncle Franz seated on the same chairs as a photo I possess showing my aunt and uncle. (Figures 8-9) Another picture shows my aunt and uncle in their Sunday best. (Figure 10) Irene also found a card written by my Aunt Susanne to Lucia on July 31, 1938, from Champoluc in the Aosta Valley of Italy, where my aunt and uncle had gone on vacation. Most interesting is the surviving second page of a letter my Aunt Susanne wrote to Lucia when Lucia traveled to Palestine for three months in the latter half of 1938.\n\nThus, a chance encounter with an Italian lady Giuditta Melli on the streets of Florence in 2014 led to learning about Dr. Below who in 1966 walked into an antiquarian shop in Florence where she happened upon Lucia von Jacobiâs personal papers, the Austrian lady with whom my Aunt Susanne co-managed the Pension Villa Primavera in Fiesole between 1936 and 1938. Dr. Below then wrote a book about Lucia von Jacobi that my dear friend Giuditta stumbled upon. Included in this stash of papers are several items related to my family. Is this coincidence or predestination? Iâll let readers decide.\n\nThis brings me to a discussion of another more recent chance discovery. This involves a cache of photographs portraying my fatherâs first cousin, Fedor LÃ¶wenstein (1901-1946), that were found in a Paris flea market by a man named Nicolas Neumann (Figure 11) from Somogy Ãditions dâArt; this is a French art book publishing house founded in 1937. Readers will recall that Fedor LÃ¶wenstein is my fatherâs first cousin who was most recently discussed in Post 160 and is the subject of my restitution and repatriation claim involving the French Ministry of Culture. Readers are invited to peruse my earlier post. However, let me review a few salient facts.\n\nAs mentioned in Post 160, I originally filed my claim for restitution and repatriation of Fedor LÃ¶wensteinâs artworks in October 2014. This was filed with the French Ministry of Cultureâs (Premier Ministre) Commission pour la restitution des biens et lâindemnisation des victims de spoliations antisemites (CIVS), Commission for the restitution of property and compensation for victims of anti-Semitic spoliation. In May 2015 I traveled to Paris to discuss my claim with the CIVS and met staff members Mme. Muriel de Bastier and her intern Mlle. Eleonore Claret. (Figure 12)\n\nSeveral months later, Eleonore sent me photos of Fedor LÃ¶wenstein (Figure 13) from an exhibit on spoliated art that took place at the Centre national dâart et de culture Georges-Pompidou (âNational Georges Pompidou Centre of Art and Cultureâ) in 2015. The origin of these photos was not explained so I sent an email to the Centre Pompidou requesting copies of the images and an explanation as to their source; I never heard back from them. I eventually ascertained the photos of Fedor LÃ¶wenstein that had been part of the 2015 museum exhibit at the Centre Pompidou originated from Nicolas Neumannâs find at the Paris flea market.\n\nMr. Neumann determined the documents heâd found probably belonged to Fedorâs onetime girlfriend, Doris Halphen. (Figure 14) Mr. Neumann loaned the documents and photos he had purchased for the 2015 exhibit to the Centre Pompidou. Nicolas is friends with the retired Director of the Kandinsky Library, M. Didier Schulmann, who convinced him to donate the materials in February 2017 to the Kandinsky Library which is part of the Centre Pompidou.\n\nThe eclectic body of documentation is referred to as the âCorposano Archive Fund-Doris Halphen.â The archival collection comprises three significant groups. The first, the most substantial, is composed of documentation from the Corposano dance studio; the second is about Fedor LÃ¶wenstein; and the last is made up of biographical photographs and family albums.\n\nThe Kandinsky Library provides the following description about Doris Halphen, the Studio Corposano, and Fedor LÃ¶wenstein:\n\nâDoris Halphen was born in Prague and co-founded the Corposano studio with her Finnish collaborator Marianne Pontan in 1932 in Paris. They taught a very innovative dance method at the time: the Hallerau-Laxenberg method. (Figures 15-18) The documents in the collection, mostly photographs, are both portraits of dancers in the studio and advertising items. Press articles and dance magazines provide an overview of the context of dance in the 1930s and 1940s and an understanding of the Hallerau-Laxenberg method and its principles.\n\nA second part of the collection consists of documentation on Fedor LÃ¶wenstein (1901-1946). Born in Munich on April 13, 1901, he studied at the School of Decorative Arts in Berlin, then at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden, where Oskar Kokoschka taught from 1919 to 1924. He joined France in 1923 and settled in Paris, attracted by the artistic influence of the capital. A lover of Doris Halphen, the painterâs Jewish and Czechoslovak condition forced him to leave Paris at the beginning of the war and take refuge in Mirmande in the DrÃ´me. (Figure 19) The couple separated shortly afterwards, and Fedor LÃ¶wenstein lived a tumultuous passion with the artist Marcelle Rivier until October-November 1943.â\n\nThe collection includes unidentified biographical photographs of Doris Halphen that were probably taken at the beginning of the twentieth century in Prague. Additionally, there are two photographic albums that retrace the memories of two summers in Mirmande in the DrÃ´me, including one from 1938. Fedor LÃ¶wenstein and Doris Halphen are the recurring characters.\n\nMy April 2024 visit to Paris to attend a CIVS committee meeting where my compensation claim was being discussed provided a perfect opportunity to visit the Kandinsky Library where the Doris Halphen collection is archived. Appointments must be scheduled in advance. With the grateful assistance of Mme. Florence Saragoza, who originally helped me file my claim in 2014, I was able to make last-minute arrangements to examine and photograph the collection.\n\nFortunately, Mme. Muriel de Bastier, whom I first met in 2015 and who still works at the CIVS, accompanied my wife and me to the Kandinsky Library; I say fortunately because the line to enter the Centre Pompidou extended for blocks, and I otherwise would never have been able to view the Doris Halphen Collection before the museum closed. Muriel graciously also arranged for us to meet M. Didier Schulmann, the former Director of the Kandinsky Library, who gave me an extremely useful orientation to the collection. (Figure 20)\n\nDuring my all-too brief visit, I concentrated on photographing the album with pictures of Fedor LÃ¶wenstein and Doris Halphen. (Figure 21-23) Among the images unlikely to have been recognized by any other researcher were two of Fedor with his sister Jeanne âHansiâ Goff, nÃ©e LÃ¶wenstein (1902-1986) that were taken in Mirmande. (Figures 24-25) Unlike Fedor who died in 1946 before I was born, I met Hansi in Nice, France on multiple occasions as a child.\n\nAn out-of-place picture I discovered in the collection was of the famous African American, Paul Robeson (1898-1976). He was an American bass-baritone concert artist, actor, professional football player, and activist who became famous both for his cultural accomplishments and for his political stances. Among the few pictures in Doris Halphenâs collection that is captioned it reads âRobeson at Wo-Chula.â (Figures 26a-b) I think this picture was taken in Chowula, Ghana, but the circumstances for its inclusion in Dorisâ album is a complete mystery.\n\nIâve never met nor communicated with Nicolas Neumann so am in the dark regarding the precise circumstances under which he found Doris Halphenâs collection. Regardless, I imagine heâs one of the few people who would have realized the significance of what heâd found and had connections with the Kandinsky Library to ensure the materials wound up in an archive where they would be properly cared for. From a personal standpoint, what is gratifying is that I was able to track down a previously unknown to me cache of Fedor LÃ¶wenstein photographs. The more existential question is that Nicolas Neimann even found Doris Halphenâs surviving papers and photographs. Again, I ask whether this was fated or coincidental?\n\nREFERENCES\n\nIsenberg, Madeleine. (2012). The Rotter Relic.

ERNST NEISSERâS FINAL DAYS IN 1942 IN THE WORDS OF HIS DAUGHTER\n\nPOST 49: GUIDE TO THE âLANDESARCHIV BERLINâ (BERLIN STATE ARCHIVE) CIVIL REGISTRY RECORDS\n\nPOST 50: DR. ADOLF GUTTENTAGâS 1942 DIARY\n\nThis story is inspired by a reader of my Blog, an English lady by the name of Katherine âKathyâ York nÃ©e Powell, granddaughter of Dr. Maria Wundsch nÃ©e Pauly (1891-1978) and Dr. Hans Helmut Wundsch (1887-1972). (Figure 1) Kathy stumbled on my Blog when she found reference to her grandmother. Mariaâs name has appeared in two previous Blog posts, Posts 48 and 50, and she is someone I hold in high regard because of her courage during WWII. There are several threads I will follow as I relate a story about Kathyâs father, born Harro Wundsch (1920-2006) (Figure 2), who changed his name to Harold Powell when he returned to England following his internment in Australia. He apparently selected the name Powell because it was easy to remember and sounded like âPauly,â his motherâs maiden name. Maria Wundsch is the person that links much of the following story together.\n\nLet me begin this account on the 22nd of August 1942 in Berlin.\n\nIn Post 50, I chronicled in his own words Dr. Adolf Guttentagâs (1868-1942) and his wife Helene Guttentag nÃ©e Paulyâs (1873-1942) (Figure 3) final few months in Berlin before they committed suicide together on the 16th of October 1942 after being told by the Nazis to report to an âold age transport,â effectively, a concentration camp. For context, Helene Pauly was my first cousin twice removed. Having seen many of their friends and family deported or commit suicide, there was no doubt what fate awaited them as the Nazis accelerated their pace of deportation of Jews to extermination camps in 1942. As detailed in Post 50, Dr. Guttentag decided to document those final months and reflect on his life. Beginning on the 22nd of August 1942, Dr. Guttentag recorded the following:\n\nâ. . . Rather large transports now occur at a rapid pace. A farewell letter to Otto and Dorothee [NOTE: his son and daughter-in-law], which I have deposited with Maria Wundsch, describes in two notebooks, the general development of my family. In addition, I have decided to start making diary-type entries which show how we are, i.e., how our health is, how we spend our time, what else is going on, what we must expect, and what our plans are.â\n\nIt is clear from this opening paragraph that Dr. Guttentag trusted Dr. Maria Wundsch to do what she could to ensure that his diary got into the hands of his son in America, Otto Guttentag (Figure 4), after he and his wife died. Maria is mentioned several times in Adolfâs diary, as is her husband, Dr. Hans Helmut Wundsch, though he is never identified by name. Because Maria Wundschâs father, Carl Pauly (1854-1918), was from a Jewish family, according to the Nuremberg Laws Maria was considered a mischling of the first degree (i.e., half-Jewish), though there is no evidence she was raised Jewish. Her husband was not Jewish, and this may have afforded her some level of âprotection.â More on this later.\n\nOn the 23rd of August 1942, Dr. Guttentag noted the following about Hans Helmut Wundsch:\n\nâMaria Wundschâs husband had sent us a number of papers concerning his fishery work. They are of zoological as well as economic importance. I have read them carefully because I had no idea what there is in the world outside of medicine. We have sent those papers to Muttiâs brother [NOTE: Helene Guttentagâs brother, Wilhelm Pauly] who, like another friend, is very much interested in the development and utilization of fish in the lakes of the Havel River in the province of Brandenburg. A few days from now Mariaâs husband will inspect a lake there. As for us, we cannot initiate any such contacts because they would endanger others and ourselves.â\n\nDr. Hans Helmut Wundsch was a German fisheries scientist and professor at the Humboldt University in Berlin and director at the Prussian State Institute for Fisheries in Berlin-Friedrichshagen from 1925 until 1937; from 1947 to 1958, he was director at predecessor institutes to todayâs Institut fÃ¼r GewÃ¤sserÃ¶kologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB), Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. (Figure 5)\n\nIt so happens that my uncle Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller (1871-1945) (Figure 6), married to my aunt Susanne MÃ¼ller nÃ©e Bruck (1904-1942) (Figure 7) who was murdered in Auschwitz, was also a professor at Humboldt University at the same time as Dr. Hans Helmut Wundsch. My uncle, who converted to Christianity on the 25th of November 1901, nonetheless was fired from the university in 1933 because of his Jewish ancestry. Though Franz and Hans Helmut worked in different departments, Kathy and I surmise they may have known one another. According to Kathy, her grandfather lost his job at Humboldt University in 1937 for making jokes about Hitler to his students.\n\nOn the 22nd of September 1942, Dr. Guttentag again mentions Maria Wundsch giving us some slight insight into her religious convictions:\n\nâYesterday Maria Wundsch was here for almost the entire day in order to help Mutti [NOTE: Helene Guttentag] She is the only person who has been of help and assistance to Mutti in our many moves: 1. From Stettin to Hirschberg; 2. H(irschberg) move from No. 70 to No. 32; 3. From H. to Berlin-KurfÃ¼rstendamm; 4. from there to here; and 5. now for the evacuation. What a person! Other friends or relatives had failed us. Her convictions are strange, but one must respect her. Details of her religious point of view perhaps at some later time. Incomprehensible to me: even though she cannot adopt the Christian dogma, she nevertheless does not have to conform to certain rules of the Jewish religion, as for instance the total, 24-hour fasting on their highest holiday, Yom Kippur. So, she had come to discuss with Mutti how best to pack the modest number of authorized articles for the transport.â\n\nIt is clear from this entry that while other of Adolf and Helene Guttentagâs friends and family had largely abandoned them during the Nazi era, Maria Wundsch continued to stand by them, probably at great personal risk. Her religious views, though not altogether clear to me, seem to meld Christian and Jewish values.\n\nRespectively, on the 1st through the 3rd of October, then again on the 10th of October, Dr. Guttentag noted his brother-in-law Dr. Adolf Neisserâs (Figure 8) suicide attempt, eventual death, and memorial service:\n\nOctober 1:\n\nâNow fate has caught up with Uncle Ernst [Ernst Neisser]. Yesterday afternoon he was informed that he was to be ready tomorrow morning from 8:00 a.m. on; he would be picked up and evacuated, together with his relative, Miss. Lise Neisser (who has kept house for him). It is never divulged where they are going, probably somewhere in Bohemia. He had always been determined not to go; he wanted to end his life because of his more and more frequent and painful heart troubles that can only be interpreted as angina pectoris.â\n\nOctober 2-3:\n\nâMiss Neisser had already died last night, but Uncle Ernst had not. He was taken to the hospital (we may be taken only to the Jewish Hospital) and was still alive this morning. He had injected himself with 2% morphine and taken 5 tablets of Veronal. . . He died on October 3, 1942.â\n\nOctober 10:\n\nâYesterday was the memorial service for Uncle Ernst. As Mutti reported it was very dignified through the music of a quartet, which at first . . .[sentence not finished]. We stayed together for a while: Susel and Hans [NOTE: Dr. Ernst Neisserâs daughter and son-in-law], Uncle Willi [NOTE: Willy Pauly, Dr. Ernst Neisserâs brother-in-law], Maria Wundsch, Mutti and I. . . .(whom the family reached?).â\n\nAdolf and Helene Guttentag too committed suicide barely two weeks later, on October 16th.\n\nIn Post 48, I discussed the final days of Dr. Ernst Neisser (1863-1942). As noted in Dr. Guttentagâs diary, Luise Neisser died immediately, but Ernst Neisser lingered in a coma for three or four days before succumbing to his trauma.\n\nBecause Luise died immediately her death was recorded in the Charlottenburg borough of Berlin (Figures 9a-b) where she lived with her cousin. Ernst Neisser, however, was taken to the Krankenhaus der JÃ¼dischen Gemeinde, the Hospital of the Jewish Community, the only hospital in Berlin where Jews could be admitted and cured, if possible, during WWII, before once again being thrown into the maws of death. For the Nazis, it was not enough for Jews to die but they had to die on Nazi terms, in extermination camps. Regardless, Ernst Neisser denied the Nazis this satisfaction and he passed away on the 3rd or 4th of October 1942 at the JÃ¼dische Krankenhaus, located in Wedding, a neighborhood in the borough of Berlin-Mitte. His death was therefore recorded here. (Figures 10a-b)\n\nSo much for the lengthy background which partly covers material discussed in earlier posts.\n\nKathy York initially contacted me through my Blog on the 26th of August 2021, and between this email and ensuing ones, several things she said grabbed my attention. The first was that, according to Kathy, throughout the war, her grandmother Dr. Maria Wundsch worked as a chemist at the JÃ¼dische Krankenhaus, the Jewish Community Hospital, where Dr. Ernst Neisser died. As a related aside, Maria studied for her PhD. in Berlin at the âRoyal Friedrich-Wilhelms Universityâ from 1910 to 1914, and was awarded her PhD. in 1915. The title of her thesis âDer Mundwerkzeuge der Caraboidea,â thatâs to say, the working mouthparts of caraboides, a group of ground beetles.\n\nThe concern among family of Jews who attempted suicide and didnât immediately succumb was that they would be revived only later to be deported to a concentration camp. Dr. Guttentagâs diary entry recorded on the 1st of October 1942 voices this concern:\n\nâSince it has been 15 hours since he [NOTE: Dr. Ernst Neisser] took the medicines, it can be assumed the result will be absolutely fatal, and any revival, which everybody fears, is impossible.â\n\nThe unanswerable question I have is whether Dr. Maria Wundsch, by dint of working at the Jewish Hospital where Dr. Neisser was a dying patient, made sure he was never revived following his suicide attempt since, clearly, they knew one another?\n\nKathy York assures me a letter exists among the family papers in which Maria Wundsch describes her time working at the Jewish Hospital in Berlin, and her efforts trying to protect fellow Jews during WWII. If Kathy can locate this item of family memorabilia, I hope to discuss it in a future post.\n\nKathy theorizes that because her grandfatherâs family included Prussian military men this may have saved her grandmother from the fate of some of her relatives. A much more controversial explanation may be that because Maria was married to a non-Jew, this may have contributed to her survival during the Holocaust.\n\nThe story of how the JÃ¼dische Krankenhaus survived relatively unscathed during the entire war is compelling and fascinating. It has been the subject of a book by Daniel B. Silver, the former general counsel to the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, entitled âRefuge in Hell: How Berlinâs Jewish Hospital Outlasted the Nazis.â I refer any readers interested in the topic to this book.\n\nDr. Hans Helmut Wundsch and Maria Wundsch had four children born between 1919 and 1929, Renate (1919-1997), Harro (1920-2006), Josef (1922-1989) (Figures 11-12), and Stefan (1929-1967). Not wanting the children to grow up under the Nazi regime, and likely also fearing their childrenâs status as mischlinge of the second degree (i.e., one-quarter Jewish) would endanger them, they sent the three oldest ones to the United Kingdom, respectively, in 1933, 1935, and 1937; the youngest one, Stefan, was sent to Switzerland but sent back to Germany at the outbreak of hostilities. This was a fateful decision. Harro Wundsch, Kathy Yorkâs father, would see his father at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, then not again until 1958 (Figure 13), since his parents were stuck in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) following the war and were unable to emigrate. And, sadly, Stefan, the youngest of Hans Helmut and Maria Wundschâs children, was never able to join his siblings in the United Kingdom, so grew up apart from them and died relatively young. Maria Wundsch was only able to rejoin her surviving children in England following her husbandâs death in 1972 when she was allowed to emigrate from the GDR; Maria died on the 14th of January 1978 and is buried in Leicester, England. (Figure 14)\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, Kathy mentioned that her father Harro Wundsch had been a âDunera Boy.â This was the second thing that caught my attention during my conversations with Kathy. Having no idea what Dunera Boys were, I did a Google query, which I will briefly summarize for readers as it represented to me an entirely unknown episode of WWII history.\n\nAt the time Britain declared war on Germany on the 3rd of September 1939, more than 70,000 Germans and Austrians living there became âenemy aliens.â According to tribunals established to determine the threat these people posed to Britain three classifications of aliens were decided on: âClass Câ consisted of approximately 66,000 people who were deemed to pose the least danger and were exempt from internment or restrictions; âClass Bâ included about 6,600 people, and these people were carefully monitored by the police; and âClass Aâ was made up of 569 people classified and interned as enemy aliens.\n\nBy May 1940, with Germany advancing through Belgium and France and the increasing possibility that Britain would be invaded, the British Government reassessed the enemy alien population and incarcerated an additional 12,000 Germans, Austrians, and Italians.\n\nThe dramatic increase in the number of detainees led to severe overcrowding causing the British Government to ship 7,500 internees to Australia and Canada between the 24th of June and the 10th of July 1940. Tragically, the transport bound for Canada, the Arandora Star, carrying more than 1,000 internees and 300 crew, was torpedoed and sunk, resulting in the death of 835 people.\n\nThe detainees bound for Australia left England on the 10th of July 1940 aboard the Hired Military Transport (HMT) Dunera; they consisted of 2,542 internees, including Harro Wundsch. While the group included about 450 German and Italian prisoners of war and a few dozen fascist sympathizers, most of the deportees were anti-fascist and two-thirds were Jewish; it also included some survivors from the Arandora Star. Conditions and treatment of the deportees aboard the Dunera were appalling, so much so that that the British Government eventually agreed to pay Â£35,000 to the group.\n\nHarro Wundsch would occasionally joke to his family that he was on the last convict ship to Australia without ever mentioning that it was the Dunera.\n\nAfter a 57-day journey under ghastly conditions, on the 3rd of September, the Dunera docked in Port Melbourne where 344 internees disembarked. The remainder of the detainees were taken to Sydney, arriving there on the 6th of September. (Figure 15) From there they boarded trains bound for the central New South Wales town of Hay, in the Australian Outback. The Hay camp held most of the internees. As many of them consisted of Jewish inmates whoâd been forced to leave successful careers in Germany, Austria, and England, the group included a high percentage of professionals, tradesmen, and artists. Remarkably, the internees established an unofficial university, library, and orchestra, and even minted a currency for use inside the camp.\n\nWithin weeks of the Duneraâs departure, the British Government altered their alien classification system once again. They acknowledged that under the revised system, most of the Dunera deportees would not have been interned. In early 1941, the British Home Office sent Major Julian Layton to Australia to investigate the situation and study possible repatriation; he recommended the internees be reclassified as ârefugee aliens,â so that by the end of 1941 most of them had been released. About 900 of the original âDunera Boysâ remained in Australia, many joining the Australian armyâs 8th Employment Company. Those who stayed in Australia wound up making enormous contributions to the cultural, academic, and economic life of the country. (Figure 16)\n\nHarro Wundsch was among the group of Dunera Boys who decided to return to England. He arrived in the United Kingdom two days before his 21st birthday and was allowed to enlist in the British Army. He had intended to join the Parachute Regiment but broke his ankle so wound up in the Royal Engineers. He was involved in the D-Day landings and spent some time in Japan. According to his wifeâs niece, Harold Powell, as he was by then known, was enroute to Japan when the war in the Pacific ended. It turns out he was aboard the SS Missouri in Tokyo Bay with the British Army on the 2nd of September 1945, when Emperor Hirohito signed the peace treaty. Following the war, Harold Powell went on to obtain a degree in Civil Engineering.\n\nThe final thing Kathy mentioned that attracted my attention was that her grandmotherâs sister and brother-in-law, Elisabeth âLilyâ Kretschmer nÃ©e Pauly and Fritz Kretschmer (Figures 17-18), escaped to the Shanghai Ghetto, living in the Jewish community there. (Figures 19a-b, 20-22) Unlike my fatherâs first cousin, Fritz Goldenring, subject of Post 25, who also escaped to Shanghai but perished there, Kathyâs great-aunt and -uncle survived and wound up in San Francisco after the war.\n\nSo, it can be no accident that Kathy discovered my family Blog, and we find that our familyâs histories overlap across the European, Asian, Australian, and North American continents.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nNational Museum of Australia. âDunera Boys.â 2006, https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/dunera-boys\n\nSherman, Suzan. âHow a Jewish Hospital Survived the Holocaust.â The Forward, October 31, 2003, https://forward.com/articles/6972/how-a-jewish-hospital-survived-the-holocaust/\n\nSilver, Daniel B.

This topic naturally involves touching on the political, economic, and social context under which such conversions took place.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPOST 38: THE EVIDENCE OF MY FATHERâS CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY\n\nPOST 56: REFLECTIONS ON LIFE AND FAMILY BY THE PATERFAMILIAS, DR. JOSEF PAULY\n\nThere is a long history of Jewish conversion to Christianity, both voluntary and forced conversion. Forced conversions of Jews go back to Late Antiquity, the boundaries of which are a continuing matter of debate, but the period between roughly the 3rd and 8th centuries A.D. Royal persecutions of Jews from the 11th century onward typically took the form of expulsions with exceptions. Jews were forced to convert to Christianity before and during the First Crusade (1096-1099) including in parts of what are today France, Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe mass conversion event which took place on the Iberian Peninsula in A.D. 1391 when tens of thousands of Spainâs Jews converted to Christianity because of pogroms is the one readers will be most familiar with. Practicing Jews who refused to convert were expelled by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Alhambra Decree of 1492, following the Christian Reconquest of Spain. The net effect of the Alhambra Decree and persecutions carried out in earlier periods is that over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled. In adjoining Portugal, by contrast, where an edict for Jewish expulsions was also ordered four years later in A.D. 1496, most Jews were not allowed to leave but were forced to convert.\n\nThough conversions continued over time across many other parts of Eastern, Central, and Western Europe, forced conversions were apparently less common in the 20th century and were later more often the result of Jews choosing to convert to integrate into secular society. In Germany, which is the focus of this Blog post as it relates to my family, conversions occurred in three main periods. The first began during the Mendelssohnian era, named after Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), the German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the Haskalah, the âJewish Enlightenmentâ of the 18th and 19th centuries, is attributed. A second wave occurred during the first half of the 19th century. And the third and longest period of conversions was a result of antisemitism and began roughly in 1880.\n\nConversion among German Jews was not an uncommon phenomenon in the 19th century owing to the myriad restrictions and myths that confronted them, and stymied their hopes, ambitions, dreams, and careers. In a sense, conversion to Christianity was the easy way out. Heinrich Heine (1797-1856), the noted German poet, writer, and literary critic, who himself converted, was reputed to have said conversion was his âticket of admission into European culture.â Across most of the German states that united to create âmodernâ Germany in 1871, dominated by the state of Prussia, Jews were often rewarded for renouncing Judaism by being given influential positions and financial incentives. Whereas, during the 17th century, most converts were poor, by the middle of the 18th century, the converts were richer. The departure of the wealthier converts deprived the Jewish community of part of its operating budget. In any event, it is estimated that by the 20th century, close to one million Christians in Germany were of Jewish origin. According to Deborah Hertzâs book, âHow Jews Became Germans: The History of Conversion and Assimilation in Berlin,â the majority of converts were infants whose parents wanted to spare them âconflictsâ as adults. She notes that 60 percent of converts between 1800 and 1874 were under five years of age.\n\nAdolf Hitler came to power in January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums), which excluded Jews and other political opponents of the Nazis from all civil service positions, was one of the first anti-Semitic and racist laws to be passed by the Third Reich, enacted on the 7th of April 1933. The law initially exempted those who had worked in the civil service since August 1, 1914, those who were veterans of World War I, or those with a father or son killed in action in World War I. The Civil Service immediately impacted the education system because university professors, for example, were classified as civil servants.\n\nWith the seizure of power by the Nazis, the new government enacted laws that required all citizens to document their genealogy in full. The regime sought to identify Jews who had converted to Christianity over the preceding centuries. With the help of church officials, a vast system of conversion and intermarriage records was created in Berlin, the countryâs foremost Jewish city. These records, the Judenkartei, the Jewish Register or File, begin in 1645. Work on creating this file had started before the Nazis even came to power under a private initiative which sought to uncover proof of the Jewish ancestry of university and college professors and judges. By 1932, this file had already collected 400,000 genealogical records of Jews in Germany. The constantly expanding file was taken over and expanded in 1933 by the Reichsstelle fÃ¼r Sippenforschung (RfS), renamed Reichssippenamt on the 12th of November 1940, the Reich Office for Clan Research.\n\nReaders who have accessed ancestral records for their German Jewish relatives may have noticed notations in the upper left- or right-hand corners or along the margins of vital documents. Beginning August 17, 1938, Jews had to add âIsraelâ (males) (Figure 1) or âSaraâ (females) (Figure 2) as their middle name. Similarly, on passports, which allowed German Jews to leave Germany, when they still could, but not return, a large âJâ was imprinted. (Figure 3) These and other measures instituted by the Nazis were intended to officially separate Jews from the German populace. While German Jews still converted after the Nazis seized power, as I will illustrate in the case of my uncle Dr. Fedor Bruck, readers can easily surmise this was futile.\n\nAs I contemplated the question of conversion from Judaism among my immediate and extended ancestors, I began to wonder what evidence I could find in the ancestral records proving my relativesâ âalienationâ from their Jewish roots. In my limited experience, finding such documents is not easy. In the case of some of my ancestors but not all of them, conversion was a âpragmaticâ decision, as Iâve alluded to. Again, citing the poet Heinrich Heine, he declared that he was âmerely baptized, not converted.â Quoting from a letter he once wrote:\n\nâFrom my way of thinking you can well imagine that baptism is an indifferent affair. I do not regard it as important even symbolically, and I shall devote myself all the more to the emancipation of the unhappy members of our race. Still I hold it as a disgrace and a stain upon my honor that in order to obtain an office in Prussiaâin beloved PrussiaâI should allow myself to be baptized.â\n\nIn re-reading the memoirs of Dr. Josef Pauly (Figure 4), husband of my great-great-aunt, who had likely been baptized Catholic as a child and whose recollections I discussed in Post 56, I wonder whether he may not have been implying the same sentiment when he wrote:\n\nâI believe in God as the creative force of the universe, to an immanent [NOTE: (of God) permanently pervading or sustaining the universe] consciousness, to a moral world order, to the invisible God of the world as the Jewish religion has revealed it first, whose goodness is identical with the eternal laws.â\n\nAs I began to search through my files and recollect what evidence for conversion I had found for my ancestors, I initially concluded that most of the âproofâ was indirect, such as in the case of my father which I discussed in Post 38. However, upon further consideration, I realize I have found considerably more direct validation than I initially thought. Beyond the obvious instances where the graves or burial records of my forefathers interred in existing and destroyed Jewish cemeteries survive, proving they did not convert, I found corroboration for several ancestors confirming they were baptized.\n\nThe earliest instance is the case of my great-great-aunt Amalie Mockrauer (1834-1918). (Figure 5) On ancestry, I uncovered a record showing she was baptized in Dresden, Germany, 21 years after her birth, on the 13th of April 1855. (Figure 6) This was undoubtedly in anticipation of her marriage to Leopold Julius Wolf von Koschembahr (Figure 7) later that year on the 26th of September 1855 in Saint Clement Danes, Westminster, London, England, an Anglican church. (Figure 8)\n\nInitially, I thought Leopold von Koschembahr was also of Jewish origin because his grandson, Gerhard Bruck von Koschembahr (i.e., Gerhardâs father, Wilhelm Bruck, took his baroness wifeâs surname) (Figure 9), departed Germany for the United States via Switzerland in 1938 with his 12 children. However, I learned from a New York Times article dated the 2nd of October 1938 that Gerhard departed Germany NOT on account of his grandfatherâs Jewish roots but because his great-grandmother, on his motherâs side, was non-Aryan. (Figure 10) This gives credence to the concern descendants of Jews whose ancestors had long ago converted or had never converted felt when the Nazis started tracing their ancestral origins. In the case of Leopold von Koschembahr, I found his baptismal record showing he was baptized on the 5th of December 1829 (Figures 11a-b), proving he was not Jewish at birth. As readers can discern from this example, confirming or refuting the Jewish origins of oneâs ancestors can be like solving a complex puzzle.\n\nMoving on to other family members, let me briefly discuss the evidence for conversion for my uncle by marriage Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller, my uncle by blood Dr. Fedor Bruck, my father Dr. Otto Bruck, and Dr. Adalbert Bruck, the great-grandfather of a fourth cousin.\n\nThe Centrum Judaicum Foundation is housed in the New Synagogue Berlin which was consecrated on the Jewish New Year in 1866, at which time it became the largest Jewish house of worship with its 3,200 seats. While the synagogue was spared major damage on âKristallnacht,â it was severely damaged by Allied bombing during WWII. In 1958, the main room of the synagogue was demolished, so that today only the parts of the building closest to the street remain structurally intact.\n\nDocuments addressing the history of Jews in and around Berlin are archived there, including surviving records on conversions that took place in the city. In the case of my uncle by marriage Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller, married to my aunt Susanne MÃ¼ller nÃ©e Bruck murdered in Auschwitz, the Centrum Judaicum has an index card on file indicating he converted on the 25th of November 1901. This did not prevent him being dismissed from his position as Humboldt University professor when the Nazis came to power in 1933 in accordance with their Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.\n\nIn the instance of my fourth cousinâs great-grandfather, Dr. Adalbert Bruck, the Centrum Judaicum could find nothing in their archives about him, so referred my cousin to the Evangelische Zentralarchiv in Berlin, the Protestant Central Archive in Berlin. In principle records of all Jewish conversions to Christianity in Berlin are kept here, though many did not survive WWII. According to a letter sent to my cousin, Dr. Adalabert Bruckâs record survives indicating he converted on the 27th of November 1890; however, his wife Anna Bruck nÃ©e Flatowâs information survives only indirectly in the form of a 1930 document showing she supposedly converted on the 17th of February 1900. (Figures 12a-b)\n\nThe conversion of my uncle Dr. Fedor Bruck, who has been the subject of several Blog posts because of his incredible tale of survival in Berlin during the entirety of WWII thanks to family and âsilent heroes,â adds another element to my uncleâs compelling story. The register documenting his conversion survives and indicates he was baptized in Berlin on the 11th of June 1939 at the Messias Kapelle, a Lutheran Church. (Figures 13a-b, 14) Two godparents are named in the register, a âHerr Engelbert Helwigâ and a âHerr Roderich von Roy.â Ancestry shows Englebert Helwig to have been a Holocaust survivor, and Roderich von Roy to have been born on the 3rd of August 1895, exactly two weeks before my uncle. Did my uncle know these people beforehand, or were they just random parishioners who attended the Messias Kappelle selected to be his godparents? We may never know.\n\nLutheran is a denomination among the Protestant, in fact it is the oldest of the denominations to break away from Catholicism and is traced to the founder of the movement, Martin Luther of Germany. (Figure 15)\n\nHoping to find a picture of the Messias Kapelle, I did a Google query and stumbled upon a fascinating article written by Christiane Jurik, Editor-in-Chief of Ariel Ministries, discussing the origins of the Messias Kapelle and its role in German Jewish baptisms. I quote:\n\nâHistorically, most baptized Jews in Germany joined the Lutheran Church. There, even those who were true believers in Yeshua were mostly met with indifference; sometimes with suspicion; or worst, with anti-Semitism. In order to avoid this treatment, some Jewish believers started looking for places of worship where they could stay among themselves. In 1901, the Berlin Society purchased a property in one of the most urban boroughs of the city, called Prenzlauer Berg. The ministry not only moved its headquarters to the building but soon started construction work of what became known as the Messias Kapelle (âMessiah Chapelâ). Three days before Christmas of 1902, the chapel opened its doors to the Jewish believers of Berlin.\n\nWhile the goal of the Berlin Society had been to offer a haven for Jewish believers, its work was closely affiliated with the Lutheran Church. In fact, the chapel officially belonged to the union of Protestant churches that also included the Confessing Church, whose most famous member was Dietrich Bonhoeffer. However, in 1930, the Lutheran Church revoked its support of the work of the Berlin Society and withdrew its pastors from the chapel. From then on, the Messias Kapelle was run by laymen.\n\nIn 1935, the Lutheran Synod forbade the baptizing of Jewish people. One of the pastors in Berlin expressed the general sentiment: âI am convinced that the family who told me it would be a horrible thought for them that the hand that baptized a Jew would touch their child is not alone.â\n\nYet not everyone obeyed the new directives of the Synod. The Messias Kapelle at this point separated itself completely from any state-run institution and in turn became the most important place of Messianic baptism in Berlin. According to the baptismal records of the time, over 700 German Jews got baptized there in the years between 1933 and 1940.\n\nOn November 11, 1938, during the Kristallnacht, the Messias Kapelle and the seat of the Berlin Society were trashed by the Nazis. Still, it would take until January of 1941 for the ministry and the chapel to be officially closed permanently. Ten months later, the first deportation of Jewish people began in Berlin. Records prove that of the 700 Jewish believers who had been baptized in the Messias Kapelle after 1933, 86 were hauled off to the ghettos of Lodz, Riga, Minsk, and Warsaw. Only two of them survived the Holocaust. It is unknown what happened to the rest of the congregation.â\n\nA few observations. Among the survivors baptized in the Messias Kapelle was my uncle who lived until 1982. Beyond the obvious interest in self-preservation for the 700 or so Jews who got baptized in the Messias Kapelle during the Nazi era, the fact they could be baptized here as late as 1939, worship among other Jewish converts, and be told about the Jewish Messiah may have had appeal. While itâs unclear whether the chapel has been deconsecrated, the author of the above quote tells us that a marketing and public relations firm now owns it and that the worship hall, altar, and a marble relief resembling a Temple survive. Itâs sad this is not a recognized historic monument.\n\nGrowing up my father never spoke about religion and religion was never part of my upbringing. In fact, I was baptized as a Catholic by my grandparents at six years of age in Lyon, France, at the request of my parents almost as an afterthought, hoping it might protect me in the event of another Holocaust. However, as most readers will surmise, as a half-Jew, I would have been considered a mischlinge of the first degree according to the Nuremberg Laws. Not good enough to survive being murdered.\n\nAware my father had attended dental school in Berlin, I checked with the Centrum Judaicum in Berlin to ascertain whether they might have a record of my fatherâs conversion, but they do not. Knowing my fatherâs penchant for procrastinating, I have always suspected my father never placed a high priority on getting baptized and converting until it became an absolute necessity. And, in my opinion, that only became necessary after he moved to the town of Tiegenhof [today: Nowy DwÃ³r GdaÅski, Poland] in the Free State of Danzig where he opened his dental practice in 1932. As I discussed in Post 38, the evidence for my fatherâs conversion comes in the form of a receipt for payment of quarterly church taxes to the Evangelische Kirche in Tiegenhof. (Figure 16)\n\nMy second cousin twice-removed, Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck (1872-1937) (Figure 17), subject of several recent Blog posts is thought to have converted in Breslau [today: WrocÅaw, Poland]. Dr. Barbara Bruziewicz-MikÅaszewska, professor of dentistry at the University of WrocÅaw, who has written about Dr. Bruck, cites a file from the Universityâs archives saying he converted in 1916 (i.e., University file: sygn. S99, s. 62, nr sprawy AU â 481/46/2001). As we speak, I am working with one of Dr. Bruziewicz-MikÅaszewskaâs colleagues to obtain verification of the date of Dr. Bruckâs baptism. Unlike his father and grandfather, who are buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in WrocÅaw, Walterâs place of internment in WrocÅaw is unknown but was undoubtedly in a Christian cemetery that likely no longer exists.\n\nAs I mentioned above, in principle all surviving records of Jewish conversions to Christianity in Berlin are archived at the Evangelische Zentralarchiv. For conversions that took place outside of Berlin, however, there is no central repository of this information that I am aware of. Thus, the only possibility of tracking down comparable information for oneâs Jewish ancestors is to know the town and parish church where the baptism occurred, and then hope the registers have survived.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBruziewicz MikÅaszewska, Barbara.

Soon thereafter, he moved to the Free City of Danzig, Freie Stadt Danzig in German, where he apprenticed with a Dr. Fritz Bertram. I think his relocation to Danzig may have been related to the fact that he was very close to his aunt and uncle, Rudolf LÃ¶wenstein and Hedwig LÃ¶wenstein nÃ©e Bruck, and two of their three children, Jeanne (Figures 1-2) and Heinz LÃ¶wenstein, who all lived there. In Post 71, I described the tragic circumstances of Rudolf LÃ¶wensteinâs death in a plane crash in then-Czechoslovakia on the 22nd of August 1930, when my father resided with him and his family.\n\nBy April 1932, my father had gained enough technical expertise to strike out independently, and open his own dental practice in the nearby town of Tiegenhof [today: Nowy DwÃ³r GdaÅski, Poland]. While this was undoubtedly a signature achievement in my fatherâs life, slightly more than eight months later, on the 30th of January 1933, Hitler was appointed Germanyâs Chancellor by the President Paul von Hindenburg, and then became FÃ¼hrer in 1934. An October 1934 picture of the office building in Tiegenhof where my father lived and had his practice was festooned with Nazi flags (Figure 3), clearly demonstrating the predictable impact of political developments in Germany on the Free City of Danzig and the looming danger. By April 1937, my father was devoid of clients, so he shuttered his practice. Judging from the dates on his photos, he appears to have stayed in Tiegenhof until fall of that year.\n\nI think my father then briefly went to Berlin to âloseâ himself in the relative anonymity of a larger city. His adored sister Susanne and her husband, Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller, had already fled Berlin in favor of Italy by March 1936. However, his older brother, Dr. Fedor Bruck, who would ride out the entire war in Berlin hidden by friends and family, was still practicing dentistry in Berlin in 1937 under the auspices of a non-Jewish dentist when this was still feasible. Perhaps, my father stayed briefly with his brother, but, regardless, by March 1938, his dated pictures place him in Vienna, Austria between the 5th and 9th of March. (Figure 4) His ultimate destination though was Fiesole, Italy, where his sister and brother-in-law were then living. His entered Italy on the 10th of March 1938 but arrived in Fiesole only on the 26th of March (Figure 5), spending the intervening period skiing in the Dolomites.\n\nDuring Italyâs Fascist era, all out-of-town visitors were required to appear with their hosts at the Municipio, City Hall, provide their names, show their identity papers, indicate their anticipated length of stay, and complete what was called a âSoggiorno degli Stranieri in Italia,â or âStay of Foreigners in Italy.â The surviving records for Fiesole are today kept at a branch of the Municipio called the âArchivio Storico Comunale,â the âMunicipal Historic Archive.â (Figure 6) These registration logs and forms, while highly intrusive, are enormously informative for doing genealogical research, uncovering names of visitors, and establishing timelines for these guests. (Figure 7)\n\nWhile 1938 was hardly a serene time, by June or July, my father nonetheless decided to tour parts of Italy and adjoining Switzerland, including Florence, Rome (Figure 8), Pompeii (Figure 9), Naples, Sorrento, the Island of Ischia, and Ascona; his travels lasted until September. By the 15th of September 1938, he was back in Fiesole according to a surviving immigration register on file at Fiesoleâs âArchivio Storico Comunale.â This record indicates an anticipated two-week visit, though itâs not clear how long my dad actually stayed. (Figure 10)\n\nLet me briefly digress and provide some historical context for what was happening in Italy at the time. On the 9th of May 1938, Adolph Hitler had visited Florence escorted by Italian Duce Benito Mussolini, and toured some historic sites. Soon after, on July 14, 1938, Mussolini embraced the âManifesto of the Racial Scientists.â Basically, this Manifesto declared the Italian civilization to be of Aryan origin and claimed the existence of a âpureâ Italian race of which Jews were no part. Between September 2, 1938 and November 17, 1938, Italy enacted a series of racial laws, including one forbidding foreign Jews from settling in Italy.\n\nIt quickly became apparent to my father, his sister, her husband, and my grandmother, Else Bruck nÃ©e Berliner, also living in Fiesole, that remaining in Italy was no longer possible. Again, according to records on file at Fiesoleâs âArchivio Storico Comunale,â my aunt and uncle are deleted from the population records of the city, in Italian âData dalle quale decorre la cancellazione dal Registro di popolazione,â beginning on the 16th of September 1938. (Figures 11-12) Thus, my fatherâs arrival and registration in Fiesole the day before was likely timed to help his relatives pack up and leave, though he may have stayed longer.\n\nThe next stop along my familyâs odyssey was Fayence, France, roughly 42 miles west of Nice, France; Fayence is one of the âperched villagesâ overlooking the plain between the southern Alps and the Esterel massif. My uncle Dr. Franz MÃ¼llerâs daughter by his first marriage, Margit Mombert nÃ©e MÃ¼ller, lived there with her husband, brother-in-law, and mother-in-law on a fruit farm the family owned. I discussed this in Post 22 so refer readers to that publication. I place my aunt, uncle and grandmotherâs arrival in Fayence towards the end of September 1938. While the collaborationist government of Vichy France would not be established in the southern part of metropolitan France until July of 1940, my ancestorsâ recent displacements and the reach of the Nazis would have made them extremely nervous. Clearly, in the case of my father, riding out the impending storm in France or elsewhere in Europe was not a viable option at the age of only 31.\n\nCoincidentally, by 1938, but likely years before, his widowed aunt Hedwig LÃ¶wenstein nÃ©e Bruck and her two children, discussed above, with whom my father had lived in Danzig between 1930 and 1932, had relocated to Nice, France. (Figure 13) Hedwigâs daughter, Jeanne âHansiâ Goff nÃ©e LÃ¶wenstein (1902-1986), was close to my father throughout his life. Realizing the danger he was in, she advised him to enlist in the French Foreign Legion, which is precisely what my father, Dr. Otto Bruck, did.\n\nIn one of my fatherâs surviving post-WWII letters, dated the 7th of January 1946, he requested a Carte dâidentitÃ©, an identify card, from the Department of Alpes-Maritimes in southeast France, where Nice is located. In this letter, my father provides some dates that help establish where he was at various times before and during the war. According to this correspondence, by October 21, 1938, my father had arrived in Paris, France, where he applied for admittance to the French Foreign Legion, to which he was conscripted on the 9th of November 1938 for a five-year hitch. So far, Iâve been unable to determine my fatherâs whereabouts between September 16, 1938, when he was in Fiesole, Italy, and October 21, 1938, when he arrived in Paris.\n\nThe French Foreign Legion is a military service branch of the French Army established in 1831. The Legion is unique in that it is open to foreign recruits willing to serve in the French Armed Forces. My father was given a French nom de guerre, an alias, âMarcel Berger.â (Figures 14a-b) From the French Foreign Legion, I was able to obtain my fatherâs âLivret Matricule,â military file, which states that Marcel Berger was born on the 6th of January 1907 in Strasbourg in the French Department of Bas-Rhin, and that his profession was âChirurgien dentist,â dental surgeon. (Figure 15) While my fatherâs profession is correctly indicated, he was in fact born on the 16th of April 1907 in Ratibor, Germany [today: RacibÃ³rz, Poland]. My fatherâs fluency in French would have afforded him a measure of protection had he been taken prisoner.\n\nReaders may think the title of this post somewhat odd, as though to imply that my fatherâs enlistment in the French Foreign Legion was somehow preordained. While my father was very much inclined to believe in kismet, fate, I am a strong believer that you control your own destiny. That said, realistically, without an exit visa to a âsanctuaryâ country a Jewish personâs options would have been extremely limited in the lead-up to WWII, so my father was fortunate the French Foreign Legion was open to him and that he was unmarried and had no children to look after.\n\nIn the following post, I will provide substantially more background on the history of the French Foreign Legion during WWII to account for the Legionâs âconflictedâ role at the time and explain how my father was able to travel to France in 1941 âacross enemy linesâ to visit his beloved sister Susanne one final time.\n\nUPDATED MAY 18, 2021\n\n(UPDATES IN RED)\n\nâI should like someone to remember that there once lived a person named David Berger.â (David Berger in his last letter, Vilna 1941, quoted from www.yadvashem.org brochure)\n\nNOTE: This post examines the fate of some of the Jewish residents and guests who stayed at the Villa Primavera in Fiesole, Italy, between roughly March 1937 and September 1938, the period during which my aunt Susanne MÃ¼ller nÃ©e Bruck co-managed the property as a bed-and-breakfast with a Jewish emigrant formerly from Austria and Germany, Ms. Lucia von Jacobi. Investigating what became of the guests who stayed at the Villa Primavera during this time wound up upending my preconceived notion that the boarders were all Jewish emigrÃ©s permanently fleeing Germany.\n\nRelated Post: Post 21: Aunt Susanne & Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller, The Fiesole Years\n\nSurviving historic records archived at the âArchivio Storico Comunale,â the âMunicipal Historic Archive,â in Fiesole, place my aunt Susanne and my uncle Dr. Franz MÃ¼llerâs arrival there in about March 1936, and their departure in mid-September 1938. Beginning approximately a year after their arrival, thatâs to say, in March 1937, and continuing until they left for France in mid-September 1938, registration logs from the Villa Primavera record numerous guests. I was surprised at the large number of visitors who stayed there, mostly Jewish, and just assumed my aunt and uncle hosted them as they tried to escape Europe and Nazi persecution. While I eventually came across a reference indicating my aunt and Ms. Jacobi had run the Villa Primavera as a bed-and-breakfast, explaining the multiple boarders, this did not initially alter my view that the Jewish guests had already permanently fled Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland, never to return.\n\nTo remind readers, during Italyâs Fascist era, all out-of-town visitors to Fiesole and elsewhere were required to appear with their hosts at the Municipio, or City Hall, provide their names and those of their parents, declare their occupation, state when and where they were born, show their identity papers, give their passport numbers, divulge their anticipated length of stay, and complete what was called a âSoggiorno degli Stranieri in Italia,â or âStay of Foreigners in Italy.â (Figure 1) As readers will rightly conclude, collecting this information represented a vast invasion of privacy, although forensic genealogists can glean an enormous amount of useful ancestral data. While virtually all the Soggiorno forms state the reason for the guestâs visit as âturismo,â tourism, I concluded this was a âcoverâ for their real purpose, planning their escape to America or elsewhere. There can be little doubt in examining the Soggiorno forms that most guests were educated and accomplished people of means, likely with good personal and professional contacts elsewhere in the world who could sponsor them and help them obtain travel visas. That said, this did not ensure that Jews were able to obtain such outside help or even intended to leave Europe.\n\nWith the Soggiorno forms and Fiesole registration ledgers in hand, using ancestry.com, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem Holocaust victimsâ databases, as well as general Internet queries, I set out to try and determine the fate of as many of the guests of the Villa Primavera as possible. With respect to my own family, I already knew what had happened to them, in particular that my beloved aunt Susanne (Figure 2) and my great-aunt Franziska Bruck (Figure 3) had both died in the Holocaust; similarly, I already knew that one of my first cousins twice-removed, Auguste âGustiâ Schueck (Figure 4), had died in the Theresienstadt Ghetto in Czechoslovakia on May 28, 1943. But, I was very curious whether other individuals who had passed through the Villa Primavera suffered a similar fate or managed to find sanctuary elsewhere. The findings upended my preconceived notion that the guests at the Villa Primavera were on a one-way journey out of Europe at the time they stayed in Fiesole.\n\nBelow is a table, alphabetically-arranged, of the Jewish residents and boarders who stayed at the Villa Primavera between March 1937 and September 1938, with comments as to their destiny, where discovered. Below the table, I highlight a few individuals, discussing some interesting things Iâve learned about them, including pictures, where found.\n\nNAME (NATIONALITY) DATE & PLACE OF BIRTH DATE & PLACE OF DEATH COMMENT Argudinsky nÃ©e Fleischer, Elisabetta (UNKNOWN) 11/24/1873 Reichenbach, Germany Unknown Destiny: Unknown Bachrach nÃ©e Bachmann, Elvire (SWISS) 9/15/1872 Karstein Unknown Destiny: Unknown Baerwald nÃ©e Lewino, Charlotte Victoria (GERMAN) 8/6/1870 Mainz, Germany 3/16/1966 St. Gallen, Switzerland Destiny: Immigrated to America, died in Switzerland (Figure 5) Berend, Eduard (GERMAN) 12/5/1883 Hannover, Germany 1973 Marbach, Germany Destiny: Left Germany in 1939, returned after WWII Bergmann nÃ©e Neufeld, Amalie (GERMAN) 4/16/1881 Posen, Germany Unknown Destiny: Unknown Brieger nÃ©e Elias, Else (GERMAN) 2/19/1888 Posen, Germany Unknown Destiny: Unknown Bruck nÃ©e Berliner, Else (GERMAN)(Figure 6) 3/3/1873 Ratibor, Germany 2/16/1957 New York, NY Destiny: Immigrated to America Bruck, Eva (GERMAN) (Figure 7) 8/19/1906 Barcelona, Spain 8/15/1977 Ainring, Germany Destiny: Immigrated to Spain, died in Germany (Figure 8) Bruck, Franziska (GERMAN) 12/29/1866 Ratibor, Germany 1/2/1942 Berlin, Germany Destiny: Suicide victim of the Holocaust Bruck, Otto (GERMAN) (Figure 42)\n\n4/16/1907 Ratibor, Germany 9/13/1994 New York, NY Destiny: Immigrated to America Cohn nÃ©e Pollack, Caroline (GERMAN) Unknown Unknown Destiny: Unknown Cypres, Jacques (BELGIAN) 10/29/1904 Antwerp, Belgium Unknown Destiny: Immigrated to America (Figure 9) Donath, Ludwig (GERMAN) 3/6/1900 Vienna, Austria 9/29/1967 New York, NY Destiny: Immigrated to America Donath nÃ©e Camsky, Maria Josefa (GERMAN) 8/20/1902 Vienna, Austria 4/21/1975 Vienna, Austria Destiny: Immigrated to America, returned to Austria after her husbandâs death Elias, Dr. Carl Ludwig (GERMAN) 9/19/1891 Berlin, Germany 1942 Auschwitz, Poland Destiny: Murdered in Auschwitz Fleischner nÃ©e Schoenfeld, Gabriele Ann Sophie (AUSTRIAN)(Figures 10a &b) 10/12/1895 Vienna, Austria 9/22/58 Massachusetts Destiny: Immigrated to America, died Gabriele Anna Fleischner-Lawrence Fleischner, Dr. Konrad George (AUSTRIAN)(Figures 11a& b) 10/12/1891 Vienna, Austria 9/1963 Massachusetts Destiny: Immigrated to America, died Conrad Lawrence Goldenring, Eva (GERMAN) 10/29/1906 Berlin, Germany 12/1969 Wilmington, DE Destiny: Left Germany for France & Spain; eventually immigrated to America Goldenring, Fritz (GERMAN) 9/11/1902 12/15/1943 Shanghai, China Destiny: Left for Shanghai where he died in the Shanghai Ghetto Goldenring nÃ©e Hirsch, Helene (GERMAN) 3/25/1880 Ratibor, Germany 1/12/1968 Newark, NJ Destiny: Left for Chile & eventually immigrated to America GrÃ¶del, Emilie (GERMAN) Unknown Unknown Destiny: Unknown Hayoth HAYDT, Dr. Eugen (GERMAN) 4/19/1906\n\nMetz, France\n\nUnknown\n\n1/17/1973\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nDestiny: Unknown\n\nArrived in Sydney, Australia on 2/6/1939 aboard the ship âNIEUW HOLLANDâ;\n\nDied as Alvin Eugene Werner Haydt or A.E.W Haydt\n\nHayoth HAYDT nÃ©e Winternitz, Lilly (GERMAN) 8/12/1908\n\nVienna, Austria\n\nUnknown\n\n2/4/1997\n\nSydney\n\nDestiny: Unknown\n\nArrived in Sydney, Australia on 2/6/1939 aboard the ship âNIEUW HOLLANDâ\n\nHeilbronner, Dr. Paul Milton (GERMAN) (Figures 12 & b) 11/22/1904 Munich, Germany 4/6/1980 Santa Barbara, CA Destiny: Immigrated to America, died as Paul Milton Laporte Heilbronner nÃ©e Wimpfheimer, Sofie (GERMAN) (Figures 13a & b) 3/18/1876 Augsburg, Germany 3/26/1965 Los Angeles, CA Destiny: Immigrated to America, died as Sofie Broner Herz, Dr. Phil.

In the case of most guests, however, their anticipated length of stay typically varied between a few weeks and two months.\n\nEduard Berend\n\nEduard Berend (Figure 19) was an eminent editor of the works of Jean Paul (1763-1825), a German Romantic writer. After fighting in WWI, Berend pursued an academic career, but on account of anti-Semitism, he was rejected as a teacher at three German universities. In 1927, the PreuÃische Akademie der Wissenschaften, the Prussian Academy of Sciences, eventually commissioned him with the historic-critical edition of the works of Jean Paul. By 1938, he had completed 20 of the 32 planned volumes, works that established Jean Paul as one of the most important writers of German classicism, alongside Goethe and Schiller. Still, he was dismissed by the Prussian Academy in 1938. Soon thereafter he was sent to the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen, and was only released on the condition that he leave Germany immediately.\n\nPrior to WWII, Eduard Berend had developed an unlikely friendship with a Heinrich Meyer, a Goethe scholar at the Rice Institute in Houston with Nazi sympathies. Desperate, Berend turned to Meyer for help in December 1938. In spite of Henrich Meyerâs Nazi leanings, which landed him in prison in Texas in 1943 and ultimately got him fired, Meyer secured an affidavit for Berend to leave Germany for Switzerland where he even supported Berend financially. After the war, Berend continued his work on Jean Paul. He went back to Germany in 1957, and by the time of his death in 1973, had completed twenty-eight volumes.\n\nThe passport on which Eduard Berend traveled to Switzerland in 1939 was different than the one on which he traveled to Fiesole in May 1937, comparing the number on the Soggiorno form (Figure 20) with that on his 1939 passport, found on the Internet. (Figure 21)\n\nFranziska Bruck\n\nI was able to procure a copy of my great-aunt Franziska Bruckâs death certificate from the Landesarchiv Berlin. (Figure 22) The certificate states the gruesome way in which she killed herself on January 2, 1942, âselbstmord durch erhÃ¤ngen,â suicide by hanging, no doubt after being told to report to an old-age transport for deportation. (Figure 23)\n\nIn previous posts, Iâve explained to readers that beginning in 1937-38, all German Jewish men had to be called âIsrael,â and all German Jewish women had to be called âSarahâ; these names were added to official birth, marriage and death certificates. Readers will note that on my great-auntâs death certificate, the name âSaraâ has been added.\n\nMy great-aunt Franziska spent two months at the Villa Primavera between September and November 1937. Iâve often wondered what her fate might have been had she not returned to Berlin. I can only surmise that like many Jews, she was either in denial as to what might happen upon her return, or her options for leaving Germany were limited.\n\nLudwig & Maria Donath\n\nLudwig Donath (Figures 24a & b) and his wife, Maria Donath nÃ©e Camsky (Figures 25a & b), were among the last German Jewish guests at the Villa Primavera, staying for no more than a month in July-August 1938. Ludwig Donath was a famous character actor (Figures 26 & 27) whoâd had a distinguished career on the stages of Vienna and Berlin, before leaving Nazi Germany in 1933. He and his wife arrived in Hollywood via Switzerland and England, departing from Liverpool for New York in February 1940. Donath appeared in many American films, with at least 84 credits to his name, and was often typecast as a Nazi in films from 1942. (Figure 28) He was briefly blacklisted in the 1950âs for alleged left-wing connections, but resumed steady television work in 1957 for the remainder of his life.\n\nCarl Ludwig Elias\n\nCarl Ludwig Elias was born in 1891 to a distinguished art critic, Dr. Julius Elias, who was instrumental in promoting French Impressionism in Germany. Likely because of his fatherâs connections with the art world, an oil portrait of âCarl Ludwig Elias 7 Â¼â by Lovis Corinth was painted in 1899. (Figure 29) Carl Ludwig was a lawyer in Berlin and immigrated to Norway when the Nazis came to power. Nonetheless, after the Nazis invaded Norway in December 1940, he was captured and deported with 500 other Jews from Denmark to Auschwitz in 1942, where he was murdered.\n\nHelene Goldenring\n\nHelene Goldenring visited the Villa Primavera on two occasions, for about a month between May-June 1937, and, again, between December 1937 and January 1938 for two months. Both of her children, Eva and Fritz Goldenring, whoâve been discussed in earlier posts, were also guests on separate occasions. Heleneâs name appears in a Berlin phone directory as late as 1940 (Figure 30), indicating she returned to Germany after her sojourns in Fiesole. At some point, she seems to have joined her brother, Dr. Robert Hirsch, in Chile, before eventually immigrating to America in 1947 after his death, where she reunited with her only surviving child, Eva. (Figure 31)\n\nEugen & Lillian Haydt\n\nIn May 2021, I was contacted by Ms. Tamara Precek, a most delightful Czech lady who has resided in Barcelona, Spain for the past 20 years. She is researching the Winternitz families that lived in Prague around 1850, of whom Lillian Haydt nÃ©e Winternitz is descended. Tamara asked me to send her the âSoggiorno degli Stranieri in Italiaâ forms for Eugen (Figure 43) and Lillian (Figure 44), suspecting I had misread their surnames. Indeed, I had mistaken HAYDT as âHayoth.â\n\nTamara has recently been able to learn what happened to them after their brief stay at the Villa Primavera. They managed to immigrate to Australia, arriving there on the 6th of February 1939 aboard the ship âNIEUW HOLLAND.â Dr. Eugen Haydt changed his named to Albin (Alvin) Eugene Werner (Warner) Haydt (A.E.W. Haydt) but was still generally known as Eugene Haydt. He was a tradesman, and died on the 17th of January 1973; his wife may have worked with him, and passed away on the 4th of February 1997. They appear not to have had any children.\n\nMs. Precek even found a picture of the apartment building where they resided in Sydney. (Figure 45)\n\nLucia von Jacobi\n\nMs. Jacobi co-managed the Villa Primavera as a bed-and-breakfast with my aunt Susanne. She fled Fiesole in 1938 in favor of Switzerland, leaving everything behind, including her personal papers, which were miraculously found in Florence and saved by a German researcher in 1964, Dr. Irene Below (see Blog Post 21 for the full story).\n\nJohanna Leven\n\nJohanna Leven stayed at the Villa Primavera for the first two months of 1938, but clearly returned to Germany after her stay. She was eventually deported from MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany to the Theresienstadt Ghetto in then-Czechoslovakia, where she perished in 1942. (Figure 32)\n\nJulius Matthias\n\nJulius Matthias was among the oldest guest to have stayed at the Villa Primavera, being almost 80 when he visted there between March and April 1937. After his days in Fiesole, he returned to Hamburg, Germany, where he died on May 16, 1942, seemingly of natural causes (i.e., senility, broncho-pneumonia). His death certificate (Figure 33) states he was a non-practicing Jew, although this fact would not have prevented him from being deported to a concentration camp. His death certificate assigned him the name âIsraelâ to identify him as a Jew.\n\nPaul Schoop\n\nPaul Schoop was born in 1907 in Zurich, Switzerland, one of four accomplished offspring (with Max Schoop (b. 1902); Trudi Schoop (b. 1903); Hedwig âHediâ Schoop (b. 1906)) of a prominent family. Paulâs father, Maximilian Schoop, was the editor of Neue Zurcher Zeitung and president of Dolder Hotels. Paul (Figure 34) came to America in September 1939, and eventually joined his three siblings in Van Nuys, California. He was an accomplished composer, concert pianist and conductor, first in Europe and later in America. Paulâs brother-in-law was Frederick Maurice HollÃ¤nder (Figures 35a & b), the famed composer and torch song writer, whoâd once been married to one of Paulâs sister, Hedi Schoop. (Figures 36a & b)\n\nI surmise the reason the Schoop children came to America is because of greater economic and professional opportunities rather than on account of Nazi persecution.\n\nJenny Steinfeld\n\nJenny Steinfeldâs tale is a poignant one. Her name appears with that of her son, Paul Steinfeld, on an April 1937 manifest of boat passengers bound from Bremen, Germany to New York. (Figure 37) A scant five months later, between September and November 1937, she is a guest at the Villa Primavera, clearly having come back from America. Jenny eventually returns to Berlin, and on August 27, 1942 commits suicide there, yet another victim of Nazi persecution. (Figure 38) As with my great-aunt Franziska, who too returned to Berlin from Fiesole, one wonders why Jenny walked back into the maws of death.\n\nThis post deals only in passing with my immediate and extended Bruck family. For this reason, it involved considerably more forensic research, as most of the guests at the Villa Primavera were previously unknown to me. Still, learning more about these people was important to me. In some small way, as the Holocaust victim David Berger wrote in 1941, I hope I have honored and recognized a few other Jewish victims of Nazi persecution so they are not forgotten.\n\nSIDEBAR\n\nRegular readers will know the enjoyment I derive making connections between people and events related to my family. One of my German first cousins, once-removed, Kay Lutze, is friends with an Anja HollÃ¤nder, living in Amsterdam, Netherlands. (Figure 39) Anja is related to Frederick Maurice HollÃ¤nder, the brother-in-law of Paul Schoop, who stayed at the Villa Primavera. In assembling this involved Blog post, I recollected this fact and also that Anja claims a relationship to my Bruck family. I asked Kay whether he knew the relationship, and he could only tell me that the mother of a HollÃ¤nder named LUDWIG HEINRICH HOLLÃNDER was a Bruck. Curious about this, I researched this man on ancestry.com, and, indeed, discovered various historic documents that confirm the distant relationship of the HollÃ¤nder family to my Bruck family. Ludwigâs mother was HELENE HOLLÃNDER nÃ©e BRUCK (1812-1876), who I think is my great-great-great-great-aunt; Helene was married to a BENJAMIN HOLLÃNDER (1809-1884). I discovered his death certificate (Figures 40a & b), along with that of their son Ludwig (1833-1897). (Figures 41a & b)\n\nAs we speak, I am trying to learn how Anja is related to Friedrick and Helene HollÃ¤nder nÃ©e Bruck. Watch this space!\n\nNote: This is the last in the series of articles discussing my Aunt Susanne MÃ¼ller, nÃ©e Bruck, spanning from 1936, when she left Berlin with her husband Dr. Franz MÃ¼ller, to the moment she was arrested in Fayence by the Vichy French in August 1942. It describes the final two-and-a-half to three weeks of her life and that of Ernst Mombert, her step-daughterâs brother-in-law. Surviving documents in my fatherâs personal papers, along with records publicly available, allow me to track the precise route my Aunt Susanne and Ernst took to their deaths in Auschwitz.\n\nMy Aunt Susanne and her step-daughterâs brother-in-law, Ernst Mombert, were arrested by the Vichy French in Fayence, France, probably around the third week of August 1942. Their arrests were the result of the implementation of the so-called âFinal Solution to the Jewish Question.â On January 20, 1942, Nazi officials had convened in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee to discuss the implementation of the Final Solution, whereby most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe would be deported to Poland and murdered. Following the Wannsee Conference, the deportation of Jews throughout Nazi-occupied areas to extermination camps increased in momentum. In France, the deportations, which had begun in March 1942, reached their peak in the summer of 1942, overlapping with the arrest of my relatives. Involvement of French authorities intensified during this period.\n\nArrests of individual Jews in the occupied zone of France had begun around 1940, and general round up in 1941. By March 1941, the Vichy State created the Commissariat General aux Questions juives (âCommissariat-General for Jewish Affairsâ), which managed the seizure of Jewish assets and organized anti-Jewish propaganda. Around this same time, the German began compiling registers of Jews living in the occupied zone. The Second Statut des Juifs of June 2, 1941 systematized registrations across all of France, including the unoccupied parts of France controlled by the Vichy government where Fayence was located. Because Jews in the unoccupied zone were not required to wear the yellow star-of-David badge, these records would provide the basis for future rounds-ups and deportations. No doubt, my relativesâ names were on these registers.\n\nIn Post 22, I told readers seven members of my family once lived at the fruit farm in Fayence, although only two were ever arrested by the French collaborators. It remains unclear why the other five were never seized. While Iâm disinclined for various reasons to credit local French authorities for having played a role in protecting my family during WWII, supposedly 75% of the roughly 330,000 Jews in metropolitan France in 1939 survived the Holocaust, which is one of the highest survival rates in Europe. This story, however, is about Aunt Susanne and Ernst Mombert, my relatives who did not survive.\n\nSoon after my Aunt Susanne was arrested, she and Ernst Mombert were transported approximately 20 miles to the nearby town of Draguignan. (Figures 1 & 2) Whether they were taken there by train or other conveyance is unknown. The priority that the Nazis and their henchmen placed on the extermination of Jews following the Wannsee Conference suggests arrested Jews were brought to major transit centers in a matter of weeks for deportation to concentration camps. Susanne and Ernst wrote an undated postal card to the Mombert family in Fayence from Draguignan, postmarked August 26, 1942, that survives in my fatherâs personal papers; their stay in Draguignan was brief, only half-an-hour. (Figure 3) An acquaintance from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles tells me Jewish detainees were encouraged to write postal cards so Nazis could identify and root out surviving family members.\n\nMy dear ones, We have just arrived in Draguignan and will leave in half-an-hour for aux Milles. Once again, I remind you to ask David to come for the pump, at any price, even if you must pick him up by car. Vegetables, be careful with the string-beans, water every other dayâcabbage twice weekly. Cucumbers every other dayâpick the cornâchase the birds, as directed by Marius. Tomatoes water once a week. Special attention: Carrots! bugs on cabbage. Take care of the old and the young. Donât worry. Before sending the certificates, wait until our address has arrived. Love to all, Susanne, Ernst\n\nFrom Draguignan, Susanne and Ernst were then transported approximately 76 miles to the notorious French detention center at Camp des Milles in Aix-en-Provence, a place that is today a museum. (Figure 4) While it was never an extermination camp, unlike Auschwitz where Susanne and Ernst were murdered, it is extremely foreboding because it survives virtually intact and gives one a real sense of what awaited the Jewish internees. (Figure 5) Susanne and Ernst wrote a second postal card from here, dated August 24, 1942, postmarked five days later. (Figure 6)\n\nAugust 24, 1942 Dearest Peterle, How are you? Did the doctor come? Take care of yourself and donât lose courageâme, I am wellâI have met some acquaintances from HyÃ¨res, a woman doctor from Berlin who knows youâwell, we will see what happens to us. Ernst has also met some people he knowsâwe talk quite often. Mummi, how are you? And Margit and the rest of the family? Donât work too hardâfor the five of you there will be enough from the property. Go to SÃ©nÃ©gnier and explain our situation to him. My thanks to all of you as well as to our friends for their kindness. My love to all of you. Thousand kisses, Papstein! Susanne\n\nNext, Susanne and Ernst were taken 56 miles to Avignon, whose bridge is the subject of a childrenâs well-known French nursery rhyme, Sur le pont dâAvignon, although most certainly this was not on their minds. The last words my Uncle Franz and the Mombert family heard from Susanne and Ernst came from the third and final postal card mailed from there. The card is dated September 2, 1942 and postmarked the same day. (Figures 7 & 8)\n\nSeptember 2, 1942\n\nDearest Franzl, Up to now, the trip has not been too bad. I stayed together with some very nice ladies. We are well fed, too well for my taste. I am so sad that I cannot send you anything (chocolates, sardines, cookies). All these things come from the Quakers and from the Union of the Israelites of France. . . but what does it mean to us? In any case, I have decided to hold on to be reunited with all of you. Do not lose your patience and courage. They have loaded all and everyone in wagon trainsâold people, children, the sick, etc. Kisses, embraces for all of you and good wishes. Susanne\n\nP.S. Maybe I will be able to send you something else.\n\nIn this last postal card, my Aunt Susanne mentions the Union GÃ©nÃ©rale des IsraÃ©lites de France (UGIF), along with the Quakers, as the providers of charitable donations. The Germans created the UGIF on November 29, 1941 to more closely control the Jewish community. Through this organization, the Germans were thus able to learn where local Jews lived. Many of the leaders of the UGIF were themselves ultimately deported to concentration camps.\n\nIn this final postal card, my Aunt Susanne also mentions that by the time Jewish detainees had arrived in Avignon, they had been loaded into cattle cars, likely in Camp des Milles. The SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Chemins de Fer FranÃ§ais (SNCF), the state-owned railroad system of France, was an active participant in the transport of Jewish detainees to the extermination camps, and evidence of their complicity can be seen even today in railroad sidings at Camp des Milles. (Figure 9)\n\nMy relatives never again wrote words that have been handed down to the present. The three postal cards, all written in French, selflessly remind the surviving family to carefully water and tend to the fruits and vegetables on the farm on which their survival clearly depended. The mundane nature of Susanne and Ernstâs final words is a poignant reminder of how ordinary Jews were trying to lead normal lives when their everyday existence was so tragically interrupted by the Nazis.\n\nFrom Avignon, my relatives were taken more than 430 miles to Drancy, a suburb outside Paris, which was an assembly point for Jews being deported to concentration camps. My Aunt Susanne and Ernst Mombert are known to have survived until at least September 7, 1942. Both of their names appear, coincidentally on the same page (Figures 10a & 10b), on a list of 1000 Jewish prisoner deported from Drancy, a suburb of Paris, destined for Auschwitz, aboard Convoy 29, which departed Drancy at 8:55am and arrived in Auschwitz two days later. (Figures 11a & 11b) My aunt, correctly identified as a German national, is incorrectly shown having been born in âRatisbonneâ rather than Ratibor, Germany.\n\nSerge Klarsfeld, a Romanian-born French activist and Nazi hunter known for documenting the Holocaust to enable the prosecution of war criminals, compiled the lists using surviving German documents. The nationality of only 893 deportees was recorded from Convoy 29, possibly because some arrived from the unoccupied zone only a few hours before the convoy was slated to leave for Auschwitz. The German record of deportees was divided into seven sub-lists, and while both Susanne and Ernst originated from the unoccupied zone, they were likely identified as coming from Camp des Milles. The convoy contained 435 women and 565 men. Upon arrival in Auschwitz (Figure 12), except for 59 men and 52 women, the remaining deportees were immediately gassed to death. (Figures 13 & 14) According to my father, his sister always carried a poison pill in a locket, and I choose to believe she took her own life before the convoy arrived in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is impossible to pinpoint the actual date my relatives were arrested in Fayence. Cancellation dates on the postal cards and Susanne and Ernstâs arrival in Drancy no later than September 7th suggest it cannot have taken more than three weeks before they were murdered, no later than September 9th. The ultimate irony is that my aunt moved to Fayence, almost 1000 miles away from where she was born in Ratibor, Germany, only to be hauled back and murdered less than 70 miles from her hometown. Stolpersteins, the small, brass memorials commemorating individual victims of Nazism, have been placed, respectively, at the last residences in Berlin and Giessen, Germany where my Aunt Susanne and Ernst Mombert and his family lived. (Figures 15 & 16)\n\nNote: This post is the next chapter in my Aunt Susanne and Uncle Franzâs story, following their departure from Fiesole, Italy around September 16, 1938. Their exodus came on the heels of enactment of racial laws by Fascist Italy beginning in 1938 enforcing discrimination mainly against Italian and foreign Jews. The final destination, at least in the case of my Uncle Franz, was Fayence, France, 230 miles almost due west as the crow flies across the Ligurian Sea. Why my aunt and uncle fled here was a decision shrouded in mystery, but one I eventually worked out with the assistance of an American researcher studying Dr. Franz MÃ¼llerâs renowned son, Peter MÃ¼ller-Munk.\n\nFayence is located in Franceâs Var region. (Figure 1) Itâs a charming small town of medieval origin that was once fortified and is considered one of a series of âperched villagesâ that overlooks the plain between the southern Alps and whatâs called the Esterel massif, which borders the Mediterranean Sea between Cannes and Saint-RaphaÃ«l. Fayence is slightly more than 40 miles west-southwest of the beautiful seaside town of Nice, along Franceâs CÃ´te dâAzur. Nice is where my parents met in 1946, and a place I spent some enjoyable summers with my maternal grandmother. Iâve been told my grandmother even took me on an outing to Fayence as a child, though I have no recollection of this. But, like Fiesole, Italy, Fayence is a place I associate with my aunt and uncle.\n\nFollowing my aunt and uncleâs departure from Fiesole, likely in the company of my grandmother and my father, I presume they traveled by train through Nice on their way to Fayence. Since my father had an aunt and cousins who lived in Nice, they may even have spent a few days there along the way. Unlike Fiesole, La Mairie or LâHÃ´tel de Ville (City Hall) in Fayence does not appear to have maintained immigration or emigration logs during this period, so itâs impossible to pinpoint my relativesâ arrival there. Suffice it to say, by early October 1938, they were likely in place.\n\nI learned why my aunt, uncle, and grandmother settled in Fayence because of my family tree on ancestry.com. One day, I was contacted via my tree by a woman from Coral Gables, Florida, Ms. Jewel Stern (Figure 2), wanting to speak with me about my uncle. Ms. Stern was trying to learn all she could about Dr. Franz MÃ¼llerâs renowned son, Peter MÃ¼ller-Munk. She explained that not only did my uncle have a son by his first marriage, but he also had a daughter, Karin Margit MÃ¼ller-Munk, a fact I was unaware of. She was married to a man named Franz (âFrancoisâ in France) Hermann Mombert, who with his brother Ernst owned the fruit farm in Fayence where my family sought refuge in 1938. Margitâs brother came to America in 1926 and went on to become a world-renowned silversmith and industrial designer in Pittsburgh, thus, he was known to me unlike his sister, who died relatively young and anonymously in Fayence. Ironically, through Ms. Stern I learned a lot about my own extended family.\n\nAmong my fatherâs pictures are two sets of photographs from Fayence, the first taken between September and November of 1941, the second precisely on March 2, 1947.
