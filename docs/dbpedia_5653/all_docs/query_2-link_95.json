Herbert Hoover once told me that after a newly elected president settles Down in the White House enmeshed in the heavy affairs of Mankind he becomes a prisoner of his staff. That is not limited to presidents. Yes men surround greatness with the Sweet agree ment of the sycophant. I could not help thinking of that As 1 was Reading Charles Callari tans Al s magnificent study of half a Century of Steps that led to War Back door to professor Tansill spent five years Reading documents Many of which have never been published and he comes up with a situation that few if any of us knew at the time. Yet millions of human lives have been destroyed and distorted be cause an error of judgment was made by Chamberlain. His tory abounds with errors of judg ment that prove beyond Cavil that Only god is infallible and that when the great make a mistake it is of ten a great mistake. Could shake Hitler Tansill tells How in 1938, the Ger Man military men and civilians were sure that they could push hit Ler aside. They could get rid of him. These germans did not want War. Tansill gives the list As follows in Germany a Large group of important persons were plotting to push Hitler aside and present a program that would preserve the peace of Europe. This group included such outstanding army officers As colonel general Laid wig von Beck chief of staff colonel general Kurt von Hammerstein commander in a Ger Man army from 1930 to 1934 Gen eral Erwin von Witzleben general Georg Thomas head of the eco nomic division of the planning staff of the army general Eduard wag Ner quartermaster general major general Hans Oster and colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.

General Walther von Brauchitsch approved the main Points in the memorandum and took it to Hitler in july 1938 with definite words of warning. The fuehrer immediately brushed it aside and continued his sudeten general Beck went further. He actually told the British of the men Ace and suggested that the British Send Hitler a stiff note that Viola Tion of czech neutrality would mean War. Chamberlain who was fully appraised of the facts preferred to appease Hitler because it was his judgment that if War came immediately great Britain would not be ready. Here is a mighty incident in his tory. The chief of staff of a coun try pleads with another country to take Steps to prevent War.
