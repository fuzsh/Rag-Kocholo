        "text": "Note: In this postscript to Post 112, I address the question of why Wolfram E. von Pannwitzâs friend, John Kroeker, may have arrived in America as a Stateless citizen, based on a reference sent to me by one of my German friends.\n\nRelated Post:\n\nPOST 112: WOLFRAM E. VON PANNWITZâS BEQUEST TO HIAS\n\nAs a reminder to readers, the inspiration for Post 112 came from Mr. John Thiesen, a gentleman from Newton, Kansas. Among his family papers, he discovered that his grandfather John Kroeker arrived in America in July 1947 aboard the âMarine Marlin,â the same ship my uncle Dr. Fedor Bruck and his friend Wolfram E. von Pannwitz took to come here; it is clear from these ancestral documents that Wolfram and Mr. Kroeker befriended one another on their voyage to America.\n\nMr. Thiesen contacted me through my Blog hoping I might shed some light on why his grandfather suddenly moved from Kansas to Providence, Rhode Island in 1953. Providence is the city where Mr. von Pannwitz lived for several years following his arrival in this country, a place he likely called home until around 1952. Based on passenger manifests I located for Mr. von Pannwitz on ancestry.com, by late 1952 or early 1953, heâd permanently relocated to New York City. I have been unable to determine whether John Kroekerâs move to Providence was related to his friendship with Wolfram.\n\nAnother question Iâd previously been unable to answer was why John Kroeker arrived in America as a âStatelessâ citizen. Since he was a Mennonite, it was clearly not related to the revocation of his German citizenry by the Nazis because of his Jewish ancestry. Possibly, it is connected to one of the multiple reasons for âstatelessnessâ enumerated in the link above (e.g., lack of birth certificate; birth to stateless parents).\n\nBy chance, my German friend Peter Hanke stumbled on an article in German Wikipedia about John Kroekerâs father and John Thiesenâs great-grandfather, Jakob Kroeker, which may provide a clue as to why John Kroeker was Stateless.\n\nAccording to German Wikipedia, Jakob Kroeker was born on the 12th of November 1872 in Gnadental in the Odessa Oblast of the former Soviet Union [today: Dolynivka, Ukraine]. An âoblastâ is an administrative division or region in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and in some of its former constituent republics; readers are reminded that Ukraine was formerly part of the Soviet Union. Given the ongoing war between Russia and the Ukraine, this post coincidentally provides an opportunity to discuss a little history and geography. (Figure 1)\n\nJakob Kroeker was born in a Mennonite colony in Gnadental in the Odessa Oblast, but by 1881 he and his parents had moved to the Crimean Peninsula to the Mennonite village of Spat [today: Havardiiske or Gvardeskoye, Simferopol Raion, Republic of Crimea, Ukraine] near Simferopol. (Figure 2) The Crimean Peninsula, on which the Republic of Crimea is located, became a part of post-Soviet Ukraine in 1991, upon the latterâs independence, by virtue of Ukraineâs inheritance of the territory from the Ukrainian SSR, of which Crimea was a part since 1954. In 2014, Russia annexed the peninsula and established two federal subjects there, the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, but the territories are still internationally recognized as being part of Ukraine.\n\nThe land for the Mennonite village where Spat was established and where Jakob Kroekerâs parents moved to was purchased in 1881 from Mennonites living in the Molotschna Mennonite Settlement [today: Molochansk, Ukraine] (Figure 3); Spat was located near the train station of Sarabus [Sarabuz] (Figure 4), which is about 11 miles or 18 km from Simferopol. Molochansk is approximately 185 miles or 297 km NNE of Simferopol.\n\nLet me briefly digress and provide an instructive history of how and why Mennonites came to be in this part of the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe Molotschna Mennonite Settlement, located in the province of Taurida, Russia [today: Zaporizhia Oblast in Ukraine], on the Molochnaya River, was the second and largest Mennonite settlement of Russia. Chortitza [today: Khortytsia Island], founded in 1789, was the oldest and next in size, located about 71 miles or 114 km NW of Molochansk. (Figure 5) Chortitza was established by Mennonites from Danzig [today: Gdansk, Poland] (Figure 6) and Prussia who had accepted the invitation of Catherine the Great. The basis for this invitation was the fact that the Russian government needed good farmers in the Ukraine on land they had just acquired through a war with Turkey.\n\nMennonite families, which tended to be large, were traditionally farmers but had been forced to seek other occupations as land along the Vistula River near Danzig and in Prussia had become scarce. Further complicating matters were Prussian edicts issued between 1786 and 1801 during and following the reign of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia making it difficult for Mennonites to acquire land, because of their refusal to serve in the military due to their pacifist religious beliefs. Thus, the invitation by the Russian Empress Catherine the Great to relocate from Prussia was attractive because Mennonites could purchase all the land they wanted on the vast steppes of the Tsarâs Russian empire.\n\nFrom a personal point of view, the fact that the Mennonites who founded Chortitza in 1789 came from Danzig is fascinating. Readers who have followed my Blog since its inception in 2017 may recall that my father Dr. Otto Bruck apprenticed as a dentist in Danzig, and later had his own dental practice between 1932 and 1937 in a Mennonite village to the east called Tiegenhof in the Free City of Danzig [today: Nowy Dwor Gdanski, Poland].\n\nThe region where Tiegenhof is located is called Å»uÅawy WiÅlane (i.e. âthe Vistula fensâ), which refers to the alluvial delta area of the Vistula, in the northern part of Poland. Much of the farmland was reclaimed artificially by means of dykes, pumps, channels, and an extensive drainage system. The arduous process of retaking the land from the sea started in the 14th century and was in large part undertaken by the hardworking Puritan community of Mennonites, who originally came from the Netherlands and Flanders to escape religious persecution.\n\nIn any case, the land on the Crimean Peninsula where the town of Spat was established and where Jakob Kroeker grew up was sold to his ancestors by Mennonites who lived in Chortitza but originally came from Danzig and Prussia.\n\nReturning to Jakob Kroeker. Even as a teenager he found comfort in the Christian faith, which eventually drew him to a theological training. He got married to Anna Langemann in 1894, and moved to Hamburg, Germany where he began studying at the Baptist seminary which he completed in four years. John Kroekerâs birth in Hamburg is thus explained.\n\nJakobâs wife could not obtain the necessary health certificate to work abroad, so he became a traveling preacher for the German Mennonites throughout Russia. In around 1906, he moved to Molotschna, where the cultural center of the Mennonites of Russia was located, although by 1910 he emigrated with his wife and children to Germany, to Wernigerode am Harz. Until the outbreak of WWI, he made numerous trips to St. Petersburg and southern Russia, although with the onset of the war he was no longer allowed to leave Wernigerode without permission because of his Russian nationality. The fact that he was never interned by the Germans during the war was probably because he was an ordained minister of the Mennonites.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, until a peace agreement was signed in 1921, Jakob Kroeker held Bible courses for Russian POWs; this is deemed by scholars to have provided the impetus for the great religious movement in Russia after the First World War. This prompted him to cofound the mission union Light in the East in 1920 with the aim of spreading Christian literature among the Russian population. In connection with this, he continued to travel extensively throughout the 1920âs and the early 1930âs until the Nazis came to power, which severely restricted his missionâs work opportunities.\n\nJakob Kroeker and his wife wound up having eleven children, including Wolfram E. von Pannwitzâs friend, John Kroeker. Jakob died in 1948 in MÃ¼hlhausen (Stuttgart) in the German State of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n\nWe know that Jakob Kroeker was born in what was formerly part of the Soviet Union, lived as a child and young man on the Crimean Peninsula, and that he eventually emigrated to Wernigerode am Harz in Germany in around 1910. During WWI he was generally prevented from traveling to Russia on account of his Russian nationality. While he traveled extensively following WWI, he seems to have lived continuously in Wernigerode until around 1945-46 when he moved near Stuttgart. There is no indication that he ever relinquished his Russian nationality in favor of German citizenship, so while he was never interned during the Nazi era, the Nazis may have considered him to be Stateless. Following WWII, most Germans, including Mennonites, still living in the Soviet Union left or were deported; since Jakob had once religiously tended to these expelled German Mennonites, he would have had no reason to return to Russia once his flock was gone. As a Russian citizen, this may explain why Jakob was classified as Stateless, and why his son John Kroeker arrived in America as such.\n\nNote: In this Blog post, I introduce readers to the visitors and clients who signed one of two guestbooks maintained by my ancestor Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck, an array of nobiliary and accomplished patrons representing many duchies and disciplines.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPOST 99: THE ASTONISHING DISCOVERY OF SOME OF DR. WALTER WOLFGANG BRUCKâS PERSONAL EFFECTS\n\nPOST 100: DR. WALTER WOLFGANG BRUCK, DENTIST TO GERMANYâS LAST IMPERIAL FAMILY\n\nDr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck (1872-1937) (Figure 1), acclaimed dentist and distant relative of mine from Breslau, Germany [today: WrocÅaw, Poland], has been the subject of multiple Blog posts. Thanks to a German doctor from KÃ¶penick, Berlin, Dr. Tilo Wahl, who photographed or purchased at auction many personal letters, photos, medals, and memorabilia belonging to my esteemed ancestor and generously shared scans of them with me, I have had a trove of materials to mine for Blog stories. The current post is another result of a closer examination of Dr. Bruckâs private papers.\n\nDuring the late 1920âs and the early 1930âs Dr. Bruck and his family lived in Breslau, Germany in a luxurious home at ReichsprÃ¤sidentenplatz 17, also called Kaiser Wilhelm-Platz (Figure 2), with the owner of record at the time being Walter Bruck. Following the death of Paul von Hindenburg, the German general and statesman who led the Imperial German Army during World War I and later became President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934, ReichsprÃ¤sidentenplatz was renamed by the Nazis to Hindenburgplatz. The renaming of the square was reflected in Breslau address books from 1935 onwards. By 1937, however, Walterâs wife Johanna Bruck was now shown as the owner of record even though Walter continued to live there until he died on the 31st of March 1937. The change in ownership from Walter to Johanna Bruck was a measure to avoid expropriation of the estate by the Nazis as Walter was considered âJewish,â whereas his wife was deemed to be âAryan.â\n\nFrom surviving pictures and two guestbooks belonging to Dr. Bruck that Dr. Wahl physically acquired we know that Dr. Bruck and his wife Johanna Bruck nÃ©e GrÃ¤bsch often entertained and had overnight guests. The visitors seemingly were expected to sign the larger of the guestbooks upon their departure. (Figures 3a-b) This register is 35 pages long with the first guest signature written on the 13th of July 1900 and the last one on the 14th of January 1934. Though the visitors included known family members the bulk of the autographs and entries appear to have been recorded by friends, acquaintances, and colleagues, many of whom were renowned and accomplished individuals. Possibly later I will write a post about this first guestbook and tell readers about some of the names I recognize or have been able to uncover information about.\n\nHowever, this Blog post will deal with the much shorter second guestbook, what Iâll characterize as the register for âspecialâ guests. I presume that most of the people who signed this register were clients of Dr. Walter Bruck rather than guests of my ancestor, although one cannot preclude the possibility that some of these acclaimed individuals were provided with accommodations. Names and several business cards are found on seven pages of this guestbook. (Figures 4a-g) My friend Peter Hanke graciously deciphered the names, and, astonishingly, found web links to most of the people. There are 42 separate entries representing 40 different individuals. In the case of a few individuals the written name was insufficient to positively identify the person; only one signature could not be construed. The earliest signature is recorded in January-February of 1923, and the last one on the 7th of October 1932, making the time span this guestbook covered much shorter than the first one.\n\nGiven the illustrious cadre of clients Dr. Bruck treated, it is impossible in a few words to render justice to their enormous accomplishments. Still, there are a few things that stand out in the roles some played in historic events of their day or as relatives to individuals known to readers. I will identify the signators whose names could be made out and highlight a few things of possible interest.\n\n1. Edwin G[ra]f Henckel von Donnersmarck: JanuarâFebr[uar] 1923\n\n(Count Edwin Henckel of Donnersmarck, January-February 1923)\n\nEdwin Henckel von Donnersmarck (1865-1929) (Figures 4b & 5) was a German-Polish count, landowner, mining entrepreneur, and member of the Prussian House of Representatives.\n\n2. Herzog Albrecht Eugen von WÃ¼rttemberg: Febr[uar] 1923\n\n(Duke Albrecht Eugen of WÃ¼rttemberg, February 1923)\n\nAlbrecht Eugen Maria Philipp Carl Joseph Fortunatus Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg (1895-1954) (Figures 4b & 6) was a German officer and prince of the Royal House of WÃ¼rttemberg. Albrecht Eugen belonged to the Catholic line of the House of WÃ¼rttemberg. At the beginning of WWI, he was drafted into the WÃ¼rttemberg Army where he served four years as captain of the 1st WÃ¼rttemberg Grenadier Regiment; he fought in Flanders, France, and Italy. With the death of King Wilhelm II of WÃ¼rttemberg in 1921, Albrecht Eugen inherited the lordship of Carlsruhe in Silesia, where he worked as a farmer and forester.\n\nDuring WWII, Albrecht Eugen Herzog von WÃ¼rttemberg again did military service in the Wehrmacht, but not at the front, but in staff service, without a rank as a general staff officer. Because members of the House of WÃ¼rttemberg were known as opponents of the Nazi regime, Albrecht Eugen remained in the rank of captain and was not promoted. He was involved in missions in France, Romania, and the Soviet Union. In 1943 he was forced to resign from the Wehrmacht due to the âPrinceâs Decreeâ (German: Prinzenerlass) This refers to a secret decree issued by Adolf Hitler in the spring of 1940. In it, he prohibited all princes that were soldiers in the Wehrmacht who came from the princely and royal houses that had ruled until 1918 from participating in combat operations in WWII. On the 19th of May 1943, Hitler completely expelled all members of formerly ruling princely houses from the Wehrmacht.\n\nBy January 1945, Albert Eugen was forced to flee from Carlsruhe (now spelled Karlsruhe) in the current German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, as Russian troops besieged the area. His castle there with its extensive library of over 30,000 volumes was destroyed by the Red Army.\n\nOn the 24th of January 1924, Albrecht Eugen Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg married the Bulgarian Princess Nadezhda (1899-1958), a daughter of Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. Like her husband, she too signed Dr. Bruckâs guestbook and was probably also one of his patients. (see signature 19)\n\n3. Otto Lummer, Direktor des Physikalischen Instituts der UniversitÃ¤t Breslau, Geh[eimer] Reg[ierungs-] Rat, Dr. ing. h.c. etc.âMÃ¤rz 1923\n\n(Otto Lummer, Director of the Institute of Physics of the University of Breslau, Privy Government Councilor, Doctor of Engineering, h.c. etc., March 1923)\n\nOtto Richard Lummer (1860-1925) (Figures 4b & 7) was a German physicist. Among multiple other inventions, with Eugen Brodhun (1860-1938) he developed the photometer cube. A photometer cube or photometer is an instrument for measuring photometric quantities such as luminance or luminous intensity. In astronomy, it is used to measure the brightness of celestial bodies, while in photography, as readers know, the photometer is used as an exposure meter.\n\n4. P. fon Riechterstein und Boguslaury Lomobusci\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n5. Prof[essor] Dr. Julius Pohl\n\n(Professor Dr. Julius Pohl)\n\nJulius Heinrich Pohl (1861-1942) (Figure 4b) was an Austrian-German pharmacologist and biochemist. From 1897 to 1911 he was Professor of Pharmacology at the German University of Prague and then Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Breslau until 1928.\n\n6. Herzogin von Pless\n\n(Duchess of Pless)\n\nThis signature belongs to Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West, called âDaisyâ (1873-1943) (Figures 4b & 8), who was born in Ruthin Castle, Wales, Great Britain. She became the Princess of PleÃ [today: Pszczyna, Poland], the Countess of Hochberg, and the Baroness of FÃ¼rstenstein [today: WaÅbrzych, Poland]. She was considered the first high-society lady of the European aristocracy. Quoting about her from a website entitled âhostedby.plâ:\n\nâDuchess Maria Teresa Olivia Hochberg von Pless, born on June 28, 1873, known as Daisy, was a English aristocrat connected with the palace in Pszczyna, Poland [German: Pless] (Figure 9) and castle in KsiÄÅ¼, WaÅbrzych [German: Waldenberg] (Figure 10), eldest daughter of Colonel William Cornwallis-West, the owner of the castle Ruthin and estate Newlands, and Mary Adelaide from the home of Fitz-Patrick. She spent all her happy childhood in the Ruthin Castle in North Wales and in a manor house in Newlands. She was closely associated with the court of King Edward VII and George V, relative to the major aristocratic houses of Great Britain. Her brother George was the stepfather of Winston Churchill. She was considered one of the most beautiful aristocrats of her time. Her involvement with the House of Hochberg resulted from an invitation to a masked ball hosted by the Prince of Wales where she met her future husband, Hans Heinrich XV, Prince of Pless, eleven years her elder.\n\nOn the 8th of December 1891, (one year after first meeting him) the eighteen-year-old Daisy married wealthy Prince Hans Heinrich XV Pless Hochberg. The wedding took place at Londonâs Westminster Abbey, and the witness was Edward, Prince of Wales. The wedding was very impressive (the Hochberg Family was the third richest family in Germany and the seventh richest in Europe), echoed in the wide world with the political and aristocratic guests from all parts of Europe. After the wedding ceremony Daisy and her husband went on their honeymoon around the world. After that she came to the Ksiaz, where she felt at this point like a princess from a fairy tale: she had her own castle, own service, beautiful costumes, rich husband andâ¦ was terribly far from her native home in England.â\n\nDaisy hosted lavish parties at her familyâs immense estates in Silesia and at the magnificent castles of FÃ¼rstenstein and PleÃ. Invitations to her affairs were highly sought. She was friends with the outstanding men of her time, including the last German Emperor Wilhelm II. Despite her fairytale existence and trying to become a good subject of her new country, Daisy von Pless felt a British sense of superiority over Germany, which she considered âuncivilized.â\n\nAt the beginning of WWI, Daisy von Pless left FÃ¼rstenstein Castle for political and family reasons. As an Englishwoman, she was constantly subjected to political hostility and accusations of treason. From August 1914, she worked as a Red Cross nurse on hospital trains in France and experienced the end of the war in 1918 in an Austrian hospital in Serbia.\n\nShe did not return to Silesia until 1921. On December 12, 1922, Daisy divorced her husband in Berlin and received a severance payment, which lost value due to inflation. She first lived in the English community of La Napoule near Cannes and in Munich until she moved back to Waldenburg for financial reasons. The entire property of the von Pless family was expropriated in 1939, and in 1940 she had to move out of the castle when a new FÃ¼hrerâs headquarters was expanded there. She visited the GroÃ-Rosen concentration camp nearby several times and sent food there to demonstrate her revulsion with the Nazi regime. In 1943, lonely due to chronic diseases and social isolation, she died impoverished in Waldenburg. Her coffin was reburied in an unknown place before the Red Army invaded in 1945.\n\n7. H XXX Reuss â 16. April 1923\n\n(Prince Heinrich XXX of Reuss, 16th of April 1923)\n\nThis signature belongs to Prince Heinrich XXX of Reuss (1864-1939). (Figures 4b & 11) On September 28, 1898, in Breslau, he married Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (i.e., located in the southwest of the present-day German state of Thuringia (Figure 12)). He was born in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha [German: German Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha] (Figure 13) which was a dual monarchy in Germany. This means that one ruler ruled over two countries, in this case the duchies of Coburg and Gotha.\n\n8. Hansheinrich [Hans Heinrich] FÃ¼rst von Pless [?]\n\n(Hans Heinrich Prince of Pless)\n\nHans Heinrich XV, Prince of Pless, Count of Hochberg (1861-1938) (Figures 4b & 14) was a German nobleman and mining industrialist and married to Daisy von Pless (1873â1943) (see signature 6). They and their three children often lived at FÃ¼rstenstein Castle, the largest castle in Silesia. It is located on the northern edge of the town of WaÅbrzych [German: Waldenberg] in the KsiÄÅ¼ district in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland (see Figure 10). Prince PleÃ had a close relationship with Kaiser Wilhelm II, who regularly spent the hunt season in autumn at PleÃ Castle. The emperor also commissioned the prince with confidential missions. During WWI, PleÃ Castle was the seat of the imperial headquarters for months.\n\nAfter the end of the war and the re-establishment of the Polish state, Hans Heinrich remained in Upper Silesia. The attempt to sell the entire property before July 12, 1922, the official takeover of Upper Silesia by Poland after WWI, failed. Thus, Hans Heinrich XV became a Polish citizen, although he was often on trips abroad or lived on the estates located in Germany.\n\n9. Bolko Graf von Hochbergâ18. April 1923\n\n(Bolko Count of Hochberg, 18th of April 1923)\n\nHans Heinrich XIV Bolko Graf (Count) von Hochberg (1843-1926) (Figures 4b & 15) was a German diplomat, conductor, and composer. He was born at FÃ¼rstenstein Castle [German: Waldenberg; Polish: WaÅbrzych] (see Figure 10) and came from the noble family of the Counts of Hochberg who resided at FÃ¼rstenstein Castle.\n\n10. Per aspera ad astra â R. Pfeifferâ30.4.23\n\n(âThrough hardships to the stars,â R[udolf] Pfeiffer: 30th of April 1923)\n\nThis signature belongs to Rudolf Carl Franz Otto Pfeiffer (1889-1979) (Figure 4b) who was a German classical philologist (i.e., a person who studies classical antiquity usually referring to the study of Classical Greek and Latin literature and the related languages; it also includes Greco-Roman philosophy, history, archaeology, anthropology, art, mythology, and society as secondary subjects)\n\nPer aspera ad astra is a Latin phrase meaning âthrough hardships to the starsâ or âOur aspirations take us to the stars.â The phrase is one of the many Latin sayings that use the expression ad astra, meaning âto the stars.â\n\n11. Hermine Kaiserin Wilhelm II.â23.IV.23\n\n(Hermine Empress Wilhelm II, 23rd of April 1923)\n\nPrincess Hermine Reuss of Greiz (German: Hermine, Prinzessin ReuÃ zu Greiz (1887-1947) (Figure 4c) was the second wife of Germanyâs last Emperor, Wilhelm II. (Figure 16) They were married in 1922, four years after he abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. He was her second husband; her first husband, Prince Johann of SchÃ¶naich-Carolath, had died in 1920. I have previously explained Dr. Bruckâs relationship with Kaiser Wilhelm II and his second wife in Post 100.\n\n12. Geheimrat Professor Dr. Max Kochâ25. Juni 1923\n\n(Privy Councilor Professor Dr. Max Koch, 25th of June 1923)\n\nMaxwell âMaxâ Koch (1854-1925) (Figure 4c) was a German-born Australian botanical collector.\n\n13. Dr. jur. Bernhard Grund, den 17. Juli 1923âPrÃ¤sident der Handelskammer\n\n(Dr. jur. Bernhard Grund, President of the Chamber of Commerce)\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Bernhard Grund (1872-1950) (Figure 4c) was a German lawyer, entrepreneur, and DDP (Deutsche Demokratische Partei or German Democratic Party) politician. Grund was variously a member of the Prussian House of Representatives (1913 to 1918), the Prussian Constituent Assembly (1919 to 1921), and the Prussian Landtag until his resignation on 22 October 1924. Since the 15th century, the term Prussian Landtag has referred to various political institutions in Prussia.\n\n14. Dr. Felix PorschâErster ViceprÃ¤sident des PreuÃ[ischen] Landtagsâ15.3.1924\n\n(Dr. Felix Porsch, First Vice-President of the Prussia Landtag, 15th of March 1924)\n\nDr. Felix Porsch (1853-1930) (Figures 4c & 17) was a German lawyer and politician of the Centre Party. The latter gained its greatest importance between 1871 and 1933 (i.e. the period between the founding of the German Empire and the end of the Weimar Republic). It was the party of Catholics and political Catholicism in the strongly Protestant-dominated German Empire.\n\n15. FÃ¼rstin Hatzfeldtâ24. Mai 1924 [Trachenberg bei Breslau] (Figure 18)\n\n(Princess Hatzfeldt, Trachenberg [today: Å»migrÃ³d, Poland] near Breslau, 24th of May 1924)\n\nHatzfeld, also spelled Hatzfeldt (Figure 4c), is the name of an ancient and influential German noble family. It is not clear who exactly was this princess.\n\n16. H. v. FrischâUniversitÃ¤tsprofessorâDirektor d[es] Zool[ogischen] Instituts u[nd] Museumsâ2.VI.1924\n\n(H. von Frisch, University ProfessorâDirector of the Zoological Institute and Museum, 2nd of June 1924)\n\nKarl von Frisch (1886-1982) (Figures 4c & 19) was a German-Austrian ethologist (i.e., someone who studies animal behavior) who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973, along with Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. His work centered on investigations of the sensory perceptions of the honeybee, and he was one of the first to translate the meaning of the waggle dance. Waggle dance is a term used in beekeeping and ethology for a particular figure-eight dance of the honeybee. By performing this dance, successful foragers can share information with other members of the colony about the direction and distance to patches of flowers yielding nectar and pollen, to water sources, or to new nest-site locations.\n\n17. M[ax] Friederichsen, UniversitÃ¤tsprofessor Dr. phil, Direktor des Geographischen Institutsâ3.6.1924\n\n(M[ax] Friederichsen, University Professor, Dr. Phil., Director of the Geographical Institute, 3rd of June 1924)\n\nMaximilian Hermann Friederichsen (1874-1941) (Figure 4c) was a German professor of geography. Between 1923 until 1937 he worked at the University of Breslau. He was forced into retirement because of his wifeâs Jewish ancestry on account of the Nazi âLaw for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.â\n\n18. Dr. Fritz Reiche, UniversitÃ¤tsprofessor fÃ¼r theoretische Physikâ5.6.1924\n\n(Dr. Fritz Reiche, University Professor for theoretical physics, 5th of June 1924)\n\nDr. Fritz Reiche (1883-1969) (Figure 4c) was a German theoretical physicist who emigrated to the United States in 1941. I will not try to unintelligibly explain to readers the disciplinary studies Reiche was involved in. There is, however, one fascinating account from a book written by a Robert Jungk entitled âHeller als tausend Sonnen,â âBrighter Than A Thousand Suns,â worth mentioning. The book describes the history of the atomic bomb and its carriers. According to this book, shortly before his departure to the United States in March 1941, Max Reiche was approached by the physicist Friedrich Georg Houtermans asking him to deliver a secret message to physicists in America about the atomic bomb. Anticipating that the Nazis would urge the German physicists to build an atomic bomb, the German theoretical physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg, one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics, was supposedly trying to slow-walk the process. Reiche delivered this message to Rudolf Ladenburg, whom he knew from Berlin and Breslau, who forwarded the message to Washington. However, according to a play entitled âCopenhagenâ by Michael Frayn, a three-person play based on the historic meeting of the two physicists Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr and his wife Margrethe in 1941 in German-occupied Copenhagen, there are strong doubts as to whether Heisenberg and his working group were really trying to thwart the construction of the atomic bomb. Perhaps, future historic documents may reveal the truth?\n\n19.

After WWI she had to leave Bulgaria with her family and went into exile in Coburg. In 1924 she married Duke Albrecht Eugen (see signature 2) with whom she had five children. From 1925 to 1930 the couple lived in Carlsruhe (now spelled Karlsruhe) in the current German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (see Figure 12).\n\n20. UniversitÃ¤tsprofessor Dr. Ludolf MaltenâDirektor des Philologischen Seminars\n\n(University Professor Dr. Ludolf Malten, Director of the Philological Seminary)\n\nHeinrich Wilhelm Ludolf Malten (1879-1969) (Figure 4d) was like Rudolf Pfeiffer (see signature 10) a German classical philologist and religious scholar. As previously mentioned, philology is the literary study of Latin and Ancient Greek, the two languages considered âclassical.â In 1919 Malten became a professor at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg in East Prussia. In 1922 he moved to the University of Breslau, where he remained until the end of WWII. After his escape from Breslau in 1945 as the Red Army was approaching, Malten went to the University of GÃ¶ttingen where he spent the remainder of his career.\n\n21. ?????\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n22.

He basically founded the field of social medicine which essentially deals scientifically and practically with the state of health of the population and its determinants, the organization of health care, social security, and the political determinants of health, as well as the effects and costs of medical care. According to some experts, social medicine is a bridge between medicine and other disciplines, such as law, sociology, social work, psychology, statistics, and economics.\n\n23.

Between 1921 and 1930, when he retired, he worked at the Silesian Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t in Breslau.\n\n24. Sieghard Prinz zu Schoenaich-Carolathâ1925\n\n(Sieghard Prince of Schoenaich-Carolath, 1925)\n\nSieghard (1886-1963) (Figures 4d & 22) was a Prince from the Schoenaich-Carolath family, a Lower Lusatian noble family that came to Silesia as a branch in the 16th century; the Silesian branch was elevated to the rank of Imperial Count in 1700 and to the Prussian princely status in 1741. Lower Lusatia is a region and former territory in the south of the state of Brandenburg, northern Saxony, and western Poland. Its principal city is Cottbus.

Historically, the family acquired important properties in the Kingdom of Bohemia, a medieval and early modern monarchy in Central Europe and the predecessor of the modern Czech Republic. By 1929, roughly 50 percent of Prince Rudolfâs (1859-1930) extensive Bohemia properties had been expropriated. The remaining Czech possessions were lost after WWII due to nationalization because of the BeneÅ¡ Decrees, though some former possessions in the Czech Republic were returned to the family after 1990. The Kinskys provided numerous important statesmen in the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the Habsburg Monarchy. The historical capital of Bohemia was Prague, since 1918 the capital of Czechoslovakia and now the Czech Republic.\n\n27.

After the abolition of the monarchy and the abdication of the emperor and the federal princes, George became a Roman Catholic priest. As I implied under Duke Albrecht Eugen von WÃ¼rttemberg (see signature 2), during the time of the National Socialists, former royal members were unpopular, so Georg Herzog devoted himself to consulting at this time.

Adolf Hitlerâs seizure of power in 1933 made it impossible for the Central Committee to continue working. In 1934, for the planned German Katholikentag, German Catholic Day, Prussian Prime Minister Hermann GÃ¶ring demanded an oath of allegiance to the Third Reich, which Aloys zu LÃ¶wenstein refused to provide resulting in cancellation of the event; it would not again take place until 1948.\n\n32.

Hatzfeldt Trachenbergâ11.4.1927\n\n(Prince v. Hatzfeldt Trachenberg, 11th of April 1927)\n\nPrince Hermann von Hatzfeldt, Duke of Trachenburg (1848-1933) (Figures 4f & 29) was a German nobleman, member of the House of Hatzfeld, civil servant, Prussian politician, and major general from Silesia.\n\nHermann Friedrich Anton was the 3rd Prince of Hatzfeldt of Trachenberg (see Figure 18). He was born at the family castle in Trachenberg and raised Catholic. In 1874 he succeeded his deceased father, who was excommunicated in 1847, as head of the Hatzfeldt-Trachenberg line. On the 1st of January 1900 he was awarded the hereditary title âDuke of Trachenbergâ in primogeniture. From 1894 to 1903 he was President of the Province of Silesia. In 1872 he married Natalie GrÃ¤fin von Benckendorff (1854â1931), who is presumed to be signature 34.\n\n34.

Prinzessin Biron [?] von Curlandâ10.10.1927\n\n(Princess Biron of Curland, 10th of October 1927)\n\nCountess Herzeleide of Ruppin (1918-1989) (Figures 4f & 30) was born on Christmas Day 1918, shortly after the defeat of the German Reich and the collapse of the monarchy. For this reason, she was given the name Herzeleide, which in German means âheartbreak.â Her grandfather was Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor, and her father was Prince Oskar of Prussia, the 5th son of Wilhelm II. On August 15, 1938, Herzeleide married Prince Karl Biron von Courland, and was thereafter known as Herzeleide Prinzessin von Preussen (Prinzessin Biron von Curland).\n\nBiron of Curland is a Courland noble family, originating from Latvia (Courland in Latvia is Kurzeme), that also settled in Silesia and Bohemia. Branches of the family still exist today. Courland (Latvian Kurzeme) (Figure 31) is one of the four historical landscapes of Latvia, along with Semgallen (Zemgale), Central Livonia (Vidzeme) and Latgale (Latgale).\n\n37.

Blandineâs parents divorced in 1870, and her mother Cosima married Richard Wagner later that same year. Richard Wagner, known to many readers, is considered one of the most important innovators of European music in the 19th century.\n\n39. Eudoxie Prinzessin von Bulgarienâ31.XII.1929\n\n(Eudoxie Princess of Bulgaria, 31st of December 1929)\n\nPrincess Eudoxia of Bulgaria (1898-1985) (Figures 4f & 33) was a Bulgarian princess who played the role of the First Lady of Bulgaria for some time until her brother Boris married Princess Joan of Savoy. Eudoxiaâs sister was Princess Nadezhda (see signature 19), and her brother-in-law was Duke Albrecht Eugen of WÃ¼rttemberg (see signature 2).\n\nPrincess Eudoxia was born in Sofia, Bulgaria as the eldest daughter of King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and his first wife, Princess MarÃ­a Luisa de BorbÃ³n-Parma.

[Dorotheus] Kracker von Schwartzenfeldt, Imperial German Envoy (retired)) (humbly inquires whether he will be available on Tuesday, the 5th of March at any time. . .)\n\nThis business card belonged to Dr. iuris Dorotheus Kracker von Schwartzenfeldt (1869-1953). He was the Kaiserlicher Legations-SekretÃ¤r und GeschÃ¤ftstrÃ¤ger in BogotÃ¡ (Imperial Legation Secretary and ChargÃ© dâAffaires in BogotÃ¡) and had previously worked for the last German Emperor Wilhelm II in Doorn, Netherlands, after the Kaiser abdicated the throne following WWI.\n\nAs mentioned at the outset, the entries in Dr. Bruckâs guestbook for âspecialâ visitors and/or dental patients covers the period from January-February 1923 until October 1932. Among the signatures, you will notice multiple names that include former hereditary titles. To remind readers, the nobility system of the German Empire ended in 1919 when it was abolished. Today, the German nobility is no longer conferred by the Federal Republic of Germany, and constitutionally the descendants to German noble families do not enjoy legal privileges. Former hereditary titles, however, are permitted as part of the surname (i.e., the nobiliary particles von and zu), and these surnames can then be inherited by a personâs children. The continued use of hereditary titles by Dr. Bruckâs visitors should not surprise anyone given the brief time since their use had been abolished in 1919.\n\nBeyond the former members of the nobility that signed Dr. Bruckâs guest register, one will also notice an array of accomplished individuals in the fields of law, politics, science, academia, and more. This speaks to the rarified environment in which Dr. Bruck worked and socialized.\n\nNote: In the second installment of Post 98, I will briefly tell readers about some of the historic vital event documents I found related to Roberto Hirschâs ancestors, focusing on ones from the mid-to-early 19th century that allowed me to trace Robertoâs ancestry seven generations back to the mid 18th century. As readers will see, some of these records are challenging to decipher.\n\nRelated Post:\n\nPost 98, Part 1 (Stories): The Woinowitz Zuckerfabrik (Sugar Factory) Outside Ratibor (Part V-Chilean Descendants)\n\nRoberto Hirsch (Figure 1), to remind readers, is the great grandnephew of Sigmund Hirsch (Figure 2), former co-owner of the Woinowitz Zuckerfabrik. As I discussed in part 1 of this post, Roberto contacted me through Webmail and filled in details on a few of his ancestors I have previously written about. He gave me enough details to uncover vital event documents on some, which I supplemented by finding records on others Roberto did not know about.\n\nAs discussed in part 1, Robertoâs grandparents, Hermann Hirsch (1876-1943) and Ida Hirsch nÃ©e Sollinger (1874-1944) (Figure 3), were murdered in Theresienstadt during the Holocaust. Roberto thought his grandfather had only two siblings, Sofie Hirsch (b. 1875) (Figure 4) and Karl Hirsch (b. 1879) (Figure 5) and knew Karl like his parents had been murdered in the Shoah; according to Yad Vashem, tragically, Sofie was also killed during the Holocaust. (Figure 6) Additionally, it turns out Hermann Hirsch had yet another sibling Roberto was unaware of, Bernhard Hirsch (b. 1877). (Figure 7) I suspect this sibling may have died at a young age but have not found proof of this.\n\nRoberto obviously knew of his great-grandfather Jakob Hirsch (1842-1905) (Figure 8) and great granduncle Sigmund Hirsch (1848-1920). Again, Jakob and Sigmund had a third sibling Roberto did not know of, also named Bernhard Hirsch (1836-1888). (Figure 9)\n\nI was able to establish a connection between Robertoâs ancestors and the city of Karlsruhe in the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg through records I initially found for Ratibor, Germany [today: RacibÃ³rz, Poland] rather than for Karlsruhe. Let me explain.\n\nPrior to being contacted by Roberto Hirsch, I knew when Sigmund Hirsch had died and even have a picture of his headstone from the former Jewish Cemetery in Ratibor. (Figure 10) One of the Ratibor microfilms available through familysearch.org, the Mormon Libraryâs online database, Family History Library (FHL) microfilm 1184448 records his date of death as the 15th of October 1920. (Figure 11) It took me a while to realize the death register is organized according to the Hebrew calendar. Thus, the page with Sigmund Hirschâs name is entitled âMarcheschwan,â which is âHeshvan,â covering the months of October-November. This comports with Sigmundâs known death inscribed on his headstone as the 14th of October 1920. Similarly, for Sigmundâs wife, Selma Hirsch nÃ©e Braun, who I knew from the same headstone died on the 11th of July 1916, I found her name under the Jewish month of âTamusâ or âTammuzâ (Figure 12), encompassing the months of June-July. Below, I discuss another surprising discovery I made on FHL microfilm 1184448.\n\nThe key to unraveling Roberto Hirschâs lineage was discovering his great-grandparentsâ marriage certificate on ancestry.com. Jakob Hirsch (Sigmundâs brother) and his wife, Auguste Hirsch nÃ©e Hirsch from a different branch of the Hirsch family, were married in Karlsruhe, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany on the 30th of July 1874. (Figure 13) German marriage certificates typically provide a wealth of information, including the age and the date and place of birth of the espoused, along with the names of the parents, including the maiden names of the mothers. While I cannot read or speak German, the handwriting is crisp enough that I could make out the key vital information.\n\nJakob Hirsch, I learned, was 31 years of age at the time of his marriage, was born in Carlsruhe (former spelling of Karlsruhe), and his parents were Emanuel Hirsch and Jette (short for Henriette) nÃ©e Ettlinger. Jakobâs wife, Auguste, was 25 when she married, was born in Ilvesheim, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, and her parents were LÃ¶b Hirsch II and Johanna nÃ©e Herz. Armed with this new information, I quickly found Emanuel Hirschâs death certificate showing he died on the 25th of March 1880 in Karlsruhe.\n\nJakobâs 1874 marriage certificate was the first solid evidence I found for his fatherâs full name, Emanuel Hirsch. As a related aside, Roberto shared an 1879 letter written in the old German script âSÃ¼tterlin,â signed by âE. Hirsch,â with separate sections addressed to his other son Sigmund and daughter-in-law Selma Hirsch nÃ©e Braun. What makes this letter so quaint is that Sigmund married Selma without introducing her to his parents. This meant he did not have permission to marry her, in those days a big affront in Jewish families. Regardless, Emanuel Hirschâs 1879 letter graciously welcomed Selma to the family.\n\nInitially uncertain what might have happened to Sigmund and Jakobâs parents, Emanuel Hirsch and Henriette Hirsch nÃ©e Ettlinger, I re-examined FHL microfilm 1184448, thinking they might have died in Ratibor. What I discovered surprised me. Under the Jewish month of âNissanâ or âNisan,â covering March-April, I found both their names in Ratiborâs death register. (Figure 14) Under the column titled âBeerdigungsort,â or burial place, they are both shown however to have been buried in Karlsruhe. In Emanuelâs case, his listing under March comports with the month of his death; however, in the case of Emanuelâs wife Henriette, from her death certificate which I also found, she is known to have died in August. Why both names are listed in the Ratibor death register when they are known to have died in Karlsruhe is a bit of a mystery; I assume it is because their son Sigmund was connected to Ratibor. These towns are more than 575 miles apart.\n\nRegardless, the findings discussed firmly established a link to Karlsruhe and Ilvesheim in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany for Roberto Hirschâs family. I returned to familysearch.org, hoping to find Jewish microfilm for one town or the other, and was rewarded in both instances. Finding these records was the ultimate step to documenting Robertoâs lineage.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Emanuel and Henriette Hirschâs three sons, Bernhard, Jakob, and Sigmund were born, respectively, in 1836, 1842, and 1848. These dates narrowed the âwindowâ to search for birth records in Karlsruhe. From their death records, I knew Bernhard and Jakob were born in Karlsruhe, and assumed Sigmund had also been born there.\n\nBernhard (Figures 15a-b), Jakob (Figures 16a-b), and Sigmundâs (Figures 17a-b) birth register listings are all found on FHL microfilm 1256447 for Karlsruhe. Without knowing beforehand their actual or approximate years of birth, it is quite unlikely I would have located their listings. Given how indecipherable the text is, as readers can see for themselves, knowing what to search for was the key to finding the listings. At a minimum, birth registers give the name and date of birth of the newborn and the names of the parents.\n\nThe most challenging listing to read was that of Bernhard Hirsch. Literally, I thought I could read four words out of five lines, namely, âMutter Jette geb. Ettlingerâ (circled) translated as âMother Jette nÃ©e Ettlinger.â The surname âHirschâ written in the margin (circled), though now recognizable to me, was initially indiscernible. My go-to German friend, Peter Hanke, transcribed and translated all three birth register listings for me, along with the other documents illustrated and discussed below.\n\nHaving confirmed Bernhard was born in 1836, I turned my attention to finding his parentsâ marriage register listing in Karlsruhe. While they might possibly have gotten married after Bernhardâs birth, I assumed they would have married before 1836. Again, after much hunting, I eventually found Emanuel Hirsch and Jette Ettlinger got married on the 27th of May 1834. (Figures 18a-b) Both Emanuel and Jetteâs parents were named on this document, information that allowed me to track Robertoâs maternal ancestors yet another two generations as the table below illustrates.\n\nHaving gleaned what I could from the birth and marriage register listings for Karlsruhe, I next turned my attention to FHL microfilm 1271220 containing Jewish records for Ilvesheim, in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Located approximately 39 miles north of Karlsruhe, this is where Robertoâs great-grandmother Auguste Hirsch nÃ©e Hirsch was born around 1849 according to her 1874 marriage certificate (discussed above). Again, after much scrutiny, I found her birth register listing showing âGustel,â short form for Auguste, was born on the 14th of January 1849. (Figures 19a-b) As readers can see from the translation, Augusteâs parents are identified, LÃ¶w Hirsch and Jeannette nÃ©e Herz, which gave me further names to check out.\n\nAs mentioned in the first installment of Post 98, Roberto Hirsch, while born in 1944 in Santiago, Chile has lived in Bonn, Germany for the last 50 years. Prior to WWII, his grandfather Hermann Hirsch owned a well-known department store in Bonn shown in part 1 of this post. When Roberto reached out to me, he told me he thought Hermann had been born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, about 85 miles south-southeast of Karlsruhe. From Hermannâs birth certificate, I ascertained he was actually born in Karlsruhe. (Figure 20)\n\nRoberto confirmed his familyâs association with both cities. He accessed and sent me address books for Karlsruhe from 1840 (Figure 21), 1855 (Figure 22), and 1874 (Figure 23), and one from Freiburg from 1887 (Figure 24) with listings for his family. The 1840 and 1855 Karlsruhe address books identify his great-great-grandfather Emanuel Hirsch as a âschneider,â a tailor. The 1874 Karlsruhe address book by then lists Emanuel as a âpartikulier,â a ship owner who works for larger shipping companies, and his son Sigmund as a âkaufman,â a tradesman; clearly, at some point, Sigmund Hirsch moved to Ratibor and became co-owner of the Woinowitz Zuckerfabrik there. The 1887 Freiburg address book lists Robertoâs great-grandfather Jakob Hirsch also as a âkaufman.â\n\nAs regular readers may have noticed, I have started including a table of vital statistics for the people discussed in my posts sourcing the vital data. This may seem unimportant, but I consider it relevant given all the erroneous data found on ancestral trees. As an example, in the case of Roberto Hirschâs great-grandfather, I found a family tree stating Jakob Hirsch was born around 1843. I located the birth register listing for this Jakob, and it is clear to me this was a different person with the same name. While generally dismissive of trees with basic errors, after studying the inscrutable vital records for Karlsruhe and Ilvesheim, I can easily understand how genealogists might make honest mistakes. Naturally, this assumes researchers have tried to track down primary source documents, my benchmark for accuracy.\n\nROBERTO HIRSCHâS SIMPLIFIED FAMILY âTREEâ BACK SEVEN GENERATIONS\n\nGENERATION PATERNAL LINE PATERNAL LINE SPOUSE MATERNAL LINE MATERNAL LINE SPOUSE GEN. 0 Roberto Hirsch (self) (b. 1944) GEN. 1 Fritz Hirsch (father) (1908-2006) Margarete Janzen (mother)\n\n(1914-1992)\n\nGEN. 2 Hermann Hirsch (grandfather) (1876-1943) Ida Sollinger (grandmother)\n\n(1874-1944)\n\nGEN. 3 Jakob Hirsch (g-grandfather)\n\n(1842-1905)\n\nAuguste Hirsch (g-grandmother)\n\n(1849-1935)\n\nGEN. 4 Emanuel âNathanâ Hirsch g-g-grandfather) (1805-1880) Henriette âJetteâ Ettlinger (g-g-grandmother) (1808-1882) GEN. 5 Nathan Hirsch (g-g-g-grandfather) Sara Mandel (g-g-g-grandmother) (1763-1839) Bernard Ettlinger (g-g-g-grandfather) (1777-1847) Therese Levi (g-g-g-grandmother) GEN. 6 Seligmann Ettlinger (g-g-g-g-grandfather)\n\n(unk.-1805)\n\nRachel Weinheimer (g-g-g-g-grandmother) (1739-1817) GEN. 7 UNKNOWN ETTLINGER Malka (unk. maiden name) (g-g-g-g-g-grandmother (unk.-1770)"
