        "text": "Volume One Available Now!\n\nOur new book, Where Did They Put the Gestapo Headquarters? A Walking Tour of Nazi-Occupied Paris, is available for sale direct from Stew and Yooper Publications.\n\nThe price of the book is $24.95.

I hope you enjoy the following preview of the book.\n\nThe False War & Vichy, 1940-1944\n\nBRING OCCUPIED PARIS TO LIFE\n\n(without obtaining a ration card to survive)\n\nCome walk in the footsteps of the men, women, and children who lived, worked, and died in Nazi-occupied Paris. Your walks will take you to buildings, places, and sites that were significant to the Nazis, French Resistance, Free French, the British, and most importantly, the citizens of Paris.\n\n“Maybe I’ll protect it; maybe I won’t. It’s up to me.”\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\n(to Albert Speer on the fate of Paris sometime during their three-hour tour of Paris on the morning of 28 June 1940)\n\nAlthough World War II and the German occupation of Paris occurred more than 75 years ago, these historical events are still fresh in our minds. France spent almost 40 years denying its role in the collaboration with the Nazis and in particular, the arrests and deportations of the French Jewish population. While the German occupation of Paris started out rather benignly in June 1940, within two years the city and its citizens were firmly in the grip of the tightening Nazi vise.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nWALK ONE (Vichy France)\n\nLouis Darquier de Pellepoix to the Kommandantur du Groß -Paris\n\nWALK TWO (PARIS BY NIGHT)\n\nCabaret le Shéhérazade to the Milice Headquarters\n\nWALK THREE (SOLDIERS ON LEAVE)\n\nMontmartre: UGIF to the Moulin Rouge\n\nMETRO WALKS (OTHER SITES TO VISIT)\n\nSample Stops\n\nWALK ONE STOP 10\n\nWALK TWO STOP 9\n\nTestimonials\n\n“Stew blends the dark history of buildings in Paris that are associated with the infamous deeds of the Gestapo with contrasting insights into the bravery of the French people, who, at great risk to themselves and their families, secretly resisted the German Occupation.”\n\n⏤Squadron Leader Stanley Booker, MBE, RAF (Ret.), Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur, Member: KLB Club\n\n“An invaluable guide to a host of little-known locations and facts about wartime occupied Paris. Not just for the historian, this book will allow anyone to view this beautiful city of light in the shadows of enemy occupation.”\n\n⏤Paul McCue\n\nHistorian, lecturer, and author of SAS Operation Bulbasket: Behind the Lines in Occupied France 1944\n\n“Guidebooks are usually described as informative, sometimes entertaining and Stew Ross’ newest work is both. It is also more⏤it evokes a difficult and frightening time in the history of the City of Light. The detailed descriptions of sites such as the Vél’ d’Hiv’ or Gestapo headquarters as well as the home of glamorous traitors such as Coco Chanel reminds us of the choices people made during those years. Even more interesting is how Paris did its best to remain a capital of pleasure as nightclubs and cabarets remained open to the mainly German audience.”\n\n⏤Cynthia Bisson, PhD\n\nProfessor of History, Belmont University\n\nFrench Resistance Expert\n\n“Another outstanding, well-researched, and presented book by Stew Ross. It gives a detailed guided walking tour full of facts about the activities of the Gestapo during their occupation of Paris during World War II. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in what life was like during the Nazi occupation in France.”\n\n⏤Richard H.F. Neave\n\nMember of Paris-based Libre Résistance SOE “F” section and author of SOE: A Life in the Shadows”\n\nWalks Through History\n\nCopyright © 2022 Stew Ross\n\nI thought perhaps you might like to read about a site I’ve decided to include in the first volume of our new book series, Where Did They Put the Gestapo Headquarters? A Walking Tour of Nazi-Occupied Paris. For those of you who have read one or more of my prior books, you know that four walks are included along with a section called “Métro Walks.” Each of the four walks has multiple stops and you can walk from one stop to the next without having to jump on the métro. However, there are sites that are interesting, but I couldn’t fit them into any of the walks or they are stand-alone stops accessible by means other than the métro. Typically, I include four of these sites in each book. For example, in volume two of the book, Where Did They Burn the Last Grand Master of the Knights Templar? A Walking Tour of Medieval Paris, one of the Métro Walk stops is Château-Gaillard. This is the castle built by King Richard the Lionheart after he was released from captivity in 1194 by Leopold V, Duke of Austria. It has a very interesting history and the castle’s ruins are situated on a hill overlooking the Seine River and easily accessible by car.\n\nToday’s subject is in the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a suburb of Paris about seventeen miles (twenty kilometers) to the west. It also sits on a hill overlooking the Seine. Its strategic location was one of the reasons why Hitler chose Saint-Germain-en-Laye as headquarters for the Oberbefehlshaber West (Ob West), or German Commander-in-Chief in the West. It is a somewhat compact town and perfect for walking to the numerous bunkers built by the Germans as well as their command headquarters. It is also a town with quite a bit of French history.\n\nRead More OB West"
