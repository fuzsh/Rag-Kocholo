        "text": "Given the immensity of von Manstein's historical figure... let him briefly tell us his story....\n\nMaybe he would tell us something like that...\n\nI was born in 1887 and baptized Fritz Erich von Lewinski. I was adopted by my uncle Georg who, like my father, was a general.\n\nI served the Kaiser in the great war. I stayed in the army in the interwar period. I returned to serve my country in World War II. I had a talent for planning. It worked well in Poland in 1939 and better in France in 1940.A new word came up to define my idea: it was called blitzkrieg.\n\nThen I was sent to Russia. There I lost my beloved son Gero on October 29, 1942. He was only nineteen…\n\nAnother generation, another time father and son.... The proud father poses with the young Lieutenant Gero (Erich Sylvester) von Manstein\n\nConquered Crimea in 1941, captured Sevastopol in 1942.\n\nAfter the disaster of Stalingrad, in March 1943, I led the most successful German offensive of the entire war: I reconquered Kharkov and Belgorod. I stopped the Soviet offensive and caused them catastrophic losses. A new word came up to define my idea: it was called elastic defense. It was a success. After the battle of Kursk, in September 1943, I managed to retreat to the western side of the Dnieper. I saved my army again and again inflicted huge casualties on the Soviets.\n\nI adore this photo. Smoking the cigar of victory...\n\nIn mid-February 1944 I disobeyed Hitler and broke through the encirclement of Cherkassy by pulling 56,000 of my men out of the trap. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. On 30 March 1944 I was withdrawn from the front, forced to resign and sent near Dresden to convalesce from my eye disease, went into retirement and awaited the end of the war.\n\nThis other one is great and not very common to see: Der Generalfeldmarschall und der Weihnachtsmann\n\nI was captured by the British. I was tried by a British court in Nuremberg in 1946. I was sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 1953, after my release, I was an adviser to the federal government for the creation of the Bundeswehr and helped my former enemies protect Western Europe from the Soviet threat. I dedicated my entire life and skill to serving my country.\n\nI died in Irschenhausen, Bavaria on June 11, 1973. There I rest with my Jutta and our beloved Gero....\n\nGrave of the von Manstein family\n\nMoritz (Karl Albert) von Bock (1828 – 1897) was a Prussian General\n\nMoritz von Bock, 1828-1897\n\nAfter his father's death, Bock ingresed the cadet houses in Potsdam and Berlin.

After briefly overseeing the Inspectorate of Military Schools in 1889, General von Brauchitsch was assigned as director of the Kriegsakademie in Berlin from 20 September 1890 to 19 April 1896 and also served as General à la suite in Kaiser Wilhelm II.'s retinue.\n\nUpon his retirement from active duty on 18 April 1896, Lieutnant-General- von Brauchitsch was promoted to the brevet rank of General der Cavallerie.\n\nTwo of his sons, Adolf and Gottfried, served at the rank of Generalmajor in the Prussian Army.\n\nGeneral Oberst Walther von Brauchitsch, 1881 - 1948\n\nHis sixth son Generalfeldmarschall Walther von Brauchitsch was commander-in-chief of the German Wehrmacht at the outset of World War Two.\n\nThe army's failure to take Moscow earned Hitler's enmity, and things worsened for him, as he suffered a heart attack in November.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failure at Moscow, Brauchitsch was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on 19 December and was transferred to the Führerreserve (officers reserve), where he remained without assignment until the end of the war; he never saw Hitler again.\n\nBernhard von Brauchitsch grave is located in the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin.\n\n(Karl Rochus) Edwin von Manteuffel (1809 - 1885) was a Prussian General der Kavallerie\n\nEdwin Freiherr von Manteuffel, 1809-1885\n\nGeneral Hasso von Manteuffel's father was Eccard von Manteuffel, an army officer, who died in January 1907.

Otto von Stülpnagel)\n\nHe was a member of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, being in charge of the conspirators' actions in France. On the day in question, 20 July 1944, Stülpnagel put his part of the plot into operation.\n\nThis mainly involved to round up all SS and Gestapo officers in Paris and imprison them. However, when it became apparent that the assassination attempt in East Prussia had failed, Stülpnagel was forced to release his prisoners.\n\nAfter the failure of the plot, he was recalled to Berlin, he stopped at Verdun and attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head with a pistol on the banks of the Meuse River, but failed…….

In the same year he took part in the German war. In 1869 Rundstedt was promoted to regimental adjutant and in this position took part in the war against France in 1870/71. For his achievements he received the Iron Cross, Second Class.\n\nHe was the father of four children, all of them became Prussian Army officers. Next we will talk about the elder of them.\n\nGerd von Rundstedt was born in Aschersleben, north of Halle in Prussian Saxony (now in Saxony-Anhalt). As we said he was the eldest son of Gerd Arnold Konrad von Rundstedt, a cavalry officer who served in the Franco-Prussian War. The Rundstedts are an old Junker family that traced its origins to the 12th century and classed as members of the Uradel, or old nobility, although they held no titles. Virtually all the Rundstedt men since the time of Frederick the Great had served in the Prussian Army.\n\n(Karl Rudolf) Gerd von Rundstedt (Aschersleben, December 12, 1875 - Hannover, February 24, 1953)\n\nInvasion of Poland, Battle of France, Battle of Kiev, Battle of Dieppe, Battle of Kursk, Battle of Hürtgen Forest, Operation Market-Garden, Battle of the Bulge.... Reached the rank of field marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) in the Wehrmacht\n\nHe was recalled at the beginning of World War II as commander of Army Group South in the invasion of Poland. He commanded Army Group A during the Battle of France, and was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal in 1940. In the invasion of the Soviet Union, he commanded Army Group South, responsible for the largest encirclement in history, the Battle of Kiev. He was relieved of command in December 1941, but was recalled in 1942 and appointed Commander-in-Chief in the West.\n\nHe was dismissed after the German defeat in Normandy in July 1944, but was again recalled as Commander-in-Chief in the West in September, holding this post until his final dismissal by Adolf Hitler in March 1945...\n\nI would say that the fourth ribbon in his ribbon bar is the China Denkmünze."
