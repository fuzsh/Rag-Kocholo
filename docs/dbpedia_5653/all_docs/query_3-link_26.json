The apparent purpose of the assassination attempt was to seize political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) in order to obtain peace as soon as possible. The underlying desire of many of the involved high ranking Wehrmacht officers was apparently to show to the world that all Germans were not like Hitler and the NSDAP. However, no details of intended peace initiatives to be proposed by the conspirators have been identified.[1][2][3]\n\nThe plot was the culmination of the efforts of several groups in the German Resistance to overthrow the Nazi-led German government. The failure of both the assassination and the military coup d'état which was planned to follow it led to the arrest of at least 7,000 people by the Gestapo.[4] According to records of the Führer Conferences on Naval Affairs, 4,980 of these were executed.[4]\n\nBackground\n\nSince 1938, conspiratorial groups planning an overthrow of some kind had existed in the German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) and in the German Military Intelligence Organization (Abwehr). Early leaders of these plots included Brigadier-General Hans Oster, General Ludwig Beck and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben. Oster was the deputy head of the Military Intelligence Office. Beck was a former Chief-of-Staff of the German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, OKH). Von Witzleben was the former commander of the German 1st Army and the former Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Command in the West (Oberbefehlshaber West, or OB West). They soon established contacts with several prominent civilians, including Carl Goerdeler, the former mayor of Leipzig, and Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, the great-grandnephew of the hero of the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nMilitary conspiratorial groups exchanged ideas with civilian, political and intellectual resistance groups in the Kreisauer Kreis (which met at the von Moltke estate in Kreisau) and in other secret circles. Moltke was against killing Hitler; instead, he wanted him placed on trial. Moltke said, \"we are all amateurs and would only bungle it\". Moltke also believed killing Hitler would be hypocritical. Hitler and National Socialism had turned \"wrong-doing\" into a system, something which the resistance should avoid.[5]\n\nPlans to stage an overthrow and prevent Hitler from launching a new world war were developed in 1938 and 1939, but were aborted because of the indecision of Army Generals Franz Halder and Walther von Brauchitsch, and the failure of the western powers to oppose Hitler's aggressions until 1939. This first military resistance group delayed their plans after Hitler's extreme popularity following the unexpectedly rapid success in the battle for France.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1942, a new conspiratorial group formed, led by Colonel Henning von Tresckow, a member of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock's staff, who commanded Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa. Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists to the Group's staff, making it the nerve centre of the Army resistance. Little could be done against Hitler as he was heavily guarded, and none of the plotters could get near enough to him.[6]\n\nDuring 1942, Oster and Tresckow nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. Their most important recruit was General Friedrich Olbricht, head of the General Army Office headquarters at the Bendlerblock in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units throughout Germany. Linking this asset to Tresckow's resistance group in Army Group Centre created a viable coup apparatus.[7]\n\nIn late 1942, Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage an overthrow during Hitler's visit to the headquarters of Army Group Centre at Smolensk in March 1943, by placing a bomb on his plane. The bomb failed to detonate, and a second attempt a week later with Hitler at an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin also failed. These failures demoralised the conspirators. During 1943 Tresckow tried without success to recruit senior Army field commanders such as Field Marshal Erich von Manstein and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, to support a seizure of power. Tresckow in particular worked on his Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge to persuade him to move against Hitler and at times succeeded in gaining his consent, only to find him indecisive at the last minute.[8]\n\nRank: Advanced Member\n\nJoined: 4/20/2016\n\nPosts: 2,715\n\nNeurons: 201,300\n\nLocation: South Dublin, Ireland\n\n\"The apparent purpose of the assassination attempt was to seize political control of Germany\".\n\nTraitors are traitors.\n\nA small group of people thought that they may change the minds of majority. The prevailing number of Deutch were not against A.H. but against the wrong turn of the War. It should have stopped after France.\n\nIt was in the 1940 time when the German soldiers defeated the French soldiers so utterly for the first time in the history.\n\n[Jewish plight putting aside. Nazi ideology was detrimentally skewed against Jews. Many people still don't know the history behind Jews' expulsion from Israel. It happened because Jews did not want to worship other God. The Jews' resistance to worship the god of Roman Empire was the only reason behind to remove the whole Nation out of their country. And forbidding them to have any other land]. So, IMcRout, some people never learn.\n\nAs to the movie starring with T. Cruise I may say: disgusting.\n\nI still do keep in my memory the song of Feindflug: Rotter Schnee.\n\n[every seven second died a German soldat]\n\nAs to the IMcRout:\n\nThe plight of German solders might have be seen in stark contrast to the words criticizing ChristopherJohnson\n\nWhat a load of bullshit! Sorry for the language, but that is what it is.\n\nYou apparently belong to the ancient elites which supported tyranny.\n\nWe don't need to belong to the ancient elites, because A.H. had been chosen by the \"workers\". The people who worked like in Ford company on assembly line. Erich Maria Remarque had written books about how Germany looked like in the early 1930's.\n\nEven though the leaders of the National Party of German Workers took advantage of the funding from wealthy industrialists, the German Nation in their entirety benefited from it. But again, which political party did not take money from the people who suppoprted them?\n\nSome people never learn.\n\nFor some people loyalty can be bought."
