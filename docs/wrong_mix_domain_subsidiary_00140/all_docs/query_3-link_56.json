        "text": "After 11 years, EA is ready to replace the Origin games distribution software on PC with a brand new platform known simply as the EA app.\n\nOrigin is EA's equivalent of Steam, and even though it has tens of millions of users, EA listened to feedback and acknowledged \"the limitations of this platform in a quickly evolving entertainment landscape.\" The answer to those limitations didn't involve fixing Origin, though, rather EA decided to replace it.\n\nAlthough it was initially going to be called EA Desktop, the Desktop part of the name has been dropped. This week the EA app left its open beta and will now quickly replace Origin on PC. EA says it's \"our fastest and lightest PC client to date,\" and focuses on allowing users to find content quickly combined with automatic game downloads and background updates. Your EA account can also be linked to other platforms (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox) to link up with friends on those services through the app."
