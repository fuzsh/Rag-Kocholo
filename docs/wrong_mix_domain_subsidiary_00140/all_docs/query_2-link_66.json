        "text": "About Arista\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client to cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus and routing environments. Arista’s award-winning platforms deliver availability, agility, automation, analytics and security through an advanced network operating stack\n\nArista was founded by industry luminaries Andy Bechtolsheim, Ken Duda and David Cheriton, launched in 2008 and is led by CEO Jayshree Ullal. Its seasoned leadership team is globally recognized as respected leaders and visionaries with a rich and extensive history in networking and innovation.\n\nThe company went public in June 2014, is listed with NYSE (ANET), and currently has more than 9,000+ cloud customers worldwide.\n\n.The Arista Advantage\n\n.Corporate Profile\n\n.The Arista Way\n\nCustomers\n\nArista has a prestigious set of customers, including Fortune 500 global companies in markets such as cloud titans, enterprise, financials, and specialty cloud service providers. The company delivers products across the data center and campus with routing and software solutions for monitoring and network detection and response worldwide. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Arista has offices around the world.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nIn 2022 Arista acquired Untangle and subsequently launched the next phase of its cognitive campus vision with the introduction of Arista CUE™ (Cognitive Unified Edge). CUE enables commercial customers to accelerate new services and technology innovations by consolidating multiple security and networking functions into an “edge as a service” cloud-managed solution.\n\nIn the second half of 2022, Pluribus Networks was acquired to meet the demands of 4/5G networks and accelerate the delivery of Cloud Unified fabrics with joint partners such as Ericsson.\n\nArista's acquisition of Awake Security (October 2020), a network detection and response (NDR) platform, combines AI with human expertise to autonomously hunt and respond to insider and external threats while providing triage digital forensics and incident responses across campus, data center and IoT.\n\nTo bolster its deep and real-time monitoring and visibility capabilities, Arista acquired Big Switch Networks earlier in 2020. This, along with the company's existing DANZ (Data ANalyZer) capabilities, led to the introduction of DMF (DANZ Monitoring Fabric), a network observability software across Arista switching platforms that gives customers enterprise-wide traffic visibility and contextual insights. The acquisition of Mojo Networks in 2018 provides the company with Wi-Fi solutions for campus and enterprise networks, while Metamako (also in 2018) augments Arista's low-latency platforms.\n\nArista's core technology and these acquisitions have transformed Arista into a data-driven cognitive cloud networking company that delivers its AI value through the network."
