        "text": "In 1989, JMP was launched as a SAS product--one of the many software products developed and sold by the global software giant. As a co-founder of SAS, John Sall had his hands on many important SAS products. But JMP was special to him and where he decided to focus his efforts.\n\nYear after year, JMP got better and better. And the JMP team got bigger and bigger. One product became two, then three, and now four. While, in the early days, it was said that JMP could pretty much sell itself, Sall still had the foresight to set up sales, marketing and other dedicated operations so that JMP could stand alone as a business unit within the safety and security of SAS.\n\nJump to January 1, 2022: After more than 30 years as a business unit, JMP became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAS. As its own company, with a different user base than SAS and different goals for its statistical offerings, JMP is moving in a different direction from SAS. Specifically, JMP is embracing the challenges of analytical practitioners within the science and engineering community.\n\nWe say that great software in the right hands can change the world. We say it because we’ve seen it. We’ve seen scientists and engineers use JMP to advance green energy technologies, speed cancer therapies to market, protect fragile ecosystems with decisive conservation management and build infrared detectors that withstand long journeys into space.\n\nYou get the idea: Advancements are made when brilliant people use JMP to see what they’ve not seen before. But don’t take our word for it.\n\nWith JMP, scientists at Oxford Biomedica saw a tenfold increase in viral vector titer. Lonza doubled yield. Merck saw a 35% increase in efficiency. Johnson Matthey reduced R&D time by 50%. Imperial College London developed and validated a diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 in just 9 weeks.\n\nPolar Semiconductor improved process capability by 35%. Vishay cut data processing time by 83%. And Parker Lord can now do in 20 experiments what used to take more than 1,000. At Kraft, scientists are working both more efficiently and more effectively. So it’s no accident that 16 of the world’s 20 largest consumer goods companies use JMP.\n\nWith JMP, BASF reported a 75% reduction in design time. Dow said “billions and billions” of dollars were saved or generated in annual value. Heliatek saw a 5% increase in yield and DuPont reported “twice the result in half the time.”\n\nDiscoveries made with JMP don’t have to be earth-shattering, lifesaving or record-breaking. They just need to be important to someone. And there’s a good chance someone else can learn from how those discoveries were made. Because of that, JMP invests significantly in platforms and events designed to build a global community of empowered, informed and connected JMP users. Go no further than community.jmp.com to experience information-sharing in action. Or attend a Discovery Summit to see how we put JMP users in the spotlight.\n\nOur purpose is to empower scientists and engineers via our statistical discovery software. That’s pretty straightforward, and it’s never wavered. Sometimes we work directly with the data explorers themselves, sometimes with their companies, and other times with colleges and universities so that the next generation of scientists and engineers will count on JMP by the time they enter the workforce.\n\nAlthough our purpose is clearly connected to our software, it doesn’t end there. As an employer, JMP purposefully creates and maintains a culture of camaraderie that allows the personalities of our diverse and inclusive employee base to shine through. JMP is an equal opportunity employer.\n\nAnd as inhabitants of this planet, we intentionally measure and work to mitigate our impact on the world. Explore our Data for Green program to see how we’re working to empower other organizations to make a difference too.\n\nThe catchphrase “corporate social responsibility” could be used for a lot of what we do for our employees, communities, education and the Earth. But starting with JMP founder John Sall, we just try to do the right thing.\n\nThere are more than 400 of us. We live and work across the Americas, Asia and Europe; our biggest clusters are in the United States, Japan, China, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Germany. R&D is almost entirely located at our Cary, NC, headquarters. That’s where we are.\n\nBut who we are is more interesting. We’re all the things you’d expect in a successful software company...and then some. Yes, we are software engineers, but we’re also mechanical engineers. We’re physicists and playwrights, mathematicians and theologians. We are readers, authors, experimenters and creators. We honor the historical greats while racking up patents for our own inventions and new ways of thinking.\n\nMany of the stereotypes hold true. R&D staff do love superheroes and comic book characters. It’s hard to get business operations people on the dance floor. Creatives are, well, they’re creative. And sales professionals are driven and competitive. Perhaps unexpected is that many in technical sales are enjoying second careers after working as engineers and scientists – these dedicated JMP users bring all kinds of industry knowledge to the team. We are a global and diverse group with unexpected experiences and extraordinary strengths.\n\nWhen we hire, we hire for the long term. Our core values include ensuring that all staff members have meaningful roles, feel connected to JMP users, connected to each other, and are positive about their futures. And our leadership believes in finding the right balance between work and life, knowing that happy and healthy people bring passion and energy to their jobs.\n\nAs a SAS company – and being a part of SAS during our formative years – we know what it feels like to be one of the world’s best companies to work for. And we want every JMP employee to feel that same way.\n\nWould you like to meet the people who lead JMP?"
