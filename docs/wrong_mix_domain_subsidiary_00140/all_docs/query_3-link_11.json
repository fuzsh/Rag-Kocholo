        "text": "EA supports the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) and game ratings.\n\nAs a founding member of the ESRB, we believe in an industry- supported, voluntary rating system. Ratings are designed to provide accurate and objective information about the content in computer and video games so that consumers can make an informed purchase decision. The ESRB is an independent organization which assigns game content ratings, enforces advertising guidelines and helps ensure responsible online privacy practices. EA's computer and video games as well as our marketing materials are submitted to the ESRB for review â€“ each carries an ESRB rating. We strongly support efforts by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the ESRB to educate consumers, parents and retailers on the ESRB rating system. You can find more information about the ESRB at http://www.esrb.org/.\n\nEA supports the Video Game Voters Network (VGVN).\n\nThe Video Game Voters Network (VGVN) is a coalition of voting- aged gamers whose purpose is to educate and mobilize the gamer community in political activities. The VGVN supports legislative efforts to improve the environment for the computer and video game industry and ensure games are treated the same as movies, music, books, and other Constitutionally-protected media. The VGVN enables gamers to stay updated on game industry issues, register to vote, and to take action by contacting federal, state, and local officials to express their views\n\nFor more information about the Video Game Voters Network and how to join its grassroots mobilization effort, please visit http://www.videogamevoters.org."
