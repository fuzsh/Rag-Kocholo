        "text": "My account has been banned for no reason, they told me they don't have to give me an explanation, so they won't.\n\nI have been playing the sims 4 on origin for about 8 years, with no problem at all. After it got ported to EA, I have not been doing anything differently. Honestly, I have barely been playing at all. Yet EA decided that I was breaking their policy and banned my account. Firstly, my account's password has been changed without my permission or even informing me! I thought I was hacked, could not reach any help for months. Finally when I managed to get access to my account back, I found out my account has been banned from using online features and most importantly, bying new games. I've bought expansion pack six months ago and I'm still not able to use it!!! I've appealed a few times but they told me that they will uphold the bann since I broke their policy. I asked them how did I break their policy, as I've been doing everything the exact same way as for the last 8 years. They insolently wrote me that they do not have the obligation to tell me what I did wrong, therefore they will not. Not only that, they outright told me that since now they will not answear any of my emails anymore, because they don't have to, and to stop writing them. Ridiculous and unbelivable!!! If you value your money NEVER BUY ANY GAMES ON EA! Your account can be blocked for no reason, with no explanation, just because they can.\n\nDate of experience : December 25, 2023\n\nWon't tell me why my account is banned\n\nMy account got banned due to \"Violation of their Terms of Sale\" – although I didn't do anything but download the free Sims 4 game as well as a free kit they offered.\n\nI tried appealing but only received an email stating that they will uphold the ban. I have no idea what I did wrong and how to avoid a ban on the same grounds in the future.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't want to risk opening a new account to play Sims and buy the expansion packs I have been planning on purchasing as I cannot be sure that the next account won't be blocked by my totally normal behaviour. -.-\n\nEA is a joke.\n\nDate of experience : June 11, 2024\n\nI wish I could just login to my…\n\nI wish I could just login to my Playstation 4, and play online Madden 23 with the money I spend every month on having online features. Unfortunately, EA has made sure that it is extremely difficult to make changes to email address's linked to your platform. I have an old email account that is no longer used, and the only way I can link my account to my PS4 is by using an email I don't have access too anymore. I can't wait to hear the day EA goes bankrupt, and loses everything they worked so hard to ruin overtime.\n\nDate of experience : July 06, 2024\n\nEA is completely delusional\n\nEA is completely delusional\n\nWhere is the search bar in the EA app on macbook? Where is the search bar for all games on the website? How do i view all expansion packs of any game instead of categorized suggestions presented in an arbitrary way? Where are the filter options?\n\nWhy do I not get a hit if I type 'live customer support/chat' in the search bar on the EA help website?\n\nWhy do I not get any helpful hits on google if I try to find a way to contact EA?\n\nWhy did you guys put in so much effort to make it so difficult for people to use you product?\n\nDate of experience : July 01, 2024\n\nLess than 1\n\nLess than 1. They stole money. I called and cancelled a subscription I didn't even know I had before the subscription renewal date and they still took my money. I spoke to them before the money reached their account and was assured I'd be refunded. Then today I was told I wouldn't with a message that didn't make sense, I mean the English didn't make any sense. The agent couldn't explain what they meant. Couldn't pass me to a manager. Couldn't get someone to call me. Couldn't offer anything else. Couldn't send a transcript of the conversation. Bunch of thieves. Worst company ever\n\nDate of experience : July 01, 2024\n\nA glitch a day\n\nThere are so many glitches in this game. Customer service is beyond horrendous. Scores for friends are showing wrong so I submitted a ticket……they responded that they cannot discuss my friends scores. I WAS NOT ASKING THEM TO DISCUSS THEIR SCORES WITH ME. I was asking them to FIX THE GLITCH! What is the point of showing everyone’s scores that you are friends with if they are inaccurate? I know they are not correct because I see many of them as top designers with a 4.98 but in my feed it shows 4.88. This company is horrible. The customer service is a joke.\n\nDate of experience : July 02, 2024"
