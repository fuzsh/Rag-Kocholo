        "text": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nA subsidiary is any organization that belongs to a parent or holding company. Learn how to form a subsidiary and the benefits it offers.\n\nThe term subsidiary company refers to a separate entity that exists under the umbrella of another corporation, called a parent or holding company. Subsidiary companies typically operate on their own while still benefiting from the resources provided by their parent company.\n\nSubsidiary companies have their own board of directors, which includes executive director representatives from the holding company. Read on to learn more about the benefits of a subsidiary company and how to form one.\n\nWhat Is a Subsidiary Company?\n\nA subsidiary company, or a separate legal entity that has been formed by a parent or holding company, could be related to its parent company or in a separate field.\n\nSubsidiaries are often established as part of a business strategy that involves diversification. The parent company may create subsidiaries for different areas of interest, so it can invest in them without spreading itself too thinly across multiple industries.\n\nA board of directors might consider starting a subsidiary company when they want to expand into new markets or industries, but don’t want to risk losing control over their core business. A subsidiary can provide its parent organization with valuable insight into how to operate in new markets and industries without taking on too much risk itself.\n\nBenefits of a Subsidiary Company\n\nA subsidiary is usually formed as a limited liability company (LLC). This means the business owners of the subsidiary have limited liability for any debts and obligations of the subsidiary.\n\nSome benefits of creating a subsidiary company include:\n\nAbility to invest in multiple companies without setting up separate accounts for each investment.\n\nNo limits on capital contributions from the parent company or the ability for employees to receive bonuses and benefits from the parent company.\n\nIncreased flexibility in running your business operations and increased liability protection.\n\nParent company expands its reach and profits while reducing risk.\n\nBetter tax deductions.\n\nExamples of Subsidiary Companies\n\nA subsidiary company can be a corporation, LLC, or nonprofit. Examples of subsidiary companies include Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and YouTube, which is owned by Google.\n\nHow to Form a Subsidiary Company\n\nFollow these 3 steps to form a subsidiary company. Note, the subsidiary and parent company will be separate legal entities.\n\n1. Complete Articles of Organization\n\nWhen forming a subsidiary company, you must create and file Articles of Organization with your Secretary of State ‘s office. The Articles of Organization provide the legal foundation for your subsidiary company, and must include the subsidiary’s:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPurpose\n\nDirectors\n\nRegistered agent\n\nGoverning law\n\n2. Apply for City or County Permits\n\nDepending on what type of work your subsidiary company does, it may need certain licenses or permits in order to operate legally within the jurisdiction where it’s based. Your subsidiary’s officers might be required to obtain an occupational license or contractor’s license from their local government office if they intend to sell products or services directly to consumers.\n\n3. Submit Business Application\n\nLastly, you’ll need to fill out and submit the appropriate application forms to the state where you want to incorporate your business. For example, if you want to incorporate in North Carolina, you might submit forms NC-100 and NC-20 to the North Carolina Secretary of State’s office.\n\nThis will likely be referred to as an Articles of Incorporation form, which includes basic information such as the business name, what it intends to do, the address where the business will operate from, and information about the business owners.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, you’ll need to register the new business with the appropriate government agencies, such as the IRS.\n\nMaster Corporate Governance With OnBoard\n\nWhile creating a subsidiary company offers many benefits, it’s a complicated process that requires best-in-class governance tools and legal assistance.
