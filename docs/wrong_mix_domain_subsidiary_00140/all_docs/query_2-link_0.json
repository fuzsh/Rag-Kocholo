        "text": "American financial software company\n\nThis article is about the software company. For other uses, see Intuit (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Inuit.\n\nIntuit Inc. is an American multinational business software company that specializes in financial software. The company is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and the CEO is Sasan Goodarzi. Intuit's products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring and personal accounting service Credit Karma,[2] and email marketing platform Mailchimp.[3] As of 2019, more than 95% of its revenues and earnings come from its activities within the United States.[4]\n\nIntuit offered a free online service called TurboTax Free File as well as a similarly named service called TurboTax Free Edition which is not free for most users.[5][6] In 2019, investigations by ProPublica found that Intuit deliberately steered taxpayers from the free TurboTax Free File to the paid TurboTax Free Edition using tactics including search engine delisting and a deceptive discount targeted to members of the military.[7][8] As of the 2021 tax filing season, TurboTax no longer participates in the Free File Alliance.[9]\n\nIntuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms, which is the norm in developed countries.[10][11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded in 1983 by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx in Palo Alto, California.[12][13][14][15]\n\nIntuit was conceived by Scott Cook, whose prior work at Procter & Gamble helped him realize that personal computers would lend themselves towards replacements for paper-and-pencil based personal accounting.[16] On his quest to find a programmer, he ended up running into Tom Proulx at Stanford University. The two started Intuit, which initially operated out of a modest room on University Avenue in Palo Alto. The first version of Quicken was coded in Microsoft's BASIC programming language for the IBM PC and UCSD Pascal for the Apple II by Tom Proulx and had to contend with a dozen serious competitors.\n\nIn 1991, Microsoft decided to produce a competitor to Quicken called Microsoft Money. To win retailers' loyalty, Intuit included a US$15 rebate coupon, redeemable on software customers purchased in their stores. This was the first time a software company offered a rebate.[17][18][19]\n\nRoughly around the same time the company engaged John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and diversified its product lineup. In 1993 Intuit went public and used the proceeds to make a key acquisition: the tax-preparation software company Chipsoft based in San Diego.[20] The time after the IPO was marked by rapid growth and culminated with a buyout offer from Microsoft in 1994; at this time Intuit's market capitalization reached US$2 billion.[21] However, the United States Department of Justice sued to block the acquisition.[22][23]\n\nThe company came under intense pressure in the late 1990s when Microsoft started to compete vigorously with its core Quicken business.[18][23] In response, Intuit launched new web-based products and put more emphasis on QuickBooks and on TurboTax. The company made a number of investments around this time. Among others, it purchased a large stake in Excite[24] and acquired Lacerte Software, a Dallas-based developer of tax preparation software used by tax professionals. [25] It also divested its online bill payment service unit in exchange for an equity stake in CheckFree.[26]\n\nIn June 2013, Intuit announced it would sell its financial services unit to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $1.03 billion.[27]\n\nAs of May 2018, Intuit had more than US$5 billion in annual revenue and a market capitalization of about US$50 billion.[citation needed] In August 2018, the company announced that Sasan Goodarzi would become Intuit's leader and CEO at the beginning of 2019. Previous CEO Brad Smith will remain chairman of Intuit's board of directors.[28][29] In August 2020, Intuit QuickBooks Canada was expected to reveal intentions to partner with Digital Main Street, as the company aims to help digitally turn Canadian small businesses.[30]\n\nIn July 2024, Intuit announced it would lay off 1,800 employees, or 10% of its workforce, in order to refocus resources on generative AI initiatives.[31]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIntuit formerly offered a free online service called TurboTax Free File as well as a similarly named service called TurboTax Free Edition which is not free for most users.[5][6][7][8] TurboTax Free File was developed as part of an agreement whereby members of the Free File Alliance would offer tax preparation for individuals below an income threshold for free in exchange for the IRS not providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms.[5][6] In 2019, investigations by ProPublica found that Intuit deliberately steered taxpayers from the free TurboTax Free File to the paid TurboTax Free Edition using tactics including search engine delisting and a deceptive discount targeted to members of the military.[7][8] Subsequent investigations by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the New York State Department of Financial Services reached similar conclusions, the latter concluding that Intuit engaged in \"unfair and abusive practices\".[32][33][34][35] As of 2022, Intuit is the subject of multiple lawsuits and is under investigation by the FTC and several state attorneys general.[36][37] On May 4, 2022, Intuit agreed to pay a $141 million settlement over misleading advertisements.[38]\n\nCurrent products\n\n[edit]\n\nCEO Sasan Goodarzi oversees all products in all countries.\n\nTurboTax\n\nOffered in Basic, Standard, Premier, and Home & Business versions, as well as TurboTax 20 for preparing multiple returns.[39]\n\nQuickBooks\n\nSmall business accounting and financial management software, offered in EasyStart, Pro, and Premier versions.\n\nQuickBooks Online\n\nWeb-based accounting software designed for companies to review business financials through live data and insights to help make clear business decisions.\n\nProConnect\n\nProfessional tax products, including ProConnect Tax Online, Lacerte, ProSeries Professional, ProSeries Basic, and EasyAcct.\n\nCredit Karma\n\nAccess to credit scores, reports, and monitoring.

(which includes the SaverLife Solutions platform[43])\n\nMailchimp\n\nE-mail marketing platform.\n\nInternational operations\n\n[edit]\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nIntuit Canada ULC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Intuit, is a developer of financial management and tax preparation software for personal finance and small business accounting. Services are delivered on a variety of platforms including application software, software connected to services, software as a service, platform as a service and mobile applications. Intuit Canada has employees located all across Canada, with offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIntuit Canada traces its origins to the 1993 acquisition by Intuit of a Canadian tax preparation software developer. In 1992, Edmontonians and University of Alberta graduates Bruce Johnson and Chad Frederick had built a tax preparation product called WINTAX – Canada's first[citation needed] Microsoft Windows-based personal tax preparation software. In 1993, they agreed to be acquired by Chipsoft, manufacturer of the U.S. personal income tax software TurboTax. Shortly after the WINTAX acquisition, Chipsoft agreed to merge with Intuit, the developer of the Quicken financial software.[44] Intuit Canada continued to update and support the WINTAX software, which was renamed QuickTax in 1995 and then renamed TurboTax in 2010. Intuit Canada quickly became the hub for international development at Intuit, producing localized versions of Quicken and QuickBooks for Canada (in French and English) and the United Kingdom. The U.K. version of Quicken was discontinued in 2005.[45]\n\nCurrent products of Intuit Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nTurboTax (formerly QuickTax) – offered in Basic, Standard, Premier, and Home & Business versions, as well as TurboTax 20 for preparing multiple returns.[39]\n\nTurboImpôt (formerly ImpôtRapide) – French-language version of TurboTax – offered in de base, de luxe, premier and particuliers et entreprises versions.\n\nTurboTax online – Online versions of Free, Student, Standard, Premier and Home & Business.\n\nTurboImpôt en ligne (formerly ImpôtRapide en ligne) – Online versions of TurboImpôt gratuit, étudiant, de luxe, premier and particuliers et entreprises.\n\nSnapTax – an iPhone app that allows users to complete their income tax return on their iPhone\n\nTurboTax Refund Calculator – an iPad app that estimates tax returns and illustrates how changes, such as having a baby, can impact your income tax return\n\nQuickBooks – Small business accounting and financial management software, offered in EasyStart, Pro and Premier versions.\n\nQuickBooks Payroll Solutions – extends QuickBooks Pro and Premier into an in-house payroll solution.[buzzword]\n\nIntuit Merchant Service for QuickBooks – lets you process credit and debit transactions directly in any version of QuickBooks.\n\nQuickBooks Enterprise Solutions – for midsized companies that require more capacity, functionality and support than is offered by traditional small business accounting software; includes QuickBooks Payroll.\n\nQuickBooks Online – an online small business accounting and financial management solution[buzzword], offered in EasyStart, Essentials, and Plus versions.\n\nIntuit GoPayment – process and receive payments on the go through your mobile device.\n\nQuickBooks Succès PME – French-language version of QuickBooks, offered in Succès PME, Succès PME Pro, and Succès PME Premier versions\n\nQuickBooks Succès PME Service de paie – French-language version of the Payroll Solutions\n\nProFile Basic and Premier Editions – Professional Tax Preparation Packages\n\nDiscontinued products of Intuit Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxWiz – Tax preparation software – the company purchased in 2002, discontinued in 2007.[46]\n\nWillExpert – A software package for preparing personal wills (for use within all of Canada with the exception of Quebec, due to specific provincial legislation).\n\nIn 2008, Intuit Canada discontinued the TaxWiz software and added QuickTax Basic to their lineup. Changes made by the Canada Revenue Agency forced Intuit and other tax preparing software companies to limit the number of returns available from their software to 20. This caused Intuit Canada to stop offering QuickTax Pro50 and Pro100 products, and they now offer QuickTax 20 as an alternative. Intuit Canada has since announced that for the 2010 tax year, they will discontinue use of the name QuickTax and replace it with the name TurboTax – thus bringing the product in line with Intuit's American tax-filing software.[47]\n\nOnline communities\n\n[edit]\n\nIntuit has had several online communities, some of which offer integration or cross-sells into its other products. These include the QuickBooks and TurboTax online communities for QuickBooks users and small business owners and tax payers respectively, Quicken Online Community for Quicken users and those who need help with the personal finances, and the Accountant Online Community and Jump Up. These communities have consisted of blogs, an expert locator map and event calendar, forums and discussion groups, podcasts, videocasts and webinars, and other user-created content.[48]\n\nJumpUp (formerly JackRabbit Beta) was a free social networking and resources site for small business owners and/or start-ups. Free tools and services included an interactive business planner, online training for developing a successful business plan, starting costs calculator, cash flow calculator, break-even calculator, templates for business planning and sample business plans.[citation needed]\n\nTaxAlmanac was a free online tax research resource. The site included information including the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, Tax Court Cases, and a variety of articles. This site was up for closure but due to massive feedback, has reminded up. It has however been archived since June 2014, meaning the existing content can be accessed and viewed but no new posts or comments can be made after this archival.[49]\n\nModeled after English Wikipedia, TaxAlmanac was launched in May 2005. The June 6, 2005 edition of Time magazine featured an article entitled \"It's a Wiki, Wiki World\"[50] about English Wikipedia in which TaxAlmanac was highlighted as \"A Community of Customers\". The November 21, 2005 edition of Business Week[51] featured an article titled \"50 Smart Ways to Use the Web\" in which TaxAlmanac was selected as one of the 50. The product made the short list as one of the 7 in the collaboration category. Intuit archives TaxAlmanac effective June 1, 2014.[52] Many of the users have migrated to a new site called TaxProTalk.com.[53]\n\nZipingo was a free website where users could rate services such as contractors, restaurants, and other businesses. Ratings and comments were either entered from the website or through Quicken and QuickBooks. The site was closed by Intuit on August 23, 2007.[54]\n\nFinances\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Intuit reported earnings of US$2.062 billion, with an annual revenue of US$9.633 billion, an increase of 25.4% over the previous fiscal cycle. Intuit's shares traded at over $498.18 per share and total international net revenue was less than 5% of total net revenue.\n\nYear Revenue\n\nin mil. USD$ Net income\n\nin mil.

[118][119]\n\nLobbying\n\n[edit]\n\nIntuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms, as is the norm in developed countries.[10][11][120]\n\nIn 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that Intuit spent nearly $2 million in political contributions to eliminate free online state tax filing for low-income residents in California.[121] According to the New York Times, from 2009 to 2014, Intuit spent nearly $13 million lobbying, as reported by OpenSecrets, as much as Apple. Intuit spent $1 million on the race for the California state comptroller to support Tony Strickland, a Republican who opposed ReadyReturn, against John Chiang, a Democrat who supported ReadyRun (and won). Joseph Bankman, professor of tax law, Stanford Law School, and advocate of simplified filing, believes that the campaign warned politicians that if they supported free filing, Intuit would help their opponents.[122][123]\n\nOn March 26, 2013, ProPublica reported that the company lobbied against return-free filing as recently as 2011.[11] One year later, ProPublica reported that the company appeared to be linked to a number of op-eds and letters to Congress in a campaign advocating against direct tax filing backed by the Computer & Communications Industry Association, an advocacy organization of which Intuit is a member.[124]\n\nIn October 2019, Propublica reported again that Intuit used \"lobbying, the revolving door and dark pattern customer tricks\" to fend off the US government's attempts to make tax filing free and easy, and created its multi-billion-dollar franchise.[125]\n\nLawsuits\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation\n\nAn antitrust lawsuit[non-primary source needed] and a class-action suit relating to cold calling employees of other companies were settled out of court along with Apple and Google.[126]\n\nIn March 2015, The Washington Post and computer reporter Brian Krebs reported that two former employees alleged that Intuit knowingly allowed fraudulent returns to be processed on a massive scale as part of a revenue-boosting scheme. Both employees, former security team members for the company, stated that the company had ignored repeated warnings and suggestions on how to prevent fraud. One of the employees was reported to have filed a whistleblower complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.[127][128]\n\nFTC Lawsuit Over Intuit's 'Free' Tax Filing Claims - pending\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken legal action against Intuit Inc., the maker of TurboTax software, for deceptive advertising practices.
