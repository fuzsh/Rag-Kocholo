So we set out to build EA’s next-generation PC game platform - a faster, more reliable, and more streamlined gaming experience - the best possible place for you to experience EA’s incredible games, services and content.\n\nToday, we’re thrilled to announce that the EA app has officially left its open beta phase and will soon replace Origin as our primary PC platform. The EA app is our fastest and lightest PC client to date. With the new streamlined design you will easily find the games and content you’re looking for and discover your new favorite games. With automatic game downloads and background updates you can ensure that your games are ready to play when you are.\n\nYou will also be able to build your ultimate friends list by connecting your EA account to other platforms and services like Steam, Xbox and PlayStation. You’ll be easily recognizable with your custom unique ID. Once you're connected, know what and when your friends are playing so you can jump in and play together.\n\nFor our Origin players, we’ve worked hard to make the transition to the EA app as simple as possible. We will be inviting you to make the move soon, and by the time you receive your invite, all your games and content, including games previously installed, will be ready and waiting for you on the EA app. Your local and cloud saves will transfer forward ensuring you can pick up where you left off. Your friends list transfers, too, so you won’t have to worry about remembering all those player IDs.\n\nThe EA app is now available for supported Windows PCs. MacOS players - Origin for Mac continues to be the place you can access your games.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the EA app!"
