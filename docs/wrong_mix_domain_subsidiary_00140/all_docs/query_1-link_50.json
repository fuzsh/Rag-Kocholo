Students are incentivized to take 15-18 hours in the fall and spring semesters, getting charged the same rate whether they pursue 12-18 hours. To graduate within four years, undergraduates typically need to take 30 hours per academic year. In addition to saving time and money, research shows that students who take 15 hours per semester have higher academic performance, higher retention rates and increased graduation rates.\n\nNote: Tuition cost does not include possible program/course fees.
