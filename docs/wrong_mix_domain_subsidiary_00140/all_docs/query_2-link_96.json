        "text": "Since 2018, the Lacoste Group has sought to offer all of its employees a unified and digitalized HR experience. Thanks to the Cegid Talentsoft solution, we can take a giant step forward in our plan and achieve our objectives.\n\nA major advantage of Cegid Retail is that we have a single solution that's live in the 35 countries where we operate. It helps us comply with local regulations and implement common practices and processes across the group. It's also essential in that it ensures compliance with the L’Oréal Group's best practices and guidelines.\n\nAt JCDecaux, we're interested in having peace of mind when using applications, and this is something we've achieved with Cegid. We've been able to take advantage of the platform without the problems that can be common in information technology. We get an impeccable level of support and what I like is that we also have this proactivity in terms of announcing the changes that need to be made\n\nYou can't succeed without information and the investment we made in information systems allows us to have refined information in our ERP and that also naturally contributes to our company’s success.\n\nThe software helps us a lot in running our company daily. Instead of spending two hours working our accounting, in 20 or 30 minutes we can post 50 to 60 documents, which frees up time for what is essential."
