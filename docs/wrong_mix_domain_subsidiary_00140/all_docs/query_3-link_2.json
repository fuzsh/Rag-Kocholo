        "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat is the EA app?\n\nThe EA app for Windows is Electronic Arts’ all-new, enhanced platform, where you can easily play your favorite games. The app provides a streamlined and optimized user interface that gets you into your games faster than ever before.\n\nWho can download the EA app?\n\nThe EA app for Windows is available to all players on a (minimum) 64-bit PC system, running Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11. The EA app for Mac is available to players on macOS Catalina or newer.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the EA app and Origin?\n\nThe EA app is our latest platform. Origin for Mac continues to serve players on macOS Mojave and older.\n\nHas the EA app replaced Origin on PC and Mac?\n\nFor Windows, yes, the EA app has replaced Origin. For macOS, we'll be supporting the EA app as our primary gaming destination, but Origin for Mac will continue to be available for Mac players on macOS Mojave and older.\n\nI’ve been asked to download the EA app, what should I expect?\n\nWhen you accept the invitation, the EA app download process will begin. Origin will be uninstalled automatically once the EA app launches — this ensures you will not experience any conflicts or errors related to having both clients installed on your computer simultaneously. Once you complete the process, your games and content will be ready for play.\n\nWhat will happen to the games I currently own on Origin for Mac?\n\nGames you’ve purchased will automatically transfer over. Contact us if anything appears to be missing from your library.\n\nWill I have to re-download my Origin games on the EA app?\n\nNo. The games you’ve downloaded through Origin should be ready to launch through the EA app. If you find any of your games, DLC or other content missing from the EA app, please contact us so we can help resolve the issue.\n\nHow do I log in to the EA app?\n\nYour EA Account is what you use today to log into Origin - just use the same credentials to log in to the EA app.\n\nWhat will happen to my data, purchases, and friends list?\n\nYour information (achievements, friends list, cloud data, purchases, in-game hours, & more) carries over when you log in to the EA app.\n\nIf I play my EA games on Steam or Epic, do I need to download the EA app?\n\nThe EA app is required in order to play EA games on PC. When you launch an EA title on Steam or Epic, we’ll provide guidance for installing the EA app (and uninstalling Origin if applicable) to ensure you can access & play your EA games."
