Subsequently, DHCD will continue its focus on reviewing and processing remaining applications to ensure that it has the funding needed for the open/pending applications that still need to be processed for payment while also targeting those tenant households at immediate risk of housing instability.\n\nTenant households with active court-filed eviction cases and in possession of a court summons, court judgment, or warrant of restitution will still be able to apply for ERAP by clicking on the Begin a New Application link above to apply and submit a copy of your court summons, judgment, or warrant of restitution.\n\nFor additional questions, tenant households should call the ERAP Call Center on (301) 883-6504, option 9. The ERAP Call Center customer service representative will instruct the tenant on next steps. ERAP tenant households applying for ERAP assistance must read and listen to all instructions prior to completing the ERAP application. DHCD will screen applications received and those without the required court-filed eviction documentation will not be reviewed.\n\nWorking with our community service providers, DHCD will ensure that the remaining ERAP funds will be used to assist tenant households with eligible pending applications submitted prior to May 1, 2024, and those facing active court-ordered evictions. Low-income households at or below 50% of the area median income (AMI) facing eviction will continue to be prioritized. Applicants will be contacted by their assigned reviewers to finalize all necessary information needed for reviewing an ERAP application.\n\nThe submission of an ERAP application does not guarantee approval for ERAP assistance. Along with their application, tenant households at or below 30% AMI must submit at least a court summons. Tenant households at or between 31% to 80% AMI, must submit at least a court judgment.\n\nAll applications are carefully reviewed, validated, and subject to federal eligibility requirements.
