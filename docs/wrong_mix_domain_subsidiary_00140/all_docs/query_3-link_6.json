        "text": "Our tools. Your rules. Battlefield™ Portal is a love letter to the most long-standing fans of the franchise. Experience the nostalgia of past Battlefield games, combined with the cutting-edge tech of Battlefield 2042 in fights where anything can happen.\n\nCHANGE THE RULES OF WAR\n\nBattlefield Portal is a platform where you will discover unexpected battles and change the rules of war. Countless experiences from several Battlefield sandboxes await – not only from Battlefield 2042, but the classics Battlefield 1942, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3, too. Take on custom-made modes or create your own unique experience using powerful builder tools.\n\nYOUR SANDBOX, YOUR RULES\n\nImagine the assault rifles and helis of Battlefield 2042 on the Battlefield 1942 map Battle of the Bulge. Or perhaps a knife vs. defib fight on Caspian Border? Battlefield™ Portal's inclusion of classic Battlefield universes opens up hugely creative gameplay opportunities. All of the cutting-edge gear and vast maps of Battlefield 2042 can be brought into Battlefield™ Portal, which allows you to wreak havoc in exciting new ways.\n\nTHE MAPS\n\nWe're bringing back fan-favorite maps and providing them with modern, hi-def quality. Classic battlefields have been rebuilt from the ground up using the latest version of the Frostbite engine. The iconic maps Arica Harbor, El Alamein, Battle of the Bulge, Valparaiso, Caspian Border, and Noshahr Canals will feel brand new thanks to their striking, reworked visuals and destructive effects.\n\nTHE ARSENAL\n\nYou have the freedom to decide what cutting-edge arsenal of weapons, equipment, and vehicles you'll use to win the day. Special care has been taken to let you balance weapons and vehicles as you see fit. For instance, modern guns don't necessarily have to be stronger than WW2 weapons."
