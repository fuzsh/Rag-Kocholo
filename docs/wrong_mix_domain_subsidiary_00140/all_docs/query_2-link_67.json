        "text": "Arno Beckhoff expanded the electrical trade segment and today employs more than 1015 electricians in 12 locations. The business, which operates under the traditional Elektro Beckhoff GmbH name to this day, installs electrical systems for industrial companies, residential buildings, hospitals, hotels, and public facilities. Whether a project involves building automation, data networking, solar panels, fire alarm systems, or switchgear stations â Elektro Beckhoff stands ready to provide the appropriate solution as one of the largest providers in its field in Germany today.\n\nMarlies Hillen (nÃ©e Beckhoff) and Michael Beckhoff continued to expand the electrical retail business. Today, their Beckhoff Technik und Design GmbH with its roughly 80 employees offers at its two locations in Verl and Bielefeld everything that the company name stands for: technology that excites and is useful, and design that surprises and is attractive. Besides consumer goods, the company offers with its departments for professional lighting design and media engineering deep-reaching expertise for residential, industrial, and functional building applications. Beckhoff Technik und Design is one of the largest family-managed electrical retail businesses in Germany today.\n\nBy 2005 each of the three business segments had become so large that the four siblings decided to split them into individual, legally separate enterprises. To maintain the family relationship, however, each branch of the family continues to hold a minority interest in the other sister companies. And since the Beckhoff siblings and their offspring place great value in maintaining their family ties, all three Beckhoff companies consider themselves to be members of the Beckhoff Family Group.\n\nThe core company of the Beckhoff Automation Group has over 5,500 employees (March 2024), including more than 650 developers and product managers who work on new products and concepts. Building on this foundation of knowledge and experience, Beckhoff has been able to successfully introduce important revolutionary concepts in automation technology over the course of the company's 44-year history, in addition to many evolutionary advances. Examples include:\n\nPC-Control: PC-based control technology\n\nBus Terminal I/Os: Industrial I/O components in terminal block format\n\nEtherCAT: Simple, ultra-fast, and time-deterministic Ethernet-based industrial communication\n\nTwinSAFE: Safe communication in unsafe environments\n\nControl Panels: IPCs and displays in aluminum housings milled from a solid block\n\nOCT drive technology: One Cable Technology that integrates power and feedback in a single motor cable\n\nXTS: eXtended Transportation System â a highly dynamic linear multi-mover drive system\n\nXPlanar: Floating, contactless multi-mover 2D drive system\n\nMX-System: control cabinet-free automation\n\nVision: Hardware for machine vision\n\nBeckhoff Automation stands for technology and responsibility. The company advances automation technology for the benefit of its customers as well as society in general. The basis for this lies in Beckhoffâs trustful and long-term cooperative relationships with its customers. The company operates based on the philosophy that it can achieve progress in technology only by working closely with its customers.\n\nAnd the deep integration of Smyczek into the Beckhoff value chain ensures the best possible coordination between production and development as well as a high degree of flexibility to meet all customer requirements.\n\nIn addition to Beckhoff, Smyczek counts many long-standing external industrial companies among its customers. The company even also offers device assembly and inspection services to this segment.\n\nWith Smyczek, Beckhoff has its primary manufacturing operations in-house and can offer its customers the highest quality standards.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe two young startup entrepreneurs got to know each other by chance and decided to work together. In the spring of 1981, Beckhoff delivered the first machine controller to Schirmer and has functioned as the companyâs outsourced electronics software department ever since. The resulting close cooperation between their mechanical engineering and control technology activities has been the basis of both companiesâ success.\n\nThrough its cooperation with Schirmer, Beckhoff Automation was able to implement complex control requirements at an early stage. Examples include multi-axis machines, integration of CNC and standard axis functions, high number of I/O components, fast response times, part tracking, single-piece production with dynamic tool adjustments, data coupling to IT, etc. Features like these became the basis of the general Beckhoff control technology and could be transferred to many other industries. Schirmer was also Beckhoffâs largest customer in the first decade of its existence.\n\nIn 2016, Beckhoff had the opportunity to acquire Schirmer Maschinenbau. The relationship between the two entities has become even closer as a result. Beckhoff views Schirmer as its lead customer within the Group with whom new automation technologies can be implemented and tested in close cooperation.\n\nSchirmer Maschinenbau and Beckhoff Automation â a 44-year story of success!\n\nLearn more"
