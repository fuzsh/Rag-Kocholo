The issuer / publisher is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Westend ICT Plc Press Release August 29, 2008 15:15 Finnish time WESTEND ICT PLC'S SUBSIDIARY DOCUMENTA OY SIGNS A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH NORWEGIAN SOFTWARE INNOVATION ASA Documenta Oy, which is a subsidiary fully owned by Westend ICT Plc, and the Norwegian company Software Innovation ASA have signed a cooperation agreement concerning the representation and retail of Software Innovation ASA's 360 document and workflow management system in Finland. This agreement significantly strengthens Documenta's offering and improves the company's competitiveness in public administration and especially in the corporate sector. The Software Innovation product, 360Â°, is an advanced modular system, which combines under information management not only workflow and document management, but also projects, processes and interest group relationships.
