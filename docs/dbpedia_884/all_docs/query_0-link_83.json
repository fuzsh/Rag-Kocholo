        "text": "Representatives of companies Belgrade Waterfront and Pizzarotti have signed an agreement on the execution of main works on the Belgrade Tower, the tallest building in Serbia. The 40-story building will be the central part of Belgrade Waterfront, and the topmost floor will feature the tallest lookout in Belgrade. The main works are to start in December.\n\nPizzarotti is one of the most important Italian companies in the construction sector, which is becoming a leader in the international market when it comes to large and complex construction projects, as well as large infrastructural projects. Among the company's most important projects are Portonovi Resort Montenegro, as well as skyscrapers Marriott AC Hotel, 1 Seaport and 45 Broad Street in New York. Projects such as these, similar in size and complexity to the Belgrade Tower, carried out in the USA, Australia and Monaco, among other places, recommend Pizzarotti for the job they have been entrusted with.\n\n– Decades of expertise and knowledge that Pizzarotti brings will be of great importance for the construction of this monumental building. I am very happy that we have a world-class partner, which arrives to Serbia after many successful projects carried out all over the world in order to help us achieve an important goal – to build a unique facility which will make Belgrade an even more attractive destination – Nikola Nedeljkovic, CEO of Belgrade Front, said at the signing.\n\nCombining residential, commercial, hotel and hospitality features, the Belgrade Tower will provide a unique space surrounded by a public square ideal for various activities and events.\n\n– We are extremely proud and grateful for the opportunity that has been given to us. With the support of Millennium Team, a local company which is already successfully cooperating with BW, as well as Roberts Constructions, a leading company for the construction of skyscrapers, we will build the tallest and one of the most important and beautiful buildings in Serbia, the Belgrade Tower. Pizzarotti has operated for more than 100 years in over 20 countries on all continents. We will use all our international expertise in order to build this remarkable facility and create a true masterpiece – said Marco Faroldi, a representative of Pizzarotti.\n\nHaving recognized the importance and the potential of this building, Marriott International chose the Belgrade Tower as the home of its exclusive St. Regis brand, which will open its seventh hotel in Europe here. The Residences at The St. Regis Belgrade, luxury brand apartments, will also be located in the Belgrade Tower.\n\nThe Belgrade Tower was designed by the world-renowned company SOM, and the project is being developed by AECOM. Belgrade's position at the confluence of two large rivers, as well as Serbia's historical and cultural heritage, inspired the architects in designing this monumental building."
