        "text": "Pitti roofing consists of three families of elements: primary beams with an I- and H-section, secondary beams with V-section, which allow for obtain spans in excess of 30 m, and flat tertiary elements for completion in C.A.V. (slabs). This roof presents a sub-horizontal trend and is walkable. All elements of this system have resistance to fire up to R 180â€². This type of roofing allows the illumination of the rooms below with indirect (sheds) and direct light (zenithal skylights). By appropriately arranging the tertiary elements on the tiles, it is possible to realize zenithal skylights or shed skylights depending on the required aeroilluminant ratios, while creating walkable paths useful for facilitate roof maintenance operations. In addition, the back of the shed lends itself to the installation of photovoltaic systems.\n\nWATER OUTSIDE SYSTEM\n\nRainwater is collected on the V secondary elements (Pitti tile) and thanks to an appropriate system of structural slopes is conveyed inside the gutter beams and disposed along the perimeter of the building.\n\nThe waterproofing and insulation of the Pitti tile is the result of a careful and detailed design that took into account the following aspects:\n\nstructural movements\n\ndimensional stability of products\n\ncompatibility between different materials used\n\nresistance to compression during pedestrian maintenance\n\nsystem flexibility and variability\n\nresistance to solar radiation\n\nsystem durability over time\n\neasy maintenance.\n\nAll this allowed to make the right choice of materials from use, to arrive at the definition of their correct laying system, thus obtaining a system of insulation and waterproofing equipped of great reliability over time.\n\nLightweight and very versatile system with harmonious and essential lines, which gives interior spaces feelings of extreme cleanliness and elegance. In this case the concrete tertiary element is replaced by a curved or straight sandwich panel. This cover also allows to illuminate the rooms below with indirect (sheds) and direct light (skylights zenithal).\n\nTertiary elements are composed of metal sandwich panels consisting of by an outer support of pre-painted galvanized sheet metal with a corrugated profile, intermediate layer of high-density polyurethane and inner support of pre-painted galvanized sheet metal with slatted profile.\n\nThese elements feature excellent thermal performance, static and are walkable. Their lightness results in savings in overall weight of the roof, which generates benefits in the foundation. They are also suitable for the subsequent installation of photovoltaic systems. Also this solution ensures the disposal of water outside of buildings of larges dimensions.\n\nWATER OUTSIDE SYSTEM\n\nRainwater is collected on the V secondary elements (Pitti tile) and thanks to an appropriate system of structural slopes is conveyed inside the gutter beams and disposed along the perimeter of the building.\n\nThe waterproofing and insulation of the Pitti tile is the result of a careful and detailed design that took into account the following aspects:\n\nstructural movements\n\ndimensional stability of products\n\ncompatibility between different materials used\n\nresistance to compression during pedestrian maintenance\n\nsystem flexibility and variability\n\nresistance to solar radiation\n\nsystem durability over time\n\neasy maintenance.\n\nAll this allowed to make the right choice of materials from use, to arrive at the definition of their correct laying system, thus obtaining a system of insulation and waterproofing equipped of great reliability over time.\n\nThe Microshed system enables prefabricated industrial buildings to be made very bright. The presence of shed frames every 3 meters or so allows for uniform and pleasant indirect lighting. . Roofs made with this system are completely walkable and allow water to be carried outside the building. The thermo-insulated waterproofing can be realized with several methods:\n\nA) By using TPO membranes on the entire cover, appropriately fixed to the insulating layer made of polystyrene or polyurethane.\n\nB) Placing in correspondence of the parabolic portion of the element microshed sheets in calendered corrugated sheet.\n\nIn the remaining flat parts, the solution described in point A is adopted.\n\nWith regard to the infill of the Shed, the use of self-extinguishing alveolar polycarbonate, of the type protected U.V. against photoageing, which combines the requirements of lightness and insulation. The streamlined morphology of the element allows the application of centralized and automated mechanisms for opening windows.\n\nThe Microshed system has been designed to have high ventilation and lighting ratios. Its particular parabolic shape, in addition to allowing the normal disposal of water outside the building, gives it a pleasant and elegant appearance.\n\nThey represent the response to the increasing performance that the outer shell of buildings must meet to comply with the most stringent energy saving regulations. The design of the required insulation layers is carried out through a certified calculation system.\n\nThe adopted production technology allows to fix the external architectural face of the infill to the rear bearing section without interrupting the high density insulation layer, thus avoiding the generation of thermal bridges. The supporting layer of the article can be in full C.A.V. or lightened by interposition of expanded polystyrene (EPS) sheets. Thanks to the Konnector system, the outer crust is free to expand and contract as a function of the temperature ranges completely independent of the supporting layer behind. Where necessary, the insertion of the vapour barrier prevents any condensation inside the panel."
