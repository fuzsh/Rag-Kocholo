        "text": "The Grand Paris Express is a major infrastructure project involving the creation of more than 200 kilometers of automatic metro lines, excavated with more than 25 TBMs, and 68 new stations.\n\nIt is part of the larger “Grand Paris” project which aims to transform Paris and its agglomeration into a great world metropolis of the 21st century. This project aims to improve the quality of life for citizens, correct inequalities territorial and to build a “sustainable” Paris. New economic hubs will be created major centers around the city center, interconnected through the creation of a high-performance and widespread public transport network. The new hubs will be also efficiently connected with airports, TGV train stations and the Paris city center.\n\nClient: RATP\n\n(Régie autonome des transports parisiens)\n\nThe project consists in the extension of Line 4 of the Paris metro to the municipality of Bagneux – Lot 2: open-air GC works at Bagneux station.\n\nThe covered trench between lot 1 and Bagneux station also includes the station’s GC works.\n\nLocation: first ring south of Paris – municipality of Bagneux\n\nFinal amount: about 35 mln €\n\nShare of Impresa Pizzarotti: 33%\n\nStart of work: T0 notified with ods on 15/05/2015\n\nEnd of work: 12/03/2021\n\nClient: RATP\n\n(Régie autonome des transports parisiens)\n\nThe project consists in the extension of Line 4 of the Paris metro to the Municipality of Bagneux – Lot 3: GC works of the back of the Bagneux station (transition to the tunnel).\n\nThe connecting tunnel between the station and the Train Repair Center, about 1 km in length, built in covered trench with jointed berms and piles.\n\nLocation: First ring south of Paris – Municipality of Bagneux\n\nFinal amount: about 35 mln €\n\nShare of Impresa Pizzarotti: 33%\n\nStart of work: T0 notified with OdS on 28/09/2015\n\nEnd of work: 13/11/2020\n\nThe extension of Line 11 from Mairie des Lilas to Rosny-Bois-Perrier is a complementary work to the larger Grand Paris Express project and is part of the many projects undertaken to modernize and develop Paris’ transportation network.\n\nLot GC01 is the first section of the extension of Line 11 eastward from Mairie de Lilas; the route runs through 4 municipalities and is excavated in densely populated urban areas, passing through the particular lithology of the Île-de-France territory.\n\nClient: RATP (Régie autonome des transports parisiens)\n\nThe project consists of TBM excavation of the 7.95 m diameter and 3 km long metro tunnel including 4 underground stations and 3 ventilation works. A daily excavation record of 23.54 mln was marked in the construction of the tunnel.\n\nLocation: northeast of Paris between the communes of Mairie des Lilas et Rosny Bois Perrier\n\nDiscounted amount: 340 mln €\n\nShare of Impresa Pizzarotti: 25%\n\nStart of work: June 2016\n\nEnd of work: May 2023\n\nThe GC-HSL lot is the set of civil engineering works for the physical connection between the existing Saint Lazare station and the westward extension of the RER E. The particular funnel shape serves to allow the transition from the 4 railways of the station to the 2 made by the TBM giving the project its name (entonnement).\n\nClient: SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français)\n\nThe project consists of the excavation in traditional method (mechanical at the tiller and hammer) of the junction between the existing EOLE 1 project (RER E station at Saint Lazare) and the arrival of the TBM coming from the west as part of the extension towards Nantere-La Folie of the existing RER E (length 173 m – surface area max 200 sq m). This is high-precision technical work carried out in the heart of Paris in the stratum, under historic Hausmanian buildings, which were monitored during and after the work.\n\nLot T2C of Line 15 South corresponds to the first lot of the new metro line called Grand Paris Express, consisting of the connection between the new Noisy-le-Grand station and the Bry-Villiers-Champigny (BVC) station. The route passes through three municipalities and affects densely populated urban areas, crossing the particular lithology of the Île-de-France territory.\n\nIt was the first construction site delivered as part of the Grand Paris Express project where Steffie Orbival, the first TBM ready to excavate and also the first to finish its route, was inaugurated.\n\nAt this construction site, a mixed excavation technique was devised for the crossing of the 807 work in order to reduce the execution time.\n\nClient: SGP (Société du Grand Paris)\n\nThe project consists of the excavation with 2 EPB-type TBMs of metro tunnels with a diameter of 9.86 m and a total length of about 7 km, including 2 attachment shafts (802-813) of the TBMs (Steffie and Malala), a disconnection shaft (807) between commercial line tunnels (802-BVC) and service tunnels (813-807), and 7 attached shafts.\n\nLocation: southeast of Paris between the municipalities of Noisy-le-Grand, Villiers sur Marne et Champigny sur Marne.\n\nFinal amount: 478 mln €\n\nShare of Impresa Pizzarotti: 25%\n\nStart of work: September 2016\n\nEnd of work: January 2022\n\nLine 17 lot 1 is the first stretch of the extension of line 17 to the north from Le Bourget; the route runs through 4 municipalities and crosses mostly urban areas on average and densely inhabited. From a technical point of view, the project is characterized by the particular lithology of the Île-de-France territory.\n\nClient: SGP (Société du Grand Paris)\n\nThe project consists in the excavation in TBM in two stages of the subway tunnel of 9.80 m diameter and total length of 6.1 km. Complete the work: 2 stations including 1 underground, 6 ventilation works, a launch and arrival well for the two sections of tunnels dug with the same machine and a trench of length 750 m. In the start of the TBM it was necessary to mount the bouclier on the surface and then lower it entirely in the bottom of the well with the singular operation defined “big lift”.\n\nLocation: northeast of Paris between the municipalities Le Bourget and Gonesse\n\nDiscounted amount: 490 million €\n\nShare of Impresa Pizzarotti: 25%\n\nStart of work: January 2019\n\nEnd of work: September 2023"
