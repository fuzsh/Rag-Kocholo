        "text": "The Roberts Co Group has acquired the remaining 50 per cent shareholding previously held by it’s Italian partner Impresa Pizzarotti, making the major tier one construction company Australian-owned.\n\nRoberts Pizzarotti will officially change its name to Roberts Co to reflect the acquisition. This will consolidate Roberts Co as a global business under one name with operations across Australia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\nOver four years Roberts Co has worked on Zurich Tower in North Sydney, North Shore Health Hub, redevelopment of Concord Hospital, upgrades throughout the Liverpool Hospital precinct and The Schools at Meadowbank Education and Employment Precinct for the NSW Government.\n\nAustralian CEO Alison Mirams said the company is extremely proud of the success achieved to date and believe this move will allow us to direct our energy into further growth and expansion in Australia.\n\n“We have over $650million in current contract value on the books with a team exceeding 140 employees.”\n\nMirams said Roberts Co will continue to drive change within the construction industry where it has already gained a reputation as a positive disruptor and innovator.\n\nThe company now has a 5-day working week and a concerted organisational drive towards higher female participation (32 per cent of the company’s employees are currently women, including 65 per cent of its executive team) and supporting a major focus on work/life balance among all construction personnel.\n\n“People, relationships and a unique approach to business are at the heart of our organisation,” Mirams said.\n\n“We are a team of thinkers, continually developing innovations to improve and simplify how the industry operates, empowering our workforce, finding smarter ways to work and delivering enhanced value to our clients.”\n\nRelated stories:"
