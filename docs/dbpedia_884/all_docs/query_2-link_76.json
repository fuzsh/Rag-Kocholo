        "text": "The project aims to improve the mobility of Florence and the surrounding areas, safeguarding urban and environmental balances and providing it with new sustainable infrastructure, mainly built underground. To this end, two tunnels and a new station dedicated exclusively to high-speed trains will be built, thus creating new underground infrastructure that will allow high-speed trains to operate without interfering with regional trains. This will improve punctuality and make it possible to increase the number of trains running above ground, facilitating increased local ridership. The new station will serve as a main hub and connection point to other public transportation, such as streetcars, buses, cabs, bike paths, and pedestrian routes.\n\nThe future high-speed station Firenze Belfiore will rise in the Belfiore-Macelli area, adjacent to the current railway station. Designed by Foster & Partners and Ove Arup & Partners, the structure will have dimensions of about 450 meters long and 50 meters wide, with an area of about 45,000 square meters. Positioned up to 25 meters below road level, the station will feature a glazed roof supported by a steel structure that will rise for about 18 meters.\n\nThe station will be divided into four levels: the platforms for boarding trains, a mezzanine floor for passenger distribution, the ground floor and the first floor. The first two levels will be underground, while the first floor will be located inside the roof, which will ensure natural lighting, environmental and acoustic control, Air exchange and smoke evacuation through a structure composed of elements with structural variations.\n\nThe project incorporates innovative technological solutions to reduce environmental impact, using renewable materials and reducing energy consumption and polluting emissions. The Florence station is a completely new model for Italy, with its underground structure that offers natural lighting even at the lower levels, facilitating the orientation of passengers. The lowered vaulted roof, enriched with photovoltaic cells integrated in the panels, will act as an “artificial sky”, adjusting the sunlight and reproducing the external colors inside the station.\n\nNATURAL TUNNELS\n\nSingle-track tunnels: of circular cross-section with an internal diameter of 8,3 m\n\nDouble-track tunnels: polycentric\n\nSingle-track tunnels shall be mechanically excavated with face-supporting cutters (TBM-EPBS) to maintain pressure on the front at all times and to contain cable deformation by covering the tunnel at a very short distance from the front with waterproof prefabricated rings, limiting water infiltration with the help of additives injected directly into the excavation chamber. The earlier tunnels will be excavated by traditional method and the use of freezing technology for the consolidation and waterproofing of the soil. It is planned to consolidate the soil before the passage of the TBM to ensure the safety of excavation.\n\nMOBILITÀ SOSTENIBILE\n\nUse for over 70% of:\n\nmobile machinery meeting low emission standards (STAGE V or equivalent);\n\nEuro 6 vehicles for the transport of steel, concrete and building land with low environmental impact;\n\nenvironmentally friendly passenger vehicles (Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle or Full Electric).\n\nIn addition, it is planned to install, at various points of the yard, columns for charging electric cars, connected to solar panels placed on the shelters provided for the coverage of parking.\n\nThe train for the transport of the lands and rocks from excavation will be used that will be employed for plans of rinaturalizzazione of external sites to the yard.\n\nENVISION PROTOCOL\n\nEnvision is a rating system introduced to assess the impact that an infrastructure may have on the community and the local area during its entire life cycle. In particular, the effects on the quality of life and mobility, the degree of community involvement, the possible economic development following the construction and use of the infrastructure itself, as well as the degree of use of natural resources and renewable energy during and after construction, the degree of protection of the natural environment and the reduction of emissions will be evaluated.\n\nThus, with the adoption of the Envision protocol, it is intended to proceed with the certification of the “Platinum” level of sustainability of the “Florence High-Speed Node” project, the objective of which must also be pursued by all future contractors involved in various capacities in the implementation of the project."
