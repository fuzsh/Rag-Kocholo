        "text": "The safety of our people, partners and the communities in which we operate is an absolute priority for us. We implement rigorous policies and safety procedures to ensure a safe working environment on all our construction sites. We invest in ongoing training for staff and promote a culture of safety throughout the company. We will increasingly use advanced technologies such as iot surveillance and data analytics to constantly monitor safety conditions on construction sites and prevent accidents.\n\nOur first priority is to consolidate our position in strategic countries for the group. We will continue to focus on providing high-quality services in these areas, building strong relationships with existing clients and seeking targeted expansion opportunities based on market needs.\n\nWe implement cutting-edge digital solutions at every stage of our projects, using technologies such as building information modeling (bim), artificial intelligence (ai) and the internet of things (iot) to improve planning, management and execution of construction sites. These solutions will allow us to be increasingly efficient in the future, reducing construction times and operating costs.\n\nWe make environmental sustainability a central pillar of our strategy, using sustainable and recyclable materials in our designs. We implement eco-friendly construction practices, such as optimizing the use of water and energy resources and responsible waste management. The objective is to reduce the environmental impact of our construction sites and contribute to the fight against climate change.\n\nWe strengthen our operational processes to ensure maximum efficiency, using data and analytics to improve resource management, optimize workflows and minimize waste. This allows us not only to respect project delivery times, but also to be increasingly competitive on the market.\n\nTo stay at the forefront of innovation, we establish strategic collaborations with start-ups in sustainable construction and technologies. These partnerships bring in new ideas and cutting-edge solutions that we can integrate into our projects. We are thus able to quickly introduce innovations and improvements into our operations, providing clients with advanced and efficient solutions. Collaboration with start-ups offers us a fresh perspective and a continuous source of innovation, allowing us to maintain a leadership position in the construction industry, with a strong focus on sustainability, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction."
