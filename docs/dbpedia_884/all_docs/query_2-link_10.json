        "text": "MILAN, Nov. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Infor, a global leader in business cloud software specialised by industry, today announced that Italian civil engineering and construction leader Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa, has selected an Infor enterprise software suite based around Infor LN. The suite for 700 users incorporates enterprise resource planning (ERP), enterprise asset management (EAM) and analytics (Birst) capabilities, and will support Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa's digital transformation strategy. With a focus on consolidating processes to boost visibility and enhance forecasting, the strategy is designed to support expansion into new emerging markets and cement Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa's position in existing territories.\n\nImpresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa selected Infor based on both the capabilities of the software and its ability to scale for future growth. Crucial to the decision was Infor's ability to facilitate best practices in corporate governance, risk management and reporting, as well as tight cost control across every customer project to support reporting and planning.\n\n\"Our digital transformation strategy is intrinsic to Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa's expansion into new markets, and Infor will form a fundamental part of this,\" comments Augusto Lambertino, group IT director at Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa. \"Through reducing manual processes and streamlining operations — from tighter cost control on projects to shared reporting and enhanced financial visibility across the whole organisation — we are in a strong position to meet our current and future goals and consolidate our reputation for quality and service in the industries we serve.\"\n\n\"The scale and complexity of Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa's business means that adopting common processes and centralising reporting are imperative to establishing a foundation for expansion,\" comments Laurent Jacquemain, Infor vice president for Southern Europe. \"With construction projects spanning rail, roads, ports and hospitals, having a means of consistently tracking costs and feeding these back into planning is key to managing both service and profitability. Impresa Pizzarotti & C. Spa's decision to invest in ERP, EAM and analytics capabilities from Infor will afford it the visibility to make the very best decisions on its future direction.\"\n\nAbout Infor\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry.
