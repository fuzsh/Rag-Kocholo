        "text": "IMPRESA PIZZAROTTI & C. S.P.A\n\nImpresa Pizzarotti & C. S.p.A. has a history stretching back 100 years.\n\nIt was founded in 1910 by Gino Pizzarotti as a sole trader, since when it has\n\nundergone process of evolution that has never stopped. Converted in 1945 into a\n\nlimited liability company by Pietro Pizzarotti, father of the current Chairman,\n\nCavaliere del Lavoro Paolo Pizzarotti, in 1961 it became a joint stock company\n\nwith a share capital of 200 million euros.\n\nIt was from the end of the 1950s that the company consolidated its position\n\nin the construction sector, becoming one of the most important and skilled\n\ncompanies in the country; this came about through the completion of large public\n\nand infrastructure works on behalf of both state bodies and the largest private\n\ncompanies in Italy.\n\nThe company has always targeted ongoing development in the civil works\n\ncarried out for thermo-electrical and nuclear power stations, roads and\n\nmotorways, civil and military airports, irrigation and hydraulic engineering\n\nworks, dykes, industrial infrastructure, railway construction, and prison\n\nconstruction work; the same can be said of the reconstruction work in the areas\n\nstruck by the earthquake in Irpinia in 1980, where it was involved in the\n\nbuilding of dwellings, schools and infrastructure of various kinds.\n\nThe commitment and ability to carry out major projects led to the company\n\nsuccessfully establishing itself abroad, where it has been operating since the\n\nseventies. At that time there was the oil pipeline constructed between Hassi\n\nMessaoud and In Amenas in Algeria, as well as the port of Bandar Amenas in Iran.\n\nMore recent constructions include the Euro Disney theme park in Chessy near\n\nParis, the hydroelectric power station at Luzon in the Philippines, the new\n\ninterchange between the High Speed Railway Station and the Regional Metropolitan\n\nRailway Network at Charles de Gaulle Airport, the shaft on the Gotthard railway\n\nline together with the station at Sedrun and a number of kilometres of railway\n\nline, to mention just a few.\n\nThe Pizzarotti Group, which has always retained its head office in Parma,\n\ntoday consists of a number of companies operating in total synergy in the\n\ninfrastructure, energy and environment, hydraulic engineering, civil and\n\nmilitary airport, building and construction sectors."
