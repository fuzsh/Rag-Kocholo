        "text": "The New Maternity Hospital represents a particularly important work for Kuwait, which will have a concrete impact on maternity care, becoming the first highly specialized hospital in the region.\n\nWe followed the design (carried out with BIM mode level LOD 300), construction and operational maintenance of the hospital, located in the medical district Al Sabah in Kuwait City.\n\nThe structure will host 780 beds, 28 operating rooms, a building (called Annex Building [ANX]) for Day hospital and administration, a multi-storey parking and a building for plants and power plants. In particular, the ANX building, with 6 levels above ground and an area of over 45,000 square meters (including two underground floors intended for garages), houses all the management services of the complex.\n\nTo this are added all the management structures present within the hospital complex of 241,000 square meters (libraries, archives, entrances, common areas, services, etc.). The tallest building extends 95 meters above ground plus 7 meters underground for a total of 102 meters.\n\n4 BUILDINGS (max 18 floors, about 100 meters):\n\nHSP Building – Main Hospital\n\nBuilding ANX – 2 basements, parking, clinics, auditorium and administration\n\nCRP building – 2 underground floors and 6 floors (1219 parking stalls)\n\nCUP Building – Central plant with about 40 MW of installed electricity\n\n4 CONNECTING BRIDGES BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND CAR PARKS\n\nTUNNEL between CUP and HSP\n\nBREAKWATER PROTECTION WORKS (being the buildings by the sea)\n\nPUBLIC GREEN (both on the ground floor and hanging gardens)\n\nTotal built-up area (including parking and services): 357,337 sqm\n\nBeds in hospital: 780\n\nOperating rooms: 28\n\nLabor and delivery salt: 60\n\nParking spaces: 1800\n\nThe construction of the New Hospital Centre is a major project for Guadeloupe. The new hospital will bring together in a single center in the heart of Guadeloupe all medical, surgical and obstetric services.\n\nWe followed design (performed with BIM mode LOD level 400-500 according to BS PAS 1192-2:2013) and construction of the hospital. The project is located in seismic and cyclonic area, and is spread over over 19 hectares with a series of 4-storey buildings, for a total of 618 beds. This is an important project for Guadeloupe: this new generation hospital has been conceived to combine medical efficiency and the quality of hospitality. The design was based on the harmony between technical performance and the culture, climate and way of life of the island. Inside the hospital there are important management structures such as administrative, logistical and technical offices, staff canteens, archives, as well as all distribution and reception spaces for the public (entrances, common areas, services, etc.).\n\nWe have followed the Project Financing for the design, construction and management of non sanitary services in the four Tuscan Hospitals of Massa, Lucca, Prato and Pistoia. For 20 years we will be engaged in the management of all non-medical activities and in the civil and plant maintenance of everything we have built.\n\nIn collaboration with the Tuscan health authorities and the Tuscany Region, we have helped develop new hospital facilities to improve access to medical care in the region. A commitment aimed at enhancing public health through modern and sustainable architectural solutions.\n\nIn 2007 the Concession was awarded to Società di Progetto SA. T S.p.A. (of which the Pizzarotti Company held 30% until 2017 and still holds a share of 1%) entrusted to the consortium CO.SAT Scrl, 50% owned by Pizzarotti, the executive design and construction of hospitals.\n\nThe four hospitals were all built between 2009 and 2015 and feature a total of 1,710 beds, 52 operating theatres, 21 labour rooms and 14 delivery rooms.\n\nSA. T S.p.A. then entrusted to the consortium company GE.SAT Scarl (of which Pizzarotti holds 46.15%) the management of all non-sanitary services that includes, among other activities, the maintenance services civil structures and plants, cleaning, automated transport services, catering, washing, sterilization, maintenance of green areas and medical gas management, until the end of the concession scheduled in 2033.\n\nIn addition, Impresa Pizzarotti is 100% committed as a provider of GE.SAT Scarl in the management and maintenance of plant and civil hospitals in Pistoia and Prato through two separate contracts also expiring at the end of the concession."
