News Talk WGAC is Augusta’s station for local and national sports. With the new WGAC app, you can connect with us like never before.

Just download and open your WGAC app to get a live feed of what’s on, and everything else that’s aired over the past couple of hours on WGAC.

Based on your feedback, we are excited to bring you a whole new app experience. Make the app your own with these new features:

Improved ease of navigation to help get you where you’re going

Hear something on air? Find it easy on the app

Customize the order of stories, podcasts, and galleries that appear in the app

Plus: Select additional stations to sample in the new “My Stations” section

You decide when you want to listen, and when you want to browse by turning the live stream on or off within the app. Get what you want off the radio with the new WGAC app.
