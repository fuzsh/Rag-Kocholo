        "text": "Men, as a gender, commit the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults, no matter the gender of the victim. This behavior has much to do with our masculinities and how most men are socialized. Men in the Movement is an anti-violence initiative designed to prevent sexual assault at Colorado State University by engaging men. We do this by learning how our personal attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors as men support and excuse harmful attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of other men. The program is designed to deconstruct those behaviors and offer healthier alternatives for masculinities.\n\nMen in the Movement has 2 features. The first features is a free, 11-week program designed for CSU men. If you identify as a man and want to understand gender-based violence, this is the place for you. We won’t lie though, it’s a tough process to go through, but a necessary one if we’re going to address men’s violence against women. The second aspect is a monthly “Open Event” designed for CSU students of all genders. Topics for these Open Events range from talking about Masculinity and Depression, male body image, current events, or screening films like “The Mask You Live In” and having a discussion about the film. Find out when the next one is by following the SAFE Center on Facebook and Instagram or checking out the online blog."
