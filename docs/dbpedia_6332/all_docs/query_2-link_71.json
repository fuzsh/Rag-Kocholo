        "text": "Austin’s Daily Commentary – Kamala Harris, The Most Liberal Democratic Nominee\n\nAustin talks about Kamala Harris being the most liberal Democratic nominee and how could she possibly go harder left? Then she selected Tim Walz as her VP nominee.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: Vice President Kamala Harris comes to the 2024 presidential race as literally the most liberal Democratic nominee in history, the most liberal presidential nominee in history by far. You didn’t think she could go harder left. There was no way she could go harder left. Certainly for her vice presidential candidate or her nominee, she’s going to go with someone that is going to moderate her hard left, political core, her drastic political leanings to the left.\n\nNo no no no no. Let’s double down on the lefty, shall we? Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, one of the few states that has not voted Republican since 1972. Oh my goodness.\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, just when you thought that the abortion laws in California were crazy, where Kamala’s from, Minnesota doubles down. The most liberal abortion laws in the country by far. There are about five states that are all this way. Absolutely no age limit whatsoever on abortion. No gestation limit. Hey, you’re nine months pregnant and decided you don’t want to do it? Let’s go get an abortion.\n\nAnd what was the other one? Oh, for those, minors under the age of 18 to get the abortions. You know, 11 years old. 12 years old. They don’t have to tell their parents at all. No notification. No. No permission, nothing.\n\nNow, if you want to defend that, I don’t use this word often in political terms, but anyone that believes an 11-year-old girl should be able to not tell her parents that she’s getting an abortion, her legally, you know, competent parents. That is demonic policy. There’s no other word for it. It’s demonic. And I don’t know why so many people are accepting it as, oh, no big deal.\n\nOh, my God, this is really turning into something quite extraordinary. I hope that it’s a push for enthusiasm toward the Trump ticket. I am terrified to think what is going to become of this country if these two become the next winners of the White House.\n\nAnd that’s the comment. I’m Austin Rhodes, 95.1 FM, News Talk WGAC."
