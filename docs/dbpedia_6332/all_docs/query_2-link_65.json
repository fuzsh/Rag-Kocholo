        "text": "Austin’s Daily Commentary – Criticism of Donald Trump On The Campaign Trail\n\nAustin talks about the criticism of President Donald Trump on the campaign trail and his interview with the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAustin: There are a lot of criticisms of President Donald Trump’s demeanor on the campaign trail. One thing that really surprised me, it actually made me laugh. A few weeks ago was when this notion came up that somehow Trump was going to be afraid to debate Kamala Harris and that there was going to be, you know, some reluctance to engage with her. Nothing in the world is further from the truth. The man runs into the lion’s den. He doesn’t avoid it.\n\nLook what happened yesterday. National Association of Black Journalists. And I don’t think that President Trump was necessarily ready for the right out of the gate, aggressive attack of the lady journalist that was interviewing him, and he just wasn’t having it. And he gave as good as he got.\n\nHe did go down the rabbit hole of questioning Vice President Harris’s heritage. Which is saying basically, you know, is she a black lady? Is she calling herself a black lady? And the president again, I’m the Trump whisperer here. What he was alluding to is, of course, the way that she capitalizes on her ethnicity to her advantage, depending on what audience she’s in front of.\n\nIf she’s in front of a Jamaican-friendly audience, she comes off as a Rastafarian. If she wants to play up her Indian and Asian Indian background from India, she’ll play that up depending on what crowd she’s in. And again, if it’s an African American crowd, she wants to claim African American heritage.\n\nBottom line. She’s a black lady. She’s always been a black lady. And it’s worked greatly to her advantage. Keep in mind, President Biden wanted a black lady vice president. And look who arrived. Oh, it’s a beautiful thing.\n\nIn the meantime, this gets us away from the real topic of the day, the important topic of the day. Which are the issues that have to be dealt with. Trump has a superior mindset when it comes to those particular items, and he needs to beat that drum as loudly as he can.\n\nStay away from the other conversations. Pardon me, as entertaining as they can be, very distracting. And that’s the comment. I’m Austin Rhodes, 95.1 FM News Talk WGAC."
