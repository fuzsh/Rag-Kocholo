Probably the hardest one of the year in terms of trying to replicate what they do. They do a tremendous job stressing you in all phases. They've always been good with Josh in terms of offensively, but I think what they've been able to do defensively this year to me is really impressive. They've played really good defense, really good offense. The tempo is hard to match. And then their special teams. You know, that's the phase nobody talks about. These guys are really elite on special teams. You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into it.\n\nSo it's a huge challenge. When you go on the road in the SEC — I say it all the time. It doesn't matter who, where, when. It doesn't matter anything about anybody's record. The only thing that matters is you're playing on the road in the SEC in a really tough environment, and the prep for that is kind of the challenge that are team has to embrace. You have to embrace it. It's different. I mean, when you go on the road in our league — especially when you go to play a team as talented as Tennessee is."
