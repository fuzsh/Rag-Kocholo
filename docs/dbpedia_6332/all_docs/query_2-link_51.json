I don't know their coach, Mike Neu, well but I get to meet him obviously. Got a lot of respect for their conference. We played Kent State out of their conference last year and the MAC has done an incredible job of creating a good football environment and some really good football teams. We got to put last game to bed this morning, which we don't usually get to do on Monday. But with no school, we're able to jump ahead. So this afternoon we'll jump into Ball State and get prepared for them.\""
