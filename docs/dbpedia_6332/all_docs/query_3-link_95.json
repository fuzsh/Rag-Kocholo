        "text": "Jim ‘N Nick’s – A Review\n\nI had a chance to check out Jim ‘N Nick’s in Augusta recently, and here’s my review.\n\nJim ‘N Nick’s\n\nSo, a “new” BBQ spot opened in the area about 6 weeks ago. Jim ‘N Nick’s is NOT a locally owned BBQ restaurant as so many of the establishments are in this area. As a matter of fact, there are, as of this writing, 47 locations. The most are in Georgia, 18. There are 17 locations in Alabama, making sense since that’s where the first restaurant opened.\n\nIf you read the history of the restaurant, the first one opened in Birmingham, Alabama in 1985, in an old pizza restaurant.\n\nWe wanted to give them some time to get through the crowds that accompany the opening of a new restaurant in town, and we honestly wanted to give them some time to get the routine down.\n\nJim ‘N Nick’s Lunch Experience\n\nSo, three of us went off for lunch the other day. A couple of things you should know right off the bat. They are very committed to a drive thru business. The look and coordination of the drive-thru would rival Chick-Fil-A. The regional supervisor we spoke with said that “drive-thru” is a huge portion of their business.\n\nThe other thing you should know is that, like many BBQ places, you get in line, order your food and then take a seat. It is not a restaurant where you sit, and someone takes your order. Something to think about if you have a large party or are on a schedule.\n\nWhen we arrived, the line was out the door, but honestly, I thought it moved quickly. There is a generous menu, with even a couple of fish options.\n\nFor the three of us, one got a salad with pulled pork on top. Another got six wings and I got the turkey breast sandwich. My sides were baked beans (which I had heard a lot about) and macaroni & cheese.\n\nJim ‘N Nick’s Review\n\nEveryone had great things to say about their meals. Interestingly, with the exception of the pulled pork on her salad, none of us got BBQ plates. Having just had BBQ over the weekend I was looking for something a little different. The turkey was moist and tender. The baked beans were REALLY good, and so was the mac & cheese. The diner with the wings said they were excellent. I’ll be trying the wings the next time.\n\nPrices are what you would expect. With a drink and tip, mine lunch was close to $20. Not sure what my friends spent.\n\nIt’s tough in the community with so many good BBQ places from which to choose to cut through the clutter. Their location, out on the Robert C. Daniel Parkway, is on the lot that previously housed the Macaroni Grill.\n\nI think Jim ‘N Nick’s is a wonderful addition to the many BBQ choices we already have available. I think it will appeal especially to older folks and families that are looking for something a little more than the sometimes “down home” feel of mom-and-pop BBQ spots.\n\nIf you go, enjoy. Let us know what you think…"
