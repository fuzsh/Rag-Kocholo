Please understand that companies that use this free service are not necessarily Christian employers. Also, in spite of our due diligence, we are not responsible for the way a company represents itself or the position it is posting. Please approach these listings with common sense (as you would job listings from any other source). We want to continue to make this a valuable tool. We welcome your comments as you make use of it at info@wafj.com."
