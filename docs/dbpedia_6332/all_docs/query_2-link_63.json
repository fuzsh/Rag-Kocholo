To casually use “G—-D—-“ on air is totally inappropriate. I heard it twice within 5 minutes and then changed stations. The image this show projects for your station does not fit with your audience and I urge you to re-evaluate your broadcast partner.\n\nLarry Kelley (CHOP)\n\nBeen listening to the show for years and really enjoy the daily news and the people on the show!! Thanks for all the updates and news\n\non our TIGERS!!! GO TIGERS!! Yes on Valerie Cagle being the best woman athlete for Clemson!! She would get my vote even knowing there are\n\nplenty of great lady athletes that have came through Clemson!!\n\nThanks have a great day!!\n\nChop"
