        "text": "Bob Turner\n\nBeasley Media Group, a subsidiary of Beasley Broadcast Group, has appointed Bob Turner to general sales manager for the company’s southwest Florida radio stations. The company has also added Jeff Reynolds as the new afternoon drive personality, from 3 to 7 p.m. at WKXC(FM) in Augusta, Ga.\n\nTurner’s duties at Beasley involve overseeing sales, including digital, online and mobile sales for all six stations in the Ft. Myers-Naples-Marco Island, Fla., market.\n\nHe joined Beasley Media Group SWFL, after serving as president of Azteca America, an international television network and spot sales company. His background includes two decades of entrepreneurial experience in executive management and business development.\n\nIn the Fort Myers-Naples market, Beasley Media Group owns four FMs and one AM: WRXK(FM), WWCN(FM), WXKB(FM), WJPT(FM) and WJBX(AM). Beasley owns “The Link”, a modern adult contemporary format, which can be heard through four FM translators in Lee County and in Collier County.\n\nJeff Reynolds replaces Bryan Axelson, who recently moved to morning drive on WKXC as part of the Kicks Wake Up Krew.\n\nJeff Reynolds\n\nReynolds most recently spent four years as an afternoon radio host for Emmis Communications at WTHI(FM), the Wabash Valley’s country station, in Terre Haute, Ind. His prior experience includes radio work in Muncie, Ind., with Backyard Broadcasting and Citadel Broadcasting.\n\n“Since I was a kid, I dreamed of working in radio! I caught the radio bug early and it stuck,” said Reynolds. “And, our technology keeps evolving, which is fun. Keeping up with ever-changing social media and unique Web content means this job is much more than just talking between songs. I get paid to be creative, every day!”\n\nIn the Augusta radio market, Beasley Media Group owns six FMs and two AMs: WKXC(FM), WHHD(FM), WDRR(FM), WGUS(FM), WCHZ(FM), W238AU(FM), WGAC(FM), WGAC(AM) and WRDW(AM)."
