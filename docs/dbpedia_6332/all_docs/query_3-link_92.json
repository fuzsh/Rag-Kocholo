As a record label contract since they‚Äôll produce 360¬∞ degree protection and with ancillary rights, then they‚Äôll be no argument to hold them accountable for. & if every artist gets a distribution contract with $15k advance in Spotify streams, they‚Äôll be as big as the artists the companies that sue them about this will replace them as a new marketing platform and marketplace to hear talent This is my own idea.

Alternate Wordle versions created by fans also sprang up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

For those who don't, TRL was an American show on MTV in the late 90s that played the top ten most requested music videos of the day, as voted on by viewers via phone or online. The show also had near-daily segments from MTV News correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio. It became a cultural phenomenon. I remember coming home from school every day in time to put TRL on. Drawing some inspiration from that concept, we're excited to announce something new today that we're calling AudiencePlus Live (APL). APL is a monthly live broadcast for AudiencePlus subscribers where we deep dive into different elements of Owned Media execution - but instead of Carson Daly and Dave Holmes, you get me and Todd Clouser. But each month we'll break down one of the top requested questions from YOU on how to execute Owned Media well. And like TRL, our audience will be visible on the call providing feedback, ideas, and color commentary. We're starting with an important first topic. How to convert your audience into owned subscribers using exclusive content. There's a lot of momentum and belief behind Owned Media, but unless you're able to convert your unknown audience into known subscribers, you're doing the \"media\" bit but not the \"owned\" part. And as a result, you're missing out on all the benefits including lower cost of distribution, deeper insights into engagement, and an easier path to attribution of content on revenue. We'll walk through a tactical approach for developing an exclusive content strategy and answer your questions live. APL will be held on Wednesday, May 22nd at 10AM PST / 1PM EST. Shoot me a comment or DM below and I'll add you to the invite."
