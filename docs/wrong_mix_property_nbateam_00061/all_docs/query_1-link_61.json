        "text": "How I Became a Scholar of Buddhism?\n\nMy Journey from Sri Lankan Buddhist Monastery to European Academy via Atlantic and Pacific Detours\n\nProfessor Mahinda Deegalle\n\nProfessor of Religions, Philosophies and Ethics\n\nBath Spa University\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBirth and Opportunities\n\nAs somewhat ‘unique’ individuals, our ‘destiny’, if we use that term in an optimistic sense, is not fully determined either by the location of one’s birth place or the family that one belongs to. As natural processes, multiple opportunities open up unfolding things and successes that are so unpredictable. Once we use unpredictable opportunities by taking some risk, new avenues appear to excel us in whatever we do.\n\nHuman life is full of ironies. Once we are born we grow up where we started by adapting to and adopting from local contexts. For me, in addition to my natural birth, there was always an important second birth. My second birth was the ritual act of receiving novice ordination in the Buddhist tradition. That religious and spiritual birth gave me new visions and open up new avenues for success. When I reflect back, there is always an irony; a conundrum still that does not find easy solutions. There was a little choice or no knowledge of where I would receive Buddhist ordination. Both birth as well as ordination were beyond me; they were things that were out of my control. My early education, primary as well as monastic education until entrance to University of Peradeniya, was not also my choice. We are always controlled by other forces and factors beyond our reach. University education as an undergraduate as well as post-graduate studies in Comparative Religion and History of Religions was more or less my choice. I must acknowledge here that my preceptor had some influence on me in choosing Peradeniya as opposed to Colombo in entering the university system. On the basis of available options, nevertheless I could have chosen the university of my choice and the programme that I wanted to be registered in for studies. This early choice, which was very much dependent on multiple factors, has become important today. My progress in the past makes me realize and appreciate what I did in the last three decades. Evaluation of my choice of location and the area of specialization have rewarded me academically in the last three decades.\n\nAs virtuous humans we learn from the teachings of the Buddha to become more virtuous. The Buddha taught that we have to be ‘content with whatever we receive’ (yathā lābha santuṭṭhī; on another occasion, as santuṭṭhī paramaṃ dhanaṃ ‘contentment is the greatest wealth,’ Dhammapada, v. 204). It is important and valuable to be satisfied in each moment with whatever we have; we are not supposed to confront, struggle and fight what comes up on our way without cultivating proper attitudes towards them. We have to think, contemplate and reflect upon the process as well as its consequences. When I look back, in retrospect I see, where I lived, what I studied, where I worked for, academic positions that I held, and people that I came to associate with, etc., most of those choices which eventually shaped me to become a scholar of the twenty-first century, were not entirely my choice or actions of my free will alone; there were significant other factors on the background whose operation was largely beyond my control or vision. Many facets of our lives are indebted to others and very much depend on many other factors; they lie largely beyond our own choices. It is a fact, more or less, external factors had more control over me; if I asserted myself in conventional terms, it was perhaps the visible facet only.\n\nFormative Years in the Village\n\nOn a Tuesday, in the night of Halloween, I was born in Badulla, an up-country town in the Uva Province of Sri Lanka. My parents’ home was located in a relatively remote village from Badulla, the capital of the province. The village was with full of traditional charm of paddy fields, mountains, woods, tea, and fresh air. The unsophisticated place was abundantly rich with a lifestyle of simplicity and serenity. At that time, in 1960s, our village lacked most of complex amenities of urban living. What we take for granted today such as electricity, modern modes of transport, telephones and television were missing. My primary education was in the village school, located on a visible place on the border of the village three miles or so far away from home. Schooling involved daily walking to the school by foot on foot paths and along canals. Once I remember there was a significant landslide in the middle of paddy fields along our foot path that we daily walk; at that time, we were in the school and witnessed the occurrence during the interval. After school, we passed through paddy fields, water ways, bridges and woods while climbing up and down hills along the way to reach home. We had plenty of physical exercise daily as well as fresh air and spent a life closer to nature and wild life. Education at the small village school, consisted of only two buildings, was in the vernacular. As a child, on holidays and weekends, when grandparents were involved in agricultural activities, I was initiated early on to intricacies of paddy cultivation. I still vividly remember my maternal grandfather arranged a custom-made small mamoty for me from local blacksmith. Participation in agricultural activities and seasonal festivals in the village was more an extra-curricular activity and hobby. We were never bored then; we did not miss anything; we always had plenty of things to do; we never missed perceived benefits of any of modern amenities that are essential for life today. As children, early on, we were exposed to Buddhism; our village school was adjoined to the local temple. Ironically, temple was located on a lower ground than the school, in a less visible place.\n\nDue to proximity to tea plantations around the village, I was exposed to Hindu festivals. In addition to Buddhist ones, I could observe and have glimpses of Tamil lifestyle of plantation workers. I could say that I was not brought up in an air-tight exclusive Sinhalese and Buddhist neighborhood. As the first-born of our family, I had plenty of affection and protection from both my mother’s and father’s side of the family. Neighbors and relatives cared for us.\n\nI still vividly remember my first day of school. It was 4 January 1967. After dropping me at the school gate, my father hid himself among the crowds that were dropping their children for the first day of school. I could not bear separation from my father. I was also immensely shy to embark myself in the new school setting with others who were crying like myself. Father had abandoned me right there with the female teacher. The event of going to school first was a big thing for parents, grandparents and relatives. Closer to the first day of school, they celebrate the occasion by preparing traditional delicacies of festivities such as kävum (rice flour cake with honey), kokis (fried delicacies from rice flour) and kiribat (milk rice). I remained in the village school until the completion of Fifth Grade on 31 December 1971.\n\nNovice Ordination for Entering Monastic Life\n\nThe significant, life changing early transition in my childhood occurred when I passed my tenth birthday. In the school holiday time in December, there were conversations among the close relatives in the family to ordain my younger brother, Sunil. My brother was planning and aspiring to become a Buddhist novice for a few years. Though he had consented for ordination for a while, at the last moment, he abruptly declined the offer. In that context, I was placed in his place. When the opportunity fell on me, I embraced it fully. I consented to receive novice ordination (sāmaṇera) as a fulltime Buddhist monastic practitioner. The novice ordination occurred within a shorter period of two months. On those days, it was rare to have such quick ordinations. It was a quite unusual fast track. Usual practice is that the young candidate stays in the temple for a year to two preparing for the ordination. At that time, I was barely ten and half years old. I had just completed the fifth grade in the village school.\n\nThe novice ordination ceremony took place in Bandarawela, a site of a monastic school established in 1957. Among the twenty-nine candidates, there were three from our village. I was the youngest from our village, but there were several younger ones (about eight or nine) in the group. In all formal occasions such as meals and worship services we were expected to line up on a row according our age. That was the monastic seniority system. Three of us from our village knew each other very casually. We joined to the large group of twenty-nine candidates for novice ordination. The ordination ceremony was a two-day festival. In the morning of Friday 28 January 1972, our family and relatives joined the parents of other candidates in Bandarawela. We were dressed in white as candidates for ordination. In the evening, there was an all-night paritta (protection) chanting to bless us. In the morning of Saturday 29 January, each of us was escorted to the area of temple well and our heads were saved and afterwards given showers. Then we were given robes and precepts after repeating formulaic recitations and made us sāmaṇeras. This was a formal admission to the order as novice members of the saṅgha. We were also offered necessary things such as umbrella, robes, pillows, books, etc.[1] Parents left us in the afternoon of that day. It was a sad moment to see them leaving. I saw again father was hiding to say good-bye. Sunday was a restful day and the first full day in the monastic school as newly ordained. We were busy to learn and master skills and to follow the daily routine of the temple. Our regular schooling began on the following day afternoon in the monastic school.\n\nIt may be useful to tell a little bit about the background for my Buddhist novice ordination. From my mother’s side, one of her father’s younger brothers had already a Buddhist monk. He was prominent and had several temples under him. He arrives in my maternal grandfather’s house a few times a year. He arrives definitely on the day of the annual alms giving. His fellow monks as well as his immediate pupils arrive in the grandfather’s house for dāna (alms giving) ceremonies as well as for other business. As a child I remember once my grandfather and grandmother along with other family members sponsored an annual vassa (rain) retreat and offered the kaṭhina robe at home.\n\nFrequent visits of Buddhist monks to grandmother’s house was unique in our village. It showed that our family had close connections with Buddhist institutions and monks. These encounters had significant impact on my exposure to Buddhism at an early age. I recall now, in our grandmother’s house, there was a special small room dedicated entirely to a shrine room, where daily rituals take place. Our grandmother regularly offered buddhapūjā (offering to the Buddha) in the morning and lunch time. In the evening, she offered flowers and chanted most of the time having us around her as her retinue. The small shrine room in grandmother’s house was also a good hiding place for us as children when we were playing with each other.\n\nIndeed, our grandmother liked her retinue. She was a favorite in the village as well as in surrounding villages; people knew her very cordially and friendly; every journey we take takes longer time since she stops and begins talking with those acquaintances that she meets on the journey. Her habit of taking us with her when she visits temples and relatives was an important aspect of exposing us to many new people and activities. Grandmother had many good social and PR skills that benefitted our family. She was a significant factor in initiating us to Buddhist practices as practised then. My grandmother was instrumental, I think, in influencing the two young boys who decided to join me in the novice ordination. Those two boys were a little bit older than me; they helped me get oriented to novel things in the monastic life in the early stage. Though I was not the youngest in the group of novice ordination candidates, there were many who were older than me.\n\nSurviving as a Young Buddhist Novice\n\nNew life as a young novice was not that easy, particularly, in a large group of ordained persons. Imagine what happens when youngsters of similar age live in one place without much activities for them to engage in. They are still just boys; they are artificially restricted routinely to make them ideal Buddhists and monks. The only and more relaxed opportunity for them to interreact with their peers is the classroom; regular classes take place on the afternoons from Monday to Friday. This new monastic environment restricted freedom as well as liberty in pursuing things. In particular, activities such as music and sports were out of bound. Buddhist monasteries are aimed at cultivating certain values, customs and practices necessary for monastic practice. In that religious ethos, there is little or no space at all in developing each child’s aspirations and goals spiritually or academically. While young members often adapt themselves quickly to new situations, there are always ups and downs; monasteries and monastic schools were not exceptions. Tiny disputes and minor quarrels are not unusual even in the monastery when many young people live together. The young ones, who are dissatisfied with the new environment often decide to go back home; this happens when they are not happy with complex situations that arise among themselves in the monastery.\n\nTraditional Monastic Training\n\nMy initial monastic training took place at Śrī Sudharmōdaya Pirivena (f. 1957), Bandarawela. I entered the Sixth Grade on 31 January 1972. I remained there studying until 15 October 1974. That site was both my residence and place of studies for a year. Since January 1973, however, I was living in Nigrodhārāmaya, Mahaulpata (f. 12 January 1902). In the afternoons after lunch, I used to walk daily about 2–3 miles to reach pirivena[2] for studies. At the monastic school, I had the opportunity to get used to traditional mode of Buddhist learning by heart. Rote learning begins daily in the mornings after breakfast outside formal classroom. I began to memorize texts from Sāmaṇera Baṇadaham Pota (Guidebook for Novice Training in the Dhamma)[3]; after memorizing portions of text, I rehearsed them before the Principal prior to lunch time. This important monastic training practice, in Sinhala identified as vanapot kirīma, (learn by rote)[4] still in operation in well-regulated Buddhist temples outside formal schooling in the monastic school. When I look back, this practice of memorization and learning appears to be the first initiation that I received as a Buddhist monk to become a scholar of religion today. It was a foundation that was built over years. It grounded me well in the tradition. In the afternoons, we had formal schooling in classrooms. In the classroom, a variety of subjects are taught including languages such as Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit, Tamil and English in addition to History and Mathematics. In October 1974, I moved to Wadduwa, a coastal town of Western Province. After a few days, on 8 November 1974, I entered Śrī Saddharmākara Vidyāyatana Pirivena, Panadura (1974–81) and studied there until 27 March 1981. There I acquired many skills such as public speaking and education received there enabled me to complete with distinctions both GCE (OL) and GCE (AL) as well as other examinations in Oriental Studies. This education prepared me well to obtain qualifications to enter University of Peradeniya.\n\nReminiscence of the Past\n\nSince I was twelve or thirteen years old, I was aspiring to become a teacher and writer. I had cultivated an interest in publishing very simple things early on. At the early stage my interest was in publishing things such as poems and vandāna gāthās (verses for devotional practices) that we regularly use in day-to-day worship services. There was a keen interest for sivupada (quatrain) poetry. A new wave of interest in religious poetry was just emerging with Venerable Pānadurē Ariyadhamma’s Bodhipūjā[5](making offerings to the Bodhi tree). Delivering sermons in poetry became popular in 1950s onwards.[6] This early enthusiasm on writing, publication and books probably led me to pursue an academic career two decades later. The entrance to Buddhist monastic life as a young person enabled me and provided me opportunities to pursue scholarly interests to the highest standards.\n\nEntrance to University of Peradeniya amidst Student Struggles and Protests\n\nIn October 1981, I had the opportunity to enter to University of Peradeniya. In the first year, we were at Dumbara Campus, located along Mahaveli River, Polgolla. Those days, I had to travel over an hour by bus from Gannoruwa to Polgolla via Peradeniya. This difficult year of travel and other previous commitments to my temple lasted for a year. Because of old connections that my teacher had nourished in his university days, I had the privilege of living at Gannoruwa Raja Mahā Vihāraya, a few miles distance from University of Peradeniya. In the following year (second year of undergraduate studies), we were taken into the main campus of University of Peradeniya, which made travelling to campus much easier, some days walking all the way to university from the temple. Studying at Peradeniya was a life changer. When I look back, it appears that Peradeniya opened up many opportunities for my later academic life. Our study at Peradeniya took place in the midst of student struggles. Various social, political and educational issues such as the ‘white paper on education’ and an undergraduate student’s death in campus as a result of Police shooting just on the eve emerging long-lasted ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka created a tense atmosphere in campus disrupting education and further rise of student protests. Though the large body of students within university was not hostile to minorities or racist, July 1983 riots[7] took place while I was in my sophomore year as an undergraduate at University of Peradeniya. This had significant impact in leading to closures and arrests of students on political protests. On one occasion, by surprise students took over control of the main university buildings such as the senate and library for a few days at the height of crisis. We were forced to participate in rallies and support student struggle. These pressures and subsequent student protests may have had some political motivations behind the organization.[8] As a result of disruptions and sudden closures of University, our academic year was often extended further. In fact, our graduation did not take place until November 1986 as a consequence of unhealthy political developments within university and beyond.\n\nOpportunity of Studying at University of Peradeniya\n\nIn the freshman year at Dumbara Campus of University of Peradeniya, I studied Buddhist Studies, Western Classics and Economics, in addition to subsidiary subjects of Mathematics and English. In sophomore year, I was selected to specialize in Buddhist Studies. Minor subject of study was Philosophy. During the period of study at University of Peradeniya I had taken courses such as Social and Political Philosophy, Indian Philosophy, World Religions, History of Buddhism. My teachers included Professors Lily de Silva, Ven. Kam̆burupiṭiyē Ariyasēna, Gunapala Dharmasiri, P.D. Premasiri and Merlin Pieris.\n\nAt the University of Peradeniya, I received ample opportunities to improve English skills and broaden my friendships with students. I had precious opportunities to meet professors beyond Faculty of Arts because of my involvement in student associations such as the Buddhist Brotherhood (f. mid-1950s). In addition to my formal education at the university, I was able to participate in University wide extra-curricular activities. As Secretary of the Buddhist Brotherhood, I had closer professional interactions with several faculty members in Faculty of Arts, Science and Medicine. During this time (1984) the Buddhist Brotherhood[9] assisted in establishing the Buddhist Vihāra at University of Peradeniya with the leadership of Venerable Ampiṭiyē Śrī Rāhula (1913–2020). Though the site of present Buddhist Vihāra had been assigned as a Buddhist place of worship from the beginning of the university with the construction of a Buddha statue in the mid-1950s and a stūpa built at the site in 1962, it was not yet adopted as a residence place for Buddhist monastics until mid-1980s.\n\nMy studies at University of Peradeniya was supported by Adeline Moonesinghe Scholarship (1981/82) and Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship (1981–85). As class of 1985, I had graduated from University of Peradeniya with First Class Honours in Bachelor of Arts degree in Buddhist Studies. At the graduation, as batch-top, I received Bachelor of Arts Degree Scholarship (1985).\n\nAs honours requirement, I wrote an undergraduate thesis entitled Nirvāṇaya saha sadācāraya, which Professor P.D. Premasiri of Department of Philosophy supervised. As an undergraduate at University of Peradeniya, I cultivated the habit of writing to vernacular newspapers and other publication outlets. I recall today first few academic articles in Sinhala appeared in Budusaraṇa.[10] In July 1986, I received my first university appointment as a lecturer in Buddhist Monasticism and Social and Political Philosophy of Buddhism at Vidyōdaya Institute of Pali and Buddhist University of Sri Lanka. While teaching and working in postgraduate studies, I revised my undergraduate thesis for publication as Nirvāṇaya saha sadācāraya (Deepani, Nugegoda, xii+97). The publication was assisted by a financial grant from Sri Lanka Library Services Board. The book was well received in the Sri Lankan academy resulting including it in bibliographies assigned in university examinations. In fact, until today it is the most popular publication of mine in Sri Lanka.\n\nAt the higher ordination ceremony, I presented the first publication of the book to the council of theras (seniors) and in return it offered me an honorary title named “Vimalakīrtī Śrī.” It is a usual custom of saṅgha councils to offer honorary titles for monks for their exceptional work. Ironically, I have never used the received honorary title along with my name as the usual custom with most Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka. In the study abroad and working part-time at the Authority Control of the Regenstein Library of The University of Chicago, I noted a range of difficulties that arise in cataloguing scholarly work. As a result, I began to use a simple designation for myself in a more American style as Mahinda Deegalle, taking my village as family name.\n\nComparative Study of Religions at Peradeniya\n\nIn my sophomore year at University of Peradeniya, for the first time, I had the opportunity to meet people who belong to an interfaith group in Kandy. This was quite useful for me then to expand my knowledge in English and experience of non-Buddhist religions. Though I had met many Christians before, it was the first serious encounter with Christianity and its practitioners. This initial exposure to non-Asian religions encouraged me to pursue a post-graduate degree in Comparative Religion later.\n\nAn attempt to establish Comparative Study of Religions as an academic discipline in the Sri Lankan university system got underway after the July 1983 ethnic riots. The discipline of “Comparative Religion” was new to Sri Lanka. The first Comparative Religion programme in Sri Lanka was launched in the academic year of 1985–1986 at University of Peradeniya. It was the first “Comparative Study of Religion” programme in South Asia and was designed as a graduate studies programme at Master level. The international adviser to the comparative study of religion in Sri Lanka was the late Professor Ninian Smart (1927–2001) of University of Lancaster. The Sri Lankan academic expert who took the leading role of guiding the project of the comparative study of religion at University of Peradeniya was Professor M.W. Padmasiri De Silva. He was assisted by the late Professor Gunapala Dharmasiri (1940–2015) and Professor P.D. Premasiri along with several scholars from the university departments. In Sri Lanka, the established academic norm had been that a single religious tradition is studied in depth in one academic department of the university. In Sinhala, the newly introduced academic discipline was designated as ‘tulanātmaka āgam.’ The new academic designation of ‘Comparative Religion,’ as a discipline in which a variety of religions are studied in comparative perspective, caught attention of a larger group of academics and students in university contexts. The academic discipline of comparative study of religions had become an absolute necessity for pluralist society in contemporary Sri Lanka. Though Buddhism is the majority religion, modern Sri Lanka has become increasing pluralist and diverse. Now it is home to four major world religions. Given the pluralist ethnic and religious setting, it is essential today that citizens of Sri Lanka develop religious literacy. Sri Lanka with a secular government, where religion is a significant aspect of private and public life, religious literacy is in demand. Though everyone may not have opportunity of studying religions systematically, the development of religious literacy has become a priority in education. Greater understanding of each other’s religious beliefs, practices, doctrines, and customs can potentially increase ethnic and religious harmony and cohesion by facilitating smooth communication among religious and ethnic groups. This can be successfully achieved and enhanced by developing comparative study of religions. Rather than studying one tradition alone in isolation from others, which has been the norm in Sri Lankan academic institutions, studying several traditions in comparative perspective may prove beneficial for co-existence and mutual harmony.\n\nSuitability of Peradeniya for the new MA in Comparative Religion programme was obvious. University of Peradeniya represented both ethnic and religious diversity. It offered undergraduate programmes in all three media—Sinhala, Tamil and English. Both the student and faculty bodies included members of all religions and ethnic groups represented in the country. Surrounding areas also included both ethnic and religious diversity. The new programme was housed in a relatively neutral home at Department of Philosophy drawing expertise from several disciplines of Faculty of Arts.\n\nThe MA Programme in Comparative Religion was a two-year postgraduate research degree programme. In year 1, students were introduced to three areas of study: (i) Introduction to the Comparative Study of Religion, (ii) Doctrine, Practice and the History of Buddhism, and (iii) Philosophy of Religion. Because of the very location in Philosophy Department and Professor Smart’s involvement in designing the programme, methodologically, Comparative Religion programme had an emphasis on philosophical approaches to religion.\n\nThe teaching programme began on 28th February 1986. Initial problems in establishing any programme of Comparative Religion is finding appropriate fully trained and qualified teaching faculty. Visiting scholars from Fulbright scheme and ISLE programme were incorporated into teaching staff. For example, Professor Harry Wells (Humbolt University) taught us Introduction to Comparative Religion; Professor Arthur Ledoux taught Philosophy of Religions and Professor John S. Strong (Bates College) was responsible for teaching Theory and Method in the Study of Religions. This programme draw several prominent scholars for delivering courses. Local staff from Philosophy, Pāli and Buddhist Studies, History, Sociology, Islamic Studies and Archaeology covered relevant areas of study. Three academics of University of Peradeniya who closely involved in the teaching programme were Professor M.W. Padmasiri de Silva, Professor Gunapala Dharmasiri and Professor P.D. Premasiri.\n\nThe first cohort in the programme was an enthusiastic small group of students. There were five full-time postgraduate students. I was the youngest in the group and the only one, who had just completed the undergraduate programme at the University of Peradeniya. All other four students—three males and one female—had finished their undergraduate studies at the University of Peradeniya or abroad. Except me, all of them were working in teaching jobs at the University of Peradeniya or elsewhere. In the five-member cohort, two male students were Philosophy lecturers. One was a Hindu and the other was a Muslim, both of whom had finished their undergraduate degree in Philosophy at University of Peradeniya in Tamil medium. One of them was teaching Philosophy at University of Peradeniya and the other was teaching Philosophy at University of Jaffna. Two of the postgraduate students were teaching English as a second language in English sub-unit of the University of Peradeniya. The male student had obtained an undergraduate degree in South India and the female student had completed her undergraduate degree in abroad. In terms of availability for participating in all aspects of the teaching programme and university wide activities, I was the only fulltime student who could devote fully to the study of comparative religion as a newcomer to this new field of studies. Before my departure to the United States for postgraduate studies in Comparative Religion, I had participated in all the teaching sessions and had taken the first-year examination in three first year courses.\n\nBy February of 1987, University of Peradeniya offered me Gate Mudliya A.G. Tillekeratne Postgraduate Research Scholarship for continuing my studies in the MA programme. My topic of research for the dissertation was “A Comparative Study of the Concept of Salvation in Christianity and Liberation from Suffering in Buddhism.” I had to withdraw from the programme because I left for postgraduate studies in the US. The study of Comparative Religion at Peradeniya provided me a basic foundation for continuing my postgraduate studies at Harvard and Chicago. This experience remained to influence and shape me in following decades in the study and research in the history of religions.\n\nTravelling to the US for Studies\n\nOn 5 August 1987, my life entered into a ground-breaking phase. It was a significant shift in my unfolding academic career. I was one of the few privileged to secure a prestigious scholarship to go abroad for post-graduate studies to the United States. I was to study Comparative Religion at Harvard. My ambition to know more about religious traditions beyond Buddhism and Hinduism took me to the United States of America. I was admitted to specialize in the area of Comparative Religion under Master of Theological Studies Programme at Harvard Divinity School (1987–89).\n\nAt that time the Sri Lankan state began to crumble down into fragmentation as a result of signing up the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord by Rajiv Gandhi (1944–1991), Prime Minister of India and J.R. Jayawardene (1906–1996), President of Sri Lanka on 29 July 1987. I was leaving behind many sad episodes that others experienced over a two-year period culminating in 1989. By leaving the country for the first time on 5 August 1987, I avoided a turmoiled and chaotic period of history in Contemporary Sri Lanka. On that chaotic time period, my departure from Sri Lanka for graduate studies in the United States was a blessing in disguise. Most young monks of our batch and others that I knew at the University disappeared without any trace during the time of upheaval; some gave up robes, others were killed in the period of violence.\n\nThe Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord resulted in a wave of serious violence from the beginning of August 1987 to the early part of 1990s.[11] Even the assassination of the late President R. Premadasa (1924–1993) by the LTTE is partly related to that episode. As a democratic and peaceful society, Sri Lanka was gradually diminished and plunged into waves of serious violation of human rights abuses and disappearances of many youth and assassinations of prominent politicians, diplomats, statesmen and prominent religious leaders. On hindsight, my study abroad—studying Comparative Religion at Harvard—saved my life; it also gave me ample opportunities to ground myself in Buddhist Studies and in the discipline of History of Religions. The space of two years at Harvard saved me from a lot of unnecessary trouble ensued in Sri Lanka in terms of political violence following the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord. Harvard provided me peace and tranquility as well as many inspirations, insights and opportunities to develop as a rigorous scholar as a result of interactions with eminent academics and bright students.\n\nThough now it is an ordinary and negligible thing, merely a brief travel in air for most, flying for the first time in route to the US was a significant excitement on those days for a young person from Sri Lanka. That journey not only enabled me to go abroad, it gave me an opportunity to land briefly in Bangkok. I was excited of that exposure of Southeast Asian Buddhist society. When I look back on those days and travel matters, it seems things have changed significantly over last three decades. At that time, there were many restrictions in Sri Lanka on overseas travel: in particular, how much money each traveler can carry when one goes abroad was strictly restricted. The availability of foreign currency was limited and regulated. All information of foreign currency taken out from Sri Lanka was recorded in passport. My passport also recorded a figure of US $320.00. In contrast, today anybody could take away $10,000.00 from Sri Lanka without any documentation.\n\nMy first journey to the United States was a long one. It appears the entire journey took nearly three days. On the way to the US, I had the first one-night stop in Bangkok. I was able to go to the city and stay in Bangkok for one night. I noticed how different Bangkok was in comparison to Colombo. In the night, there was so much action and dynamism on streets with shops open late into night in Bangkok. We landed briefly in Tokyo for a few hours before departing to San Francisco. My arrival in the US was through San Francisco. The Fulbright Foundation required me to attend a three-week orientation programme organized at the University of California, Davis (August 1987). After landing in San Francisco, I went through customs; I was scheduled to take another small flight to Sacramento to reach UC Davis. Flying in a smaller flight was quite exciting; I could see land and farms from air. For a beginner in the air travel, it was a too-long trip. Travelling nearly three days was long and I was exhausted; but there were moments of excitement in the journey which I enjoyed.\n\nSharpening Skills at Harvard\n\nOn a rainy and cloudy day, in the evening of 5 September 1987, I walked into my room in the Divinity Hall (Cambridge, Massachusetts) from Logan airport. It was not yet winter but was cold. For the first time I experienced something that I had not felt before in the same manner. A sense of emptiness enveloped me and the whole personality was surrounded with loneliness and tiredness. There in Room No. 2 located on the ground floor, I was left with a bed, table, and chair. I had my baggage with clothes suitable for year-round hot weather and not for winter. For the first time, not knowing anyone around me, in a lonely place, I felt that I was truly alone in a land far away from home.\n\nBecoming familiar with American customs was a constant learning experience. Since it was the first time that I was living outside Sri Lanka for a longer period and studying with non-Sri Lankan students, for me everything was new. In Sri Lanka people often greet Buddhist monks by bowing down. The monk usually blesses them saying “sukhī suvapat vēvā,” which means “May you live with happiness!” But in America it was a different situation: I had to cultivate the habit of saying “Good morning!” and “Have a nice day!” and shake hands. To some people these kinds of daily routine-activities are quite mundane, but to me they were radically different customs that I was forced to embrace by social conventions. On another perspective, I went from holding a respected social position in Sri Lankan society to being an ordinary person in a large university system.\n\nI had to learn many things, acquire many skills, both personal and academic levels. I believe that I had several virtues: flexibility, agility, endurance and perseverance. I had to develop many skills quickly in order to survive in that competitive environment. While struggling what I noticed was that almost everyone in the Divinity School Community was very positive towards me. Everyone helped me to be successful in my academic and social life. While I was reading the Bible in some of the classes and with serious critical comments on it both from the staff and students, I could see the way at least some of the elite Protestant Christians were practising their religious life at the University as well as in other social settings when I often received invitations for meals and festivals from fellow students and their parents.\n\nAfter two years of close interaction with me in the dormitory, classrooms and social gatherings, most students began appreciating me as a person as well as a Buddhist. A testimony to that effect followed later from the student body. The best token of appreciation of me from fellow American students took place at the eve of graduation ceremony at Harvard Divinity School. The student body of the graduating class of the Divinity School selected me as the valedictorian at the 1989 commencement. Valedictorian address took place on 7 June 1989.[12] The graduating class selected me for the baccalaureate sermon perhaps due to students’ curiosity about my life as a Buddhist monk; and perhaps due to their interest in knowing my reflections on Harvard because they knew that I had come from a different academic, cultural, religious, and social environment.\n\nIn discussing my two-year experience at Harvard, I talked about my encounter with American religious pluralism. I also reflected upon how that encounter had broadened my understanding of not only other religious traditions but also my own. The purpose of speaking about my experiences there was then was not only to bring the perspective of a particular foreign student to the fore, but it also to show that in a pluralistic society, people share many common feelings of separation and alienation. In some sense, in many circumstances, we all become foreigners in a society whose ideal is pluralism. I went to Harvard in order to experience a pluralistic community and study in a diverse intellectual environment. I was not aware that that intellectual journey would cause me both joy and pain. Having watched my friends and colleagues over years, I felt that I had not been alone in that struggle. We had to accommodate ourselves to very different concerns and lifestyles.\n\nLet me share with you some of the things that I had gained and come to value during my studies at Harvard. Learning about pluralism is more than just learning other people’s traditions. The pluralist nature of Harvard broadened my understanding of Buddhism, too. Because of my exposure and experience at Harvard I was able to see Buddhism as a pan-cultural religion by going beyond my own Theravāda Buddhist perspective. At Harvard I met living representatives of various Buddhist traditions and learnt from them about them. I also read a lot of materials on Buddhist traditions in my classes. Some of the courses taken in Buddhist traditions included Professor M. Nagatomi’s “An Introduction to Indian Buddhism,” “The History of Buddhism in East Asia,” and “Selected Texts from the Abhidharma, Madhyamika, and Yogacara” and Professor D. Eckel’s “The History of Buddhism in India and Tibet” and “The Origins of the Mahāyāna.” These orientations caused me to rethink of Buddhism in a different light. The broadening of understanding of my own tradition—Buddhism—was one of the significant benefits gained at Harvard. This expanded and critical understanding of one’s own tradition was expected in learning of world religious traditions and something shared by all students.\n\nIn my learning experience at Harvard I had been impressed by new approaches towards the study of religion, such as feminist theology, liberation theology, and different perspectives on interfaith dialogue. I had the opportunity to take courses offered by the later Professor Annemarie Schimmel (“Introduction to the Phenomenology of Religion”) and Professor Diana L. Eck (“World Religions: Diversity and Dialogue”). I was also greatly benefited from my colleagues who embraced different lifestyles and worldviews such as gays and lesbians, black students and other minorities, persons with disabilities, diverse non-Christian groups, and many others.\n\nThe two years of study at Harvard enabled me to see things that I had not seen before. I learnt a great deal of religious traditions and a variety of academic perspectives on Buddhism and religions. I also came to know a lot about people with complex life styles. The experience at Harvard broadened my perspectives and provided a useful skill set in furthering my career.\n\nLiving in Christian Environments\n\nOver three decades I have lived, studied, taught and worked in primarily Christian academic environments in the USA and Europe. Let me briefly reflect upon my experience with Christians and what I came to learn from them and appreciate them as a result of deeper engagement with them as a participant of common and shared grounds of Inter-religious Dialogue in particular.\n\nExcept for four years, since 1987, I have been living primarily among Protestant Christians. Some Christians had been my housemates; some were my teachers; some others were my neighbors; some were also my colleagues; and some are still my students. In various capacities, whoever I met I have enjoyed their company. I have learnt from them a great deal about their Christian practices. I have shared their friendships and benefited from their warm hospitality and warm-heartedness. To challenge myself, at Harvard, I had studied the Bible both the Hebrew Bible (“Introduction to the Bible: Old Testament” by T. Hiebert) and New Testament (“The New Testament: An Historical Introduction” by B. Brooten) as well as various forms of Theology (“Symbolization of Christ” by R. Niebuhr and “Spirituality for Clergy” by K. Stendahl) including Feminist approaches to religion as a preparation for a teaching career at University level. As a Buddhist monk, living among Christians, I have witnessed practices as well as manifestations of Christian message in various forms and shapes.\n\nWhile I have read the history of Christianity from the time of Jesus Christ to the modern developments in Europe, I have come to know its ups and downs when it combines and influences medieval states. I continued to appreciate tolerant aspects of Christianity and its rich ethical foundations. Most of Christians that I came across in my academic life are fairly decent and open-minded individuals who are eager also to know more about Buddhism. What is fascinating about Christian practitioners is that they were eager to meet new people and willing to share with others their religion by reaching out to non-Christians.\n\nParticipation of Interfaith Work\n\nDuring the last three decades, I had a lot of opportunities to work with many inter-faith groups both in Sri Lanka and abroad. As a graduate student, living in the Divinity Hall (No. 14 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA), coming to know that Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) had given a controversial address there in 1838 resulting his departure from Harvard, was a quite astonishing story. I was living in Room No. 2 on the ground floor of the building. The famous chapel was located in the second floor. Every Sunday evening, with my fellow residents, I participated in the Christian service in the chapel. On Sundays, in particular, I could observe the active religiosity of my fellow residents. Some of my fellow residents were planning ministerial career by completing Master of Divinity degree. A 1/3 of us were preparing for an academic career in Religious Studies and were pursuing Master of Theological Studies degree.\n\nAt that time, with her research and publications, Professor Diana Eck was very active in inter-religious dialogue. She was gracious to introduce me to the Dialogue Unit of World Council of Churches. I was invited to a Multi-Faith Dialogue Conference of the World Council of Churches held at Y.M.C.A., Hong Kong (11–18 August 1990) and subsequently to The Seventh Assembly of the World Council of Churches held at Australian National University, Canberra, Australia (7–20 February 1991). Then I was invited again to Encuentro Mundial de Embajadores Religiosos held in Tiwanaku, Bolivia (19–24 June 1992). Over years, the WCC has sponsored the Thinking Together interfaith forum. Its publications included my contributions.[13] Protestant Christians have been keen on dialogue with non-Christian religious practitioners. Interreligious dialogue and cooperation among religions are essential ingredients in today’s complex global religious contexts. They can function as important steps in discovering respect for humanity and protecting the legacy of each religious tradition.\n\nDoctoral Training at The University of Chicago\n\nThe six-year training at doctoral programme at The University of Chicago became a solid foundation for me to become as a scholar of religion. The programme in the History of Religions aimed at studying manifestations of religious phenomena in human history. Each scholar was required to develop a general interest in certain key methodological and comparative problem within the discipline while at the same time developing an interest in a particular area of specialization. In September 1989, I was admitted to The University of Chicago Divinity School. Though I entered the programme with a Master degree, in the first year, I was required to pass examinations on the history of Christian traditions required for new entrants to the MA programme. Because of previous work, the examination on “Scriptures of the West” was waived. Early on in summer 1989 I still needed to prepare for the examination on “Western Religious Traditions to 1500” so that I could pass it and concentrate on doctoral studies.\n\nThe doctoral training in Chicago included demonstrating proficiency in relevant research languages by passing examinations at least in two European languages. In my case, it was reading proficiency in French and German. In addition to European languages, doctoral candidates must also demonstrate their proficiency in relevant research languages. In my case, the language of specialization was Sanskrit; I took “Advanced Sanskrit” and reading Mīmaṃsā literature with Professor Sheldon Pollock, with Professor Wendy Doniger reading Mahābhārata and with Professor Paul J. Griffiths reading Yogācāra texts.\n\nEach doctoral student in History of Religions must demonstrate their skills in methodology by taking a colloquium with a faculty member. Most of us selected “Problems in History of Religions” led by the late Professor Frank E. Reynolds (1930–2019). In each quarter, students were expected to read a paper to the colloquium participants. Colloquium paper is written and distributed in advance for the interrogation and discussion to be pursued by fellow students at the colloquium.\n\nIn addition to the requirements courses taken during the doctoral studies included (i) Cultural Comparison: History and Theories (J. Smith), (ii) Time & Space in History of Religions (G. Ebersole), (iii) Cultural History of India to 1400 (R. Inden), (iv) Cultural History of India, Classical) (S. Pollock), (v) Myth and Law in Hinduism (W. Doniger), (vi) Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia 5th–15th c (L. Gunawardāna), (vii) Buddhological Studies: Paul Mus (F. Reynolds), (viii) History and Structure of Buddhism (F. Reynolds), (ix) Buddhahood: Doctrinal Development (P. Griffiths), (x) Emptiness: Mahāyāna Buddhism (M. Tachikawa), (xi) Translation Workshop for South Asianists (A. Ramanujan), (xii) Religious Studies in Modern World (L. Sullivan), (xiii) Religious Thought and Modernity (W. Doniger), (xiv) Modern Study of Religion (G. Ebersole), and (xv) Western Religious Traditions 1500–1870 (D. Tracy). I also had a seminar with Professor Steven Collins and audited a few courses that he offered.\n\nTo become a candidate to the doctoral studies, I had to pass Qualifying Examinations in History of Religions. As of 1987, Qualifying Examinations in History of Religions included five written examinations. As explained below two examinations were compulsory (i and v) for all history of religions students. My list of five examinations and list of readings for each in June 1992 included the following: (i) Methods and History of the History of Religions: Basic Texts, (ii) Comparative Studies: Myth and Symbol (Secondary Texts), and (iii) Comparative Studies: Practice and Community Life, (iv) Comparative Religious Ethics and (v) Special Area: Buddhism. History of Religions students in the special area of Buddhism were required to prepare a bibliography of 20 books at least. Such a bibliography was a minimum requirement for each student in each examination. Each examination lasted for four hours, staggered over a two-week period, each taking place every other day of the working week. After two-weeks of written examination, there was a two-hour oral examination. For the oral examination, each student was required to submit an Oral Statement paper two weeks in advance. The requirement was that the oral statement paper must be in an area outside of the area of one’s Ph.D. dissertation. My oral examination paper submitted on 24 May 1993 was on the theme of “Religious Renewal and Resistance in Bolivian Nativistic Religions.” This paper was based on the research that I conducted during my participation in Encuentro Mundial de Embajadores Religiosos held in Tiwanaku. For all of the Qualifying examinations, I had to read widely and it was a period of trying and testing.\n\nAfter passing PhD Qualifying Examinations, students are admitted as candidates for the degree. Only then, they are able to enter into field and archival research for writing the doctoral dissertation. For writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Buddhist preaching, I conducted archival and library research in the British Library (Hugh Nevil Collection), SOAS, Welcome Institute (London), University of Oxford and University of Cambridge in Autumn 1994. The research was supported by an Overseas Dissertation Research Fellowship offered by The University of Chicago. The dissertation completed in summer 1995 was entitled as Baṇa: Buddhist Preaching in Sri Lanka (Special Focus on the Two-pulpit Tradition). An updated and revised version was later published as Popularizing Buddhism: Preaching as Performance in Sri Lanka (State University of New York Press, 2006). I am grateful to The University of Chicago for supporting me financially by granting me a tuition waiver scholarship as well International House Residential Fellowship (1989–92)[14] and COSAS Dissertation Support Fellowship (1993–95) so that I could complete the doctoral degree. When I was struggling on various fronts at various stages of doctoral studies, I had immense support of Professor Sheldon Pollock (now in Columbia University), Professor John C. Holt (Bowdoin College), Professor Gananath Obeyesekere (Princeton University) as well as Professor H.L. Seneviratne (University of Virginia).\n\nThe Study of Religion in a Non-Buddhist Context\n\nDiscussing my learning experience as a graduate student in the History of Religions and as a practising Sri Lankan Theravāda Buddhist monk may be relevant. As a monk and academic, I see a great deal of importance in studying religions beyond the study of Buddhism; in particular, the value of studying religions in a non-Buddhist context like the Divinity schools. Since I spent over eight years in two prominent Divinity schools—Harvard and Chicago—I would like to give my reflections both on problems and advantages of being a graduate student in History of Religions in the West.\n\nLet me explain why I went to pursue a doctoral degree at The University of Chicago Divinity School. It was indeed a personal ambition. As a young Buddhist monk, growing up in Sri Lanka, I found a personal need to expand my spiritual and intellectual horizons. I was not content with learning only Theravāda Buddhism. I wanted to have a more comprehensive and comparative understanding of Buddhist traditions of Asia, in particular, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna. This was the primary personal, spiritual, and intellectual motivation which led me to graduate school in the US. In addition, I had an interest in learning religious traditions of the world; this was a challenge for myself and an urgent necessity for the society in Sri Lanka. More than in the past, in the twentieth century, Sri Lankan multi-ethnic and pluralistic religious contexts have forced all Sri Lankans, in particular, Buddhist monks to learn neighbors’ religions; they are expected to have cultural literacy to be able to appreciate diversity and richness that those religions produce by enriching cultural heritage of Sri Lanka. This practical necessity was the secondary motivation for learning world religions at Harvard and Chicago.\n\nI entered the doctoral program in Chicago because of its strengths for the study of religions: its strong emphasis on methodology, its assertions on the importance of socio-historical contexts of religious phenomena and its insistence on the value of myths and rituals for understanding the religiosity of people. The most notable advantage was that The University of Chicago had a long tradition of rigorous intellectual training—a strong tradition of history of religions. As I mentioned earlier Chicago program emphasized more methodology and demanded critical inquiry and independent thinking.\n\nLet us examine closely the religion programme in Chicago. At the outset, all programs in the Divinity School demanded a rigorous and sound basic training in Western religions. The training in Western religious traditions is compulsory for every student. For a Buddhist monk, in particular, this kind of training is extremely valuable because he should know the way Westerners think. Indeed, a profound knowledge in Western religious traditions would help immensely in explaining Buddhism to Westerners. This is not for converting them to Buddhism but make available basic teachings of the Buddha. To accomplish this task, a good grasp of conceptual background is necessary.\n\nThe History of Religions programme emphasized two key things: each student was expected to be simultaneously both a generalist and specialist in the field of religion. The coursework, exams, colloquiums, qualifying exams were structured to meet these ends. To enable students to marshal resources from a wide range of areas, the History of Religions faculty instructed students to demonstrate their skills as Historians of Religions by writing the oral exam paper outside their area of expertise. It is usually a substantial paper of 30 pages. This was one of the nicest intellectually motivating experiences that I had in the History of Religions programme in Chicago. l wrote the oral examination paper on South American religions—the Aymara of Bolivia—basing on my field trip to Tiwanaku. It focused on Tiwanaku, the major religious center of the Aymara, and their encounters with Catholic missionaries since the sixteenth century. My research focused on the confrontation of missionaries and the Aymara’s of South America. This was a great learning experience. To a certain extent, this research on the Aymara and missionaries helped me to view the issues that were related to colonialism and missions back at home in Sri Lanka in a new light.\n\nThe learning experience that I had in Chicago helped me better perform. As a Theravāda Buddhist monk, now I am able to present myself with confidence as a historian of religions. The critical methods learnt and acquired in Chicago enabled me to bring fresh approaches to my studies in Sinhala medieval Buddhist literature. The training in Western religious traditions enabled me to teach at a British university and more broadly to understand the way of thinking of Western people and engage in interfaith work. It enabled me to respond to issues and concerns with integrity. In addition, all skills acquired in Chicago are immensely useful in presenting myself as a scholarly Buddhist monk who may fit to the traditional image of a bahuśruta[15] (Sin. learned), a person who has read, heard, and learnt a lot and experienced many things, thus well-informed.\n\nIn Sri Lankan secular universities, though there is a great ethnic and religious diversity, there still exists difficulties in attracting students from diverse Buddhist traditions and religious traditions of the world. From this, it is obvious what the Advantages were in studying Chicago. Chicago had the advantage of having diverse faith communities. The intellectual and religious atmosphere in Chicago was very pluralist, diverse, and rich.\n\nJapan First Hand: Experience of Mahāyāna Buddhism and Beyond\n\nAs a Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai post-doctoral fellow (1995–96) the generous financial support that I received enabled me to open my eyes to see and appreciate rich Japanese religious world. The fellowship invitation letter came from the late Professor Gadjin M. Nagao, Emeritus of Kyoto University. At that time all degree requirements for the doctoral degree at The University of Chicago were already out of the way. I was ready to accept challenges of post-doctoral research since my doctoral dissertation near completion. There were no obstacles to restrict my research. It was an open field for any pursuits while conducting research in Japan. I had plenty of opportunities for field research as well as textual studies. Kindness shown and intellectual guidance provided to me in Japan were amazing. Many Japanese Buddhist scholars and institutions were very generous towards me.\n\nGoing to Japan was a rare opportunity and a long-anticipated one. I wanted to enhance my knowledge of Japanese Buddhism as well as to become familiar with its rich cultural traditions. That decision to go to Japan as a post-doctoral fellow eventually changed drastically my teaching specialization and research trajectory.\n\nA year of research in Kyoto was immensely profitable. As a result of observing dynamics of a fluid religious heritage of one and a half millennium old, it turned out to be my research in Japan was not merely a pure academic interest; I was also in search for meaning in life. There was an interest in search for human spirituality which transcended class, creed, nationality, religious affiliations and boundaries. What I witnessed there and came to appreciate over years through close observations and participation in day-to-day activities with fellow Japanese students, researchers and teachers became a kind of ‘religious’ or practical experience; the experience that I gained there is somewhat hard to explain in words or put into writing like this. Practical wisdom I gained there to live well and function effectively in a university setting was an eye-opener. Ingenuity that I acquired in Japan enabled me in subsequent decades to be a productive scholar in both research and writing.\n\nProfessor Katsumi Mimaki graciously provided facilities for me for a year of stay in the academic setting at Faculty Arts at Kyoto University. Professor Yoneo Isshi, whom I had met in Chicago earlier, at that time was President of a Japanese University in Kobe, acted as my guarantor. He also appointed me as a research fellow at Sophia University, where he had worked before retirement. During the year, many Japanese and non-Japanese scholars, students and commoners in Kyoto extended their generous support to make my research and life in Kyoto become memorable. The year of research and life experience at Kyoto definitely added some needed strength to my academic career, spirituality and purpose in life.\n\nHaving received Foreign Language Enhancement Grant for Japanese Language Learning (1990), though I had learnt some Japanese in Chicago and had taken several courses in Japanese Buddhism and East Asian culture, it was the first time that I travelled to Japan to live there for a longer period. I planned to stay in Kyoto at least a year in order to study Buddhism, Buddhist practices and Japanese culture through close participant observation. I was ready to leave behind my preconceived ideas, baggage and assumptions of Japan and the Japanese. While in Japan, learning Japanese language at Kyōtō Nihongo Gakkō gave me further tools to see and appreciate Japanese culture and Buddhism in practice in the midst of modernity. I did not limit my research interest only to the study of classical Buddhist texts but wanted to explore Japan, Japanese culture and Buddhism thoroughly in their totality; I was receptive to modern adaptations and innovations both in theory and practice. During my year of stay in Kyoto, I was expecting the unexpected.\n\nWhat I achieved within a year was remarkable. My accomplishments were not only in the area of research but also included enhancement of personal understanding and development of interpersonal skills in day-to-day activities. Life in Kyoto was rich both in spirituality and academic rigor. Though many young Japanese often would say that they are not ‘religious’ at all, I was able to observe how certain segments of Japanese society were keen in religion, in particular, in new religions such as Agonshū and Mahikari. These new religious places were full of young people, including Kyoto University students; some of the new religious groups around Kyoto and beyond pursued a variety of religious practices that are not traditionally located within Mahāyāna Buddhist traditions. I had a Japanese host family, Mr. Ueno, his wife and children, who supported me in Kyoto from the very beginning of my stay there. They had their spiritual teacher in Morioka and friends who practiced with them in Kyoto. They had actively participated with some other groups in Japan by promoting the practice of chanting Karaṇīyametta Sutta (‘Discourse on Loving Kindness,’ Suttanipāta vv. 143–152). They also presented the Pāli text in Siddham (bonji) characters in maṇḍala form in decorations such as calligraphy and silk paintings. The eclectic nature of religious observances that I observed and explored within religious lives of people who came from various walks of life was rather astonishing and was not well represented in textbook studies of Japanese Buddhism.\n\nAs a scholar of history of religions, I had an open-ended and exploratory attitude towards many things that I encountered in Japan. Rather than planning anything rigidly, I desired to open up opportunities to learn more from new situations. I was keen to immerse in the Japanese culture by tasting various Japanese delicacies, participating in religious rituals and observing Japanese customs. I appreciated simplicity, sincerity, care and thriftiness that I witnessed in people that I met. While in Kyoto, I never missed any important festivals whether it was Buddhist or Shinto. I was keen to photograph religious and cultural events that I witnessed in Kyoto throughout the year. They were useful for me later in teaching Japanese religions and Buddhism at Bath Spa University and Antioch programme. Observing religious festivals gave me a great sense of closeness and enthusiasm. I could relate to some of those festivals and ceremonies about which I had read much earlier as a student of history of religions at Chicago.\n\nThe most outstanding gain that I had in Kyoto during 1995–96 was time to reflect upon my completed doctoral research. I was able to evaluate critically my previous research. As a result, I rewrote some of my previous research for publication in academic journals. Some of such publications were: (i) “Buddhist Preaching: Rethinking of History of Religions Categories,” Transactions of the International Conference of Eastern Studies 41 (1996): 42–59, (ii) “Vernacular Buddhism: Neglected Sources in the Study of Sri Lankan Theravāda,” Journal of the Japanese Association for South Asian Studies 9 (1997): 69–101, (iii) “Buddhist Preaching and Sinhala Religious Rhetoric,” Numen 44 (1997): 180–210, and (iv) “Reconsidering Buddhist Preaching: Baṇa Tradition in Sri Lanka,” Recent Researches in Buddhist Studies: Essays in Honour of Professor Y. Karunadasa, (eds.) K. Dhammajoti et al. (Colombo, 1997), pp. 427–53.\n\nIn relation to research in Buddhism, the most important achievement was new contacts that I established with scholars in Buddhist Studies and Indian Studies. I met many scholars in academic conferences that I attended such as the International Conference of Eastern Studies (Toho Gakkai), Tibetan and Buddhist Studies Conference (Risshō University), Indian Philosophy Conference (Kyoto University), Tibetan Studies Conference (Ōtani University), and The Annual Conference of The Society for the Study of Pāli and Buddhist Culture (Koyasan University).\n\nIn addition to delivering public lectures and attending conferences, I also had the opportunity to present my research in following locations: (i) “Buddhist Preaching: Rethinking of History of Religions Categories” at the 41st International Conference of Eastern Studies, Tokyo, (ii) “Christian-Buddhist Encounter in the 19th Century Sri Lanka,” Institute of Asian Cultures, Sophia University, (iii) “Buddhist Preaching in Sri Lanka: What Did Medieval Buddhists Preach?” Asian Studies Group, NCC Center for Japanese Religions, Kyoto, and (iv) “Reconsidering Buddhist Preaching,” at the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, Tokyo.\n\nIn terms of enhancing my training in philological work, the weekly research seminar that I attended at Ryūkoku University was important. I attended the seminar with the invitation of late Professor Gadjin M. Nagao (1907–2005). We read Asaṅga’s Mahāyāna Sūtrālaṅkāra with his long-term students of several generations. I had an excellent opportunity to learn Japanese philological methods in the study of Indian Mahāyāna texts. The participants were very careful readers who read relevant Tibetan and Chinese versions of that text with care and seriousness to ascertain accuracy of the Indian text. It was intellectually as well as socially a fascinating experience when Professor Nagao was also present and became a great host despite his advanced age and seniority in Japanese society.\n\nFrom the arrival in Kyoto in September 1995, I was initiated in understanding intricacies of Japanese lifestyle and academic contexts of Buddhist Studies in Japan and Europe by Mr. Robert Duquene, whom I had met earlier at the University of Chicago when he took up the post as Numata Professor and his colleague the late Professor Hubert Durt (1936–2018) of the École Française d’Extrême-Orient (f. 1907). They also introduced me to late Dr. Antonino Forte (1940–2006) of the Italian School of East Asian Studies in Kyoto and accompanied me to temples and sites when they got an opportunity. When I had serious questions on Japanese Buddhism and religions, they were my instructors.\n\nIn terms of further exposure to rich Japanese religious traditions, my participation in the one-week long Religious Studies field trip (shūkyogaku jisshū) of Tsukuba University to the eighty-eight pilgrimage sites in Shikoku in August 1996 was an exceptionally rewarding experience. The purpose of fieldwork-oriented pilgrimage in Shikoku was understanding the role of charismatic leadership associated with Kūkai. This tour of nine faculty members and 26 students was a course requirement in Religious Studies at Tsukuba. I attended the fieldtrip with invitation of the late Professor Michio Araki and Professor Masakazu Tanatsugu, both of whom I had met in Chicago and established cordial relationships with them. In addition, there I was personally introduced to another new religious group popular in Japan and found in Shikoku, too. In seminars students discussed a variety religious aspects of Shikoku pilgrimage from history of religions perspectives by presenting their research for three nights, each of which lasted for two hours after meals.\n\nOn the whole, a year of post-doctoral research in Japan gave me an opportunity to explore Japanese Buddhism and religions in their immediate contexts. The experience that I had in Japan strengthened my academic career as a researcher as well as a teacher in Buddhism and Japanese religions. If I did not get that research opportunity in Japan, my life and career at Bath Spa would not have been so exciting and rich.\n\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science Post-doctoral Fellowship: Researching on Mahāyāna in Sri Lanka\n\nFor seven months from October 1996 to May 1997 I was in Kandy, Sri Lanka after returning from Kyoto University. During this period, I carried out archival research at the Library of National Museum, Colombo and Department of National Archives, Colombo and University of Peradeniya. I also conducted field research related to Mahāyāna Buddhism in Sri Lanka by visiting important historical sites in Anurādhapura and Polonnaruva. I travelled throughout the country searching for archaeological evidence for the existence of Mahāyāna in Sri Lanka. In places like Buduruvagala and Väligama (Deegalle 1998b) I spent hours trying to figure out conundrums related to Mahāyāna legacy in Sri Lanka. It was a very productive time for reflection, assessment and reworking of theories that I learnt at Chicago as a doctoral student and becoming aware of my exposed and closer linguistic readings of texts in Kyoto. During that time of chaos in personal affairs related to temple management and in a deeper engagement of academic work in the field of history and archaeology of Sri Lanka, a fresh opportunity arose for further post-doctoral research in Japan.\n\nOn 17 May 1997, I left to Nagoya, Japan by receiving a very prestigious post-doctoral fellowship from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The JSPS fellowship (No. 97023) was for two years. Institutionally, I was JSPS foreign research collaborator, Faculty of Letters, Aichi Gakuin University.[16] I had support, guidance and blessings of Professor Sōdō Mori as well as Professor Egaku Maeda (1926–2010). During the two-year period, I carried out research on the historical existence of Mahāyāna Buddhism in Sri Lanka. During this period and afterwards, I published several articles dealing with Mahāyāna Buddhism in Sri Lanka: (i) “Mahāyāna Ideas within Theravada?” Buddhist Studies (Bukkyō Kenkyū) 27 (1998a): 99–118; (ii) “Buddha’s Rock: Mahāyāna Legacy at Buduruvagala,” Journal of Pāli and Buddhist Studies 12 (December 1998b): 103–15; (iii) “A Search for Mahāyāna in Sri Lanka,” Journal of the International Association for Buddhist Studies 22 (2) 1999: 343–57; (iv) “Theravada Preunderstandings in Understanding Mahāyāna,” Three Mountains and Seven Rivers: Professor Musashi Tachikawa’s Felicitation Volume, ed. Shoun Hino and Toshihiro Wada (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 2004), pp. 43–64; and (v) “Austerity as a Virtue: Spiritual Practices in Japanese and South Asian Buddhist Traditions,” The Distant Neighbours: Fifty Years of Japan-Sri Lanka Relations, ed. W.D. Lakshman (Colombo: Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Colombo, 2003), pp. 164–90. The two-year period research with the support of JSPS consolidated my experiences in Japan in the formation as a scholar of Buddhism.\n\nVisiting Professorships in Canada and United States\n\nProfessor Victor Hori of McGill University was instrumental in facilitating in the offer of an important overseas teaching appointment to me in Canada. At that time (in December 1999), I had just completed teaching “Philosophy and Historical Development of Buddhism in Japan” for the Antioch University (Ohio, USA) for its first overseas Buddhist Studies programme conducted in Kyoto, Japan. In January 2000, I was offered the first chair of Numata Visiting Professorship in Buddhist Studies at McGill University, Canada.[17] This resulted my departure from Japan and from research arrangements as a fellow at the College of Advanced Buddhist Studies, Tokyo from May 1999 with immense kindness and guidance of the late Professor Hubert Durt (1936–2018) of the École Française d’Extrême-Orient. My obligation as Numata Professor at McGill was delivering a public lecture and teaching two courses: an undergraduate course on “Theravāda Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand” and a postgraduate seminar on “Mahāyāna in Theravāda” on the basis of research that I had undertaken earlier in Japan during the tenure as the JSPS post-doctoral fellow.\n\nWhile I was teaching at Bath Spa University, Professor John Ross Carter had retired from his post at Colgate University in 2012. To teach some of his courses, he was instrumental in recommending me to another prestigious post. It was a remarkable, enjoyable and esteemed post: I had been invited to take the post as the NEH Professor of the Humanities at Colgate University, Hamilton, New York (Spring 2013). Again, for the second time, for a full academic year (2014/15), the Department of Religion invited me to accept NEH Professorship of Humanities at Colgate University (NY).\n\nMy Professional Abode in England: The Georgian City Bath, the Home of Jane Austin\n\nThe question of where do I belong to arises. I have thought of this very hard. I consider that I belong to two countries: Sri Lanka, my place of birth and early formation; England, my adopted home as a result of vocation and functioning as a scholar of Buddhist Studies. After so many sojourns, finally I have settled down in Bath, England, in my adopted home. In Bath, I have risen gradually in my professional life from lecturer to full professor in Religions, Philosophies and Ethics. Bath is the place of my first fulltime, permanent teaching appointment outside Sri Lanka. Bath provided an academic setting in Europe to establish myself as a scholar of Buddhist Studies and History of Religions. The city and university enabled me grow as a person and scholar.\n\nAt Bath Spa University, located at Southwest of England in the UNESCO cultural heritage city of Roman Bath, I developed my research trajectory in two directions beyond graduate studies at Chicago and Harvard: on the one hand, expanding my expertise to East Asia on the theme of monasticism and asceticism in relation to Japanese Religions; on the other, in the direction of applied aspects of Buddhist Studies and Ethics with a focus on conflict, violence, ethics of war, politics and religious conversions. Last two decades of my research lies primarily on the latter area of specialization leading to several significant publications. My teaching duties extended primarily on Buddhism, Ethics, Japanese Religions and Theories and Methodology in the Study of Religions.\n\nResearch on Applied Buddhism\n\nAfter I accepted the teaching post at Bath Spa, my research interest began to be oriented towards the study of conflict, violence and war. As you read earlier, I had escaped luckily many episodes of brutal violence when I embarked my journey in Comparative Religion in August 1987. Being at Harvard, I was protected from all forms of barbaric violence in the period of 1987–1989. Though the vicious circle of violence was subdued with force to a significant degree by the early part of 1990, the wounds of violence and ethnic fragmentation continued to become deep rooted until today functioning as an unfathomable obstacle for peacemaking. This was the context for my research on conflict, violence and war.\n\nBuddhism and Conflict in Sri Lanka\n\nThe civil war in Sri Lanka reached to a critical phase in 2001. After signing of Peace Accord between the government and the LTTE, a period of relative peace emerged towards the end of 2001. In that context, a NGO, Buddhist Federation of Norway (BFN) received funding from the Norwegian Government (international mediator to Peace Accord in Sri Lanka) to host a conference on Buddhism and Conflict. When BFN contacted the United Kingdom of Association of Buddhist Studies (UKABS), I happened to be at School of Oriental and African Studies for the UKABS conference. At that time, I thought that the BFN proposition was a viable and valuable one in enhancing relations among religious and ethnic minorities in the context of civil war. Thus grounds were prepared for the International Conference on “Buddhism and Conflict in Sri Lanka” held at Bath Spa University from 28–30 June 2002. The four-member organizing committee of the UKABS included Professor Peter Harvey, Professor Rupert Gethin, Dr Rita Lang and me. It was an opportunity for me in terms of career to develop a research interest in applied Buddhism and ethics.\n\n70 scholars in total from Sri Lanka, UK, North America and Europe participated in the conference. The group gathered included heavy weights in Buddhist Studies and Sri Lankan Studies such as Professor Heinz Bechert (1932–2005), Professor Richard Gombrich, Professor Gananath Obeyesekere, Professor Leslie Gunawardana (1938–2010), Professor K.N.O. Dharmadasa, Professor Steven Collins (1951–2018), Professor H.L. Seneviratne, Professor John Holt, Professor Jonathan Spencer, etc.[18] For the first time in such a scholarly gathering there were a dozen of Sri Lankan Buddhist monks[19] such as the veteran activist, Venerable Maduluvāvē Sōbhita (1942–2015), whose decoration in the front cover of The University of Chicago Press publication of Stanley J. Tambiah’s Buddhism Betrayed? (1992) became extremely controversial in the context of intensifying civil war in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe exploration of issues of conflict, violence and war has attracted much scholarly attention. The international conference (2002), with its electronic proceedings published in the Journal of Buddhist Ethics (vol. 10, 2003) reached to a wider audience [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2010/04/26/conference-buddhism-and-conflict-in-sri-lanka/]. Sinhala publication—Budusamaya saha Sri Lankave Janavargika Ghattanaya (ed. Mahinda Deegalle, 2003) had formed a basis for public debate and discourse in Sri Lanka. Excerpts from that volume have been republished in several other venues. A Tamil translation entitled Bauddhamum Samathanamum: Ilankaiyil Ina Muranpadum (ed. Mahinda Deegalle, 2005) was launched in Kandy. Fully edited scholarly edition in English was published as Buddhism, Conflict and Violence in Modern Sri Lanka (ed. Mahinda Deegalle, London and New York:\n\nRoutledge, 2006) is still in market drawing much attention. Published book reviews significantly popularized the research gathered at the conference by enabling the engagement of a variety of stakeholders locally and internationally.\n\nThis was the beginning point of my involvements in peace-building and reconciliation initiatives. I was able to work closely with overseas NGOs as well as local groups consisted of monastics and lay people in Sri Lanka. Collaboration with BFN also opened avenues in extending my relations with Thailand, in particular, Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University and its conferences on the United Nations Day of Vesak. It was a significant scholastic exercise that reached to a wider section of population in Asia, in particular.\n\nIn addition to violence, another dirty trick on pluralist communities is the issue of religious conversion. Malpractices associated with religious conversions in India and Sri Lanka have been dubbed as “unethical” conversions. In 2004, I was forced into examination of issues of unethical conversions in Sri Lanka and its impact on the formation of politics and activism of Jatika Hela Urumaya monks.\n\nAlleged ‘unethical’ religious conversions became a seriously contested issue. The issue of unethical conversions created an intense religious atmosphere in pluralist religious communities leading to violence at times. Unhealthy social and religious conditions on the ground that fed into unethical conversions were not always obvious to everyone, but they had given birth to the genesis of radical phases such as ‘all Buddhist monk’ political party (2004) and activist movements such as Bodu Bala Sēnā (2016). As a result, some radical groups appear to hold political agendas against some religious and ethnic minorities.\n\nSome of my publications on peace building, violence and politics in Sri Lanka had drawn significant attention from international scholars.[20] My research on Buddhist monks and politics also had attracted some attention. For example, the work on the JHU monks, had been reproduced as excerpts in other academic publications[21] because of its wider relevance to existing debates. My research on politics and forms of good governance in Buddhist societies concentrating on Sri Lanka has been explored in the edited volume Justice and Statecraft (2017).[22]\n\nConsultancy on Peacemaking and Humanitarian Aid\n\nParticipation in the organizing of “Buddhism and Conflict” international conference opened up many opportunities that enabled to establish myself as a scholar of applied Buddhist Studies. Beginning from 2002, I had involved in providing expert advice and consultation to the Buddhist Federation of Norway (BFN, f. 1979) on its educational projects in Sri Lanka and Thailand. I was the key person that opened up avenues in Sri Lanka for the BFN to reach to statesmen, politicians, chief monks, academics, politically active monks, NGOs, peacemakers and activists in Sri Lanka. I organized for the BFN more than four fieldtrips including book launches in Colombo (2002) and Kandy (2005). During those fieldtrips and meetings, I provided long hours of interpretation and subject expertise free of charge because of my dedication to find solutions to on-going civil war in Sri Lanka. All of that made possible and got initiated with my engagement in the organization of the international conference on “Buddhism and Conflict in Sri Lanka” (2002).\n\nOnce my name got around in international circles of peacemakers in relation to religion and politics in Sri Lanka, Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached me seeking my consultation. Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs had initiated a project on “Religion and Politics,” which was housed in the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland. I visited Geneva and accepted the task of organizing fieldtrips to Sri Lanka for the team of researcher in the project on “Religion and Politics.” My first fieldtrip with Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs research team was on 20–25 August 2006. It was followed further with several other visits on 19–23 August 2007, 16–22 December 2007 and 3–4 February 2008. In these field visits, I organized meetings and interpreted the sessions. We had meetings with leading politicians as well as prominent monks such as chief patriarchs and activists such as the late Venerables Māduluvāvē Sōbhita and Professor Bellanvila Wimalaratana (1942–2018) and political monks such as Venerable Baddēgama Samita and Venerable Aturaliyē Ratana and more moderate leading monks such as Venerable Akuräṭiyē Nanda. These meetings and research agendas took place before the new resumption of civil war with the determination of defeating the LTTE that led to creating relative peace and stability in May 2009.\n\nIn recent years, the International Committee of the Red Cross approached me seeking support for organizing a project aimed at holding an international conference in Sri Lanka on humanitarian aid. As a result, our international academic team headed by Professor Peter Harvey produced our Joint Position Paper on the conference theme of “Buddhism and Humanitarian Aid,” now available for downloading on-line: https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/Worldwide/asia/sri-lanka/exploratory_position_paper_on_buddhism_ihl.pdf. The actual conference on Reducing Suffering During Conflict: The Interface between Buddhism and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) took place in Dambulla, Sri Lanka on 4–6 September 2019 with participation of over 100 academics as well as military persons and activists. A volume of essays on the conference theme is now in the pipeline.\n\nPedagogical Innovations\n\nAt Bath Spa, I had opportunities for pedagogical innovations. I developed an innovative module SR5028/6028 Religion, Philosophy and Cultural Practices in Korea for the second- and third-year undergraduate students. It aimed at developing student skills in fieldwork and enhancing their employability opportunities. The module allowed Bath Spa students to live in Seoul, South Korea for a minimum of four weeks.[23] They attended two sessions of the Summer School organized by Dongguk University. They practiced applying techniques of fieldwork previously learnt in the Study of Religions compulsory module SR5000.\n\nThe programme allowed Bath Spa students to learn philosophical and cultural traditions that were not normally available in the Bath Spa curriculum. They had opportunity to attend international seminars and meet world experts in the field of Buddhist and Asian Studies. Students were able to carry out fieldwork and independent research exploring aspects of religious, cultural and social diversity eventually leading to the production of a documentary film. DVD documentaries produced as assessment items for the course were published later as Experiencing Religion, Culture and Society in Korea: A Bath Spa Journey (Bath Spa University, 2008) and The Soul of South Korea: Conflict, Tradition and Religion (Bath Spa University, 2010). A blog was set up to inform details and successes of Summer 2008 study abroad programme in Korea: http://bathspakoreansummer2008.blogspot.com.\n\nIn this international collaboration and exchange of students with Dongguk University, support received from Professor Soonil Hwang and Misan Sunim (Joong-Ang Sangha University),[24] in particular, is extremely appreciated. This international study abroad programme was made possible from a partial grant from the Prime Minister’s Initiative 2 (PMI2) administered by the British Council.\n\nCourses Taught and Developed\n\nI have developed courses in seven higher education institutions. During my first appointment at Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka (1986–87), I taught two advanced undergraduate courses named Buddhist Social and Political Philosophy and History of Buddhist Monastic Civilization. When I was a doctoral student at The University of Chicago, for The Open Program of Center for Continuing Studies, I designed and taught Theravada Buddhism (1994).\n\nI was a member of the teaching team that organized for the first time one semester long study programme in Japanese Buddhism for Antioch Buddhist Studies Programme in Japan (7 Sept.–13 Dec. 1999). During this period, I designed and taught a module on “Philosophy and Historical Development of Buddhism in Japan” for American and Canadian undergraduates. We were based in Kyoto but travelled to Nara and several important religious places such as Koyasan and Hieizan for temple stays and studying Japanese Buddhism from an insider perspective. This gave me a practical insight into Japanese Buddhism and enabled me to carry out research and fieldwork on asceticism in Japanese Buddhism.\n\nI had the opportunity of developing Master level courses at McGill University and Bath Spa University. In McGill (in 2000), I designed and taught a MA level course on Buddhist Metaphysics: Mahāyāna in Theravada (260–655). At Bath Spa for MA in Contemporary Religions, I developed (i) East Meets West (SR4110), War and Peace (SR4150), Buddhism in the Contemporary World (SR4071).\n\nFor McGill University undergraduate students, I designed a course on Theravada Buddhist Literatures: Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand (260–342). When I arrived at Cornell University, I had to design Intensive Sinhala Language (Intermediate) course and teach it (2000).\n\nWhen I assumed duties at Bath Spa University, I had plenty of opportunities to develop my teaching skills and course designing. My undergraduate modules included teaching Buddhism for all levels. The modules were Buddhism (SR2001 & 3001) and Buddhism in Practice (SR6025). Buddhism sections were included also in introductory modules in world religions such as Introduction to Study of Religions (SR1011) and Introduction to Contemporary Issues in Religion (SR1014), Global Religions (SRE4101) and Global Philosophy (PET4101). These and some others like Beyond Belief (SR4000) included Theories and Methods in the Study of religions at an introductory level. In particular, a placement module that I was in charge for over a decade, Studying Religions (SR5000), was exclusively on Theoretical and Methodological Approaches to the Study of Religions. In the undergraduate programme at Bath Spa, beyond Buddhism, I was able to develop my teaching in two specific areas: Japanese Religions and Ethics. Though I introduced Shinto to Global Religions (SR1014), I had freedom to teach a wide range of topics including Shinto, Japanese Buddhism and New Religions in the final year course Religion, Culture and Society in Japan (SR6006). In Bath Spa, I developed the area of Ethics. Teaching in Ethics began with Beyond Good and Evil (PE4000) and continued to Ethics, Religion and Humanism (PE5003) and culminating in Applied Ethics (PE6003) in the final year. I have already mentioned an East Asia centered fieldwork course Religion, Philosophy and Cultural Practices in Korea (SR6028), which aimed at developing student creativity and independent learning. Occasionally, I also offered Comparative Monasticism (SR6022) with an emphasis on contemplative practices. There were also other modules that I contributed from philosophical perspectives from India and China on Buddhist themes in Darshana, Dharma and Tao (PE5000). When I was NEH Professor of Humanities at Colgate University, I offered Living Buddhism: Visions of Life, Work and Liberation in Practice (Religion 285) and The Teachings of the Buddha: Theravada Buddhism (Religion 324). For Honours student, I was also involved in Honors: Burma / Human Rights / Media (Religion 490). I also organized weekly public seminar series at Chapel House on the Dhammapada as a text popular in Buddhist culture\n\nIn addition to these teaching assignments, I participated in two overseas teaching programmes. I participated twice in one-week long the Socrates-Erasmus teaching mobility programme supported by the European Commission and hosted by Faculty of Theology, University of Helsinki, Finland (13–22 Feb. 2002 and 11–21 Sept. 2003). My teaching took place at Department of Comparative Religion at Faculty of Theology.\n\nI was once invited to Israel to teach Buddhism in the summer school of The Elijah School for the Study of Wisdom in World Religions, Jerusalem, Israel (12–26 July 2002). The theme of the summer school was “Sacred Space in World Religions” (http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/previous-activities/academic-programs/summer-school/sacred-space-in-world-religions.html#c679). The teaching was combined with dialogue between Arab Muslims and Orthodox Jews.\n\nDuring teaching at Bath Spa, I was able to assist The Open University in the preparation of course materials for A217 Introducing Religions: Buddhism: Study Guide (Milton Keynes, 2005). I recited the Metta Sutta in Pāli for the Audio CD. I was also interviewed on “Buddhism in Contemporary Sri Lanka and Monastic Practices” in the Audio CD 1 in the course materials. I also provided expert advice in the production of the DVD by introducing relevant contacts in Sri Lanka.\n\nI also helped The Woolf Institute of University of Cambridge to conduct a training programme for policy makers and diplomats at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London (4 June 2014). The lunchtime seminar that I provided concentrated on “Militant Buddhism in Asia: Political and Religious Tensions for Communities.” Specialists in area desks of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam and experts in human rights and gender issues and crisis management participated in the training programme.\n\nSupervising and Examining Students\n\nDuring my teaching at Bath Spa I had the opportunity of supervising one doctoral student to completion of doctoral thesis[25] in addition to several Master theses. I am delighted to note that more than five undergraduate students with whom I had supervisory responsibilities at Bath Spa have already completed doctoral degrees in several British universities.\n\nWhile in Bath Spa, I have examined doctoral degree theses at Lancaster University (2018), University of Oxford (2010), School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (2010), University of Sunderland (2009), Madurai Kamaraj University, Tamil Nadu, India (2009), University of Winchester (2009), Mother Teresa Women’s University, Tamil Nadu, India (2008), University of Birmingham (2004). I have examined one MPhil degree at University of Birmingham (2003) and two MA(Res) degrees at Bangor University (2019) and York St. John University/The University of Leeds (2015). In addition to MA degrees supervised and examined at Bath Spa, I have been external examiner for MA in Buddhist Studies Programme at University of South Wales, New Port (2012–2016) and earlier at University of Sunderland (2008–2011) and MA in Peacebuilding and Reconciliation Programme at University of Winchester (2011–2014). I was also External Scrutineer for doctoral work at University of Winchester / University of Southampton (2005). On undergraduate level, I was Visiting Examiner for Undergraduate Examinations in South Asian Studies, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London (2006/07–2010/11). I have also served as External Adviser, Validation of MA Programme in Religious Studies, Canterbury Christ Church University (2005) and Revalidation of BA (Hons) in Religious Studies Programme at St. Martin’s College, Lancaster (2006). While teaching at Colgate University, I was examiner for Honours Thesis at Dept. of Anthropology, Bates College, Maine, USA (2015) and was Supervisor for Honours Thesis in Religion at Colgate University (2015). I have also assessed Masters and Split site PhD programme of UK-India Education and Research Initiative for British Council, India (2011).\n\nProfessional Achievements\n\nThe first academic position in a professional academic organization was the appointment as a Committee Member of United Kingdom Association of Buddhist Studies (2002–2008). During that time, I had the opportunity of serving as book review editor for the UKABS journal Buddhist Studies Review. It was a privilege to serve on a three-year term as a Steering Committee Member of ‘Buddhism’ Section of the American Academy of Religion (2008–2011), which included screening panel proposals for the AAR’s annual conference programme. As a Board member of the Society for Buddhist and Christian Studies (2008–2011) and the editor of the society’s journal, I had the privilege of redesigning three volumes (29–31) of the journal. I published the journal by adding a fresh and attractive outlook, which was a significant improvement when I look back my duties as the editor of the journal. As a Steering Committee Member (2008–2015) of The Spalding Symposium in Indian Religions annually held at University of Oxford, I had opportunity to contribute to design of the annual conference programme and its organization of activities.\n\nWhile in Bath Spa, I also had several other professional accomplishments. I served as a Member of Search Committee and provided expert consultancy in the recruitment of a lecturer in the Area of Non-Western Philosophy at University of Reading (Nov. 2014). I also promoted graduate studies in Philosophy and Ethics by serving as a Member of the Selection Committee and Institutional Representative for Philosophy subject area from Bath Spa University for the AHRC funded South, West & Wales Doctoral Training Partnership (2013/2014). For three years, I was an Academic Board member of Bath Spa University (2008–2010). I also served as a member of Research Committee and Learning and Teaching Committee at Bath Spa University (2004–2006).\n\nI have been in the editorial advisory board of the Mahachulalongkorn Journal of Buddhist Studies (2008–) and Vietnam Journal of Buddhist Studies published by Vietnam Buddhist University (2014–). I also have served as Book Review Editor for H-Buddhism (2001–2009), Buddhist Studies Review (2004–2009) and Book Review Networker for Religious Studies Review, 2000–2002. I was a Review Panel Member for Sri Lanka International Journal of Buddhist Studies (2019) and Reviewer of paper proposals for PGIHS Research Congress 2018 of University of Peradeniya (2018). I also served as Bath Spa Academic Representative for the annual Postgraduate Conference in the West region (usually held at University of Bristol), 2001–2009 and hosted the annual postgraduate conference in Southwest region, 2006. With T. Fitzgerald, I organized “Religion and Secular Dichotomy” conference at University of Stirling, 4–6 July 2003.\n\nBecause of my work in international Buddhist affairs and interfaith work, I was appointed as a member of International Council for Buddhist Development in Sri Lanka, Ministry of Buddhist and Religious Affairs, Sri Lanka in 2010. Locally, I have served as Trustee and Secretary for the World Buddhist Foundation, London since 2001.\n\nOnce I received KAICIID Southeast Asia Fellowship (May 2016–April 2017) I had participated in interfaith activities in promoting Buddhist and Muslim relations furthering interfaith understanding. As a Southeast Asia fellow, I had the opportunity to receive further training in peacebuilding interfaith work at Mindanao Peacebuilding Institute, Mindanao, Philippines, 23 May–3 June 2016.\n\nReviewing Monographs and Journal Articles\n\nI have peer reviewed monographs for publication in the Routledge Environment & Sustainability Development Series (2019), Palgrave Macmillan (2016), Routledge Asian Studies (2007), American Academy of Religion Text Series published by Oxford University Press (2006), Routledge (2005 & 2006), Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism (2005) and E.J. Brill’s Asian Religions Series (2004).\n\nMy peer reviewing of journal articles include International Journal of Buddhist Thought & Culture (2019), Philosophy East & West (2019), Contemporary South Asia (2016), Journal of Buddhist Ethics (2016), Social Analysis (2014), Numen: International Review for the History of Religions (2011), Contemporary Buddhism (2010), Religions of South Asia (2008 & 2010), The Mahachulalongkorn Journal of Buddhist Studies (2008 & 2009) and Buddhist Studies Review (2006).\n\nResearch Appointments\n\nOne of the successes in my academic career as a scholar of Buddhist Studies was that I was able to acquire research positions early on in my profession. My first fulltime research position, as noted above, was as Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai post-doctoral fellow (1995–96), holding the post of Research Collaborator at Faculty of Letter, Kyoto University and Research"
