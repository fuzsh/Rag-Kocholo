        "text": "WASHINGTON — Kris Humphries shrugged off loud booing to finishwith 21 points and 16 rebounds, and Deron Williams had 23 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, helping the New Jersey Nets beat the Washington Wizards 90-84 Monday night in the season opener for both teams.\n\nThe Nets trailed by as many as 21 points in the second quarter, but began to turn things around with a 16-2 run.\n\nJohn Wall, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft, had 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists, but he only shot 3 for 13. Backup shooting guard Nick Young led Washington with 16 points in just 18 minutes. He missed a large part of the second half after jamming his left foot, but returned.\n\nKings 100, Lakers 91\n\nSACRAMENTO — Marcus Thornton scored 12 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and the Sacramento Kings opened the season in grand fashion, beating the Los Angeles Lakers at home for the first time in more than three years, 100-91 on Monday night.\n\nTyreke Evans added 20 points, John Salmons had 13 and DeMarcus Cousins had 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Kings, who had lost nine of 10 to the Lakers and five straight at home.\n\nKobe Bryant scored 29 points and Metta World Peace added 19 for the Lakers, who opened the season with consecutive losses for the first time since 2002-03, putting a damper on the start of new coach Mike Brown's tenure.\n\nWarriors 99, Bulls 91\n\nOAKLAND — Stephen Curry had 21 points and 10 assists, Monta Ellis scored 26 points and the Golden State Warriors beat the Chicago Bulls 99-91 on Monday, giving rookie coach Mark Jackson his first victory at any level.\n\nDavid Lee added 22 points and seven rebounds and Dominic McGuire made three free throws in the final 47 seconds to seal the win for Golden State.\n\nLuol Deng, whose block of Kobe Bryant as time expired sealed Chicago's season-opening 88-87 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls, who trailed by as much as 19 before making a late surge to get within 96-91 with 36.3 seconds remaining.\n\nDerrick Rose had an off night shooting and finished with 13 points for Chicago.\n\nBobcats 96, Bucks 95\n\nCHARLOTTE — D.J. Augustin scored 19 points, rookie Kemba Walker added 13, including two free throws with 9.9 seconds remaining, and the Bobcats erased a 14-point deficit to beat the Bucks.\n\nGerald Henderson added 18 points and nine rebounds for the Bobcats.\n\nBrandon Jennings had 22 points for the Bucks, while Andrew Bogut had 17 points and nine rebounds.\n\nThe Bobcats got a huge lift off the bench from Walker and centre Byron Mullens, who was acquired in a trade last week with the Thunder. Walker scored nine points in the second half creating shots off the dribble and chipped in with seven rebounds, while Mullens was 5 of 7 from the field for 10 points.\n\nMagic 104, Rockets 95\n\nORLANDO — Hedo Turkoglu scored 23 points to lead five Magic players in double figures as Orlando earned its first victory of the season with a win over Houston.\n\nOrlando got 13 points from Turkoglu and eight points from J.J. Redick in the fourth quarter to help the Magic stave off a handful of second-half charges by the Rockets. Dwight Howard finished with 21 points and Redick 20.\n\nKyle Lowry led Houston with 20 points and 12 assists, Luis Scola added 19 and Courtney Lee 15 off the bench.\n\nThe Rockets trailed by as many as 12 points and got within four in the fourth quarter, but the Magic were able to hit some timely 3-pointers late to help secure the victory.\n\nCentre Samuel Dalembert, who's signing with Houston became official on Monday, had 10 points.\n\nPacers 91, Pistons 79\n\nINDIANAPOLIS —Roy Hibbert had 16 points and 14 rebounds to help the Pacers defeat the Pistons.\n\nDavid West, Indiana's big free agent addition, had 11 points and 12 rebounds, even though he made just 3 of 12 field goals. Tyler Hansbrough had 15 points and 13 rebounds and Paul George added 12 points.\n\nDanny Granger, Indiana's leading scorer last season, finished with 16 points on 6-for-18 shooting. The Pacers shot just 37 per cent from the field, but got away with it because they outrebounded the Pistons 53-40. Indiana had 18 offensive rebounds and 14 second-chance points.\n\nJonas Jerebko and Rodney Stuckey each scored 17 points for the Pistons, who never led.\n\nThunder 104, Timberwolves 100\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Kevin Durant scored 33 points to lead the Thunder to a victory over the Timberwolves.\n\nRussell Westbrook added 28 points, six assists and six rebounds, and James Harden scored 16 points for the Thunder, who have started off a season loaded with expectations at 2-0.\n\nKevin Love had 22 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, and Ricky Rubio had an impressive debut with six assists, six points and five rebounds in 26 minutes for the Timberwolves, who hung with the Western Conference favourites all game long.\n\nNuggets 115, Mavericks 93\n\nDALLAS — Ty Lawson scored 20 of his 27 points in the first half and the Denver Nuggets faced little resistance on their way to a victory over the Mavericks.\n\nThe reigning champions were drubbed for a second straight game, routinely giving up easy baskets in both. They allowed Denver to score 20 unanswered points in the second quarter and were down by 33 late in the third.\n\nDenver, playing its opener, scored on 19 of 25 second-quarter possessions. The Nuggets made only 12 baskets in the second half, yet still cruised to victory.\n\nDirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 20 points, and didn't play in the fourth quarter -- for the second straight game, yet another indication of how badly things are going for the Mavs.\n\nHornets 85, Suns 84\n\nPHOENIX — Eric Gordon made a 20-footer from the top of the key with 4.2 seconds to play in his New Orleans debut to give the Hornets a victory over the Suns.,\n\nGordon, who came to New Orleans in the trade that sent Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, gave his team its only lead since the first two minutes of the second half.\n\nSuns rookie Markieff Morris threw the ball away on Phoenix's final possession.\n\nGordon scored 20 points. Carl Landry added 14 and Trevor Ariza 13 for New Orleans.\n\nRobin Lopez scored 22 points, more than he had in any game last season, for the Suns. Steve Nash had 14 points and 12 assists but was scoreless in the final quarter.\n\nSpurs 95, Grizzlies 82\n\nSAN ANTONIO — Manu Ginobili scored 24 points and the Spurs got some payback after their stunning playoff collapse last season, beating the Grizzlies.\n\nSan Antonio began what could be Tim Duncan's final season with a satisfying win after Memphis upset the 61-win Spurs in the first round last season. Tony Parker added 15 points and seven assists.\n\nRudy Gay led Memphis with 19 points in his first game in nearly 10 months. Gay missed the end of last season with a bad left shoulder, including when Memphis knocked out the top-seeded Spurs.\n\nThe Grizzlies remained winless on opening night since the franchise left Vancouver in 2001, and this blowout surely wasn't he NBA's breakout team of last season had in mind.\n\nTrail Blazers 107, 76ers 103\n\nPORTLAND — LaMarcus Aldridge had 25 points and seven rebounds and the Portland Trail Blazers opened their season with an 107-103 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night.\n\nGerald Wallace added 21 points and nine rebounds for the Blazers, who let an early lead slip away but regained the upper hand in the second half by going small and picking up the pace. Wesley Mathews added 16 points.\n\nReserve Lou Williams had 12 of his 25 points in the second quarter and two clutch 3-pointers at the end for the Sixers, who open the season with a five-game road trip. Andre Igoudala had 22 points and eight rebounds. The Sixers shot 48 per cent from the field, but the Blazers took 97 shots to Philadelphia's 83."
