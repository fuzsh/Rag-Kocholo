        "text": "Mentioned in this article\n\nTeams:\n\nSplyce has closed a $2.6M round of funding, led by The Ledger Group’s $1.5M investment.\n\nThe round included venture capital firm First Serve Partners who recruited several popular sports figures for its investment.\n\nThe investment comes just days before the July 1 deadline for Splyce to submit its application for a franchise spot in the EU LCS.\n\nEsports organization Splyce has completed a funding round of $2.6M, led by The Ledger Group . The Esports Observer previously reported that The Ledger Group had planned to invest $1.5M in Splyce during this round. Venture capital firm First Serve Partners also joined the round, recruiting former professional athletes Metta World Peace and Roman Harper, as well as sports agent David Meltzer for its investment. Both First Serve Partners and The Ledger Group will join Splyce’s board as observers.\n\nFirst Serve Partners CEO Waylon Chin told ESPN:\n\n“We believe that our investment in Splyce, featuring a strategic collection of iconic athletes and business leaders in our syndicate, positions us to not only capitalize on the transcendent growth of esports but to bridge the gap between athletes as entrepreneurs and investors, and continue our leadership across sports, media, and entertainment.”\n\nThe investment comes just days before the July 1 deadline for Splyce to submit its application for a franchise spot in the European League of Legends Championship series . As an existing LCS team—if accepted—Splyce will need to pay a franchise fee of €8M to remain in the league. The fee can be paid out over time, so this round of funding will help Splyce cover the initial payment, while also bolstering the organization’s leadership with business advisers experienced in esports itself, as well as broader sports and entertainment.\n\nRelated Article: Riot Games Announces Partnership with DXRacer for EU LCS, Changes to Sponsorship Regulations\n\nWhile LCS franchising may be the most important immediate challenge for Splyce, the organization has larger plans to leverage its new investors. While Splyce competes in the EU LCS, the bulk of the organization’s esports teams are based in North America. CEO Marty Strenczewilk told ESPN that bringing on The Ledger Group and First Serve Partners—which are based out of Toronto and New York, respectively—will help expand the company network into “two key business regions in the northeast.”"
