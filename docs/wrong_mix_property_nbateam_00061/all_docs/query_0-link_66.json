The new big man showed few signs of limitation as he ran the floor and dunked aggressively during 33 minutes of play.\n\nThe Lakers were able to unveil their new high profile lineup of Howard, Kobe Bryant, newly acquired Steve Nash, Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace.\n\nBryant led all scorers with 21 points as he prepared for his quest for a sixth NBA championship.\n\nThe Lakers open the regular season against the Dallas Mavericks on October 30.\n\n(Writing by Jahmal Corner, editing by Nick Mulvenney)"
