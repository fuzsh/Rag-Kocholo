        "text": "SACRAMENTO – Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol were locked in for the tipoff Thursday night, completely focused on the matter at hand.\n\nThat matter was Gasol’s left knee coming over too far into Bryant’s personal space as they sat side-by-side on the Lakers bench.\n\nThe anchors of the 2009 and 2010 NBA championships relaxed together, laughing and resting instead of playing in the Lakers’ regular-season-ending 113-96 loss to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Lakers already were locked into the Western Conference’s No. 3 seed, and Game 1 of their best-of-7 series with the Denver Nuggets begins at 12:30 p.m. Sunday at Staples Center.\n\nBryant, Gasol and Andrew Bynum all chose to rest as the lockout-compacted schedule ended. With Gasol sitting, no Laker played all 66 games after six played in all 82 regular-season games last season — Bryant, Gasol, Lamar Odom, Derek Fisher, Ron Artest and Shannon Brown.\n\nPoint guard Ramon Sessions was in the starting lineup Thursday night, with Lakers coach Mike Brown looking for him to show leadership to a young crew out there.\n\nSessions, acquired at the trade deadline and with fresher legs from having only backed up Kyrie Irving much of this season in Cleveland, will have major responsibility in the first round against Denver speed demon Ty Lawson — and perhaps in the second round also against Oklahoma City All-Star Russell Westbrook.\n\nSessions had 14 points on 6-of-13 shooting against the Kings. Devin Ebanks got some additional experience at the starting small-forward post he is expected to man in against Denver with Metta World Peace suspended; Ebanks had 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting.\n\nThe Lakers finished the season with a 41-25 record, and first-year Laker Brown categorized that as a success considering the only West teams to finish ahead of the Lakers — San Antonio and Oklahoma City — have been together with their coaching staffs for years.\n\nThe Lakers also played the regular-season finale at Sacramento last year, when it appeared the Kings would be moving to Anaheim and there was a lot of sentiment in the air at the former Arco Arena. This time, the season ended with Sacramento’s viability as an NBA city still in some question but the franchise committed to return at least for next season."
