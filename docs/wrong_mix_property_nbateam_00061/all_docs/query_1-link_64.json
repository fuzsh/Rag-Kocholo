        "text": "SBS Transit - Beyond just being a people mover\n\nSBS Transit is a leading bus and rail operator in Singapore. Every day, we carry millions of passengers on our extensive bus and rail network. But we believe in not just being a people mover - we believe in the journey, and not just the destination. This is why we have invested extensively in technology and training, constantly looking to upgrade not just our operations but our people as well.\n\nWe were formed in only 1973 through the merger of three private bus companies. We grew quickly and by 1978, we were listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (now known as SGX) as Singapore Bus Service (1978).\n\nIn November 1997, the Company was renamed DelGro Corporation Limited with a subsidiary, Singapore Bus Services Limited, listed separately on the SGX. In November 2001, Singapore Bus Services Limited had a change in name to SBS Transit Ltd to reflect our new bi-modal status as a bus and rail operator when we won the licence to operate the North East MRT Line.\n\nIn 2003, SBS Transit became a part of the ComfortDelGro Group when Comfort Group and DelGro Corp merged to form ComfortDelGro Corporation, one of the world's largest land transport companies. As part of an international, multi-modal transport company, we have been able to leverage the Group's extensive resources, expertise and knowledge to bring about higher levels of service and comfort for our Singapore commuters.\n\nSBS Transit aims to provide world-class public transport which is safe, comfortable, affordable, reliable and friendly. Today, we operate more than 200 bus services with a fleet of some 3,000 buses. We also operate the North East MRT Line, which is the world's first fully automated, underground heavy rail system that connects Punggol to HarbourFront, as well as the Light Rail System in the Punggol and Sengkang new towns.\n\nSBS Transit also operates the Downtown Line. This 42km Line with 34 stations is currently the longest underground Line in Singapore. The first and second stage of Downtown Line commenced service on 22 December 2013 and 27 December 2015, whilst the third stage opened on 21 October 2017.\n\nCorporate Logo\n\nSingapore Bus Services was renamed SBS Transit Ltd on 1 November 2001. The new name reflects our multi-modal status as we move from being just a bus operator to the provision of both bus and train services.\n\nWe have retained \"SBS\" in the new company name to remember our roots and preserve our long heritage.\n\nOur corporate signature is a specially designed wordmark. The distinct graphic stroke, called the \"speed stroke\" expresses the dynamism of the organisation.\n\nThe vibrant orange colour signifies dynamism and innovation. The purple colour represents strength, stability and a firm commitment to our customers. The bold interplay of the two colours signifies the crossing of boundaries and connecting people, which are the foundation of lasting relationships."
