        "text": "Most of my readers surely know that the NBA playoffs are currently in full swing, with 8 teams left battling for a spot in the conference finals. Less of my readers might know that 2016 is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the now infamous Pokémon video game series. As a big time gamer, (along with die hard sports fan, of course) I am equally excited for both events! Since this blog is no stranger to fictional character/athlete crossovers, I present to you a list of NBA players along with their Pokémon equivalents. (from the original 151, of course)\n\nRussell Westbrook – Geodude\n\nGeodude is a rock type Pokémon consisting of pretty much just a head and a pair of muscular arms. It will often get confused for a rock, causing people to step on it, or mess with it, not knowing that it is actually a Pokémon! Because of this Geodude has an abrasive and angry nature, the same way that Russ plays angry, with a chip on his shoulder and attacks the rim with no regard for anyone in the way.\n\nMetta World Peace – Hitmonchan\n\nHitmonchan is a fighting type Pokémon who is known for his skills in punching his opponents. Honestly, I can probably stop right there as the ironically named Metta World Peace has built a reputation as not only a ferocious defender, but someone who is more than willing to throw a few haymakers at an opponent. It’s not just his enemies on the court who have to feel his wrath though, as he infamously charged into the stands during the outrageous Malace at the Palace brawl that erupted during a Pistons-Pacers game back in 04 when he still went by Ron Artest.\n\nIsaiah Thomas – Pikachu\n\nPikachu is easily the most famous Pokémon of the entire lot, as he has become the poster boy since the game burst onto the scene in 1996. But those that also watched the television show knew what a scrappy, underdog Pikachu truly was. He and Ash Ketchum routinely took on and defeated opponents that he should have had no chance with. Isaiah embodies this aspect from the electric type rodent, as he is undersized even for the point guard position. However he keeps fighting against the odds by earning the Celtics a top 5 finish in the east this past season (even top 3 in April), back-to-back postseason appearances, and spot for himself on the 2016 Eastern Conference All-Star team.\n\nSteph Curry – Magikarp/Gyarados\n\nMagikarp, simply put, is the worst Pokémon pretty much ever. His only attack, ‘Splash’, isn’t so much an attack as it is Magikarp flailing around and not even damaging his opponent. However, if you can be patient with him, and build your team around him to help him gain experience, he will eventually evolve into Gyarados, a mighty beast who is one of the most powerful and formidable Pokémon that a trainer can acquire. Steph shares a similar story, though he was not nearly as terrible as Magikarp during the early stages of his career. He is an underdog though, with teams drafting players Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn being picked before he was. Golden State was patient with him though. Acquired before the 09-10 season, the Warriors have spent the last 6 seasons putting talent around him and watching him develop and flourish into the best player in the league.\n\nSerge Ibaka – Machamp\n\nMachamp is a fighting type Pokémon and is the final evolution of Machop and Machoke. What makes Machamp stand out is his 4 enourmous, muscular arms. It enables him to throw shots at his opponent they might not see coming and he is able to block more shots that are coming at him. That is exactly what Serge I-Block-Ya has in common with the Pokémon. The blocks! Serge is an elite shot-blocker in the NBA proven by his top 6 finishes in the blocks per game category every season since 2010, even putting up a ridiculous 3.7 BPG back in 2012. While Serge doesn’t have 4 arms like Machamp, to opposing offensive players it might seem that way at times.\n\nBoogie Cousins – Primeape\n\nPrimeape is yet another fighting type Pokémon to make the list. Primeape is known as a powerful but irritable Pokémon (as indicated by the stress marks on his head), one who will never back down from a fight and is known to pick them himself. Even the slightest incident will send it over the edge, earning it a reputation as a moody but very effective Pokémon. This is eerily similar to DeMarcus Cousins, the resident star player on the Sacramento Kings. His mood swings are now famous and have resulted in coaches being fired, scraps on and off the court, and mixed relations with players league-wide. While he has been known to yell at his coaches and smack away high-fives from opposing players, his dominance on the court is undeniable as he has begrudgingly become a superstar in the league.\n\nKyrie Irving – Abra\n\nAbra is a psychic type Pokémon. While it is much more powerful when it evolves into Kadabra or Alakazam, it is definitely a great Pokémon in its own right. Amongst Pokémon trainers who played the games, Abra is notoriously elusive, as at its lowest level the only move it knows is ‘Teleport’. When used in battle, the move will teleport Abra out of danger making it quite difficult to catch. Difficult to catch can also be applied to young Kyrie aka Uncle Drew. Though not a psychic, he often displays mind-bending ball-handling skills and ‘teleports’ right by defenders (like the one above). Kyrie Irving is about as hard to catch in the open court as catching an Abra is in Pokémon Yellow.\n\nDraymond Green – Eevee\n\nEevee is a normal type Pokémon with a unique trait. When exposed to an evolution stone, it can evolve into a different Pokémon with the type of the Pokémon depending simply on the type of evolution stone. Trainers can decide from the water type Vaporeon, psychic type Espeon, fire type Flareon, grass type Leafeon, and electric type Jolteon, just to name a few. While Draymond Green never had a magic stone handed to him to make him a great player, his versatility is just as impressive as Eevee’s. Green is praised for his ability to defend all 5 positions on the court, despite being an undersized center at 6’7″. in 2015-16 (his first All-Star season) he contributed 14 PPG, 9 RPG, and 7 (!) APG, while also adding a steal and a block per contest as well. He also finished the season second in triple doubles with 13, and was one of two players who reached double digit triple doubles. A diverse contribution for a once ‘undersized, second round pick’.\n\nTim Duncan – Kabutops\n\nWe’ll end our list here with a couple of fossils – literally. Kabutops is a rock/water type Pokémon from prehistoric times. In fact the only way to acquire one in the games is to find a ‘Dome Fossil’ and have it restored into a Kabuto, who will then evolve into a Kabutops. It is certainly a testament to the ancient times of Pokémon. Tim Duncan on the other hand might not have been restored from a fossil, but is certainly one of the oldest players in the NBA still thriving. He’s built a dynasty in San Antonio, a testament to good old fashioned hard work, commitment, and routine. The Spurs have won 50+ games every year since 2000, and old man Duncan was there for them all.\n\nKobe Bryant – Arbok\n\nKobe is lovingly known as the Black Mamba, a smooth and deadly killer who can snake through defenses and cause damage. Arbok on the other hand is a large, poison type snake who even rocks the purple and gold just like Bryant.\n\nImage Sources:\n\nhttp://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki\n\nhttp://sarabilioness.deviantart.com/art/Eevee-and-its-Evolutions-118885096\n\nhttp://sportznow1.sportsblog.com/posts/15822088/dear-kobe-bryant-.html\n\nhttps://thefastbreakdown.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/sergeant-ibaka-or-fear-the-beard-harden/"
