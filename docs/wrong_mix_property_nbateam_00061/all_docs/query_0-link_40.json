        "text": "Reserve shooting guard Daequan Cook and his fellow reserves didn't give Brooks a choice but to leave in the backups as OKC recorded a hard-fought 118-110 comeback victory over the sizzling Kings at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\n\nCook erupted for 19 points, all in the fourth quarter, as the Thunder's second unit slammed the door by outscoring Sacramento 36-24 in the final period.\n\nCook shot 6 for 9 in the fourth quarter, burying 4 of 5 from 3-point range. The dagger came on a 3-pointer from the right corner with 44.9 seconds left to give the Thunder a 114-107 lead.\n\n“I was in a great rhythm,” Cook explained afterward. “I felt pretty good out there. Guys were getting me looks and I was knocking them down.”\n\nWhile the Kings stuck with their starting lineup until Cook's dagger, the Thunder countered with a lineup of Cook, Nick Collison, Derek Fisher, Cole Aldrich and Royal Ivey for the entire fourth quarter.\n\nNo Sacramento starter played fewer than 33½ minutes in the game and no OKC starter played more than 32½ minutes.\n\nThe difference-maker and tide-changer no doubt was Cook, who admitted he has been slow to recover from the mild right MCL sprain that caused him to miss six games starting on March 21.\n\nAsked if he was 100-percent healthy, Cook said: “Not really. (I'm) still kind of going through the motions, but it's not affecting me in any way. I'm still getting treatment, still doing the things I need to do to get there, but it's not stopping me from playing.”\n\nExactly what percent is Cook health-wise?\n\n“I couldn't tell you,” Cook said, before smiling and adding, “but after tonight I feel a little better.”\n\nAldrich, the Thunder's third-string center, normally is doing leg kicks from the bench whenever a teammate hits a 3-pointer. On this night, he was on the court to admire Cook's display up close.\n\n“Unreal,” Aldrich said of Cook. “It was fun. I wasn't on the sidelines doing my leg kick. I was hoping someone else was doing it for me.”\n\nAldrich helped seal the game by going 4 for 4 from the free-throw line in the final 35.5 seconds.\n\nRecently acquired guard Derek Fisher directed the second unit and finished with 11 points and five assists.\n\nAs for the starters, Thunder All-Star Kevin Durant started the game 3 for 3 from the field, but then hit just 4 of his final 16.\n\nDespite misfiring from the field, Durant maintained his slight lead over Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant for this year's scoring title thanks to going 15 for 16 from the free-throw line to end with 32 points in 32½ minutes.\n\nThe Thunder was without its top reserve in pending Sixth Man of the Year James Harden, who sat out due to a concussion he suffered Sunday after getting hit by the elbow of Lakers forward Metta World Peace, who received a seven-game suspension.\n\n“He's a big factor on our bench, not just our bench but our whole team,” Cook said of Harden. “Those guys (on the bench) had to step up big and we all did a great job playing our roles and doing what we needed to do to get the win.”\n\nSacramento wound up shooting 52.4 percent for the game, but shot an astounding 81.8 percent from the field in the first quarter, making 18 of 22 attempts to take a 40-35 lead.\n\nNeedless to say, it was the most points and highest shooting percentage given up by the Thunder this season.\n\nThe Kings didn't cool off any early in the second quarter, pushing their lead to 50-37 at the 9:43 mark thanks to 77.8-percent shooting (21 for 27).\n\nThe Thunder stormed back quickly and pulled to within 52-51 at the 4:18 mark and managed to stay close until the fourth quarter, when Cook and his fellow reserves took command."
