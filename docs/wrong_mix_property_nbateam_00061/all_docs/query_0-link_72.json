Dwight Buycks (rookie guard from Marquette).\n\nOutlook: Acquiring Gay at midseason boosted the offense. The Raptors could make a run at a low playoff seed.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nCoach: Brad Stevens (first season).\n\nLast year: 41-40 (7th in East).\n\nKey returning players: Jeff Green (12.8 ppg., 3.9 rpg.), Rajon Rondo (13.7 ppt., 11.1 apg., 1.8 spg.), Avery Bradley (9.2 ppg., 2.1 apg., 1.3 spg.).\n\nKey additions: Kelly Olynyk (first-round pick from Gonzaga), Gerald Wallace (7.7 ppg., 3.6 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: Green averaged 20.3 points in the playoff series loss to the Knicks and will now be the leader of a young team.

Watson (6.8 ppg., 2.0 apg.), Chris Copeland (8.7 ppg., 2.1 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: George, armed with a contract extension, is emerging as one of the top two-way performers in the NBA.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nCoach: Tom Thibodeau (157-73).\n\nLast year: 45-37 (5th in the East).\n\nKey returning players: Derrick Rose (21.8 ppg., 7.9 apg. in 2011-12), Luol Deng (3.0 apg.) 16.5 ppg., 6.3 rpg.)

Mayo (15.3 ppg., 4.4 apg., 3.5 rpg.), Caron Butler (10.4 ppg., 2.9 rpg.), Brandon Knight (13.3 ppg., 4.0 apg.).\n\nOutlook: Drew takes over a team in transition and must replace its top two scorers, Monta Ellis and Brandon Jennings.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nCoach: Erik Spoelstra (260-134).\n\nLast year: 66-16 (1st in East).\n\nKey returning players: LeBron James (26.8 ppg., 8.0 rpg., 7.3 apg.), Dwayne Wade (21.2 ppg., 5.0 rpg. 5.1 apg.), Chris Bosh (16.6 ppg., 6.8 rpg., 1.7 bpg.).\n\nKey additions: Greg Oden (hasn't played since 2009-10 season), Michael Beasley (10.1 ppg., 3.8 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: Even though age is creeping on the Heat and Wade has to show he can stay healthy, any team with James and a solid supporting cast remains the NBA favorite.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nCoach: Mike Budenholzer (first year).\n\nLast year: 44-38 (6th in the East).\n\nKey returning players: Al Horford (17.5 ppg., 8.4 rpg., 1.8 bpg.), Jeff Teague (14.6 ppg., 7.2 apg.), Lou Williams (14.1 ppg., 3.6 apg).\n\nKey additions: Paul Milsap (14.6 ppg., 7.1 rpg.) Dennis Schroder (first-round pick, Germany), Elton Brand (7.2 ppg., 6.0 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: After losing Josh Smith in free agency, the Hawks may take a step back.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nCoach: Randy Wittman (147-291).\n\nLast year: 29-53 (12th in East).\n\nKey returning players: John Wall (18.5 ppg., 7.6 apg., 4.0 rpg.), Bradley Beal (13.9 ppg., 3.8 rpg.), Nene (12.6 ppg., 6.7 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Al Harrington (5.1 ppg., 2.7 rpg.), Otto Porter (first-round pick, Georgetown).\n\nOutlook: After getting a contract extension, Wall is intent on leading the Washington to its first playoff berth since the 2007-2008 season.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats\n\nCoach: Steve Clifford (1st year).\n\nLast year: 21-61 (14th in the East).\n\nKey returning players: Gerald Henderson (15.5 ppg., 3.7 rpg.), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (9.0 ppg., 5.8 rpg.), Kemba Walker (17.7 ppg., 5.7 apg.).\n\nKey additions: Cody Zeller (first-round pick, Indiana), Al Jefferson (17.8 ppg., 9.2 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: Jefferson, who was sidelined with an ankle injury during the preseason, gives them needed scoring.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nCoach: Jacque Vaughn (20-62).\n\nLast year: 20-62 (15th in East).\n\nKey returning players: Arron Affalo (17.3 ppg., 8.5 rpg.), Jameer Nelson (14.7 ppg., 7.4 apg.), Nik Vucevic (13.1 ppg., 11.9 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Victor Oladipo (first-round pick, Indiana), Jason Maxiell (6.9 ppg., 3.8 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: This is a team that is rebuilding and could struggle to match last season's win total.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nCoach: Scott Brooks (234-137).\n\nLast year: 60-22 (1st in the West).\n\nKey returning players: Kevin Durant (28.1 ppg., 7.3 rpg., 4.6 apg.), Russell Westbrook (23.2 ppg., 7.4 apg., 5.2 rpg.), Serge Ibaka (13.2 ppg., 7.7 rpg. 3.0 bpg.).\n\nKey additions: Steven Adams (first-round pick, Pittsburgh).\n\nOutlook: A key will be how well Westbrook returns from his knee injury.

Redick (14.1ppg., 90.0 FT percentage, 36.6 three-point percentage).\n\nOutlook: The Clippers will be a major contender in the Western Conference.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nCoach: Mark Jackson (70-78).\n\nLast year: 47-35 (6th in West).\n\nKey returning players: Stephen Curry (22.9 ppg, 6.9 apg., 45.3 three-point percentage), David Lee (18.5 ppg., 11.2 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Andre Iguodala (13.0 ppg., 5.4 apg., 5.3 rpg.), Marresse Speights (8.3 ppg., 4.9 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: Center Andrew Bogut must stay healthy, and the addition of former Sixer Iguodala drastically improves the defense.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nCoach: Mike D'Antoni (428-371).\n\nLast year: 45-37 (7th in West).\n\nKey returning players: Kobe Bryant (27.3 ppg., 5.6 rpg., 6.0 apg.), Pau Gasol (13.7 ppg., 8.6 rpg.), Steve Nash (12.7 ppg., 6.7 apg.).\n\nKey additions: Nick Young (10.6 ppg. 35.7 three-point percentage), Chris Kaman (10.5 ppg., 5.6 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: Bryant's return date from a torn Achilles tendon is still unknown. Nash has to prove he can remain healthy. Even at full strength, the Lakers stand a good chance of missing the playoffs for the first time since the 2004-05 season.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nCoach: Mike Malone (1st year).\n\nLast year: 28-54 (13th in the West).\n\nKey returning players: DeMarcus Cousins (17.1 ppg., 9.9 rpg., 2.7 apg.), Jason Thompson (10.9 ppg., 6.7 rpg.), Isaiah Thomas (13.9 ppg., 4.0 apg.).\n\nKey additions: Ben McLemore (first-round pick, Kansas), Carl Landry (10.8 ppg., 6.0 rpg.).\n\nOutlook: The fact that Landry will miss the first 3 to 4 months with a torn hip flexor won't help, but the Kings still look like an improved team.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nCoach: Jeff Hornacek (1st year).\n\nLast year: 25-57 (15th in West).\n\nKey returning players: Goran Dragic (14.7 ppg., 7.7 apg.), Markieff Morris (8.2 ppg., 4.8 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Eric Bledsoe (8.5 ppg., 3.1 apg.), Alex Len (first-round pick, Maryland), Archie Goodwin (first-round pick, Kentucky).\n\nOutlook: The Suns have a chance to be the worst team in the Western Conference.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nCoach: Gregg Popovich (905-423).\n\nLast year: 58-24 (2d in the West).\n\nKey returning players: Tim Duncan (17.8 ppg., 9.9 rpg., 2.7 bpg.), Tony Parker (20.3 ppg., 7.6 apg.), Manu Ginobili (11.8 ppg., 4.6 apg., 3.4 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Marco Belinelli (9.6 ppg., 35.7 three-point percentage).\n\nOutlook: As long as Duncan can stay healthy, the defending Western Conference champions will again be a factor.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nCoach: David Joerger (1st year).\n\nLast year: 56-26 (5th in the West).\n\nKey returning players: Zach Randolph (15.4 ppg., 11.2 rpg.), Mike Conley (14.6 ppg., 6.1 apg.), Marc Gasol (14.1 ppg., 7.8 rpg., 1.7 bpg.).\n\nKey additions: Mike Miller (4.8 ppg., 41.7 three-point percentage), Nick Calathes (played in the Russian Professional Basketball League), Jamaal Franklin (rookie from San Diego State).\n\nOutlook: Miller's addition should improve the perimeter game. The key will be developing consistent bench scoring.\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nCoach: Kevin McHale (118-124).\n\nLast year: 45-37 (8th in the West).\n\nKey returning players: James Harden (25.9 ppg., 5.8 apg., 4.9 rpg.), Chandler Parsons (15.5 ppg., 5.3 rpg., 3.5 apg.), Jeremy Lin (13.4 ppg., 6.1 apg.).\n\nKey additions: Dwight Howard (17.1 ppg., 12.4 rpg., 2.4 bpg.).\n\nOutlook: Howard should be much better more than a year removed from back surgery. He has shot under 50 percent from the foul line each of the last two years.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nCoach: Monty Williams (94-136).\n\nLast year: 27-55 (14th in West).\n\nKey returning players: Anthony Davis (13.5 ppg., 8.2 rpg., 1.8 bpg.), Eric Gordon (17.0 ppg., 3.3 apg.), Ryan Anderson (16.2 ppg., 6.4 rpg., 38.2 three-point percentage).\n\nKey additions: Jrue Holiday (17.7 ppg., 8.0 apg., 1.6 spg.), Tyreke Evans (15.2ppg., 4.4 rpg., 3.5 apg.).\n\nOutlook: Holiday, an all-star last season with the Sixers, will run the offense. He and Evans will add a lot to the offense.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nCoach: Rick Carlisle (520-366)\n\nLast year: 41-41 (10th in West)\n\nKey returning players: Dirk Nowitzki (17.3 ppg., 6.2 rpg., 2.5 apg.), Vince Carter (13.4 ppg., 4.1 rpg.).\n\nKey additions: Jose Calderon (11.1 ppg., 7.4 apg.), Monta Ellis (19.2ppg., 6.0 apg., 3.9 rpg.), Samuel Dalembert (6.7 ppg., 5.9 rpg.)."
