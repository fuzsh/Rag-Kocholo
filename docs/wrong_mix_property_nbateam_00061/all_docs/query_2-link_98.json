Once a DJ in Los Angeles, the California - bred music mogul’s journey began in 1973 entertaining the likes of David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen. Contributing to some of the most popular events in and around Greater Los Angeles, Craig Nobles fell in love with music as a DJ and began developing relationships with artists, promoters, and executives alike. Craig Nobles was determined to get the respect from the industry his remarkable talent deserved, all while fine tuning his skills in the areas of marketing, sales, A&R, publicity, and promotions.

Fusing his experience in music and entertainment with technology – Craig Nobles has teamed up with Hip Hop Super Stars, Rock Bands, and partnering with some of the most influential brands to date. The internet music marketing boom has been growing exponentially for two main reasons, one of which stems in artists themselves being more involved in their own marketing efforts and secondly the growth of social media outlets including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and music blogs alike. On the forefront of this trend is SwaggMedia whose platform is about connecting listeners to unique content with premium technology. Craig Nobles, Swaggmedia.com’s founder commented, “The future of music is a combination of technology teamed up with the artist to provide immediate and continuous content. Swaggmedia.com provides just that, an opportunity to reach millions of viewers with their music, products and interviews from the comfort of their home or the convenience of their cell phone.”\n\n4.
