        "text": "Turns out that it’s not just one American sporting icon who has become suddenly human.\n\nAs baseball slugger Albert Pujols struggles to put the big S back on his chest for the Los Angeles Angels, just 30 miles up California Highway 5, the NBA’s own Superman, Kobe Bryant, suddenly looks afflicted by sporting kryptonite.\n\nBasketball’s team of the new millennium, the Los Angeles Lakers, have won seven of the last 12 NBA titles, and Bryant has been the undisputed (OK, maybe disputed for a while by his team-mate Shaquille O’Neal) star of that team.\n\nNow in his 16th season, Bryant is no longer the young scoring phenomenon of his youth, but, on his day, he still regards himself as the best player in the league.\n\nBack in January for example, Bryant scored 48 points against the Phoenix Suns, the most ever by a player in his 16th season.\n\nWhen he came off court, he said: “Not bad for the seventh-best player in the league,” a reference to a pre-season ESPN ranking of the NBA’s top players.\n\nHe went on to score 40, 42, and 42 in his next three games.\n\nSo the competitive fire still burns as brightly as the talent.\n\nBut in Game Two of the second round play-off game against the Thunder in Oklahoma City this week, Bryant looked distinctly average, and especially so in what is usually his time to shine – the final two minutes.\n\nFollowing a disastrous opening to the seven-game series, a 119-90 defeat in which the Lakers certainly looked their age, Game Two had provided a glimmer of hope.\n\nDown by seven points with two minutes left, the stage was set for Kobe Time.\n\nTime for the man who closes games as easily and quickly as Stephen Fry polishing off a crossword puzzle.\n\nWell, Bryant closed the door all right, but not in the way he would have wanted.\n\nThe Lakers, having played brilliant defence to establish a 75-68 lead against the play-offs’ highest scorers with just two minutes to play, conceded nine points while failing to score themselves.\n\nAfter the Thunder made it 75-70, Bryant had the ball stolen by NBA scoring champ Kevin Durant, who cut the gap to three points.\n\nLess than 10 seconds later, a pass bounced off Bryant's hands out of bounds to give the ball back to the Thunder. They couldn’t score, but then James Harden blocked a Bryant shot and made the Lakers pay with a lay-up to make it a one-point game with 58 seconds left.\n\nSurely now, Bryant would take charge, as he has done so many times down the years.\n\nExcept that Bryant missed a three-point attempt with a big fat six seconds still remaining on the shot clock.\n\nOnce Durant had given the Thunder the lead, 76-75, the Lakers had one more chance.\n\nBryant said he was open, but Metta World Peace (more about him below) passed to Steve Blake instead, and his three-point attempt hit the hoop and bounced away.\n\nIt’s just one game in a seven-game series though, right? Just a momentary blip, surely?\n\nWell, in almost any other player, yes. But this was something so different, so utterly shocking, that perhaps this really does signal the end of the Laker dynasty, the end of the Bryant mystique.\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke was in no doubt s to what he had just witnessed.\n\nHe wrote: “I’ve covered Kobe Bryant since he arrived in Los Angeles 16 years ago, and I’ve never seen him fall so completely apart in a moment so incredibly big.\n\n“He muffed it. He dropped it. He bricked it. And in the final seconds, when the Lakers needed him most, he never even touched it.”\n\nOn Saturday night at Staples Center for Game 3, the Lakers Superman Kobe Bryant will have to reach for his cape once more.\n\nOr get his coat.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nImagine Joey Barton changing his name to Eternal Love and Understanding.\n\nQuite apart from deciding which word to have on the back of his shirt, there would be a number of problems to contend with, not least the resultant mirth and stick from the away crowds.\n\nWell, surprisingly I think, no one’s laughing at Metta World Peace any more.\n\nThe LA Laker formerly known as Ron Artest, was always a controversial figure, whether for brawling on court or coming out with provocative statements, and the change in name doesn’t seem to have affected his character too much.\n\nLast month, World Peace (is that name getting any less funny to you yet?) received a seven game suspension for elbowing Oklahoma Thunder guard James Harden in the back of the head after celebrating scoring, and leaving him with concussion.\n\nYesterday, Mr Peace copped one in return, although it looked a lot more accidental than the original incident.\n\nIn case you were wondering about Mr Peace’s new first name, Metta is a Buddhist term meaning loving kindness and friendship towards all.\n\nWorld Peace said before the play-off series against the Thunder started that he would not shake hands with Harden because: “I don’t shake substitutes’ hands.”\n\nAnd this despite Harden having way better season statistics than World Peace.\n\nWhat’s in a name? Evidently nothing at all."
