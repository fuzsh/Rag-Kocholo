        "text": "Good news for Celtics fans hoping to get a Blake Griffin jersey. Griffin met with Celtics reporters on Monday for the first time and among other things revealed what number he’ll wear in Boston – and it’s a unique one.\n\nGriffin told reporters he’ll wear No. 91 for the Celtics this year. It’ll be the first time in Celtics history a player wears No. 91, and just the 10th time a player wears a number in the 90s.\n\nGriffin will also be just the fifth player in NBA history to wear No. 91. Dennis Rodman was the first player to wear it, doing so with the Chicago Bulls in the late 90s. In 2005 Metta Sandiford-Artest, then Ron Artest and later Metta World Peace, wore it with the Indiana Pacers. In recent years, its been worn by Mindaugas Kuzminskas and Deividas Sirvydis.\n\nGriffin had previously worn the numbers 23, 32, and 2 in his career. All three are retired by the Celtics – 23 for Frank Ramsey, 32 for Kevin McHale, and 2 for Red Auerbach.\n\nIn addition to revealing his jersey number, Griffin also gave some background into his signing, including how quickly it happened. “My plan was kind of to wait until after training camp,” he told reporters. “This is the kind of opportunity you couldn’t pass up.”\n\n“Boston is always one of those places as an NBA player where guys are like ‘it’d be a cool experience playing there,'” Griffin continued.\n\nWhile his role remains uncertain, Griffin said he feels healthy and ready to contribute. “I didn’t come here demanding a certain type of role,” he noted. “Just to fill the gaps and to help this team win a championship.”\n\nGriffin said that while he and the team are still working out a plan for him for the immediate future, he is open to playing in preseason games. The Celtics’ next preseason game is Wednesday, at home against the Toronto Raptors. Coverage of that game can be heard on 98.5 The Sports Hub and the Celtics Radio Network starting at 7:30 p.m. ET."
