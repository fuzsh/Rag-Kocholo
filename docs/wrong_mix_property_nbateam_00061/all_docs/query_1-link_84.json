PUBLIC LIBRARY SCL.S1^ Our Present and OurFuture By FREEMAN MORNINGSTAR r 0 WRITE of our present- day San Francisco and her prospects of only a Near ahead automatical- ly forces a comparison of the period just closed and that of 1925 — our city's two greatest years in material growth and expansion. In 1915 one of the great paintings exhibited at our exposition was en- titled \"A Glow of Gold and a Gleam of Pearl,\" and as I think of our city in this year of her greatest material advancement and contemplate her stride for 1927, the title to that pic- ture would seem a most fitting em- blem to depict for us her wondrous wealth and beauty. But this story is essentially one of material progress and of commerce, and we must hurry on to the things prospective — to the great prospects held out for us in the year just be- ginning. I have been a close observer of San Francisco's progress year by year ever since the spring after the great fire of 1906, and now, after this twentieth year, I am going to proph- esy that her second \"coming of age\" year — her year 21 after the fire — will be her greatest. This year — 1927 — will witness the greatest material advancement that has come in all the twenty years of continuous and con- sistent growth since 1906, so that in- stead of $60,000,000 of building con- struction, as 1926 shows, and the greatest in her entire history, we shall likelv come nearer to $70,000,- 000. And what we have cited as tre- mendous growth in building con- struction is finely balanced by the sales of real estate in the year 1926, which approximate $165,000,000, and which are the second item that has never before been equaled in a twelvemonth here in number of sales, though slightly less in volume than 1925. The record of real estate sales in 1927 will very likely far ex- ceed these almost staggering figures of 1926, and we shall probably fur- ther learn in 1927 what really large figures in building construction mean, for a continuance of building construction in large volume means an increase in prosperity, and thus there will be in San Francisco, as in Ijractically all of the great American cities of her class, a steady execu- tion of still larger plans to accom- modate the sure and steadily in- creasing population. Increased build- ing construction and, consequently, increased po|)ulation, spell increased wealth and a larger prosperity for all.

DufFus 'IK host thing about San Francisco, as one sees it when he comes back aft- er wasting five or ten years of his life some- wliere else, is that it is the same old San Francisco. I know this is not the sort of thing that ought to be said to an audience which would naturally like to do more business this year than last, and more next year than this. Hut I don't mean it that way. I don't think the growth in population, the increase in bank clearings, or even the sudden sprouting of hundreds of stucco houses out beyond the Twin Peaks does the city any harm. I can even suggest other j)hysical altera- tions— for example, it might be a good idea to sweep and dust the water side of Hincon Hill. San Fran- cisco sometimes seems a little care- less of its sjjlendors. But what I have in mind is that the essential thing that gives this city a living Ten or clevi'ii years ago \"Bol)\" Duf- fus wrote daily editorials for a San Francisco no\\vsi)a|)('r. 'I'licn New York called him and he l>ought a one-way ticket. Today he is a free lance jour- nalist occupied with an assignment from the New York Times to write about American cities. His article on San Francisco will l)e published shortly. Mr. Duffus has just com- pleted a series of articles for the Carnegie Corporation in coiniecfion with its study of the place of the fine arts in American life. personality — I almost said a soul — manages to survive. What is this (luality? It is as hard to define as it is easy to feel. It is a landmark as jjrominent as the Ferry Building. To begin with, I think it is a spirit of indcix-ndence. San Fran- cisco is practically the only city in the country whicii does not defer to New York. It doesn't care what New York thinks, or what any other city thinks. It lives its own life in its own way. It respects itself. It doesn't imitate. It considers, rightly, that it is just as important for a New York- er, a Londoner or a Parisian to be- come acquainted with San Francisco as it is for San Franciscans to be- come acquainted with New York. London or Paris. Because it respects its own indi- viduality as a city it respects indi- viduality among its own citizens. There is not a community in the country where there is greater toler- ance of the right of the individual to live his own life in his own way. Its traditions, from the days of the gold rush down, are full of outstanding personalities — men who had courage enough to be a little different from the crowd. Nobody threw rocks at them. On the contrary, they were cherished because they made life more interesting. Some of them were good, as the word is commonly used. Some of them were bad. .Some were rich and jjowerful and some were glad to borrow a dollar or a drink from any one gullible enough to lend. But San Francisco gave them elbow room. San Francisco has a sense of humor. It is a poor place for fanatics [oonoluded on page 28] SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 SE SHOES RUCKS The story of a man who decided that automobiles might ju§t as luDell be made in San Francisco as in any other city and proved it by building up a big and profitable business F MEN can make auto- mobiles in Detroit they can make them in San Francisco. Twenty-one years ago a San Francisco black- smith made this observation and hung his leather apron on the hook for the last time. Forthwith the local blacksmithing industry became smaller by one unit and a new truck appeared on the local market. Today Paul Kleiber is turning them out at the rate of about 700 a year, and sell- ing them. This year he will open a branch factory in Los Angeles. \"Sure,\" he says, \"you can make them here! Why not?\" And strangely enough, among the two hundred or more factory work- ers out on Folsom Street are a half dozen or more who \"blacksmithed\" under their present boss when he wore an apron with them, shod horses and serviced runaways. You can tell them from the rest, for they call him Paul. It's a question whether Paul Klei- ber takes greater pride in telling you that men who worked for him twen- ty-five years ago are working for him today, or in pointing to the first automobile truck he ever made. It's still running. The Real Beginning But the story of Paul Kleiber does not begin in a San Francisco black- smith shop, nor even back in 1893, when he reached California, a husky youngster of 22, with a strong back and an eye to the future. It begins away back in a little village in Eu- rope 56 years ago, and because it's out of the ordinary and colorful and not a little inspiring it is recorded here. Paul Kleiber was born in Poland, and at an age when he was hardly big enough to lift a hammer he worked in the shop of a blacksmith. For four years, as an apprentice without pay, his hours were from 5 in the morning until 7 at night. They were long days and gruelling years, and, looking back on them now, he says that his boss might at least have allowed him a lunch hour. However, he survived, and at the end of the fourth year was given a real job — with pay. His wages were 50 cents a week and board. Later, attracted by more money, he moved to Sax- onia and received 75 cents. \"My ambition,\" he says, \"was to get to the United States, but I had no money. So I went on foot to Amster- dam and was arrested there because 1 was broke. They kept me in jail for three days and then took me by train to Belgium. I went to Antwerp and tried to get a job on a ship bound for the United States. But no luck. I slept in a haystack for two weeks. I wanted to be arrested again as I was hungry, but even the police didn't want me. \"From Antwerp I went on foot to Germany and arrived in Solingen. There I got a job at a dollar a day and bought my own food. I saved enough money in seven months to buy a ticket to America. I reached Chicago in 1892 with 50 cents in my pocket and no friends. For six weeks I worked there, and at the boarding house w^here I lived people talked of California. It was the land of op- ])ortunity, they said. Everyone here was rich — San Francisco was the great center of it all — to hear them tell it, it was an enchanted city. I made u\\) my mind to come here. \"I landed in Omaha with 25 cents. I made a little money in Denver, but (continued on paKe 12| 10 SAX FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 Pillars of^^^ange By Sidney I^ PRESIDENT SAN FRANCISCO ERE a San Franciscan to view from a point of vantage the city's inter- esting and impressive business skyline in pan- orama before him, and call to mind events, persons and in- stitutions which were forces in its building, he might easily fail to re- cord one of those groups whose force and influence is an ever in- creasing factor in the industrial and financial growth which makes our city's profile stand preeminent among the cities of the West. The great cities of the present day exist at the sufferance of supply and demand. As market places they arose, and as market places they must continue to prosper. In the early dcveloi)ment of cities we find the ever-shifting routes of trade and the stern comi)etition between mar- ket places have left a wake of ruined cities and abandoned comnmnities across the world. Although economic evolution has brought conditions in- finitely more stable in the matter of sui)ply and demand, due to popula- tion growth and industrial expan- sion, and we are less and less de- pendent U|)on the shifting routes of trade; nevertheless, our cities must cherish their market |)laces if they would fortify their strength as cen- ters of industry and commerce and culture. Among our markets, through the era of big business which brought us the corporation, the security mar- ket has risen to an increasingly im- IJortant place in our industrial life and financial affairs. Security mar- kets, viewed in comparison with commodity markets, which date back to the days of individual barter, are comparatively new, and this ac- counts, perhaps, for the fact that their economic functions and indus- trial influence are not understood by many, even among those who claim knowledge of financial affairs. Third in the Nation Our local security market, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange, according to the statistics of volume of business for its fiscal year just closed, ranks third among the secur- ity markets of the nation. The San Francisco Stock and Bond l-^xchange was organized in 1.S82. and as a fi- nancial institution it has made its mark, and it has more than kept pace with its colleagues in the business world. Its growth of volume of business during the last few years has, in fact, fai- outstripped the city's growth of |)opulation. or ttie growth of the banking field, as shown b> the figures of bank clearings. In the short space of ten years it lias experienced an increase in the monetary volume of business in stocks jiassing over its floor by more than KiOO i)er cent, which is a most astounding figure, and perhaps re- flects more completely than any other the rapid rise in the strength and importance of San Francisco as a financial center. The value of its membershiijs has increased from the initial price of SoO ])er membership to .\"^lO.OOO, which price is surjiassed only by the price of membershii)s in the New York Stock Exchange. The total value of all the securities sold on its floor during the year just closed amounted to the substantial sum of .S427,()(m.()()(). In earlier years this market was dominated by the securities of the public utilities, the banks, the jiow- der corporations, the sugar concerns and the insurance companies. With the discovery of oil and the rapid growth of that industry the securi- ties of the more stable of this group have played a dominant i)art in the exchange transactions. But (laliforr nia's leading |)ositi()n in hydroelec- tric ])ower (levelopiucnt and the con- se(iueiit e\\i)ansion of manufacturing have brought to the floor of the ex- cli:nige in ever-increasing number the securities of corporations in these fields of business. Bank stocks, throughout the year, have been the centi-r of wide inter- est, and the exchange has felt the |r<mtiiiuc(l dm piiBC Hi) SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 11 MAYBE WE GET IT-AND MAYBE WE DON'T \"By G. B. DODDS Washington Representative San Francisco Chamber of Commerce f ~|;^E Federal budget sys- tem has brought about I many changes in the management of Uncle 'A Sam's Government, one of the most important of wiiicli was unforeseen by the budget founders but whicli is now receiv- ing the very active attention of lead- ers in Congress. This w^as the vir- tual confiscation of the influence of the individual congressman in ob- taining appropriations for his home district. Before the advent of the budget the member of Congress was a man to be reckoned with in seeking ap- propriations. He was sought out not only by the constituents at home who wanted government funds for some project, but also by the gov- ernment official who wanted an in- crease in his allowance for some of- ficial activity in the member's dis- trict or state. The House Appropria- tions Committee in those days was all-powerful. Its members would create fear and trembling whenever they walked into an executive office and demanded a special favor. They virtually ruled the Government, es- pecially the members of the majority party, which, of course, included the chairman. The dickering would begin soon after Congress convened in Decem- ber and would last all during the session. During some short sessions, which always end March 4, the squabbling over appropriations would not be finished when Con- gress adjourned, and the President would have to call a special session immediately to complete the appro- priation bills or else the government departments would run along short funded as best they could. Appro- priation issues were usually joined with general legislative issues so that the members able to roll the most logs brought home the most bacon. If one could sit in the cloak room of the House he would often be re- galed with tales of the member of the i)ast who returned home like a veritable Santa C^laus, burdened down with l'\"ederal i)rojects for his district. They still talk of the wide swaliis through the mustard cut by .Julius Kalin of San Francisco, who was resjjonsible more than any other man for tlie jjresent Presidio and many other Federal activities al San l-'rancisco. You will hear stories of how \"Big Bill\" Kettner carried the navy to San Diego, where millions of dollars have been invested, nearly all during Kcttner's tenure of office. To go back still further, they will recall the days when Francis W. Cushman of Tacoma was known as one of the greatest \"go-gettem con- gressmen\" of his day. Cushman, they say, could get a marble post of- fice building for a town of log huts. The budget brought an end to all this. It is now made up in Washing- ton while the members are at home mending their fences. It is prepared at conferences by members of the (Cabinet with their own executive staffs, and later in conferences with the budget director, so that by the time the members return to the na- tional capital the budget for the next fiscal year is virtually finished. The members are not even permitted to know what is in or out of the budget until the first day of the session, when the President's budget message is sent to the speaker's table, so there is virtually no chance to bring about influence for the addition of projects over which the budget di- rector has turned thumbs down. (concluded on page 17] 12 SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 From Horse Shoes to Trucks (continued from page 9] Twenty-five years ago you got your beer wagon oiled and greased by the nearest smithy. Even then Paul Kleiber boasted a sizable pay roll, and many of the boys in the lower picture are still with him. They beat their plow- shares into fenders, so to speak, and made a go of it. Mr. Kleiber is shown in the center with hat and watch chain. «;. the first night on the road two men took it from me. The next morning I got a job in Greeley, Colo., and worked there for a month or two, then started westward again. Most of the distance from Colorado to Cal- ifornia was traveled on foot or under freight ears. \"In 1893 I reached San Francisco and took u]) the work of my trade. At the end of three years I had saved $.')0(), in addition to the money that I had sent regularly to my peoijle in Poland. With that ii!500 I started the l)resent Kleiber (Company.\" That, in his own words, is the story of the early life of a man who thinks iuitomobile trucks can just as well be made in San Francisco as Detroit. In 1906 he was completely wiped out by fire, and started again. In 1913 he sold his business to the pres- ent Kleiber Motor Company for $13(),()0(), and today his factory is turning out trucks at the rate of $2,000,000 worth a year. And still growing. Perhaps he is right. Lincoln Exhibits New Six-Brake First it was the two-wheel brake, then the four, and now, heralded as the last word in safety and effici- ency, comes the six-brake. Latest model Lincoln automobiles, now on display in the show rooms of Edward Lowe Motors Company, are equipped with this new device, which, it is claimed, assures ])ositive oi)eration under all conditions. The service brakes, operated by the foot pedal, on all four wheels, are of the internal self-energizing type. Each wheel brake comprises tiu-ee shoes — primary, secondary and auxiliary — which oi)erate against the brake drum, providing effective braking surface on all wheels. The mechanical linkage of this system is so designed and construct- ed that it is i)ermanently set to exert 4.\") per cent of the braking action on the front wheesl and .'),\") per cent on the rear wheels. SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 13 HEN winter comes to California it drops a mantle of snow over the rugged skylands and provides a magnificent playground for all forms of hibernal recreation. All seasons in California have an irresistible appeal, but it is left to winter to provide the diversion which has made the Golden State far-famed for the variety of tem- peratures w'ithin the confines of its borders. California is blessed beyond most states in that winter here is ojjtional. One may bask in the mild sun at a balmy beach, or within a few hours toboggan down the side of a snow- ribbed mountain. Few regions of the world can offer the variety of cli- mate that favors California. Truckee and Yosemite have long been known as favorite recreational spots for the outdoor enthusiast who yearns for the bracing i)leasures of the wintry fastnesses, but this year a new principality will enter the Kingdom of Winter Sjjorts. The re- gion around Lake Tahoe, world fa- mous mountain lake, is accessible by rail in winter for the first time and takes its place with the other popu- lar winter resorts at Truckee and Yosemite. Lake Tahoe has been called \"San Francisco's Playground,\" but here- tofore, due to its inaccessibility in the winter months, its recreational facilities have not been available ex- cept in the summer. Now, while members of organizations in San Francisco indulge in the annual ceremony of going surf bathing, their fellow citizens may be skim- ming over the icy trails at the fa- mous mountain resort. Lake Tahoe is 6,000 feet above the sea level, in the Sierra Nevada, a lake so vast thxit a steamer travels 72 miles to skirt its shores. It is 23 miles long, 13 miles wide and has an area of 190 square miles. It is more than a quarter of a mile in depth, where bottom has been found. Its great depth prevents it from freez- ing over in the winter, no matter how low the thermometer may drop, and the steamer that takes visitors for the marvelous journey around its shores makes the trip twice a week in the winter season. With its crys- talline waters bordered by snow- covered mountains and the pictur- esque taverns and chalets nestling among the silvered pine trees. Lake Tahoe is one of America's most en- trancing inland waters in winter as well as in sunniier. While the summer months at Lake Tahoe are a tonic, the winter season there is probably as wholesome and invigorating as at any other resort in the world. Winter's mantle en- hances the summer loveliness of Lake Tahoe.

The sunmier activities at Lake Tahoe give way to their seasonal counterparts when w'inter comes. The pleasures of boating, fishing, hunting, swimming, yachting, golf and hiking are forgotten in the ex- hilarating pastimes of skating, sleighing, curling, mushing, tobog- ganing and hockey. Three toboggan slides, one of them almost two miles in length, have been constructed near the Tavern at Lake Tahoe. Scores of toboggans large enough to acconnnodate eight, ten or twelve people are available for the guests. The three slides, with high-banked turns and with varying degrees of speed, will provide thrills for even the most venturesome visi- tor.

If :i man spoils material, his lost time is a money loss sustained by the group. If one or more men do good work on material, before some one nuMuher of Ihc group sjioils it, the lost time is that nuich nuiltiplied. It is to every man's a<lvantage not to pass along to his fellow workers his own defec- tive work and to be on the lookout for defects in work i)assed on to him. \"Under the group bonus |)lan the careless, lazy, sciuabbling. dishonest. dissatisfied or otherwise trouble- some worker becomes answerable to his fellow workers as well as to the management.

Old friends remain, new friends are won by this famous motor car. Brilliant achievement is the basis for this high regard. Today, Buick has an engine vibrationless beyond belief, the century's finest contri' bution to the pleasure of motoring. And a score of other exclusive features testify to the never-ceasing search by Buick for the new and better thing. The Sealed Chassis, Vacuum-Cleaned Crankcase and Thermostatic Circulation Control are typical examples. Buick could not offer so much at so moderate a price, if the world did not buy so many Buicks, and if the savings of great volume were not continually poured back into Buick quality. Look to leadership for value. Only a very satisfactory motor car could have held first place for nine consecutive years! HOWARD AUTOMOBILE CO. LOS ANGELES .

So, in turn, the securities of all the state's major industries and enterprises find a market on the ex- change, and the investing public finds an ever-widening selection of securities for the investment of its funds.

Its source is the outlet for that great reservoir of surplus cajjital seeking investment, the shore line of which reaches to the most remote community of the nation, and from whose discharge flow the sus- taining funds of industry. The growth in the number and variety of securities admitted to list- ing is a tribute to the exchange as a broad market for the securities of California and the entire West. Not only have local corporations found it advantageous to list their securi- ties on this exchange, but eastern corporations as well have found a distinct advantage in placing their securities at the easy command of California's investing public. This growth has taken place in the face of more rigid requirements and greater costs for listing securities on the exchange. One of the outstand- ing requirements of listing is that the corporations who wish to list their securities are required by spe- cial agreement with the exchange to publish an annual financial state- ment to their stockholders once each year and supply them with an earn- ings statement covering the same pe- riod. Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the value of this require- ment as a protection to the public, and it is only fair to our corpora- tions to say that they have met this requirement unhesitatingly and with splendid co-operation. LINCOLN SERVICE for San Francisco Motorists \"There are no yearly or periodic Lincoln models; the Lincoln has reached such a state of development that drastic changes are neither necessary nor desirable. \"Whenever it is possible to achieve an improvement in the Lincoln, it is made interchangeable with previous design. \"Thus the Lincoln owner is permanently protected against the arti- ficial depreciation that invariably results from an announcement of new models.\" LINCOLN Division of Ford Motor Company EDWARD LOWE MOTORS COMPANY Lincoln Sales and Service Dealers Van Ness at Jackson While it is true that many of Cali- fornia's corporations have grown from small industrial enterprises into the field of national business, and their securities have become listed on the New York Stock Ex- change, that splendid national pri- mary market; nevertheless, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange has proved a valuable secondary market in such securities. It also serves as a primary market for a vast number of other successful en- terprises in the public utility, com- mercial, manufacturing and other industrial fields. California's natural resources have always played a pre- eminent i)art in its commercial and industrial advancement, but recent years have seen the rise of new man- ufacturing enter])rises more or less independent of a natural resource, based upon our location as a dis- tributing center to important new markets. Paralleling the outstanding growth in its business the exchange has per- fected the marketing system in keep- ing with the financial demands of the area which it serves. It has ad- vanced to the system of post trad- ing, the most modern of trading de- vices. It has installed the stock quo- tation ticker service, which gives the investing public of San Francisco and vicinity instantaneous informa- tion relative to transactions on the exchange, and is equijiped with gen- eral floor facilities to expedite the execution of orders and complete transactions between members. The establishment of the position of spe- cialist, by which certain members confine their activities to a limited number of stocks and remain con- stantly at the floor location where such stocks are traded in, has pro- vided a trading convenience for the rai)i(l execution of orders which is to be found on no other exchange in the I'nited States with the excep- tion of the New York Stock Ex- change and the New York Curb. The exchange operates as one of its departments a clearing house, through which all transactions be- tween members are settled. Prior to the establishment of the clearing house transactions were settled di- rectly between the offices of mem- bers. A firm actually received all of tlie stock which it had purchased and gave checks to all those member firms from whom it made those pur- chases; and likewise, in the case of sales, it had to make deliveries to all those firms individually to whom securities were sold upon the floor of the exchange. This was a very laborious task and required a small army of messenger boys running back and forth between member firms and going to the transfer office of the corjjoration to have the se- curities transferred into the names of the i)urchasers. The clearing house avoids all this detail and makes it j)ossible for the broker to [continued on page 18] SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 17 Maybe We Get It-And Maybe We Don't Even after the budget message is made public it is almost impossible to add any new items, owing to the rule of the House Appropriations Connnittee not to increase the budget estimate of any bureau or depart- *■ ment. The House committee, rather, bends its effort to cut the budget estimates just as the budget bent every effort during the previous summer to cut the estimates of the department heads. Then when the bill reaches the Senate that commit- tee tries to cdt some more, for they all want a hand in the credit for sav- ing the taxpayer's dollar. Mr. Cool- idge has made governmental econ- omy popular as well as practical, and it is now \"good politics\" to be economical with government apjiro- priations. The virtual elimination of the members of Congress from i^artici- pation in appropriation matters has been given considerable thought by congressional leaders during this session. With the congressmen out of it almost entirely. House leaders are wondering whether or not they are fostering a bureaucratic, central- ized Government that may be unre- sponsive to the wishes of the people. Most of the executive officials in Washington are easterners, many of whom have never been west of the Mississippi River. What they know of the West and its matters has been gleaned from letters, government pamphlets and reports and their own school text books. They are also just as likely as not to be unsympathetic with the desires of the West, prefer- ing to say no rather than yes to pleas for government aid, because it is easier, requiring less justification and in line with the general eco- nomic trend in Washington. House leaders have no desire to curtail the control of the Budget Bu- reau over government expenditures, but they believe some part of the former congressional influence should be restored. This could be done by lifting the ban of secrecy on budget activities prior to the receipt of the President's budget message on the first day of each session of Con- gress. If the member back home had made a plea for Federal aid he should know whether his plea had been re- ceived favorably or not so that if the budget director's decision was nega- tive the member could perhaps bring further influence to bear. It is also believed that the member should be able to ascertain what action the budget director has taken on any ac- tivity within his district so that he may properly look after the interests of his constituents. None of the advocates of increas- ing congressional influence over ap- propriations desires to minimize the [continued from page 11] great value the Budget Bureau has brought to the Government. It has substituted careful, scientific study of the government problems for the political, haphazard system of log- rolling in effect before. The point they make is that the budget goes a step too far in usurping autocratic power over the Government's dollar. A little more congressional influ- ence would leaven the loaf, restoring a greater degree of popular govern- ment without giving way entirely to political control. It should be borne in mind that, as a rule, no one in the government service knows his district better than the congressman. He knows what it has, what it needs and what it should not have better than the average bureau official in Washing- ton.

The same economy of time, money and labor is to be found on the purchasing side of his transactions. The clearing house, therefore, performs for him the fol- lowing functions.

Since all the trans- action.s of a given day must be set- tled on the following day, it is easy to appreciate the convenience effect- ed by the installation of the clearing house system. Also the clearing house provides a complete protec- tion for members in the consumma- tion of transactions in that it re- ceives nothing but certified checks and delivers no money without the receii)t of the securities to cover. In the matter of banking accommoda- tion, experience has shown that where the total volume of business in ;i given day attains, for example, $3. ()()(), (too, the transactions are con- summated by the actual exchange of about .$l,00f),()(l(). The banks have found the installation of the clearing house not only a greater conveni- ence, but also a genuine protection. The exchange has always done those things which have been nec- essary to surround the transactions with greatest security for its mem- bers and the general investing ])ub- lic. An additional recent protection is the ado])tion of the plan of com- pulsory audit, whereby under the rules of the exchange each member is required to be audited at least once each year by a certified public accountant acceptable to the ex- change, and to file a report with the exchange covering such audit. This plan of inciuiry into the financial standing of the exchange members is in line with the practice on the New York Stock Exchange and some of the other leading exchanges of the country. With reference to the fi- nancial stability in the stock broker- age field it is interesting to observe some of the figures recently pub- lished by the New York Stock Ex- change, which show that in 1925 the percentage of failures in national banks was 1.3(5, and of all American banks 1.6, and of commercial houses 1.05, while among the members of the New York Stock Exchange firms .09. Recently compiled figures for the member firms of the San Fran- cisco Stock and Bond Exchange show .035, which is a marvelous rec- ord, since it covers not only a single year, but a forty-year jjcriod. While it is obvious that the ex- change, through its rules and regula- tions, h;is always framed its legisla- tion with a keen sense of its respon- sibility to the ])ublic, there arc also other safeguards which are the out- growth of the exchange as an or- ganized market, which may be more cle;u-ly comprehended by a brief dis- cussion of the functions of the ex- change and the economic part it plays in modern finance. The fore- most and perhaps the most funda- incnlal economic service i)crforme(l l).\\ a stock and bond exchange is that it renders instantly negotiable the res|)cctive securities in which it SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 19 deals. The full value of this service can be gauged most effectively by recalling what happens when the vital quality of negotiability is lack- ing. This situation has been experi- enced by every one who has had oc- casion to convert into money quickly properties or commodities which have no organized market, such as farm products or real property. Such a conversion may mean an unrea- sonable loss. The position of our exchange as a marketing center standing ready to make its securities instantly nego- tiable can be realized best when the collective value of all its securities is recalled. The present total value of all stocks and bonds listed for trading on the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange approximates !i!5.265,295,000. Ever present in the mind of the investor, regardless of th-e amount of his investment, is the question of the salability of the securities he has purchased. Were it not for the fact that the great organized security markets of the United States stand ready to absorb and make liquid these investments, it would be im- l)ossible for corporations to have de- veloped to their present magnitude and extent. One of the interesting discoveries of the recent World War was that the small investor through- out this nation is a factor to be reck- oned with in corporate financing, and we find many of our best in- formed and largest corporations catering particularly to this class. Therefore the ability to realize quickly on his holdings has given confidence to the small holder to place his money in corporate securi- ties, and the major corporations of the nation find among their stock- holders, partnei's in the enterprise, an ever-increasing group of small investors. The exchanges, too, provide the fairest possible prices for the securi- ties in which they deal. (Concerning this aspect of organized markets, Judge Grosscup of the United States Circuit Court once said: \"The ex- changes balance like the governing of a machine the otherwise erratic course of prices. They focus intel- ligence from all lands and the pros- pect of the whole year by bringing together minds trained to weigh such intelligence and to forecast the prospects.\" A highly organized mar- ket where current prices have the full benefit of free and unhampered interplay of speculative and invest- ment forces is like a delicate balance which comes to a resting place only after having measured the full weight placed on either side of the scale. If a stock is too high, the selling forces beat it downward, or if it is too low the purchasing forces boost it upward. Thus the price at any moment is considered the fairest [continued on page 21] CROCKER FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO CROCKER FIRST FEDERAL TRUST COMPANY STATEMENT OF CONDITION at Close of Business, December 31, 1926.

And while that most powerful arm of all things financial in our city — the bank — has had wonderful pros- perity and growth, in still greater proportion has grown the business of the score or more of great bond houses who have their increasingly fine offices in the heart of our local Wall Street. Their tremendous oper- ations in originating and selling with unprecedented swiftness enormous new local issues of all kinds of high- grade bonds and preferred stocks, and others that are not of local ori- gin, were very greatly in excess of any year in the history of the city — perhaps a strong 50 per cent increase over 1925, and very greatly in ad- vance of 1924. The president of the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange told the writer two weeks ago that the busi- ness of the local exchange in 1926 had far eclipsed any previous year's continued from page 5] business — to be exact, 74 per cent greater than 1925; $426,000,000 against $243,000,000— and was only second in volume to the business of the great New York Stock Exchange. Thus the exchange and the dozen or more large stock brokerage houses saw prosperity in 1926 on a scale un- known to them in any previous year. New and greater records will also be recorded by these wonderfully active financial agencies ere 1927 has come to its close. But back of this tremendous growth in finance, real estate sales and unprecedented building records we might with profit inquire the whyfore and whether the great in- creases thus noted have in fact a sound base. The answer is an af- firmative one, and capable of easy proof, viz: First, San Francisco is only grow- ing about the normal pace of other major American cities — perhaps a little in advance of some which have smaller fields of support, and are not fortunate in being a great world seaport and a great inland water port as well. Second, the larger American cities grow faster than their lesser neighbors and faster than the ratio of the country as a whole. But only to keep up with the country as a whole would give San Francisco no small annual increase in population and wealth, for the United States from 1910 to 1920 increased 13,500,- 000 people, and four years were war years, when immigration was en- tirely stopped. It is now officially stated that the period 1920 to 1930 will see our country increasing by 20,000,000. Forty-five states can be safely counted upon to annually send a part of their present and increas- ing populations to reside permanent- ly in California, bringing much of their wealth with them. Third, new factories, many of them representing lines not hereto- fore manufactured here; new pack- ing plants and consequently large in- creases in kindred industrial enter- prises. And what is still more grati- fying is that nearly all of our hun- dreds of old factories and packing [concluded on page 28] STATEMENT OF THE FRENCH AMERICAN BANK of San Francisco COMMERCIAL — TRUST — SAVINGS Member of the Federal Reserve System and the Associated Savings Banks December 31, 1926 RESOURCES Cash on Hand and in Banks $ 2,942,036.51 Coin and Currency in our vaults and Deposits with The Federal Reserve Bank and authorised depositaries.

As an outgrowth of the establish- ment of the fairest prices, exchange quotations form the basis of the value of securities as collateral for loans at banks. The Government ac- cepts these figures as the soundest prices obtainable; private individ- uals and corporations determine the value of their security holdings upon the basis of these prices, so an end- less chain of acts and computations is predicated upon these prices which are universally accepted. There is another valuable function of an organized security market, and that is its ability to prevent fraud. The proper functioning of an ex- change makes impossible two lead- ing kinds of frauds: first, the placing on sale of misrepresented and worth- less goods, and, second, inequitable methods of effecting purchases and sales. The exchange committee, whose duty it is to pass upon the ap- plications for the listing of stocks upon the exchange, investigate with the greatest care every security be- fore it is placed on the floor as a listed security for trading. The fi- nancial position of the corporation is determined, its past performance in the matter of earnings is investi- gated, and its business reputation and the character of its officers and board of directors are weighed with care; and all these factors play a part in the action of the committee in approving a security for listing. With respect to inequitable methods of trading, the rules of the exchange and the ethics of stock brokerage place these methods on the highest business plane, and they stand in severe contrast to the trading meth- ods in the average unorganized mar- ket. It should not be misunderstood that the exchange guarantees the success of those corporations whose securities are listed, but it does in- sure the absence of fraud. The ex- change is the unrelenting enemy of the promoter or vendor of worthless securities, and the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange, as well as many other leading exchanges throughout the country, has been an important factor in removing fraudulent stock operators from their communities. Stock exchange prices serve as a barometer of future business condi- tions, and an eminent authority has even gone so far as to say: \"Without an exception, every business depres- sion in this country has been dis- counted in our security markets from six months to two years before the depression became a reality.\" While it is true that business men do not always take these warnings seri- ously, nevertheless the barometer stands there to be read by those who have the understanding and appreci- ation of what it foretells. The exchange performs many ad- ditional functions: it is an important factor in the carrying of surplus pro- [concluded on page 25] One Hundred and Eighteenth Half Yearly Report THE SAN FRANCISCO BANK SAVINGS COMMERCIAL INCORPORATED FEBRUARY 10th. 1868 One of the Oldest Banks in California, the Assets of which have never been increased by mergers or consolida tions with other Banks MEMBER ASSOCrATED SAVINGS BANKS OF SAN FRANCISCO 826 CALIFORNIA STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA DECEMBER 31st, 1926 Assets — United States Bonds, State, Municipal and Other Bonds and Securities (total value $32,674,080.26), standing on books at $29,573,305.89 Loans on Real Estate, secured by first mortgages 69,335,912.91 Loans on Bonds and Stocks and other Securities 1,776,558.10 Bank Buildings and Lots, main and branch offices (value over $1,880,000.00), standing on books at 1.00 Other Real Estate (value over $60,000.00), standing on books at 1.00 Employees' Pension Fund (value over $565,000.00), standing on books at 1.00 Cash on hand and checks on Federal Reserve and other Banks 11,090,787.56 Total $111,776,567.46 Liabilities — Due Depositors $107,226,567.46 Capital Stock actually paid up 1,000,000.00 Reserve and Contingent Funds 3,550,000.00 Total $111,776,567.46 GEO.

The foreign trade in and out of the port for the twelve montlis ending June 30, 1926, exceeded $400,000,000, the highest ever recorded in a nor- mal year. Preliminary figures for the calendar year 1926 show a fur- ther increase to nearly $420,000,000. The volume of foreign trade has long since suri)assed that of the war pe- riod and the annual value figures at present prices are fast approaching the record of $480,000,000 made dur- ing the war inflation. In addition to her foreign trade, San Francisco during 1926 ex- changed commodities with Hawaii valued at more than $140,000,000. There is also the intercoastal trade through the Panama (]anal with At- lantic and Gulf jjorts of the United States which amounted to $200,000,- 000 during the past year, the Pacific By HENRY F.GRADY Manager Foreign and Domestic Trade Department, San Fran- cisco Chamber of Commerce coastwise trade worth well over a billion dollars, and the rich inland watcrwav conmierce valued at ap- ])roximately $725,000,000. In all, the commodities passing over the wharves of the port of San Francisco during 1926 were valued at approxi- mately $2,500,000,000, or more than $7,000,000 for every day in the year. The cargo shijjped in and out of San Francisco has a high unit value, and during 1926 amounted to nearly $05 a ton. Foreign cargo tonnage amounts to 3,800,000 tons; Hawaiian, 1,750,000 tons; intercoastal, 2,500,000 tons; coastwise, 21,500,000 tons, and inland waterways, 10,500,000 tons, making a total of approximately 40,- 000,000 tons. There are two outstanding fea- tures of the San Francisco trade which make it desirable from a trad- er's point of view. In the first place, the trade is balanced, and in the sec- ond it is diversified.

SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA approximately equal. A diversified trade is also highly desirable. Just as a crop farmer suffers severely from an off season or a market slump, so a one- or two-commodity port experiences a sharp tlei)ression when demand for its commodities falls off and production is cut. There are but few articles listed in official rei)orts in which San Francisco does not show a good proportionate trade. San Francisco does a large busi- ness in many commodities, including exports of canned and dried fruits, barley, petroleum products, canned asparagus, automobiles, raw cotton, cigarettes, redwood lumber, wheat flour, canned milk, rice, leather, canned salmon, canned sardines, dy- namite, motion picture films, etc. In imports important commodities are sugar, silk, coffee, copra, coconut oil, cocoa bean, tea, crude rubber, jute bags and burlaj), newsjjrint ija|)er, tin, nitrate of soda, cigars, canned crab meat, peanuts, diamonds, canned pineapples from Hawaii, etc. Substantial gains are indicated in most commodities, according to pre- liminary returns, especially in canned and dried fruit, raw cotton and barley exports, and raw silk, sugar and coconut oil imjiorts. The commerce of San Francisco is based on sound foundations. Proba- bly no less than 90 per cent of the shipments from this port originate in the trade area immediately adjacent, and an equally high percentage of receipts are destined for use of the 2,000,000 persons in central and (continued on pate 2 J) pOMPLETE ^-^ brokerage serv- ice for clients carry ing conservative margin accounts. special Market L etters on %equesLj DIRECT PRIVATE >XIRES TO CHICAGO & NEW YORK I^C]30NNELL ^lembers: 'N.ew York^Slock^f'xchange SAN FRANCISCO 633 Market Street Phone Sutter 7676 OAKLAND 1404 Franklin Street Phone Glencourt 8161 New York Office 120 Broadway SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 23 Men's Clothes, a $ 1 5,000,000 Industry RACTICALLY every gar- ment worn by men is made right here in San Francisco. Neckties, sweaters, shoes, under- wear, top coats made of special knit cloth, belts, hats, caps and gloves. The remainder of a man's wearing apparel which comes from San Francisco's factories will liave our attention in this article, and when we have completed the survey we shall find that our men's apparel manufacture covers practically ev- erything in the category except white collars, collar buttons, hosiery and shoestrings. It is true, of course, that in some branches of our apparel industry we are stronger than in others. For in- stance, we do not make here, in quantity, a man's street shoe, but we do manufacture thousands of pairs of the heavier types of shoes, and San Francisco is headquarters for the manufacture of the fancy cow- boy boot. A $15,000,000 Industry This is the neckwear manufactur- ing center of the West; we have the largest belt-manufacturing plant in the West, and we manufacture and ship more gloves than any other city in the West. Taking the output of our 73 men's wear manufacturing plants, we find that W'e have here a $15,000,000 industry in this line. Now, concerning San Francisco's output of (1) the coarser garments, such as work clothes and boys' play- suits; (2) men's street suits and coats, and (3) shirts, garters and miscellaneous. In the field of work clothes, such as overalls, flannel shirts and the like, San Francisco is the center of I)roduction for the entire West. In fact, San Francisco is the home of the overall. It was here that the cop- I)er-riveted overall was invented and it has been made here since 1872. The plant that was the originator of this feature still lays claim to being the largest manufacturer of overalls west of Chicago, although there are several other very large manufac- turers of this line in San Francisco. Two of the dozen plants here which make overalls, among other items, employ about 500 people each. To gain some idea of the size of one of our lilants, consider that in one the cutting tables are 190 feet long, which means two-thirds of a block in length. All of the plants produc- ing the denim garment make, as a rule, additional lines of shirts, pa- jamas, i)laysuits, etc., one of them, during the summer season, turning out between GOO and 650 dozen com- pleted garments a day. This corpora- By CAPEN A. FLEMING Manager Industrial Department San Francisco Chamber of Commerce tion has a large branch factory in Indiana, while another of these large concerns maintains a similar branch factory in Portland, Ore. A unique feature in clothing is being introduced by one of our man- ufacturers, this being the use of the bookless fastener, or zipper, used so extensively on tobacco pouches, women's handbags, etc. By the use of this device on a boy's playsuit — a line of garment turned out in great quantities by San Francisco plants — the waist front is closed by pulling the slide from bottom to top. The manufacturer who is using this de- vice declares that his playsuits with this novelty will be found all over the West in a few months.

More than a quarter of a million new Buicks were built and sold during the cal- endar year just closed, and the final registration figures will reveal that nearly 19,000 were sold in this state. This figure will top by approximate- ly 5,000 the greatest sales year Buick has ever experienced in the state. It is also worthy of comment that since the announcement of the new series Buick models August 1, 1926, the suc- ceeding weeks have shown steadily gro^ving increases over the corre- sponding periods of previous years. The complete Buick line comprises seventeen models, built on three chassis of different wheelbase. Two of these chassis, referred to as the \"Master Six\" Buick, are powered with the same motor. All three lines are complete with open and enclosed models, and all in colors of coronation duco. Many improvements and refinements in both chassis and bodies will be studied with interest at the automo- bile show, because of wide publicity that has been given features incor- porated in the new models. Revenue Freight Loading Revenue freight loading in 1926 totaled 53,309,644 cars, the largest number of cars loaded in any year in the history of the railroads, ac- cording to the car service division of the American Railway Associa- tion. The year 1926 was also the first year in which loadings aver- aged more than a million cars a week. The loading in 1925 totaled 51,224,152 cais: in 1924, 48,534,433 cars, and in 1923, 49,812,113 cars. Our Ocean Commerce (continued from page 22) northern (California v.hose economic activities are brought to world focus through the (lolden Gate. During the year 1926 more than 13,700 ships passed in and out of the (lolden Gate, and they had a net reg- istered tonnage of 31,417,450 tons. These figures include only commer- cial shi])s and rigidly exclude all naval vessels of the United States and other countries. Shijjs calling at .San Francisco range from the great round-the-world floating cities down to the small lumber schooners that nose into tlu' shallow bar harbors of the noilhcin coast, but the average si7.e for 1926 is 2,300 net registered tons, which confirms the testimony of the San Francisco hill dweller that the ships that pass tlirough the Golden Gate are mostly big ships. It is interesting to note that ten years ago the 10,201 ships to i)ass through the gate had a net registered tonnage of 14,1()0,512, an average per ship of 1,400 tons. The evolution of the carrying trade, including the vir- tual elimination of the picturesque sailing ship, is clearly evidenced in these statistics, as is also the growth of the water-borne commerce of the port. The port of San Francisco is the only combined ocean and river port on the Pacific Coast. The Sacra- mento and San Joaquin rivers tap an inland empire composed of the val- leys of similar names which is larger than all of the states of New Eng- land. San Francisco Bay is their nat- ural outlet, and the river shipping adds greatly to the water-borne wealth of the port. In 1925 the water-borne commerce of the port of San Francisco was greater, both in tonnage and value, than the combined water-borne com- merce of Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles. Preliminary reports for 1926 indicate that the lead taken by San Francisco will be maintained and very likely increased. This does not mean that the whole Pacific Coast is not progressing. Quite the reverse. During the last ten years the foreign trade of the Pacific Coast increased 333 per cent compared with an average increase for the en- tire country of 192 per cent. The commerce of San Francisco has doubled twice during the past two decades. From all indications this pace will be maintained during the coming years.

It sustains the risk of industry and trade, and through its facilities for and the forces of speculation and in- vestment, many a corporation has been carried from the unsecure posi- tion of its founding to the estab- lished position of maturity. In considering the functions of our own exchange we find it exerting its influence in nearly every field of in- dustry and finance, and its mem- bers serving daily through the fa- cilities of their firms as financial counselors for the entire investing public. The number and kind of se- curities that are now available to in- vestors are so great and so complex that the field of security distribu- tion and marketing has become a profession, and so the broker is a financial adviser and gives profes- sional service to all who may ask it. It is interesting to note as to the charge for service in the earliest broker's agreement in the archives of the New York Stock Exchange, dated May 17, 1792, the commission agreed upon for service was one- quarter of 1 per cent on the spe- cial value of the stock. On stocks selling on the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange at prices be- tween $10 and $100, which repre- sents the range most commonly dealt in, the price is now only 25 cents a share for small lots, and 22i/4' cents per share in lots of 100 or more. This is particularly remarkable when one stops and recalls the vastly increased costs of doing business and the ex- tensive facilities that are now put at the hands of customers, which at the earlier date were unknown. It is only the large volume of business that makes this small charge possi- ble, and yet from the customer's viewpoint he receives a service in financial advice and in facilities placed at his command far out of proportion to this small charge. Another thing that the exchange has done to build up the profession of commission brokerage is to foster an institute composed of the em- ployees of member firms, which in- stitute carries on an extensive edu- cational program not very different from the educational program of the American Institute of Banking, which has now attained nation-wide proportions. The institute of the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange is unique among the exchanges of the country, and no doubt will be the basis of other educational pro- grams throughout the nation. That the economic functions of the modern exchange are not clearly un- derstood, nor the exchange's relation to industry and finance fully appre- ciated, is not difficult to understand, for its functions are complex, its field highly specialized and its points of direct public contact few, and these circumstances account for the fact that the place of the San Fran- cisco Stock and Bond Exchange in the building of San Francisco's im- posing skyline may not have been realized. \"Nothing can be added to Perfection\" 15 Stories of Elegance and modern conveniences will be a daily stimulus if you make the FINANCIAL CENTER BUILDING 405 Montgomery Street, at California Your Office Building Ready February 1 Make your reservations through FRANK C.

However, we have one man- ufacturer here whose i)lant occupies two large floors of a loft building, this plant i)roducing men's, youths' and boys' suits, men's Norfolk out- ing suits, and overcoats. Eight years ago the factory was started with only three machines. Today there are forty machines installed and the l)ro(iuct is shi|)ped into five states. Hesides the wholesale manufac- turer, just referred to, and the many individual retail tailors, there are four other jjhases of the clothing in- dustry, all of which are rejjresentcd in .San Francisco. One of these is the contract tailor. In this class of the business certain work rooms spe- cialize in vests, or pants, or coats. These loft factories make garments for merchants or for other tailors under contract. There are several of these contract tailors here. A sec- ond type is the cut-make-and-trim tailor, to whom the goods and mea- surements are sent by tailors un- equijiped to handle all the work which comes to them. Of this type of loft industry there are two in San Francisco. Another type is the wholesale tailor who has his agents throughout the trade territory tak- ing orders direct from the consumer; while the fourth is the wholesale tailor who sells suits from sample books which he i)laces in the hands of the smaller merchant. These books contain samples of the goods and pictures of the styles from which to choose. San Francisco's one mail order tailor has his style books in the stores of merchant agents throughout the western states, Alas- ka and the Hawaiian Islands. 3,000,000 Fairs of Garters .Xnother division of men's wear in- dustry is the manufacture of shirts, pajamas, garters and miscellaneous api)arel not already considered. Two concerns make suspenders in addi- tion to other lines. One of these makes men's garters of the tyi)e com- monly worn, as well as arm bands. Our men's garter manufacturer war- rants more than i)assing mention, as this factory emjiloys 17.\") iieople and turns our .'},()()().()()() |)airs of garters annually. The ()uti)ut is sold in 37 states and exi)orted to foreign coun- tries. In certain markets, like New Zealand, San I'raneisco-made garters dominate the trade. Mackinaws, corduroy i)ants, golf knickers, athletic underwear, |)a- jamas and shirts are maniifaclm-ed lieie in large (piantilics. Fanc\\ hand- made noveltv handkerchiefs are made here by one concern for men and women, the i^roduct being sold in the New York market and throughout the country. A certain flannel shirt is made here under a trade name which is famous throughout all the western states. But we not only make flannel and work shirts here. We have whole- sale manufacturers of shirts for the business man, their product retailing as high as $5 and $6 a shirt. These wholesale shirt manufacturers in al- most every case make also jiajamas, athletic underwear and kindred arti- cles. Besides the manufacturers of shirts on the wholesale basis we have six custom shirt makers here, one of them being the largest west of Chicago, and occupying three floors. This manufacturer has eight sales- men who regularly cover sixteen states. This custom-made shirt fac- tory is modern and complete in every detail, even to having its own laundry in which all shirts are serv- iced before being shii)i)ed. A Paris office is maintained. An eastern mil- lionaire sojourning in California was outfitted with a su|)ply of shirts, nightwear, lounging robes, etc., all made by this manufacturer, and the amount of this order came to very nearly $4,000. Such an incident suf- fices to show the preeminently high quality of the output of this San Francisco manufacturer.

WALTHER WOLF 625 Market Street Garfield 6354 28 SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS, JANUARY 12, 1927 City with a Living Personality [continued from page 8] and not the best place in the world for stuffed shirts and higli hats. San Francisco has what nine-tenths of American communities lack — a real gusto for living. It takes the strug- gle for existence as the '49ers did — with vivacity and gaiety. It rec- ognizes that there are two sexes in the world and is not ashamed of the fact, and it rejoices in eating and drinking. It is short on hypocrisy and long on generosity. It runs to meet life instead of running away from it. Finally, like every city which stands where two civilizations meet, it is romantic and adventurous. We can consider its trade with the Ori- ent in terms of dollars and cents, and that is important. But we can also think of it in terms of a stimulant to the imagination, and that is more imj)ortant. Either way I think of it, the future of San Francisco dazzles me. I don't know that humanity will be any happier here, or any better, than it is elsewhere, but I think it will always live more fully and vig- orously than in almost any other city. And some day the fog and the ships and the hills and the sting of western winds and the wheeling gulls and a laughter-loving popula- tion comi)Ounded of many races will express themselves so that the world will have to listen, in music, art and literature. I would not put it beyond San Francisco to give old Athens a run for its money. It can if it has the courage to be itself. The Better Wage A New Ernst & Ernst Booklet For Manufacturing Executives and Bankers Group Bonus Labor Payment is a simple, prac- tical plan whereby labor receives higher wages, while the manufacturer cuts his costs and secures better control. When a manufacturer pays workmen for the re- sult of their individual operations instead of for the results of cooperation or group effort, he must provide a substitute for cooperation in the form of close supervision and complicated accounting. He must realize that his substitute is at best a poor one because of the expense of it and the wasted time, wasted materials and other wastes, which he can not control. \"The Better Wage,\" a new Ernst & Ernst book- let of 32 pages, is a concise analysis of Group Bonus Labor Payment prepared for the considera- tion of Management. There are no expansions of argument, untried theory or technical detail. The text is confined to the simple essentials of adequate and dependable information arising from success- ful experience.

LOUIS KANSAS CITY OMAHA NEW ORLEANS JACKSON DALLAS FORT WORTH HOUSTON SAN ANTONIO WACO SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES San Francisco in 1927 [continued from page 20] plants have enlarged their plants to an extent much greater in value than the scores of new plants established here in the past two years. Few peo- ple who have not carefully studied the situation have any adequate idea of the present magnitude of San Francisco's real backbone as repre- sented in her wonderful jjresent and fast-growing factory and ])acking in- dustries. For sixty years San Fran- cisco has manufactured a large i)or- tion of the nation's sugar — both cane and beet. Cofte, too, has been a sta- ple here with many very extensive plants, and the fisheries and their packing plants have long been estab- lished, and are known the world around. And fourth, the port of San Fran- cisco is one of the world's greatest, and the ownership here of many of the great steamship lines of America puts San Francisco on a parity with all the great seaport cities of the world. Fifth. While no record is had at tliis time of growth along jobbing and wholesale lines, which doubtless has been very great, it is well known that the volume of retail business in dry goods and general merchandise of our great department stores and the large nmsic houses shows very large increases in sales and net earn- ings. In 1926 the greatest Christmas buying in the city's history was re- corded, and 1927 will far exceed even the great business experience of 1926. Sixth. About 100 apartment houses of from 25 to 100 apartments each have been erected, and literally miles of new homes, many of costly de- sign, have gone up in Sea Cliff and St. Francis Wood, the great Sunset district and the many new districts all the way from the Richmond over to and beyond Twin Peaks during 1926. And what is most interesting to note is the fact that nearly all of these costly apartments and miles of new homes are occupied. This is almost as true of the hundreds of new business buildings, hotels and theaters erected in these new dis- tricts and in the Mission. And, finally, we learn from the Wall Street News that \"nearly all the major oil companies show larger earnings for the first nine months of 1926 than were shown for the whole year in 1925. Many of them will report the largest i)rofits in his- tory.\" This means several hundred million dollars of entirely new wealth in the nation and another reason why we should expect un- usual i)rosperity here in San Fran- cisco in 1927, where oil stocks in these major companies are held in such large volume. The oil industry, it is probably safe to say, is now third in the nation, being led only by steel and automobiles.
