        "text": "How Daryl Morey plays the clown in Leslie Alexander’s circus\n\nM\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n75 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 6, 2014\n\n--\n\n“Daryl knows that I judge him all the time. I’ve told him. He’s not shy about it, either. He just knows that’s the way I operate. Why wouldn’t I? The General Manager is the one person in your organization you can really judge.” — Leslie Alexander, February 2013\n\nDuring his epoch as Assistant General Manager and subsequent General Manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey has consistently exhibited a fundamental lack of vision in regards to talent, as well as an inability to properly construct a basketball team. Amidst his tenure under Leslie Alexander — franchise owner since 1993 — Morey has made a substantial amount of transactions predicated on his own previous gaffes, which glare when illuminated.\n\nConceivably because of the immediate Championship success experienced by Alexander upon purchase of the Rockets, the onus has transferred to Morey to refrain from rebuilding while trying to remain a Championship-caliber squad.\n\nAfforded the inheritance of a winning team, Morey since has shown a preference to eschew the rebuilding process while shrewdly and calculatedly handling the salary cap; signing and trading players at a striking clip, permanently biding time to jump on a premier Free Agent.\n\nWhen he lucked into obtaining James Harden from the Oklahoma City Thunder in October 2012, his handling of past assets appeared to prove redeemable.\n\nAffording to sign Dwight Howard the very next year appeared to justify the previous five years solely as strategic.\n\nNo doubt Morey created a path to be in a position to eventually sign both Harden and Howard, certainly a by-product of informed salary cap manipulation. His path is also full of draft errors, zero development of philosophy or system and routinely poor talent evaluation.\n\nBUILDING A CHAMPION\n\nSince the inception of the National Basketball League, only the 1983 Philadelphia 76ers and the 2004 Detroit Pistons have won Championships without major contributions from their own drafted future Hall of Fame players.\n\nCheeks and Prince were major contributors, although neither is expected to be ever selected into The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The Detroit Pistons fired Cheeks from his position as Head Coach in February 2014, while Prince currently plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nEven with Hall of Fame selections being controversial and subjective, franchises with the best draft records and systems are the most successful.\n\nOver the last twenty seasons of the NBA — exactly since Houston last won a title — eight franchises have been crowned Champions. Seven different superstars drafted by their respective franchises, built around and ultimately rewarded through the process.\n\nNot every franchise player drafted within the last twenty years has won a ring with their respective teams yet. However, the Champions over the same time-frame have all drafted at least one star player and built a winning team around them via patience, trades, Free Agency navigation and future drafts.\n\nWithout either a system, team concept or successful drafting record, there is no history of success.\n\nLeslie Alexander and Daryl Morey are attempting to achieve success without experiencing failure. Refuting implosion and the residual damage suffered prior to the restoration process. The losing process. Cleaning house. Re-setting the today and tomorrow of the franchise by stopping to take a breather.\n\nMorey has built a rickety foundation, and his miscalculations complicate his achievements.\n\n“You just have to ask: Is the GM helping the team have playoff success? Is he giving the team a chance to win the title?” — Daryl Morey, May 2009\n\nDARYL MOREY\n\nApril 03, 2006: Houston name Morey Assistant General Manager of the Rockets; to supersede General Manager Carroll Dawson next season\n\nJune 28, 2006: Selected Rudy Gay (first round, eighth pick) and Steve Novak (2nd round, 32nd pick) in the 2006 Draft\n\nJuly 12, 2006: Traded Rudy Gay and Stromile Swift to the Memphis Grizzlies for Shane Battier\n\nJuly 14, 2006: Traded a 2008 first-round pick (Maarty Leunen was later selected) to the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for Kirk Snyder and a 2008 second-round pick (Sasha Kaun was later selected)\n\nOctober 2, 2006: Signed Scott Padgett as a Free Agent\n\nOctober 20, 2006: Signed Bonzi Wells as a Free Agent\n\nFebruary 13, 2007: Traded Scott Padgett to the Grizzlies for Jake Tsakalidis\n\nMay 10, 2007: Morey assumes General Manager position for Houston\n\nMay 13, 2007: Rockets relieve Coach Jeff Van Gundy\n\nMay 18, 2007: Rockets hire Coach Rick Adelman\n\nApril 18, 2011: Rockets and Rick Adelman part ways\n\nMay 27, 2011: Rockets hire Coach Kevin McHale (four years — last year team option)\n\nMay 04, 2013: Rockets and Morey agree to four-year contract extension\n\n“When I hired Daryl, it was because I wanted somebody that was doing more than just looking at players in the normal way. I mean, I’m not even sure we’re playing the game the right way.” — Leslie Alexander, February 2009\n\nGetting rid of the Swift contract — signed in 2005 for four years at $22 million — was paramount on Morey’s list immediately upon taking over the Rockets. Battier, drafted sixth overall in 2001 by the then Vancouver Grizzlies, was a smarter if less-expensive player known for intelligence and durability.\n\nBattier would eventually prove to be an integral player on several winning teams throughout his career, including two consecutive Championships with the Miami Heat from 2012 — 2014.\n\nGay would help the Grizzlies to the playoffs in both the 2010 — 2011 and 2011 — 2012 seasons. Gay and Battier would even team up on the Grizzlies’ ‘10 — ‘11 season to defeat the San Antonio Spurs in a historic first-round playoff match-up, ultimately losing to Oklahoma City Thunder in Game Seven of the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nMorey has proven thus far winning statistics does not necessarily translate to winning basketball.\n\nDRAFTING CHOICES vs. OPTIONS\n\n“Leslie has an approach I totally agree with. He really believes that we need to turn the corner while remaining competitive. That’s the plan. I do think being terrible is definitely the way to get better in the NBA, but it’s not the way Mr. Alexander wants to go about it. He wants to turn the corner, get back to having a strong foundation while remaining competitive.” — Daryl Morey, November 2011\n\nThe 2007 and 2013 Drafts were mostly irrelevant due to the Rockets’ respective drafting positions, an indictment against the overarching vision in Houston. The 2008 — 2012 Drafts were disasters enough to warrant a further inspection into the priorities and expectations of the Rockets franchise.\n\nWith many General Managers, mistakes are required to be traded away, often for less-than equal value. Morey’s record is no different; he just hasn’t learned from his previous mistakes. He believes in his system even though his system has proven to be a first-round exit in the Western Playoffs at best.\n\n2007 DRAFT\n\nLess than two months after being promoted to General Manager (and after the ‘06 — ‘07 Rockets finished the season under Dawson/Coach Van Gundy at 52-30 and qualified for the first round of the playoffs), Morey made his first-ever Draft selections. He chose Aaron Brooks with the twenty-sixth pick of the first round, traded for the rights to thirty-first pick Carl Landry in the second round and selected Brad Newley with the fifty-fourth pick in the second round. On Draft Night, Houston acquired the fifty-fourth pick from Orlando in exchange for cash considerations.\n\nMorey’s first suitable transaction came when he acquired the rights to Carl Landry from the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for cash and a 2008 second-round pick (eventually Sasha Kaun at fifty-six); a great move betrayed by his refusal to acknowledge talent (Afflalo, Splitter, Gasol). The Australian Newley never played a minute in the NBA, while Morey and the rest of the League decided not to draft Joel Anthony nor Gary Neal.\n\nPerhaps too easy to use hindsight as an exposition for lack of foresight, the selections of Brooks and Landry exasperated the signing of Free Agent Steve Francis less than one month later in July 2007.\n\n2008 DRAFT\n\nA Draft so loaded with talent, it would be difficult to miss a key future player.\n\nOn Draft Night:\n\nHouston traded Nicolas Batum to the Portland Trail Blazers; the Memphis Grizzlies traded Donté Greene and a 2009 second-round draft pick (Sam Young was later selected) to Houston; Portland traded Joey Dorsey to Houston; and the Trail Blazers traded Darrell Arthur to the Grizzlies.\n\nNot only did this trade greatly benefit Portland, an equally determined Western hopeful for years to come, the evaluation of talent behind said trade made it erroneous. The mistake was compounded by the depth of the draft, with Morey left to miss on a bounty of players who would literally go on to directly impede the future of the Rockets franchise.\n\nMorey selected Maarty Leunen with his fifty-fourth pick. Leunen has yet to play in the NBA.\n\n2009 DRAFT\n\nIn August 2008, Morey dealt away the Rockets’ ‘09 first-round pick to the Sacramento Kings, ultimately for the salary relief of Metta World Peace. Sacramento would choose Omri Casspi with the twenty-third pick.\n\nIn another Draft stacked with talent, Morey was then forced to trade/pay for draft choices, and elected to pay the Washington Wizards $2.5 million for Jermaine Taylor, the thirty-second pick of the second round.\n\nTaylor would go on to be traded in December 2010 for a conditional second-round pick which never materialized, one of several transactions where the Rockets would receive nothing on their end of the deal.\n\nTwo picks later, Morey agreed to pay a record $2.25 million to retain the rights to Sergio Llull. Drafted by the Denver Nuggets with the thirty-fourth pick in the 2009 Draft, Houston then bought his draft rights from Denver. Llull has yet to join the NBA.\n\nMorey acquired the draft rights to forty-fourth pick Chase Budinger from the Detroit Pistons in exchange for a future second-round pick and cash. Notably undrafted in 2009 were Wes Mathews and Alonzo Gee.\n\nJuly 2009 is also where Morey committed what was another peculiar move for the future of the franchise:\n\nDAVID ANDERSEN\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 37, 2002; Atlanta Hawks)\n\nJuly 14, 2009: Andersen’s draft rights were traded from the Hawks to the Rockets for $2 million and a future second-round draft pick. Houston then paid a $500,000 contract buyout to Andersen’s Spanish club, FC Barcelona.\n\nAugust 12, 2009: Signed a three-year contract with the Rockets worth $7.5 million, with the third year of the contract being a team option\n\nJuly 28, 2010: Traded by the Rockets to the Toronto Raptors for cash and a 2015 second-round draft pick\n\n“We scouted the globe, we didn’t like our options at a center among the US free agents, so that’s why we were pretty aggressive with Atlanta to get his rights.” — Daryl Morey, July 2009\n\nHow was Andersen rated so high and so expensive yet so expendable one year later? Originally signed to back up Yao Ming, Morey received nearly nothing in return for the disposal of Andersen, a player for whom he traded real cash and assets.\n\nThe varying degree of value for any given asset can change with perception and circumstance; the existence of the asset does not get denied. The value behind fruitless picks’ is opinionated; the value behind $2 million dollars directly misspent due to another misstep by the international scouting department is not.\n\n2010 DRAFT\n\nMorey again passed on several now-established players with his lone ’10 selection when he drafted Patrick Patterson fourteenth overall.\n\nPatterson would be traded to the Sacramento Kings in February 2013 for Francisco Garcia and Thomas Robinson.\n\n“We feel like Thomas Robinson has a lot of upside for the bigger goal of getting back to being a contender. He’s a guy we really think has the potential to be our starting big man.” — Daryl Morey, February 2013\n\nRobinson would be traded six months later to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nWith no additional assets, Morey joined the League in neglecting to draft Jeremy Lin.\n\n“I talk to other General Managers about this all the time, and Kevin McHale says this: ‘There are only forty or fifty obvious NBA guys who can create a real edge, and the rest rely on opportunity, role, coaching, opponent and hope that comes together with their attitude and work ethic.’ This is not a science, and never will be.” — Daryl Morey, February 2012\n\n2011 DRAFT\n\nAnother unreasonable draft by Morey as he first selected Marcus Morris with the fourteenth pick, again above several higher-quality players.\n\nMorris was traded in February 2013 to the ambitious Phoenix Suns for what eventually became Isaiah Canaan (thirty-fourth pick) in 2013.\n\nDue to the Ted Stepien Rule which restricts teams from trading away future first-rounder picks in consecutive years, the Rockets were prohibited from trading their 2012 first-round draft pick. The Terrence Williams trade, which sent Houston’s lottery-protected 2012 pick to New Jersey, restricted the Rockets from trading their 2012 first-rounder.\n\nPick-twenty-three, although more nuanced than just a straight-up player-for-player trade, ultimately saw two different drafted players switch teams: Nikola Mirotić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rights to Donatas Motiejūnas. Both picks left several additional legitimate players on the Board.\n\nOne of Morey’s earliest questionable transactions as General Manager was in 2008, when he traded the contract of ‘06 Rockets Draft selection Steve Novak to the Los Angeles Clippers for nothing more than the option to swap places at the 2011 Draft.\n\nMorey exercised this option on Draft Night, as he chose Chandler Parsons in the second round with the thirty-eighth pick.\n\nAfter including Parsons in the initial overall Mirotić-for-Motiejūnas trade, Morey then bought Parsons back from Minnesota for cash.\n\nThese details make the eventual outcome of Parsons’ career with Houston unfortunate, as well as off-setting the benefit of the aforementioned Novak trade beyond salary relief.\n\n“No one could predict how good Chandler would be. We obviously thought he was very good or we would not have picked him but his success should be attributed to him and his hard work.” — Daryl Morey, April 2013\n\n2012 DRAFT\n\nJeremy Lamb was selected twelfth, over both Moe Harkless and John Henson; two of the only post-top ten players currently successful in the bare 2012 Draft.\n\nHouston first neglected to select Henson, then lost the opportunity when Milwaukee chose Henson with the fourteenth pick. This Draft pick was previously traded from Houston in the Samuel Dalembert salary dump transaction in June 2012, necessary because Dalembert was signed as a Free Agent in December 2011 — which required the Rockets to waive Jeremy Lin to make a roster spot for Dalembert.\n\nLamb was a solid pick, and understandably included in the James Harden trade executed three days before the 2012 — 2013 season began.\n\nMorey then chose Royce White with the sixteenth selection.\n\n“We wanted Royce. I thought at 18, we might not get somebody that terrific, but we did. Royce, all our guys love him. They think he will be a real star in this league.” — Leslie Alexander, June 2012\n\n“Basketball is sort of an interesting sport that the top player on your team makes so much more of an impact than the top player in any other sport. Any other of the major team sports. There’s no other sport where Lebron James can have a team winning three out of four games or sixty games out of eighty, and then when he leaves, that basically the same team wins twenty games out of eighty. That kind of a swing just shows you the impact. You need these elite talents to win in this league. We think Royce is an elite talent—top five talent in this last draft, which was very deep.” — Daryl Morey, November 2012\n\nA gifted athletic power forward in an anemic draft, White was equally ill-famed for his reputation:\n\n2007 — 2008: As a high school junior, he was suspended for the first two games of the season and later dismissed from school.\n\nOctober 2009: Suspended from 2009 — 2010 NCAA Division I season at Minnesota:\n\nNovember 2009: Pleaded guilty to theft and disorderly conduct for an incident in October 2009. He was accused of taking $100 worth of clothes, and of fifth-degree assault when he allegedly pushed a mall security officer to the ground.\n\nNovember 2009: White was initially a suspect in a campus laptop computer theft incident, but was not formally charged with trespassing until January 2010.\n\nFebruary 2010: Left Minnesota when he was charged on the allegations of the laptop theft incident.\n\nWhite did not flourish with the Rockets and was traded along with Furkan Aldemir and cash to Philadelphia in July 2013 for a draft pick which never materialized.\n\n“I take some sort of pride in that you could argue that Royce White is the worst first-round pick ever. He’s the only one that never played a minute in the NBA that wasn’t just a foreign guy staying in Europe. It just shows we swing for the fence.” — Daryl Morey, January 2014\n\nTerrence Jones was then selected with the eighteenth pick, and remains one of the few draft selections to continue to play for the franchise since being drafted by Morey.\n\nAn already meager draft haul by Morey, Jones would be arrested after his rookie season in July 2013 for allegedly stomping a homeless man’s leg.\n\nTwo 2012 deadline deals allowed the Portland Trail Blazers, operating under interim GM Chad Buchanan for the entire season, to exchange in a salary dump with the Rockets, and trade with the Brooklyn Nets, directly damaging Houston’s future:\n\nMarch 15, 2012: Portland traded Marcus Camby to the Rockets in exchange for Hasheem Thabeet and Jonny Flynn. Portland also received Houston’s second-round draft pick in the 2012 NBA draft, selecting Will Barton with the fortieth pick.\n\n“Hasheem was someone who could realize that potential that was seen in college, so it’s very similar to the Terrence Williams trade, in that, as we investigated the issues we felt that there was a good chance that a change of scenery could allow him to realize his potential — that’s how we feel about both of them.” — Daryl Morey, February 2011\n\nMarch 15, 2012: Portland then traded Gerald Wallace to the Brooklyn Nets for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams, and New Jersey’s first-round top three-protected pick 2012 draft pick. All four players acquired in the trades held expiring contracts, meaning they would be Free Agents at the end of the season.\n\nHired two months after Nets’ majority owner Mikhail Prokhorov gained approval of ownership in May 2010, General Manager Billy King sought veterans with a win-now approach, regardless of salary.\n\nThe Blazers went on to select 2013 Rookie of the Year Damian Lillard with the sixth pick of the Draft in 2012, previously traded to them from Billy King for Gerald Wallace.\n\nBrooklyn still held Houston’s 2012 protected first-round pick from the Williams trade:\n\n“It’s not like we got completely out of the draft.” — Billy King, March 2012\n\nThe pick would roll over into the ‘13 — ‘14 season, be traded and ultimately become Shane Larkin.\n\nDecember 15, 2010: Houston traded a future first-round draft pick to the New Jersey Nets; the Rockets traded Sergei Lishouk to the Los Angeles Lakers; the Lakers traded Sasha Vujačić and a 2011 first-round draft pick (JaJuan Johnson was later selected) to the Nets; the Nets traded Terrence Williams to the Rockets; and the Nets traded Joe Smith, a 2011 second-round draft pick (Darius Morris was later selected) and a 2012 second-round draft pick (Robert Sacre was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJuly 11, 2012: Atlanta traded Joe Johnson to the Brooklyn Nets for Jordan Farmar, Anthony Morrow, Johan Petro, DeShawn Stevenson, Jordan Williams, a 2013 first-round draft pick (Shane Larkin was later selected) and a 2017 second-round draft pick.\n\nJune 27, 2013: Dallas Mavericks traded sixteenth pick Lucas Nogueira, Jared Cunningham and forty-fourth pick Mike Muscala to the Atlanta Hawks for eighteenth pick Shane Larkin.\n\nJune 25, 2014: New York Knicks traded Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton to the Dallas Mavericks for José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, Wayne Ellington, Shane Larkin, a 2014 second-round draft pick (Thanasis Antetokounmpo was later selected) and a 2014 second-round draft pick (Cleanthony Early was later selected)\n\nAmongst Phil Jackson’s earliest front-office transactions, this move freed up monies partially allocated to resigning Anthony, strengthened the Knicks roster through potential Draft steals and heightened the aggressive Western Conference by sending Chandler to Dallas.\n\nMorey then became responsible for the opportunity for Portland to pair both Lillard and Batum with Lamarcus Aldridge; responsible for the opportunity for Dallas to pair both Chandler and Parsons with Dirk Nowitski.\n\n2013 DRAFT\n\nAs a result of the modest success of the preceding season — as well as past exchanges which involved trading away two first-round and two second-round draft picks — Morey was forced to select early in the second round, choosing Isaiah Canaan at thirty-four with his lone 2013 selection.\n\nNotably not drafted in 2013 were Phil Pressey and Troy Daniels, making Daniels the second undrafted player to positively impact the Rockets franchise/postseason, after initially being looked over and discarded.\n\nThe pick used to draft Isaiah Canaan came directly from trading Marcus Morris to the Phoenix Suns in February 2013, whom the Rockets beforehand selected with the fourteenth pick of the 2011 Draft.\n\n“I reminded him (Canaan) he got picked ahead of Chandler Parsons so he’s got a lot to live up to in terms of second-round picks, which is totally unfair. But I think he’ll live up to it. I really see a kid who’s going to succeed.” — Daryl Morey, June 2013\n\n2014 DRAFT\n\nAgain short on picks, Morey selected Clint Capela at twenty-five and Nick Johnson at forty-two. Although not initially expected to contribute early, the picks still glossed over the potential behind several other high-ceiling players in yet another deep Draft.\n\nMorey would later purchase the drafting rights to Alessandro Gentile from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the fifty-third pick.\n\n“Capela has we thought the highest upside out of the top few guys in the draft. Obviously, the draft is about upside. We think this guy has a chance to be a very high level player in the League. We feel like we got two guys that can help us right now in Johnson, very accomplished player who could potentially come in and crack our rotation and Gentile, who is another guy who could come in and crack our rotation” — Daryl Morey, June 2014\n\nA successful franchise has a recognition for young talent, a strong international scouting department and a sharp understanding of business and finance, specifically salary rules and the Collective Bargaining Agreement. With talent as the foundation to any successful operation, the lack of a proper evaluation of talent disrupts the entire process; without talent the remaining parts necessary for success are rendered obsolete, or at the very least have their ceilings exposed early.\n\nWithout knowing the future ceiling of any draft pick, perhaps the only element greater-than or equal to talent is a system. A system where talent can flourish; a system strong enough to support less-talented players still able to thrive when given a role.\n\nUnder the direction of Morey and three different Head Coaches, the Rockets thus far have failed to build any sort of sustainable, proven system nor draft or develop any long-standing talent.\n\n“The studies being published on how long it takes to get back to contention after having a top draft pick all suffer from a fatal flaw. There is a tight historic correlation between poorly-run franchises and top draft picks that generally does not go away once you make a top pick.\n\nHowever, when well-run franchises get the number one asset in the NBA, a top five player in the draft on a rookie scale contract, watch out. Not to mention the value of a well-run franchise getting multiple top draft picks on rookie scale contracts.” — Daryl Morey, March 2014\n\nROUNDABOUT OF TALENT\n\nA linchpin to Morey’s financial approach to roster-building has been to forgo long-term contracts, featuring a predilection to usher in and out a rotating cast of players. The problem then becomes not an issue of overpayment or difficult contracts, but a lack of consistency and structure.\n\nNo team is signed through Free Agency; players are. A team must be built. A team takes time and direction.\n\nWhen talent is incorrectly appraised, the obligatory remedy is to recognize and remove the transgression with sparse franchise impairment.\n\nMorey and his front office have dealt with several of the same players over the years, whether via draft or free agency, resulting in a wide and simply illogical scale of value for each player.\n\nA considerable number of players have had multiple employments under Daryl Morey and the Rockets, while several other players have been questionably acquired or traded. The egregious values assigned to each player forced Morey to envenom the potential future of the franchise.\n\nAARON BROOKS\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 26, 2007; Houston Rockets)\n\nJune 28, 2007: Selected twenty-sixth in the 2007 Draft by Houston\n\n2009 — 2010: Most Improved Player Award\n\nFebruary 24, 2011: Traded to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a 2011 first-round draft pick (Nikola Mirotić was later selected)\n\nMarch 05, 2013: Signed with Houston as a Free Agent\n\nJune 29, 2013: Released by Houston\n\nJuly 19, 2013: Signed with Houston as a Free Agent\n\nFebruary 20, 2014: Traded to the Denver Nuggets for Jordan Hamilton\n\nMorey made a respectable first-round pick in Brooks, and even received fair value in the 2011 trade with Minnesota.\n\nBrooks was able to build a solid groundwork to his career in Houston, although unable to become a foundation player. He was signed and traded two times, signed and released once by Morey in a seven-year span. His final exit from Houston in 2014 required his agreement.\n\n“I just like it there. I’m glad they still wanted me to come. My kids have moved around a lot. That’s another dynamic about it. My kids have been to several places the last couple of years. So it’s good to go back to somewhere they are familiar with.” — Aaron Brooks, July 2013\n\nSTEVE FRANCIS\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 2, 1999; Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nJuly 20, 2007: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston (two years / $6 million)\n\n2008 — 2009: Francis used his contract option to return to the Rockets. He was unable to play in the beginning of the season due to his injury recovery period.\n\nDecember 23, 2008: Houston traded Steve Francis, cash and a 2009 second-round draft pick (Sam Young was later selected) to the Memphis Grizzlies for a 2011 second-round draft pick. Houston did not receive the second-round draft pick, as it was top-fifty-five protected.\n\nNovember 2010: Out of NBA\n\nRecap:\n\nMorey drafted/purchased the rights to both Brooks and Landry in June ‘07; signed Francis to a two-year deal in July ‘07; traded Francis, money and a draft pick for zero return in December ‘08.\n\n“I think he sees this as a rebirth, as a restart of his career. When you have a chance to add a talent like Steve who really fits what Coach is trying to do, you do it.” — Daryl Morey, July 2007\n\nPrior to the ‘07 season, Francis could not make the rotation, as he lost out to both Rafer Alston and Mike James. Francis averaged 5.5 points and three assists in ten games before undergoing season-ending surgery stemming from an earlier injury.\n\n“I tried to play the people who we feel are playing the best. But you’ve got to make some decisions right now and move on and hopefully people are going to be professional enough who don’t get time.” — Coach Rick Adelman, October 2007\n\nLUIS SCOLA\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 56, 2002; San Antonio Spurs)\n\nJuly 12, 2007: Traded by the Spurs with Jackie Butler to Houston for Vassilis Spanoulis and a 2009 second-round draft pick (Nando De Colo was later selected)\n\n2007 — 2008: NBA All-Rookie First Team\n\nJuly 13, 2012: Rockets waived Scola via the Amnesty provision, clearing his salary off the Rockets’ salary cap.\n\nInitially acquired by Morey as a low-cost hidden gem, Scola was eventually claimed off waivers by the Phoenix Suns in 2012 with a partial claim bid; Phoenix agreed to pay Scola $4.5 million per season for the next three seasons, with Houston paying the remainder of the $31 million.\n\n“Major credit to Rockets owner Leslie Alexander for his willingness to pay $17.5 million for one of his best players to not play for him, all in the name of salary cap flexibility to pursue the opportunities necessary to return the team to championship contention.” — David Weiner, July 2012\n\nJOEY DORSEY\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 33, 2008; Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nJune 26, 2008: Houston traded Nicolas Batum to the Portland Trail Blazers; the Memphis Grizzlies traded Donté Greene and a 2009 second-round draft pick (Sam Young was later selected) to the Rockets; the Trail Blazers traded Joey Dorsey to the Rockets; and the Portland Trail Blazers traded Darrell Arthur to the Grizzlies.\n\nFebruary 18, 2010: Houston traded Joey Dorsey and Carl Landry to the Sacramento Kings; Houston traded Tracy McGrady to the New York Knicks; New York traded Jordan Hill, Jared Jeffries and a 2012 first-round draft pick (Royce White was later selected) to Houston; New York traded Larry Hughes to Sacramento; Sacramento traded Hilton Armstrong and Kevin Martin to Houston; and Sacramento traded Sergio Rodriguez to New York. Houston also had the option to swap first-round draft picks with New York in 2011 but did not do so.\n\nSeptember 2011 —June 2014: Out of NBA\n\nJuly 15, 2014: Signed with Houston as Free Agent (two years / $2 million)\n\nThe initial drafting/trade for Dorsey was amongst Morey’s largest blunders; bringing him back in 2014 continues the trend of improperly evaluating players and not learning from the failures of the past, regardless of adjusted price.\n\n“He went through a tough year with injuries to both feet, and you know, if you’re a basketball player, you don’t want injuries in your knees and your feet — those are the two worst spots.” — Daryl Morey, July 2009\n\nVON WAFER\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 39, 2005; Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nSeptember 29, 2008: Signed with the Rockets\n\nAfter Wafer moved to a team in Greece, the Rockets offered him a contract midway through the next season. After he signed but failed his physical, Wafer was unable to join Houston.\n\n2012: Out of NBA\n\nAfter he shined for the Rockets during his brief employment, Wafer chose to sign with a Greek Euroleague club after failing his physical. More bad luck than poor business, Morey was forced to watch Wafer leave while getting zero in return.\n\nTREVOR ARIZA\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 43, 2004; New York Knicks)\n\nJuly 08, 2009: Houston signed Ariza to a contract using the Disabled Player Exception allowed by the League through the injury of Yao Ming (five years / $34 million)\n\nAugust 11, 2010: Houston traded Trevor Ariza to the New Orleans Hornets; the Indiana Pacers traded Troy Murphy to the New Jersey Nets; New Jersey traded Courtney Lee to Houston; and New Orleans traded Darren Collison and James Posey to Indiana.\n\nJuly 20, 2012: Houston traded Courtney Lee to the Boston Celtics; Boston traded JaJuan Johnson, E’Twaun Moore, Sean Williams and a 2013 second-round draft pick (Àlex Abrines was later selected) to Houston; Boston traded Sasha Pavlović to the Portland Trail Blazers; and Portland traded Jon Diebler to Houston.\n\nJuly 12, 2014: Houston executed a sign-and-trade for Ariza as a Free Agent (four years / $32 million)\n\nRecap:\n\nMorey lucked into using the DPE to obtain Ariza, the best Free Agent on the market in 2009; signed Ariza to a five-year $32 million dollar contract in July 2009; traded for Courtney Lee in August 2010; re-signed Ariza to a four-year $32 million dollar contract in June 2014\n\nThe 2009 and 2013 Ariza put up similar numbers, including nearly identical points, minutes, fouls, steals and three-point shot attempts per game.\n\nMorey resigned Ariza nearly four years to the day since trading him in 2010 (which was almost one year to the day since signing him as an Unrestricted Free Agent in 2009). Ariza was traded for Courtney Lee, who was traded two years later to the day in 2012 for a Celtics salary dump (three players) plus ’13 second-round pick (eventually included in Harden trade; Abrines) and Jon Diebler, who is currently out of the NBA.\n\n“I’m mostly focused on winning championships, but I’m pretty passionate about teaching. Everything would be better if people would understand how data could help decision-making.” — Daryl Morey, April 2013\n\nCOURTNEY LEE\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 22, 2008; Orlando Magic)\n\nAugust 11, 2010: Traded by the New Jersey Nets to the Rockets; the Rockets traded Trevor Ariza to the New Orleans Hornets; the Indiana Pacers traded Troy Murphy to the Nets; and the Hornets traded Darren Collison and James Posey to the Pacers.\n\nJuly 20, 2012: Traded by the Rockets to the Boston Celtics; the Celtics traded JaJuan Johnson, E’Twaun Moore, Sean Williams and a 2013 second-round draft pick (Àlex Abrines was later selected) to the Rockets; the Celtics traded Sasha Pavlović to the Portland Trail Blazers; and the Trail Blazers traded Jon Diebler to the Rockets.\n\n“To get something you like, you’ve got to give up something. It wasn’t a situation where we were down on Trevor. It was really about that we think Courtney has a big future. We really target players who we think will fit in well here over time. When we got our first chance to acquire Lee, we were fairly aggressive to get that done. He’s very versatile.” — Daryl Morey, August 2010\n\nRecap:\n\nHouston signs Ariza in 2009\n\nTraded Ariza for Lee in 2010\n\nTraded Lee to Boston for salary relief in 2012\n\nGORAN DRAGIĆ\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 45, 2008; San Antonio Spurs)\n\nFebruary 24, 2011: Rockets traded Aaron Brooks to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a 2011 first-round draft pick (Nikola Mirotić was later selected)\n\nJuly 19, 2012: Signed as a Free Agent with the Phoenix Suns (four years / $30 million — player option on final year)\n\n2013-2014: Most Improved Player Award\n\nRecap:\n\nDrafted Joey Dorsey / Dontè Greene ahead of Dragić in 2008\n\nTraded Brooks for Dragić and Mirotić → Motiejūnas in 2011\n\nSigned Lin (three years / $25.1 million) over Dragić (four years / $30 million) in July 2012\n\n“We’re both capable starters, we both want it. It’s going to have to be a situation where they make a decision on one of us. It has nothing to do with Goran. I’m not happy with the way (the) coaches handled things. If management wants to do something to keep Goran, I think I’ll have to be moved.” — Kyle Lowry, May 2012\n\nJuly 11, 2012: Traded Kyle Lowry to the Toronto Raptors for Gary Forbes and a 2013 first-round draft pick (Steven Adams was later selected)\n\n“The guaranteed lottery pick we received from Toronto for Lowry is more valuable in acquiring an All-Star level player. Dragić wanted a player option (that Phoenix gave him) which greatly harms a player’s value and will almost always lead us away from No. 2. A player option essentially guarantees that a team ends up with either a Free Agent (not valuable) or a player who the League thinks is not valuable and blocks your salary cap flexibility.” — Daryl Morey, September 2012\n\nThe Dragić dealings have been similar to Lin, not only due to their parallel careers timeline-wise but as they have crossed paths several times under Morey. Morey chose Lin and other players over Dragić in ‘12, allowing him to sign with the Suns with zero in return.\n\nWhile passing over Dragić in the ‘08 Draft, the Brooks trade was well-done by Morey. Motiejūnas has currently not yet received enough playing time for his development nor satisfaction, while Lin would be traded in 2014.\n\nUnlike the contract he eventually extended to Dwight Howard, Morey evaluated Dragić as unworthy of the requested player option, and yet Dragić both received and rewarded Phoenix’s decision to include said option in their offer to Dragić. Harden and Dragić both put up similarly impressive numbers through the 2012 — 2014 seasons, with both players in the top-five and top-ten of most offensive categories for Shooting Guards.\n\n“He plays the game extremely well when he’s on the court and he does a lot of things. He can affect the game in many ways. He’s an exciting player, he’s a talented player and it’s just exciting to see a good person get an opportunity to succeed and he has … Bottom line is he’s a great player and we’re seeing that now.” — Steve Nash, April 2012\n\nBRENT BARRY\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 15, 1995; Denver Nuggets)\n\nJuly 1, 2008: Opted out of contract with the San Antonio Spurs and became a Free Agent\n\nJuly 10, 2008: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston (two years)\n\nOctober 23, 2009: Career ended when he was cut by the Rockets at the end of training camp. He appeared in fifty-six games in the ‘08 — ‘09 season, starting one.\n\n“We are offering the maximum allowed on a two-year contract. We are in full pursuit. We want to give him the full treatment. We think Brent can be a key piece in our playoff run if we can get him. We think he can help us in a significant way.” — Daryl Morey; February, 2008\n\nOMRI CASSPI\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 23, 2009; Sacramento Kings)\n\nAugust 14, 2008: Houston traded Donté Greene, Bobby Jackson and a 2009 first-round draft pick (Omri Casspi was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings for Metta World Peace, Patrick Ewing, Jr. and Sean Singletary\n\nJuly 16, 2013: Houston signed Omri Casspi as a Free Agent (two years / $2.6 million — team option for second year)\n\nJune 25, 2014: Houston traded Ömer Aşik, Omri Casspi and cash to the New Orleans Pelicans for a 2015 first-round draft (protected 1-55), Alonzo Gee and Scotty Hopson\n\n“I think Omri is finally getting a chance to show how good he can be. Unless you are one of the very top players in the league, the NBA is mostly about skills matching roles. I don’t think Omri has had a good role fit yet and I think his skills are significant. We shall see.” — Daryl Morey, August 2013\n\nSERGEI LISHOUK\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 49, 2004; Memphis Grizzlies)\n\nFebruary 21, 2008: Houston traded Mike James and Bonzi Wells to the New Orleans Hornets; the Rockets traded Malick Badiane to the Memphis Grizzlies; the Grizzlies traded Sergei Lishouk to the Rockets; the Hornets traded Bobby Jackson, Adam Haluska and a 2008 second-round draft pick (Maarty Leunen was later selected) to the Rockets; and the Hornets traded Marcus Vinicius to the Grizzlies\n\nDecember 15, 2010: Rockets traded a future first-round draft pick to the New Jersey Nets (Shane Larkin, ‘13); the Rockets traded Sergei Lishouk to the Los Angeles Lakers; the Lakers traded Sasha Vujacić and a 2011 first-round draft pick (JaJuan Johnson was later selected) to the Nets; the Nets traded Terrence Williams to the Rockets; and the Nets traded Joe Smith, a 2011 second-round draft pick (Darius Morris was later selected) and a 2012 second-round draft pick (Robert Sacre was later selected) to the Lakers\n\nJuly 13, 2014: Traded to Houston in exchange for Jeremy Lin, 2015 first-round pick and 2015 second-round pick (51-55 only)\n\nLishouk has yet to play in the NBA, and has been acquired by Morey twice thus far, mostly due to numbers/contract-matching.\n\nMETTA WORLD PEACE\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 16, 1999; Chicago Bulls)\n\nAugust 14, 2008: Houston traded Donté Greene, Bobby Jackson and a 2009 first-round draft pick (Omri Casspi was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings for Metta World Peace, Patrick Ewing, Jr. and Sean Singletary.\n\nJuly 08, 2009: Signed as a Free Agent with the Los Angeles Lakers (five years / $32 million)\n\n2010: Key member of the Lakers Championship\n\nFebruary 2014: Out of NBA\n\nWorld Peace was acquired in the last year of his contract as part of a salary dump. Drafting Greene was a mistake; Jackson was traded in part of a salary dump, and the draft pick was thrown in for little-to-no-reason. Singletary and Ewing, Jr. were both thrown in for salary-matching purposes; both were traded within the month, both for additional salary relief.\n\nMorey again gave up a future draft pick (representing a player he would eventually sign himself in Casspi) and a player mistakenly drafted by Morey for the opportunity to have World Peace and his expiring contract play a single season with the Rockets. The salary relief gained from this very transaction was welcomed, yet the price paid (and subsequent Lakers championship) was unquestionably high.\n\nJERMAINE TAYLOR\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 32, 2009; Washington Wizards)\n\nJune 25, 2009: Draft rights purchased by Rockets for $2.5 million dollars\n\nDecember 15, 2010: Traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for a protected second-round pick (never materialized)\n\nTraded by Houston to make room for Terrence Williams\n\nNovember 2012: Out of NBA\n\nTaylor never materialized for the Rockets, nor did the pick traded in exchange for Taylor.\n\n“Daryl Morey announced today that the team has signed rookie guard Jermaine Taylor to a multi-year contract. The Houston Chronicle reports that the deal is worth $3.33 million over four years, with the first two years guaranteed and a team option on the third and fourth seasons.” — Inside Hoops, August 2009\n\n“I really hope the Rockets lets me know something soon… Beyond frustrated … feels like I’m being lied to” — Jermaine Taylor, November 2010\n\nTERRENCE WILLIAMS\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 11, 2009; New Jersey Nets)\n\nDecember 15, 2010: Traded to Houston in exchange for a lottery protected 2012 first-round pick, which was part of a deal involving the Rockets, New Jersey Nets and Los Angeles Lakers. As part of the three-team trade, the Rockets also sent the Lakers the draft rights to Sergei Lishouk\n\nPick turned into Shane Larkin in ‘13; Lishouk rights acquired in ‘14 Lin deal\n\nMarch 16, 2012: Waived by the Rockets\n\nNovember 2012: Out of NBA\n\nFebruary 2013 — June 2013: Member of the Boston Celtics\n\nOctober 2013: Out of NBA\n\nBrooklyn didn’t give up on him without a reason. Williams was suspended for two games and he was sent down to the D-League as punishment for conduct detrimental to the team.\n\n“We really like his talent. We think he has the ability to really play at a high-level, could play at an All-Star level. He fits big time into our plans I think over time.” — Daryl Morey, February 2011\n\nThe expensive rights for Jermaine Taylor only to trade him for nothing but to make room for Terrence Williams, acquired via Morey trading a first-round pick.\n\n“My worst trade: Terrence Williams for this year’s 1st.” — Daryl Morey, April 2013\n\nISH SMITH\n\n(Undrafted; 2010)\n\nAugust 23, 2010: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston (two years)\n\nFebruary 24, 2011: Traded by the Rockets with Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies for DeMarre Carroll, Hasheem Thabeet and a future future-round draft pick\n\nJuly 19, 2014: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston (one year)\n\nThe announcement of Smith’s return accompanied the re-signing Joey Dorsey and Jeff Adrien in 2014, two former Rockets’ players.\n\n“There’s no question he’s an NBA player.” — Daryl Morey, January 2011\n\nJEREMY LIN\n\n(Undrafted; 2010)\n\nDecember 12, 2011: Signed with Houston as a Free Agent\n\nDecember 24, 2011: Houston releases Lin for roster availability\n\nDecember 24, 2011: Houston signed Samuel Dalembert as a Free Agent\n\nJune 27, 2012: Traded Dalembert, cash, a 2012 first-round draft pick (John Henson was later selected) and a future second-round draft pick to the Milwaukee Bucks for Jon Brockman, Jon Leuer, Shaun Livingston and a 2012 first-round draft pick (Jeremy Lamb was later selected)\n\nJuly 17, 2012: Houston signed Lin as a restricted Free Agent (three years / $25.1 million)\n\nJuly 07, 2014: Traded Lin to the Los Angeles Lakers with 2015 first-round pick and 2015 second-round pick (51-55 only) for Sergei Lishouk\n\n“We were comfortable with the money we were going to give Jeremy, and we hoped they (Knicks) wouldn’t match. I think if you combined his underrated athleticism with his work ethic and intelligence, you have a player that we’d bet on every time.” — Daryl Morey, July 2012\n\nThe dealings of Morey with Lin thus far have been inexplicable. Regarding the evaluation of talent:\n\nRecap:\n\nLin went undrafted in July 2010; signed and released within two weeks for salary room in December 2011; re-signed to a three-year, $25.1 million dollar contract in July 2012; then traded with a future first-round draft pick and a 2015 second-round draft pick (acquired by Houston in an earlier deal with the Clippers) in exchange for the rights to Lishouk to the Lakers.\n\nAnd salary cap room. Of course salary cap room. Especially when no real players are coming back. In this instance, the salary cap relief came directly from trading a player worthy of a $25 million dollar deal two years ago, prior to being released a year before that, and prior to being undrafted a year before that.\n\nLin and two potential future draft picks for the rights to Lishouk, a player Morey has already signed and traded, and who’s still yet to play a minute of NBA basketball.\n\n“I like the spotlight. It’s important. We’re probably going to be on national TV more because of Jeremy and good players want to be on TV.” — Leslie Alexander, July 2012\n\n“We’re basically the de-facto national team of China. People throughout Asia love our team. That started with Yao, and it continued with the great players that we’ve had. Every one of our games is broadcast in China and throughout Asia. We deliver a reach that is greater than any other team in the NBA, on a global scale.” — Rockets CEO Tad Brown, June 2014\n\nThe strategy behind signing a player to a back-loaded, three-year deal would be to attempt to trade the player in the final year if necessary, without committing a majority of their overall salary to said player in the first and second year.\n\nWhy are players being given three-year contracts with sights set on trading them? Why did Morey try to partially justify losing Chandler Parsons by stating the Mavericks’ contract offer was “literally one of the most untradeable structures that I’ve ever seen.”? Morey knows better than most no contract is untradeable, especially after signing Lin and Aşık away from their respective former teams. Nor should a player of Parsons’ heightened improvement and value to any franchise be looked at as a two-year rental. One-year or two-year rentals do not make a team.\n\n“He’s the fifth-best pick-and-roll player in the League and ninth pick-and-roll in the game … and one of the top players in blocked shots and steals. Overall, he had an extremely good year and we’re no where near the playoffs without Jeremy Lin.” — Daryl Morey, May 2013\n\nJEFF ADRIEN\n\n(Undrafted; 2009)\n\nDecember 20, 2011: Signed with Houston as a Free Agent\n\nFebruary 07, 2012: Waived by Houston\n\nJuly 15, 2014: Signed with Houston as a Free Agent (one year)\n\n“We’re focused on the playoffs. We’re focused on making sure we don’t have an exit in the first round like we did last year. I feel strongly we’ll be stronger going into the playoffs this year than last year.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nCHANDLER PARSONS\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 38, 2011; Houston Rockets)\n\nAugust 6, 2008: The Rockets acquired the option to swap 2011 second-round draft picks from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Novak. The option to swap 2011 second-round draft picks was exercised.\n\nJune 23, 2011: Houston selected Marcus Morris (first round, 14th pick), Nikola Mirotić (first round, 23rd pick) and Chandler Parsons (second round, 38th pick) in the 2011 NBA Draft\n\nJune 23, 2011: Houston traded Brad Miller, Nikola Mirotić, Chandler Parsons and a 2013 first-round draft pick (Andre Roberson was later selected) to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jonny Flynn, Donatas Motiejūnas and a 2012 second-round draft pick (Will Barton was later selected)\n\nJune 23, 2011: Houston traded cash to the Timberwolves for Parsons\n\nJuly 10, 2014: Parsons’ signed with Dallas Mavericks (three years / $46 million)\n\nDiscussed earlier, the loss of Parsons is incomprehensible. The argument is not whether Morey should have matched Parsons’ overpayment of a contract offer from the Dallas Mavericks; Morey nor Parsons should have never been there in the first place. Parsons is as real of a steal of a second-round draft player as they come; one Morey deftly obtained in a trade and paid real money for to develop and devote to real playing time.\n\nMorey had the opportunity of signing Parsons’ option for one more year of service, thus keeping one of the most sought-out Free Agents of 2014 for either one more year of service or for a future trade chip.\n\nWhen a franchise allows an Unrestricted Free Agent to test the market, the market is not an equal playing ground for all thirty franchises. It never is, anyways. A player’s value on the market is not the same as his value to any one team. What this does is create a handicapped value on the franchise holding the player’s rights.\n\nInstead of developing a franchise’s own value and applying it to negotiating, any other franchise can make an offer the owning General Manager is then either forced to match, or lose the player for literally nothing. Restricted Free Agency is a different endeavor: where players can really test the market, although the owning team can still offer the maximum salary as an added benefit to negotiating — something players have shown a penchant for having difficulty turning down. A $30 million dollar difference is huge, especially when the owning team is already being run properly, with financial obligations spread around for a sustainable, successful franchise.\n\n“With Chandler, we have an interesting decision. At the end of this year, we can turn down his option. People wonder why, because it’s so cheap, but then he’d be a restricted Free Agent. Or he can go through his fourth year and be an unrestricted Free Agent. There are advantages to each, so it’s something we’ll continue to talk about. He’s going to make a lot of money on his next contract. We don’t know how much. But we’re committed to keeping him.” — Daryl Morey, January 2014\n\nParsons hitting the market during Unrestricted Free Agency and getting paid in Dallas was as simple as a Mark Cuban making an offer Daryl Morey would be in a very difficult position to financially match.\n\nOr would he?\n\nMorey stating Parsons could not be the third-best player on the Rockets going forward was misleading, when the same interview Morey revealed had Chris Bosh or Carmelo Anthony signed with Houston in the off-season, the price of Parsons doesn’t matter, because Houston would then have a top-three team going forward. Although financially doubtful, Parsons could have conceivably re-signed in the 2014 — 2015 off-season.\n\nMorey also stated Parsons could be a third-best player on a number of other teams. These are two additional reasons Morey had to option Parsons in for 2015 — 2016, joining the list:\n\nThe price was $964,750\n\nHe was the Rockets’ third-best player and largely contributed to their best record in six years\n\nHuge trade potential going into 2015 — 2016 season (pending Parson’s approval)\n\nHuge re-signing potential going into 2015 — 2016\n\nAbility to offer maximum contract\n\nKey component within winning organization\n\nAttractive to Free Agents in 2015 — 2016 off-season looking to sign with Houston, at which point Parsons would have been “without a price tag”\n\nHad Morey re-upped Parsons at the low price with no expectations to offer a maximum deal in one year, the Rockets could have built on the successes achieved in the previous season, especially factoring the losses of Lin and Ömer Aşik. Any potential Free Agent in the 2015 — 2016 off-season would be more likely to sign with a winning Rockets organization, and Parsons could then be re-signed at the maximum due to the advantages Houston would then have in negotiating.\n\n2013 — 2014 salary: $926,500\n\n2012 — 2013 stats: 15.5 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.0 SPG, 0.4 BPG\n\n“Parsons was so under the radar, he isn’t even on a standard rookie contract. He instead has the structured deal given to late second-round picks, wherein he’s on a year-to-year deal with team options every off-season and no free agency until 2015-16. We’re going to say Houston likes that deal.” — Angel Diaz, October 2013\n\nA winning organization with three star players where Parsons is the fourth option and still getting maximum money? That may be audacious, but also what Morey was suggesting. It would be feasible, considering Parsons as a legitimate fourth option on any team is probably built to currently contend.\n\nResigning Parsons to the one-year deal would have given Morey every option possible. Instead he saw his best draft pick to date, a player he unknowingly traded Steve Novak for, a player he successfully used as part of a trade and then immediately purchased back, a player who has improved every year, sign directly with the competition.\n\n“Second-rounders are guaranteed $0 of NBA contract money, and a decent chunk of them, even the ones plucked from U.S. colleges, never earn anything substantive in the NBA. Some get cut after training camp and bounce between 10-day contracts, D-League stints, and international adventures until they give up. Even those who sign multi-year NBA deals often agree to contracts that are completely non-guaranteed in every season, so that teams can waive them anytime without any cost.” — Zach Lowe, July 2014\n\nParsons improved in most offensive categories each year in the League, held a strong locker room presence on a young team, and became an lucrative marketing asset. He was also instrumental in recruiting Dwight Howard, the Free Agent coveted by Morey perhaps more than any other player to date.\n\nMay 2013: Parsons hires agent Dan Fegan and Relativity Sports. Fegan is a representative of Howard, and Relativity represent Omri Casspi, Robert Covington and Alonzo Gee amongst others.\n\n“Sources say Chandler was relentless. He called and texted Dwight every day, even Face-Timed and would answer every question Dwight could potentially have. We would drive to his house in the hills and talk to him. Basically Chandler Parsons recruited him like Nick Saban and a five-star defensive tackle; they hardly knew each other at beginning of process.” — Darren Heitner, July 2013\n\nCHUCK HAYES\n\n(Undrafted; 2005)\n\nOctober 05, 2005: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston\n\nOctober 25, 2005: Waived by Houston\n\nJanuary 18, 2006: Signed a ten-day contract with Houston, then signed a contract for the rest of the season.\n\nJuly 31, 2007: Signed with Houston (four years / $8 million)\n\n2009: Named Co-Captain with Battier for the 2009 — 2010 season\n\nDecember 24, 2011: Signed as a Free Agent with the Sacramento Kings (four years / $22.4 million)\n\nWith the Rockets in flux after their trade for Pau Gasol was vetoed, limiting their cap room, center Chuck Hayes could no longer wait for an offer and signed with the Sacramento Kings.\n\n“I was telling Daryl, going into the season ninety percent of the people on the team felt like a trade asset. Having everybody looking over their shoulder, that’s not going to get you anywhere. Hopefully, next year is a little different at the beginning, we get off to the right start and play like we did after the All-Star break.” — Kevin Martin, April 2011\n\n2011 CHRIS PAUL VETOED TRADE\n\nDecember 8, 2011: the day before the 2011 NBA lockout ended and players could move between teams, the Rockets, the Lakers and the Hornets agreed to a trade that would have sent Scola, along with Dragić, Martin, and Lamar Odom to the Hornets. In exchange, the Rockets would have received Pau Gasol, and the Lakers would have received Chris Paul. The trade was quickly vetoed by then Commissioner David Stern.\n\n“In the case of the trade proposal that was made to the Hornets for Chris Paul, we decided, free from the influence of other NBA owners, that the team was better served with Chris in a Hornets uniform than by the outcome of the terms of that trade.” — David Stern, December 2011\n\nThe pending sale of the Hornets’ franchise plus the potential pairing of Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul were the true reasons behind the vetoing, although the distribution of talent subsequent to this deal’s allowance was one-sided at best.\n\nThis appeared to be a terrible deal for the Rockets, and a great deal for both the Western Conference Hornets and Lakers. Morey is probably potentially lucky this deal was vetoed.\n\n“What you’re on is our general strategy which is to try and take hopefully smart, fairly significant gambles. Not once, not twice, but as many times as possible.” — Daryl Morey, November 2012\n\nÖMER ASIK\n\n(Drafted 2nd Round @ 36; 2008; Chicago Bulls)\n\nJuly 24, 2012: Houston signed Aşik as a restricted Free Agent (three years / $25.1 million)\n\nJune 25, 2014: Traded Aşik, Omri Casspi and cash in a three-team trade with Pelicans and Wizards for Trevor Ariza, Alonzo Gee, Scotty Hopson, 2015 first-round pick (from Pelicans) (protected top-three and 20-30 in 2015 — 2018, top three and 25-30 in 2019 — 2020, else 2020 second-round pick and 2021 second-round pick)\n\nRecap of the value on Aşik:\n\nDrafted Joey Dorsey / Dontè Greene ahead of Aşik in 2008\n\nSigned Aşık to a three-year, $25.1 million dollar deal in July 2012\n\nTraded Aşık, Casspi and cash to the New Orleans Pelicans for a protected 2015 first-round draft, Alonzo Gee, Scotty Hopson\n\n“The reality is James (Harden) and Dwight (Howard) want to play with Jeremy and Ömer.” — Daryl Morey, July 2013\n\nAnother salary dump on a deal done in 2012 from a player being evaluated since 2008; traded for two undrafted players and a potential first-round pick. Rumors of an offer involving Lin and Aşik for Rajon Rondo from the Boston Celtics during the 2013 season would now appear as a more promising salary relief option, or third star deliverance, or expiring contract, or anything better than the actual results.\n\nAgain, salary relief comes from most any deal for at least one team involved; certainly almost every transaction when one team receives expiring contracts or zero players in return. That’s a given. What is the value behind the players being traded?\n\n“When we didn’t have Ömer out there last year (on defense) we sucked. We were terrible. I’m just being frank.” — Daryl Morey, July 2013\n\nNot only was Morey able to creatively dissuade both the Knicks and Chicago from matching said offer sheets in 2012, he was able to trade both Lin and Aşik in 2014. These dealings would further muddle Morey’s subsequent claims regarding the Mavericks’ offer to Parsons.\n\n“For lack of a better term, Morey and the Houston front office “artfully exploited” the Arenas Rule. By limiting the Lin and Aşik offer sheets to only three years (as opposed to four-year deals), the Rockets were able to concentrate the balloon payment into Year Three, rather than having some of that ballooning salary spread over multiple seasons.” — David Weiner, July 2012\n\nTROY DANIELS\n\n(Undrafted; 2013)\n\nOctober 18, 2013: Signed with Houston\n\nOctober 26, 2013: Waived by Houston\n\nFebruary 21, 2014: Signed a multi-year deal with Houston but was immediately assigned to the D-League\n\nMarch 03, 2014: Recalled by the Rockets\n\nMarch 05, 2014: Made NBA debut\n\nJuly 14, 2014: Re-signed with the Rockets (two years)\n\nThe Houston Rockets 2013 — 2014 season and playoffs came to an end via a Damian Lillard three-point buzzer-beater over Parsons’ outstretched hand in Game Six.\n\nThe Rockets may not have been in a Game Six position had it not been for the late-game heroics of the undrafted Daniels in Game Three, hitting a three-point game-winner with eleven seconds left.\n\n“Of the shooters that I’ve had either on the Vipers or the Rockets, the two best are Steve Novak and Troy Daniels.” — Daryl Morey, February 2014\n\n“It’s not a linear thing, bottom line — teams that win the title, they find the ‘Chandler Parsons.’ We can’t be the organization that limits flexibility and locks us in and guarantees that we can’t win the title by paying ‘Chandler Parsons.’ We have to be the organization that find those guys, not the organization that pays them.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nThis sentiment would directly contradict the pattern set by Morey; contradicts the dealings with Lin, Aşık, Parsons (the only player to be ‘found’ under Morey) and especially James Harden. Harden himself only started seven games total with Oklahoma City prior to being traded to Houston.\n\nHayes left in Free Agency during the Chris Paul League vetoed-trade disaster. World Peace left in Free Agency. Scola was amnestied. Parsons left in Free Agency. Francis was a disaster. Ariza’s value fluctuation. Lin’s value fluctuation. Dalembert’s value fluctuation independently and in conjunction with Lin. Dragić’s value fluctuation independently and in conjunction with Lin. Aşik’s value fluctuation. The Batum trade. The Royce White draft. The Royce White trade. The Marcus Morris draft. The Marcus Morris trade. The Jermaine Taylor trades. The Terrence Williams trades. The coaching changes. The draft picks. The international failures. The many steps taken to obtain Parsons; develop and watch him improve every year, then exit on his own, leaving Houston with nothing but a new in-state enemy to show for it.\n\nMULTIPLEX TRADES\n\nMorey has transactions stacked within other transactions, moving many men during his time at the top. He has been awarded a reputation as a businessman capable of making “something from nothing.” Often these transactions have taken place due to previous mistakes of overpaid players or overrated talent.\n\nAugust 14, 2008: Traded Donté Greene (one of Morey’s worst signing ever, traded for Draft Night 2008) Bobby Jackson (acquired in a previous salary dumping trade in February 2008) and a 2009 first-round draft pick (Omri Casspi was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings for Metta World Peace (signed with Lakers as Free Agent in July 2009) Patrick Ewing, Jr. (traded for Frédéric Weis 2008 — DNP in NBA) and Sean Singletary (traded for D.J. Strawberry, August 2008 — waived October 2008)\n\nConsider this take from ShamSports.com (June 2009) regarding the Rockets 2009 Draft decisions:\n\n“Silver announces that the Houston Rockets have bought the rights to Jermaine Taylor, the 32nd pick, for cash only. No future picks, just cash. This I think is more emblematic of the economy’s effect on roster moves; the #32 pick is normally a prized asset, where you get to pick the best of the overlooked first round talent without the burden of giving them a guaranteed contract. Picks in the thirties generally carry great value, and certainly did last year. But this year, the Wizards are giving it away without so much as a future pick in return. They get no basketball value from this asset, no players, no picks, no nothing. Just money. And that’s because money’s talking more than ever. It’s a shame, but that’s how it is. So kudos to the tax-adverse Rockets for buying in a seller’s market.\n\n(Quick break from pseudo-real time — we later learn that the amount of cash was $2.5 million. And that’s a shedload of cash. Even more kudos awarded, and it makes far more sense for the Wizards now.)\n\n“Silver announces that Houston bought the rights to Sergio Llull, the 34th pick from Denver, for yet more cash and still without giving up any future picks. I promise you that that is brilliant business. Partway through last season — and prompted in part by my say so…maybe — Houston gave up the 36th pick in this draft to dump Steve Francis onto Memphis, thereby saving themselves from being over the tax threshold. Tonight, they have used the money they saved in that deal to buy the 32nd and 34th picks. Now tell me that that’s not extremely smoothly done. You just can’t do it.\n\nAlso, in the 2007 draft, Houston gave up a future second round pick to Seattle for the rights to Carl Landry, the 31st pick, in one of Sam Presti’s few crap deals so far. The pick wound up being the #56 pick in 2008, which Seattle used to draft Sasha Kaun and promptly sold to Cleveland. So once again, Houston stole a high 30's pick for nothing. These boys are good. Pay attention.\n\nAlso, Houston came into this draft with no picks, and potentially just bought three rotation players for nothing other than one future second. That, ladies and gentleman, is how you approach draft night. Take note, Orlando.”\n\nThe opinion above would seemingly lend credence to this aura. The question remains: why was Morey required to pay for Draft Picks?\n\nNo doubt Morey maneuvered his way into the 2009 Draft. His number-matching was admirable. The talent was mistaken.\n\nThe money saved from the Francis trade became a nice asset, yet the financial recoup would never have been necessary had Francis not been signed and subsequently required to be traded. The astronomical savings were then misspent on Taylor and Lull, both added to the list of overvalued talent. The ‘07 trade for Landry was acceptable yet curious considering the previous Brooks selection and depth of Rockets’ Guard positions at the time.\n\nThe 2009 Draft allowed Morey to display his deft ability to numbers-match. Yet when investigated, almost every transaction within this particular transaction represents a misapplied value as well as overvalued talent.\n\nFURKAN ALDEMIR\n\nJune 28, 2012: Selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fifty-third pick of the 2012 NBA draft\n\nJune 29, 2012: Los Angeles Clippers acquired Lamar Odom from the Dallas Mavericks as part of a four-team trade also involving the Utah Jazz. The Clippers sent Mo Williams to the Jazz and the draft rights to Furkan Aldemir, the Clippers’ second-round selection (53rd overall) in the 2012 Draft to Houston while the Jazz conveyed the draft rights of Tadija Dragićević, Utah’s second-round pick (53rd overall) in the 2008 Draft to Dallas. To complete the trade, Dallas sent the draft rights of Shan Foster, the Mavericks’ second-round selection (51st overall) in the 2008 Draft to the Jazz with Houston sending cash considerations to Dallas.\n\nJuly 13, 2013: Philadelphia 76ers acquired the rights to Furkan Aldemir, Royce White and cash from the Rockets in exchange for a draft consideration\n\nAfter Morey assisted in the facilitation of a four Western Conference team trade and paid cash for Aldemir in 2012, Morey included Aldemir’s rights plus cash a single year later in order to terminate affiliation with Royce White in a trade to Philadelphia in July 2013.\n\nThe draft consideration from Philadelphia never materialized.\n\n“Being an extremely crappy team is definitely a well-worn path to success in the NBA. Each year, the NBA hands the most valuable asset in the game and hands it to the most mismanaged teams. We could go with this approach but we think our approach can succeed as well and can succeed faster even though it is more difficult.” — Daryl Morey, September 2012\n\nCOACHING PHILOSOPHY\n\n“Hopefully, our teams will be better in the playoffs. And that will take us farther along the line. That’s my expectation.” — Leslie Alexander, May 2007\n\n“Our goal for the team is to make the playoffs. My goal is to position ourselves to be a championship contender.” — Daryl Morey, December 2011\n\nCOACH RICK ADELMAN\n\nMay 13, 2007: Rockets relieve Coach Jeff Van Gundy\n\nMay 18, 2007: Rockets hire Coach Rick Adelman\n\nApril 18, 2011: Rockets and Rick Adelman part ways\n\n“We’re not a championship caliber roster right now. We feel like we need change and we need to continue to change until we get to where we want to be. The job I’m given by Les Alexander is not can we be a team that works its way into the playoffs. The job I’m given, and we’re short of, is can we compete with the top teams.” — Daryl Morey, April 2011\n\nSimilar to the handling of Van Gundy in 2007, Adelman and Houston acrimoniously agreed to part ways in 2011. Although Adelman is regarded as a future Hall of Fame coach, his style of basketball never seemed appropriately paired with enigmatic philosophies.\n\nFrom the beginning, Adelman seemed ill-suited to compliment the strategy designed by Morey. Despite the apparent difference in approach, both men achieved moderate success as they worked together.\n\nFebruary 24, 2011: During a playoff race, the Rockets traded Shane Battier to Memphis, their chief competitor for the final playoff spot, while the Grizzlies were weakened by the injury to Rudy Gay. In exchange, Houston received a future first-round draft pick and Hasheem Thabeet. The Grizzlies ended up beating out the Rockets for the final playoff spot and Battier hit the aforementioned big shot to beat the Spurs in Game One of their series.\n\nYet Adelman had no room for Terrence Williams or Hasheem Thabeet. He did not coach from a statistics-based approach.\n\n“He (Thabeet) hasn’t been playing for them (Memphis); I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with him.” — Coach Rick Adelman, February 2011\n\n“Hasheem Thabeet is someone who has the potential to develop into a very significant interior defender, a very significant center over time.” — Daryl Morey, February 2011\n\nUnder Adelman, the Rockets were able to overachieve despite major roster turnover including the departure of McGrady and Ming.\n\nTwenty-two game win streak: ‘07-‘08 (third longest / NBA history)\n\nFirst playoff series win in seventeen years: ‘08-‘09\n\nHighest winning percentage in franchise history (.588)\n\n“I had three experiences before Houston. At two, I had a lot of talent and at one, I didn’t. I won at two places and didn’t win at the other. I figured it out that talent is pretty important, especially if you have a unique blend of a big guy who’s one of the best in the league and a perimeter player who’s one of the best in the league.” — Rick Adelman, April 2011\n\nCOACH KEVIN MCHALE\n\nApril 18, 2011: Rockets and Rick Adelman part ways\n\nMay 27, 2011: Rockets hire Coach Kevin McHale (four years — last year team option)\n\nAfter divorces from two potential Hall of Fame coaches in Van Gundy and Adelman, in June 2011 Hall of Fame player and former Minnesota Timberwolves General Manager and Coach Kevin McHale was hired to take the Rockets to the next level of success yet to be reached under Morey.\n\nMcHale lead the Rockets to consecutive winning seasons and playoff appearances, yet the lack of defense and depth led the Rockets to be ousted in the first round two years in a row.\n\nMcHale carried with him a reputation as a player’s coach; less a tactician, more motivator and brilliant basketball mind. A huge factor in Howard’s decision to sign with Houston, McHale otherwise seemed another curious coaching hire for Morey in terms of compatibility.\n\n“Basketball is basketball, no matter where you are. You know what? It’s a group of guys and we’re all trying to bond together, band together, fight together and learn each other. It’s basketball, it’s something you’ve done your whole life. It’s hard to explain, but once you get in there and you have a team and you’re in there together, it’s us-versus-them.” — Kevin McHale, January 2012\n\nThe separation from Van Gundy took place almost immediately upon Morey taking over as General Manager; hiring Adelman was his choice. Adelman, eighth all-time in coaching wins with a 1042-749 / .582 winning percentage career record in twenty-three seasons as an NBA head coach, and Morey mutually agreed to head in a new direction coaching-wise in 2011. Morey went on to chose McHale out of a mammoth candidate pool.\n\n“Taking the sixth youngest and least experienced team ever to the Playoffs in the tough Western Conference when we were picked by multiple publications to finish last? I would say Coach McHale has done a great job.” — Daryl Morey, April 2013\n\nHARDEN & HOWARD\n\nJAMES HARDEN TRADE & SIGNING\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 3, 2009; Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nOctober 27, 2012: Oklahoma City acquired the twelfth pick in the 2013 Draft (Steven Adams), thirty-second pick in the 2013 Draft (Àlex Abrines), a 2017 top-twenty protected first-round pick (originally from the Dallas Mavericks), Kevin Martin, and Jeremy Lamb from the Rockets in exchange for Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook, and Lazar Hayward\n\nHouston previously acquired Gary Forbes and the 2013 twelfth pick from the Raptors in exchange for Kyle Lowry, and acquired JaJuan Johnson, E’Twaun Moore, Sean Williams and the 2013 thirty-second pick from the Celtics in the Courtney Lee sign-and-trade\n\nOctober 31, 2012: Harden signed a five-year extension with Houston\n\n“James Harden is a player we can build around, and continue to improve the team around his skills. He’s an elite offensive player, a complete player. He can pass, shoot, attack the basket. Even though he’s a gold medalist, an Olympian and made the Finals, I still think he’s an underrated player. He’s absolutely someone who, when they see him step into the role of a star for the Houston Rockets, people are going to realize just how good he is.” — Daryl Morey, October 2012\n\nThe Thunder finished the 2012 — 2013 season with a 60-22 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the eighth-seeded Rockets, now featuring James Harden. In Game Six, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round.\n\n“You probably need two to really be a championship contender. We’re not there yet, but we’ve got multiple young players who can take that step forward.” — Daryl Morey, October 2012\n\nOKC finished the 2013 — 2014 season second in the Conference to San Antonio with a 59-23 record. Their final opponent in the Western Conference Finals were the San Antonio Spurs, with the Spurs winning 4-2.\n\n“We’ve got to add at least one more top-level talent and then fill around that. (Two) is the overwhelming evidence if you look to the history of the NBA as what it takes to win.” — Daryl Morey, November 2012\n\nTwo years removed from the Harden trade, it appears OKC — then and now a better team than Houston — are readily primed for current and future success, while Houston is still building around James Harden.\n\nSince the departure of Harden, the Thunder have experienced no fall-off in production from their team, have remained a top-tier threat in the West and helped Kevin Durant win League MVP in 2014.\n\nWhile Morey has perpetually set himself up to sign or trade for a marquee Free Agent — typically from said player’s original team — he was clearly fortuitous in landing Harden for a number of factors, one being availability.\n\nValuable but ultimately expendable, Oklahoma City General Manager Sam Presti was able to command a respectable haul in return for Harden’s services; a haul which underwhelmed many around the League, given Harden’s potential and age:\n\n“Multiple sources have told me that, when Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti decided to shop James Harden, Golden State was his first call. He wanted Klay Thompson and a pick. The Warriors would only consider the trade if Oklahoma City took back Biedrins or Jefferson for 2013 expirings, knowing they’d get crushed by the luxury tax in 2014 with Harden’s extension plus Steph Curry’s extension plus David Lee plus Bogut / Jefferson / Biedrins. At that point, Presti went to Washington (offering Harden for Bradley Beal, and unbelievably getting turned down), then Houston (where the shopping heated up). Presti never ended up calling Golden State back.” — Bill Simmons, March 2013\n\nPresti and company are certainly not looking back. The Thunder lack a fundamental system as well, yet the talent achieved through intelligent draft selections is complimentary and transcendent.\n\nOklahoma City allegedly offered Harden a four-year extension for $54 million prior to the season, trying to dissuade Harden from becoming a Free Agent the following summer. When Harden turned it down, Presti traded him before the deadline in order to gain some sort of return for his draft pick-turned potential Free Agent.\n\n“Harden obviously, you know I don’t think Oklahoma City makes that trade unless the Collective Bargaining Agreement was making it very tough for them to keep all their stars at the financial level that they were looking for.” — Daryl Morey, November 2012\n\nNotable numbers to emit from the transaction further showed why Harden simply became too expensive for the talented OKC:\n\nDespite not starting a single game all season for only the second time in his career, Martin was mostly able to replicate Harden’s production for a fraction of the price. Oklahoma would finish the season with a better record, even ousting Houston in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Thunder eventually received a trade exception when it orchestrated a sign-and-trade which sent Kevin Martin to the Minnesota Timberwolves in July 2013. Oklahoma City had an opportunity to acquire up to $6.6 million in salary via trade without needing to send back that amount, although they allowed this opportunity to expire.\n\nHARDEN CONTRACT\n\nContract: five years / $78.78 million\n\nAnnual average salary: $15,756,438\n\nGuaranteed: $78,782,188\n\nSigned Using: Bird Rights\n\nFree Agent: 2018 / Unrestricted\n\n“Harden for sure is a player who can be the best player on a championship team. We are building around him. Parsons, Aşik, and Lin also fit comfortably on a championship roster. That said, we do need to have one of them or someone else on the roster to take another big step forward in play to be a championship contender. If not, we will have to acquire another All-Star caliber player through Free Agency (more likely) or trade.” — Daryl Morey, April 2013\n\nDWIGHT HOWARD SIGNING\n\n(Drafted 1st Round @ 1, 2004; Orlando Magic)\n\n2011 — 2012: Demanded trade from Orlando\n\nMarch 25, 2012: On Deadline Day, Howard signed an amendment to his contract waiving his right to opt out at the end of the season; committed to stay with Orlando through the 2012 — 2013 season.\n\nApril 19, 2012: Howard would undergo surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back, and miss the rest of the 2011 — 2012 season as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nAugust 10, 2012: The Magic traded Howard, Earl Clark and Chris Duhon to the Los Angeles Lakers; Denver Nuggets traded Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, a 2013 second-round draft pick (Romero Osby was later selected) and a 2014 first-round draft pick to the Magic; the Lakers traded Christian Eyenga, Josh McRoberts and a 2017 first-round draft pick to the Magic; the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Magic traded Jason Richardson to the 76ers; the 76ers traded Andre Iguodala to the Nuggets; and the 76ers traded Maurice Harkless, Nikola Vučević and a future first-round draft pick to the Magic. Denver will send the lower of its two 2014 first-round draft picks to Orlando.\n\nJuly 2013: NBA fined the Rockets $150,000 for talking about Howard during the Free-Agency moratorium period\n\nJuly 13, 2013: Signed as a Free Agent with Houston (four years / $87.59 million)\n\nHOWARD CONTRACT\n\nContract: four years / $87.6 million\n\nAverage Salary: $21,897,818\n\nGuaranteed: $87,591,270\n\nSigned Using: Cap Space\n\n2016 Player Option\n\n15% Trade Kicker\n\n“Dwight choosing here sort of represents the sea change in Houston, sort of proving that we’re a Tier One destination for Free Agents. And obviously, we’re going out there again and saying let’s get one of these top guys again…I’d say the reasons he chose Houston are going to stay going forward.” — Daryl Morey, June 2014\n\n2013 — 2014 SEASON / OFF-SEASON\n\nAfter finishing with a winning record yet missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, the acquisitions of Harden in ‘12 and Howard in ‘13 were exactly the bold-stroke moves necessary to take a team with a dreadful drafting record and previously-questionable Free Agency agenda to grander competitive distances in the Western Conference.\n\nThe 2013 — 2014 Rockets were the best incarnation of a team strictly assembled by Morey during his regime. The previous six seasons were inherited contracts being traded for favorable ledgers and maximum flexibility.\n\nThe 2013 — 2014 Rockets (54-28) won one game less than the 2007 — 2008 Rockets (55-27); both lost 4-2 in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\n“No General Manager has been more active ahead of the trade deadline in the last six years than Morey, who has made a total of nine deadline trades during his tenure, involving thirty-nine players and ten draft picks.” — Sean Deveney, January 2014\n\nThe landscape of several future NBA seasons hung in the balance of the 2014 Finals, when San Antonio challenged the two-time defending Champion Miami Heat.\n\nRegardless of the brevity placed upon Lebron James and his cramping body, the Heat would lose Game One, and eventually the Series by a four-one count.\n\nAfter the Finals loss, James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh all opted out of their respective contracts with Miami, creating three premier Free Agents. A very unpredictable situation, given the potential had the Finals results been different.\n\n“People around the league say, ‘I want to play with that guy (Harden)’. The way Ömer is playing and passing the ball, people want to be with him. Jeremy. Really putting together a young core that will make others say, ‘I want to play there.’”— Daryl Morey, October 2012\n\nWithout foresight of the defending Champions eventually being dethroned, broken up and re-assembled, Morey exhibited his ability to adapt on the fly, and quickly acted on ridding Houston of several contracts signed by him less than two years prior. With the dealings of Lin and Aşik, and receiving nothing upon Parsons’ departure, Morey found himself in the possibly-envious position of having the financial flexibility to make an offer to three of the most-coveted Free Agents in history: Lebron James, Chris Bosh and Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“It takes three, at least, three elite players with very little exception, throughout history, it takes three elite players and a good set of players that fit around them.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nLEBRON JAMES\n\nRich Paul, agent for Lebron James, was agreeable to take a meeting with Houston on behalf of James. Whatever transpired in said meeting was not enough to bring James himself in for a second interview; James would go on to rejoin the Cleveland Cavaliers in July 2014 (two years, $42.2 million).\n\nPerhaps less likely than Bosh or Anthony, Morey was in a position to offer a maximum contract to Lebron James. The result desirable but the process questionable.\n\nCHRIS BOSH\n\nAlthough he would have been the best fit schematically for the Rockets, Bosh was actually considered the consolation player to Carmelo Anthony.\n\nHenry Thomas, the agent for Bosh (and Dwayne Wade), expertly pressured the Miami Heat to extend a maximum offer to Bosh by leveraging Houston’s interest against Miami’s lack of star power, due to Lebron choosing Cleveland.\n\nHouston courted Bosh and seemed to count on his arrival prior to actually gaining a signature from him. Once Thomas spread word of Houston’s maximum offer (four years, $88 million), Miami was forced to either offer a maximum contract to Bosh or watch him walk away with zero to show for his years of services. After watching James re-join his hometown team, Miami made Bosh a maximum offer (five years, $118 million) he simply could not turn down.\n\nFrom 2010 — 2014, Bosh spent four consecutive seasons as the number-three option on a team which made four consecutive Finals appearances as the Eastern Conference representation, winning two Championships in said appearances. Morey’s gamble was ill-informed at best.\n\nWhy did Morey think Bosh would depart Miami to sign with Houston? This would require him to:\n\nRelocate his family\n\nSign with a Western Conference team which hasn’t won their own Division since the 1993 — 1994 season\n\nRemain the third-option\n\nEarn $30 million dollars less than the Heat could offer\n\nFor Morey to think Bosh and his syndicate were doing anything other than forcing Pat Riley’s hand was presumptuous and benighted.\n\n“Chris was definitely coming if Miami, at the last minute, didn’t put all five years and that huge offer that we obviously couldn’t match because of the rules.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nUntil Miami decided against offering Bosh a maximum deal, Houston would remain Plan B for Bosh, while he remained Plan A or Plan A-1 for Houston. Terrible gamble given the stakes and knowledge.\n\nIf James had re-signed with Miami, Bosh was expected to re-sign, as well. If James departed (as he eventually did), Bosh was expected to re-sign with Miami anyway; this time as a maximum-contract player. A risk nowhere near worth taking for Morey, not due to the skill of the desired player, due to the reality of the situation.\n\nThe 2013 — 2014 Rockets perhaps underachieved, but were certainly competitive: second in their division while going six games deep in the first round of the playoffs. Morey designated several players as expendable due to the potential reward, but the reward was a ghost made of smoke.\n\n“Once you have Bosh, paying Chandler anything is fine. You can pay him $100 million dollars, it’d be fine.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nCARMELO ANTHONY\n\nThe Houston front-office team would continue treating Lin as scrap metal, affixing Lin’s jersey number to a mock-up of Anthony in a Rockets uniform, signaling a desire to recruit Anthony as well as wave the white flag regarding Lin’s occupancy with Houston.\n\nWhile schematically less appealing than Bosh, the courtship of Anthony included nearly identical red flags as Bosh. Anthony, a career first-option, would have to leave New York City (his birth place and desired trade location from the Denver Nuggets in 2011), join a Western Conference team as the third option for $30 million less dollars than Phil Jackson and the rebuilding Knicks could offer.\n\nTo little surprise, Anthony ultimately chose to re-sign with the Knicks, with Houston outwardly never amongst Anthony’s considerations.:\n\n“I was flip-flopping. It was hard. It was Chicago, but then after I met with L.A., it was L.A. But it came back to Chicago — and was pretty much always Chicago or New York. That’s a situation where I could have walked in now to an opportunity to compete for the next however many years.” — Carmelo Anthony, July 2014\n\nNote of interest was Morey’s alleged ambition to keep Parsons if Anthony did select Houston as his destination.\n\n“We’re trying to make an NBA champion and it’s very clear what that takes. It’s very clear what that takes. If you look through history, it takes at least three elite players with very few exceptions. That’s what we’re focused on putting together.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nAfter the dust of the 2014 off-season settled, the Rockets did not seem worried:\n\n“It won’t affect us at all. We have myself and James. We have the best center and the best two guard in the game on the same team. It’s on us.” — Dwight Howard, July 2014\n\n“Dwight and I are the cornerstones of the Rockets. The rest of the guys are role players or pieces that complete our team. We’ve lost some pieces and added some pieces. I think we’ll be fine next season.” — James Harden, July 2014\n\n“I like Chandler. He’s a big part of what we did and what we do. We got to replace not only Chandler, but Aşık and Jeremy so we have a lot of work to do. We need some experience. We’ll have four or five guys in our rotation that weren’t in it last year, but I guess that’s part of it. I think everybody would want continuity. Continuity helps everything, but you play the hand you’re dealt.” — Kevin McHale, July 2014\n\n“It’s very important to keep Chandler. He started in Houston. He’s one of the core guys. His versatility helps us a lot, but I don’t put the team together. We trust in Daryl. If we don’t get CP, we can roll with what we have.” — Patrick Beverley, July 2014\n\n“People talk about Ömer like we had him all year. Obviously, Ömer is a very, very good player, but we played fine in that stretch we didn’t have him (22-12) or we wouldn’t have won fifty-four games. Jeremy contributed more than Ömer, but guards are a little easier to replace.” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nPerhaps Donatas Motiejūnas, a player who requested to be traded as recently as January 2014, best characterized the strategy of Morey:\n\n“He’s (Parsons) a good player, but would it be logical for management to pay him more than Harden? I think that alone determined they couldn’t keep him. Harden would be the third player on the team and he wouldn’t tolerate it.” — Donatas Motiejūnas, July 2014\n\nWhile these are not the first sentiments to be uttered by a player regarding the loss of a teammate, both Howard and Harden further widened the chasm between Houston and future Free Agents by proclaiming their superiority over their past and present teammates.\n\nMost curious was the quote attributed to Harden: the 2011-2012 Sixth Man of the Year (inexplicably) first became a member of the All-NBA First Team only two years after receiving the opportunity to be a starter and maximum-contract player. Very few players in the League are talented enough to transform from bench player, role player or specialist into a starter, star or a maximum-contract player. Harden is one of the most recent examples of one of those very players with his offensive capabilities.\n\nHarden was unable to start over Thabo Sefolosha in Oklahoma — whether due to schematics, defense, required offense off the bench — yet in both of his first two seasons with Houston, Harden was fifth league-wide in scoring. Parsons’ became and remained a starter only six games into his career. Dallas provided him an opportunity to showcase his impact on the game at the expense of Houston.\n\nThe numerous transactions made to draft Parsons, his yearly individual improvements plus locker room presence led many to believe his ex-teammates could have been more diplomatic, if not silent.\n\n“When we trade a player, we never talk about the ex-player, we talk about the new player.” — Leslie Alexander, May 2007\n\nROCKETS ACCOLADES 2007 — 2014\n\nSeven consecutive winning seasons: 2007 — 2014\n\nFour playoff appearances: ‘07 — ‘08/ ‘08 — ‘09 / ‘12 — ‘13 / ‘13 — ‘14\n\nOne playoff series win: ‘08 — ‘09 vs Portland (first for franchise since ‘97)\n\nZero Most Valuable Player Awards\n\nZero Coach of the Year Awards\n\nZero Defensive Player of the Year Awards\n\nZero Rookie of the Year Awards\n\nZero Sixth Man of the Year Awards\n\nZero Sportsmanship of the Year Awards\n\nOne Most Improved Player Award (Brooks; ‘09 — ‘10)\n\nOne J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award (Mutombo; ‘08 — ‘09)\n\nOne All-NBA First Team selection (Harden; ‘13 — ‘14)\n\nTwo All-NBA Second Team selections (Ming; ‘08 — ‘09 / Howard; ‘13 — ‘14)\n\nThree All-NBA Third Team selections (Ming, McGrady; ‘07 — ‘08 / Harden; ‘12 — ‘13)\n\nOne All-NBA Rookie First Team selection (Scola; ‘07 — ‘08)\n\nTwo All-NBA Rookie Second Team selections (Landry; ‘07 — ‘08 / Parsons; ‘11 — ‘12)\n\nZero All-NBA Defensive First Team selections\n\nFour All-NBA Defensive Second Team selections (Battier; ‘07 — ‘08 / Battier, World Peace; ‘08 — ‘09 / Beverley; ‘13 — ‘14)\n\nZero top-ten PER players from 2007 — 2014\n\nThis list of awards should not be outright dismissed. There is an overall theme of lack of identifiable talent running through Morey’s time with the Rockets. These awards are certainly not necessarily entirely due to Morey’s actions. However, the poor evaluation of talent, subsequent lack of talent and constant transactions have not allowed for talent to blossom in many areas for the Rockets, despite their winning records.\n\nThe truth is: Houston as a franchise has only had fifteen total losing seasons since they joined the NBA for the 1967 — 1968 season. This included seven consecutive losing seasons their first seven years in the League (1967 — 1974), and only three losing seasons since the 1999 — 2000 season (‘99 — ‘00; ‘01 — ‘02; ‘05 — ‘06).\n\nLong has Houston been a winning franchise, Morey took over a team in the middle of three consecutive playoff appearances. Parts were exchanged, deals were made. The way to the top is not by matching contracts and evening ledger sheets.\n\nTwenty-one total Draft picks from 2007 — 2014\n\nSix remain with organization not including Dorsey: Motiejūnas; ‘11 / Jones; ‘12 / Canaan; ‘13 / Capela, Johnson, Gentile; ‘14\n\nThe winning teams unilaterally build through the highest picks in the Draft. These picks are awarded due to the Franchise’ essentially not being competitive enough on their own.\n\n“Generally the way it has always been done is that you know you’re going to have a bad season in there, because you need a high pick to get it done. And frankly, I still think that’s probably your safer way to go. … (But) we just didn’t think we could do it, so we sort of carved out a different way.” — Daryl Morey, October 2013\n\nSometimes the drafted talent is so transcendent, the Franchise will reach near-great heights, such as Allen Iverson with the 76ers or Lebron James with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nSometimes the Franchise will build around their drafted talent, patient and proud, such as Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas or Paul Pierce in Boston.\n\nTalent doesn’t always translate, or stay healthy, or stay around long enough to win a Championship with the team who first believed in them.\n\nRegardless; the winning teams have built around talent awarded to them.\n\nWinning basketball at the highest level is achieved through the meshing of talent. The team with the highest level of talent which also plays the least-selfish offensive and most-disciplined defense will win every time.\n\nThe caveat to basketball is the individual players with the most talent make their teammates better in dozens of ways, some not always shown through statistics.\n\nAfter failing to make any sort of lasting selection throughout the drafting process for which to competitively build on, Morey was able to acquire James Harden through a historically bizarre trade. Able to sign Dwight Howard after his discontented final seasons in Orlando and one season in Los Angeles both failed to entice Howard despite $30 million extra dollars to offer. Howard turning down a maximum-level extension with Orlando/Los Angeles was a rarity compared to general Free Agent practices and history.\n\nSimple bad luck and impossible-to-predict player development affects every sports franchise without preference. Never has a championship been easy, handed over or simply given. At the end of every sports’ season, one team remains. The winning team, along with every other team, started at the same place, on the same date, with the same applicable rules to all.\n\nThe improper evaluation of talent has led to a revolving door of players and contracts. Managing the salary cap is easier than scouting talent. Managing the cap and trading like contracts requires hard numbers to be matched up. Finding a trading partner requires matching said numbers. Any high-level financier, businessman or experienced accountant could manage the salary-swapping and salary-cap portion of the front office’s responsibilities.\n\nA partner is required for every trade whereas a Draft pick offers full control to the drafting franchise. When Morey desired a magnate player in the 2014 off-season, every other franchise was therefore minimally inclined to offer equal value for the assets Morey needed to dispose of in order to clear salary room for said desired player.\n\nHaving a keen eye for talent, some foresight and the designations of a team based on complimentary skill-sets are the abilities of a supreme General Manager.\n\nHouston patterns the 2008 Boston Celtics, a team led by three dedicated veterans, united under extremely fortuitous and advantageous circumstances born from previous works of cunning and strategy. Perhaps the Spurs, one of the other most dominant franchises in NBA history, would better serve as an example for Morey — and the entire League.\n\nA snapshot comparison, the 2013 — 2014 San Antonio Spurs roster contained six Draft picks, not including the undrafted Baynes and de Colo, traded before season’s end.\n\nBeyond the Draft picks on last year’s roster, the salary distribution, system, coaching philosophies, inter/national scouting and Free Agency acquisitions committed to by San Antonio contributed to another Championship for the storied franchise. The Spurs, since 2006 — 2007:\n\nOne Executive of the Year Award: R.C. Buford, ‘14\n\nTwo Coach of the Year Awards: Gregg Popovich, ‘12 / ‘14\n\nOne Sixth Man of the Year Award: Ginóbili, ‘08\n\nTwo Finals MVP Awards: Parker, ‘07 / Leonard ‘14\n\nEight consecutive winning seasons\n\nThree number-one seedings\n\nEight consecutive playoff appearances\n\nThree Finals Appearances: ‘07 / ‘13 / ‘14\n\nTwo Championships: ‘07 / ‘14\n\nFor a more applicable comparison success-wise, the Portland Trail Blazers: a competitive Western Conference team with a history of several Morey transactions, since 2006 — 2007:\n\nTwo Rookie of the Year Awards: Brandon Roy, ‘07 / Damian Lillard, ‘13\n\nThree losing seasons\n\nFour playoff appearances\n\nOne playoff series win: ‘13 — ‘14 vs Houston\n\nSimilar to Houston with Ming and McGrady, injuries ruined the careers of two of Portland’s highest draft picks with Roy in ‘06 and Oden in ‘07 and compromised the future of the franchise.\n\nThere are two major distinctions between the Blazers and the Rockets, however. The Blazers have drafted appropriately since 2006 (Aldridge — via Chicago / Roy — via Minnesota) then 2008 (Batum — via Houston) and 2012 (Lillard — via Brooklyn).\n\nThe biggest difference?\n\nPortland has employed six General Managers since the 2006 — 2007 season.\n\n“We go for it, man. We are just about getting a championship. Sometimes, you swing for it and get the guy like Harden and Howard the last two summers. Sometime, you swing for it and don’t get it. That happens. The key is to stay in the game and focus on just one thing — ‘Will we be more likely to be a championship team this way or that way?’” — Daryl Morey, July 2014\n\nThe quote above speaks to the fundamental flaws behind Morey and his strategies. There is no need to go for it, or swing for the fences. Those are sentiments dealing with luck, timing and gambling. Properly building and sustaining a contending basketball team takes patience and vigilance, cunning talent recognition and a well-designed and fully-supported system, beginning at the very top.\n\nWhenever a franchise trades for a player, the receiving franchise immediately surrenders some form of asset as well as incurs the major financial obligation owed to the player the franchise initially traded for.\n\nTrading for premier players requires the surrendering of assets and cap space. Drafting and developing a maximal player requires time and patience. Neither price tag is avoidable.\n\nThe leader of every NBA franchise must know the game of basketball. More than any other single component of success is the fundamental knowledge and awareness of the actual game. Greater than contracts, greater than financial manipulation, greater than outsmarting fellow General Managers bamboozled into one-sided deals.\n\nWithout talent, the remaining factors become meaningless, or simply not enough.\n\nThe Houston Rockets are currently conventional. Good enough to secure a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive West, yet not advancing nor bottoming-out to obtain a true franchise player. Between the exchanges in coaches and players, no system nor long-term philosophy has been built, and without the talent to either maximize or mask said system, Houston must gingerly continue along the path created.\n\nHarden and Howard are momentary employees. Both players have respective contractual windows; a time-frame Morey must maximize and "
