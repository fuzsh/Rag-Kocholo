        "text": "After much speculation, Facebook finally took the easy way out by changing its name.\n\nThere are two apparent reasons for the move. The first is that we’ll stop talking about Facebook’s evil algorithm, and focus instead on the new name and what it means. The other thought is that renaming the entire company with a fresh coat of brand paint gives Mark Zuckerberg an exit strategy.\n\nAlong with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Steve Jobs, it’s difficult to think of another CEO so closely associated with a company. While this worked for Zuckerberg in the early years when Facebook’s mission was “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”\n\nWell, that hasn’t worked. And now facing whistleblowers, angry staffers, and legislators who seem to be finally figuring out the impact of social media on every level of society, Zuck finds himself increasingly under scrutiny.\n\nBy creating a global brand for all of the company’s assets – including Instagram, WhatsApp, OculusVR, and Facebook, of course – Mark will end up at Meta while some other executive will take the reins of the social media platform that has eaten the world. But now, it is threatening to devour its creator.\n\nWhat exactly does “meta” mean?\n\nIt actually has many meanings in different languages, but as Bloomberg News explains, it means “a virtual-reality platform in which people congregate and communicate in digital environments” to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nApparently, there’s a bit of an obsession with the “metaverse” concept. And the company’s stock symbol will not be META (it turns out it’s taken), but will be MVRS. You have to wonder how much confusion that will cause all those day traders.\n\nDo these name changes work for companies trying to re-brand, modernize, or in Zuckerberg’s case, hope it distracts us?\n\nIf we learned anything from Google essentially making the same move when they came up with an equally weird name in 2017 – Alphabet – most of us simply end up defaulting to the original name. “Google” already was a verb, and we continue to “Google things” with regularity.\n\nWe shouldn’t expect brands to all of a sudden ask us to “like us on Meta.” Facebook will remain the indelible brand that even Mark Zuckerberg can’t sidestep.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the memes and social media jokes to begin – just minutes after the jubilant Zuckerberg delivered the news:\n\nIf you’re wondering what on earth they’ll parody on Saturday Night Live this weekend, wonder no more. Who knows? Maybe Jesse Eisenberg – who played Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network – will return to SNL to reprise his role.\n\nIn the world of business, these name changers usually aren’t game-changers. More often they’re a way of buying a fresh new start – or escaping from imminent danger and legal trouble.\n\nAfter that awful plane crash in the Everglades in ’96, ValuJet took on the name AirTran, a company it had merged with. And just recently, Johnson & Johnson ran into a heap of trouble with the safety of its baby powder, formed a new subsidiary, LTL Management, that will deal with football fields of litigation under this new banner. Meanwhile, J&J will continue to make its products, from vaccines to band-aids to sunscreen.\n\nIn radio, we’re not strangers to strategic name changes because the two biggest companies have done just that in recent years. First, there was Clear Channel’s transition to iHeartMedia (a play off of their iHeartRadio platform) back in 2014. That move effectively allowed the company to leave behind its Mays family roots to forge ahead into the multimedia space.\n\nAnd earlier this year, it was Entercom ditching its traditional radio brand for one that suggests the broader audio landscape – Audacy. As CEO David Field explained, “We have transformed into a fundamentally different and dramatically enhanced organization and so it is time to embrace a new name and brand identity which better reflects who we have become and our vision for the future.”\n\nLike the iHeart brand shift, these moves are designed to communicate, “We’re not just a radio company anymore.”\n\nWhether either rebranding was successful and had the desired effect is in the eye of the beholder – or the stockholders. Or perhaps the people who make business cards, wrap station vans, and the VO talent who cut the new legal IDs.\n\nIn the end, time and perspective are the variables that will lead us to concluding whether these changes helped their companies change minds and hearts.\n\nIn Zuckerberg’s case the Meta move is a calculated risk that like Facebook itself, will be under all sorts of scrutiny – by legislators and by the public-in the coming months and years.\n\nSo, do these brand changes end up having the effect of giving a company a fresh coat of paint – another chance to define itself? Or are they more like tactics that cover up for obvious problems that are hopelessly baked in a brand?\n\nIn the case of Zuckerberg’s leap into the metaverse (or is it metasphere?), it turns out this play has been run before – actually on the basketball court.\n\nThis tweet by writer Sam Koppelman, who had this one sussed out pretty quickly:\n\nRon Artest was a gifted NBA star who had a tendency to find himself in hot water, culminating with that “Malice at the Palace” incident in a game between the Pacers and Pistons back in 2004.\n\nIn an effort to rebrand himself, Artest legally changed his name, not unheard of in pro sports.\n\nBut his choice? Metta World Peace, a new name he proudly sported on the back of his uniform as he moved from the Lakers to the Knicks and then retirement. Equipment managers shortened the uniform name to “World Peace,” dropping the Metta.\n\nMaybe Zuck should have gone with something more aspirational like Artest’s switcheroo. Rename the company “world peace.”\n\nOr “end poverty.”\n\nWe’ll see if Meta becomes a new way brands describe themselves.\n\nEspecially the first new radio station sign-on called Meta.\n\n“Meta Radio” or “Meta 107” has a nice ring to it.\n\nKnowing Facebook, it will not be a high bar to reach."
