        "text": "MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS\n\nVMLY&R has expanded its West Coast footprint with the addition of a new executive lead, Jennifer DaSilva, promoted to executive director, VMLY&R West. DaSilva will oversee the agency’s client engagement, delivery operations, and new business in the Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles offices. In addition, she will continue serving as president at Berlin Cameron. In this new role, she will be based in LA and work alongside Seattle-based Executive Vice President Eric Baumgartner.\n\nDaSilva is a seasoned marketer with 20-plus years of experience working on Fortune 500 brands. As president of WPP creative agency Berlin Cameron, she spent the last 20 years managing key brands such as Coca-Cola, Heineken, Lexus and Capital One.\n\nShe is an influential thought leader who has been published in over 20 leading national media outlets and covered in three published books on her expertise in building community, gender empowerment, leadership, women in the metaverse, mental health, reframing motherhood, and more.\n\nA vocal champion of female empowerment and entrepreneurship, DaSilva launched LLShe, a Berlin Cameron division that works with women-loved and women-led brands. With that same mission in mind, in 2019 she founded Connect4Women, an initiative designed to help women build powerful networks and find job opportunities, which has brought together thousands of women and counting.\n\nVMLY&R’s west coast presence has seen substantial business growth, with 150 new employee hires and double revenue growth since 2019. The agency has welcomed a rapidly expanding client portfolio including technology leading brands like Intel, Microsoft, Meta, and T-Mobile, along with Lululemon, Mazda, and Driscoll’s. Supporting growth, VMLY&R opened its new office at the WPP campus in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, making it its first official hub in the LA market serving 60 employees.\n\nNEW FUNDING/FINANCE\n\nSuman Bannerjee CIO from Hedonova, an alternative assets hedge fund, is raising a strategic series A1 funding round of $18.4 million at a $330 million valuation from Chemie-Tech DMCC, a UAE based engineering and construction company.\n\nWe’re very excited! Last week we closed a funding round of $18.4 at a post money valuation of $330 million led by the UAE firm called Chemie Tech. The round also saw participation from some of our key employees including myself and also from 4 of our clients, to whom we are very grateful. There is no greater gift than having our customers as investors.\n\nThis round is still open. We are in the process of raising another $25 million from two large global conglomerates. We will announce it when the round is closed.\n\nWhy raise from corporates?\n\nWe spent a decade helping European tech startups raising VC funding. Venture capitalists have a 10-year time horizon because that’s the general longitivtiy of the fund. That is not long enough for us. Many of the investments we make and the systems we build will pay off over decades.\n\nVenture capital funds typically make around 50 investments and hope that 2 or 3 of them turn out to be breakouts and provide a 1,000x return. The realigning are expected to fail and fall off their radar. They also find it difficult to raise follow on rounds.\n\nThe US technology space is experiencing a revert back to normal after 2 years of stupendous growth, and many VC funds themselves might find it hard to raise capital. We do not want to be mercy of someone else’s ability to raise capital.\n\nGrowth in great but growth at any cost makes us uncomfortable, especially since we manage money. We would rather be prudent with growth. Because of these, we have decided to raise capital from corporates only with whom we can have more synergies outside just money and who have no intention to sell their investment for a quick return.\n\nREAL ESTATE\n\nShelton Wilder is a Top Luxury Real Estate Agent in Southern California and CEO of the Shelton Wilder Group.
