        "text": "Given my lifelong fascination with basketball abroad, this was a development I couldn’t resist highlighting: Puerto Rican teams are increasingly luring former NBA players there to continue their careers. I checked in with the foremost expert on tracking such things — HoopsHype’s Alberto de Roa — and promptly learned he has a working list of 20 players with NBA experience who have signed to play in Puerto Rico this season. The most recognizable names among them: Earl Clark, Norris Cole, Ed Davis, Tyreke Evans, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Brandon Knight, Greg Monroe, Eric Paschall, Elfrid Payton and Hassan Whiteside.\n\nThe Big 3 draft took place on Monday evening and featured some notable names. In fact, former NBA Champion and Los Angeles Lakers star Metta World Peace was selected 9th overall in the first round and has joined the Trilogy. Metta World Peace in the Big 3 makes too much sense. Another former Laker– Earl Clark– went 2nd overall. Metta was previously a co-captain for the Killer 3s and will be joining a new team in 2021."
