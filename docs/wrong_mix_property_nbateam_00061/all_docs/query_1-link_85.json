        "text": "1. Business Law Part – I By : Prabesh. Shrestha 1/15\n\n2. Law:- The word term law in legal sense can be taken as the purely the product of State or Govt. The State for the purpose of maintaining peace in a country or State, will make the law with the helps of which, it brings the better relations between the people. The better relation between the people, surely help in the mentainence of peace in a country, which is the main factors, which help to develop the country. History:- No laws were there in the early period, where the peoples lives in a groups as a tribes, in a jungle to control the acclivities of men by which might prevails as a rights. Because being mights as a right, poor or weak person had to face the domination of mighty persons. The weaker person could not utilize even their natural rights due to disturbance of their mighty persons and they cannot fill secure about their lives. They are liable to attack at any time at the whime of those mighty persons. Similarly there was no any system of giving punishment to the wrong doer because having no government or even being government who is too weak could not administered the system of punishment to the wrong doer. Hence in such a situation every person was made a sole measure of rights. The person or people use to follow the system of giving the punishment in that time was private vengeance or private revenge and violent self-help. The person who commit the crime or criminal could be punished by his own hands probably supported by the hands of friends and kinsmen. Thus this system creates the conflict between groups and tribes and consequently one group or tribes became the victim for the cause of one man. It create the circumstances where no people could remain in peacefully, and every people in this stage have to carry his life in his own hands In other words only that person who have strong hands or strong, can exist in society otherwise not. But with the growth of the government and its power, gradually try to control the unwanted activities by giving the law of tooth for tooth or eye for eye, no tooth for eye and no eye for tooth on the basis of principles of equality and justice. This principle was based on the thought that unless the equal punishment is given to the criminal the injured or kinsmen of injured person will not satisfied. The unsatisfied system of punishment may create another problem when the chance will be available to the injured party. The governments with this process supply the full-fledged law to the society with its growing power. Therefore considering above it can be said law is as purely the product of State. Nature of Law The term Nature of law even it indicate the characteristic or features of law, Charactortics of law will be little bit inconsistent unless and until it will be clear about the term or meaning of law which will be helpful by the discussion of some of the definitions of law. Definition A. Bedha - Law is the king of the king The law is that rules which have to obey or follow even by the king for the proper administration and to be good king. The law is that rules which he have to follow in the running of his country and even to be the king. Hence it can be said that law is more powerful than the king. The king is to work under the direction of law not as his will. 2/15\n\n3. B. General - Law may be defined as a body of rules and regulation, enforced by the State (with the help of force) Law may be said as a body of rules and regulations provided they are enforced by State. This definition is based in legal scene, and therefore the definition said firstly to be the law it must be of body or groups of rules and regulations which was made by the people to control and to regularize their own conduct or activities. In other words the people made the rules and regulations with the objects of controlling their unwanted activities, which affect the development of society and country. Similarly they are made with the object to regularize their conduct, which is quite helpful for the development of society and county. Therefore the rules and regulation can be said as accepted principles or conduct of people, which is made by themselves for controlling or regularizing their own conduct. The rules and regulation were made with the object of making possible to live the persons in a groups for their own benefit for living peacefully and as well as for the benefit of the country. The rules and regulation even thought they are made for above objects cannot be law in legal scene unless it is enforced by the state. The rules and regulation not enforced by the State only will be accepted principles by people. But that accepted principles to be law first of all, State must recognized it. The recognizition by the State is possible only when State realized it as good rules. Good rules in the scene, that rules will be said as good rules when it help for the development of society, country and will help for maintenance of peace in the country other wise not. Similarly only recognization by the State is not sufficient to be the law. To be the law the main things beside the recoganization is the application of law. The best rules or good rules if not applied by the State cannot be said as law. Hence with the recognization by the State the rules must apply in the country with the help of force without which the application of rules is not possible even the government want to apply. C. Hooker- Any kind of rules or canon whereby action are framed is law Hooker says in simple sense, any kinds of rules or canon, which is made by the people with the objects, of defining and explaing the action of the people, which can be or cannot be done by the people, is said as law. This definition can be said as based on principle not in legal sense because it is silent with regards to the enforceability by State. D. Holand-Law is a general rule of external human actions, enforced by a sovereign political authority: Law is nothing but rules or accepted principles or thought of mind kind which is made by themselves to control or to regulate their conduct for the purpose of living in a groups or in a society. According to the Holand even though the rules are made for the above said object only the rules of general nature will come under the heading of law. Because every law in legal sense must be of that type which will apply to all not to special persons or groups’ which comes under the term law. The definitions of Holand indicate the term law is that general rules which try to control external human action not the internal actions.Because there are no rules which control the internal action or activities of the mankind. Hence every rule even general nature can control or regulated only the external activities of mankind. The term law in legal sense according to the Holand , those general rules of external human action which is enforced by a sovereign political authority. In other words those general rules of external human action will be law only when they are recognized and applied in case of need by the sovereign political authority (Govt) otherwise not. 3/15\n\n4. 1) Salmond-The law is the body of principles recognizes and applied by the State in the administration of the justice. The law according to Salmond is the body or groups of accepted principles or concept or thought of mankind created by them to control and to regulate their activity for the purpose of living together in the society, which is recognized and applied by the State. The law is nothing but the body of rules which is recognized and applied by court in the time of providing and administering the justice 2) Austin-Law is a rule of conduct imposed and enforced by sovereign: Law is nothing but only the rules, which define or explain the conduct or activities of the people, which is used for controlling or regulating their activities for the purpose of living in groups provided it is imposed and enforced by Sovereign State. The rules, which are imposed in the form of command by the sovereign authority for the purpose of enforcement of it to the people can be, said law. 3) Woodraw Wilson-Law is that portion of establish habit and thought of mankind which has gained distinct and formal recognization in the shape of uniform rules backed by authority and power of government Law is nothing but it is that part of establishment habit of the people which is arise out of the thought of mankind and has become popular as distinct and formal recognization as in shape of uniform rules which apply to all without any discrimination and help or backed by authority or power of the government in the process of utilizing it to the people. The definition of Woodraw Wilson with regards to the term law means: a. It is that part of establish habit of people and b. It is arise out of the thought of mankind and c. It become popular as distinct rules and d. It is formally recognized as uniform rule which applied to all without any discrimination among the people and e. It got the help or back of government in the process of utilizing it in the administration of justice. Nature and characteristic of law 1. It is conducted by sovereign authority: The law in legal sense is of such a nature, which will be use or enforce by a person or by any institute who has sovereign authority. Term sovereign authority indicates that power which he or they got from Govt or country or the constitution of that independent country. The law can be made or can be enforced by only that persons or institutions that have sovereign authority not by other. 2. It is the sets of rules of conduct of the society: The law always can be understood as a sets or body or groups of rules, regulation, principles and conducts made by the society for to control their harmful activities and to regularize or to encourages or to help to the activities for the development of society which is quite essentials to the people to live in a groups or in a society peacefully. Hence all these rules will be included in the term law provided they are recognized and applied by the State. 3. It regulate the external human behavior: The law always try to control and regulate only the external human behavior not the internal. Because no rules and regulation can control the internal behavior or activities of mankind, being internal activities always relate to the thinking process of the brain of the people which can not be known or decide by a independent person that what the other person is going to do. But the external activities are that activities for which one independent person can know what the other person is going to do. Hence the rules and regulations or law can regulate only the external human activities not internal one. 4/15\n\n5. 4. It has uniformity in action: The law has its uniformity when it has to bring in action. In other words when laws have to apply to the people it will apply in uniformity without discrimination among the people in the similar cases. Hence we can say that the law will treat equally to the people in the similar cases. 5. It is more powerful in the world than the lawmaker: The law even though made by a persons or groups or institution, it is more powerful than the maker. Because after making the law, they themselves will be under that law and they have to follow or obey that the rules. Hence it can be said that the lawmaker always makes their master who control them. 6. It helps people to live in a peaceful manner: The law always helps people to live in a peaceful manner. The law which will not help to live the people in a peaceful manner can not be said as law. Because one of the object of the introducing law to a society is to mentaining the peace in the society which is quite essential for the development of society and the country. Hence it is rightly said that imagination of developed society and country can not be done in the absence of peaceful environment in the society. 7. It stops or protects the people from committing the harmful or unwanted activities: The law by enforcing it always stops from committing unwanted activities of the people by creating fear in their mind that when they commit it, they will surely punished. Hence it indirectly protects them from doing such unwanted activities. 8. It is inevitable to develop the society: The development of society and country can not be imagine in the lacking of better legal system or better law in the country. Because the law always help to develop the society and the country. Therefore it can be said as it is inevitable to develop the society. 9. It is related to justice: The term law always is related to justice. In other words the law will be necessary when there arise the needs of giving justice to the people. The courts always try to find out the law or take the help of law, when there arise the need of providing justice in a case. Hence there is relation between law and justice. 10. It is administered by court: The administration or application of law is done in the court when there arise the dispute or cases between people and when they applied for justice. Thus it can be said the law will apply by the court if the cases is filed by the people. 11. It must accept by all the people or Citizen of the country: The law enforces by the Sovereign State or authority must accept or obey by all the people or citizen of that country. Because it can be said as it is command of the State to its people which all the people have to accept. Similarly it can be said that the law is made for the benefit of the people or country and that is why it must be accepted by all the people. 12. It is dynamic not static in nature: The term law for this purpose as understood in legal sense it can be said as dynamic. In other word it can be change according to the need and situation of the country, not being static. The law which cannot be changed according to the need of the country can not help for the development of society and the country. The change of law may arise because wrong rules may be made by the maker and change is inevitable for the correction of mistake committed by the lawmaker. 5/15\n\n6. Types of law The term law can be divided in various groups. In other words the law can be divided in different groups from the various points of view, which are as follow: 1) From the point of view of its source: - The law can be separated from one to another or can be given special name to the law from its source. The term sources means, it indicate that hole or point from which the law origin. From the point of origination of law it can be divided in different types, which are as follow: - a) Imperative law:-It is law, which arises out of the order of the superior power to the people, or persons who have to obey it. It can be said as command of a superior power or person given to the people, or can be said that rules or regulation which is imposed by the superior power one who have the authority, giving no choice to the people to accept or not i.e. the order of the king to the people and the order of commander in the military force which have follow or obey by the soldiers. b) Physical or scientific law: - The physical or scientific law is the rules which concern with the nature of science, which is perfect and sure and will not change in any case and will be same in all over the world. The physical or scientific law is the law, which is concern with nature. It can be said as natural law even though it is said as physical or scientific law. Because every scientific or physical law can be found in natural law. The natural law or rules propounded by the scientists said as scientific law. Hence every scientific or physical law is concern with the nature of science. It being natural law it is perfect and sure in comparison to man made law and will not change and will not change in any case and will be same in all over the world. i.e. the rule of life and death of the people. c) Moral or natural law: - It is that law which depends upon the rules of morality and natural justice and natural reasons. All the rules or law will be made on the basis of certain reasons or can be said depend upon certain reasons. But that law can be said as Moral or natural law, which is based upon the rules of morality. The rules of morality depend upon the natural reasons. The activities that are supported by goods natural reasons can be said as moral one and the activities which is supported by unnatural reasons or which is treated, as not goods by natural reasons can be said as immoral one. Therefore moral or natural law being based on reasons it can be said as law of reasons. It is unwritten law depending upon the morality of persons. d) Conventional law: - Any rules or system of rules agreed upon by persons for the control and regulation of their own conduct can be said as conventional law. The law made or created by the process of agreement between the parties or persons for the purpose of controlling and regulating their own conduct or activities with the aim of living all peaceful manner. The conventional laws only apply to those who agreed to that law. It cannot be applied to the persons who do not agree. Hence it can be said private or rules of particular groups not being of all the people of the country. i.e. the rules of clubs which try to control the activities of the member of the club who agreed to obey the rules. e) Customary law: - Any rules of action which is actually observed by men or people as their customs is known as customary law. The law, which is, arises out of the custome or rules, which is accepted or observed by the people known as customary law. It is to be noted that to be the customary rules the rules must be observed by the people since immemorial period or time and still continued to the present time. i.e. the rules of marriage of the people. 6/15\n\n7. f) Practical or technical law: - practical or technical law is that law which is made for the fulfillment of certain object of the persons. The rules which is used as in practice for the fulfillment of set objective of the people or such technique or methods used to get the fulfillment of the set object is known as practical or technical law, The rules which have to follow to make them success in fulfilling the object can be said as practical law. i.e. moving of two legs is essential for the fulfillment of the object of moving men from one place to another. g) International law: - The rules that determine the conduct of general body of civilized state in their mutual dealing are known as International law.

The international law will be followed by only that country who agreed it not by other. The acceptance or observation of this law depends upon the option of the country. No country binds another country to observed this law. h) Civil law or State law: - The law that applied by the State in the country is known as State or civil law. It is State law because of, it being made or creates by State by fulfilling the proper process, and which have to accept or follow by all the citizens or people of the country. 2) From the point of view of substantive and procedure: The law can be divide in different groups from the point of view of substantive and procedure. In the other words from the point of view of fact and procedure, which are as follow: - a) Substantive law or law of fact: - Substantive law or law of fact is that law which create and define the rights and obligation of a persons in a given circumstance.

Sources of law The term sources of law indicate that particular hole or fountains from which the law comes into existence in the country or world. The different writer or judges had given the different view with regards to the sources of Law: - Austin: State three groups with regards to sources of law: - A) Direct or immediate authority: i) Parliament: The person who works The direct or immediate authorities as a source of law, indicates those persons or institutions from which the country will get the law directly. In other words it indicate the lawmaker who will directly made the law. The parliament is treated as that institution that works as main body of making law. Hence it can be taken as one of the source under the heading of direct or immediate authority. ii) Ministry: the ministry too can be taken as a source of law under the direct or immediate authority because in the time of parliament session is not going on and there arise the need of making new rules, the ministry can make the law on the condition it will be send in parliament for approval latter on. 9/15\n\n10. iii) Groups of persons: The groups of persons too can be considering as a source under the direct or immediate authority. Because the groups may make the rules of conduct or custome for their own purpose and the court later on will be treated as law iv) Parties: By making agreement between two or more party too create the law provided the agreement made by them recognised by the court. Every agreement made between the parties if it is enforced by court is said as contract, which will be treated as law to those parties. Hence parties to the agreement too can be taken as a source under the direct or immediate authority. B) Historical document The historical document too can be taken as a source of law. Because in the process of making the law the lawmaker may take the help of historical document or books. The lawmaker when takes the help of historical document, they will be treated as sources of law. C) Causes: The cause or cases, which create the precedent, will be treated as law and the law being arisen because of cause or case, they can be taken as source of law. 2) Holand: Holand groups the sources of law in four sectors, which are as such: - a) Books or comment or explanation of prominent persons: Books, comments and explanation of the prominent figure of the country may be the source of law provides the court in the time of administration of justice takes the help of books, comments and explanation of prominent figure. Who simply write in the form of books, comment and explanation not in the form of law. b) State or government: The State and Govt too can be taken as one of the source of law .Now a days most of the law are made and enforced or apply by the authority of making and cancellation of law is given. Hence under that authority the State will be made and enforce the law in the country c) Custome and religions of the people: the Custome and usages and religions belonging the people too can be taken as a source of law provided the court in the time of administration of justice takes the help of it. In other words in the time of giving judgment if the judges takes the help or follow that customary rules or religions rules. d) Judge made law or case law: the judges too may be sources of law in case they gives the decision in a case in the absence of any written law and lack of customary rules in the country. Because in the lacking of written law and customary rules, the judges use to give their decision in the case, which is purely the product of judges and if that decision given by the judges followed by other judges in similar case with out any change will be treated as Precident and will be law later on. Thus it can be easily said that judges can be the sources of law. The law made by the judges know as judge made law or case law. 3) Salmond: Salmond divide the sources of law in two groups, which are as follows: - a) Historical sources: The law may have its source from history of the past of that country. Because in the time of administration of justice in a case, if the judges takes the help of historical events or rules it will comes in the form of law and will be as a sources. 10/15\n\n11. b) Legal source: The term legal source indicates that source of law, which is made by fulfilling all legal procedure of making law. i.e. i) Parliament: Parliament can be taken as one of the legal source. Because in present time only the parliament do have the authority of making the law. The parliament not only have the authority of making new law in the legal process but also do have the authority of cancellation of existing law in legal process. ii) Precident: The decision of judges in the case as Precident too will be the sources of law. Because in the time of giving the decision judges can give their own verdict, in the lacking of any written law and customary rules of the people in the country. The decision given in such case if followed by other judges in the similar cases lateron , it will be treated as Precident and recognised as law and in such a way the Precident will be source of law. iii) Customary law or custome of the people: The customary law or custome of the people is such rules which was made by the people themselves as custome from immemorial period and observed or accepted or used till the present time. These customary rules will be law, when the rules apply by the judges in the administration of justice or recognised by court as law for the purpose of giving decision in a case. The laws have taken the help of the customary rules and because of it customary rules can be taken as a source of law. iv) Conventional law is that law which arise out of the agreement between the concerning parties. The agreement or rules which is made or agreed between the parties for the purpose of controlling or regulating their own conduct may be one of the source of law when these agreement or rules is recognised as a law by the court and enforce in the court in the time of giving decision in a case. Business law Business law even it seems separate law it is one of the types of law under the civil law of country. The country may have different laws, which is made for proper running of the country. Among them business law also a types of law as among the other laws. Hence it is said business law is only one branch of law. The business law will not includes other types of law. The business law is made to regulate the business activities of the country. In other words the Business law is connected with business activities or can be said as that rules or law connected with trade commerce and industries. It deals with the rights and obligation of a businessman that arise out of the business transaction in respect of business property.
