METTA WORLD PEACE BIOGRAPHY

Metta World Peace, an NBA Champion and All-Star is best known for scoring the winning shot in the 2010 NBA Championship Game with the Los Angeles Lakers. As one of the NBA’s premier defenders, he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2004.

Despite these challenges, Metta has become a leading advocate for mental health awareness, sharing his personal struggles with depression and anxiety and inspiring many with his recovery journey.

Growing up in a neighborhood plagued by drugs and violence, Metta World Peace found solace in basketball, using the sport as a means to escape his environment.

Metta World Peace gained widespread admiration when he publicly thanked his therapist after his game-winning shot in the 2010 NBA Finals, a moment that played a significant role in destigmatizing mental health issues. Demonstrating his commitment to giving back, he raffled off his championship ring to benefit mental health charities and advocated for the Mental Health in Schools Act before Congress. In recognition of his efforts, he was honored with the NBA’s Citizenship Award and the Mental Health Hero Award.

In addition to his advocacy, Metta World Peace has made regular media appearances, starring in the Emmy-nominated Showtime Sports documentary, “Quiet Storm: The Ron Artest Story,” which featured NBA luminaries like Lamar Odom and Kobe Bryant.
