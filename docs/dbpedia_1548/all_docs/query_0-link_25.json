        "text": "Mobile nightclub Herz is showcased in a new documentary as an example of venues bucking a national decline in lesbian bars.\n\nAs reported by NBC News, “The Lesbian Bar Project” is a look at how the COVID-19 shutdown accelerated a long decline in the number of specifically lesbian venues in the country. The trend has been attributed to a mix of factors, including the rise of dating apps and a greater general acceptance of homosexuality that has made the LGBTQ community less reliant on the safe spaces of gay and lesbian venues.\n\n“Orange is the New Black” star Lea DeLaria is executive producer of the short documentary “The Lesbian Bar Project,” which is sponsored by Jaegermeister. The film is part of an ongoing fundraising campaign to support venues such as those depicted in the film.\n\nIn it, Herz co-owners Rachel and Sheila Smallman describe starting the bar after being run out of another place. “We’ve made so many differences in so many people’s lives, and it has been so amazing,” Sheila Smallman says of the experience.\n\nInclusion in the film isn’t the only recognition Herz has gotten in the COVID era. In September the Human Rights Campaign and Showtime announced it had been chosen to receive funding via the program “Queer to Stay: An LGBTQ+ Business Preservation Initiative.”"
