The new recreation center would be designed and built to fit cohesively within the existing park landscape and “the Hub,” a new community center campus with childcare services and recreational facilities. The vision for the overall Hub is to be an inclusive, safe, friendly, family and youth focused place for neighborhood residents and visitors.\n\nScope of Work\n\nThe recreation center will feature an indoor basketball court with bleachers, a multi-purpose room, restrooms, and associated staff spaces such as offices.\n\nThis facility would provide a much needed recreation center on the south side of San Francisco, and the goal is to create a clean, safe, warm and modern resource for all.\n\nFunding\n\nThe project combines funding from federal, city, and private funds as follows:\n\n2020 Health & Recovery Bond: $10,000,000\n\n2020 Health & Recovery Bond, Sustainability Program: $4,000,000\n\nSunnydale LLC Grant: $10,000,000\n\nGeneral Fund Capital Baseline: $600,000\n\nFederal Appropriation: $1,500,000\n\nTotal Sources: $26,100,000\n\nThe construction contract award for this project was approved by Recreation and Parks Commission on June 15, 2023 (PDF).
