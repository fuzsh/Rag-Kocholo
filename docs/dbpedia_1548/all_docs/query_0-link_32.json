        "text": "26 September 2023\n\nThe author of Das Bekreuzigte Hertz is Magdalena Sibylle of Württemberg, Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt by birth (1652–1712). Why did a princess publish a prayer book? What role did religion play in her official duties? In the early modern period, the education of a young princess at court consisted primarily of training in piety, not just for the sake of the salvation of her own soul but also to prepare her for her representative role as a precentor for her subjects and a protector of the church. The precise nature of a princess’s practice in piety was determined by customs at the court in which she grew up. A major feature was learning to retell her reading of the bible and the sermons she heard, recounted in her own words in written form and as ejaculatory prayers. At the court in Darmstadt, where Magdalena Sybille spent the first 13 years of her life, the practices of prayer and meditation were strongly influenced by poetry and emblematic illustrations, in particular through the writings of the popular Nuremberg devotional authors Johann Saubert, Johann Michael Dilherr and Georg Philipp Harsdörffer.\n\nWhat is emblematic illustration and why is it important to understand it in order to properly assess the thought of the early modern period? It is a European phenomenon that began in the 16th century and became a key foundation of all fields of art in the 17th century. An emblem is a combination of image and text that requires decoding. Emblems were so widespread and so well known that contemporaries were able to make connections when reading, contemplating or listening that are not immediately apparent to today’s readers.\n\nFollowing the death of her mother and until her betrothal in 1672, Magdalena Sibylle of Württemberg lived at the court of her aunt Hedwig Eleonora, Queen of Sweden, where the young princess continued her practice of pious writing and created her own cycle of emblems, which remained handwritten. In 1673 Magdalena Sibylle married the Hereditary Prince of Württemberg. The duchess was pregnant with her fourth child when her husband died suddenly in 1677. During the Nine Years’ War, the south-west of the Duchy of Württemberg was badly devastated by French troops. Magdalena Sibylle fought energetically for the co-regency, which was initially denied her, and over many decades she played an eminently significant role in successful negotiations with French attacking and occupying forces. In 1693, when her regency came to an end, she retired to her widow’s estates in Stetten and Kirchheim.\n\nThe regular publication of devotional books can be seen as a constitutive element of Magdalena Sibylle’s presentation of herself as the mother of her people, and in 1712, when she died, her writings were acknowledged as such with impressive celebrations during her funeral rites. Her works, including the new acquisition Das Bekreuzigte Hertz (1698), are handbooks for the domestic practice of meditation, prayer and song. Her emblems play a key role in this, as they offer visual inspiration for the users’ own practice of contemplation (fig. 1)."
