        "text": "Modern Methods for Atmospheric Profiling\n\nA hands-on course for Master students and early-stage PhD candidates\n\nThe 48 participants from HErZ partner universities and international institutions will\n\nlearn how atmos­pher­ic pro­fil­ers work\n\nactive­ly par­tic­i­pate in a mete­o­ro­log­i­cal field cam­paign\n\nper­form a first research project\n\nget to know senior sci­en­tists, poten­tial employ­ers, and fel­low stu­dents in the field\n\nspend time togeth­er and shape future con­tacts\n\nKey Information\n\nSum­mer school core time: two weeks, 12.–23. August 2024 at the Jülich Obser­va­to­ry for Cloud Evo­lu­tion (JOYCE) locat­ed at Forschungszen­trum Jülich\n\nYou will work togeth­er with 2–3 peo­ple on a dis­tinct research ques­tion relat­ed to atmos­pher­ic pro­fil­ing. See the list of projects for details.\n\nThere will be key-note lec­tures, dis­cus­sion rounds, BBQs and oth­er joint activ­i­ties and a con­clud­ing “sum­mer school con­fer­ence” with a poster ses­sion where each group presents their find­ings.\n\nPar­tic­i­pa­tion is free of charge, includ­ing arranged accom­mo­da­tion, but trav­el and gen­er­al pro­vi­sions must be paid for by the par­tic­i­pants them­selves.\n\nFor Mas­ter stu­dents: the sum­mer school is val­ued with 6 ETCS. Stu­dents from Cologne and Bonn reg­is­ter for the METFUT II mod­ule. Par­tic­i­pants from oth­er HErZ part­ner uni­ver­si­ties, please coor­di­nate with your stu­dent advi­so­ry ser­vice how the course can be cred­it­ed.\n\nIn an on-line prepara­to­ry sem­i­nar, the par­tic­i­pants present their research projects start­ing from June 17 — July 15, Mon­days at 16:00. If you are inter­est­ed in join­ing, please con­tact us using the email address giv­en below.\n\nBackground\n\nThe sum­mer school is car­ried out joint­ly by the Uni­ver­si­ty of Cologne (Insti­tut for Geo­physics and Mete­o­rol­o­gy) and the Uni­ver­si­ty of Bonn (Insti­tute for Geo­sciences, Sec­tion Mete­o­rol­o­gy) and fund­ed with­in the Hans-Ertel-Cen­ter for Weath­er Research (HErZ). HErZ is a col­lab­o­ra­tive research ini­tia­tive between the Ger­man Weath­er Ser­vice (DWD) and Ger­man part­ner uni­ver­si­ties.\n\nWith­in the HErZ HIRES-APP project, two cam­paigns VITAL (Verti­cal pro­fil­ing of the Tro­pos­phere: Inno­va­tion, opTimiza­tion and AppLica­tion) I & II will take place at Forschungszen­trum Jülich (August 2024), respec­tive­ly in the Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Jülich (ABC/J) region (Sum­mer 2026)\n\nThe focus of VITAL I is on the ver­ti­cal struc­ture of the tro­pos­phere to con­tribute to fill­ing the obser­va­tion­al gap of wind, water vapor and tem­per­a­ture pro­file obser­va­tions in the Atmos­pher­ic Bound­ary Lay­er. Nov­el, state-of-art mea­sure­ment tech­niques will be test­ed, eval­u­at­ed and com­pared to each oth­er. VITAL I will take place at JOYCE and prof­it from the avail­able mea­sure­ment infra­struc­ture. JOYCE is an ACTRIS Nation­al Facil­i­ty and a cen­tral part of CPEX-LAB — Cen­ter for Cloud and Pre­cip­i­ta­tion Explo­ration Lab­o­ra­to­ry with­in the Geover­bund ABC/J.\n\nVITAL I will inte­grate the sum­mer school for atmos­pher­ic pro­fil­ing aim­ing at young HErZ researchers from the Mas­ter to PhD-lev­el. With­in a time peri­od of two weeks, we will offer intro­duc­to­ry lec­tures, hands-on-train­ing, data analy­sis and sup­port for a medi­al pre­sen­ta­tion of the results. Train­ing is offered on pas­sive remote sens­ing (microwave radiome­ter, infrared inter­fer­om­e­ter), active remote sens­ing (Doppler lidar, water vapor lidar), UAS (Uncrewed Air­craft Sys­tem — drone) pro­fil­ing, tur­bu­lent flux obser­va­tions, atmos­pher­ic radi­a­tion, aerosol pro­fil­ing, satel­lite pro­fil­ing, radiosonde sound­ing as well as model/data eval­u­a­tion. Par­tic­i­pants will be able to choose their own research projects after the first prepara­to­ry sem­i­nar on April 15.\n\nCon­tact: herz_summerschool@listen.uni-bonn.de\n\nCompany sponsoring is kindly provided by\n\nAdditional Summer School support is provided by"
