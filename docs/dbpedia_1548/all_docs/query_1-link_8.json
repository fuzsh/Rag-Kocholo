        "text": "Computer simulation is increasingly being viewed as an essential design tool by cardiac device and services companies. Computer simulation helps them visualize what they cannot see, replicate in vivo conditions, more fully explore the design space, refine ideas faster, and develop novel service solutions that are more effective and safer for patients. All of which leads to better designs and a reduction in expensive prototyping and testing, allowing companies to get products and services to market faster.\n\nCurrent Project Members:\n\n4RealSim Services B.V.\n\nADCOM\n\nAdmedes Schuessler GmbH\n\nAdvisian\n\nBayer Pharmaceuticals\n\nBIOMODEX\n\nBioSerenity\n\nBiotronik\n\nBoston Scientific Corporation\n\nCAPVIDIA\n\nComputational Life\n\nDevice Analytics\n\nEchobio\n\nEdwards Lifesciences\n\nEngineering Systems, Inc.\n\nenmodes GmbH\n\nExponent, Inc.\n\nFEops\n\nFront End Analytics\n\nHewlett-Packard Enterprise\n\nInfosys Limited\n\nInsilicomed, Inc.\n\nIntel\n\nMaterialise\n\nMedinol\n\nMedtronic, Inc.\n\nMicroPort Cardiac Rhythm Management\n\nNanjing Saint Medical Tech.

Gore\n\nzSpace, Inc.\n\nZygote Media Group\n\nHow are industry members supporting the Living Heart Project?\n\nInformation-gathering for the project is taking place in a pre-competitive manner – i.e., not device-specific, but disease-specific—so that product information and patent protection is assured. Companies are evaluating the model for applications in their areas of interest. Their suggestions for model refinement, new applications, technological implementation or contributions of model or test-validation data contribute to the pursuit of realistic simulations capable of reliably replicating clinically observed behavior.\n\nThe vast amount of public and private money that is spent on CVD research is never translated into clinical reality. At the core of this challenge is the difficulty in exploring new and innovative treatment options cost-effectively while meeting regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy.\n\nIn silico techniques hold great promise in their ability to yield unprecedented insight into basic function and, when sufficiently refined and validated, offer a risk-free environment for predicting in vivo results that may be unobtainable any other way. Determining the appropriate clinical treatment for CVD can be greatly enhanced when combined with the insight and guidance revealed through accurate simulation of heart function.\n\nClinicians are participating in The Living Heart Project to evaluate the readiness of such simulation tools to current problems, and to help drive the development of state-of-the-art technologies and applications that will further improve patient care.\n\nCurrent Project Members:\n\nJacques Kpodonu | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\n\nDavid Hoganson, M.D. | Boston Children's Hospital\n\nVolkmar Falk, M.D. | Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin\n\nBernard Bulwer | Echo Stethoscope Academy Project\n\nFuwai Hospital\n\nRobert Persson, M.D. | Haukeland University Hospital\n\nAndreas Valeur, M.D. | Haukeland University Hospital\n\nElazer Edelman, M.D., Ph.D. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMarcello Gomide, M.D. | National Institute of Cardiology\n\nNational Heart Centre Singapore\n\nJames C.

By collaborating with project participants, clinicians provide valued guidance in how best to use the power of simulation to diagnose and treat patient-specific conditions.\n\nClinicians monitor and evaluate the development of the model in a collaborative way as the project progresses over time. Their suggestions—based on actual patient experience, ideas about applications to specific disease states, and/or thoughts about model enhancement or refinement derived from clinical data—contribute to the pursuit of realistic simulations capable of reliably replicating observed behavior.\n\nRegulatory compliance is a key component of device development. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through initiatives such as the creation of a simulation model repository and Medical Device Design Tools (MDDTs), has stepped up efforts to more actively encourage the use of simulation. The FDA recognizes the value of simulation for device development, for cardiac services and treatments, and for virtual testing that supports the approval of device submissions. Simulation is also understood to help reduce animal testing and clinical trial costs, improve upon bench testing, and provide deeper understanding of in vivo behavior where traditional methods of assessing devices simply aren’t possible.\n\nThrough sponsorships and active participation in organizations like the Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC) the FDA is exploring how to leverage simulation to advance regulatory science through various initiatives.\n\nProject Members:\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\nMedical Device Innovation Consortium\n\nHow are regulatory agencies supporting the Living Heart Project?\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge for any medical regulatory agency is accessing the safety of new devices without relying on costly and invasive human testing. Regulatory science stakeholders monitor and evaluate the development of the model in a collaborative way as the project progresses over time. Their participation is valuable in assessing the validity of the heart model for its mechanical and material properties, in developing test protocols, and in creating strategies for validation of the heart model for specific contexts of use."
