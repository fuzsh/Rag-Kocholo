        "text": "\"Project Orange,\" the anonymous company that had been negotiating with Lee County for jobs stimulus money, turns out to have a familiar name: it's a division of Hertz.\n\n\"Hertz Equipment Rental (HERC) is 'Project Orange' \" said Rich Boome, Hertz Global executive vice president for corporate affairs on Wednesday.\n\nHertz on Tuesday signed a 10-year lease for 55,220 square feet in the old Source Interlink building at Riverview Corporate Center on U.S. 41 in Bonita Springs.\n\nAt present, Hertz Equipment is a subsidiary of Hertz Global Holdings, which is building a 300,000-square-foot world headquarters in Estero and is operating out of temporary quarters at the Fifth Third Bank Building in Naples.\n\nBut Hertz Global plans to spin off Hertz Equipment, which rents bulldozers, backhoes and road graders.\n\nBroome said discussions with county and state economic development officials were going smoothly, but Hertz suspended the talks because of its ongoing financial review and a new interim CEO.\n\n\"Now is not the right time to make any decision about the HERC headquarters,\" he said, referring to Hertz Equipment by its future stock market ticker symbol when it becomes an independent company.\n\nIt's possible those discussions could resume as Hertz continues to increase its presence here, Broome said.\n\nIf the deal had gone through, Lee was to provide $210,000 as part of the state's matching Qualified Target Industry incentive program, and another $170,000 from its own Job Opportunities Program, for a total incentive package of $380,000.\n\nThe state's responsibility was to be $840,000 from its targeted industries program and another $432,000 in \"Quick Action Closing Fund\" incentives, for a total state commitment of just less than $1.3 million.\n\n\"We will continue to work with both companies to help them fill positions and otherwise facilitate their growth in Southwest Florida,\" said Glen Salyer, county director of economic development and assistant to the county manager, in an email Wednesday. \"This is particularly exciting because we expect these HERC-related jobs will be in addition to the jobs for which Lee County is giving Hertz incentive funds.\"\n\nBonita Springs Mayor Ben Nelson said he's hopeful that the building will ultimately become HERC's headquarters. \"I think that's exactly what it's heading for.\"\n\nNelson said it's encouraging that when Hertz made the decision to move into the Riverview space, it stayed in Bonita.\n\n\"Those incentives are good, but it's never really the real reason they end up being where they're at,\" he said. \"There are so many more things that are important to these companies: transportation issues, the quality of life, schools â€” there's just a bundle of things that are way more important than the money.\"\n\nBroome said the first wave of Hertz Equipment employees in the Source Interlink building wouldn't have brought economic incentives to Hertz Global anyway because they're already working in Lee County.\n\nConnect with this reporter: @DickHogan (Twitter)"
