        "text": "Alaska lawmaker’s bid to revive stalled green energy policy defines coal as ‘clean’\n\nBurning coal to make electricity generates significantly more carbon pollution than using natural gas for the same purpose. But a new bill drafted by Sutton Republican Rep. George Rauscher still seeks to define coal-generated electricity as “clean energy” — putting it on the same footing as wind, solar, tidal and hydroelectric power. The proposed legislation, […]\n\nGreen energy advocates say Anchorage utility “freezing out” efforts for gas-saving price structure\n\nA green power advocacy group says Anchorage’s electric utility is thwarting its efforts to propose an energy-saving payment scheme for customers, and it’s asking state regulators to step in to force the utility to hand over detailed data. The data request by Renewable Energy Alaska Project, an Anchorage-based nonprofit, has prompted a torrent of opposition […]\n\nMountains to ocean: a dispatch from Canadian coal country\n\nA few months ago, I was on vacation in Vancouver, riding a bike along the north shore of the city’s harbor. It’s Canada’s largest and a major port, with cranes and warehouses along the water’s edge and cargo vessels anchored offshore. At a certain point, I took a look back toward the water and beheld […]\n\nPolitical pressure builds as state-led Alaska LNG project goes another year without a deal\n\nPolitical pressure is building on Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration to show progress on its huge state-sponsored liquefied natural gas export project, as it asks the Legislature for another $4.5 million to keep it alive. Boosters say there’s still substantial interest from potential investors and partners in the $43 billion Alaska LNG project, amid […]\n\nAlaska senator vows to kill renewables bill as energy debate heats up in Juneau\n\nEven before Alaska’s annual legislative session gets into high gear, debate over a prominent renewable energy bill is intensifying, with a state senator vowing to block it in committee and an advocacy group hiring a lobbyist to push it forward. Environmental organizations and green power producers have been pushing lawmakers for the past two years […]\n\nPeter Pan’s King Cove plant will stay closed this winter as fishing industry turmoil spreads\n\nIn a major hit to Southwest Alaska’s fishing industry, Peter Pan Seafood Co. will keep its huge plant in the village of King Cove shuttered this winter, meaning that the company won’t be processing millions of dollars worth of cod, whitefish and crab. “It’s one of the most difficult days of my life,” Rodger May, […]\n\nWashington conservation group proposes listing Alaska king salmon under Endangered Species Act\n\nA Washington state-based environmental group says it’s filing a petition asking the Biden administration to list southern Alaska king salmon as an endangered species — following through on notice of intent it filed last year. The Wild Fish Conservancy’s 68-page petition says that the king salmon, also known as Chinook, are threatened by climate change […]\n\nAs ConocoPhillips’ Willow project advances, two local governments have withdrawn their criticism\n\nAs ConocoPhillips begins a major winter construction season for its planned Willow oil development, the governments of a North Slope village that were among the few local institutions to criticize the project have both changed their positions, according to newly released documents. The Indigenous Iñupiat community of Nuiqsut, population 550, is the closest village to […]\n\nAlaska lost a challenge to a COVID-era emergency moose hunt. Now, it’s appealing for a second time.\n\nIn the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the leader of a Southeast Alaska island village’s tribal government asked federal managers to open an emergency hunt, citing the community’s fears about having enough food. The request was approved by a federal management agency, the Federal Subsistence Board, and the harvest of moose and deer went ahead, […]\n\nTribes say Biden administration failed consult on grant to graphite mine\n\nThree tribal governments near a major proposed graphite mine on Alaska’s Seward Peninsula say the Biden administration violated its own internal policies by granting $37.5 million to the Canadian company advancing the project without consulting with the tribes first. The tribal governments of the communities of Teller, Brevig Mission and Mary’s Igloo each privately sent […]\n\nAlaska transportation leaders weigh Knik Arm tunnel\n\nState transportation leaders say they’re taking another look at the idea of using a tunnel instead of a bridge to connect the city of Anchorage with undeveloped land across the Knik Arm, in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Alaska politicians have advanced the idea of the Knik Arm bridge in the past as a way for Anchorage […]\n\nCould a new Alaska coal power plant be climate friendly? An $11 million study aims to find out.\n\nThe Biden administration has announced a $9 million grant to Alaska researchers to study a project that could capture carbon emissions from a big new coal-fired power plant and inject them in a depleted natural gas field not far from Anchorage. The University of Alaska Fairbanks would lead the research into what’s known as carbon […]"
