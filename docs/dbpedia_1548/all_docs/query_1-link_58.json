        "text": "As a rule, a new route should run as parallel as possible to already operational or planned line projects of 50Hertz or third-party operators, in application of the so-called bundling principle.\n\nThe offshore cable route for the OST-6-1 grid connection is about 54 km long: it runs from the eastern offshore substation via the western offshore substation up to the planned landing area in the territory of the municipality of Dierhagen. From there, the land route with an approximate length of 35 km runs to the new substation to be constructed in the Sanitz/Gnewitz/Dettmannsdorf/Marlow survey area.\n\nOffshore route\n\nTo minimise the impact on nature and environment, optimal route planning is important. In other words, the length of the cable route shall be kept as short as possible, ideally bundled with existing or planned cable projects. That is why 50Hertz is planning an offshore route corridor from the landing area to the coastal waters that for the most part is located in an already approved cable corridor and is bundled with existing and planned submarine cables. The remaining part of the offshore route mainly runs through the buffer strip of the offshore wind farm (OWF). Three submarine cable systems will be installed to transport the OWF output of around 900 MW.\n\nLanding area\n\nThe landing area is planned in the municipal territory of Dierhagen. As the existing corridor that was approved in the spatial planning for this area is already completely occupied by other cable projects, a different landing area is needed for OST-6-1. The study to find a suitable landing area must take into account both the technical feasibility and the minimisation of potential effects on people and the environment.\n\nOnshore route\n\nFrom the planned landing area of the submarine cable in the municipal territory of Dierhagen, the electricity generated at sea will be transported to the new substation to be constructed by means of a 35-km underground cable. On the land side, three 220-kV AC underground cable systems will be laid within an already approved cable corridor of around 12-15 km. To meet the expected development needs in the Baltic Sea, the construction of an empty or protective conduit system along the route is also planned.\n\nThe underground cable route, which is still being planned, should follow as straight a line as possible and is subject to a number of spatial planning, environmental and other criteria. Intersections with other lines, buildings, residential areas, streets and gas mains shall for instance be avoided as much as possible. Nature conservation areas and forests shall also be circumvented.\n\n50Hertz is obliged by law to connect the wind farms in the Baltic Sea and manage the overall electricity system in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The grid connection for so-called coastal water projects, in this case the Gennaker offshore wind farm, is realised in accordance with § 17d (6) of the German energy industry act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG).\n\nPermit for offshore route and offshore substations\n\nThe offshore route and substations are located in the coastal waters and therefore within the area of jurisdiction of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. For the submarine cable and the two offshore substations, a joint planning approval procedure is planned. The authority in charge of the procedure is the Ministry of Economics, Infrastructure, Tourism and Labour of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (WM M-V).\n\nIn order to limit the environmental impact to a minimum, 50Hertz plans large parts of the offshore route in a corridor that was already surveyed with regard to spatial planning and will bundle it with existing and planned submarine cables. The other part of the offshore route will be located in the buffer strip of the offshore wind farm.\n\nFor infrastructure projects like the OST-6-1 grid connection, the first planning step consists in studying the need for a spatial planning procedure (ROV). As the OST-6-1 grid connection will mostly run within an already approved cable corridor, 50Hertz is of the opinion that there is no need for the ROV and has notified the Ministry of Economics, Infrastructure, Tourism and Labour of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (WM M-V) of this in accordance with §15 (5) sentence 2 of the German spatial planning act (Raumordnungsgesetz, ROG).\n\nIf the authority does not consider a spatial planning procedure to be necessary either, the planning approval procedure will be started up as a next step.\n\nThe planning approval procedure is a comprehensive and detailed permit review, which also determines whether the building permit for the project is granted or not. Simply put, the planning approval procedure primarily deals with the “where” and “how” of the construction project (such as the specification of the location, structures, technical implementation etc.). During the approval procedure, the legally responsible authorities, environmental associations and the general public are formally involved in accordance with the applicable legal stipulations. 50Hertz also organises an early public participation campaign in support of this procedure (also referred to as ‘citizen dialogue’) even before the planning approval procedure has started (see also Transparency and Public Participation).\n\nPermit for the onshore route\n\nThe area where the submarine cables first reach land is called the landing area. It marks the transition from sea to land. From here, the electricity generated at sea is transported to the point of common connection, which will be located in an onshore substation that still needs to be constructed.\n\nAs large parts of the onshore route also fall within an already approved cable corridor, 50Hertz is planning to submit a notification for the waiver of the spatial planning procedure in accordance with §15 (5) sentence to of the German spatial planning act (Raumordnungsgesetz, ROG) for this part of the OST-6-1 project as well.\n\nIf the authority does not consider a spatial planning procedure to be necessary either, the planning approval procedure will be started up as a next step.\n\nThe planning approval procedure is a comprehensive and detailed permit review, which also determines whether the building permit for the project is granted or not. Simply put, the planning approval procedure primarily deals with the “where” and “how” of the construction project (such as the specification of the location, structures, technical implementation etc.).\n\nDuring the approval procedure, the legally responsible authorities, environmental associations and the general public are formally involved in accordance with the applicable legal stipulations. 50Hertz also organises an early public participation campaign in support of this procedure (also referred to as ‘citizen dialogue’) even before the planning approval procedure has started (see also Transparency and Public Participation).\n\nPermit for onshore substation\n\nThe 220-kilovolt (kV) alternating current cables will be connected to the German extra-high-voltage grid in a substation, the so-called point of common connection. The necessary transformation of the voltage level from 220 to 380 kV takes place in this substation.\n\nIn connection with the planned upgrade of 220-kV overhead lines in the region to the 380-kV level, construction of a new substation is also planned in the Sanitz/Gnewitz/Dettmannsdorf/Marlow survey area. The overall project “Grid reinforcement in the Rostock region” was confirmed in the German federal requirements plan act (Bundesbedarfsplangesetz, BBPlG) in 2021. The substation will be approved in a separate procedure under the German federal immission control act (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz, BImSChG)."
