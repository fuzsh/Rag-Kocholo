        "text": "Guitarist Marcel Neumann would like you to know that WE BUTTER THE BREAD WITH BUTTER “are NOT a joke band.” I wish he’d told me that a couple of weeks ago when I was out cruising in the Mazda3 I’d been loaned, while cranking SiriusXM Liquid Metal under the cover of darkness. It was then that my ears first took in the music of WE BUTTER THE BREAD WITH BUTTER, but all I could think was – “There’s actually a band called WE BUTTER THE BREAD WITH BUTTER.” Much to my surprise, a press stream of their PROJEKT HERZ EP arrived in my inbox here at Rock Father HQ a few days later.\n\nOn PROJEKT HERZ (just released ‘Stateside this month after having been released elsewhere late last year), American audiences get their first official taste of the German band, which can best be described as some sort of electro-deathcore. Unimpressed with the first few tracks and their messy and noisier approach to landing somewhere near BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME and THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN with hints of RAMMSTEIN-lite tossed in, I almost tuned out.\n\nBut then a trio of songs – “USA,” “Western Beta,” and “Euphorie” grabbed me.\n\nThere’s some intriguing melodies that manage to break through the chaos – classical guitar on “Western Beta” – and a synth lead in “Euphorie” that wouldn’t be out of place on a record by THE BIRTHDAY MASSACRE.\n\n{source} {/source}\n\nIt’s interesting… enough to make me look back at WE BUTTER THE BREAD WITH BUTTER’s past output, including this performance from 2010:\n\n{source} {/source}\n\nI have to note that I was worried that some of the synchronized moves would enter into “crabcore” territory (I usually prefer such unified rocking to be left to KISS or ZZ TOP), but once again – while that older track might not represent where the band is in 2013, my interest is piqued.\n\nPROJEKT HERZ is available now, with their next full-length, GOLDKINDER, expected this August.\n\n{source}http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-lrg.png) no-repeat;width:110px;height:40px;@media only screen{background-image:url(http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets/images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-lrg.svg);}”>{/source}\n\nThe Rock Father Rating: 3/5 Stars"
