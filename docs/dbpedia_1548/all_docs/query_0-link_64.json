        "text": "August 14, 2023 9:15 AM EDT | Source: Hertz Energy Inc.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nHertz has entered into an assignment agreement pursuant to which it has acquired the option to acquire the prospective Patriota Lithium Project in the mining friendly state of Minas Gerais in Brazil.\n\nThese tenements are strategically situated proximal to the highly prolific 'Eastern Brazilian Pegmatite Province\" (the \"EBPP\") and within the Araçuaí Pegmatite District (the \"APD\"). The EBPP is the largest lithium pegmatite province of South America and one of the most important pegmatite provinces around the world.\n\nThe Patriota Lithium Project is a 2,964 hectare (contiguous 29 square kilometers) mineral claim block in Brazil's Minas Gerais State, a mining-friendly jurisdiction located approximately 45 kms from Sigma Lithium Corp.'s Grota do Cirilo property, the largest lithium hard rock deposit in the Americas.\n\nThe Patriota Lithium Project is located near other lithium exploration and production projects operated by Sigma Lithium Corp., Lithium Ionic, Latin Resources Limited and the Companhia Brasileira de Lítio Ltda.'s Cachoeira lithium mine. Although the Company believes the spatial association with these important advancing lithium deposits and mines supports the potential of the Patriota Lithium Project, is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property.\n\nThe location boasts advantageous infrastructure, comprising well-developed highways, access to hydroelectric power from the grid, water availability, and convenient proximity to commercial ports and residential townships.\n\nThe option represents Hertz's first Brazilian project which is complementary to the Company's Lucky Mica Lithium Project in Arizona which continues to move through the permitting and progress to trenching phase\n\nHertz plans to commence rapid exploration in the coming weeks and months.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - August 14, 2023) - Hertz Lithium Inc. (CSE: HZ) (OTCQB: HZLIF) (FSE: QE2) (\"Hertz\" and/or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the acquisition of the option (the \"Option\") to acquire a 100% interest in the Patriota Lithium Project. The Company acquired the Option pursuant to the terms and conditions of an option assignment agreement (the \"Assignment Agreement\") entered into among the Company, Brascan Resources Inc. (\"Brascan\"), BHBC Exploracao Mineral LTDA (\"BHBC\"), and RTB Geologia e Mineracao LTDA (\"RTB\", and together with BHBC, the \"Optionors\"). Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the Company has acquired Brascan's rights, including the Option, granted pursuant to an option agreement (the \"Option Agreement\") entered into among Brascan, BHBC, and RTB.\n\nThrough the acquisition of the Option, Hertz gains access to a strategically located and highly prospective lithium project situated in the mining friendly state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A key advantage lies in the projects strategic location within the APD and proximal to the renowned EBPP, one of the most important pegmatite provinces around the world and a globally recognized hub for hard-rock lithium spodumene deposits. Notably, this region accounts for 100% of all government presently recognized lithium reserves in Brazil, making it highly valued for its abundant spodumene pegmatites.\n\nOver the past two years, Brazil's importance in the lithium exploration space has expanded significantly with the tremendous success of Sigma Lithium Corp., followed by Latin Resources Limited, and the up and coming Lithium Ionic Corp..\n\nFigure 1: Eastern Brazilian Pegmatite Province Lithium District\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9656/177055_56ed936404a02a87_002full.jpg\n\nFigure 2: Map of Patriota Lithium Project\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9656/177055_56ed936404a02a87_003full.jpg\n\nDetails of the lithium resources reported in Figures 1 and 2 are provided in the various company websites listed below. No qualified person from Hertz Lithium has to verified the reported resource estimates, and the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property on the Patriota Project. Hertz is only reporting these resource estimates as to support the regional potential for significant lithium mineralization.\n\nSource: www.cblitio.com.br/mineracao/\n\nSource: Lithium Ionic Corporate Presentation: https://lithiumionic.com/investors/presentations/\n\nSource: https://www.latinresources.com.au/salinas-lithium-project-brazil/\n\nSource: Sigma Lithium Corp www.sigmalithiumresources.com/grota-do-cirilo/\n\nGeological Detail\n\nThe Patriota Lithium Project under Option for Hertz Lithium shows strong high-level prospectively criteria within the Araçuaí Pegmatite District (APD) and proximal to prolific EBPP. The tenements are strategically located within the Salinas Formation metasedimentary rocks that were deposited prior to the Araçuaí orogeny. The Salinas Formation hosts the most prolific lithium pegmatites in the region. Pegmatite swarms intruded the region during the collisional Neoproterozoic to post-collisional Paleoproterozoic Araçuaí orogeny. L-C-T pegmatites (Lithium - Cesium - Tantalum) include the pegmatitic granites surrounding the richest lithium pegmatites in the SIGMA/CBL/Lithium Ionic region, as well as the nearest mapped (exposed) granite to the Patriota Lithium Project (16 kilometres to the north). The regional granite rocks are classified into five supersuites (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5). Groups G3, G4 and G5 formed during the post-collisional episode associated with the Gondwana Supercontinent's Trans-Amazonian event (CPRM 2016a, 2016b). Notably, the potential pegmatite corridor associated with lithium mineralized pegmatites with the G4 supersuite.\n\nHertz believes the association with proximal G4 suite granites supports the potential for a favourable association with regional pegmatite swarms within the tenement areas. It is worth noting that both Sigma Lithium's Grota do Cirilo spodumene mine and Latin Resources Colina Project are surrounded by the same G4 supersuite granites as those mapped most closely to the tenements that Hertz holds the Option to acquire. These compelling geological associations point to lithium potential within these exploration areas.\n\nHertz acknowledges that the tenements under Option have not undergone any exploration activities to date, and as a result, the existence of pegmatites and/or lithium mineralisation remains uncertain. Nonetheless, a comprehensive desktop review of the regional and local geology, along with the presence of significant spodumene mining and development activities in close proximity, offers supplementary evidence supporting the potential of the tenements.\n\nTransaction Structure and Consideration\n\nAs consideration for the acquisition of the Option and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Assignment Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate of $148,000 in cash, as follows:\n\nreimburse Brascan $3,300 in claim maintenance within two days following the execution of the Assignment Agreement;\n\npay Brascan $15,000 within two days following the execution of the Assignment Agreement;\n\npay Brascan $105,000 in exchange for Brascan issuing 3,000,000 common shares to the Optionors, within five business days following confirmation that the shares have been issued; and\n\npay Brascan $25,000 on or before 45 days following the execution of the Assignment Agreement.\n\nIn order to exercise the Option in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement, the Company must:\n\npay BHBC $50,000 by September 20, 2023;\n\npay BHBC $3,300 by September 20, 2023 to cover mineral right taxes;\n\nincur $100,000 in exploration expenditures on the Patriota Lithium Project by September 20, 2023;\n\npay BHBC $3,300 to cover mineral right taxes up to June 30, 2024;\n\npay BHBC $50,000 by October 1, 2024;\n\nincur $100,000 in exploration expenditures on the Patriota Lithium Project by September 30, 2024; and\n\npay $50,000 by September 30, 2025.\n\nThe Optionors will retain a 2% NSR with the Company having the option to repurchase 1% of the NSR for a cash payment of $500,000 for a period of two years after the commencement of commercial production.\n\nAdditionally, upon the confirmation of the existence of spodumene from surface sample assays results on the Patriota Lithium Project grading minimum 1% lithium, the Company will be required to pay Brascan $100,000 in cash.\n\nMr. Kal Malhi, Chairman and Director of Hertz, commented, \"We are laser focused to build Hertz Lithium into a multi-faceted lithium mineral exploration company with our Lucky Mica Lithium Project in Arizona and now the Patriota Lithium Project in Brazil and our Penn State Lithium Extraction Patent Licence.
