Hi-Rezzers are fueled by our game communities and the love they have for the realms and battlegrounds that we are lucky enough to create and grow.\n\nOur games have been played by more than 70 million people worldwide on PC, mobile, and console, which blows our minds. Our experiences with such an awesome community of gamers are the major reason why we are trailblazers of the F2P and cross-play movements. We want all players to be able to game with their friends regardless of platform, just as we like to game with ours."
