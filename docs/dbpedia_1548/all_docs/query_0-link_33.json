        "text": "Alaska’s embattled economic development agency signs contracts with seven law firms\n\nAlaska’s embattled economic development agency has signed new contracts with seven law firms — reflecting what its leader says is a desire to handle its legal issues more quickly, and independently from the executive branch. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA, is pushing an array of controversial projects across the state, from […]\n\nInside the “titanic” legal case that will help determine Alaska’s energy future: an analysis\n\nShould Anchorage residents who consume more electricity, and use up more of the region’s dwindling supplies of natural gas, have to pay a higher price to reflect the steeper cost of the imported fuel that will replace it? How much will developers of wind and solar projects have to pay to move the electricity they […]\n\nBiden administration rejects top Inslee choice for Alaska fish commission, reappoints trawl ally\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and to reflect the formal announcement of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council appointments. The Biden administration has rejected a nominee for a key Alaska fisheries management post who could have tipped decisions toward the interests of tribes and conservation groups and away from the priorities of the […]\n\nInside the U.S. Coast Guard’s Aleutian encounter with China’s military — and what it means\n\nThe Chinese warships weren’t showing up on civilian radar. But the American commercial fishing fleet could still tell that something strange was happening in the Aleutian Islands on July 6 and 7. Crew on the fishing vessels picked out a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, the Kimball, steaming through the area at 21 knots, or nearly […]\n\nAs salmon season kicks off, some Alaska fishermen fear for their futures\n\nHOMER — On a brilliant spring morning, Buck Laukitis, a longtime fisherman from this Kenai Peninsula town, stood at the city dock watching his catch come ashore. Crew members aboard Laukitis’ boat, the Oracle, filled bags with dozens of halibut — some of the fatter ones worth $200 or more — which a crane would […]\n\nAlaska Gov. Dunleavy picks second ex-talk radio host for lucrative fish job after first rejected\n\nIn May, the Alaska Legislature narrowly rejected a conservative talk radio host’s appointment to a highly paid position regulating the state’s commercial fisheries. Now, after the failure of that pick, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has chosen a new appointee with a similar — though not identical — background for the six-figure job at the Commercial […]\n\nIn Northwest Alaska, an economic engine runs low on ore\n\nAlaska’s most powerful elected officials reacted with outrage last month when the Biden administration announced it was rejecting a state agency’s plan to build a new road across remote Northwest Alaska, to access an array of mining deposits. Mining company officials and their political allies had touted the road, and the mines that could be […]\n\nBiden administration advances bid to list Gulf of Alaska king salmon as endangered or threatened\n\nThe Biden administration says that listing numerous Alaska king salmon populations under the Endangered Species Act could be warranted, and it now plans to launch a broader scientific study to follow its preliminary review. Citing the species’ diminished size at adulthood and spawning numbers below sustainable targets set by state managers, the National Marine Fisheries […]\n\nShell abandons North Slope oil leases, raising questions about the industry’s future in Alaska\n\nImagine, for a moment, that you’re the head of a publicly traded oil company. In your corner office, a team of executives has come to pitch you on a new, possibly lucrative drilling opportunity. It’s in a relatively politically stable country; the local tax regime is reasonable, if not generous. Other companies have found huge […]\n\nSomething woolly is afoot in Alaska\n\nFor a journalist, it’s hard to imagine an entry on a public official’s calendar more enticing than four hours of woolly mammoth. OK, it’s not actually that hard — entries like “bribe acceptance” and “V. Putin secret meeting” would also get me pretty excited. Nonetheless, it is an understatement to say that I was prettttttty […]\n\nCould Alaska be the final destination for Japan’s carbon pollution?\n\nFor decades, Alaska shipped liquefied natural gas to Japan, which burned the fuel to generate power — and also generated ample climate-warming carbon emissions. Now, the Biden administration wants to study whether those Japanese emissions could be captured, liquefied and shipped back to Alaska. There, they’d be injected and locked away underground in Cook Inlet, […]\n\nThis oil platform stopped pumping 30 years ago. Alaska still won’t make the owner tear it down.\n\nThe Spurr oil platform stopped pumping crude from beneath the silty ocean water outside Anchorage in 1992. The platform, built in Cook Inlet during Alaska’s first oil boom in the 1960s, was losing money, officials from owner Marathon Oil wrote in a letter to the state. Oil production was expected to decline, and a review […]"
