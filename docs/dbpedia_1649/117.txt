NBC has in the works Wasteland, an hourlong limited series executive produced by Bob Cooper of Landscape Entertainment and Gina Matthews of Little Engine. Feature scribe Mick Davis, who penned the pilot and executive produced the CBS version of British sci-fi drama Eleventh Hour, is staying in the genre space with Wasteland. The supernatural crime-drama, produced by Sony TV, follows a hardened US Marshal, who in the wake of a massive prison break, is charged with hunting down fugitives with supernatural powers, while unlocking the mystery of his past. The project was originally set up as a drama series at TNT three years ago with Davis writing and Cooper and J.J. Jamieson executive producing through FremantleMedia North America. Davis, Cooper and Jamieson are back for the NBC limited series version, joined by Matthews and Sony. NBC has another miniseries in the works about people with supernatural powers, Heroes Reborn, a reboot of the 2006 superhero series, which is now casting and recently tapped Heroes alum Jack Coleman to reprise his role.
