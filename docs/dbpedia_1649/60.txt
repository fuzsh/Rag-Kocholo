Scottish legend William Wallace — portrayed by Mel Gibson in the feature Braveheart — is getting the TV biopic treatment.

STV Productions, in association with Digital Rights Group and Los Angeles-based Nine/8 Entertainment as well as Creative Media are developing Wallace, a historical drama series based on the life of the war hero, the companies announced Monday.

Mick Davis (The Eleventh Hour) will write, create and executive produce the project, which will focus on Wallace’s back story, his years spent attempting to unify Scotland, his loves and losses as well as his legendary battles with King Edward the Longshank and rival Robert the Bruce. The original idea hails from Kent Dalian and Seoras Wallace, an adviser on Braveheart.

Creative Media’s Todd Berger will exec produce alongside Andrew Trapani and Brian Gilbert of Nine/8 Entertainment; Alan Clements and Margaret Enefer will exec produce for STV Productions.

“This was a turbulent time in Scotland’s history, in which William Wallace had a starring and pivotal role,” STV director of content Clements said in a statement announcing the news. “We plan to delve deep into his character and explore his passions, bringing parts of history to life in a spectacular and raw depiction. With all eyes on Scotland in the current political climate, this also seems to be a very appropriate time to tell this story in more depth.”

The series, said to be in the vein of Starz’s Spartacus and HBO’s Game of Thrones, will be shopped next month at MIP. Creative Scotland will invest in the project through the Development Fund agreed with STV in 2011.

Creative Media and Nine/8 are repped by attorney Allison Binder; Davis is with APA and attorney Don Steele; Wallace and Dalian are with attorney Les Abel.
