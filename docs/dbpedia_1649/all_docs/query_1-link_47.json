        "text": "Mick Davis,(first year at Rhodes in 1976) head of the Jewish Leadership Council and the chair of David Cameron’s Holocaust Commission, launched last year was given a knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours. He received the honour for supporting the commission’s international engagements. The cross-party, multi-faith group was set up by the Prime Minister to investigate ways to educate future generations of Britons about the Shoah. Mr Davis, 57, said: “I was very honoured to have been given the task of leading the Commission and deeply appreciate this recognition of the work that the Commission did. But there are many others who have dedicated their lives to the commemoration of and education about the Holocaust. My contribution pales into insignificance when I think of the very brave and resourceful survivors who every day relive that horror so that this and future generations will understand and act to prevent it from happening again.” He added: “I pay tribute to the many that have promoted and funded Holocaust education and particularly research into how best to educate society on this dark, dark hour of human history when humanity was thrust into the deepest abyss of moral depravity. In particular I pay tribute to the Smith Family who set up the Holocaust Centre – Beth Shalom and the Pears Foundation who have supported it and the many other organisation who are devoted to this cause.”\n\nKaren Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said that Mr Davis has demonstrated “incredible passion, dedication and wisdom” in his role on the commission. She added: “His tireless efforts have resulted in an incredible achievement in the announcement of a national memorial and accompanying learning centre which will ensure that there is a lasting lecacy to the Holocaust in this country for generations to come. This honour is richly deserved.”"
