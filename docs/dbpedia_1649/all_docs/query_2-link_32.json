It includes four installments from the Frieza Saga: episodes 82, 83, 84, 85.\n\nCover art[]\n\nThe cover art depicts Frieza preparing to fire a Death Beam.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNamek's Destruction - Finding Goku's newfound Super Saiyan strength to be too much for him, Frieza directs his attack at the planet Namek itself! Unable to react in time, Goku is forced to watch helplessly as Frieza's energy blast tears through the heart of the once tranquil planet. Things look bleak for the mighty Saiyan and his friends as the fiery explosion rips through Namek's core! Can anyone survive such incredible destruction?\n\nA Final Attack - With only minutes to go before the planet explodes, Goku launches a ferocious assault against the weakened Frieza. But Frieza proves that he has a few tricks left up his sleeve as he begins to gather the energy he needs to achieve 100% of his true power! Meanwhile, Gohan races to bring Bulma back to Goku's spaceship as Namek crumbles around them. Can Goku defeat Frieza in time to rejoin his son and fly to safety, or is the fully energized Frieza too powerful for even the Super Saiyan to handle?\n\nApproaching Destruction - The two most powerful forces in the universe collide as the battle between Goku and Frieza rages on. Back on Earth, the seven Dragon Balls have been collected, and King Kai devises a plan that may save his friends on Namek and put an end to the evil Frieza. But with Namek's final destruction imminent, can Kame and Popo use the Dragon Balls before it's too late?\n\nGohan Returns - The first stage of King Kai's plan is complete, and all of Frieza's victims have been wished back to life. But while the people of Namek begin to rise again, the mighty Super Saiyan Goku falls as Frieza launches a devastating final assault. Sensing his father's defeat, Gohan rushes to the scene as the universe's last hope against the seemingly invincible Frieza. Can Gohan succeed where Goku failed, or will this be the end of both father and son?\n\nSite Navigation[]"
