        "text": "Don't believe people who tell you that Mick Davis, boss of London-based mining group Xstrata has been wrong-footed by the merger between Falconbridge and Inco, two of Canada's largest nickel and zinc companies.\n\nDavis had built up a 20 per cent stake in Falconbridge in the summer and was expected to bid for the rest of the shares at his leisure. So imagine the City's surprise when upstart Inco emerged from the shadows with an offer - agreed by Falconbridge in advance - to buy its Canadian competitor for £6 billion.\n\nCritics argue that Davis has lost the plot - Xstrata also failed to acquire South Africa's WMC Resources in March (its offer was trumped at the eleventh hour by BHP Billiton). Two setbacks in six months doesn't look good for a company desperate to join the giants of the global mining industry - BHP, Rio Tinto and Anglo American.\n\nBut Xstrata's position looks less desperate from where I sit. Davis has made about £250m from his company's investment in Falconbridge, so he could pocket a tidy profit. But why not sit tight with 9 per cent of the bigger Inco/Falconbridge and then bid for the combined entity a year from now.\n\nYes, it would be a chunky bite for Xstrata, but commodity prices have gone through the roof thanks to booming demand from China, so the banks will be falling over themselves to lend Davis money.\n\nThere is another option for Davis: bid for Inco, and deal with Falconbridge later. It would be a gutsy move, but what better way to deal with the interloper?\n\nAs Inco doesn't expect to complete its deal with Falconbridge until Christmas - at the earliest - Davis has time on his side. This tale is from over.\n\nWhitbread's poser\n\nWhat is the point of Whitbread? It is a question asked with increasing frequency in the City, where some investors view the company as a mini-conglomerate, ripe for a break-up. Speculation has been rife that private equity groups are circling.\n\nCritics complain that Whitbread's Premier Travel Inn hotels sit rather oddly with its TGI hamburger or Costa Coffee chains, while its pubs don't perform as well as those owned by Mitchells and Butlers.\n\nBut once you accept that no one in his right mind would today invent Whitbread and its motley collection of businesses, a more rational assessment is possible. And to date, the results are impressive.\n\nWhitbread's shares are up at nearly £10 from £7 a year ago, with new chief executive Alan Parker establishing a formidable presence in budget hotels. And along the way, as funds have rolled in from the sale of disparate assets, Parker has bowed to shareholder demands by handing back capital worth £800m.\n\nWhitbread today is worth more than £2.5bn, against £2bn when Parker took the top job 16 months ago. Yet the carping continues, which is a shame because no one believes Parker has finished redefining Whitbread; the argument is really about timing.\n\nWhitbread will shortly update the market on trading and we should get a feel of the damage from the consumer slowdown. But given Parker's track record in delivering shareholder value, investors should allow him to reshape the company in his own timeframe, rather than one demanded by hedge funds and venture capitalists. Ultimately, I expect Whitbread to look like two companies - a pubs and restaurants business on the one hand, and a hotel chain on the other.\n\nAt that point, a demerger becomes a no brainer.\n\nMack's solution\n\nSpeculation is rife on Wall Street about what John Mack's plans are for Morgan Stanley. 'Mack-the-knife', so called for his fearsome cost-cutting skills, has brought in many of his own people after being appointed chief executive in place of Philip Purcell, who left in the summer after a shareholder revolt.\n\nMorgan Stanley's third-quarter figures were miserable, with net income 83 per cent down on the third quarter of 2004 - marred in no small measure by the fall-out from the fight with Purcell, which unsettled clients.\n\nMack is no fool, and you can bet that the figures will improve as he swings the axe and bangs heads together. But what is his long-term game plan? A theory gaining ground is that Mack is preparing Morgan Stanley for a merger with a rival bank - the smart money is on Deutsche, headed by Josef Ackermann.\n\nAckermann has made no secret that he is toying with the idea of a merger outside Germany. Acquiring Morgan Stanley would take Deutsche into the most lucrative financial services market in the world and give it a formidable investment banking franchise, which it has always lacked.\n\nThere is one problem: Ackermann may not be at Deutsche for much longer. A German appeals court must decide soon if he and other former non-executives of Mannesmann should stand for a retrial over allegations that they wrongly approved controversial bonuses for the group's executive directors.\n\nBut if he survives, this is surely a deal that is staring Ackermann in the face. As for Mack, he needs to do something dramatic to lift Morgan Stanley's shares, which have languished for three years. He could do worse than selling out to the Germans."
