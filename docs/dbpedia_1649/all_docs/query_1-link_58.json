        "text": "Micheal Davis Race Human (Filler) Birthplace Houston, Texas Birthday May 30 Age 18 Gender Male Height 180cm (5'9\" ft.) Weight 190lbs Professional Status Affiliation Houston Cougars Profession Athlete\n\nCollege Student Partner Emperor Base of Operations Davis Home Personal Status Relatives Unnamed Grandmother\n\nJaylah Winter (Lover) Education University of Houston Filler Powers First Appearance Roleplay Debut HERO Series Debut Soul Revitalization Saga Voices\n\nMichael Davis (マイケル デビス, Maikeru Debisu?)[1] is a Human and student-athlete at the University of Houston who plays as the starting guard of the Houston Cougars.[2] After the attack at his home, he was granted with the ability to see ghost and became the host to the powers of Emperor.[3][4]\n\nDuring his training with Asia Jackson and her group, it is revealed that through special circumstances Michael has become a Filler.[5]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nUsually always calm, Michael is mostly known for having more of a focused expression on his face.[1] This is due to his personality and the activities he partakes in every day of his life. As far as general body build goes, Michael is six foot three inches of pure muscle due to his athletic training from Dianna.[6]\n\nMichael has beautiful brown skin parallel to that of a chocolate candy bar.[6][1] This is due to his african decent, as he's an African American by classification. He wears a variation of a mohawk, which is spiked in the middle and cut into a low fade on the sides. Unlike many Americans, Michael has a very sharp-chinned head, resembling the letter \"V\". Two of the spikes from his hair fall over his face like a bang, coming right down the middle of his face splitting his two eyes from each other. Naturally, Michael was born with sparkling gold eyes.[1]\n\nDuring his introduction, Michael's clothing is first seen as very lazy attire.[1] However, once one finds out what he does, it's clear that this is more athletic-like than it is lazy. The outfit consists of a gray zip-up hoodie with a stripe along the sleeves, a pair of sweatpants to match to match the hoodie and some gray sneakers.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMichael is rather cool, clam, and collected being able to hold his emotions and expressions in tact without acting solely off impulse. For as long as he has been alive he is noted for being this way and even nonchalant when matters are meant to be serious.[1] At times people consider him selfish, often choosing himself over others on more than one occassion. However, this is because Michael simply tries looking for the best way to make himself better rather than the others around him because he is unaware how they'll go forward. He is far from arrogant, yet far from humble at the same time, driving himself to be the best while also letting others know he is the best. He believes that one should always think of themsleves as the best and never let anyone take advantage of them at their lowest point.[1]\n\nWhile he may not posses a strong relationship with all of his family, Michael is very close with his grandmother who has seemed to have been his caretaker for quite some time.[7] This is due to the black eye his family gave him growing up, labeling him as someone who would follow in the wrong footsteps pretty much become what is known as the \"Black Sheep\" of his family. He has gone to the absolute extreme to protect his grandmother, even sacrificing himself just so that he could get Emperor to free her being.[7]\n\nAbove all other characters of the cast, Michael is the most realistic as far as his overview of the Hollows and people with powers are concerned. He compares the whole situation to a modern day manga or anime.[8] Because of this, following the incident in New York, Michael sought it to be his main priority to watch every bit of anime he could in an attempt to find clues regarding what happened.[1]\n\nMichael's heart truly lies with his love for basketball.[2] He does his researched of the sport on and off the court so much so that it leaves him tired out. He doesn't seem to keep up with the professional league often, stating that his own path matters more than those who have already reached the pros.[1] For him, his only dream is the play basketball and has worked day in and day out in order to perfect his craft to the level he is now to ensure he is noticed by the scouts of the big league. This is further backed by the fact that despite suffering from a broken hand, he still chose to play in the New York tournament.[9] He considers every one of his teammates as family even though he barely knows them.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFriends[]\n\nJaylah Winter[]\n\nDianna Smith[]\n\nZerafin Vilarroig[]\n\nAsia Jackson[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nSoul Revitilization Saga[]\n\nOnce in a Blue Moon Arc[]\n\nMain article: Once in a Blue Moon\n\nMichael is sitting on the team bus, returning back to the hotel after a tournament game in New York City that has taken place for the NCAA. He's accompanied by the team trainer who is stuffing her phone in his face regarding the post game show between Sasaki Kuchiki and Stephen A. Smith over the topic that is Stephen Curry and Lebron James.[1] He quickly mentions to Dianna that he has absolutely no interest in these such topics, before quickly mentioning that Stephen Curry is seemingly the Lebron of this NBA season. As their ride continues, they voth get a notification to their phone telling them the next team the Cougars will be playing, Oregan State, and they both note how it'll be a difficult game to play due to the taller one and two guards on the team.[2]\n\nTheir ride continues on for about another hour and with half of the players end up falling asleep on the bus leaving only Michael awake.[2] Suddenly, there is a loud thud at the front of the bus which sends its back wheels up into the air. Initially, no one on the bus can see what is going on, but as Michael lifts his head he can see there is a Hollow standing on the front. Quickly, he tries to warn the driver to step back on the bus but the Hollow releases its spiritual pressure on everyone on the bus and knocks them out.[10] After noticing he is the only one to have survived the Hollow's pressure, Michael instantly makes a break for it while pulling out his pistol and firing at the Hollow until he had fully run out of bullets and simply tries to run from the creature all while trying to process what had been happening. [11]\n\nWithout much to fight against the Hollow with, he notices that running along the long road would do nothing beneifical for him and decides to fight against the Hollow. Michael turns around and runs towards the Hollow, catching it by surprise, and sending a punch with all of his might into its face sending it sliding back against the ground.[12] Unbeknownst to him, Hollows have strong exteriors and because of how much force he placed into the punch in an attempt to knock it out completely, Michael ends up breaking a few of his fingers in the process. With this in mind the Hollow attempts to attack and take Michael's legs out, to which he immediately dodges by jumping into the air but loses control over his body. He finds himself struck in his side and sent flying into a nearby construct where he then suffered from fractured damage to his ribcage.[13]\n\nNow unable to move, Michael accepts that this is the end as the Hollow towers over him with his next attack ready to pierce take off his leg. Though, just before the strike could be done fully, a person clad in silver and red armor appears before Michael, blocking the Hollows strike while commending him for his bravery and ability to hold the Hollow off for as long as he did.[14][10]\n\nPULLING SOUL Arc[]\n\nMain article: PULLING SOUL\n\nAfter the events that transpired in New York City, Michael returns home and is placed on a rest for the remainder of the summer due to his broken hand. He first appears within his room, playing a video game alongside his friends who ask him if he'd be willing to go out for a night of fun due to their friend having a party at a night club.[9] Accepting the offer, Michael pulls himself away from the game and begins gathering his clothing for a quick shower while listening to music. He makes his way into the shower, resting underneath the mouth of the shower head to allow the water to cleanse his body along with the soap. As he hummed tunes to himself, he began to experience sudden flashes from the Hollow attack in New York which leave him gasping for air.[15] The flash trigger the pain in his ribs which forces him to exit the shower and rush over to the counter where he looked to himself in the mirror. Rubbing the flash as nothing more than his paranoia, Michael continues getting ready, by cleaning himself up further. After he exits the restroom, Michael gets a call from his father who makes an attempt at small talk, asking Michael about the current state of his basketball career and other things he expresses he isn't interested in sharing with him. They end their phone call with respective I love yous and shortly after Michael departs from his home and jumps into his vehicle.[16]\n\nIn his car sitting at the stop sign at the corner of his home, Michael flips through a phone songs on his phone to make the car ride more enjoyable. For some reason the song he had chosen to play this time hit his soul on an emotional level to the point he had to sit right where he was and sing out some of the lyrics to himself.[17] While in the middle of singing the song Michael feels a tingling sensation throughout his body which causes him to pause the music in pursuit of what was taking place. In that same moment, an explosion happened from within his house which caused him to immediately disembark from his vehicle running into his home. As he fights his way through the smoke from the explosion he discovers his grandmother being held up in the air by a Hollow.[18]\n\nWithout a moments of hesitation, Michael draws out his Glock 19 and points it at the Hollow and lets off a few shots demanding that he releases his grandmother.[19][18] The bullets are enough to agitate the Hollow to the point that he releases Michael's grandmother by throwing her up against the wall.[18] He acknowledges the fact that Michael's spiritual pressure farly exceeds hers and chooses to point him as his target. The two engage in a what could be considered a battle for a few minutes before the Hollow lands a blow that forces Michael down a trip to memory lane. It is here he sees the hollow from New York once again and refers to all of the anime he watched in order to get a better understanding of the creatures he had been facing against.[8] The Hollow laughs at the thought that Michael could even try to understand what he is and decides that it would be best if he just goes after his grandmother and gets her out of the way. Michael musters up all the strength he has in his damaged state and punches the Hollow right in his mask causing it to crack even more than what it already was.[20]\n\nThe Hollow declares Michael as different stating he has chosen not to kill him. He reveals his name to Michael claiming to be Emperor and reveals that with his special ability he can take over the bodies of others.[21] Emperor jumps onto Michael in the form of a white substance and begans to cover him in it to take over his form which leaves Michael on his knees in a futile attempt to fight back. All while this is going on two masked Shinigami appear to watch as the transformation unfolds. Asuma, one of the shinigami, asks his superior if they should aid Michael to which the opposing Shinigami quickly retorts that matters of the Human World does not fall under their duty. Instead, they tell Asume that the phenom occuring is much more worth watching that stopping it from taking place.[3] Emperor and Michael havve an internal battle with one another, Michael refusing to give his body over to Emperor while Emperor states that he doesn't have the will to fend him off properly.[22]\n\nAfter a few minutes the process of Emperor taking over Michael's body completes. Asuma and his superior conclude that Michael himself had completely transformed into a Hollow, something they had never seen before.[23] As Emperor, he notices the two Shinigami and claims that they will be the next souls he takes for himself. The white-cloaked Shinigami dodges an attack from Emperor noting that for some reason Michael is still within the body, causing him to hesitate in outright destroying Emperor. He instead activates a Kido spell that traps Emperor within its center.[24] He goes on to explain the effects of the barrier and the danger he'll put himself in if he chooses to attack. Emperor demands to be let out to which the Shinigami provides an alternative in the form of him taking a pill he drops into the barrier.[25] After taking the pill, Emperor's body begins to bloat with negative effects to the pill which sends him into a frenzy. The Shinigami claims that the reason the pill had this effect was because Michael still laid domrmant within his soul.\n\nThis oppurtinity gives Michael the window he needs in order to meet with Emperor in his mental plain where they get into yet another scuffle.[26] Because his body and mind are working against him, Emperor loses the battle to Michael who manages to take control over his body once again. Emperor cries out questioning himself as to why Michael is so persistant before the final blow is delivered to take him out completely and allow Michael to transform back into his original state. Asuma removes the barrier from around Michael revealing him to be in a weakened state to the point he can't even stand to his feet and passes out.[27] Just before passing out he notes the existance of the two Shinigami to which the cloaked Shinigami makes an important mention of his increase in spritual pressure.[28]\n\nThe next morning Michael wakes up and notices that all the damage done to his house was no more and that his wounds had completely healed.[29] He senses his grandmother's spiritual pressure and takes note that she is perfectly fine. Before being able to get his day started the way he intended, he recieves a phone call from Dianna--the team's trainer--stating that he needed to come down to the school for his practice now that the season was slowly approaching.\n\nOn his way back home from his first practice, he encounters a Hollow who is chasing a girl in the streets of South East Houston.[30] Michael, taking the same route to get home, swerves off the road as he notices the Hollow chasing the girl nearly crashing his vehicle to avoid the two. Assessing the situation for what it was, Michael jumps out of his car in the middle of the street and draws his Glock 19 aiming it at Webber as he stood between the Plus and the Hollow in an attempt to protect her.[31] Webber invites Michael to join his web, to which he demands that Webber return back to the hole she crawled out of only to find himself attacked. He makes a judgement to remain standing between the Plus and Webber where he was forced to defend against the Hollow's attack. He noticed that the damage he took from Webber's attack hadn't hurt him as much as he thought it would and tells her to run and hide.[32]\n\nIt is here that Webber decides to attack Michael with the aforementioned web she spoke of previously, seeking to entrap him and limit his movements. In an attempt to outrun the web, Michael preforms an evasive action whilst mentioning that fact that his ability to sense things has increased significantly.[33] Due to their different in power, Michael finds himself in mid-air where he remembers his lack of body control while off of the ground and finds himself trapped in Webber's web. With his trapped Webber asks the question of why is his reiatsu similiar to hers (a Hollow) to which Michael states has no idea what it is she is even referring to.[34] Emperor awakens himself within Michael's physche and tells him that she's referring to himself and Webber. Due to his new appearance, Michael has absolutely no idea who Emperor is and questions his being.\n\nWebber takes note that Emperor appearantly failed in taking over a human and decides that she would be the one to eat him herself.[35] Before she can go through with her plan, she is intercepted by Tsubame Zirconia, who orders Michael to stand back while she takes care of things. In the moment of shock, Michael asks who she is once again and deems that her name is something made up from an anime he has watched.[36] Webber and Tsubame engage in their battle, though due to the presence of Michael, Tsubame orders him to get away. He declines her offer stating that he feels a bit different than normal, referring her back to the moment she appeared yet remained with his life still in tact. After a few more exchanges with Webber, Tsubame allows Michael to aid her as she releases her spiritual pressure over Webber. However, by doing so, she set off some sort of trigger which awakened Emperor inside of him. Emperor claims that he needs to be let out to exterminate the person behind the spiritual pressure and forces himself to take over Michael's body where he appeared in the physical world.[37]\n\nAll while this is going on, Michael once again engages in an internal battle with himself. Though unlike last time where he fought with Emperor, there was no sign of him. Meanwhile, on the outside Emperor declares that Tsubame was his reasoning for being summoned.[38] Emperor engages in combat with Tsubame just after eating a bat-like Hollow and the Plus that Michael fought to save. He mentions that had he not materlized he wouldn't have been able to maintain his Adjuchas evolution before continuing his battle with Tsubame, revealing his ability to launch Ceros.[39] Michael, while in his mental state, notices the Plus and a Hollow to which he defeats the Hollow in an attempt to save the girl. The Plus shows great fear in Michael and runs off before her being withers off from existance.[40]\n\nThe battle on the outside concludes as Tsubame learns that her Seele Schneider has an effect which forces Emperor into a severely weakened state enough for Michael to force his way into control much easier returning him back to the real world.[41] Upon returning, Michael asks Tsubame a flurry of questions. One of which is in regards to the whereabouts of the Plus he fought to save. Tsubame reveals that the Plus was eaten by Emperor which puts Michael into a state of seemingly sadness.[42] He pops his hood over his head and drives off from the scene, asking himself many questions and hoping if he gets stronger would things be much more simpler. The only people he seeks to find are the two Shinigami who appeared that night.\n\nHeart and Soul Arc[]\n\nMain article: Heart and Soul\n\nA few days following the meeting of Tsubame, Michael is taken outo dinner by Dianna who can seemingly sense there is something wrong with Michael.[43] Michael finds himself scrolling through a reddit page where he seeks for more answers regarding everything. The two have a small discussion where Dianna opens up and tells Michael that he can speak with her about anything if it is neccessary.[44] The two begins to eat their food when they are approached by Asia Jackson who introduces herself as a student of the University of Houston and attempts to flirt with Michael before giving him her phone number.[45] Michael offers to take Dianna home after she reveals that she would be taking a Uber back rather than driving.\n\nWhile on the road to Pearland, where Dianna lives, Michael finds himself drowsy on the ride and decides to turn on music in an attempt to keep himself up. It is at this moment that he gets a visit from Emperor, the Hollow who lives within him, for a conversation.[46] Within his subconcious the two banter back and forth about petty politics. Emperor claims that Michael has gotten more confident over the recent months even being able to lock him behind a gate that keeps him concealed. Then, Michael reveals that Emperor hasn't reached out to him for quite some time to which Emperor gives a quick explanation as to why and tells Michael not to flatter himself.[47] He reveals the real reason who even decided to speak was because he could sense Hollows nearby. Just as warned, Michael's car is slammed into by one of the Hollows side swipping it into a way causing Dianna to fall unconcious.[48][47]\n\nThe Hollows pull Michael from the car and begin to attack. He mentions that htese Hollows are much stronger than anything he had faced before, as Emperor warned, and decided he wouldn't be able to take htem on. Emperor offers Michael a way to defeat them by allowing him to take over. Begrudgily, Michael agress and allows Emperor to come out though something happens during his attempt to take him over where their two bodies mix with one side being Michael and the other being Emperor.[49] The two Hollows present appear in shock as Michael transforms into a Hollow and begins to attack them. Emperor then devours one of the Hollows, taking his soul within his own body before finding himself attacked by the other Hollow.[50]\n\nEmperor notes that due to the mismatch and shape of his body, he can't preform to the best of his abilities. As such, he finds himself attacked by an enraged Hollow who takes advantage of Emperor's lack of awareness and pierces directly through his chest before falling to the ground.[51] Back within the subconcious once again, Michael blames Emperor's lack of strength for the situation they were put in which leads the two to yet another argument. While this is going on, the Hollow stands over Michael's body in preparation to finish him when the Knight from New York suddenly appears and defeats the Hollow in a single attack. In a state of shock, Michael finds himself in a blind of confusion as the Knight lifts him up and remove its mask revealing to be Dianna herself.[52]\n\nAfter Michael is saved his body returns to normal as the reamining Hollow's remains are absorbed into his own. The two have a long journey back to Dianna's house where they discuss everything regarding what has led up to this day.[53] She reveals the reason she wanted to keep everything quiet to which Michael swiftly understands. Dianna then reveals the name of her ability being Fullbring whist also explaining not knowing much about it and being unable to share more as she would have wanted.[54] With his car messed up, Dianna offers him a ride home but he declines stating he has a way to get home and instead calls up an Uber.\n\nWhen his Uber arrives, Michael is left in shock yet again once he realizes that the driver is none other than Asia, the girl from Chachos who had given him his number.[55] Freaked out by the fact that this girl became his driver, Michael declares that she's a creep and attempts to step out of the car only for Asia to immediately calm him down. She tells Michael she is much more special then she thinks he is and then drives him an hour away from Houston to a house in Katy.[56] Here Michael is formerly introduced to Asia, Sam, and Zerafin Vilarroig. Sam heals Michael's wounds and while this is going on, Asia explains everything about his previous situations and offers him a way to deal with it. She gives him twenty four hours to make the decision before sending him back home.[57][58]\n\nAfter deciding this is the best course of action since he hadn't been able to contact Emperor anymore, Michael returns back to Asia lab willing to accept her help. It is then she begins to explain to Michael exactly what a Fullbringer is and even goes on to tell him his power is similiar except is universally refered to as being a Filler.[5] Michael goes through a series of training regiments that lasts for about a month where intiially he proved to struggle in obtaining his powers with Zerafin as his teacher. However, after pushing himself ot his limits and beating his mental block he finds a away to overcome those trials and hardships and figures out how to manifest his powers.[59]\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST Arc[]\n\nMain article: FIRST THINGS FIRST\n\nHunting Holes Arc[]\n\nMain article: Hunting Holes\n\nHOUSE PARTY Arc[]\n\nMain article: HOUSE PARTY\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nInnate Abilities[]\n\nHigh Spiritual Power: Michael possesses quite a bit of spiritual energy.[60] After virtually being turned into a Hollow and back into a Human, the cloaked Shinigami notes that Michael's spiritual power took a drastic increase, saying that it spiked to a level well beyond what he originally possessed.[28] Once he and Emperor joined together into a single soul, Michael's spiritual power increased as well as the rest of his innate abilities. Due to the ranking of Emperor as an Adjuchas leveled Menos, Michael also has the ability to devour souls.\n\nEnhanced Strength: For a human, Michael possesses great strength. With a might swing from his fist using everything within him, Michael was able to slightly push a Hollow of Adjuchas rank back a few feet before the creature regained its stance and retaliated with his own attack.[12] His strength is augmented by the weightlifting and other physical training he has undergone as an athlete.[61]\n\nEnhanced Speed: Thanks to his insane athletic training since he was a child, Michael possess great speed through the various regiments he has been through via the many coaches over the course of his life.[61] As the one guard of the Cougars, Michael deals with handling the ball the most and has chosen to work primarily on his speed to execute all of his moves. Over years of molding his skills Michael is considered the fast of all his teammates clocking in at a 4.22 second 40-yard dash time.\n\nEnhanced Durability: Despite being so young, Michael possesses quite a durable figure thanks to his atheletic training. Unintentionally, his body has been conditioned to the point where he can take full on strikes from Adjuchas ranked Hollows while only suffering from a few fractured ribs.[61] After his training with Asia and Zerafin and becoming more intune with his Filler powers, Michael grew to be much more durable in that he can take attacks from the power of an Arrancar so long as he remains focus on his regeneration ability.[62]\n\nSpiritual Awareness: On a journey back to the hotel rooms, Michael discovered his ability to sense spiritual beings after a Hollow landed on his team bus.[10] After this incident, Michael's spiritual awareness has increased to the point where he can now see Pulses consistantly and even since the reiatsu of everyone around him.[4] The distance at which these pressures can be felt has also increased to quite the range, seemingly being able to sense anything within a mile range. After becoming one with Emperor, Michael when switched, can distinguish the different types of reiatsu between being high-spec humans, that of Quincy, that of Souls, and that of Hollows.\n\nHollow Powers[]\n\nHollow Transformation: Due to the unique nature of Emperor, who possessed the ability to take over the bodies of his target, Michael was able to fight off Emperor and lock him into his own soul granting him the ability to seemingly transform into a Hollow. He has no control over his ability to transform.[63] Because his soul lives with Emperor's, they both shares the same body as well as mental plain where Michael has conversations with him. While in this transformed state, Michael has all of Emperor's abilities as well as his enhanced strength, speed, durability, and endurance to help aid him in battles.[28]\n\nAcidic Touch: As a Human with Hollow-like abilities, Michael has access to their ability of acidic touch as well. Normally, this ability can only be used by Hollows on other Humans where when they make contact they can leave a agitating burn mark on their skin. This is because of their reiryoku seeps through the pours the cause the pain.[64] Though, because Michael has effectively taken up his Human form again, this ability seems to also work on Hollows as well and has been why his strength has heightened to the point of being able to crack Hollow masks.[62]\n\nHigh-Speed Regeneration: As indicated by Asia and even seen on multiple occassions, Michael has access to high-speed regeneration which allows him to recover from his wounds much faster than normal.[62] Despite being completely impaled by a Hollow, Michael was able to regenerate his wounds during a simple conversation. Asia and Zerafin both reveal that Michael is unable to preform his regeneration if he isn't focused.[65]\n\nFill[]\n\nAs a Filler, Michael can utilize all Hollow abilities without the need of having Emperor take control of his body and force a transformation.[5] Fillers are those who have turned into Hollows and managed to revert back into their Human self through unknown means. Each Filler has an ability that is exclusive to them, but it seems as though Michael has yet to awaken his and instead has harmonized all of the Hollow's basic techniques. He has been bestowed with enhanced speed and strength well beyond what his mortal body would allow through regular means.[28] After his training with Zerafin Vilarroig, Michael developed three new techniques that have been used to deal with Hollows with relative ease.\n\nBody Flicker: With his Fill, Michael can more three times as fast as he could before by utilizing his Body Flicker technique.[66] He moves so fast that he was even able to catch Zerafin, a seasoned combatant, off guard with his swift movements and get the upper hand for a surprise attack. While the technique was supposed to be modeled after the Arrancar's own Sonido, it is later revealed through Asia's analysis that this is far from the case. The techniques works by emitting bursts spiritual pressure around his body to push himself forward so fast that his body appears to simply flicker, hence the name.[66][67]\n\nDark Pulse: Much like a Cero, though different in essence and the fact that it combines his own spirit energy and his Hollow energy into one, Michael can fire off a concentrated beam of energy. This technique is executed by first cupping his hands together and in front of himself. A black and purple-tinted gathering of energy will form in the center where he then pulls his hands, along with the energy, to his side and focuses on forming it even further until it takes the shape of a sphere. Then, by thrusting forward, he releases all of that energy towards a target.[59]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMichael's images were all paid commissions.\n\nFunnily enough, Michael shares the same image source as another one of the author's characters on another wikia named \"Dragon D. Dexter\". However, the images used on Dexter were originally intended for the Bleach series.\n\nMichael shares the same name as his author. Funnily enough, the author goes under the alias User:EmperorSigma which happens to also be the name of the Hollow, Emperor, who took over his body and is using him as the host for his own being.\n\nSpirit Points System[]\n\nTotal Reputations Points Claimed: 0\n\nTotal Reputation Points spent: 0"
