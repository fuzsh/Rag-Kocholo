        "text": "International TV trade magazine VideoAge has been the bread and butter of international television since 1981. In 1982, VideoAge introduced the concept of dailies at TV and film markets, and currently — in addition to its monthly editions — publishes Dailies at NATPE, MIPTV, and MIPCOM.\n\nTo us at VideoAge, television is more than an industry; it is a universe of stars (vice-presidents) superstars (CEOs) and quasars (chairmen) from the world of politics, regulations, sociology, psychology, finances, production, distribution, ratings, broadcasting, cablecasting, satellite, piracy, and new technology. It's our goal at VideoAge to make complex new technological topics digestible to non-geeks and rich technophobes. VideoAge also offers the now famous my2¢, book reviews, company profiles, previews and reports of trade shows, festivals and conferences around the globe.\n\nAnd it's all been available to all on the Web at the click of a mouse since 1997.\n\nThank you for your continued patronage."
