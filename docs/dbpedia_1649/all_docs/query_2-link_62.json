        "text": "ABOUT\n\nMakayla McKibben is a worship leader, songwriter, executive producer, and co-founder of Eleventh Hour Worship. Originally from Ohio, she moved to Chattanooga, TN with her family at age 10, and began leading worship at age 13. Her first experience with leading was in her youth band, and from there her passion for worship and this generation was cultivated. Her desire to see students grasp what it really means to follow Jesus is at the heart of her ministry.\n\nMakayla’s freedom in worship comes from a place of genuine intimacy with The Father. Her heart is to see intimacy through worship become a defining characteristic of this generation.\n\nCheck out Makayla’s full testimony below."
