        "text": "Michael Davis, bass player with US rock band MC5, has died of liver failure aged 68, his wife has announced.\n\nDavis died at Enloe Medical Center in Chico, California, on Friday following a month of treatment for liver disease, said Angela Davis.\n\nHe was part of the MC5 line-up who rose to prominence with their blistering sound, epitomised by the 1969 track Kick Out the Jams.\n\nLed by singer Rob Tyner, MC5 are widely regarded as pioneers of US punk rock.\n\nBorn on 5 June 1943, Davis replaced original bassist Pat Burrows when Tyner and lead guitarist Wayne Kramer decided they liked his style.\n\nHe went on to play on the Detroit band's debut album Kick Out The Jams, the title track with its inflammatory opening statement of intent going on to be one of their best known songs."
