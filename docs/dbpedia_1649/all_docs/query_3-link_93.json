practitioner’s registration that he cannot enter into any building contracts and/or be nominated as the builder on any building permits relating to the construction of swimming pools and/or safety

safety barrier (the Marungi Building Work), the practitioner contravened section 16(1) of the Building Act 1993 (the Act) in that he carried out aspects of the Marungi Building Work, namely excavation

date: 12 April 2019\n\nProject site location: Craigieburn\n\nDisciplinary action taken\n\nGround 1: A reprimand, a $6000 penalty, the requirement to complete a recognised training course, and the

the VBA of having completed the recognised training course.\n\nGround 2: A reprimand, a $9000 penalty, the requirement to complete a recognised training course, and the imposition of a condition on the building practitioner’s registration preventing him from issuing any new building permits for swimming pools, spas and/or safety barriers until he provides evidence to the VBA of having completed the recognised training course.\n\nSummary of grounds\n\nGround 1: The first ground was substantiated under s.179(1)(a) of the Building Act 1993 in that the building practitioner contravened s.24(1)(a) of the Act by issuing a building permit when he could not have been satisfied that the building work would comply with the Act or the Regulations. Specifically, it was found that the building permit and accompanying documents contained insufficient technical information about the construction of the swimming pool and safety barrier, and how they would, once constructed, comply with the Act and the Regulations. Neither was there any evidence before the building practitioner when issuing the building permit that the report and consent of the appropriate authority had been obtained to construct the pool safety barrier over an easement.\n\nGround 2: The second ground was substantiated under s.179(1)(b) of the Act in that the building practitioner had engaged in unprofessional conduct. Specifically, it was found that he: had led the building site owners to falsely believe he would reverse his cancellation of their building permit as part of a deliberate, and ultimately successful, ploy to deter them from exercising their appeal rights to the Building Appeals Board until they were out of time to do so; later provided false information to the owners about his role as relevant building surveyor having ceased when he knew this to be incorrect; and had continuously disregarded his responsibilities as the relevant building surveyor by failing to take enforcement action in respect of non-compliant building work and/or by failing to issue a certificate of final inspection.\n\nRegistration:\n\nDB-M 18524 / Domestic Builder (Manager)\n\nDB-U 59555 / Domestic Builder (Unlimited)\n\nDisciplinary proceeding: VBA show cause process\n\nDecision date: 25 March 2019\n\nProject site location: Bayswater\n\nDisciplinary action taken\n\nGrounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6:\n\nAgainst registration DB-M 18524:\n\nReprimand;
