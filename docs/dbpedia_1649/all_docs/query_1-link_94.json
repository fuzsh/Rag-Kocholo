        "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Take One: Windy, physical practice #12\n\nAnother day for the Saints, another full-padded workout. That’s now seven so far in the practices they’ve had here in Irvine.\n\nOn Wednesday, the wind was the strongest it had been all camp. Plus, the team added in crowd noise to a few of the team periods for the first time. They also had another red zone session.\n\nDennis Allen said afterward that the team started sluggish but finished stronger.\n\nTake Two: Carr connects with Cedrick Wilson\n\nThere are some signs that Derek Carr is getting more comfortable with Cedrick Wilson. On Wednesday, they connected three times. Their first came on a deep over off a play action to Alvin Kamara. Carr fired a strike to Wilson for a big gain.\n\nDuring the second team period, Carr found Wilson down the sideline on a 9-route for another big gain. Wilson did a nice job of getting his feet down. In the red zone period, Carr found Wilson again on a curl inside the five.\n\nWilson’s emergence is an important development in the wide receiver room. There are questions about who can be the guy behind Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed. Wilson is a savvy veteran who is not afraid to block. Right now, I’d put him in the lead for WR3.\n\nTake Three: Top Plays\n\n1vs 1\n\nKool-Aid McKinstry got his first interception of camp when he wrestled the ball away from Stanley Morgan, Jr. in the back of the end zone.\n\nMany receivers have been running this short out & up type fade route during this period. Wilson and Sampson Nacua both caught touchdowns running this route. Nacua went high to bring down his catch from Carr.\n\nThe defense closed out the period on top with a PBU in the end zone. The offense had to do pushups.\n\n7vs7\n\nA.T. Perry caught two dig routes during this period from Jake Haener and Spencer Rattler.\n\nTeam #1\n\nJack Heflin batted a Haener’s pass at the line of scrimmage.\n\nJames Robinson had a nice run up the middle for a solid gain.\n\nTeam #2\n\nCam Jordan got in the backfield quickly to shut down Kamara for a loss.\n\nD’Marco Jackson stuffed Jamaal Williams for a loss on a run.\n\nChase Young beat Oli Udoh on a pressure to force Carr to step up in the pocket. Payton Turner was there for the sack.\n\nHeaner found Perry on a corner route for a 20 yard gain.\n\nMike Ross sacked Rattler on a bootleg.\n\nTeam #3 (red zone)\n\nYoung had another pressure on Carr that may have caused a sack.\n\nTaysom Hill scored a touchdown on a fullback dive.\n\nHaener found Perry in the end zone for a score. Perry ran a nice route.\n\nRattler closed out the period with a touchdown throw to Dallin Holker on an out route.\n\nDevelopmental Period\n\nMichael Jacobsen made one of the catches of camp on a throw from Rattler. The pair connected again on a bootleg.\n\nTake Four: Attendance Report\n\nHaener was back at work after his skin cancer procedure. Mason Tipton left practice with a hamstring injury.\n\nPaulson Adebo, Demario Davis, Pete Werner, Marshon Lattimore, Rashid Shaheed, Nick Saldiveri, Kendre Miller, Equaminious St. Brown and Jaylan Ford all missed practice.\n\nJuwan Johnson remains on PUP.\n\nTake Five: Other Observations\n\nLot of buzz about safety Justin Simmons visiting the Saints. If they can work out a contract that benefits both sides, the Saints should absolutely do it. The safety rotation opposite of Tyrann Mathieu has been pretty fluid, but no one has really emerged as that guy. Allen said as much after practice.\n\nThis defensive end group is finally living up to their billing in camp. Hopefully, it translates when it counts.\n\nOne more practice Thursday before the Saints have their first preseason game Saturday. It’s been a very physical camp ,and this team is ready to hit someone else.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.
