        "text": "Post by ukelelehip on\n\nHow exciting for Rufus! When will this shoot? I wonder if pilot season has moved up a little (the writers' strike messed a lot of things up tv land).\n\nSewell clocks in for 'Hour'\n\nBy Nellie Andreeva\n\nFeb 22, 2008\n\nBritish actor Rufus Sewell is set as the lead in Jerry Bruckheimer's new CBS drama project \"Eleventh Hour.\"\n\nThe project, based on the British limited sci-fi series, centers on Jacob Hood (Sewell), a special science adviser to the government who, with his feisty female bodyguard in tow, saves people from the worst abuses of science.\n\nIn the original series, the role was played by Patrick Stewart.\n\nFeature writer-director Mick Davis penned the script for the American version, which is set in the U.S.\n\n\"CSI\" executive producer Danny Cannon, who directed the pilot for \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" and is credited with creating the hit franchise's distinct look, will direct the pilot.\n\nDavis, Cannon, Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman and a Granada exec are exec producing for Jerry Bruckheimer TV, Granada International Media and Warner Bros. TV.\n\nSewell (\"The Holiday,\" \"The Illusionist\") next appears in the HBO miniseries \"John Adams,\" in which he plays Alexander Hamilton.\n\nPost by maxx02 on\n\nCongratulations to Rufus on the pilot.\n\nNot to be a wet blanket but a very small number of them actually get picked up and last past the first year even if they are terrific. The American television audience has quixotic taste at times...\n\nI'd feel better if it was on cable.\n\nPost by sevensisters on\n\nWhat terrific news! Something to look forward to! So, this is a sure thing, at least for a season? It's not just a pilot that may never make it, as the \"Taste\" pilot was? (I'm joining Maxx as part of the wet blanket crowd here. )\n\nPost by maxx02 on\n\ngreeneyestoo said:\n\nVanessa Marcil is suggested as a possible co-star, here: www.aintitcool.com/node/35705\n\nI've not seen her in anything - is she good?\n\nHehe... I think that's just the boys at aintitcool goofing around, but she's sure feisty, I'll give her that. Actually I like her quiet a lot but she's a tiny thing and I'm trying to imagine, no matter how feisty she is, how silly it would look for her to be Rufus' bodyguard. She'd sure add some color and energy though.\n\nAmerican Network television isn't really my forte. So many of the actresses look like they were stamped out of a mold and they might fall over from exhaustion/starvation. They're more or less interchangeable.\n\nHow about Peta Wilson? I've always liked her and it would be fun to watch her protect Rufus. At least she looks like she can do the job. And remember this AMERICAN tee vee, at some point there is going to have to be a budding romance between them..."
