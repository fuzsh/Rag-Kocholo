        "text": "[July 1, 2024 – London] Sony Pictures Television (“SPT”) has today announced that it has increased the investment it made in 2018 to take a majority stake in Eleventh Hour Films (“EHF”). The investment will see EHF become the fourth majority-owned, UK-based scripted drama company in the SPT International Production group, alongside Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\nThis announcement caps a busy period of success for the boutique production outfit, following a slew of commissions and recommissions. The investment will spur the next phase of the company’s strategic growth, deepening its collaborative ties with SPT and consolidating the company’s reputation for producing must-see, high-end television shows with range and reach, for a worldwide market.\n\nThe majority stake investment in EHF is part of SPT’s strategy of consolidating the international production group’s portfolio as a world-leading scripted studio and growing IP in recent years.\n\n“Over the past decade, Jill, Eve, and Paula have built a remarkable company and it has been a great joy for everyone at Sony to have been part of their adventure”, says Wayne Garvie, President, International Production, Sony Pictures Television. “Starting with Alex Rider and right through to Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue, we’ve witnessed first-hand their ability for consistently delivering high-quality, commercial event television with global appeal. We are overjoyed that they are becoming a full member of our roster of world-leading drama labels. Their development pipeline suggests that the next few years are going to be even more remarkable, and Sony Pictures Television will be a proud partner.”\n\nEstablished in 2010, EHF is an independent scripted production company that has produced some of the most popular drama of the last decade, both in the UK and internationally. Credits include the critically acclaimed ‘Magpie Murders’ and upcoming sequel ‘Moonflower Murders’, starring Lesley Manville for PBS Masterpiece and the BBC; a reimagining of the ‘Rebus’ crime detective novels starring Richard Rankin for the BBC; the propulsive ‘popcorn’ thriller ‘The Killing Kind’ for Paramount + UK and recently launched on Hulu; and three seasons of the globally successful spy series ‘Alex Rider’ which airs in over 100 territories worldwide, based on the huge book franchise.\n\nBuilding on these successes, Jill Green, who founded the company in 2010 will move from her role as Chief Executive Officer to provide strategic support to the management team and to exec produce on a number of bespoke dramas, including leading on those written by Anthony Horowitz, whilst remaining as Chairperson.\n\n‘Magpie Murders’, ‘Moonflower Murders’, and the ‘Alex Rider’ series were all adaptations of novels by Anthony Horowitz, and are the result of an ongoing collaboration between EHF and the award-winning novelist and screen writer, which also includes the upcoming original mystery thriller ‘Nine Bodies In A Mexican Morgue’, for MGM+ and the BBC.\n\nAligned with this is the promotion of Eve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy who will now lead EHF through its next phase of growth as Co-CEOs. As long-standing members of the senior creative team at EHF, Eve and Paula have been behind some of the company’s most significant successes and contributed to its growth. As Head of Talent and Executive Producer, Eve has overseen productions such as the ‘Alex Rider’ series from commission through to delivery and has worked to match-make the company's projects with the very best global talent.\n\nAs Creative Director, Paula has led the company's ambition to expand its content and work with the very best writers, originating and developing a variety of commercial content taking it to commission and serving as an executive producer.\n\nJill Green, Chairperson, Eleventh Hour Films, says, “Eve, Paula and I have been a tight team working together on an amazing EHF journey. Now with the full support of Sony Pictures Television and a strong senior team restructure, I have every confidence that an equally brilliant future lies ahead.”\n\nEve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy, Co-CEOs, Eleventh Hour Films, say, “Together with Jill we have developed and produced a raft of shows we are incredibly proud of with brilliant writers and production teams. As Co-CEOs we are delighted to now lead the company onwards into its next exciting chapter, remaining true to Jill’s founding principle of always striving to find ways to bring great stories to screen - on schedule and on budget!”\n\nThe first notable expansion to the EHF senior team is Sarah Woolway joining the company in the newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer. As CCO Sarah is responsible for all commercial, legal and financial matters. Prior to joining EHF, Sarah was Head of Business and Legal Affairs at Gaumont in the UK for 2 years.\n\nBefore that Sarah worked at BBC Studios for 18 years across a number of business areas including international channels, with a stint at BBC America, and as Head of BLA for the children’s, drama and comedy genres in Content Partnerships.\n\nWoolway joined EHF as CCO in June 2024 and Eve Gutierrez (Co-CEO) and Paula Cuddy (Co-CEO) assume their new roles with immediate effect. Jill Green assumes her role as Chairperson from September 2024.\n\nHelion Partners advised EHF on the transaction.\n\nAbout Eleventh Hour Films\n\nEstablished in 2010, EHF is an independent scripted production company that focuses on producing drama of the highest quality, both in the UK and internationally. EHF is currently shooting ‘Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue’ for MGM+ and BBC and is in post-production on ‘Moonflower Murders’ starring Lesley Manville for PBS Masterpiece and the BBC, a follow-up to EHF’s critically acclaimed adaptation of Anthony Horowitz’s best-selling novel ‘Magpie Murders’. The company’s reimagining of Ian Rankin’s ‘Rebus’ novels starring Richard Rankin from screenwriter Gregory Burke launched in the UK on the BBC on May 17th.\n\nEHF has also recently produced twisted thriller ‘The Killing Kind’ for Paramount + UK and Sony Pictures Television, based on the best-selling novel by Jane Casey, which launched in the US on Hulu in May, and a third series of the globally successful spy series ‘Alex Rider’, which has sold in over 100 territories worldwide. The third series launched in April on Amazon Freevee in the UK, US and Germany. The company’s other productions include ‘Foyle’s War’, ‘Safe House’ and ‘Collision’.\n\nAbout Sony Pictures Television\n\nSony Pictures Television (“SPT”) is one of the television industry’s leading content providers, producing, distributing, and carrying programming worldwide in every genre and for every platform.
