        "text": "Known as the Dealer and the Digger, they were once the best of friends. Now they are at war. Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of the Swiss trading giant Glencore, left the City reaching for the smelling salts on Friday when he tore up a friendly merger with mining giant Xstrata at the eleventh hour. Xstrata is led by Mick Davis.\n\nIn a remarkable move, Glasenberg is calling on the miner’s shareholders to back his takeover bid rather than the original merger, oust Xstrata’s chief executive Davis and appoint him instead.\n\nFor years, it has been an open secret that Glasenberg, called the Dealer after his trading empire, and Davis, known as the Digger for his mining expertise – two school friends from South Africa – were planning to merge their empires and become “Glenstrata”. The tie-up would have brought the friends together, with Davis staying on as chief executive and Glasenberg taking on the job of deputy CEO and president.\n\nAfter years of talks, a crunch vote on the tie-up was scheduled for Friday morning. Ostensibly the deal looked dead in the water because Qatar Holding, Xstrata’s second biggest shareholder, had said it would use its blocking stake to vote the deal down on the issue of the value of the offer of 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share.\n\nBut the City half-expected Glasenberg, a consummate gambler by nature, to offer a last-minute sweetener that would seal the deal.\n\nInstead, in 24 hours of dramatic twists, the Dealer blew the Digger out of the water and set up a bitter takeover battle.\n\nThe day started as expected at 8am in Zug, Switzerland, where Glencore kicked off an extraordinary general meeting to vote on the deal.\n\n“I apologise for bringing some of you here almost on false pretences,” said Murray.\n\n“I am afraid to tell you there has been an adjournment. There has been an overnight development and we weren’t able to give you any notice of it.”\n\nAnd with that, the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) – which for once lived up to its name – was over.\n\nWhen the markets opened in London, shares in Xstrata soared as traders speculated Glasenberg had hatched a last-gasp deal with the Qataris. But Glencore made no formal stock exchange announcement, much to the irritation of City regulators, who believed shares in both companies should have been suspended.\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the Swiss conference centre, Davis and Xstrata’s chairman, Sir John Bond, a former chief executive of HSBC, were preparing for their own shareholder vote.\n\nXstrata’s non-executive directors, including Claude Lamoureux, sat waiting for Bond and Davis to take their seats for around 20 minutes, seemingly unaware of the developments elsewhere in Zug.\n\nGlencore’s revised proposal was delivered to Xstrata’s management team just moments before the emergency general meeting.\n\n“This is no way to conduct the takeover of a public company,” complained a source close to Xstrata on Friday. Sir John, under pressure from City regulators to quickly clarify the position, was preparing a statement that would reveal Glasenberg’s audacious transition from friendly merger partner to predator.\n\n“The proposal envisages an increase to the merger ratio to 3.05 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share.” In the game of chicken being played over price, it seemed Glasenberg had blinked first.\n\nBut then, in a deadpan voice, Sir John added: “The proposal envisages changes to the proposed governance arrangements including Ivan Glasenberg to become CEO of the combined group and the ability for Glencore to structure the transaction as a takeover offer or as a scheme of arrangement of Xstrata.”\n\nWithout further explanation, Sir John moved on to take shareholder questions about pay and asked investors to test the electronic voting system by indicating a preference for cheese or chocolate fondue.\n\nIn the City, the response was slack-jawed. The new terms completely changed the deal. In return for upping his offer, Glasenberg wanted to buy Xstrata, not merge with it and – even more radically – he wanted to fire his old friend, Davis.\n\nAs the EGM ended, a shocked Sir John stood up to remind shareholders the deal had been described as a “merger” because Davis and finance director, Trevor Reid, were set to take the two main executive roles at the enlarged Glenstrata.\n\nIn fact, as much as the merger itself, the partnership between Glasenberg, the financial wizard, and Davis, the mergers and acquisitions expert, was touted to shareholders as a corporate match made in heaven.\n\nNeither man needed the money from a deal. Glasenberg became a multi-billionaire when Glencore was floated for $60bn last year, while Davis is a mere multi-millionaire on £8m a year.\n\nBorn in the late 1950s, the two men grew up in South Africa’s tight-knit Jewish community. Glasenberg, the son of a Lithuanian luggage maker, emigrated to Switzerland, where he founded Glencore. Davis lives in Hampstead, north London, with his wife and three children.\n\nBut while they lived in different countries in the insular and intensely macho world of mining, the duo were said to be like “an old married couple”. Then, more than five years ago, the pair decided the time had come to share their assets.\n\nThe dream was to create a counter-cyclical behemoth buffered in the bad times by the steady cashflow of Glencore’s trading empire, and free in the good times to cash in on the commodities boom that is the lifeblood of the Xstrata business.\n\nIn 2010, it looked like the then unlisted Glencore would buy Xstrata and reverse into the company, giving the commodities trader an instant London listing. Instead, the next year, Xstrata’s independent shareholders pushed Glencore into a $60bn listing that cost an eye-watering £240m in advisory fees, arguing only an IPO would enable them to properly value the company ahead of a merger.\n\nThe deal on the table last Friday finally took formal shape last February, when Glencore launched a formal all-share offer for Xstrata,.\n\nThere were immediate rumblings of disagreement, despite the Xstrata board backing the deal. Davis, who as a matter of pride wanted to get the best possible price for shareholders, found a supporter in Qatar Holding, Xstrata’s biggest investor after Glencore.\n\nIn July, Qatar surprised the City by saying it would hold out for a bigger premium from Glencore. The merger was designed using a scheme of arrangement which required the approval of 75pc of Xstrata’s shareholders, giving the Qataris a blocking stake.\n\nOn Friday, it emerged the sovereign wealth fund, in its first role as kingmaker, had extracted a price hike from Glasenberg. In a move that broke the stalemate, senior executives from Qatar met Glasenberg at a secret London location late on Thursday.\n\nIt was even said that the former prime minister, Tony Blair – who advises the Qataris and is also on the board of JP Morgan, Xstrata’s investment banking adviser – was said to have been brought in to broker the deal.\n\nIt is understood that when Glasenberg left the meeting, he believed the Qataris supported his new higher bid.\n\nHowever, it seemed on Friday that the sovereign wealth fund was taken by surprise at Glasenberg’s additional plan to axe Davis and senior Xstrata board members.\n\nSources say that the Qataris have voiced concerns about wholesale changes to the executive team to Xstrata’s board. The situation remained unresolved on Friday night as the fund waited for further details of what Glencore will offer.\n\nA wounded Davis, however, came out fighting.\n\nA bullish statement to the markets from Xstrata questioned whether the new bid, which it calculated at just 17.6pc higher than the miner’s undisturbed share price, had factored in a sufficient premium for change of control.\n\nThe new offer was “significantly lower than would be expected in a takeover”, insisted the company.\n\nXstrata has a secret weapon. Glencore cannot amend its scheme of arrangement offer – which requires 75pc shareholder approval to get it through to a straight Takeover Code offer (which requires just 50.1pc) – without the permission of Xstrata’s board. It is understood Xstrata is not minded to change the terms because it wishes to protect its minority shareholders.\n\nHolding out will force Glasenberg to either walk away for six months until he can make a fresh offer or fight hard to get shareholder votes.\n\nInvestors and analysts were split on Friday on whether Glencore’s higher offer was enough to secure his price.\n\n“Ivan needed to do a deal to get the whole thing through,” said one investor. “Clearly he’s bumped up the offer, we think enough to get the Qataris on side and get a lot of shareholders on side.”\n\nHowever, Richard Buxton, of Schroders, one of Xstrata’s biggest institutional shareholders, said he will hold out for more cash.\n\nMr Buxton said the new proposals “made a mockery of the merger terms” which had been discussed for the past seven months.\n\n“We think that Mick and his team should still be in the driving seat – and that hasn’t changed,” he added.\n\nWith investors split down the middle, the “Glenstrata” project could go either way."
