        "text": "Eleventh Hour Films’ talent head and creative director have stepped up to run the company after Sony Pictures Television upped its investment in the scripted indie to a majority stake.\n\nEve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy have become joint chief executives of the Magpie Murders and Rebus producer, with founder Jill Green stepping down from the role after 14 years.\n\nGreen will now chair the company and takes on a creative executive producer role, with additional strategic support for the management team.\n\nGutierrez has overseen Alex Rider, Eleventh Hour’s spy drama for Amazon Prime, while Cuddy’s chief credits include Rebus and Paramount+ series The Killing Kind.\n\nThe company has also hired Gaumont exec and former BBC Studios veteran Sarah Woolway as Eleventh Hour’s first chief commercial officer.\n\nSPT has upped the minority stake it has held in Eleventh Hour since 2018 and its increased investment puts the producer in the same bracket as SPT-owned scripted indies Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\nSPT president of international production Wayne Garvie said: “Over the past decade, Jill, Eve, and Paula have built a remarkable company and it has been a great joy for everyone at Sony to have been part of their adventure.\n\n“We’ve witnessed first-hand their ability for consistently delivering high-quality, commercial event television with global appeal. We are overjoyed that they are becoming a full member of our roster of world-leading drama labels. Their development pipeline suggests that the next few years are going to be even more remarkable, and SPT will be a proud partner.”\n\nEleventh Hour’s current slate includes BBC1 and PBS’s Magpie Murders follow-up Moonflower Murders and BBC1/MGM+ co-pro Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue.\n\nSeparately, Cosmopolitan Pictures, the indie behind BBC crime drama The Mallorca Files, has become the fourth UK indie to receive investment from The Story Collective.\n\nTSC has taken a 25% stake in the outfit, having already taken minority stakes in Artis Pictures, Maia Pictures and Mighty Pebble Pictures.\n\nCosmopolitan typically delivers European co-productions and recently worked with Italian indie Fast Film on Per Elisa: il Caso Claps, a true crime series for Rai italia.\n\nEleventh Hour Films’ talent head and creative director have stepped up to run the company after Sony Pictures Television upped its investment in the scripted indie to a majority stake.\n\nEve Gutierrez and Paula Cuddy will take over from founder Jill Green, who steps down as chief executive after 14 years.\n\nGreen will now chair the company and takes on a creative executive producer role, with additional strategic support for the management team.\n\nGutierrez has overseen Alex Rider, Eleventh Hour’s spy drama for Amazon Prime, while Cuddy’s chief credits include BBC1 drama Rebus and Paramount+ series The Killing Kind.\n\nThe company has also hired Gaumont exec and former BBC Studios veteran Sarah Woolway as Eleventh Hour’s first chief commercial officer.\n\nSPT has upped the minority stake it has held in Eleventh Hour since 2018 and its increased investment puts the Magpie Murders producer in the same bracket as SPT-owned scripted indies Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\nSPT president of international production Wayne Garvie said: “Over the past decade, Jill, Eve, and Paula have built a remarkable company and it has been a great joy for everyone at Sony to have been part of their adventure.\n\n“We’ve witnessed first-hand their ability for consistently delivering high-quality, commercial event television with global appeal.
