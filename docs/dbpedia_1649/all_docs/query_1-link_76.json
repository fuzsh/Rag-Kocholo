        "text": "A violent dad who killed his month-old baby by snapping his neck in a spate of abuse asked friends to donate to a bereavement charity to make himself appear more sympathetic. In the months after killing Ollie Davis, Michael Davis appealed for help for Sands, which supports people grieving the loss of a baby or the failure of a pregnancy.\n\nExpressing her anger over the \"cynical\" move by Davis, Sands' chief executive Clea Harmer said: \"We are horrified at the appalling crime committed by Michael Davis, who murdered his baby son Ollie. We are angry and upset to learn that he then cynically appealed for donations to Sands, apparently in an attempt to paint a sympathetic picture of himself.\n\n\"Our investigations have confirmed that no donations were made through this channel. The news reports around the sentencing are deeply distressing, especially for anyone who has experienced pregnancy or baby loss, and we are here to provide comfort and support to anyone who needs this.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Father who killed infant son and mum who let it happen sentenced\n\nMichael Davis, 29, of Carlisle Street, West End, Leicester, was yesterday (Wednesday) jailed for a minimum of 22 years, while Ollie's mother, 31-year-old Kayleigh Driver, of the same address, was jailed for seven years for letting the abuse take place.\n\nDriver's father, Ricky Driver, released a statement through Leicestershire Police summing up how Ollie's death in Beaumont Leys, Leicester, in 2017 and the trial earlier this year have affected the wider family. He said: “On the 21 October 2017 we were awaken to the sad news of Ollie's sudden death and concluded that it was probably a cot death. A day none of us will forget.\n\n“After further examination by experts, we were horrified to find out there were suspicious circumstances regarding Ollie's death. The police arrested Kayleigh and Michael for questioning - this shook the family to the core.\n\n“Over time the injuries were made public, and we couldn’t believe what we were being told. Ollie was perfect in every way when he was born. He had been beaten badly over time and was left to die with his injuries.\n\n“This was our worst nightmare. How could anybody hurt a beautiful baby was beyond words. We felt sick to our stomachs, and we have shed many a tear thinking what Ollie went through in his final days.\n\n“This has changed our family forever and we suffer mentally from these evil actions. All we want is justice for Ollie as that is the least that he deserves.\n\n“We would like to say a big thank you to Leicestershire Police for all of their hard work and support of the family at this difficult time and everyone involved in the case. As a family we have been dragged through hell for nearly seven years, with all the lies and deceit.\n\n“Ollie will be forever in our broken hearts, and his memory will forever live on. No sentence imposed will ever reflect the heartache and pain inflicted upon my family. As a family, we will never be able to come to terms with what has happened to Ollie.\n\n“We are a private family, and this trial has sadly brought about media attention we did not want. We have struggled to write this statement as we do not want our deepest, personal thoughts to be aired in public, but we know it is important for people to know how this has affected our once close family.\""
