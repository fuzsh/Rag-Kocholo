        "text": "The clock is ticking for fans of Canadian hardcore band F***ed Up.\n\nThe Polaris Music Prize-winning Toronto act announced Wednesday that it was giving fans a limited-time offer for a full album of new music.\n\n“Who’s Got the Time & a Half?” was posted on their Bandcamp page around midday.\n\nThe Damian Abraham-fronted group says it was recorded in only 24 hours earlier this year.\n\nThey said fans have just 24 hours to snap it up for themselves before it vanishes.\n\nThe album is priced at US$5 on the website and arrives two days before the band releases “Another Day,” a previously scheduled studio album to coincide with a run of Canadian tour dates next month.\n\nThe album is available at the Bandcamp link: https://bit.ly/3ywUrDG\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 7, 2024."
