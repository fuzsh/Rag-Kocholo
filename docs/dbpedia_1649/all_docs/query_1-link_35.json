        "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Hinds County’s top prosecutor says he’s spent tens of thousands of dollars of his own money to cover grand jury expenses, in large part, because the juries can no longer meet at the Hinds County Courthouse.\n\nDistrict Attorney Jody Owens provided lists of statements and invoices from the Westin Hotel, where he’s been convening grand jury meetings for years.\n\nSince February 2023, those charges have come to nearly $75,000 - an amount Owens says he initially pays out of pocket, with hopes of being reimbursed from his office’s reserves and seizure funds.\n\nHowever, he says those funds have largely dried up and he needs the Board of Supervisors to step in and help.\n\n“Using one of my business credit cards, just to be able to put stuff on it every month and try to seek the reimbursement... it’s not sustainable,” he said. “I mean, it should have never happened in the first place.”\n\nHe says he can’t continue to pay the amount out-of-pocket, but he can’t move back to the Hinds County Courthouse until repairs there are made.\n\n“We have flooding throughout our office. I had an attorney move out of her office just this Friday because she saw what she believes was mold,” he said. “People really don’t understand the condition of this place.”\n\nAmong concerns, the grand jury room and Law Library in the DA’s Office flood during storms. The carpeting in part of the law library had to be pulled up because of the water damage.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small room adjacent to the Law Library, a large barrel has been put in place to collect rainwater, while other garbage cans have been strategically located elsewhere to catch water coming in from smaller leaks.\n\n“If you go to any courtroom... you will see somewhere either [evidence] of leaks or corrosion in the roof,” he said. “Even the Jordan Cummins trial, we had to move it one day because it started raining and water was coming in.”\n\nThe District Attorney began using the Westin during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe was attracted to the hotel because it was close to the DA’s Office and because it had enough space to allow jurors, attorneys, and others to practice social distancing.\n\n“It was big, it was spacious, and it allowed us... to have a safe place where jurors could come,” he said.\n\nHowever, the hotel is costly. Room rentals for May and June, for instance, totaled $1,500. That amount doesn’t include the $930 spent for jurors’ meals, the $378 charged for parking, or the $360 in service fees also tacked on.\n\nOwens said he’s tried to reduce those costs, in part, by providing outside catering - something the hotel wouldn’t allow. He’s also been able to defray costs by moving some meeting days to the Warren Hood Building.\n\nGrand juries are convened once a month for the First Judicial District and once a quarter for the Second. Typically, 25 people are called to serve.\n\nSince November, 987 cases have been presented to the grand jury, with those cases representing 1,619 charges, data from the District Attorney’s Office shows.\n\n“The mayor allowed us, because of the crimes that happen in Jackson, [to use] the conference room,” he said. “But we have all these other crimes that [are brought to us] from other agencies, that we don’t have a place to put them. So we still have to use the Westin.”\n\nOwens says he’s now working with the County Administrator on a request to take to the board, and he hopes to present it at one of the board’s upcoming meetings.\n\nIn October, the board voted unanimously to allocate $45,000 in American Rescue Plan Act funds to help cover grand jury costs. However, Owens says his office has never gotten that money.\n\nIn the meantime, Owens says he’s going to continue to tout his office’s work. saying that since January, his office has taken 17 people to trial, getting guilty verdicts in 80 percent of them.\n\nThose found guilty include Jordan Cummins, who killed two people near the Hal’s St. Paddy’s Day Parade back in 2023, and Beth Ann White, who was sentenced to 110 years in prison in connection with a deadly November 2021 wreck that claimed the lives of two people.\n\nHinds County DA 2024 Guilty Verdicts:\n\nAntrez Davis - Auto burglary\n\nMichael Green - Capital murder\n\nLashundra Bass - Guilty plea at trial, second-degree murder\n\nLonzell Williams - Aggravated assault\n\nTerrance Longino - First-degree murder\n\nMaurice Forte - Four counts of Capital murder\n\nChristopher Butler - First-degree murder\n\n“So, we’re going to be more aggressive in our ask, because no one wins if we can’t do our job,” he said. “We’re not going to be paying out-of-pocket for something that the board has a responsibility to do.”\n\nWant more WLBT news in your inbox?
