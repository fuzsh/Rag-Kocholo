        "text": "It isn’t common for Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman to make an unbilled appearance during a show on the Strip. But Ne-Yo is no ordinary artist.\n\nGoodman surprised the recording superstar, who was raised in Las Vegas, on Wednesday night at Encore Theater with a “Key to the City” and a proclamation designating Aug. 7, 2024, as “Ne-Yo Day” in our city.\n\nGoodman arrived two songs into Ne-Yo’s first night of a three-show “Human Love Rebellion” series at the Wynn theater. Ne-Yo has sold out all three nights, returning Friday and Saturday.\n\nGoodman joined the performance from stage right, unannounced and carrying a mic. “We have a special surprise tonight. I am the the luckiest person to call this wonderful man Family Las Vegas,” the mayor said.\n\nGoodman produced the key by claiming, “Yours has extra jewels than the one we gave to Usher a couple months ago.”\n\nThe Strip is Clark County territory, and usually a Clark County Commissioner issues Keys to the Las Vegas Strip. But the mayor took lead on this event, as she receives many requests, including for events on the Strip. The Encore Theater location is incidental to that process.\n\nAs city of Las Vegas spokesman Jace Radke said, “The mayor loves Las Vegas and its home-grown ambassadors.”\n\nA city marshal toted the framed proclamation and key to the spotlight, and the crowd erupted.\n\nWiping sweat from his brow and wearing a righteous leopard-patterned suit, Ne-Yo accepted the honor and said he was trying not to be too emotional. “I can’t cry in this suit!”\n\nIn his debut performance, the headliner was flanked by a pair of oversized boxes, serving as entrance and exit points and displaying video throughout the show. His four-piece band was split on a pair of risers, and he was backed by a half-dozen dancers, wearing chic, Vegas-fashioned costumes (one-legged, black one-piece outfits and gold-blinged numbers with shin-high boots).\n\nThe recording artist waded into the crowd late in the show and was nearly overtaken by fans. The performance included an epic dance-off among three highly energized audience members. A one-show festival, as it were.\n\nIn accepting his award, Ne-Yo was recognized for his series of hits and philanthropic contributions to Las Vegas. He spent ample time in his youth at the Las Vegas Boys & Girls Club. He moved to town at age 9 with his mother, Lorraine, after moving from Arkansas. He attended Las Vegas Academy from the ninth through 11th grades, then graduated from Rancho High School.\n\nThe 44-year-old artist, whose legal name is Shaffer Chimere Smith, has won three Grammy Awards and collected more than 23 billion streams worldwide. Ne-Yo’s NPR “Tiny Desk” performance in April has generated nearly 7 million views in only three months since its release. This summer, the RIAA announced that his collaboration with Pitbull and Afrojack on “Give Me Everything” was officially certified diamond.\n\nNe-Yo has also just released his new single “2 Million Secrets,” his first release as a fully independent artist. He also made his directorial debut with the song’s corresponding music video that he conceptualized.\n\nNe-Yo most recently played Vegas at the Lovers and Friends festival at Las Vegas Festival Grounds in May 2023, followed by a set at Drai’s Nightclbub in May. His debut single, 2005’s “So Sick,” ascended to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified quadruple-platinum (more than 4 million sales). He has since rolled up a series of hits with “Closer,” “Because of You,” “Miss Independent,” and “Push Back” (feat. Bebe Rexha and Stefflon Don).”\n\nThe recording superstar has also written hits for other international hit makers. He was behind Rihanna’s “Unfaithful,” “Russian Roulette,” and “Take a Bow,” along with Beyoncé’s 2006 breakup anthem “Irreplaceable” and has written for such artists as Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Carrie Underwood, Celine Dion and Mario.\n\nThe multi-hyphen artist also has built an impressive acting resume. Ne-Yo’s film and television credits include NBC’s “World of Dance,” Netflix’s “Dance Monsters,” “Empire,” “Stomp the Yard,” “Save the Last Dance,” “Battle: Los Angeles,” “George Lucas’ Red Tails,” “The Wiz Live!,” “Starz’ Step Up: High Water,” “HipHop Family Christmas Wedding” and “The Sound of Christmas.” Ne-Yo is to be starring in the upcoming fourth season of 50 Cent’s acclaimed drama series “BMF” on STARZ.\n\nReturn of Sorrentino\n\nSteven Sorrentino spent 20 years playing Elton John in “Legends in Concert” and as a soloist. He’s now a filmmaker and actor, with a project that is entirely self-generated, “Amends of the Father,” debuting Friday and Saturday at the Las Vegas Premiere Film Festival at the Galaxy Theaters Boulevard Mall on Maryland Parkway.\n\nSorrentino was also Debbie Reynolds’ opening act for five years. “That’s when I realized that Hollywood was the place to go,” Sorrentino said.” Debbie called me and told me that I was an actor, not just a comedian. I used to get up in the morning and drive five hours to Hollywood from Vegas for auditions and then five hours back to Vegas to do two shows a night in ‘Legends in Concert.’”\n\nSorrentino wrote, directed, produced, stars in and cast the film, which he says is largely autobiographical. The other two actors are Candy Clark from “American Graffiti,” and Randy Jones, who was the cowboy in the Village People. This sounds interesting, to say the least. Go to eventbrite.com for info and tickets.\n\nCool Hang Alert\n\nThe Soul Fusion musical experience is back at Myron’s at 7 p.m. Monday. Vocalists Ashley Fuller of Ashley Fuller & The Collective house band at Brad Garrett’s Comedy Club and Fletch Walcott of David Perrico and the Raiders House Band head up the soul. Dave Siegel is on keys, YL Douglas on drums, Tim Bailey on bass, Steven Lee on guitar, with Rita Lim and Noybel Gorgoy as guest singers. Vegas has a deep, diverse bench of talented entertainers and this bunch rocks it. Tickets still on sale at thesmithcenter.com."
