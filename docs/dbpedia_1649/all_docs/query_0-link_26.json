        "text": "Writer Killers\n\nThere's no actual list yet, but perhaps there ought to be. Wherever screenwriters gather and swap stories there are always certain directors whose names are passed around with an attached health warning. The writer killers.\n\nThey rarely complete a project with the writer who began it. Many of the projects they join don't get completed at all but run out of steam, time, money, and the will to see it made. And yet many writer killers are considered 'star names' - they usually have at least one award win on their CV which continues to get them hired.\n\nBut given the chance to play the auteur, they play it to the hilt. For me the absolute worst is when you get the bones of a thing right and then a director comes on board who wants afternoon-long meetings which leave you looking at a pile of broken parts that you know can never make another whole. Like someone gave a chimp a screwdriver and invited him to fix your TV. Then he strolls off, pleased with himself at having 'mixed it up', leaving you to implement his genius.\n\nFrom then on, the project is like a crash victim; never quite consistent, never quite right, never quite beautiful. No longer created, more rehabilitated. As good as the limitations of surgery can make it.\n\nWriter killers stay in the game because they're actually capable of good work. Usually under a strong producer who knows the value of script, and keeps them on message.\n\nIn a recent piece on working with directors in issue 3 of Black Static magazine, screenwriter Stephen Volk concludes \"What I have thought for many a long year now: that the auteur theory (or 'Un Film de Michael Bay,' if you will) is essentially nothing to do with talent, but everything to do with who is in control.\"\n\nHe adds, \"The purpose here is not a quest for deeper meaning, it is for the director to make the film theirs. Not better - just theirs.\"\n\nWhen you get a producer who would rather unload a jobbing director than alienate the project's creator, you have a gem.\n\nTheir names get passed around, too.\n\nThe Midwich Cuckoos\n\nA few years back, before the project was stalled by litigation, I started to develop ideas for a contemporary TV adaptation of John Wyndham's The Midwich Cuckoos for producer Marc Samuelson. At that time Marc's company had a long-term option on all the Wyndham material that still lay within the Estate's control.\n\nMy take on it was that the premise wouldn't easily modernise without losing its essential tone but that to do it as a period piece would be pointless, as Wolf Rilla's Village of the Damned was pretty well definitive for its time. I reckoned that one could only clone it, or change things and do it less well.\n\nMy proposed answer was to incorporate the material from Midwich Main, expanding the range of story elements available to the adaptor while staying entirely true to Wyndham. Midwich Main was an unfinished sequel that Wyndham abandoned because, according to the correspondence in Liverpool University's Special Collections and Archives, he felt it was leading into developments that would be little more than a rerun of the original story.\n\nWhat there is of the sequel, about 25,000 words, is also part of the Wyndham archive. Thanks to librarian/administrator Andy Sawyer, I was able to get myself over to Liverpool and read the typescript.\n\nI could see what Wyndham meant about his structure. But I could also see elements in his new narrative that might be used to expand the original. All adaptation involves losses and additions, none more radical than when updating a story's setting. But using these elements, rather than inventions of my own, would mean that the reshaping could be done using mostly authentic parts.\n\nIt stopped there, because the producers of the John Carpenter Village of the Damned feature announced a TV spinoff that they weren't entitled to make, and which would have infringed on Samuelson's option. Back in the 60s the feature film rights had been separated and sold outright to MGM while the TV rights had been retained. Samuelson acted and the whole thing drifted off into lawyer-land, never to return.\n\nOne of my proposals included using the same two young actors for all the Midwich children, Oompaloompa-style.\n\nDexter\n\nITV have begun running promos for Dexter, so pretty soon everyone in the UK will have a chance to see what all the fuss has been about. In the US, it's already completed its second season. I referenced the show in a talk that I gave to the Forensic Science Society almost two years ago, and they must be starting to think that I made it up.\n\nDexter's great, and proof positive that the key to good drama is more in the tone and handling than the actual idea - on paper the entire premise looks like something dreamed up by the Columbine kids but in execution it's sly, witty, morally sound* and very entertaining.\n\n(*if you can get past what the protagonist does with his power tools)\n\nFor the uninitiated: the creation of novelist Jeff Lindsay, Dexter Morgan is a highly-functioning sociopath with an interior monologue relaying his observations of a world that he doesn't feel part of, but in which he participates by faking human emotion.\n\nBy day Dexter works as a blood-spatter expert for the Miami PD. At night he tracks down those who've committed terrible crimes but somehow evaded justice, and offs them.\n\nHe was adopted by a policeman at a very early age after witnessing an unspecified atrocity, the exact nature of which is part of the unfolding story. His stepfather spotted his sociopathic tendencies when he was an adolescent and taught him to channel them away from the innocent, as well as teaching him the importance of appearing normal. It's dark, dark humour, and one of the beauties of the show is the sight of Dexter gradually getting closer to the truth about himself and growing a soul.\n\nI also think it's one of the best-acted dramas around. Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Dexter's gawky cop sister, is phenomenal.\n\nThe Turn of the Tide\n\nLooks like the high-definition format war is as good as over and that the next time I upgrade my Jason and the Argonauts, it'll be to a Blu-Ray disc.\n\nI mean, I haven't got a Blu-Ray player or anything. I haven't even got a hi-def TV. But at some point I will. I was an early adopter with digital, buying one of Sony's first widescreen sets with an integrated digital receiver. Despite some early problems with the technology - to which Sony responded with exemplary customer service, I have to say - the damn set goes on and on and won't die.\n\n(Having said which, I'd still choose it over almost any hi-def TV that I've seen to date. The hi-def sets render more detail but I find their images crisp, crude, and unpleasant to look at. I quite like the look of plasma, especially for movies. But the LCD screens affect me like a singer whose technique is beyond criticism but who simply doesn't make a likeable noise. And when a hi-def set displays your everyday TV broadcast signal... ech!)\n\nSo I'm in no rush anyway. On Deadline Hollywood Daily Nikki Finke reports that Wal-Mart and Netflix - giant retailer and world's largest online movie rental service, respectively - are abandoning the HD-DVD format and going with Blu-Ray only from now on.\n\nI could have predicted this. But only because Blu-Ray has the cooler and more memorable name. When you have no idea what the subtle differences in the technology may be, such things assume an absurd importance. I can see the lumpy-sounding HD-DVD struggling on a while longer, but essentially it's rolling off down the belt that carried away Polaroid Super-8 self-processing cartridges and the Advanced Photo System.\n\nRita Rudner once said that she wasn't going to buy a CD player until they promised that they wouldn't invent anything else. But once you pass the into the digital realm, new technologies don't necessarily make your old technology obsolete. Your CDs will rip to your MP3 player. Your DVDs will play on a Blu-Ray machine.\n\nThe disc and the case that you bought were an irrelevant part of the purchase; what your money paid for was the data. I never had much of a VHS collection, but I've got quite a number of DVDs. I give the cases away and file the discs in sleeves which allows me to keep my shelves free for books, as God intended. Trust me; DVD cases do not furnish a room.\n\nWhen discs become obsolete I'll no doubt upload the stuff I want to keep into whatever the new format will be, and keep everything in even less space.\n\nExcept for Jason and the Argonauts. That, I'll have to buy again.\n\nWhistle Down the Wind\n\nI thought it worth giving more prominence to this comment by Stan in response to the Where I'm At post:\n\nI looked after the remastering of Whistle Down The Wind about 5 years ago and usually we have to transfer full frame in 16:9 for broadcasters but because this was specifically for a DVD release, we were permitted to transfer in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1 with the sides slightly blanked (in 16:9) - I think it's always much nicer to see features in the exact ratio they were shot. We transferred from the original negative and, with a bit of after treatment, I was quite pleased with the results. The DVD is still available and has a commentary by Hayley Mills - Play.com have it at £5.99 (a bargain).\n\nFascinating stuff! I have this, though I haven't actually watched it - I bought it to replace the disc that my daughter's drama teacher borrowed for a school production of WDTW, and which I never... well, fill in the blanks. Suffice it to say that I didn't want to be without a copy.\n\n(My record on upgrades and replacements is held by Jason and the Argonauts... from Standard 8 silent to Super 8 sound to a sharper, American-sourced Super 8 print; then VHS, then DVD, and then a replacement DVD when... well, it wasn't a teacher, this time. But if ever there was a film that I'd like to see given a top-level HD makeover...)\n\nI hadn't realised that she was doing me a favour. I assumed that the new disc was a repackage, not a complete new transfer; the fact that it was bundled in a boxed set with Tiger Bay and a disc of John Mills' home movies, all for about a tenner, kept my expectations in check.\n\nThat school production, by the way, wasn't of the overblown and Americanised Jim Steinman musical, but of an earlier musical adaptation by Russell Labey and Richard Taylor that preserves the tone and setting of the Waterhouse/Hall screenplay.\n\nMy kid played Cathy. I've said it before... my universe has meaning.\n\nYo Bafta\n\nSo, the Bafta results are out. Read 'em here.\n\nBut don't expect to see Sweeney Todd much represented, and don't take that as an critique of its quality. Despite being (in my humble opinion) one of the top of this year's crop, a dark masterpiece with a superbly sweet and sad turn from Helena Bonham Carter, its release so late in the qualifying period is bound to have kept it off the radar of many voters. True, the distributors put on a number of member screenings just before Christmas, but most were in central London and many of those were during working hours. And the great thing about the Baftas is, they're mainly voted by industry pros.\n\nFor anyone who's interested in how the awards process works: it started in early December when notice went out that this year's voting applet was available for downloading. Up to that point I thought I'd been keeping up pretty well with the year's releases but as soon as I saw the list of eligible titles, I knew I had some serious catching-up to do.\n\nScreeners started hitting the mat soon after. In the first round of voting, you can make up to a dozen nominations in each craft and performance category. Nobody can see everything but if everybody chooses by their own lights and pushes their personal boundaries a bit then a credible shortlist ought to emerge. For some categories there are also 'chapters', juries who can add to the shortlists in areas of membership ignorance.\n\nAll voting takes place online. When the shortlist is announced a few days later, I always try to make sure that I've seen every movie on it before voting again. That round produces the list of nominees, the people who sweat with the TV cameras on them as the gold envelope is opened.\n\nI don't know how the Oscar process works but I imagine it's something similar. The Oscars are treated like some ultimate standard of deep worth, like God has peeped into each movie's soul and issued the final word on its value. But they're basically a poll of opinion amongst people who work in the industry and pay their academy subs.\n\nI can't speak for anyone else, but I take my Bafta voting really seriously. I see it as a chance to exercise my own judgement, not to confirm the anointed. And I seem to be pretty good at anticipating the winners; my 'hit rate' over the past four or five years seems to have been a fairly consistent 70%.\n\nFor example; Marion Cotillard was described as a 'surprise winner' in the Best Actress category. Not to me.\n\nHer Edith Piaf biopic La Vie en Rose isn't what I'd call a great movie. It's one of those life histories that shovels on the misery with the energy of a stoker on a speeding train - I know it's all true, but cramming it all into two hours is a dangerous business. Genuine tragedy risks a descent into bathos.\n\nBut the whole thing is held together by Cotillard's astonishing performance. The only comparison I can think of is de Niro in Raging Bull, and he didn't sing; Cotillard mimes to recordings of the later Piaf but supplies her own voice for the earlier numbers, and there's no visible join.\n\nThe screenplay follows a pattern that seems to have become de rigeur for biopics; start at the peak, flash back to the beginning, a fantasy sequence or two along the way, go out on some well-known moment of triumph.\n\nIf I noticed a trend this year it was toward narratives that unravel rather than conclude, and thus purport to be 'more like life'. I'm not saying that I demand pat solutions but if someone's going to insist on telling me a story, I listen because I'm expecting them to make a point with it.\n\nI don't always get it right. When I saw Before the Devil Knows You're Dead I immediately added Sidney Lumet to my Best Director noms list. Ditto with Hoffman (Philip Seymour, not Dustin) and Marisa Tomei for best actor and supporting actress.\n\nBut the true standout film for me was German Stasi thriller The Lives of Others - touching, tragic, scary, realistic, suspenseful, beautifully acted and shot, and quietly educative. And it has a proper ending! But it's also a 'foreign language film', which means it'll always get nods, but never the scale of nod it deserves.\n\nI wanted to say something about the Kenneth Branagh remake of Sleuth, but I'll just say this: don't go.\n\nWhere I'm At\n\nI'm fortunate. I work in a London-centred business but I don't have to live in London. I love the place, and I've lived there in the past; in Notting Hill Gate in the mid-seventies, when it was cheap, and for a while in Bayswater in the late 90s, when it wasn't. I always think of London as a great place to live, but not so great a place to spend your life.\n\nNowadays I just get in when I need to. It's a couple of hours on the train, or longer in the car when the trains have let me down yet again and I've sworn off them for a while. When I meet new people they always ask me where I've come from, and it's always slightly tricky to explain.\n\nI live in Lancashire's Ribble Valley, with a view of Pendle Hill from the fields above my house. The closest big town is Blackburn, where I set my novella In Gethsemene. I think its most conspicuous genre connection would be with William Hope Hodgson, known for riding his bike down the long cobbled stairwalk along the side of Corporation Park. He opened his physical sculpture school in the town, and it was here that he bound the visiting Harry Houdini so tightly that it took him two hours to make his escape.\n\nThe novelist David Cook lived in my village. Dodie '101 Dalmatians' Smith was raised in nearby Chorley and Jeanette Winterson in Accrington.\n\nIt was Charles Dickens' visit to nearby Preston that inspired the 'Coketown' of Hard Times.\n\nBut none of that gives you any idea of just how lovely the valley can be. It runs across into Yorkshire, into All Creatures Great and Small country. Recently it was used extensively as a location for the BBC's Born and Bred.\n\nBut, most importantly for me, 1961's Whistle Down the Wind was shot about five miles from here. It was the first movie I was ever taken to see, by my grandmother at the Carlton cinema in Salford, and I've been stealing from its themes and emotional objectives throughout my career. A few years back I sent a copy of Nightmare, With Angel to Bryan Forbes, thanking him for the movie and acknowledging the debt. I still have the nice note he sent me in return.\n\nMy recording of the Whistle Down the Wind score was lifted from a nostalgically crackly '45. It was written by top British composer Malcolm Arnold.\n\nThree or four years ago The South Bank Show ran a profile of Arnold and didn't hold back on his mental health problems; his dementia had left him in need of constant care and supervision and it seemed to me that his carer, Anthony Day, did a heroic job of not only seeing to Arnold's needs but also of maintaining his dignity. Day didn't seem to have any life of his own away from his charge, nor to want one."
