        "text": "Sony Pictures Television backed Eleventh Hour Films has optioned author C.M Ewan’s highly anticipated new thriller The House Hunt, published in the UK by Pan Macmillan.\n\nPaula Cuddy, Creative Director, and Eve Gutierrez, Executive Producer and Head Of Talent, Eleventh Hour Films, says: “Hot on the heels of our event drama series The Killing Kind coming to Paramount+ UK in September, we were searching for our next event thriller, and the manuscript of The House Hunt reeled us in. Chris, takes a relatable, ordinary situation and masterfully tilts it on a knife-edge, delivering a tense and gripping story that twists and turns to the very end. We can’t wait to bring it to screen and produce a nerve-shredding rollercoaster ride for audiences”.\n\nC.M. Ewan, author, The House Hunt, says: “Every writer dreams of finding a great partner for a TV adaptation of their work, and I knew from the first moment that Eleventh Hour Films expressed interest in ‘The House Hunt’ that they were the perfect team to develop my book with all the vision and flair I could hope for. The quality drama Eleventh Hour Films are responsible for speaks for itself, and I’m incredibly excited about their enthusiasm and vision for The House Hunt.”\n\nThe deal was struck by WME on behalf of the Darley Anderson Literary Agency."
