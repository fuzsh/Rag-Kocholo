        "text": "Zara Hayes (The Killing Kind, Showtrial) has joined Eleventh Hour Films as an in-house writer and executive producer.\n\nHayes served as co-writer and executive producer on Eleventh Hour’s The Killing Kind, which launched on Paramount+ UK. In 2021, she directed Showtrial, a five-part legal thriller about a young woman accused of murder, for BBC One.\n\nPaula Cuddy and Eve Gutierrez from Eleventh Hour Films said, “This relationship is born out of the fantastic creative experience we had collaborating with Zara on The Killing Kind, and it will channel her curiosity for the world into developing a new slate of projects with us. We will be primarily focusing on developing scripted ideas together, but we are also excited about the idea of crossing the line into the world of factual and exploring how the factual can inspire great drama for audiences.”\n\nHayes added, “I greatly enjoyed collaborating with Eleventh Hour Films on The Killing Kind. I admire their global ambition and fresh attitude towards making television. I can’t wait to see where this path leads and develop a slate that reflects my diverse interests and builds upon my background in directing both drama and documentary.”"
