        "text": "JUST when TV net works are shopping for new shows at the budget store, CBS has made a $30-million bet on a new series that sounds like “The X-Files” but looks like “CSI.”\n\n“Eleventh Hour,” which will debut in October, is being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer – the producer of all three “CSI” series, “Cold Case” and “Without a Trace,” making him arguably TV’s most successful producer of dramas of the last decade.\n\nBased on a hit British series, it follows a pair of investigators, a hunky scientist and an attractive female FBI agent assigned to keep him out of trouble, as they attempt to save the world from cutting-edge experiments gone wrong – botched cloning projects, genetically modified food gone wild (that’ll be the premiere episode) and out-of-control cryogenic labs.\n\nIt stars the British actor Rufus Sewell, known mostly for his villainous roles in movies like “The Illusionist” and “The Legend of Zorro.”\n\nBut “Eleventh Hour” is not intended to be sci-fi, says the show’s executive producer Ethan Reiff. “Every person in the country has had their life touched with the scientific developments that have come to fruition in the last few decades,” he explains. The pilot episode alone cost $4 million to produce, according to reports. And the 12 episodes the network has ordered will run about $2.3 million each.\n\nIn order to get the show, CBS had to win a spirited bidding war against ABC, according to reports.\n\nBookmakers might say that CBS’ $30-million gamble is a better-than-even-money proposition. Nearly every show Bruckheimer has delivered so far, from “CSI” to “Amazing Race,” has become among the most popular on TV.\n\n“Look at it this way,” says a budget-minded producer from a competing network show, “CBS wouldn’t have that money to spend in the first place if it wasn’t for Bruckheimer.”\n\n“What people will see is a really cool, somewhat stylish Jerry Bruckheimer show,” Reiff says. “It’s not exactly going to look the same as [other Bruckheimer series]. But it will be in the same family.”\n\nAt a little more than $2 million per episode, the cost of making “Eleventh Hour” is par for the course, in terms of network dramas, although the pricey pilot does cause it to stick out.\n\nThe distinction of the most expensive pilot ever falls to “Lost.” Creator J. J. Abrams reportedly spent nearly $12 million on the initial episode of the ABC drama. Abrams is reported to have spent as much for the pilot of his new Fox drama “Fringe.”\n\nLike “Lost,” which spent much of its budget on sets – think how expensive it is to dump a chopped up airliner on a beach in Hawaii – a good chunk of the resources for “Eleventh Hour” have been devoted to building movie-quality sets, Reiff says.\n\nIn any given episode, the characters may travel to several different locales – even though it is all filmed in LA.\n\n“Rather than have one standing police headquarters or a legal office suite, we have to change stuff up every week,” Reiff says.\n\n“There’s this ongoing struggle,” he confesses, “to be sensible and not create too many different locations.”"
