You take a bow, the curtain falls in front of you. You’re magical, on display. I gaze into your eyes, you turn to look the other way. But I’d really love to know. I’d really love to climb my way into your heart and see what I could find. I’d walk into your skin, swim through your veins. See it from your eyes. Cause I’d really love to try, yeah. Standing still but in my mind trying to escape. Looking for a place to hide. It’s not safe but I’m so near. Invading every place you go to disappear. I’d really love to know. I’d really love to climb my way into your heart, and see what I could find. I’d walk into your skin, swim through your veins. See it from your eyes. I’d really love to try. I’d really love to know. I’d really love to climb into your soul. Walk into your skin, swim through your veins. See it from your eyes. I’d really love to try. I’d really love to try. I want to get inside the you you’re hiding from. I want to get inside the you that you’re hiding from.\n\nSOMETHING BEAUTIFUL\n\nIf you put your arms around me, could it change the way I feel. I guess I let myself believe that the outside might just bleed it’s way in. Maybe stir the sleeping past lying under glass. Waiting for the kiss to break this awful spell. Pull me out of this lonely hell. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me normal. Change this something normal into something beautiful. What I get from my reflection isn¹t what I thought I’d see. Give me reason to beleive you’d never leave me incomplete. Will you untie this loss of mine, it so easily defines me. Do you see it on my face. That all I can think about is how long I’ve been waiting to feel you move me. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me normal. Change this something normal into something beautiful.\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nPeace takes a taxi to the underground. I want to love the world but I don’t know how. Blame it on the d.j. spinning all the fast songs - ain’t playing anything that I can sing along. If you know the words try to sing along. When you get the beat, grab a hammer, bang a gong. Cause you don’t have to fight or make yourself belong to be a revolution. If you wanna learn to play the rock\n\nguitar. Throw down your guns, you’re gonna be a star. You gotta begin with who you know you are to be a revolution. The time is right to cross that line and let love find a way. So if you know the words then try to sing along. When you get the beat, grab a hammer, bang a gong. Cause you gotta fight or make yourself belong to be a revolution.\n\nFLY\n\nBe still let your hand melt into mine. The part of me that breathes when you breath is losing time. I can’t find the words to say I’ll never say goodbye. I’ll fly with you through the night so you know I’m not letting go. I’m not letting go. My tears like rain fill up the sky. Oh my love I’m not letting go, I won’t let you go. I saw the host of silent angels waiting on their own. Knowing all the promises of faith come alive when you see home. Hold still and let your hand melt into mine. Shed your heart and your breath and your pain and fly. Now you’re alive. I’ll fly with you through the night so you know I’m not letting go. I’m not letting go. Tears like rain fill up the sky. Oh my love I’m not letting go, I won’t let you go. I’m not letting go, I won’t let you go.\n\nI NEED YOU\n\nStrangely out of place, there is a light filling this room where none would follow before. I can’t deny it burns me up inside. I fan the flames to melt away my pride. Do I want shelter from the rain or the rain to wash me away? I need you, I need you, I need you. I need you, I need you, I need you. You’re all I’m living for. I might sound like a fool, but I think I felt you moving closer to me. Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut. I fight the weight, I feel you lift me up. You are the shelter from the rain and the rain to wash me away. I need you, I need you, I need you. I need you, I need you, I need you. You’re all I’m living for. Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut. I fight the weight, I feel you lift me up. I can’t deny it burns me up inside. I fan the flames to melt away my pride. I only had a second to spare, but all the time in the world to know you’re there. You are the shelter from the rain and the rain to wash me away. I need you, I need you, I need you. You’re all I’m living for. I need you, I need you, I need you. You’re all I’m living for.\n\nSILENCE\n\nTake, take till there’s nothing, nothing to turn to. Nothing when you get through. Won’t you break, scatter pieces of all I’ve been. Bowing to all I’ve been running to. I, I got a question, I got a question - Where are you? Did you leave me unbreakable? Leave me frozen? I’ve never felt so cold. I thought you were silent. I thought you left me for the wreckage and the waste. On an empty beach of faith. Was it true? Scream, deeper I wanna scream. I want you to hear me, I want you to find me. I want to believe but all I pray is wrong and all I claim is gone. I, I got a question, I got a question - Where are you? Where are you?\n\nSCARLET\n\nIf I was your love I would want only you. I’d lay at this alter, give all I am, all that is true. This old scarlet letter won’t keep me from holding you. And there is nothing you can do. Nothing you can do. For love I have scaled the face of these kingdom walls. So let down your hair, let our kiss make fools of them all. This old scarlet letter won¹t keep me from holding you. And there is nothing you can do. Nothing you can do.\n\nWHATEVER SHE WANTS\n\nAll her wants to fill a need. She wants to save you with her bandages after she makes you bleed. Like a vampire, parasite. Stretch the necks of her victims, she finds her prey in broad daylight. When you’re up, she’s down, down she’s up, it whips around. It’s the ride the way that she needs it. Whatever she wanted for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything. Kryptonite underneath; you used to be her superman, but now you’re fading, now you’re weak. Never how or why it worked to play the big lie. To dim the truth from causing wet eyes. Whatever she wanted, for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything.\n\nTHE ELEVENTH HOUR\n\nTrace the shape of my heart, till it becomes more familiar to your eyes. I’ve been lost without you, cold without your love. It’s taken days and nights to make me realize. Rescue me from waiting on this line. I won’t give up on giving you a chance to blow my mind. Let the eleventh hour quickly pass my by. I’ll find you when I think I’m out of time. Take the place of my heart, till I become a stranger to my life. I’ve been down without you, wrong without your love. In time will I be what you’re thinking of? Rescue me from waiting on this line. I won’t give up on giving you a chance to blow my mind. Let the eleventh hour quickly pass me by. I’ll find you when I think I’m out of time. I’ve been wrong without you, cold without your love. In time will I be what you’re thinking of?\n\nTHESE ORDINARY DAYS\n\nNot much for conversation, I still feel need to pray. Sometimes I get tired of walking through these ordinary days. If nothing else I get to see you even if we never speak. The harm of words is sometimes we don’t know quite what they really mean. I don’t know where, I don’t know how. I don’t know why, but your love can make these things better. Let me lay down in this field and stare up at the sky. I hope the days and clouds turn into something as they pass us by. Maybe you could settle for a skyline faded blue. I hope that you might settle for this love I have for you. I don’t know where, I don’t know how. I don’t know why, but your love can make these things better. Your love can make these things better. Your love can make these things better."
