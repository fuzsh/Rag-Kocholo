        "text": "Eleventh Hour Films has optioned the author C.M. Ewan’s (The Interview, A Window Breaks) new thriller The House Hunt for a limited series adaptation.\n\nThe House Hunt centers on the story of a young couple, Lucy and Sam, who are selling their house. Although Lucy has been clear that she will not take any viewings while she is alone, her real estate agent insists. The events spiral.\n\nAlongside Ewan, Eleventh Hour’s creative director Paula Cuddy, executive producer and head of talent Eve Gutierrez, and CEO Jill Green are set to serve as executive producers on the adaptation.\n\nCuddy and Gutierrez commented: “Hot on the heels of our event drama series The Killing Kind coming to Paramount+ U.K. in September, we were searching for our next event thriller, and the manuscript of The House Hunt reeled us in. Chris takes a relatable, ordinary situation and masterfully tilts it on a knife-edge, delivering a tense and gripping story that twists and turns to the very end. We can’t wait to bring it to screen and produce a nerve-shredding rollercoaster ride for audiences.”\n\nEwan added: “Every writer dreams of finding a great partner for a TV adaptation of their work, and I knew from the first moment that Eleventh Hour Films expressed interest in The House Hunt that they were the perfect team to develop my book with all the vision and flair I could hope for. The quality dramas that Eleventh Hour Films is responsible for speak for themselves, and I’m incredibly excited about their enthusiasm and vision for The House Hunt.”"
