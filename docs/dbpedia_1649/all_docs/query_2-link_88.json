        "text": "The show revolves around the reporters and producers at a fictional television news magazine series, The Eleventh Hour. Unhappy with the news magazine's shrinking audience, the network has brought in a new executive producer, Kennedy Marsh, to reorient the show in a more ratings-driven tabloid journalism direction. The tension between the ratings imperative and the more traditional journalistic ethics of the show's senior staff is the primary conflict that drives the show, but story lines also include the team's efforts to get the stories that will make it to air each week."
