        "text": "Type 1: MMI ethical scenario questions\n\nEthnical scenario questions—often the most stressful for applicants—are designed to test how you respond to a high-pressure and morally challenging situation. They’re not aimed to check whether or not your personal ethical compass is pointing true north. Rather, they’re meant to see how you process a difficult situation. Interviewers will ask themselves questions like:\n\nDo you display care and deliberation?\n\nWhat questions do you ask?\n\nHow calm do you remain?\n\nDo you get flustered?\n\nDo you have a process for facing down challenges?\n\nYou might be asked about scenarios that you’ll encounter in the future as a physician—a patient in a persistent vegetative state, for instance. But not every question has to do with healthcare. You could also be asked about scenarios that involve your role as a citizen or in personal relationships.\n\nThe University of Washington Department of Bioethics and Humanities runs an ethics in medicine website that's a valuable resource for gaining exposure to these varied issues. With topics like confidentiality and dealing with diverse beliefs, it can help you bolster your knowledge of potential ethical scenario questions for the MMI.\n\nIt is impossible to prepare for every potential question that you could run into during your interview, but you can follow a step-by-step process to ensure you have a strong framework for evaluating any situation an MMI might throw at you.\n\nHow to answer an MMI ethical scenario question\n\nHere’s our suggested process:\n\nStep 1: Brainstorm. You’ll have two minutes outside the interview room to consider what the prompt is trying to test you on.\n\nWe’ll go through many practice scenarios below, but here’s one we’ll follow as we explain the brainstorming process:\n\nYou are a physician who has been taking care of a 45-year-old Native American man who has three teenage children. He has been on dialysis for five years and is now in dire need of a kidney transplant. Fortunately, he is now near the top of the list and is called into the hospital for tests. He then decides to go home to partake in a healing ceremony, a tradition that is very important to him and his family, after hearing this great news; however, after he has left you receive word that a kidney has become available. What do you do?\n\nHere’s how to think through the scenario during your brainstorming time:\n\nIdentify the key factors that you need to think about in order to answer the question. Some prompts may be filled with extraneous information that is unnecessary to your answer or understanding of the scenario. You must be able to focus on what is most important in these situations. In the case above, the most important factors are:\n\nThe kidney transplant is ready to go immediately.\n\nThe patient has already left to partake in a healing ceremony.\n\nThe information that he is a long-term patient of yours, has three children, and was just at the hospital are unimportant to your understanding of the scenario.\n\nDefine the primary problem. There may be secondary or tertiary problems in a given prompt, but your answer must address the primary issue at hand. Most primary problems are complex enough to take up the full eight minutes in order to properly address; however, if you have time, you can choose to discuss the other issues, but it is unnecessary to do so.\n\nIn the case above, you could easily get stuck on the following issues:\n\nWho cleared the man to go attend a healing ceremony?\n\nIs it OK for him to not be monitored before his kidney transplant?\n\nDoes the healing ceremony entail anything that might hurt his chances of a successful kidney transplant or increase his probability for organ rejection?\n\nAlthough all of these questions are important, the primary problem of this scenario can be determined by using the key factors discussed above. The primary problem boils down to this: What do you do if you tell your patient that a kidney is ready for immediate transplant but he refuses because he hasn’t participated in his healing ceremony yet?\n\nSome follow-up thoughts that you may want to address after answering the primary question/follow-up questions that may be asked by your evaluator include:\n\nIs his health more important than his culture and autonomy?\n\nWhat if he decides to get the transplant but the rest of his family is opposed because he hasn’t had the healing ceremony yet?\n\nStep 2: In the MMI. Once you’ve gotten inside the interview room, you can begin the actual process of playing out the scenario.\n\nCollect information. Now it’s time to either begin asking the actor in front of you questions, or, in the case of a non-acting scenario in which you cannot interact with an individual to gather more data, to make educated assumptions aloud. In the latter case, you will most likely have to include both sides of the situation, ultimately giving two different answers. In the example above, you might say:\n\nIf I told the patient that a kidney was ready for immediate transplant and he refused, I would ask why? It is important to note that this is nonjudgmental and will just help me understand his thought process. After hearing his answer, I would do my best to educate him on why I believe he needs to come back to the hospital and get the transplant immediately. If he still refuses, I would then confirm that he understood everything that I said, so I know that he is making a well-educated decision on this important choice that he is making…\n\n(This is just a short excerpt of what your answer should look like. We’ll provide full-length answers later.)\n\nMake a decision. At the end of the day, you must make a decision as the “doctor.” Ambivalence will not do. The decision you make should fall between two different potential extremes, or in the grey zone when black and white answers are possibilities.\n\nWe will now jump into two full-length examples of how to apply this step-by-step process in answering practice questions, one acting and one non-acting.\n\nMMI ethical scenario: acting example\n\nNote that actors will have different demeanors depending on how a given school directs them to behave. Some actors might be rude or non-cooperative patients, whereas others will be pleasant and easy. Prepare yourself for both situations.\n\nHere’s the prompt:\n\nYou are a pediatrician working in a small-sized community at a county hospital. Your second patient of the day is a 14-year-old girl whom you have taken care of since she was a young child. You know her parents very well. During her physical exam, her dad leaves the room. As you finish the exam and are about to call her father back in, she asks you for birth control pills. She requests that you do not tell her parents. What do you do?\n\nStep 1: Identify key factors.\n\nKey factors in this scenario include:\n\nA physician must have the patient’s best interest in mind\n\nA physician must respect the patient’s autonomy\n\nThe importance of the patient’s age\n\nThe first two should be considered in every situation. As a physician, your focus should always be on how to best take care of your patient while respecting their autonomy. But for this case, that first principle is complicated by age. If the patient was 18 or older, she would be considered an adult and able to make her own medical decisions without a parent’s consent.\n\nSo how will you navigate the balance between the patient’s autonomy and her age?\n\nStep 2: Define the problem.\n\nHere’s our primary question: Do I give a minor birth control pills without parental consent?\n\nBelow, we have italicized the parts of the prompt that are important; you should be doing this mentally for every prompt that you see before you enter the room and begin interacting with the actress.\n\nYou are a physician working in a small-sized community at a county hospital. Your second patient of the day is a 14-year-old girl who you have taken care of since she was a young child, and you know her parents very well. During her physical exam, her dad leaves the room. As you finish up the exam and are about to call her father back in, she asks you for birth control pills. Additionally, she requests that you do not tell her parents. What do you do?\n\nAfter identifying the key factors in the question, the prompt is reduced to the following: You are a pediatrician, a 14-year-old girl asks you for birth control pills. She requests that you do not tell her parents. What do you do?\n\nStep 3: Collect information.\n\nNow that you’ve identified the key factors and defined the problem, it’s time to collect additional information pertaining to this specific situation\n\nBecause you’re in an acting scenario, you can ask questions. In fact, you should not make assumptions about the patient. Avoid sounding judgmental. Your goal is to find out more information while being supportive.\n\nHere are some good questions to ask:\n\nWhat do you know about safe sex?\n\nAre you, or have you been, sexually active?\n\nIf she has been or currently is: Have you or are you practicing safe sex?\n\nWhat do you know about the birth control pill?\n\nDo you know about the side effects of the birth control pill?\n\nWhy do you want to have birth control pill?\n\nDo you plan on using protection or only birth control?\n\nWhy don’t you want your parents to know? (Ask this last: You want to gain trust and understanding about the patient before jumping to the patient’s family life.)\n\nStep 4: Make a decision.\n\nNow that you have data, let’s go over how you’re going to make your decision now. Remember, your answer should fall between two extreme possibilities:\n\nExtreme option 1: Don’t give her the birth control pills. However, this would bring up the following issues:\n\nNo respect for patient autonomy.\n\nYou would blatantly be rejecting her request, which may cause further issues and points to a lack of trust.\n\nExtreme option 2: Give her the pills without asking questions or wanting to know why she requests them. This would present issues such as:\n\nWhat is best for the patient isn’t always what the patient wants. In this case, even if you give her the pills, prescribing birth control without proper education shows a severe lack of responsibility. Even if birth control pills are taken correctly, they do not block 100% of all pregnancies.\n\nThe pills do nothing to protect against STIs.\n\nAnswer: Give her the pills after asking questions, making sure she understands what they are used for, how to use them, what safe sex looks like, and so forth. This option respects the patient’s autonomy while looking out for the patient’s best interest.\n\nThe word-for-word answer you give will differ depending on the level of knowledge the patient currently has (such as if she knows what birth control does, what safe sex is, if she will decide to use protection, etc.). You may also want to give her time to think about her decision if you find that she is uncertain after being informed of the information that you’ve told her.\n\nWhat makes this an effective response: By discussing what the pills are used for, how they are used, and safe sex practices, the physician demonstrated that the patient’s best interests are the top priority. Though she is a minor, the patient still has a right to bodily autonomy and this response shows respect for that. Furthermore, by engaging with the patient under these circumstances, the physician has shown themself to be someone the patient can trust, which will be important as other issues may arise.\n\nIt shouldn't take very long to state your decision! Be clear and concise and explain your thought process.\n\nMMI ethical scenario: non-acting example\n\nPrompt:\n\nA 20-year-old patient with Down syndrome has become pregnant. The patient does not want an abortion, but her mother and father want the patient to have an abortion. What should you do as the physician taking care of this patient?\n\nThis question is on the more difficult end of the spectrum, but the same concepts used in the first example can be applied here as well. Let’s walk through the step-by-step process once again and see how to answer this question correctly.\n\nStep 1: Identify key factors.\n\nA physician must have the patient’s best interest in mind\n\nA physicians must respect their patient’s autonomy\n\nThe importance of the patient’s competency\n\nThe biggest factor here is the competency of the patient because they have Down syndrome.\n\nStep 2: Define the problem.\n\nThis is the question: Do I side with the patient and allow her to keep the baby or do I side with the parents and allow an abortion?\n\nThe case would be quite simple for a patient without Down syndrome. Given that the patient is 20 years old, she should be able to make her own medical decisions without a parent’s consent.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, your main objective should be to determine if the patient is competent or not. (Note that being legally dependent is not the same as being deemed competent to make medical decisions.) This will determine if you will side with the patient or the parents. This prompt is short and to the point, so you do not have to worry about any extraneous information.\n\nStep 3: Collect information.\n\nFor non-acting scenarios, you will have to discuss your entire thought process because you will not be able to ask questions to narrow down the specifics of the situation. You’ll be sitting across from an interviewer with no other individuals to interact with in the room.\n\nWe recommend talking through both sides of the situation in your answer. Below is an example script for doing so.\n\nI would first start off by talking to the patient and asking why she would want to keep the baby. Depending on her answer, I would then follow-up by asking her if she understands what it means for her if she were to keep the child.\n\nDoes she understand what it means to be pregnant and what truly becoming a mother entails? Is she fantasizing about the idea of potentially being a mom and having a baby without understanding the responsibilities? Or does she understand how difficult the transition may be—physically, mentally, and lifestyle-wise?\n\nUltimately, her answers will help me determine if she is truly competent and understands the situation, or if she is deemed incompetent to make her own medical decision. This is really important to understand because Down syndrome is on a spectrum-scale, and everyone is unique.\n\nI would then ask the parents questions after talking to their daughter alone. I would start by asking them to tell me about their daughter: What does her day-to-day life look like? Do they believe she is competent enough to make her own decision? Does their daughter really understand what is going on? The answers to these questions will further provide me a more well-rounded understanding of the patient’s Down syndrome.\n\nI would then move on to ask why they don’t want their daughter to continue with the pregnancy. Chances are, the parents will restate that the patient isn’t competent or independent enough to take care of the child on her own. They might say that they would end up taking care of the newborn and that they no longer have the energy or maybe even the money to support an extra mouth with their current financial situation.\n\nOr maybe they are worried that a pregnancy for a Down syndrome individual would be dangerous to their daughter’s life. It is important to understand that there could be a large variety of answers that are given to these questions and as a physician, I need to be able to listen to their concerns.\n\nFinally, I would ask them why they believe their daughter wants to keep the child if we hadn’t yet covered this.\n\nAfter talking to the parents separately, I would then go back to the child and ask if she grasped why her parents were against keeping the child. Then, with all the questions and responses I’ve gained, I would be able to determine if the patient is competent or not. My decision would be based on the competence of the patient.\n\nThere are, of course, always many other factors to consider in the real world, such as malpractice suits and the logistics of delivering care. But know that in the MMI scenario, you’re looking to genuinely determine the human aspects of the case.\n\nIs the patient competent or not competent in this case? That’s what you need to focus on.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision.\n\nNow that you’ve covered your bases on both sides of the situation, it’s time to make your decision. Again, this will come at the end of your data collection process and shouldn’t take long to state.\n\nSimilar to acting scenarios, the answer will fall in between two extremes. However, unlike the acting scenario, most non-acting scenarios will have two answers between the two extremes, given that there are two sides that could be “right” in a situation. Let’s take a look at the options:\n\nExtreme option 1: Siding only with the parents with little to no reason. However, this would show a lack of respect for patient autonomy. You would blatantly be rejecting the patient’s request in order to avoid conflict with her parents.\n\nExtreme option 2: Siding only with the patient with little to no reason. The problem with this answer is that you wouldn’t be looking out for the patient’s best interest or safety. If she were deemed not competent to make her own medical decisions, allowing her to follow her wishes would be detrimental to her health and that of the infant. Again: what the patient wants is not always best for them.\n\nAnswer: Make your decision based on the patient’s competence. If you deem the patient competent, side with them. If you deem the patient not competent to make her own medical decisions, side with the parent.\n\nHere’s another sample script:\n\nBased on the discussion that I’ve had with the patient and parents, if I deemed the patient competent, I would advise keeping the baby. My role as a physician is to provide the best care to the patient and respect her autonomy. If she is a competent adult, the patient’s wishes take priority of her parent’s in this case.\n\nHowever, if I were to deem the patient not competent enough to make her own medical decisions, I would side with the parents and allow for an abortion. In this case, the patient cannot truly understand the situation and having the baby would not be in her best interest.\n\nWhat makes this an effective response: In this situation, the respondent was not provided an actor to work with, so they had to think out loud to emphasize a clear understanding of the biggest issue at hand: patient competency. This stream of consciousness highlights the interactions that would take place with both the parents and the patient, and it shows an awareness of their conflicting desires while keeping any judgmental thoughts out of the picture. Additionally, it addresses the patient’s unique circumstance by acknowledging that not all patients with Down syndrome are the same and it specifies the considerations in this particular case.\n\nNote that interviewers will continue asking you questions until time runs out—they’ll fill the full eight minutes. If you finish the primary question early, they will ask follow-up questions—rebuttals are meant to put you on edge.\n\nAs long as you have covered both sides of the story and relied on logic, be confident and collected! Take a moment to think, smile, and answer the questions presented to you. For the second example, a follow up could be: “If you allow the patient to keep the baby, how would you handle the parent’s reactions? What if they are mad? What would you do in this situation?”\n\nRemember: the questions aren’t implying that you’re wrong. The interviewer is just trying to find out more about how you would react in a difficult situation. Plus, your ability to maintain composure in the stress of an interview speaks about your ability to be professional and confident.\n\nWe’ve given you a highly organized script above, but your response will likely be more fluid in real life. The lines between the third and fourth step may blur—that’s fine!\n\n----\n\nType 2: MMI character development questions\n\nHow to answer MMI character development questions: non-acting\n\nYou’ll likely be familiar with questions like these from traditional one-on-one interviews, but they’ll feel different when delivered in an MMI context. You will still be given two minutes outside the room to prepare and eight minutes inside the room with an interviewer. But you may be able to relax a bit more in these rooms because these types of questions tend to come from the standard interview book.\n\nBe prepared to answer questions like, “What is your greatest weakness?” and “Tell me about a time when you made a mistake.”\n\nIt is expected and crucial that you draw from your past experiences to answer these questions. Admission committees don’t want to see generic answers to these personal questions. So prepare some personal anecdotes to illustrate your character traits rather than speaking in the abstract.\n\nLet’s go into more detail on the two common questions above.\n\n“What is your greatest weakness?”\n\nQuestions about weaknesses are always difficult to answer. Do I tell them I have a weakness? Do I turn a weakness into a strength? Do I make up a weakness?\n\nAlways admit that you have a weakness. Admissions committees don’t want individuals who are too proud or scared to admit their flaws.\n\nAlways discuss a legitimate weakness. Never give a made-up or almost nonexistent weakness that doesn’t affect you as a human being. You’re not just “too hard-working” or “too nice.”\n\nAt the same time, never offer a weakness that may automatically dismiss you, i.e. “I crack under pressure.”\n\nAlways talk about how you are working on your weakness. This last step is crucial. It’s great that you know your weaknesses, but have you done anything about it? This part shows the admission committee that you are motivated to improve yourself.\n\nSome schools will not allow you to state your weakness but will ask you to choose from a list in the room. You might encounter a paper with many “negative” words (for example: pessimistic, stubborn, greedy, forgetful, impatient, selfish, nervous, oversensitive, resentful, temperamental) and you’ll be asked to circle a few that describe you. You might also encounter a paper with many “positive” words (positive, honest, loyal, respectful, empathetic, responsible, humble, forgiving, kind, optimistic) and you’ll be asked to circle a few that least describe you.\n\nIf you have extra time or if something you said doesn’t make sense to the interviewer, you may be allowed to follow up. You should explain:\n\nWhy you circled a particular word\n\nHow it appears in your life\n\nHow you have tried to fix it\n\nHow you will continue to grow past this weakness.\n\nIf you happen to find your pre-planned weakness on a list, great! If not, don’t freak out. The same principles apply!\n\nHere’s an example that answers this character development question:\n\n“Pessimistic” immediately stood out to me when I saw the paper. In the past, I’ve struggled with things like assuming the worst outcome would happen or automatically assigning negative intentions to other people’s actions, which has resulted in misunderstandings that, in retrospect, could have been avoided. Another symptom of my pessimism is that I’ve sometimes felt hesitant to enter new situations because I’ve baselessly assumed I wouldn’t enjoy them, like when I kept declining my roommate’s invitation to go rock climbing because I assumed it would be boring. Fast-forward six months to when she practically strong-armed me into going—it turns out I love rock climbing, and now I can’t imagine not hitting the climbing gym at least once a week. Little situations like this gradually made me wonder what else I had been missing out on and led me to actively work on not jumping to conclusions. Now when I feel a pessimistic thought rising in me, I remind myself to keep an open mind and to remember that things usually turn out better than I think they will. Something that’s really helped me is keeping an “optimism journal” in which I write down pros and cons for situations I’m feeling negatively about. For every con I can think of, I force myself to also write down a pro, which has helped me keep a more balanced perspective. I admit that pessimism can still challenge me on occasion, but I’ve found that consciously trying to adjust my thought patterns has opened my life to opportunities that I might have otherwise missed and more trusting, empathetic relationships.\n\n“Tell me about a time when you made a mistake.”\n\nYou’ll approach this question with a similar method as the “weakness” prompt. But in this case, you need to pick a story that accurately conveys a weakness—one you’ve worked to improve since!\n\n“What is your greatness weakness?” asks you to name your trait first. “Tell me about a time when you a made a mistake,” on the flip side, requires you to tell a story to demonstrate a weakness. They both get the interviewer similar information, but you must follow inverse structures in responding.\n\nIn this case, keep the scenario as simple as possible. Excessive details can clutter and confuse the evaluator. The purpose of your story is not to tell an intricate narrative. Your story should be a platform that you use to explain a mistake, show how you dealt with the mistake, what you learned, and how you’ve grown since.\n\nHere’s a process—it’s very similar to the response we’ve suggested for “What is your greatest weakness?”\n\nAlways offer a story that can be linked to a character trait. The story is meant to show something intrinsic about you, not just to demonstrate a random fumble.\n\nAlways give a true story that accurately portrays a genuine mistake.\n\nAlways talk about the consequences of your mistake. It helps ground the story and will allow you to better discuss the ways in which you’ve grown since.\n\nNever provide a story that would automatically dismiss you as a candidate.\n\nNever make excuses for your mistake/behavior.\n\nAlways talk about what you learned, what you did to fix the problem, how you have changed, and are continuously working to make yourself better\n\nHere’s a sample response that works:\n\nSophomore year, I decided to get involved with my university’s student-run environmentalism center. I’ve been interested in environmentalism and sustainability since I was in high school, and after I learned about the work that the organization was doing, I was inspired to join. After a couple of months, I was asked if I could help lead a campus educational campaign about reducing water use. Long story short: due to stress from my course load that semester and the fact that organization has never been my strong suit, I accidentally wrote down the wrong date for a crucial grant deadline with our student affairs office. This resulted in the environmentalism center not receiving the funding it needed to create materials for the campaign. I felt awful and embarrassed—it was my first big project with the center, and on top of that, reducing water use was an issue I felt passionately about, having grown up in a desert environment. After I realized that there was no way we’d be able to pull off the campaign we’d initially imagined, I quickly switched gears and moved the campaign online exclusively, so that the cost of overhead would be much lower. The project actually turned out better than I’d imagined, and I’m proud of the way our members came together to execute a solution. That said, I learned a valuable lesson in attending to details and staying organized, which has actually improved the way I do things in both my academic and personal life. You can bet I always triple-check my dates now.\n\nHow to answer MMI character development questions: acting\n\nThese questions are not testing you on making ethical decisions; rather, they assess how you deal with difficult situations that you may run into during your time in medicine or in life outside of medicine.\n\nYou might be asked to simulate a difficult conversation with a family member or a friend, for instance. In these cases, you can follow the same general rubrics as above, taking care to respect the other person’s personal values while maintaining a basic moral standard yourself. The best way to prepare for these is to reflect on times you’ve had to make tough ethical decisions and to ensure you know what your core values are and how you weight them.\n\nThe answer to these questions will give insight into how you have acted or will act in the future in these situations. As long as you are empathetic and respectful, these questions should answer themselves. Again, these questions should be easier than the other two types of questions in this category because you’ve probably faced similar situations before in your life.\n\nMMI character development: acting example\n\nPrompt:\n\nYou have promised your best friend that you would attend their wedding; however, the day before the wedding, your dad has a stroke and is hospitalized. Enter the room and talk to your friend.\n\nLike most character development acting questions, this prompt doesn’t involve reasoning through an especially difficult or thorny choice. Rather, the decision is simple or even self-evident. What’s tricky is delivering that decision in a way that conveys personal traits like compassion, respect, fairness, dependability, and so on.\n\nBefore you enter the room, you need to choose whether you’ll attend the wedding or skip it to be with your father. Think through each outcome. If you attend the wedding, you risk minimizing the severity of your father’s condition, which might reflect insensitivity and a lack of reliability as a family member. If you don’t attend the wedding, you risk upsetting your friend. While your friend might also feel that missing their wedding reflects unreliability, we believe that the majority of people would understand missing a wedding due to such a serious incident.\n\nThus, our goal in the conversation would be: convey to your friend that you won’t be able to attend the wedding, making sure to attend to the reality that they will likely be disappointed.\n\nHere’s one way to begin the conversation:\n\nI have some bad news. My dad had a stroke yesterday and is in the hospital. I’m really sorry to say this, but I need to go be with my dad, so I won’t be able to attend the wedding. I was so looking forward to seeing you get married and I’m incredibly sad to miss this important day, but I know you’ll have an amazing time and I can’t wait to celebrate with you another time.\n\nYou can take it from there depending on how the actor reacts, remembering to demonstrate compassion while adhering to your own standards.\n\nType 3: MMI teamwork questions\n\nAnother category of questions will ask you to prove yourself in a team environment. Whether you’re working with other physicians, PAs, nurses, or other members of the clinical team, as a future physician, you will never be working alone. Once you understand that admission committees are looking for team players, these scenarios are easily demystified.\n\nHere’s how they go. Depending on the school, you will either enter a room alone or with another applicant. You’re then responsible for completing a task—often building or assembling something—either alone or together. In the room, you might see a pre-built structure made of, for instance, Legos, K’Nex, or Jenga blocks, or a piece of paper with a design that only one person will see. The goal, in this case, might be to replicate the design, using only words.\n\nIf you’re alone in the room, your job will be to deliver instructions to your interviewer out loud. If you’re one of two people, you will probably give instructions once and receive instructions a second time so you undergo both experiences. (It’ll be with different partners; you won’t be working with the same person twice). In some cases, you might be in a room with a larger group, but following the strategy you’d follow with just one partner will work just fine then, too.\n\nIn both cases, you’ll face some constraints. You may not be able to look at your partner, or the words you can use might be limited (e.g. no colors, no shapes, etc). In total, you’ll have around six minutes to work together with the remaining two minutes used for follow-up questions by your evaluator. If there are two candidates in the room, there will be two evaluators—one for each of you.\n\nHere’s how to succeed in both roles, that of the instructor and that of the doer or performer.\n\nHow to answer MMI teamwork questions: instructor role\n\nThe instructor must lead the performer through the simulation. As the instructor, your goal is to work with your partner—either your interviewer/evaluator, who will be acting as the performer, or a fellow applicant—to replicate the design in front of you in the given timeframe.\n\nAs the instructor, keep the following things in mind:\n\nPut yourself in the performer’s shoes. What may seem very simple and common sense to you will be foreign and unknown to the performer. Are you being sensitive to the information imbalance between the two of you without being condescending?\n\nUse clear instructions and speak at a slow and steady pace. Giving complex directions or even multiple directions at any given time can be overwhelming to the performer. Treat the performer as if you are teaching someone a new skill, such as tying a pair of shoelaces.\n\nCheck in with the performer. Sometimes a confused performer may not ask questions for fear of holding the team back. As the instructor, you have an obligation to make sure your partner is not lost—whether or not they admit to being lost. Try saying, “Can you please tell me what you see in front of you, so we know that we’re on the same page?” This quote shows that you care about the performer’s understanding and demonstrates your willingness to work as a team. (Using “we” instead of “I” is a good way to help with that.)\n\nYou do not have to finish the project. No one will tell you this on interview days, but you are not being tested on whether or not you complete the task. We cannot stress this enough. Many candidates rush, thinking they need to finish to get a passing score. Admissions committees do not care about completion; they’re looking for a window into your communication and teamwork skills.\n\nHow to answer MMI teamwork questions: performer role\n\nThe performer will be working with the instructor to replicate the given design. If you are in the role of the performer, the instructor will likely be a fellow candidate.\n\nAs the performer, keep the following things in mind:\n\nActively ask clarifying questions. Do not get comfortable being confused. If something that the instructor says gives you any doubts or concerns, immediately ask them to repeat or clarify. Do not be afraid to ask the instructor to repeat directions multiple times if they are still confusing. Remember, you are both working together to complete the project, so do not feel that you are holding the team back. Not seeking help when you’re confused is a sign that you might be a passive person, or that you don’t prepare yourself to succeed.\n\nCheck in with your partner by asking, “Can I please tell you what I see in front of me right now, so that we know that we’re on the right track?” This shows that you are taking a proactive approach to working as a team.\n\nYou do not have to finish the project! Chances are, if you’re composed and relaxed, and your partner is rushing to finish (due to stress or anxiety), they will calm down. The calm individual sets the pace. If this isn’t the case, just do your best working with your partner while doing your role. It’s probably not a good call to explicitly say, “Calm down, we don’t need to finish.” Instead, say, “Let’s calm down and work together to get through as much of this as possible” is much better.\n\nMMI follow-up questions\n\nAfter you are given six minutes to work with your respective partner, there will be a two-minute period during which your evaluator will ask you a few questions. “How did you think you and your partner did?” “Why do you think the project was incomplete or had errors?”\n\nHere's a key trick: always speak positively about your partner’s performance and more critically about your own performance. Whatever the reason for the incompletion of the project or errors that occurred, never blame your partner and always reflect on how you could have done a better job in your respective role. Blaming your partner will result in immediately failing this station (no matter how poorly you think your partner did).\n\nAs a bonus, think about and mention how teamwork is important in your future success as a physician—no physician works alone."
