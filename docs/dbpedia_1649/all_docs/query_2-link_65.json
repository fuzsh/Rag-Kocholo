        "text": "Today we hear from Helion Partners’ Tom Manwaring about Sony Pictures Television’s acquisition of Alex Rider maker Eleventh Hour Films and why plenty more M&As on the horizon signals an industry in better health than many believe.\n\nTune in to C21FM by CLICKING HERE.\n\nSony Pictures Television recently took a majority stake in Eleventh Hour Films, the UK production company behind Anthony Horowitz adaptations including Alex Rider, Magpie Murders and Foyle’s War and a string of other series.\n\nThe deal was facilitated by Helion Partners’ Tom Manwaring, who also helped steer Sony’s initial minority investment in 2018, plus the studio’s acquisition of Sex Education maker Eleven Film in 2020.\n\nThe Eleventh Hour transaction will see company founder Jill Green transition to creative executive producer and chairperson, while head of talent and exec producer Eve Gutierrez and creative director Paula Cuddy are appointed co-CEOs.\n\nManwaring spoke to Jonathan Webdale about the deal, why there is plenty more M&A activity on the horizon and why this signals an industry in better health than many may believe. He also spoke about the challenges facing US studio giants like Warner Bros Discovery and UK broadcaster Channel 4, plus his surprise at Sony having been in the running to acquire Paramount."
