        "text": "Time was when Sir Mick Davis was a hulking presence around the boardroom.\n\nTipping the scales at 22 stone, the fastened buttons on his Canali suits shrieked for mercy.\n\nSmall wonder he was known among the tight-knit mining community as ‘Big Mick’.\n\nToday, Sir Mick is almost unrecognisable from that gusset-busting period. Sure, the straggly grey whiskers and the John-Lennon specs remain, as does that glacial stare, but the Davis girth is now a thing of the past.\n\nI am not breaking any confidences by saying it was trouble with type 2 diabetes which prompted the radical change in appearance. Davis achieved this the old fashioned way – he ate less, gave the bottle a swerve and hopped on a bicycle.\n\nHe may be diminished physically, but friends say the steely South African has lost none of his energy, nor verve for dealmaking which has defined a career in which he’s raised more than £25bn from global capital markets and has completed more than £90bn of corporate transactions.\n\nReports claim this week he is being stalked as the next chairman of mining giant Rio Tinto, a move that would mark a dramatic return to the natural resources industry’s front line.\n\nIt also sets up a renewed showdown with his compatriot Ivan Glasenberg, the helium-voiced boss of Glencore with whom he’s been on non-speakers for nearly five years.\n\nThe fall-out came during Glencore’s mega–merger with Sir Mick’s mining firm Xstrata back in 2013.\n\nWhat began as a £50bn merger of equals, where Davis would have become Glasenberg’s boss, turned into a full-blown takeover at the 11th hour when Glencore made an improved offer for shares in return for new conditions.\n\nThe details are complicated, but the end result saw Davis out on his ear and Glasenberg in supreme charge of the new company.\n\nThe drama had added spice as Davis and Glasenberg were old acquaintances. Their rivalry goes back to their school days in South Africa, where Davis was raised in Port Elizabeth.\n\nOne of three brothers, he enjoyed a comfortable Jewish upbringing. He studied accountancy at Rhodes University for no other reason, he says, than it seemed a good way to make money, before landing a job with accountants Peat Marwick.\n\nAfter a stint as finance director of Eskom, South Africa’s national power company, he became chief financial officer of South African conglomerate Gencor in 1997. He helped list the firm in London, renamed Billiton, and played a key role in merging it with Australia’s BHP in 2001, creating the world’s largest mining company.\n\nIn 2001, restless for a top job, he went off to be boss of Xstrata. Back then it was just a small, debt-laden firm, but thanks to Davis’s brilliance for mergers and acquisitions, within a decade it had swelled into a £40bn company. Given his friendship with Glasenberg, and Glencore’s sizeable stake in Xstrata, it seemed only natural the firms would eventually merge, though, as we now know, it didn’t pan out the way Davis originally hoped.\n\nNot that Sir Mick left empty-handed. He walked away with nearly £75m in cash and share options. He and wife Barbara decided to remain with their three children in London, where they’re fixtures on the charity circuit. Free time is spent at the cricket (he’s a qualified umpire) and the opera.\n\nWorkwise, Davis set up mining fund X2 Resources. He’s very worried about a Jeremy Corbyn government, so has also thrown his weight behind the Conservatives, becoming the party’s treasurer and, lately, chief executive.\n\nDoubtless Davis would toss that all in for a tilt at the Rio Tinto job. If it comes off, you can be sure he’s going to go looking for his old friend Glasenberg, with a view to taking over Glencore.\n\nStocky Ivan will certainly be primed for a fight. The mining industry may need to brace itself for some heavy tremors."
