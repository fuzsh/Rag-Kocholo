        "text": "Sword-flinging series Spartacus and Game Of Thrones have been doing rather well for their respective cable channels both in the US and around the world. Across the gulf of television, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded their ratings and press coverage with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against them. Okay, so not “against them” per se, but some of the people involved in Braveheart are looking to muscle in on that sweet battle action by spearheading a TV version.\n\nMick Davis, who worked on short-lived series Eleventh Hour, has created the new show, drawn from an idea by Kent Dalian and Seoras Wallace, who worked on Mel Gibson’s 1995 Oscar winner.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter{ =nofollow}, the planned series, which is still only in development, will focus on William Wallace’s back-story, his lovelife and his battles with both Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan in the film) and Robert the Bruce. No network is attached yet, but Davis has the support of STV Productions.\n\n\"This was a turbulent time in Scotland’s history, in which William Wallace had a starring and pivotal role,\" STV Director of Content Alan Clements said in a statement. \"We plan to delve deep into his character and explore his passions, bringing parts of history to life in a spectacular and raw depiction. With all eyes on Scotland in the current political climate, this also seems to be a very appropriate time to tell this story in more depth.\"\n\nIt won’t surprise you to learn that the focus will be on the elements that have made other shows so popular. So blood, boobs, weapons and warriors, then. With hopefully some good writing and acting thrown into the mix..."
