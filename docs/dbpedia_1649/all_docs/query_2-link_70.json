Within two years, Eleventh Hour Enigma has emerged as one of the top-rated venues in the United States.\n\nMel finds joy in the excitement of players enjoying the immersive games. Outside work, she restores historic homes and cherishes family time. Mel playfully likens herself to a Saint Bernard, a breed she has lovingly cared for since college, admiring their loyal and nurturing traits.\n\nDarby was raised on a horse ranch near Bartlesville, where he developed a deep love for animals and the outdoors. He attended Oklahoma State University with the ambition of becoming a large animal vet. However, a combination of college jobs and a lack of enthusiasm for chemistry prompted him to shift his focus. He ultimately changed majors and found his true calling in home building.\n\nAs COO, Darby is responsible for overseeing the construction of our intricate sets and props, ensuring repairs are handled efficiently, and providing training for Game Masters. His role is pivotal in crafting immersive environments that captivate players and elevate their experience. Additionally, Darby serves as Vice President at a well-known local home builder, where he continues to nurture his passion for creating homes and enriching the community.\n\nWhen he’s not working, Darby enjoys spending quality time with his family, visiting the horse ranch to reconnect with his roots, and engaging in relaxing conversations with his saltwater fish.\n\nJan grew up in Kansas and pursued a degree in Accounting at Emporia College. Her academic journey took an unexpected turn when she fell for a handsome football player and decided to focus on raising a family. After dedicating time to her family, Jan returned to her passion for numbers, spending 35 years working for a prominent local oil and gas company.\n\nAs the Chief Financial Officer at Eleventh Hour Enigma, Jan brings extensive financial expertise, allowing Mel and Darby to concentrate on creating and building captivating escape experiences. Her role is crucial in managing finances and supporting the team’s creative endeavors.\n\nOutside of work, Jan enjoys tending to her plants and her cat, Phoenix. She cherishes time spent with family, especially lounging by the pool with loved ones from both near and far.\n\nMeet Lindsey, a versatile member of Eleventh Hour Enigma who proudly wears many hats, with her favorite being House Manager. A history fanatic, Lindsey was captivated by the escape experiences offered by Eleventh Hour Enigma, prompting her to apply for a position. Joining the team in the fall of 2019 as a Game Master, she honed her skills in puzzles and delivering exceptional customer experiences. Lindsey's greatest joy in her role stems from connecting with wonderful people and witnessing the return of enthusiastic customers. When she's not at Eleventh Hour Enigma, you might find her savoring a quality cup of coffee while exploring her favorite antique stores."
