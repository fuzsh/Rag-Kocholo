        "text": "US studio Sony Pictures Television (SPT) has increased its investment in UK scripted production company Eleventh Hour Films to a majority stake.\n\nAs part of the move, Eleventh Hour founder and CEO Jill Green will move to the position of creative executive producer and chairperson in September, where she will provide strategic support to the management team and exec produce certain dramas, including leading those written by Anthony Horowitz. These include upcoming mystery thriller Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue for MGM+ and the BBC.\n\nIn addition, head of talent and exec producer Eve Gutierrez and creative director Paula Cuddy have been promoted to co-CEOs of the company with immediate effect, while Sarah Woolway has joined the firm in the newly created role of chief commercial officer.\n\nWoolway was previously head of business and legal affairs at French studio Gaumont’s UK office for two years, before which she worked at BBC Studios for 18 years across a number of business areas including international channels, with a stint at BBC America.\n\nFormed in 2010, Eleventh Hour Films’ credits include Magpie Murders and upcoming sequel Moonflower Murders for PBS Masterpiece and the BBC; the reimagining of the Rebus crime detective novels for the BBC; thriller The Killing Kind for Paramount+ UK; and three seasons of spy series Alex Rider, adapted from Horowitz’s books.\n\nSPT took a minority stake in the prodco in 2018. The increased investment means Eleventh Hour Films is the fourth majority-owned, UK-based scripted company in the SPT International Production group, alongside Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven.\n\nSPT said the investment is part of its strategy of consolidating its portfolio and that it will spur the next phase of Eleventh Hour Films’ strategic growth, “deepening its collaborative ties with SPT and consolidating the company’s reputation for producing must-see, high-end television shows with range and reach, for a worldwide market.”"
