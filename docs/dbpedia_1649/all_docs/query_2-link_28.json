        "text": "Sony Pictures Television-backed Eleventh Hour Films has announced that writer, director, and producer Zara Hayes (‘The Killing Kind’, ‘Showtrial’) has joined the company as an executive producer and writer to originate a new slate of projects.\n\nFollowing the launch earlier this month of Eleventh Hour’s thriller ‘The Killing Kind’ on Paramount+ UK, which Hayes co-wrote, directed and served as an executive producer on, this role will “incorporate her formative documentary experience to broaden and embolden the company’s scripted slate.”\n\nIn 2021 she directed ‘Showtrial’ for BBC One, a five-part legal thriller about a young woman accused of murder. Her feature ‘Poms’, starring Diane Keaton and Jacki Weaver, was widely theatrically released across the US by STX Films in 2019. Previously Hayes directed the critically acclaimed Billie Jean King feature documentary ‘Battle of the Sexes’. Her documentary work includes the National Geographic event series ‘Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist’, executive produced and narrated by Sigourney Weaver; ‘Captive’ for Netflix, executive produced by Doug Liman about the murky world of hostage-taking; ‘12 Year Old Lifer’ for Channel 4; and ‘Clothes To Die For’ on BBC Two.\n\nPaula Cuddy and Eve Gutierrez from Eleventh Hour Films said, “This relationship is born out of the fantastic creative experience we had collaborating with Zara on ‘The Killing Kind’, and it will channel her curiosity for the world into developing a new slate of projects with us. We will be primarily focusing on developing scripted ideas together but are also excited about the idea of crossing the line into the world of factual and exploring how the factual can inspire great drama for audiences”.\n\nZara Hayes adds, “I greatly enjoyed collaborating with Eleventh Hour Films on ‘The Killing Kind’ – I admire their global ambition and fresh attitude towards making television. I can’t wait to see where this path leads, and develop a slate that reflects my diverse interests and builds upon my background in directing both drama and documentary.”\n\nZara Hayes is repped by Georgina Carrigan at United Agents and Abe Cohen-Hoffing at WME.\n\nJon Creamer\n\nShare this story"
