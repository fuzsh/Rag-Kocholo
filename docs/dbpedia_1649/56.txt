More pilot season coverage

In an indication that CBS’ pilot “Eleventh Hour” is headed to series, “Sleeper Cell” creators Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff have been tapped as executive producers/showrunners of the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced drama.

“Hour,” from Bruckheimer TV, Warner Bros. TV and Granada TV, is based on the British limited sci-fi series and stars Rufus Sewell as a special science adviser to the government who, with his feisty female bodyguard Rachel (Marley Shelton) in tow, saves people from the worst abuses of science.

“CSI” visual mastermind Danny Cannon is directing the pilot from a script by feature scribe Mick Davis.

“Hour” has been rumored to go to series since September, when CBS picked up the pilot with a penalty said to amount to a 13-episode production commitment. On the potential series, Voris and Reiff will serve as exec producers alongside Davis, Cannon, Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman and a Granada executive.

“Hour” falls under Voris and Reiff’s overall deal with WBTV. It also extends their relationship with Bruckheimer and CBS. Earlier this development season, the duo penned a treasure-hunting drama for WBTV and Bruckheimer TV, which landed at CBS with a put pilot commitment (HR 8/16).

On the feature side, Voris and Reiff recently penned the spec “Nottingham,” which sold last year in a seven-figure deal to Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment and has Ridley Scott attached to direct and Russell Crowe attached to star. The two also wrote DreamWorks Animation’s upcoming “Kung Fu Panda.”

Voris and Reiff, who also created and executive produced the series “Brimstone,” are repped by WMA, Field Entertainment and attorney Dave Feldman.
