        "text": "The Last Dinosaur shares new single ‘In The Belly Of A Whale’\n\nNew album ‘Wholeness’ out 23rd October via Phases\n\nFollowing the recent announcement of his new album ‘Wholeness‘, The Last Dinosaur (the brainchild of songwriter, Jamie Cameron) returns with new single “In The Belly Of A Whale“.\n\nDue out 23rd October via Phases, the new LP follows on from The Last Dinosaur’s critically acclaimed second album ‘The Nothing’, which came out in 2017.\n\n“In The Belly Of A Whale” sees The Last Dinosaur blend minimalist electronic atmospherics with forlorn piano lines and a short pensive string section. The delicate and understated instrumentation sets a stage for the candid and intimate poetry about companionship penned by Jamie’s close Amy Acre.\n\nSpeaking on the single, Amy says, “The Last Dinosaur’s music unlocks something in my soul that reminds me what music is for. In the Belly of a Whale contains a poem about our friendship—which was forged while we were each going through personal earthquakes. We’ve seen each other grow in life and art and I love that we are part of each other’s creative odysseys.”\n\nBoldy beautiful. “In The Belly Of A Whale” instantly transports you into this intense and eerie atmosphere- it pulls you in and it won’t let you leave without you taking in every tone, every note, and each lyric. High pitches, tentative tones, and encompassing elements whirl through the aura and in turn provides the backdrop into the expansive textures of this track. With the ominous setting, Amy Acre then joins the mix and delivers a beautiful spoken word piece over the instrumentation.\n\nThis is arguably one of the most compelling pieces, two captivating musicians join forces and collaborate on a stunning orchestration lasting 2 minutes 13 seconds and in that time these forces come together, their talent and their projection reek havoc on the audiences senses. Emotional, intimate and profoundly powerful.\n\nThe new single follows The Last Dinosaur’s release of the video for expansive instrumental album opener ‘Wholeness and the Implicate Order’.\n\nThe black and white video is a stunningly understated and symbolic visual, which was directed by the award-winning filmmaker, songwriter and visual artist from India, Aniket Dutta, whose debut experimental feature film Ghost of the Golden Groves (2019) played at several international film festivals including Festival du Nouveau Cinema Montreal and Cinequest USA and was nominated for the FIPRESCI award.\n\n‘Wholeness’ is due out 23rd October via Phases\n\nPre-save the album HERE\n\nThe Last Dinosaur\n\n‘Wholeness’\n\n23rd October 2020\n\n1.
