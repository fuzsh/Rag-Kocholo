        "text": "Here's a sample of a few letters we received that make us happy to do what we do!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nPlease except my holiday wishes to you and yours. My name is Jamie Mitchell. I am a fire fighter on Brunswick Fire Department in the stae of Maine. I am contacting you, both as a father and a consumer fire fighter. As a father having grown up on Rankin/Bass holiday specials I am looking to introdue my children to them as well as develop a library for my unborn daughter. Could you please provide my a list of the Rankin/Bass features their original release dates and when the projected DVD release may be?\n\nAs a fire fighter It is important to note that one of the reasons for my being in the profession is greatly in part due to the Ballad of Smokey the Bear. I watch that show as a child over 35 years ago, atleast. Since I wanted nothing else but to be a fire fighter. Now here I am in the fire service and teaching kids about fire safety through education and prevention. Could you please point me in the direction of getting The Ballad of Smokey the Bear so that I may use it in my fire education class.\n\nFighting Fire, Saving Lives\n\nFraternally, Hiram\n\nJamie M. Mitchell\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nI recently ordered from you the book The Making of Rudolph & the Island of Misfit Toys and the GE ad for the show and have received them both. I ordered these for my fiancé for Christmas. I was unable to wait to give him the book so gave it to him for Thanksgiving (he had been requesting it for the last two Christmas but I had been unable to find it in stock anywhere.) I was so excited upon receiving the autographed copy that I had to give it to him right away. From his reaction, it was the best present I have ever given him.\n\nWin (thats his name) is a fanatic about Rudolph and the Island of Misfit Toys. He collects everything he can find. Our home is decorated at Christmas with all things Rudolph. All of his friends know and kid him about his obsession. I even have my office decorated with extra duplicate figures this year. So of course (as annually) we watched the show on Wednesday evening this week (the new digitally re-mastered version) - while he had your book in hand.\n\nHappy Holidays,\n\nMary\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nDear Mr. Goldschmidt,\n\nMy name is Matthew Gonzalez, I am 12 years old and I have some questions for you. How do S.D. Kluger, Kris Kringle, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice etc., blink? How do people like S.D. Kluger's mouth move?\n\nI borrowed your books, The Making Of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer and The Enchanted World Of Rankin/Bass from my library and I really like them!!!\n\nWho are your favorite Rankin/Bass characters? The book I borrowed from my library called The Making Of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer had your autograph in it!!!!!! Which is your favorite book you have written?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely, Matthew Gonzalez"
