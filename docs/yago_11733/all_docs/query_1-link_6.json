It was nationally syndicated throughout the United States in 1988 with reruns airing until 1990. In the show, a dinosaur hatches from a petrified egg in the modern era, and is befriended by a group of teenagers.[3] Episodes often focused on issues of conservation, ecology, and greed.[4]\n\nThe show ran for two seasons, as the dinosaur boom that had followed the film The Land Before Time (1988) waned until Jurassic Park (1993), causing viewership to drop. The series received a recommendation from the National Education Association.\n\nA CG-animated reboot, which originally went under the name Denver and Cliff, premiered on M6 on August 27, 2018.[5] The new series was produced by Zagtoon.[6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show revolves around Denver, the eponymous last dinosaur, who was released from his egg by a group of California teens: Jeremy, Mario, Shades, and Wally. The kids taught Denver the finer points of skateboarding and other pastimes while protecting him from rock concert promoter Morton Fizzback who wanted to use the dinosaur to make money.\n\nThe series begins when Jeremy, while preparing for his Natural History test, and his friends visit the La Brea Tar Pits – a place in Los Angeles which contains a large collection of extinct animal and plant fossils – and go to the Museum there. At the museum, the friends encounter a gang of bullies led by Nick. The friends escape the bullies by hiding behind a fence near the tar pits. Behind the fence they find a pit that contains a large prehistoric egg. As the friends are playing with the egg, it suddenly cracks and a green friendly dinosaur emerges who understands English. The kids name him Denver after they spot an advertisement for the city of Denver on a passing bus.\n\nThe children decide to keep Denver and to keep his existence a secret. Denver is first hidden in a pool house at Wally's home. After Wally's sister Heather discovers Denver, they move Denver to the old school gym with help from Casey. After a while, Denver gets kidnapped by the manager Morton Fizzback, who puts Denver on a stage in front of an audience to become rich.\n\nWhen the children confront Morton about his abduction, he becomes paranoid that someone might find out that Denver is a real dinosaur. At the end, Denver is sold to a scientist named Professor Funt, who wants to examine and experiment on him, and use him to become famous. Eventually, Denver gets to return to the gang and rescue them from Nick and his thugs.\n\nIn addition to his natural skills and abilities, Denver can also, with the help of a piece from the shell of his egg, take the gang with him back to the time whence he came.\n\nCharacters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain characters\n\n[edit]\n\nDenver is the main protagonist of the show and a close friend of the gang. He is a green Corythosaurus like dinosaur of an unknown species, the last of his kind, who has proven to be a good and loyal friend. Denver first met Wally, Shades, Jeremy, and Mario when he hatched from his egg when the boys hid behind a fence in the tar pit from Nick and his friends. He surprisingly understands English. Denver got his name when the boys spotted an advertisement for the city of Denver on the side of a bus. He is a rock 'n roll music fan and likes to play electric guitar, ride skateboard and eat potato chips. Voiced by Pat Fraley.\n\nWally Adams – Boy who takes Denver in, Denver's closest friend. He cares for various animals – including Rocky (his pup), three cats, Ears (a rabbit), and a parrot. Voiced by Adam Carl.\n\nHeather Adams – Wally's older, and sometimes annoying, sister. She has blonde hair in a ponytail. Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n\nJeremy Anderson – the most intelligent and mature guy among the gang. He acts cerebral and possesses extensive knowledge about a wide variety of subjects, including the origin and habits of dinosaurs. Voiced by Adam Carl.\n\nMario – A brown skin and hair teen with an enormous ego. Voiced by Cam Clarke.\n\nShades – A cool teen who always wears sunglasses (where his name is derived from). He is of Hispanic descent. Voiced by Cam Clarke.\n\nCasey – Youngest of the gang, she is a machinist and often help the other members with the technical problems. She is in love with Mario, more obvious in the first season. Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n\nMinor characters\n\n[edit]\n\nRocky – Wally's pup.\n\nChet – Heather's boyfriend, voiced by Rob Paulsen.\n\nFreddy Facknitts – A teenage genius who is also a fan of comic books, and has a strong, though somewhat comical, sense of justice. He was originally hired by Morton Fizzback to conduct an experiment on Denver's tar egg shell, but later helps out Denver and the gang, and provides technical support.\n\nVillains\n\n[edit]\n\nMorton Fizzback – Drawn and voiced as an obvious characterization of actor Rodney Dangerfield, Fizzback is an arrogant, treacherous and greedy rock concert promoter voiced by Brian Cummings.\n\nProfessor Funt – Evil scientist, sometimes works with Morton, voiced by Brian Cummings.\n\nNick – Leader of three other bullies, Curt, Scott, and Rod, who cause trouble for the boys, voiced by Rob Paulsen.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1 (1988)\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleWritten byOriginal air date11\"Meet Denver\"Doug Lefler\n\nLynn LeflerSeptember 17, 1988 ( )\n\nHour-long pilot episode.
