Given the otherwise complete lack of Last Dinosaur merchandise, I must own this. Even better, it comes with the Polar Borer vehicle from the movie! Krang totally ripped it off.\n\nIf you have any leads on how I could obtain one of these, please let me know.\n\nGot a hard-to-find toy you need help tracking down? Send a photo and description of your Most Wanted item to poe@poeghostal.com."
