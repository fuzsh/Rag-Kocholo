        "text": "On June 20th, 1997, Rankin/Bass Productions registered the film with the US copyright office with the registration number PA0000844990. The title used was \"The Last Dinosaur\".\n\nAlex Grasshoff was to be one of the directors of the movie. Grasshoff became infamous for winning an Oscar for his documentary The Young Americans that was then taken away after it was learned the movie actually released theatrically the year before rather than the year it was submitted as an Oscar contender. Grasshoff was eventually fired from the production and replaced by Tsugunobu Kotani. This is referenced in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nWriter William Thomas Overgard originally pitched the idea of the movie in 1975 to ABC. The network shelved it, though, in favor of pursuing a remake of King Kong. Paramount and Universal, though, made headlines shortly afterwards for doing the same thing, causing ABC to revisit The Last Dinosaur concept. Noted in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nWas intended for a theatrical release in the United States, however, eventually premiered on the ABC network on February 11th, 1977. It earned an impressive 41 share in its ratings. In fact, it was the 24th highest rated in terms of audience size of the movies broadcast on TV in the US from a period tracking movies shown from September 20th, 1976 to September 4th, 1977. Cited in Age of the Gods (self-published)."
