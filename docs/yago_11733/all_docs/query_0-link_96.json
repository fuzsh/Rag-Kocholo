        "text": "CLASSIC MEDIA removed the RANKIN/BASS cover credit on their DVDs by mistake and has promised to correct the error. They were not aware of the agreement RANKIN/BASS had with GOLDEN BOOKS regarding swapping ARTHUR RANKIN'S appearance on the DVDs for the creator's credit on the covers. Since they advertise \"This is the original. Accept no subsitutes\", they would be better off telling our large fan base that he films are the \"original\" RANKIN/BASS productions!\n\nLARRY POTASH, CO-ANCHOR of the WGN MORNING NEWS, interviewed RICK for the CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S RED EYE NEWSPAPER. Should hit news stands sometime during the week before Christmas!\n\nDON DUGA was snowed in during the NEW YORK Blizzard last weekend (12-06). Rick appeared at the HOBOKEN GALLERY of THE DEEP ARCHIVES. Don is making up his appearance this weekend on SATURDAY 12-13 at 533 WASHINGTON STREET.\n\nAMAZON.COM is being flooded for orders on RICK's books. They did not order enough early enough and now have posted SHIPS WITHIN 2-4 WEEKS as a result. If you order at RANKINBASS.COM by 12-19-03...you should still receive your book for CHRISTMAS. We ship PRIORITY MAIL...usually on the next morning.\n\nRICK wants to THANK everyone for showing him a wonderful time on his NEW YORK trip the first weekend of the month...especially ARTHUR RANKIN! THE MUSEUM OF TELEVISION & RADIO put on an AMAZING event and should be commended as well!"
