        "text": "Over the somewhat dismal weekend here in the Northeast, the production team at The Last Dinosaur - Maritime Shipping In the Digital Age was hard at work putting together next weeks podcast. We are featuring repeat offender Evangelos Efstathiou Founder of Skysail Advisors Ltd and CEO of Burmester & Vogel as we take a look back at 2023 and make our bold (and not so bold predictions) for next year and beyond.

Here's a sneak peek: âœ” Insider Updates from Skysail and Burmester & Vogel. ðŸ“£ 2023 Recap & 2024 Predictions: From AI advancements to strategic acquisitions shaping the future. âš“ Expert Insights from Evan ðŸ“• Book reviews from Evan and Chris Stay tuned for a blend of reflection and foresight, tailored for the maritime tech community. Don't forget to follow wherever you get your podcasts!\n\nThrowback Thursday! Today, we're stepping back in time to revisit one of our impactful conversations from earlier this year on \"The Last Dinosaur\", a podcast where we explore the ever-evolving trends and technologies in the maritime industry. In this episode, we were honored to host Maurizio Pilu, the dynamic Founder and Managing Director of the Safetytech Accelerator, a commendable non-profit initiative by Lloyd's Register dedicated to fostering safety and risk mitigation in industrial sectors. During this enlightening chat, Maurizio unpacks the foundational journey of the accelerator, shedding light on the crucial need for structured innovation in the maritime industryâ€™s safety and risk sector. Our discussion navigates through the significant barriers in this realm, namely the status quo mindset, the deficiency in digital skills, and prohibitive costs. With a wealth of experience, Maurizio also shares nuggets of wisdom on how the maritime sector can magnetize the right talent to this domain, highlighting the potential it holds as a promising career choice compared to other sectors. ðŸŽ§ Dive into this insightful episode and get immersed in a conversation that holds the key to reshaping the future of safety and risk in the maritime industry. ðŸŒŸ If you appreciate our deep dives into the maritime world, don't forget to follow \"The Last Dinosaur\" and grace us with a five-star review.

I think it's an example of the best of what we've learned over 9 years of making a science podcast for kids: - Start with kids' own curiosity - Connect their curiosity to scientists' curiosity - Show how even silly questions can lead to serious science - Tell the story of how science works Follow these lessons for 9 years, and you'll inevitably end up asking - as Marshall Escamilla does in this episode: \"How much fart is too much fart?\" Listen to the episode to find out the answer, and stay tuned for the rest of the season! https://lnkd.in/d3-nVteV Huge appreciation to our small but mighty production team: Marshall Escamilla, Sara Robberson Lentz, Elliot Hajjaj, and Gary Calhoun James!\n\nNormally today is #TBT where I feature a recent or not so recent podcast that I think you should revisit. But today, I will be giving you a heads up on next weeks podcast episode. Normally, I drop new episodes every two weeks, but given the holidays, I am shuffling the deck. What does that mean? That means that the staff of The Last Dinosaur - Maritime Shipping In the Digital Age podcast has been working hard in the studios to get next Tuesdays drop ready. Its a great one and features Dr. Jason Zuidema who is the General Secretary at International Christian Maritime Association and Executive Director at North American Maritime Ministry Association. What makes this great - and makes our industry great - is the focus on the seafarers health and wellbeing in this highly connected and digital age. Don't forget to follow the podcast to be assured that you will get an alert when the show drops https://lnkd.in/gFhf5MVM"
