        "text": "Alcoholic, bulbous nosed, chauvinist bore Richard Boone is a big game hunter and millionaire, and because he is not only grotesque, but grotesquely rich, beautiful women constantly throw themselves at his feet. He launches an expedition into a secret pocket of Jurassic world tucked into the earth with a drill-headed submarine to hunt the biggest game of all - Tyrannosaurus Rex, together with his silent native spear bearer, Bunta, played by American basketball player Luther Rackley who was disgusted by the role but decided to take the vacation to Japan anyway, and an ace photographer and bimbo played by Joan Van Ark who at first I thought was clever, teasing Boone to get the job but it turns out no.…\n\nI’m a big fan of drunk bastard actors and Richard Boone delivers a hall of fame drunk performance here. The guy was annihilated for every second of this shoot. In one scene his character is hassled by a gaggle of reporters and he screams “LEAVE ME ALONE, I NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP!” which was definitely a genuine reaction to being touched by all those extras. Later, during an argument about whether to kill a T-Rex, he yells “IT WILL CONTINUE TO PLAGUE US UNTIL WE ARE CHEWED AND SWALLOWED AND DISSOLVED AND I AM JUST NOT READY FOR THAT!” When he gets the chance to take the T-Rex out, he commands it to “STAND STILL DAMMIT” but it’s a completely…\n\nMasten Thrust Jr, oil heir tycoon who's so good at killing animals that he's killed them all! Except for one, and by the distant look in his eyes he feels less of a man. He's also a romantic. He gifts his girlfriend a solid gold bullet with the remark \"when times get tough, bite on it!\" He's a man of scientific genius, he's designed a craft that can bring him to the ultimate kill. But really this is a violent romance story between the two greatest hunters time has ever seen, Masten Thrust and the Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nNah, I'm just messing with you. I ADORED this movie as a kid, it was my Jurassic Park before Jurassic Park. It's also…\n\nRichard Boone is so visibly deep in his cups in most scenes of this movie, it's almost tragic to watch. I say almost, because he still turns in a pretty effective performance.\n\nMaybe that's because the character he is playing is a washed up, physical wreck of a man living on past glories. The opening scenes of this film give a strong impression of zero self awareness on the part of the film makers, but as it wears on, I think the writing is a lot smarter than it first appears. It's very telling than the Joan Van Ark character starts cuddling up with the younger Stephen Keane character once they are all living in the wilderness, far from the…\n\n“It will plague us until we are chewed and eaten and dissolved, and I am not ready for that!”\n\nYet another childhood favorite.\n\nA U.S.-Japan co production between Tsubaraya Productions (Ultraman) and Rankin/Bass (a whole bunch of Christmas special favorites), The Last Dinosaur was released in a weird time for the Kaiju genre-Godzilla and Gamera were on vacation, and Toei released the exploitation Jaws imitator The Legend of Dinosaurs and Monster Birds. It was released in theaters overseas (in Japan and the UK, where it played as part of a double feature with Friedkin’s Sorcerer of all things), though it ended up on TV in the US as an ABC Movie of the Week.\n\nOn one hand, it’s easy to see why this…"
