        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nNOT just for Greek tragedies any more, the trilogy has become the all-but-obligatory format for major franchise films. Both ''The Matrix'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' had grand finales last year, packing them in at multiplexes around the world.\n\nBut trilogies have been turning up in the art houses, as well, in part because of the critical and commercial success of Krzysztof Kieslowski's ''Three Colors'' series of 1993 and 1994. Kieslowski, a Polish filmmaker then based in Paris, worked through three apparently unrelated tales, each named for a color of the French flag: ''Blue,'' ''White'' and ''Red.'' As the trilogy unfolded, it revealed a complex internal structure, based on the repetition of themes and the rhyming of images.\n\nKieslowski died before he could complete a planned second trilogy, based on the Catholic accounts of heaven, hell and purgatory, though the German director Tom Twyker made ''Heaven'' (2002) from the screenplay by Kieslowski and his frequent collaborator, Krzysztof Piesiewicz. Rebecca Miller's one-film trilogy, ''Personal Velocity,'' also in 2002, packed parallel stories of three women's search for freedom into one feature. Lars von Trier's Danish film ''Dogville,'' which will be released in America in March, is the first panel in a planned triptych on European visions of American life. Mr. von Trier says he will continue the series even though the star of ''Dogville,'' Nicole Kidman, has dropped out of the next two.\n\nBeginning this week in New York (with a national release to follow) is Lucas Belvaux's series ''The Trilogy'' (''La Trilogie),'' a great critical success in France when it was released in 2002. The film's three feature-length installments -- titled, in the order they will be shown in the United States, ''On the Run,'' ''An Amazing Couple'' and ''After Life'' -- are all set in the mountain city of Grenoble, where the three female protagonists work in a high school. The women and their husbands, lovers and rivals, cross over from film to film, though each movie has its own story and, more particularly, its own genre.\n\n''On the Run'' (opening on Friday) is a political thriller, in which Mr. Belvaux (long a professional actor) plays a militant radical who escapes from prison and forces an old comrade, a schoolteacher played by Catherine Frot, to help him plan a new series of bombings. In ''An Amazing Couple'' (opening on Feb. 6), the tone shifts to something approaching screwball comedy for the tale of a Grenoble industrialist (Fran√ßois Morel) whose wife (Ornella Muti) mistakenly believes he is having an affair. For the final film, ''After Life'' (opening on Feb. 13), Mr. Belvaux shifts to a more intimate, naturalistic tone for a domestic drama about the tortured relationship of a corrupt police inspector (Gilbert Melki) and his morphine-addicted wife (Dominique Blanc) who is harboring the radical.\n\nThe stories take place simultaneously, with events seen from different perspectives in different films and major characters in one film becoming supporting players in another.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
