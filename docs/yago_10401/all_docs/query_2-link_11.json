He made his debut at La Baignoire and then worked on the texts of Euripides, Tennessee Williams and Koltès. He has appeared in private theatre alongside Michel Galabru in La poule aux œufs d’or and Bernard Tapie in Vol au-dessus d’un nid de coucou, and more recently in Alexis Michalik’s play Edmond. But it was in his role for the cinema as a «Bad Guy» in Brian de Palma’s Femme Fatale and the lead role in Raoul Peck’s Lumumba that made him famous to the general public.
