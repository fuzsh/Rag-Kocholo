        "text": "The 59th annual Cannes Film Festival is upon us. Resisting the urge to continue writing this news story in an outrageous, Cleese-in-Holy-Grail-style French accent, it falls to us to report that such respected names as Richard Linklater, Guillermo Del Toro, Richard Kelly and Richard Linklater will be entering films into this year’s competition.\n\nAnd the festival has indicated that it’s trying to get away from accusations that last year’s event was stacked with past winners and usual Cannes types. “This year we had to open the doors and windows to try and let in some new talent,\" artistic director Thierry Fremaux told The Hollywood reporter. Must be all that gar… (No stereotypical French jokes or you’re fired –Ed).\n\nOutside the competition, the festival promises glamour and blockbusters by the truckload, with the likes of X-Men: The Last Stand and opening-night film The Da Vinci Code appearing out of competition.\n\nThe festival runs from 17-28 May. For the full list of this year’s films, let your eyes wander below.
