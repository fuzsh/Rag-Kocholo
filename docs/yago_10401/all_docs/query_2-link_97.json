        "text": "I’ve noticed recently that there have been many documentaries released about the War in Iraq. This isn’t unusual or shocking, after all film is one of the earliest forms of propraganda and protest. It seems more common than ever to produce a documentary about something your against.\n\nIf you’re interested, here are some of the docs I’m talking about and some to look out for.\n\nGunner Palace – [review] US Troops living in Uday Hussein’s former pleasure palace.\n\nControl Room – [review] It’s about Al-Jazeera, the news network’s often controversial principles and the network’s relationship with Western countries, specifically the US.\n\nUncovered: The War in Iraq – [from imdb.com] In this documentary feature, filmmaker Robert Greenwald chronicles the Bush Administration’s case to invade Iraq following the events of Sept. 11, 2001. The film examines the administration’s argument for war through interviews with U.S intelligence and defense officials, foreign service experts and U.N. weapons inspectors — including a former CIA director, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and even President Bush’s Secretary of the Army.\n\nIraq for Sale – currently in the preproduction stages. Also directed by Robert Greenwald\n\nWMD: Weapons of Mass Deception – like Control Room, this documentary is also about the somewhat deceptive media coverage of the war.\n\nUncovered: The Whole Truth about the Iraq War – also directed by Robert Greenwald. [from imdb.com] Interviews with varied U.S officials and experts offer a deconstruction on the Bush administration’s case for war in Iraq in the wake of 9/11.\n\nHomefront– which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival\n\nThe Blood of My Brother – about the family of an Iraqi shot by a U.S. patrol. It also premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival\n\n——————-\n\nWhatever your political view may be, these documentaries are vital records of the current political situation and should be watched.\n\nGia (1998)\n\nStarring Angelina Jolie (before she was the prettier half of Brangelina), Gia tells the story of Gia Marie Carangi, America’s first supermodel. Jolie is riveting as Carangi, the fashion it-girl of the 1970’s who would fall into a world of drugs, sex, depression, and eventually die of AIDs at the age of 26. With this role, Jolie proved she was an actress, receiving a Golden Glove and a SAG for her performance.\n\nThe Squid and the Whale (2005)\n\nSet in Brooklyn during the 1980’s, writer/director Noah Baumbach touching story is of two brothers (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline) dealing with their parents’ divorce. The somewhat childish (Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney), blame eachother for the collapse of the marriage. The ultimate moral… divorce is tough. A poignant film that can make laugh just as easily as it will make you cry. Overlooked during the award show season and that’s a shame.\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents (2005)\n\nLaura Henderson (Dame Judi Dench) already has a reputation as an eccentric member of London’s upper class when she decides to renovate an abandoned theater. Clueless, she enlists the help of Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to manage her productions. In desperate need of a hit, Mrs. Henderson comes up with a plan to place nude girls on the stage. What emerges is not only a controversy, but a delightful tale of the only London theater to remain open during the Blitz. It is a lovely picture and Dench gives a touching performance.\n\nBall of Fire (1941)\n\nThis hilarious picture written by Billy Wilder and directed by Howard Hawks is a unique take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Prof. Bertram Potts (Gary Cooper) and his 7 colleagues are writing a slang dictionary. Katherine O’Shea (Barbara Stanwyck) is a night club singer engaged to a gangster. When she needs to hide from the police, she takes a place a the Professors’ home and tricks Potts into marrying her. Only trouble can result from this madcap adventure. Stanwyck receieved an Oscar nomination for her role in a perfect romantic-comedy.\n\nShopgirl (2005)\n\nBased on Steve Martin’s best-selling novella. Claire Danes delivers with a highly underrated performance as Mirabelle Buttersfield, a lonely salesgirl, who embarks on a relationship with an older man (Steve Martin) that will change her life. He leads her into a world of wealth and lavish gifts, only to increase her vulnerability. Jason Schwartzman is also on board as the aimless young man vying for Mirabelle’s attention. Claire Danes is better than this so-so movie.\n\nHowl’s Moving Castle (2004)\n\nJapanese director Hayao Miyazaki’s latest feature is another masterpiece. Like any other Miyazaki film, Howl’s Moving Castle is the story of magic, wizards, and love. Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer), an unconfident young woman is turned into an old woman by the spiteful Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall). To break the spell she must depend on Howl (Christian Bale), an talented but equally insecure wizard,and the characters who live in his giant wooden legged castle. A visual masterpiece and it is sure to be a classic.\n\nForget the Oscars. Forget the Golden Globes. The most important award show in Hollywood is none other than the MTV Movie Awards.\n\nThe nominees for the annual award show were announced today, with fan favorites Wedding Crashers and The 40-year-old Virgin leading the pack with 5 nominations each.\n\nBig budget blockbusters Batman Begins, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Hustle & Flow, Sin City, and Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith each earned 3 nominations.\n\nWhat I love about the MTV Movie Awards, is not so much the quality of the nominees, but more the free-spirited feeling of the award show. Honestly, when else could Paris Hilton, Brokeback Mountain, and Saw II be nominated for anything at the same award show? Only on MTV.\n\nAnd the nominees are:\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nBatman Begins\n\nKing Kong\n\nSin City\n\nWedding Crashers\n\nBEST PERFORMANCE\n\nJoaquin Phoenix – Walk the Line\n\nJake Gyllenhaal – Brokeback Mountain\n\nRachel McAdams – Red Eye\n\nSteve Carell – The 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nTerrence Howard – Hustle & Flow\n\nReese Witherspoon – Walk the Line\n\nBEST COMEDIC PERFORMANCE\n\nOwen Wilson – Wedding Crashers\n\nAdam Sandler – The Longest Yard\n\nSteve Carell – The 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nTyler Perry – Madea’s Family Reunion\n\nVince Vaughn – Wedding Crashers\n\nBEST ON-SCREEN TEAM\n\nSteve Carell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen & Romany Malco – The 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nJohnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott & Jessica Simpson – The Dukes of Hazzard\n\nJessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans & Michael Chiklis – Fantastic Four\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint – Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nVince Vaughn & Owen Wilson – Wedding Crashers\n\nBEST VILLAIN\n\nCillian Murphy – Batman Begins\n\nHayden Christensen – Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith\n\nRalph Fiennes – Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nTilda Swinton – The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nTobin Bell – Saw II\n\nBREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE\n\nAndre “3000” Benjamin – Four Brothers\n\nIsla Fisher – Wedding Crashers\n\nNelly – The Longest Yard\n\nJennifer Carpenter — The Exorcism of Emily Rose\n\nRomany Malco – The 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nTaraji P.

Check it out. It’s usually an entertaining show.\n\nI am now going to share with you a very traumatic experience I had at the movies in September 2004.\n\nMy former best friend and I decided to go to the movies on this very fateful day. (It was also traumatic because we saw Vanity Fair, that really crappy movie starring Reese Witherspoon, but that’s a different issue.)\n\nThe previews started and when the previews begin, I stop talking. And from that point on, if you talk to me, I will hit you.\n\nThen it happened. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, my friend’s cell phone rang. It’s not like it was one of those annoying, almost deafening ring tones. No, it just vibrated.\n\nShe then got courageous. Knowing very well that I was glaring at her, she ANSWERED her phone. Not before she handed me her jumbo bucket of popcorn to hold so she could execute the crime more easily.\n\nIn quite possibly the loudest voice a person can speak in, she told her caller, that she was in a movie and that she would call him back. In only 15 seconds she ruined a movie for me. (As it would turn out, Vanity Fair, was a completely mind numbing, practically nauseating movie to sit through… again that’s another issue.)\n\nBy this time I am only slightly furious. But then she had the nerve to ask me what she had missed while she was on the phone. So while handing her back the jumbo bucket of popcorn, I “accidentally” spilled it on her lap.\n\nNeedless to say, we are no longer friends.\n\nSo there it is, my very traumatic movie experience.\n\nBut what to do if you don’t know the yakker? Read this and learn.\n\nThat is all for now. Have a good weekend and turn off your cell phone at the movies."
