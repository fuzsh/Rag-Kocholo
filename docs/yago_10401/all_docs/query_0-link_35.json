        "text": "The only thing you can predict about Cannes jury decisions is that they will be unpredictable. With many auteurs performing below their best this year, I often found myself wondering, as the hangdog Belgian farmhand trudged across his potato field in long shot or the creepy Italian moneylender passed a nun carrying a satellite dish, what does Samuel L Jackson make of all this?\n\nIt's why I think Babel may win tonight, when the 59th Palme d'Or is handed out. The film by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, he of Amores Perros, 21 Grams and the fractured narrative, looks, feels and sounds like an important piece of world cinema, or at least what Hollywood thinks it should look like (it's got subtitles for crissakes).\n\nA chain of events is kickstarted in Morocco when a boy fires a rifle at a bus, accidentally wounding an American tourist (Cate Blanchett) travelling with her husband (Brad Pitt). The shot is heard around the world. In San Diego, the couple's young children are whisked over the border for their Mexican maid's son's wedding; in Japan, a deaf mute student takes her clothes off to seduce a detective.\n\nRather than an organic piece of drama, it all feels like a scriptwriter's idea, in this case, one by Guillermo Arriaga. None of it rings true, and the Tokyo storyline is particularly tenuous. Yet the film is dazzling in its technical virtuosity, shot on various film stocks by Rodrigo Prieto and underlined by Gustavo Santaollala's score. Brad Pitt looks very serious, Blanchett is good and Gael Garcia Bernal is as watchable as ever.\n\nBut I didn't feel anything here. There's such a level of artifice at play that the messages about nations misunderstanding each other, jumping to conclusions about terrorists and guns being generally bad come clumsily. But then I thought the same about Crash not so long ago, and look what happened there.\n\nIf Babel received some of the loudest applause, then Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette was greeted with the most vigorous boos - thoroughly undeserved. This is a funny, beautiful and, yes, cool film, blending fashion and pop with subtle comments on celebrity, emptiness and excess. 'Let them eat cake' is portrayed as the young Queen (charmingly played by Kirsten Dunst) being misquoted in the tabloid press. In its fin-de-siecle mood and beauty, it reminded me of Gus Van Sant's Last Days. In terms of pure, lavish enjoyment, it stands apart in this unremarkable competition. But many people here hated it and I agree that Coppola's poor little rich girl schtick can be annoying.\n\nFrance has a good chance of its first home win since 1987. A simple, almost old-fashioned war movie called Indigènes (Days of Glory) tells of African soldiers liberating France in the Second World War. Directed with minimal fuss by Rachid Bouchareb, it handles institutional racism, heroism and colonialism with a candour rarely seen in French cinema, crowned with strong performances from stars such as Roschdy Zem, Sami Bouajila and, in a particularly touching non-comic role, Jamel Debbouze. I admired the frill-free way it told its story and it beats with such a humane heart that it can proudly take its place alongside more artful French war classics such as Tavernier's Life and Nothing But, Francois Dupeyron's Officer's Ward and even Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants\n\nBut given the world-class auteurs on display here, there was some irritating story-telling and not enough attention to how people really behave. The stylistic tics of Italy's Paolo Sorrentino in The Family Friend drove me barmy; Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Climates, from Turkey, is self-obsessed art cinema at its most cold; Nanni Moretti's The Caiman was over-reliant on the director's self-regarding charm. Richard Kelly's Southland Tales was so bad it made me wonder if he'd ever met a human being. After just 10 minutes of this sprawling, plotless, post-apocalyptic farrago you get that sinking feeling that this may be one of the worst films ever presented in competition.\n\nOne comes here looking for new trends, seeking new voices from new nations - will they come from Africa, China or Latin America? Actually, the new hotbed of cinematic invention is Belgium. The Dardenne brothers won here last year (they're here again, wandering weirdly around together like Gilbert & George), and I was intrigued by both Bruno Dumont's Flanders and Lucas Belvaux's La Raison du plus Faible. The Belgian government is probably funding this increase in filmic activity, and it might be an idea to get the tourist board involved - it looks a terrible place. Flanders is The Deer Hunter set on the muddy fields where war has always been part of history. A group of inarticulate local lads are sent to some imprecise war (a desert, an oasis) where horrors happen that send them home changed men. Belvaux's film is about a group of laid-off workers in industrial Liege who plot a hold-up to buy a friend a new moped. From being an examination of industrial decay, it playfully develops into a thriller (vague nods to Godard's Bande à Part and Raoul Walsh's White Heat) and a study of masculinity.\n\nIn a competition in which the most fully achieved work was easily Pedro Almodovar's Volver, about mothers and daughters, which is reviewed next week, France's Selon Charlie also put men under the microscope. This charmingly Gallic enterprise showcased the wonderfully bitter features of Jean Pierre Bacri as mayor of Caen, around whom several storylines spin. Observed by a woman (actress Nicole Garcia directs), it's a comedy about power, status, hunter-gatherers, tennis, fossils, fisticuffs, dependency, bonding and loyalty. I think it's far better than anyone gave it credit for.\n\nFor me, the finest film at Cannes was also about man in the modern workplace. Zinedine Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait was sublime, the only film to lift me out of my seat and inject that buzz of discovery for which Cannes is usually so cherished. It's the greatest film about football ever made (I admit the competition in that field is not strong) and one of the great films about sport. Directed by Turner-prize winner Douglas Gordon and French artist Philippe Parrono, it simply follows the French captain for 90 minutes during a match for Real Madrid against Villareal, though 17 cameras are trained on him under the cinematographic direction of Darius Khondji.\n\nIt's a classic portrait of a working man, and the viewer can foist multiple readings on its filmic canvas. As Zidane sets about his job, drowning in noise, concentration and sweat, I thought of the Sisyphean task of the footballer, the loneliness of the athlete, the musculature and poise of the human body and the power and fragility of the mind. There was no more soulful an examination of the human condition to be found at Cannes than in watching Zidane at work. Unfortunately, it was playing out of competition but I still hope Samuel L Jackson saw it."
