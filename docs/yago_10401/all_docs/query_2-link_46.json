        "text": "COLOGNE — Film funding body FFA has awarded S2 million ($2.7 million) to three German projects. It also allocated $4.5 million for 10 border-crossing co-productions on behalf of European body Eurimages.\n\nBerlin-based FFA split the $2.7 million among Vivian Neafe’s “Die wilden Huehner,” fairy-tale pic “Kalif storch,” and ambitious Tom Tykwer-Bernd Eichinger project “Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.” “Perfume” has already received in excess of $3 million from Teutonic coffers; it was recently reported to star Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman in supporting roles.\n\nFFA announced another funds allocation for the annual Branchtiger-Treff (industry tigers confab) March 31. It will distribute $33 million among 130 German producers that did well at the box office in 2004, which FFA highlighted as the best year for domestic productions since the reunification, with a market share of 24%.\n\nThe highest share of Eurimages’ latest distribution, $730,000, went to Italian-French production “The Golden Door,” a story about Sicilian emigrants to North America around 1900, by helmer Emanuele Crialese (“Respiro”).\n\nSimilar amounts were snatched by two kidpics, “Island of Lost Souls,” from Denmark’s Zentropa, and Irish-French-Belgian toon “Brendan and the Secret of Kells.”\n\nEurimages also highlighted social drama “La raison du plus faible,” by Lucas Belvaux, who made the cut based on the success of his “Trilogy” (2002)."
