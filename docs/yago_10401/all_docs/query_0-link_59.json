        "text": "Variety reports on Cannes 2006 Program\n\nThe film trade magazine \"Variety\" has a long report on the status of the selection process for Cannes this year.\n\nHighlights include:\n\n\"strong Hollywood presence thanks to Fox's \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and Warner Bros.' 'The Fountain'\"\n\n\"a 20-minute preview of Paramount's Oliver Stone pic 'World Trade Center'\"\n\n\"DreamWorks returns to the fest with its latest toon, 'Over the Hedge'\"\n\n\"Among documentaries showing in noncompeting slots, there's \"Al Gore: An Inconvenient Truth\" and \"John Ford/John Wayne: The Filmmaker and the Legend,\" directed by Sam Pollard\"\n\nother films rumored to be shown are \"actor-director John Cameron Mitchell's heavily sexual New York ensembler \"Shortbus,\" Rolf de Heer's Aussie Aboriginal drama \"Ten Canoes\" and Rachid Bouchareb's \"Days of Glory,\" a big-budgeter about North Africans who fought alongside the French in WWII.\"\n\n\"Films very likely to find slots ... are two Mexican features, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's \"Babel,\" featuring Cate Blanchett, Brad Pitt and Gael Garcia Bernal ... and \"The Violin,\" by Cannes Cinefondation alum Francisco Vargas, based on his own short\"\n\nOther likely selections inlcude \"Richard Linklater's ensembler \"Fast Food Nation,\" with Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke ... and Guillermo del Toro Spanish-lingo horror movie 'Pan's Labyrinth'\"\n\nDefinitely set for the competition is \"Marie Antoinette,\" Sofia Coppola's costumer with a pop tune score based on Antonia Fraser's biography and starring Kirsten Dunst\"\n\n\"Almodovar will bring \"Volver,\" starring Penelope Cruz and already one of his biggest hits in Spain, for a May 19 Croisette bow\"\n\nKen \"Loach will offer \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley,\"\n\n\"Kaurismaki will be back with \"Lights at the Edge of the City,\" the final leg in his \"unemployment trilogy,\" centered on a night watchman and a sexy femme in the suburbs of Helsinki\"\n\n\"Moretti has his anti-Berlusconi comedy-drama 'The Cayman'\"\n\n\"Bellochio will present \"The Wedding Director,\" a Sicily-set drama\"\n\n\"Also certain for the competition are \"Climates,\" by Turkey's Nuri Bilge Ceylan ... and \"Selon Charlie,\" French thesp Nicole Garcia's fifth directorial outing\"\n\n\"'Hana,' Hirokazu Kore-eda's drama centered on a samurai plotting revenge on his father's killer, is the sole Asian title that looks likely to be headed for the competition.\"\n\n\"The Good German,\" Steven Soderbergh's B&W post-WWII Berlin murder mystery, with Blanchett, George Clooney and Beau Bridges, is still in post-production and will very possibly not be completed in time\n\nAlso...\n\nThe word around Paris is that the competition is taking a more mainstream turn this year. \"It's a clear strategy that, if a film is too arid, it won't get a competition slot, regardless of whom the director is,\" one sales agent told Daily Variety. However, that message doesn't seem strongly reflected in the selections so far, which are sending out mixed signals very typical of artistic director Thierry Fremaux's reign.\n\nIronically, in a year when one of Asia's most celebrated directors, Wong Kar Wai, is jury prez, the 2006 official selection looks to be Asia-light compared with recent years. \"Hana,\" Hirokazu Kore-eda's drama centered on a samurai plotting revenge on his father's killer, is the sole Asian title that looks likely to be headed for the competition.\n\n..............................\n\nTraditionally, a considerable amount of juggling between sections takes place in the final weeks, and many films have still to be seen by the program committee. Fremaux also may have some real discoveries up his sleeve, though so far his selections seem to tilt toward established names and Cannes regulars.\n\n.............................\n\nSeveral titles are not ready for Cannes, including the Steven Shainberg-helmed \"Fur,\" a biopic of '60s photog Diane Arbus, starring Nicole Kidman; Brian De Palma's \"The Black Dahlia,\" with Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson; and \"Inland Empire,\" David Lynch's California-set mystery, with Laura Dern, Harry Dean Stanton and Jeremy Irons. A Studio Canal production.\n\nWhat a huge honor for Zhang. I'm caught in the middle of feeling happy for her and also feeling a bit confounded.\n\nYahoo/AFP said:\n\nChinese actress Zhang Ziyi to join Cannes jury\n\nSat Apr 15, 1:25 AM ET\n\nBEIJING (AFP) - Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi says she has accepted an invitation to be a jury member at the Cannes film festival in France next month.\n\n\"I'm anticipating taking up the post and it would be an honor,\" Zhang was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency at a press conference on Friday in Beijing, where she was promoting her new movie \"Jasmine Women\".\n\nOrganisers of the Cannes festival, set to take place in the upscale southern French resort from May 17-28, have not officially announced the names of the jury members.\n\n\"I hope to use my influence to make more Chinese movies, if I simply want to make money, I can do that in the United States,\" she told reporters, according to Xinhua.\n\nThe 27-year-old Zhang has won wide acclaim for performances in movies such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"House of Flying Daggers\" and \"Memoirs of a Geisha\".\n\nHong Kong director Wong Kar Wai has been named to head the jury at the prestigious film festival, the first time that the honor has been awarded to a Chinese film-maker.\n\nXinhua said this would be the first time that two Chinese nationals are on the Cannes jury."
