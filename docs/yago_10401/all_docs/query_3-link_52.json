        "text": "The Belgian director Lucas Belvaux has made three new films, which will open, during the coming month, at a rate of one per week. The first is called “On the Run,” the second, “An Amazing Couple,” and the third, “After Life.” Belvaux would prefer each film to stand alone, but these works were raised together, like triplets, and they should be confronted en masse. If you had told Shakespeare that the first and third parts of “Henry VI” totally rocked but that you couldn’t be bothered with the second, he would have fingered the fluff below his bottom lip and called you a very whoreson dog. And quite right, too.\n\nThe movies were shot, over a period of twenty-two weeks, in Grenoble, and anybody who knows the place will appreciate what a useful arena it makes. The city sits—nicely cupped or loftily frowned upon, according to taste—in a range of mountains, and the air there feels not just clean but bright, like the backdrop for a toothpaste commercial. From the start, Belvaux makes it plain that he has sniffed something sinister beneath the shine. Here’s the deal: these three films do not tell successive stories. In fact, they offer pretty much the same bundle of story, untangled in different ways. Sometimes a scene will be repeated from film to film, with minor adjustments; at other times, it will merely be implied, but we will, for the first time, learn of its aftermath. Each movie covers a similar time frame, within which the characters loom and recede.\n\nIn “On the Run,” a terrorist named Bruno (played by Belvaux himself) is sprung from jail after fifteen years. He goes into hiding, makes contact with a former colleague, and resumes his bombing campaign against capitalist institutions. It is a lonely business, for the world has moved on, and nobody else is kindling that old political fire. Bruno meets a drug addict called Agnès (Dominique Blanc), saves her life, and is rewarded with a stay in a chalet, perched high above the town, which she borrows—pretending that she has a lover’s assignation—from her friend Cécile (Ornella Muti). But everything closes in on Bruno, and he flees toward the border, up into the snows.\n\nIn “An Amazing Couple,” Cécile moves to center stage. Her marriage to Alain (François Morel) is under strain. He is a hypochondriac, who muses upon his own demise into a tape recorder; she, in turn, suffers from a Proustian dose of jealousy, despite the fact that, as she is told, “no one leaves a woman like you.” (Muti is one of those actresses upon whom Time has sportingly agreed to wreak no change; she is even lovelier than when she played Odette in “Swann in Love,” in 1983.) Quite wrongly, Cécile believes Alain to be unfaithful and asks a cop—Pascal (Gilbert Melki), who is married to Agnès, the junkie from the opening picture—to tail him. The cop, unsurprisingly, grows fond of Cécile, whose own activities give Alain cause for paranoid doubt; soon, husband and wife are spying on each other in a sort of private Cold War. A happy ending, as in Molière, is grabbed from nowhere.\n\n“After Life” turns to Pascal, the policeman, and thus to Agnès. By day, she is a teacher, but for twenty years she has been addicted to morphine, which her husband supplies under a shady agreement with a local drug baron. There is a matter-of-fact tenderness in Pascal’s bizarre provision; he hands her the drug when he comes home, as if it were the evening paper, and tips her used syringes into the trash like cigarette butts. But the morphine runs dry when the drug baron asks Pascal to arrange for the death of Bruno—our terrorist, still at large in Grenoble, and in possession of incriminating facts. This Pascal will not do; he is bent because of his wife, but he will not break. In effect (the dilemma is classically French), he will not kill for love.\n\nThis is certainly the season for movie multiples. Quentin Tarantino is about to honor us with the second installment of “Kill Bill,” the film that had so much to say about kung fu that it burst its banks. And Belvaux’s trilogy may itself function as a digestif after the three-course blowout of “The Lord of the Rings.” In addition, there are always sagas and sequels in the offing, driven by pure demand—a third Harry Potter, plus, at some point, the two hundredth James Bond. If Belvaux’s trilogy plays to respectable houses here, he could even get summoned to Hollywood to shoot “Scary Movie 5.” His own threesome of films goes beyond any previous conceit; if Ingmar Bergman’s “Through a Glass Darkly,” “Winter Light,” and “The Silence” became known as a trilogy, it was because those studies of fretful solitude began to pattern themselves as variations on a theme. Belvaux, however, planned his campaign from the start.\n\nAdvance word on the result was that it served as an exercise in style: the first film was a thriller, the second a comedy, and the third a melodrama. If so, Belvaux would be taking his place in an elegant tradition; 1947 saw the publication of Raymond Queneau’s “Exercises in Style,” in which a minor incident on a bus was recounted in ninety-nine different ways—in slang, in a sonnet, in reported speech, and so on. The book, famous in its day, now reads less as a writer’s guide than as a prose poem, each passage polished like the facet of a gem. And so it is with these movies. There is no denying the jump in mood between the three; just listen to the taut, plucked strings that underscore the action in “On the Run,” as opposed to the parping horns that inform us, with no great subtlety, that the predicament of Alain, in “An Amazing Couple,” is to be treated primarily as farce. The first, too, is cut at quite a clip, with Bruno clinging like a bat to the safety of the night, whereas Alain’s tale seems a more leisurely and sunlit affair, during which he mugs at the camera and falls asleep in a cornfield. To the weathered moviegoer, does the first not glance with gratitude at Jean-Pierre Melville, and the second tip its hat to Jacques Tati?\n\nNot so fast. There is a scene in “An Amazing Couple” where Alain is late for his own birthday party because he is, like the majority of his gender, completely hopeless. For his wife, however, he concocts a panicky excuse about having crashed the car; she, suspicious of his movements, asks to see the damage, whereupon he races outside and beats up his vehicle—a fine old Jaguar in racing green—to make his story ring true. Only by a whisker does the sequence register as funny. If anything, in common with the best screwball, it writhes with desperation, every bit as fraught as the flight of Bruno in the earlier film.\n\nOnly with the trilogy behind you do you start to appreciate the prism that Belvaux has created. The simplest scene, when observed from another angle, acquires a different hue. In the first movie, Agnès and Cécile drive to the chalet and find Bruno. We see them through his cautious eyes; as their car pulls up, he takes out a gun, then tucks it away just in time to greet them. Compare the next film, in which, from the perspective of Cécile, the identical setup is drained of threat, so Bruno comes across as little more than a layabout, or Agnès’s easy lay. (Of course, he is neither.) Agnès herself starts the trilogy as a bedraggled annoyance on the street, clawing at Bruno and sweating with her need for a fix. You cannot watch the same encounter in the third film and not pray that this poor benighted woman will find a Samaritan of some description. When she asks Bruno his name, he lies and says, “Pierre.” “Saint-Pierre,” she replies.\n\nTo some audiences, especially those who think that “Rashomon” pulled off a swifter version of the same trick, these nudges of emphasis will seem itchy and unconvincing, not unlike the absurd carrotty wig and hamster-colored beard with which Bruno, a master of disguise, attempts to mask his appearance. The performances, too, are a deliberate clash; Belvaux plays Bruno with such grumpy flatness that you scarcely believe him capable of murderous acts, while Dominique Blanc kicks off her portrayal of Agnès at maximum intensity and takes it from there. Yet these discrepancies have their purpose, because what we glean from Belvaux’s trilogy is the reassurance (rare on film, with its terror of inattention) that people are both important and unimportant, and that heroes and leading ladies, in life as in art, can fade into extras before our eyes. Even romance, the most reliable ingredient of cinema, is laced with nervous impurity: do Cécile and Alain really wind up as the perfect couple, or as a pair of compatible, credulous fools? Is the look that Pascal bestows upon his wife, deep in her morphine sleep, one of adoration or pity? As for Bruno’s faith in world revolution, it is as ethereal and treacherous as the snow through which he finally climbs—a dark speck amid the whiteness, he looks like the last Nietzschean in the world. These movies lack, perhaps, the gasp of rapture that Krzysztof Kieslowski brought to his “Three Colors” trilogy, the close of which saw figures from all three films emerging from a single shipwreck; but Belvaux’s feeling for frail lives is more than a match for the cleverness of his design, and one has to be impressed by any body of work that runs for more than three hundred and forty minutes yet, despite being set in France, features no sex whatsoever. I thought it was required by law. ♦"
