        "text": "The 1980s not only saw an increase in the number of crime films in Norway, the criminal investigator also made his comeback after being more or less absent throughout the postwar period. Just as with the dominant trend internationally, the criminal investigator was an outsider, a man of yesteryear that the changing times had left behind. As society was in transition, with the destabilization of family structure, an increase in immigration from the south and the rise of the yuppie culture and its aftermath, criminal cases also changed. In short, the criminal investigator seemed unfit to meet the demands of a new age. Twenty years later, the criminal investigator appears to be more at ease with himself, although he is still very much an outsider, and the crimes investigated have well-known causes. As a result, Norwegian crime films no longer seem to impart any implicit politically charged critique.\n\nThis paper aims to provide characteristics of selected Polish detective films produced in the 1970s from the typological perspective. The author describes eight films and TV series of that time, i.e. “Trąd” (dir. A Trzos-Rostawiecki, 1971), “To ja zabiłem” (dir. S. Lenartowicz, 1974), “Hazardziści” (dir. M. Waśkowski, 1975), „Wściekły” (dir. R. Załuski, 1979), „Anna i wampir” (dir. J. Kidawa, 1981) and “Złote Koło” (dir. S. Wohl, 1971), “S.O.S” (dir. J. Morgenstern, 1974), and “Gąszcz” (dir. A. Konic, 1974), pinpointing characteristic similarities in their contents and form. A common element of all these productions is a specific, realistic convention which is illustrated using four main techniques: 1) focusing on such crime categories which had not been presented in films so far 2) investigating the ethical and moral dimension of a crime 3) developing various contexts of a crime and incorporating in the film plot the theses and opinions derived from other discourses not dealing with the category of aesthetics, 4) various narrative and formal techniques, incorporating real-life elements into the feature film’s plot. Beside the content and formal characteristics of this film genre, the paper provides also relevant information on institutional and cultural circumstances which determined the development of this cinematic form."
