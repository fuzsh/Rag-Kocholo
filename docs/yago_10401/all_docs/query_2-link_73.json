        "text": "1892\n\n1892\n\n6 January\n\nNo 20\n\nChemulpo\n\nJan. 6th 92\n\nChère Amy,\n\nJ'ai des remords de l'avoir envoyé une telle liste de choses à faire pour moi, et je craignes que tu ne vas être trop consciencieuse en leur éxécution. J'espère tout de même que tu auras trouvé le plus important et que tu ne te tourmenteras pas du rest. J'espère aussi que la nouvelle année vous a apporté de meillieures choses qu'à vous. Dans ma dernière je crois déjà avoir parlé de la santé de Papa comme étant des plus faible à cause de cette \"influenza\". Il ne va guère mieux et le docteur exige beaucoup de soins et de tranquilleté, deux choses presque impossible à lui donner. Il persiste dans son travail et justement maintenant il a toutes espèces de tourments à propos de counseil etc. etc. Il tousse pas mal et ne sont presque pas de son petit bureau - toujours fatigué et pâle, il me fait vraiment peur quelquefois. Je ne sais pas, peûtêtre que je vois tout cela un peu en noir mais certes cet hiver n'est pas gai! Je suis chez Mme Johnston pour une semaine et très à contre coeur mais il a fallu que je vienne pour en finir; elle me tourmenter depuis si longtemps, mais je suis dans des transes tout le temps à propos de Papa et je ne sais jamais ce que Maman va le conseiller à faire. Je me demande quelquefois si il y a beaucoup d'enfants avec des mères comme le nôtre.\n\nJ'ai des nouvelles de Péking à peu près une fois par mois maintenant - heureusement elles sont assez bonnes. -- Tu vois je ne suis guère de bonne humeur aujourd'hui -- Pardonnes moi mais j'ai été beaucoup tourmentée dernièrement et ennuyée de questions \"impertinentes\" comme je les appelles. Il n'y a rien qui m'agace comme cela et des personnes qui veulent toujours savoir ce qui ne les regarde pas.\n\nJe ne pense pas écrire à Addie par ce courier --- cela m'est assez difficile, ne pouvant pas parler des choses qui me tiennent le plus aux coeur. Encore une fois soignes toi et ne te tourmentes pas trop des détails car comme les choses sont maintenant -- !\n\nMille baisers,\n\nHélène\n\nArrivée avant hier je pense retourner dimanche ou lundi.\n\n8 jan.\n\nNouvelles de pappa bonnes. il touse moins mais est encore faible.\n\nH.M.H.\n\nNo 20\n\nChemulpo\n\nJan. 6th 92\n\nDear Amy,\n\nI am remorseful for having sent you such a list of things to do for me, I fear that you will be too conscientious in their execution. Even so I hope that you will have found the most important and that you will not torment yourself regarding the rest. I hope also that the new year brings all the best to you. In my last I believe I have already sponken of the Papa's health as being the weakest because of this \"influenza.\" He is scarcely any better and the Doctor insists on a great deal of care and tranquility, two things almost impossible to give him. He persists in his work and just now he has all sorts of torments a propos the council, etc. etc. He coughs a lot and he is almost never at his little desk -- always tired and pale he really scares me sometimes. I don't know, perhaps I see all that a little two blackly but certainly this winter is not gay! I am reluctantly at Mrs Johnston's for a week but I had to comme to finish it; it had tormented me for such a long time, but I am anxious all the time a propos Papa and I never what Mama is going to council him to do. I sometimes wonder if there are many childre with mothers such as ours.\n\nI have news from Peking about once a month now -- happily it is good enough. -- You see that I am scarcely in good humor -- Pardon me but I am much tormented recently and saddened by \"impertinant\" questions as I call them. There is nothing that bothers me like that and people who always want to know what does not regard them.\n\nI am not thinking of writing to Addie by this mail -- that is difficult enough without being able to talk of things that are closest to my heart. Once more, take care of yourself and do not torment yourself regarding the details because of the way things are now.\n\nA thousand kisses,\n\nHelen\n\nArrived yesterday and I think I will return Sunday or Monday.\n\n8 Jan.\n\nNews of Papa good. he coughs less but is still frail.\n\nH.M.H.\n\n17 January\n\nNo 21\n\nSöul\n\nle 17 janv. 92\n\nChère Amy,\n\nSeulement quelques lignes à le hâte pour te remercier du joli petit mouchoir que j'ai reçus de toi aujourd'hui. Il va à merveille avec une robe de cotonnade bleue et blanche que je me suis fais faire pour l'été prochain donc il vient très à propos. Les gants de Mme Gray sont aussi arrivés aujourd'hui. Elle est vraiment bien bonne de penser à moi et je suis bien contente de les avoir -- comme tu peux croire. J'ai donné les deux prs à Maman qui te remerciera sans doute elle même. J'ai eu une très gentille petite épingle d'Elise or cela rien mais je me sens très riche. Avant de l'oublier envoies moi si tu peux une photographie de toimême, Russell et des mioches -- je n'en ai jamais eu des derniers - car il ne m'en reste pas une seul. On me les a toutes volées -- tin types groupes-famille -- tout et je me sens tout à fait seule sans amis autour de moi. Mme Johnston voulait absoluement les voir et je les ai fait envoyer par le courrier. Il a été volé en route et me voilà -- pauvre. J'ai fais mon possible pour les recouvrer mais je ne pense jamais les revoir. Cela m'est vraiment une grande perte car j'en avais de trés intéressante et que je ne puis pas remplacer.\n\nPapa va beaucoup mieux -- presque bien mais il n'ose pas sortir par ce temps, qui bien que beau pour la saison, est pourtant trop froid pour lui. J'écris depuis cinq heures -- une heure pour ??? et je n'ai pas encore fini. Le courier part demain de grand matin. Adieu donc pour aujourd'hui. Mes souliers vernis sont arrivés à bon port il y a quelque jours. Ils vont passablement.\n\nMille baisers\n\nHélène\n\nAs tu donnés le jupon a Mme. G.? Je t'éxpédies la brocart.\n\nJe n'ai rien encore d'Aug.\n\nà propos de l'argenterie. a-t-elle été expédie?\n\nNo 21\n\nSeoul\n\nJan. 17 92\n\nDear Amy,\n\nJust a few hasty lines to thank you for the pretty little handkerchief that I received from you today. It goes marvelously well with a blue and white cotton fabric that I am having made for next summer so it is very timely. The gloves from Mrs Gray also arrived today and I am very happy to have them -- as you can believe. I gave the two pairs to Mama who without doubt will thank you for them herself. I have had a very nice little pin from Elise, without much value but I feel very rich. Before you forget send me a photograph of yourself, Russell, and the little ones -- I never had any of the last ones -- because I no longer have a single one. All of them have been stolen -- family tintypes -- and I feel quite alone without friends surrounding me. Mrs Johnston really wanted to see them and I mailed them to her. The mail was stolen en route and here am I -- poor. I did everything possible to recover them but I think I will never see them again. It is truly an awful loss because I had many very interesting pictures and I cannot replace them.\n\nPapa is much better -- almost well but he dares not go out in this weather, even though it is good for the season, it is perhaps too cold for him. I have been writing for five hours -- an hour for ??? and I have not yet finished. The mail leaves tomorrow late morning. Goodby then for today. My varnished shoes safely arrived several days ago. They are passable.\n\nA thousand kisses.\n\nHelen\n\nHave you given the dress to Mrs G.? I am expediting the brocade.\n\nI have nothing yet from Aug.\n\nAs for the silverware, has it been expedited?\n\n30 January\n\nLetter dated only January, but first postmark is 30 January.\n\nSeoul, Corea\n\nJanuary\n\nMy dearest Amy\n\nIf I could only see you walk into my room how infinitely delighted I should be to see you & the children, but as it is I must make the best of it, thinking of you as growing stronger & the littles ones in full merriment and mischief. I owe you many thanks for the two pairs of gloves you sent me - I needed them much, they are precisely the colours I should have selected & fit me well. I've not been out of the house for a month until the last two days when Papa insisted upon my taking a walk & I feel much better for it. My rheumatism tries me sorely. To hold a pen at times seems almost impossible. Maxima is ever ready to take hers in hand, & she writes unceasingly & has told you that Papa had an attack of influenza which housed him for a month or more. The last two days he has felt much better. How is Addie? Do ask her to write me & tell me how John and the baby are and don't forget to give me the ondits32 of your own little bairns. I have laughed more than I can tell you of their ondits. I can't hold my pen the pain in my wrist and fingers is most trying. You must make allowance for it under the circumstances. With kindest remembrances to Mrs Gray & Miss Gray33 and many kisses for the children & write me soon. Your letters are always interesting and most welcome. Love ever your fond mother who longs to see you.\n\nJ. L. Heard\n\n10 February\n\nSeoul, Febry 10 1892\n\nDear Amy,\n\nMax is engaged to von Brandt! I don't know whether she has told you this herself, but I have kept it secret a long time at his request and tell now because it will become well known before a great while & my chief reasons for not speaking of it have ceased to exist. You will recollect writing to me to ask if anything of this kind was contemplated, & I told you so far as I knew, nothing had taken place. A very few weeks afterwords. However Max in answer to some remark of mine went & got a letter of him to me in which he speaks of his love for her & asks for her hand. She had had it a few days and had been waiting an oppy to speak of it. She was very much ému for her. I told her I only cared for what was for her happiness, & pointed out the difference of age, he 56 and she 23, but she said she had thought of all this and didn't care. She supposed they wd have put out of talk abt. it, but she was very much attached to him, & wanted me to say yes. As that is the only objection I could have -- seriously -- and she was so very determined & had made up her own mind so definitely, of course there was nothing to be said. He is a fine fellow and but for the difference in age I think will make her an excellent husband.\n\nHe said he could not come immediately , & suggested that nothing should be said about it till he could to avoid all the talk that wd be inevitable, & as I was equally disposed to take time, I was glad to consent to silence. I thought it would give Max an oppy to think it over more seriously & I was as anxious as he to avoid unnecessary talk. In the troubled state of China it was impossible for him to leave his post, & in winter the river is frozen & one cannot get out. He will probably come down here in Mch or April, & not improbably the marriage will take place then, though nothing has been said about that yet.\n\nMax is as much in love as if her fiancé were 30, & he seems to be the same. Their letters are constant & very voluminous.\n\nYou must keep all this strictly to yourself and not let Max know I hve told you. Your answer to this must be in a separate piece of paper & included in another which I can show.\n\nMy fingers are so cold, I can hardly hold a pen & I fear you will not be able to read this. Certainly not without difficulty.\n\nThursday night before last 2o below zero Fahr. & 2 nights before 4o below, & a scarcity of coal. Yours ever with love to Russell & kisses to the bambins.\n\nAH\n\nOne reason I did not tell you before was that you might say \"I did not know\" with a clear consciounce if you were questioned as no doubt you would be . For the same reason that moved you to write to me asking the question.\n\n13 February\n\nSeoul, Febry 13 1892\n\nDear Amy,\n\nIt has been a great pain to me that I have not been able to recognize my relation to the small Augustine, whom I love with all my heart, and I enclose herein a cheque for $25. which please employ in procuring for him a cup, or such other reminder of me as you think best. A silver cup is most appropriate, it seems to me. Ask Russell not to present my cheque for a fortnight or so, so as to insure my remittance has reached the bank. We have beautiful spring like weather for two days past. The snow is melting fast. And the streets are in a state! Je ne vous dis que ca! --\n\nLove to all from all. The mail goes out unexpectedly this P.M.\n\nYoursever,\n\nA.H.\n\n19 February\n\nSeoul, Corea\n\nFebruary 19th\n\nMy darling Amy\n\nI should have answered your letter sooner & to tell you how delighted I was to hear that you were regaining in strength & the little tribe were happy & well.\n\nMaxima is like Papa never happier than when he takes pen in hand at which I wonder as my rheumatism makes it impossible for me to hold my pen. I charged Maxima to thank you for thinking of me & sending the gloves they fit me well. The fingers are a little short, but it is I suppose the result of my swollen hands. Papa since the last few days is quite himself again, gaining in strength at which I wonder for we have had two severe snow storms. Maxima is absorbed in her trousseau, working hard, making her underclothes & dresses with the aid of a tailor who follows her instructions. She is at it the live long day & evening & I will say she succeeds wonderfully well. There are no shops here but she writes to a friend in Shanghai who sends her samples & in that way she orders what she needs. Don't forget that you are not to allude to Maxima's marriage. It is not announced & she does not wish to have it known. I wnated you to know it you are in fact the only one who does except Papa & myself. With much love from all of us ever.\n\nYrs affectionately, J.L.H.\n\n11 March\n\n24\n\nSeoul\n\nle 11 mars 92\n\nChère Amy, Merci, merci mille fois de ta bonne petite lettre du 26-27 Jan. qui m'a fait beaucoup beaucoup de plaisir. J'avais si peur que tu me sois désappointée! Maintenant je ne puis qu'espérer que le jour ne sera pas trop iloigné [?] ou je pourrai vous présenter l'un à l'autre et que tu pourras en toute vérité lui `serrer les mains.' Mais à propos du secret voici pourquoi. Il a demandé à Papa de ne pas en parler avant qu'il ne vienne au printemps, à qui que ce soit. Il a une raison, mai je ne puis te la dire en ce moment et si je fais mal en gardant le silence envers Jean et Addie j'en suis très fachée et ne le fais, comme tu peux bien croire, que très à contrecoeur. Ce n'est en vérité que la nécessité qui m'a dédié la langue envers toi plutôt qu'à elle, si tu peux me pardonner un tel aveu, et j'ai cru que tu le comprendrai. Mais comme tu dis - mes lettres soit un peu incohérentes et je ne me suis peutêtre pas bien expliqué. Tu peu être bien sûre que j'écrirai à Addie au plus tôt possible et en attendant je te remercie de ta réserve envers elle car je sais que ce doit étre difficile. Je suis très content que tu ne lui ai pas demandé la caisse pour moi, il m'a semblé après le départ de ma lettre que j'en avais demandé trop.\n\nLes jours passent, l'un aprè l'autre sans changement. Le temps est affreux, les courriers n'arrivent pas et Papa et moi avons été souffrants depuis plusieurs semaines. Lui avec sa diarrhée moi d'indigestion. Je suis maigre à faire peur mais j'ai trop à faire pour y penser. Les courriers sont désesperants et je suis quelque-fois, même bien souvent, 5 et 6 semaines sans nouvelles de Péking. C'est à en devenir folle quelquefois.\n\nJe suis bien contente que les paquets soient arrivés en bon état. Et j'éspère que la grande envelope bleue, avec le brocard et mon portrait* fera de même.\n\nIl est mauvais -- c'est à dire pas juste mais le meillieur que j'ai eu a ce moment.\n\nGardes-les.\n\nTu as raison, mes lettres sont incohérentes. Mais que veux tu? en ce moment même je suis si exité par ta lettre que je n'ai pas une idée en tête et il faut pourtant que j'écrire car le courier part ce soir -- ou dans dix jours. Remercie Russell de son petit mot que j'étudierai à tête reposée. Je lui écrirai. Merci de tout -- mille fois. Tu es bien bonne. En attendant ne te tourmentes pas du reste -- certes non que nous n'allons pas nous marier en cachette, mais pour le moment je ne puis rien dire. Je t'ai demandéde ne pas en parler à Papa car je ne lui as pas dit que je l'écrirai à ce sujet. Il est très impatient de l'écrire à la famille et ce serait assez pour l'enflammer. Ne m'appelles pas Hélène plus qu'auparavant. Au contraire je tiens plus que jamais maintenant à mon nom de garçon. Tu peux faire la distinction en l'appelant Brandt, ce qui je crois sera en somme le meilleur moyen.\n\nMille baisers -\n\nH.M.H.\n\nPapa te prie de faire parvenir cette lettre (ci-inclu) au Dr. Hermann [?]. Il est trop fatigué pour t'écrire lui-même.\n\nM.\n\nJ'ai écris à Addie le 5 -- le 26 décembre -- le 18 janvier -- le 7 février. Je n'ai rien reçu d'elle dupuis le 22 novembre. Est-elle fachée? crois tu ou a-t-elle été malade?\n\n24\n\nSeoul\n\n11 March 92\n\nDear Amy, Thank you, thank you a thousand times for your good little letter of 26-27 Jan. which gave me great pleasure. I was so afraid that you would be disappointed with me. Now I can only hope that the day will not be to far where I will be able to present you to each other and you will be able truely to shake hands. But a propos the secret, here is why. He asked Papa to not speak of it before he comes in the spring, to anyone. He has a reason, but I cannot explain it at this time and if I do wrong in guarding the silence towards John and Addie, I am very angry and I do it, as you can well believe, very unwillingly. It is in truth only necessity which has directed my words towards you rather than her, if you can pardon me for saying so, and I believe that you will understand, but as you say -- my letters are a little incoherent and I have not well explained myself. You can be quite sure that I will will write Addie as soon as possible while waiting to thank you for your reserve towards her because I know that it must be difficult. I am very content that you have not asked her for the chest for me, it seemed to me after the departure of my letter that I was asking for too much.\n\nThe days pass, one after another without change. The weather is awful, the mail does not arrive and Pappa and I have been suffering for several weeks. He with diarrhea and I with indigestion. I am frightningly thin but I have to much to do to think about it. The mail is appaling and I am sometimes, even often, 5 or 6 weeks without news from Peking. It is sometimes enough to go crazy.\n\nI am well content that the packages arrived in good shape. And I hope that the large blue envelope, with the brocade and my portrait* will be the same.\n\n*It is bad --that is to say not good but the best that I had at the time.\n\nKeep them.\n\nYou are right, my letters are incoherent. But what do you want? Even at this moment I am so excited by your letter that I have no idea in mind and perhaps I must write since the mail leaves tonight -- or in ten days.\n\nThank Russell for his note which I will study at leisure. I will write him. Thanks for everything -- a thousand times. Your are very good. While waiting do not torment yourself with the rest. Certainly we are not going to marry in secret, but for the moment I can say nothing. I asked you to not talk of this with Papa because I have not told him that I would write you on this subject. He is very impatient to write it to the family and it would be enough to inflame him. Don't call me Hélène more than before. On the contrary, I hold more than ever to my boy's name. You can make the distinction by calling him Brandt, which I believe will be the best means when all is said and done.\n\nA thousand kisses --\n\nH.M. H.\n\nPapa asks you to forward the enclosed letters to Dr. Hermann. He is too fatigued to write you himself.\n\nM.\n\nI wrote to Addie on the 5th -- the 26th of December -- the 18th of January --the 7th of February. I have received nothing from her since the 22nd of November. Is she angry? Do you believe or has she been sick?\n\n10 July\n\nShanghai\n\nSunday, July 10th 5:45 a.m.\n\nDear Papa,\n\nI am momentarily expecting Mrs Low's boy to call for me & scribble off a few lines while waiting to tell you of my safe arrival, so that I may send it by first steamer. We had a smooth passage but very foggy, which accounts for delay. We should have been in yesterday at noon, instead of which we put in at 11:30p.m. I went to bed & was quite disgusted when 15 minutes after Mrs L's boy appeared. I told him to return this morning at six. It is hot but not unbearable & the breeze is cool.\n\nThe Captain has been kind & attentive but the time slows as you can imagine. It seems at least a week since I left you. How are you & Mama? Take good care of yourself & don't run about too much in the hot sun & don't worry about me.\n\nWith love & kisses to both\n\nYrs H.M.H.\n\n20 Foochow Rd.\n\nDear Papa,\n\nI find that the mail does not close until tomorrow, so I have time to add a few lines. Mr. Low came himself to meet me this morning & both he & Mrs Low have been most warm & kind in their welcome. They had already heard rumors of my engagement to Brandt & were therefore not surprised, but Mrs. L. seems disposed to help me with what I have to do & we have been talking chiffons a good deal. She says that the tailors can make perfectly after a pattern without trying on. So please send me Mamma's red waist trimming with black guipure34, which fits her best, I think, by return mail. It will fold into small compass without injury & will come safely in a thick paper. Then give me the measure in inches from the waist to bottom of the shirt in front & behind also around hips over petticoat not dress. I should have brought them with me but that I did not think it possible to do without trying one.\n\nI have an invitation from Mme Vissiére(French Consul General's wife) for the evening of the 14th. This afternoon we drive out to a Mrs Flotheow to tea. She is a very nice German I believe. I begin work tomorrow but the dentist cannot see me before Wednesday -- he kept his time for me last week & is now engaged. Mr. Lamsonmain soupirant is here & anxious to see me. He asked Mr. Low confidentially & with much interest if it were true that I was engaged & would he please let him know if he could. The weather looks uncertain & is not at all oppressive tho' very damp.\n\nOne or two people are dining here to meet me on Wednesday, so altogether I am petted & quite comfortable.\n\nDon't forget Mamma's dress.\n\nEver afftly\n\nH.M.H.\n\n13 July\n\nShanghai\n\nJuly 13th\n\nDear Papa,\n\nI am just back from my first scéance at the dentist's, and I am sorry to say the outlook is not attractive. My teeth are worse than I thought which is saying a good deal. Twenty three cavities! nineteen of which are in the upper jaw alone, while two of them are so bad that they will require treatment before they can be filled. By going every day I hope to get through in a fortnight.\n\nI took the typewriter back this morning. There was nothing to pay on it. I have not yet seen about your underclothes but will try to do it tomorrow. Mrs Denney's amah35 has just (a month ago) been engaged by Mrs Jordan who has taken her to England & expects to keep her a year or two. But Mrs. Low says she knows of another good one. She is to come to see me. I looked about for the King's present & found nothing except some imitation Lèous vases. The large ones Mrs Low chose are $200 & I should think more than you need give. They are not first rate without being very ordinary. They had others rather smaller for $100., $120. & 80. I prefered the ones of a $100. & 80. about 16 inches high, perhaps a little more. The choice is very limited and most of the things are not very nice.\n\nIt is not unbearably hot, much less so than at Chefoo. I am being fed up - people call. & I am having a very good time of it & enjoy the shopping hugely, after so long a holiday. Mr. Walter very kindly brought down the news from Chefoo that I was engaged to Mr. von Brandt, so that it has become town talk & I hardly dare put my nose out of the door. I saw Mr. Morse yesterday who inquired after you, as do many others. I hope you are taking care of yourself & that Mama is also well.\n\nWith love & kisses to both.\n\nEver Affectionately\n\nH.M.H.\n\n17 July\n\nPeking July 17th 1892.\n\nMy Dear Heard,\n\nMany thanks for your kind note of the 14th last and the good news it contained about yourself and Mrs Heard. I also am without news from Max but hope to hear from her before I am much older. The thought of depriving you and Mrs. Heard of her companionship is the only drop of bitterness in ??? without that perfect happiness. Here everybody is delighted at the thought of having her as doyenne and I receive from every one the kindest expressions of sympathy and the warmest felicitations, all these effusions are of course duly forwarded to her who has the largest sympathy and admiration.\n\nThe weather is rather unpleasant, everything is reeking with dampness and tho' it has not been raining for the last four days, the sky looks always very threatening. Let us hope that it won't rain any more, there has enough of misery been caused already by the preceding downpours!\n\nNothing new in politics, things look quieter in Hunan and Kuangtung but antiforeign placards are again appearing in Honan.\n\nGood bye for the present. Give my most respectrul regards to Mrs Heard and believe me with every good wish for you and yours.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMvBrant\n\nBaron von Sternnburg36 turns out to be an old acquantance of your oldest daughtor, whom he met frequently in 1885 at Lord Sackville's and Mrs Robinson's, the wife of the third secretary of the navy; I am glad that Max will find some one here to talk over her american friends; Sternburg knows everyone. -\n\nMr. Denby37 wrote a most charming letter in acknowledgement of a note from me, it was duly forwarded to Max.\n\nThe Austro-Corean treaty was signed at ????? On June 23d between Baron von Biegeleben38 and the Corean Chargé d'affaires; it is to be ratified within a year. But now, chin chin for good.\n\nYours,\n\nB.\n\n18 July\n\nShanghai\n\nJuly 18th\n\nDear Papa,\n\nYour letter of the 14th came this morning, but the parcel has not yet turned up. Doubtless it will later. You say nothing of your health? So I take it for granted that you are well., But I am sorry you & Mamma miss me so very much for I fear I am caught here & I shall probably have to remain at least ten days longer. Doing as much as I can each day it will be quick work if I can then get off., I was so worn out & good for nothing yesterday that I had to back out of a tea out of town & a dinner & take to my bed. Today I feel better & begin my siege at the dentist's once more. It has been fairly cool so far but today it is terribly hot & I feel as if I had got into a bath with my clothes on. About our marriage you know as much as I do. I presume it will be quiet, that is we shall invite people to the church only, so there is nothing to do in the way of preparation that I can think of. Brandt is trying to get the Admiral & some of the squadron in Chefoo for that time, in which case we may be married on board the flagship, which means of course more of an affair, tho' nothing would devolve on us I think in the way of entertainment. But it is so hard to settle things by letter & everything takes so long to do that I think it will be little short of a miracle if anything gets done when we think. If that wretched Emperor would only telegraph us we might settle matters better. It has been very hard this last week to keep people quiet & I have been much annoyed by congratulations which I have constantly refused. Mr & Mrs Low have also been asked if it were true & I am looked upon with curiousity which is sometimes embarrassing. I think Mr. Walter started it, no thanks to him! Mr. Lamson has called but I was out. Mrs L. saw him yesterday at the tea & he asked her particularly about you, saying that you had stopped writing. I hope to see him before I go. You probably have my letter about the royal present, & other things. I have seen nothing better than the vases.\n\nThe Vissière are stationed here now. He is consul general which is a promotion for him. Their fête was pretty the other evening, but there were too few people. Having been here but a short time few have called. We had a pleasant sail with the McLeods [???] on Saturday. They do not go to Chefoo before the end of August or beginning of Sept. Have the Bunkers arrived or any other Seoul lights? It is too hot to write & there really is not much to say. Everyone asks after you -- & the old comprador. Ak-ke [?] inquired for the whole family & was sorry you were not coming here. Several of the Hong servants were interested in my coming as your daughter.\n\nKiss to Mama\n\nYours affectly\n\nH.M.H.\n\n19 July\n\nChefoo, July 19 1892\n\nDear Amy,\n\nYour petit mot of 8 June answered well enough my own feelings, or rather what would have been my own feelings with any one else than von Brandt but I have so high an opinion of him that I had no doubts of his reasons for delay were perfectly proper. At first as I wrote you I was perfectly disposed that nothing should be said about it in order to give Max the time to reflect on the situation but reflection delay only seemed to increase her ardor, & as I wrote you by the last mail you might have supposed them both in their teens!\n\nOn the 7th they departed he for Peking She for Shanghai, it being understood that he should return to ??? and the wedding take place soon afterward. But Max wrote me from Sh. that the report of her engagement seemed to be current there and she cd not put her foot outside of her door.\n\nAnd yester day I recd a letter from Brandt to say there was so much talk it was useless to undertake to keep the matter secret any longer; so I have spoken of it to two or three people here. Before he went away he wrote Mrs Low to tell her.\n\nMax has behaved very well in all this business. It has been no doubt a great trial to her patience but she has infinite confidence in her fiancée & I would not say a word to disturb it. I do not understand however why he put off his application to the Emperor so long & I shall one day ask him. I fully expected him in Korea at end of May & was much annoyed when he did not come. We are delighted with the pictures at the children, & wish - oh, how much, we could see them and you. Kiss them for us, & don't forget us. We are going to feel very much alone!\n\nYrs, AH\n\nYour mother always liked von Brandt very much, but in the present case she can't get over the disparity of years. She thinks it dreadful! -- & all other considerations are as nothing.\n\n20 July\n\nShanghai\n\nJuly 20th\n\nDear Papa,\n\nYou will think that I always write in a hurry, and very right you will be, but the fact is the days seem hardly long enought to accomplish anything in. The dentist takes such a slice out of each day, which practically ends at four o'clock when I have to dress & go to the parlor, to see anybody who may call. After five we invariably go out to return calls or to drive; or as yesterday to drop in at the country club, where I saw the Lamsons. I was beginning to think I never should, but he was very empressé & as nice & amusing as ever. Hot & in a decided négligé after playing tennis he was not handome but I enjoyed the few minutes relaxation from the heavy stilted conversation of the others. He asked most particularly after you & was troubled with the thought that he had said something in his last letter which had offended you, as you had not answered him. I reassured him on that score & explained that you had been ill etc. He seemed relieved. Monday evening I had a pleasant chat with Mr. Fearson (James) who joined us at the gardens. He was unusually sociable & agreable.\n\nI see nothing else for the present. -- Thanks for your letters & those enclosed, I return Uncle John's for you to read. It must be a nuisance to have the Bunker's next door, to say nothing of the others. My teeth are very troublesome & painful to work on & I cannot possibly get away before the end of next week even taking two sittings a day for two or three days. I dare not do it oftener it is such a strain on my nerves. Mama's waist came all right -- no books in the box - & the tailor is at work on her dress for the wedding. I trust she will like it. Let me have your measures for dressing gown & I can have that attended to. I really do not see why Amy needs to worry over the secrecy of my engagement. I have weritten home & we shall speak of it here very soon & if trying to anyone it is to me, especially of late. The Low's send remembrances. I many kisses to you & Mama.\n\nEver afftly\n\nH.M. H.\n\nI was shocked to see the death of Walker Blaine in the papers.\n\nThe amah I had enjoyed now throws me up for another place and I am again on the hunt. I am afraid I shall not get so good a one again.\n\n21 July\n\nChefoo, July 21 1892\n\nDear Amy,\n\nI enclose a note from Max recd. this morning which will give you the latest news of her, & also one from von Brandt recd. an hour later. Which I think you wd be pleased to see. It gives you a touch of coleur locale.\n\nSternburg in German Secy of legation, I believe.\n\nYrs A.H.\n\nMrs Denby is the wife of the Am. Minister & at present the \"leading lady\" in Peking. Max will push her from that position!\n\n23 July\n\nPeiking July 23d 1892\n\nMy Dear Heard,\n\nMany thanks for your letter of July 18 which reached here today rather more quickly than I could expect taking into consideration the state of the river which is still very bad, the Peiko having broken through the dykes some miles above Tsentien [??] and flooded the country there. I hope you did not take amiss my remark about Denby as attributing to you any part in the ???? he and the others had been indulging in. It was not intended certainly to ???? what ?????. Now that I have got over the angry feeling caused by people's talking. I am rather glad that they spent so much time and breath in discussing the probability; when they learnt the news nothing remained but the miles of human kindness, all the fizz having gone off and I must say I have seen nothing but kind and sympathetic faces and heard nothing but ???? words. Max is such a general favourite that I feel that everybody is envying me my happiness. To a certain extent, and nothing is ???? better ??? if the proverbs are true.\n\nI had a bad and at some moments a rather dangerous passage but I carried my point and arrived on the day on which I had said I would arrive. Pigheadedness as I call it now, strength of character as I used to call it when younger and vainer.\n\nYou say nothing about your health wich I take to be a good sign; besides Shavermeier+ [???] tells me that you are improving daily. I hope he judges the stae of things rightly. -- As to the marriage of an american with a foreigner we had only one instance here I can remember. Miss Nina Howard (a) with Mr Kipperley, they were married at the British Legation and afterward at the Legation chapel and then at the catholic church, the american authorities taking, to my knowledge, no part in the proceedings. The Consul certainly was not up here. --\n\nUgly placard appear again in Hunan, but we get only what we merit.\n\nI hope Mrs Heard is doing well, give my warmest and most respectful regards to her and believe me, my dear Heard, with every good wish for you and yours.\n\nYours very truly\n\nM v Brandt\n\nI have good news from Max tho' the dentist is very hard upon her.\n\n+German Consul\n\n30 July\n\nChefoo, July 30\n\nDear Amy,\n\nNothing from you by last mail. Max will be back tomorrow, & we shall be glad to see her. It is very lonely without her. I enclose one of her late notes from Shanghai, & I have sent my brother John a letter of felicitations from Denby, our minister at Peking, highly appreciative of von Brandt. It only expresses my own opinion, but coming from an outsider will have with others more authority! I have asked him to send it to you. The marriage will probably take place abt. Aug 20. The whole country between Peking & the sea is under water, the river swollen by the most heavy rains having broken its ???? and Brandt will have a difficult, not to say dangerous task to get down, but no doubt hew will manage it somehow.\n\nAllen writes me that he as seen Wharton's resignation in a late paper, which I am very sorry to hear. As Blaine is out, this leaves me without any friend at court, & sometimes one is useful.\n\nReflecting on Max's loss makes me feel how old I am. I have not till lately realized it much, but your mother & I will have to support each others' tottering steps. Her health, thank God, is perfectly good, but her loss of hearing & memory is sometimes very trying.\n\nI wish I could hear that you were well. Russell says that you are stronger, but your eyes are troublesome & a sign of weakness. If you could could all come & camp in my ??? for a couple of months this autumn or next spring, it would do you a world of good, & give me a world of delight. My pictures of the little ones give me infinite pleasure.\n\nYours evr\n\nA.H.\n\n10 August\n\nChefoo, Aug. 10\n\nMy Dear Amy,\n\nI telegraphed Russell yesterday that -- \"Emperor refuses consent Marriage postponed\" -- & there is not much more to say. I received yesterday a letter from von Brandt to that effect, & saying that he would be here on the 20th. He says he considers Max released though he is indissolubly bound. He shall hand in his resignation and on its acceptance shall again ask her if she is willing to join his more modest fortunes. He evidently ??? it as the end of his career & feels bitterly such treatment after 33 years of faithful & honorable service. There is a reglement that ministers shall not marry without this consent, but it has been looked upon as a matter of form, & I know myself many marriages Germans in official life and American women.\n\nMax bears it very well and seems to be fonder of him then ever. I told her she had an oppy now of knowing whether her affection was more to the office or the man, & her answer is not doubtful. But it is a great blow to her & her resistance to it shows the active strength of her character. I am quite proud of her.\n\nIt seems a wanton piece of heartless cruelty, & you know my feelings perfectly without the necessity of any big words on my part. No one is more astonished than other Germans in govt service, who knew Brandt's ??? to consideration & how rarely this right has been exercised by the Sovereigns. I do hope somebody will tap the head of this wretched Emperor, & let some of the wind out, & I am dispirited to ln that Russia seems of late disposed to make friends with him.\n\nThere is no objection to giving the reason for the postponement of the marriage, but without comment. There is no use to embitter the situation, or make a change of opinion more difficult and for the same reason it is not for us to make any allusion to B's intention to hand in his resignation. So please do not mention it. There is nothing to be done or said -- but wait.\n\nMax will have to spend another winter in Korea! I shan't be sorry, but she will!\n\nThere is nothing more to add. We are all pretty well & shall be happy to get back to our own roof ???. Though Chefoo has done us good.\n\nMuch love & kisses to the children from your mother & myself.\n\nYours evr\n\nA.H.\n\n16 September\n\nSeoul, Sept 16 1892\n\nDear Amy,\n\nI hope we are not going to be deprived of the pleasure of seeing your writing much longer. It is all well to hear that your are improving; we can rejoice at that, but we should like to hear it from your own lips. I am tempted to wonder if you can read writing, since you cannot see to write; & when I reflect what a dreadful scribble my writing has become I no longer think it readable. However it is a pleasure for me to talk with you, so I will suppose you are there to listen and continue my bavardage. Max keeps up wonderfully. She has her deep fits of depression, but they are not long or frequent. I told her at the first that the best way to fight off her own grief was to try to take an interest in the concerns of others, & she has acted in the spirit. She ordinarily gives no sign of sorrowing, & a stranger would not notice tha she was not in her usual ????, but to me she is very different from the gay girl of a year ago.\n\nI confess I have more misgivings about the course of affairs than she has ?????. It would be very easy if the authorities were likely to ??? into his ????, & try to carry them out. But I'm afraid the worse will be the case, & they will try to thwart him & his projects.\n\nMr. ???? is for home as soon as he receives his letters from ????. I learn what the Emperor's refusal means which will be at the end of this month to send in his resignation & at its acceptance, which Max expects to be immediate, to come down here as soon as the river opens, say end of March or April. They wd then be married and go home -- to Europe. In this she admits there may be a doubt - as B. told us the \"resignation\" may be accepted here & he may be put in disponibilitis the only practical difference being that in the latter case his annual pension is $1000 less. Brandt says they must accept his resignation. The only possibility is they may offer him a year's leave which he would take means to avoid.\n\nBut it seems to me that if they don't want to get rid of him, but want to prevent him from marrying an American, there are a good many ways to give him annoyance & delay, if of not actually ultimately checkmating him, & I cannot help fearing they will be practiced. They may begin by offering him a year's leave, which he will decline; but that will take time. They may accept his resignation, but require him to keep his post till his successor is named & arrives.\n\nIn fact there are more ways than one to kill a cat. And with such a cat and such an Emperor nothing is too much to expect. B. is not a man to be patient under ??? or to submit to injustice; but there are limitations, & the German system is so utterly soul-killing & arbitrary that no exaction would surprise me! I hope to live long enough to see some of the gas punched out of it. Brandt is not a Prussian by heredity, which accts for his being a decent fellow. Kiss the boys for me. Their pictures are a great delight.\n\nAs ever\n\nA.H.\n\n20 September\n\n20 Sept\n\nDear Amy,\n\nI enclose a note to Arthur Dexter, wd. please send to him.\n\nWe are having a dinner of missionaries tonight. I enclose note from one of them, whom we think of as most promising. I also enclose the back of the envelope with my address. He has been here rather over a year & ought to know better. The writing is as typical of the phrasiology.\n\nThe English missionaries are educated men & gentlemen. We have none of the \"Inland Mission\" here. They are all Church of England men.\n\nYours ever\n\nA.H.\n\nAugustine Heard\n\nAmerican Consul Genl.\n\nDear Mr. Heard\n\nYour kind invitation for Monday eve recieved and I accept with frank hospitality.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.M. Brown\n\n17 October\n\n[Seems to be a journal entry in Max's handwriting.]\n\nWe started for the palace39 at half past two, Mrs Allen going with me. Mrs Great.40 joined us en route. We were taken half way round the palace grounds by a back gate, thru' which we started half way back again only on the inside of the walk instead of out. After about 5 minutes we were put down at the gate of one of the miserable inside courts, which left us but a few steps to take before reaching the position where we were to wait. We were met at the foot of the high stone steps by Min Chong Ho, cousin of the Queen41, a handsome young man speaking English perfectly; at the top by two court ladies, old hags of nearly seventy yrs. in the most indescribable of dresses, almost fascinating in its ugliness. Tiny feet in the universal white stocking, a few inches of white trouser showing around the ankle. Then a round, balloning, bulging mass of shirts of all colors, & hitched & hoisted round in every possible way. The shoulders covered by a tiny jacket of a lighter brighter shade of green than the outside shirt. Their wizened faces were framed in by a huge head dress of false hair ??? down over the ears & touching the shoulders so that they could with difficulty move their heads about. Over this mass of hair was a spread eagled ??? arrangement of heavy black lacquered wood. A troup of maids of all ranks & grades, in simpler dresses of silk & of the same style, usually green shirts & yellow jackets, with great rount balls of hair in the backs of their heads, stood closely packed around us, while the eunuchs walked about asking questions of our interpreters. The pavillion was clean & nicely papered in Korean style with the exception of a large center table & chairs. We waited about 20 minutes, then leaving our wraps we were marched across a courtyard up a flight of stone steps to the position where the King Queen & Crown Prince stood behind little square tables, surrounded by a sinister crowd of maids as that around the ladies of the court. We walked up quite near and bowing to each in turn we came & stood before the King & Queen who were side by side, their son off on the right at right angles. It was very much like playing at school as we had the usual stereotyped questions put to us in turn. How we liked Korea? Were we comfortable? How many children etc. After about fifteen minutes perhaps less we were dismissed the Queen having expressed her regrets at not having been able to receive us before as she had been ill in the morning, but that tomorrow we should receive a present as a remembrance. Their majesties were both much interested & amused by Mr. Ducitieschy's [???] two little boys, to whom they gave small painted gauze fans & little embroidered pouches.\n\nThe Queen is small, not pretty but having grace & charm of manner. She was affable & talkative. Her face was as white as this paper with powder & paste & she also wore a huge chignon minus the wooden thing. Instead she had Chinese jewelry stuck in all around it which was quite becoming & quaint. But her teeth were horrible -- black & irregular. As she stood behind the table I could not see the detail of her dress well but it seemed to consist of a very long & voluminous shirt of dark blue gause or thin silk with a side border woven in gold. A longish Chinese looking jacket of bright ret satin thickly covered with gold & out of the side sleeves of which fell white gause sleeves also with a gold border. She kept her hands carefully concealed in these except when she put them up to her head for a moment to push forward the mass of her hair which seemed to drag; or when she gave the toys to the children. The King did not speak to us, only played with the boys across the table. I was very much pleased with him & found him almost handsome in his gorgeous red & gold gown. The Crown Prince is an idiot or looks like one. -- As we came out I noticed a delicious fragrance in the courtyard. Turning back twd. Min who was a few steps behind me, I noticed that the King & Queen had followed us out to the top of the steps. She wished my questions repeated to her, then invited me to walk about the park. -- The scent came from a number of pots of flowers but I do not know the name of the plant.\n\nFinding our wraps in the waiting room we started for our walk but had not gone far before we came to the back of the audience hall, on the piazza of which their majesties had come out with their ???. I was standing on a raised terrace across the yard, which is as much a part of a Korean house as the front door is of ours. Mrs Greathouse on my left, Min on my right, directly in front of the King. Mrs G. pointed to a bronze sundial on a stone pedestal by which we stood, asking what it was.42 The King saw me put my hand on it & shouted across -- did we have sun dials in America? I assured him that we did not use them any more having clocks. How did we regulate them? By the sun. And how did we know -- ? By insruments one of which was called a sextant. Oh yes! That was used on ships did we use it on land too?\n\nThe whole situation was ludicrous, he with his suite, I with mine consisting of Mrs. G. Mamma, Mrs S Mrs D. with the boys, then Jap. Consul's wife, him & two Jap. amahss -- but I had some difficulty keeping my face straight when he asked if we took the position of the sun by day or by night!\n\nThere was nothing to see in the way of flowers as we returned to our pavillion where the table had been set in our absense. We were given a foreign dinner, bad of course. Two ladies in waiting taking the ends of the table. I sat between Mrs. G. and Min Chong Ho.\n\nI managed to see so much of it all as I had asked permission to keep on my spectacles, as I said that like my father I could not see without them.\n\nMama wore her red gown with black lace & diamonds. I wore a pale blue silk V back & front, with a little white lace around the fichu & elbow sleeves - my parure of turqoise & diamonds. Mrs D. also in evening dress. The other ladies in walking dress & bonnets. It was all rather curious and interesting, but more so to look back upon than at the time. M. Min told me that of all the women that he saw none were allowed to marry. We got home at half past vive.\n\nOct. 21st. The Queen sent Mamma & me a quantity of presents. We each recieved 4 very fine bamboo window screens, 2 small mats, 2 pieces (22 yds each) of finely hand quilted silk a most marvelous work of patience; 4 piece of a very thin soft & flimsey white silk, 2 pieces of white gauze (nice), 2 écu grass cloth - coarse, a soap stone box, a small embroidered pouch smelling very strongly of sumac, and 10 common lacquered fans. A perfect pony load. All the other ladies who were received got the same."
