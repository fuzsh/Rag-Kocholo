        "text": "Belgian-born French screenwriter and film director Lucas Belvaux (b. 1961) was a jury member at the Brussels International Film Festival last June, so consequently, this five-time César-nominee spent quite some time in Brussels to see and judge a string of films screened at the Festival. Formerly a screen actor (1980s) who gradually turned to screenwriting and directing (early 1990s), he became a reliable and creative force in the French film industry with a new film every two to three years. His latest features are “Pas son genre” (a.k.a. “Not My Type,” 2014) and “Chez nous” (a.k.a. “This Is Our Land,” 2017), both with Émilie Dequenne in the leading role.\n\nI met Mr. Belvaux in a Brussels hotel lobby to talk about his craft as a filmmaker, right after the World Cup’s football match France vs. Argentina which he had watched in his hotel room, and before he attended the closing ceremonies of the Festival later that same evening.\n\nMr. Belvaux, in your films, there’s always a lot of dialogue. Is that essential to you when you’re telling a story?\n\nThat’s true, there is a lot of dialogue, and it’s essential, but in a film there’s always much more to it than just the dialogue. The expression and the body language of the actors are crucial components as well, so you have to look at the whole picture. When you got a scene, and at a certain point the dialogue ends, that’s when facial expressions and movements take over. So as a director, you need to take advantage of everything you can imagine to tell your story or to capture the emotions you are looking for. You take everything into consideration: the dialogue, how the actors play their scenes, their movements—there’s really nothing you can overlook. I’m always aware of that when I write a screenplay. In that early stage, I also try to figure out where the camera should be, and in the meantime, I’m already cutting the film. That helps me when I’m writing.\n\nWhen you’re writing your screenplays, do you already have certain actors or actresses in mind?\n\nSometimes. When I can’t find someone right away, I tend to think of actors who passed away. This could be something for Robert Mitchum, for example. It may seem strange, but it always helps if you can imagine a familiar face saying the lines you’re about to write.\n\nIs it an advantage for you as a film director that you have been an actor yourself for many years, and if so, to what extend is it useful?\n\nYou’re aware of their worries, the difficulties—any problems the actors might face on the set. We interact a lot, we talk all the time, and I’m always very open and communicative with my actors. You have to. When I make a film, I consider myself a conductor of an orchestra. That’s a comparison I like.\n\nDo you have a specific way to cast your roles?\n\nNot really, there are no rules as far as I’m concerned. Sometimes I cast actors that I know personally or have worked with in the past, or people I simply would like to work with.\n\nWhen you write a screenplay, do you keep in mind that an audience will see it later on?\n\nYes, because you’re writing a story they have to understand. After all, I can’t be the only one who appreciates the story that is being told on the screen. A screenwriter writes—and very often rewrites his screenplay or his scenes over and over again—just to make sure every situation or every detail is as clear to the audience as it is in his own head, and there’s no time to lose, it must happen right way: that’s when the audience sees your film. So when I work on a screenplay, I write. That’s it. When I write a scene, I don’t really think about the structure of the screenplay. I know the characters, I know who they are, how they relate to one another, and what they will do within the limited time frame of roughly two hours. I take notes in between the writing process whenever I get an idea, and in the end, it all has to come together. Sometimes when I start working on a new script, I don’t even know how the film will end. But that doesn’t matter, as long as I know what the story is about. If it’s a story about a married couple, will they still be together by the end of the film? That depends on what happens along the way; maybe they will have to work out a solution to make their relationship stronger. So sometimes, it’s a good thing to write with an open mind, see what happens and then come up with a reasonable outcome.\n\nAre you critical of your own work?\n\nYou know, it’s very strange because you never see your film for the first time to judge it properly. You write the film; then when you’re shooting you see the rushes, you edit the film… It’s a work in progress that you see all the time for a year and a half or two years. And then when the film is released, it’s not even all that different from what you have seen the whole time. That makes it more difficult—at least for me—to judge it from an objective point of view. And besides, you remember everything that happened on the set, good and bad things that occurred when you were shooting, so a filmmaker never gets to see his film like an audience does.\n\nYou’ve been working as an actor and a filmmaker for more than three decades now. How did you end up in the film business?\n\nWhen I was eighteen, I left Belgium, went to Paris to study acting, and there I became an actor. It wasn’t difficult for me to leave home because I really hoped to become an actor, and I couldn’t have done that if I had stayed in my suburban hometown Profondeville. But I must tell you that I have been very lucky: I arrived in Paris in August 1979, and in January 1980 I had my first screen role for French television. Three months later, I got another part for television, and by September 1980, about one year after arriving in Paris, I did my first feature, directed by Yves Boisset [“Allons z’enfants”]. Back then, I looked younger than I really was: I was an adult but looked more like an adolescent. At the time, there were less young actors around than today, and in France, they made lots of films in those days, both for television and for cinema. If I could start all over again, I think I would follow exactly the same path. Now I am very happy to be a filmmaker, but I was glad to become an actor back then, and I learned a lot. It was a great learning experience, and besides, I would never have been able to be a filmmaker at age twenty.\n\nBrussels International Film Festival, Brussels\n\nJune 30, 2018\n\n“Chez nous” (2017, trailer), the latest feature Mr. Belvaux made up until now; he’s currently writing a new screenplay.\n\nFILMS\n\nALLONS Z’ENFANTS (1981) DIR Yves Boisset SCR Yves Boisset, Jacques Kirsner (novel by Yves Gibeau) CAM Pierre-William Glenn ED Albert Jurgenson MUS Philippe Sarde CAST Lucas Belvaux (Simon Chalumot), Jean Carmet, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Jean-François Stévenin, Jacques Denis, Eve Cotton\n\nLA TRUITE, a.k.a.
