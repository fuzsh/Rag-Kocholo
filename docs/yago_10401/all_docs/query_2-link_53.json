        "text": "WASHINGTON, April 18, 2017—The World Bank Group and&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;Violence Research Initiative&nbsp;(SVRI)&nbsp;today awarded competitive funds totaling US$1.14 million to 10 teams from around the world for innovations to prevent and respond to gender-based violence&nbsp;(GBV). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Beyond the devastating personal costs, gender-based violence inflicts a steep economic toll: estimates of resulting lost productivity run as high as 3.7 percent in some economies. The Development Marketplace Awards aim to help individuals, communities, and nations stamp out GBV. The idea for the awards, which first launched one year ago, honors GBV victims and survivors around the world, and is in memory of Hannah Graham, daughter of a longtime World Bank employee. The winners of this year’s awards range from efforts to reduce inter-partner violence among refugees in Ethiopia to community approaches to prevent gender-based violence in the Amazon of Peru. “Gender-based violence thrives on secrecy and indifference with devastating consequences,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. “We cannot stand by while so many women suffer harm that’s completely preventable. Through this competition we hope to shine a spotlight on gender-based violence and inspire innovative solutions. It is my honor to congratulate and thank the 2017 Development Marketplace winners for taking action to end GBV.” An expert panel reviewed more than 200 proposals submitted to the Bank Group and SVRI following an open call in July 2016 for innovations to prevent GBV in low- and middle-income countries. Winning teams, which received up to US$150,000 each, were chosen based on overall merit, research or project design and methods, significance, team expertise, and ethical considerations. “The efforts funded by this award will produce evidence which will enable policy makers to design effective policies and programs to prevent and respond to gender-based violence thus contributing to a world in which women and children are free of violence and able to reach their full potential,” said Alessandra Guedes, SVRI co-chair and Regional Advisor for Family Violence at the Pan-American health Organization/WHO. “The SVRI and World Bank Group have identified a global portfolio of superb innovators that we can learn from.” The SVRI Grant, a global innovation award started in 2014, previously awarded more than US$1 million to nine projects in seven countries.&nbsp;SVRI&nbsp;uses an innovative mix of evidence-based information, communication and technology media; capacity-building workshops; on-granting and hosts an international Forum every two years to advance and expand research on sexual and intimate partner violence globally. Through the Development Marketplace platform, the World Bank Group and its partners have awarded more than US$65 million in funding to more than 1,200 innovative social enterprises and raised awareness about the role of social enterprises in addressing challenges facing the poor. 2017 Winners:Sexual Harassment Among Jordanian College Students: Pilot Testing a Promising Primary Prevention Intervention (Jordan, Middle East/ NorthAfrica)Team: Information and Research Center – King Hussein Foundation and Emory UniversityGender Equity Model – Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment and Fighting Gender-Based Violence (Egypt, Middle East/North Africa)Team: The American University of CairoGender-based Violence Prevention in the Amazon of Peru Project (Peru, Latin America)Team: University College London; and, DB PeruBuilding the Evidence Base for ‘Safe Families’ – a Comprehensive Community-led model for Violence Prevention in Solomon Islands.

En esta nueva fase, el Proyecto de Alianzas Rurales II (PAR II) tiene el objetivo de mejorar el ingreso de mayor cantidad&nbsp; de pobladores rurales y aportar así a la reducción de la pobreza en Bolivia. Con el financiamiento adicional el proyecto llegará a cerca de 28.000 nuevos hogares en áreas rurales de todo el país, a través del establecimiento de aproximadamente 768 alianzas productivas. También se apoyarán 48 sub proyectos de infraestructura pública municipal, productiva y de servicios, con más de 21.000 beneficiarios directos o cerca de 5.500 hogares. El PAR II continuará financiando a pequeños productores y su acceso a mercados, pero además, apoyará el fortalecimiento de la resiliencia climática en los sistemas productivos rurales, para lo cual se planea destinar cerca del 75 por ciento de los recursos del financiamiento adicional a inversiones en riego y eficiencia del uso del agua, así como a asistencia técnica en estos ámbitos durante la elaboración y ejecución de los planes de negocio. “Estamos apoyando los esfuerzos del Estado boliviano en resiliencia climática insertando este enfoque renovado al proyecto, que además obedece a la necesidad global de reducir la vulnerabilidad hacia el cambio climático, sobre todo en la actividad agrícola de la cual depende la seguridad alimentaria. Creemos que a futuro no sólo se habrá mejorado la productividad, y por ende, los ingresos de pequeños productores, sino que se habrá fortalecido la capacidad de respuesta de este segmento a los choques climáticos”, señaló Alberto Rodríguez, Director del Banco Mundial para Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Perú y Venezuela. Durante su implementación, que inició en 2006, el PAR ha financiado más de 1.300 alianzas rurales, generando inversiones de alrededor de US$98 millones y beneficiando a cerca de 68.000 personas. La evaluación de impacto del proyecto ha demostrado que es inclusivo y tiene un impacto significativo en la lucha contra la pobreza al mejorar de manera importante el ingreso de los agricultores. “Siguiendo el enfoque de esta iniciativa, se continuará promoviendo que jóvenes y mujeres rurales sean los protagonistas, reconociendo su calidad de actores dinámicos de la agenda del desarrollo en el país”, afirmó Nicola Pontara, Representante del Banco Mundial en Bolivia. El financiamiento adicional del Banco Mundial, por US$100 millones, equivale al 76.6 por ciento del costo total del proyecto, que será complementado con recursos de contraparte de los beneficiarios en 20.8 por ciento (US$27.2 millones) y de los gobiernos municipales en 2.6 por ciento (US$3.4 millones). Los recursos corresponden a un préstamo de Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento (BIRF) con un plazo de vencimiento de 21 años y un periodo de gracia de tres años y medio. — Para conocer el trabajo del Banco Mundial en América Latina y el Caribe visite: www.bancomundial.org/alc Visítenos en Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/bancomundial Manténgase informado via Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/BancoMundialLAC Nuestro canal de YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/BancoMundialLAC &nbsp;\n\nQuase metade dos países pôs em prática políticas anticíclicas: gastos nas épocas ruins e economia de recursos nas épocas boasOs observadores do mercado estimam que, neste ano, o crescimento médio da região voltará a ser positivoAs contas fiscais, no entanto, ficaram deterioradas depois de seis anos de desaceleração econômica WASHINGTON, 18 de abril de 2017 – Em um desdobramento positivo, hoje mais do que nunca, os países da América Latina e Caribe estão implementando políticas fiscais anticíclicas – gastando mais em épocas ruins e economizando nas épocas boas, de acordo com um novo relatório semianual do Banco Mundial sobre a região. O relatório \"Apoiando-se contra o Vento: uma Perspectiva Histórica da Política Fiscal na América Latina e Caribe\" argumenta que essa transformação é importante para uma região que, com frequência, lançou mão de gastos pró-cíclicos – aumentando o risco de superaquecer a economia em períodos de prosperidade e entrar em recessões mais profundas em períodos de baixa atividade econômica. De acordo com o Consensus Forecasts, o Produto Interno Bruto da região deverá crescer 1,5% este ano e 2,5% em 2018, pondo fim a seis anos de desaceleração econômica e à recessão dos últimos dois anos. Se essa previsão se concretizar, as recuperações esperadas no Brasil e na Argentina serão fundamentais para estimular o novo ciclo de crescimento na região. A previsão de crescimento para o México é de, aproximadamente, 1,4%; na América Central e Caribe, a previsão é de uma taxa de crescimento estável em cerca de 3,8%. No entanto, as contas fiscais de vários países sofreram com a desaceleração prolongada. Em 2016, 29 dos 32 países enfrentavam déficits fiscais, em grande parte decorrentes do aumento dos gastos. A média da dívida bruta na região é de 50% do PIB. Ainda assim – em uma importante ruptura com o passado – vários países agora se encontram em melhor posição para escapar dessa complexa situação fiscal, de acordo com o relatório. “Tradicionalmente, os países da América Latina e Caribe agem de forma pró-cíclica, seja por pressões políticas para gastar durante os períodos de prosperidade ou por falta de acesso a capital internacional durante os períodos de desaceleração”, afirma Carlos Végh, Economista-Chefe do Banco Mundial para a América Latina e Caribe. “O resultado é que, muitas vezes, esses países acabam presos na armadilha da pró-ciclicidade fiscal – com o aumento da dívida pública e dos déficits fiscais e rebaixamento da classificação de crédito – e ficam sem opções para reverter a situação.” Em resposta à crise financeira global de 2008, a parcela de países com políticas fiscais anticíclicas na região aumentou de 10 para 45%. Países como Chile, Colômbia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, México, Paraguai e Peru começaram a aumentar os gastos públicos e / ou baixar os impostos em uma tentativa de estimular a economia. Embora essas medidas tenham produzido déficits fiscais, elas fizeram parte de um esforço concertado para minimizar a desaceleração econômica. Por outro lado, afirma o relatório, os países que continuaram com políticas pró-cíclicas agora precisam consolidar ainda mais as suas contas fiscais para minimizar os riscos de rebaixamento da classificação de crédito e de encarecimento dos empréstimos. “Embora os países achem tentadora a ideia de gastar – em vez de poupar – no próximo ciclo de crescimento, os acontecimentos na política fiscal da última década nos trazem a esperança de que os países serão prudentes e optarão pelo caminho seguro,” afirma Végh. “Em um ambiente externo caracterizado por volatilidades e choques frequentes, esse comportamento prudente possibilitará aos países transformar a política fiscal em instrumentos para ajudar a atravessar a próxima crise e preservar os ganhos sociais.” — Para mais informações, por favor, visite: www.worldbank.org/lac Visite a nossa página no Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/bancomundialbrasil Receba atualizações via Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/bancomundialbr Visite o nosso canal no YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/bancomundiallac\n\nWASHINGTON, April 17, 2017 – The World Bank Board of Directors approved US$100 million in additional financing for productive rural partnerships, which will benefit nearly 33,500 households. In this new phase, the Rural Partnerships II Project (PARII) seeks to improve incomes of more rural inhabitants and thus contribute to reducing poverty in Bolivia. With the additional financing, the project will reach nearly 28,000 new households in rural areas throughout the country through the establishment of approximately 768 productive partnerships. The financing will also be used to support 48 sub-projects of municipal, productive and service infrastructure, with more than 21,000 direct beneficiaries, or some 5,500 households. The PAR II will continue to finance small-scale farmers and their access to markets. Additionally, it will support the strengthening of climate change resilience in rural production systems. To this end, about 75 percent of the additional resources will be invested in irrigation and efficient water usage, as well as in technical assistance in these areas during the preparation and implementation of business plans. \"We are supporting the climate-resilience efforts of the Bolivian government by incorporating this new approach in the project, which also responds to the global need to reduce vulnerability to climate change, especially in agriculture, on which food security depends. We believe that in the future, productivity will have improved, and consequently, the incomes of small-scale producers. Additionally, the capacity of this segment to respond to climate shocks will have been strengthened,” said Alberto Rodríguez, World Bank director for Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. During implementation of the PAR Project, which began in 2006, more than 1,300 rural partnerships were financed, generating investments of some US$98 million and benefitting nearly 68,000 people. The project impact evaluation demonstrated that it is inclusive and that it has considerable impact on poverty reduction because it significantly increases farmers’ incomes. “In keeping with the approach of this initiative, the project will continue to encourage rural youth and women to play a leading role, acknowledging their value as dynamic actors in the country’s development agenda,” said Nicola Pontara, World Bank representative in Bolivia. The US$ 100 million in additional World Bank financing covers 76.6 percent of the total cost of the project. Counterpart resources will cover the remainder: Beneficiaries will contribute 20.8 percent (US$27.2 million) while municipal governments will provide 2.6 percent (US$3.4 million). This financing is a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with a maturity date of 21 years and a grace period of 3.5 years. — Learn more about the work of the World Bank in Latin America and the Caribbean: www.worldbank.org/lac&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/worldbank Be updated via Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/BancoMundialLAC &nbsp; For our YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/BancoMundialLAC &nbsp;\n\nNearly half of the countries followed counter-cyclical policies: spending in bad times and saving in good timesMarket watchers expect that the region’s average growth will turn positive this yearYet fiscal accounts have deteriorated after six years of economic slowdown WASHINGTON, April 18, 2017 – In a positive development, today more than ever before, Latin American and Caribbean countries are pursuing counter-cyclical fiscal policies – spending more in bad times and saving in good times, according to a new World Bank semiannual report for the region. \"Leaning against the Wind: Fiscal Policy in Latin America and the Caribbean in a Historical Perspective\" argues that the transformation is significant for a region that has often pursued pro-cyclical spending – increasing the risks of overheating economies during boom times and making recessions deeper during the bad times. According to the Consensus Forecasts, Gross Domestic Product in the region is expected to grow by 1.5 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2018, putting an end to six years of an economic downturn, including recession over the past two years. If they materialize, recoveries expected in Brazil and Argentina will largely fuel the return to growth in the region. Mexico’s growth is expected to hover at around 1.4 percent, while Central America and the Caribbean will maintain steady growth of around 3.8 percent. However, the fiscal accounts of many countries have suffered due to the prolonged slowdown. As of 2016, 29 out of 32 countries were facing fiscal deficits, largely due to higher spending. The median gross debt for the region stands at 50 percent of GDP. Still – in a significant break with the past – many countries now find themselves in a better position to escape this difficult fiscal predicament, according to the report. “Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have traditionally been pro-cyclical, either because of political pressures to spend during good times or lack of access to international capital during bad times,” said Carlos Végh, World Bank Chief Economist for Latin America and the Caribbean. “As a result, they often found themselves caught in a fiscal procyclicality trap, leading to higher public debt and fiscal deficits as well as lower credit ratings that left them few options to turn things around.” In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, the number of countries with a countercyclical fiscal policy increased from 10 to 45 percent of the region’s economies. Countries such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru begun to increase public spending and/or lower taxes in an attempt to stimulate the economy. While such measures produced fiscal deficits, they were the result of a concerted effort to minimize the downturn. On the other hand, countries that continued with pro-cyclical policies must now further consolidate their fiscal accounts to minimize the risks of a deterioration in their credit ratings and an increase in borrowing costs, the report argues. “While countries may still find it tempting to spend rather than save in the next boom cycle, the events of the last decade in fiscal policy give us hope that countries will play it safe instead and be prudent,” said Végh. “In an external environment characterized by frequent shocks and volatility, such prudence will allow them to turn fiscal policy into instruments to help cope with the next downturn and preserve social gains.” — For more information, please visit: www.worldbank.org/lac Visit us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/worldbank Be updated via Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/BancoMundialLAC For our YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/worldbank\n\nWASHINGTON, April 18, 2017—The World Bank Group and&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;Violence Research Initiative&nbsp;(SVRI)&nbsp;today awarded competitive funds totaling US$1.14 million to 10 teams from around the world for innovations to prevent and respond to gender-based violence&nbsp;(GBV).

The project “Partnership for Quality Education” is aligned with the 2013-2017 Country Partnership Strategy in its objective to strengthen the skills and comprehensive development of Nicaraguans by improving the quality of preschool and basic education. The project also works toward the objectives of the 2017-2021 Education Sector Strategy. “The Government of Nicaragua is solidly committed to a quality education that includes strengthening the teaching skills of our preschool, primary and secondary teachers, as well as improving the learning environments of our students, who will have safer schools that are less vulnerable to natural disasters. This will help advance the idea of education as a right and education paths led by the education community,” said Miriam Ráudez, Minister of Education of Nicaragua. With a view to strengthening teaching practices, this project will offer continuing education courses and mentoring to some 52,000 practicing teachers. Teacher training will include a gender-based approach, as well as one to develop students’ socioemotional skills. Learning and child development assessments will reinforce these activities. Additionally, students and teachers will receive educational materials to guarantee the availability of classroom learning materials. To contribute to the overall improvement of learning environments, the project includes activities to develop quality infrastructure. It will directly benefit some 50,000 students by remodeling and enlarging schools. Moreover, new construction standards and protocol will be developed for schools nationwide, including the highest standards to reduce infrastructure vulnerability to flooding, hurricanes and earthquakes. &nbsp;“This project focuses on strengthening educational quality in Nicaragua, as a key pillar for sustaining the visible progress observed in recent years,” said Luis Constantino, World Bank Representative in Nicaragua. “The project will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal Nº 4 by strengthening preschool education and increasing access to a quality basic education. Moreover, promoting resilience to climate and geophysical threats is pivotal for sustainable development,” he added. The US$55 million loan from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest, has a 20-year maturity date, including a five-year grace period. The project will be implemented for five years.
