        "meta_description": "This article argues that the re-presentation of space and place for global and local audiences constructs a touristic cultural imaginary. It highlights how – through the feature film Pas son genre/ Not my type (Lucas Belvaux, 2014) – the audience’s gaze is centred on two cinematic spaces: the historical architecture of city centres and their local and cultural traditions and the ‘icons’ of global tourism, such as beaches. The article highlights how Urry’s foundational concept of the “the tourist’s gaze” is articulated through the movements of the characters, who organise the inter-relationships between cities, towns, and events. The analysis shows that it is precisely this romantic relationship between the characters and how they experience the region of Pas-de-Calais, i.e. one as a local, and one as a visitor from Paris, that organises the snippets of the region and how they are experienced and interpreted by the spectator. The locations of Paris and, more importantly, Arras (and the region of Pas-de-Calais) offer layers of textual meaning that show the act of falling in love as aligned with the beach and the experience of the city, and a nostalgic yearning for tradition and customs present in small town contexts. The recognisable codes and icons of the Pas-de-Calais region are viewed by spectators through the lens of the characters and their immediate experiences that nuance the cinematic spaces.",

        "text": "I would like to thank La Cinémathèque Française and BIFI (Bibliothèque du Film) for their help and support in accessing already published film reviews, newspaper articles, and press clippings on Lucas Belvaux’s Pas son genre (2014). Thanks also go to the National Library of Scotland for access to some articles, book chapters, and further research on film tourism that helped with the research for this article. The anonymous peer reviewers also provided extremely helpful suggestions along the way.\n\nScreen Tourism: Places in French Cinema\n\n6The depiction of Arras in Belvaux’s Pas son genre is one that is not tempted to draw attention to the ‘beauty’ or uniqueness of the city in comparison to TV programmes, such as the series ‘Favourite French Monument’ on France 2, which have sought to change the image of the city to a status of destination. The diegetic place created within Pas son genre is filtered through a nuancing of stigmatising perceptions of the city and the region, for example Clément’s initial response to the city and his pre-conceptions of Arras and Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and the narrative of falling in love.\n\nDirecting the “Touristic Gaze”: Clément as guide and traveller\n\nPas-de-Calais’ Beaches: The Temporal Experience of Tourism\n\n13The contrast between the historical architecture of the city of Arras and town of Cassel and the space of the beach is particularly instructive, since it highlights the transitory nature of the tourist’s experience in the region. It ticks the semantic boxes of the tourist’s everyday experience, i.e. seeing and gazing at local traditions, histories, events and architecture, with the less fixed space of the beach, marked by a lifting of temporality. It is a shifting space of romantic interpretations of a loving and emerging relationship. Its lack of fixity is coherent with the global cultures of travelling, where ‘exotic’ places are marked by their non-descript beaches, laden with golden sand and clear seas. In essence, the scenes participate in the tourist’s interpretation of the experience of romance and holidaying, presenting an image of the region that is fluid and where one can escape the constraints of temporality that exist within the neo-liberal and capitalist system of work, coded by time.\n\n14In the first sequence on the beach, Clément and Jennifer are sitting, wearing their winter coats and scarves to fight against the strong breeze along the coastline, as the camera pans from right-to-left, on the left side of the two characters. The sequence opens with the coastline, with the twentieth century post-WWII buildings lining the seafront, before being placed alongside the two characters as they gaze out to sea. The slow movement of the camera constantly re-frames the characters in dialogue, once again, turning back towards the coastline. Discussing this sequence, Belvaux argues that,\n\n65 ‘La scène sur la plage commence par un long travelling où ils ne se disent rien et puis, la discuss (...)\n\n[t]he scene on the beach begins with a long traveling shot where they do not say anything to each other and then, both of them get involved in a discussion at that moment in space and time. It is important to film them where they are, and convey the passing of time visually.\n\n67 Locations France Film. “Presentation Sheet Berck-sur-Mer”, Francefilm.net.\n\nDespite the destruction of the waterfront during the war, Berck offers a variety of houses of the nineteenth and early twentieth exceptional by the diversity of styles and a large beach, a wide variety of activities and places of recreation, hotels and restaurants that attract touristes [sic].\n\nCarnivals as “Vernacular Icons”\n\n78 Agat Films & Cie and Aretmis Productions. “Not My Type Dossier de Presse”, Unifrance.org, 2013:8.\n\n[c]oming from Belgium, I feel at home there [Arras]. The carnivals, the brass bands, the beer, the fries, the friendliness, these are cultural codes I’m familiar with. Clément doesn’t come from this area. He thinks it is a punishment to live in this city, far from the world, from his world, although it is only an hour and a half from Paris.\n\n20As a result, the carnival provides the film with a clear location in the French North. The event captures the specificity of the French Flanders region and of its spirit and atmosphere as different to the metropolitan centre in Paris."
