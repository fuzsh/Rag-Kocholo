        "text": "Wong Kar Wai will be the man to watch when the Cannes Film Festival opens this week. If you're looking for elegance, style and cool on the French Riviera, the Hong Kong director is the best bet. He may even take his mirror shades off.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have a film to show this year, he is president of the jury and has assembled a panel boasting a cast any film would envy: Monica Bellucci, Helena Bonham Carter and Zhang Ziyi are his leading ladies; Samuel L Jackson and Tim Roth his leading men; his assistant directors are Lucrecia Martel (the Argentinian woman behind Cannes successes La Niña Santa and La Ciénaga), Palestine's Elia Suleiman and Patrice Leconte (the French stylist behind such varied works as Ridicule, Monsieur Hire and L'homme du train.\n\nIndeed, the jury will be starrier than most of the film casts heading up the steps. Usually, the jury consists of one or two well-known figures, a couple of world cinema directors and two or three writers, intellectuals and maybe a wild card (last year Toni Morrison, a few years back French rapper MC Solaar) but never has there been such wattage as this year.\n\nWong's team have unusually strong Cannes links, too: Bellucci is married to French star Vincent Cassel, who is hosting the opening ceremony; Zhang made her European splash here in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Jackson and Roth boast the Tarantino connection, Quentin having been Jury president two years ago and Pulp Fiction, in which they both starred, having won the Palme d'Or in 1994.\n\nLet's hope such glamour-heavy jurors do not divert focus from the talent they are judging. The jury remain (or are supposed to remain) tight-lipped throughout the competition's 10 days but they're always around, either climbing the famous red-carpeted steps, dining on the Carlton Beach, partying in VIP rooms, or lurking at the back of press screenings.\n\nAt this 59th edition of the festival, the jury have 20 films from 13 countries to consider. As usual, it's impossible to tell what themes will emerge or what trends will be uncovered, but the line-up has a tantalising mix of old faces, new talents and varied subjects.\n\nGlitziest entry is perhaps Sofia Coppola's Marie-Antoinette, sure to bring with it a retinue even more glamorous than the one retained by the queen herself: Kirsten Dunst, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Marianne Faithfull, Danny Huston are stars attending. Advance rumours suggest it retells French history in a manner that may mint a new genre - the ba-rock opera.\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu's new film Babel is the one I'm looking forward to most. The director of Amores Perros and 21 Grams returns with another fractured narrative (he calls his approach 'cubist') set in Morocco, Mexico and Japan, beginning with a tragedy striking a holidaying couple. It's written with his usual collaborator Guillermo Arriaga- who helped Tommy Lee Jones to glory here last year by writing Three Burials. Cate Blanchett, Brad Pitt and Gael García Bernal are the stars, and who knows what pandemonium may ensue should 'Brangelina' make a red carpet appearance.\n\nAt 30 years old, Richard Kelly, who directed Donnie Darko, is the youngest competitor in this auteur's World Cup, with perhaps the riskiest entry: Southland Tales, an offbeat, musical/sci-fi vision of America in the near-future, in which Sarah Michelle Gellar is a porn star, wrestler-turned-actor The Rock is married to Mandy Moore and Justin Timberlake is a pilot. The music has been composed by Moby.\n\nOld favourites include: that infuriating Finn, Aki Kaurismäki, with Lights in the Dusk; Italy's Nanni Moretti, with his Berlusconi-baiting The Caiman; our own Ken Loach with The Wind that Shakes the Barley (hot insider tip: Cillian Murphy for Best Actor); and Pedro Almodóvar, back with Volver, starring Penélope Cruz, Carmen Maura and Lola Dueñas.\n\nThe French will be hoping for a first home win since, incredibly, Maurice Pialat's Sous le soleil de Satan in 1987 (last year's winners the Dardenne brothers are Belgian, so don't count). Their regular clutch of entries includes: Bruno Dumont's Flandres, Nicole Garcia's Selon Charlie and Lucas Belvaux, creator of the extraordinary Trilogy, with a film called La raison du plus faible in which he also stars.\n\nAt this stage, it is difficult to seek thematic trends but it does look as though, in a reflection of our turbulent times, civil and religious wars mixed with ensuing social upheaval will be at the forefront - Loach (Irish independence), Rachid Bouchareb (Days of Glory depicts Algerian soldiers in French army), Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth set during Spanish Civil War), Lou Ye (Summer Palace is a romance set against a backdrop of Tiananmen Square).\n\nOne contender for whom Cannes is certain to be a star-making occasion is indie director Richard Linklater, who has two films based on books in the Official Selection. Fast Food Nation is in the main competition, produced by Jeremy Thomas from Eric Schlosser's book and starring Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke among many others, examining whether we are what we eat. A Scanner Darkly, a part-animated, more experimental piece is in the Un Certain Regard sidebar, starring Keanu Reeves and based on Philip K Dick's drug experiences.\n\nWho will win? It's up to the jury, and what may meet with Wong Kar Wai's particular taste. Lou Ye is Asia's only entry and if his last film, Suzhou River is any indicator, could chime with Wong's preferences. Dartford's Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has already achieved plenty, getting her first feature, Red Road, into the fray.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anything being better than Paul Greengrass's United 93, but this superb film from a world class British director is, disappointingly, showing Out of Competition - presumably because it was felt awarding a prize to a film about so many people dying, people whose families are still grieving, might be seen as distasteful.\n\nPersonally, I can't see a more fitting tribute, both to the victims and to the marvellous, thrilling, scary, shocking, moving work the director has done on the topic of our times. But if you're asking me to take a punt, then I'm going for the combination of Iñárritu, Arriaga and Pitt, a mix of thrills, philosophy and glamour, three key ingredients to a great Cannes.\n\nRough Guide to Cannes\n\nThe awards\n\nCannes selectors see over 3,000 films and pick 55 for the Official Selection, which includes four different sections - the Competition, Un Certain Regard, Critics' Week and Directors' Fortnight. The Palme d'Or is given to the best film in the Competition; the Grand Prix is the runner-up prize. The Prix du Jury is for brave attempts that didn't quite work. Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress are also awarded to Competition films. The sidebar Un Certain Regard is for quirky, experimental films, or new cinema, or bad films from established directors the selectors don't want to offend. Critics' Week and Directors' Fortnight are cool and the place to find hidden gems, but don't expect any big money makers here - it's experimental, controversial, sexual, political, boundary and taboo-breaking. Sometimes, there's just real rubbish (like Ethan Hawke's Chelsea Walls). Lastly Out of Competition screenings - which fall outside the four main sections - are political, for doing favours to studios (X-Men 3, anyone?) or for precious directors who hate the idea of competing (i.e. losing).\n\nThe dress code\n\nTrainers. You do a lot of walking in Cannes. Running, to be precise. You're always late, for a screening, for an interview, for a meeting, for lunch, for coffee or for a bus to take you to a party. Girls do wear high heels sometimes - you see them crying on the pavement of the Rue d'Antibes at about three in the morning.\n\nThe accommodation\n\nSteal a floor, cadge a bed, rent an apartment, slum it in a two-star and share a shower with a journalist from Norway. Nobody's in a good hotel in Cannes unless: they're on the Jury, in a film (in which case they get three days' accommodation then they're kicked out) or they're American (only studios can afford to put staff in the Carlton or the Martinez). Real celebs and properly rich people stay at the Hôtel du Cap, down the coast at Antibes.\n\nThe parties"
