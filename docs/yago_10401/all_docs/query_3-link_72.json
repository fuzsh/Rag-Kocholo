        "text": "The DVD format is made for playing innovation. The last successful example was Mike Figgis's multiple-point-of-view Timecode. Lucas Belvaux's trio of films, individually called One, Two and Three, is less radical.\n\nThere's nothing unique about this trilogy, a thriller, a comedy and a melodrama. Individually, none would stand out, although they're competent, well-acted and show an impressive range.\n\nBut Belvaux's trio of films becomes gripping as you keep watching. Characters with a bit part in one film become central characters in another and peripheral scenes in one film take on a whole new resonance in the next. It's all skilfully interwoven by the director, who also plays the escaped convict in One, as motives and explanations become clearer from one film to the next. It's an unpretentious reminder that we're all bit-part players in each other's life dramas. A fourth disc casts light on the making of Trilogy, which can be viewed in any order."
