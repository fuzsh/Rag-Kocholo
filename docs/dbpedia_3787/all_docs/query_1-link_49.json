        "text": "As a writer for the marketing blog, I frequently use various types of charts and graphs to help readers visualize the data I collect and better understand their significance. And trust me, there's a lot of data to present.\n\nIn fact, the volume of data in 2025 will be almost double the data we create, capture, copy, and consume today.\n\nThis makes data visualization essential for businesses. Different types of graphs and charts can help you:\n\nMotivate your team to take action.\n\nImpress stakeholders with goal progress.\n\nShow your audience what you value as a business.\n\nData visualization builds trust and can organize diverse teams around new initiatives. So, I'm going to talk about the types of graphs and charts that you can use to grow your business.\n\nAnd, if you still need a little more guidance by the end of this post, check out our data visualization guide for more information on how to design visually stunning and engaging charts and graphs.\n\nCharts vs Graphs: What's the Difference?\n\nA lot of people think charts and graphs are synonymous (I know I did), but they're actually two different things.\n\nCharts visually represent current data in the form of tables and diagrams, but graphs are more numerical in data and show how one variable affects another.\n\nFor example, in one of my favorite sitcoms, How I Met Your Mother, Marshall creates a bunch of charts and graphs representing his life. One of these charts is a Venn diagram referencing the song \"Cecilia\" by Simon and Garfunkle.\n\nMarshall says, \"This circle represents people who are breaking my heart, and this circle represents people who are shaking my confidence daily. Where they overlap? Cecilia.\"\n\nThe diagram is a chart and not a graph because it doesn't track how these people make him feel over time or how these variables are influenced by each other.\n\nIt may show where the two types of people intersect but not how they influence one another.\n\nImage source\n\nLater, Marshall makes a line graph showing how his friends' feelings about his charts have changed in the time since presenting his \"Cecilia diagram.\n\nNote: He calls the line graph a chart on the show, but it's acceptable because the nature of line graphs and charts makes the terms interchangeable. I'll explain later, I promise.\n\nThe line graph shows how the time since showing his Cecilia chart has influenced his friends' tolerance for his various graphs and charts.\n\nImage source\n\nI can't even begin to tell you all how happy I am to reference my favorite HIMYM joke in this post.\n\nNow, let's dive into the various types of graphs and charts.\n\nDifferent Types of Graphs for Data Visualization\n\n1. Bar Graph\n\nI strongly suggest using a bar graph to avoid clutter when one data label is long or if you have more than 10 items to compare. Also, fun fact: If the example below was vertical it would be a column graph.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Graphs\n\nBar graphs can help track changes over time. I've found that bar graphs are most useful when there are big changes or to show how one group compares against other groups.\n\nThe example above compares the number of customers by business role. It makes it easy to see that there is more than twice the number of customers per role for individual contributors than any other group.\n\nA bar graph also makes it easy to see which group of data is highest or most common.\n\nFor example, at the start of the pandemic, online businesses saw a big jump in traffic. So, if you want to look at monthly traffic for an online business, a bar graph would make it easy to see that jump.\n\nOther use cases for bar graphs include:\n\nProduct comparisons.\n\nProduct usage.\n\nCategory comparisons.\n\nMarketing traffic by month or year.\n\nMarketing conversions.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Bar Graphs\n\nUse consistent colors throughout the chart, selecting accent colors to highlight meaningful data points or changes over time.\n\nYou should also use horizontal labels to improve its readability, and start the y-axis at 0 to appropriately reflect the values in your graph.\n\n2. Line Graph\n\nA line graph reveals trends or progress over time, and you can use it to show many different categories of data. You should use it when you track a continuous data set.\n\nThis makes the terms line graphs and line charts interchangeable because the very nature of both is to track how variables impact each other, particularly how something changes over time. Yeah, it confused me, too.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Graphs\n\nLine graphs help users track changes over short and long periods. Because of this, I find these types of graphs are best for seeing small changes.\n\nLine graphs help me compare changes for more than one group over the same period. They're also helpful for measuring how different groups relate to each other.\n\nA business might use this graph to compare sales rates for different products or services over time.\n\nThese charts are also helpful for measuring service channel performance. For example, a line graph that tracks how many chats or emails your team responds to per month.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Line Graphs\n\nUse solid lines only.\n\nDon't plot more than four lines to avoid visual distractions.\n\nUse the right height so the lines take up roughly 2/3 of the y-axis' height.\n\n3. Bullet Graph\n\nA bullet graph reveals progress towards a goal, compares this to another measure, and provides context in the form of a rating or performance.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Graphs\n\nIn the example above, the bullet graph shows the number of new customers against a set customer goal. Bullet graphs are great for comparing performance against goals like this.\n\nThese types of graphs can also help teams assess possible roadblocks because you can analyze data in a tight visual display.\n\nFor example, I could create a series of bullet graphs measuring performance against benchmarks or use a single bullet graph to visualize these KPIs against their goals:\n\nRevenue.\n\nProfit.\n\nCustomer satisfaction.\n\nAverage order size.\n\nNew customers.\n\nSeeing this data at a glance and alongside each other can help teams make quick decisions.\n\nBullet graphs are one of the best ways to display year-over-year data analysis. YBullet graphs can also visualize:\n\nCustomer satisfaction scores.\n\nProduct usage.\n\nCustomer shopping habits.\n\nSocial media usage by platform.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Bullet Graphs\n\nUse contrasting colors to highlight how the data is progressing.\n\nUse one color in different shades to gauge progress.\n\n4. Column + Line Graph\n\nColumn + line graphs are also called dual-axis charts. They consist of a column and line graph together, with both graphics on the X axis but occupying their own Y axis.\n\nDownload our FREE Excel Graph Templates for this graph and more!\n\nBest Use Cases\n\nThese graphs are best for comparing two data sets with different measurement units, such as rate and time.\n\nAs a marketer, you may want to track two trends at once.\n\nDesign Best Practices\n\nUse individual colors for the lines and colors to make the graph more visually appealing and to further differentiate the data.\n\nThe Four Basic Types of Charts\n\nBefore we get into charts, I want to touch on the four basic chart types that I use the most.\n\n1. Bar Chart\n\nBar charts are pretty self-explanatory. I use them to indicate values by the length of bars, which can be displayed horizontally or vertically. Vertical bar charts, like the one below, are sometimes called column charts.\n\nImage source\n\n2. Line Chart\n\nI use line charts to show changes in values across continuous measurements, such as across time, generations, or categories. For example, the chart below shows the changes in ice cream sales throughout the week.\n\nImage source\n\n3. Scatter Plot\n\nA scatter plot uses dotted points to compare values against two different variables on separate axes. It's commonly used to show correlations between values and variables.\n\n4. Pie Chart\n\nPie charts are charts that represent data in a circular (pie-shaped) graphic, and each slice represents a percentage or portion of the whole.\n\nNotice the example below of a household budget. (Which reminds me that I need to set up my own.)\n\nNotice that the percentage of income going to each expense is represented by a slice.\n\nDifferent Types of Charts for Data Visualization\n\nTo better understand chart types and how you can use them, here's an overview of each:\n\n1. Column Chart\n\nUse a column chart to show a comparison among different items or to show a comparison of items over time. You could use this format to see the revenue per landing page or customers by close date.\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nI use both column charts to display changes in data, but I've noticed column charts are best for negative data. The main difference, of course, is that column charts show information vertically while bar charts show data horizontally.\n\nFor example, warehouses often track the number of accidents on the shop floor. When the number of incidents falls below the monthly average, a column chart can make that change easier to see in a presentation.\n\nIn the example above, this column chart measures the number of customers by close date. Column charts make it easy to see data changes over a period of time. This means that they have many use cases, including:\n\nCustomer survey data, like showing how many customers prefer a specific product or how much a customer uses a product each day.\n\nSales volume, like showing which services are the top sellers each month or the number of sales per week.\n\nProfit and loss, showing where business investments are growing or falling.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Column Charts\n\nUse consistent colors throughout the chart, selecting accent colors to highlight meaningful data points or changes over time.\n\nUse horizontal labels to improve readability.\n\nStart the y-axis at 0 to appropriately reflect the values in your chart.\n\n2. Area Chart\n\nOkay, an area chart is basically a line chart, but I swear there's a meaningful difference.\n\nThe space between the x-axis and the line is filled with a color or pattern. It is useful for showing part-to-whole relations, like showing individual sales reps’ contributions to total sales for a year.\n\nIt helps me analyze both overall and individual trend information.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Charts\n\nArea charts help show changes over time. They work best for big differences between data sets and help visualize big trends.\n\nFor example, the chart above shows users by creation date and life cycle stage.\n\nA line chart could show more subscribers than marketing qualified leads. But this area chart emphasizes how much bigger the number of subscribers is than any other group.\n\nThese charts make the size of a group and how groups relate to each other more visually important than data changes over time.\n\nArea charts can help your business to:\n\nVisualize which product categories or products within a category are most popular.\n\nShow key performance indicator (KPI) goals vs. outcomes.\n\nSpot and analyze industry trends.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Area Charts\n\nUse transparent colors so information isn't obscured in the background.\n\nDon't display more than four categories to avoid clutter.\n\nOrganize highly variable data at the top of the chart to make it easy to read.\n\n3. Stacked Bar Chart\n\nI suggest using this chart to compare many different items and show the composition of each item you’re comparing.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Charts\n\nThese charts are helpful when a group starts in one column and moves to another over time.\n\nFor example, the difference between a marketing qualified lead (MQL) and a sales qualified lead (SQL) is sometimes hard to see. The chart above helps stakeholders see these two lead types from a single point of view — when a lead changes from MQL to SQL.\n\nStacked bar charts are excellent for marketing. They make it simple to add a lot of data on a single chart or to make a point with limited space.\n\nThese charts can show multiple takeaways, so they're also super for quarterly meetings when you have a lot to say but not a lot of time to say it.\n\nStacked bar charts are also a smart option for planning or strategy meetings. This is because these charts can show a lot of information at once, but they also make it easy to focus on one stack at a time or move data as needed.\n\nYou can also use these charts to:\n\nShow the frequency of survey responses.\n\nIdentify outliers in historical data.\n\nCompare a part of a strategy to its performance as a whole.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Stacked Bar Charts\n\nBest used to illustrate part-to-whole relationships.\n\nUse contrasting colors for greater clarity.\n\nMake the chart scale large enough to view group sizes in relation to one another.\n\n4. Mekko Chart\n\nAlso known as a Marimekko chart, this type of chart can compare values, measure each one's composition, and show data distribution across each one.\n\nIt's similar to a stacked bar, except the Mekko's x-axis can capture another dimension of your values — instead of time progression, like column charts often do. In the graphic below, the x-axis compares the cities to one another.\n\nImage Source\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nI typically use a Mekko chart to show growth, market share, or competitor analysis.\n\nFor example, the Mekko chart above shows the market share of asset managers grouped by location and the value of their assets. This chart clarifies which firms manage the most assets in different areas.\n\nIt's also easy to see which asset managers are the largest and how they relate to each other.\n\nMekko charts can seem more complex than other types of charts, so it's best to use these in situations where you want to emphasize scale or differences between groups of data.\n\nOther use cases for Mekko charts include:\n\nDetailed profit and loss statements.\n\nRevenue by brand and region.\n\nProduct profitability.\n\nShare of voice by industry or niche.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Mekko Charts\n\nVary your bar heights if the portion size is an important point of comparison.\n\nDon't include too many composite values within each bar. Consider reevaluating your presentation if you have a lot of data.\n\nOrder your bars from left to right in such a way that exposes a relevant trend or message.\n\n5. Pie Chart\n\nRemember, a pie chart represents numbers in percentages, and the total sum of all segments needs to equal 100%.\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nThe image above shows another example of customers by role in the company.\n\nThe bar chart example shows you that there are more individual contributors than any other role. But this pie chart makes it clear that they make up over 50% of customer roles.\n\nPie charts make it easy to see a section in relation to the whole, so they are good for showing:\n\nCustomer personas in relation to all customers.\n\nRevenue from your most popular products or product types in relation to all product sales.\n\nPercent of total profit from different store locations.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Pie Charts\n\nDon't illustrate too many categories to ensure differentiation between slices.\n\nEnsure that the slice values add up to 100%.\n\nOrder slices according to their size.\n\n6. Scatter Plot Chart\n\nAs I said earlier, a scatter plot or scattergram chart will show the relationship between two different variables or reveal distribution trends.\n\nUse this chart when there are many different data points, and you want to highlight similarities in the data set. This is useful when looking for outliers or understanding your data's distribution.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Charts\n\nScatter plots are helpful in situations where you have too much data to see a pattern quickly. They are best when you use them to show relationships between two large data sets.\n\nIn the example above, this chart shows how customer happiness relates to the time it takes for them to get a response.\n\nThis type of chart makes it easy to compare two data sets. Use cases might include:\n\nEmployment and manufacturing output.\n\nRetail sales and inflation.\n\nVisitor numbers and outdoor temperature.\n\nSales growth and tax laws.\n\nTry to choose two data sets that already have a positive or negative relationship. That said, this type of chart can also make it easier to see data that falls outside of normal patterns.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Scatter Plots\n\nInclude more variables, like different sizes, to incorporate more data.\n\nStart the y-axis at 0 to represent data accurately.\n\nIf you use trend lines, only use a maximum of two to make your plot easy to understand.\n\n7. Bubble Chart\n\nA bubble chart is similar to a scatter plot in that it can show distribution or relationship. There is a third data set shown by the size of the bubble or circle.\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nIn the example above, the number of hours spent online isn't just compared to the user's age, as it would be on a scatter plot chart.\n\nInstead, you can also see how the gender of the user impacts time spent online.\n\nThis makes bubble charts useful for seeing the rise or fall of trends over time. It also lets you add another option when you're trying to understand relationships between different segments or categories.\n\nFor example, if you want to launch a new product, this chart could help you quickly see your new product's cost, risk, and value. This can help you focus your energies on a low-risk new product with a high potential return.\n\nYou can also use bubble charts for:\n\nTop sales by month and location.\n\nCustomer satisfaction surveys.\n\nStore performance tracking.\n\nMarketing campaign reviews.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Bubble Charts\n\nScale bubbles according to area, not diameter.\n\nMake sure labels are clear and visible.\n\nUse circular shapes only.\n\n8. Waterfall Chart\n\nI sometimes use a waterfall chart to show how an initial value changes with intermediate values — either positive or negative — and results in a final value.\n\nUse this chart to reveal the composition of a number. An example of this would be to showcase how different departments influence overall company revenue and lead to a specific profit number.\n\nImage Source\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nThese types of charts make it easier to understand how internal and external factors impact a product or campaign as a whole.\n\nIn the example above, the chart moves from the starting balance on the far left to the ending balance on the far right. Factors in the center include deposits, transfers in and out, and bank fees.\n\nA waterfall chart offers a quick visual, making complex processes and outcomes easier to see and troubleshoot. For example, SaaS companies often measure customer churn. This format can help visualize changes in new, current, and free trial users or changes by user segment.\n\nYou may also want to try a waterfall chart to show:\n\nChanges in revenue or profit over time.\n\nInventory audits.\n\nEmployee staffing reviews.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Waterfall Charts\n\nUse contrasting colors to highlight differences in data sets.\n\nChoose warm colors to indicate increases and cool colors to indicate decreases.\n\n9. Funnel Chart\n\nA funnel chart shows a series of steps and the completion rate for each step. Use this type of chart to track the sales process or the conversion rate across a series of pages or steps.\n\nBest Use Cases for These Types of Charts\n\nThe most common use case for a funnel chart is the marketing or sales funnel. But there are many other ways to use this versatile chart.\n\nIf you have at least four stages of sequential data, this chart can help you easily see what inputs or outputs impact the final results.\n\nFor example, a funnel chart can help you see how to improve your buyer journey or shopping cart workflow. This is because it can help pinpoint major drop-off points.\n\nOther stellar options for these types of charts include:\n\nDeal pipelines.\n\nConversion and retention analysis.\n\nBottlenecks in manufacturing and other multi-step processes.\n\nMarketing campaign performance.\n\nWebsite conversion tracking.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Funnel Charts\n\nScale the size of each section to accurately reflect the size of the data set.\n\nUse contrasting colors or one color in graduated hues, from darkest to lightest, as the size of the funnel decreases.\n\n10. Heat Map\n\nA heat map shows the relationship between two items and provides rating information, such as high to low or poor to excellent. This chart displays the rating information using varying colors or saturation.\n\nBest Use Cases for Heat Maps\n\nIn the example above, the darker the shade of green shows where the majority of people agree.\n\nWith enough data, heat maps can make a viewpoint that might seem subjective more concrete. This makes it easier for a business to act on customer sentiment.\n\nThere are many uses for these types of charts. In fact, many tech companies use heat map tools to gauge user experience for apps, online tools, and website design.\n\nAnother common use for heat map charts is location assessment. If you're trying to find the right location for your new store, these maps can give you an idea of what the area is like in ways that a visit can't communicate.\n\nHeat maps can also help with spotting patterns, so they're good for analyzing trends that change quickly, like ad conversions. They can also help with:\n\nCompetitor research.\n\nCustomer sentiment.\n\nSales outreach.\n\nCampaign impact.\n\nCustomer demographics.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Heat Map\n\nUse a basic and clear map outline to avoid distracting from the data.\n\nUse a single color in varying shades to show changes in data.\n\nAvoid using multiple patterns.\n\n11. Gantt Chart\n\nThe Gantt chart is a horizontal chart that dates back to 1917. This chart maps the different tasks completed over a period of time.\n\nGantt charting is one of the most essential tools for project managers. It brings all the completed and uncompleted tasks into one place and tracks the progress of each.\n\nWhile the left side of the chart displays all the tasks, the right side shows the progress and schedule for each of these tasks.\n\nThis chart type allows you to:\n\nBreak projects into tasks.\n\nTrack the start and end of the tasks.\n\nSet important events, meetings, and announcements.\n\nAssign tasks to the team and individuals.\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nGantt charts are perfect for analyzing, road mapping, and monitoring progress over a period of time.\n\nThe chart above divides the different tasks involved in product creation. Each of these tasks has a timeline that can be mapped on the calendar view.\n\nFrom the vision and strategy to the seed funding round, the Gantt chart helps project management teams build long-term strategies.\n\nThe best part? You can bring the stakeholders, project team, and managers to a single place.\n\nYou can use Gantt charts in various tasks, including:\n\nTracking employee records as a human resource.\n\nTracking sales leads in a sales process.\n\nPlan and track construction work.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Gantt Charts\n\nUse same colors for a similar group of activities.\n\nMake sure to label the task dependencies to map project start and completion.\n\nUse light colors that align with the texts and grids of the chart.\n\n12. Treemap\n\nA treemap is a chart that represents hierarchical data in a tree-like diagram. As evident from the name, treemaps have data organized as branches and sub-branches.\n\nThe data in the chart is nested in the form of rectangles and sub-rectangles. Each of these rectangles and sub-rectangles has different dimensions and plot colors which are assigned w.r.t to the quantitative data.\n\nImage Source\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nThe treemap chart compares the different products in a category or sub-category. In the diagram above, the products are divided by revenue.\n\nLook at the four parent categories: Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, and Meat. This is followed by subsequent sub-categories or sub-products. The dimensions of these rectangles are in proportion to their numerical quantity and other rectangles in the same category.\n\nThe colors of these rectangles are plotted as per the revenue generated. Treemap charts are effective in differentiating between the products that lie in the same group but are divided into different sub-groups.\n\nThis form of mapping chart is best used:\n\nWhen there are hundreds of categories and even deeper layers of sub-categories. For example, Total votes cast w.r.t. States.\n\nTo study the data with respect to only two quantitative values.\n\nTo compare the performance of products and identify similarities and anomalies within a single or multiple categories.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Treemaps\n\nUse contrasting and bright colors to highlight differences between sub-categories.\n\nOrganize the rectangles in order of larger area to smaller in size (i.e., from top to bottom).\n\nMark down each rectangle with text or numbers to make it easy to read.\n\n13. Donut Chart\n\nA donut chart functions the same as a pie chart but is often preferred over the latter because the missing center makes the difference in data quantities more apparent.\n\nEssentially, pie charts can be confusing at first glance because the human eye might not be able to discern the difference in size between each slice. Donut charts force the eye to look at the length of the perimeter, making it easier to discern size.\n\nDownload our FREE Excel Graph Templates for this graph and more!\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nI use donut charts for the same use cases as pie charts, but I tend to prefer the former because of the added benefit that the data is easier to read.\n\nAnother benefit to donut charts is that the empty center leaves room for extra layers of data, like in the examples above.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Donut Charts\n\nUse varying colors to better differentiate the data being displayed, just make sure the colors are in the same palette so viewers aren't put off by clashing hues.\n\n14. Sankey Diagram\n\nA Sankey Diagram visually represents the flow of data between categories, with the link width reflecting the amount of flow. It’s a powerful tool for uncovering the stories hidden in your data.\n\nAs data grows more complex, charts must evolve to handle these intricate relationships. Sankey Diagrams excel at this task.\n\nImage Source\n\nWith ChartExpo, you can create a Sankey Chart with up to eight levels, offering multiple perspectives for analyzing your data. Even the most complicated data sets become manageable and easy to interpret.\n\nYou can customize your Sankey charts and every component including nodes, links, stats, text, colors, and more. ChartExpo is an add-in in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI, you can create beautiful Sankey diagrams while keeping your data safe in your favorite tools.\n\nBest Use Cases for This Type of Chart\n\nSankey diagrams can be used to visualize all types of data which contain a flow of information. It beautifully connects the flows and presents the data in an optimum way.\n\nHere are a few use cases:\n\nSankey diagrams are widely used to visualize energy production, consumption, and distribution. They help in tracking how energy flows from one source (like oil or gas) to various uses (heating, electricity, transportation).\n\nBusinesses use Sankey diagrams to trace customer interactions across different channels and touchpoints. It highlights the flow of users through a funnel or process, revealing drop-off points and success paths.\n\nIn supply chain management, these diagrams show how resources, products, or information flow between suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies.\n\nDesign Best Practices for Sankey Diagrams\n\nWhen utilizing a Sankey diagram, it is essential to maintain simplicity while ensuring accuracy in proportions. Clear labeling and effective color usage are key factors to consider. Emphasizing the logical flow direction and highlighting significant flows will enhance the visualization.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Chart or Graph for Your Data\n\nChannels like social media or blogs have multiple data sources, and managing these complex content assets can get overwhelming. What should you be tracking? What matters most?\n\nHow do you visualize and analyze the data so you can extract insights and actionable information?\n\n1. Identify your goals for presenting the data.\n\nBefore creating any data-based graphics, I ask myself if I want to convince or clarify a point. Am I trying to visualize data that helped me solve a problem? Or am I trying to communicate a change that's happening?\n\nA chart or graph can help compare different values, understand how different parts impact the whole, or analyze trends. Charts and graphs can also be useful for recognizing data that veers away from what you’re used to or help you see relationships between groups.\n\nSo, clarify your goals then use them to guide your chart selection.\n\n2. Figure out what data you need to achieve your goal.\n\nDifferent types of charts and graphs use different kinds of data. Graphs usually represent numerical data, while charts are visual representations of data that may or may not use numbers.\n\nSo, while all graphs are a type of chart, not all charts are graphs. If you don't already have the kind of data you need, you might need to spend some time putting your data together before building your chart.\n\n3. Gather your data.\n\nMost businesses collect numerical data regularly, but you may need to put in some extra time to collect the right data for your chart.\n\nBesides quantitative data tools that measure traffic, revenue, and other user data, you might need some qualitative data.\n\nThese are some other ways you can gather data for your data visualization:\n\nInterviews\n\nQuizzes and surveys\n\nCustomer reviews\n\nReviewing customer documents and records\n\nCommunity boards\n\n4. Select the right type of graph or chart.\n\nChoosing the wrong visual aid or defaulting to the most common type of data visualization could confuse your viewer or lead to mistaken data interpretation.\n\nBut a chart is only useful to you and your business if it communicates your point clearly and effectively.\n\nAsk yourself the questions below to help find the right chart or graph type.\n\nDownload the Excel templates mentioned in the video here.\n\n5 Questions to Ask When Deciding Which Type of Chart to Use\n\n1. Do you want to compare values?\n\nCharts and graphs are perfect for comparing one or many value sets, and they can easily show the low and high values in the data sets. To create a comparison chart, use these types of graphs:\n\nColumn\n\nMekko\n\nBar\n\nPie\n\nLine\n\nScatter plot\n\nBullet\n\n2. Do you want to show the composition of something?\n\nUse this type of chart to show how individual parts make up the whole of something, like the device type used for mobile visitors to your website or total sales broken down by sales rep.\n\nTo show composition, use these charts:\n\nPie\n\nStacked bar\n\nMekko\n\nArea\n\nWaterfall\n\n3. Do you want to understand the distribution of your data?\n\nDistribution charts help you to understand outliers, the normal tendency, and the range of information in your values.\n\nUse these charts to show distribution:\n\nScatter plot\n\nMekko\n\nLine\n\nColumn\n\nBar\n\n4. Are you interested in analyzing trends in your data set?\n\nIf you want more information about how a data set performed during a specific time, there are specific chart types that do extremely well.\n\nYou should choose one of the following:\n\nLine\n\nDual-axis line\n\nColumn\n\n5. Do you want to better understand the relationship between value sets?\n\nRelationship charts can show how one variable relates to one or many different variables. You could use this to show how something positively affects, has no effect, or negatively affects another variable.\n\nWhen trying to establish the relationship between things, use these charts:\n\nScatter plot\n\nBubble\n\nLine\n\nFeatured Resource:The Marketer's Guide to Data Visualization\n\nDownload this free data visualization guide to learn which graphs to use in your marketing, presentations, or project — and how to use them effectively.\n\nPut these new types of charts and graphs into action.\n\nNow that you've chosen the best graph or chart for your project, try a data visualization resource that makes your point clear and visual.\n\nData visualization is just one part of great communication.
