        "text": "To enter data: ILLINOIS TRAFFIC & PEDESTRIAN STOP STUDY SYSTEM\n\nAgency Code or Password assistance: please email DOT.ITPSS@Illinois.gov\n\nThe Illinois Traffic and Pedestrian Stop Study System, maintained by IDOT, collects and compiles Traffic and Pedestrian Stop data from Police Agencies throughout the State of Illinois. Data is submitted by Police Agencies through an IDOT self-reporting application.\n\nThe IDOT system and application allows Police Agencies to submit Traffic and Pedestrian Stop data per individual stop or allows Police Agencies to compile required data using their own application which can then be uploaded to the IDOT system via a text file.\n\nAll Traffic and Pedestrian Stop data collected for 2023 must be submitted by March 1st, 2024.\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Illinois Secretary of State will begin using ‘X’ for Gender X (non-binary, etc.) on Illinois driver’s licenses. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) has decided to follow federal guidelines utilizing the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) and use ‘O’ (Other) for Gender X (non-binary, etc.).\n\nBeginning January 1, 2024, law enforcement agencies submitting traffic and pedestrian stop data will use the following codes for the Gender field.\n\n1 or M for Male\n\n2 or F for Female\n\n3 or O for Gender X (Non-Binary, etc.)\n\n9 or U for Unknown\n\nLaw enforcement agencies will be required to use these codes when submitting crash reporting records to IDOT, whether it be electronically or by paper. All Third Party, XML electronic vendors and paper agencies have been notified of this change."
