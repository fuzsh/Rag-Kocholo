        "text": "Conducting a thorough traffic data analysis can have far-reaching benefits for your organization, no matter if you’re part of a freight planning team, infrastructure group or a professional services firm. Fully embracing a data-driven transportation approach for policy and project planning helps you stay informed and make better decisions, confident that analytics are backing up the direction your strategies are headed.\n\nWhat is a traffic data analysis?\n\nA traffic data analysis is a detailed study of connected vehicle data or other sources of information like station counts or pneumatic tube data. All vehicle movement insights within a defined region are generally reported within the analysis, often including both commercial and passenger vehicle activity. These insights give users an accurate idea of common travel trends as a whole, overall vehicle vocation details and how these vehicle and travel trends are influenced by factors like existing infrastructure, current demand or traffic disruptions.\n\nWhat aspects of transportation does a traffic data analysis involve?\n\nA traffic data analysis starts with collecting rich, accurate transportation data in a specific region or city. The types of data to be studied might include insights on vehicle speeds, travel times, counts, congestion, bottlenecks and safety information. Viewed on a road-by-road basis, this traffic data can help users identify any prevalent challenges in an area’s road networks by supplying them with actual ground truths. Once a traffic data analysis is completed, the next steps will usually involve creating policy and infrastructure strategies that work to remedy the traffic issues identified or proactively work to prevent future problems.\n\nHow can traffic data analysis be used in freight planning?\n\nIn the context of state freight planning, traffic data analytics possess a variety of powerful use cases. Understanding how supply chains move and what factors affect their efficacy using transportation data help freight planners continuously improve travel efficiency throughout their regions. Here are several practical examples of traffic data analytics in action:\n\nEasing Traffic Flows – Heavy road congestion poses multiple detriments to a region, including safety, traffic efficiency and shortened vehicle lifespans. Using a traffic data analysis, freight vehicle movement and traffic slowdowns can be studied intently for potential improvements. The effects of infrastructure projects or policies aimed at reducing traffic can also be modeled in advance, helping your team forecast their efficiency. With smoother traffic flows, freight vehicles reach their destinations faster and supply chains remain streamlined.\n\nBetter Truck Parking Infrastructure – If commercial truck drivers can’t find easy parking in your region, this issue can result in unnecessary stress, safety risks and traffic congestion, not to mention possible Hours-of-Service (HOS) compliance infractions. Studying metrics about where commercial vehicles are currently stopping most often aids transportation planners in identifying current truck parking problems and creating new strategies to solve them. Effective traffic data analytics can reveal not only the most frequent stoppage locations, but also what times commercial vehicles are usually parking at them. By gaining a strong understanding of these tendencies, you can build additional commercial parking options nearby and alleviate strain on existing resources.\n\nGuiding New Sustainability Measures – Stop metrics within a traffic data analysis can help your region execute on environmental objectives like electric vehicle (EV) charger site selection. Coupling where freight vehicles are moving with where they’re stopping gives you a powerful understanding of all travel tendencies, so you can intelligently build up the transportation grid to support more commercial EVs. Examining the locations where traffic bottlenecks usually occur can help you create new policy or infrastructure decisions to reduce excess fuel burn. By supporting more fleets in their initiatives to electrify and reduce carbon emissions, leverage traffic data analytics to improve your region’s sustainability.\n\nGeotab ITS’ approach to traffic data collection and insights aggregation\n\nAt Geotab ITS, we know the value of traffic data collection for constructing tomorrow’s transportation grids.
