        "text": "Year after year, hundreds of marketers report increased efforts and spending on content marketing — or the intention to do so.\n\nBut great content is wasted if your audience doesn’t know it exists.\n\nContent distribution is integral to your content strategy, if not the most essential part.\n\nThis guide will equip you with the tools you need to distribute the content you create. By the end, you’ll be able to build a content distribution strategy that gets your content in front of — and consumed by — your audience.\n\nChapters\n\nContent Distribution\n\nContent Types for Distribtion\n\nPaid Content Distribution\n\nContent Distribution Channels\n\nHow to Build a Content Distribution Strategy\n\nContent Distribution Tools\n\nToday, social media plays a huge role in content distribution — let's take a moment to review what this entails.\n\nWhat is social media content distribution?\n\nSocial media content distribution is the process of sharing, publishing, and promoting content on various social media platforms. This content may be created strictly for social, or it might be re-formatted and used on social.\n\nNo matter which type of content distribution you focus on, the distribution process will happen after you create your content.\n\nHowever, you should know where and how you’re going to publish and promote your content before you put the proverbial pen to paper. Otherwise, your time and resources could go to waste.\n\nContent Marketing Planning Templates\n\nPlan your content strategically with these handy templates.\n\nEditorial Calendar Template\n\nBuyer Persona Templates\n\nSWOT Analysis Templates\n\nSMART Goal Template\n\nDownload Free\n\nAll fields are required.\n\nYou're all set!\n\nClick this link to access this resource at any time.\n\nTake a look at these content distribution statistics:\n\n60% of marketers create one piece of content each day.\n\n8,726 tweets are posted to Twitter each second.\n\nGoogle processes over 8.5 billion searches per day.\n\nAs you can see, in recent years, we've seen a rapid influx of content met with dwindling demand. With almost 4.5 million blog posts published d aily, we can consume only so much content. Marketing influencer Mark Schaefer argues that because of this “content shock,” content marketing may not be a sustainable strategy for every business.\n\nWhile I won’t agree or disagree with this theory, I will outline everything you need to know to distribute your marketing content successfully.\n\nVarious content distribution channels through which you can share your content include:\n\neBooks\n\nPodcasts\n\nVideos\n\nInfographics\n\nCase studies\n\nWebinars\n\nBlogs\n\nContent Distribution Channels\n\nContent distribution channels are the channels through which you share and promote the content you create. The channels you use to distribute your content will vary based on your audience and resources.\n\nThree overarching content distribution channels cover several more specific distribution channels: owned, earned, and paid.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how these three content distribution channels overlap and how you can combine them to enhance their impact and reach.\n\nOwned Content Distribution\n\nOwned channels are the content properties your company owns. You can control when and how content is published on your owned channels. These include your website, blog, social media profiles, email newsletter, or mobile publishing app.\n\nEarned Content Distribution\n\nEarned channels (also known as “shared” channels) are when third parties promote or share your content. These third parties could include customers, journalists, bloggers, and anyone who shares your content for free — hence the name “earned.”\n\nThese channels include public relations, social shares and mentions, guest articles and roundups, and product reviews. They also have forums and communities like Reddit or Quora — while posting on these sites is free, the content is owned by these third parties and therefore falls under earned channels.\n\nPaid Content Distribution\n\nPaid channels are when your company pays to distribute your content on specific channels. This includes pay-per-click (PPC), paid social advertisements, and paid influencer content.\n\nPay-Per-Click (PPC) Ads\n\nWith PPC, an advertiser pays when people interact with their ad through impressions or clicks. PPC falls under search engine marketing (SEM) and, when done right, helps you earn quality leads.\n\nPPC ads are most common in search engine results pages (SERPs) but are also used on social channels. When paired with an SEO strategy, PPC can be integral to your inbound marketing efforts. One of the top platforms for PPC is Google Ads.\n\nSponsored Content\n\nSponsored content is promotional media paid for by an advertiser, created and shared by another person, brand, influencer, or publisher.\n\nSponsored content is most effective when it includes a person or brand that already targets your audience and buyer personas and already aligns well with your brand.\n\nAs a result, sponsored content feels natural rather than invasive or disruptive. You can use sponsored content in various ways, including images, videos, podcasts, social media, and any influencer content.\n\nPaid Influencer Content\n\nPaid influencer marketing requires you to employ leading content creators in your business' niche to help you improve your brand awareness, traffic, and conversions among your shared target audience to your target audience.\n\nInfluencer marketing is effective because it taps into powerful strategies such as word-of-mouth marketing and social proof, which — for today's buyers — may feel more trustworthy and believable than the marketing a company does for itself. Brands are expected to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022.\n\nPaid Social Ads\n\nPaid social ads can include PPC, sponsored, or influencer content. Paid social media ads share your marketing messages and campaigns on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram, while targeting a specific sub-audience on those platforms.\n\nPPC advertising, branded or influencer-generated content, and display ads are all examples of paid social media. A paid social media strategy will likely incorporate tools native to specific social media channels, like Facebook Ads or Instagram Ads, to create, schedule, and share ads to reach your target audience.\n\nNext, let's review what a content distribution strategy is and why it's so important.\n\nHow to Build a Content Distribution Strategy\n\nResearch your target audience\n\nAudit your content\n\nChoose your content distribution channels\n\nDecide on your content types\n\nSet your content distribution KPIs and goals\n\nBuild an editorial calendar\n\nCreate your content\n\nDistribute and market your content\n\nMeasure and analyze your results\n\nA content distribution strategy is important for a few reasons:\n\nIt boosts your content impact past curation and creation. As I said above, great content is useless if nobody reads it. A content distribution strategy gets your gorgeous content in front of the right eyes.\n\nIt aligns your team and the teams you collaborate to create and share the content. Depending on the size of your company, you may have several cooks in the content marketing kitchen. (I know we do at HubSpot.) A content distribution strategy aligns all these parties and ensures you collaborate efficiently.\n\nIt sets goal benchmarks against which you can measure your distribution performance. Content distribution can be vague — a simple press of the “Publish” button, and you’re done. A content distribution strategy helps you set benchmarks and challenging goals to chase while publishing and promoting your work.\n\nHere’s how to build a content distribution strategy for yourself.\n\n1. Research your target audience.\n\nContent distribution is about getting your content in front of your audience — not just any audience. You can’t do this properly if you don’t know where they are and what they like to read. Before you build your strategy any further, research your target audience to know precisely who will consume your content.\n\nStart by collecting demographic data from your website visitors, email subscribers, social media followers, and customers. Look at your audience’s gender, age, income, location, education, and related categories. You can pull this information from Google Analytics or your social media analytics tools.\n\nNext, collect feedback directly from your customers, email subscribers, and social media followers. Ask them about their pain points and needs, as well as how they feel about your current content and distribution efforts.\n\nUse these two data points to create your buyer persona. Your buyer persona(s) act as models of your ideal customers and content consumers and represent their pain points, information preferences, and motivations as you build out the rest of your content distribution strategy.\n\n2. Audit your content.\n\nYou may already have some published content, such as blog posts, videos, social media content, and more. While your new content distribution strategy doesn’t involve removing that content, you should audit it to understand if it’s helping or hurting your distribution efforts.\n\nAuditing your current content will also remind you which topics you’ve already written about and which ones you can expand on.\n\nA thorough content audit is comprised of three main parts:\n\nLogging your content. Logging your content can be done manually or with a tool. (We recommend the latter, especially if you’ve been publishing content on multiple properties and channels.) Tools like Screaming Frog can help you crawl and collect your content, listing each URL, title, and description in a spreadsheet. The free version crawls up to 500 URLs. If you opt for a manual content audit, follow the steps in our blog post here.\n\nAssessing your content impact. If you crawl your content with SEMRush, the tool will also list content length, social shares, and backlinks. This information can help you assess the impact of each piece of content, alerting you to anything that needs to be updated, rewritten, or erased.\n\nIdentifying your content gaps. You can also identify gaps in your content using the Ahrefs Content Gap tool or by performing keyword research to discover new keywords or phrases to add to your content, thus helping it rank higher and for more terms.\n\nCheck out this blog post for 30+ more content auditing tools.\n\n3. Choose your content distribution channels.\n\nYour content distribution channels are arguably more important than your content itself, hence why this step comes before content creation and after target audience research. Once you know your target audience, you’ll have a better idea of getting your content in front of your followers and customers.\n\nDepending on your analysis, you may post on forums and communities like Reddit or Quora — and pay to promote your content on those sites, too. Alternatively, you may choose to share content on social media channels exclusively, or perhaps you find that traditional PR is your best route.\n\nRegardless of your content distribution channels, ensure they align with your audience’s preferences and behaviors.\n\nAlso, optimize your owned distribution channels — your blog, email newsletter, and social media profiles — as these are relatively inexpensive and in your control. Even if research shows that your audience prefers forums to social media or news sites to company blogs, never neglect your owned properties, as these reflect on your brand and product.\n\nAs you work through this step, set aside time to optimize your blog-to-gain readership, brush up on how to send email newsletters (or start sending them), and learn about organic social media marketing.\n\n4. Decide on your content types.\n\nAfter determining your distribution channels, consider what types of content you’d like (and have the resources) to create.\n\nMany companies choose to publish all of their content on their blog and then repurpose and re-publish it. Blog posts are universally consumed, easy to repurpose and localize (i.e., translate into other languages), and simple to share — not to mention that almost 50% of buyers read a company’s blog while making purchase decisions.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend building a business blog and then expanding your content types to share on other channels.\n\nConsider the content types we discussed at the beginning of this guide, and think about how you’ll repurpose and distribute them.\n\n5. Set your content distribution KPIs and goals.\n\nGoals help us recognize where we’re going and what success might look like when we get there. Your content distribution strategy should involve setting goals for your content key performance indicators (KPIs) and their subsequent metrics:\n\nKPIs related related metrics Traffic/each unique Unique page views by channel and source Engagement Bounce rate, average time on page Top content (and falling content) Top page views, top exits Impact Click-throughs, conversions, backlinks Sentiment Comments, social shares\n\nThese metrics may vary based on your distribution channel (i.e., you can’t track comments on your email newsletter or top exists on your social media ads), so be sure to choose the metrics that correspond best to each channel. Establishing a baseline for each channel might take a few months, especially if you haven’t used it before.\n\nSet SMART goals for your content using these metrics. Here’s an example:\n\nSpecific: I want to increase our blog’s organic traffic by boosting backlinks from other reputable websites and blogs. This will increase our search engine ranking, thus bringing in more organic traffic.\n\nMeasurable: I’d like 30 new backlinks to our blog.\n\nAttainable: We’re already generating 10 new backlinks each month without an intentional strategy, so I believe 30 new backlinks with our approach is feasible this month.\n\nRelevant: This goal aligns with our broader organic content marketing strategy and could boost our earned media as we get mentions from press outlets and third-party bloggers.\n\nTime-bound: I’d like to receive these backlinks within the next month.\n\n6. Build an editorial calendar (and include distribution).\n\nContent marketing and distribution require lots of planning to be successful. This is where an editorial content calendar can come in handy. You can create one in Excel or Google Sheet, or even use Google Calendar. Tools like CoSchedule, Asana, and Trello are helpful, too.\n\nYour editorial calendar, like your content distribution strategy, helps your team stay aligned and work towards common goals. It also gives your writers and editors a roadmap for what they’ll be working on in the coming weeks and months.\n\nHere’s what your editorial calendar may look like (using this post as an example):\n\nYour editorial calendar is the perfect place to include your content distribution plans and goals. Here’s what that may look like on your editorial calendar:\n\nSee how the right-hand columns now include categories like “Publish Destinations” and “Repurposing Plans”?

Distribute and market your content.\n\nYou’ve created your content … now it’s time to put it out in the world. Following your editorial calendar and chosen distribution channels, publish and market your new content. As for any marketing channel, follow rules to optimize your posts on each channel.\n\nFor example, our HubSpot team paid for Reddit ads and found that it was helpful to organically engage with Redditors and found that it was useful to organically engage with Redditors as well as pay for ad space. Alternatively, if you’re posting on (or paying for) social media, follow the guidelines for the best times to post and share content — the same goes for sending emails.\n\n9. Measure and analyze your results.\n\nAs always, keep an eye on your content distribution results. Remember those KPIs, metrics, and SMART goals you established in step five? Time to pull those out.\n\nAfter you’ve published your content, look at Google Analytics, your social media analytics dashboards, and your blog performance — depending on where and how you distributed the content. Make sure you set a routine time to measure and analyze (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) to establish a baseline and know which numbers you can beat the following week or month.\n\nWhew!
