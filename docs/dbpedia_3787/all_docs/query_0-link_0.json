        "text": "Traffic distribution can be used to test various angles, for example to perform A/B testing of different variants of a landing page or ad to see, which version resonates the most with the audience.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nTraffic distribution can be applied manually or automatically. A marketer, using ad trackers or analytical platforms, can set equal volumes of traffic coming toward different channels, campaigns or campaign elements or they can decide to distribute traffic unevenly. Many ad tracking platforms offer the option to assign weights to paths, landing pages or offer pages and distribute traffic accordingly to those weights.\n\nIn this scenario, one destination gets more visit than the other. This can be useful if a given destination was proved to be more performant but the second destination is used for testing new angles and ideas.\n\nSo a visitor clicks an ad and the system (ad tracker, analytical platform, CMS or other) decides where a visitor should go based on set parameters.\n\nAutomatic traffic distribution\n\nMany traffic distribution systems, such as Voluum’s Traffic Distribution AI offer an automatic option which dynamically changes volumes of traffic coming toward different destinations in response to performance data. This data could be ROI, conversion rate or other. Such systems employ machine learning to achieve the most optimal result toward selected goal type.\n\nBenefits of traffic distribution\n\nWithout traffic distribution, all available traffic (paid or organic) goes toward one destination. This limits the number of options a marketer has for optimization and prevents them from trying new ideas.\n\nSmart traffic distribution allows to get the most out of each advertising channel this requires several things:\n\nConversion tracking and passing them to a traffic distribution system.\n\nAudience insights, which allow directing various parts of audience to be directed toward different destinations.\n\nPreparing variants of landing pages or campaigns.\n\nTraffic distribution is a great way to maximize created marketing assets, expand the reach and deliver more targeted content that should increase conversion rate. Proper distribution enhances brand visibility, drives engagement, and maximizes conversions, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and business growth.\n\nChallenges\n\nData Management: Handling and analyzing the vast amount of data generated by various channels can be challenging. Marketers need robust analytics tools to gain insights for informed decisions.\n\nDynamic Landscape: Digital marketing channels and algorithms are constantly evolving. Staying updated and adapting strategies accordingly is crucial for maintaining effectiveness.\n\nResource Limitations: Small businesses might struggle with allocating resources to multiple channels effectively. Prioritizing channels and optimizing resource allocation is essential.\n\nConclusion"
