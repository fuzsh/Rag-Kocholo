        "text": "Traffic records program assessments provide states with the information needed to plan traffic records improvement projects. All assessment formats below are based on the Traffic Records Program Assessment Advisory.\n\nNHTSA’s State Traffic Records Assessment Program is a peer assessment of all six traffic records data systems, at no cost to the state, using the questions from Appendix E of the Advisory. Qualified independent assessors will evaluate the state’s responses and provide recommendations, specific and actionable considerations, and a final report. An experienced facilitator supports this process, which includes two meetings and a final report-out. States that wish to request a traffic records assessment should contact their regional NHTSA office.\n\nRather than a full traffic records assessment, states may request a targeted assessment of one or more specific state traffic safety information systems. For example, a state may request an assessment for only one or two data systems, rather than all six. States that wish to request a targeted assessment should contact their regional NHTSA office."
