        "text": "TEAAS training has two parts. The first part consists of online self-paced modules that provide an overview of crash data, routes and features, road codes, mileposting, traffic volumes, severity, and ordinances. The second part is an instructor led class covering intersection studies, strip studies, and crash analysis techniques. The online self-paced modules must be completed prior to being accepted to the instructor led class, and both parts must be completed prior to receiving a permanent TEAAS account. A basic understanding of Excel (opening text files, sorting data, inserting cells, deleting rows, etc.) is desirable, but not required, for this training. The instructor led class is being provided remotely with three days of virtual instruction running from 10 am - 12 pm EST. This is typically offered several times a year. The dates for the next scheduled trainings are listed below. An additional, optional Q&A session will be held on another day following the training.\n\nAugust 27, 28 and 29, 2024\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"
