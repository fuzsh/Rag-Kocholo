Individual roads and streets do not serve travel independently but as part of a network of roads through which the traffic moves.\n\nRIS Viewer\n\nThe Roadway Inventory System Viewer (RIS Viewer) is a GIS web application for displaying data contained in the Roadway Inventory System (RIS) database. At this time the following data is available in this manner:\n\nFederal Aid Eligible System (All Public Roadways)\n\nState Highway, Posted Speed Limits\n\nState Highway, Annual Average Daily Traffic Volumes\n\nTRAFFIC MONITORING SECTION\n\nKurt Matias, Supervisor\n\nManages the collection and processing of traffic monitoring data on state and local highways. Traffic data is collected comprehensively on state routes and federal aid eligible roads, at most bridge locations, and selectively across other state, county, and local roadways within New York State. An estimated Annual Average of Daily Traffic (AADT) is developed for nearly all locations at which traffic data is collected and is available via the Traffic Data Report, Traffic Data Viewer, Roadway Inventory, and other reports and data found online. Archived data is also available upon request.\n\nTraffic Data Requests\n\nTraffic data can be obtained via one of the links listed below or by contacting the Highway Data Services Bureau:\n\nPhone: (518) 457-1965\n\nE-mail: MO-TrafficDataViewer@dot.ny.gov\n\nTraffic Data Report\n\nAn annual report showing a current estimate of the AADT for all state routes and up to three prior counts.\n\nTraffic Data Viewer\n\nThe Traffic Data Viewer is an interactive GIS web application map tool that provides traffic data including vehicle volume, classification, and speed. It also displays annual average daily traffic, truck percentages, and directional design hour volume. Data is available by average per station and by individual count history. It is searchable by such parameters as address, station number, and route by county.\n\nTraffic Data Viewer direct link: nysdottrafficdata.drakewell.com/publicmultinodemap.asp\n\nTraffic Data Viewer landing webpage: www.dot.ny.gov/tdv\n\nFor a guide on basic features of the Traffic Data Viewer, please review this PDF tutorial - Traffic Data Viewer Guide\n\nShapefiles:\n\nTDV_GDB Shapefile_AADT_2019.zip\n\nTDV_GDB Shapefile_AADT_2020.zip\n\nTDV_GDB Shapefile_AADT_2021.zip\n\nTDV_GDB_Shapefile_Short_Counts_2019.zip\n\nTDV_Shapefile_Continuous_Counts_2016.zip\n\nHistoric Traffic Data\n\nA compilation of traffic data (AADT) from 1977 to 2020 (file format: zip file containing csv).\n\nDownloadable Traffic Data\n\nTraffic data is available as comma delimited text files.
