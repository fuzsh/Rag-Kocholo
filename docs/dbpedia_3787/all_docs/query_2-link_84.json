        "text": "Since demand for rail service arises as a result of demand elsewhere in the economy for the products that railroads haul, rail traffic is a useful gauge of broader economic activity, both for specific industries and for the economy as a whole.\n\nA sample of current weekly, monthly and annual information on freight rail traffic is in the interactive charts below. More detailed data is in a variety of AAR statistical products, which are free for AAR full members and available for purchase by non-AAR members through the online catalog.\n\nEmail AAR Policy & Economics with questions.\n\nWeekly Rail Traffic Data\n\nEach week, the major North American railroads report their traffic for the previous week to AAR. This data is published in AAR’s Weekly Railroad Traffic report each Wednesday and sent as a press release at 12 pm. The interactive chart above shows weekly rail traffic trends for the past few years. More detail is available in AAR’s Weekly Railroad Traffic. Carload traffic is classified into 20 major commodity categories. Rail intermodal traffic (shipping containers and truck trailers moved on rail cars) is reported separately. The major rail traffic groups and associated weekly railroad traffic commodity categories include:\n\nChemicals\n\nCoal\n\nFarm Products (excluding grain, grain mill products, and food)\n\nForest Products (primary forest products, lumber and wood, pulp and paper)\n\nGrain\n\nMetallic Ores & Metals (coke, primary metal products, Iron and steel scrap)\n\nMotor Vehicles & Parts\n\nNonmetallic Minerals (crushed stone, sand and gravel, nonmetallic minerals, stone, clay and glass)\n\nPetroleum & Petroleum Products\n\nOther (waste and nonferrous scrap, all other carloads)\n\nDownload Sample WRT Report\n\nMonthly Rail Traffic Data\n\nThe chart above shows monthly rail traffic trends for the past few years created by averaging weekly rail traffic data. More detail is available in the AAR’s Rail Time Indicators Report (RTI). In addition to a vast amount of data on U.S. and Canadian rail traffic, RTI includes more than 15 key economic indicators such as consumer confidence, housing starts, and industrial production. RTI combines all of this information in a single place, highlighting key trends and presenting rail traffic data in the context of specific sectors and the broader economy.\n\nSample Rail Time Indicators\n\nFreight Commodity Statistics (FCS)\n\nEach year, the six U.S. Class I railroads — BNSF, CN (GTC), CPKC, CSX, NS, and UP — provide AAR rail traffic data with far more commodity detail than the weekly or monthly traffic data discussed above. The chart above provides 10-year trends for some major rail commodities based on this alternative source of rail traffic data. Additional​ commodity detail is available in the AAR’s Freight Commodity Statistics report.\n\nFCS 2014 Sample\n\nFCS 2014 RR Detail Sample\n\nFCS 2014 History Sample"
