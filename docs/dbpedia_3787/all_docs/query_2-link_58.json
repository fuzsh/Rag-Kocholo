        "text": "Hello Palo experts,\n\nI want to create a report which tells me what bandwidth has been used on an outside interface, for say the past month. Something that can display the average bandwidth being used during a day would be good. I see on my PA-3050 that under Network>QoS, that live bandwidth stats can be displayed, but can't see where I can export monthly bandwidth stats.\n\nAny advice or tips will be much appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRoberto\n\nG means GigaBytes.\n\nYou can add same filters to Query Builder box that you use in\n\nMonitor > Logs > Traffic\n\nFor example ( zone.src eq INSIDE ) and ( zone.dst eq OUTSIDE )\n\nIt does not give you average but you can add Day to Selected Columns and see amount for every day.\n\nEnterprise Architect, Security @ Cloud Carib Ltd\n\nPalo Alto Networks certified from 2011\n\nHello Raido,\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nI created a test report with the following settings, to see how much traffic was going out a particular interface (Ethernet1/10 is the interface I am interested in).\n\nI get the following result when I do 'run now'.\n\nAm I right that it gives me the total in bytes going out the interface? What does the 'G' mean when I look at 804.5G under bytes? It would be good if the report could tell the average bandwidth going out interface Ethernet 1/10 per day in a calender month.\n\nAny further advice you could give is much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nRoberto"
