        "text": "Making sense of facts, numbers, and measurements is a form of art – the art of data visualization. There is a load of data in the sea of noise. To turn your numbers into knowledge, your job is not only to separate noise from the data but also to present it the right way.\n\nWhat is Data Visualization and Why Does it Matter?\n\nData Visualization is a way of representing data graphically to help people easily understand the information. It can be used to convey complex relationships between different variables or to analyze trends over time. Data visualization can take the form of charts, graphs, maps, histograms, scatter plots, and other visuals. By using colors, shapes, and other visual elements, data visualization can make it easier for people to comprehend large amounts of data quickly and accurately.\n\nData Visualization is a powerful tool for exploring data, identifying patterns and trends, and communicating insights. It can provide insight into correlations and trends that may otherwise be difficult to detect from examining raw data alone. It is why data visualization tools and methods are often used in business, financial analysis, project management, scientific studies, and just about everywhere else – as long as there is some data to visualize.\n\nData Visualization Gone Wrong\n\nMany of us come from the \"PowerPoint generation\" — this is where the roots of our understanding of data visualization and presentation lie. Unfortunately, it is far from anything related to good, and I stand before you as guilty myself.\n\nAnd if you think I'm too cynical about this, don't take only my word for it.\n\nPowerPoint could be the most powerful tool on your computer. But it’s not. Countless innovations fail because their champions use PowerPoint the way Microsoft wants them to, instead of the right way.\n\n– Seth Godin, Marketing expert\n\nThere is no question that PowerPoint has been at least a part of the problem because it has affected a generation. It should have come with a warning label and a good set of design instructions back in the ’90s. But it is also a copout to blame PowerPoint — it is just software, not a method.\n\n– Garr Reynolds, Presentation expert\n\n– Mark Goetz\n\nTo avoid common pitfalls in your presentations, it wouldn’t hurt to review the basics of data visualization.\n\nIn this article, I’ll try to undo some of the damage by sharing some of the best practices for data visualization and representation and, hopefully, save some kittens in the process.\n\nThis is a lengthy article, so here's a list of topics that we'll cover:\n\nData Visualization Best Practices\n\nWhen to use plain tables\n\nHow to use column charts\n\nWhen to use bar charts\n\nHow to use line charts\n\nHow to use area charts\n\nWhy avoid pie charts and donut charts\n\nPropper use of scatter charts\n\nHow to use map charts\n\nHow to use Gantt charts\n\nUsing gauge charts for KPIs\n\nShould you use multi-axes charts\n\nData Visualization Do’s and Don’ts\n\nData Visualization Best Practices\n\nThere are four basic presentation types that you can use to present your data:\n\nComparison\n\nComposition\n\nDistribution\n\nRelationship\n\nUnless you are a statistician or a data analyst, you are most likely using only the two, most commonly used types of data analysis: Comparison or Composition.\n\nSelecting the Right Chart\n\nTo determine which chart is best suited for each of those presentation types, first, you must answer a few questions:\n\nHow many variables do you want to show in a single chart? One, two, three, many?\n\nHow many items (data points) will you display for each variable? Only a few or many?\n\nWill you display values over a period of time, or among items or groups?\n\nBar charts are good for comparisons, while line charts work better for trends. Scatter plot charts are good for relationships and distributions, but pie charts should be used only for simple compositions — never for comparisons or distributions.\n\nThere is a chart selection diagram created by Dr. Andrew Abela that should help you pick the right chart for your data type. (You can download the PDF version here: Chart Selection diagram.)\n\nLet’s dig in and review the most commonly used chart types, some examples, and the dos and don’ts for each chart type.\n\nTables\n\nTables are essentially the source for all the charts. They are best used for comparison, composition, or relationship analysis when there are only a few variables and data points. It would not make much sense to create a chart if the data can be easily interpreted from the table.\n\nUse tables when:\n\nYou need to compare or look up individual values.\n\nYou require precise values.\n\nValues involve multiple units of measure.\n\nThe data has to communicate quantitative information, but not trends.\n\nUse charts when the data presentation:\n\nIs used to convey a message that is contained in the shape of the data.\n\nIs used to show a relationship between many values.\n\nFor example, if you want to show the rate of change, like a sudden drop in temperature, it is best to use a chart that shows the slope of a line because the rate of change is not easily grasped from a table.\n\nColumn Charts\n\nThe column chart is probably the most used chart type. This chart is best used to compare different values when specific values are important, and it is expected that users will look up and compare individual values between each column.\n\nWith column charts, you could compare values for different categories or compare value changes over a period of time for a single category.\n\nBest practices for column charts\n\nUse column charts for comparison if the number of categories is quite small —up to five, but not more than seven categories.\n\nIf one of your data dimensions is time — including years, quarters, months, weeks, days, or hours — you should always set the time dimension on the horizontal axis.\n\nIn charts, time should always run from left to right, never from top to bottom.\n\nFor column charts, the numerical axis must start at zero. Our eyes are very sensitive to the height of columns, and we can draw inaccurate conclusions when those bars are truncated.\n\nAvoid using pattern lines or fills. Use a border only for highlights.\n\nOnly use column charts to show trends if there are a reasonably-low number of data points (less than 20) and if every data point has a clearly-visible value.\n\nColumn Histograms\n\nA histogram is a common variation of column charts used to present the distribution and relationships of a single variable over a set of categories. A good example of a histogram would be a distribution of grades on a school exam or the sizes of pumpkins, divided by size group, in a pumpkin festival.\n\nStacked Column Charts\n\nUse stacked column charts to show a composition. Do not use too many composition items (not more than three or four) and make sure the composing parts are relatively similar in size. It can get messy very quickly.\n\nBefore moving to the next chart type, I wanted to show you a good example of how to improve the effectiveness of your column chart by simplifying it.\n\nCredit: Joey Cherdarchuk\n\nBar Charts\n\nBar charts are essentially horizontal column charts.\n\nIf you have long category names, it is best to use bar charts because they give more space for long text. You should also use bar charts, instead of column charts, when the number of categories is greater than seven (but not more than fifteen) or for displaying a set with negative numbers.\n\nA typical use of bar charts would be visitor traffic from top referral websites. Referring sites are usually more than five to seven sites and website names are quite long, so those should be better horizontally graphed.\n\nAnother example could be sales performance by sales representatives. Again, names can be quite long, and there might be more than seven sales reps.\n\nBar Histogram Charts\n\nJust like column charts, bar charts can be used to present histograms.\n\nA good histogram example is a population distribution by the age (and sex). Remember those Christmas-tree graphs?\n\nStacked Bar Charts\n\nI’m not quite sure about a good application of stacked bar charts — except when there are only a few variables, composition parts, and the emphasis is on composition, not comparison.\n\nStacked bars are not good for comparison or relationship analysis. The only common baseline is along the left axis of the chart, so you can only reliably compare values in the first series and for the sum of all series.\n\nLine Charts\n\nWho doesn’t know line charts? We used to draw those on blackboards in school.\n\nLine charts are among the most frequently used chart types. Use lines when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time, when the number of data points is very high (more than 20).\n\nWith line charts, the emphasis is on the continuation or the flow of the values (a trend), but there is still some support for single value comparisons, using data markers (only with less than 20 data points.)\n\nA line chart is also a good alternative to column charts when the chart is small.\n\nTimeline Charts\n\nThe timeline chart is a variation of line charts. Obviously, any line chart that shows values over a period of time is a timeline chart. The only difference is in functionality — most timeline charts will let you zoom in and out and compress or stretch the time axis to see more details or overall trends.\n\nThe most common examples of a time-line chart might be:\n\nstock market price changes over time,\n\nwebsite visitors per day for the past 30 days,\n\nsales numbers by day for the previous quarter.\n\nThe Dos and Don’ts for Line Charts\n\nUse lines to present continuous data in an interval scale, where intervals are equal in size.\n\nFor line charts, the axis may not start from zero if the intended message of the chart is the rate of change or overall trend, not exact values or comparison. It’s best to start the axis with zero for wide audiences because some people may otherwise interpret the chart incorrectly.\n\nIn line charts, time should always run from left to right.\n\nDo not skip values for consistent data intervals presenting trend information, for example, certain days with zero values.\n\nRemove guidelines to emphasize the trend, rate of change, and to reduce distraction.\n\nUse a proper aspect ratio to show important information and avoid dramatic slope effects. For the best perception, aim for a45-degree slope\n\nArea Charts\n\nAn area chart is essentially a line chart — good for trends and some comparisons. Area charts will fill up the area below the line, so the best use for this type of chart is for presenting accumulative value changes over time, like item stock, number of employees, or a savings account.\n\nDo not use area charts to present fluctuating values, like the stock market or prices changes.\n\nStacked Area\n\nStacked area charts are best used to show changes in composition over time. A good example would be the changes of market share among top players or revenue shares by product line over a period of time.\n\nStacked area charts might be colorful and fun, but you should use them with caution, because they can quickly become a mess. Don’t use them if you need an exact comparison and don’t stack together more than three to five categories.\n\nPie Charts and Donut Charts\n\nWho doesn’t love pies or donuts, right? Not in data visualization, though. These charts are among the most frequently used and also misused charts. The one above is a good example of a terrible, useless pie chart - too many components, very similar values.\n\nA pie chart typically represents numbers in percentages, used to visualize a part to whole relationship or a composition. Pie charts are not meant to compare individual sections to each other or to represent exact values (you should use a bar chart for that).\n\nWhen possible, avoid pie charts and donuts. The human mind thinks linearly but, when it comes to angles and areas, most of us can’t judge them well.\n\nStacked Donut Charts\n\nI would not recommend using stacked donut charts at all! I mean, like, never! You might think that you could use a stacked donut to present composition, while allowing some comparison (with an emphasis on composition), but it would perform badly for both. Use stacked column charts instead.\n\nHere’s a good example of how to use pie chart effectively.\n\nCredit: Joey Cherdarchuk\n\nThe Dos and Don’ts for Pie charts\n\nFor those of you who still feel sentimental about the old PowerPoint Pie charts, and want to keep using them, there are some things to keep in mind.\n\nMake sure that the total sum of all segments equals100 percent.\n\nUse pie charts only if you haveless than six categories, unless there’s aclear winner you want to focus on.\n\nIdeally, there should beonly two categories, like men and women visiting your website, or only one category, like a market share of your company, compared to the whole market.\n\nDon’t use a pie chart if the category values arealmost identical or completely different. You could add labels, but that’s a patch, not an improvement.\n\nDon’t use 3D or blow apart effects — they reduce comprehension and show incorrect proportions.\n\nScatter Charts\n\nScatter charts are primarily used for correlation and distribution analysis. Good for showing the relationship between two different variables where one correlates to another (or doesn’t).\n\nScatter charts can also show the data distribution or clustering trends and help you spot anomalies or outliers.\n\nA good example of scatter charts would be a chart showing marketing spending vs. revenue.\n\nBubble Charts\n\nA bubble chart is a great option if you need to add another dimension to a scatter plot chart. Scatter plots compare two values, but you can add bubble size as the third variable and thus enable comparison. If the bubbles are very similar in size, use labels.\n\nWe could in fact add the fourth variable by color-grading those bubbles or displaying them as pie charts, but that’s probably too much.\n\nA good example of a bubble chart would be a graph showing marketing expenditures vs. revenue vs. profit. A standard scatter plot might show a positive correlation for marketing costs and revenue (obviously), when a bubble chart could reveal that an increase in marketing costs is chewing on profits.\n\nUse Scatter and Bubble charts to:\n\nPresent relationships between two (scatter) or three (bubble) numerical variables,\n\nPlot two or three sets of variables on one x-y coordinate plane,\n\nTurn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale, thus showing the relationships between more widely distributed elements.\n\nPresent patterns in large sets of data, linear or non-linear trends, correlations, clusters, or outliers.\n\nCompare large number of data points without regard to time. The more data you include in a scatter chart, the better comparisons you can make.\n\nPresent relationships, but not exact values for comparisons.\n\nMap Charts\n\nMap charts are good for giving your numbers a geographical context to quickly spot best and worst performing areas, trends, and outliers. If you have any kind of location data like coordinates, country names, state names or abbreviations, or addresses, you can plot related data on a map.\n\nMaps won’t be very good for comparing exact values, because map charts are usually color scaled and humans are quite bad at distinguishing shades of colors. Sometimes it’s better to use overlay bubbles or numbers if you need to convey exact numbers or enable comparison.\n\nA good example would be website visitors by country, state, or city, or product sales by state, region or city.\n\nBut, don’t use maps for absolutely everything that has a geographical dimension. Today, almost any data has a geographical dimension, but it doesn’t mean that you should display it on a map.\n\nWhen to use map charts?\n\nIf you want to display quantitative information on a map.\n\nTo present spatial relationships and patterns.\n\nWhen a regional context for your data is important.\n\nTo get an overview of the distribution across geographic locations.\n\nOnly if your data is standardized (that is, it has the same data format and scale for the whole set).\n\nGantt Charts\n\nGantt charts were adapted by Karol Adamiecki in 1896. But the name comes from Henry Gantt who independently adapted this bar chart type much later, in the 1910s.\n\nGantt charts are good for planning and scheduling projects. Gantt charts are essentially project maps, illustrating what needs to be done, in what order, and by what deadline. You can visualize the total time a project should take, the resources involved, as well as the order and dependencies of tasks.\n\nBut project planning is not the only application for a Gantt chart. It can also be used in rental businesses, displaying a list of items for rent (cars, rooms, apartments) and their rental periods.\n\nTo display a Gantt chart, you would typically need, at least, a start date and an end date. For more advanced Gantt charts, you’d enter a completion percentage and/or a dependency from another task.\n\nGauge Charts\n\nGauge charts are good for displaying KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). They typically display a single key value, comparing it to a color-coded performance level indicator, typically showing green for “good” and red for “trouble.”\n\nA Dashboard would be the most obvious place to use Gauge charts. There, all the KPIs will be in one place and will give a quick “health check” for your project or company.\n\nGauges are a great choice to:\n\nShow progress toward a goal.\n\nRepresent a percentile measure, like a KPI.\n\nShow an exact value and meaning of a single measure.\n\nDisplay a single bit of information that can be quickly scanned and understood.\n\nThe bad side of gauge charts is that they take up a lot of space and typically only show a single point of data. If there are many gauge charts compared against a single performance scale, a column chart with threshold indicators would be a more effective and compact option.\n\nMulti Axes Charts\n\nThere are times when a simple chart just cannot tell the whole story. If you want to show relationships and compare variables on vastly different scales, the best option might be to have multiple axes.\n\nA multi-axes chart will let you plot data using two or more y-axes and one shared x-axis. But it comes at a cost. That is, the charts are much more difficult to read and understand.\n\nMulti-axes charts might be good for presenting common trends, correlations (or the lack thereof) and the relationships between several data sets. But multi-axes charts are not good for exact comparisons (because of different scales) and you should not use this type if you need to show exact values.\n\nUse multi-axes charts if you want to:\n\nDisplay a line chart and a column chart with the same X-axis.\n\nCompare multiple measures with different value ranges.\n\nIllustrate the relationships, correlation, or the lack thereof between two or more measures in one visualization.\n\nSave canvas space (if the chart does not become too complicated).\n\nData Visualization Do’s and Don’ts – A General Conclusion"
