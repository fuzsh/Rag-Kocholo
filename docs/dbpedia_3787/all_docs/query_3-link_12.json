        "text": "The main goal of TREDS (Traffic Records Electronic Data System) is to provide accurate, timely and detailed highway safety information for analysis and reporting. The data from TREDS is used to support Virginia’s efforts to reduce crashes, injuries, fatalities and associated costs. Through TREDS, Virginia now has one of the most effective and innovative information technology tools in the nation to identify and address its highway safety concerns.\n\nThis state-of-the-art, automated data system centralizes all of Virginia’s crash data and related information. A recent enhancement to the system’s mapping tool, now allows users to combine safety program areas, such as impaired driving and speed, and it also allows agencies to focus on the crash data in their jurisdiction whereas in the past, users have only been able to narrow the data down to the county level.\n\nThe comprehensive data housed in TREDS is the foundation of highway safety in Virginia. The information serves as a performance measurement tool that reflects Virginia's efforts to improve highway safety. TREDS traffic crash information can be used to:\n\nConduct problem identification and the development of resolutions for safety programs\n\nCreate and implement effective, integrated safety programs and initiatives\n\nConduct education and awareness initiatives\n\nMake executive management decisions\n\nAward and target federal highway safety funding\n\nMake key legislative decisions that impact citizen safety on our roadways\n\nTargeting local and state law enforcement efforts\n\nMake engineering and construction improvements to our roadways\n\nWork with partnering organizations to develop coordinated, innovative approaches to improve highway safety\n\nTREDS will pave the way for Virginia’s effort to develop and implement effective safety programs that will make Virginia's roadways among the safest in the country."
