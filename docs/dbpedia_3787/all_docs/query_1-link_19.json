        "text": "This article was updated in Dec. 2021.\n\nSometimes the median and mean aren't enough to understand a dataset. Are most of the values clustered around the median? Or are they clustered around the minimum and the maximum with nothing in the middle? When you have questions like these, distribution plots are your friends.\n\nThe box plot is an old standby for visualizing basic distributions. It's convenient for comparing summary statistics (such as range and quartiles), but it doesn't let you see variations in the data. For multimodal distributions (those with multiple peaks) this can be particularly limiting.\n\nBut fret not—this is where the violin plot comes in.\n\nWhat is a violin plot\n\nHow to read a violin plot\n\nExamples of Violin Plots\n\nTools for making violin plots\n\nWhat is a violin plot?\n\nA violin plot is a hybrid of a box plot and a kernel density plot, which shows peaks in the data. It is used to visualize the distribution of numerical data. Unlike a box plot that can only show summary statistics, violin plots depict summary statistics and the density of each variable.\n\nHow to read a violin plot\n\nViolin plots have many of the same summary statistics as box plots:\n\nthe white dot represents the median\n\nthe thick gray bar in the center represents the interquartile range\n\nthe thin gray line represents the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the interquartile range.\n\nOn each side of the gray line is a kernel density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data. Wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that members of the population will take on the given value; the skinnier sections represent a lower probability.\n\nEnough of the theoretical. Let's look at some examples. We'll be using Seaborn, a Python library purpose-built for making statistical visualizations.\n\nWant to make your own violin plots in Mode?

The box plot elements show the median weight for horsebean-fed chicks is lower than for other feed types. The shape of the distribution (extremely skinny on each end and wide in the middle) indicates the weights of sunflower-fed chicks are highly concentrated around the median.\n\nHorizontal violin plot with observations\n\nMode Analytics\n\nClick here to see the complete Python notebook generating this plot.\n\nLike horizontal bar charts, horizontal violin plots are ideal for dealing with many categories. Swapping axes gives the category labels more room to breathe.\n\nYou can remove the traditional box plot elements and plot each observation as a point. Points come in handy when your dataset includes observations for an entire population (rather than a select sample). When you have the whole population at your disposal, you don't need to draw inferences for an unobserved population; you can assess what's in front of you.\n\nReducing the kernel bandwidth generates lumpier plots, which can aid in identifying minor clusters, such as the tail of casein-fed chicks.\n\nGrouped violin plot\n\nViolin plots can also illustrate a second-order categorical variable. You can create groups within each category. For instance, you can make a plot that distinguishes between male and female chicks within each feed type group.\n\nMode Analytics\n\nClick here to see the complete Python notebook generating this plot.\n\nThe grouped violin plot shows female chicks tend to weigh less than males in each feed type category. Further, you can draw conclusions about how the sex delta varies across categories: the median weight difference is more pronounced for linseed-fed chicks than soybean-fed chicks.\n\nGrouped violin plot with split violins\n\nInstead of drawing separate plots for each group within a category, you can instead create split violins and replace the box plot with dashed lines representing the quartiles for each group.\n\nMode Analytics\n\nClick here to see the complete Python notebook generating this plot.\n\nThe split violins should help you compare the distributions of each group. For instance, you might notice that female sunflower-fed chicks have a long-tail distribution below the first quartile, whereas males have a long-tail above the third quartile.\n\nSeaborn (Python)\n\nmatplotlib (Python)\n\nPlotly (Python)\n\nvioplot (R)\n\nd3.js (JavaScript)\n\nFurther reading on violin plots\n\nBox Plot vs Violin Plot in R (Cerebral Mastication)\n\nViolin plots are great (Eamon Caddigan)\n\nViolin Plot (Data Visualisation Catalogue)\n\nNew to data analysis?
