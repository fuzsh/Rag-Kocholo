        "text": "Predicting accurate peak-hour traffic volumes has become increasingly important as they are being used more and more for quantitative analysis both for determining benefits of highway improvements and for estimating pollutant emission levels. A traditional and commonly used procedure predicts the daily traffic demand for all network links, converting these volumes to peak-hour quantities using \"K\" factors. The accuracy at the link level is highly questionable, as these factors do not capture the variability in the characteristics of the trip or trip-maker across links, which might influence the peak hour factors. The research presented in this report describes a study of peak spreading at ten freeway locations in Connecticut. It considers both congestion and site-related variables for predicting the proportion of the peak-period volume on a highway link concentrated in the highest hour during the period. This effort is intended to enhance the existing traditional four-step transportation planning procedure. Log-linear regression is used to relate the congestion measure and site-related variables to the peak-hour proportion. Findings of the research are presented along with discussion of ongoing research activities in this area.\n\nRecord URL:\n\nhttp://cdm15019.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p128501coll2/id/47548/rec/1\n\nRecord URL:\n\nhttps://ntlrepository.blob.core.windows.net/lib/16000/16100/16143/PB2000102761.pdf\n\nCorporate Authors:\n\nUniversity of Connecticut, Storrs\n\nConnecticut Transportation Institute\n\n179 Middle Turnpike\n\nStorrs, CT United States 06269-5202\n\nConnecticut Department of Transportation\n\n2800 Berlin Turnpike\n\nNewington, CT United States 06131\n\nAuthors:\n\nIvan, J N\n\nAllaire, S A\n\nPublication Date: 2000-1\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\nMedia Info\n\nFeatures: Appendices; Figures; References; Tables;\n\nPagination: 84 p.\n\nSubject/Index Terms\n\nTRT Terms: Estimating; Freeways; Link volume; Peak periods; Traffic congestion; Traffic distribution; Transportation planning\n\nUncontrolled Terms: Log-linear models\n\nGeographic Terms: Connecticut\n\nSubject Areas: Highways; Operations and Traffic Management; I71: Traffic Theory;\n\nFiling Info"
