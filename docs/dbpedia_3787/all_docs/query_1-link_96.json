        "text": "Once you add the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK, you can use the Analytics section in the Firebase console and the Reports section in your Google Analytics property to see your app data. The app reports in the Firebase console are identical to the app reports in your Google Analytics property.\n\nThis page describes how to view your Analytics reports and what data is available in each report. To learn more about Analytics and its features, such as audiences, conversions, and remarketing, see the Google Analytics help center.\n\nGet started with Analytics reports\n\nThe app reports in the Firebase console and in your Google Analytics property provide comprehensive in-app behavioral and marketing analytics for web and mobile apps. You get insight into your app marketing performance and how users engage with your app. The reports also enable you create audiences and connect with third-party networks to make your insights actionable.\n\nView your Analytics reports\n\nTo view your reports in the Firebase console, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Firebase console.\n\nSelect your Firebase project.\n\nIn the left-side navigation menu, expand Analytics.\n\nClick the reports you want to view, such as Dashboard, Events, or Audiences.\n\nWhen viewing a report in the Firebase console, you can click View more in Google Analytics to open the report in your Google Analytics property.\n\nLearn about each Analytics report\n\nThe following table describes each report in the Firebase console and where you can find the report in your Google Analytics property:\n\nReport in\n\nFirebase console Report in\n\nGoogle Analytics Description Dashboard Firebase overview See a summary of data about your linked apps to help you monitor engagement, see how much revenue you're generating, and evaluate the success of your app releases. Learn more about the report. Realtime Analytics Realtime Monitor app activity in the last 30 minutes (per minute) so you can evaluate the impact of new campaigns and app changes on your traffic. Learn more about the report. Events Events See how many times each event is triggered and how many users trigger each event on your app. This data can help you make improvements to the user experience and increase conversions. Learn more about the report. Conversions Conversions See how often users triggered each conversion event and how many users triggered each conversion event. Learn more about the report. Audiences Audiences Create, edit, and archive audiences to segment your users in ways that are important to your business. You can segment by dimensions, metrics, and events to include practically any subset of users. Learn more about the report. Custom Definitions Custom definitions Create custom dimensions and metrics using values from event parameters and user properties. This enables you to report on information about your users and how they interact with your app. Learn more about the report. Latest Release Latest release Report on important metrics for your app, like app adoption (for example, how many users upgrade), engagement (for example, what are people doing in the app), and stability (for example, how often does the app crash). Learn more about the report. DebugView DebugView Monitor events and user properties as they are collected by Google Analytics to ensure that you're collecting data correctly. Learn more about the report.\n\nUnderstand where Analytics data comes from\n\nThe Google Analytics for Firebase SDK collects basic app-usage data through automatically collected events and predefined user properties. This data can help you understand basic interactions, such as how many times your app was opened, how often in-app purchases were made, and how many users were active in a chosen time period.\n\nIn addition to the basic app-usage data, you can set up recommended events, custom events, and user properties to collect more data than what's collected by default.\n\nExport your data in BigQuery\n\nIn addition to seeing your data in Analytics reports, you can export your data to BigQuery. BigQuery is a Google Cloud tool that lets you run fast queries on large datasets.\n\nYou can export all of your raw, unsampled events to BigQuery and use a SQL-like syntax to query that data. In BigQuery, you can choose to export your data to an external storage or import external data to combine it with your Analytics data.\n\nWhen you export data to BigQuery, you own that data, and you can use BigQuery ACLs to manage permissions on projects and datasets."
