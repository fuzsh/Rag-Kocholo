        "text": "With the help of the BeMob Advanced Rules settings you can create rule-based paths to route your traffic according to the required conditions.\n\nFor example, you want to display your offer for Chrome users only. In this case you can create Flow or Built-In Flow with the Browser And Version set up as a condition for traffic distribution.\n\nÂ¶ Flow Rules\n\nFlow is type of campaign destination that can be set up in BeMob.\n\nA flow is used to redirect visitors of your campaign to the selected landing pages and offers according to the conditions: device types, languages, ISPs, countries, operation systems and other parameters.\n\nTo create a flow with BeMob access Flows section on the panel and press New button.\n\nThere are two types of paths in a flow: default and rule-based.\n\nDefault paths have no conditions for traffic targeting.\n\nA single default path is always required to be set in a flow.\n\nðŸ‘‰ The detailed information about how to set a default path in flow settings is available in our guide.\n\nRule-based paths provide traffic to be targeted to a particular destination according to the conditions set.\n\nTo create a rule-based path:\n\nPress Add new rule button.\n\nDefine the Name to navigate easy through list of rule-based paths.\n\nPress Add condition and select the required amount of conditions from the drop-down list.\n\nSelect the required value for your condition from the list.\n\nIf you want to delete a single condition, press x.\n\nYou can delete all conditions in one click pressing Remove all conditions button.\n\nThere are two options to route traffic within flow paths: Equal and Not equal.\n\nEqual should be selected if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nFor instance, the visitors from United States should be redirected to the rule-based path. In this case it is required to select Equal.\n\nNot equal should be selected if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition not to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nFor instance, the visitors from United States shouldn't be redirected to the rule-based path. In this case it is required to select Not equal.\n\nRules work on the basis of logical relation AND/OR.\n\nWhen Logical AND is selected, a visitor can reach the right path only if he matches all the conditions.\n\nFor instance, you create a path for Apple iPhone 6s users from Australia. Even if one condition is not respected, then user is redirected to another rule.\n\nYou can see the sample of settings below.\n\nWhen Logical OR is selected, a visitor can reach the right path if he matches at least one the conditions selected.\n\nFollowing the previous example, Apple iPhone 6s users will reach this path even if they from the country different from one set for the rule. In the same way all the visitors from Australia will reach this path even if they are not iPhone 6s users.\n\nRules are required to set the priority for specific conditions and to avoid conflicting priorities.\n\nRules work on priority basis.\n\nBy moving rules up and down you change the priority for each of them.\n\nIt is required to add at least 2 rules to the flow to change the priority.\n\nIf campaign visitors match several rule conditions, they will be redirected to the flow with the superior priority.\n\nIf a user doesn't meet any condition of rule with the highest priority, he will be redirected to the second rule, then further and further, until he finally matches a condition of the rule with the lowest priority.\n\nIf a visitor doesn't match any rule condition, he will be forwarded to the Default path.\n\nAfter the flow is successfully created you can select it in campaign settings.\n\nÂ¶ Built-In Flow Rules\n\nBuilt-In Flow campaign destination helps to save your time and create a tracking flow when setting up a campaign.\n\nAccess the settings of existing campaign or create a new one to set Built-In Flow rules.\n\nThere are two types of paths in Built-In Flow: default and rule-based.\n\nDefault paths have no conditions for traffic targeting.\n\nA single default path is always required to be set in Built-In Flow.\n\nðŸ‘‰ The detailed information about how to set a default path in campaign settings is available in our guide.\n\nRule-based paths provide traffic to be targeted to a particular destination according to the conditions set.\n\nTo create a rule-based path:\n\nPress Add New Rule button.\n\nress Add condition and select the required amount of conditions from the drop-down list.\n\nSelect the required value for your condition form the list.\n\nIf you want to delete a single condition, press x.\n\nYou can delete all conditions in one click pressing Remove all conditions button.\n\nThere are two options to rout traffic within flow paths: Equal and Not equal.\n\nEqual should be selected if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nFor instance, the visitors from United States should be redirected to the rule-based path. In this case it is required to select Equal.\n\nNot equal should be selected if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition not to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nFor instance, the visitors from United States shouldn't be redirected to the rule-based path. In this case it is required to select Not equal.\n\nRules work on the basis of logical relation AND/OR.\n\nWhen Logical AND is selected, a visitor can reach the right path only if he matches all the conditions.\n\nFor instance, you create a path for Apple iPhone 6s users from Australia. Even if one condition is not respected, then user is redirected to another rule.\n\nYou can see the sample of settings below.\n\nThese rules are required to set the priority for specific conditions and to avoid conflicting priorities.\n\nBy moving your rules up and down you can set the priority for each of them. You should add at least 2 rules to the flow to change their priority.\n\nWhen Logical OR is selected, a visitor can reach the right path if he matches at least one the conditions selected.\n\nFollowing the previous example, Apple iPhone 6s users will reach this path even if they from the country different from one set for the rule. In the same way all the visitors from Australia will reach this path even if they are not iPhone 6s users.\n\nThese rules are required to set the priority for specific conditions and to avoid conflicting priorities.\n\nRules work on priority basis.\n\nBy moving rules up and down you change the priority for each of them.\n\nIt is required to add at least 2 rules to the flow to change the priority.\n\nIf campaign visitors match several rule conditions, they will be redirected to the flow with the superior priority.\n\nIf a user doesn't meet any condition of rule with the highest priority, he will be redirected to the second rule, then further and further, until he finally matches a condition of the rule with the lowest priority.\n\nIf a visitor doesn't match any rule condition, he will be forwarded to the Default path.\n\nÂ¶ Available Conditions\n\nThere are 34 conditions which can be used in Flow/Built-In Flow rules. The list of conditions and their description are available in the table below.\n\nCondition Description Brand And Model Visitor's device brand and model Browser And Version Visitor's device browser and version Connection Type Visitor's connection type Country Visitor's country State / Region Visitor's state/region City Visitor's city Custom Token Custom token Query Header Query header Custom 1-10 10 custom parameters supported by your traffic source Day Of Week Day of the week when you want to redirect traffic by this rule Device Type Visitor's device type IP Visitor's IP ISP Visitor's ISP Language Visitor's browser language Mobile Carrier Visitor's mobile carrier OS And Version OS and version of visitor's device Referrer Referrer data Referrer Domain Referrer domain data Time Of Day Time when you want to redirect traffic by this rule User Agent User agent Uniqueness Visitor's uniqueness according to the selected uniqueness period Bot Filter Marks Bot Filter marks WebView WebView (in-app browser) Crawler Crawler Proxy Proxy\n\nÂ¶ Rule-Based Paths for Custom Parameters\n\nAlmost all traffic sources can pass the data on publisher, website, target, keyword etc. This data is passed in the corresponding tracking parameters supported by your traffic source.\n\nEach traffic source supports the unique list of tracking parameters that should be added to traffic source template in BeMob.\n\nTo track data of custom parameter supported by your traffic source you should complete Query Param, Token and Name fields in traffic source template.\n\nFor instance, your traffic source can pass data of Zone ID. This is how traffic source settings should look like in this case:\n\nðŸ‘‰ More info about how to set custom parameters is available in our guide.\n\nData of this parameter will be available in Custom 1 report.\n\nYou can use this data as value for Custom 1 condition.\n\nFor instance, you want traffic from 123456789 zone to be sent to Offer 1. At the same time traffic from 987654321 zone should be sent to Offer 2.\n\nIn this case you should perform the following steps:\n\nGo to Flow/Campaign settings.\n\nCreate a new rule with Custom 1 as condition.\n\nPaste 123456789 in the corresponding field.\n\nYou should use the value (not tracking parameter or token) that is available in the corresponding Custom report.\n\nSelect Equal option if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nGo to path settings and add the required offer from the list.\n\nCreate a new rule with Custom 1 as condition.\n\nPaste 987654321 in the corresponding field.\n\nYou should use the value (not tracking parameter or token) that is available in the corresponding Custom report.\n\nSelect Equal option if you want traffic that fits within the specified condition to be sent to the path with this condition.\n\nGo to path settings and add the required offer from the list.\n\nGo to Default path settings and add the required offer from the list.\n\nAccording to these settings traffic from 123456789 zone will be sent to Offer 1 and traffic from 987654321 zone will be sent to Offer 2. Remnant traffic will be sent to Default path with Offer 3."
