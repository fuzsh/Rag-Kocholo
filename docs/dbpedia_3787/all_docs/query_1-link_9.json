        "text": "Uniform Distribution is the probability distribution that represents equally likely outcomes i.e. the probability of each outcome occurring is the same. There are two types of uniform distribution: Discrete uniform distribution and continuous uniform distribution (the most common type in elementary statistics). It defines the density function of the random variable, mean, and variance.\n\nIn this article, we will learn about uniform distribution, types of uniform distribution, and uniform distribution formulas along with some solved examples based on it.\n\nUniform Distribution\n\nA uniform distribution is a distribution that has constant probability due to equally likely occurring events. It is also known as rectangular distribution (continuous uniform distribution). It has two parameters a and b: a = minimum and b = maximum. The distribution is written as U (a, b).\n\nUniform Distribution Definition\n\nA uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution where every possible outcome has an equal probability of occurring. This means that all values within a given range are equally likely to be observed.\n\nGraph of Uniform Distribution\n\nCalculating the height of the rectangle:\n\nThe maximum probability of the variable X is 1 so the total area of the rectangle must be 1.\n\nArea of rectangle = base × height = 1\n\n(b – a) × f(x) = 1\n\nf(x) = 1/(b – a) = height of the rectangle\n\nNote: Discrete uniform distribution: Px = 1/n. Where, Px = Probability of a discrete variable, n = Number of values in the range\n\nUniform Distribution Formula\n\nA random variable X is said to be uniformly distributed over the interval -∞ < a < b < ∞. Formulae for uniform distribution:\n\nProbability density function(pdf) f(x) = 1/( b – a), a ≤ x ≤ bMean(μ)\n\n[Tex]\\int_{a}^{b} x.f(x) \\,dx =\\frac{1}{b-a}[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_a^b [/Tex]\n\n= (a + b)/2\n\nVariance (σ2 )\n\n[Tex]\\int_{a}^{b} x.f(x) \\,dx =\\frac{1}{b-a}[\\frac{x^2}{2}]_a^b [/Tex]\n\n= μ2‘ – μ2 = [Tex]\\int_{a}^{b}x^2.\\frac{1}{b-a}dx \\hspace{0.1cm}-(\\frac{a+b}{2})^2 [/Tex]\n\n= (b – a)2 /12\n\nStandard Deviation (σ)\n\n[Tex]= \\sqrt {\\frac{(b – a)^2}{12}}[/Tex]\n\nCumulative Distribution function (cdf)= (x – a)/(b – a) for x ∈ [a , b] Median = (a + b)/2For the conditional probability = P( c < x < d )\n\n= (d – c ) × f(x)\n\n= (d – c)/(b – a)\n\nTypes of Uniform Distribution\n\nTypes of uniform distribution are:\n\nContinuous Uniform Distribution: A continuous uniform probability distribution is a distribution that has an infinite number of values defined in a specified range. It has a rectangular-shaped graph so-called rectangular distribution. It works on the values which are continuous in nature. Example: Random number generator\n\nDiscrete Uniform Distribution: A discrete uniform probability distribution is a distribution that has a finite number of values defined in a specified range. Its graph contains various vertical lines for each finite value. It works on values that are discrete in nature. Example: A dice is rolled.\n\nLet’s discuss these types in detail as follows.\n\nContinuous Uniform Distributions or Rectangular Distributions\n\nContinuous uniform distributions, also known as rectangular distributions, are probability distributions where the probability density function (PDF) is constant within a certain interval and zero elsewhere. This means that all outcomes within the interval are equally likely.\n\nContinuous uniform distributions provide a simple yet powerful framework for understanding and modeling randomness within defined intervals, making them essential tools in probability theory and applied statistics.\n\nProbability Density Function (PDF)\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of a continuous uniform distribution defines the probability of a random variable falling within a particular interval. For a continuous uniform distribution over the interval [a, b], the PDF is given by:\n\nf(x) = 1 / (b – a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n\nand f(x) = 0 otherwise.\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a continuous uniform distribution gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. For the continuous uniform distribution over [a, b], the CDF is defined as:\n\nF(x) = (x – a) / (b – a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n\nand F(x) = 0 for x < a, F(x) = 1 for x > b.\n\nGenerating Functions\n\nGenerating functions provide a way to represent sequences of numbers as power series. In probability theory, generating functions are often used to manipulate sequences of random variables. They can simplify calculations and help derive important properties of random variables and distributions.\n\nStandard Uniform Distribution\n\nThe standard uniform distribution is a special case of the continuous uniform distribution where the interval is [0, 1]. It is widely used in simulations, random number generation, and various statistical applications.\n\nProperties of Continuous Uniform Distributions\n\nEqual probability density within the interval.\n\nCumulative distribution function increases linearly within the interval.\n\nThe mean of a continuous uniform distribution is the midpoint of the interval.\n\nThe variance of a continuous uniform distribution is [(b – a)2] / 12.\n\nApplications of Continuous Uniform Distributions\n\nModelling uncertainty in various fields such as engineering, finance, and physics.\n\nRandom number generation for simulations and games.\n\nUsed in statistical quality control to model uniformity in manufacturing processes.\n\nIn cryptography for generating keys and creating random permutations.\n\nAs a baseline distribution for comparison with other distributions in statistical analysis.\n\nDiscrete Uniform Distribution\n\nDiscrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes the likelihood of outcomes when each outcome in a finite set is equally likely. It’s characterized by a constant probability mass function (PMF) over a finite range of values.\n\nThe discrete uniform distribution serves as a fundamental model in probability theory and statistics, providing a simple yet effective way to describe uncertainty in situations where outcomes are equally likely. Its properties and applications extend across various disciplines, making it a versatile tool in data analysis and decision-making processes.\n\nEstimation of Maximum\n\nIn statistics, the estimation of the maximum refers to methods used to estimate the largest value or the maximum observation in a dataset. Techniques such as order statistics and maximum likelihood estimation are commonly employed for this purpose.\n\nRandom Permutation\n\nA random permutation is a random arrangement of a set of items or elements. It’s often used in various fields such as cryptography, statistics, and computer science. Generating random permutations is essential in algorithms, simulations, and experimental designs.\n\nProperties of Discrete Uniform Distribution\n\nEach outcome in the sample space has an equal probability of occurrence.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) is constant over the range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe mean of a discrete uniform distribution is the average of the minimum and maximum values.\n\nThe variance of a discrete uniform distribution is [(n^2 – 1) / 12], where n is the number of possible outcomes.\n\nApplications of Discrete Uniform Distribution\n\nRolling fair dice or flipping fair coins, where each outcome has an equal probability.\n\nModeling scenarios where there is no preference or bias towards any particular outcome.\n\nSampling without replacement, such as selecting random samples from a finite population.\n\nGenerating random numbers for simulations, Monte Carlo methods, and randomized algorithms.\n\nCreating random permutations for shuffling decks of cards, designing experiments, and cryptographic applications.\n\nRead More,\n\nPoisson Distribution\n\nBinomial Distribution\n\nNormal Distribution\n\nSample Questions\n\nQuestion 1: A random variable X has a uniform distribution over(-2, 2),\n\n(i) find k for which P(X>k) = 1/2 (ii) Evaluate P(X<1) (iii) P[|X-1|<1]\n\nSolution:\n\n(i) X =f(x) = 1/(b-a) =1/(2-(-2)) = 1/4\n\nP(X>k) = 1 – P(X≤ k) = 1 – [Tex]\\int_{-2}^{k}f(x)dx [/Tex]\n\n= 1 – (1/4).[Tex]\\int_{-2}^{k}dx [/Tex] =1 – (k+2)/4 = 1/2\n\nBy solving we get k = 0\n\n(ii) P(X<1) = [Tex]\\int_{-2}^{1}f(x)dx [/Tex] =(1/4).

Each suite contains 13 cards of which 3 cards are face cards. The new deck is formed by excluding the number of cards. Then what is the probability of getting a heart card from the modified deck?\n\nSolution:\n\nIn the question, the given number of cards is finite so it is a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nFormula for the probability in discrete uniform distribution is P(X) = 1/n\n\nProbability of getting heart in the modified deck = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nQuestion 4: Using the uniform distribution probability density function for random variable X, in (0, 20), find P(3< X < 16).\n\nSolution:\n\nHere, a = 0, b =20\n\nf(x) = 1/(20 – 0) = 1/20\n\nP(3< X < 16) = (16 – 3) × (1/20) = 13/20\n\nQuestion 5: A random variable X has a uniform distribution over (-5 , 6), find cumulative distribution function for x = 3.\n\nSolution:\n\nHere, a = -5, b = 6, x = 3\n\nCDF = (3 – (-5))/(6 – (-5)) = 8/11\n\nUniform Distribution Formula – FAQs\n\nWhat is uniform distribution?\n\nUniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution where every possible outcome has an equal probability of occurring. In other words, the values within a given range are equally likely to be observed. The uniform distribution can be either continuous or discrete.\n\nWhat is continuous uniform distribution?\n\nContinuous uniform distribution is a probability distribution that assigns equal probability density to all outcomes within a specified interval. This means that any value within the interval has an equal chance of occurring. The probability density function (PDF) remains constant throughout the interval and is zero outside the interval. Examples include the standard uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1] and variations of this distribution over other intervals.\n\nWhat is discrete uniform distribution?\n\nDiscrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution where a finite number of outcomes exist, and each outcome has an equal probability of occurring. In essence, it’s a discrete version of the continuous uniform distribution. Examples include rolling a fair die, where each face has an equal probability of 1/6, or drawing a card from a standard deck, where each card has a probability of 1/52 if drawn randomly and without replacement.\n\nHow Do You Calculate the Mean of a Uniform Distribution?\n\nThe mean or expected value of a continuous uniform distribution is 2μ=2a+b​.\n\nHow Can You Identify a Uniform Distribution from a Graph?\n\nA uniform distribution graph is flat, indicating that each outcome within the specified range has an equal probability of occurring.\n\nWhat Are Some Examples of Uniform Distribution?\n\nExamples include rolling a fair die, where each outcome is equally likely, or randomly choosing a point along a stretch of road.\n\nCan Uniform Distribution Be Skewed?\n\nNo, by definition, uniform distributions are not skewed since each outcome within the range has the same likelihood.\n\nHow Is Uniform Distribution Used in Real Life?\n\nIt’s used in simulations, for creating random numbers in computer programs, and in quality control processes.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Discrete and Continuous Uniform Distributions?\n\nDiscrete uniform distributions apply to scenarios with a finite set of outcomes, while continuous uniform distributions apply to scenarios where any value within a continuous range is equally likely."
