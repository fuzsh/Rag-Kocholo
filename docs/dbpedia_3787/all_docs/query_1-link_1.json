        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn this article, we’ll look into Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), Distribution Functions and their different types, and how they’re used. We’ll break down the formulas, understand their characteristics, and make it easy to grasp how they help with data. This guide is here to simplify probability and statistics for better decision-making.\n\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n\nWhat is Probability Distribution Function?\n\nA Probability Distribution Function (PDF) is a mathematical way of showing how likely different outcomes are in a random event. It gives probabilities to each possible result, and when you add up all the probabilities, the total is always 1. The PDF helps us understand the chances of different outcomes in a random experiment.\n\nProbability distribution function formula?\n\nThe Probability Distribution Function (PDF) is often denoted as f(x), and its formula varies based on the specific probability distribution. Here are a few examples for commonly used distributions:\n\nContinuous Uniform Distribution:\n\nf(x)=b−a1​for a≤x≤b\n\nNormal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):\n\nf(x)=σ2π​1​⋅e−2σ2(x−μ)2​\n\nExponential Distribution:\n\nf(x)=λe−λxfor x≥0\n\nBinomial Distribution:\n\nf(x)=(xn​)⋅px⋅(1−p)n−xfor x=0,1,2,…,n\n\nHere,f(x) represents the probability density function,x is the variable, and the other symbols have specific meanings depending on the distribution. Note that these are just a few examples, and different probability distributions have different formulas.\n\nWhat is a distribution function?\n\nIn statistical terms, a distribution function is a mathematical expression that describes the probability of different possible outcomes for an experiment.\n\nIt is denoted as Variable ~ Type (Characteristics)\n\nLet us say we are running an experiment of tossing a fair coin. The possible events are Heads, Tails. And for instance, if we use X to denote the events, the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for X=heads, and 0.5 for X=tails.\n\nData Types\n\nAt a higher level, we have Qualitative and Quantitative data. And in Quantitative data, we have Continuous and Discrete data types.\n\nContinuous data is measured and can take any number of values in a given finite or infinite range. It can be represented in decimal format. And the random variable that holds continuous values is called the Continuous random variable.\n\nExamples: A person’s height, Time, distance, etc.\n\nDiscrete data is counted and can take only a limited number of values. It makes no sense when written in decimal format. And the random variable that holds discrete data is called the Discrete random variable.\n\nExample: The number of students in a class, number of workers in a company, etc.\n\nTypes of distribution functions:\n\nBased on the types of data we deal with, we have two types of distribution functions.\n\nFor discrete data, we have discrete distributions; and for continuous data, we have continuous distributions.\n\nBefore deep-diving into the types of distributions, it is important to revise the fundamental concepts like Probability Density Function (PDF), Probability Mass Function (PMF), and Cumulative Density Function (CDF).\n\nProbability Density Function (PDF):\n\nIt is a statistical term that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. The probability associate with a single value is always Zero. Below is the formula for PDF.\n\nThe formula for PDF.\n\nProbability Mass Function (PMF)\n\nIt is a statistical term that describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.\n\nThe formula for PMF.\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n\nIt is another method to describe the distribution of a random variable (either continuous or discrete).\n\nThe formula for CDF.\n\nDiscrete distributions\n\nLet us start with the easiest one – Uniform distribution.\n\nDiscrete Uniform distribution (U)\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ U (a, b). And is read as X is a discrete random variable that follows uniform distribution ranging from a to b.\n\nUniform distribution is when all the possible events are equally likely. For example, consider an experiment of rolling a dice. We have six possible events X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} each having a probability of P(X) = 1/6.\n\nThe PMF graph of the above experiment is:\n\nThe formula for PMF, CDF of Uniform distribution function are:\n\nThe Mean and Variance of Uniform distribution are:\n\nMean = (a+b)/2\n\nVariance = (n2-1)/12\n\nBinomial distribution (B):\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ B(n, p). And is read as X is a discrete random variable that follows Binomial distribution with parameters n, p.\n\nWhere n is the no. of trials, and p is the success probability for each trial.\n\nBinomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in ‘n’ independent experiments sequence. The two outcomes of a Binomial trial could be Success/Failure, Pass/Fail/, Win/Lose, etc.\n\nGenerally, the outcome success is denoted as 1, and the probability associated with it is p.\n\nAnd Failure is denoted as 0, and the probability associate with it is q = 1-p.\n\nThe formula for PMF, CDF of Binomial distribution are:\n\nK in the above formula is the number of successes.\n\nThe mean and variance of a binomial distribution are given as:\n\nMean = np\n\nVariance = npq\n\nNow consider, we ran a Binomial experiment 10 times, and the probability of success = 0.25. Below are how PMF, CDF looks.\n\nImage by Author\n\nPMF, CDF for a Binomial experiment with Probability of success = Probability of failure look like below.\n\nBernoulli distribution (Bern):\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ Bern(p). And is read as X is a discrete random variable that follows Bernoulli distribution with parameter p.\n\nWhere p is the probability of the success.\n\nBernoulli can be represented as a Binomial experiment with a single trial.\n\nX ~ Bern(p) —-> X ~ B(1, p)\n\nThe formula for PMF, CDF of Bernoulli distribution is:\n\nThe Mean and Variance of Bernoulli distribution are given as:\n\nMean = p\n\nVariance = p(1-p) = pq\n\nExample: Consider an example of tossing a fair. The two possible outcomes are Heads, Tails. The probability (p) associated with each of them is 1/2.\n\nIf we take an unfair coin, the probability associated with each of them need not be 1/2. Heads can have a probability of p = 0.8, then the probability of tail q = 1-p = 1-0.8 = 0.2\n\nBernoulli’s event suggests which outcome can be expected for a single trial. Whereas, a Binomial event suggests the no. of times a specific outcome can be expected.\n\nPoisson Distribution (Po):\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ Po(λ). And is read as X is a discrete random variable that follows Poisson Distribution with parameter λ.\n\nWhere λ is the expected rate of occurrences.\n\nPoisson Distribution is a discrete probability distribution function that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed time interval.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe number of diners at a restaurant on a given day.\n\nCalls per hour at a call centre.\n\nThe formula for PMF, CDF of poison distribution are:\n\nThe Mean and Variance of Poisson distribution are given as:\n\nMean = Variance = λ\n\nA Poisson distribution with λ = 5 look like below\n\nContinuous Distributions\n\nNormal or Gaussian Distribution (N)\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ N (μ, σ2). And is read as X is a continuous random variable that follows a Normal distribution with parameters μ, σ2.\n\nWhere μ is the mean, and σ2 is the variance. Mean, Variance together talks about shape statistics.\n\nA normal distribution is a continuous distribution that describes the probability of a continuous random variable that takes real values.\n\nExamples: Heights of people, exam scores of students, IQ Scores, etc follows Normal distribution.\n\nProperties of Normal distribution:\n\nThe random variable takes values from -∞ to +∞\n\nThe probability associate with any single value is Zero.\n\nlooks like a bell curve and is symmetric about x=μ. 50% of data lies on the left-hand side and 50% of the data lies on the right-hand side.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) = 1\n\nAll the measures of central tendency coincide i.e., mean = median = mode\n\nA normal distribution with different means, standard deviations look like below:\n\nNormal distribution follows the 68-95-99.7 rule. This rule is also known as the empirical rule. According to it, 68% of data lies in the first standard deviation range, 95% of data lies in the second standard deviation range, and 99.7% of data lies in the third standard deviation range.\n\nThe formula for PDF, CDF of the normal distribution are:\n\nThe Mean and Variance of a Normal distribution are given as:\n\nMean = μ\n\nVariance = σ2\n\nLet’s assume we have a height distribution with mean = 25, standard deviation = 2.48. Below is how the graph looks like.\n\nStandard Normal Distribution or SND:\n\nIt is denoted as Z ~ N(0, 1). And is read as X is a continuous random variable that follows Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.\n\nIt is a transformation of Normal distribution in such a way that Mean = 0, and standard deviation 1.\n\nTransformation is a way in which we alter every element of distribution to get a new distribution with similar characteristics.\n\nAll the properties of a Normal distribution will be satisfied by a Standard Normal distribution.\n\nAnd in addition, there exists a table that summarizes the most commonly used values of a CDF of s Standard Normal Distribution. This table is known as a Z-score table.\n\nThe formula for standardisation is Z = (X-μ)/σ\n\nThe formula for PDF, CDF of Standard Normal distribution are given as:\n\nThe Mean and Variance of Standard Normal distribution are:\n\nMean = 0\n\nVariance = 1\n\nNormal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (SND) looks like below:\n\nStudent’s T distribution or t-distribution (t)\n\nIt is denoted as X ~ t(k). And is read as X is a continuous random variable that follows Student’s T distribution with parameter k.\n\nwhere k is the degrees of freedom. If the sample size is n, then k = n-1.\n\nStudent’s T distribution is a small sample size approximation of a normal distribution. As the degrees of freedom increase, t distribution tends to become Standard Normal distribution.\n\nThe formula for PDF, CDF of t-distribution are:\n\n(v in above formulae is degrees of freedom)\n\nt-distribution can be used in Hypothesis testing (to test if there is any significant difference between two sample means), calculating confidence intervals with population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nLike standard normal distribution, t-distribution also has a table of its own. This table is known as the t-table.\n\nThe mean and variance of Student’s T distribution are:\n\nMean = 0\n\nvariance = k/(k-2)\n\nA student’s t-distribution with degrees of freedom = 25 looks like below:\n\nChi-Square distribution\n\nIt is denoted as X~χ2(k). And is read as X is a continuous random variable that follows Chi-Square distribution with k degrees of freedom.\n\nIt is used in Hypothesis testing, computing confidence intervals, and for the goodness of fit.\n\nIt is a transformation of t-distribution. Finding the t-distribution to the power of 2 gives Chi-Square distribution and finding the square root of Chi-Square of distribution gives us t-distribution.\n\nChi-Square distribution has a chi-square table.\n\nThe formula for PDF, CDF of Chi-square distribution are:\n\nSource\n\nThe mean and variance of Chi-square distribution are:\n\nMean = k\n\nVariance = 2k\n\nA Chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom = 5 looks like below.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) and their formulas and Distribution Functions are key for understanding different data types.
