        "text": "Lately, Apple Maps has been notifying me of speed traps and traffic hazzards (e.g. a vehicle stopped on or near the road, a hazard in the road, etc...), which is particularly handy... I'm not really worried about the speed traps thing - I maintain the unpopular opinion that if you choose to speed, then you deserve the fine (and yes, even I deliberately speed on occasion - though not very often) - but I do like the traffic hazard notifications.\n\nMy wife suggested Google Waze, which she uses... And having tried it out over the last week or so, I find it mostly works - but it's a Google product and like most of Google's products, privacy is an after-thought.\n\nSeeing as Apple Maps is already notifying me of speed traps and traffic hazards, is there a way for me to report these things to Apple (I personally won't be reporting speed traps - but I'll gladly report traffic hazards), so that other users can see them?\n\nI had a look around and some websites seem to think that you can do so via the \"pop up\" menu when navigating - but I had a play around with this on my iPhone XR (running iOS 14.4.2) and I could see no option to report speed traps / traffic hazards."
