Data and statistics may vary according to collection type and intended use. Traffic data submitted for Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) reporting is collected and reported according to federal requirements for Traffic Monitoring System and HPMS data collection, and may be calculated differently from other figures which are used to evaluate transportation system use. STARS II is a live production database. Historical data and statistics are considered final; however figures are subject to change.
