Did they read your email invitation? And much much more.\n\nTo open the distribution report click on Analyze and then on Distribution Report.\n\nYou can find the following charts and information here:\n\nResponse summary\n\nThe response summary gives a full overview of your survey. It provides data such as the survey start and end dates, the number of (partial) responses, how many contacts saw the email, how many clicked through, the number of respondents per distribution channel, etc.\n\nThis chart shows the ratio of respondents that filled out the survey via a desktop and those who filled it out via a mobile device.\n\nBoth smartphones and tablets are counted as mobile devices. Laptops are included in the number of desktop users.\n\nThis chart lists the websites that sent respondents to your survey. Especially handy when youâ€™ve posted the link on multiple websites and you wish to know which website has the most traffic.\n\nAdditionally you can add query string parameters to the survey URL to add this information to the reports as well.\n\nWhere are your respondents located? Find out at a single glance using the location report. The darker blue a region on the map, the more respondents came from this area.\n\nZoom in on a specific area to see the ratio per city within a specific region.\n\nHover over an area to find out the exact number of respondents for that specific country or city.\n\nDownload\n\nYou can download the entire report as a PDF file. Or you can download each chart or overview separately.\n\nTo download the entire report click on Download in the top right corner.\n\nTo download a separate chart or overview as an image click on in the top right corner of that particular chart."
