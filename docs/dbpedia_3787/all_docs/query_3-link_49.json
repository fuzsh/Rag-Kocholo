This data supports all aspects of highway planning, design, operations, and maintenance including safety considerations in all phases.\n\nFor current and historic traffic data visit our Traffic Data Management System (TDMS)\n\nThis web-based interactive map allows users to customize searches, and directly view and download traffic count data.\n\nOnce a station is selected, click on \"View Detail\" to change the left side of the screen to show all records associated with that count station.\n\nThe various report types can be generated by clicking the \"eyeball\" icon to the left side of the study dates.\n\nTDMS Traffic Viewer for Mobile Devices\n\nContact Traffic Research for more information.\n\nReturn to Bureau of Traffic Main Page\n\nNOTICE: Due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic, travel characteristics have not followed a predictable pattern. Because of this, the monthly adjustment (seasonal adjustment) data and change rate (growth rate) data are only available through the year 2019. We are continuing to monitor travel characteristics as cultural shifts normalize. Once a predictable travel pattern is reestablished in the data, new monthly adjustment and change rate data can be published. The soonest we expect this to occur is late spring of 2024."
