        "text": "Traffic Monitoring is responsible for programming, collecting, analyzing and reporting traffic monitoring data for FHWA’s Functional Classes 1 thru 6 urban in New Mexico. We are also participating in a pilot project to estimate Functional Classes 6 rural and 7. NMDOT collects traffic data internally, by contract, and in partnership with local entities in New Mexico. The Traffic Monitoring Program is responsible for ensuring all traffic counts collected and shared with NMDOT meet our quality standards. Traffic monitoring data includes vehicle volume, vehicle classification, vehicle speed and vehicle weight. Data is collected using manual counts, portable counters (road tube and radar) and permanent counters (Continuous Count Stations (CCS) and Weigh-in Motion (WIM) stations).\n\nNMDOT uses MS2 to store all its traffic monitoring data. The web-based interactive software is available to the general public and is a helpful tool for viewing and downloading traffic count data including traffic volume, vehicle classification, vehicles speeds and vehicle weights.
