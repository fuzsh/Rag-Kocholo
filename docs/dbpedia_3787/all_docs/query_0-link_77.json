You optionally can include conversion metrics. By default, the data includes the estimated number of clicks for each ad group/campaign/portfolio combination for each region that generated clicks, and the rows are in descending order by estimated clicks.\n\nEstimated impressions and estimated cost are available only for display tracking-only campaigns.\n\nYou can view data for the previous two (2) months plus the current month."
