        "text": "Primary table and baseline table\n\nIn addition to the table to be monitored, called the âprimary tableâ, you can optionally specify a baseline table to use as a reference for measuring drift, or the change in values over time. A baseline table is useful when you have a sample of what you expect your data to look like. The idea is that drift is then computed relative to expected data values and distributions.\n\nThe baseline table should contain a dataset that reflects the expected quality of the input data, in terms of statistical distributions, individual column distributions, missing values, and other characteristics. It should match the schema of the monitored table. The exception is the timestamp column for tables used with time series or inference profiles. If columns are missing in either the primary table or the baseline table, monitoring uses best-effort heuristics to compute the output metrics.\n\nFor monitors that use a snapshot profile, the baseline table should contain a snapshot of the data where the distribution represents an acceptable quality standard. For example, on grade distribution data, one might set the baseline to a previous class where grades were distributed evenly.\n\nFor monitors that use a time series profile, the baseline table should contain data that represents time window(s) where data distributions represent an acceptable quality standard. For example, on weather data, you might set the baseline to a week, month, or year where the temperature was close to expected normal temperatures."
