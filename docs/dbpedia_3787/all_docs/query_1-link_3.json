Thank you for your feedback!\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nAttention: If you are a Brand Administrator and are interested in reporting on distributions in CX Dashboards, you can contact your XM Success Manager to learn more about what features are available to you.\n\nAttention: The XM Directory Respondent Funnel can accomplish the same analysis as distribution reporting with an easier setup. After August 31, 2022 users will not be able to add new data sources or create new dashboard pages from the Directory Respondent page template. Additionally, we are currently not enabling distribution reporting for any new customers at this time. Reach out to your Account Executive or XM Success Manager to learn more.\n\nAbout Distribution Reporting\n\nDistribution reporting enables users to report on response and completion rates over one or more surveys using any CX Dashboards widget. Additionally, the feature allows data from distributions to be filtered by embedded data stored in the contact list.\n\nQtip: If you have also purchased access to the Salesforce Extension, you can report on your Salesforce distributions with distribution reporting. This includes Salesforce emails triggered in the Tools and in the Workflows tab.\n\nQtip: Distribution data is only accessible for email distributions that are sent after you’ve set up distribution reporting.\n\nAttention: Distribution reporting will not pull in distributions that were sent via automations.\n\nSetting Up Distribution Reporting\n\nThe distribution fieldset must be mapped before a dashboard can utilize distribution reporting.\n\nNavigate to the dashboard settings.\n\nIn the Dashboard Data page, click on Add Source, hover over Distributions, and select the survey that contains the distribution on which you want to report.\n\nIf the distribution source is the first source added to the dashboard, it will automatically add 12 fields to the data mapping. If there is already a survey mapped alongside the new distribution source, you will need to manually add the following fields.\n\nManually Adding Distribution Data\n\nAdd at least five new fields by clicking Add Field in the bottom left corner. Required fields with their corresponding field types include:\n\nSend Date (Date): The date that the distribution sent.\n\nSurvey Started (Number Set): The number of surveys responses that were started by clicking the survey link.\n\nSurvey Started Date (Date): The date a survey response started.\n\nSurvey Completed (Number Set): The number of completed survey responses that have been recorded. This does not include recorded incomplete responses.\n\nSurvey Completed Date (Date): The date that a survey response was recorded.\n\nLocate the grey boxes that say Not Mapped under the distribution source. Click on a box associated with one of the newly added fields.\n\nSelect the corresponding distribution field from the Fields If not all fields appear, click Show All at the bottom of the menu.\n\nQtip: In addition to the five required fields, distribution reporting has 11 additional fields on which you can report: Survey ID, Distribution ID, Distribution Channel, Recipient ID, Address, First Name, Last Name, Bounced, Bounce Type, Opened, and Open Date.\n\nAdding Embedded Data\n\nQtip: When mapping fields using embedded data, remember that special characters such as period (.) and hashtag (#) are unsupported. See Best Practices and Troubleshooting Embedded Data for more tips on setting embedded data values.\n\nYou can also add embedded data that is stored in the contact list associated with your distributions.\n\nClick on Add Field.\n\nClick on Not Mapped.\n\nClick on Add Embedded Data.\n\nIn the popup that appears, type in the name of the embedded data field exactly as it appears in your contact list.\n\nClick Save.\n\nDistribution Reporting Fields\n\nBy default, there are 18 fields you can map. Each field’s meaning is listed with what field type you should map it as.\n\nAddress: Text Value. Email addresses of the contacts who received the email.\n\nBounce Type: When an email bounces, there are two types of bounce.\n\nQtip: Hard and Soft bounces are meant to serve as estimates to get you started troubleshooting. They are reliant on signals sent by the recipient server, and are therefore only as precise as the message sent to Qualtrics.\n\nHard: The email or its domain doesn’t exist.\n\nSoft: The mailbox is full, the message is too large, or the server you sent the distribution to is down.\n\nEmpty: Emails that did not bounce.\n\nBounced: Number Set. How many emails bounced.\n\nDistribution ID: Text Value. The internal ID of the distribution you just mapped.\n\nDistribution Channel: Text Set. How the distribution was sent. For example, email or SMS.\n\nDistribution Type: Text Set. Includes invite, interactive, and SF Trigger (Salesforce trigger).\n\nExternal Data Reference: This element allows you to see the External Data Reference field from the contact list. This can be useful if the contact list has been deleted.\n\nFirst Name: Text Value. First names of the contacts who received the email.\n\nLast Name: Text Value. Last names of the contacts who received the email.\n\nOpened: Number Set. Whether an email was opened (1) or not (0).\n\nQtip: Qualtrics uses a pixel embedded in the email to gauge when an email is opened. When the pixel is loaded, the email is marked as opened. The number of opened emails is approximate as it relies on the recipient’s email server automatically loading the pixel.\n\nOpen Date: Date. When the email was opened.\n\nRecipient ID: Text Value. The internal IDs of the contacts who received the email.\n\nSend Date: Date. The date that the distribution sent.\n\nSurvey Completed: Number Set. The number of survey responses that have been recorded. This does not include recorded incomplete responses or manually closed responses in progress.\n\nSurvey Completed Date (Date): The date that a survey response was recorded.\n\nSurvey ID: Text Value. The internal ID of the survey the distribution was sent out for.\n\nSurvey Started: Number Set. The number of surveys responses that were started by clicking the survey link.\n\nSurvey Started Date: Date. The date a survey response started.\n\nAttention: Response rate and completion rate are not included as default fields. In order to add add these to your dashboard, follow the instructions in the next section!\n\nDistribution Channel\n\nDistribution Channel used to be called Distribution Type. If you are still seeing the wrong name with the wrong information on your dashboard and would like to change it, modify the field name in the data mapper.\n\nBounce Type & Distribution Type\n\nIf you do not have Bounce Type or Distribution Type in your dashboard, you will need to add a field. You may need to click Show All before they appear as an option. Set these fields to Text Set.\n\nResponse Rate & Completion Rate\n\nQtip: Response rate is calculated differently for the XM Respondent Funnel. See the XM Respondent Funnel page for details.\n\nBefore you can report on response rate and completion rate in your dashboard, you will need to add two custom metrics.\n\nIn the dashboard settings, click on the Custom metrics page.\n\nClick Add custom metric.\n\nCall it “Response Rate.”\n\nAdd the following equation: (Count) / (Count).\n\nClick the numerator.\n\nGo to the Filters section.\n\nClick Add Filter.\n\nHover over Text and select Survey Started.\n\nEdit the filter to only include responses with a value of “Survey Started.”\n\nClick Save.\n\nSimilarly, create a second custom metric and call it “Completion Rate.”\n\nAdd the following equation: (Count) / (Count).\n\nClick the numerator.\n\nGo to the Filters section.\n\nClick Add Filter.\n\nHover over Text and select Survey Completed.\n\nEdit the filter so it only includes responses with “Complete” status.\n\nClick Save.\n\nFilter the denominator so it includes only responses where “Survey Started.”\n\nClick Save.\n\nAttention: Responses will only be recorded as “Survey Completed” if their progress is 100%.\n\nAttention: If you are reporting on distributions and surveys in the same dashboard, you will need to add a filter for “Data Set Source” at the widget or page level to distinguish between distributions from different surveys.\n\nReporting on Distributions\n\nQtip: Don’t want to set up distribution reporting all by yourself? Check out our distribution page templates!\n\nNow that you have your fields mapped, you can add them to widgets like any other field!\n\nQtip: For the fields Survey Started, Survey Completed, Opened, and Bounced, values will be either 0 or 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true. You can recode these fields as Text Sets and set the recode values to plain text to make your dashboard easier to understand.\n\nDistribution Methods Available for Distribution Reporting\n\nWhen analyzing your distribution reporting data, you may notice slight differences between the data displayed in your dashboard and other similar features in Qualtrics, such as the distribution statistics available for survey email invitations. These differences occur because of how distribution events are recorded in the various parts of the Qualtrics platform. For distribution reporting in CX Dashboards, responses will only appear when the response has both an associated Distribution ID and Recipient ID. This means the response has an identifiable contact it can be linked to as well as a unique distribution event in Qualtrics. Below is a table of each distribution method in Qualtrics and if their responses are available in distribution reporting.\n\nDistribution Method Available in Distribution Reporting? Email Invitation with Individual Link Yes Email Reminder with Individual Link No Email Invitation/Reminder with Anonymous Link No Email Invitation/Reminder with Multiple Completes Link No Personal Links No Marketo Distributions No SMS Invitations Yes 2-Way SMS Surveys Sent to a Contact List Yes SMS Access Codes No Anonymous Survey Link No QR Codes No Social Media Distributions No\n\nReporting Response Rates and Completion Rates as Percentages\n\nWhen creating the response rate and completion rate custom metrics, these fields are generally reported as an exact number. However, you can report these values as percentages with just a few simple steps.\n\nCreate a number chart widget.\n\nClick Add Metric.\n\nSelect Count.\n\nChange the Metric to “Response Rate” or “Completion Rate.”\n\nClick Options.\n\nChange the Format to Percent.\n\nFAQ\n\n'>\n\nOnce you have emailed survey invitations through Qualtrics, you will see a block with your distribution information and actions you can perform on them. Here you can view your distribution details, send Reminder and Thank You emails, cancel or delete distributions, and download the distribution history. These different options allow you to manage your email distribution and monitor progress.\n\nSelect the Distributions tab to:\n\nQualtrics is deprecating Distribution Reporting to replace it with the XM Directory Respondent Funnel. Respondent Funnel is easier to set up, supports more contact fields, and is designed to be more reliable and scalable by allowing XM Directory metrics, transactional data, Embedded Data, and even automation run status to be uploaded into CX Dashboards for transparency with all your key stakeholders.\n\nResponse Mapping is used to take the answers provided in a Qualtrics survey and map them back to a Salesforce record. For example, when your client takes a support feedback survey, their satisfaction level could be mapped back to Salesforce for the account manager to see.\n\nThe Extract Data from Salesforce task imports data from your Salesforce instance to use in Qualtrics. On the first run the task will import all object records, and on subsequent runs it will pull in new or updated records since the last run. Once the data is imported into Qualtrics, use a data loader task to save the data in your desired area on the platform.\n\nYou can set up notifications for when a workflow fails. For scheduled workflows, you can also set up a notification for when the workflow succeeds."
