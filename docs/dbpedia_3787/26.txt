Response summary

The response summary gives a full overview of your survey. It provides data such as the survey start and end dates, the number of (partial) responses, how many contacts saw the email, how many clicked through, the number of respondents per distribution channel, etc.

This chart shows the ratio of respondents that filled out the survey via a desktop and those who filled it out via a mobile device.

Both smartphones and tablets are counted as mobile devices. Laptops are included in the number of desktop users.

This chart lists the websites that sent respondents to your survey. Especially handy when youâ€™ve posted the link on multiple websites and you wish to know which website has the most traffic.

Additionally you can add query string parameters to the survey URL to add this information to the reports as well.

Where are your respondents located? Find out at a single glance using the location report. The darker blue a region on the map, the more respondents came from this area.

Zoom in on a specific area to see the ratio per city within a specific region.
