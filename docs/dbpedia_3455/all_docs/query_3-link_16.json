Application of S-S-E.ram-0997-a-A-18 to fecal samples from 20 subjects indicated the presence of E. ramulus in each individual tested in numbers from 4.4 Ã 107 to 2.0 Ã 109 cells/g of fecal dry mass. Six fecal E. ramulus isolates were recognized by S-S-E.ram-0997-a-A-18 but exhibited different band patterns when analyzed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA.

The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by screening a gene library for hydrolase activity. The insert of a clone conferring phloretin hydrolase activity was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 822 bp (phy), a putative promoter region, and a terminating stem-loop structure. The deduced amino acid sequence of phy showed similarities to a putative protein of the 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic operon from Pseudomonas fluorescens. The phloretin hydrolase was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 55 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence of phy indicated molecular masses of 30 and 30.8 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The recombinant phloretin hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of phloretin to equimolar amounts of phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. The optimal temperature and pH of the catalyzed reaction mixture were 37Â°C and 7.0, respectively. The Km for phloretin was 13 Â± 3 Î¼M and the kcat was 10 Â± 2 sâ1. The enzyme did not transform phloretin-2â²-glucoside (phloridzin), neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propandione, or trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxy-propan-1-one. The catalytic activity of the phloretin hydrolase was reduced by N-bromosuccinimide, o-phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, and CuCl2 to 3, 20, 35, and 85%, respectively. Phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid reduced the activity to 54 and 70%, respectively.

The change in the mixed decoction was discussed to study the relationship between herba ephedra and ramulus cinnarnomi after decoction. The results showed that some components of herba ephedra and ramulus cinnarnomi were retained in the mixed decoction of herba ephedra + ramulus cinnarnomi, such as 1 205 and 1 074 cm(-1), but some components that never appeared in the two component spectra increased, such as 1 394 and 678 cm(-1). New absorption peaks were generated in the mixed decoction of herba ephedra + ramulus cinnarnomi, such as 757 and 407 cm(-1). It can be showed that there are differences in the chemistry environment of the various chemical groups in the three decoctions introduced above, and with the variation in absorption peak position, possibly some new chemical compositions were created. Medical ingredients in the decoction are not simply the addition of herba ephedra and ramulus cinnarnomi based on the studies of infrared spectrum of the mixed decoction of herba ephedra + ramulus cinnarnomi, and the new notion of prescription spectroscopy was proposed.\n\nThe heterocyclic ring fission and dehydroxylation of catechins and related compounds by Eubacterium sp. strain SDG-2, a human intestinal bacterium.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, L Q; Meselhy, M R; Li, Y; Nakamura, N; Min, B S; Qin, G W; Hattori, M\n\n2001-12-01\n\nA human intestinal bacterium, Eubacterium (E.) sp. strain SDG-2, was tested for its ability to metabolize various (3R)- and (3S)-flavan-3-ols and their 3-O-gallates. This bacterium cleaved the C-ring of (3R)- and (3S)-flavan-3-ols to give 1,3-diphenylpropan-2-ol derivatives, but not their 3-O-gallates. Furthermore, E. sp. strain SDG-2 had the ability of p-dehydroxylation in the B-ring of (3R)-flavan-3-ols, such as (-)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-gallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin, but not of (3S)-flavan-3-ols, such as (+)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin.\n\nEubacterium callanderi Bacteremia: Report of the First Case\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThiolas, AurÃ©lie; Bollet, Claude; Gasmi, Mohammed; Drancourt, Michel; Raoult, Didier\n\n2003-01-01\n\nEubacterium callanderi is an environmental anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium first isolated in 1998 from an industrial anaerobic digester. We report on the first clinical isolate of E. callanderi, which was recovered from the blood of a patient with a bladder carcinoma. Identification of the organism was made by cell fatty acid chromatographic analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. PMID:12734289\n\nComplete genome sequence of a carbon monoxide-utilizing acetogen, Eubacterium limosum KIST612.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoh, Hanseong; Ko, Hyeok-Jin; Kim, Daehee; Choi, Dong Geon; Park, Shinyoung; Kim, Sujin; Chang, In Seop; Choi, In-Geol\n\n2011-01-01\n\nEubacterium limosum KIST612 is an anaerobic acetogenic bacterium that uses CO as the sole carbon/energy source and produces acetate, butyrate, and ethanol. To evaluate its potential as a syngas microbial catalyst, we have sequenced the complete 4.3-Mb genome of E. limosum KIST612.\n\nEubacterium rangiferina, a novel usnic acid-resistant bacterium from the reindeer rumen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSundset, Monica A.; Kohn, Alexandra; Mathiesen, Svein D.; PrÃ¦steng, Kirsti E.\n\n2008-08-01\n\nReindeer are able to eat and utilize lichens as an important source of energy and nutrients. In the current study, the activities of antibiotic secondary metabolites including usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid commonly found in lichens were tested against a collection of 26 anaerobic rumen bacterial isolates from reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus tarandus) using the agar diffusion method. The isolates were identified based on their 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequences. Usnic acid had a potent antimicrobial effect against 25 of the isolates, belonging to Clostridiales, Enterococci, and Streptococci. Isolates of Clostridia and Streptococci were also susceptible to atranoric and lobaric acid. However, one isolate (R3_91_1) was found to be resistant to usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid. R3_91_1 was also seen invading and adhering to lichen particles when grown in a liquid anaerobic culture as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. This was a Gram-negative, nonmotile rod (0.2-0.7 Ã 2.0-3.5 Î¼m) with a deoxyribonucleic acid G + C content of 47.0 mol% and main cellular fatty acids including 15:0 anteiso-dimethyl acetal (DMA), 16:0 iso-fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), 13:0 iso-3OH FAME, and 17:0 anteiso-FAME, not matching any of the presently known profiles in the MIDI database. Combined, the phenotypic and genotypic traits including the 16S rRNA gene sequence show that R3_91_1 is a novel species inside the order Clostridiales within the family Lachnospiraceae, for which we propose the name Eubacterium rangiferina. This is the first record of a rumen bacterium able to tolerate and grow in the presence of usnic acid, indicating that the rumen microorganisms in these animals have adapted mechanisms to deal with lichen secondary metabolites, well known for their antimicrobial and toxic effects.\n\nCharacteristics and sites of infection of Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium timidum, Eubacterium brachy, and other asaccharolytic eubacteria.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHill, G B; Ayers, O M; Kohan, A P\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThree new species, Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium timidum, and Eubacterium brachy, were described, primarily from subgingival samples taken from patients with moderate and severe adult periodontitis. Except for the isolation of E. brachy from a pleuropulmonary infection, these species have not been reported from other infected body sites. We report on the isolation of these species and an undescribed group (D-6) of asaccharolytic eubacteria also found in periodontal disease from numerous different sites of infection, mostly the head and neck. A similarity in cellular morphological properties of E. nodatum and Actinomyces sp. was noted previously. Additional similarities, particularly to Actinomyces israelii, that we found are the formation of molar tooth colonies and the isolation from cases of lumpy jaw and from the genital tract of women in association with the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device. E. timidum and E. brachy did not occur more often from any particular site outside of the head, neck, and respiratory tract. The group D-6 strains came from a variety of sites in the trunk and pelvis. These species are all obligately anaerobic, asaccharolytic, and generally nonreactive, and they grow poorly and slowly on media commonly used to isolate anaerobic bacteria. L-Lysine (0.5%) markedly stimulated the growth of E. nodatum and, to a lesser extent, another acetate- and butyrate-producing group, Eubacterium sp. group D-6, but we did not find comparable stimulants for the other species. We found the production of phenyl acetate to be a helpful marker in the identification of E. timidum and Eubacterium sp. group D-6. Although the isolation and identification of most of these species remain somewhat difficult, the evidence from dental infections and the present report suggests that these species are potential pathogens that are likely to be overlooked in infected clinical material without special attention to more prolonged incubation and use of enriched\n\nBiochemical characterization of cholesterol-reducing Eubacterium.\n\nPubMed\n\nMott, G E; Brinkley, A W; Mersinger, C L\n\n1980-12-01\n\nWe characterized two isolates of cholesterol-reducing Eubacterium by conducting conventional biochemical tests and by testing various sterols and glycerolipids as potential growth factors. In media containing cholesterol and plasmenylethanolamine, the tests for nitrate reduction, indole production, and gelatin and starch hydrolyses were negative, and no acid was produced from any of 22 carbohydrates. Both isolates hydrolyzed esculin to esculetin, indicating beta-glycosidase activity. In addition to plasmenylethanolamine, five other lipids which contain an alkenyl ether residue supported growth of Eubacterium strain 403 in a lecithin-cholesterol base medium. Of six steroids tested, cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, cholest-4-en-3 beta-ol (allocholesterol), and androst-5-en-3 beta-ol-17-one supported growth of Eubacterium strain 403. All four steroids were reduced to the 3 beta-ol, 5 beta-H products. The delta 5 steroids cholest-5-en-3 alpha-ol (epicholesterol) and 22,23-bisnor-5-cholenic acid-3-beta-ol were not reduced and did not support growth of the Eubacterium strain.\n\nAn unclassified Eubacterium taxon in acute dento-alveolar abscess.\n\nPubMed\n\nWade, W G; Lewis, M A; Cheeseman, S L; Absi, E G; Bishop, P A\n\n1994-02-01\n\nThe microflora of pus samples aspirated from 50 acute dento-alveolar abscesses was examined. A total of 143 bacterial strains was isolated, consisting predominantly of Prevotella spp., alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp. An unclassified asaccharolytic Eubacterium taxon was encountered in 17 (34%) of the abscesses. This taxon was found to have a positive association with Fusobacterium spp. and a negative association with alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus spp.\n\nMultiple copies of a bile acid-inducible gene in Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGopal-Srivastava, R; Mallonee, D H; White, W B; Hylemon, P B\n\n1990-01-01\n\nEubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 is an anaerobic intestinal bacterium which possesses inducible bile acid 7-dehydroxylation activity. Several new polypeptides are produced in this strain following induction with cholic acid. Genes coding for two copies of a bile acid-inducible 27,000-dalton polypeptide (baiA1 and baiA2) have been previously cloned and sequenced. We now report on a gene coding for a third copy of this 27,000-dalton polypeptide (baiA3). The baiA3 gene has been cloned in lambda DASH on an 11.2-kilobase DNA fragment from a partial Sau3A digest of the Eubacterium DNA. DNA sequence analysis of the baiA3 gene revealed 100% homology with the baiA1 gene within the coding region of the 27,000-dalton polypeptides. The baiA2 gene shares 81% sequence identity with the other two genes at the nucleotide level. The flanking nucleotide sequences associated with the baiA1 and baiA3 genes are identical for 930 bases in the 5' direction from the initiation codon and for at least 325 bases in the 3' direction from the stop codon, including the putative promoter regions for the genes. An additional open reading frame (occupying from 621 to 648 bases, depending on the correct start codon) was found in the identical 5' regions associated with the baiA1 and baiA3 clones. The 5' sequence 930 bases upstream from the baiA1 and baiA3 genes was totally divergent. The baiA2 gene, which is part of a large bile acid-inducible operon, showed no homology with the other two genes either in the 5' or 3' direction from the polypeptide coding region, except for a 15-base-pair presumed ribosome-binding site in the 5' region. These studies strongly suggest that a gene duplication (baiA1 and baiA3) has occurred and is stably maintained in this bacterium.

Three species of Eggerthella lenta, Eubacterium rectale, and Eubacterium eligens were detected from seven fecal samples. Eubacterium biforme was detected from six samples. It was reported that E. rectale, E. eligens, and E. biforme were difficult to detect by traditional culture method, but the nested PCR method is available for the detection of these species. This result shows that the nested PCR method utilizing a universal primer pair, followed by amplification with species-specific primers, would allow rapid detection of Eubacterium species in human feces.\n\nCharacterization of Eubacterium coprostanoligenes sp. nov., a cholesterol-reducing anaerobe.\n\nPubMed\n\nFreier, T A; Beitz, D C; Li, L; Hartman, P A\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA small, anaerobic, gram-positive coccobacillus that reduces cholesterol to coprostanol was isolated from a hog sewage lagoon. This isolate, strain HLT (T = type strain) does not require cholesterol for growth, but it requires lecithin and has phospholipase activity. Much acid is produced by the fermentation of amygdalin, lactose, and salicin. Arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, glucose, mannose, and melibiose are fermented weakly. Acetic, formic, and succinic acids are produced, as is hydrogen. The isolate does not reduce nitrate, produce indole, or hydrolyze starch and gelatin. Esculin is hydrolyzed. The properties of strain HLT are most similar to those of members of the genus Eubacterium. Because strain HL (= ATCC 51222) has unique morphological and physiological properties, we propose that it should be the type strain of a new species in the genus Eubacterium, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes.\n\nMolecular characterization of the presence of Eubacterium spp and Streptococcus spp in endodontic infections.\n\nPubMed\n\nFouad, A F; Kum, K-Y; Clawson, M L; Barry, J; Abenoja, C; Zhu, Q; Caimano, M; Radolf, J D\n\n2003-08-01\n\nEubacterium spp. and Streptococcus spp. are virulent, commonly identified microorganisms in endodontic infections. The purpose of this study was to use molecular methods to identify these organisms in 22 infected root canals that include eight cases with preoperative clinical symptoms and five cases with a history of diabetes mellitus. The presence of Streptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp. was examined using two sets of PCR primers specific with multiple species within the respective genera. Positive specimens had their PCR products sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed to identify the specific species. Sixteen specimens (73%) contained Eubacterium spp. and nine (41%) were positive for Streptococcus spp. Eubacterium infirmum was the most prevalent Eubacterium sp. This organism was significantly associated with a history of diabetes (OR = 9.6; P = 0.04). Streptococcus anginosus was the most common Streptococcus sp., but neither it nor any of the other streptococci were significantly associated with the clinical parameters evaluated.\n\nCellular fatty acids and aldehydes of oral Eubacterium.\n\nPubMed\n\nItoh, U; Sato, M; Tsuchiya, H; Namikawa, I\n\n1995-02-01\n\nThe cellular fatty acids and aldehydes of oral Eubacterium species were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. E. brachy and E. lentum contained mainly branched-chain fatty acids, whereas the others contained straight-chain acids. E. brachy, E. lentum, E. yurii ssp. yurii, E. yurii spp. margaretiae, E. limosum, E. plauti and E. aerofaciens also contained aldehydes with even carbon numbers. In addition to species-specific components, the compositional ratios of fatty acids and aldehydes characterized each individual species. The 10 species tested were divided into 5 groups by the principal component analysis. Cellular fatty acids and aldehydes would be chemical markers for interspecies differentiation of oral Eubacterium.\n\nAnaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwiertz, Andreas; Hold, Georgina L; Duncan, Sylvia H; Gruhl, Barbel; Collins, Matthew D; Lawson, Paul A; Flint, Harry J; Blaut, Michael\n\n2002-04-01\n\nTwo strains of a previously undescribed Eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated from human faeces. The strains are Gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. The two isolates displayed 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from Eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the Clostridium coccoides group of organisms. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, Anaerostipes caccae. The type strain of Anaerostipes caccae is NCIMB 13811T (= DSM 14662T).\n\nComparison of different methods for extraction of Cinnamomi ramulus: yield, chemical composition and in vitro antiviral activities.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Jing; Yuan, Xiurong; Li, Ling; Zhang, Tong; Wang, Bing\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHydrodistillation (HD), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and reflux extraction (RE) were applied to obtain Cinnamomi ramulus extracts. The yields, chemical compositions and antiviral activities of the extracts were investigated. Extracts were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the antiviral activities were evaluated using cytopathic effect inhibition assay. HD, SFE and RE afforded 0.376, 1.227 and 5.914% yields, respectively. Cinnamaldehyde (CA), SFE and ethanol extracts exhibited antiviral activities against herpes simplex virus type 1. Moreover, CA and other three extracts had inhibition efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus. The most efficient antiviral activities were obtained with SFE.\n\nIdentification and discrimination of oral asaccharolytic Eubacterium spp. by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and artificial neural networks.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoodacre, R; Hiom, S J; Cheeseman, S L; Murdoch, D; Weightman, A J; Wade, W G\n\n1996-02-01\n\nCurie-point pyrolysis mass spectra were obtained from 29 oral asaccharolytic Eubacterium strains and 6 abscess isolates previously identified as Peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PyMS) with cluster analysis was able to clarify the taxonomic position of this group of organisms. Artificial neural networks (ANNS) were then trained by supervised learning (with the back-propagation algorithm) to recognize the strains from their pyrolysis mass spectra; all Eubacterium strains were correctly identified, and the abscess isolates were identified as un-named Eubacterium taxon C2 and were distinct from the type strain of P. heliotrinreducens. These results demonstrate that the combination of PyMS and ANNs provides a rapid and accurate identification technique.\n\nUV red fluorescence of Eubacterium lentum.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMosca, A; Strong, C A; Finegold, S M\n\n1993-01-01\n\nTwenty-nine clinical isolates of Eubacterium lentum and two type species were evaluated for the ability to fluoresce under UV light. Twenty-one of the 29 isolates and both of the reference strains showed orange-to-red fluorescence. This fluorescence did not require blood or hemin in the culture media and did not fade upon air exposure. The fluorescent pigment, after extraction by 1 N NaOH, showed peak excitation at a wavelength of around 400 nm. The capacity of E. lentum to produce fluorescence may be a useful and time-sparing laboratory aid for its identification.

It was the first time to study the pharmacokinetics of 2-methoxy cinnamic acid in rat whole blood. Samples were processed by a one-step protein precipitation with acetonitrile-37% formaldehyde (90:10, v:v). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Thermo Scientific C18 column (2.1mmÃ50mm, 1.9Î¼m) at room temperature. The total run time was 4min. The detection was accomplished by using positive and negative ion electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method was linear for all of the analytes over 1000 times concentration range with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were 0.1ng/mL for cinnamaldehyde, 5.8ng/mL for cinnamic acid, and 10ng/mL for 2-methoxy cinnamic acid, respectively. To our knowledge, this was the first time that the LLOQ for cinnamaldehyde in validated methods for biological samples was as low as 0.1ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were within Â±9% for all of the analytes during the assay validation. Assay recoveries were higher than 80% and the matrix effects were minimal. The half-life were 8.7Â±0.7h for cinnamaldehyde, 1.0Â±0.5h for cinnamic acid, and 1.4Â±0.4h for 2-methoxy cinnamic acid, respectively. The validated assay was firstly applied to the simultaneous quantification of cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and 2-methoxy cinnamic acid, especially for 2-methoxy cinnamic acid in rat whole blood after oral administration of 15mg/kg essential oil of Cinnamoni Ramulus. It was observed that the Cmax and AUC of 2-methoxy cinnamic acid (0.01% in essential oil of Cinnamoni Ramulus) were greater than those of cinnamaldehyde (83.49% in essential oil of Cinnamoni Ramulus), which implied that 2-methoxy cinnamic acid might\n\nMolecular details of a starch utilization pathway in the human gut symbiont Eubacterium rectale\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCockburn, Darrell W.; Orlovsky, Nicole I.; Foley, Matthew H.; Kwiatkowski, Kurt J.; Bahr, Constance M.; Maynard, Mallory; Demeler, Borries; Koropatkin, Nicole M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSummary Eubacterium rectale is a prominent human gut symbiont yet little is known about the molecular strategies this bacterium has developed to acquire nutrients within the competitive gut ecosystem. Starch is one of the most abundant glycans in the human diet, and E. rectale increases in vivo when the host consumes a diet rich in resistant starch, although it is not a primary degrader of this glycan. Here we present the results of a quantitative proteomics study in which we identify two glycoside hydrolase 13 family enzymes, and three ABC transporter solute-binding proteins that are abundant during growth on starch and, we hypothesize, work together at the cell surface to degrade starch and capture the released maltooligosaccharides. EUR_21100 is a multidomain cell wall anchored amylase that preferentially targets starch polysaccharides, liberating maltotetraose, while the membrane associated maltogenic amylase EUR_01860 breaks down maltooligosaccharides longer than maltotriose. The three solute-binding proteins display a range of glycan-binding specificities that ensure the capture of glucose through maltoheptaose and some Î±1,6-branched glycans. Taken together, we describe a pathway for starch utilization by E. rectale DSM 17629 that may be conserved among other starch-degrading Clostridium cluster XIVa organisms in the human gut. PMID:25388295\n\nInfluence of resistant starch on the SCFA production and cell counts of butyrate-producing Eubacterium spp. in the human intestine.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwiertz, A; Lehmann, U; Jacobasch, G; Blaut, M\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe genus Eubacterium, which is the second most common genus in the human intestine, includes several known butyrate producers. We hypothesized that Eubacterium species play a role in the intestinal butyrate production and are inducible by resistant starch. In a human pilot study species-specific and group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted, Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labelled oligonucleotide probes were used to quantify butyrogenic species of the genera Eubacterium, Clostridium and Ruminococcus. Following the intake of RS type III a significant increase in faecal butyrate but not in total SCFA was observed. However, increase in butyrate was not accompanied by a proliferation in the targeted bacteria. The tested Eubacterium species have the capacity to produce butyrate but do not appear to play a major role for butyric acid production in the human intestine. In view of the fact that the bacteria responsible for butyrate production are largely unknown, it is still difficult to devise a dietary intervention to stimulate butyrogenic bacteria in a targeted way.\n\nQuantification of different Eubacterium spp. in human fecal samples with species-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwiertz, A; Le Blay, G; Blaut, M\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSpecies-specific 16S rRNA-targeted, Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-labeled oligonucleotide probes were designed and validated to quantify different Eubacterium species in human fecal samples. Probes were directed at Eubacterium barkeri, E. biforme, E. contortum, E. cylindroides (two probes), E. dolichum, E. hadrum, E. lentum, E. limosum, E. moniliforme, and E. ventriosum. The specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. With one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. The species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. E. biforme, E. cylindroides, E. hadrum, E. lentum, and E. ventriosum could be determined.

Probes were directed at Eubacterium barkeri, E. biforme, E. contortum, E. cylindroides (two probes), E. dolichum, E. hadrum, E. lentum, E. limosum, E. moniliforme, and E. ventriosum. The specificity of the probes was tested with the type strains and a range of common intestinal bacteria. With one exception, none of the probes showed cross-hybridization under stringent conditions. The species-specific probes were applied to fecal samples obtained from 12 healthy volunteers. E. biforme, E. cylindroides, E. hadrum, E. lentum, and E. ventriosum could be determined. All other Eubacterium species for which probes had been designed were under the detection limit of 107 cells g (dry weight) of fecesâ1. The cell counts obtained are essentially in accordance with the literature data, which are based on colony counts. This shows that whole-cell in situ hybridization with species-specific probes is a valuable tool for the enumeration of Eubacterium species in feces.

We investigated the effects of a Polygoni Multiflori Ramulus extract on melanogenesis and isolated emodin from Polygoni Multiflori as an active compound. In addition, the possible mechanisms of action were examined. We found that emodin inhibited both melanin content and tyrosinase activity concentration and time dependently. Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 mRNA levels decreased following emodin treatment. However, while the mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were not affected by emodin, emodin reduced MITF protein levels. Furthermore, expression of the liver X-receptor (LXR) Î± gene, but not the LXR Î² gene was upregulated by emodin. Moreover, emodin regulated melanogenesis by promoting degradation of the MITF protein by upregulating the LXR Î± gene. The emodin effects on MITF was found to be mediated by phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by emodin occurs through reduced MITF protein expression, which is mediated by upregulation of the LXR Î± gene and suggest that emodin may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.

This is achieved by mechanical stirrers, causing high shear stress. Examples for shear stress sensitive microorganisms, for which no specific cultivation systems exist, are many anaerobic bacteria and fungi, such as basidiomycetes. In this work a disposable bag bioreactor developed for cultivation of mammalian cells was investigated to evaluate its potential to cultivate shear stress sensitive anaerobic Eubacterium ramulus and shear stress sensitive basidiomycetes Flammulina velutipes and Pleurotus sapidus. All cultivations were compared with conventional stainless steel stirred tank reactors (STR) cultivations. Good growth of all investigated microorganisms cultivated in the bag reactor was found. E. ramulus showed growth rates of Î¼=0.56 hâ»Â¹ (bag) and Î¼=0.53 hâ»Â¹ (STR). Differences concerning morphology, enzymatic activities and growth in fungal cultivations were observed. In the bag reactor growth in form of small, independent pellets was observed while STR cultivations showed intense aggregation. F. velutipes reached higher biomass concentrations (21.2 g lâ»Â¹ DCW vs. 16.8 g lâ»Â¹ DCW) and up to 2-fold higher peptidolytic activities in comparison to cell cultivation in stirred tank reactors.

The strains were anaerobic, with Gram-positive cell walls, straight-to-slightly-curved, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming and single flagellate. C 14â:â1 , C 14â:â0 , C 16â:â0 and C 16â:â1 were the predominant fatty acids. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was A1 Î³ . The DNA G+C content varied from 41.4 to 42.2âmol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between the isolates and Eubacterium rectale , Roseburia hominis and Roseburia intestinalis were found to be 96, 95 and 95â%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree showed that the strains constituted a different taxon, separate from other taxa with validly published names and forming a cluster with strains of Eubacterium rectale. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic results (16S RNA, dnaK , groEL , atpA genes), the isolates are considered to represent a novel species of a new genus of the family Lachnospiraceae , for which the name Agathobacter ruminis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed (type strain JK623 T â=âDSM 29029 T â=âLMG 28559 T ). We also propose the transfer of Eubacterium rectale to the new genus as Agathobacter rectalis gen. nov., comb nov. This new genus represents saccharoclastic, chemo-organotrophic and obligatory anaerobic, non-spore-forming rods with Gram-positive membrane. The main fermentation products on peptone yeast glucose (PYG) medium were butyrate, acetate, hydrogen and lactate. The type species of the genus is Agathobacter rectalis gen. nov., comb nov. (PrÃ©vot, 1938) with type strain ATCC 33656 T (â=âJCM 17463 T ).\n\nLyophilized aqueous extracts of Mori Fructus and Mori Ramulus protect Mesenchymal stem cells from â¢OH-treated damage: bioassay and antioxidant mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Qian; Li, Xican; Tian, Yage; Lin, Qiaoqi; Xie, Hong; Lu, Wenbiao; Chi, Yuguang; Chen, Dongfeng\n\n2017-05-02\n\nMori Fructus and Mori Ramulus are two traditional Chinese herbal medicines from mulberries. The present work explores their beneficial effects on â¢OH-treated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and discusses possible mechanisms. Lyophilized aqueous extracts of Mori Fructus (LAMF) and Mori Ramulus (LAMR) were prepared and analyzed using HPLC. LAMF and LAMR (along with morin) were further investigated for their effects on â¢OH-treated MSCs using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl (MTT) assay. The direct antioxidation mechanisms were studied using 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIOâ¢)-scavenging, 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS + â¢)-scavenging and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazl (DPPHâ¢)-scavenging, as well as Cu 2+ -reducing and Fe 3+ -reducing antioxidant power. Finally, the indirect antioxidant mechanism was investigated based on the UV-vis spectra of Fe 2+ -chelation. In each LAMF and LAMR, seven phytophenols were successfully measured by HPLC, including five flavonoids (morin, rutin, astragalin, isoquercitrin and luteolin) and two non-flavonoids (chlorogenic acid and maclurin). MTT assays revealed that LAMF, LAMR and morin could effectively increase the survival of â¢OH-treated MSCs at 10-100Â Î¼g/mL, and could effectively scavenge PTIOâ¢ (IC 50 6609.7Â Â±Â 756.6, 4286.9Â Â±Â 84.9 and 103.4Â Â±Â 0.9Â Î¼g/mL, respectively), DPPHâ¢ (IC 50 208.7Â Â±Â 3.0, 97.3Â Â±Â 3.1 and 8.2Â Â±Â 0.7Â Î¼g/mL, respectively) and ABTS + â¢ (IC 50 73.5Â Â±Â 5.8, 34.4Â Â±Â 0.1 and 4.2Â Â±Â 0.2Â Î¼g/mL, respectively), and reduce Cu 2+ (IC 50 212.5Â Â±Â 7.0, 123.2Â Â±Â 0.9 and 14.1Â Â±Â 0.04Â Î¼g/mL, respectively) & Fe 3+ (IC 50 277.0Â Â±Â 3.1, 191.9Â Â±Â 5.2 and 5.0Â Â±Â 0.2Â Î¼g/mL, respectively). In the Fe 2+ -chelating assay, the five flavonoids produced much stronger shoulder-peaks than the two non-flavonoids within 420-850Â nm. Mori Fructus and Mori Ramulus, can protect MSCs from â¢OH-induced damage.

This fragment was cloned into bacteriophage lambda gt11, and a 2.9-kb piece of this insert was subcloned into pUC19, yielding the recombinant plasmid pBH51. DNA sequence analysis of the 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene in pBH51 revealed a 798-bp open reading frame, coding for a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 28,500. A putative promoter sequence and ribosome binding site were identified. The 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase mRNA transcript in Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 was about 0.94 kb in length, suggesting that it is monocistronic. An Escherichia coli DH5 alpha transformant harboring pBH51 had approximately 30-fold greater levels of 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase mRNA, immunoreactive protein, and specific activity than Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. The 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase purified from the pBH51 transformant was similar in subunit molecular weight, specific activity, and kinetic properties to that from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708, and it reached with antiserum raised against the authentic enzyme on Western immunoblots. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with those of 10 other pyridine nucleotide-linked alcohol/polyol dehydrogenases revealed six conserved amino acid residues in the N-terminal regions thought to function in coenzyme binding.

All strains exhibit a relaxed phenotype with respect to accumulation of 16S rRNA. This constitutes the first example of a wild-type eubacterium showing a relaxed phenotype. The guanosine polyphosphate levels do not rise as a result of amino acid starvation, as expected for relaxed organisms. However, in both growing and starved cells, basal levels of the two polyphosphates appeared to be present, demonstrating that the enzymatic machinery for guanosine polyphosphate production is present in this organism. These findings are discussed within the framework of the hypothesis that stringent control is a physiological control mechanism more important for the fitness of prokaryotes growing in the general environment than for those that inhabit protected niches.

Both bacteria hydrolyzed the esters to the corresponding carboxylates and methanol under either condition. Methanol was further oxidized to formate under growing but not resting conditions. Unlike the metabolism of phenylmethylethers, no H2 requirement was evident for ester biotransformation. The hydrolysis of methyl carboxylates is thermodynamically favorable under standard conditions and the mixotrophic metabolism of ester/CO2 allowed for bacterial growth. These results suggest that the degradation of methyl carboxylates may be a heretofore unrecognized nutritional option for acetogenic bacteria.\n\nIdentification and properties of an alpha-amylase from a strain of Eubacterium sp. isolated from the rat intestinal tract.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelahaye, E P; Foglietti, M J; Andrieux, C; Chardon-Loriaux, I; Szylit, O; Raibaud, P\n\n1991-01-01\n\n1.

However, the precise labeling and analysis of bacteria at the single-bacterium level are a technical challenge but very important to reveal important details about the heterogeneity of cells and responds to environment. This study demonstrates an optical strategy for single-bacterium labeling and analysis by the cotrapping of single upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and bacteria together. A single UCNP with an average size of â120 nm is first optically trapped. Both ends of a single bacterium are then trapped and labeled with single UCNPs emitting green light. The labeled bacterium can be flexibly moved to designated locations for further analysis. Signals from bacteria of different sizes are detected in real time for single-bacterium analysis. This cotrapping method provides a new approach for single-pathogenic-bacterium labeling, detection, and real-time analysis at the single-particle and single-bacterium level.

[Eubacterium limosum; Acetobacterium woodil; Syntrophococcus; Clostridium; Desulfotomaculum; Enterobacter\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDeWeerd, J.A.; Saxena, A.; Nagle, D.P. Jr.\n\n1988-05-01\n\nThe mechanism of the bioconversion of methoxylated benzoic acids to the hydroxylated derivatives was investigated with a model substrate and cultures of one anaerobic consortium, eight strict anaerobic bacteria, and one facultative anaerobic microorganism. We found that a haloaromatic dehalogenating consortium, a dehalogenating isolate from that consortium, Eubacterium, limosum, and a strain of Acetobacterium woodii metabolized 3-(methoxy-/sup 18/O)methoxybenzoic acid (3-anisic acid) to 3-(hydroxy-/sup 18/O)hydroxybenzoic acid stoichiometrically at rates of 1.5, 3.2, 52.4, and 36.7 nmol/min per mg of protein, respectively. A different strain of Acetobacterium and strains of Syntrophococcus, Clostridium Desulfotomaculum, Enterobacter, and an anaerobic bacterium, strain TH-001, were unablemoreÂ Â» to transform this compound. The O-demethylating ability of E. limosum was induced only with appropriate methoxylated benzoates but not with D-glucose, lactate, isoleucine, or methanol. Cross-acclimation and growth experiments with E. limosum showed a rate of metabolism that was an order of magnitude slower and showed no growth with either 4-methoxysalicylic acid (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid) or 4-anisic acid (4-methoxybenzoic acid) when adapted to 3-anisic acid. However, A. woodii NZva-16 showed slower rates and no growth with 3- or 4-methoxysalicylic acid when adapted to 3-anisic acid in similar experiments.Â«Â less\n\nFeatures of rumen and sewage sludge strains of Eubacterium limosum, a methanol- and H2-CO2-utilizing species.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGenthner, B R; Davis, C L; Bryant, M P\n\n1981-01-01\n\nEubacterium limosum was isolated as the most numerous methanol-utilizing bacterium in the rumen fluid of sheep fed a diet in which molasses was a major component (mean most probable number of 6.3 X 10(8) viable cells per ml). It was also isolated from sewage sludge at 9.5 X 10(4) cells per ml. It was not detected in the rumen fluid of a steer on a normal hay-grain diet, although Methanosarcina, as expected, was found at 9.5 X 10(5) cells per ml. The doubling time of E. limosum in basal medium (5% rumen fluid) with methanol as the energy source (37 degree C) was 7 h. Acetate, cysteine, carbon dioxide, and the vitamins biotin, calcium-D-pantothenate, and lipoic acid were required for growth on a chemically defined methanol medium. Acetate, butyrate, and caproate were produced from methanol. Ammonia or each of several amino acids served as the main nitrogen source. Other energy sources included adonitol, arabitol, erythritol, fructose, glucose, isoleucine, lactate, mannitol, ribose, valine, and H2-CO2. The doubling time for growth on H2-CO2 (5% rumen fluid, 37 degree C) was 14 h as compared with 5.2 h for isoleucine and 3.5 h for glucose. The vitamin requirements for growth on H2-CO2 were the same as those for methanol; however, acetate was not required for growth on H2-CO2, although it was necessary for growth on valine, isoleucine, and lactate and was stimulatory to growth on glucose. Acetate and butyrate were formed during growth on H2-CO2, whereas branched-chain fatty acids and ammonia were fermentation products from the amino acids. Heat tolerance was detected, but spores were not observed. The type strain of E. limosum (ATCC 8486) and strain L34, which was isolated from the rumen of a young calf, grew on methanol, H2-CO2, valine, and isoleucine and showed the same requirements for acetate as the freshly isolated strains.

In order to investigate the diversity and stability of butyrate-producing organisms of the colonic flora, anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria were isolated from freshly voided human fecal samples from three healthy individuals: an infant, an adult omnivore, and an adult vegetarian. A second isolation was performed on the same three individuals 1 year later. Of a total of 313 bacterial isolates, 74 produced more than 2 mM butyrate in vitro. Butyrate-producing isolates were grouped by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The results indicate very little overlap between the predominant ribotypes of the three subjects; furthermore, the flora of each individual changed significantly between the two isolations. Complete sequences of 16S rDNAs were determined for 24 representative strains and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Eighty percent of the butyrate-producing isolates fell within the XIVa cluster of gram-positive bacteria as defined by M. D. Collins et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812â826, 1994) and A. Willems et al. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 46:195â199, 1996), with the most abundant group (10 of 24 or 42%) clustering with Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium ramulus, and Roseburia cecicola. Fifty percent of the butyrate-producing isolates were net acetate consumers during growth, suggesting that they employ the butyryl coenzyme A-acetyl coenzyme A transferase pathway for butyrate production. In contrast, only 1% of the 239 non-butyrate-producing isolates consumed acetate.

In the present investigations, 3 E. lentum strains (group E) isolated from rat feces were compared with 30 E. lentum strains (groups A, B, C, and D) previously studied by Macdonald et al. (I. A. Macdonald, J. F. Jellet, D. E. Mahony, and L. V. Holdeman, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 37:992-1000, 1979). All strains alkalized (pH 8 to 8.5) arginine-containing (2 to 15 mg/ml) culture media, and growth of the majority of the strains was stimulated by arginine. All strains converted linoleic acid into transvaccenic acid by shifting the 12,13-cis double bond of linoleic acid into an 11,12-trans(?) double bond followed by biohydrogenation of the 9,10-cis double bond. Hence, biohydrogenation of linoleic acid is a new general characteristic of E. lentum. The 33 strains were also studied for bile acid deconjugase and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activities. The 6 strains in group D were steroid inactive; the 27 strains in groups A, B, C, and E were steroid active. The steroid-active group contained bile acid deconjugase-producing strains (groups C and E, plus strain 116 in group A) and nondeconjugating strains. All nondeconjugating strains of groups A and B developed 7 alpha- and 12 alpha-HSDH activities and contained 3 alpha-HSDH-positive strains and 3 alpha-HSDH-negative strains. Deconjugating strains varied in HSDH activities.

To better delineate their taxonomic relatedness, 29 clinical isolates of E. lentum were examined for soluble-protein content, cellular fatty acid profile, and antimicrobial resistance pattern in order to ascertain whether differences in these characteristics could be correlated with differences in biochemical activities. Among 29 isolates we could identify 6 that were different from all the others. These strains were coccobacilli with translucent colonies; they were catalase and H2S negative, not fluorescent under UV light, and susceptible to beta-lactam drugs; growth was not stimulated by arginine; and fatty acid analysis revealed the presence of straight-chain fatty acids. The remainder of the strains, including the type species, were pleomorphic bacilli with speckled colonies and were catalase and H2S positive; all but two were fluorescent under UV light; they were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics; growth was greatly stimulated by arginine; and they demonstrated saturated branched-chain fatty acids. Our data suggest that E. lentum can be further differentiated into different types.

Positive results were found in 59% of patients with Crohn's disease, 29% of patients with ulcerative colitis, and 8% of both diseased and healthy control subjects. Patients with Crohn's disease of the colon had more positive tests (67%) than patients with disease confined to the small bowel (46%).

The apparent molecular mass of the native protein, which showed an associating/dissociating behaviour, was about 420 kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of protein PC revealed two protein bands corresponding to 48 and 57 kDa, indicating an alpha 4 beta 4 composition. The smaller subunit was identified as an acetyl-group-transferring protein, the 57-kDa protein was hydrophobic. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined for both subunits. Antibodies raised against the 48-kDa subunit showed cross-reactions with extracts of E. acidaminophilum grown on different substrates and with extracts from other glycine-utilizing anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium purinolyticum, C. sticklandii, and C. sporogenes. The respective protein from the former two organisms corresponded in molecular mass. When protein PA was chemically carboxymethylated by iodo[2-14C]acetate and incubated with protein PC, acetyl phosphate was a reaction product, thus establishing it as the product of the glycine reductase reaction by using homogeneous preparations of these two proteins from E. acidaminophilum.\n\nNREL Researchers Discover How a Bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum,\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\ncontaining the bacterium actually promotes the growth of C. thermocellum, yet its mechanistic details remained a puzzle.

Because of renewed interest in cellulose-degrading bacteria for use in the bioconversion of cellulose to chemical feed stocks and fuels, we re-examined the characteristics of this microorganism to determine its true metabolic potential. Metabolic and physical characterization of NCIMB 10462 revealed that this is an alkalophilic, non-fermentative, gram-negative, oxidase-positive, motile, cellulose-degrading bacterium.

Although these dual effects of AXOS are considered beneficial for human health, their underlying mechanisms are still far from being understood. Therefore, this study investigated the metabolic interactions between Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum NCC2705 (B. longum NCC2705), an acetate producer and arabinose substituent degrader of AXOS, and Eubacterium rectale ATCC 33656, an acetate-converting butyrate producer. Both strains belong to prevalent species of the human colon microbiota. The strains were grown on AXOS during mono- and coculture fermentations, and their growth, AXOS consumption, metabolite production, and expression of key genes were monitored. The results showed that the growth of both strains and gene expression in both strains were affected by cocultivation and that these effects could be linked to changes in carbohydrate consumption and concomitant metabolite production. The consumption of the arabinose substituents of AXOS by B. longum NCC2705 with the concomitant production of acetate allowed E. rectale ATCC 33656 to produce butyrate (by means of a butyryl coenzyme A [CoA]:acetate CoA-transferase), explaining the butyrogenic effect of AXOS. Eubacterium rectale ATCC 33656 released xylose from the AXOS substrate, which favored the B. longum NCC2705 production of acetate, explaining the bifidogenic effect of AXOS. Hence, those interactions represent mutual cross-feeding mechanisms that favor the coexistence of bifidobacterial strains and butyrate producers in the same ecological niche. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the bifidogenic and butyrogenic effects of AXOS.

With this plate assay, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes were isolated from human feces and identified as Eubacterium hadrum (2 strains), Eubacterium spp. (2 species), Clostridium clostridiiforme, a Butyrivibrio sp., a Bacteroides sp., Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium nexile, and a Clostridium sp. The average rate of reduction of Direct Blue 15 dye (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in these strains ranged from 16 to 135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. The enzymes were inactivated by oxygen. In seven isolates, a flavin compound (riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or flavin mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. In the other three isolates and in Clostridium perfringens, no added flavin was required for activity. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each bacterium expressed only one azoreductase isozyme. At least three types of azoreductase enzyme were produced by the different isolates.

The enzyme was synthesized constitutively by both organisms, and the enzyme yields were suppressed by the addition of 0.5 mM 7 beta-hydroxy bile acid to the growth medium. Purification of the enzyme by chromatography resulted in preparations with 3.5 (P. productus b-52, on Sephadex G-200) and 1.8 (E. aerofaciens, on Bio-Gel A-1.5 M) times the activity of the crude cell extracts. A pH optimum of 9.8 and a molecular weight of approximately 53,000 were shown for the enzyme of strain b-52, and an optimum pH at 10.5 and a molecular weight of 45,000 was shown for that from strain ATCC 25986. Kinetic studies revealed that both enzyme preparations oxidized the 7 beta-hydroxy group in unconjugated and conjugated bile acids, a lower Km value being demonstrated with free bile acid than with glycine and taurine conjugates. No measureable activity against 3 alpha-, 7 alpha-, or 12 alpha-hydroxy groups was detected in either enzyme preparation. When tested with strain ATCC 25986, little 7 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase activity was detected in cells grown in the presence of glucose in excess. The enzyme from strain b-52 was found to be heat labile (90% inactivation at 50 degrees C for 3 min) and highly sensitive to sulfhydryl inhibitors.

In some gut environments acetogens can compete with methanogens for H2, and as a result rumen acetogens are of interest in the development of microbial approaches for methane mitigation. The acetogen Eubacterium limosum SA11 was isolated from the rumen of a New Zealand sheep and its genome has been sequenced to examine its potential application in methane mitigation strategies, particularly in situations where hydrogenotrophic methanogens are inhibited resulting in increased H2 levels in the rumen. The 4.15Â Mb chromosome of SA11 has an average Gâ+âC content of 47Â %, and encodes 3805 protein-coding genes. There is a single prophage inserted in the chromosome, and several other gene clusters appear to have been acquired by horizontal transfer. These include genes for cell wall glycopolymers, a type VII secretion system, cell surface proteins and chemotaxis. SA11 is able to use a variety of organic substrates in addition to H2/CO2, with acetate and butyrate as the principal fermentation end-products, and genes involved in these metabolic pathways have been identified. An unusual feature is the presence of 39 genes encoding trimethylamine methyltransferase family proteins, more than any other bacterial genome. Overall, SA11 is a metabolically versatile organism, but its ability to grow on such a wide range of substrates suggests it may not be a suitable candidate to take the place of hydrogen-utilizing methanogens in the rumen.\n\nOxidation of Ethylene Glycol by a Salt-Requiring Bacterium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaskey, William H.; Taber, Willard A.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nBacterium T-52, cultured on ethylene glycol, readily oxidized glycolate and glyoxylate and exhibited elevated activities of ethylene glycol dehydrogenase and glycolate oxidase.

Hydrogenases are proteins containing either Nickel and Iron, or the only Iron in theirs active center. Hydrogenases have been found in many microorganisms, such as Methanogenic, acetogenic, nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic and sulfate-reducing bacteria that could utilize the hydrogen as energy source or use it as electron sink. Hydrogenases are subject for wide physiological, biochemical, physicochemical and genetic studies due to theirs abilities produce the molecular hydrogen as alternative source of pure energy. Notwithstanding on enough large quantity of works that deal with intracellular and extrasellular enzymes of halophilic bacteria, the data about hydrogenases and theirs functions of salts practically are absent. The study of hydrogenase in cell-free extracts of extremely halophilic eubacterium Acetohalobium mabaticum showed dramatic increasing activity of the enzyme at high concentrations of NaCl and KCI (close to saturated solution). Here we present the data of free-cells extracted hydrogenase from new haloalkaliphilic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfonatronum thiodismutans, which grow on highly miniralized carbonate-bicarbonate medium in salinity range 1 to 7 % and at pH 7.8 - 10.5. Studied enzyme was active in Concentration range from 0 to 4.3 M NaCl with optimum at 1.0 M NaCl. At 1.0 M NaCl the enzyme activity was increased on 20 %, but with changing concentration from 2.1 M to 3.4 M the activity decreased and was kept on constant level. NaHCO3 inhibited hydrogenase activity on more then 30 %. The maximum of enzyme activity was observed at pH 9.5 with limits 7.5 and 11.5 that practically equal to pH optimum of bacterial growth. Therefore the hydrogenase of Desulfanatronum thiodismutans is tolerant to high concentrations of sodium salts and it also resistant to\n\nDetection of tet(M) and tet(O) using the polymerase chain reaction in bacteria isolated from patients with periodontal disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlsvik, B; Olsen, I; Tenover, F C\n\n1995-04-01\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction was used to examine 114 tetracycline-resistant anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial isolates from patients with periodontal disease for the tet(M) and tet(O) genes.

We investigated the microbiological aspects of the bacteria contained in the capsule, such as microbial diversity, phylogenetic placement, localization in vivo, and fitness effects on the host insect. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA clones revealed that a single bacterial species dominates the microbiota in the capsule. The bacterium was not detected in the eggs but in the capsules, which unequivocally demonstrated that the bacterium is transmitted to the offspring of the insect orally rather than transovarially, through probing of the capsule content. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterium belongs to the Î³-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. In adult insects the bacterium was localized in the posterior section of the midgut. Deprivation of the bacterium from the nymphs resulted in retarded development, arrested growth, abnormal body coloration, and other symptoms, suggesting that the bacterium is essential for normal development and growth of the host insect.

L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe use measurements of swimming bacteria in an optical trap to determine fundamental properties of bacterial propulsion. In particular, we directly measure the force required to hold the bacterium in the optical trap and determine the propulsion matrix, which relates the translational and angular velocity of the flagellum to the torques and forces propelling the bacterium. From the propulsion matrix, dynamical properties such as torques, swimming speed, and power can be obtained by measuring the angular velocity of the motor. We find significant heterogeneities among different individuals even though all bacteria started from a single colony. The propulsive efficiency, defined as the ratio of the propulsive power output to the rotary power input provided by the motors, is found to be â2%, which is consistent with the efficiency predicted theoretically for a rigid helical coil.

We extract from our measurements the translational and the rotational diffusion coefficients of this bacterium. A simple theoretical model is suggested, perfectly reproducing the experimental diffusion coefficients, with no tunable parameters. An older theoretical model, where edge effects are neglected, dramatically underestimates the observed rates of translation. Interestingly, the coiling of LI increases its rotational diffusion coefficient by a factor of 5, compared to a (hypothetical) rectified bacterium of the same contour length. Moreover, the translational diffusion coefficients would have decreased by a factor of ~1.5, if LI were rectified. This suggests that the spiral shape of the spirochaete bacteria, in addition to being employed for their active twisting motion, may also increase the ability of these bacteria to explore the surrounding fluid by passive Brownian diffusion.\n\nProposal for the reclassification of obligately purine-fermenting bacteria Clostridium acidurici (Barker 1938) and Clostridium purinilyticum (DÃ¼rre et al. 1981) as Gottschalkia acidurici gen. nov. comb. nov. and Gottschalkia purinilytica comb. nov. and of Eubacterium angustum (Beuscher and Andreesen 1985) as Andreesenia angusta gen. nov. comb. nov. in the family Gottschalkiaceae fam. nov.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPoehlein, Anja; Yutin, Natalya; Daniel, Rolf\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSeveral strictly anaerobic bacteria that are Gram-stain-positive have the ability to use uric acid as the sole source of carbon and energy. The phylogeny of three such species, Clostridium acidurici, Clostridium purinilyticum, and Eubacterium angustum, members of the Clostridium cluster XII that ferment purines, but not most amino acids or carbohydrates, has been re-examined, taking advantage of their recently sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic analyses, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, protein sequences of RpoB and GyrB, and on a concatenated alignment of 50 ribosomal proteins, revealed tight clustering of C. acidurici and C. purinilyticum. Eubacterium angustum showed consistent association with C. acidurici and C. purinilyticum , but differed from these two in terms of the genome size, G+C content of its chromosomal DNA and its inability to form spores. We propose reassigning C. acidurici and C. purinilyticum to the novel genus Gottschalkia as Gottschalkia acidurici gen. nov. comb. nov. (the type species of the genus) and Gottschalkia purinilytica comb. nov., respectively. Eubacterium angustum is proposed to be reclassified as Andreesenia angusta gen. nov. comb. nov. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetic data and similar metabolic properties, we propose assigning genera Gottschalkia and Andreesenia to the novel family Gottschalkiaceae. Metagenomic sequencing data indicate the widespread distibution of organisms falling within the radiation of the proposed family Gottschalkiaceae in terrestrial and aquatic habitats from upstate New York to Antarctica, most likely due to their ability to metabolize avian-produced uric acid.

The morphology of the algicidal bacterium was observed using optical microscope and electron microscopes, the results showed that A01 was rod-shaped, approximately 1.5 microm in length and 0.45 microm in width and with no flagella structure. A01 was Gram-negative and belongs to the family Acinetobacter sp. though identification by Gram's staining and 16S rDNA gene analysis. A01 exhibited strong algicidal activity on the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena eucompacta under laboratory conditions. The removal rate of chlorophyll a after 7-day incubation with the culture supernatant of A01 and thalli were 77% and 61%, respectively. Microscopic observation showed that almost all cyanobacterial cells were destroyed within 3 d of co-incubation with the supernatant of algicidal bacterium, but a mass of the cyanobacterial cell lysis was observed only after 5 d of co-incubation with the thalli of algicidal bacterium. These results indicated that the main algicidal component of A01 was in its culture supernatant. In other words, the strain A01 could secrete algicidal component against Anabaena eucompacta.\n\nThe Common Gut Microbe Eubacterium hallii also Contributes to Intestinal Propionate Formation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEngels, Christina; Ruscheweyh, Hans-Joachim; Beerenwinkel, Niko; Lacroix, Christophe; Schwab, Clarissa\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEubacterium hallii is considered an important microbe in regard to intestinal metabolic balance due to its ability to utilize glucose and the fermentation intermediates acetate and lactate, to form butyrate and hydrogen. Recently, we observed that E. hallii is capable of metabolizing glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA, reuterin) with reported antimicrobial properties. The key enzyme for glycerol to 3-HPA conversion is the cobalamin-dependent glycerol/diol dehydratase PduCDE which also utilizes 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) to form propionate. Therefore our primary goal was to investigate glycerol to 3-HPA metabolism and 1,2-PD utilization by E. hallii along with its ability to produce cobalamin. We also investigated the relative abundance of E. hallii in stool of adults using 16S rRNA and pduCDE based gene screening to determine the contribution of E. hallii to intestinal propionate formation. We found that E. hallii utilizes glycerol to produce up to 9 mM 3-HPA but did not further metabolize 3-HPA to 1,3-propanediol. Utilization of 1,2-PD in the presence and absence of glucose led to the formation of propanal, propanol and propionate. E. hallii formed cobalamin and was detected in stool of 74% of adults using 16S rRNA gene as marker gene (n = 325). Relative abundance of the E. hallii 16S rRNA gene ranged from 0 to 0.59% with a mean relative abundance of 0.044%.

Our results along with its ability to use a broad range of substrates point at E. hallii as a key species within the intestinal trophic chain with the potential to\n\nGut bacterium of Dendrobaena veneta (Annelida: Oligochaeta) possesses antimycobacterial activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nFioÅka, Marta J; Zagaja, MirosÅaw P; Piersiak, Tomasz D; WrÃ³bel, Marek; Pawelec, JarosÅaw\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe new bacterial strain with antimycobacterial activity has been isolated from the midgut of Dendrobaena veneta (Annelida). Biochemical and molecular characterization of isolates from 18 individuals identified all as Raoultella ornithinolytica genus with 99% similarity. The bacterium is a possible symbiont of the earthworm D. veneta. The isolated microorganism has shown the activity against four strains of fast-growing mycobacteria: Mycobacterium butiricum, Mycobacterium jucho, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium phlei. The multiplication of the gut bacterium on plates with Sauton medium containing mycobacteria has caused a lytic effect. After the incubation of the cell free extract prepared from the gut bacterium with four strains of mycobacteria in liquid Sauton medium, the cells of all tested strains were deformed and divided to small oval forms and sometimes created long filaments. The effect was observed by the use of light, transmission and scanning microscopy. Viability of all examined species of mycobacteria was significantly decreased. The antimycobacterial effect was probably the result of the antibiotic action produced by the gut bacterium of the earthworm. The application of ultrafiltration procedure allowed to demonstrate that antimicrobial substance with strong antimycobacterial activity from bacterial culture supernatant, is a protein with the molecular mass above 100 kDa.

Unlike many other halophiles, this bacterium does not require expensive complex media components and it is capable to accumulate high intracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) fractions up to 82% of cell dry mass. Most remarkably, regulating the concentration of NaCl apart from PHB yields influences also the polymer's molecular mass and polydispersity. The bacterium metabolizes various carbohydrates including sugars predominant in lignocelluloses and other inexpensive substrates. Therefore, the bacterium was employed for PHB production on hydrolysates of cheese whey, spent coffee grounds, sawdust and corn stover, which were hydrolyzed by HCl; required salinity of cultivation media was set up during neutralization by NaOH. The bacterium was capable to use all the tested hydrolysates as well as sugar beet molasses for PHB biosynthesis, indicating its potential for industrial PHB production.

The anti-bacterium activity of ginkgolic acids were tested. The relation between the anti-bacterium activity and side chain of ginkgolic acid were studied. The MIC of ginkgolic acids and their three monomers and salicylic acid were tested. Ginkgolic acid has strong inhibitive effect on G+-bacterium. Salicylic acid has no side chain, so no anti-bacterial activity. When the length of gingkolic acid side chain is C13:0, it has the strongest anti-bacterial activity in three monomers. The side chain of ginkgolic acid is the key functional group that possessed anti-bacterial activity. The length of Ginkgolic acid was the main effective factor of anti-bacterial activity.\n\nHydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and oral Bacteroides and Porphyromonas spp., Wolinella recta, and Eubacterium yurii with special reference to bacterial surface structures.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaapasalo, M; Kerosuo, E; Lounatmaa, K\n\n1990-12-01\n\nThe hydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and Bacteroides buccae, B. oris, B. oralis, B. veroralis, B. buccalis, B. heparinolyticus, B. intermedius, B. denticola, B. loescheii, B. melaninogenicus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, Wolinella recta, and Eubacterium yurii were studied by the hexadecane method. The majority of the strains were equally or less hydrophobic than the PMNLs. Only in the case of E. yurii and the only strain of B. buccalis were all strains more hydrophobic than the PMNLs. However, some strains of B. intermedius, B. oris, B. denticola, and P. gingivalis were also more hydrophobic than the PMNLs. With the exception of B. intermedius and species with a crystalline surface protein layer (S-layer), the strains of all other species with a thick capsule were more hydrophilic than the strains with little or no extracellular polymeric material. All strains of the S-layer species were either quite hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the species, totally irrespective of the presence of the capsule. The results suggest that the S-layers of oral anaerobic bacteria may be important determinants of cell surface hydrophobicity.\n\nEndohyphal Bacterium Enhances Production of Indole-3-Acetic Acid by a Foliar Fungal Endophyte\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHoffman, Michele T.; Gunatilaka, Malkanthi K.; Wijeratne, Kithsiri; Gunatilaka, Leslie; Arnold, A. Elizabeth\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNumerous plant pathogens, rhizosphere symbionts, and endophytic bacteria and yeasts produce the important phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), often with profound effects on host plants. However, to date IAA production has not been documented among foliar endophytes -- the diverse guild of primarily filamentous Ascomycota that live within healthy, above-ground tissues of all plant species studied thus far. Recently bacteria that live within hyphae of endophytes (endohyphal bacteria) have been detected, but their effects have not been studied previously. Here we show not only that IAA is produced in vitro by a foliar endophyte (here identified as Pestalotiopsis aff. neglecta, Xylariales), but that IAA production is enhanced significantly when the endophyte hosts an endohyphal bacterium (here identified as Luteibacter sp., Xanthomonadales). Both the endophyte and the endophyte/bacterium complex appear to rely on an L-tryptophan dependent pathway for IAA synthesis. The bacterium can be isolated from the fungus when the symbiotic complex is cultivated at 36Â°C. In pure culture the bacterium does not produce IAA. Culture filtrate from the endophyte-bacterium complex significantly enhances growth of tomato in vitro relative to controls and to filtrate from the endophyte alone. Together these results speak to a facultative symbiosis between an endophyte and endohyphal bacterium that strongly influences IAA production, providing a new framework in which to explore endophyte-plant interactions.

A single-beam gradient optical trap was used to micromanipulate the bacterium against a flat surface while evanescent wave light scattering was used to measure separation distances. Calibrating the optical trap far from the surface allowed the trapped bacterium to be used as a force probe. Equilibrium force-distance profiles were determined by measuring the deflection of the cell from the center of the optical trap at various trap positions. Simultaneously, viscous forces were determined by measuring the relaxation time for the fluctuating bacterium. Absolute distances were determined using a best-fit approximation to the theoretical prediction for the hindered mobility of a diffusing sphere near a wall. Using this approach, forces in the range from 0.01 to 4 pN were measured at near-nanometer resolution between Staphylococcus aureus and glass that was bare or coated with adsorbed protein.\n\nThe construction of an engineered bacterium to remove cadmium from wastewater.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, S; Shu, H\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe removal of cadmium (Cd) from wastewater before it is released from factories is important for protecting human health. Although some researchers have developed engineered bacteria, the resistance of these engineered bacteria to Cd have not been improved. In this study, two key genes involved in glutathione synthesis (gshA and gshB), a serine acetyltransferase gene (cysE), a Thlaspi caerulescens phytochelatin synthase gene (TcPCS1), and a heavy metal ATPase gene (TcHMA3) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. The resistance of the engineered bacterium to Cd was significantly greater than that of the initial bacterium and the Cd accumulation in the engineered bacterium was much higher than in the initial bacterium. In addition, the Cd resistance of the bacteria harboring gshB, gshA, cysE, and TcPCS1 was higher than that of the bacteria harboring gshA, cysE, and TcPCS1. This finding demonstrated that gshB played an important role in glutathione synthesis and that the reaction catalyzed by glutathione synthase was the limiting step for producing phytochelatins. Furthermore, TcPC"
