        "text": "Abstract\n\nAn earthquake of ML6.5 hit Nantou County, Taiwan on 2 Jun 2 2013, which was the most significant one in recent years, and felt significantly by most areas of Taiwan and coastal cities of southeastern mainland China. In order to better understand the energy spread process of seismic waves and the character of strong ground motion caused by the earthquake, we simulate ground motion of this event with the 3D finite difference method. The results show that the characters of strong ground motion are dramatically influenced by the topography of the Central Mountains in Taiwan, with a clear topographic amplification effect. Besides, the sedimentary layers in the plains and basins have also amplified the seismic waves."
