We describe the first global products (called X-BASE) from a newly implemented up-scaling framework, FLUXCOM-X. The X-BASE products comprise of estimates of \\(CO_2\\) net ecosystem exchange (\\(NEE\\)), gross primary productivity (\\(GPP\\)) as well as evapotranspiration (\\(ET\\)) and, for the first time, a novel fully data-driven global transpiration product (\\(ET_T\\)), at high spatial (0.05°) and temporal (hourly) resolution. X-BASE estimates the global \\(NEE\\) at -5.75 \\(\\pm\\) 0.33 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) for the period 2001-2020, showing a much higher consistency with independent atmospheric carbon cycle constraints compared to the previous versions of FLUXCOM. The improvement of global \\(NEE\\) was likely only possible thanks to the international effort to improve the precision and consistency of eddy covariance collection and processing pipelines , as well as to the extension of the measurements to more site-years resulting in a wider coverage of bio-climatic conditions. However, X-BASE global net ecosystem exchange shows a very low inter-annual variability, which is common to state-of-the-art data-driven flux products and remains a scientific challenge. With 125 \\(\\pm\\) 2.1 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) for the same period, X-BASE \\(GPP\\) is slightly higher than previous FLUXCOM estimates, mostly in temperate and boreal areas. X-BASE evapotranspiration amounts to 74.7x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.9x10³ \\(km^3\\) globally for the years 2001-2020, but exceeds precipitation in many dry areas likely indicating overestimation in these regions. On average 57% of evapotranspiration are estimated to be transpiration, in good agreement with isotope-based approaches, but higher than estimates from many land surface models. Despite considerable improvements to the previous up-scaling products, many further opportunities for development exist. Pathways of exploration include methodological choices in the selection and processing of eddy-covariance and satellite observations, their ingestion into the framework, and the configuration of machine learning methods. For this, the new FLUXCOM-X framework was specifically designed to have the necessary flexibility to experiment, diagnose, and converge to more accurate global flux estimates.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnergy, water, and carbon exchange between terrestrial surfaces and the atmosphere are key components of the Earth system and impact ecosystems, ecosystem services, weather, climate, and water availability. The exchange (or flux) can be directly observed using eddy covariance (EC) measurement systems [1] which are installed on towers overlooking the ecosystem of interest. The EC stations typically represent an area of a few hundred square meters to a square kilometer. One key advantage of the EC methodology is the ability to provide near continuous measurements with some records now exceeding 20 years [2], allowing for examination of flux variations from the order of thirty minutes to decades. EC systems also provide a unique perspective on the magnitude, temporal variability, and environmental sensitivity of ecosystem \\(CO_2\\) uptake, water use, and local climate regulation [1,3,4]. However, while many of the most pressing scientific knowledge gaps surrounding the delicate land carbon balance and the water cycle require spatially and temporally resolved flux patterns at continental to global scales, EC observations are confined to individual locations in space and limited periods in time [5,6]. Methodologies to transcend the gap between local and global scales are needed to ultimately supporting societal relevant activities of building greenhouse gas monitoring systems, taking informed climate and land management actions, and verifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies [7,8,9].\n\nCoordinated and consolidated data collections from EC networks are invaluable for the mapping of in-situ fluxes to regional and global scales. For example, EC measurements aid both the parameterization [10] and the validation [11,12] of mechanistic models of ecosystem productivity and land surface processes. The latter generate widely used reference data sets for terrestrial carbon cycle applications [13,14]. A complementary approach to modeling terrestrial fluxes at continental and global scales is of empirical nature and links observations of explanatory variables at the EC stations, particularly meteorological and remote sensing data, to the EC fluxes via machine learning models. This up-scaling concept does not prescribe any mechanistic formulations and assumes that the EC observations cover all complexities of ecosystem functioning. Based on a trained machine learning model and globally gridded input data of the explanatory variables, EC fluxes can be mapped to the global scale.\n\nFirst implementations of this flux up-scaling concept emerged in the early 2000s. They focused on net ecosystem exchange of \\(CO_2\\) (\\(NEE\\)) and utilized the growing EC networks in Europe [15] and North America [16]. The release of the La Thuile Synthesis Dataset of harmonized EC data in 2007, as well as methodological improvements in the training of the machine learning models [17], led to the first global products of terrestrial \\(CO_2\\) and water fluxes at a monthly time step and in 0.5° grids in 2011 [18]. While good agreement of flux estimates derived from complementary process-based models with the up-scaled global gross photosynthetic \\(CO_2\\) uptake (gross primary productivity, \\(GPP\\)) and energy fluxes demonstrated the potential of the approach, important inconsistencies remained, in particular regarding the globally integrated \\(NEE\\) and its year-to-year variability. [18,19,20,21].\n\nIn an effort to better understand the uncertainties associated with mapping of EC fluxes to larger scales, the FLUXCOM inter-comparison initiative built an ensemble of flux estimates as a type of factorial experiment [19,20,22]. The ensemble consisted of multiple machine learning algorithms, meteorological forcing data, and combinations of predictor variables resulting in 120 individual up-scaled estimates per flux. These were summarized in two overall ensemble configurations, which differed in the set of predictors and spatial-temporal resolution. Apart from creating a large ensemble, the FLUXCOM evaluation included a consistent site-level cross-validation analysis as well as cross-consistency checks with terrestrial flux estimates from independent approaches, such as complementary modeling concepts or observational surrogates. From a methodological point of view, the key lessons learned from FLUXCOM were that: (1) the overall approach seems to be primarily limited by the input information given to the machine learning algorithms rather than to the ability of the algorithm to extract the information; (2) the largest qualitative differences among flux products were related to the set of the predictor variables rather than to the choice of the machine learning method or meteorological forcing; (3) the cross-consistency checks with global independent data are essential for supplementing site-level cross-validation; and (4) the largest qualitative discrepancy with independent data was a very high (strongly negative) tropical \\(NEE\\) that was shared among all ensemble members.\n\nBy today, the empirical up-scaling concept has been implemented for a series of regional and global scale applications, each of them adopting disparate and individual methodological choices [e.g. 23,24,25,26,27,28]. These potentially important choices relate to data treatment (quality control, gap-filling, processing pathways), ingestion (sampling, as well as matching EC and space-born observations), and methodological configurations (machine learning methods and their training configuration, choice of predictor variables, resolution). Hence, flexibility to explore the large methodological space, as well as the ability to diagnose and evaluate global products in parallel to site-level cross-validation, are required to make progress in empirical up-scaling of EC fluxes. Learning from key insights in FLUXCOM and other up-scaling exercises further implies striving for enhancing the information content of the training data with aspects related to coverage and quality of EC measurements as well as quality, complementarity, and completeness of predictor variables.\n\nWe are developing a new modeling framework that allows experimenting with and systematically exploring many of these methodological choices. We coin this extended and flexibly adjustable up-scaling framework as FLUXCOM-X. Based on FLUXCOM-X, the latency with which innovations in the related fields of machine learning and spacebased Earth observations as well as novel EC data can find their way to empirical flux up-scaling will be considerably reduced. This in turn allows faster progress towards more accurate and fit-for-the-purpose global biogenic flux estimates. Here, we introduce and evaluate the initial “basic” set of products from this framework, which we refer to as FLUXCOM-X-BASE products (or X-BASE for short).\n\nX-BASE products were generated based on the same principle as in the original FLUXCOM ensemble using qualitatively similar predictor variables, i.e. remotely sensed vegetation indices and land surface temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with meteorological variables. We made efforts to provide more and improved information to the machine learning models by enhancing coverage and quality of the training data in X-BASE, and by further developing the processing of satellite predictor variables [29]. In this manuscript, we show results for X-BASE NEE, \\(GPP\\), evapotranspiration (\\(ET\\)), and for the first time transpiration (\\(ET_T\\)), for the period 2001-2020 at 0.05° spatial and hourly temporal resolution. X-BASE products are freely available and serve as a baseline for future FLUXCOM-X developments. We are focusing here on the evaluation and cross-consistency checks of X-BASE with previous FLUXCOM products and independent data streams. Our specific objectives are:\n\nto describe the production of X-BASE products;\n\nto evaluate the X-BASE setup using site-level cross-validation;\n\nto assess qualitative differences of global patterns compared to previous FLUXCOM products with reference to independent flux estimates where possible; and\n\nto synthesize lessons learned from this exercise to guide future FLUXCOM-X developments.\n\nData and Methods\n\nThe following section gives an overview on the essential methodological implementations and data choices adopted in the generation of X-BASE products.\n\nEddy Covariance Data\n\nEddy covariance data consisted of 294 sites from around the world though skewed towards higher representation from temperate forests from North America and Europe. All EC data were collected, processed, analyzed for quality by the station teams, before being processed using state-of-the-art approaches in the ONEFLUX data processing pipeline [2]. The data included was collected between 2001-2020 and available with a CC BY 4.0 license. Based on this criterion, data for each site came from one of five different sources based on most recent availability: FLUXNET 2015 [2], ICOS Drought 2018 [30], ICOS Warm Winter 2020 [31], or the most recent Ameriflux or ICOS release as of December 2022. Table 1 lists all sites included as well as the associated digital object identifier specific to the associated release.\n\nMeteorological data measured at each site consisted of incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit, of which all data were gap-filled using the Marginal Distribution Sampling method [251], as well as the computed potential shortwave incoming radiation (top of atmosphere theoretical maximum radiation) for every hour. Carbon dioxide flux data consisted of gap-filled net ecosystem exchange (\\(NEE\\), variable ustar threshold 50th percentile i.e. NEE_VUT_50) and the corresponding gross primary productivity (\\(GPP\\), nighttime partitioning method [251]). Water flux data consisted of evapotranspiration (\\(ET\\), no energy balance correction) which was converted from the latent energy and transpiration estimates based on the Transpiration Estimation Algorithm (TEA) [252,253]. All data were aggregated to a common hourly time resolution, an overview of which can be found in Table 2.\n\nFeatures air temperature \\(^{\\circ} \\, C\\) vapor pressure deficit \\(hPa\\) incoming shortwave rad. \\(W \\cdot m^{-2}\\) pot. incoming shortwave rad. \\(W \\cdot m^{-2}\\) derivative of daily pot. incoming shortwave rad. \\(W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot d^{-1}\\) derivative of pot. incoming shortwave rad. \\(W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot hr^{-1}\\) land surface temperature from MODIS (day) kelvin land surface temperature from MODIS (night) kelvin enhanced vegetation index - near-infrared reflectance of vegetation - normalized difference water index - plant functional type -\n\nData from the EC dataset that ultimately was used for training the models varied between ~12-14 million site-hours depending on the target variable (i.e. \\(GPP\\), \\(NEE\\), \\(ET\\), or \\(ET_T\\)). Training of the machine learning algorithms was only conducted on hours where all input variables passed quality control. The quality control procedure consisted of two levels, with the first being each hour must have at least one value of good quality measured or gap-filled with confidence (i.e. at least one half hour was either 0 or 1 based on the OneFLUX _QC flags). Second, a set of consistency tests were performed on each used variable to check the consistency both among variables and across sites. As the consistency flags were based on daily aggregates of the meteorological and flux data, entire days were removed if the test indicated inconsistencies among related variables. The consistency flag also checked the relationship between variables across sites, ensuring that the relationships found across the data are coherent. A detailed explanation of these consistency flags can be found in [254].\n\nGlobal Meteorology\n\nFor the generation of global flux maps we used hourly meteorological data from ERA5 global reanalysis products at 0.25° [255]. Variables included air temperature at 2m height, incoming shortwave radiation at the surface, as well as vapour pressure deficit (computed from relative humidity, air temperature, and surface pressure). Units were converted to correspond to the site level measurements which were used for training the machine learning model, and the data were re-gridded to a 0.05° resolution using bilinear interpolation for every hour.\n\nSatellite Earth Observation\n\nThe X-BASE products are based on measurements of the MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of surface reflectance and land surface temperature from collection v006 at daily resolution. Missing records were gap-filled consistently in both the average time series per EC station and in the global gridded data following the procedures of the FluxnetEO data version 2 [29].\n\nSpectral vegetation indices\n\nAt site level we used surface reflectance in the first seven MODIS spectral bands from the MCD43A4 v006 reflectance data set (500 m and daily, where each daily value is inverted from all valid observations within a 16-day window [256]). The spectral vegetation indices computed from the reflectance data were enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [257], the spectral reflectance of vegetation in the near-infrared (NIRv) [258], and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) with MODIS band 7 as reference [259]. We followed the procedure of the FluxnetEO data sets version 2 [29] for data acquisition from Google Earth Engine for all pixels in a cutout of 4x4 km² around each EC station, as well as for quality checks in terms of snow cover, land cover, index values outside the defined ranges, and outliers. An iterative approach then determines both, the strictness of the inversion quality of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF, based on the MCD43A2 data, [260]) and the set of pixels in a cutout that shall represent a given EC station. Supporting information section 0.11.1.1 outlines all technical details of the dynamic procedure.\n\nGlobal data of BRDF-corrected surface reflectance stem from the MCD43C4 v006 data [256], available in a climate modelling grid of 0.05° with the same temporal sampling and subject to the same removal of snow and water pixels and outlier values like at site level. The BRDF quality control of the global data followed the same dynamic approach (see supporting information 0.11.1.1), which maximizes data availability especially in tropical regions.\n\nLand surface temperature\n\nSatellite observations of land surface temperature (LST) were based on the MODIS v006 TERRA observations which are available every day at 1 km resolution [261]. We selected the 1 km² pixel containing a specific tower and treated the two MODIS LST data streams as independent predictor variables which represent clear-sky LST at a specific time of the day (namely around 10.30 AM and PM). Quality checks and gap-filling followed the procedure described in FluxnetEO version 2 [29].\n\nFor the global spatialization of the flux estimates we relied on climate modelling grid LST from the MODIS TERRA data sets [261] and apply consistent quality control and imputation of missing values like at site-level.\n\nLand cover\n\nLand cover information used the IGBP global vegetation classification. Site level classification was as reported by the principal investigators. Global data was based on the yearly-resolved MODIS MCD12Q1 v006 product [262]. In order to ease the transition between site and global land cover classifications, an intermediate classification scheme was utilized which translated each classification into characteristics (e.g. trees, crops, needleleaf, deciduous, etc…) based on whether the classification has (value=1.0), might have (value=0.5), does not have (value=0.0) a specific feature, or is unknown (value=-1.0). A full description of this intermediate classification system can be found in supplementary section 0.11.2.\n\nMachine Learning Method\n\nAll X-BASE products are based on gradient boosted regression trees using the XGBoost library [263]. XGBoost is known as a robust algorithm that is able to handle a variety of variable types (numeric, boolean, categorical). Training was conducted using a two-thirds training sub-sampling ratio and a 0.05 learning rate. Boosting was stopped when no model improvement (based on mean squared error of validation data) was observed for ten consecutive rounds, and the best performing model was stored to generate predictions. In all cases, the model reached the stopping criteria relatively quickly, with the final number of boosting rounds between 80-230, depending on the flux.\n\nCross-validation\n\nAll cross-validation was performed using a 10 fold, leave-site-fold-out scheme, where each fold was constructed by randomly assigning each site to a fold. For each round of cross-validation, eight folds were used for training, one for validation and the remaining one as the test fold for which the actual predictions were made. The leave-site-fold-out scheme ensures that no data from the sites in the test fold were ever seen by the algorithm during training, and in turn iterated such that each site was in the test set once. As eddy covariance sites are sometimes clustered in the same location (e.g. as different treatments) and can therefore be both physically closely located and not truly independent, sites are assigned to the same fold if they are less than 0.05° apart to reduce over-fitting. We evaluate the accuracy of the cross-validation models by computing the Nash-Sutcliffe modelling efficiency (NSE) [264], where a negative NSE indicates a model accuracy that is worse than a mean prediction, while a value close to one indicates high model accuracy. We compute the NSE for each site and for a range of temporal scales from hourly to inter-annual.\n\nUp-scaling\n\nThe final step to train a model to use in the final global prediction step was identical to the training in the cross-validation, with the exception that, because no test fold was required, we used nine of the ten folds for the training and validation was done on the remaining fold. The final trained models (one trained model for each target flux) were then used to predict fluxes at the global scales using the associated globally gridded input variables that correspond to those used at site level, as outlined in Table 2.\n\nPrevious FLUXCOM and independent global flux estimates\n\nWe compare X-BASE with up-scaling results from FLUXCOM [19,20]. As mentioned earlier, FLUXCOM comprised an ensemble of up-scaling experiments that differed in the choice of machine learning method, meteorological forcing data, and which were summarized in two groups of set-ups that shared the same predictor variables and spatiotemporal resolution: The “remote-sensing-only” set-up (RS) mostly used spaceborn observations of MODIS as explanatory variables and produced flux estimates every 8 days at 0.083° resolution, while the `remote-sensing plus meteorology set-up’ (RS+METEO) produced daily flux estimates at half degree resolution from meteorological predictor variables and an average seasonal cycle of satellite observations [19,20,22]. Comparisons to FLUXCOM RS+METEO datasets always refer to the ensemble over multiple machine learning methods for all realizations driven by the ERA5 meteorology [255]. RS+METEO uses average seasonal cycles of MODIS v005 observations. For the FLUXCOM RS set-up we use the ensemble over all machine learning methods. Please note that both the previous RS runs and the X-BASE runs presented here are driven by data from MODIS v006, but the processing is changed in some aspects such as quality control and gap-filling.\n\nFor evaluating X-BASE \\(NEE\\) globally, in particular its seasonal cycle and for different regions, we used two different atmospheric inversion model products: the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) v10 model intercomparison project [265] and the CarboScope inversion [266] version s99oc_v2022 [267]. In each case, as the inversion products estimate net biome exchange, we subtracted from the inversions data fire emissions as estimated by the Global Fire Emissions Database, Version 4.1 [268]. Estimates from the OCO-2 came from the the LNLGIS experiment which combines satellite-based column-averaged \\(CO_2\\) (XCO2) retrievals and in-situ \\(CO_2\\) measurements as observational constraints in the assimilation, and consists of 13 different ensemble members covering the period 2015-2020 with a monthly frequency and 1° spatial resolution (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/OCO2_v10mip/index.php). The CarboScope product consisted of a single inversion output at the same spatial resolution as OCO-2, but a longer temporal period from 2001 to 2020.\n\nWe compared temporal patterns of X-BASE \\(GPP\\) with global retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI instrument [269]. For the comparison we averaged both X-BASE \\(GPP\\) and TROPOMI SIF to a temporal resolution of 16 days and 0.5° spatial grids for the common period 04/2018-12/2020.\n\nX-BASE \\(ET\\) and \\(ET_T\\) were cross-compared with transpiration estimates from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) v3.6a [270,271]. GLEAM also utilizes satellite and reanalysis data sets but in a more physically constrained way, relying on semi-empirical models such as the Priestley and Taylor [272] and Gash models [273]. Further comparisons were made to precipitation data from GPCC [274].\n\nResults\n\nCross-validation and data space\n\nOne important innovation in FLUXCOM-X compared to the previous FLUXCOM ensemble was the training data base, which was larger due to an incease in both number of sites and years. Furthermore, the EC methodology has changed considerably in many aspects ranging from collection and processing to quality filtering in the last 15 years. We show here one illustrative example of the changes in the environmental space that is represented in the training samples for daily \\(NEE\\): between daily VPD and daily incoming shortwave radiation the distribution of training samples was considerably broader in X-BASE compared to the RS+METEO ensemble (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the number of unique sites contributing to a certain VPD-radiation bin has increased (Fig. SI 1), i.e. the number of ecosystems sampled in each climatic condition has also increased. The increases were seen particularly at the margins of the distribution, i.e. for days with high VPD along the full radiation spectrum, and vice versa for days with high radiation conditions along the full VPD spectrum. Remarkably, the number of sites contributing training samples for high VPD and high radiation were observed much more frequently (Fig. 1) and at more sites (Fig. SI 1) compared to RS+METEO - providing more and more varied information for dry conditions.\n\nThe results from the ten-fold cross validation showed an overall high performance with most fluxes and scales of variability having an NSE above 0.6 (Fig. 2). In terms of scales of variability across all fluxes, the monthly mean diel cycle (“diel”) and the daily median seasonal cycle (“seasonal”) were very regular patterns that the trained models reproduced best. Also, among-site changes (“spatial”, except for \\(NEE\\)) and monthly aggregated fluxes (“monthly”) were reliably predicted. Deviations from the median daily seasonality (“anom”) were only moderately reliable with NSE between 0.25 and 0.5. The XGBoost models did not succeed in accurately reproducing inter-annual changes (“i.a.v.”) and between-site patterns in \\(NEE\\). Consistently across all scales, the net fluxes which are directly calculated (i.e., \\(ET\\) and even more so \\(NEE\\)) showed lower performance than their respective modelled gross fluxes (i.e. \\(GPP\\) and \\(ET_{T}\\)). Note that the cross validation results from Fig.@fig:xval_performance cannot be quantitatively compared to previous cross validation results in FLUXCOM as the training data are not the same. However, qualitatively the accuracy gradient among fluxes as well as along scales of variability correspond to patterns identified in FLUXCOM and in comparable empirical modeling activities [18,22,26,27].\n\nGlobal flux estimates\n\nOne asset of FLUXCOM-X is flexibility in the spatiotemporal resolution of the flux estimates. We are producing X-BASE products at 0.05° spatial and hourly temporal resolution globally. Figure 3 illustrates the increase in spatial and temporal detail in X-BASE compared to RS (0.083°, 8-daily) and RS+METEO (0.5°, daily) using the example of \\(NEE\\).\n\nNet Ecosystem Exchange (\\(NEE\\))\n\nThe X-BASE product estimates the global terrestrial \\(NEE\\) to be -5.75 \\(\\pm\\) 0.33 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) (2001-2020), with strong carbon uptake hotpots in the tropical regions, and temperate regions of North America and Europe (Fig. 4). In contrast to both RS and RS+METEO, India and some regions in central Sahel show prominent patterns of a mean carbon flux from the ecosystems to the atmosphere in X-BASE, corresponding mostly to crop designated areas (Fig. SI 2). However, comparing X-BASE global terrestrial \\(NEE\\) to the inversion estimates (corrected for fire emissions based on GFED 4.1 [268]) over the common period (2015-2020) shows agreement of X-BASE (-5.63 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) with OCO-2 (-4.12 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) and CarboScope (-3.46 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)).\n\nComparison with OCO-2 and CarboScope inversions indicates a substantial improvement of the global mean seasonal cycle of \\(NEE\\) (Fig. 5) in X-BASE compared to RS and RS+METEO. The systematic bias present in RS and RS+METEO has essentially disappeared in X-BASE. The shape, and in particular the amplitude, of the global \\(NEE\\) seasonal cycle of X-BASE is more consistent with the inversions. The larger and more realistic seasonal cycle amplitude of global \\(NEE\\) in X-BASE originates primarily from improved and increased amplitudes in boreal regions. Interestingly, X-BASE suggests slightly larger \\(NEE\\) seasonal cycle amplitudes in temperate regions compared to the inversions. In seasonally dry regions, the timing of maximum uptake is consistent between X-BASE and inversions, while the peak of maximum release is larger and delayed in the inversions. In Australia, the peak of \\(CO_2\\) release to the atmosphere at the end of the year present in both inversions is not evident in X-BASE, which instead shows a relatively consistent \\(CO_2\\) flux to the atmosphere throughout the year. In tropical regions, the patterns of seasonal variations are qualitatively consistent between X-BASE and the previous RS and RS+METEO products. The seasonal patterns in tropical regions are relatively weak overall and seem inconsistent both between the inversions and X-BASE as well as among the inversions.\n\nAs seen in Figure 5, the X-BASE product shows the same large underestimation of globally integrated \\(NEE\\) inter-annual variance as the previous RS and RS+METEO products. In terms of temporal trends, the X-BASE products show almost no change in annual \\(NEE\\) in time, which is in contrast to the RS+METEO (slight positive trend) and RS (slight negative trend) and more consistent with the CarboScope inversions (Table SI 3). However, as inter-annual variability was poorly reproduced even in the cross validation (Fig. 2), trends in the X-BASE products should be taken with caution and interpreted with careful scrutiny.\n\nGross Primary Productivity (\\(GPP\\))\n\nX-BASE estimates the globally integrated \\(GPP\\) at 124.7 \\(\\pm\\) 2.1 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) on average in the time period 2001-2020. Globally integrated \\(GPP\\) over vegetated areas (RS and RS+METEO do not have estimates for non-vegetated areas) was approximately equal for X-BASE (121.9 \\(\\pm\\) 2.1 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) and RS+METEO (121.6 \\(\\pm\\) 0.4 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) but considerably higher than RS (113.2 \\(\\pm\\) 1.8 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) over the same period. In terms of regional patterns, X-BASE \\(GPP\\) consistently exceeds both RS+METEO and RS in temperate, boreal, and most subtropical ecosystems, but is lower in sparsely vegetated (semi-)arid regions like southwestern North America as well as southeast Asian croplands (Fig. 6). This qualitatively consistent pattern is only broken in the humid tropics, where X-BASE \\(GPP\\) is higher than RS, but lower than RS+METEO.\n\nComparing the estimated trend over the last two decades, X-BASE \\(GPP\\) has a clear increasing linear trend of 0.34 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-2}\\) which is slightly higher than the trend in RS (0.25 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-2}\\),Table SI 3). In contrast, the RS+METEO product shows nearly no trend in annual \\(GPP\\). The increases in both the X-BASE and RS products may be related to increases in surface greenness coming from variability in the remote sensing forcing data which are inter-annually dynamic in both products, whereas the remote sensing data were not inter-annually dynamic in the RS+METEO product which instead used only the mean seasonal cycle of the remote sensing data. The magnitude of between-year changes in globally integrated X-BASE \\(GPP\\) is 0.575 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) over the years 2001-2020, which is about twice as large as RS+METEO (0.248 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)), but only half the magnitude estimates in the RS set-up (1.02 \\(Pg C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\), Table SI 3).\n\nWe further compared the temporal trajectory in \\(GPP\\) estimates against TROPOMI SIF as an independent proxy for \\(GPP\\) (Fig. 7) at a temporal resolution of 16 days. The temporal variability of X-BASE \\(GPP\\) strongly agrees with that in TROPOMI SIF, with Squared Spearman correlation values (denoted as \\(R^2\\)) of the time series above 0.85 across most of the vegetated land surface (Fig. 7 top left). The only exceptions are regions with no or very small variability in both \\(GPP\\) and SIF such as in either evergreen tropical ecosystems in South America, Africa and southeast Asia, or sparsely to non-vegetated areas due to aridity (e.g. Mexican, and African deserts) or cold conditions (e.g. Canadian and Siberian subpolar regions). In inner Australia, despite being sparsely vegetated, variability between years is expected in \\(GPP\\) due to precipitation increases during La Nina years, which is however not reflected in the squared correlations. \\(R^2\\) for the deviations from the average seasonality (again computed with a temporal resolution of 16 days) show the same qualitative spatial patterns (Fig. 7 top right), but are overall lower with \\(R^2\\) values between 0.55 and 0.8. Anomalies of X-BASE \\(GPP\\) and SIF agree best in eastern European temperate forests as well as grassy and shrub ecosystems in eastern South America.\n\nComparison of the level of agreement of SIF and X-BASE with that of SIF and RS and RS+METEO, respectively, illustrates that X-BASE and RS \\(GPP\\) estimates have comparable consistency both for the time series (global area weighted mean \\(R^2\\) values of 0.72 and 0.73, respectively) and anomalies (global mean \\(R^2\\) values of 0.64 and 0.66, respectively). In contrast, the \\(R^2\\) between RS+METEO and SIF is lower in both cases (\\(R^2\\) values of 0.66 for the time series and 0.58 for anomalies). X-BASE \\(GPP\\) shows a higher agreement with SIF than RS both in terms of the actual trajectory and anomalies in evergreen tropical forests with no or only a very short dry season in the Amazon and Africa, as well as in fully humid parts of southeast Asia (Fig. 7 middle panel). Improvements in X-BASE \\(GPP\\) compared to RS are also consistent in the very continental and polar tundra areas in eastern Siberia, northern Canada and Alaska. Conversely, in arid steppe climates globally, X-BASE \\(GPP\\) variability agrees less with SIF than does RS \\(GPP\\). X-BASE \\(GPP\\) variability is consistently and widespread much more similar to the variability in TROPOMI SIF than RS-METEO \\(GPP\\). Increases in \\(R^2\\) for X-BASE compared to RS+METEO are most pronounced in arid to semi-arid ecosystems (large parts of the Caatinga and Gran Chaco regions on South America, steppe regions in Mexico, southern and eastern Africa, Australia and central Siberia) as well as in global crop regions, especially for the deviations from the seasonality (albeit the magnitude of \\(R^2\\) change is quite variable between regions, Fig. 7 bottom).\n\nWater Vapor Fluxes\n\nGlobally integrated \\(ET\\) amounts to 74.7x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.9x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) for 2001-2020 (Table SI 2) for X-BASE, with the highest rates in the tropics (Fig. 8). Comparing global totals for vegetated areas only (where all products give outputs) shows similar values for X-BASE (68.9x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.9x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)), GLEAM (70.9x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.9x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)) and RS+METEO ((68.3x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.3x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\))) based \\(ET\\) estimates, while the RS based \\(ET\\) is more than 11% higher (78.5x10³ \\(\\pm\\) 0.5x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\), Table SI 2). Particularly in evergreen tropical ecosystems, X-BASE estimates a considerably lower \\(ET\\) than both GLEAM, RS+METEO, and RS (Fig. 8). Furthermore, in the temperate and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, annually integrated X-BASE \\(ET\\) is consistently lower than the other estimates, though the magnitude of the bias is smaller than in the tropical regions. The pattern is only reversed with higher X-BASE \\(ET\\) in the semi-arid and arid ecosystems of the lower and middle latitudes, especially with respect to annual \\(ET\\) in RS+METEO and GLEAM.\n\nComparing to precipitation estimates shows that X-BASE \\(ET\\) greatly exceeds precipitation inputs over large areas, indicating a strong overestimation of X-BASE \\(ET\\) in many arid regions with sparse vegetation (e.g. the Sahara region, Fig. SI 5). While transport of water both laterally and from deeper groundwater could cause \\(ET\\) to exceed precipitation inputs in some areas, the extent of area where \\(ET\\) exceeds precipitation (e.g. the entire Saharah region) and the magnitude of the excess \\(ET\\) (over three times precipitation inputs) indicates a major bias in these areas and is likely due to a lack of EC data in similar ecosystems. As a rough estimate, constraining the X-BASE estimates with precipitation (see supplement section 0.11.8) suggests about 4-6x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) of water is overestimated globally.\n\nThe globally integrated \\(ET_T\\) amounts to 42.6x10³ ± 1.0x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) (2001-2020) in X-BASE, resulting in an average ratio of transpiration to total evaporation of 57.0% ± 0.6% (Table SI 2). In contrast to \\(ET\\), the \\(ET_{T}\\) estimates from X-BASE do not commonly exceed precipitation estimates (Fig. SI 5), which could indicate that because the water vapor flux is more tightly coupled with vegetation the model is able to distinguish that no vegetation corresponds with no transpiration, which is not generally the case for non-transpiration evaporation. The RS and RS+METEO products did not produce \\(ET_{T}\\) estimates, so the comparison is limited to GLEAM (50.7x10³ ± 0.6x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\)), which estimates \\(ET_{T}\\) on average 17% higher than X-BASE, with strong contributions from the evergreen tropics. Only in single semi-arid regions, such as northernmost Sahel as well as large parts of the South American Caatinga and Chaco regions is this pattern reversed (Fig. 8).\n\nSpatially, X-BASE estimated \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) exceeds 50% in the majority of areas, with the highest values seen in the higher latitude regions of Europe and Asia, as well as in subtropical ecosystems (Fig. 8). Arid regions with sparse vegetation show the lowest \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) overall, with values generally below 20%. With 71.4% ± 0.6% over global vegetated surfaces, GLEAM attributes about 10% more of its \\(ET\\) to \\(ET_{T}\\) than does X-BASE (Table SI 2). Regionally, this difference can even reach up to 40%, with the only exception being boreal forests and very dry ecosystems in the Sahel, the Arabian Penisola and central Asia (Fig. 8).\n\nTrends in \\(ET\\), \\(ET_{T}\\) and \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) are positive and exceed the trends seen in all other estimates over the years 2001-2020. Conversely, the magnitude of inter-annual changes in X-BASE \\(ET\\), \\(ET_{T}\\), and \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) is mostly less than half than the variability in GLEAM (Table SI 3). Low inter-annual changes are common to the RS and RS+METEO \\(ET\\) as well.\n\nFigure 9 shows the temporal correlation at 16-daily temporal scale using GLEAM as a reference, showing overall high values of squared correlation between X-BASE and GLEAM \\(ET\\) and \\(ET_T\\) (top and bottom left). Notable exceptions with low correlations are areas with low variability in \\(ET\\) such as the arc of deforestation, very dry areas, and tropical evergreen ecosystems in Africa. Compared to RS+METEO and RS (middle panels left column in Fig. 9), X-BASE \\(ET\\) temporal patterns are more similar to GLEAM \\(ET\\) in many areas, and especially so in areas north of the arc of deforestation and parts of tropical evergreen areas in central Africa and souteast Asia. Conversely, X-BASE \\(ET\\) agrees less well with GLEAM than RS or RS+METEO in the arc of deforestation itself, the eastern parts of the Amazon basin, as well as dry areas. The deviations from the mean annual cycle in \\(ET\\) and \\(ET_{T}\\) (right column) show overall lower correlations than the actual time series, with the highest agreement between GLEAM and X-BASE in large parts of the Amazon forest and central European ecosystems. X-BASE \\(ET\\) anomalies are much more strongly correlated with GLEAM \\(ET\\) than either RS or RS+METEO everywhere except for most (semi-)arid regions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHigher consistency of \\(NEE\\) with atmospheric carbon cycle constraints\n\nAlthough FLUXCOM-X follows the same fundamental approach as FLUXCOM, we find a substantial improvement of the magnitude of the annually integrated \\(NEE\\) of FLUXCOM-X-BASE over previous FLUXCOM products [19] when compared to independent estimates from atmospheric inversions. The mean global X-BASE \\(NEE\\) of -5.75 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) is slightly smaller than the inferred \\(NEE\\) of -3.92 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) (corrected for fire emissions based on GFED 4.1) from CarboScope. The remaining difference could easily be explained by carbon sources such as aquatic evasion and volatile organic compounds that are included in the atmospherically based estimate but not in eddy-covariance based FLUXCOM (see [19] and [21] for further discussion).\n\nThe improved global \\(NEE\\) of FLUXCOM-X-BASE originates most likely from enhanced quality of eddy covariance measurements in the training. Previous up-scaling-based \\(NEE\\) products of [18,19,275] - all based on the La Thuile FLUXNET dataset but varying with respect to machine learning methods, predictor variables, and temporal resolution - consistently estimated a nearly three-fold larger global terrestrial carbon uptake compared to X-BASE. As discussed and speculated in [19], La Thuile likely contained biased \\(NEE\\) measurements, in particular for some tropical sites [276], and together with the sparsity of data in the tropics, these biases were propagated to unrealistic tropical and global \\(NEE\\) estimates. The fact that we can now reconcile bottom-up global eddy-covariance-based \\(NEE\\) and estimates from top-down atmospheric inversions is a major achievement of the FLUXNET community. For context: 1 \\(Pg \\, C \\cdot yr^{-1}\\) over the global vegetated area (\\(145 \\times 10^{6} km^2\\)) corresponds to ~7 \\(g \\, C \\cdot m^2 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\), which marks a challenge for achieving such accuracy of mean \\(NEE\\) at any one flux tower site. The lesson learned here emphasizes once more that it is crucial to control for and minimize systematic biases of in-situ eddy covariance measurements [277].\n\nThe improved seasonality of X-BASE \\(NEE\\), in particular for boreal regions, likely also results from enhanced information in the training data due to the hourly resolution. Similar improvements were observed in [275] who extended RS+METEO by training on half-hourly flux observations. The hourly resolution improves the seasonal high-latitude \\(NEE\\) likely due to better capturing the responses to light when daylength varies strongly.\n\nNew opportunities by X-BASE products\n\nThe improvements of \\(NEE\\) make X-BASE attractive as a data-driven biogenic prior for atmospheric inversions [278]. Moreover, its hourly resolution facilitates better integration in inversion systems due to the accounting of diurnal flux and atmospheric transport variations, while its high spatial variations can provide patterns of flux variations that cannot be resolved by atmospheric constraints alone.\n\nFor the first time, X-BASE includes a global data-driven product of ecosystem transpiration. The estimated global \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) ratio of 57% is consistent with independent top-down assessments from isotope base methods [279,280] and past up- scaling estimates [281,282]. The spatially and temporally high resolution data-driven X-BASE \\(ET_{T}\\) product provides a valuable complementary perspective to simulations from process-based land surface models, which show large disagreements and often indicate global \\(ET_{T}/ET\\) below 50% [283,284]. This advancement opens new opportunities for large scale studies of carbon- water relations on a diurnal time scale. The generation of the X-BASE \\(ET_{T}\\) product was facilitated by the development of site-level evapotranspiration partitioning methods [252,285] underlining once more the importance of advances by the FLUXNET community for Earth system science.\n\nTackling persistent challenges\n\nNex to these improvements and opportinities, we find that some key issues previously identified in FLUXCOM [19,22,275] persist in X-BASE. These include the insufficient representation of water-related effects, the limited predictability of the spatial patterns of mean \\(NEE\\), as well as severe limitations with respect to the variability between years and over decades. The overestimation of mean \\(ET\\) in very dry, sparsely vegetated areas (Fig. SI 5), as well as the poorer consistency of \\(NEE\\) seasonality with inversions in water limited regions (Fig. 5) illustrate the persistent challenge and importance of capturing water effects on land-atmosphere flux variations. For \\(GPP\\) temporal patterns we find that X-BASE shows improved agreement with SIF in water limited regions compared to RS+METEO (Fig. 7), which is likely because X-BASE uses concomitantly changing remote sensing observations opposed to a mean seasonal cycle only in RS+METEO. However, X-BASE shows deteriorated agreement with SIF when compared to RS, even though X-BASE was trained on hourly flux observations with improved coverage of dry conditions (Fig. 1). This decrease in performance indicates clearly the importance and uncertainty related to the predictor variable set for capturing water related effects. Thus, there is considerable potential for advancements by including remote sensing based predictors on soil moisture, sub-daily varying land surface temperature from geostationary satellites, SIF, and vegetation optical depth. Here, a key challenge resides in achieving a sensible integration of flux observations with footprints that are much smaller than corresponding Earth observation products.\n\nMissing predictor variables is likely also a main reason for the limited skill of predicting between site variability of mean \\(NEE\\) (Fig. 2), which can depends on legacy effects of disturbances and management that are not accounted for. Novel and complementary Earth observation products that characterise ecosystem structure and states related to biomass and canopy heights from SAR and LIDAR should help raising the accuracy of FLUXCOM-X based mean \\(NEE\\) in future efforts. X-BASE shows a prominent pattern of carbon flux to the atmosphere in sub-tropical and crop dominated regions of India and the Sahel, which emphasizes the need to improve in-situ data coverage for agricultural systems, especially outside the temperate zone, and including important meta-data to better characterize these ecosystems and their site history. Despite the greatly reduced overall bias of mean \\(NEE\\), we emphasize that X-BASE products are pre-mature for diagnosing spatial variations of mean \\(NEE\\).\n\nThe representation of longer term dynamics remains an area with opportunity for improvements in X-BASE. Inter-annual variability is still poorly reproduced in cross validation (Fig. 2), particularly for \\(NEE\\), which is likely not only due to the complexity of processes shaping inter-annual variations but also due to temporal discontinuities in flux tower time series related to changes in instrumentation and factors like management [254] that are not accounted for. The complexities of relying on field deployed instrumentation, together with the uncertainties related to linking satellite and flux data, causes poor signal to noise ratios and may impede good cross-validation results for i.a.v.. Globally, comparisons of X-BASE with inversions reveal an underestimated inter-annual variance and a poor correlation for global \\(NEE\\) i.a.v. (Fig. 5 and Table SI 3). Interestingly, X-BASE \\(GPP\\) shows improved correspondence with SIF anomalies compared to RS+METEO, especially in water limited regions (Fig. 7) while no such improvement is evident for global \\(NEE\\), which is likely due to the compensatory water effects in the global \\(NEE\\) signal [286]. That a comparison of RS+METEO runs with different meteorological forcing data showed the weakest correspondence with inversion i.a.v. when using ERA-5 [19] explains the substantially better correlations of RS+METEO with inversions for \\(NEE\\) i.a.v. in earlier studies [19,286], and may also explain the poor correlation of X-BASE. Thus, testing if alternative meteorological forcing data can improve global \\(NEE\\) i.a.v. for X-BASE is an important next step. It remains unclear at this point if accurate inter-annual variations at site-level and globally can be achieved by the FLUXCOM approach in the near future. Additional constraints beyond FLUXNET such as atmospheric \\(CO_2\\) measurements [287] or theoretical considerations in the form of hybrid models [288] are promising and such endeavours should be fostered.\n\nConclusion & Outlook\n\nWe presented X-BASE, a new set of global high-resolution data-driven products of land-atmosphere fluxes from the FLUXCOM approach. This represents a cornerstone of our developments of the FLUXCOM-X framework designed to explore and mitigate current limitations to up-scaling from site to global scale. Improvements of the eddy covariance data facilitated reconciling estimates of global terrestrial net carbon exchange from X-BASE with top-down atmospheric inversions, and allowed for the first time the generation of a global data-driven estimate of ecosystem transpiration. Beyond fostering all activities to enhance quality and coverage of available flux tower observations, most promise for future advancements by FLUXCOM-X relates to the synergistic exploitation of complementary satellite data streams to better capture water-related, site-history, and management effects. This will be challenging as it requires developing strategies and methodologies to better integrate in-situ flux observations and spaceborn Earth observations with very heterogeneous acquisition properties and with spatial resolutions that are often very coarse compared to flux tower footprints. The recent de-orbiting of the TERRA spacecraft requires employing alternative satellite missions where practical issues of data acquisition and conceptual issues related to temporal consistency and reduced overlap with FLUXNET records pose imminent challenges. With FLUXCOM-X we have prepared the ground for tackling these challenges which can facilitate up-to-date and accurate flux estimates and thereby contribute to increased understanding of the Earth system in the future.\n\nData Availability\n\nAll data is available as aggregated NetCDF file formats, to ease data handling for common use cases, from the ICOS Carbon Portal [doi:10.18160/5NZG-JMJE?].

Given that the actual flux footprints are not generally available or computable for lack of critical information, we assume that the pixel containing the actual EC station (the `tower pixel’) is most representative for the dynamics of the area of influence on a tower. However, data availability and quality in the tower pixel is often insufficient. An iterative approach therefore selects both the cutout size and the strictness of the BRDF inversion quality from within defined bounds in a way that maximizes data availability and that ensures representativeness of the spatially averaged time series for the given site at the same time. In more detail, we start with a strict criterion for BRDF inversion quality (BRDF_Albedo_Band_Quality_Bandx flag in MCD43A2 <= 2, meaning only full inversions). Then three options regarding the cutout size are considered:\n\nonly the tower pixel,\n\nthose 20% of pixels within 4x4 km² around a tower that are best correlated with the tower pixel are linearly regressed against the tower pixel and subsequently spatially averaged,\n\nthe 25% of pixels within a 4x4 km² area that are closest to the tower are averaged with the inverse of the distance to the tower as weight.\n\nThe criteria for selection between options A-C is based on the number of available good quality observations n in the resulting spatial average time series per site as follows:\n\nif (n_A >= 60 %) & (n_B <= 70 %): select A elif (n_A >= 60 %) & (n_B >= 70 %): select B elif (n_A < 60 %) & (n_A > 15 %): select B else: select C\n\nIf after the previous steps still less than 40% of good quality observations outside of snow covered times are available in the resulting average time series for a given site and index, the BRDF inversion quality threshold is relaxed to also allow magnitude inversions (MCD43A2 BRDF inversion quality flag <= 3), and the procedure to select the pixels contributing to the average described above is repeated. Consequently, the size of the area that a MODIS reflectance time series represents varies between sites, and so does the BRDF inversion quality.\n\nFor the global gridded MODIS data, the BRDF inversion quality is consistently selected as <=2 or <=3 based on the number of available good quality observations in a pixel.\n\nDetails on the treatment of land cover information\n\nLand cover information was passed through an intermediary classification system to both act as an encoding mechanism and to allow for arbitrary links between classification schemes. Rather than simple true/false classification for each category, different attributes are classified based on whether the classification has (value=1.0), might have (value=0.5), does not have (value=0.0) a specific feature, or is unknown (value=-1.0). In the specific case of the MCD12Q1 classificaiton scheme, the conversion is as seen in Table SI 1.\n\nAdditional cross-validation results\n\nLarge carbon uptake in tropical croplands\n\nGlobal magnitude of all fluxes\n\nLinear trends and inter-annual variability for all fluxes\n\nComparison of X-BASE to RS+METEO ensemble\n\nPotential overestimation of \\(ET\\) in dryland areas\n\nMaps in Fig. SI 5 show the extend where \\(ET\\) and \\(ET_T\\) exceed precipitation as the ratio between the total of each flux to total precipitation (from GPCC [274]). Overall, X-BASE \\(ET\\) largely exceeds precipitation in most dry, sparsely vegetated areas, indicating overestimation. In contrast, \\(ET_T\\) does not show such extensive overestimation, limited instead to only smaller regions of the Sahara.\n\nThe amount of overestimation of X-BASE \\(ET\\) can be roughly estimated by replacing areas where annual \\(ET\\) exceeds precipitation inputs with the corresponding annual precipitation inputs for each grid cell, i.e. replacing areas where the \\(ET/precip\\) ratio is more than a threshold with the precipitation rather than the estimated \\(ET\\). Using thresholds from 1.25 to 2.5 gives an excess of \\(ET\\) (i.e. original \\(ET\\) minus precipitation corrected) from 3.9x10³ to 6.1x10³ \\(km^3 \\cdot yr^{-1}\\).\n\nReferences"
