        "text": "Dawazhenzha in Ya'an, Sichuan—A recommended destination for self-driving tours around Chengdu!\n\nI finally came to the other side of the Anywhere Door, Sichuan*Ya'an If you go to Chengdu, you must take a trip to Ya'an! 🌟Highlights: The place I want to recommend is the Dawazhenzha scenic area, where I witnessed the most stunning sunrise I have ever seen. At the top of the mountain, you can see different sceneries in all directions, including snow-capped mountains, a sea of clouds, the sun shining on the golden mountain, vast green grasslands, and prayer flags fluttering in the wind... The scenic area is suitable for self-driving. The winding mountain roads can be a bit challenging for beginners, but it's worth it! The homestay I stayed at was the Dawazhenzha Chujian Mountain Lodge Hotel, which is inexpensive and has good facilities and scenery. In the autumn, the owner even let us pick apples to eat. 📝Note tips: Additionally, to see the sunrise, you really have to get up very early. I think I got up just before 5 am. It takes about 5 minutes to drive from the homestay to the entrance of the scenic area. It's very dark and foggy in the morning, so be careful. After entering the park, you will take a bus to the mountain trailhead. At the trailhead, you can choose to take the scenic area's shuttle bus to the top of the mountain (there is a fee, except for the elderly, pregnant women, etc.), or you can hike to the top yourself. It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk to the top with stops, but due to the high altitude, those with poor physical fitness should choose the shuttle bus. Finally, a reminder that the weather here is really unpredictable. The weather forecast the day before was for overcast skies, but we entered the park anyway, hoping for the best. By the time we reached the trailhead, it had started to rain heavily. Surprisingly, we still saw the sunrise when it got light. However, when we returned to the homestay, the owner told us that it had been foggy below and there was no sun\n\nQuintessentialEphs\n\nA place where you can watch a fairyland on earth\n\nOMG! Everyone in the circle of friends is freaking out, do you know why? Because the super plan for the May Day holiday is here! 🚀💨 It's time to put everything aside, pack your bags, and join me in chasing the breathtaking sunrise and the ethereal sea of clouds! 🌄💖 Our destination is quite prestigious - Dawazhenzha and Shenmulei! 🗻 Dawazhenzha, doesn't the name sound like that of a hero? That's right, it's the 'beautiful holy mountain'! Imagine, standing on the viewing platform at an altitude of 3900 meters, you and I seem to become explorers on Mount Everest. 🏔️ Then there's Shenmulei, a national-level forest park, where every tree seems to be telling an ancient story, and every breath of fresh air is refreshing. This place is truly a sanctuary for nature lovers! 🌲🌈 Alright, let me take you through our amazing itinerary: On the first day, we set off from Chengdu, heading west all the way to Ya'an! The scenery along the way will definitely dazzle you. Then, we arrive at Shenmulei, where we'll have lunch, how about a picnic with the scent of phytoncides? In the afternoon, we continue our journey, delving into Qiaoqi Tibetan Village to experience authentic Tibetan culture. At night, we'll dream under the starry sky. 🚙🌠 Are you looking forward to the second day's morning? We have to get up in the dark and rush to Dawazhenzha, all for that breathtaking sunrise. Just think, the sun slowly climbing up from the horizon, with the sea of clouds tumbling beneath... Wow! During the day, we'll enjoy ourselves on the mountain, letting the wind blow away all worries. After descending, we'll head home, ending this unforgettable journey. 🌅🌟 As for special experiences, besides the beautiful sunrise, there's also the dazzling starry night waiting for you. Lying in the Tibetan village, counting the stars, you might even make a wish! 😉 But, don't forget a few things: - Weather, check it in advance, don't let the clouds block our sunrise. - Physical strength, save up in advance, after all, we are mountain climbers. - Getting up early, well, no need to mention this, we are going to watch the sunrise. - And environmental protection, nature has given us so much beauty, we should also take care of her, right? Alright, after saying so much, are you already impatient? Then pack your bags quickly, and join me on this spontaneous journey! 🎒🛣️ ✨🛤️🔥\n\nNOELLE CURRY\n\nSichuan self-driving tour, watching the sunrise, snow-capped mountains, sea of clouds, and stars, I also want to go to Dawa Gengzha\n\nSichuan is a great place, once you go, you want to go again. 'Not entering Sichuan when young, not leaving Shu when old,' speaks of everyone's love for Sichuan. I took the kids to Sichuan twice, once strolling through Chengdu's Wide and Narrow Alleys, visiting the zoo to see giant pandas, entering Sichuan University, and exploring ancient towns... One year, I took the kids to Leshan to see the Giant Buddha, to Meishan to eat Dongpo pork, to Kangding to feel the plateau, and to Bipeng Gorge for a close encounter with pandas🐼. When asked about the places the second child visited in childhood, there is little memory due to being young. Recently, I've been wanting to travel to Sichuan. One year, Ena and Zhe were boarding, and the couple went to Dawa Gengzha in Sichuan, watching the stars, sea of clouds, snow-capped mountains, sunrise... and the beautiful autumn scenery, which still looks like a dream, breathtakingly beautiful. Stealing half a day of leisure, one autumn I went to Dawa Gengzha in Baoxing County, Ya'an, Sichuan. It is a Tibetan township where you can see the starry sky, sea of clouds, sunrise, and snow-capped mountains... Because during the National Day holiday, a friend's family had been there and experienced wind, rain, snow... but did not see the starry sky and sea of clouds, as seeing them is a matter of fate. When they heard we were going to Chengdu, they insisted on taking us to see that beautiful place. Fortunately, the weather was good during the two days we went, and we just saw all of these... Perhaps this is a blessing, a silent prayer, a gift from heaven. Here's an introduction: Dawa Gengzha Scenic Area is located within Garze Tibetan Township in Baoxing County, Ya'an City, Sichuan Province, covering an area of nearly 50 square kilometers, with the highest peak at 3866 meters above sea level, part of the Qionglai Mountain Range, with high terrain in the north and low in the south, known as 'Asia's best 360° viewing platform.' Dawa Gengzha means 'beautiful sacred mountain' in Tibetan, and the area offers views of famous mountains such as the Four Girls Mountain to the north, Pagela Mountain to the south, Gongga Peaks to the west, and Mount Emei to the east. It is also known for its sea of clouds, sunrise, Buddha's light, rime, meadows, lakes, canyons, peaks, highland azaleas, Tibetan villages, and other landscapes. With hands that can pick stars, sea of clouds, sunrise, snow-capped mountains... To see these, we stayed in a Tibetan family's home near Dawa Gengzha the night before. The enthusiastic brother treated us with good wine and meat. Talking to him, he raised many free-range sheep, pigs, and dairy cows, and his wife performed in the county town. The next morning, just after 4 a.m., we set off for the summit of Dawa Gengzha. When we arrived, we could see the stars; it was just that the temperature at the summit was low, a bit too cold; slowly, the sea of clouds rose, and after sunrise, we could see the opposite snow-capped mountains. It was truly beautiful, indescribable in words. The sunrise at Dawa Gengzha in Ya'an, Sichuan, is very beautiful. For photography-loving Dad Zhe, it's never enough to shoot, and he accidentally fell. I was really afraid he would fall off the mountain. The mountain top is slippery, be careful of falling, safety first! Seeing those, I couldn't help but greet in my heart: Good morning, sea of clouds; good morning, sunrise; good morning, Buddha's light; good morning, snow-capped mountains; good morning, nature... This Tibetan-inhabited place under Baoxing, Ya'an, Sichuan, Dawa Gengzha, is truly a treasure of a tourist destination. The scenery is beautiful, the Buddha's light shines everywhere, facing the sun, it's very comfortable, very beautiful. Any random shot is a beautiful view. Beautiful Ya'an, Sichuan, with its lovely lakes, red and dotted autumn colors, truly beautiful. There, the air is better than in the city, filled with the scent of happiness. It's not enough to go several times, like the time we went to Bipeng Gorge to see the giant pandas, attracted by the mountains, water, and cute pandas. A person should always have pursuits in life to be optimistic, sunny, and have positive energy. Thanks to friends for their company, every time I go to Sichuan, they warmly welcome me, either staying at their home, with Sichuan cuisine at will: boiled fish, boiled pork slices... all hand-made! From the top of Dawa Gengzha, you can see famous mountains in all directions, such as the Four Girls Mountain to the north, Pagela Mountain to the south, and enjoy various natural landscapes such as sea of clouds, golden mountain lit by the sun, Buddha's light, starry sky, and more. It's really worth a visit, and if you like nature and a peaceful environment, this place is definitely worth a visit, and I hope to bring the kids here someday. Travel, for me, is a way to recharge. When you go out to play, relax and let go, work is not so much of a concern, and the pressure is not so great. The vast world, facing the open view, beautiful scenery, is a way to relieve stress, and people become comfortable, natural... I hope the future will be more and more beautiful😊.\n\nPathfindingParadise\n\nJiajin Mountain, the first snow mountain crossed by the Red Army during the Long March; Qiaoqi Lake; Red Army Umbrella\n\n1️⃣ 'Jiajin Mountain' means towering and steep mountain in Tibetan. The local folk song says, 'Birds can't fly over it, and people can't climb it.' In June 1935, the brave Red Army conquered it, but many soldiers stayed here forever. 2️⃣ Leaving Dengchigou and continuing north, the mountains become more majestic. After an hour's drive, we arrived at Qiaoqi Lake at the foot of Jiajin Mountain. This lake was formed by the construction of the Qiaoqi Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the Baoxing River in 2002. At the southern end of Qiaoqi Lake, a green pine tree guards the Red Army tomb beneath it, with red ribbons fluttering in the wind on its trunk. This is the 'Red Army Umbrella.' Back then, Tibetan compatriots spontaneously buried the unburied remains of Red Army soldiers here and planted a green pine tree above them. Every year, they tie red scarves and khatas to commemorate them. Ninety years later, the tree has grown tall like an umbrella, and the Red Army tomb remains intact, with white chrysanthemums offered in remembrance. To the north of Qiaoqi Lake, the 'Monument to the Red Army Crossing Jiajin Mountain' stands solemnly, facing north and south. Surrounded by green mountains and clear waters with red stars dotted around, looking back at the heroic days of the past, I can't help but feel a surge of passion: the clear wind shines on a sunny day, the clear water ripples, and the pine waves remain the same. 3️⃣ Tomorrow we will cross Jiajin Mountain. It's still early, so we drive to the Shenmulei Scenic Area to calm our excited hearts. Shenmulei is a meadow under the Pagra Sacred Mountain, at an altitude of about 2700 meters. The original redwood forest and alpine meadows in the scenic area are suitable for quiet walks, but the facilities need improvement. Compared to the lakeside, it seems a bit plain. I am Anxiang Yingxiu, sharing stories in the scenery with you.\n\naveline_\n\nBaoxing in Ya'an is a more suitable alternative to the Western Sichuan Plateau for babies with general physique!\n\nThere are three spots in total: Qiaoqi Lake, Shenmulei, and Dawagengzha, all of which are very close. You only need a little more than one day to visit, with the highest altitude being over 3800 meters. I didn't see anyone with altitude sickness, so a weekend trip is completely OK. The green lake, snow-capped mountains, streams, waterfalls, and fir trees, you can see all of these here. Although the grandeur of the scenery is not comparable to Western Sichuan, it is closer and without the risk of altitude sickness. Leisurely itinerary option one Day 1: Depart at 8-9 am, Chengdu-Qiaoqi Lake-Shenmulei-Dawagengzha entrance for accommodation Day 2: Wake up at 4 am, walk to Dawagengzha to take the scenic area bus to the mountain top, walk on the plank road, wait to watch the sunrise, and descend around 8 am, leisurely return to Chengdu. Tight schedule option two Day 1: Depart at 5 pm, Chengdu-Dawagengzha entrance for accommodation, stroll around and have a barbecue in the evening Day 2: Wake up at 4 am, walk to Dawagengzha to take the scenic area bus up the mountain, walk on the plank road, wait to watch the sunrise, and descend around 8 am, pass by Qiaoqi Lake on the way to Shenmulei, play for 20-30 minutes, then to Shenmulei, play for 2-3 hours. You can return to Chengdu before 2 pm. The third option is if you don't watch the sunrise, there's no need to stay there, and you can go back and forth in one day.\n\nAstraeusNyxhaven567.\n\nJiajin Mountain, the first snow mountain crossed by the Red Army during the Long March; Qiaoqi Lake; Red Army Umbrella\n\n1️⃣ 'Jiajin Mountain' means towering and steep mountain in Tibetan.
