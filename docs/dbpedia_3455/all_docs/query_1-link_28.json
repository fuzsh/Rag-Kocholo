Previous studies overlooked the differences between the pores and throats, mainly focusing on pore analysis. This work aims to analyze the pore structure and petrophysical properties of the reservoir using various methods. The study utilized the constant velocity mercury intrusion method to quantify pores and throats separately. Scanning electron microscopy and casting thin section techniques characterize the pore and throat morphology. The analysis compares the pore structures in reservoirs with different petrophysical properties. Additionally, pore and throat types are classified based on fractal dimensions, and factors influencing their development are discussed. Results reveal feldspar lithic sandstone as the predominant rock type with a low compositional maturity. The sandstone reservoirs exhibit low porosity (10.23%) and ultralow permeability (0.99 mD). Primary reservoir pore spaces include intergranular pores, dissolution pores, and microfractures. Pore radius averages at 195.32 μm, while throat radius is 3.76 μm. Pore structures are categorized as micropore small-throat, small-pore small-throat, and large-pore coarse-throat types. The study area generally exhibits a high pore-to-throat ratio, impacting reservoir petrophysical properties significantly. Pore development is primarily influenced by early diagenesis, organic acid dissolution, and hydrocarbon filling. Weak compaction and cementation transformations provide a material and spatial basis for the subsequent dissolution. The presence of thick organic-rich mudstone above and below the reservoir contributes to organic acid dissolution and hydrocarbon filling.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDeep oil and gas resource exploration has gained significant attention worldwide since the United States first ventured into this domain in 1952.1 Over 70 countries have embarked on exploring deep oil and gas resources, making it a prominent and challenging area in the oil and gas industry.2−4 China holds promising prospects for deep oil and gas exploration.5 At present, the proven oil geological reserves of ultradeep fractured-vuggy reservoirs in the Tarim Basin are 4.8 × 108 t, and the natural gas reserves of ultradeep carbonate rocks in the paleo-uplift of the central Sichuan Basin are 1 × 1012 m3.6 As a result of the relentless efforts of previous explorers, China has achieved several important discoveries in deep oil and gas exploration.7−10\n\nIn China, deep reservoirs are generally defined as those buried below 3000 m.1,3,11 However, the specific depth range for deep, high-quality clastic reservoirs varies across different regions in China.1,3 Typically, it is categorized into three parts: the eastern fault basin, with burial depths ranging from 3000 m to 3500 m; the central craton basin, with depths ranging from 3500 m to 4500 m; and the western compressional basin, with depths exceeding 4500 m.12−14 The Yin’e Basin, situated in central and western Inner Mongolia, is a small fault basin. Therefore, the definition of deep oil and gas should belong to the first category, buried depth of 3000 to 3500 m. Despite over 60 years of oil and gas exploration in the basin, the level of exploration and development in the Guaizihu sag area remains relatively low. It was not until 2018 that 3D seismic surveys and exploration wells were deployed throughout the region.15−17 In recent years, drilling activities in the Guaizihu Sag of the Yin’e Basin have shown promising results in terms of deep oil and gas resources, yielding significant oil flow. This confirms the substantial exploration potential of the deep reservoirs in the Bayingobi Formation within the Guaizihu Sag.18 The petrophysical properties and permeability of the reservoir are closely related to the complex pore structure within the rock. Therefore, characterizing the pore structure of the reservoir is a crucial research objective in the exploration and development of deep sandstone oil and gas resources.19,20\n\nIn the study of the relationship between reservoir quality and pore structure, various testing methods have been developed including scanning electron microscopy, X-CT, mercury intrusion, N2 adsorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance. These methods provide technical support for characterizing reservoir pore structure and understanding its relationship with reservoir quality.21−23 The research methods for pore structure can be divided into two categories: direct observation methods such as CT and scanning electron microscopy, and indirect measurement methods such as mercury intrusion, N2 adsorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance.24 Combining different technical methods, such as mercury intrusion and nuclear magnetic resonance or CT and nuclear magnetic resonance, enables quantitative and comprehensive characterization of pore structure, which is currently a hot research topic. With the advancement of pore size distribution characterization, numerous pore structure classification schemes have been proposed.23,25,26 Therefore, in the process of quantifying and characterizing the pore structure, it is essential to employ appropriate technical means and classification schemes, as well as multiple methods for comprehensive characterization. In addition to the development of technical means, fractal theory27 provides a theoretical basis for studying the pore structure. It has been demonstrated that the distribution of pores and throats in rocks exhibits fractal characteristics.24,28−30 Fractal dimension can characterize the complexity of rock pore structure and evaluate rock heterogeneity.31,32 Previous studies have primarily focused on the pore properties. In this study, we employ the constant-rate mercury intrusion method and scanning electron microscopy to distinguish pores and throats and then combine fractal theory to classify pore structures based on direct observation and indirect measurement. This comprehensive approach allows for a more accurate evaluation of the different pore structure characteristics. Furthermore, it facilitates a deeper analysis of the causes behind different pore structures and reveals the significance of these structures in oil and gas accumulation.\n\nIn this study, the utilization of a constant-rate mercury injection method overcomes limitations associated with conventional mercury injection technology. It allows for accurate determination of important parameters such as the pore radius, throat radius, and pore-throat radius ratio. Additionally, it provides capillary pressure curves for both the pores and throats. This method is particularly suitable for studying low-porosity and low-permeability sandstone reservoirs with varying pore-throat properties. From a microscopic perspective, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the petrological characteristics, petrophysical properties, reservoir space types, and pore structure characteristics of deep sandstone reservoirs in the first and second members of the Bashan Formation. We also examined the main factors influencing the petrophysical properties of these reservoirs. The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the pore structure characteristics of deep tight sandstone reservoirs and hold theoretical significance for guiding the exploration of oil and gas resources in the study area.\n\n2. Geological Setting\n\nYin’e Basin is located in the west of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with an area of about 12 × 104 km2 ( a). Geographically, the south is Beida Mountain-Yabulai Mountain, the north is outer Mongolia and Honggerji Mountain-Menggenwula Mountain, the east is Langshan-Halawu Mountain, and the west is bound by Beishan Mountain. Tectonically, it is located at the junction of the four plates of Tarim, Kazakhstan, Siberia, and North China. The tectonic and sedimentary environment of the basin is complex, and it is the main component of the Tianshan-Xing’anling orogenic system. The basin belongs to the Mesozoic-Cenozoic fault-depression superimposed basin, which is developed and formed on the basis of the Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement and Paleozoic fold basement. It has experienced different evolution stages, such as plate tectonic evolution, intraplate extension, and intracontinental orogeny. According to the previous division scheme,33 the basin can be divided into “five uplifts and seven depressions”, namely, Juyanhai Depression, Lvyuan Uplift, Wutaohai Depression, Trossie Beach Uplift, Dagu Depression, Zongnaishan Uplift, Chulu Uplift and Benbatu Uplift, Suhongtu Depression, Suhaitu Depression, Shangdan Depression, and Chagandelsu Depression ( b). Located in the north of the Dagu Depression, the Guizihu Depression is a Mesozoic Cenozoic depression developed on the Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement and Paleozoic fold basement. It is adjacent to the Suhongtu Depression in the east, Wutaohai Depression in the west, and Zongnaishan Uplift and Honggeji Mountain in the south and north, respectively. The sag is generally in a northeast-southwest trend, and the fractures are mainly developed in the fault depression period. The middle sag fractures are distributed in the north–northeast direction, and the south sag fractures are distributed in the north–northeast and north–south direction. On the plane, from the northeast to the southwest, they are, respectively, the north sag belt, the middle sag belt, and the south sag belt ( c). Vertically, they include the lower fault sag layer and the upper sag layer. Each sampling well is located in the central area of the Guizihu sag.\n\nIn the Guizihu Sag, Cretaceous sediments are predominantly present and can be further divided into several formations. From bottom to top, these formations include the Bayingobi Formation, Suhongtu Formation, Yingen Formation of the Lower Cretaceous, and Ulansuhai Formation of the Upper Cretaceous. The contact between the Bayingobi Formation and the basement Paleozoic metamorphic rocks represents a regional unconformity interface at the bottom. This interface indicates an unconformable contact between the Cretaceous sediments and underlying rocks. On the other hand, the top interface of the Bayingobi Formation exhibits a local unconformable contact with the Suhongtu Formation. This contact is characterized by cutting erosion and overriding in the marginal area of the basin, as described by Yang et al.16 Within the Bayingobi Formation, there are two members: Ba 1 Member and Ba 2 Member. Furthermore, Ba 1 and Ba 2 members can be divided into three or four subgroups ( ). During the sedimentary period of Ba 1, the climate was humid, which promoted the development of source rocks in the Guaizihu Sag, as noted by Hou et al.18 The lithology of the Ba 1 member mainly consists of gray pebbly mudstone and pebbly sandstone at the bottom, transitioning to dark gray and black mudstone and shale in the middle and upper parts. These lithologies are characteristics of delta front deposition. The boundary faults in the sedimentary period of the Ba 2 Member are relatively developed ( d). These lithologies are characteristics of delta front deposition. In the sedimentary period of the Ba 2 Member, boundary faults are relatively well-developed, as depicted in d. The lithology of the Ba 2 Member includes interbedding of dark gray mudstone and glutenite at the bottom, representing the sedimentation of the middle fan of the lake floor fan. In the middle part, there is interbedding of gray and dark gray mudstone and fine sandstone, which corresponds to sedimentation in the front of the discriminant river delta. The Suhongtu Formation is situated above the Bayingobi Formation and is divided into the lower and upper parts. The lower part is primarily composed of interbedding of purplish-red mudstone and gray argillaceous siltstone, while the upper part consists of purplish-red mudstone, gray fine sandstone, and gray siltstone. These lithologies indicate a shore shallow lake facies environment. The Yingen Formation comprises two members: Yin 1 Member and Yin 2 Member. The lithology of the Yin 1 Member mainly consists of gray and dark gray mudstone, along with dolomitic mudstone, representing shallow lake facies and semishallow lake facies. The lithology of the Yin 2 Member includes purplish-red and brownish-yellow mudstone, as well as light gray argillaceous siltstone, indicating a transition from diffuse lake to shallow lake facies. Lastly, the Ulansuhai Formation is characterized by brownish-red mudstone, which represents overtopping lake facies ( ).\n\n3. Samples and Methods\n\n3.1. Samples\n\nIn the experiment, a total of 13 samples were collected from the Ba 2 Member, and all of them consist of sandstone lithology. The porosity of the samples ranges from 5.12% to 15.33% with an average porosity of 10.23%. These values indicate that the sandstone reservoirs in the Bayingobi Formation have a low porosity. The permeability of the samples ranges from 0.08 to 3.43mD, with an average permeability of 0.99 mD. Based on the permeability values, the samples were divided into four groups for easier characterization of the sandstone characteristics. Class I samples have a permeability of less than 0.50 mD, class II samples have a permeability between 0.50 and 1.00 mD, class III samples have a permeability between 1.00 and 2.00 mD, and class IV samples have a permeability greater than 2.00 mD. To represent each group, four representative samples were selected and labeled as Sample A, Sample B, Sample C, and Sample D in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\nclasssamplememberrepresentative sampledepth (m)porosity (%)permeability (mD)Igc1-5K1b2234205.750.22g4-5K1b2231275.120.08g7-1K1b24319711.280.46g7-5K1b23A34905.630.08g11-1K1b2232779.80.36IIgc1-10K1b23342914.431g6-11K1b23B36319.770.99g11-4K1b24328211.080.64g11-7K1b24328312.440.82IIIgc1-7K1b23344510.091.97g7-4K1b22C333211.821.03g7-6K1b24349210.481.73IVgc1-3K1b24D343415.333.43\n\n3.2. Experimental Methods\n\nWe used the ASPE-730 instrument produced by the American Core-test Systems company to carry on the constant speed mercury injection experiment. The experimental steps are as follows: First, a standard core with a diameter of 2.5 cm was drilled and dried after washing oil; then the porosity and permeability of the standard core. Then, the rock sample was vacuumed and immersed in mercury solution, and mercury was injected into the rock core at a very low constant speed (0.00005 mL/min). During the mercury injection process, the pressure drops-rises periodically, and the experiment ended when the pressure reached 900 psi (about 6.2 MPa). The basic principle is shown in . According to the mercury injection amount and the corresponding pressure obtained by the mercury injection experiment, we can make the capillary pressure curve and then calculate the pore or pore and throat radius distribution curve.\n\nA German Zeiss Crossbeam 540 scanning electron microscope is used to observe the pore structure. The experimental steps are as follows: First, high-precision and small-view scanning are carried out in a vacuum environment, and then a series of high-precision and small-view images are spliced to obtain a series of high-precision and large-view images.\n\n3.3. Theoretical Methods\n\nAccording to the fractal theory,27 if the distribution of rock pores and throats has a fractal structure, it satisfies\n\n1\n\nIn the formula, N(r) is the number of pore throats with a radius greater than r, r is the pore throat radius, C is the fractal coefficient, and D is the fractal dimension.\n\nBased on the capillary model and the derivation process,34 there are\n\n2\n\nIn the formula, VHg is the cumulative mercury volume corresponding to throat radius r, r is the throat radius, and l is the capillary length.\n\nAccording to the formulation of capillary calculation, the relationship between Pc and r can be expressed as\n\n3\n\nCombining eqs –13, there is\n\n4\n\n5\n\nIn the equation, SHg is the mercury saturation when the pore throat radius is r, a is constant for a specific sample, Vpore is the pore volume of rock, and Pc is the capillary pressure.\n\nThe logarithms on both sides can be obtained as\n\n6\n\nThen, the fractal dimension of the pore throat can be plotted according to log(SHg) and log(Pc). If there is a linear relationship, the slope k is calculated by fitting the curve, and the fractal dimension D of the pore and throat can be expressed as\n\n7\n\n4. Results\n\n4.1. Petrological and Petrophysical Characteristics\n\nThe lithology of the clastic reservoir in the Ba 1 Member predominantly comprises feldspar sandstone and feldspar lithic sandstone ( a). The quartz content ranges from 28% to 74%, with an average of 50.2%. The feldspar content ranges from 5% to 43%, with an average of 25.6%. The rock debris is fragments of parent rock, which are mineral aggregates that maintain the structure of parent rock. Its content can reflect the source and transport distances of parent rock. The rock debris content ranges from 4% to 36%, with an average of 18.7%. Debris particles exhibit point-line contact with a preference for rounded grinding circles, resulting in a medium to good sorting. The average maturity of the rock composition is 1.13, indicating a medium level of composition maturity. In the Ba 2 Member, the clastic reservoir lithology is mainly composed of lithic feldspar sandstone and feldspar lithic sandstone ( b). The quartz content ranges from 30% to 86%, with an average of 46.2%. The feldspar content ranges from 7% to 38%, with an average of 24.6%. The rock debris content ranges from 7% to 54%, with an average of 29.3%. The gravel composition primarily consists of quartzite and granite. Debris particles exhibit point-line contact and are rounded to subedge-subcircle-based, resulting in a medium to poor sorting. The rock composition maturity ranges from 0.43 to 1.38, with an average of 0.82, indicating a low overall composition maturity. The maturity of the rock composition provides insights into the degree of chemical and petrophysical alteration. Similarly, in the Ba 2 Member, the lithology consists of lithic feldspar sandstone and feldspar lithic sandstone, accompanied by varying quartz, feldspar, and rock debris contents. The gravel composition primarily comprises quartzite and granite, with medium to poor sorting. The lower rock composition maturity suggests limited alteration processes. Overall, these observations contribute to a comprehensive understanding of clastic reservoir lithology, aiding in the assessment of reservoir quality and hydrocarbon potential.\n\nThe analysis of petrophysical properties of the 16 samples from the Bayingobi Formation reveals that it predominantly represents a low porosity and low permeability reservoir. The porosity values range from 5.12% to 16.84% with an average of 10.8%. More than 50% of the samples exhibit porosity levels between 8% and 14%, while over 20% of the samples have porosity exceeding 14% ( a). In terms of permeability, the range observed is 0.08 to 3.74 mD, with an average of 1.17 mD ( b). The most frequently occurring permeability range falls between 1 and 2 mD, accounting for 50% of the total samples, while those with permeability less than 1 mD comprise 37.5% of the samples. Statistical data indicate a strong correlation between porosity and permeability, with a correlation coefficient of 0.70 ( c). This suggests that the reservoir’s permeation pathways are primarily controlled by the presence of pores, indicating a porous reservoir nature.\n\n4.2. Types of Reservoir Space\n\nBased on the observations of casting thin sections, the pore characteristics of the different permeability classes in the samples were identified. We can divide the pore types into intergranular pores and intragranular pores according to whether the pores are located between or inside the particles. In addition, we judge the primary pores and secondary dissolution pores according to whether the contour of the pores is relatively regular. In the class I samples (k < 0.5 mD), the dominant pore type is intergranular dissolution pores, although they are not extensively developed. For the class II samples (0.5 mD < k < 1.0 mD), dissolution pores are the primary pore type, followed by primary intergranular pores. The dissolution pores in this class mainly manifest as intergranular dissolution pores. In the class III (1.0 mD < k < 2.0 mD) and class IV (k > 2.0 mD) samples, the main pore types are primary intergranular pores and dissolution pores, with dissolution pores being predominantly intergranular and intragranular dissolution pores ( ). As the permeability increases, several changes in the pore characteristics are observed. The content of calcite cement gradually decreases in all four groups of samples, while the content of the matrix slightly increases. The content of primary intergranular pores shows a significant increase, and the content of dissolution pores also increases, particularly in the presence of intragranular dissolved pores.\n\nIn the high-resolution FE-SEM observation, the carbonate cement appears as a light gray region ( a), while the deep gray portion represents the mineral matrix and the dark areas represent pores. The observations in align with the findings from casting thin sections, revealing changes in the pore characteristics with increasing permeability. Specifically, as the petrophysical properties of the sample increase, the clay mineral content decreases, small pores diminish gradually, and large pores become more prevalent. Upon closer examination, the microscopic analysis of deep sandstone in the Bayingobi Formation reveals three primary pore types: ① Primary intergranular pores ( d), which predominantly occur between brittle mineral grains such as quartz and feldspar. These pores exhibit sharp edges, a distinct particle-like appearance, and maintain the original framework between mineral grains, making them favorable reservoir spaces. The sandstone samples from the Bayingobi Formation display both quartz-based primary intergranular pores and feldspar-based primary intergranular pores, as evidenced by their morphological characteristics. ② Dissolution pores ( b,d) are further categorized as intergranular dissolution holes and intragranular dissolution pores. Intergranular dissolution pores develop at the mineral particle edges, while intragranular dissolution pores form within the minerals. Dissolution pores primarily emerge at the contact points between brittle minerals and plastic minerals dominated by clay minerals due to shrinkage of the latter. Additionally, the presence of acidic fluids during diagenesis contributes to the dissolution of mineral particles and fillers, leading to pore formation at the edges and interiors of the mineral particles. The irregular shape and serrated edges of dissolution pores disrupt the particle structure, creating favorable reservoir spaces and key pathways for fluid flow. ③ Microcracks ( b–d) are mainly observed within minerals, while intergranular microcracks formed between minerals are also evident, serving as important connections between pores.\n\n4.3. Distribution Characteristics of Pore Throat Radius\n\nThe constant rate mercury injection test results reveal that the pore radius distribution of samples with different permeability levels follows a close-to-normal distribution with similar range and peak values. The predominant pore radius range for all four samples falls between 160 and 220 μm. Samples A and C exhibit a peak value at 160 μm, sample B at 165 μm, and sample D at 175 μm ( ). Notably, sample D shows a wider peak width compared to samples A–C, with a slightly shifted peak position. These observations suggest that the variation in pore distribution is a key factor influencing the petrophysical properties of ultralow and low permeability reservoirs. Further analysis of throat radius distribution patterns reveals distinct differences among the four samples. With increasing permeability, the throat radius distribution range widens, the peak value shifts toward higher values, the proportion of small throats decreases, and the occurrence of large throats increases significantly, accompanied by a decline in peak content. Samples A and B primarily exhibit throat radii distributed in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 μm ( a), while samples C and D display throat radii between 1.5 to 4.5 μm and 2 to 7 μm, respectively ( b). Among the four sample classes, the content of throats smaller than or equal to 1 μm decreases significantly: 46.94%, 58.38%, 9.73%, and 4.21% for samples A, B, C, and D, respectively. This trend indicates that ultralow permeability sandstone reservoirs consist of a larger proportion of small throats, which exhibit greater fluctuation amplitudes and are more susceptible to damage during the development process.\n\n4.4. Change Characteristics of Capillary Curve\n\nThe constant rate mercury injection method provides direct measurements of the pore, throat, and overall capillary pressure curves. Unlike conventional mercury injection, this method allows for a more accurate assessment of the effective throat volume in sandstone. It also reveals the distribution characteristics of throats and the effective pore volume controlled by throats along with their interrelationship. The final mercury saturation values for the four sample types are 23.3%, 23.09%, 35.24%, and 41.66%, respectively ( ). Samples A and B exhibit similar final mercury saturation despite their differing permeability levels. Sample A (k < 0.5 mD) represents a typical ultralow permeability sandstone. As shown in , the overall capillary pressure curve closely follows the throat capillary pressure curve at low mercury inlet pressures. This indicates that the mercury inflow saturation in sample A is primarily controlled by the throats, with minimal development of pores, consistent with previous observations. Essentially, only small pores are developed, resulting in a final mercury inflow saturation of less than 25%. With increasing mercury inlet pressure, the mercury inflow saturation gradually increases. The capillary pressure behavior of sample B slightly deviates from the overall capillary pressure curve. The configuration of pore throats in sample B includes a larger proportion of large throats and smaller throats compared to that in sample A. Additionally, a small number of pores are developed, contributing to the disparity in permeability.\n\nIn the case of sample C, the pore capillary pressure curve indicates that at low mercury inlet pressures, the throats still exert control. The overall capillary pressure curve aligns with the throat capillary pressure curve during this stage. As the mercury inlet pressure increases, the throats and pores (primarily the throats) begin to jointly control the mercury inflow, resulting in a final mercury inlet saturation of 35%. However, throat control remains predominant, suggesting similarity in permeability between samples B and C. Sample D, characterized by high permeability, demonstrates a different behavior. Mercury first enters the pores controlled by large throats, and the overall capillary pressure curve closely follows the pore pressure curve. As the mercury inlet pressure continues to rise, mercury begins to enter the pores controlled by small throats, causing the pore capillary pressure curve to increase. Although the mercury inlet pressure rises sharply, the amount of mercury entering the pores increases slowly due to the prominent role of throats. Once all of the pores connected to the throats are filled with mercury, further increases in mercury inlet pressure lead to the entry of mercury into smaller throats. Consequently, the overall capillary pressure curve becomes completely dependent on the changes in the throat capillary pressure curve during this stage.\n\n4.5. Fractal Characteristics of Pore and Throat\n\nThe constant velocity mercury injection method provides direct measurements of both the pore capillary pressure curve and the throat capillary pressure curve. By analyzing the scatter plots of log (Pc) (logarithm of capillary pressure) and log (SHg) (logarithm of mercury saturation) and fitting a straight line, slope (k) of the line can be obtained. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of pores and throats can be calculated using formula (6) described in section 3.3. illustrates the fractal curves of pores and throats, showing distinct turning points. The slopes of the fractal curves before and after the turning point differ significantly, indicating varying fractal dimensions of the pores and throats at different scales. The turning point represents the transition from large-scale pore throats with high permeability to small-scale pore throats with low permeability.35 Based on the principle of mercury injection, when the mercury inlet pressure is below the turning point pressure, it corresponds to large-scale pores and throats. Conversely, when the mercury inlet pressure exceeds the turning point pressure, it corresponds to small-scale pores and throats. The different scales of turning points are clearly visible in the fractal curve ( ).\n\nTable 2 presents the fractal dimensions of large- and small-scale pores and throats. The fractal dimension of large-scale pores ranges from 2.67 to 4.19, with an average of 3.60. On the other hand, the fractal dimension of small-scale pores ranges from 2.15 to 3.77, with an average of 2.42. For large-scale throats, the fractal dimension ranges from 2.19 to 3.65, with an average of 2.62. In contrast, the fractal dimension of small-scale throats ranges from 2.13 to 2.62, with an average of 2.29. The fractal dimension of large-scale structures is higher than that of small-scale structures, indicating that large-scale pores exhibit more complexity and heterogeneity than small-scale pores. Additionally, the fractal dimension of pores is greater than the fractal dimension of throats.\n\nTable 2\n\nbasic parameters of mercury intrusionfractal dimensionporethroattypessamplestotal mercury saturation %pore mercurysaturation %throat mercurysaturation %average poreradius μmaverage throatradius μmpore throatradius ratioD1RD2RD1RD2R①gc1-522.724.1218.6182.116.3550.43.310.982.190.912.650.992.130.90g4-516.882.7814.1200.398.9339.64.100.882.160.883.650.902.290.96g6-1123.082.6620.42182.571.22175.712.670.963.770.942.380.972.470.90g7-523.300.7322.57186.81.4172.813.680.933.180.942.190.872.620.93g7-638.4412.4725.97196.614.0475.383.580.992.190.792.700.992.210.94g11-133.419.2224.19186.71.79127.23.760.992.250.822.480.96//②g7-136.5213.9522.57190.541.79137.034.190.952.320.802.490.96//g7-435.2310.6524.58186.942.74106.513.700.982.440.892.701.002.210.95g11-435.8812.7523.13203.932.03112.123.830.992.150.722.430.92//g11-734.2212.4321.79194.17395.73.670.992.220.812.400.92//③gc1-1039.3821.6817.7204.853.95111.623.740.992.210.822.780.982.330.99gc1-734.0016.6117.39206.985.0975.253.520.962.220.832.560.982.150.96gc1-341.6624.7316.93216.636.4973.793.110.942.180.882.710.972.190.95\n\n5. Discussion\n\n5.1. Correlation Between Pore Structure and Reservoir Petrophysical Properties\n\ndemonstrates the correlation between the average radius of pores and throats and the petrophysical properties of the samples. It is evident that the average radii of pores and throats exhibit a stronger correlation with permeability. In particular, the average throat radius displays the best correlation with permeability, indicating that throats have a greater impact on permeability compared to that of pores. The average pore radius for samples in groups I, II, III, and IV ranges from 187.36 to 190.54 μm, 182.57 to 204.85 μm, 186.94 to 206.98 μm, and 216.63 μm, respectively. On the other hand, the average throat radius ranges from 1.40 to 1.79 μm, 1.22 to 3.95 μm, 2.74 to 5.09 μm, and 6.49 μm for groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Thus, in low porosity and low permeability sandstone reservoirs, the variation primarily lies in the distribution of throats. When the sample permeability is below 1.0 mD, the average throat radius ranges between 1.0 and 3.0 μm. As the permeability exceeds 1.0 mD, the throat distribution range widens, with a higher proportion of larger throats observed as the permeability increases.\n\nThe pore throat ratio is a useful indicator for assessing the nonuniformity and homogeneity of pore structures, providing insights into pore opening characteristics. In the case of low porosity and low permeability reservoirs, the pore throat radius ratio tends to be larger compared to conventional reservoirs, and its distribution range is wider.36,37 illustrates a negative correlation among permeability, porosity, and pore throat radius. Specifically, the correlation between permeability and pore throat radius ratio is notably stronger than that between porosity and pore throat radius ratio. When the pore throat radius ratio is small, the binding capacity of the throat for oil or gas is diminished, leading to higher permeability. Consequently, oil or gas can easily flow through the throat and be recovered.38 On the other hand, when the pore throat radius ratio is relatively large, oil or gas encounters significant capillary resistance when passing through narrow throats, making recovery challenging. For samples with a high pore throat ratio, the porosity parameter may not be high, indicating that when evaluating ultralow permeability sandstone reservoirs, the weight given to the porosity parameter should not be too significant, as it may not be a reliable indicator. This observation further suggests that the primary factor contributing to the limited abundance of oil and gas and the low production level in low porosity and low permeability sandstone reservoirs is the presence of large pore throat ratios.39,40\n\nThe constant-rate mercury injection technique has limitations such as a maximum mercury injection pressure of approximately 900 psi, corresponding to a throat radius of about 0.12 μm. Throats with a radius larger than 0.12 μm and the pores controlled by throats of this size are referred to as effective throats or effective pores. The mercury saturation obtained through constant-rate mercury injection can quantitatively reflect the volume of effective pores and throats.41 The volume of the pores and throats is influenced by their respective radii and quantities. Larger pore and throat radii and higher quantities correspond to larger pore and throat volumes. The development degree of throats affects fluid flowability, with better-developed throats facilitating easier fluid flow.39 The distribution range of pore mercury saturation for samples in different groups varies: 0.73%–14.0%, 12.43%–21.68%, 10.65%–16.61%, and 13.66% to 24.73%. The distribution range of throat mercury saturation is as follows: 22.57% to 26.67%, 17.70% to 23.13%, 17.39% to 25.97%, and 16.76% to 16.93%. The effective pore throat volume depends on the effective pore throat radius, length, and quantity. The size of the effective pore throat volume is directly proportional to these three parameters.42 From the correlation between pore and throat mercury saturation and petrophysical properties ( ), it can be observed that porosity and permeability increase with an increase in effective pore volume, while porosity and permeability show a slight decrease with an increase in effective throat volume. In general, a larger effective pore throat volume corresponds to larger pore and throat spaces. This study demonstrates that the effective pore throat volume plays a role in determining the petrophysical properties of the reservoir to some extent. However, the complex internal pore structure of the reservoir also influences the effective permeability space and flow channel. Therefore, evaluating low porosity and low permeability oil and gas reservoirs requires the consideration of multiple parameters and cannot rely solely on a single parameter.\n\n5.2. Classification and Evaluation of Pore Structure\n\nIn the above discussion, we found that the classification of pore structure by porosity and permeability alone is not accurate, and the pore throat fractal curve is fitted by the log SHg – log Pc scatter transformed from the mercury entry curve; therefore, the fractal curve shape is in good agreement with the mercury entry curve. Therefore, on the basis of constant rate mercury injection experiment and scanning electron microscope observation, the classification of pore structure is combined with fractal dimension. The specific classification can be divided into 3 categories: ① Micro pore and small throat type. The pore throat space is dominated by microporous small throats, and the pore type is dominated by intragranular dissolution pores ( b). The average total mercury saturation is 26.31%, the average throat mercury saturation is 20.98%, the average throat radius is 3.96 μm, and the average pore radius is 189.20 μm. The distribution range of the pore throat radius ratio is 39.60–175.71. The pore fractal dimension is 2.67–4.10, and the throat fractal dimension is 2.13–3.65. This kind of pore structure has a small throat, low porosity and permeability, and poor petrophysical properties; ② Small pore and small throat type. The pore throat space is mainly composed of small pores and small throats, and the pore types are mainly intergranular dissolution pores and primary intergranular pores ( d,g). The average total mercury saturation is 35.46%, the average pore mercury saturation is 12.45%, and the average throat mercury saturation is 23.02%. Pores begin to contribute to total mercury saturation, which can account for more than 30%. The average pore radius is 193.90 μm, the average throat radius is 2.39 μm, the ratio of pore throat radius is small, the distribution range is wide, and the average value is 112.84. The pore fractal dimension is 2.15–4.19, and the throat fractal dimension is 2.21–2.70. This type of pore structure has a larger pore individual and a significantly lower pore throat radius ratio, which is a better type; ③ Large pore and thick throat type. The pore types are mainly primary intergranular pores and dissolved pores ( d). The total average mercury saturation is 38.35%, the maximum pore mercury saturation can reach 24.73%, and the average throat mercury saturation is 17.34%. The pore makes a major contribution to the total mercury saturation. The average pore radius is 209.49 μm, the average throat radius is 5.18 μm, and the pore throat radius ratio is small, with an average of 86.89. The pore fractal dimension is 2.18–3.74, and the throat fractal dimension is 2.15–2.78. In this kind of pore structure, the throat is mainly medium and coarse, the pore throat configuration is good, and the pore permeability performance is the best.\n\nThe finding that most of the samples in this study have a pore fractal dimension greater than 3 and exhibit a linear fitting of the fractal curve is consistent with previous results from studies on tight sandstone and coal in other layers. This suggests that the pore spaces in these reservoirs exhibit complex and self-similar structures at different scales. The fractal dimension greater than 3 indicates a high degree of heterogeneity and complexity within the pore structure, which has implications for the permeability and flow behavior of fluids within the reservoir. By considering the pore fractal dimension, along with other parameters such as porosity, permeability, and throat characteristics, a more comprehensive evaluation of reservoir quality can be achieved.35 The study of the deep sandstone of the Bayingobi Formation in Guaizi Lake reveals that the pore and throat structures of the reservoir exhibit stage fractal characteristics. This finding differs from a previous study on the pore throat fractal of low permeability sandstone in the He 8 member of the Ordos Basin, where it was concluded that the reservoir pores do not have a fractal structure. The difference in findings can be attributed to the influence of different hydrocarbon types and reservoir conditions on pore evolution. In the case of the deep sandstone in Guaizi Lake, the presence of liquid hydrocarbons contributes significantly to the formation of dissolved pores, resulting in a more fractal distribution of the pores. Microscopic observations of the reservoir reveal that small-scale throats are predominantly curved lamellar throats formed by compaction and cementation, while large-scale throats are primarily microcracks between particles. Small-scale pores mainly consist of intragranular dissolution pores formed by dissolution, while large-scale pores are primarily intergranular and intergranular dissolution pores. Although the pore types and throat characteristics are similar among the three pore structure types, there are differences in pore inlet mercury saturation and pore fractal dimension. The pore fractal dimension follows the trend of “large-scale fractal dimension > small-scale fractal dimension”. The macropore and coarse throat types exhibit low spatial complexity and good petrophysical properties, while the micropore and small throat types exhibit stronger reservoir heterogeneity and poorer petrophysical properties. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering both pore and throat characteristics as well as their fractal dimensions in characterizing and evaluating the reservoir quality and spatial complexity of sandstone formations.\n\n5.3. Main Controlling Factors of Pore Throat Development\n\nFor the pore development of clastic rock reservoirs, compaction plays a key role in controlling their petrophysical properties, which is one of the main reasons for the obvious deterioration of reservoir petrophysical properties.43 It is generally believed that in addition to the burial depth and formation pressure, the mechanical compaction of clastic rocks is mainly affected by the composition and particle size sorting of the particles.44 The deep clastic rock reservoir of the Bayingobi Formation in the Guizihu Sag has a high average content of rigid particles, with quartz content ranging from 28% to 86% (averaging 48.2%) and feldspar content ranging from 5% to 43% (averaging 25.1%).42 The high content of rigid particles increases the compression resistance of the sandstone reservoir, thus playing a positive role in the preservation of intergranular pores. The rock debris content ranges from 19% to 47%, with an average of 33.6%. On one hand, rock debris is relatively soft and has poor compressive performance. Under the microscope, plastic particles such as mica can be observed as bent and deformed, resulting in the reduction of intergranular pores ( a,b,k). On the other hand, minerals such as rock debris and feldspar are prone to dissolution, providing a material basis for the formation of secondary pores. The dissolution pores between and inside the feldspar and debris particles of the second member clastic rock are highly developed, with some particles even completely corroded ( e,h,j). It has been found that the petrophysical properties of coarse sandstone reservoirs are generally better than those of fine sandstone. The pore-throat configuration relationship between particles in coarse sandstone reservoirs is better, with a larger supporting force and improved pore connectivity. In contrast, the pores of fine sandstone reservoirs are smaller, and under the action of overlying formation pressure, the particles slide and reorganize, resulting in poor petrophysical properties.45−47 Another main factor that affects the pore development is cementation. Some samples of the Bayingobi Formation sandstone reservoir have high cement content ( a,b and a). The extensive development of carbonate cement leads to the disappearance of most primary pores, filling of throats, serious destruction of the primary pore structure, difficulty of pore fluid flow, and poor petrophysical properties of the reservoir. After relatively weak compaction and cementation, the well-preserved primary effective clastic rock mass provides a spatial basis for the formation of large-scale dissolution-type secondary pores.48,49 The main diagenetic process involved in the formation of secondary pores through deep dissolution is the dissolution of soluble components of sandstone by organic acid and carbon dioxide acid aqueous solutions generated during the maturation of organic matter, which plays a constructive role in improving the petrophysical properties of deep reservoirs.50\n\nThe porosity contribution rate of secondary pores formed by dissolution in the Bayingobi Formation reservoir in the Guizihu Sag is quite high. Feldspar and rock debris ( e,h, j) are the main sources of dissolution. The acid fluid causing dissolution is mainly related to the thermal evolution of the source rock. Organic matter provides the best conditions for the preservation of organic acid at temperatures ranging from 80 to 120 °C. According to the research conducted by Hou et al.,18 who restored the burial history of Well Gc1, it can be seen that the formation temperature is within the area with the highest organic acid concentration and favorable preservation area from the deposition period of the Su 1 member to the end of the Su 2 member. During the evolution of organic matter and hydrocarbon generation, not only is a large amount of organic acid released, but also the hydrocarbon filling changes the properties of the pore fluid, slowing down or inhibiting cementation. The organic acid and the acidic gases such as CO2 contained in it are conducive to dissolution. Additionally, the overpressure generated by filling can buffer the compaction of overlying strata and protect the pores of deep reservoirs.51,52 The sandstone reservoir in the study area has both a material and spatial basis for the formation of secondary pores. The favorable initial sedimentary conditions preserve the pores, and the good spatial relationship between the sand and mud allows the reservoir to have better petrophysical properties. At the same time, the acidic fluid can smoothly enter the sandstone for dissolution, forming a large number of secondary pores.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nBased on basic geological data, microscopic observation, and constant-rate mercury injection data, the reservoir characteristics and pore structure characteristics are discussed, and the fractal characteristics of pores and throats in deep sandstone reservoirs in the study area were determined. According to the present research, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n(1)\n\nThere are three main types of deep sandstone pores in the Bayingobi Formation of Guizihu Sag: primary intergranular pores, dissolution pores, and microfractures. Low permeability samples mainly develop primary intergranular pores and intergranular dissolution pores. Ultralow permeability samples mainly develop intergranular and intragranular dissolution pores. Different pore types provide different sizes, shapes, and scales of reservoir space, which directly affect the petrophysical properties of the reservoir.\n\n(2)\n\nThe pore radius of the four representative samples is distributed between 160 and 220 μm, with a peak value of approximately 165 μm. However, their throat radius distribution patterns are quite different. With increasing permeability, the distribution range of throat radius widens, the peak value of throat shifts to the right, the proportion of small throats decreases, the proportion of large throats increases significantly, and the peak content shows a decreasing trend. The main factor affecting reservoir seepage capacity is the distribution of large throats.\n\n(3)\n\nThe pore structure of deep sandstone reservoirs in the study area is generally divided into three types: micropore and small-throat type, where the throat always plays a major control role. The overall capillary pressure curve is basically the same as the throat inlet mercury pressure curve. Small pore and small-throat type, where the pore initially has a small influence on mercury pressure, and the overall capillary pressure curve is basically the same as the throat capillary pressure curve. As the inlet mercury pressure gradually increases, the pore begins to play a major control role. This type of pore structure has larger individual pores and a significantly lower pore throat radius ratio, making it a better type. Large pore and thick-throat type, where the pore plays a major control role, and the overall capillary pressure curve is basically the same as the pore inlet mercury pressure curve. This type of pore structure has a small fractal dimension, predominantly medium and coarse throats, and good pore throat configuration, resulting in the best pore permeability performance.\n\n(4)\n\nUnder good initial sedimentary conditions, after relatively weak compaction and cementation, the original clastic material provides a high-quality spatial basis for later dissolution. The dissolution of a large number of organic acids released during the evolution and hydrocarbon generation of organic matter on the soluble components of sandstone is the key to the formation of secondary pores.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Resources and Exploration of the China University of Petroleum (Beijing) and the College of Earth Sciences of the China University of Petroleum (Beijing).
