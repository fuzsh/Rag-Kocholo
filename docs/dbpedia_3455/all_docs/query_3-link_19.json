When cancer spread to the peritoneal surfaces is documented, a decision regarding palliation vs. an aggressive approach using cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy must be made. The perioperative chemotherapy may be hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) administered in the operating room or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) administered in the first 4 or 5 postoperative days. This decision is dependent on a well-defined group of prognostic indicators. In addition to treatment, the clinical and pathologic features of a primary cancer can be used to select perioperative treatments that may prevent cancer cells within the abdomen and pelvis from progressing to established peritoneal metastases. In some clinical situations with appendiceal and colorectal cancers, the clinical or histopathologic features may indicate that second-look surgery plus perioperative chemotherapy should occur. Peritoneal metastases should always be considered for treatment or prevention.\n\nUpdate on the prevention of local recurrence and peritoneal metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nSugarbaker, Paul H\n\n2014-07-28\n\nThe prevention of a disease process has always been superior to the treatment of the same disease throughout the history of medicine and surgery. Local recurrence and peritoneal metastases occur in approximately 8% of colon cancer patients and 25% of rectal cancer patients and should be prevented. Strategies to prevent colon or rectal cancer local recurrence and peritoneal metastases include cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy (HIPEC). These strategies can be used at the time of primary colon or rectal cancer resection if the HIPEC is available. At institutions where HIPEC is not available with the treatment of primary malignancy, a proactive second-look surgery is recommended. Several phase II studies strongly support the proactive approach. If peritoneal metastases were treated along with the primary colon resection, 5-year survival was seen and these results were superior to the results of treatment after peritoneal metastases had developed as recurrence. Also, prophylactic HIPEC improved survival with T3/T4 mucinous or signet ring colon cancers. A second-look has been shown to be effective in two published manuscripts. Unpublished data from MedStar Washington Cancer Institute also produced favorable date. Rectal cancer with peritoneal metastases may not be so effectively treated. There are both credits and debits of this proactive approach. Selection factors should be reviewed by the multidisciplinary team for individualized management of patients with or at high risk for peritoneal metastases.\n\nIntra-operative peritoneal lavage for colorectal cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPassot, Guillaume; Mohkam, Kayvan; Cotte, Eddy; Glehen, Olivier\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFree cancer cells can be detected in peritoneal fluid at the time of colorectal surgery. Peritoneal lavage in colorectal surgery for cancer is not used in routine, and the prognostic significance of intraperitoneal free cancer cells (IPCC) remains unclear. Data concerning the technique of peritoneal lavage to detect IPCC and its timing regarding colorectal resection are scarce. However, positive IPCC might be the first step of peritoneal spread in colorectal cancers, which could lead to early specific treatments. Because of the important heterogeneity of IPCC determination in reported studies, no treatment have been proposed to patients with positive IPCC. Herein, we provide an overview of IPCC detection and its impact on recurrence and survival, and we suggest further multi-institutional studies to evaluate new treatment strategies.

All consecutive CRC patients with synchronous PM (<3Â months) between 1995 and 2014 were extracted from the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Trends in treatment and overall survival were assessed in four time periods. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyse the impact of systemic and locoregional treatment modalities on survival. A total of 37,036 patients were diagnosed with primary CRC between 1995 and 2014. Synchronous PM was diagnosed in 1,661 patients, of whom 55% had also metastases at other sites (nÂ =Â 917) and 77% received anticancer therapy (nÂ =Â 1,273). Treatment with systemic therapy increased from 23% in 1995-1999 to 56% in 2010-2014 (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) was applied since 2005 and increased from 10% in 2005-2009 to 23% in 2010-2014. Surgery for lymphatic or haematogenous metastases increased from 2% to 10% in these periods. Median overall survival of the complete cohort improved from 6.0 months in 1995-2000 to 12.5 months in 2010-2014 (pÂ <Â 0.0001), with a doubling of survival for both PM alone and PM with other involved sites. The influence of year of diagnosis on survival (hazard ratio, 2010-2014 versus 1995-1999; 0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.62; pÂ <Â 0.0001) disappeared after including systemic therapy and locoregional treatment modalities in subsequent multivariable models. CRC patients presenting with PM are increasingly offered a multidisciplinary treatment approach, resulting in an increased overall survival for the entire cohort. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to assess the results of resection of hepatic and extrahepatic metastases in patients with CHEHMs in a high-volume center for both hepatobiliary and colorectal surgery and to identify prognostic factors that correlate with longer survival in these patients. It was performed a retrospective analysis of 678 consecutive patients with liver resection for colorectal cancer metastases operated in a single Centre between April 1996 and March 2016. Among these, 73 patients presented CHEHMs. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for overall survival (OS) in these patients. Results: There were 20 CHMs located at the lymphatic node level, 20 at the peritoneal level, 12 at the ovary and lung level, 12 presenting as local relapses and 9 other sites. 53 curative resections (R0) were performed. The difference in overall survival between the CHEHMs group and the CHMs group is statistically significant for the entire groups (p 0.0001), as well as in patients who underwent R0 resection (p 0.0001). In CHEHMs group, the OS was statistically significant higher in patients who underwent R0 resection vs. those with R1/R2 resection (p=0.004). Three variables were identified as prognostic factors for poor OS following univariate analysis: 4 or more hepatic metastases, major hepatectomy and the performance of operation during first period of the study (1996 - 2004). There was a tendency toward better OS in patients with ovarian or pulmonary location of extrahepatic disease, although the difference was not statistically significant. In patients with concomitant hepatic and extrahepatic metastases, complete resection of metastatic burden significantly prolong survival. The patients with up to 4 liver metastases, resectable by minor hepatectomy benefit the most from this aggressive onco\n\nPeritoneal metastases of colorectal origin - cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The financial aspect.\n\nPubMed\n\nJastrzÄbski, Tomasz; BÄbenek, Marek\n\n2017-12-30\n\nThe incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal cancer amounts to 5%-15% for synchronous metastases and as much as 40% in cases of local recurrence. Best results are obtained for cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). This treatment offers much better outcomes, leading to 5-year survival rates of as much as 30%-50%. The procedures require significant experience in abdominal surgery, are time-consuming (mean duration of the procedure ranging from 6 to 8 hours) and are burdened by complications that are due not only to the procedure itself but also to the intraperitoneal administration of the cytostatic drug at elevated temperature (41.5 Â°C). After the procedure, patients are required to be admitted to intensive care units due to potential complications associated with the extent and duration of the procedure as well as chemotherapy administered in hyperthermia. Postoperative management of these patients requires appropriate experience of the entire medical and nursing team. Cytoreductive surgeries combined with HIPEC as highly specialized medical procedures should be assessed for their potential long-term benefits and their costs should be appropriately calculated with consideration to realistic reimbursement rates. Realistic valuation and reimbursement covering the overall average cost of the procedure is recommended by the National Consultant in Surgical Oncology as well as the ESMO consensus guidelines.\n\nMissing metastases as a model to challenge current therapeutic algorithms in colorectal liver metastases.\n\nPubMed\n\nLucidi, Valerio; Hendlisz, Alain; Van Laethem, Jean-Luc; Donckier, Vincent\n\n2016-04-21\n\nIn oncosurgical approach to colorectal liver metastases, surgery remains considered as the only potentially curative option, while chemotherapy alone represents a strictly palliative treatment. However, missing metastases, defined as metastases disappearing after chemotherapy, represent a unique model to evaluate the curative potential of chemotherapy and to challenge current therapeutic algorithms. We reviewed recent series on missing colorectal liver metastases to evaluate incidence of this phenomenon, predictive factors and rates of cure defined by complete pathologic response in resected missing metastases and sustained clinical response when they were left unresected. According to the progresses in the efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimen, the incidence of missing liver metastases regularly increases these last years. Main predictive factors are small tumor size, low marker level, duration of chemotherapy, and use of intra-arterial chemotherapy. Initial series showed low rates of complete pathologic response in resected missing metastases and high recurrence rates when unresected. However, recent reports describe complete pathologic responses and sustained clinical responses reaching 50%, suggesting that chemotherapy could be curative in some cases. Accordingly, in case of missing colorectal liver metastases, the classical recommendation to resect initial tumor sites might have become partially obsolete. Furthermore, the curative effect of chemotherapy in selected cases could lead to a change of paradigm in patients with unresectable liver-only metastases, using intensive first-line chemotherapy to intentionally induce missing metastases, followed by adjuvant surgery on remnant chemoresistant tumors and close surveillance of initial sites that have been left unresected.\n\nHepatic resection for colorectal metastases - a national perspective.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHeriot, A. G.; Reynolds, J.; Marks, C. G.; Karanjia, N.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Many consultant surgeons are uncertain about peri-operative assessment and postoperative follow-up of patients for colorectal liver metastases, and indications for referral for hepatic resection. The aim of this study was to assess the views the consultant surgeons who manage these patients. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to all consultant members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland and of the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. The questionnaire assessed current practice for preoperative assessment and follow-up of patients with colorectal malignancy and timing of and criteria for hepatic resection of metastases. Number of referrals/resections were also assessed. RESULTS: The response rate was 47%. Half of the consultants held joint clinics with an oncologist and 89% assessed the liver for secondaries prior to colorectal resection. Ultrasound was used by 75%. Whilst 99% would consider referring a patient with a solitary liver metastasis for resection, only 62% would consider resection for more than 3 unilobar metastases. The majority (83%) thought resections should be performed within the 6 months following colorectal resection. During follow-up, 52% requested blood CEA levels and 72% liver ultrasound. Half would consider chemotherapy prior to liver resection and 76% performed at least one hepatic resection per year with a median number of 2 resections each year. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients are assessed for colorectal liver metastases preoperatively and during follow-up though there is spectrum of frequency of assessment and modality for imaging. Virtually all patients with solitary hepatic metastases are considered for liver resection. Patients with more than one metastasis are likely to be not considered for resection. Many surgeons are carrying out less than 3 resections each year.

A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed as well as Tripdatabase, National Guideline Clearinghouse, BMJ Best Practice and Guidelines International Network was performed to identify (inter)national guidelines and consensus statements from oncological or surgical societies on PMCRC. The quality of guidelines was assessed using the AGREE-II score. Topics followed by recommendations were extracted from the guidelines. The recommendations, highest level of supporting evidence and the degree of consensus were determined for each topic. Twenty-one guidelines were included, in most (15) of which cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) was recommended in selected patients based on level 1b evidence. Substantial consensus was also reached on the benefit of multidisciplinary team discussion and the achievability of a (near) complete cytoreduction (CC0-1) without supporting evidence. Both evidence and consensus were lacking regarding other aspects including preoperative positron emission tomography/CT, second look surgery in high risk patients, the optimal patient selection for CRS/HIPEC, procedural aspects of HIPEC and (perioperative) systemic therapy. In currently available guidelines, evidence and consensus on the treatment strategy for PMCRC are lacking. Updates of guidelines are ongoing and future (randomized) clinical trials should contribute to multidisciplinary and international consensus on treatment strategies for PMCRC.

Our aim was to characterize a novel preclinical model of cachexia in colorectal liver metastases. We tested the hypothesis that mice with colorectal liver metastases would exhibit cachexia, as evidenced by a reduction in liver-free body mass, muscle mass, and physiological impairment. Twelve-week-old male CBA mice received an intrasplenic injection of Ringer solution (sham) or murine colorectal cancer cells (MoCR) to induce colorectal liver metastases. At end-point (20-29 days), the livers of MoCR mice were infiltrated completely with metastases, and MoCR mice had reduced liver-free body mass, muscle mass, and epididymal fat mass compared with sham controls (P < 0.03). MoCR mice exhibited impaired rotarod performance and grip strength (P < 0.03). Histochemical analyses of tibialis anterior muscles from MoCR mice revealed muscle fiber atrophy and reduced oxidative enzyme activity (P < 0.001). Adipose tissue remodeling was evident in MoCR mice, with reduced adipocyte diameter and greater infiltration of nonadipocyte tissue (P < 0.05). These findings reveal the MoCR mouse model exhibits significant cachexia and is a suitable preclinical model of cachexia in colorectal liver metastases. This model should be used for identifying effective treatments for cachexia to improve quality of life and reduce mortality in patients with colorectal liver metastases.\n\nBreast metastases from colorectal carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMihai, Radu; Christie-Brown, Jonathan; Bristol, James\n\n2004-04-01\n\nA case history is presented of a 53-year-old woman with an incidental finding of a breast lump, identified after having had chemotherapy for lung metastases from a rectal carcinoma. Clinical examination, ultrasound, mammography, fine needle aspiration and core biopsies could not prove definitively whether the breast lump represented a metastasis from colorectal carcinoma. Following local excision, the final diagnosis of metastatic colorectal carcinoma to the breast was based on the absence of any site of origin within the breast (i.e. no surrounding DCIS) and on the expression of cytokeratin CK7 and CK20 on immunohistochemistry. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated. Four months later, although without local recurrence in the breast, the patient developed cutaneous metastatic deposits and active treatment was stopped. A review of other cases of breast metastases from extramammary sources is presented. Possible mechanisms for this rare and unusual phenomenon are discussed.\n\nIndocyanine green fluorescence-guided surgery after IV injection in metastatic colorectal cancer: A systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiberale, G; Bourgeois, P; Larsimont, D; Moreau, M; Donckier, V; Ishizawa, T\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIndocyanine green fluorescence-guided surgery (ICG-FGS) has emerged as a potential new imaging modality for improving the detection of hepatic, lymph node (LN), and peritoneal metastases in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature in the clinical setting of ICG-FGS for tumoral detection in various fields of metastatic colorectal disease. PubMed and Medline literature databases were searched for original articles on the use of ICG in the setting of clinical studies on colorectal cancer. The search terms used were \"near-infrared fluorescence\", \"intraoperative imaging\", \"indocyanine green\", \"human\" and \"colorectal cancer\". ICG fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is clearly supported as an intraoperative technique that allows the detection of additional superficial hepatic metastases of CRC. Data on the role of ICG-FI in the intraoperative detection of peritoneal metastases and LN metastases are scarce but encouraging and ICG-FI could potentially improve the staging and treatment of these patients. ICG-FI is a promising imaging technique in the detection of small infraclinic LN, hepatic, and peritoneal metastatic deposits that may allow better staging and more complete surgical resection with a potential prognostic benefit for patients.

We then combined clinical and pathological variables associated with synchronous CPM into a nomogram and confirmed its utilities using decision curve analysis. Synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who received primary tumor resection and underwent KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF gene mutation detection at our center from January 2014 to September 2015 were included in this retrospective study. An analysis was performed to investigate the clinicopathological and molecular features for independent risk factors of synchronous CPM and to subsequently develop a nomogram for synchronous CPM based on multivariate logistic regression. Model performance was quantified in terms of calibration and discrimination. We studied the utility of the nomogram using decision curve analysis. In total, 226 patients were diagnosed with synchronous mCRC, of whom 50 patients (22.1%) presented with CPM. After uni- and multivariate analysis, a nomogram was built based on tumor site, histological type, age, and T4 status. The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.777 (95% CI 0.703-0.850) and adequate calibration. By decision curve analysis, the model was shown to be relevant between thresholds of 0.10 and 0.66. Synchronous CPM is more likely to happen to patients with age â¤60, right-sided primary lesions, signet ring cell cancer or T4 stage. This is the first nomogram to predict synchronous CPM. To ensure generalizability, this model needs to be externally validated. Copyright Â© 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty-three patients underwent first curative hepatectomy for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases whose center was located >30Â mm from the liver surface. Operative outcomes were compared among patients who underwent parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy or major hepatectomy (â¥3 segments). Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy and major hepatectomy were performed for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases in 40 (63%) and 23 (37%) patients, respectively. Resection time was longer in the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy than in the major hepatectomy group (57 vs 39Â minutes) (PÂ =Â .02) and cut-surface area was wider (120 vs 86Â cm 2 )Â (PÂ <Â .01). Resected volume was smaller in the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy than in the major hepatectomy group (251 vs 560Â g)Â (PÂ <Â .01). No differences were found between the 2 groups for total operation time (306 vs 328Â minutes), amount of blood loss (516 vs 400Â mL), rate of major complications (10% vs 13%), and positive operative margins (5% vs 4%). Overall, recurrence-free, and liver recurrence-free survivals did not differ between the 2 groups. Direct major hepatectomy without portal venous embolization could not have been performed in 40% of the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy group (16/40) because of the small liver remnant volume. Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases was performed safely without compromising oncologic radicality. Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy can increase the number of patients eligible for an operation by halving the resection volume and by increasing the chance of direct operative treatment in patients with ill-located colorectal liver metastases.

The treatment of such patients remains controversial without any evidence based organization. Therapeutic sequences are discussed including chemotherapy, colorectal surgery, liver resection and even radio-chemotherapy for some rectal cancers. In case of resectable liver metastases, preoperative chemotherapy offers the advantage of earlier treatment of micro-metastases as well as evaluation of tumor responsiveness, which can help shape future therapy. In this setting, different surgical strategies can be chosen (classical staged procedures with colorectal surgery followed by liver surgery, simultaneous resections or liver first approach) depending on the importance of the primary and metastatic tumors. The literature remains limited, but the results of these strategies seem identical in term of postoperative morbidity and long-term survival. Staged procedures are preferred in case of major liver resection. Location of the primary tumor on the low or mid rectum will necessitate preoperative long course chemoradiotherapy and a more complex multidisciplinary organization. For patients with extensive liver metastases, non-resectability must be assessed by experienced surgeon and radiologist before treatment and during chemotherapy. In this group of patients, improved chemotherapy regimen associated with targeted therapies and new surgical strategies (portal vein embolization, ablation, staged hepatectomiesâ¦) have improved resection rate (15 to 30-40%) and long-term survival. Treatment organization for the primary tumor remains controversial. Resection of the primary to manage symptoms such as obstruction, perforation or bleeding is advocated. For patients with asymptomatic primary a non-surgical approach permits to begin rapidly chemotherapy and obtain a better control of the disease. On the other hand, initial resection of the primary may avoid complications and\n\nMolecular fluorescence-guided surgery of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin: a single-centre feasibility study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarlaar, Niels J; Koller, Marjory; de Jongh, Steven J; van Leeuwen, Barbara L; Hemmer, Patrick H; Kruijff, Schelto; van Ginkel, Robert J; Been, Lukas B; de Jong, Johannes S; Kats-Ugurlu, Gursah; Linssen, Matthijs D; Jorritsma-Smit, Annelies; van Oosten, Marleen; Nagengast, Wouter B; Ntziachristos, Vasilis; van Dam, Gooitzen M\n\n2016-12-01\n\nOptimum cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is essential for the curative treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin. At present, surgeons depend on visual inspection and palpation for tumour detection. Improved detection of tumour tissue using molecular fluorescence-guided surgery could not only help attain a complete cytoreduction of metastatic lesions, but might also prevent overtreatment by avoiding resection of benign lesions. For this non-randomised, single-centre feasibility study, we enrolled patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases scheduled for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. 2 days before surgery, 4Â·5 mg of the near-infrared fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW was administered intravenously. The primary objectives were to determine the safety and feasibility of molecular fluorescence-guided surgery using bevacizumab-IRDye800CW. Molecular fluorescence-guided surgery was deemed safe if no allergic or anaphylactic reactions were recorded and no serious adverse events were attributed to bevacizumab-IRDye800CW. The technique was deemed feasible if bevacizumab-IRDye800CW enabled detection of fluorescence signals intraoperatively. Secondary objectives were correlation of fluorescence with histopathology by back-table imaging of the fresh surgical specimen and semi-quantitative ex-vivo analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue on all peritoneal lesions. Additionally, VEGF-Î± staining and fluorescence microscopy was done. This study is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR4632. Between July 3, 2014, and March 2, 2015, seven patients were enrolled in the study. One patient developed an abdominal sepsis 5 days postoperatively and another died from an asystole 4 days postoperatively, most probably due to a cardiovascular thromboembolic event. However, both serious adverse events were attributed to the surgical cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC\n\n[Liver and lung metastases of colorectal cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate the overall survival and prognostic factors for patients with liver and lung metastases from colorectal cancer. A retrospective review of a prospective database of 52 patients with liver and lung metastases from colorectal cancer, undergoing metastasectomy with curative intent from 1999-2009 at a single institution was carried out. The mean overall survival (OS) was 64 months. For synchronous liver and lung metastases the mean overall survival was 63 months (5-year survival 54â%) and for metachronous liver and lung metastases 74 months (5-year survival 58â%, pâ=â0.451). A poor prognostic outcome was observed in cases of localization of the primary tumor in the rectum (OS 81 vs. 38 months, pâ=â0.004), with multiple lung metastases (â¥â2 metastases, OS 74 vs. 59 months, pâ=â0.032) and with disease progression after premetastasectomy chemotherapy (OS 74 vs. 63 vs. 15 months, pâ<â0.001). No influence on overall survival was detected for bilateral lung metastases, thoracic lymph node metastases, disease recurrence and disease-free interval <â36 months. Metastasectomy for liver and lung metastases of colorectal cancer is associated with a good overall survival in selected cases. Patients with liver and lung metastases should not be routinely excluded from metastasectomy and patients with thoracic lymph node metastases should also not be routinely excluded. Negative prognostic factors for survival are localization of the tumor in the rectum, multiple metastases and disease progression after premetastasectomy chemotherapy. Patients with disease progression after premetastasectomy chemotherapy should be excluded from metastasectomy.\n\nIdentification Of Inequalities In The Selection Of Liver Surgery For Colorectal Liver Metastases In Sweden.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorÃ©n, A; SandstrÃ¶m, P; Gunnarsdottir, K; Ardnor, B; Isaksson, B; Lindell, G; Rizell, M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nLiver resection for colorectal liver metastases offers a 5-year survival rate of 25%-58%. This study aimed to analyze whether patients with colorectal liver metastases undergo resection to an equal extent and whether selection factors play a role in the selection process. Data were retrieved from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry (2007-2011) for colorectal cancer and colorectal liver metastases. The patients identified were linked to the Swedish Registry of Liver and Bile surgery and the National Patient Registry to identify whether liver surgery or ablative treatment was performed. Analyses for age, sex, type of primary tumor and treating hospital (university, county, or district), American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and radiology for detection of metastatic disease were performed. Of 28,355 patients with colorectal cancer, 21.6% (6127/28,355) presented with liver metastases. Of the patients with liver metastases, 18.5% (1134/6127) underwent liver resection or ablation. The cumulative proportion of liver resection/ablation was 4% (1134/28,355) of all colorectal cancer. If \"not bowel resected\" were excluded, the proportion slightly increased to 4.7% (1134/24,262). Around 15% of the patients with metastases were registered as referrals for liver surgery. In a multivariable analysis patients treated at a university hospital for primary tumor were more frequently surgically treated for liver metastases (pâ<â0.0001). Patients with liver metastases from rectal cancer (pâ<â0.0001) and men more often underwent liver resection (pâ=â0.006). A difference was found between health-care regions for the frequency of liver surgery (pâ<â0.0001). Patients >70âyears and those with American Society of Anesthesiologists class >2 underwent liver resection less frequently. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver was more often used in diagnostic work-up in men. Patients with colorectal liver metastases are unequally treated in Sweden, as indicated by the\n\nThe tumour biology of synchronous and metachronous colorectal liver metastases: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlesser, A A P; Georgiou, P; Brown, G; Mudan, S; Goldin, R; Tekkis, P\n\n2013-04-01\n\nForty to fifty percent of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop colorectal liver metastases (CLM) that are either synchronous or metachronous in presentation. Clarifying whether there is a biological difference between the two groups of liver metastases or their primaries could have important clinical implications. A systematic review was performed using the following resources: MEDLINE from PubMed (1950 to present), Embase, Cochrane and the Web of Knowledge. Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. The review demonstrated that the majority of studies found differences in molecular marker expression between colorectal liver metastases and their respective primaries in both the synchronous and metachronous groups. Studies investigating genetic aberrations demonstrated that the majority of changes in the primary tumour were 'maintained' in the colorectal liver metastases. A limited number of studies compared the primary tumours of the synchronous and metachronous groups and generally demonstrated no differences in marker expression. Although there were conflicting results, the colorectal liver metastases in the synchronous and metachronous groups demonstrated some differences in keeping with a more aggressive tumour subtype in the synchronous group. This review suggests that biological differences may exist between the liver metastases of the synchronous and metachronous groups. Whether there are biological differences between the primaries of the synchronous and metachronous groups remains undetermined due to the limited number of studies available. Future research is required to determine whether differences exist between the two groups and should include comparisons of the primary tumours.\n\nDisparities in the surgical treatment of colorectal liver metastases.\n\nPubMed\n\nMunene, Gitonga; Parker, Robyn D; Shaheen, Abdel Aziz; Myers, Robert P; Quan, May Lynn; Ball, Chad G; Dixon, Elijah\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHepatectomy is an accepted standard of care for patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Given that it is unclear whether disparities exist between different patient populations, a population-based analysis was performed to analyze this issue with regards to resection rates and surgical mortality in patients with CLM. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, characteristics and outcomes of adult patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and colorectal metastases that subsequently underwent a liver resection during the years 1993-2007 were identified. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the effects of demographic and clinical covariables on resection rates and in-hospital mortality. Incident colorectal and liver metastases were identified in 138,565 patients; 3,528 patients (2.6%) underwent subsequent resection. African American and Hispanic race were associated with lower resection rates compared to Caucasian patients (adjusted OR 0.61 (0.52 - 0.71) and 0.81 (0.68 - 0.96) respectively). Medicaid insurance was associated with decreased resection rates compared to private insurance (AOR 0.47 (0.40 - 0.56)). The overall inpatient mortality rate was 3.1%. Multivariate analysis determined that mortality rate was correlated to both insurance status and geographic region. The national resection rate is significantly lower than has been reported by most case series. Race and insurance status appear to be correlated to the likelihood of surgical resection. In-hospital mortality is equivalent to the rates reported elsewhere, but is correlated to insurance status and region.\n\nCurative cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and synchronous resectable liver metastases arising from colorectal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLorimier, G; Linot, B; Paillocher, N; Dupoiron, D; VerriÃ¨le, V; Wernert, R; Hamy, A; Capitain, O\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study describes the outcomes of patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) with or without liver metastases (LMs) after curative surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, in order to assess prognostic factors. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) increases overall survival (OS) in patients with PC. The optimal treatment both for PC and for LMs within one surgical operation remains controversial. Patients with PC who underwent CRS followed by HIPEC were evaluated from a prospective database. Overall survival and disease free survival (DFS) rates in patients with PC and with or without LMs were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate predictive variables for survival. From 1999 to 2011, 22 patients with PC and synchronous LMs (PCLM group), were compared to 36 patients with PC alone (PC group). No significant difference was found between the two groups. The median OS were 36 months [range, 20-113] for the PCLM group and 25 months [14-82] for the PC group (pÂ >Â 0.05) with 5-year OS rates of 38% and 40% respectively (pÂ >Â 0.05). The median DFS were 9 months [9-20] and 11.8 months [6.5-23] respectively (pÂ =Â 0.04). The grade III-IV morbidity and cytoreduction score (CCS) >0 (pÂ <Â 0.05) were identified as independent factors for poor OS. Resections of LMs and CCS >0 impair significantly DFS. Synchronous complete CRS of PC and LMs from a colorectal origin plus HIPEC is a feasible therapeutic option. The improvement in OS is similar to that provided for patients with PC alone.

Various complications can occur but most of these are self-limiting if diagnosed and treated in time. This case report describes a serious and rare complication following RFA treatment: hepato-pericardial fistula caused by several RFA procedures aiming to cure colorectal liver metastases. Complications to RFA treatment vary and can be difficult to diagnose.

This study aims to reveal potential liver-like transcriptional characteristics associated with the liver metastasis in primary colorectal carcinoma. Methods: Among the genes up-regulated in normal liver tissues versus normal colorectal tissues, we identified \"liver-specific\" genes whose expression levels ranked among the bottom 10% (\"unexpressed\") of all measured genes in both normal colorectal tissues and primary colorectal tumors without metastasis. These liver-specific genes were investigated for their expressions in both the primary tumors and the corresponding liver metastases of seven primary CRC patients with liver metastasis using microdissected samples. Results: Among the 3958 genes detected to be up-regulated in normal liver tissues versus normal colorectal tissues, we identified 12 liver-specific genes and found two of them, ANGPTL3 and CFHR5 , were unexpressed in microdissected primary colorectal tumors without metastasis but expressed in both microdissected liver metastases and corresponding primary colorectal tumors (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05). Genes co-expressed with ANGPTL3 and CFHR5 were significantly enriched in metabolism pathways characterizing liver tissues, including \"starch and sucrose metabolism\" and \"drug metabolism-cytochrome P450\". Conclusions: For primary CRC with liver metastasis, both the liver metastases and corresponding primary colorectal tumors may express some liver-specific genes which may help the tumor cells adapt the liver micro-environment.\n\nAppearances of colorectal hepatic metastases at diffusion-weighted MRI compared with histopathology: initial observations.\n\nPubMed\n\nScurr, E D; Collins, D J; Temple, L; Karanjia, N; Leach, M O; Koh, D-M\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo describe the appearances of colorectal liver metastases on diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and to compare these appearances with histopathology. 43 patients with colorectal liver metastases were evaluated using breath-hold DW-MRI (b-values 0, 150 and 500 s mm(-2)). The b=500 s mm(-2) DW-MRI were reviewed consensually for lesion size and appearance by two readers. 18/43 patients underwent surgery allowing radiological-pathological comparison. Tissue sections were reviewed by a pathologist, who classified metastases histologically as cellular, fibrotic, necrotic or mixed. The frequency of DW-MRI findings and histological features were compared using the Ï(2) test. 84 metastases were found in 43 patients. On b=500 s mm(-2) DW-MRI, metastases showed three high signal intensity patterns: rim (55/84), uniform (23/84) and variegate (6/84). Of the 55 metastases showing rim pattern, 54 were >1 cm in diameter (p<0.01, Ï(2) test). 25/84 metastases were surgically resected. Of these, 11/22 metastases >1 cm in diameter showed rim pattern and demonstrated central necrosis at histopathology (p=0.04, Ï(2) test). No definite relationship was found between uniform and variegate patterns with histology. Rim high signal intensity was the most common appearance of colorectal liver metastases >1 cm diameter on DW-MRI at b-values of 500 s mm(-2), a finding attributable to central necrosis.\n\nManagement of Peritonitis After Minimally Invasive Colorectal Surgery: Can We Stick to Laparoscopy?\n\nPubMed\n\nMarano, Alessandra; Giuffrida, Maria Carmela; Giraudo, Giorgio; Pellegrino, Luca; Borghi, Felice\n\n2017-04-01\n\nAlthough laparoscopy is becoming the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal disease, its application in case of postoperative peritonitis is still not widespread. The objective of this article is to evaluate the role of laparoscopy in the management of postoperative peritonitis after elective minimally invasive colorectal resection for malignant and benign diseases. Between April 2010 and May 2016, 536 patients received primary minimally invasive colorectal surgery at our Department. Among this series, we carried out a retrospective study of those patients who, having developed signs of peritonitis, were treated with a laparoscopic reintervention. Patient demographics, type of complication and of the main relaparoscopic treatment, and main outcomes of reoperation were recorded. A total of 20 patients (3.7%) underwent relaparoscopy for the management of postoperative peritonitis, of which exact causes were detected by laparoscopy in 75% as follows: anastomotic leakage (nâ=â8, 40%), colonic ischemia (nâ=â2, 10%), iatrogenic bowel tear (nâ=â4, 20%), and other (nâ=â1, 5%). The median time between operations was 3.5 days (range, 2-8). The laparoscopic reintervention was tailored case by case and ranged from lavage and drainage to redo anastomosis with ostomy fashioning. Conversion rate was 10% and overall morbidity was 50%. No cases required additional surgery and 30-day mortality was nil. Three patients (15%) were admitted to intensive care unit for 24-hour surveillance. Our experience suggests that in experienced hands and in hemodynamically stable patients, a prompt laparoscopic reoperation appears as an accurate diagnostic tool and an effective and safe option for the treatment of postoperative peritonitis after primary colorectal minimally invasive surgery.\n\nModified selection criteria for complete cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC based on peritoneal cancer index and small bowel involvement for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.\n\nPubMed\n\nElias, D; Mariani, A; Cloutier, A-S; Blot, F; GoÃ©rÃ©, D; Dumont, F; HonorÃ©, C; Billard, V; Dartigues, P; Ducreux, M\n\n2014-11-01\n\nComplete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is on the verge of becoming the gold standard treatment for selected patients presenting peritoneal metastases (PM) of colorectal origin. PM is scored with the peritoneal cancer index (PCI), which is the main prognostic factor. However, small bowel (SB) involvement could exert an independent prognostic impact. To define an adequate cut-off for the PCI and to appraise whether SB involvement exerts an impact on this cut-off. Patients (n = 139) treated with CCRS plus HIPEC were prospectively verified and retrospectively analyzed. One hundred presented with SB involvement of different extents and at different locations. All the patients with a PCI â¥ 15 exhibited SB involvement. Five-year overall survival was 48% when the PCI was <15 vs 12% when it was â¥ 15 (p < 0.0001. The multivariate analysis retained two prognostic factors: PCI â¥ 15 (p = 0.02, HR = 1.8), and the involvement of area 12 (lower ileum) (p = 0.001, HR = 3.1). When area 12 was invaded, it significantly worsened the prognosis: 5-year overall survival of patients with a PCI <15 and area 12 involved was 15%, close to that of patients with a PCI â¥ 15 (12%) and far lower than that of patients with a PCI <15 and no area 12 involvement (70%). A PCI greater than 15 appears to be a relative contraindication for treatment of colorectal PM with CCRS + HIPEC. Involvement of the lower ileum is also a negative prognostic factor to be taken into consideration. Copyright Â© 2014.

This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of hepatic resection for metastases not of colorectal, neuroendocrine, sarcomatous, or ovarian (NCNSO) origin and to identify predictors of outcome. Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing resection for NCNSO metastases in three western centers. Patients were analyzed according to the primary cancer. Outcomes were recurrence and survival. We analyzed 188 patients, divided in: gastrointestinal (59), breast (59) and \"others\" (70). Median time to recurrence was 15.3 months, while median survival was 52 months. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 78%, 60.4% and 47.8%, respectively. In term of prognostic factors, metastases >35Â mm from gastrointestinal tumors were associated with lower survival (pÂ =Â 0.029) and age>60 years was associated with better survival in breast metastases (pÂ =Â 0.018). Liver resection for NCNSO metastases is feasible and results in long-term survival are similar to colorectal metastases. In gastrointestinal metastases, size (<35Â mm) could be used to select patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Peter\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAssessing the therapeutic benefit of surgical navigation systems is a challenging problem in image-guided surgery. The exact clinical indications for patients that may benefit from these systems is not always clear, particularly for abdominal surgery where image-guidance systems have failed to take hold in the same way as orthopedic and neurosurgical applications. We report interim analysis of a prospective clinical trial for localizing small colorectal liver metastases using the Explorer system (Path Finder Technologies, Nashville, TN). Colorectal liver metastases are small lesions that can be difficult to identify with conventional intraoperative ultrasound due to echogeneity changes in the liver as a result of chemotherapy and other preoperative treatments. Interim analysis with eighteen patients shows that 9 of 15 (60%) of these occult lesions could be detected with image guidance. Image guidance changed intraoperative management in 3 (17%) cases. These results suggest that image guidance is a promising tool for localization of small occult liver metastases and that the indications for image-guided surgery are expanding.\n\nHepatic Resection for Colorectal Liver Metastases: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBeard, Stephen M.; Holmes, Michael; Price, Charles; Majeed, Ali W.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nObjective To analyze the cost-effectiveness of resection for liver metastases compared with standard nonsurgical cytotoxic treatment. Summary Background Data The efficacy of hepatic resection for metastases from colorectal cancer has been debated, despite reported 5-year survival rates of 20% to 40%. Resection is confined to specialized centers and is not widely available, perhaps because of lack of appropriate expertise, resources, or awareness of its efficacy. The cost-effectiveness of resection is important from the perspective of managed care in the United States and for the commissioning of health services in the United Kingdom. Methods A simple decision-based model was developed to evaluate the marginal costs and health benefits of hepatic resection. Estimates of resectability for liver metastases were taken from UK-reported case series data. The results of 100 hepatic resections conducted in Sheffield from 1997 to 1999 were used for the cost calculation of liver resection. Survival data from published series of resections were compiled to estimate the incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) because of the short period of follow-up in the Sheffield series. Results Hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases provides an estimated marginal benefit of 1.6 life-years (undiscounted) at a marginal cost of Â£6,742. If 17% of patients have only palliative resections, the overall cost per LYG is approximately Â£5,236 (Â£5,985 with discounted benefits). If potential benefits are extended to include 20-year survival rates, these figures fall to approximately Â£1,821 (Â£2,793 with discounted benefits). Further univariate sensitivity analysis of key model parameters showed the cost per LYG to be consistently less than Â£15,000. Conclusion In this model, hepatic resection appears highly cost-effective compared with nonsurgical treatments for colorectal-related liver metastases.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of abdominal irrigation with PVPI on the intestinal epithelial barrier in a colorectal cancer (CRC)-induced rat model. The CRC model was induced in rats with azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. Next, a total of 24 male CRC-induced rats were randomly divided into three groups (nÂ =Â 8): (1) a sham-operated group, (2) an NS group (peritoneal lavage 0.9% NaCl), and (3) a PVPI group (peritoneal lavage with 0.45%-0.55% PVPI). The mean arterial pressure was continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The levels of plasma endotoxin and D-lactate, blood gases, and protein concentration were measured. The ultrastructural changes of the epithelial tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The mean arterial pressure after peritoneal lavage was lower in the PVPI group than that in the NS group. The protein concentration and levels of endotoxin and D-lactate were higher in the PVPI group than they were in the PVPI group. In addition, PVPI treatment resulted in a markedly severe metabolic acidosis and intestinal mucosal injury compared with NS rats. Peritoneal lavage with PVPI dramatically compromises the integrity of the intestinal mucosa barrier and causes endotoxin shock in CRC rats. It is unsafe for clinical applications to include peritoneal lavage with PVPI in colorectal operations. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To analyze the factors associated with favorable survival in patients with inoperable colorectal lung metastases treated with percutaneous image-guided radiofrequency ablation. Methods. Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 398 metastases were ablated in 122 patients (87 male, median age 68 years, range 29-90 years) at 256 procedures. Percutaneous CT-guided cool-tip radiofrequency ablation was performed under sedation/general anesthesia. Maximum tumor size, number of tumors ablated, number of procedures, concurrent/prior liver ablation, previous liver or lung resection, systemic chemotherapy, disease-free interval from primary resection to lung metastasis, and survival from first ablation were recorded prospectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, andmoreÂ Â» factors were compared by log rank test. Results. The initial number of metastases ablated was 2.3 (range 1-8); the total number was 3.3 (range 1-15). The maximum tumor diameter was 1.7 (range 0.5-4) cm, and the number of procedures was 2 (range 1-10). The major complication rate was 3.9 %. Overall median and 3-year survival rate were 41 months and 57 %. Survival was better in patients with smaller tumors-a median of 51 months, with 3-year survival of 64 % for tumors 2 cm or smaller versus 31 months and 44 % for tumors 2.1-4 cm (p = 0.08). The number of metastases ablated and whether the tumors were unilateral or bilateral did not affect survival. The presence of treated liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy, or prior lung resection did not affect survival. Conclusion. Three-year survival of 57 % in patients with inoperable colorectal lung metastases is better than would be expected with chemotherapy alone. Patients with inoperable but small-volume colorectal lung metastases should be referred for ablation.Â«Â less\n\nShort-Term Outcomes of Simultaneous Laparoscopic Colectomy and Hepatectomy for Primary Colorectal Cancer With Synchronous Liver Metastases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nInoue, Akira; Uemura, Mamoru; Yamamoto, Hirofumi; Hiraki, Masayuki; Naito, Atsushi; Ogino, Takayuki; Nonaka, Ryoji; Nishimura, Junichi; Wada, Hiroshi; Hata, Taishi; Takemasa, Ichiro; Eguchi, Hidetoshi; Mizushima, Tsunekazu; Nagano, Hiroaki; Doki, Yuichiro; Mori, Masaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlthough simultaneous resection of primary colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases is reported to be safe and effective, the feasibility of a laparoscopic approach remains controversial. This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of simultaneous laparoscopic surgery for primary colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. From September 2008 to December 2013, 10 patients underwent simultaneous laparoscopic resection of primary colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases with curative intent at our institute. The median operative time was 452 minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 245 mL. Median times to discharge from the hospital and adjuvant chemotherapy were 13.5 and 44 postoperative days, respectively. Negative resection margins were achieved in all cases, with no postoperative mortality or major morbidity. Simultaneous laparoscopic colectomy and hepatectomy for primary colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases appears feasible with low morbidity and favorable outcomes.

In CRC patients, metastases are the main cause of cancer-related mortality. In a group of metastatic CRC patients, the metastases are limited to a single site (solitary organ); the liver and lungs are the most commonly involved sites. When metastatic disease is limited to the liver and/or lungs, the resectability of the metastatic lesions will dictate the management approach and the outcome. Less commonly, the site of solitary organ CRC metastasis is the peritoneum. In these patients, cytoreduction followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may improve the outcome. Rarely, CRC involves other organs, such as the brain, bone, adrenals and spleen, as the only site of metastatic disease. There are limited data to guide clinical practice in these cases. Here, we have reviewed the disease characteristics, management approaches and prognosis based on the metastatic disease site in patients with CRC with metastases to a single organ.

In colorectal cancer, ICG can be used to detect lymph node metastasis and hepatic metastasis on the surface of the liver. In peritoneal carcinomatosis, it was previously suspected that the diffusion of ICG in the tumor mass was due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect; however, this phenomenon has not been clearly demonstrated. Using bevacizumab, an antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor that consequently inhibits neoangiogenesis, we sought to confirm the mode of ICG diffusion. We compared the fluorescence of peritoneal carcinomatosis nodules from patients who had previously received bevacizumab during their oncologic treatment with those who did not receive this therapy. The sensitivity of the carcinomatosis nodule fluorescence was higher in the patients who did not receive bevacizumab compared with those who received the drug (76.3% and 65.0%, respectively). The rate of false-negative results was higher in the bevacizumab group than in the group that did not receive the drug (53.8% and 42.9%, respectively). Using bevacizumab, we demonstrate that the enhanced permeability and retention effect causes ICG accumulation in peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from colorectal cancer.\n\nDetection and functional analysis of tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TIL) in liver metastases from colorectal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nWagner, Philipp; Koch, Moritz; Nummer, Daniel; Palm, Sylvia; Galindo, Luis; Autenrieth, Daniel; Rahbari, Nuh; Schmitz-Winnenthal, Friedrich H; Schirrmacher, Volker; BÃ¼chler, Markus W; Beckhove, Philipp; Weitz, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2008-08-01\n\nTumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) play an important role in primary colorectal cancer, but their activity in liver metastases has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to examine whether tumor-selective infiltration, activation, and cytotoxic activity of TIL can be demonstrated in situ in colorectal liver metastases. TIL were obtained from liver metastases and corresponding normal liver tissue of 16 patients with colorectal liver metastases. Characterization of TIL in situ was performed by multicolor flowcytometric analysis. Presence of tumor antigen-reactive T cells was evaluated by interferon gamma Elispot analysis. TIL in colorectal liver metastases responding against tumor antigens were present in most patients. Although the proportions of CD3(+) T cells were comparable in liver metastasis and normal liver tissue, metastases contained significantly enhanced proportions of CD4(+) cells (49% vs. 22%, P < .001). Among all CD4(+) T helper cells, the proportion of activated (CD4(+)CD25(+)) effector cells was significantly increased in liver metastases (15.0% vs. 7.8%, P = .003). Metastases showed significantly higher proportions of activated (CD69(+) [70.1% vs. 49.8%, P = .02] and CD25(+) [4.1% vs. .6%, P = .06]) and cytotoxically active (CD107a(+)) CD8(+) TIL (3.2% vs. 1.3%, P = .03). Importantly, the presence of activated T helper cells correlated with the frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that exerted cytotoxic activity in situ (P = .02). CD4(+) and CD8(+) TIL are selectively activated in liver metastases, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes exert tumor-selective cytotoxic activity in situ in the presence of activated T helper cells, suggesting the requirement of in-situ-activated T helper cells for efficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes effector function.\n\nHepatic Cryotherapy and Subsequent Hepatic Arterial Chemotherapy for Colorectal Metastases to the Liver\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlwan, Majeed H.; Booth, Michael W.

Patients with colorectal metastases confined to the liver but not suitable for resection, and with liver involvement of less than 50% were offered the treatment. Prospective documentation of all patients was undertaken with data being recorded on a computerised database. Patients had a median of 6 (2â15) lesions with sizes ranging from 1â12 cm. There was no 30 day mortality. Postoperative complications developed in 8 patients but were followed by full recovery in all instances. Side effects from chemotherapy occured in 23% of cycles. Twenty seven patients have died. Median survival from the time of cryotherapy was 18.2 months (7â34), or 23months (9â44) from diagnosis of liver lesions. Hepatic cryotherapy with subsequent arterial chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated. The results suggest survival of patients with colorectal hepatic metastases can be improved by the use of this modality of treatment.

Intravital imaging of exteriorized livers was performed in 72 live mice. Three groups of mice were studied: a sham-operated control group (n = 24), a group with nonmetastasizing subcutaneous gliomas (n = 24), and a group with developing hepatic CX-1 colon cancer metastases (n = 24). Microvascular flow parameters, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, and wall shear stress were directly measured in hepatic sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules at 2-day intervals prior to and during the development of metastases. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used initially to test for overall equality of medians in each data group. Single posttest comparisons of independent samples were performed with the Mann-Whitney test, with an overall statistical significance of .05. Prior to the development of visible colorectal cancer metastases, significant (P <.05) reductions occurred in sinusoidal and postsinusoidal flow and wall shear rates, coupled with increased leukocyte rolling and adherence. With tumor growth, flow was further compromised in 92% of tumors larger than 0.5 mm in diameter by extrinsic compression of sinusoids and portal venules and narrowing caused by adherent leukocytes. Significant intrahepatic flow alterations occur in mouse livers prior to growth of visible metastases and provide a rational explanation for elevation in the Doppler perfusion index that occurs prior to tumor formation.\n\nSequential surgical resection of hepatic and pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOevermann, Elisabeth; Killaitis, Claudia; Kujath, Peter; Hoffmann, Martin; Bruch, Hans-Peter\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Resection of isolated hepatic or pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer is widely accepted and associated with a 5-year survival rate of 25â40%. The value of aggressive surgical management in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases still remains a controversial area. Materials and methods A retrospective review of 1,497 patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was analysed. Of 73 patients identified with resection of CRC and, at some point in time, both liver and lung metastases, 17 patients underwent metastasectomy (resection group). The remaining 56 patients comprised the non-resection group. Primary tumour, hepatic and pulmonary metastases of all patients were surgically treated in our department of surgery, and the results are that of a single institution. Results The resection group had a 3-year survival of 77%, a 5-year survival of 55% and a 10-year survival of 18%; median survival was 98Â months. The longest overall survival was 136Â months; six patients are still alive. In the resection group, overall survival was significantly higher than in the non-resection group (pâ<â0.01). Independent from the chronology of metastasectomy, 5-year survival was 55% with respect to the primary resection, 28% with respect to the first metastasectomy and 14% with respect to the second metastasectomy. A disease-free interval (>18Â months), stage III (UICC) and age (<70Â years) were found to be significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Conclusion Our report strongly supports aggressive surgical therapy in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases from CRC. Overall survival for surgically treated selected patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases from CRC is comparable to hepatic or pulmonary metastasectomy. Simultaneous metastases tend to have a poorer outcome than metachronous metastases.

Currently, promising treatment options are available for selected patients with PM from colorectal, appendiceal, ovarian or gastric carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, treatment and survival of patients presenting with PM in whom the origin of PM remains unknown. Data from patients diagnosed with PM of unknown origin during 1984-2010 were extracted from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry. European age-standardised incidence rates were calculated and data on treatment and survival were analysed. In total 1051 patients were diagnosed with PM of unknown origin. In 606 patients (58%) the peritoneum was the only site of metastasis, and 445 patients also had other metastases. Chemotherapy usage has increased from 8% in the earliest period to 16% in most recent years (p=.016). Median survival was extremely poor with only 42days (95% confidence interval (CI) 39-47days) and did not change over time. Median survival of patients not receiving chemotherapy was significantly worse than of those receiving chemotherapy (36 versus 218days, p<.0001). The prognosis of PM of unknown origin is extremely poor and did not improve over time. Given the recent progress that has been achieved in selected patients presenting with PM, maximum efforts should be undertaken in order to diagnose the origin of PM as accurately as possible. Potentially effective treatment strategies should be further explored for patients in whom the organ of origin remains unknown. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Between 2006 and 2015, all patients undergoing combined resection of primary colorectal cancer and liver metastases were included in the study (n=43). Laparoscopic and open groups were compared regarding clinical, perioperative and oncologic outcomes. Results There were 29 patients in the open group and 14 patients in the laparoscopic group. The groups were similar regarding demographics, comorbidities, histopathological characteristics of the primary tumor and liver metastases. Postoperative complication rate (44.8% vs. 7.1%, P=0.016) was higher, and hospital stay (10 vs. 6.4 days, P=0.001) longer in the open compared to the laparoscopic group. Overall survival (OS) was comparable between the groups (P=0.10); whereas, disease-free survival (DFS) was longer in laparoscopic group (P=0.02). Conclusions According to the results, in patients, whose primary colorectal cancer and metastatic liver disease was amenable to a minimally invasive resection, a concomitant laparoscopic approach resulted in less morbidity without compromising oncologic outcomes. This suggests that a laparoscopic approach may be considered in appropriate patients by surgeons with experience in both advanced laparoscopic liver and colorectal techniques.

These improved outcomes have become more commonplace via achievements in multidisciplinary care, improved definition of resectability, and advances in technical skill. Even patients with synchronous and/or extensive bilateral disease have benefited from novel surgical strategies. Treatment sequencing of synchronous CRC with CLM can be simplified into the following three paradigms: (classic colorectal-first), simultaneous (combined), or reverse approach (liver-first). The decision of whether to treat the CLM or CRC first depends on which site dominates oncologically and symptomatically. Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) are the foundations of modern chemotherapy. Although each regimen has positively impacted survivals, both have the potential for negative effects on the non-tumor liver. Oxaliplatin is associated with vascular injury (sinusoidal ballooning, microvascular injury, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and long-term fibrosis) but not steatosis. Irinotecan has been associated with steatohepatitis, especially in patients with obesity and diabetes. Steatohepatitis from irinotecan is the only chemotherapy-associated liver injury (CALI) associated with increased mortality from postoperative hepatic insufficiency. Extended duration of preoperative chemotherapy is also associated with CALI. To determine resectability and to prevent overtreatment with systemic therapy, all patients should receive high-quality cross-sectional imaging and be evaluated by a hepatobiliary surgeon before starting chemotherapy. Even as chemotherapy improves, liver surgeons will continue to play a central role in treatment planning by offering the best chance for prolonged survival-safe R0 resection with curative intent.\n\nCytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemoperfusion in Adolescent and Young Adults with Peritoneal Metastases.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhir, Mashaal; Ramalingam, Lekshmi; Shuai, Yongli; Pakrafter, Sam; Jones, Heather L; Hogg, Melissa E; Zureikat, Amer H; Holtzman, Matthew P; Ahrendt, Steven A; Bahary, Nathan; Pingpank, James F; Zeh, Herbert J; Bartlett, David L; Choudry, Haroon A\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSeveral studies suggest that young patients may derive less oncologic benefit from surgical resection of cancers compared with older patients. We hypothesized that young patients may have worse outcomes following cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (CRS/HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes in adolescent and young adults (AYA), defined as younger than age 40Â years (nÂ =Â 135), undergoing CRS/HIPEC between 2001 and 2015 were reviewed and compared with middle-aged adults, defined as aged 40-65Â years (nÂ =Â 684). The two groups were similar with regards to perioperative characteristics except that AYA were more likely to be symptomatic at presentation (65.2 vs. 50.9%, pÂ =Â 0.003), had lower Charleson comorbidity index (median 6 vs. 8, pÂ <Â 0.001), were less likely to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (32.8 vs. 42.5%, pÂ =Â 0.042), and had longer operative times (median 543 vs. 493Â min, pÂ =Â 0.010). Postoperative Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 morbidity was lower in AYA (17 vs. 26%, pÂ =Â 0.029), and they required fewer reoperations for complications (3.7 vs. 10.4%, pÂ =Â 0.014). AYA had longer median overall survival (103.6 vs. 73.2Â months, pÂ =Â 0.053). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, age was an independent predictor of improved overall survival [hazard ratio 0.705; 0.516-0.963, pÂ =Â 0.028]. Young patients with peritoneal metastases derive similar benefits from CRS/HIPEC as middle-aged patients. Young age should not be a deterrent to consideration of CRS/HIPEC for peritoneal metastases.\n\nImproving results of surgery for fecal peritonitis due to perforated colorectal disease: A single center experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nMineccia, Michela; Zimmitti, Giuseppe; Ribero, Dario; Giraldi, Francesco; Bertolino, Franco; Brambilla, Romeo; Ferrero, Alessandro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nfecal peritonitis due to colorectal perforation is a dramatic event characterized by high mortality. Our study aims at determining how results of sigmoid resection (eventually extended to upper rectum) for colorectal perforation with fecal peritonitis changed in recent years and which factors affected eventual changes. Seventy-four patients were operated on at our institution (2005-2014) for colorectal perforation with fecal peritonitis and were divided into two numerically equal groups (operated on before (ERA1-group) and after (ERA2-group) May 2010). Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI) was calculated for each patient. Characteristics of two groups were compared. Predictors of postoperative outcomes were identified. Postoperative overall complications, major complications, and mortality occurred in 59%, 28%, and 18% of cases, respectively, and were less frequent in ERA2-group (51%, 16%, and 8%, respectively), compared to ERA1-group (68%, 41%, and 27%, respectively; pÂ =Â .155, .02, and .032, respectively). Such results paralleled lower MPI values in ERA2-group, compared to ERA1-group (23(16-39) vs. 28(21-43), pÂ =Â .006). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the best cut-off value for MPI for predicting postoperative complications and mortality was 28.5. MPI>28 was the only independent predictor of postoperative overall (pÂ =Â .009, ORÂ =Â 4.491) and major complications (pÂ <Â .001, ORÂ =Â 23.182) and was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality (pÂ =Â .016, ORÂ =Â 13.444), as well as duration of preoperative peritonitis longer than 24Â h (pÂ =Â .045, ORÂ =Â 17.099). results of surgery for colorectal perforation with fecal peritonitis have improved over time, matching a concurrent decrease of MPI values and a better preoperative patient management. MPI value may help in selecting patients benefitting from surgical treatment. Copyright Â© 2015 IJS Publishing Group Limited. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Surgery in isolation may be approaching technical limits, but now is likely to help more patients because of success of complementary strategies, particularly newer chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Leaving behind disappearing metastases after chemotherapy, margin-positive resection, staged liver resection, and liver-first reversed management permit potentially curative surgery for patients previously unable to survive resection. Further, survival benefit from maximum debulking surgery, like ovarian cancer, for colorectal liver metastases is uncertain at present, but likely. Individualized multidisciplinary treatment planning using such strategies is essential.\n\nLiver metastases\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nMetastases to the liver; Metastatic liver cancer; Liver cancer - metastatic; Colorectal cancer - liver metastases; Colon cancer - liver metastases; Esophageal cancer - liver metastases; Lung cancer - liver metastases; Melanoma - liver metastases\n\nCurrent role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRampone, Bernardino; Schiavone, Beniamino; Martino, Antonio; Confuorto, Giuseppe\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPeritoneal carcinomatosis is one of the most common routes of dissemination of colorectal cancer (CRC). It is encountered in 7% of patients at primary surgery, while it develops in about 4% to 19% of patients after curative surgery and in up to 44% of patients with recurrent CRC. Peritoneal involvement from colorectal malignancies has been considered traditionally as a manifestation of terminal disease, due to limited response to conventional surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments. In the past few years the introduction of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion has shown promising results in selected patients. Currently, the surgical management of peritoneal surface malignancies of colonic origin with this combined locoregional therapy has resulted in a significant improvement in survival of these patients. However, further controlled studies will help to standardize indications and the technique of this locoregional therapy in order to achieve an improvement of morbidity and mortality rates.

Concerns have been raised about the high morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure, particularly when applied for diagnoses other than colorectal liver metastases. The aim of this study was to analyze the initial experience with associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy in cases of non-colorectal liver metastases and primary hepatobiliary malignancies in Scandinavia. A retrospective analysis of all associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy procedures performed at two Swedish university hospitals for non-colorectal liver metastases and primary hepatobiliary malignancies was performed. The primary focus was on the safety of the procedure. Ten patients were included: four had hepatocellular cancer, three had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, one had a Klatskin tumor, one had ocular melanoma metastasis, and one had a metastasis from a Wilms' tumor. All patients completed both operations, and the highest grade of complication (according to the Clavien-Dindo classification) was 3A, which was observed in one patient. No 90-day mortality was observed. Radical resection (R0) was achieved in nine patients, while the resection was R2 in one patient. The low morbidity and mortality observed in this cohort compared with those of earlier reports on associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy for diagnoses other than colorectal liver metastases may be related to the selection of patients with limited comorbidity. In addition, procedures other than associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy had been avoided in most of the patients. In conclusion, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy can be applied to primary hepatobiliary malignancies and non-colorectal\n\nHistopathological findings in colorectal liver metastases after electrochemotherapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGasljevic, Gorana; Edhemovic, Ibrahim; Cemazar, Maja; Brecelj, Erik; Gadzijev, Eldar M.; Music, Maja M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nElectrochemotherapy of colorectal liver metastases has been proven to be feasible, safe and effective in a phase I/II study. In that study, a specific group of patients underwent two-stage operation, and the detailed histopathological evaluation of the resected tumors is presented here. Regressive changes in electrochemotherapy-treated liver metastases were evaluated after the second operation (in 8â10 weeks) in 7 patients and 13 metastases when the treated metastases were resected. Macroscopic and microscopic changes were analyzed. Electrochemotherapy induced coagulation necrosis in the treated area encompassing both tumor and a narrow band of normal tissue. The area became necrotic, encapsulated in a fibrous envelope while preserving the functionality of most of the vessels larger than 5 mm in diameter and a large proportion of biliary structures, but the smaller blood vessels displayed various levels of damage. At the time of observation, 8â10 weeks after electrochemotherapy, regenerative changes were already seen in the peripheral parts of the treated area. This study demonstrates regressive changes in the whole electrochemotherapy-treated area of the liver. Further evidence of disruption of vessels less than 5 mm in diameter and preservation of the larger vessels by electrochemotherapy is provided. These findings are important because electrochemotherapy has been indicated for the therapy of metastases near major blood vessels in the liver to provide a safe approach with good antitumor efficacy.

The existing methods for the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer seem to be insufficient to predict its aggressiveness, leading to poor outcomes for the patient. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, which interact with mRNAs in a post-transcriptional stage, and have been found to be involved in pathogenesis of cancer and its metastases. Their utility in diagnosis of colorectal liver metastasis gains ground through serum or tissue examination. Several miRNAs are related to colorectal cancer and its liver metastasis. Some of them have oncogenic and other tumor suppressive role in the development of colorectal liver metastasis, while many of them have been proved to be correlated with the overall survival and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of the present review is to give a detailed account of the different miRNAs that have been described as playing a role in hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, emphasizing their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.

In the past, peritoneal carcinomatosis in CRC was thought to be equivalent to distant metastasis; however, the transcoelomic spread of malignant cells is an acknowledged alternative pathway. Metastasectomy with curative intent is well accepted in patients with liver metastasis in CRC despite the paucity of randomized trials. Therefore, there is rationale for local treatment with peritonectomy to eliminate macroscopic disease, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy to destroy any residual free tumour cells within the peritoneal cavity. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current evidence for cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis in CRC.

For the last two decades, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with intraoperative hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been popularised by Paul Sugarbaker almost doubling survival in selected patients compared with systemic chemotherapy alone. Nowadays, this particular treatment protocol is available in comprehensive cancer centres with reasonable mortality and morbidity. However, patient selection is still challenging. In general, CRS and HIPEC is indicated in primary peritoneal tumours such as mesothelioma and pseudomyxoma peritonei as well as in peritoneal metastases derived from gastrointestinal malignancies and ovarian cancers. Since systemic tumour spread is uncommon in patients with peritoneal metastases, peritoneal tumour dissemination was defined as localised disease within the \"compartment abdomen\". However, CRS and HIPEC are only beneficial as long as complete cytoreduction is achieved (CC-0 or CC-1). Histopathological parameters, the Sugarbaker peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) and general condition of the patient have been established as patient selection criteria. In primary peritoneal cancers, individual tumour biology is the predominant criterium for patient selection as opposed to intraabdominal tumour load in peritoneal metastases derived from gastrointestinal cancers. In gastric cancer, CRS and HIPEC should be restricted to synchronous limited disease because of its biological aggressiveness. In patients with free floating cancer cells without macroscopic signs of peritoneal spread, however, CRS and HIPEC following preoperative \"neoadjuvant\" chemotherapy preserves chances for cure. So far, there is no general recommendation for CRS and HIPEC by clinical practice guidelines. In the recent S3 guideline for treatment of colorectal cancer, however, CRS and HIPEC have been included as possible treatment options.

A.; Brandt, Alexandra; Galjart, Boris; Kwekkeboom, Jaap; Bruno, Marco J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Purpose: Liver metastasis develops in >50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and is a leading cause of CRC-related mortality. We aimed to identify which inhibitory immune checkpoint pathways can be targeted to enhance functionality of intra-tumoral T-cells in mismatch repair-proficient liver metastases of colorectal cancer (LM-CRC). Methodology: Intra-tumoral expression of multiple inhibitory molecules was compared among mismatch repair-proficient LM-CRC, peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer (PM-CRC) and primary CRC. Expression of inhibitory molecules was also analyzed on leukocytes isolated from paired resected metastatic liver tumors, tumor-free liver tissues, and blood of patients with mismatch repair-proficient LM-CRC. The effects of blocking inhibitory pathways on tumor-infiltrating T-cell responses were studied in ex vivo functional assays. Results: Mismatch repair-proficient LM-CRC showed higher expression of inhibitory receptors on intra-tumoral T-cells and contained higher proportions of CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells and monocytes than mismatch repair-proficient primary CRC and/or PM-CRC. Inhibitory receptors LAG3, PD-1, TIM3 and CTLA4 were higher expressed on CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-helper and/or regulatory T-cells in LM-CRC tumors compared with tumor-free liver and blood. Antibody blockade of LAG3 or PD-L1 increased proliferation and effector cytokine production of intra-tumoral T-cells isolated from LM-CRC in response to both polyclonal and autologous tumor-specific stimulations. Higher LAG3 expression on intra-tumoral CD8+ T-cells associated with longer progression-free survival of LM-CRC patients. Conclusion: Mismatch repair-proficient LM-CRC may be more sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors than mismatch repair-proficient primary CRC. Blocking LAG3 enhances tumor-infiltrating T-cell responses of mismatch repair-proficient LM-CRC, and therefore may be a new promising immunotherapeutic target for LM-CRC.\n\nRecent Advances in Chemotherapy and Surgery for Colorectal Liver Metastases.\n\nPubMed\n\nPassot, Guillaume; Soubrane, Olivier; Giuliante, Felice; Zimmitti, Giuseppe; GoÃ©rÃ©, Diane; Yamashita, Suguru; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe liver is the most common site of metastases for colorectal cancer, and combined resection with systemic chemotherapy is the most effective strategy for survival. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary on four hot topics related to chemotherapy and surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CLM), namely: (1) chemotherapy-related liver injuries: prediction and impact, (2) surgery for initially unresectable CLM, (3) the emerging role of RA"
