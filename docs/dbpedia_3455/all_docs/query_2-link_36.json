        "text": "PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA brief of the main objective and scope of the project, including proposed method, and expected outcome. The abstract should clearly identify if the project is a case study, site investigation, a prototypical experiment, or any other form of research.\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\n3A. Project Description: a clear and comprehensive description of the project, its objectives, main tasks and outcomes. The description includes conditions addressed, questions asked, or hypotheses tested. The description must also describe if a similar project of this type has been done before, how it is different, what is aims to accomplish, and what is the substantive contribution to the field of landscape.\n\n3B. Project Background: a succinct outline of the project’s specific spatial, ecological and geographic context. The project background should also outline the historic, theoretical, scientific, representational, or practical discourse of the project, in relation to research and design in landscape architecture. Background information should be supported by relevant sources which might include reference literature, case studies, precedents, past projects. Clear and concise graphic illustration of the project background is encouraged.\n\nPROJECT METHODS\n\nA short explanation that describes the method that will be used to accomplish the main project tasks. In this section, precedents, historic case studies, earlier work with methods like those suggested in the proposal may be cited and will be used to clearly frame the discourse and the type of project in question. The project might be also identified in this section with specific modes of landscape architecture practice. The methods section should also describe if travel is essential for the coherent development of the research project and why.\n\nThe Landscape Architectural Research: Inquiry, Strategy, Design by M. Elen Deming and Simon Swaffield (2010) is a helpful guide regarding research methods in landscape architecture.\n\nThere might be human subjects involved in the content of the research. In such cases, research needs to be guided by the ethical principles set forth in the Belmont Report, which seeks the Protection of Human Subjects of Research. For research projects that deal with human subjects, it is strongly recommended that awarded students send their proposal to the Harvard’s Committee on the Use of Human Subjects for revision. Visit the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects page for more information.\n\nVISUAL MATERIAL\n\nAdditional graphic material in the form of maps and diagrams may be provided to support the project proposal by illustrating the area of research, the content of the research, visual methodologies, and examples of the outcomes. All project imaging should be high resolution, with captions and sources.\n\nPROJECT SCHEDULE AND ITINERARY\n\nA detailed description of the project timetable, start and end dates, timeline for main tasks, travel itinerary (if applicable) and sequence of deliverables. Please note that reasonable time must be dedicated to advance the definition of the project itself, to the preparation of the logistics of the trip (if applicable), and to the completion of the deliverables. If traveling, you may consider including a map of the area in which the project is to be developed, particularly if there are specific itineraries within the area that would help the committee understand the nature of your trip.\n\nPROJECT BUDGET\n\nA detailed itemization of all anticipated expenses including:\n\nTravel (air and ground travel)\n\nAccommodations (hotel)\n\nEquipment and Resources (supplies, fuel, power, documentation, reproduction, copy)\n\nIncidentals (security, visa, guide, translation)\n\nAlthough expenses for food and normal per diem costs are not covered by the Fund, project budgeting must demonstrate a clear understanding of project expenses and regional incidentals. The budget should not underestimate costs that might adversely affect the outcomes of the project. Any additional funding sources from other grant agencies must be disclosed.\n\nAny equipment purchased with the funds remains the property of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and must be returned to the Department of Landscape Architecture upon completion of the project.\n\nANTICIPATED OUTCOMES AND PROJECT DOCUMENTATION\n\nA description of tangible benefits, findings, and contributions of the project to the discipline of landscape architecture and fields of design. Provide a definition of actual outcomes (a conference, a paper, a map, a presentation, an interview, an installation) with relevant dates, as applicable. Outcomes and deliverables must be tangible, substantive, and feasible.\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE\n\nApplicant(s) must submit a maximum 2-page CV outlining their education, experience, and other relevant background to demonstrate capability and responsibility. For proposals developed by teams, each student can include an individual 2-page CV.\n\nLITERATURE AND REFERENCES\n\nA brief list of references, books, websites from preliminary research that demonstrates knowledge of the project discourse, area, and scope.\n\nPROJECT ADVISORS\n\nList 2 project advisors, including an Internal Faculty Advisor from the GSD, and an External Project Advisor related to the project tasks. List names, positions, and contact information, including email address and mailing address. Advisors may be contacted during the Selection Process.\n\nThe Internal Faculty Advisor should not be someone on the Faculty Jury Committee who reviews the proposals.\n\nGSD faculty advisors can be from any department.\n\nSUBMITTING APPLICATION\n\nThe deadline to submit proposals is February 5th, 2024, 11:59 pm EST.\n\nApplicants must complete the online proposal form here.\n\nLate or incomplete proposals will not be accepted.\n\n2014\n\nDalal Alsayer (MDes ULE) – Hidden Space | Social Space: Migrant Workers and their Spaces in the GCC\n\nRebekah Armstrong (MLA I) and Vanessa Moon (MLA I AP/MUP) – Green Desert: Acacia saligna and Atriplex nummularia in Region IV, Chile\n\nChristopher Bennett (MDes ULE) – DredgeShed: Sand as Landscape, Sand as Commodity, Sand as Gold\n\nJasper Campshure (MArch) – Papas chilotas: The Agricultural Crop as the Basis for Establishing Hereditary Land Rights in the Chiloé Archipelago\n\nDane Carlson (MLA II) – Descent: following the kali gandaki down from the roof of the world\n\nManuel Colon Amador (MLA I AP), Michalis Pirokka (MLA I AP), and Hector Tarrido-Picart (MLA I AP/MAUD) – Urban Wild Lab: Remote Sensing Landscapes and Urban Ecologies\n\nDanika Cooper (MLA I AP/MDes ULE) – Dust Kingdom: A Description of Dust in the American Southwest\n\nAnya Domlesky (MLA I) – Surveying Environmental Landscape Modeling: Three Physical Modelers of Coastal Processes\n\nMichelle Franco (MLA I) – We Ground Things Now, On Moving Foundations: Landscape Film in Theory & Practice\n\nChristina Geros (MLA I AP/MAUD) and Zannah Matson (MLA I) – Redefining Urban: Kotzebue, Alaska as a Case Study for the dual influences of settlement and junction\n\nStephanie Hsia (MLA I) – The Almond and the Bee: Investigating Landscape Interventions for the Greatest Pollination Quandary on Earth\n\nChristopher Johnson (MArch I AP) – Recreational Squatting: Skate Culture and the Appropriation of Infrastructural Landscapes\n\nMikaela Pearson (MLA I AP) and David Pearson (MArch II) – Unearthing Larrea tridentate: Micro-Mapping Extensive Fibrous Root Structures\n\nPablo Perez Ramos (DDes;
