        "meta_description": "Rockfill dams are very widely constructed all over the world due to their good adaptability to diverse geological and geographical conditions, and their relatively low cost compared to other dam types. However, natural satisfactory sites are increasingly difficult to find in many countries due to past dam development. In some circumstance, building dams over thick overburden layers is unavoidable. In this chapter, Chinese practices in constructing high earth and rockfill dams over thick overburden layers are reviewed. The geological and geotechnical investigation techniques are briefly summarized, and seepage control systems of some selected cases as well as the connection of the impervious systems of both the dams and their foundation layers are described. Commonly used foundation improvement techniques are also presented, followed by simple descriptions of aspects that require further research and development.",

        "text": "3.1.1. The Xiaolangdi ECRD\n\nThe Xiaolangdi ECRD was constructed on the well-known, sediment-laden Yellow River. The thickness of the underlying overburden is approximately 80 m, and it is composed of intricate sand and gravel layers. The dam uses an inclined core wall (low-plasticity loam) as the main anti-seepage barrier, as shown in Figure 1. A vertical concrete cutoff wall (1.2 m) was built within the overburden to control the underground seepage. The top of the cutoff wall was embedded into the core wall for 12 m, while its bottom end penetrates the rock surface for at least 1 m. The inclined core was extended using low permeable clayey soils along the top surface of the cofferdam on the upstream side, forming a horizontal blanket that is useful in lengthen the seepage path. The cutoff wall under the cofferdam was elongated into this blanket. It was assumed that the upstream blanket would connect naturally with sand sediments during long-term operation once the reservoir was impounded.\n\nDuring the design-phase for the Xiaolangdi ECRD, China had no experience in building such high rockfill dams on 80-m overburden layers, making this project a particularly difficult challenge. A number of alternative design proposals were also considered, including the complete removal of the overburden under the core wall and the use a horizontal impervious blanket without the permanent cutoff wall. Lessons learned from previous cases and, more importantly, technological advances in cutoff wall construction resulted in the final chosen design. The thickness of the cutoff wall was determined based on the allowable hydraulic gradient of concrete materials, the available equipment and stress–strain and seepage analyses results. Conventional concrete with a 28-d strength of 35 MPa was used for the main cutoff wall, while plastic concrete and high-pressure rotary jet grouting were used to construct the temporary cofferdam cutoff wall.\n\n3.1.2. The Changheba ECRD\n\nThe Changheba ECRD is currently one of the highest rockfill dams under construction in China (Table 1). It sits on a thick, three-layer overburden. All three layers, fglQ3, alQ41 and alQ42 (shown in Figure 2) consist mainly of coarse gravel materials and therefore have relatively high deformation moduli and bearing capacity, but also exhibit high permeability. Local liquefiable sand layers are, however, also distributed widely within the alQ41 layer. The dam is located in a high earthquake intensity region, where the peak acceleration for an exceedance probability of 0.02 in 100 years is 3.59 m/s2. Sand liquefaction under earthquake condition is therefore a potential problem for this dam. The existence of these sand layers may also cause uneven deformation of the dam. To avoid these adverse risks, sand layers beneath both the core wall and the filter layer were removed completely. The maximum thickness of the retained overburden under the core wall is about 53 m.\n\nTwo concrete cutoff walls were poured with a net distance of 14 m. Both walls penetrate into the bedrock for at least 1.5 m. The main cutoff wall (1.4 m) is located within the dam axis plane and is connected to the core wall by a grouting gallery. The auxiliary cutoff wall (1.2 m) is located upstream of the main wall and embeds into the core wall for 9 m. The core wall is constructed with gravelly soils, where the maximum core material diameter allowed is 150 mm. The percentage of particles finer than 5 mm (P5) ranges from 30–50%. Another two strict requirements for the core materials are P0.075 ≥ 15%, and P0.005 ≥ 8%. Curtain grouting was conducted through the preset pipes within the cutoff walls. In particular, curtain grouting under the main cutoff wall was extended to the level 5 m below the relatively impermeable layer (q < 3 Lu.)\n\n3.1.3. The Luding ECRD\n\nThe 84-m Luding ECRD was built on an overburden with a maximum thickness of 148 m. It is among the deepest overburden layers used as foundations of a rockfill dam in China. The complex soil and rock strata is shown in Figure 3. Four main layers can be observed: the fglQ3 layer, the prgl + alQ3 layer, the al + plQ4 layer, and the alQ42 layer. Basic properties of these layers are listed in Table 2. The third sub-layer of the prgl + alQ3 layer consists mainly of fine and silty sands, and therefore has a relatively low deformation modulus and a low bearing capacity. Sand lenses also exist in the second sub-layer of the prgl + alQ3 layer and the first sub-layer of the al + plQ4 layer.\n\nLayerDensityModulus and bearing capacityShear strengthPermeabilityρ (g/cm3)ρd (g/cm3)E0 (MPa)R (MPa)ϕ (°)c (MPa)k (cm/s)Jc1: fglQ32.20–2.302.05–2.1555–650.55–0.6530–3202–4 × 10−20.12–0.152-2: prgl + alQ32.05–2.152.00–2.0540–500.35–0.4526–2801–5 × 10−30.20–0.252-3: prgl + alQ31.60–1.701.40–1.6018–220.12–0.1615–1801–10 × 10−30.25–0.363-1: al + plQ42.10–2.202.05–2.1045–550.40–0.5029–3105–10 × 10−30.15–0.184: alQ422.15–2.252.00–2.1050–600.50–0.5528–3001–10 × 10−20.10–0.12\n\nThe dam uses a clay core as the anti-seepage barrier stabilized by the rockfill shoulders. The maximum diameter allowed for the core materials is 100 mm. Other restrictions imposed on the core materials are P5 ≥ 90%, P0.075 ≥ 60%, and P0.005 ≥ 15%. Repeated compaction near the optimum water content (±2%) produces a barrier with a coefficient of permeability less than 5 × 10−7 cm/s. A vertical concrete wall (1.0 m) was designed to cut off the foundation seepage water. The cutoff wall penetrates into the bedrock at both the left and right abutments of the dam. However, the overburden near the center of the canyon is so thick (148 m) that the current technology limits the capacity for constructing such a high underground wall. Therefore, a suspended cutoff wall was designed in the river center with the bottom end located at an elevation of 1200 m within the fglQ3 layer. The cutoff wall was connected to the clay core by a grouting gallery. The maximum height of the wall is 110 m, and the underlying unsealed overburden has a thickness of 40–50 m. Two rows of grouting pipes (ϕ 114 mm) were preset in the cutoff wall for grouting the bedrock, and two additional rows outside the wall for grouting the unsealed overburden. Both curtains extend into the bedrock, that is, the rock curtain reaches the level where q < 5 Lu., and the overburden curtains penetrate the rock for at least 2 m.\n\n3.2.1. The Yele ACRD\n\nWhen high-quality clayey soils are difficult to obtain to construct an ECRD, an ACRD is an appropriate alternative. Asphalt is a highly plastic and impermeable material and has a good adaptability to uneven deformation. The Yele ACRD sits on a thick overburden as shown in Figure 4, with an extremely thick overburden at the right abutment. There are five main layers under the dam, as divided by the solid curves in Figure 4. The first (Q21 & Q22), third (Q32−1), fourth layers (Q32−2) are mainly composed of weakly cemented gravel materials, while the second layer (Q31) is composed of a mixture of gravel and hard clay. The relatively high fifth layer (Q32−3) is mainly composed of silty loam. The second layer (Q31) forms a relatively impermeable barrier in the foundation, the permeability coefficient of which is less than 2.2 × 10−5 cm/s and the allowable hydraulic gradient reaches 10.4. These features were fully used in designing the foundation impervious facility.\n\nThe seepage control measures for this dam are divided, from the left bank to the right, into a number of different segments as described below. Curtain grouting was conducted within the gallery in the left river bank (0−150.00–0 + 007.275) to an elevation of 2574.5 m, with a maximum depth of 80 m. From 0 + 007.275 to 0 + 150.00, a concrete cutoff wall (1.0 m) was built into the bedrock for 1.0–2.0 m and curtain grouting was conducted into the weakly weathered rock. The maximum height of the cutoff wall in this segment is 53 m. The third segment starts from 0 + 150.00 until 0 + 308.00, and has a suspended cutoff wall (1.2 m), with its bottom end penetrating the second layer (Q31) for at least 5 m. The height of the cutoff wall in this section ranges from 25 m to 74 m, and curtain grouting was not conducted. From 0 + 308.00 to 0 + 414.00, two layers of concrete cutoff wall were constructed separately. The lower cutoff wall (1.0 m) was cast within the gallery, while the upper wall was constructed from the slope surface. Curtain grouting was conducted into the second layer (Q31) for at least 5 m. The fourth segment (0 + 414.00–0 + 610.00) uses a similar combination of two layers of cutoff wall (1.0 m) and a curtain grouting. The lower cutoff wall was cast to an elevation of 2500 m in the gallery, beneath which a curtain grouting embedding the second layer for at least 5 m was used to cut off the seepage water. The maximum depth of the curtain grouting in this fifth segment is about 120 m. Reinforced concrete was used for the top of the cutoff wall at an elevation of 2639.50–2654.50.0 m.\n\n3.2.2. The Xiabandi ACRD\n\nThe Xiabandi ACRD was constructed mainly with gravel materials collected from the riverbed. The thickness of the foundation overburden reaches 148 m, which is almost twice the dam height (78 m). The distribution of the deposited layers is shown in Figure 5, where three main influential layers can be seen. The lowest layer (fglQ31) mainly contains glacial gravel particles 2–8 cm in diameter. The thickest layer (glQ3) mainly consists of coarser grains such as boulders and rubble, and it has local bridged structures distributed widely throughout and has a very complicated lithology. Enclosed within the glQ3 layer is an almond thick sand lens (fglQ32) which mainly consists of medium and fine sand, silty loam and silty sand. No high-quality clayey soils are found within 60 km of the dam site, and cement, steel and other necessary construction materials would also have to be imported from places even far away (320 km). The transportation condition to the dam site is rather severe at the time of designing. Traffic interruption is often caused by heavy snows in winter while in summer the flood originated from melting ice and snow often results in debris flow accidents. Because of these natural conditions, using too much steel and cement should be avoided. The dam site, on the other hand, is rich in good aggregate for asphalt concrete. Therefore, an asphalt core is used as the impervious system of the dam.\n\nA concrete cutoff wall was constructed, with the bottom inserted into the bedrock within shallow bank slopes. At the deepest locations in the center of canyon, concrete was poured from an elevation of 2803 m to an elevation of 2888 m at an ascending speed of 2.0–7.5 m/h, forming an 85-m high-suspended concrete cutoff wall (1.0 m). Four rows of curtain grouting were constructed to extend the impermeable system into the bedrock, including a row of curtain grouting upstream of the cutoff wall and two rows downstream. The middle curtain grouting was performed through the pipes preset in the cutoff wall. The main (inner) curtain grouting penetrates the bedrock for 10 m, and the outer three rows for at least 5 m. The permeability restriction on the curtain grouting is q < 5 Lu or k < 10−4 cm/s.\n\n3.3.1. The Aertash CFRD\n\nThe Aertash CFRD, currently under construction, is the highest dam of its type filled upon thick overburden layers. The alluvial foundation materials can be broadly divided into two layers. The upper layer (alQ4) mainly consists of gravel materials inlayed by boulders, the thickness of which ranges from 4.7 to 17.0 m. The lower layer (alQ2) is constituted mainly by weakly cemented gravel materials. The total thickness of the overburden layers reaches 94 m, as shown in Figure 6. The basic properties of both layers are given in Table 3. In general, both gravel layers are in medium dense states and have relatively high strength and deformation moduli. The permeability, however, is also very high and the discontinuous grading makes them vulnerable to seepage failure.\n\nLayerDensityModulus and bearing capacityShear strengthPermeabilityDrρd (g/cm3)E0 (MPa)R (MPa)ϕ (°)c (MPa)k (cm/s)JcalQ40.80–0.852.23–2.2340–500.60–0.7037.0–38.000.290.10–0.15alQ20.83–0.852.18–2.2045–550.65–0.8037.5–38.505.000.12–0.15\n\nReinforced concrete face slabs are used to retain the reservoir water and a deep concrete wall (1.2 m) penetrating the rock foundation is designed to cut off the underground seepage. The thickness (t) of the concrete face is t = 0.4 + 0.0035H, where H is the depth measured from the top of the face slabs. The concrete face slabs are connected to the concrete cutoff wall by a toe plinth and two horizontal linking slabs. The maximum height of the cutoff wall is 90 m, with the top 10 m reinforced by steel rebar. Curtain grouting is conducted under the cutoff wall into the bedrock to a level where q < 5 Lu. The depth of curtain grouting ranges from 17 to 69 m.\n\nFor concrete faced rockfill dams, it is possible to construct the dam first and then continue with the construction of the cutoff wall, or vice versa. Finite element analyses can be used to optimize the construction sequences. In the current case, the concrete cutoff wall is planned to be built after the dam is filled to a certain elevation. The linking slabs will be cast before reservoir impounding. Connecting the top of the concrete cutoff wall to the linking slabs will also be finalized before impounding.\n\n3.3.2. The Chahanwusu CFRD\n\nThe Chahanwusu CFRD is another high dam (110 m) built mainly with gravel materials, as shown in Figure 7. The dam sits on sand and gravel overburden layers with a maximum thickness of about 47 m. Three layers can be observed in Figure 7: the upper sand and gravel layer with an average thickness of 19.2 m; the medium-coarse sand layer with an average thickness of 5.9 m; and the lower sand and gravel layer with an average thickness of 11.2 m. Both of the sand and gravel layers have similar engineering properties. The average relative density is 0.85 and the average coefficient of permeability is 6.68 × 10−2 cm/s. The middle sand layer has an average relative density of 0.92 and a permeability coefficient of 4.27 × 10−2 cm/s. Therefore, all foundation layers are in relatively dense states. The dam is located within a region of high earthquake intensity, with a design horizontal acceleration of 2.31 m/s2. However, liquefaction within the medium-coarse sand layer is considered impossible.\n\nThe dam uses upstream concrete face slabs as the seepage barrier, the thickness of which is determined by t = 0.3 + 0.003H. The toe plinths on the left and right bank slopes sit on bedrock, with both consolidation and curtain grouting performed underneath. The toe plinth built on the riverbed is located directly on the gravel layer, removing only the surficial loose deposits (1–2 m). Dynamic compaction was, however, performed to enhance the relative density and modulus of the materials beneath the toe plinth. A concrete wall (1.2 m) inserting the bedrock was constructed to cut off the foundation seepage. The cutoff wall was also connected by two horizontal linking slabs and the toe plinth to the upstream concrete face slabs, forming a closed impervious system. Curtain grouting was also performed under the cutoff wall into the bedrock until the designed level was achieved."
