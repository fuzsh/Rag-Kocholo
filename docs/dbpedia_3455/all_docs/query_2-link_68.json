        "text": "In China, nature reserves cover 18% of the total territory of the nation. However, there are serious imbalance regarding species covered by the nature reserves and the geographic distribution of nature reserves. In addition, there are a series of management problems regarding the management of natural reserves in China. Problems such as limited funding source, lacking of proper management, serious land tenure conflict between de jure and de facto land tenure, and conflict between conservation and community livelihood etc. have afflicted lots of natural reserves. GEI designed and implemented CCA project to explore a new conservation model in China. CCA is a way to provide compensation to resource owners who forgo the economic value of the nature resource for conservation. It is one of the approaches of conservation easement. The detailed implementation process is to have the resource owners and the third party to sign an agreement to provide funding or resources to the resource owner for them to forgo the right to use local natural resources. In local community, CCA project significantly improved local biodiversity condition, recover local ecosystem, implement community development projects, increased local peopleƒ??s living condition, reduced the pressure of economic development on natural resources, promoted local peopleƒ??s voluntary participation in conservation through community development, promoted corporate social responsibility, launched environment education to enhance local awareness regarding environment protection. // By the end of 2009, the project successfully conserved 7,156 hectares of forest, conserving 3.191 million cubic meters of water and guaranteeing electricity production for the hydropower stations on the Baoxing River. Hunting, medicine collection and illegal logging virtually disappeared. In addition, the agreement guarantees the conservation of around 40,000 hectares in the nature reserveƒ??s periphery, supporting the ecological health of the Baoxing Panda Sanctuary, a World Heritage Site spanning 2,230km2 Pollination by over 500 beehives installed by the project has enriched biodiversity and genetic diversity in the nature reserve, and the 420 biogas digesters prevented 1,263m3 of wood from being logged and reduced 2,262 tons ofCO2 emissions.\n\nHuman Well Being and Livelihood Impact\n\nBiogas program: Through the SCCA project, a total of 420 biogas digesters were constructed, distributed over the Linguan, Muping & Qiaoqi townships, reducing an annual 2 million tons of firewood combustion & 230 tons of CO2 emissions. Rabbit Rearing program: Following the earthquake in 2008, China, GEI performed an investigation on the rabbit breeding project. The local government observed no technical obstacles to scaling up the breeding project, but felt the risk was high in supporting a widely distributed community breeding effort, especially since enthusiasm for rabbit rearing fell following the earthquake. GEI followed the governmentâ€™s recommendation of supporting large, specified breeding facilitiesâ€”currently two facilities of more than 500 rabbits generate a total production value of RMB 200,000 (USD29,200). Honeybee program: The SCCA project offered support to the honeybee breeding in the form of a RMB100,000 (USD14,600) micro-credit loan, among which, the Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve contributed RMB50,000 (USD7,300) & the SCCA project contributed RMB50,000. Around 500 honeybees were purchased for more than 150 households, increasing annual income by an average of RMB1,500 (USD220). By July 30, 2009, the RMB50,000 from the SCCA contribution was paid back. From September 2009, the SCCA honeybee project was extended to 1,000 hives, with production value estimated at 500,000 RMB (USD73,000). Of the total 1,100, 303 are distributed in two breeding bases that are co-reared by 101 families & managed by the LÃ¼yuan Farmers cooperative. // GEI cooperated with central and local government to develop relative policy to support the project. As the local partner of GEIâ€™s CCA project, FengTongZhai Natural Reserve Bureau is responsible for the monitoring of whole process of the project. Mr. Wei Dong, the director of FengTongZhai Natural Reserve, is GEIâ€™s CCA local executive officer. His phone number is 00-86-835-6826492. Mr. Fugui Yang, Local government officer, is responsible for coordination of CCA project. His cell phone number is 00-86-13908166578."
