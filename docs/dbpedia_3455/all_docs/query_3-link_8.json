The alloys, Haynes282 and Inconel740, are face-centered cubic lattices with 864 atoms and eleven elements. These multi-component alloys have very complex electronic structure, bonding and partial-charge distributions depending on the composition and strength of the local bonding environment. We employ the novel concept of total bond order density (TBOD) and its partial components (PBOD) to ascertain the internal cohesion that controls the intricate balance between the propensity of metallic bonding between Ni, Cr and Co, and the strong bonds with C and Al. We find Inconel740 has slightly stronger mechanical properties than Haynes282. Both Inconel740 and Haynes282 show ductile natures based on Poisson’s ratio. Poisson’s ratio shows marginal correlation with the TBOD. Comparison with more conventional high entropy alloys with equal components are discussed.

Computational methods built within the well-established quantum mechanics framework of density functional theory (DFT) play an important role in the search for these advanced materials and the prediction of their properties. The close relationship between the physical properties of carbon and boron nitride has led to particular interest in the B–C–N ternary system, characterized by the small radii of the elements, resulting in short interatomic distances and reduced volumes—the parameters being ‘recipes’ for very high hardness in three-dimensional structures. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief outline of recent developments and problems in predicting novel ultrahard carbon allotropes as well as binary and ternary compounds of the B–C–N system with particular emphasis on the analysis of the models used to evaluate the hardness of the theoretically predicted structures.

Filaments embedded with a high packing density of metallic or ceramic granules are being increasingly used, resulting in almost fully dense parts, whereby geometries are shaped, debinded and sintered sequentially until the completion of the part. Traditionally, “brown” debinded geometries are transported to conventional furnaces to densify the powder compacts, requiring careful tailoring of the heating profiles and sintering environment. This approach is decoupled and often involves time-consuming post-processing, whereby after the completion of the shaping and debinding steps, the parts need to be transported to a sintering furnace. Here, it is shown that sintering via indirect induction heating of a highly filled commercially available filament embedded with stainless steel 316L powder can be an effective route to densify Fused Filament Fabricated (FFF) parts. The results show that densities of 99.8% can be reached with very short soaking times, representing a significant improvement compared to prior methods. A hybrid machine is proposed, whereby a custom-built machine is integrated with an induction heater to combine FFF with local indirect induction sintering. Sintering in situ, without the need for part transportation, simplifies the processing of metal parts produced through material extrusion additive manufacturing.

The experimental results provide insight into the changes in the Charpy impact fracture energy of the V-notched test specimen that occur as a result of temperature changes. The experimental results also provide insight into the mechanical response of the tested materials to mechanical uniaxial high-cycle fatigue at room temperature in an air atmosphere and at different applied stress ratios. Material fatigue tests refer to symmetric (R = −1), asymmetric (R = −0.5) and pulsating tensile (R = 0) cycles. The test results are shown in the S–N diagrams and refer to the highest applied stresses in relation to the number of failures at a given stress ratio. Using the modified staircase method, the fatigue limit (endurance limit) was calculated for both tested materials at each prescribed stress ratio. For both tested steel alloys, and at prescribed stress ratios, the fatigue limit levels (σ_f) are shown as follows: for steel C15E+C (1.1141)→σf[250.8R=−1;345.4R=−0.5;527R=0](MPa); and for steel S235JRC+C (1.0122)→σf[202R=−1;310R=−0.5;462R=0](MPa). All uniaxial fatigue tests were performed on unnotched, smooth, highly-polished specimens. The microhardness of both materials was also tested.

Experimental results show that the elongation at failure decreases with natural aging. There are few studies on the relationship between natural aging and ductility because of the difficult observation of Mg–Si clusters. To solve the difficulty, cracked Al containing Mg–Si clusters of varying sizes are assumed for the MD simulations. A larger Mg–Si cluster in Al results in earlier crack opening and dislocation emission. Moreover, as the Mg–Si cluster size increases, the stress near the crack tip becomes more concentrated. This causes rapid crack propagation, a similar effect to that of crack tip sharpening. As a result of long-term natural aging, the cracks expand rapidly. The influence of geometry is also investigated. Crack lengthening and thickness reduction negatively impact the fracture toughness, with the former having a larger impact than the latter. Although there are several discrepancies in the practical deformation conditions, the simulation results can help to more thoroughly understand natural aging in Al–Si–Mg alloys.

The effects of different raw material ratios on the composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the prepared composite ceramics were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM. The results show that ZrB2 and TiB2 were grown on the surface of B4C by template mechanism to form a dense nanocrystalline coating, and the original surface of B4C was exposed gradually with the decrease of the ratio of metal powder. When the composite powders were sintered at 1700 °C, ZrB2 and TiB2 formed a solid solution, which can refine grains and improve strength. When the raw material ratio is n(B4C): n(Zr): n(Ti) = 12:1:1, the composite ceramics have excellent comprehensive properties, the Vickers hardness reaches 41.2 GPa.

One element of the considered friction pair is made of a functionally gradient material (FGM), and the other of a homogeneous material. To determine the temperature on the friction surfaces of both elements, the previously obtained, exact solution of the boundary value problem of heat conduction was adopted, with account of the heat generation due to the friction. A calculation scheme was proposed that takes into consideration thermal sensitivity of materials and variations of the friction coefficient under the influence of temperature. Calculations were performed for two-component FGM (ZrO2–Ti-6Al-4V) in combination with gray cast iron (ChNMKh). It was found that for selected friction pair materials, consideration of their thermal sensitivity reduces the time of braking and the value of temperature achieved on the friction surfaces. At the same time, the whole process was characterized by a good stability of braking with a slight decrease in efficiency in each subsequent cycle.

Using the railway T-beam as a template, prestressed NC-UHPC composite beams with different NC layer heights were built. A static bending test was performed, the pressure of the steel strand and the deflection and strain of the beam were measured, and the evolution of cracks in each beam was observed. The calculation formulas of the normal section strength and cracking bending moment of NC-UHPC composite beam were verified by the test. The results showed that the type of strain was similar to load-deflection curves with increasing load; the bending failure process of the NC-UHPC composite beam showed four obvious stages: elasticity, uniform cracking, crack development, and yield. Cracks in the beam started to appear at stage II, developed rapidly at stage III, and stopped emerging at stage IV. The calculation formulas for the normal section strength and the cracking bending moment of the NC-UHPC composite beam were in good agreement with the test values. Normal concrete with a compressive strength of 80 MPa can replace UHPC for the design of NC-UHPC composite beams.

The microstructure of the cross-section of the fabricated coatings was characterized by SEM and EDX. The bonding strength between the coatings and substrates was measured and analyzed. The effects of the Fe/Al ratios and substrate hardness on the deposition behavior were investigated. It was interesting to find fragmented zones in all fabricated coatings, which were composed of large integrated Al particles and small fragmented Al particles. Meanwhile, the fraction of fragmented zones varied with the fraction of the actual Fe/Al ratio. An Fe/Al ratio of 50/50 appeared to be an optimized ratio for the higher bonding strength of coatings. The in situ hammer effect caused by larger and harder Fe particles played an important role in the cold spray process. The substrate with the higher hardness strengthened the in situ hammer effect and further improved the bonding strength.

The subject of the study were cultures of “naive” T-helpers (CD4+) isolated by immunomagnetic separation and polarized into the Th17 phenotype with a TCR activator and cytokines. It was found that P-GO at low concentrations (5 µg/mL) had no effect on the parameters studied. The presence of high concentrations of P-GO in T-helper cultures (25 μg/mL) did not affect the number and viability of these cells. However, the percentage of proliferating T-helpers in these cultures was reduced. GO nanoparticles modified with linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) significantly increased the percentage of Th17/22 cells in cultures of Th17-polarized T helpers and the production of IFN-γ, whereas those modified with branched PEG suppressed the synthesis of IL-17. Thus, a low concentration of PEGylated GO nanoparticles (5 μg/mL), in contrast to a concentration of 25 μg/mL, has no effect on the Th17-polarization of T helpers, allowing their further use for in-depth studies of the functions of T lymphocytes and other immune cells. Overall, we have studied for the first time the direct effect of P-GO nanoparticles on the conversion of T helper cells to the Th17 phenotype.

Local corrosion behavior of the CGHAZ of a Zr–Ti–Al–RE deoxidized steel was investigated in this work using theoretical calculations and experimental verification. The modified inclusions have a (Zr–Mg–Al–Ca–RE)Ox core claded by a CaS and TiN shell. CaS dissolves first, followed by the oxide core, leaving TiN parts. This confirms that the addition of rare earth can reduce lattice distortion and prevent a galvanic couple between the inclusions and the matrix, while the chemical dissolution of CaS causes localized acidification, resulting in the pitting corrosion initiation.

Some of the most promising icephobic surfaces are those with hydrophobic properties. However, the relationship between hydrophobicity and low ice adhesion is not yet clearly defined. In this work, chemical modification of an epoxy gelcoat with chemical modifiers from the group of double organofunctionalized polysiloxanes (generally called multifunctionalized organosilicon compounds (MFSCs)) was applied. The anti-icing properties of manufactured coatings were determined by means of measurements of shear strength between the ice layer and the modified surface, conducted using a tensile machine. In the work, tests were also performed on the roughness, wettability, and durability of the properties in an aging chamber. It was found that the performed modifications of the coating’s chemical composition by the addition of polysiloxanes enabled us to reduce ice adhesion by 51% and to increase the water contact angle by 14% in comparison to the neat gelcoat. A reduction in ice adhesion was also observed with the increasing water contact angle and with decreasing surface roughness. In addition, only one modification recorded an increase in ice adhesion after exposure in the aging chamber.

Sulphate bearing soils constituted by mixing kaolin and gypsum at 0%, 15%, 25%, and 35% gypsum contents were treated with 12% ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and 4%Lime (L) and 8% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and subjected to compaction, swell, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), California bearing ratio (CBR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX) analyses. The results of the study showed that the use of L-GGBS improved the soaked CBRs of the treated samples by over 43% when compared to OPC-treated samples after 7-days curing. A reduction in water absorption by 82% was also observed with L-GGBS treatment after 28-days curing. The UCS results also showed better performance with L-GGBS treatment exceeding 856% at 28 days. The effect of increased cementitious product with increasing gypsum content was negated by simultaneous and rapid growth of ettringite minerals which reduced the strength and increased swelling of OPC treated samples up to 18.92%, exceeding allowable limits of 2.5% as specified in Highway Agency Advice Note HA 74/07. The L-GGBS treated gypseous soil samples meet the strength requirement for stabilised sub-base (CS) and stabilised road-bases (CB1 and CB2) as described in TRL ORN31. Hence, the use of L-GGBS combination was found to be effective in ameliorating sulphate-induced expansion and therefore encouraged in the stabilisation of subgrade and road-base materials with high sulphate contents.

It presents great potential in the repair field of aluminum alloys. In this study, the effect of stir bar diameter, rotation speed, and welding speed on the weld formation was investigated in the VFSW of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. The weld macrostructure, penetration, and mechanical properties were characterized. The results show that a large diameter of the stir bar can enhance the vortex material flow, increase the heat input, and eliminate the incomplete-penetration defect. The increase in rotation speed within limits can enhance the weld penetration and the mechanical properties of the weld nugget zone (WNZ). However, too high a rotation speed reduces the weld penetration and weakens the mechanical properties of the WNZ. The increase in welding speed reduces the weld penetration but enhances the mechanical properties of the heat affected zone. The incomplete-penetration defect significantly weakens the ductility of the VFSW joint. It can be eliminated by enlarging the stir bar diameter and choosing a moderate rotation speed and a lower welding speed.

Its historical use has been linked to ornamental elements, although more recent research is oriented towards the industrialisation of plaster composites and the design of prefabricated parts for false ceilings and interior partitions. In this work, the behaviour against water of four new plaster-based composite materials is studied, using additions of two types of super absorbent polymers (sodium polyacrylate and potassium polyacrylate) and a lightening material (vermiculite) in their manufacturing process. In addition, the transmission of water vapour through the samples was studied together with the water absorption capacity of the samples in order to check the suitability of the use of plaster-based materials exposed to these environments. The results of this study show that composites with the addition of super absorbent polymers as well as vermiculite significantly improve their water performance compared to traditional materials up to 7.3% water absorption with a minimal (13%) reduction in mechanical strength compared to current materials with similar additions. In this sense, a plaster material is obtained with wide possibilities of application in the construction sector that favours the development of sustainable and quality buildings, in line with Goal 9 for Sustainable Development included in the 2030 Agenda.

The presence of competition effects between luminescence pathways leads to the complex nature of luminescence signals, and therefore, it is necessary to investigate and validate the various methods of signal analysis by using simulations. The present study shows that in simulations of luminescence signals originating from multilevel phenomenological models, it is not possible to extract mathematically the individual information for each peak in the signal. It is further shown that computerized curve deconvolution analysis is the only reliable tool for extracting the various kinetic parameters. Simulation studies aim to explain experimental results, and therefore, it is necessary to validate simulation results by comparing with experiments. In this paper, testing of simulation results is performed using two methods. In the first method, the influence of competition effects is tested by comparing the input model parameters with the output values from the deconvolution analysis. In the second method, the agreement with experimental results is tested using the properties of well-known glow peaks with very high repeatability among TL laboratories, such as the 110 °C glow peak of quartz.

Such modifications make it possible to solve not only technical and economic problems, but also environmental problems. This article describes the use of basalt powder waste in sand-lime products (silicates). The aim of the study was to manage basalt powder waste and to investigate the changes it causes in sand-lime products. The article describes the planning of the experiment, which directly determines the number of samples and their composition, which was necessary to conducting a full analysis and correctly illustrating the relationships occurring in the samples. Basic tests were carried out: compressive strength, density and water absorption, as well as optical tests and scanning microscopy. Based on the research conducted, it was concluded that the use of basalt powder as a component of sand-lime products has positive effects. Studies show that the best results are achieved with a proportion of powder in the raw material mass of about 10%—the compressive strength reaches almost 30 MPa, which is almost twice that of traditional silicate.

The ultimate compressive strength was obtained by conducting compression testing of three groups of CASC with different water–cement ratios. Steady loads of 0%, 10%, and 20% of their respective ultimate compressive strengths were applied to the concrete specimens with different water–cement ratios. After being subjected to a seawater erosion test for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days, the chloride ion concentration at different depths was measured to determine the chloride ion diffusion coefficient. Meanwhile, the chloride ion diffusion coefficients of CASC were verified by comparing them with results obtained from numerical simulations performed using COMSOL software. The test results show that the internal pore space of CASC expands, leading to acceleration of the chloride ion transport rate when applied loads are increased. The initial chloride ion concentration of CASC rises as the water–cement ratio rises, and the concentration gradient formed with artificial seawater lowers, decreasing the chloride ion transport rate. When the water cement ratio decreases and the load increases, the diffusion coefficient increases. Using the numerical simulation method of COMSOL software, it was proved that the model has good applicability and accuracy in predicting chloride ion transport in CASC.

It was found that the introduction of Au between TiO2 and the BDD, not only could reduce their contact resistance, to increase the carrier transport efficiency, but also could improve the surface Hall mobility of the BDD electrode. Meanwhile, the designed Z-scheme structure provided a fast channel for the electrons and holes combination, to promote the effective separation of the electrons and holes produced in TiO2 and the BDD under photoirradiation. The electrochemical characterization elucidated that these modifications of the structure obviously enhanced the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode, which was further verified by the simulated wastewater degradation experiments with reactive brilliant red X-3B. In addition, it was also found that the photoirradiation effectively enhanced the pollution degradation efficiency of the modified electrode, especially for the TiO2/Au/BDD-30 electrode.

However, its limitation is the formation of unfavorable gaseous by-products, such as hydrazine (N2H4) and ammonia (NH3), which are poisons to fuel cell catalyst, upon pyrolysis. Previous studies proved that confinement of ammonia borane (AB) greatly improved the dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics. They function by reducing the particle size of AB and establishing bonds between silica functional groups and AB molecules. In current study, we employed the same strategy using MCM-41 and silica aerogel to investigate the effect of nanosizing towards the hydrogen storage properties of HB. Different loading of HB to the porous supports were investigated and optimized. The optimized loading of HB in MCM-41 and silica aerogel was 1:1 and 0.25:1, respectively. Both confined samples demonstrated great suppression of melting induced sample foaming. However, by-products formation was enhanced over dehydrogenation in an open system decomposition owing to the presence of extensive Si-O···BH3(HB) coordination that further promote the B-N bond cleavage to release N2H4. The Si-OH···N(N2H4) hydrogen bonding may further promote N-N bond cleavage in the resulting N2H4, facilitating the formation of NH3. As temperature increases, the remaining N-N-B oligomeric chains in the porous silica, which are lacking the long-range structure may further undergo intramolecular B-N or N-N cleavage to release substantial amount of N2H4 or NH3. Besides open system decomposition, we also reported a closed system decomposition where complete utilization of the N-H from the released N2H4 and NH3 in the secondary reaction can be achieved, releasing mainly hydrogen upon being heated up to high temperatures. Nanosizing of HB particles via PMMA encapsulation was also attempted. Despite the ester functional group that may favor multiple coordination with HB molecules, these interactions did not impart significant change towards the decomposition of HB selectively towards dehydrogenation.

The LDPE addition significantly decreased the steady-state shear viscosity, especially in the high shear rate region. The decrease did not originate from slippage on the die wall but due to interfacial slippage between the PC and dispersed LDPE droplets that deformed to the flow direction to a great extent. As a result of the viscosity decrease, injection pressure largely decreased from 150 to 110 MPa with the addition only 5 wt.% of LDPE. The enhanced flowability also reduced the warpage of the molded product significantly, demonstrating that the processability at injection molding was improved by the addition of LDPE.

The phase, specific surface area, morphology, ionic states, and redox properties of the obtained nanocatalyst were systematically characterized using XRD, BET, TEM, EDS, XPS, H2-TPR, and O2-TPO techniques. The results showed that the catalyst had a good crystal structure and spherelike morphology with the aggregation of uniform small grain size. The catalyst showed the presence of more adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface. XPS and H2-TPR have confirmed the reduction of Ce4+ species to Ce3+ species. O2-TPR proved the reoxidability of CeOx, playing a key role during DMF oxidation. The catalyst had a reaction rate of 1.44 mol g−1cat s−1 and apparent activation energy of 33.30 ± 3 kJ mol−1. The catalytic performance showed ~82 ± 2% DMF oxidation at 400 °C. This work’s overall results demonstrated that reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+ and increasing the amount of adsorbed oxygen provided more suitable active sites for DMF oxidation. Additionally, the catalyst was thermally stable (~86%) after 100 h time-on-stream DMF conversion, which could be a potential catalyst for industrial applications.

The method aims to reduce the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds by using short welding times and a different chemical composition of the insert element. In the experiment, deep-drawing low-carbon steel, HSLA zinc-coated steel and precipitation-hardened aluminum alloy 6082 T6 were used. Two types of adhesives—one based on rubber and the other based on epoxy resin—were used for adhesive bonding, while the surfaces of the materials joined were treated with a unique adhesion-improving agent based on organosilanes. The surface treatment improved the chemical bonding between the substrate and adhesive. It was proved, that the use of an insert element in combination with adhesive bonding is only relevant for those adhesives that have a load capacity just below the yield strength of the substrates. For bonded joints with higher load capacities, plastic deformation of the substrates occurs, which is unacceptable, and thus, the overall contribution of the insert element to the load capacity of the joint becomes negligible. The results also show that the combination of the resistance spot welding of the insert element and adhesive bonding facilitates the joining process of galvanized and nongalvanized steels with aluminum alloys and suppresses the effect of brittle intermetallic phases by minimizing the joining area and welding time. It is possible to use the synergistic effect of insert element welding and adhesive bonding to achieve increased energy absorption of the joint under stress.

Modeling the fracture process zone (FPZ) is essential to understanding the cracking behavior of heterogeneous, quasi-brittle materials such as concrete under monotonic and cyclic actions. The paper aims to present a numerical modeling approach for simulating crack growth using a scaled boundary finite element model (SBFEM). The cohesive traction law is explored to model the stress field under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. In doing so, a new constitutive law is applied within the cohesive response. The cyclic damage accumulation during loading and unloading is formulated within the thermodynamic framework of the constitutive concrete model. We consider two common problems of three-point bending of a single-edge-notched concrete beam subjected to different loading conditions to validate the developed method. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental test measurements from the literature. The presented analysis can provide a further understanding of crack growth and damage accumulation within the cohesive response, and the SBFEM makes it possible to identify the fracture behavior of cyclic crack propagation in concrete members.

These hydrogels can be modified by grafting dendrimer-linked functionalized molecules (dendrigrafts). Our aim was to develop a tunable poly(L-lysine) dendrigrafts (DGL)/PEG-based hydrogel with an inverse porosity and to investigate its osteogenic potential. DGL/PEG hydrogels were emulsified in a surfactant-containing oil solution to form microspheres. The toxicity was evaluated on Human Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) with Live/Dead and MTT assays. The effects on HUVECs were investigated through C5 Complement expression by RT-PCR and C5a/TGF-β1 secretion by ELISA. Recruitment of hMSCs was investigated using Boyden chambers and their osteogenic differentiation was studied by measuring Alkaline Phosphatase activity (ALP) and BMP-2 secretion by ELISA. Adjusting the stirring speed during the emulsification allowed to obtain spherical microspheres with tunable diameters (10–1600 µm). The cell viability rate with the hydrogel was 95 and 100% with HUVECs and hMSCs, respectively. Incubating HUVECs with the biomaterial induced a 5-fold increase in TGF-β1 and a 3-fold increase in Complement C5a release. Furthermore, HUVEC supernatants obtained after incubation with the hydrogel induced a 2.5-fold increase in hMSC recruitment. The hydrogel induced a 3-fold increase both in hMSC ALP activity and BMP-2 secretion. Overall, the functionalized hydrogel enhanced the osteogenic potential by interacting with endothelial cells and hMSCs and represents a promising tool for bone tissue engineering.

Thermal decomposition duration of the precursors played a determinant role in the final morphology of the synthesized boron carbide powders. The morphology of boron carbide powders successfully tuned from polyhedral-equiaxed (with ~3 µm average particle size) to nano/micro fibers by adjusting the thermal decomposition duration of precursors. The length and thickness of fibers were in the range of 30 to 200 µm and sub-micron to 5 µm, respectively. The electrochemical performance analysis of boron carbide powders has shown that the particle morphology has a considerable impact on the boron carbide electrodes electrochemical performance. It was found that the synergetic effects of polyhedral-equiaxed and nano/micro fiber morphologies exhibited the best electrochemical performance in supercapacitor devices, resulting in the power and energy density of 34.9 W/kg and 0.016 Wh/kg, respectively.

It is an integrated system of the control module, activation module, and data acquisition system, in which an integrated control software for controlling each module was developed. The control module includes the mechanical, control, and ultrasonic parts. The activation module was composed of the pulser/receiver, and the data acquisition system included an A/D board. In addition, the integrated control software performs system operation and material measurement and includes an analysis program to analyze the obtained A-Scan signals in various ways. A through-silicon via (TSV) device, which is a semiconductor structure, was prepared to verify the performance of the developed system. The TSV device was analyzed using an ultra-high-resolution acoustic microscope. When the C-Scan images were analyzed, void defects with a size of 20 μm were detected at a depth of approximately 32.5 μm. A similar result could be confirmed when the cross section was measured using focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy.

There is a high demand for the evaluation of the possible degradation of new composites, especially based on natural raw materials. The results of experimental research that evaluated the impact of radiation technology on biodegradable and compostable packaging materials up to 40 kGy have been presented. Two commercially available flexible composite films based on aliphatic–aromatic copolyesters (AA) were selected for the study, including one film with chitosan and starch (AA-CH-S) and the other with thermoplastic starch (AA-S). The materials were subjected to the influence of ionizing radiation from 10 to 40 kGy and then tests were carried out to check their usability as packaging material for the food industry. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AA-S films improved due to the radiation-induced cross-linking processes, while in the case of AA-CH-S films, a considerable decrease in the elongation at break was observed. The results also showed a decrease in the WVTR in the case of AA-S and no changes in barrier properties in the case of AA-CH-S. Both materials revealed no changes in the odor analyzed by sensory analysis. In the case of the AA-S films, the higher the radiation dose, the faster the biodegradation rate. In the case of the AA-CH-S film, the radiation did not affect biodegradation. The performed research enables the evaluation of the materials intended for direct contact with food. AA-CH-S was associated with unsatisfactory parameters (exceeding the overall migration limit and revealing color change during storage) while AA-S showed compliance at the level of tests carried out. The study showed that the AA-CH-S composite did not show a synergistic effect due to the presence of chitosan.
