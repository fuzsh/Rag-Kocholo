The time-dependent behaviour of high rockfill dams is complex and not easy to accurately predict. Many discrepancies were revealed by the comparison of the observed deformation histories of different dams, and the deformation of some high rockfill dams did not correspond to the general deformation law. Field monitoring is therefore an effective method for understanding complex dam deformation behaviour. In this paper, actual measured deformation data resulting from continuous monitoring of the Maoergai and Qiaoqi dams are analysed. These two dams have similar heights, crest lengths, and alluvium overburden thicknesses. Our aim is to explain the actual deformation histories on the basis of the mechanical behaviours of these dams in order to warn engineers about potential problems that cannot be predicted. The results indicate that the deformation patterns of the two dams are completely different. The dam construction and water impoundment schedule is the major reason for the different horizontal displacement patterns. The reservoir filling rates and rainfall are the main reasons for the different settlement patterns. The case histories are useful for understanding the wide range of possible postconstruction deformation in a dam.
