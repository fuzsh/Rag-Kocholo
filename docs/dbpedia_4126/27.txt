“They’ve dominated on set, on screen and on social. They tweet, post, hashtag, selfie and keep it real! Now it’s time to give them the props they deserve!” reads the description of the award, which fans can vote on now through the conclusion of the Daytime Emmy Awards telecast on Sunday, June 22 via the official Facebook page of the Daytime Emmy Awards.
