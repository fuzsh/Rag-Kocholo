        "text": "Mayim Bialik first came to the public's attention as a child, appearing in a series of television shows and movies. In 1990, she was cast in the lead role of the sitcom \"Blossom,\" appearing in 114 episodes over the course of five seasons. After returning to mainstream television permanently in 2010, she was able to land the role of Amy Farrah Fowler in \"The Big Bang Theory,\" starring as Sheldon Cooper's (Jim Parsons) love interest. She has since worked on various film and television projects.\n\nLike many child stars, life has not been entirely easy or straightforward for Bialik. However, most of the trauma and tragedy that she has suffered didn't happen in her early years as an actor but during adulthood. Whether it's controversies stirred up by her public remarks or disasters that led to devastating consequences, Bialik has had more than her fair share of sad events and hardships during her life. Read on for her tragic true story.\n\nMayim Bialik is recognized around the world for playing the quirky and slightly weird character Amy Farrah Fowler on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" but before that, she was best known for playing the titular character in the NBC sitcom \"Blossom.\" Both characters reflect elements of Bialik's own personality — whether that's Blossom's introspective nature or Amy's passion for neuroscience. But Blossom, who is just as quirky as Amy, is a marker of the kind of characters Bialik would come to play throughout her career. \"That's what I'm usually cast as,\" she explained while talking to her former co-star Jenna von Oÿ on her podcast \"Mayim Bialik's Breakdown.\" \"I'm the quirky friend. I'm the weird one.\"\n\nWhile this led to a successful career for Bialik, being typecast like this has meant that certain doors were not always open for her, especially at the start of her career. The fact that she didn't conform to the beauty standards of the time only made things more difficult. \"I had little luck landing 'leading' roles but was cast as the quirky friend or nemesis in a lot of sitcoms I appeared in, such as 'Webster' and 'The Facts of Life.' I'm sure there are many reasons I didn't land a leading role besides my profile, but the truth is that girls with prominent noses were not cast in leading roles in the 1980s,\" Bialik revealed in an essay for Variety. \"We also didn't get cast in commercials, since what they wanted in commercials was 'All-American' kids. I didn't capture that vision.\"\n\nBeing typecast as the quirky friend or nemesis meant that Mayim Bialik was pushed toward some roles and not others, which led to a certain amount of rejection. She was only 11 when she started acting professionally, and she quickly learned that you're not going to get every part you audition for, no matter how much you want it. Rejection is just a part of the job when you're an actor, but it was a hard lesson for Bialik to learn.\n\nSpeaking on her podcast \"Mayim Bialik's Breakdown,\" the actor revealed that she really struggled with being turned down at the time. \"I was not an emotionally resilient child when it came to rejection,\" she said. \"I have friends who are like, 'If I get it, I get it, if I don't, f*** 'em all,' you know, and I was never like that.\" She added: \"To be a child and be told, 'No, you're not cute enough,' or 'Someone else is better,' that doesn't feel good.\"\n\nMayim Bialik was raised in New York by her Jewish parents and took an active role in her religion. While she was initially part of the Reform Jew movement, the actor now considers herself to be Modern Orthodox Jewish. It is this strong connection to her religion that meant that when her father died in 2015, she spent an entire year grieving him. \"There's a year of grieving in traditional Judaism,\" Bialik told Yahoo Entertainment. \"After that year, it's kind of like a veil lifts.\"\n\nThe grief didn't mean that she entirely stopped working or doing other things, but it did dominate her thinking during that time — especially because her father had been ill with a degenerative disease for some time. \"Death is not difficult, but dying is,\" she later said. \"There is nothing harder than nursing your parent as they die.\" Taking inspiration from these real-life events, Bialik created the film \"As They Made Us,\" which starred Dustin Hoffman, Simon Helberg, and Dianna Agron. The film isn't completely true to real life events, but it \"has the scaffold of things that happened or were evoked,\" she explained.\n\nMayim Bialik is proud of her time on the '90s sitcom \"Blossom,\" which still has a lot of fans to this day. She especially loved having the opportunity to portray an authentic version of teenage life and friendship alongside Jenna von Oÿ — she felt this made the show stand out compared to the glossy, perfect shows that were on at the time, such as \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" What's more, Bialik felt comfortable in her own skin and was fortunate that her role as Blossom didn't dictate she make changes to her body or go on a diet. However, there were some people who clearly didn't feel like she was suitable for a lead character in a TV show, and Bialik ended up on the receiving end of some cruel criticism and bullying.\n\nIn her Variety essay, Bialik revealed that a critic attacked her appearance in a harsh review. She wrote: \"When Blossom premiered, I was 14 years old. An early review of this show in a prominent publication described the lack of 'sense' that my face made to him; the shape of my face confused this critic. He said that my features did not seem to match one another. I was essentially being described as a Frankenstein of a teenager. At the time, I'm not going to tell you it didn't hurt. Of course it did.\" Bialik admitted to Glamour that such criticism made her strongly consider changing her appearance. \"I always thought about getting a nose job,\" she revealed.\n\nWhen an actor is on a popular show for several years, there's an assumption that they're set for life. And in some cases, this is true. The cast of \"The Big Bang Theory\" made a lot of money while starring on the sitcom, Bialik included. She was earning $450,000 per episode by the time the show wrapped. However, she has admitted that starring in \"Blossom\" was a completely different financial experience.\n\nWhile discussing her time on the '90s sitcom with Jenna von Oÿ on an episode of her podcast, Bialik said her earnings from the show in no way set her up for life. She also revealed that, while she was the show's lead, she was earning significantly less than her male counterparts at the time. \"While we were respected as women, I think the fact that I was a girl had a totally different standard in negotiations,\" Bialik explained. \"Male lead actors definitely were paid differently.\"\n\nAdditionally, Bialik said there was never a conversation about cast members getting points or equity in the show, which meant she wasn't given a piece of the pie the way actors are today. This meant that when Bialik's time on \"Blossom\" ended, she had to continue working, taking on various jobs, including tutoring. \"When I went to college, I was not an independently wealthy, I-never-have-to-work-again person. I did have to work again,\" she said. \"I did all the things that people do to make ends meet.\"\n\nMayim Bialik married businessman Mike Stone in 2003. The pair met while studying at UCLA, with Mike even converting to Judaism so that they could marry. They were wed in Pasadena with a Jewish ceremony and a Victorian theme, where the actor wore a vintage wedding dress. Over the course of the next decade, Stone and Bialik had two sons, although the relationship eventually broke down. After nine years of marriage, Bialik revealed that the pair had decided to divorce.\n\nAcknowledging that divorce is \"terribly sad, painful and incomprehensible\" for children in a statement (via USA Today), Bialik announced that the priority for the former couple was their two sons. With that in mind, the two have remained on somewhat friendly terms. In 2018, while going through another painful breakup, Bialik outlined how she and Stone had spent Thanksgiving together for the sake of the children. This was despite the situation being awkward as Stone was living with his new girlfriend at the time. Bialik wrote on her Grok Nation site that it was \"our first time doing this kind of meal together and I would be lying if I didn't say I was nervous.\"\n\nOne specific moment from her time on \"The Big Bang Theory\" stands out for Mayim Bialik as particularly painful to film. Although Sheldon and Bialik's character Amy became one of television's most popular couples, the pair were certainly unconventional, and it was unclear whether they would actually ever get married. That's exactly what happened at the end of Season 11 when the two tied the knot after years of \"will they or won't they\" storylines.\n\nWeddings are supposed to be a celebration of love and a happy occasion. What fans saw on screen reflected that, yet things were not so thrilling behind the scenes. In a blog post on Grok Nation, the actor explained that posing as a joyful bride was difficult because she had recently separated from her husband. She said, \"As a divorced woman, it's hard to revisit that moment and those decisions.\"\n\nBut it wasn't only her own romantic history that made shooting the wedding scene difficult. Bialik also revealed that she suffered from several infections around the same time that forced her to take a step back from physical activity and work. These illnesses, which required antibiotics to treat, ultimately led to her feeling unattractive, saying: \"Even though everyone said I looked beautiful, I didn't feel completely beautiful.\"\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" was undoubtedly a great experience for Mayim Bialik. It not only made her a household name around the country, turning her into a valuable and desirable television star, but it also made her a lot of money. However, that doesn't mean her time on the series was always positive. In her own podcast, \"Mayim Bialik's Breakdown,\" the actor spoke about her difficulty dealing with anxiety while filming \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\n\nSpeaking to co-star Kevin Sussman, Bialik said, \"With acting stuff, my level of anxiety surrounding performing is very, very high. It's a high level of anxiety.\" Despite taking precautions and undergoing treatments such as therapy, the anxiety that she suffered during shoots was debilitating and often stopped her from being able to perform. \"I've had this a handful of times when working on 'Big Bang Theory' when there was a certain way they wanted a line delivered, and I was like, 'Oh okay, I got that. I'll do that in the next take,'\" she continued. \"And I do it, but it's still not right. And sometimes it's like the audience isn't laughing, you know it's not funny.\"\n\n2012 was an important year for Mayim Bialik. She began to receive widespread recognition for her portrayal of Amy Farrah Fowler on \"The Big Bang Theory\" and was even nominated for an Emmy award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. However, it was also a tough year in her personal life, with the actor being involved in a serious car accident that left her with a severely injured hand.\n\nThe incident itself was significant enough to require attendance by paramedics and firefighters, with Bialik telling Vanity Fair that it was a \"devastating, tragic accident, which could have ended up much worse.\" Her maimed hand didn't stop her from getting straight back to work, though, and she returned to the set of \"The Big Bang Theory\" as soon as she was allowed to by medical staff. \"It's a testament to how much I love my job,\" Bialik said in the same interview. \"Because I went right back to work. Jim Parsons and Melissa Rauch are my buddies, and I wanted to be with my buddies.\"\n\nFollowing her successful stint on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" Mayim Bialik had a starring role in the Fox sitcom \"Call Me Kat.\" Based on a British comedy known as \"Miranda,\" it tells the story of a 39-year-old woman who quits teaching to open up a cat café as she tries to find happiness. Among the rest of the cast were Swoosie Kurtz as Kat's mother, Sheila, Kyla Pratt as waitress Randi, and head chef Phil, played by Leslie Jordan.\n\nJordan, a celebrated comedian and actor, died on October 24, 2022. According to reports, he was on his way to the set of the show for filming when his car collided with a building in Hollywood due to a medical episode that was later described as a \"sudden cardiac dysfunction.\" Jordan was 67 years old at the time of his death, which shocked his fans and co-stars.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Jennifer Hudson Show,\" Bialik confirmed that the cast and crew of \"Call Me Kat\" found out about his death while on the set. \"It was a sudden thing. We were all at work and waiting for him to show up at work, so it was very, very, very complicated, you know, to have the whole crew there and the whole cast,\" she said. \"We were a family.\"\n\nThe last decade has brought the sexual abuse and exploitation of women in Hollywood into focus, shining a light on a massive problem within the television and movie industries. The issue came to the public's attention more prominently in 2017, when the Harvey Weinstein scandal exposed just how widespread the problem was and led to the #MeToo movement, which spanned the entire globe.\n\nRemarking on the disgraced producer in a 2017 op-ed article for The New York Times, Mayim Bialik confirmed that, despite being disgusted by his actions, she wasn't shocked to discover that a leading Hollywood figure would behave in such a way. Writing about her own experiences, the actor discussed seeing men in authority behave in similar ways and went on to add, \"The fact that he may have abused his position of power does not surprise me in the least.\"\n\nFeeling that she had to protect herself from sexual harassment in the workplace, Bialik detailed some of the ways that she worked to ensure that she would not be subjected to such behavior. \"I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise,\" she said. \"I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don't act flirtatiously with men as a policy.\"\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available. Visit the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network website or contact RAINN's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).\n\nMayim Bialik's op-ed in The New York Times led to a flurry of criticism from feminist groups and others on social media. The main point of contention surrounded her decision to avoid harassment by behaving in a conservative manner or dressing more modestly. \"Having others celebrate your physical beauty is not the way to lead a meaningful life,\" she wrote.\n\nThe actor was clearly aware that the article may have been controversial, as she attempted to mitigate what she was saying by clarifying that she was still blaming men for their behavior. \"In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want,\" she said. \"But our world isn't perfect. Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can't be naïve about the culture we live in.\"\n\nMany people quickly criticized Bialik, pointing out that sexual desire is not the only motive behind this kind of harassment, with predators wanting power and control more than anything else. Others were offended that the actor seemed to be implying that women had some responsibility for the way abusers acted. Just a few days later, Bialik apologized for the hurt she had caused with her op-ed, although only after initially saying that her words had been twisted beyond their intended meaning.\n\nIn 2021, Mayim Bialik opened up for the first time about the fact that she has an eating disorder. Talking to author Glennon Doyle on her podcast \"Mayim Bialik's Breakdown,\" the actor spoke about her experiences with anorexia and binge eating. Inspired to talk about her eating disorders by Doyle, Bialik went into detail about having to cope with overeating and heavily restricting her diet. \"This is the first time I've ever talked about it,\" she said. \"Because people are like, 'Well, why are you so overweight?' Well, because I'm a compulsive overeater in addition to being an anorexic and restricter.\"\n\nDuring the conversation, it became clear that the eating disorders may have originated in the fact that Bialik has faced a lot of pressure about her weight because of her career in acting, where there are expectations about an actor's size and shape — particularly a woman's. Later in the discussion, Bialik confirmed that she had been in recovery for two years after seeking help for the eating disorders that she suffered with \"for years.\" This included cutting out caffeine and alcohol as she attempted to improve her own mental health.\n\nIf you need help with an eating disorder, or know someone who does, help is available. Visit the National Eating Disorders Association website or contact NEDA's Live Helpline at 1-800-931-2237. You can also receive 24/7 Crisis Support via text (send NEDA to 741-741).\n\nEating disorders are not the only mental health condition that Mayim Bialik has had to deal with throughout her life. The actor also has obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition that the U.K.'s National Health Service describes as a \"person having obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\" This can mean anything from focusing on unpleasant images and thoughts that cause anxiety to feeling the need to repeat behaviors over and over again. Due to the fact that many people feel embarrassed by OCD, a large proportion of people with the condition do not seek help or get any form of treatment.\n\nSpeaking about OCD on Instagram, Bialik said that the condition is not just about liking things to be a certain way or being a control freak but rather a way to alleviate anxiety. She explained, \"The compulsions are typically actions that are done to expel the anxiety from the obsessions.\" These obsessions can be any form of intrusive thought that typically revolves around her questioning herself and believing she has done something wrong. The actor also posted a video on social media to address the intrusive thoughts she has due to OCD and how they affect her daily life.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741, call the National Alliance on Mental Illness helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the National Institute of Mental Health website.\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" brought Mayim Bialik financial security and the knowledge that she would remain in demand as a television star. You might think all of that would allow the actor to splurge and treat herself to something nice every now and again. That's not the case, however, with Bialik revealing that she struggles to buy anything for herself despite being able to spend cash on gifts for her friends and family.\n\nWriting on Grok Nation, Bialik recalled a time immediately after the end of \"The Big Bang Theory\" when she set out to purchase some expensive jewelry to mark the occasion and remind her of the time she spent on the show. But this was not something she was used to doing, and the whole experience was uncomfortable for her. \"I simultaneously felt caught off guard and under pressure,\" Bialik said. \"I had never considered buying something expensive to commemorate the end of the show.\"\n\nEventually, she settled on buying a few items of jewelry that were not expensive and also bought much fancier presents for some of the most important people in her life. \"I don't know that I got over my hesitation or distaste for buying myself fancy things. I still feel weird about it if I'm being perfectly honest,\" she admitted.\n\nOver the last few years, Mayim Bialik has been outspoken about various issues. These have included everything from mental health to family life, with the actor writing books, running a blog, and hosting a podcast to discuss these topics. While much of her content has been well-received, some has caused controversy, particularly her views on parenting and childbirth.\n\nSpeaking to Self magazine, Bialik espoused the positive aspects of natural births and noted that certain people sometimes look down upon C-sections. The actor later sent an email to the article's author Taffy Brodesser-Akner, pointing out that holistic birth isn't for everyone. \"There are those among us who believe that if the baby can't survive a home labor, it is okay for it to pass peacefully,\" Bialik wrote. \"I do not subscribe to this, but I know that some feel that... if a baby cannot make it through birth, it is not favored evolutionarily.\"\n\nThese comments caused outrage, with many expressing their anger on social media. Meanwhile, her thoughts about hormonal birth control also drew criticism, as they were not based on scientific evidence or consensus. Also problematic for many was Bialik's advocacy for attachment parenting, such as encouraging parents to sleep in the same bed as their children — a practice that can lead to an increased risk of death for babies.\n\n\"Jeopardy!\" is one of the most successful quiz shows in U.S. television history. Throughout much of its run, the show was hosted by Alex Trebek, who died in 2020 from pancreatic cancer. This led to a series of guest hosts replacing him. By 2022, Mayim Bialik and Ken Jennings had assumed the role of permanent hosts, alternating according to their schedules, However, Bialik's tenure on \"Jeopardy!\" came to an end in 2023.\n\nBialik announced her departure from the quiz show on Instagram, revealing that Sony had let her go while keeping the details pretty vague. \"Sony has informed me that I will no longer be hosting the syndicated version of Jeopardy! I am incredibly honored to have been nominated for a Primetime Emmy for hosting this year and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have been part of the Jeopardy! family,\" she wrote.\n\nSony put out a similar announcement, confirming that Ken Jennings would be the sole host of Jeopardy! going forward. \"We made the decision to have one host for the syndicated show next season to maintain continuity for our viewers,\" the statement read (via TV Line). \"We are truly grateful for all of Mayim's contributions to 'Jeopardy!,' and we hope to continue to work with her on primetime specials.\"\n\nThere were rumors that the decision to let Mayim Bialik go from \"Jeopardy!\" was linked to her not participating in the final episodes of the show's 39th season to show support for the writers' strike. However, According to TMZ, it was not because of her decision to show solidarity with the writers but because her absence made Sony realize that \"Jeopardy!\" didn't actually need to have two permanent hosts. Producers were also reportedly struggling to accommodate Bialik's schedule around filming the quiz show. Either way, her exit was music to the ears of many viewers.\n\nBialik's time on \"Jeopardy!\" was not always positive: She faced a lot of criticism from some fans of the show. While some of this is definitely due to misogyny, with TV game shows dominated by male hosts, there are some other factors at play. Bialik's critics have pointed out that she seemingly has inconsistent rules when it comes to asking contestants to clarify answers and a perceived unprofessional attitude where she gets too impressed with correct responses. Others have even claimed she has made crucial mistakes by accepting wrong or partial answers.\n\nWhen news of Bialik's departure broke, many people took to social media to discuss it. On Reddit, the general consensus was that Ken Jennings is far better in the role. \"Ken is so good and has only gotten better. I don't dislike Mayim but this is good news,\" said u/MartonianJ, while another user wrote, \"I was never a hater, but good. Ken has been far and away the best choice from day 1. This is the right move for the show.\"\n\nMayim Bialik was at the center of a controversy after The New York Times published an article about her in October 2021. In the piece, the paper included quotes from Bialik's 2012 book \"Beyond the Sling,\" a parenting guide. In it, she revealed that she and her partner \"made an informed decision not to vaccinate our children.\" This quote was taken out of context by a number of readers, who mistakenly believed that she was against the COVID-19 vaccine. \"It's like, 'Did you not read the article?'\" she said while addressing the backlash on the podcast \"Jalen Rose: Renaissance Man.\" \"I really just wanted to be like, 'I'm not an anti-vaxxer.' Like, my kids were vaccinated late. That's true.\"\n\nBialik clarified her stance further in a YouTube video, explaining that some parents opt against giving their children certain vaccines because they have medical conditions that can be exacerbated by ingredients in vaccines. She goes on to say that her family would be getting the COVID-19 vaccine because the virus is \"highly contagious and highly insidious.\" Despite getting the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster jab, Bialik contracted the virus in 2022. \"It's very exhausting,\" she said in an Instagram video.\n\nMany of Bialik's fans quickly offered her their support. However, she also received some backlash for making the video, as the message that she had been vaccinated obviously hadn't reached some of her followers. Bialik had to defend herself once more in another Instagram video, stating: \"I do have COVID as a person who is vaccinated and boosted. No one said you wouldn't get COVID if you're vaccinated and boosted.\"\n\nShe may not be an anti-vaxxer, but Mayim Bialik's opinion on vaccines is still a cause of concern for many parents in the United States. The actor has been criticized for supporting the work of Dr. Bob Sears, who argues that parents should follow their instincts and should not be forced to vaccinate their children if it makes them uncomfortable. As reported by Mother Jones, Bialik \"endorsed anti-vaccine parenting books, including one by Dr. Bob Sears, the California pediatrician who had his medical license revoked for handing out dubious medical exemptions for immunizations.\" Sears (a polarizing figure who operates a family practice in Orange County, California) was ultimately placed on probation and is still taking on patients.\n\nIn more recent years, Bialik has taken a less controversial approach to vaccines when talking about them publicly. She was keen to stress that she was not an anti-vaxxer in the YouTube video she published on the topic, though she made it clear that she still has reservations about vaccines. She said: \"Do I think we give way too many vaccines in this country compared to when I was a child? Yes. Do I believe that most people don't even know what hepatitis B is but vaccinate their newborns for it anyway because they're simply told to? Yes. Do I believe that there's a tremendous profit that's made from vaccines and, specifically, from making sure that kids show up in school? Yes.\"\n\nMayim Bialik often talks about her mental health on the podcast \"Mayim Bialik's Breakdown,\" especially during the Ask Mayim Anything segment. While promoting her podcast during an interview with Daily Blast Live, Bialik opened up about the kinds of questions she gets asked. She revealed that there was one question about anxiety and feeling useless, which led to her opening up about her experience with imposter syndrome.\n\nImposter syndrome is a form of social anxiety that is described by Very Well Mind as the \"psychological experience of feeling like a fake or a phony despite any genuine success that you have achieved.\" People can experience imposter syndrome in all aspects of their lives, from careers to relationships. Bialik said many of her fans were surprised to learn that she has struggled with such feelings of self-doubt throughout her career, in spite of all her success.\n\n\"I think that feeling imposter syndrome, feeling less than, always feeling competitive with yourself even if no one else is telling you to be, those are features of a personality that have nothing to do with how many Emmys you've been nominated for or how famous you are or how much money you have,\" Bialik said during the interview (via Instagram). \"That's a really perfect example of the depth and complexity of our internal world.\""
