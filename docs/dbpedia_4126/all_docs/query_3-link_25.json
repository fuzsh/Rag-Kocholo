        "text": "As part of their agreement on realigning Emmy Awards by Genre and not by daypart, The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) and the Television Academy announced today that Game Show categories will no longer be awarded during the annual Daytime Emmy Awards telecast which is overseen by NATAS and will instead be presented by the Television Academy beginning in 2023.\n\nThe eligibility period for nominations has been extended to help with the migration to the Television Academy Emmys with an 18-month window, January 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023. According to the new rules, a program with game elements must primarily take place in-studio and involve mental challenges to be eligible for Outstanding Game Show. They must be self-contained or carry-over (winner continues to next episode) and cannot be arced.\n\nAs for Outstanding Host for a Game Show, the award will be presented to the “master of ceremony” host(s) for a continuing performance in a Game Show.\n\nTo avoid confusion between Outstanding Game Show and Outstanding Competition Program (which awards programs with reality-style, skill-based competitions), the category for the latter will be revised to Outstanding Reality Competition Program.\n\nTo recap, the new categories under the Television Academy are as follows:\n\nOutstanding Game Show\n\nOutstanding Host for a Game Show\n\nOutstanding Reality Competition Program\n\nGame shows and reality competition programs with solely children as contestants must enter in the Children’s & Family Emmy Awards.\n\nDuring “The 49th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards” presentation in June, Steve Harvey won for Outstanding Game Show Host for hosting “Family Feud.” Meanwhile, “Jeopardy!” won for Outstanding Game Show."
