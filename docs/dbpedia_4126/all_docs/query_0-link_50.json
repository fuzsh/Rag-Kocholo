        "text": "When the Emmys were handed out on June 7, Days of Our Lives’ Wally Kurth went home without a statuette in hand for Outstanding Supporting Actor. (General Hospital castmate Robert Gossett scored the win.) But Kurth didn’t want to let the moment pass without some acknowledgement.\n\n“Unlike past awards shows, when I didn’t really have a speech, last night I kinda did,” he shared via Instagram. “I know it’s not typical to say a speech when you didn’t win… but if I did end up onstage with Kelly Clarkson handing me the hardware, I might have said something like this.”\n\nWith that, Justin’s portrayer typed out his expression of gratitude. “Thank you,” he began. “I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees… And I also want to acknowledge every single actor and actress sitting in this room… my fellow one-take wonders… We walk a high-wire every day without a net… and we love it…. Be proud of yourselves.”\n\nFrom there, Kurth said, “I would have to ‘thank the writers for creating one hour of original, television drama… every single day.’ I would also ‘thank the producers for producing said drama… every single day.’ And of course I’d want to ‘thank my wife Debra for her love and support… and for tolerating me… every single day.’\n\n“And possibly joke, ‘It’s not easy being married to an actor, we can be… dramatic,'” he added. “My 30-second time limit would be up, but I’d probably continue because I’d want to thank Ken Corday ‘for giving me my big break in TV, 37 years ago, at a time when I really needed a job. And then 15 years ago, you did it again, at a time when I really needed a job; you reached out and invited me back to your show.\n\n“‘Thanks, Ken, for remembering me and investing in me.’ Maybe I’d point to the trophy and say ‘consider this a return on your investment.’ Lastly, I’d close with ‘I want to share this with the late, great John Aniston. John was on Days for 40 years and was there when I started in this crazy soap business. We worked very closely together and he taught me, by example, how to be a professional.'”\n\nVictor’s portrayer passed away a little less than two years ago. “‘I felt John’s spirit a lot this past year, and I want to share this with him,'” Kurth said, continuing his speech. “I’d hold the trophy up and say, ‘John, I hope I made you proud.’ So this is something I might have said if I’d won. Thank you all for your amazing support and love you’ve given me all these years.”"
