It is given in honor of an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role on a television drama series for the primetime network season.\n\nThe award was first presented at the 6th Primetime Emmy Awards on February 11, 1954. The acting awards presented during the inaugural years were not genre-specific, with actresses in either drama or comedy series receiving nominations and awards. While Eve Arden was the first winner in the female acting category, Loretta Young was the first actress to win for a lead performance in a drama series. By 1966, the acting awards were split into drama and comedy categories, undergoing several name changes until settling with the current title.\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 157 actresses, with 31 winning for performances in a drama series. Tyne Daly and Michael Learned hold the record for most wins in the category, with four each. Angela Lansbury is the most nominated actress in the category, with twelve nominations, though she never won. In 2015, Viola Davis became the first African-American woman to win, for her performance as Annalise Keating on How to Get Away with Murder. In 2020, Zendaya became the youngest winner, at age 24, for Euphoria. She won again in 2022, becoming the first African-American to win twice. As of 2024, Sarah Snook is the most recent winner, receiving the award for her work on Succession.\n\nWinners and nominations\n\nListed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees.\n\nKey Meaning Indicates the winning actress # Indicates a performance in a miniseries or television film, prior to the category's creation § Indicates a performance as a guest performer, prior to the category's creation\n\n1950s\n\nYear Actress Role Program Network Best Female Star of a Regular Series 1954\n\n(6th)\n\nEve Arden Connie Brooks Our Miss Brooks CBS Lucille Ball Lucy Ricardo I Love Lucy CBS Imogene Coca Various characters Your Show of Shows NBC Dinah Shore Herself The Dinah Shore Show Loretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show Best Actress Starring in a Regular Series 1955\n\n(7th)\n\nLoretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show NBC Gracie Allen Gracie Allen The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show CBS Eve Arden Connie Brooks Our Miss Brooks Lucille Ball Lucy Ricardo I Love Lucy Ann Sothern Susie McNamara Private Secretary Best Actress – Continuing Performance 1956\n\n(8th)\n\nLucille Ball Lucy Ricardo I Love Lucy CBS Gracie Allen Gracie Allen The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show CBS Eve Arden Connie Brooks Our Miss Brooks Jean Hagen Margaret Williams Make Room for Daddy ABC Ann Sothern Susie McNamara Private Secretary CBS Best Continuing Performance by an Actress 1957\n\n(9th)\n\nLoretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show NBC Jan Clayton Ellen Miller Lassie CBS Ida Lupino Various characters Four Star Playhouse Peggy Wood Mama Mama Jane Wyman Various characters Jane Wyman Theatre NBC Best Continuing Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic or Comedy Series 1958\n\n(10th)\n\nJane Wyatt Margaret Anderson Father Knows Best NBC Eve Arden Liza Hammond The Eve Arden Show CBS Spring Byington Lily Ruskin December Bride Jan Clayton Ellen Miller Lassie Ida Lupino Eve Drake Mr. Adams and Eve Best Actress in a Leading Role (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series 1959\n\n(11th)\n\nLoretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show NBC Phyllis Kirk Nora Charles The Thin Man NBC June Lockhart Ruth Martin Lassie CBS Jane Wyman Various characters The Jane Wyman Show NBC\n\n1960s\n\nYear Actress Role Program Network Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Series (Lead or Support) 1960\n\n(12th)\n\nJane Wyatt Margaret Anderson Father Knows Best CBS Donna Reed Donna Stone The Donna Reed Show ABC Teresa Wright Margaret Bourke-White NBC Sunday Showcase NBC Loretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Series (Lead) 1961\n\n(13th)\n\nBarbara Stanwyck Various characters The Barbara Stanwyck Show NBC Donna Reed Donna Stone The Donna Reed Show ABC Loretta Young Various characters The Loretta Young Show NBC Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Series (Lead) 1962\n\n(14th)\n\nShirley Booth Hazel Burke Hazel NBC Gertrude Berg Sarah Green The Gertrude Berg Show CBS Donna Reed Donna Stone The Donna Reed Show ABC Mary Stuart Joanne Gardner Search for Tomorrow CBS Cara Williams Gladys Porter Pete and Gladys 1963\n\n(15th)\n\nShirley Booth Hazel Burke Hazel NBC Lucille Ball Lucy Carmichael The Lucy Show CBS Shirl Conway Liz Thorpe The Nurses Mary Tyler Moore Laura Petrie The Dick Van Dyke Show Irene Ryan Granny The Beverly Hillbillies 1964\n\n(16th)\n\nMary Tyler Moore Laura Petrie The Dick Van Dyke Show CBS Shirley Booth Hazel Burke Hazel NBC Patty Duke Cathy Lane The Patty Duke Show ABC Irene Ryan Granny The Beverly Hillbillies CBS Inger Stevens Katy Holstrum The Farmer's Daughter ABC Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment – Actors and Performers 1965\n\n(17th)\n\nLeonard Bernstein Conductor New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts with Leonard Bernstein CBS Lynn Fontanne Fanny Bowditch Holmes Hallmark Hall of Fame: \"The Magnificent Yankee\" NBC Alfred Lunt Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Barbra Streisand Herself My Name Is Barbra CBS Dick Van Dyke Rob Petrie The Dick Van Dyke Show Julie Andrews Herself The Andy Williams Show: \"November 30, 1964\" NBC Johnny Carson Host The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson Gladys Cooper Margaret St. Clair The Rogues Robert Coote Timmy St. Clair Richard Crenna James Slattery Slattery's People CBS Julie Harris Florence Nightingale Hallmark Hall of Fame: \"The Holy Terror\" NBC Bob Hope Himself Chrysler Presents A Bob Hope Comedy Special Dean Jagger Principal Albert Vane Mr. Novak Danny Kaye Host The Danny Kaye Show CBS David McCallum Illya Kuryakin The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
