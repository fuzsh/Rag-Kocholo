        "text": "I want to thank Lori for filling in for me last while I was away. Fun fact: I actually went to Greece for my vacation. Turns out, they don’t want Konstantin either. And that’s a shame because Maggie’s finally ready to kick him to the curb! So let’s get into it and the rest of this week’s Days of Our Lives revelations.\n\nThe End Is Nigh\n\nLike Lori said last week with EJ learning about Jude, I was hoping for more when Maggie realized Konstantin’s been conning her. Her reaction felt almost too mild for finding out she’d been lied to and had her feelings manipulated for half a year. She did get upset, but I guess I wanted her to be a bit more bloodthirsty (metaphorically) about getting revenge, rather than just “Let’s tell the authorities!”\n\nIt’s just feeling flat and way too telegraphed. Big wedding upsets are the bread and butter for daytime, but when you plod into it, heavy handedly declaring you have a plan for revenge at the wedding, it loses any suspense or surprise. But at least Maggie’s finally seeing the truth! Good lord.\n\nAnd where did Konstantin murdering Maggie come from?! Have I been missing that?? If everyone was worried about it, why didn’t they do more to keep an eye on Konstantin? Theresa’s planning to marry Alex and get his money without killing him, so why can’t Kon do the same? So much for all that wasted attempt to humanize him. Are they just setting him up to take drastic, violent actions when his cover is blown? Was his visit to Sarah foreshadowing that?\n\nEh, as Lori said to me, “I mean, there’s no way that whole thing was plausible, so murder? Why not?”\n\nMeanwhile, at the Hall of DiMera…\n\nI swear, if Johnny and Chanel’s baby doesn’t come out with Jean Grey’s mutant telepathic superpowers inherited from Susan and enhanced by radiation, I don’t want this story. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for this kind of heartfelt tale with honest conversations about difficult topics like the possibility of birth defects. And moments like Johnny putting EJ in his place for that “protecting the DiMera bloodline” crap weave the reality of the situation into the “reality” of the show really well.\n\nBut I wish they’d have gotten there some way other than Radioactive Renegade Mayor. It just undercuts the seriousness of the story for me. Because this is not the X-Men.\n\nMore: Jessica Serfaty’s big moment\n\nAll I can say is an abortion is off the table. Days just went there for one thing, which I welcomed at the time since it’s an incredibly important topic that soap operas have fled from for years. But they just went there with a Black character. Doing that again would be horrendous. Parenthood is a rush for Johnny and Chanel, but I do not want them to kill this baby. Can we at least get Johnny a freaking job, first?\n\nI feel like this will be one of the first stories swept away when the normal writing team returns. “The baby’s fine, no worries!” (No, they aren’t back. The writers are still left out of the credits.)\n\nEJ’s Choice\n\nSo EJ knows it all now. Jude is Nicole’s and Eric’s. If he does the right thing, he runs the risk of losing Nicole. But if he does the wrong thing, he’s guaranteed to. Dan Feuerriegel acknowledged as much, when he said Nicole and EJ do have a chance if he handles it well. We know Arianne Zucker is leaving, but that doesn’t mean EJ and Nicole have to blow up before she does.\n\nBut he wouldn’t be EJ if he did handle it well. Also, by Monday, spoilers have him and Sloan plotting already… But fine. I’m willing to give “EJoan” a trial run. Also, was I the only one who had to refrain from yelling “No!” at the TV when Sloan wondered to Melinda whether all this effort to keep Eric was worth it?\n\nStray Thoughts…\n\nThere wasn’t a whole lot of “Beverett” this week, but we seemed to get a hint at what triggers Bobby when he switched over from Everett after seeing the divorce papers. And he finally referred to himself by Bobby.\n\nI guess Harris is gone? As fubsy put it in the comments of yesterday’s recaps, “I’m afraid this is one mission Agent Harris won’t be returning from. Ava might as well start swiping on Tinder now.” Cool. I’ll grab her phone.\n\nWe’ve now got four teens, a prom, a forbidden romance and a web of shifting infatuation. It’s a bit jammed in, but it’s a classic soap formula that could set up the next generation. I also know the classic response to teen material is: “We don’t want it.” So take that as you will.\n\nI see a serious Alex/Kristen, Kiriakis/DiMera black sheep romance racing towards us, provided the returning writers don’t abandon it.\n\nGet ready for Xander’s mom. That mention of her this week was not an accident, mark my words. (You can read more about that here.)\n\nStefan really told Gabi, “Rafe and I, we’re doing everything we can to find proof that you’re innocent.” Shouldn’t you have tried that 6 months ago? Still, I feel like we’re going to see Gabi on the other end of that phone very soon.\n\nBetween the Mother’s Day visit to Abigail’s grave (weren’t we just there?) and Chad finding her diary in next week’s spoilers, it looks like we’ve got another round of “Is Abigail coming back?” heading our way."
