        "text": "All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nSloan’s life may be falling apart bit by slow bit on Days of Our Lives, but out in the real world, Jessica Serfaty is living it up. Granted, it ain’t over ’til it’s over for Sloan, but with EJ now in on her secret and frantically trying to find out if it’s true, we’re pretty sure it’s just a matter of time until her happy home life blows up in her face. That, and it’s May Sweeps. Streaming or not, Days of Our Lives is likely going to hit us with some huge upheavals over the next month!\n\nBut hey, even if it all does fall apart, maybe Sloan would feel better with a designer dress or two and a gorgeous party to attend just like Serfaty did at the 2024 Met Gala! Unlike her portrayer, though, Sloan probably wouldn’t be attending with her love. We don’t see Eric going to the Gala — or sticking with her once he finds out all she’s done with Jude!\n\nSerfaty walked the carpet of the Met Gala with her fiance (They almost convinced us they’d married on April Fool’s Day!) Leonardo Maria Del Vecchio and, judging by the Instagram posts and the looks of sheer joy on her face in the photos, had the time of her life. You can check out the two of them at the Gala here. The actress shared a Tik Tok clip from Spanish celebrity magazine Hola! showing off her flower-studded Dolce & Gabbana look and wrote, “Always wished for a moment like this.”\n\nThis year’s Met Gala dress theme was “The Garden of Time” and was meant to pay tribute to the natural world. Which makes a custom flower-studded dress the perfect look for the event — if not necessarily for Days of Our Lives!\n\nThen again, as fan Jacob Gardner tweeted, “Can Sloan wear this outfit on Days, please?” That would certainly be a sight! But we’ve got a feeling she might have a tough time affording it after all that blackmail money sent Leo’s way.\n\nThen again, if Sloan and EJ end up hooking up after their respective marriages fall apart, that DiMera money could make all of Sloan’s fashion dreams come true!"
