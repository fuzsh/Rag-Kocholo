        "text": "Honorees will be recognized via remote video productions later this year.\n\nNEW YORK (April 29, 2020) — National Emmy® Awards for Daytime, Sports, and News & Documentary television programming, as well as achievement in television Technology & Engineering, will be recognized via remote video production for the remainder of the 2019-2020 awards cycle, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) announced today.\n\nThe Academy had previously determined that the Daytime Emmy® Awards would proceed without in-person ceremonies but had continued to plan for Sports, News & Documentary, and Technology & Engineering events. Recent comments and proposed economic reopening timetables released by federal, state, and local officials in New York and Los Angeles indicate events of more than 1,000 attendees in close proximity will remain restricted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“While it appears unlikely that officials would even permit these large-crowd events to be held this year, it is also clear that there will be a lag of time between being permitted to have an event and being able to provide an environment in which all attendees feel safe and comfortable attending it,” said NATAS President & CEO Adam Sharp. “Ultimately, a single person-to-person transmission resulting in serious infection would be devastating evidence of mistaken judgment in proceeding.”\n\nAwards in National Academy-administered Emmy® competitions will be presented instead in a series of productions later this year, leveraging multiple remote video production technologies to involve nominees and presenters. Program dates and times will be determined following upcoming nomination announcements for the Daytime Emmys® in May and the News & Documentary Emmys® this summer.\n\nToday’s decision does not impact ceremonies produced by NATAS’ 19 regional chapters — the majority of which have already committed to “virtual” events — nor those produced by NATAS’ sister academies: The Television Academy (Primetime Emmy® Awards) and the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. The International Emmy® Awards for News & Current Affairs will continue to be presented as part of the NATAS News & Documentary program, however.\n\nThe NATAS programs will be available on all leading “Smart TV” platforms via the Academy’s forthcoming apps, as well as through other distribution partners.\n\nORIGINAL EVENT SCHEDULE\n\nThe originally-scheduled dates for NATAS’ 2020 ceremonies had been:\n\nThe 71st Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy® Awards\n\nApril 19, 2020 — NAB Show, Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nPreviously postponed on March 11, 2020 to October 2020\n\nThe 41st Annual Sports Emmy® Awards\n\nApril 28, 2020 — New York, NY\n\nPreviously postponed on March 13, 2020 to Fall 2020\n\nThe 47th Annual Daytime Emmy® Awards\n\nJune 12-14, 2020 — Pasadena, California\n\nPreviously postponed on March 19, 2020 to “virtual” ceremony in Fall 2020\n\nThe 41st Annual News & Documentary Emmy® Awards\n\nSeptember 2020 — New York, NY\n\nABOUT NATAS\n\nThe National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) is a service\n\norganization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of television and the promotion of creative leadership for artistic, educational, and technical achievements within the television industry. It recognizes excellence in television with the coveted Emmy® Awards for News & Documentary, Sports, Daytime and Daytime Creative Arts programming, as well as achievements in television Technology & Engineering.\n\nNATAS membership consists of more than 18,000 broadcast and media\n\nprofessionals represented in 19 regional chapters across the country. Beyond awards, NATAS has extensive educational programs including regional and national Student Production Awards, scholarships, publications, and major activities for both industry professionals and the viewing public."
