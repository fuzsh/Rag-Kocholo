        "text": "Kathryn McKinnon Berthold (born January 6, 1984), known professionally as Kate McKinnon, is an American actress and comedienne, who is best known as a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live and The Big Gay Sketch Show, and for playing the role of Dr. Jillian Holtzmann in the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot.\n\nMcKinnon is known for her character work and celebrity impressions of pop singer Justin Bieber, comedian television host Ellen DeGeneres, and political figures Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, Elizabeth Warren, Betsy DeVos, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Robert Mueller, and Jeff Sessions. She has been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards; one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and four for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, winning in 2016 and 2017.\n\nKathryn McKinnon Berthold was born and raised in the Long Island town of Sea Cliff, New York. She is the daughter of Laura Campbell, a parent educator, and Michael Thomas Berthold, an architect. She has a younger sister, Emily. Her father died when she was 18 years old.\n\nAs a child, McKinnon played several instruments. She started playing the piano when she was 5 years old, the cello when she was 12, and taught herself how to play the guitar when she was 15. She graduated from North Shore High School in 2002, and from Columbia University in 2006 with a theater major, where she co-founded a comedy group, Tea Party, which focused on musical improv comedy. At Columbia, she starred in three Varsity shows: V109 \"Dial D for Deadline\", V110 \"Off-Broadway\" and V111 \"The Sound of Muses\". She was also a member of Prangstgr√ºp, a student comedy group who set up and recorded elaborate college pranks.\n\nIn 2007, McKinnon joined the original cast of Logo TV's The Big Gay Sketch Show, where she was a cast member for all three seasons. Since 2008, she has performed live sketch comedy regularly at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. She has also worked as a voice-over actress, and has voiced characters for series such as The Venture Bros., Robotomy, and Ugly Americans.

She was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the second time in 2015. She eventually won the very next year, becoming the first actor from SNL to win the award since 1993.\n\nMcKinnon began appearing as Hillary Clinton on the series leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The real Clinton appeared alongside her in a sketch during the show's season 41 premiere. McKinnon has said that her impression of Hillary Clinton comes from a place of deep admiration, and that \"[she] unequivocally want her to win\" the 2016 presidential election. On November 12, 2016, which was the first show after Clinton's loss in the election, she reprised the role to open the show with a solo performance of \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen, whose death was announced two days before her performance. After the election, McKinnon began to impersonate Kellyanne Conway alongside Alec Baldwin as Trump. On February 11, she debuted her impression of Elizabeth Warren during Weekend Update and Jeff Sessions in the cold open.\n\nAllison Janney is an award-winning actress who has earned a solid reputation in stage productions and in many supporting roles on screen, and who more recently has become prominent by portraying one of the major characters in the popular TV series The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999).\n\nEntertainment Weekly magazine describes Janney's screen presence as \"uncommonly beautiful and infinitely expressive.\" As an actor, the magazine deems her to be \"one to watch.\"\n\nJanney was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Macy Brooks (Putnam), a former actress, and Jervis Spencer Janney, Jr., a real estate developer and jazz musician. While studying at Kenyon College, Janney answered a casting call for an on-campus play that was to be directed by Kenyon's most famous alumnus, the legendary actor Paul Newman. During her audition/interview, Janney played upon Newman's known passion for race car driving - she explained how she cut thirty minutes off of the 130 mile journey from her home town to the college. She got chosen for the play's cast.\n\nAfter earning her degree in drama, Janney took Joanne Woodward's suggestion to do further study at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse. She also studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.\n\nEarly in her career Janney got comedic roles in the soap operas Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) and Springfield Story (1952). Later, she gave memorable movie performances in supporting roles in Gnadenlos sch√∂n (1999), 10 Dinge, die ich an Dir hasse (1999), American Beauty (1999) and Nurse Betty (2000), and in the made-for-TV movie Solange es noch Hoffnung gibt (1997), among others.\n\nAmong her stage work, Janney has played in a revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\" on Broadway opposite Anthony LaPaglia, which earned her a Tony Award nomination, and a Drama League Award for outstanding artist for the 1997-98 season. She played in Noel Coward's \"Present Laughter\" opposite Frank Langella, which earned her the Outer Critics Circle Award and an Actors' Equity award. Janney also appeared in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"The Taming of the Shrew.\"\n\nIn 1999 Janney became part of the original cast of the acclaimed TV series The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999) where she played the President's press secretary who eventually gets promoted to the White House Chief of Staff. Her impressive work during the seven seasons of that renowned series earned her four Emmys and two SAG Awards.\n\nWith her reputation becoming more broadly established during her work on \"The West Wing\" Janney won more substantive roles in feature films, in the acclaimed The Hours - Von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit (2002) where she was Meryl Streep's lesbian lover, and in How to Deal - Wer braucht schon liebe? (2003) where she played Mandy Moore's mother.\n\nKristin Chenoweth is an American stage, screen and television actress, though, depending on who you ask, Chenoweth fans may disagree on what her most famous roles are. Since Chenoweth began her career, she has been credited with roles in musicals and plays on and off-Broadway, on various television shows and can be seen in movies on television and the big screen. She has also lent her recognizable voice numerous times to animated features.\n\nChenoweth was born in the small town of Broken Arrow, OK. Soon after her birth, Chenoweth was adopted by Jerry and Junie Chenoweth. She is very open about her adoption and has been known to support various adoption causes and organizations around the U.S. Although Chenoweth knows the backgrounds of her birth parents, she has commented that she has little interest in meeting them. The Chenoweth family includes older brother Mark. Chenoweth graduated from Broken Arrow High School and went on to study Musical Theater at Oklahoma City University. Under the guidance of Florence Birdwell, Chenoweth flourished in stage and vocal performance. She later received her Master's Degree in Opera Performance at OCU.\n\nAn avid fan of all things Oklahoman, Chenoweth was inducted into the 2010 State Hall of Fame. Fans of Kristin Chenoweth, the stage actress, have seen her stealing performances in Steel Pier, Epic Proportions, and The Apple Tree. In 1999, Chenoweth received the Tony Award for her performance as \"Sally\" in \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\". Chenoweth is well-known as the originator of \"Glinda\" in the 2003 mega-hit musical \"Wicked\". The role, written with Chenoweth in mind, earned her a Tony Award Nomination amongst many other accolades. Chenoweth returned to Broadway in 2010, alongside Sean Hayes in the Broadway revival of \"Promises, Promises\". In January of 2007, Chenoweth became the third musical theater performer in history to have a solo performance at NYC's Metropolitan Opera. She has also performed with various Symphonies around the world. Chenoweth has recorded 3 studio albums. Those who know Kristin best from her various television performances remember her as the quirky, down on love, \"Olive Snook\" on Pushing Daisies (2007). The role won Ms. Chenoweth an Emmy Award in 2009 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. The show, ultimately canceled shortly after its 2nd season, is still considered by Kristin to be one of her favorite characters to play.\n\nIn 2001, Chenoweth starred in the short-lived NBC comedy Kristin (2001). She has also been seen on The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999), Alles Betty! (2006) and has a recurring role on Fox's Glee (2009) as the recovering alcoholic has-been, but lovable \"April Rhodes\" . Her appearances on \"Glee\" earned her a 3rd Emmy nomination. Most recently, Ms. Chenoweth had a small part in the 2010 comedy, Du schon wieder (2010). She has also had roles in Mein Schatz, unsere Familie und ich (2008), Blendende Weihnachten (2006), Krass (2006) and link=tt0420223]. In 2009, Chenoweth took on the challenging role as \"Linda\" in the film, Into Temptation (2009). Ms. Chenoweth is bi-coastal, spending a good amount of time in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nTall (5'10\"), lovely, statuesque Seattle native Jean Elizabeth Smart was born on September 13, 1951. The second of four children born to a teacher and his wife, she developed an early interest in acting and attended the University of Washington following her graduation from Seattle's Ballard High School. She attained a BA degree in fine arts there.\n\nJean's first professional season was with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival where she went on to perform in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing\" and \"A Moon for the Misbegotten,\" among others. During the late 1970's she built up a strong resume in regional theater with such companies as the Seattle Repertory Theatre (\"Equus,\" \"Fallen Angels\"), ACT (\"A Christmas Carol\"), Pittsburgh Public Theatre (as Lady Macbeth), Alaska Repertory Theatre (\"Terra Nova\"), and Alliance Theatre (\"A History of the American Film\"). Her first significant break came with a starring role in the potent, critically-acclaimed lesbian drama \"Last Summer at Bluefish Cove,\" which earned her an Off-Broadway Drama Desk nomination in 1980. She capped this honor with a Los Angeles Drama Critics award in 1983 when she repeated her triumph on the West Coast.\n\nJean made a highly auspicious Broadway debut in 1981 playing Marlene Dietrich in \"Piaf\" starring Jane Lapotaire, and it was the subsequent TV taping of that show, Piaf (1984), that brought about major Hollywood interest. A regular on the short-lived sitcoms Teachers Only (1982), Reggie (1983) and Aufstand der Verfluchten (1984), Jean hit pure gold in her fourth attempt as the delightfully ditzy Charlene Frazier on Sugarbaker's: Mann muss nicht sein (1986). The show was an instant hit and it was here that she would meet future husband Richard Gilliland, who played the recurring role of co-player Annie Potts' boyfriend J.D. for several seasons.\n\nFeeling confined and fearing typecasting, Jean left the show in 1991 to find more challenging work. She drew major acclaim, giving a chilling portrayal of a true-to-life serial killer in the TV movie Auf dem Todesstrich (1992), long before Charlize Theron copped an Oscar for her equally chilling cinematic version. In other TV movies, Jean earned strong applause for her roles as a mentally challenged woman in Kampf einer Mutter (1994); as a concerned rural mother in Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' classic The Yearling (1994); as an attorney involved in a high-profile murder case in Skrupellos verf√ºhrt - Die Unschuld des M√∂rders (1996); as a wife who discovers her longtime husband is gay in Verborgene Gef√ºhle (1998); co-starring with real-life husband Richard Gilliland in Audrey's Rain (2003) as new parents after her sister commits suicide; and as an FBI profiler in Killer Instinct: From the Files of Agent Candice DeLong (2003).\n\nOn stage, Jean she earned a Tony nomination for her delightfully madcap part in the Moss Hart/George S. Kaufman classic comedy farce \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" opposite Nathan Lane. The Broadway show was later made as a TV movie, The Man Who Came to Dinner (2000), with both Lane and Smart.\n\nHaving made her debut with a small role in the crimer Hoodlums (1980), films would never be as strong a venue for Jean as the stage or TV. She did, however, show off her versatility in both comedy and drama with secondary roles with such films as Die Grenzw√∂lfe (1984), the Goldie Hawn vehicle Protocol - Alles tanzt nach meiner Pfeife (1984), Fire with Fire - Verbotene Leidenschaft (1986), Projekt X (1987), Mistress - Die Geliebten von Hollywood (1992), Edie & Pen (1996) and Immer noch ein seltsames Paar (1998). Jean topped the decade off well with two independent films -- earning an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her role as Sarah Polley's ill-natured mother in Guinevere (1999), and first-billed in the mother/daughter road trip dramedy Forever Fabulous (1999) co-starring Jennifer Elise Cox.\n\nRemaining extremely busy into the millennium, Jean went on to win bookend Emmy awards for her guest appearances on the sitcom Frasier (1993) and earned two more Emmy nominations for her potent perms in the crime drama 24: Twenty Four (2001) starring Kiefer Sutherland. She also graced a host of other series with regular/recurring roles on the romantic comedy Meine Frau, ihr Vater und ich (2002); the crimer The District - Einsatz in Washington (2000); the family comedy Center of the Universe (2004) (co-starring John Goodman); the animated program Kim Possible (2002) (as the voice of Dr. Ann Possible); the mystery comedy Samantha Who? (2007) starring Christina Applegate; the revamped crimer Hawaii Five-0 (2010) (as the governor); the crime dramedy Harry's Law (2011); the dark thriller Fargo (2014); the action sci-fi drama Legion (2017); and the detective series Mare of Easttown (2021).\n\nMore recent films include Youth in Revolt (2009), Die Barry Munday Story (2010), Wie beim ersten Mal (2012), Waking (2013), Warren (2014), Miss Meadows - Rache ist s√º√ü (2014), The Accountant (2016), Life Itself (2018) and Brampton's Own (2018).\n\nDiagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 13, Jean has played an active part over the years in public awareness. She has two children with her late husband Richard, son Connor and adopted son (from China) Forrest.\n\nChristine Baranski is an American actress from Buffalo, New York. She has had a relatively lengthy career in both film and television. She has been nominated for 15 Emmy Awards, winning once. One of her most popular roles was that of neuroscientist Dr. Beverly Hofstadter in the sitcom \" The Big Bang Theory \". She played this role from 2009 to 2019.\n\nBaranski was born to a Polish-American family. Her parents were newspaper editor Lucien Baranski and his wife Virginia Mazurowska. Her grandparents were reportedly Polish theatrical actors. She was raised in the town of Cheektowaga, a suburb of Buffalo. Polish Americans have long been the dominant ethnicity in Cheektowaga.\n\nBaranski received her secondary education at the Villa Maria Academy, a Catholic high school operated by the Felician Sisters. In 1970, she enrolled in the Juilliard School, a private performing arts conservatory located in New York City. She studied drama for four years. She graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nIn 1980, Baranski made both her Off-Broadway debut and her Broadway debut. She later received critical acclaim for the leading role of Charlotte in the play \"The Real Thing\" (1982) by Tom Stoppard. For this role, Baranski won the 1984 \"Tony Award Best Featured Actress in a Play\".\n\nIn 1986, Baranski had a supporting role in the BDSM-themed erotic film \"9¬Ω Weeks\", loosely based on the novel \"Nine and a Half Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair\" (1978) by Ingeborg Day (1940-2011). The film earned 100 million dollars at the worldwide box office, and became a cult favorite. It was the first popular film in Baranski's career.\n\nIn 1990, Baranski had a role in the courtroom drama \"Reversal of Fortune\". The film was based on the trial of lawyer Claus von B√ºlow (1926-2019) for the attempted murder of his wife. The film under-performed at the box office, but was nominated for several awards.\n\nIn 1993, Baranski played the tyrannical camp counselor Becky Martin-Granger in the black comedy film \"Addams Family Values\". The film was loosely based on the comic strip \"The Addams Family\" by Charles Addams (1912-1988). Becky was one of the film's main antagonists, and an opponent for Wednesday Addams (played by Christina Ricci). The film earned about 49 million dollars at the domestic box office, and was well-received critically.\n\nIn 1995, Baranski gained a major television role in the sitcom \"Cybill\" (1995-1998). She played Maryann Thorpe, a wealthy and sharp-tonged woman. Maryann suffered from long-term ennui, motivating her to become more involved in the personal life of her best friend Cybill Sheridan (played by Cybill Shepherd). The series lasted for 4 seasons and a total of 87 episodes. Baranski won critical acclaim for this role. She won the 1995\"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\".\n\nIn 1996, Baranski played the supporting role of Katharine Archer in the comedy film \"The Birdcage\". In the film, Katharine is a former lover of the openly gay Armand Goldman (played by Robin Williams) and the mother of his son Val Goldman (played by Dan Futterman). She agrees to pretend to be Armand's wife in a meeting with Val's prospective in-laws. The film earned about 185 million dollars at the worldwide box office, one of the greatest box office hits in Baranski's career.\n\nIn 2000, Baranski played Martha May Whovier in the Christmas film \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\". The film was based on the 1957 children's story of the same name by Dr. Seuss (1904-1991). In this adaptation, the Grinch (played by Jim Carrey) has a life-long romantic interest in Martha May, but has trouble expressing his feelings to her. The film earned about 363 million dollars at the worldwide box office, and became the sixth highest-grossing film of 2000.\n\nAlso in 2000, Baranki was cast in the major role of producer Marsha Bickner in the short-lived sitcom \"Welcome to New York\" (2000-2001).

She has never retired from acting, and she remains highly popular with both critics and audiences.\n\nShe was truly one mother of a mom...on stage, on film and on TV. A favorite firecracker on 80s and 90s television, tiny character player Estelle Getty became best known for her carping, meddlesome moms -- complete with bemused, cynical looks, irreverent digs and dead-pan Henny Youngman-like one-liners. Blunt and down-to-earth off-stage as she was on-, she scored big points with both the young and the old...and all those who fell in between. The middle-class masses and society's underdogs deemed Estelle one of their own. The star who had a hard time playing the star card also taught an earnest lesson to the millions of actor wannabes that it was never too late to get into the big leagues, pursue your dream and come out a winner. After nearly five decades of stage work, she achieved \"overnight\" stardom at age 62. Ill health forced her retirement in 2000 after only a decade and a half of celebrity. Yet even something as sinister as Lewy body dementia, a degenerative brain disease, couldn't take away her indomitable spirit and feistiness. The affliction, which slowly clouds then erases the memory banks, should have claimed her a couple of years after its detection, but she proved the doctors wrong and lived nearly eight years from its onset, dying peacefully in her Hollywood home on July 22, 2008.\n\nGetty was born Estelle Scher on July 25, 1923, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, the daughter of Sarah (Lacher) and Charles Scher, Polish Jewish immigrants who worked in the glass business. Starry-eyed as a very young child when her father first took her to see a vaudeville show at the New York Academy of Music, Estelle already had a mindset about her future. She almost immediately started taking singing, dancing and acting lessons and, following her graduation from Seward Park High School, she began building up experience in the Yiddish theater. She even attempted the stand-up comedy stage on the Catskills \"borscht belt\" circuit in upstate New York, but it was a time of rampant sexism and women comics were a rarity and seldom successful. She wasn't. Her young life took an abrupt, post-World War II turn when she married New York businessman Arthur Gettleman at age 24 in December of 1947 (she went on to use a derivative of her married last name for the stage). Not your typical domesticated wife by any stretch of the imagination, Estelle nevertheless raised two children, sons Barry and Carl, and worked as a secretary for various companies.\n\nDetermined as ever to be an actress, she found moderate compensation performing in community theatre plays. Adept at playing abrasive, insinuating types, she had an innate gift for comedy and stole many scenes in such light-hearted plays as \"Arsenic and Old Lace,\" \"Blithe Spirit,\" \"6 Rms Riv Vu,\" \"Light Up the Sky\" and \"Lovers and Other Strangers\". On the flip side, Estelle demonstrated surprising dramatic stamina in such classics as \"All My Sons,\" \"The Glass Menaqerie\" and \"Death of a Salesman.\" Following decades of obscurity, it was her connection to the actor/playwright Harvey Fierstein that turned the tide and started the ball rolling. Forging a deep friendship in the late 70s after appearing in small New York theaters together, and after considerable prodding by Estelle, Harvey wrote a part for his diminutive friend in the ground-breaking, autobiographical \"Torch Song Trilogy\". Playing Harvey's recalcitrant mother, the show eventually made it to Broadway and Estelle's big debut was a resounding success. Winning the Helen Hayes Award for her performance, she played the feisty foil to Fierstein's raspy-voiced drag queen for five years.\n\nWhile on tour with the play in Los Angeles, Estelle secured an audition for and won the role of viper-tongued Sicilian mama Sophia Petrillo on Golden Girls (1985). She nearly lost out on the part when it was thought that she appeared too young to play Bea Arthur's mother. In truth, Estelle was 14 months younger than Bea. Given another go-around, and this time donning a grey wig, age makeup and frumpy apparel, Estelle fully convinced the powers-that-be that she WAS Sophia and the rest is history. The role was a breath of fresh air during an era of strong political correctness. A seven-time consecutive Emmy Award nominee for \"Best Supporting Actress Award,\" she took home the trophy in 1988. In both 1991 and 1992 Estelle won the American Comedy Award for \"Best Supporting Actress\" in a series. The Sophia character was so popular she even went on to play the impish octogenarian in several other shows, including two \"Golden Girls\" spin-offs -- the short-lived Golden Palace (1992) and \"Empty Nest\". Estelle went on to mother other stars on the big screen as well, including Cher in Die Maske (1985) and Sylvester Stallone in Stop! Oder meine Mami schie√üt! (1992), in the latter of which she received second billing. The one maternal film role she wanted more than anything did not come her way. When Das Kuckucksei (1988) was made into a film, actor Fierstein needed star power surrounding him. Anne Bancroft replaced Estelle in the part and she was heartbroken. The movie itself lost much of its impact in its transition from the stage. At the peak of her TV fame, Estelle wrote a 1988 autobiography entitled \"If I Knew Then, What I Know Now... So What?\" with Steve Delsohn.\n\nThe diminutive dynamo (4'10\") with a big heart was an outspoken activist for gay rights and she regularly involved herself in AIDS causes, part of it propelled by a nephew who was diagnosed and later succumbed to the disease. She also became a spokesperson for Alternative Living for the Aging, a nonprofit organization that locates cooperative housing for senior citizens. In 2000, Getty stopped making public appearances after her health and mind began its slow decline. One of her last sightings was in the L.A. audience of \"The Vagina Monologues,\" which starred \"Golden Girls\" co-star Rue McClanahan. Misdiagnosed as having both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, it was later learned she was suffering from advanced dementia. Estelle died of complications from her disease just three days before her 85th birthday. Long-time husband Arthur, who was only 5'3\" tall himself, never adjusted to Estelle's meteoric rise and the media attention that had accompanied it. He quietly maintained her parents' glass business far from the Hollywood glitz...in Florida. He died in 2004. Lifetime television hosted a \"Golden Girls\" reunion, but by this time Estelle was too ill to appear. Shortly after her death on July 22, 2008, and in tribute to Ms. Getty, Lifetime, which shows reruns of \"The Golden Girls\" almost on a daily basis, announced that it would air ten episodes of the series featuring the \"best of Sophia\". A simple, unadorned service was conducted, as she would have wanted, and she was interred at Hollywood Forever Memorial Park in Los Angeles."
