        "text": "CBS may have ended last season in third place, but its surprise hit, the Western miniseries “Lonesome Dove,” not-so-surprisingly netted the most nominations Thursday for the 41st annual nighttime Emmy Awards, topping by one the most nominated show of the last two seasons, “L.A. Law.”\n\n“Lonesome Dove,” the critically acclaimed, eight-hour adaptation of Larry McMurtry’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, garnered 18 nominations--including one as best miniseries and others for stars Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duvall, Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston.\n\nIts showing pushed CBS to a strong second place among the nomination leaders. Ratings king NBC, which has dominated the Emmy nominations for the last six years, collected 103 of the 364 nominations, with CBS getting 95 and ABC 85. PBS programs netted 32, and syndicated programs got 21 nominations. Fox Broadcasting shows got 12. Cable programs, which became eligible for nomination for the first time last year, received 16 nominations, only one more than last year.\n\nSuzanne de Passe, co-executive producer of “Lonesome Dove” and president of Motown Productions, said Thursday that when she got the 6 a.m. call from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences informing her of the 18 nominations, “I immediately burst into tears.\n\n“It’s probably the most satisfying moment I think I’ve ever had. . . ,” she said. “I’m so thrilled--not just for the actors and what they call the major categories, but for our costumer, all of the people who really gave it all of that look, the photography, the music. For me as a producer and as part of the producing team, it really means we selected great people.”\n\nDe Passe added that the multiple nominations will not affect Motown’s decision on whether to produce a sequel to what was the highest rated miniseries of the last five years. That depends, she said, on whether author McMurtry endorses it. “It’s the only way I would be happy (doing a sequel),” she said.\n\nLast year’s best series winners--ABC’s “thirtysomething” in drama and ABC’s “The Wonder Years” in comedy--were nominated in those categories again and also picked up more total nominations than in their first year on the air. “thirtysomething” got 13, compared to its 1988 total of 10, while “The Wonder Years,” which received only two nominations in 1988--in the series and writing categories--garnered 14 this time out.\n\nCBS newcomer “Murphy Brown,” starring Candice Bergen as a hard-driving TV newswoman, became the most-nominated new series of last season with 11 nominations. But the series faces stiff competition in the best comedy category: Other nominees include previous Emmy-winners “The Wonder Years,” NBC’s “Golden Girls” and NBC’s “Cheers,” along with CBS’ “Designing Women.”\n\n“We’re thrilled, we’re just thrilled,” said Diane English, co-executive producer of “Murphy Brown” with husband Joel Shukovsky. “A part of me would like to be the kind of person who says, ‘It means nothing; I don’t care,’ but let’s be honest: This is pretty great--especially since we’re such a new show.”\n\nEnglish acknowledged that the thrill of being nominated is tempered by the waiting period between now and the Emmy Awards ceremony, which will be held Sept. 17 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.\n\n“Now is the part when it’s not so much fun, where people try to involve you in that competition, and it really shouldn’t be that,” she said. “It would be great if it didn’t come down to one winner, because the stuff that gets nominated is all so good. It would be great if it just ended here--that these are the five best shows in each category.”\n\n“Murphy Brown” has been only a marginal ratings success for CBS--but ratings don’t necessarily translate into Emmy nominations. The three top-rated series of last season received only six nominations among them--four for ABC’s “Roseanne” and one each for NBC’s Thursday-night tandem of “The Cosby Show” and “A Diffent World”--and none was nominated as best comedy series.\n\nThe star of “Roseanne,” former stand-up comedian Roseanne Barr, also failed to win nomination as best actress in a comedy series, although John Goodman, who plays her husband, was nominated as best actor. Also notably absent among the comedy nominees was John Larroquette of “Night Court,” who has won the Emmy as best supporting actor for four years in a row.\n\nBut while Barr was an entrant in the competition, Larroquette was not: The actor took advantage of a new Emmy rule that requires actors to enter themselves in the competition, as do producers, writers and entrants in all other categories. In previous years, the producers of the shows were allowed to enter their cast members in the acting categories.\n\nLarroquette said Thursday that he chose not to enter. “I think my thought process was that the generosity of the Academy toward me has been magnanimous, and I just felt that I didn’t want to overstay my welcome,” he said. “I don’t think there was any real devious thought about it, such as, ‘I’ve never lost and I don’t want to lose now.’ ”\n\nAlong with the “Murphy Brown” nomination as best comedy, CBS scored another coup in the best drama category with its second-season series “Wiseguy,” the story of undercover agent Vinnie Terranova (Ken Wahl). Other best drama nominees were ABC’s “China Beach,” CBS’ “Beauty and the Beast,” NBC’s “L.A. Law” and ABC’s “thirtysomething.”\n\nWahl also found a place among the nominated lead actors in a drama series, along with Ron Perlman of “Beauty and the Beast,” Edward Woodward of “The Equalizer,” Carroll O’Connor of “In The Heat of the Night” and Michael Tucker of “L.A. Law.”\n\nLead actresses nominated in the drama category were Linda Hamilton of “Beauty and the Beast,” Dana Delany of “China Beach,” Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry of “L.A. Law,” and Angela Lansbury of “Murder, She Wrote.”\n\nSeveral special programs and movies received multiple nominations. “My Name Is Bill W.,” ABC’s dramatization of the life of the man who started Alcoholics Anonymous, got 7, including an acting nomination for James Woods. NBC’s controversial “Roe vs. Wade,” the story of the landmark abortion case, got 6 nominations, among them nods for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or special for Holly Hunter and Amy Madigan.\n\nThe PBS “Great Performances” installment “Dance In America: Gregory Hines Tap Dance in America” won five nominations; HBO’s “Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story” got three.\n\nOn the late-night front, newcomer Arsenio Hall may not be beating competitors Johnny Carson and David Letterman in the ratings yet, but he got more Emmy nominations: “The Arsenio Hall Show” got three, and Carson and Letterman got only two.\n\nHere are the other nominees for the 41st annual Emmy Awards:\n\nMINISERIES: “I Know My First Name Is Steven,” NBC; “Lonesome Dove,” CBS; “A Perfect Spy--Masterpiece Theatre,” PBS; “War and Remembrance,” ABC; “The Women of Brewster Place,” ABC.\n\nVARIETY, MUSIC OR COMEDY PROGRAM: “The Arsenio Hall Show,” Syn.; “Dance in America: Gregory Hines Tap Dance in America--Great Performances,” PBS; “Late Night With David Letterman,” NBC; “Saturday Night Live,” NBC; “The Tracey Ullman Show,” Fox.\n\nDRAMA/COMEDY SPECIAL: “David,” ABC; “Day One--AT&T; Presents,” CBS; “Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story,” HBO; “My Name Is Bill W.--Hallmark Hall of Fame,” ABC; “Roe vs. Wade,” NBC.\n\nCLASSICAL PROGRAM IN THE PERFORMING ARTS: “Bernstein at 70!--Great Performances,” PBS; “Dance in America: Baryshnikov Dances Balanchine--Great Performances,” PBS; “Dance in America: A Night at the Joffrey--Great Performances,” PBS; “Horowitz Plays Mozart,” Syn.; “Ray Charles in Concert With the New York City Ballet--Live From Lincoln Center,” PBS.\n\nINFORMATIONAL SERIES: “Cops,” Fox; “A Current Affair,” Syn.; “Entertainment Tonight,” Syn.; “Nature,” PBS; “Unsolved Mysteries,” NBC.\n\nINFORMATIONAL SPECIAL: “AIDS: The Global Explosion,” Syn.; “A Duke Named Ellington,” PBS; “The 50th Barbara Walters Special,” ABC; “Lillian Gish: The Actor’s Life for Me--American Masters,” PBS; “The Unforgettable Nat (King) Cole, Disney.\n\nANIMATED PROGRAM ONE HOUR OR LESS: “Abel’s Island,” PBS; “Garfield: Babes and Bullets,” CBS; “Garfield: His 9 Lives,” CBS; “Madeline,” HBO; “Meet the Raisins,” CBS.\n\nANIMATED PROGRAM MORE THAN ONE HOUR: “Disney’s Ducktales: Super Ducktales,” NBC.\n\nCHILDREN’S PROGRAM: “Free to Be . . . a Family,” ABC; “I Have AIDS--A Teenager’s Story: A 3-2-1 Contact Extra,” PBS; “The Jim Henson Hour,” NBC; “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe--Wonderworks,” PBS; “Young Charlie Chaplin--Wonderworks,” PBS.\n\nSPECIAL EVENTS: “Cirque du Soleil, The Magic Circus,” HBO; “The 11th Annual Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts,” CBS; “The 42nd Annual Tony Awards,” CBS; “Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting,” NBC; “The 17th Annual American Film Institute Life Achievement Award: A Salute to Gregory Peck,” NBC.\n\nLEAD ACTOR MINISERIES OR SPECIAL: Robert Duvall, “Lonesome Dove,” CBS; Tommy Lee Jones, “Lonesome Dove,” CBS; Ben Kingsley, “Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story,” HBO; James Woods, “My Name Is Bill W.--Hallmark Hall of Fame,” ABC; John Gielgud, “War and Remembrance,” ABC.\n\nLEAD ACTRESS MINISERIES OR SPECIAL: Diane Lane, “Lonesome Dove,” CBS; Anjelica Huston, “Lonesome Dove,” CBS; Amy Madigan, “Roe vs. Wade,” NBC; Holly Hunter, “Roe vs. Wade,” NBC; Jane Seymour, “War and Remembrance,” ABC.\n\nSUPPORTING ACTOR COMEDY SERIES: George Wendt, “Cheers,” NBC; Woody Harrelson, “Cheers,” NBC; Meshach Taylor, “Designing Women,” CBS; Joe Regalbuto, “Murphy Brown,” CBS; Peter Scolari, “Newhart,” CBS.\n\nSUPPORTING ACTOR DRAMA SERIES: Larry Drake, “L.A.
