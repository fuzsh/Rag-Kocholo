        "text": "(Photo by Everett Collection, Apple TV+, David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images, Mark Davis/Getty Images)\n\nBefore we say goodbye to Black History Month, we’re honoring some pioneers in the TV medium who overcame obstacles to diversify the American cultural experience.\n\nFrom the first Black actor to appear on TV to a media mogul who ranks among the country’s wealthiest people, these 41 performers and creatives changed television and paved the way for those that followed.\n\nHere is a timeline featuring Black TV trailblazers and over 65 of their firsts:\n\n1939 and 1962: Ethel Waters Appears on TV and Is Nominated for an Emmy\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nEthel Waters was the first Black performer seen on television. Her one-night variety special, The Ethel Waters Show, aired on NBC in 1939. She was joined by fellow Black actresses, Fredi Washington and Georgette Harvey, and they performed part of her play Mamba’s Daughters. Waters in 1962 would also become the first Black person to be nominated for an Emmy with her nomination for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for her work in episode “Goodnight, Sweet Blues” in the CBS adventure series Route 66. She is credited also as being the first Black woman to appear on radio, as well as several other “firsts.”\n\n1948: Amanda Randolph Appears in a TV Sitcom\n\n(Photo by CBS via Getty Images)\n\nIn 1948, Randolph starred in the DuMont network’s The Laytons. The sitcom was short-lived (it only ran from August to October of that year), but it marked the first time American TV audiences could regularly see a Black woman on a series. Randolph performs above in a photo from the 1944 musical program Amanda and the Boys.\n\n1950: Hazel Scott Hosts a TV Show\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAs Waters’ program only lasted one night, 1950’s The Hazel Scott Show gets the credit for being the first series to have a Black host, according to American film historian Donald Bogle in his book Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television. The 15-minute-long program, which first aired at 7:45 p.m. Fridays – and later ran on Mondays and Wednesdays, as well – was a musical format and featured Scott, a former child prodigy who had made a name for herself in tony New York supper clubs and movies like 1943’s Something to Shout About (pictured above) and 1945’s Rhapsody in Blue.\n\n1956 and 1960: Harry Belafonte and Sammy Davis Jr. Become Emmy Nominees and Belafonte Wins an Emmy\n\n(Photo by CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images; Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe two celebrated performers were both nominated in the since-retired category of Primetime Emmy Award for Best Specialty Act – Single or Group in 1956. Belafonte would go on to become the first Black performer to win an Emmy with his TV special “Tonight With Belafonte,” which was part of The Revlon Revue. Davis Jr. went on to be nominated for Outstanding Variety Act (1966) for The Swinging World of Sammy Davis Jr., Outstanding Cameo and Guest Appearances for One Live to Live (1980) and The Cosby Show (1989), eventually winning an Emmy for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy for Sammy Davis Jr.’s 60th Anniversary Celebration (1990).\n\n1956: Nat King Cole Gets His Own Network TV Series\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe renowned singer of such hits as “Unforgettable,” “L.O.V.E.,” and “(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66” was the first Black entertainer with a network TV series. The Nat King Cole Show ran for one season on NBC. His guests included legendary talent like Ella Fitzgerald, pictured with Cole above.\n\n1957: Louis S. Peterson Wins the Drama-Writing Emmy Award\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThough the Television Academy has nominated three, no Black writer has won an Emmy for writing a drama series. The first nomination went to playwright Peterson in 1957 for NBC’s Goodyear Playhouse episode “Joey,” which starred Anthony Perkins in the title role. (The two other nominees were David Mills in both 1996 and 1997 for NYPD Blue and Shonda Rhimes in 2006 for Grey’s Anatomy.) Peterson cowrote the screenplay for 1959 film Take a Giant Step (pictured), based on his play of the same name.\n\n1963 and 1974: Cicely Tyson Stars in a TV Drama and Wins the Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie Emmy\n\n(Photo by CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images)\n\nTyson starred in the series East Side/West Side, which premiered in 1963, and later won the 1974 Emmy Award for her starring role in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. She is also the first Black woman to receive an honorary Oscar.\n\n1966: Bill Cosby Wins the Lead Actor in a Drama Series Emmy\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe I Spy star won this category three years in a row and is the first Black actor to be nominated for and win a primetime Emmy and for a drama. Cosby went on to create and host the first all-Black cartoon, 1972’s Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids — introduced in 1969 primetime special Hey, Hey, Hey, It’s Fat Albert — and starred as Cliff Huxtable in popular sitcom The Cosby Show, which ran from 1984 to 1992. He was also the first Black entertainer to win the Outstanding Variety or Musical Program Emmy for The Bill Cosby Special in 1969. Cosby’s achievements have been largely overshadowed in recent years by his conviction on three counts of aggravated sexual assault and reports highlighting other allegations.\n\n1968: Diahann Carroll Stars as a Character With an Occupation That Was Not Cliché\n\n(Photo by NBCU Photo Bank)\n\nDiahann Carroll was the first Black woman to star in a TV series in a role that was not a housekeeper. Julia ran on NBC from 1968 to 1971, and Carroll starred as widowed nurse Julia Baker, raising a young son after the death of her husband in the Vietnam War.\n\n1967: Eartha Kitt Becomes Catwoman\n\n(Photo by Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images)\n\nSinger and actress Eartha Kitt took over the role as villain Catwoman on the 1960s live-action superhero series Batman from Julie Newmar, becoming the first Black entertainer to be cast in a comic book–based role. Though she only appeared in five episodes, Catwoman became one of her best-known roles.\n\n1969: Della Reese Hosts a Talk Show\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe former singer tried her hand at a talk show after also making history as the first woman ever to guest-host The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Though the series lasted only one season, the entertainer forged a path for the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Queen Latifah, Tyra Banks, and Wendy Williams.\n\n1971: Flip Wilson Wins Variety Series Emmy\n\n(Photo by Courtesy of Everett Collection)\n\nComedian Flip Wilson received an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Series – Musical for his wildly successful comedy series The Flip Wilson Show. The show ran for four seasons and enjoyed significant commercial success with an estimated audience of nearly 16.8 million in its first season, putting it second only to Marcus Welby, M.D. that year. The series increased its audience to 17.5 million in its second season (though it again took second place in ratings for the year — this time after All in the Family). Wilson is pictured above with guests Lena Horne and Tony Randall in a February 1974 episode.\n\n1970: Gail Fisher Wins an Acting Emmy as a Series Regular\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nWinning on her first nomination, Fisher was nominated three more times in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Emmy category for her role as secretary Peggy Fair on Mannix. ”I was the first black female — no, make that black, period — to make a national TV commercial, on camera, with lines,” she said about her pitch for All detergent, according to a 2001 New York Times obituary. She went on to make guest appearances on Fantasy Island, General Hospital, Knight Rider, and other shows from the mid-1970s through 1990.\n\n1974: Teresa Graves Leads a Network Drama\n\n(Photo by Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)\n\nGraves starred in ABC crime-drama Get Christie Love! as an undercover police officer. She is credited the first Black woman to lead a network drama and the second Black woman to star in an hour-long series after Diahann Carroll in sitcom Julia. A Jehovah’s Witness, she retired from acting soon after the series to devote her time to religion.\n\n1977: Roots Becomes a TV Phenomenon\n\n(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe eight-part miniseries, based on Alex Haley’s 1976 novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family, broke viewership records at the time of its airing. Nielsen put viewership of the show’s finale at just over one half of the U.S. population, which was 220 million at the time. The series portrayed slavery from Africa in the mid-1700s to post-Civil War America and spawned a sequel, Roots: The Next Generations, that continued the story into the 19th and 20th centuries. The original series garnered 37 Primetime Emmy nominations and won nine, including Best Limited Series. The author is pictured above with series star LeVar Burton, who went on to be nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series for his role as Kunta Kinte in episode “Part 1.”\n\n1977: Louis Gossett Jr. Wins an Emmy\n\n(Photo by ABC / Courtesy: Everett Collection)\n\nHis Roots costars John Amos, Levar Burton, and Ben Vereen were also nominated in the Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie category, but Gossett Jr. made history with his win. Gossett Jr. is pictured above left with costar Burton in a production still from Roots.\n\n1977: Olivia Cole Wins an Emmy\n\n(Photo by Walt Disney Television via Getty Images Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)\n\nCole’s performance as Kizzy in Roots won her the first award for a Black actress in the category of Supporting Actress in a Comedy or Drama Series, Single Appearance.\n\n1977: Black Vulture Joins the Super Friends\n\nHanna-Barbera’s Super Friends series featured classic DC Comics characters Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Batman and Robin. In 1977, The All-New Super Friends Hour introduced TV’s first Black superhero, Black Vulcan (voiced by Buster Jones), a flying character who can manipulate lightning. The character was controversial because he essentially replaced DC Comics superhero Black Lightning, who the company could not get rights to portray. Black Vulcan appeared in his first adventure in episode “The Whirlpool,” teaming up with Aquaman to rescue an oil tanker.\n\n1978 and 1988: Max Robinson and Carole Simpson Anchor Network News\n\n(Photo by Walt Disney Television via Getty Images Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)\n\nAs co-anchor of the ABC’s World News Tonight, Robinson made history in July 1978 as the first Black anchor of a network news program. A decade later, Carole Simpson became the first Black woman to anchor a major network news show as weekend anchor at ABC News.\n\n1979 and 1985: Robert Guillaume Wins Comedy Acting Emmys\n\n(Photo by Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)\n\nThe Benson star was the first Black actor to win in the lead actor in a comedy category. He won on his fifth nomination for his role as Benson DuBois, the same character that previously won the actor the comedy supporting actor Emmy for Soap.\n\n1980: The Johnsons Create Cable Network BET\n\n(Photo by Rebecca D'Angelo/Sygma via Getty Images)\n\nIn January 1980, former husband-and-wife team Robert L. Johnson and Sheila Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television (BET) as a programming block on Madison Square Garden network (now USA Network). Three years later, the network became its own channel.
