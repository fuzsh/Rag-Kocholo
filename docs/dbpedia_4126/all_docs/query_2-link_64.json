Thank you so much. To all the incredible actresses in this category, I'm so honored to be beside you thank you to the incredible, incredible cast and crew of Euphoria.\n\n'Thank you for making such a safe space to make this very difficult show I love you all so much thank you to the academy thank you to my friends and family, some of which are here tonight. Thank you to Sam [Levinson] for sharing with me. Thank you for believing in me, even in moments when I didn't believe in myself.'\n\nShe concluded her speech with a message to her fans as she said: 'Lastly I just want to say, you know, my greatest wish for Euphoria was that it could help heal people and I just want to say thank you to everyone who shared their story with me.\n\n'I want you to know that anyone who has loved a rue or feels like you are a rue, I'm so grateful for your stories and I carry them with me and carry them with her. Thank you so much.'\n\nIn the highly-popular series, she plays Ruby 'Rue' Bennett, a teenage drug addict who is fresh out of rehab and struggling to find her place in the world as she serves as the show's narrator.\n\nTed Lasso was once again a big winner at the event as the Apple TV+ series won the coveted Outstanding Comedy Series award along with the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series award for Jason Sudeikis.\n\nThe Outstanding Comedy Series award was presented by Jason's SNL pal Pete Davidson as was revealed by Dailymail.com earlier in the day.\n\nThe four-time Primetime Emmy Award winner hugged his 27-year-old friend as he accepted his shiny new trophy.\n\nThe 46-year-old funnyman then took to the microphone to thank the cast and crew and even boasted that the production for season 2 did not have a single shut down.\n\nSudeikis said: 'The show is about good and evil. It's about the truth and lies. This show is about all that stuff but it's mostly about our response to those things and your response to our show has been overwhelming.'\n\nHe concluded the speech with a special message to his children with Olivia Wilde as he said: 'Thank you, again, so much. Otis, Daisy I love you very much yeah, we'll stay for season 3 at some point.'\n\nTed Lasso bested an impressive field including: Abbott Elementary (ABC), Barry (HBO), Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO), Hacks (HBO), The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime Video), Only Murders in the Building (Hulu), and What We Do in the Shadows (FX).\n\nEarlier in the evening, Sudeikis won the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series as family was once again at the center of his acceptance speech.\n\nHe talked about his love for award shows and said: 'Thank you to my parents, Dan and Kathy, who I just mentioned, one of them. Thank you to my incredible -- our incredible cast. It's a joy to get to work with you guys, you guys are amazing.'\n\nJason beat out Donald Glover (Atlanta), Bill Hader (Barry), Nicholas Hoult (The Great), Steve Martin (Only Murders in the Building), and Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building).\n\nTed Lasso features Jason in the titular role of an American college football coach who heads to London to manage AFC Richmond, a struggling English Premier League football team.\n\nBrett Goldstein was also recognized for his work as he won Outstanding Supporting Actor for the show making it his second in a row.\n\nThe 42-year-old actor beat out: Anthony Carrigan (Barry), Toheeb Jimoh (Ted Lasso), Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso), Tony Shalhoub (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Tyler James Williams (Abbott Elementary), Henry Winkler (Barry), and Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live).\n\nSuccession earned the final award of the night in the Outstanding Drama Series category.\n\nThe HBO series faced heavy competition including: Better Call Saul (AMC), Euphoria (HBO), Ozark (Netflix), Severance (Apple TV+), Squid Game (Netflix), Stranger Things (Netflix), and Yellowjackets (Showtime).\n\nSeries creator Jesse Armstrong used the opportunity to take to the podium to diss the newly crowned King Charles III.\n\nThe 51-year-old British screenwriter and producer said: 'Big week for successions. New king in the UK... for us. Uh, evidently a little more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles.'\n\nThe comment received many gasps and cheers in the room as he explained: 'I’m not saying we’re more legitimate in our position that he is. We’ll leave that up to other people.'\n\nHe went on to thank the cast and crew in the speech as he said: 'We are incredibly grateful to have this, it's a wonderful honor. This group is extraordinary. It's a team effort.'\n\nEarlier in the night, Jesse also earned Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for episode All The Bells Say.\n\nThe HBO series is centered around The Roy family who is known for controlling the biggest media and entertainment company in the world. However, their world changes when their father steps down from the company.\n\nIt was a big night for Succession as one of the stars, Matthew Macfadyen, also won Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on the HBO program.\n\nHe beat out several castmates including: Nicholas Braun (Succession), Billy Crudup (The Morning Show), Kieran Culkin (Succession), Park Hae-soo (Squid Game), John Turturro (Severance), Christopher Walken (Severance), and Oh Yeong-su (Squid Game).\n\nMatthew began his speech saying: 'Golly okay thank you so much, to the television academy I'm deeply flattered and thrilled to bits I must say it really is such a pleasure and a privilege for me to play this bonkers gift of a role in this wonderful show.'\n\nIn the HBO series he plays Tom Wambsgans, Siobhan 'Shiv' Roy's (Sarah Snook) fiancé and then her husband; a Waystar executive who is promoted from heading the amusement park and cruise division to running ATN, the company's global news outlet. He enjoys his proximity to the Roy family's power but is frequently dismissed by the family's inner circle. He ingratiates himself with those more powerful than he, but torments his hapless subordinate, Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun).\n\nHBO limited series The White Lotus was perhaps the biggest winner of the night as it earned five during the televised portion of the broadcast including Outstanding Limited Series.\n\nIt also earned Outstanding Limited Series and Supporting Actor and Actress in a Limited Series for Murray Bartlett and Jennifer Coolidge, respectively.\n\nCoolidge, 61, won her first ever Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for playing Tanya in HBO's The White Lotus.\n\nThe flustered actress started getting played off, with the DJ playing Ray Charles' Hit the Road Jack, and instead of leaving the stage, she just started dancing, which brought out a slew of reactions at the Microsoft Theater and on social media.\n\nCoolidge beat out her White Lotus co-stars Connie Britton, Alexandra Daddario, Natasha Rothwell and Sydney Sweeney, and Dopesick's Kaitlyn Dever and Mare Winningham, though she was clearly not prepared to win.\n\n'Thank you! Gosh, what a night! I just want to say to my fellow nominees, just to be in your company, it's incredible,' she began.\n\nJennifer then explained she had taken a lavender bath before getting ready for the show and 'it made me swell up inside my dress.'\n\n'I'm having a hard time speaking. Anyway, this is so thrilling!' she added, before thanking the show's producers while the orchestra started to play.\n\n'This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing and I'm full, I'm full! Okay...' she added while thanking even more people before they started playing Hit the Road Jack.\n\n'Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on...' she said, though the DJ kept playing, prompting her to start dancing, to the delight of the audience.\n\nCoolidge will be the only star from Season 1 of The White Lotus to return for Season 2, which will be set at a resort in Sicily.\n\nBartlett, 51, triumphed over a field including a number of his castmates including: Jake Lacy (The White Lotus), Will Poulter (Dopesick), Seth Rogen (Pam & Tommy), Peter Sarsgaard (Dopesick), Michael Stuhlbarg (Dopesick), and Steve Zahn (The White Lotus).\n\nHe graciously thanked series creator and writer Mike White as well as the cast and crew as he began his speech saying: 'Thank you so much to the academy for inviting me up here. I'm truly honored. Mike, my god, Mike, thank you for giving me one of the best experiences of my life truly, I adore you and admire you. Thank you.\n\n'Thank you to our phenomenal cast and crew and producers on The White Lotus.

Thank you to the television academy.\n\n'Thank you to Netflix and thank you to the director for making realistic problems we all face come to life so creatively on the screen with a great script and amazing Thank you. Thank you Squid game team.'\n\nThat wasn't the only win for the highly-popular Netflix series as Hwang Dong-hyuk earned Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the episode Red Light, Green Light.\n\nSquid game is centered around hundreds of cash-strapped players who accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful moment of the night was when Sheryl Lee Ralph won Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work in Abbott Elementary and she tearfully belted out a song.\n\nThe 65-year-old actress hit the podium and sang: 'I am an endangered species / but I sing no victim's song / I am a woman, I am an artist / and I know where my voice belongs.'\n\nShe then had the crowd on her feet with a very inspiring speech as she said: 'To anyone who has ever, ever had a dream and thought your treatment wasn't, wouldn't, couldn't come true, I am here to tell you that this is what believing looks like this is what striving looks like and don't you ever, ever give up on you.\n\n'Because if you get a Quinta Brunson in your corner, if you get a husband like mine in your corner, if you get children like mine in your corner, and if you've got friends like everybody who voted for me, cheered for me, loved me, thank you.

Thank you,' she concluded.\n\nDespite giving the thumbs up and 'breaking' character, Kimmel continued to be committed to the bit, with Arnett even seen dragging Kimmel backstage when the show cut to commercial.\n\nTHR's Chris Gardner tweeted a video from the Microsoft Theater during the commercial break, adding, 'Jimmy Kimmel fully committed to that bit! Will Arnett dragged him out to present and once the show cut to commercial, he dragged him offstage too.'\n\nFans were quite upset that Kimmel continued to lay on the floor and steal Brunson's moment, with many taking to social media to express their frustration.\n\nPhil Lewis stated, 'Jimmy Kimmel should have left the stage during Quinta's speech. Highly disrespectful.'\n\n@SeanStanglandDH said, 'So Jimmy Kimmel is really gonna upstage her speech by laying on the floor in front of her? Like what the f***?'\n\n@Basic_Hollywood added, 'I must say this is the first time Jimmy Kimmel has actually pissed me off. So rude and inconsiderate to still be laying there like an absolute idiot. Can't let Quinta have her moment? Really? Guess he's just another cocky attention-seeking narcissist.'\n\nAbbott Elementary follows a group of teachers brought together in one of the worst public schools in the country, simply because they love teaching.\n\nJean Smart was a standout as she won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Hacks.\n\nThis was the fifth Primetime Emmy Awards win for the 71-year-old actress as she bested Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Kaley Cuoco (The Flight Attendant), Elle Fanning (The Great), and Issa Rae (Insecure).\n\nDuring her acceptance speech, Jean joked that one of her fellow nominees Rachel Brosnahan tried to sabotage her as she said: 'She's very classy, she sent me this box of these unbelievable designer cookies, they're like 5 lbs. each — and I thought that was so nice and classy until I realized that she was hoping that I wouldn't be able to fit into a single dress in Hollywood. Thanks anyway.'\n\nHacks explores a dark mentorship that forms between Deborah Vance, a legendary Las Vegas comedian, and an entitled, outcast 25-year-old.\n\nAmanda Seyfried was also a big winner as she earned Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her role in The Dropout.\n\nThe 36-year-old actress had tears running down her face as she accepted the honor for her portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes who founded Theranos in the based on a true story miniseries which documented the disgraced biotechnology company.\n\nShe shed light on the countdown clock which appeared for each acceptance speech as she said: 'This is a really nice feeling, counting me down, it's a really nice feeling. I thank the television academy and thanks for recognizing me among these amazing actors and the creator of the show, all the best Michael Showalter.'\n\nSeyfried earned the prize over: Toni Collette (The Staircase), Julia Garner (Inventing Anna), Lily James (Pam and Tommy), Sarah Paulson (Impeachment: American Crime Story), and Margaret Qualley (Maid).\n\nLizzo was in disbelief as she won Best Competition Program for her Amazon Prime Video show Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls.\n\nThe 34-year-old star's - born Melissa Viviane Jefferson - show beat out an impressive field including The Amazing Race (CBS), Nailed It! (Netflix), RuPaul’s Drag Race (VH1), Top Chef (Bravo), and The Voice (NBC).\n\nShe said: 'I want to say thank you to the Emmys and the Emmy voters, first I'm very emotional [ crying ] And the trophy is nice but my emotion is for these people who are on the stage with me the stories that they shared they're not that unique. They just don't get the platform telling stories. Let's just tell more stories.\n\n'When I was a little girl, all I wanted to see was me in the media. Someone fat like me, black like me, beautiful like me. If I could go back and tell little Lizzo something, I would be like, you're going to see that person but b****, it's going to have to be you.\n\n'Where are my big girls come one year ago, one year ago, these women were filming this television show that would change their lives forever they are Emmy award winning superstars who are going on a world tour make some noise for my big girls. I love you so much oh, my god god bless y'all. This is for the big girls.'\n\nLizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls is an American reality television series in which 13 women compete to be dancers for singer Lizzo, who also hosts the show.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Michael Keaton kicked off the show as he took home Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his work in Dopesick.\n\nThe 71-year-old veteran actor beat out an impressive field including: Colin Firth (The Staircase), Andrew Garfield (Under the Banner of Heaven). Oscar Isaac (Scenes From a Marriage), Himesh Patel (Station Eleven), and Sebastian Stan (Pam and Tommy).\n\nKeaton got emotional as he thanked his family for their support throughout the years and said: 'When I was a little, little kid, very small, my dad wins something at a raffle, and he brings it home and it's a little black and white TV, literally about that big.\n\n'And we kind of lived out in the country. And sometimes people, neighbors would come down and actually watch it when I saw this thing, this was my face from age maybe 5 to 10 and I could not take my eyes off it, it was magic and I watched all of the cowboy shows and especially the comedies, the gangster shows I fell in love with it and I would go and I would reenact these scenes or create my own scenes.\n\n'My parents and brothers and sisters would watch me out the window and to this day, they were never demeaning, they were never dismissive they never looked down upon it they never made fun of me. In fact that would ask me to reenact scenes for them. My folks weren't exactly patrons of the arts.\n\n'They weren't patrons of anything, frankly. I want to thank them I want to just thank all those people in my family for never making me feel foolish, because I went on to do that several times myself and that's the thing about feeling foolish and making a fool of yourself and making there's huge power and merit in that and I'm glad I made a fool of myself over and over and over again.'\n\nIn Dopesick, Keaton played the role of a rural doctor named Dr. Samuel Finnix who eventually found himself addicted to drugs.\n\nJulia Garner triumphed as she earned Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role in Ozark.\n\nThe 28-year-old actress beat out Patricia Arquette (Severance), Jung Ho-yeon (Squid Game), Christina Ricci (Yellowjackets), Rhea Seehorn (Better Call Saul), J.

It's so specialand you can see that those dresses are made with love. And Sharon Long, who actually won an Emmy last week for our show The Great. Once I got nominated, I thought, \"Wouldn't it be amazing if she designed my dress?\"' she said via People.\n\n'I'm filming season three right now, so we would have fittings after work and Katherine Shaw - she's the seamstress who has all of Catherine the Great's clothes on the show's season two and now three. She handmade this dress, she's the seamstress and cutter and Sharon designed it,' she added.\n\nThe 24-year-old stunning star sported a faux short hairstyle, channeling old Hollywood style.\n\nAmanda Seyfried, 36, chose a pink mesh Armani Prive gown featuring a sheer lace accent along the neckline; the Mean Girls star pulled her hair back into a chic low bun with pink lipstick on her pout.\n\nShe arrived with her husband Thomas Sadoski, who wore a suit by Emporio Armani.\n\nBritish beauty Lily James stunned in a skintight gold Versace gown that highlighted her slim figure; the 33-year-old actress rocked copper hued tresses.\n\nChrissy Teigen showcased her growing baby bump in a colorful sheer Naeem Khan dress featuring pink, black and fuchsia tones with see-through accents.\n\nThe 36-year-old brunette paired the long-sleeved floor-length number with wavy loose tresses, pink nails and and hot pink clutch.\n\nChrissy and husband John Legend, who announced her pregnancy in early August, sweetly posed together on the red carpet as he cradled her midsection.\n\nKerry Washington sported a one-shoulder Elie Saab gown with flower embellishments along one shoulder and one hip; the dress had a thigh-grazing skirt with a train behind her.\n\nThe actress paired the chic frock with black tights and heels, adding a delicate diamond necklace and coordinating earrings. The jewels are from Bulgari.\n\nAlexandra Daddario, 36, posed with her husband Andrew Form, 53; the couple made their red carpet debut as husband and wife at the Emmys on Monday.\n\nThey tied the knot in June 2022, almost one year after they got engaged. The lovebirds wed in New Orleans at Preservation Hall.\n\nThe actress looked lovely in a cream colored one-shoulder Dior haute Couture gown that had a sheer skirt, revealing shorts beneath; she wore her short hair sleek and loose around her with red lipstick on her pout.\n\nSarah Niles, Britt Lower and Christina Ricci opted for gold or bronzed frocks for the awards ceremony.
