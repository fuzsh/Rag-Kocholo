This time, the stakes have been raised. The participants are going to the most desperate and dangerous corners of the world, and they are all high-profile Australians who represent different – often opposing – sides of the asylum-seeker debate.\n\nTELENOVELA\n\nSide by Side\n\nTV Globo\n\nBrazil\n\nLaura and Isabel are two women from different social classes. One’s parents are former aristocrats, while the other’s are former slaves. The two families developed a solid friendship. Laura and Isabel fall in love with two young idealists, Edgar and Zé Maria.
