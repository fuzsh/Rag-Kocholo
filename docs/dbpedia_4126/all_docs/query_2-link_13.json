        "text": "The Primetime Emmy Award is an American award bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. The award categories are divided into three classes: the regular Primetime Emmy Awards, the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards to honor technical and other similar behind-the-scenes achievements, and the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards for recognizing significant contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television. First given out in 1949, the award was originally referred to as simply the \"Emmy Award\" until the International Emmy Award and the Daytime Emmy Award were created in the early 1970s to expand the Emmy to other sectors of the television industry.\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards generally air every September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season. Since 1995, the Emmys have been broadcast in rotation among the four major networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC), each network taking turns to air the ceremony every four years. The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC (such as in 2006, 2010, and 2014), so that it does not conflict with NBC's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games (due to another conflict, this time with the MTV Video Music Awards, the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday). The 2018 ceremony, broadcast by NBC, was moved back to September and aired on a Monday.\n\nThe name \"Emmy\" comes from the nickname \"Immy,\" used to describe the image-orthicon camera tube that was a significant 1940s technical breakthrough in capturing images for television. Because the statue features a female figure holding an electron, the name \"Immy\" was feminized to \"Emmy.\"\n\nThe Emmys are considered the television equivalent to the Academy Awards (for film), Grammy Awards (for music), and Tony Awards (for stage).\n\nRules[]\n\nAmong the Primetime Emmy Award rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between June 1 and May 31 of any given year. In order to be considered a national primetime show, the program must air between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., and to at least 50 percent of the country. A show that enters into the Primetime Emmy Awards cannot also be entered into the Daytime Emmy Awards or any other national Emmy competition. For shows in syndication, whose air times vary between media markets, they can either be entered in the Daytime or Primetime Emmy Awards (provided they still reach the 50 percent national reach), but not in both. For game shows that reach the 50 percent threshold, they can be entered into the Daytime Emmy Awards if they normally air before 8 p.m (including the former \"access hour\" from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.); otherwise, they are only eligible for the Primetime Emmy Awards. For web television programs, they must be available for downloading or streaming to more than 50 percent of the country, and like shows in syndication they can only enter in one of the national Emmy competitions.\n\nShows that are offered for pre-sale to consumers, whether on home video devices or via the Web, are ineligible if the pre-sale period starts more than 7 days before the show's initial airing. Also, a show that receives what the Academy calls a \"general theatrical release\" before its first airing (either via television or the Internet) is ineligible. The definition of this phrase excludes limited releases for the specific purpose of award qualification, such as screenings at film festivals or the one-week releases in Los Angeles (and, for documentaries, New York City as well) required for Oscar eligibility.\n\nEntries must be submitted by the end of April, even if a show is not scheduled to originally air until the following month when the eligibility period ends in May. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For most series categories, any six episodes that originally aired during the eligibility period must be submitted (programs that were cancelled before airing their sixth episode are thus ineligible). For most individual achievement categories, only one episode is required to be submitted; if an episode is a two-parter, both parts may be included on the submitted DVD.\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to Academy members in June. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting poll to determine the winners is held in August, and is done by judging panels. In June, the Academy solicits volunteers among its active members to serve on these panels. All active members may serve on the program panels; otherwise they are restricted to those categories within their own branch.\n\nCeremonies[]\n\nEdition Date Venue Host(s) Network Most awards 1st January 25, 1949 Hollywood Athletic Club, Los Angeles, California Walter O'Keefe KFI Pantomine Quiz (1) 2nd January 27, 1950 Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California Bill Welsh Crusade in Europe, The Ed Wynn Show, Texaco Star Theatre and Time for Beany (1 each) 3rd January 23, 1951 Earl Warren KLAC (DuMont) The Alan Young Show, Campus Chorus and Orchestra, City at Night, KFI-TV University, KTLA Newsreel, Los Angeles Rams Football, Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, Time for Beany and Truth or Consequences (1 each) 4th February 18, 1952 Cocoanut Grove, Los Angeles, California Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz KECA (ABC) The Red Skeleton Show, Studio One and Your Show of Shows (1 each) 5th February 5, 1953 Hotel Statler, Los Angeles, California Art Linkletter KLAC (DuMont) Dragnet, I Love Lucy, Robert Montgomery Presents, See It Now, Time for Beany, What's My Line and Your Show of Shows (1 each) 6th February 11, 1954 Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, California Ed Sullivan KHJ I Love Lucy and The United States Steel Hour (2 each) 7th March 7, 1955 Moulin Rouge Nightclub, Los Angeles, California Steve Allen and Dave Garroway NBC Studio One (3) 8th March 17, 1956 Pan-Pacific Auditorium, Los Angeles, California Art Linkletter and Danny Thomas The Phil Silvers Show and Producers' Showcase (4 each) 9th March 16, 1957 NBC Studios, Burbank, California Desi Arnaz Caesar's Hour and Playhouse 90 (5 each) 10th April 15, 1958 Cocoanut Grove, Los Angeles, California Phil Silvers and Danny Thomas Playhouse 90 (4) 11th May 6, 1959 Moulin Rouge Nightclub, Los Angeles, California Raymond Burr An Evening with Fred Astaire (5) 12th June 20, 1960 NBC Studios, Burbank, California Fred Astaire The Jack Benny Program and The Moon and Sixpence (2 each) 13th May 16, 1961 Moulin Rouge Nightclub, Los Angeles, California Joey Bishop and Dick Powell Hallmark Hall of Fame (5) 14th May 22, 1962 Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, California Bob Newhart The Defenders (4) 15th May 26, 1963 Annette Funicello and Don Knotts 16th May 25, 1964 Joey Bishop and E.G.
