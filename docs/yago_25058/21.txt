SOCIETY MELANGE

A very pleasant entertainment under the auspices of Christian Church Sunday School took place at the church edifice, on Armstrong avenue, Monday night, the principal features of the performance being contributed by the "White Buds" - a little mite of a literary society connected with the Sunday school, and presided over by Miss Retta Younger. The program consisted of songs, recitations, reading the little society paper, essays, etc., in which the participants displayed a refreshing enthusiasm, and a childish intelligence that was surprising. The entertainment was largely attended, and in every respect successful.

The Sunday Gazetteer (April 7, 1889, pg.4) reported that Miss Retta Younger had left that week for Independence, Missouri where she would teach in the public schools. In the summer of 1889 Miss Henrietta spent time in Stillwater, Minnesota, as she wrote a letter dated July 17, 1889 to "My Dear Little White Buds", little girls from her literary society in Denison. The letter was printed in the July 28th issue of The Sunday Gazetteer as it describes the weather and scenery of the area as well as her trip on an excursion boat and the lumber companies in the area.
