        "text": "For other people named Robert Younger, see Robert Younger (disambiguation).\n\nRobert Ewing Younger (October 29, 1853 – September 16, 1889) was an American criminal and outlaw, the younger brother of Cole, Jim and John Younger. He was a member of the James–Younger Gang.\n\nLife[]\n\nBorn in Missouri on October 29, 1853, Robert was the thirteenth of fourteen children born to Henry Washington Younger and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe. During the Civil War his brothers Cole and Jim rode with Quantrill's Raiders. Bob was only 8 when the war broke out in 1861. He saw his father killed by Union soldiers and his home burned to the ground.\n\nAfter the war, his brothers formed the James–Younger Gang with Frank and Jesse James. For ten years the gang robbed banks, trains, and stage coaches across Missouri, Kansas and other nearby states. Bob Younger is believed to have first joined the gang in 1873.\n\nIn September 1876 the gang attempted to rob the First National Bank in Northfield, Minnesota. The citizens included many Union army veterans who fought back effectively, and in the ensuing shootout all three of the Younger brothers were wounded and captured. Bob was wounded in the elbow and later in the chest. Two Northfield citizens were killed in the botched raid.\n\nImprisonment and death[]\n\nBob Younger was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of tuberculosis in prison at Stillwater, Minnesota on September 16, 1889, at the age of 35 years. His body was shipped to Lee's Summit, Missouri where a funeral was held. He was buried in the Lee's Summit Cemetery.\n\nFilm and television portrayal[]\n\nDays of Jesse James (1939) portrayed by Forrest Dillon\n\nBad Men of Missouri (1941) portrayed by Wayne Morris\n\nThe Younger Brothers (1949) portrayed by James Brown\n\nThe Great Missouri Raid (1951) portrayed by Paul Lees\n\nBest of the Badmen (1951) portrayed by Jack Beutel\n\nThe True Story of Jesse James (1957) portrayed by Anthony Ray\n\nBronco (1960) portrayed by Bill Tennant\n\nYoung Jesse James (1960) portrayed by Robert Palmer\n\nThe Legend of Jesse James (1966) portrayed by Tim McIntire\n\nThe Intruders (1970) portrayed by Zalman King\n\nThe Great Northfield Minnesota Raid (1972) portrayed by Matt Clark\n\nPoor Devil (1973) portrayed by Nicholas Georgiade\n\nThe Long Riders (1980) portrayed by Robert Carradine\n\nFrank & Jesse (1995) portrayed by Todd Field\n\nAmerican Outlaws (2001) portrayed by Will McCormack\n\nShootout!
