In writing a preface to the Thirty-sixth Volume of the Lineage Book which will have at least the faithful constituency of Daughters for its readers, I am again aware of the scant material which is herein furnished as record and memorial of the thousand men who gave their services to this country to establish liberty. Each book as it appears is a unit which aspires to present its matter in such a form as to exclude the possibility of a doubt either in inference or statement. It cannot be counted a small enterprise in the field of letters, nor as one scarce worth while, to thus preserve with the true mem- ory of today the memorable things of yesterday. The voice of the past may sound all too indistinct as it comes to us thus through names and dates alone, of heroes and events in which they participated, but even here silence is significant and eloquent when vitalized by imagination. Here we may see these forbears' of ours step out of the pages of history, actual flesh and blood facts with color in their cheeks, with heroic thoughts in their hearts and with swords in their hands, ready to do battle for a belief. While the body of this book is dead enough, the soul of it cannot die so long as we, the descendants of these men and women of the Revolution keep alive in us the spirit that was theirs. The destinies of America today lie within us, to be understood with intelligence, to be accomplished by power. While we reverence all that was great in our past, we are not to linger there, forgetful of our future but as voyagers in a new land of promise, know our insignia as duty and our condition of existence, action ! Then may be it told of us as in the Story of Sigurd. \"Lo, now thou hast sung of thy Fathers, but men shall sing of thee, and therewith shall our house be remembered and great shall our glory be.\" Mary Cooley Bassett, Historian General. ■y Google , Google ILLUSTRATIONS. , Google , Google ILLUSTRATIONS.
