        "text": "The James-Younger Gang\n\nJames and Younger Trial\n\nThe picture on the left is a younger Cole Younger.\n\nCole Younger (Confederate Guerrilla (Outlaw))\n\nThomas Coleman \"Cole\" Younger\n\nThomas Coleman \"Cole\" Younger (January 15, 1844 - March 21, 1916) was an American Confederate guerrilla during the American Civil War and later a notable outlaw with the James-Younger gang. He was the elder brother of Jim, John and Bob Younger.\n\nBirth\n\nThomas Coleman \"Cole\" Younger, born on 15 January 1844, and was a son of Henry Washington Younger, a prosperous farmer from Greenwood, Missouri and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe, daughter of a prominent Jackson County farmer. Cole was the seventh of 14 children.\n\nCivil War\n\nDuring the American Civil War, savage guerrilla warfare wracked Missouri. On July 20, 1862, Henry Younger, who reportedly was pro-Union, was killed by a detachment of Union militiamen whose Captain Walley was said to have been soundly beaten by Cole for a remark he had made to Cole's sister. Walley was a married man at the time and the Younger daughter refused his advances. The killing of his father, by Walley and his soldiers, is believed to have been what drove Cole Younger to become a pro-Confederate soldier. (He was already a guerrilla under Quantrill.) The fighting in Missouri during the Civil War was largely between pro-Union and pro-Confederate Missourians, though the bushwhackers held special hatred for the Union troops from Kansas who frequently crossed the border and earned a reputation for ruthlessness. Younger joined the notorious bushwhacker leader William Clarke Quantrill in a raid on August 21, 1863, taking part in the slaughter of some 200 men and boys at Lawrence, Kansas, which the guerrillas looted and burned. No women were harmed in this raid.\n\nThe Missouri Bushwackers ventured into Kansas in retaliation as Walley and his men caused a two-story building located between 14th and 15th streets on Grand Avenue to collapse and kill nearly 25 women who were in custody there for providing assistance to Missouri bushwackers in some earlier raids into Kansas. Two of these were cousins, and three were Cole's sisters. The first story of the building was a grocery store but the grocer managed to get all of his inventory out of the place just before it collapsed.\n\nYounger later claimed he left the bushwhacker ranks to enlist in the Confederate Army, and was sent to California on a recruiting mission. He returned after the Southern defeat to find Missouri under the rule of a militant faction of Unionists, the Radicals, who soon took over the regular Republican Party in the state. In the closing days of the war, the Radicals pushed through a new state constitution that barred Confederate sympathizers from voting, serving on juries, holding public office, preaching the gospel, or carrying out any number of public roles. The constitution also freed the slaves ahead of the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It enacted a number of reforms, but the restrictions on former Confederates proved divisive.\n\nBandit Career\n\nMost of the former bushwhackers returned to peaceful lives. Many left Missouri for friendlier places, particularly Kentucky, where many had relatives. Most of their leaders, including Quantrill and \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, had been killed in the war. But a small core of Anderson's men, led by the ruthless Archie Clement, remained together. State authorities believed that Clement planned and led the first daylight peacetime armed bank robbery in U.S. history, holding up the Clay County Savings Association on February 13, 1866. The bank was run by the leading Radicals of Clay County, who had just held a public meeting for their party. The Radical Republican governor posted a reward for Clement, but he and his men conducted further robberies that year. On election day of 1866, Clement led his men into Lexington, Missouri, where they intimidated Radical voters and secured the election of a conservative slate of candidates. A state militia unit entered the town shortly thereafter, and they killed Clement when he resisted arrest.\n\nIt is uncertain when Cole Younger and his brothers joined with this gang. The first mention of his involvement came in 1868, when authorities identified him as a member of a gang who robbed Nimrod Long & Co., a bank in Russellville, Kentucky. Jesse and Frank James were also suspected of taking part in that robbery, though Jesse was not publicly identified as an outlaw until December 1869, after the robbery of a bank in Gallatin, Missouri, and the murder of the cashier, John W. Sheets. By that time, the more senior members of Clement's gang had been killed, captured, or quit, and its core thereafter consisted of the James and Younger brothers.\n\nWitnesses repeatedly gave identifications that matched Cole Younger in robberies carried out over the next few years, as the outlaws robbed banks and stagecoaches in Missouri and Kentucky. On July 21, 1873, they turned to train robbery, derailing a locomotive and looting the express car on the Rock Island Railroad in Adair, Iowa. Younger and his brothers were also suspects in hold-ups of stage coaches, banks, and trains in Missouri, Kentucky, Kansas, and West Virginia.\n\nFollowing the robbery of the Iron Mountain Railroad at Gad's Hill, Missouri, in 1874, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency began to pursue the James and Younger brothers. Two agents (Louis J. Lull and John Boyle) engaged John and Jim Younger in a gunfight on a Missouri road on March 17, 1874; Boyle fled the scene, and both John Younger and Lull were killed. Simultaneously, another agent who pursued the James brothers was abducted and later found dead alongside a rural road in Jackson County, Missouri.\n\nYounger families in states changed their last names because people would associate them as the gangsters family and changed it to Jungers.\n\nThe James and Younger brothers survived for so many years, in contrast to most Western outlaws, because of their strong support among former Confederates. Jesse James became the public face of the gang, appealing to the public in letters to the press (even press releases left behind at robberies), claiming to be the victim of vindictive Radical Republicans. The gang, and Jesse James in particular, became a major electoral campaign issue, as pro-Southern Democrats defended the outlaws and Republicans attacked them.\n\nDownfall of the Gang\n\nOn September 7, 1876, the James-Younger gang attempted to rob a bank in Northfield, Minnesota. Cole Younger and his brother Bob both later said that they selected the bank because of its connection to two former Union generals and Radical Republican politicians, Benjamin Butler and Adelbert Ames. Three of the outlaws entered the bank, as the remaining five, led by Cole Younger, remained on the street to provide cover. The crime soon went awry, however, when the townspeople sent up the alarm and ran for their guns. Younger and his brothers began to fire in the air to clear the streets, but the townspeople (shooting from under cover, through windows and around the corners of buildings) opened a deadly fusillade, killing gang members Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell and badly wounding Bob Younger through the elbow. The outlaws killed two townspeople, including the acting cashier of the bank, and fled empty-handed. As hundreds of Minnesotans formed posses to pursue the fleeing gang, the outlaws separated. The James brothers made it back to Missouri, but the three Youngers (Cole, Bob, and Jim) did not. They and another gang member, Charlie Pitts, waged a gun battle with a local posse in a wooded ravine along the Watonwan River west of Madelia, Minnesota. Pitts was killed, and Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger were badly wounded and captured. Cole, asked about the robbery, responded, \"We tried a desperate game and lost. But we are rough men used to rough ways, and we will abide by the consequences.\"\n\nCole Younger gravesite in Lee's Summit, Missouri .Cole, Jim and Bob pleaded guilty to their crimes to avoid being hanged. They were sentenced to life in prison at the Stillwater Prison at Stillwater on November 18, 1876. Frank and Jesse James fled to Nashville, Tennessee, where they lived peacefully for the next three years. In 1879, Jesse returned to a life of crime, ending in his murder on April 3, 1882, in Saint Joseph, Missouri. Frank James surrendered to Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden on October 4, 1882. Eventually Frank James was acquitted, and lived quietly and peacefully thereafter.\n\nCole Younger gravesite in Lee's Summit, Missouri\n\nBob Younger\n\nBob Younger\n\nBob Younger died in Stillwater prison on September 16, 1889, of tuberculosis. Cole and Jim were paroled on July 10, 1901, with the help of the prison warden. Jim committed suicide in a hotel room in St Paul, Minnesota, over an unrequited love on October 19, 1902. Cole wrote a memoir that portrayed himself as a Confederate avenger more than an outlaw, admitting to only one crime, that at Northfield. He lectured and toured the south with Frank James in a wild west show, The Cole Younger and Frank James Wild West Company in 1903. On August 21, 1912, Cole declared that he had become a Christian and repented of his criminal past.\n\nFrank James died February 18, 1915. A year later, Cole Younger died March 21, 1916, in his home town of Lee's Summit, Missouri, and is buried in the Lee's Summit Historical Cemetery.\n\nJames or Jim Younger\n\nJim Younger (outlaw)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 19 -- James Younger, formerly a member of the notorious James band of outlaws, which infested the Western country a quarter of a century ago, committed suicide to-day by shooting. He left a disjointedly written letter that indicated an unsettled mind. In this he gives as a reason for his act, despondency over continued ill-health and separation from his, friends.
