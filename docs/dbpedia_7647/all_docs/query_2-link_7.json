        "text": "In recent years, however, his political career was tarnished by a series of scandals, reducing his profile and influence.\n\nItaly’s latest general election, which saw his Forza Italia party join Meloni’s governing coalition, marked Berlusconi’s return to the domestic limelight — albeit in a diminished role.\n\nBerlusconi was taken to hospital on Friday for tests related to chronic leukaemia. Following a COVID-19 infection in 2020, he frequently required health assessments and in April spent more than a month in hospital, including in intensive care, with a lung infection linked to his illness.\n\nItalian media on Monday morning reported that Berlusconi had died and a spokesperson for his office confirmed the news.\n\nColleagues and opponents from Italian politics paid tribute to the former premier.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni released a video message, in which she remebered Berlusconi as “above all a fighter.” She said: “He was a man who was never afraid to defend his convictions and it was exactly that courage and that determination that made him one of the most influential men in the history of Italy, that allowed him to impose genuine changes in the world of politics, communication and business..With him we have fought, won and lost many battles.”\n\nFormer Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Twitter: “Silvio Berlusconi made history in this country. Many loved him, many hated him: everyone today must recognize that his impact on political but also economic, sporting and television life was unprecedented … In these hours I carry with me the memories of our meetings, of the many councils, of our agreements, of our clashes. But above all of a phone call in which Silvio, not the President, made me shed a tear when talking about my mother.”\n\nRomano Prodi, another former Italian premier, said Berlusconi “exerted a great influence on the life of our country, affecting not only the institutions, but also the lives of all its people. In our long political confrontation, we have represented different and opposing worlds, but our rivalry never transcended into feelings of enmity on a personal level, maintaining mutual respect.”\n\nMatteo Salvini, Italy’s current interior minister, said Berlusconi was “a great man and a great Italian.”\n\nRead the full obituary here.\n\nBerlusconi amassed vast wealth and power, controlling Italian television channels, buying football clubs, and courting celebrity in his own right. For years, he was the bad boy of European politics, clashing with and offending his counterparts at EU summits, and leading a lurid personal life that got him into trouble with the law.\n\nWhile the notorious “Bunga Bunga” sex parties, held at his villa near Milan, will likely remain a defining feature of his story, he would surely want to be remembered as an international statesman.\n\nBerlusconi often claimed to have cemented the real end of the Cold War by arranging a meeting between Vladimir Putin — who counted him as a dear friend — and U.S. President George W. Bush in Rome.\n\nThe reality is that he will go down in history for gaffes such as calling Barack Obama suntanned, allegedly describing Germany’s former chancellor Angela Merkel as an “unfuckable fat ass.” Episodes like these made him a pariah among European leaders and an object of ridicule in the international media.\n\nIn his final years, Berlusconi sought to reinvent himself and his image was somewhat rehabilitated, in Italy at least. In 2019 he became the oldest member of the European Parliament. In comparison to the dangerous ideals of the populists who had surged across Europe, Berlusconi’s pro-European, pro-NATO stance was reassuring to the likes of Merkel.\n\nHis comeback was complete when in 2021 his party returned to government led by the most establishment of figures, Mario Draghi.\n\nBerlusconi’s death throws the future of the Forza Italia political party he founded into uncertainty.\n\nHis children have shown no desire to enter politics, and as a personality-led movement there is no clear succession plan for who will take over.\n\nThe party could quickly fracture into factions, with some members joining Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy and other parts drifting towards centrist parties.\n\nBut it is likely that a part of Forza Italia, which is more moderate than the Brothers of Italy, could be kept alive to help support Meloni’s claim to lead a center-right coalition.\n\nAhead of European elections next year Forza Italia’s other advantage is its membership of the center-right, pro-European EPP party in the European Parliament, and as a potential broker between the EPP and the ECR conservative grouping that Meloni leads.\n\nThis article has been updated with context and reaction."
