        "text": "‘Veronica believes,” said Maria Latella, the biographer of Italy’s First Lady, “her husband is a man who lives still in the 1950s.”\n\nThis may or may not be a bad thing in Italy, where I’ve spent as much time over the last 30 years as I possibly can because Italians seem so ambivalent about the modern world’s arrival. But, for better or worse, it’s a surge of modern irony, psychological nuance, and obsessive media attention that is confronting Italy’s prime minister, threatening the career of one of the richest men and most successful politicians in Europe.\n\nIn the 1950s, Silvio Berlusconi was a cruise-ship crooner. After that he became a real-estate magnate, a media mogul, and then prime minister. Although that’s not quite giving him his due: he isn’t just one more immensely powerful billionaire; rather more impressively, he controls his country’s dominant political party, its primary television networks, and its government. But, after all this, what characterizes him most is his crooner personality: he’s an indefatigable—and cheap—Lothario. A dime-store Sinatra. A type. An Italian stereotype.\n\nHis desires are hardly a secret. He’s a braggart, which is part of his charm—furtive isn’t his style. His wife first caught his eye doing nude stage shows. Her first public letter, written two years ago, was prompted by his voluble declaration that if he weren’t married he would run away to a desert island with one of the women in his Cabinet. This was followed by the publication of telephoto pictures of a seeming bacchanal at Berlusconi’s Sardinian mansion. To him this was less cognitive dissonance than positive demonstration: this 72-year-old man is living the dream and, he says with a stagy wink, the redhead and the blonde, with whom he was walking arm in arm, were just admiring his statues and fountains.\n\nIn a sense, no one was as stunned as Silvio himself by the current nonstop discussion in Italy of his sex life that began with renewed vigor in April when he was spotted at the 18th-birthday party of a young woman in Naples. Indeed, he doesn’t get it. A man who’s been at one with popular culture as exploiter and its consummate expression is now its joke.\n\nPopular culture in Italy is TV.\n\nThere are three private networks, which Berlusconi owns and controls, and three state networks, which, as prime minister, he also controls. People in Italy watch television the way people elsewhere used to before satellite and cable and the Internet: the country sits in front of the TV at the appointed hour.\n\nThe attractiveness of that market is a reason why Berlusconi blames his current problems not just on his wife, and the few outlets of the Italian press he doesn’t own, but also on Rupert Murdoch.\n\nAs it happens, Berlusconi is the only person I’ve ever heard Murdoch talk about without reservation. This makes sense. Berlusconi has accomplished the thing Murdoch has most tried to accomplish: he’s monopolized his nation’s media and politics. And yet, Berlusconi may have a point about Murdoch’s having it in for him.\n\nThe Murdoch satellite-and-pay-television system, Sky Italia, has grown widely in popularity in Italy since Murdoch launched it, in 2003. Murdoch would like much more of this market. “Murdoch’s competition would be a disaster for Berlusconi,” says Marco Travaglio, a journalist who became famous, during the 2001 election, for his reports on the public television network RAI about the Berlusconi money trail—from which he was promptly banned when Berlusconi was re-elected. “It would destroy the very system upon which Berlusconi has built his fortune and power base.”\n\nHence, the Berlusconi government slapped a special 20 percent tax on Sky Italia. Which is why the prime minister is now saying the Murdoch media is out to get him. And perhaps why, at a particularly dicey moment for the P.M. early in the summer—just as, along with his other girl problems, several more girls were saying he’d paid for their attentions—Murdoch had a big and well-publicized dinner in Milan where he announced an expansion of Sky.\n\n“In this context,” says Alexander Stille, the author of a book about Berlusconi, “Murdoch is like Paul Revere.”\n\nBut back to sex. The cheap Lothario grows up to be the lascivious producer with one of history’s most active casting couches. It’s his Lothario values, as much as his political wiles, that make him. Here’s his secret: he puts big-bosomed girls on TV. So many girls that they have come, in Italy, to represent, like courtesans of another era, almost a social class: the veline.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the veline—a term that came to mean young girls with no talent except the desire to be on television—redefined popular culture. Before Berlusconi and the veline, Italian television, dominated by the twin orthodoxies of Catholicism and Communism, looked monochromatically clerical and dogmatic: heavyset men, smoking cigarettes, with lots of hair coming out of their ears and noses. In a country that proscribed private national television networks, Berlusconi tricked the system by assembling in the early 80s a patchwork of local stations that all, at slightly staggered times, broadcast the same thing. There were few situations on Berlusconi television in which a hostess was not cheerfully hovering nearby. His wife, Veronica Lario, whom he met in 1980, when she was 23 and he was a 43-year-old married man with two children, was a velina.\n\nThe veline set the fashions, the veline married soccer stars, the veline made Berlusconi rich and famous. If this was a dirty old man’s dream, it was also a housewife’s fantasy. When Ezio Mauro, the editor in chief of the Roman newspaper La Repubblica, Berlusconi’s most ardent foe, first met him, in the early 90s, Berlusconi told him of his incipient political dreams: “With the housewives I freed I could become prime minister,” a prospect that Mauro then rated to be as likely as Berlusconi’s playing for the American N.F.L.\n\nWhen, in 1993, Berlusconi started a new political party and became prime minister, the veline followed him. It has become a commonplace to rise in the ranks of veline and then get elected to high office.\n\nBerlusconi did not seem, at this point, old-fashioned. His election was made possible because the old order collapsed in the early 90s in a great corruption scandal. Berlusconi, although closely aligned with the socialist leader Bettino Craxi—who fled the country shortly before conviction on corruption charges—was not a politician. Benefiting from Craxi’s influence and financial ties, he had become one of the most successful businessmen in the nation—which was the platform he ran on. He was the businessman who could make the trains run on time. He was, people said, with horror and awe, like an American politician. The future had come to Italy.\n\nBut as Italy began to transform, Berlusconi did not. He went into politics not least of all to protect the extra-legal television business he’d managed to build in spite of the regulated market. And then he expanded the uses of politics so that, first and foremost, politics became about protecting him and his interests.\n\nLast year, in one of the more precarious legal difficulties the prime minister has faced (and he has faced many), the Italian courts convicted a British lawyer and businessman, David Mills, of taking bribes from Berlusconi in exchange for giving false testimony in yet another investigation of alleged Berlusconi corruption. The Mills conviction seemed to presage Berlusconi’s own inevitable conviction. Berlusconi’s solution: a law providing that the top four figures in the Italian government, including the prime minister, the president, and the leaders of Parliament, could not face prosecution until they’d left office. It is Berlusconi’s well-known intention to have himself appointed president for a seven-year term after he completes his term as prime minister.\n\nThen there’s the wiretap law. Because the prime minister is a study in indiscretion, much of the evidence in the various investigations that threaten him comes from conversations picked up in wiretaps authorized by judges overseeing the many inquiries. But in an inversion of standard Big Brother behavior, Italy has just passed a tough anti-wiretap law—to protect the prime minister from being overheard.\n\nAn effect of this creation of a system in which he is beyond challenge or competition is that, as the world changes, Berlusconi hasn’t had to change very much. He can do what he wants and become ever more what he is. Which, as it happens, can make you seem rather strange.\n\nHis wife changes, though. Veronica is the poor girl from Bologna who became a performer, and then married the boss and settled into a fully indulged life where she raised her three children and, quite unexpectedly, read books. “She raised her children and read philosophy and literature,” says Maria Lattella. “Her husband was a man the way Italian men used to be. He has his life in Rome and then he comes home on Saturday nights and expects to have his life at home.”\n\nVeronica lived in Milan and Silvio in Rome, where he engaged in a dizzying life of political and sexual ambition, including a hair transplant and, reportedly, a face-lift and liposuction. Jacques Chirac, the former French president, recently recounted his memories of trips to Berlusconi villas: “This bidet,” Chirac recalled Berlusconi saying as he offered a tour of his bathroom, “you have no idea how many pairs of buttocks it has received!”\n\nShortly after the news of Berlusconi’s visit to the 18-year-old’s birthday party in Naples broke—while the girl, Noemi Letizia, and her family apparently re-arranged their stories and went silent—her former boyfriend explained the details. Seeking, like many teenage Italian girls, a television career, Noemi assembled her portfolio and sent it to a contact at a modeling agency in Rome, where it came into the hands of a favorite Berlusconi news anchor, Emilio Fede, who put it into the hands of the prime minister, who promptly picked up the phone and personally called Noemi—a name now as famous in Italy as Monica.\n\nBerlusconi arrived for Noemi’s birthday party at an un-prime-minister-like venue, a discotheque outside of Naples, just as another bit of bad press was kicking up: the prime minister’s list of likely nominees for Italy’s seats in the European Parliament included a full slate of veline. The controversy over his list of dubiously qualified women was enhanced by the suspicious nature of his visit to the birthday party in Naples, made much more suspicious by his inability to explain why he would be at an 18-year-old’s birthday party at all. It did not get any better when Noemi said she called the prime minister “Daddy,” and explained that she often visited him in Rome or Milan and sang karaoke duets with him, or when she joked that she did not know if she would get a job on television or in Parliament.\n\nFor Veronica it posed issues beyond the personal: “I have come to wonder what kind of country we live in.” The point was not only that her husband had embarrassed her but that, as a further moral issue, he was, in her view, according to Latella, “not an example of a man who respected women.”\n\nShortly after her husband’s trip to Naples, Veronica told La Repubblica and the Turin newspaper La Stampa that her husband was a man who went with “minors” and that she wanted a divorce.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be an Italian who’s not asking how Berlusconi came to be and how he continues. This has become the great issue of national character: Why do Italians like Silvio?\n\nThe most obvious explanation for why he survives and thrives is that he owns the media. While the international press hammered him, and his nemesis, La Repubblica, repeatedly published the same 10 questions he continued to refuse to answer about his relationship with Noemi, and even after other women had come forward to say they had been paid to entertain the P.M., Italian television barely broached the subject.\n\nThen there is the issue of the Italian character. The Italians reach for, instead of resist, their own stereotypes. Berlusconi is their metaphor. You understand Berlusconi, you understand yourself. A Berlusconi-employed journalist—a fate whose ironies make for great comedy and bitterness—explains, “Italians need someone like him because he is just like them. Everybody has a mistress. Everybody cheats on taxes. Everybody does something illegal because it’s impossible to live legally. Also, we love authoritarians. We need a strong man. If not Mussolini, well, then someone like Mussolini.”\n\nThen, perhaps most confoundingly, it may be that he is a very good politician. That is, he does what people want: lower taxes (he says he lowered them; the opposition says he’s raised them) and talk tough on immigration; deal with a garbage pileup in Naples; make ritualistic bows to the Catholic Church while ignoring it altogether (his two marriages and gazillions of girls); rush to the scene of the recent earthquake in central Italy and demonstratively kiss old ladies and joke with the men (“What are you doing up there [on the scaffolding],” he shouted to some workers on one of his earthquake-inspection tours. “And how come there are no women? Are you all gay? Next time I’ll bring you a few girls, the veline ... but not minors, all over 18”); and, always, divide the elite from the greater populace, with whom he takes pains to identify (in fact, with whom he may naturally identify).\n\nOn a sunny morning in Rome in June, Berlusconi sent his lawyer to explain the situation to me. Niccolò Ghedini, a tall, thin man with a long, scary face—who is not just Berlusconi’s personal lawyer but among the most powerful members of the Italian Parliament—is famous for his daily television defense of the prime minister. It is a defense that seems to mesmerize the Italians: denying what can’t be denied in arguments so shamelessly self-serving that they win by sheer bravura alone.\n\n“You must understand the character of Mr. Berlusconi is very complicated,” Ghedini says slowly through a translator. “It provokes enthusiasm and antipathy. But great enthusiasm and small antipathy. So the allegations against him are flawed because they are against him. This is anti-Berlusconi-ism.”\n\n“Veronica,” says Ghedini with a big sigh. “What does she want? Attention. He would like to reconciliate. He still loves his wife. He was hit very hard by her request for a separation. Perhaps if he was able to involve his wife more in his life. But this is not so easy, because he is very busy and also a man with a strong character.”\n\nBig sigh: “Noemi-gate. . . . Silvio Berlusconi is a man who likes to be among people: if he enters a hall with a thousand people, he asks, ‘Where are the others?’ His strength and charisma come from being among the common people. He is so popular because he remains a simple person. There is nothing at all strange here. It is very straightforward and innocent. He has a long relationship with her family. And if there are other reports, well, in the same matters of the same family when there is a long relationship, it is common for people to remember things differently.”\n\nAnother big sigh: “The Mills case and the protection from prosecution of our top officials. . . . They say that Mills was given money to not say certain things at the trial. But you see he is now the main witness, so that must be proof that he was not given the money. As for our top officials. In Italy, there is a constitutional right to participate in a trial, but if you are the prime minister, with the responsibility for running the country, you could not have the time to participate. So this is a way to protect the rights of the prime minister.”\n\nHis biggest sigh yet: “The press . . . It is the responsibility of the press to criticize the government. But of course this criticism has to be based on the truth. And the press has written things totally different from the situation, from the context, which cannot be tolerated, you understand.”\n\nThe very basis of Berlusconi’s survival may be that he is someone who does not have to be taken seriously. The people who take him seriously seem to suffer in the contrast.\n\nMarco Travaglio, who was banned from RAI because of his criticism of Berlusconi, has built a significant Internet following with his detailed reports about the prime minister. But when I spoke with him I couldn’t help but feel that he was investing a disproportionate amount of time and significance not just in such a clownish, even childish man but also in an attempt to prove the obvious. Where the funding for Berlusconi’s empire came from is one of Travaglio’s obsessions. And while that might be a meaningful, even epochal question, it also seems somehow overly literal. Of course Mr. B. is suspect. Everybody knows that!"
