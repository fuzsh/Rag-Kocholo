        "text": "Late former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was honored by a national day of mourning on Wednesday, as his casket was brought into Milan's Duomo cathedral for a state funeral.\n\nAlthough state funerals have been accorded to former premiers in the past, it is the first time a national day of mourning has been held for an ex-leader in Italy.\n\nThe decision was taken by a government that contains members of the late premier's former party, Forza Italia, and has raised some controversy in view of Berlusconi's scandal-ridden political career and doubtful legacy.\n\nMilan's Archbishop Mario Delpini did not shy away from Berlusconi's complicated legacy in his eulogy on Wednesday, saying there were \"those who applaud him and those who detest him.\"\n\n\"But in this moment of farewell and prayer, what can we say about Silvio Berlusconi? He has been a man: a desire for life, a desire for love, a desire for joy,\" Delpini said. \"He is a man and now he meets God.\"\n\nTens of thousands of people gathered outside the Duomo to say goodbye to Berlusconi, as his flower-draped casket was hoisted out of the hearse and into the cathedral.\n\nHis children and companion, along with many Italian political figures were in attendance.\n\nBerlusconi died on Monday aged 86. Milan is the the city where he made his billions as a media mogul before entering politics in 1994.\n\nMuch criticism\n\nAlthough the funeral was attended by several thousand people, including top political leaders and foreign dignitaries, among them Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, some Italian opposition politicians refused to attend the service.\n\nThey include former Premier Giuseppe Conte. Another lawmaker, former center-left minister Rosy Bindi, who was often the butt of sexual jibes by Berlusconi, has called the state honors an \"inappropriate sanctification.\"\n\nBindi said the day of mourning was \"disrespectful towards the majority\" of Italians who were opposed to Berlusconi and his politics.\n\nJournalist Marco Travaglio, an outspoken critic of Berlusconi who co-founded the daily Il Fatto Quotidiano, was even more explicit in his disapproval.\n\n\"Berlusconi split Italy, he insulted adversaries for 30 years, he criminalized the magistrates and he didn't recognize laws. What are we talking about?'' Travaglio told private TV station La7 TV on Monday.\n\nDetractors of Berusconi cite conflicts of interest relating to his media empire, the many trials he faced, mostly for business dealings, revelations of sex-fueled \"bunga-bunga\" parties at his villa near Milan and his close friendship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nLavish praise\n\nHowever, Lucia Adiele, a member of Berlusconi's Forza Italia, said she considered herself fortunate to have met him and traveled nearly 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) to bid farewell.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to be a part of Forza Italia for 18 years,\" she told Reuters TV. \"The least I could do was to be here and say goodbye for the last time.\"\n\nThere were also full-page newspaper advertisements from his family and by his media company MFE paying tribute to Berlusconi.\n\nThe message from his five children read, \"Sweetest Dad, Thank you for your life, Thank you for your love, You will always live inside us.\"\n\nFans of Berlusconi refer to his years in power as periods that stabilized the country after a series of short-lived governments and also admired him for his flamboyance and irreverence, often toward other global leaders.\n\nOther leading figures who attended Berlusconi's funeral are EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani.\n\ntj/jcg (Reuters, AP)"
