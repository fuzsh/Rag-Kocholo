His media empire helped catapult him into the political arena,first coming into office in 1994 and leading four governments until 2011.\n\nBerlusconi's political career was not without controversy. He faced numerous legal battles and scandals throughout his tenure, including charges of tax fraud, corruption, and involvement with underage prostitution.\n\nNationalist Party pays tribute\n\nThe Nationalist Party expressed it condolences over the former Italian PMâ€™s death, stating he was a friend of the country.\n\nIt said he led Italy in the years of major political change, and had always expressed his support for Malta accession to the European Union."
