        "text": "Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi died on Monday at the age of 86 at the San Rafaelle Hospital in Milan.\n\nThe politician and businessman was admitted to the intensive care unit last Friday due to a lung infection and Berlusconi's health worsened in recent days.\n\nSeveral members of his family had travelled to the centre on Monday morning, reported AdnKronos news agency.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi's cause of death\n\nBerlusconi's health had worsened in recent months and concern began to grow, especially as he had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n\nThis is a form of blood cancer that can occur mainly in people over 60, and doctors said at the time that he was undergoing \"specialised cytoreductive treatment\" and chemotherapy.\n\nOver the years, Berlusconi has been hospitalised on several occasions. On one occasion he had a pacemaker implanted, on another he was admitted for COVID-19 and on one of the most recent occasions, in January 2022, he was admitted for a urinary tract infection.\n\nThis weekend the media tycoon was scheduled to meet at his mansion in Arcore with the senior members of his party, the conservative Forza Italia, part of the current coalition government led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi's career\n\nBerlusconi, founder of right-wing political party Forza Italia, has served several times as head of government and in the last elections had returned to elected office as a senator.\n\nBerlusconi's life and career was marred by sex scandals, as well as allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction. He is Italy's longest-serving prime minister in the post-Second World War period."
