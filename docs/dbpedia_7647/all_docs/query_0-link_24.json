        "text": "Italy has held a state funeral for ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, attended by political leaders, his family and a string of ex-girlfriends.\n\nThousands of mourners gathered in Milan's main square to say a final farewell to the one-time cruise singer who led Italy with no prior political experience and built a media empire.\n\nAs Berlusconi's coffin entered the cathedral, they chanted: \"Silvio will always be our president.\"\n\nThere were flags, tears and applause.\n\nThe Archbishop of Milan led the funeral, in a cathedral packed with 2,000 relatives, friends, and allies and rivals from Italian politics and business. Hungarian leader Viktor Orban and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were among the few figures from the world stage.\n\n\"To be happy means to love parties, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to have a sense of humour,\" said Archbishop Mario Delpini in a homily that encapsulated the four-time prime minister's flamboyant life.\n\nBerlusconi was a divisive figure for Italians, and renowned abroad for his crude jokes and so-called bunga-bunga parties.\n\nIn the front row of the cathedral were his five children, who have been catapulted into the limelight, as part of an inevitable succession story.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Berlusconi amassed a vast empire that spanned media, real estate, finance, cinema and sport - as well as a powerful political party that is part of Italy's current government.\n\nHe was one of Italy's richest men. According to Forbes, his business assets are worth about €6bn (£5.15bn).\n\nBut he never publicly indicated who should lead his business empire after his death and there are also big questions over the future of the Forza Italia party he created.\n\nBerlusconi has two children from his first marriage and three from his second. All of them have stakes in Fininvest, his holding company.\n\nThe future of his business interests will likely depend on how he has chosen to distribute the 61% stake he had in Fininvest.\n\nWill there be equal shares for all, or more for the two eldest children, Marina and Pier Silvio, who have held management roles in the empire since the early 1990s?\n\nOther valuable assets are undoubtedly Berlusconi's numerous luxurious villas. They could be tricky to pass on to his offspring in an equal way.\n\nHis Villa San Martino in Arcore, north-east of Milan, covers 3,500 sq m and dates back to the 18th Century. He also has homes at Lake Maggiore, in Rome, Cannes, the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\nThe jewel in Berlusconi's crown of properties is Villa Certosa, a mansion in Sardinia that he bought in the 1970s.\n\nHe hosted world leaders there, from Vladimir Putin to George W. Bush. It has 126 rooms and looks like a theme park - including a fake volcano that erupts lava. Its value is estimated at €259m.\n\nPeople close to the family have described Berlusconi as \"the glue\" who kept his children united.\n\nThere has been no dispute so far over who takes over the empire - that is expected to fall to his oldest child Marina, 56, considered closest of the five to her father.\n\nThe big question is whether that family unity can be maintained now that Berlusconi has gone, and what impact that might have on the future of his business empire.\n\nHis death could prove disastrous for the future of his political party. Can Forza Italia survive without its charismatic creator - or could it fall apart in a matter of months?\n\nHe was the ultimate populist leader, and unsurprisingly, the party he created was entirely shaped around his persona.\n\nHis right-hand man, foreign minister Antonio Tajani, has categorically denied its future is at risk: \"It's unthinkable that the party would disappear.\"\n\nBut Forza Italia's share of the vote had already slipped to 8% in last September's general election.\n\nMany Italians who backed the party did so because they were Berlusconi loyalists and it will be tricky to appoint a successor they will warm to.\n\nIn reality, party members will probably look to the Berlusconi family to make a decision.\n\nWill the two eldest, Marina and Pier Silvio, want to keep investing in their father's political creation, or will they turn off the financial tap and cut their losses?\n\nWithout their financial support, Forza Italia has no chance of surviving. Berlusconi heavily funded his party - reportedly injecting it with nearly €100m.\n\nThere is some speculation that Marina could succeed him as leader, but for now this remains a rumour. She is seen as more of a behind-the-scenes operator.\n\nAnother unknown is Berlusconi's partner Marta Fascina, who is 53 years his junior. She's an MP in his party and has said several times that \"her passion is politics and she grew up with the myth of Silvio Berlusconi\".\n\nBerlusconi's eldest daughter reportedly blocked his plan to marry her last year. So there is a cloud over Ms Fascina's future role in her late partner's party.\n\nPolitical instability looms after Wednesday's day of national mourning.\n\nBerlusconi had health problem for years so it is likely he and his children had thought all of this through.\n\nThey might opt for an easy transition heralded by their eldest sister Marina, rather than get into a succession battle which could go wrong."
