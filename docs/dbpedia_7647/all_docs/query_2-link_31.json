        "text": "Silvio Berlusconi, the boastful billionaire media mogul who was Italy's longest-serving prime minister despite scandals over his sex-fuelled parties and allegations of corruption, has died at the age of 86.\n\nItalian news agency LaPresse reported Berlusconi's death after he was hospitalised on Friday for the second time in months for treatment of chronic leukaemia.\n\nBerlusconi was hospitalised in Milan on April 5 with a lung infection stemming from the disease, according to his personal physician Dr Alberto Zangrillo.\n\nHe also suffered over the years from heart ailments, prostate cancer and was hospitalised for COVID-19 in 2020.\n\nA onetime cruise ship crooner, Berlusconi used his television networks and immense wealth to launch his long political career, inspiring both loyalty and loathing.\n\nTo admirers, the three-time premier was a capable and charismatic statesman who sought to elevate Italy on the world stage.\n\nTo critics, he was a populist who threatened to undermine democracy by wielding political power as a tool to enrich himself and his businesses.\n\nHis Forza Italia political party was a coalition partner with current Premier Giorgia Meloni, a far-right leader who came to power last year, although he held no position in the government.\n\nHis friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin put him at odds with Meloni, a staunch supporter of Ukraine.\n\nOn his 86th birthday, while the war raged, Putin sent Berlusconi best wishes and vodka, and the Italian boasted he returned the favour by sending back Italian wine.\n\nBeloved chef Bill Granger dies\n\nSign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox."
