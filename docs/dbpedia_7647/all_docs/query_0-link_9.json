        "text": "Berlusconi has spent much of the past 30 years embroiled in legal battles. In all, he faced 35 criminal court cases, but only one conviction.\n\n'Ruby' cases\n\nBerlusconi was accused of abuse of office and paying for sex\n\nin 2010 with a minor, nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug, better known in Italy by her stage name, Ruby the Heartstealer.\n\nBerlusconi was initially found guilty in 2013 and sentenced\n\nto seven years in jail, before an appeals court found there was no proof he had known that she was 17 and Italy's top court confirmed his acquittal in 2015.\n\nHe was back in the dock after being accused of bribing witnesses to lie in the original Ruby trial, before being cleared again.\n\nConviction\n\nThe only Berlusconi trial that ended with a final conviction\n\nwas one for tax fraud, false accounting and embezzlement tied to\n\nhis media empire, then called Mediaset.\n\nIn 2013, the top court confirmed Berlusconi's sentence of four years' imprisonment, three of which were covered by a pardon. He completed his sentence as community service from 2014 to 2015.\n\nAcquittals\n\nA total of 10 cases ended with an acquittal.\n\nStatute of limitations and amnesties\n\nA further 10 trials concluded with a decision not to pursue the case, many because the statute of limitations came into force.\n\nThis included a case where Berlusconi was originally found guilty of bribing a senator in 2006 to bring down the then centre-left government.\n\nDropped cases\n\nAnother 10 proceedings ended with a preliminary judge deciding to drop the case without going to trial.\n\nMired in a sex scandal, Silvio Berlusconi held a dinner party at a posh Rome hotel in 2010 to charm reporters - but struggled to play it straight: \"You're all invited to the bunga bunga!\" he told us defiantly.\n\nThen the impish smile. \"But you'd be disappointed.\"\n\nWhen it came to entertainment, Berlusconi - the media mogul-turned-prime minister, his hair slicked back and face orange from a fake tan - rarely disappointed. When it came to governing, he disappointed many parts of his country.\n\nYet upon leaving office a year after that dinner, never to return to power, the Milanese magnate left behind an enduring political legacy - and leadership vacuum - that affects Italy more than a decade later.\n\nRead the full analysis by Alessandra Rizzo here...\n\n\"Gone is the great fighter. Rest in peace, my friend,\" said Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister.\n\nRoberto Mancini, head coach of the Italian national team, said Berlusconi's death \"is a great regret, I think it is for everyone because he was an extraordinary man for sport, also for politics, so today is a very sad day\".\n\nHe was quoted by our Italian partner network, Sky tg24.\n\nRoberto Calderoli, regional affairs minister, said:\n\n\"Today I mourn Silvio, a friend of many moments, of many years together, of many laughs and also of many difficult moments.\n\n\"Today I remember my friend Silvio, I mourn my friend, with a prayer that I know he would appreciate, sending a big hug to his large family, to his children, to all those who loved him like me.\"\n\nTributes are flooding in for the three-time prime minister.\n\nHis death leaves a \"huge void\" because he was a great man, Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto said.\n\n\"I loved him very much. Farewell Silvio.\"\n\nSenator Matthew Renzi said: \"Silvio Berlusconi made history in this country. Many loved him, many hated him: today everyone must recognise that his impact on political life but also on economics, sports and television was unprecedented.\n\n\"Today Italy mourns together to the family, to his loved ones, to his companies, to his party. We will miss you Pres, may the earth be light on you.\"\n\nAC Milan, which Berlusconi formerly owned, posted to Twitter:"
