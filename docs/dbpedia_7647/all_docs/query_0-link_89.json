If the state asks you for more, or much more, then it is a clear abuse against you and then you try to find evasive ways to make you feel coherent to your intimate sense of morality and it doesn't make you feel ethically guilty.\n\nAddressing the commander of the special italian police corp, Guardia di Finanza, whose job is to fight financial fraud and tax evasion in November of 2003, quoted in la Repubblica (17 febbraio 2004)\n\nLet's talk about football and women. … Gerhard, why don't you start?\n\nAt the Brussels summit, turning to the four-times-married German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, at the end of Italy's EU presidency, in December 2003, as quoted in \"In quotes: Berlusconi in his own words\" at BBC News (2 May 2006)\n\nForeign press is usually leftist and describes us differently from what we really are.\n\nSpeech to the association Azzurri nel mondo, Lugano (24 October 2004)\n\nIf the left wing was to rule, the result would be misery, terror and death, like it happens in every place where communism rules.\n\nQuoted in Corriere della Sera (17 January 2005)\n\nThe left has always been on the wrong side. They were against Hitler, but not against Stalin.\n\nQuoted in la Repubblica (3 February 2005)\n\nI used all my playboy skills and courted the Finnish President.\n\nAt the opening of the European Food Authority in Parma (21 June 2005), when asked to explain how Italy managed to get the support of its biggest competitor over the EU Food Authority dispute), as reported in \"Foreign Ministry summons Italian Ambassador over Berlusconi comments\" in Helsingin Sanomat (22 June 2005)\n\nWe must fight against tax evasion but also defend the rights of tax evaders, or companies that make mistakes\n\nAs quoted in \"Did I say This? in The Observer (20 April 2008)\n\nI am the Jesus Christ of politics.

To win you have to score. To have chances you've got to have forwards close to the goal, I appreciated Leonardo a lot but I disagreed with him in how he fielded the team. Ronaldinho must play on the shoulder of the strikers even if he has a tendency to drift left. Ronaldinho has been linked in the media with a move away but Berlusconi was adamant the playmaker was staying. He is the No1 attraction at Milan,\" he said, \"Ronaldinho does not want to leave. I'm sure he is happy to stay.\n\nI would be happy for Gattuso to stay but we are not against people saying they want to leave, We can't exclude [the sale of Huntelaar] even if we are convinced of his qualities as a main striker.\n\n\"'New Milan manager must play two strikers,' says Silvio Berlusconi\", The Guardian (20 July 2010).\n\nThey called me, inviting me to watch L'Infedele. I'm watching a disgusting program, run in a despicable, vile and repulsive way. I've heard false and distorted views, far away from the truth. I've seen a representation of reality which is to the contrary of truth.\n\nOn the TV program L'infedele, called in during the show, reported in \"Berlusconi insults Lerner live: you run a brothel program\", Repubblica (25 January 2011)]\n\nI hope that in Egypt there can be a transition toward a more democratic system without a break from President Mubarak, who in the West, above all in the United States, is considered the wisest of men and a precise reference point.\n\nOn Hosni Mubarak, in the relation to the 2011 Egyptian protests, as quoted in Berlusconi: Hosni Mubarak Is 'The Wisest Of Men', in The Huffington Post (4 February 2011), and Berlusconi: Mubarak is a wise man at al Jazeera (February 2011)\n\nWe are worried about everything happening there, in all the area. I haven't yet heard from Gaddafi. The situation is evolving and so I don't feel I should disturb anyone.\n\nOn the 2011 Libyan protests, as quoted in EU Observer (21 February 2011)\n\nFreedom means having the right to freely educate your children, and freely means no obligation to send them in a public school, where teachers want to inculcate principles different from the principles that their parents want to inculcate them in a familiar context.\n\nOn public school, in Adoptions, gay couples and public school in la Repubblica (1 March 2011)\n\nI'm getting out to mind my own fucking business, from somewhere else, and so I'm leaving this shitty country, of which I'm sickened.\n\nOn Italy, quoted in Berlusconi under fire for controversial comments about Italy at CNN (3 September 2011)\n\nThe life in Italy is the life of a wealthy country, consumptions haven't diminished, it's hard to find seats on planes, our restaurants are full of people.\n\nDenying the heaviness of the Italian crisis, during the news conference after the end of the G20 summit held in Cannes (3-4 November 2011), as reported in \"Napolitano ammonisce: attuare impegni.

Perché, come sapete, stiamo assistendo alla devastazione del suo paese e alla strage di suoi soldati e di suoi civili.

Because, as you know, we are witnessing the devastation of his country and the massacre of his soldiers and civilians. It was enough for him to stop attacking the two autonomous republics of Donbass and this would not have happened; so I judge very very, very negatively the behavior of this gentleman.\n\nlavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2023/02/13/berlusconi-supports-putin-zelensky-attacked-republics-of-the-donbass/ , La Voce di New York, 13 february 2023\n\noriginal italian language audio source: www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2023/02/12/berlusconi-da-premier-non-sarei-mai-andato-da-zelensky_c3f4cd65-ccb9-4f0d-b813-9cc8a4b26379.html (video from 00:02 to 00:30)\n\nQuotes about Berlusconi\n\n[edit]\n\nAlphabetized by author\n\nOne of the wildest elections in Italian history is finally over. And as expected, it came down to one guy, the guy who inspired a group of topless female protesters to storm his polling station. That looks so inappropriate. Shouting, \"Enough, Berlusconi, enough!\"\n\nThat's right. Bunga, bunga is back. Yesterday and today, all of the headlines had been about Silvio Berlusconi's amazing return to power.\n\nThere's just one problem. He lost. When all the votes were counted, Silvio finished with 31 percent, a strong showing but only good enough for second place behind a guy called Pier Luigi Bersani.\n\nBut still every headline is about sweet Silvio, because sometimes you don't have to be first to be famous. Even people who hate him, and there are a lot of them, want to read and hear about him. … Silvio, Danica and Tiger, what a threesome. They're not famous for nothing. They are hugely successful at a level that most of us can only dream of.\n\nBut what really matters is that they have that something, that ineffable and intangible something simply known as star power. People care about them. That's even when they lose, they're the ones we want to hear about.\n\nAnd maybe that's a great gift or maybe it leads to an intense stressful life since every loss and every failures in the headlines you can't have any secrets. Only perfection is enough.\n\nErin Burnett, on Erin Burnett Outfront (26 February 2013)\n\nTo me Silvio Berlusconi incarnates all the qualities a stateman should have. When I studied politics, I was taught that the ideal politician is a man who having had success in his own profession and not having economic worries for himself and his family, decides to devote part of his life to the service of his people at the local or national level, which is tantamount to saying that the ideal politician ought to be:\n\n• A self made man, who, as such, has already proven his work capabilities,\n\n• Rich enough to be insensitive to bribery.\n\nNo matter what his adversaries say, this is the picture of Silvio Berlusconi, who on top of all that, is a very charismatic figure with a great sense of humor, which makes him a political leader ahead of his time, at least for Italy.\n\nGiglio Reduzzi, in Berlusconi: The Truth About Italy's Much Maligned Premier (2010), p. 25\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nProfile: Silvio Berlusconi, BBC News\n\nA chronology of Berlusconi's life from Ketupa.net\n\nBerlusconi cuts stake in television company, IFEX\n\nForbes.com: Forbes World's Richest People\n\nBBC News, Berlusconi in his own words\n\nThe Observer, Did I say that?\n\nSilvio Berlusconi; A Complex Character\n\nIl Popolo della Libertà · Berlusconi's political party\n\nFanclub website"
