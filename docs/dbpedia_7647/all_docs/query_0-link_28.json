        "meta_description": "Silvio Berlusconi has been Italy’s prime minister three times, making him the country’s longest-serving post-war premier. His leadership was undermined by sex scandals, and by the growing Euro zone sovereign debt crisis, and Berlusconi resigned as prime minister in November 2011, but mounted a comeback in late 2012.",

        "text": "Despite Rome quitting Beijing’s belt and road, the two sides were seen to ‘let diplomacy work in favour of a smooth and productive revision of bilateral relations’.\n\nTens of thousands of people outside the Duomo and within erupted in applause as a sign of respect as Berlusconi’s flower-draped casket was hoisted out of the hearse and into the cathedral.\n\nThe four-time prime minister was a media mogul and political showman whose financial and sexual scandals made him the most polarising figure in modern Italy\n\nThe 86-year-old former prime minister had heart surgery in 2016, has also had prostate cancer, and has been repeatedly admitted to hospital since contracting Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nThe former prime minster was accused of paying 24 people to provide false testimony in a trial where he was charged with paying for sex with 17-year-old Moroccan nightclub dancer.\n\nThe victory by the prime minister’s right-wing coalition cements her position nearly 4 months after she took office.\n\nThe premier used her trip to Brussels to declare that her country would be a force to reckon with in the bloc’s affairs.\n\nThe country’s first female prime minister recited the ritual oath of office, pledging to be faithful to Italy’s post-war republic and to act ‘in the exclusive interests of the nation’.\n\nHer anti-immigration Brothers of Italy party won the September polls but needs outside support to form a government.\n\nFormer Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi is making his return to Italy’s parliament, winning a seat in the Senate nearly a decade after being banned from holding public office over a tax fraud conviction.\n\nFar-right leader Giorgia Meloni said she was ready to govern for ‘all Italians’ after her Eurosceptic populists swept to victory in general elections.\n\nGiorgia Meloni has been called a fascist, an extremist and – to an extent – a de facto heir to 20th century dictator Benito Mussolini. She also seems well on her way to becoming Italy’s next prime minister.\n\nHe wanted to resign because he didn’t have the backing of parties in his coalition, which are unhappy about his reference to fiscal reform, freeing up beach concessions and his pledge of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMattarella, 80, had ruled out remaining in office, but agreed after parties failed to find a mutually acceptable alternative candidate in a week of fraught voting in parliament.\n\nThe Italian head of state is set to meet the presidents of both parliamentary chambers before talks on Thursday and Friday with party leaders."
