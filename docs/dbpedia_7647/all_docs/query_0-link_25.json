        "text": "ROME — Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is hobbling toward one more political comeback, despite his age, poor health and scandalous legal problems.\n\nBerlusconi, 81, was the dominant political figure for a generation of Italians, bursting onto the scene from the world of television and property development and heading four separate governments between 1994 and 2011.\n\nPundits wrote his political obituary after he resigned as prime minister seven years ago amid a personal scandal and with the country teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nNow, ahead of the March 4 national election, the billionaire media tycoon is tapping into the rising tide of populist, nationalist sentiment across the globe — including in the United States, where President Trump has drawn comparisons to Berlusconi.\n\nThe Italian mogul is enjoying an unlikely political rebirth, despite being the host of infamous “bunga bunga” sex parties and being convicted of paying for sex with a minor, along with bribery, tax fraud and influence peddling. He was spared from jail because of his age, but he spent time under house arrest and performed community service for a year at a retirement home.\n\nMore: Italy's upcoming election: Why it matters\n\nMore: Italy's election: A quick guide ahead of Sunday's vote\n\n“I think the lesson here is that it’s always risky deciding Berlusconi is finished,” said Alessandro Campi, a professor specializing in history of political thought at the University of Perugia. “Every time people try to write him off, he emerges again as a protagonist.”\n\nEven Americans in Italy find Berlusconi’s rising support puzzling.\n\n“It certainly seems odd to me that a lot of Italians are once again willing to consider supporting a person with these kinds of character issues,” said Spencer Mann, 33, an IT consultant from Washington, D.C.\n\nThe seeds of revival were sown for the controversial octogenarian after last year's unexpectedly strong showing in regional Sicilian elections. With next month's vote looming, pollsters say Berlusconi’s party — Forza Italia, named for a popular soccer cheer — is running a strong third.\n\nThe two leading parties are headed by men decades younger than Berlusconi. The leader of the center-left Democratic Party is another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, 43. And the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement is headed by Luigi Di Maio, 31, a member of Parliament.\n\nUnlike Renzi and Di Maio, Berlusconi is ineligible to become prime minister because of his legal woes. His remaining convictions, in theory, could be overturned before the March vote, but his most likely role would be as kingmaker, with power to help set the government's priorities, according to Giovanni Orsina, a historian with Rome’s LUISS University.\n\n“Berlusconi could throw his support behind a possible coalition of parties in order to give them the majority needed to form a government,” Orsina said. “In that way, he could help influence the agenda even without an official role.”\n\nThat could worry many in the European Union, because Berlusconi is a critic of Italy’s participation in the 19-nation euro currency zone. And this week he pulled a page from Trump’s playbook by vowing to expel as many as 600,000 migrants and to police the country’s border more closely if his party is part of the next government.\n\nBerlusconi is tapping into a growing anti-immigration backlash after hundreds of thousands of migrants have landed in the country in the past few years, many rescued from smugglers' boats in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHis call to send migrants back to their homeland came after a highly publicized drive-by shooting over the weekend left six Africans wounded in central Italy. Police described the suspect as a far-right extremist with neo-Nazi sympathies.\n\n“If Forza Italia is in the government, it (expelling migrants) could happen,” said Arianna Montanari, a sociologist and political scientist with La Sapienza University in Rome. “I think Berlusconi wants to see himself as a kind of ‘noble father’ figure, but he could also make a government collapse by pulling his support.”\n\nNo party is likely to reach the 40% threshold needed in the upcoming election to guarantee a majority in Parliament. Without a majority, the parties must cobble together a coalition to run the government.\n\nRenzi’s Democratic Party and Di Maio’s Five-Star Movement each register support from about a quarter of the voters, said Maria Rossi, co-director of the polling firm Opinioni. The next largest party is Berlusconi’s, with nearly 20%, followed by another populist party, the Northern League, with around 12%. The combined support for longtime allies Forzi Italia and the Northern League could create a three-way tie.\n\nRossi said Berlusconi’s support might end up higher than polls indicate, since some respondents might be embarrassed to admit their political leanings.\n\n“Here we go again,” said Sandro Romano, 41, a Roman coffee bar worker. “Enough! Anyone who votes for Forza Italia is voting for a dysfunctional government that will leave everyone worse off by the time it collapses.”\n\nVirginia Ascione, 39, a book editor from Naples, agreed, saying it's time for Italy to look forward.\n\n“Berlusconi is very old, he’s a convicted criminal, and he should probably be in prison,” Ascione said. “I left Italy and moved to London back in 2009 because I felt Italy was becoming a joke under Berlusconi’s leadership. He represents the past, and it’s time to move on.”\n\nBerlusconi’s supporters say they do not have illusions about their candidate but claim he is the best option in a field of flawed contenders.\n\n“I know he’s no saint,” said Emmanuela Nucci, 59, an in-home health care worker. “But he has the courage to bring up the real problems in the country, and he is the only one with the experience to get things done. Everyone else is trying to figure that out. We need an adult.”"
