Art entered Thomas Pendelton's life as an escape. By age four, he was already creating art to find an alternate reality. By the time he was 14, he knew art would be his life's driving force. At 20, he apprenticed at The World Famous Bert Grimm's tattoo parlor under Rick Walters, a well-respected artist. Then, after taking a few years off to pursue sculpting, airbrushing, set design and computer graphics, Thomas jumped at the chance to work in Hart & Huntington's unique environment. A true artist with a personality to match, Thomas is charming and hip, with a smile that never lets you forget he's a bad boy. When John Huntington departed, Thomas and Carey Hart formed a new partnership. Thomas is a key factor in the look, vibe, and brand that will either make or break the Hart & Huntington shop.
