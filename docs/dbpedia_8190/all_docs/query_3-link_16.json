Page 44, 56, 57, 58.\n\nAdmitted freeman at Westerly, 4 May 1731, and his long life was spent in that town as one of the most prominent citizens.\n\nIn 1742 he was one of the Council of the First Church of Stonington appointed to form a church at Westerly. The records of this church state that on the 8th of April, 1752, \"Deacon William Pendleton desired to commune with us which was granted.\" March 22, 1752, \"The Revd. Mr. Park being returned from Boston, at the desire of Deacon Pendleton preached from Jeremiah ye 8-2.\"\n\nIn June 1746, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace at Westerly and served as such for several years thereafter. On the 11th of Nov., 1746, he was directed by the Rhode Island Assembly to repair at cost of colony the government's part of the Pawcatuck Bridge; his appointment refers to him as \"Captain.\" In 1747 he was a Deputy from Westerly to the Assembly and in May of that year was appointed Major in the third regiment of the King's County Militia.\n\nThe following year he was re-elected to the Assembly and in June was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of his regiment. He continued as such during 1749 and in 1750 became Colonel of the regiment, as office which he held for ten years. In 1757, during the French and Indian War, he was appointed muster Master, and in 1758, the Assembly voted to pay Col. Pendleton 71 Pounds, 4 shillings for expenses in raising his regiment in 1756 (RI Col. Rec.). Among various items in the Westerly records relating to him we find that on \"February 9, 1787, Col. Wm. Pendleton Col. of the Regiment of King's Country Appeared before this Council & pray allowance of 12 pounds for Numbering the Inhabitants of this town accd to act of assembly, had an order\" (West C & P Rec., iii. 509). It also appears that on the 30th of August, 1762, it was \"Voted that Col. Wm. Pendleton have an order to the town treasurer for the sum of 55 pounds, 1s. old tendor for his expenses the Last Inferior Court he being Imployed in behalf of the town: (West. C & P Rec., iv. 12).\n\nCol. Pendleton was one of the wealthiest men in Westerly. The tax list for the town in 1757 shows that he was assessed 2,P, 12s-a greater sum than that paid by all the other Pendletons there combined-and the Rhode Island census of 1774 says that he owned a slave. There is also a tradition to the effect that during the Revolution he fitted out two privateers which were captured by the British. However that may be, it cannot be denied he served his country faithfully in that struggle while acting as President of the Westerly Town Council.\n\nThis office Col. Pendleton held continuously from 1762 to 1731, and while the war was in progress, the councilors, besides their usual duties raised soldiers for the army, furnished them with clothing, and had charge of all matters relating to the local defense.\n\nCol. Pendleton further showed his patriotism by subscribing 40P to the Continental Loan Office in 1779, and 4P more at a later date to help make up the deficiency at Westerly (\"Town Meeting,\" iv. 131,5). In July, 1780, the Rhode Island Assembly appointed his to receive recruits at Westerly. (RI. Col. Rec., ix, 126).\n\nAnother tradition relating to Col. William Pendleton says that he was a good deal of a sportsman spending much of his time in hunting, accompanied by a negro slave, \"Jack,\" and two dogs, \"Prince\" and \"Granger.\" He carried two horns of powder with him, which he considered a day's sport to employ. There is much likelihood that there is more than a grain of truth in this tradition, as the Colonel's great-grandson, Hadlai F. Pendleton, of Norwich, NY, who is the authority for this anecdote, as well as many others relating to the early Pendletons, has Col. William's old powede-horns, and we have seen that the Rhode Island Census showed that he was the owner of a slave. We have, however, found no records to the dogs.\n\nCol. William Pendleton's will, dated at Westerly, RI, 18 August 1785 (See Appendix VIII), was probated 30 October 1786.\n\nWilliam-4 Pendleton married (1), at Stonington, Conn., 10 March 1725/6, Lydia Burrows, daughter of John, Jr. and Lydia (Hubbard) Burrows. She was born at Groton, Conn., 19 April 1703, and died Westerly, RI 18 August 1750. On the 27th of July, 1752, Col. William Pendleton requested the Town Council of Westerly to appoint him guardian of his children by his former wife, so that he could receive the legacies given said wife by her father, John Burrows, late of Groton, dec. (C & P Rec. iii, 323).\n\nWilliam married (2), at Stonington, Conn, 4 April 1751, (25 April in First Ch. Stonington Rec.), Mrs. Mary Chesebrough, widow of Zebulon Chesebrough, Sr., and daughter of John and Lucia (Stanton) McDowell.

His mother and step-father, Samuel Rogers, removed from Westerly to Branford, Conn, about 1725, and it is not unlikely that Joshua went with them, as on the 12th of February, 1727/9, he bought of Abial Eliot for 22 pounds a tract of land in the adjoining town of Guilford (Guilford Deeds, iv. 18). On the 25th of April, 1729, Eliot mortgaged to him an adjacent lot of one quarter acre (Ibid., p. 92), and on the 23rd of the following December he sold or mortgaged to Eliot the property he owned in Guilford.\n\nNot long afterward he returned to Westerly, where on the 27th of March 1732, with his wife Dorothea as a party to the deed, he sold to Stephen Wilcox about 100 acres of land with house, etc., thereon, \"It being part of Capt. James Pendleton's farm\" (W.I.E., v.345-6). On the same day he bought of Wilcox for 650 pounds land in Stonington, Conn. (Stonington Deeds, iv, 298).\n\nJoshua does not appear to have settled at Stonington immediately, as in October, 1733, he was admitted freeman at Westerly (T.R.), but he is called \"of Stonington\" in the deed he and his wife made to John Richmond of their Stonington property, 15 Jan 1734 (Stonington Deeds, iv, 502-3). They went back to Guilford soon after this date, where on the 8th of April, 1736, Joshua bought of Daniel Hubbard for 304 pounds, three and three quarters acres of land with house and other buildings thereon (Guilford Deeds, v, 231). On the 17th of April, 1741, he bought an additional tract of land on the \"Great Ox Pasture.\"\n\nAfter these various movings about, Joshua settled down permanently at Guilford, where he spent the rest of his life except for such time as he was in the Colonial army during King George's War. Like nearly all the men of his day he engaged in farming and stock raising, but to no considerable extent, his will shows that his chief occupation was tanning, with its old time adjunct of making shoes, and that he carried on this business to a large way in Guilford.\n\nOutside of his being one of those chosen to build a wharf at Jones's Bridge in 1744, he does not appear to have taken much active part in the civil affairs of the town, but he was deeply concerned in the military enterprises of the Colony. In February, 1745, the Connecticut Assembly appointed Joshua Pendleton of Guilford \"To be Ensign in the Regiment of Foot to be raised and sent from this Government on the expedition against his Majesties enemies at Cape Breton, etc. and orders that he be commissioned accordingly.\" (Conn. Col. Rec.) This regiment saw active service in the first campaign against Louisburg, and it is reasonable to suppose that Joshua was one of Pepperell's hardy New Englanders who besieged that fortress and effected its capitulation, 17 June 1745.\n\nAfter such an adventure as this it was to be expected that Joshua would continue to take an active interest in military affairs, and we accordingly find that in May, 1718, the Assembly appointed him Ensign of the 2nd Company or Train Band in the 7th Regiment of the Colony, and that in May, 1755, he was commissioned Lieutenant in the same Company and Regiment *Conn. Col. Rec.). A reference to his soldier life is made in his will in which he leaves to his son, Increase, \"My Artillery and Implements of War.\" This will, dated 27 Feb 1758, proved March 1760 (See Appendix VIII), names wife, Dorothea, son Increase, and daughter Deborah Fowler.\n\nLieut. Joshua Pendleton married Dorothea Ward, daughter of Capt. Andrew and Deborah (Joy) Ward of Killingworth, Conn. (Goodwin's \"Genealogical Notes\"). She was born 4 Jan 1708, and died at Guilford, 5 Nov 1763.\n\nSource: RI. Genealogical Register, v4, #4, p355.\n\nRIGR: Joshua Pendleton, youngest son, under age, named in his father's will.\n\nBRIAN PENDLETON AND HIS DESCENDANTS, 1599-1910, Compiled by Everett Hall , page 60.\n\n21. Edmund-4 Pendleton, Jr. (Edmund-3), was born probably at Westerly, RI, and died early in 1789, at Stratford, Conn. He was admitted freeman at Westerly, RI, 7 Jun 1732 (\"Town Meetings,\" Book 1, page 52), and was an inn-keeper there for a number of years, as the Town Council and Probate records show he was licensed annually to sett \"strong liquor\" between 1744 and 1752.\n\nOn the 28th of Sept. 1747, Edmund Pendleton, Jr., was made bondsman for Lieut. John Garner, \"Late of Stonington, now Cohabiting in this town\" (C & P rec., iii, 126), and in 1750 he was administrator of his father's estate.\n\nOn the 25th of Mar 1754, it was voted by the Town Council of Westerly, \"That the Clerk of this Council Gave a Certificate to ye Selectmen of Stratford that We do own Edmund Pendleton his wife and family to be inhabitants of this Town & as Such Will Receive them from that town When required\" (C. & P. rec., iii, 298).\n\nEdmund-4 Pendleton probably removed to Stratford shortly after receiving this certificate, and the rest of his life was undoubtedly passed in that town. Both Edmund and his wife were living in 1786, as shown by the will of their son, Solomon (Appendix VII), which reads: \"In consideration of the care and tenderness of my dear parents to me in my infancy I do give and bequeath unto my brother Daniel five hundred pounds sterling the value thereof in landed property, . . . on consideration that my said brother Daniel do support and maintain them in a comfortable manner during their lifetime.\"\n\nOn the 29th of January, 1789, William Pendleton was appointed administrator on Estate of Edmund Pendleton, late of Stratford, deceased (Strantford Conn. Probate rec., ii, 19). The inventory taken the following day and submitted 3 Feb 1789, including only furniture and wearing apparel to the total of 15.13.9 Pounds. (Ibid., ii, 20).\n\nOn the 26th May 1792, administrator's account against estate of Edmund Pendleton was allowed. 6.10.6 pounds (Ibid, iii, 82).\n\nEdmund-4 Pendleton's marriage evidently did not occur until he was a middle-aged man. Five of his sons took active parts in the Rebolutionary war, and the record of their services shows them to have formed an exceedingly patriotic family.\n\nEdmund-4 married at Stonington, Conn, 9 Apr 1738, Susannah King (Stonington Church Records).\n\nBRIAN PENDLETON AND HIS DESCENDANTS, 1599-1910, Compiled by Everett Hall, page 64.\n\n24. Rebecca-4 Pendleton (Edmund-3), was born probably at Westerly, RI; her date of death is unknown. She married, 30 Aug 1741, Oliver Steward (Stewart), (First Church, Stonington, rec.), born 12 Feb 1719, son of William and Sarah (Church) Steward (History of Stonington, page 603). For some years after their marriage they lived at Westerly, where Oliver bought land of Joshua Rathbun on the 9th day of the 5th month, 1746 (W.I.F., vii, 365). Prior to 1756 they removed to Stonington, as they called themselves of that town in the deed they made to Jonathan Foster of their Westerlyt property on the 13th of January in that year (Ibid., ix, 205)\n\nWhat became of this family afterwards is unknown, as none of their names appear later upon the Westerly, Stonington, or New London records. It is possible that they may have removed to Voluntown, Conn., where Oliver received a tract of land by his father's will -- dated 30 Oct 1753 (New London Probate rec., Book F, p. 569). The church records of Voluntown, however, do not refer to him. We have accordingly been unable to determine wehther or not Oliver and Rebecca had other children besides the following three given in the Westerly records.\n\nThat they may have had other children seems not unlikely, and Mr. Edwin Vincent of New York City states he has somewhere come across a record which indicates Oliver and Rebecca had additional children, Oliver, Jr., and Dorothy.\n\nNOTE -- A possible clue to this family may be given in the US Census of 1790, in which the names of Oliver and Daniel Steward appear as residents of Cornwall, Conn., the latter, however, evidently being a minor. The Litchfield District Probate Records do not refer to them.\n\nBRIAN PENDLETON AND HIS DESCENDANTS, 1599-1910, Compiled by Everett Hall Pendleton, Privatley Printed MCMX, found in the DAR Library, Washington, DC. Page 69.\n\n31. Elizabeth-4 Pendleton (Caleb-3), was baptized 25 Jun, 1699 (First Ch. Stonington, Conn.) She married Jonathan Brown. In the settlement of Caleb-3 Pendleton's estate, Jonathan Brown gave the executor, Benoni Smith, a receipt for his wife, Elizabeth Brown, who was named in Caleb's will as \"my daughter, Elizabeth Brown\" (Westerly C & P rec., iii, 330). This Jonathan Brown was undoubtedly Elizabeth's first cousin, Jonathan-4, born 12 July 1694, son of Eleazer (11) and Ann-3 )Pendleton) Brown, as is indicated by the names of their children and by the fact that they lived upon the land inherited by Ann-3 from her father, James-2 Pendleton.\n\nNo list of the children of Janathan and Elizabeth -4 (Pendleton) Brown appears upon the vital records of Westerly, but the land and probate records of the town give us four of their names as follows:\n\nOn the 14th of June 1756, Jonathan Brown and Elizabeth, his wife, conveyed to William \"Brumley\" [Bromley] land in Westerly (W.L.E., ix, 218). The index to this record reads, \"William Brumbley from his father Brown.\" William Bromley had married Elizabeth Brown, 9 November 1743. The land records show further that Jonathan Brown and his wife, Elizabeth, made deeds of gift to their sons, Eleazer and Ebenezer, on the 23th June, 1714, and the 3rd January, 1764, respectively (Ibid., v.324 and x,7). They also deeded five acres to their son, \"Bryan\" adjoining William Bromley's land, 3rd January, 1764 (Ibid., x, 5), and sold land to William William Vincent, 14th June 1756 (Ibid., x, 218). On the same day \"Bryan\" Brown and Mehitalde, his wife, deeded land to William Vincent.\n\nOn the 27th March, 1769, \"Mrs. Elizabeth Brown, wife of Jonathan Brown, represented that her husband had sold his farm and is about to move into some distant land and one third the money said land sold for was paid to Benjamin Wilbur by her Request for her support, and she not having security for same requests that town council that they would receive the money from Wilbur for her use and support in her old age.\" (C & P. Rec., iv, 123).\n\nNow on the 25th December 1769, it was voted by the Town Council to pay the Town Treasurer 1 pound 9 1/4d. for \"Briant\" Brown's taxes out of the money received from Benjamin Wilbur and belonging to Mrs. Elizabeth Brown (Ibid., iv, 136). Furthermore, on the 15th July, 1762, Ebenezer Brown declared \"that in the year 1756 he heard his brother Eleazer say that if he never came back he gave his son Jesse Brown to his brother Bryant Brown to do by as his own son & further saith that his said brother died soon after.\" Elizabeth Brown also declared she her her son Eleazer make this statement a little before his death (C & P Rec., iv, 13).\n\nBesides these four children Jonathan and Elizabeth were undoubtedly the parents of that Jonathan Brown, entry of whose marriage upon the records of the Second Church of Stonington (now North Stonington) refers to him as \"of Westerly\". The contemporaneous Jonathan Brown, Jr., of Stonington, son of Jonathan and Hannah (Richardson) Brown, was only ten years old at this time.\"\n\nAn item on page 28 of Book III, Westerly \"Town Meetings,\" also indicated that another child should be included in this family, as it states that \"Jonathan Hankes and Hannah Brown, daughter to Jonathan Brown of Westerly,\" were married in 1752.\n\nBROWN GENEALOGY, Vol II, Boston, The Everett Press Co., 1915, by Cyrus Henry Brown, page 217.\n\nThey lived upon land inherited by Ann Pendleton from her father, James. No list of children of Jonathan and Elizabeth (Pendleton) Brown appears upon the vital records of Westerly, but the land and probate records of the town give us four of their names. From the foregoing records we may set down the issue of Jonathan and Elizabeth Brown in about the following order.\n\nSources: B.G., Vol.2, p. 217; Early New England Pendletons.\n\nBRIAN PENDLETON AND HIS DESCENDANTS, 1599-1910, Compiled by Everett Hall Pendleton, Privatley Printed MCMX, found in the DAR Library, Washington, DC. Page 65.\n\n27. James-4 Pendleton (Caleb-3), was born about 1689, probably at Westerly, RI, and died there 9 June 1753. James Pendleton was baptized with his father on the 23rd Jul 1693, in the First Church at Stonington, Conn. He seems to have made his home at Westerly all his life, where he engaged in farming. On the 24th of Dec 1727, he bought of his cousin, Sarah-4 Walker, for 10s, all her rights that she had in a certain tract of land \"That was given to my Honrd. Grandfather Capt. James Pendleton deceased, by reason of his services in ye Indian War formerly, which land is in ye township of Voluntown, Conn.\" (W.L.E.)\n\nOn the 19th of November 1731, James-4 bought of Richard Lanphere, \"Eldest son and heir to Mr. George Lanphere, late of Westerly, dec.,\" part of George Lanphere's homestead farm for 100 pounds (Ibid., v, 347); 18th March 1743/3, James and his father Caleb, gave deed in James' son, Thomas Pendelton, of land in Westerly (Ibid., iv, 44). On the 28 January, 1744/5, James Pendleton was given a certificate of residence in the selectmen of Voluntown, Conn. (Westerly C. & P. rec., ii, 400), but we do not know whether he ever went there or not.\n\nJames-4 Pendleton married (1), at Westerly, RI, 12th Jan 1709/10, Elizabeth Lanphere (T.R.) daughter of George Lanphere, ; Pendleton signed an agreement with the other heirs of Lanphere, 25 April 1727 (C.& P. rec., 1719-1731, p. 136). He married (2), at Westerly 6th January, 1717/18, Elizabeth Brown, daughter of Thomas, Jr. (T.R.) and Hannah (Collins) Brown. She was born at Stonington, Conn., 9th May 1694. On the 23rd March, 1735, she owned covenant to the Stonington Church. She survived her husband many years and in her old age the Town Council of Westerly made provision for her support from 1772 to 1776, during part of which time her son Samuel was paid for her maintenance.\n\nJames Pendleton's will confirms the following list of his children, which appears in the Westerly records.\n\nBRIAN PENDLETON AND HIS DESCENDANTS, 1599-1910, Compiled by Everett Hall Pendleton, Privatley Printed MCMX, found in the DAR Library, Washington, DC. Page 67.\n\n30. Caleb-4 Pendleton, Jr. (Caleb-3), was baptized 6 June, 1697, at Stonington, Conn. (First Ch. Rec.), and died in 1740, at Colchester, Conn. He was living at Westerly, RI, as late as the 9th of Jan. 1736/7, when he witnessed the will of James Babcock of that town. On the 11th of March following, he bought from William and Hannah Douglas, and John and Elizabeth Douglass, a hundred acre farm in Colchester, Conn., for which he paid 800 pounds (Colchester Land Records, v,1). He removed to Colchester shortly afterwards, and the records of that town show he was admitted a freeman there, 1 April, 1740. His death occured not long afterwards, as his will, dated 15 May 1740, was probated 10 June 1740.\n\nCaleb-4, Jr., was evidently in prosperous circumstances for those days, as the inventory of his estate amounted to over 1600 pounds; it included among other items; farm, 1000 pounds; three Indian boy servants, all at 55 pounds; gun and sword, and notes due from Ichabod Randall, Benoni Smith, James Tilkey, Daniel Tennant and Peter Bulkeley. The Indian boy servants of Caleb's may have been the progenitors of the Indians bearing the name of Pendleton who have turned up in later records.\n\nCaleb-4 Pendleton, Jr., married at Westerly, RI, 25 October 1716, Mary Randall, daughter of John and Abigail Randall; she was born at Stonington, 16 December 1798. Less that a year after Caleb's death, she married at Bozrah, Conn., 26 Febrary, 1744, Stephen Stark (Fifth Book, \"Early Conn. Marriages.\")\n\nOn the 5th of May, 1741, William Treadway of Colchester, attorney to Stephen Stark, \"In right of his wife, Mary Stark, who was the widow of Caleb Pendleton of Colchester, dec., \" moved the Probate Court at Hartford that her thirds or dowry of the real estate of the said deceased be set out to her (Hartford Probate Records, xiii, 88).\n\nCaleb-4 Pendleton's first four children were born at Westerly, RI, and are recorded there on p. 112, Vo. I of Town Meetings, etc. The two youngest are named in Caleb's will and perhaps were born at Colchester, Conn.\n\nEARLY CONNECTICUT PROBATE RECORDS, Hartford District 1729-50, III:319-20, WILL OF CALEB PENDLETON\n\nCaleb Pendleton referred to John Randall, Jr. as his \"brother in his will that reads, in part.... \"And I also leave all the rest of my stock and lands and servants in the hands of my brother John Randall, Jr. of Stonington, in New London County, for him to sell and dispose of to pay debts and legacies, who I ordain my sole executor.\n\nWITNESS: Clement Minor, Richard Tozer, and John Holmes.

Page 71.\n\n32. Brian-4 Pendleton (Caleb-3), was baptized 15 Jun 1701, at the First Church, Stonington, Conn. We have no record of his death and few facts about him appear upon the Westerly records. He lived there and at Stonington until about 1750, when he removed to Dutchess Co., NY, thus becoming the first Pendleton to settle west of Connecticut.\n\nOn the 18th of October, 1727, he convayed to James Pendleton three acres of land in Westerly, \"Situated on the northwest corner of land I now live on\" (WlL.E., v, 211), and on 6th April 1730, he sold land to his brother Caleb (Ibid., v, 182).\n\nBrian-4 Pendleton was admitted fireeman at Westerly, RI, 4 May 1731. On the 29th February 1747/8, he gave Benoni Smith receipt for legacy left him by his father, Caleb-3 Pendleton. This receipt was witnessed by John Pendleton (Westerly C & P. Rec, iii, 330).\n\nAccording to the schedule of Capt. James-2 Pendleton's will Brian-4 was to receive certain lands at Watch Hill if his brother Caleb-4, Jr., died before their father, Caleb-3.
