The Edmund Pendleton of Viginia, in his family Choronlogy of 1792 states his family history.\n\nby Mrs Katherine Cox Gottschalk, Washington DC and Major John Baily Calvert Nicklin, Chattanooga.\n\n\"Pendleton is the name of a town in Lancashire, near Manchester. England. In 1469 Thomas Pendleton was living in Lancashire, in which county he held lands; at the same time were two brothers William and Robert Pendleton, who were probably his sons. Another member of the family was the Rev. Henry Pendleton (1521-1557), who may have been a brother of George Pendleton ST. Who lived in the town of Pendleton during the reign of King Henry VII. Thomas Pendleton, who died in 1534, was nephew of the Rev Henry Pendleton(supra); he had five sons: George, Edward,(who died in 1576 and was married to Anne Newton adn they had four children: Edward; Frances,Thomas and Elizabeth) William, Henry and Frances Pendleton, who married Cecily Beck (a daughter fo Thomas Beck and his wife, Isabel Beswicke, daughter and heiress of Richard Beswicke, JR., who was Founder of Jesus Chantry, Manchester and married Joan, sister of Bishop Oldham of Exeter, who died in 1519 and was buried in the Cathedral Chantry) and they had with three daughters and a son Henry Pendleton who was grandfather of Henry Penleton, Gentleman, living in Manchester in 1635.\n\nGeorge Pendleton, Esq Sr of the Town of Pendleton was living in the regin of King Henry VIII. His son George Pendleton Jr. was born abt 1558 and died 1603. He was buried at St Stephen's Norwich on Oct 27, 1603 the family haveing moved to Norfolk. He was admitted to the Freedom of Norwich as a Scrivener's apprentice on Sept 21,1578. He married at St Peter's Mancroft, Norwich, July 29,1578 Elizabeth Penttingale (who died in 1625 and was buried at St. Stephen's Norwich, on Jan 27,1625) daugher of John Pettingale, Gent of Swardiston, Norwich. (Harleian 1552, folios 241 adn 246, Vistation of Norfolk 1613 Harleian Society, Vol. 32 page 219. More on this family look below,.\n\nGENEALOGIES OF VIRGINIA FAMILIES From Tyler's Quarterly Historial and Genealogical Magazine VOL II\" by Indexed by Robert and Catherine Burns\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE VIRGINIA PENDLETONS\n\nThe name Pendleton seems to have been originally Pen-Huton, meaning top of the hill; the Pen-Eton and finally Pendleton. The name is from two Gaelic words, pendle adn dun, meaning summit or top and his tespectively.\n\nThe Pendletons were rooted in England 500 years before the name was transplanted in America. They emerged from the Crusades with a coat of arms for bravey, old English churches abound in baptismal records of the family, and around Pendleton, England, are tombs of many generations of them.\n\nSiward Pendleton b c 1246 of Lancashire was one of the earliest recorded progenitors, the name appeared in public life during the regin of Henry VII (1485-1509). About 1580 George Pendleton of Manchester married Elizabeth Pettinglae for more go below. The same year, in the Assize Rolls of Lancashire, mention was made of Thomas de Parva Pendleton who was surty for Adm. Richard and Roger de Pendleton, sons of Matilda de Penelton, who was probabley the widow of Siward de Penelton. In 1332 Adam de Penholton paid taxes in Saford and Robert and Thomas de Penholton of Penholton paid taxes there. The town of Pendleton was portion of Saldfordborough.\n\nVirginia, Prominent Families, Vol. 1-4; Volume IV; Chapter X The Pendleton Family\n\nThree miles from Manchester, in Lancashire County, England, is the town of Pendleton, known as a portion of Salfordborough. Over the door of one of the inns swings the arms of the Pendleton family, exactly like those brought to America by the emigrant, Philip Pendleton. Some little distance off is the manor house, occupied still by a family of Pendletons, and around the old church are the tombs of departed Pendletons. Here we pause, feeling ourselves aliens in our father's house. Under that roof tree are the records that would carry us back along the line of English history until we found the ancestor whose bravery in the Crusades, won him the right to place upon his shield the silver pilgrim's shells, which form a distinctive feature of the coat-of-arms. The family evidently belonged to the English gentry, a purer and prouder distinction oftentimes than many of the titles which have changed hands and family names many times as they come down the avenue of ages.\n\nThe first name upon the Virginia record is that of George Pendleton, Esquire, of the town of Pendleton, Lancashire, England. His son was George Pendleton, who married, sometime in the fifteenth century, Elizabeth Pettingall, daughter of John Pettingall, Gentleman, of Norwich, Norfolk County. George Pendleton moved to Norwich, and was buried at St. Stephen's, Norwich, in 1613. His eldest son was Henry Pendleton, who married in 1605 Susan Carmyer, at St. Simeon and St. Jude's. He was buried on July 15, 1635, at St. Stephen's, Norwich. His third son was Henry Pendleton who married Elizabeth -. This gives four generations on English soil, carrying us from Pendleton near Manchester, to Norwich.\n\nIn 1613, Sir John Pettus and his brother Thomas Pettus both made wills, remembering their cousins, Henry and Susan Pendleton, of Norwich, leaving them property in that city. These gentlemen lived at Cristree, St. Edmund's, near Norwich. Thomas Pettus, the son of one of these men, was one of the early councilors of the Colony, and probably influenced his cousins to come to Virginia. The two sons of Henry and Elizabeth Pendleton came to Virginia in 1674, Philip, a young teacher, and Nathaniel, a minister of the Church of England. Nathaniel died very soon, leaving no children\n\nThe arms of Pendleton are taken from English records and are described as follows: Arms-Gules, an inescutcheon argent, between four escallops (or shells) or. Crest-On a chapeau gules, turned up ermine, a demi-dragon, wings expanded, or, holding an escallop (or shell) argent.

He was the son of Thomas Pendleton. He married Anne (Pendleton) 1557 in England?. Could George Pendleton father was Thomas Pendleton?\n\nCould this be the children of George Pendleton and Anne (Pendleton) are: ?\n\n1 William Pendleton.\n\n2 Robert Pendleton.\n\n3 Thomas Pendleton.\n\n4 George Pendleton, born 1553; died 1603 in England; married Elizabeth Pettingale July 29, 1579 in St Peters Mancroft, Norwich, England.\n\nGeorge Pendleton father was\n\nThomas Pendleton.\n\nNotes for George Pendleton, Esq.: Book, \"The Kay-Pendleton-Neel Families\" , George and Margaret Rose, 1969, Pages 104-105\n\nThe results of this search are printed in the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Volume 39 pp. 277-284. It is from this source and corroborative English records that the information now about to be set down on the English origins of the Pendleton Family is derived and here quoted.\n\n\"The name Pendleton seems to have been originally pen-Hulton, meaning top of the hill; then Pen-Elton and finally Pendleton. The name is from the Gaelic words, pendle and dun, meaning summit (or top) and hill respectively. In Lancashire the name appears as early as 1246 when Siward de Pendleton, deceased, was mentioned. The same year, in the Assize Rolls of Lancashire, mention was made of Thomas de Parva Pendleton who was surety for Adam, Richard and Roger de Pendleton, sons of Matilda de Pendleton, who was probably the widow of Siward de Pendleton (supra). In 1332 Adam de Pendleton paid taxes in Salford and Robert and Thomas de Penholton of Penholton paid taxes there. The town of Pendleton was a portion of Saldfordborough.\"\n\nThis shows that the Pendletons were first seated in the hills of Lancashire where the Pendleton coat of arms still hangs over an ancient inn. An old manor house occupied by Pendletons is near. Here also is an old Pendleton graveyard. Pendleton Township stretches across Pendle Hill and Pendle Forest. One hall called Malkin tower once stood on Pendle Hill. It was from this area that the Pendletons removed to Norwich, Norfolk County. Pendle Hill is an elevation of I, 831 feet lying about five miles south of Skipton and about thirty one miles west of Leeds. This configuration still bears the name, Pendle Hill. Pendleton community is still shown on good maps of England--just south of the city of Clitheroe.\n\nA continuous line of descent can be traced from George Pendleton, Esq., Sr., of the community of Pendleton, Lancashire who flourished during the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547). It was either this George Pendleton or his son George Pendleton who moved from Pendleton and settled in Norwich.\n\n(For verification of these details see Harlean 1552, Folios 241 and 246, Visitations of Norfolk, 1613, and Harlean Society, Volume 32, page 219.

It seems that he was brought up in the profession of his father for he had the Freedom of Norwich as a Scriptor on date of September 6, 1605 at which time he was aged twenty one past. In his day there were many who could not write and were obliged to rely on the scribe or scriptor to carry on their correspondence. Twenty four days after his becoming a public scriptor he married (Sept. 30, 1605) at St. Simon and St. Jude's, Norwich, Susan daughter of Humphrey and Cecily (Pettus) Camden. and the granddaughter of Sir Thomas Pedttus the mayor of Norwich in 1591 and wife was Christian Dethick, daughter of Simon Dethick, Esq. of North Elmham.

The latter died very soon, unmarried; he evidently held no clerical charge in the Colony, as his name has never been given among the lists of the clergy of that time. Philip returned to England about 1680; tradition says he married a lady of high social position, but she died, and he returned to the Colony, and in 1682 married Isabella Hurt (or Hert or Hart,) and from this marriage are descended all the Pendletons of Virginia. Philip was born in Norwich, England, in 1650, son of Henry Pendleton, 3rd son of Henry Pendleton, son and heir of George Pendleton, Gentleman, who married Elizabeth Pettingall dau. of John Pettingall, Gentleman of Norwich, Eng. George Pendleton moved from Manchester to Norwich in 1613. His son and heir, Henry, probably married Susan(???) because in Vol. 48 of the New England Hist. and Gen. Register, is found a copy of the will of Sir John Pettus, Knight, of Norwich, Jan. 1613, which says: \"Appoint my cousin, Henry Pendleton, Supravisor of my estate.\" Also Thomas Pettus, of Caistree, St. Edmond's Norfolk, Oct. 1618. \"To my Cousins, Henry Pendleton and Susan, his wife, annuity out of my houses &c. in Norwich.\" This family of Pettus is the same as the one in Va.\n\nThe Pendletons were originally from Manchester, where the name was well known, some of them being in public life as early as the reign of Henry VIII. The Coat of Arms used by the Pendletons of Norwich and by the emigrant, Philip, indicate by the presence of Escallop shells and by the Cardinal's chapeau, in the Crest, a connection with Crusader traditions. The New England Pendletons, descendants of Brian Pendleton, came from Lancaster, and show a different Coat of Arms.\n\nPhilip Pendleton is said to have settled in New Kent Co., but there is no record of the family on the Register of St. Peter's Parish; he probably lived always in the portion called afterwards Caroline county, the records of which were burnt during the war of '61-65. Most of his descendants settled in counties to the north of New Kent. He died in 1721, the same year his oldest son Henry died, and the same year his grandson, the eminent Judge Edmund Pendleton, was born. He had three sons and four daughters, two of his family married into the family of James Taylor, of Carlisle, Eng., and by other intermarriages, a close connection with the Taylor family has been preserved. Some of his descendants were among the founders of St Mark's Parish\n\nMore About Philip Pendleton: Emigration: 1674, England to Virginia\n\nNotes for Isabella Hurt: \"Colonial Familes of the Southern States of America, Second Edition\", 1968, pp. 506, 510.\n\n\"Supplement to A Compilation of Gaines Family Data With Special Emphasis on the Lineage of William and Isabella (Pendleton) Gaines\", Calvin E.

His two daughters married brothers, James and William Henry Gaines. His youngest son, Edmund, though without a father's care, made for himself a name which will be known and remembered as long as Virginia's sons read her history. By his large circle of nephews and neices, many of them his own age, he was loved and revered, and the tradition of his kindness and ever ready help is handed down through nearly every branch of the family.

Pendleton's MS. of \"Redwood,\" Culpeper County, Va., May 1st, 1868.)\n\nThe seven children of the first settlers started on a career of multiplication befitting a new country; so that, as late as 1803, if Judge Edmund Pendleton had been in the prime of life, and the most active man in Virginia, it would have been a very serious, if not an impossible, undertaking to have identified and recorded the names of half of them; whilst he was, in fact, a man of upwards of eighty years of age when he died. He had, for sixty years, without the intermission of a single year, been laboriously engaged in professional and official duties, usually of great importance. He was for the last twenty years of his life most painfully disabled for any physical activity, by reason of an accident which made him a cripple, and consigned him to crutches for life.\n\nHe was a posthumous child and when only a few years old his mother married again to Edward Watkins and he was deprived of the loving care of parents; nevertheless, he grew to be the greatest member of his family and one of the noblest patriots which Virginia has produced. In his youth he studied law with his cousin John Penn., the Signer of the of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFor more on Edmund Pendleton click here.\n\nSlade Anderson's Web Page\n\nNotes for EDMUND PENDLETON:\n\nEDMUND PENDLETON.\n\nWas the fifth son of Henry Pendleton and Mary Taylor. His father died before his birth. The following sketch of him is taken from Appleton's Encyclopedia of American Biography:\n\n\"Edmund Pendleton, statesman, was born in Caroline county, Va. 9th Sept., 1721. His grandfather, Philip, descended from Pendleton, of Manchester, Lancaster county, England, came from Norwich, Eng., to this country in 1674. Edmund began his career in the Clerk's office of Caroline county. He was licensed to practice law in 1744; became County Justice in 1751, and the following year was elected to the House of Burgesses. In 1764 was one of the Committee to memorialize the King. During the session of 1766, he gave the opinion `that the stamp act was void, for want of Constitutional authority in Parliament to pass it,' and voted in the affirmative on the resolution that the `act did not bind the inhabitants of Virginia.' He was one of the Committee of correspondence in 1763; County Lieutenant of Caroline in 1774. A member of the colonial convention, of the latter year, that was consequent on the Boston Port Bill, and was chosen by that body to the first Continental Congress. Accordingly, in company with George Washington, Peyton Randolph, Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, and Richard Henry Lee, he attended in Philadelphia in 1774. As President of Virginia Convention, he was at the head of the government of the Colony from 1775 until the creation of the Virginia constitution in 1776, and was appointed President of the Committee of Safety in that year. In May, 1776, he presided again over the convention, and drew up the celebrated resolutions, by which the delegates from Virginia were instructed to propose a declaration of independence in Congress, using the words that were afterwards incorporated almost verbatim with the Declaration. As the leader of the Cavalier or Planter class, he was the opponent of Patrick Henry, and as leader of the Committee of Public Safety, he was active in the control of the military and naval operations, and of the foreign correspondence of Virginia. On the organization of the State Government, he was chosen Speaker of the House, and appointed, with Chancellor George Wythe and Thomas Jefferson, to revise the Colonial laws. In 1777, he was crippled for life by a fall from his horse; but the same year he was re-elected Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and President of the Court of Chancery. In 1779, he became President of the Court of Appeals, holding the office until his death. He presided over the State Convention, which ratified the Constitution of the United States in 1788. His masterly advocacy of the document gained him the encomium from Jefferson that `taken all in all, he was the ablest man in debate that I ever met with.' He received very large grants of land from the State, and having no children, was ever generous to his nieces and nephews, whose descendants still hold his memory in tender veneration. He married twice--1st. Elizabeth Roy, 2nd. Sarah Pollard. He died in 1803.\"\n\nRef: Genealogical Notes on Culpeper Co., VA\n\nGENERATION NO 8\n\nHenry Pendleton, (JAMES,Henry, Philip), born 1733; died 1798; married Anne Thomas.

He then left it, and established himself at the bar of the city of New York, where he soon achieved distinction and success, some years before the close of the last century. Of his professional career I know but little, except that he was an intimate friend of Rufus King, and Alexander Hamilton, and that he stood by Hamilton in his affair with Aaron Burr, and acted as his executor after he had fallen.

Stuart. Wearing of the Gray, published in 1867, contains Cooke's best writing on the war-sparkling vignettes that display an excellent eye for local color and the picaresque, a wry sense of humor, and a quick grasp of character. His unique pairing of advantaged military perspective and authorial talent \"give his wartime sketches a combination of validity and vitality almost unmatched in the literature of the Civil War\" (Civil War History).\n\nCivil War Career: An extreme secessionist, Cooke used his pen to assist in creating a climate for secession. He served in the Confederate Army on the staff of General J.E.B. Stuart when the war began and took an active part in the early Virginia engagements.
