        "text": "Rival Illusionists, one more talented than the other, two apprentices eager to learn from the best but willing to do what it takes to be better than the rest – makes you wonder who will be superior to end up on top, right? On the surface, that’s the kind of story you’d expect when it comes to a tale about fading illusionists. The author, though, takes a turn on your average illusionist tale by instead of focusing on the magical aspect, she relied heavily on the romance between the two apprentices, Thomas and Saverio.\n\nThomas, apprentice to the famous illutionist Neville Wighton the Great, holds the secret to his success – Thomas is actually the real one with magic. Except, Thomas doesn’t want to have anything to do with his abilities. Neville’s rival, Paolo il Magnifico, is tired of being slighted and seeks to discover the secret by sending his apprentice to seduce Thomas. Only, what at first was originally a seduction with nefarious means, slowly transforms into a “goals” romance.\n\nThe majority of this book is told through various diary entries between the characters Thomas and Saverio, photos, letters, and newspaper clippings. You can see the transformation of Thomas and Saverio’s feelings as well as their struggles and it brought me on the verge to tears at time. This is a historical LGBQ+ romance novel worth delving into!"
