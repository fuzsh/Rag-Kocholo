Duvall, 204 South Eureka Avenue, Columbus.\n\nAs a young man and up till about 20 or 25 years ago, Frank Moats was a familiar figure here. He worked for a long time in local furniture factories and had the same kind of employment in Huntington. He was a Spanish-American veteran, a member of the late Captain Verne M.

Monday afternoon she was reported to have shown some improvement as her temperature declined somewhat. For a number of days it has been generally understood that chances of recovery were against her, but she made a gallant fight until the last moments.\n\nMrs Moch is survived by her husband and two children and parents Mr. & Mrs. Frank Bell of this city.\n\nMrs. Moch has been active in Gallipolis social life since she grew to young womanhood She was universally popular. Her untimely death is a misfortune to the community and deep sympathy for her husband and parents is universal in the community.\n\nThe funeral will be at 2 o'clock on Thursday afternoon at the residence. The burial will be under direction of Geo. Weatherholt and Sons.\n\n[Note: Death Certificate--Bessie Bell Moch born Sept. 6, 1882; died Jan. 8, 1924; age 41 years, 4 months and 2 days.

Brown\n\nMoch, Sara B.\n\nDeath of Mrs. Moch\n\nMrs. Sara B. Moch died at her home in this city last Wednesday morning, October, 10, 1894 (the anniversary of her birth), aged sixty years. She had been a sufferer for many years with heart trouble and dropsy, the latter disease being the immediate cause of death. She bore her afflictions with wonderful patience, and was resigned to the fate that was inevitable. Always cheerful, she consoled those around her, and awaited the end without fear.\n\nThe news of her death was received with unfeigned sorrow. She had many friends. Her deeds of charity were without number, and the poor and suffering to whom she ministered will never forget her.\n\nShe was born in Alsace, France, October 10, 1834, and came to Cincinnati while yet a girl. She was united in marriage with Mr. Moses Moch in 1853. They removed to Gallipolis in 1858, and have made their home here ever since. She was the mother of one child, Louis, who died August 10, 1879, aged twenty-one years. Mr. Moch survives his wife, and in the hour of his bereavement has the heartfelt sympathy of all.\n\nThe remains of Mrs. Moch were taken to Cincinnati on Thursday morning, and the burial was at Walnut Hills Cemetery. They were prepared for burial by Wetherholt, and accompanied to their last resting place by her husband, Miss Sallie Moch, and Mr. Abe Moch.\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nOctober 13, 1894\n\nTranscribed by Sandy Lee Milliron Top of Page\n\nMoch, Stella\n\nMiss Stella Moch Died Last Sunday\n\nMiss Stella, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. Moch, passed away at the home of her parents on Second avenue in this city last Sunday morning, aged 30 years. The disease that carried her away was a most unusual one, being known to the medical profession as \"Hodgkin's Disease.\" This is a disease of the lymphatic system and had caused her to be an invalid for several years.\n\nShe was a graduate of the Gallipolis High School, class of 1896. After graduation she taught in the public schools here, then studied to become a trained nurse., She was compelled to give this up three years ago on account of her failing health. She spent some time in Colorado and South Dakota, in the hope that the climate would be of benefit to her, but it failed to do so and she came home last July in a serious condition. She received every attention, being taken to various hospitals and several eminent specialists were consulted, but there was no hope for her and she was brought home at last to await the end.\n\nShe was always of a sweet and gentle disposition and this was evidenced during her last illness, she accepting her sad lot with patient resignation. She leaves a father and mother; brothers Charles, Lewis and Samuel of Pueblo, and Joseph of this city, and sisters, Mrs. Lilly Kahn, of Sedalla, Mo.; Miss Sallie of Pueblo, Col., Misses Julia and Blanche and Mrs. Clyde C. Ingels of this city.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted at the family residence Tuesday afternoon by Rabbi Voldmer of Charleson, W. Va. His remarks were peculiarly appropriate and touching and deeply impressed the large number of friends who had gathered to pay their last sad tribute to the dead. The floral offerings were many and beautiful. The remains were laid to rest in Mound Hill cemetery by Hayward & Son., the following being the pall bearers: Albert Moch, Leon Silverman, J. M. Kaufman, Earl McCormick, Ira W. Booton, Jr. and H. E. Conard. Miss Moch will be sadly mised[sic] and sincerely mourned by the relatives and a large circle of acquaintances.\n\n[Note: May 1, 1880 - June 5, 1910]\n\nNewspaper unknown\n\nJune 10, 1910\n\nTranscribed by Nancy S. Edwards\n\nMock, Leopold\n\nDROWNED - Leopold Mock, a young German who kept the clothing store immediately under the Journal office, was drowned in the Ohio river at the mouth of Chickamauga creek, on Sunday evening last. It appears that Mock and a Polander named Harris, in company with some boys, borrowed the yawl of the steamer Washington City, now lying at our landing, and proceeded with it to the bar at the mouth of the creek, for the purpose of bathing. Harris could swim a little, but Mock could not. The boys importuned these men not to go below the bar, in the swift water, as there was danger of drowning. They however heeded not the admonition but plunged into the swift water and soon got beyond their depth. Three of the boys caught Harris and brought him safe to shore, a great deal more frightened than hurt. While these were conducting Harris to shore, two other boys, John Burgess and Geo. W. Brown, seized Mock, who had got into about twelve feet of water, but owing to his floundering they could do but little with him.\n\nThey were taken under several times, and Burgess getting strangled and becoming exhausted, abandoned him and with some difficulty reached shore.---But Brown, who, by the way, is in our employ, stuck to Mock manfully and is deserving of great credit for his extraordinary exertions in endeavoring to save the life of a human being. He caught the drowning man by the arm, and exerted himself to the utmost to bring him ashore, but the current was too swift. Still he did not desert him until there was great peril of losing his own life, for Mock was grasping wildly at everything, and finally caught Brown by the wrist of the right arm. This time they both sunk [sic] and it was feared both would drown, as Mock had a death-grip on Brown's wrist, but the latter had the presence of mind while under water to release the hold of the drowning man by prying open his fingers with the hand he had at liberty, when he immediately rose to the surface and swam to shore. Mock did not again rise to the surface. Exertions were made to recover the body, but it being in a nude state the grappling-hooks were of little use, as they were not sharp enough to enter the flesh, consequently it was not recovered until Monday evening.\n\nThe Gallipolis Journal\n\nJune 22, 1854\n\nTranscribed by Eva Swain Hughes Top of Page\n\nMoffat, Mary\n\nMrs. Mary Moffat, of Huntington, died in that city the other day.

J. W. Mohler, former pastor of the Baptist Church here. Mrs. Mohler was on her way here intending to make a visit next week. Her little one died of cholera infantum aged a little past four years after a week’s illness.\n\nShe, her father and sister arrived here with the remains Thursday evening, and today after a nice service at the Baptist Church by Rev. F. E. Brininstool, it was followed to Mound Hill by a goodly concourse of people where it was laid away beside its father. The pall bearers were Elmer Davis, Earl Deeter, Allen Wallace and Charley Grow.\n\nMrs. Mohler is at Mrs. Melissa McDaniels on Fourth street and will remain a while.\n\nGallipolis Daily Tribune (Pg. 3)\n\nFriday, August 13, 1897\n\nTranscribed by Sandy Milliron\n\nMohler, Rev. J. W.\n\nIt is our sad duty to record the death of the Rev. J. W. Mohler, who passed from this life at eight o’clock last Friday morning, of last week at the home of Mr. W. H. H. McDaniel, in Cadmus, this county. We have in previous issues spoken of the nature of Rev. Mohler’s illness, and will only add that the surgical operation, which was necessitated did not give the relief hoped for, and that a complication of heart and lung affections [infections] with nervous prostrations, supervened.\n\nHis death was sudden. Friday morning we received information, dated Thursday evening, that Rev. Mohler was on the whole progressing favorably, and by Friday noon news had arrived of his death. Death, though sudden, found him prepared; with the best preparation, an eminently consecrated Christian life, was the calm assurance of sleeping in Jesus.\n\nRev. J. W. Mohler was born in Darke County, O., 9th July, 1862, the son of Ephraim and Anna Mohler. He was brought up and attended school in Covington, O., the present home of his parents, whose feebleness prevented their coming to his funeral. Rev. Mohler taught school for some time, then realizing a call to the ministry, he became pastor at different times of two Baptist Churches in Missouri. In the fall of 1891, he entered the Baptist Theological Seminary at Louisville, Ky., and the following June came to Gallipolis, taking charge of the Baptist Church, where, by earnest labor, exemplary life, and true Christian seal, he not only endeared himself to his congregation but to all of our citizens. He was a man universally respected and liked, and drew into his congregation many not in the habit of attending church, and leaves a place which it will be very difficult to fill.\n\nIn 1885, Mr. Mohler married Miss Mary Hall, of Henrietta, Mo., and there were born to them two children, aged respectively seven and two years.\n\nMr. Mohler was a zealous member of the I. O. O. F., of which Order he had lately been elected V.G., and in which he held a life insurance.\n\nRev. J. W. Mohler’s remains were brought to his home at two o’clock Saturday afternoon, and the funeral was held on Sunday, at eleven o’clock in the morning, in his own church, to which his body was accompanied by a large body of Odd Fellows. The funeral services were impressive. On the pulpit platform with Rev. Loving of Huntington, were the pastor of the Buffalo Baptist Church, and the pastors of the African Baptist, the Methodist, and the Presbyterian Churches, most of whom took some part in the services. The sermon by Rev. Loving was eminently fitting to the occasion, and was based on certain characteristic resemblances between the martyr Stephen and the dead pastor. Rev. B. F. Jackson then offered a touching tribute to the memory of the dead good man “whose deeds do follow” him. During the services several hymns were sung beautifully and sympathically by the choir.\n\nThe church was literally packed, as is shown by the fact that, at the close of the services, five hundred and nineteen people looked, many of them through tears, into the calm face, where seemed to brood a childlike peace. Very many persons were obliged to turn away from the church doors.\n\nThe remains were then escorted by a very large cortege consisting of the Lodge of Odd Fellows and a great number of citizens to Mound Hill Cemetery, where interment was made.\n\nMr. Ephraim Mohler, Miss Ida Mohler, and Mrs. Emma Colbert, of Covington, O., and Mr. Solomon N. Mohler, of Louisville, Ky., brothers and sisters of Rev. J. W. Mohler, came here to attend the funeral. Supt. J. B. Mohler telegraphed from Two Rivers, Wis., his inability, on account of a serious accident, to attend his brother’s funeral.\n\nCard of Thanks\n\nWe want to express our heartfelt thanks to the family of W. H. H. McDaniel and citizens of Sand Fork community, and also to the churches and citizens of Gallipolis, for their kindness and sympathy during the sickness and burial of the late Rev. J. W. Mohler.\n\nMrs. Mamie Mohler\n\nS. N. Mohler\n\nThe Gallipolis Bulletin\n\nSaturday, March 9, 1895\n\nTranscribed by Sandy L. Milliron Top of Page\n\nMohler, Rev. J. W.\n\nThe Funeral Of The Late Rev. J. W. Mohler\n\nA Beloved Pastor Laid To Rest\n\n[From Monday’s Daily Journal]\n\nIn the light of the beautiful morning sunshine which streamed into the sacred edifice, illuminating the stained glass that let light onto the pathetic scene, the last sad rites were performed over the remains of Rev. J. W. Mohler, pastor of the First Baptist Church. Long before the hour appointed for the services, the friends of the deceased who had known and loved him in life gathered at the place of worship to pay the last tribute to the dead. The ceremonies began shortly after 11 o’clock, at which time every inch of available space in the church was occupied. The interior of the church hung with black draperies and the scene was one of solemnity and impressiveness.\n\nThe remains reposed in a handsome casket immediately in front of pulpit lately occupied by the deceased. The pallid features of the dead, calm and peaceful, were exposed to view and as they were glanced at none could resist the grief-stricken pain that seized them, knowing as they did it would be a parting look at a sterling citizen.\n\nA more impressive or better sermon than that preached by Rev. Loving, of Huntington, is seldom heard. He eulogized the deceased in a deserving manner. He spoke of his many virtues and referred to his loving family. The music of the choir was most beautiful and appropriate.\n\nThe remains were escorted to Mound Hill cemetery by a large turnout of Odd Fellows in whose charge the remains were, besides an unusually large funeral cortege. The services at the grave were short. A prayer by Rev. Loving and then the fast falling clods of earth bid forever from view all that was mortal of the esteemed dead.\n\nThe Gallipolis Journal\n\nWednesday, March 6, 1895\n\nTranscribed by Sandy L.

Va., April 22, 1903. Died at Logan, W. Va., November 4, 1905.\n\nTo know her was to love her. While not a member of any church, her life was one of the sincerest Christian. Her only consideration was the happiness of others. As a daughter, sister and wife, she was loved with a love that was almost idolatry. And to the bereaved husband, mother, and only sister, Mrs. A. D. Dickey, and numerous relations, her love is such that time or changes can never replace.\n\nHer’s was a life of boundless charity for all, a fitting preparation for that eternal bliss to which she, with an unfaltering trust, so calmly resigned herself. A sunbeam of happiness was she in the shadowed pathway of all who knew her.\n\nHer death caused by a complication of diseases came on almost unexpectedly. While suffering for a few weeks her death came as a shock, which almost prostrated relatives and friends.\n\nBut while mourning her love, they can look back on her exemplary life and by the love of and memory for her are stimulated to live so as to be reunited with her whom Christ has gladly received with the words, “Well done good and faithful servant.”\n\n“Weep not that her trial is over,\n\nWeep not that her race is run;\n\nGod grant that we may rest as calmly\n\nWhen our life like her’s is done,\n\nTill then we should yield with gladness,\n\nOur treasure to him to keep,\n\nAnd rejoice with sweet assurance,\n\nHe giveth His loved ones sleep.”\n\nGallipolis Daily Tribune (Pg. 2)\n\nMonday, November 13, 1905\n\nTranscribed by Sandy Milliron\n\nMootz, Ella [Lindemood]\n\nMrs. Mootz Claimed by Heart Attack\n\nMrs. John (Ella) Mootz, 74, died suddenly at 2:15 p.m. in Columbus Tuesday as a result of a heart attack.\n\nMrs. Mootz was born on Dec. 4, 1890 daughter of the late James and Rachael McVay Lidemood, in Monroe County.

Came to Ohio in early life, settled in Tuscarawas County. Was married to John Morgan (her maiden name was Merrell). They moved to Gallia County in 1852, where they lived until their death. Mr. Morgan died nineteen years ago. Mrs. Morgan joined the Presbyterian Church in early life, and was a constistent member of that church until teh organizagion of the Pisgah Congregational Church, of which she remained a member until her death. The deceased had a stroke of paralysis several years ago, of which she never recovered, and although her death was sudden, it was looked for by her friends. Mrs. Morgan leaves behind six children to mourn the loss of a kind and affectionate mother; her youngest daughter dying but a few weeks before her.\n\n'Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they are mine, saith the Lord.'\n\n[Clipping of obituary no source or date. Found in rear of Wm. Geo. Tope's journal where he kept a family record. Jemima Morgan was his mother-in-law (he being married to daughter Julia). Original journal taken in to GCGS to be copied (one copy kept by me, the other by them)] Top of Page\n\nMorgan, John\n\nOur friend John Morgan is dead. Pennsylvania gave him birth, and Ohio a grave. For more than sixteen years, he was a peaceable and upright citizen of Walnut township, in this county. He moved to this region from Harrison county, Ohio, and by his industry and economy, he acquired a competency for himself and his family. In this acquisition, he was greatly aided by the toils and labors of a faithful and devoted wife. Her watchful care, and the prudent and successful management of her domestic affairs, added to their daily store, and increased their individual and social comforts. He lived to verify, in his own experience, the sacred truth, \"the hand of the diligent maketh rich,\" and that \" the fruits of righteousness\" yield more permanent and lasting enjoyment than this hidden treasures and dishonest gains of the wicked. For neither he nor his family, by their attention to secular duties, forgot \"the pearl of great price,\" in which the true riches of heaven and earth are found. By this course of conduct was reared to him an interesting and flourishing family, whose moral worth and christian character are honored and respected by all who have any regard for truth or goodness, and to whom their beloved father, now deceased has left them the legacy of \"a good name, which is better than precious ointment,\" and more desired than all the treasures of this earth.\n\nMr. Morgan was distinguished for his integrity and uprightness. He hated injustice and oppression deceit and guile. Sincerity, frankness, and honestly marked the whole tenor of his life. This was the result not of natural, but christian principle; in which sense it may be truly said, an \"honest man is the noblest work of God.\" These elements of character, having their origin in his love of truth and duty, appeared in his ever day life. In his business transactions, his social intercourse, his acts of friendship, his tender and affectionate regard for his wife and family, his children and grand children, his love for his country, and his anxiety for its safety amidst the storms and perils through which it has passed, and is still passing, and in his reverence and submission to the authority of God as exhibited in his word and ordinances, his grace and providence. He had indeed his sins and infirmities, as we all have. And not among the least of these was his neglect to make a public profession of the religion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. But if the writer is not mistaken, our deceased friend was a disciple like Nicodemus, or \"Joseph of Arimathea, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.\" Luke 23:51. So our beloved friend \"secretly\" loved and honored the Saviour, and he lived and died trusting in his merits alone for salvation from sin, and for immortality and eternal life.\n\nFew persons, in this community, in his sphere of life, who have gone \"the way of all the earth\" have been more esteemed and respected in life, or lamented in death. But the weight of the grief and lamentation is with the lonely and desolate widow, his orphan sons and daughters. Yet they have reason to be thankful for the mercies that are left, and for the hope that the husband, father, and friend is now in the paradise of God. \"There the wicked, cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.\" -- Job 3:17\n\nVarious were the maladies with which Mr. Morgan was afflicted. His chief disease was chronic diarrhea. After a painful and lingering illness of some weeks duration, he left his clay tenement for \"mansions in the skies,\" as we fondly hope, August 30th, 1866, in the 64th year of his age. A funeral discourse was delivered on the next day at the family residence, by the Rev. J.D. Ray, from Gen. 27:1 2 \"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.\" His mortal remains were followed to the place of burial by numerous relatives, friends and neighbors, where they will lie in repose until the voice of the Arch angel, and the sound of the trump of God shall awake the dead to judgement. In view of this solemn event, it behooves the writer and every reader fervently to utter the prayer: \"Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.\" Num 23: 10\n\n[signed] PILGRIM.\n\nGallipolis Journal\n\n20 September 1866\n\nTranscribed and submitted by Linda Tope Trent Top of Page\n\nMorgan, John E.\n\nJohn E.
