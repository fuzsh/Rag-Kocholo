That would fab if someone could help, as i cant get to preston.\n\ncheers\n\nwww.lancashirebmd.org.uk lists the marriage of Philip P. M. Faulkner & Sarah E. Wheat in 1912 at \"Salford Register Office or Registrar attended\". If this is the correct couple then, unless St George's was a Catholic Church or a non-conformist one & unlicensed for marriages, they are unlikey to have been married there. Without knowing the church where a marriage took place, the easiest way for you to find the marriage is through the above site or through the GRO site.\n\nThanks for replying ,unfortunately Philip P.M Faulkner isnt my grandfather. they were Catholic. I have try the web site above plus others but still cant find the marriage. 100% they were married in pandleton salford, so i dont understand why i cant find it. Found his dads brother on the 1901 cenus it says he was married in pendleton and his children weremessage=Thanks for replying ,unfortunately Philip P.M Faulkner isnt my grandfather. they were Catholic.
