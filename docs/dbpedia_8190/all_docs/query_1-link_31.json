        "text": "We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Kenneth S. Pendleton, 58, of Plantsville, CT who courageously fought cancer for 6 years and on Monday, January 15, 2024, passed away peacefully surrounded by his family. Ken leaves a huge void in the life of Marcy and their children, Ryan (Christy), Taylor (Shelby), Jordan (Maddie) Andrew (Shania), Jessica (Brenton), and their grandchildren Lucas, Lydia, Lincoln, and sister and niece Brenda and Makayla.\n\nKen was born on September 13, 1965 in Wareham, MA to the late John and Kay (Jussila) Pendleton and most recently worked as a Remote Production Manager at Renewal by Andersen.\n\nKen was a remarkable person who touched many lives with his kindness, generosity, and humor. He loved to provide surprises, joy, and support to everyone he met. He always had a smile on his face. He was an incredible human being who inspired us to be better and to live fully.\n\nHe will be greatly missed by his family, friends, colleagues, and all who knew him. He leaves behind a legacy of love, laughter, and happiness that will never be forgotten. We are grateful for the time we had with him, and we hope he is at peace.\n\nKen’s family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of his care providers who supported him throughout his journey.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Ken’s memory may be made to the Hartford HealthCare Cancer Institute, (https://giving.hartfordhospital.org/donate/)."
