        "text": "Logan Dale Thomas\n\nApril 2, 1954 – May 30, 2024\n\nIt is with profound sadness and deepest sorrow that the family of Logan Dale Thomas (age 70) announce his passing early Thursday morning, May 30, 2024 at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center in Waxahachie. Following a brief, but very aggressive battle with cancer, Dale was called home to Heaven to be reunited with his loved ones gone before him, and our Lord in eternal rest. His last days were spent surrounded by an abundance of love and support from family and friends, both near and far, and he took his final breath and left this world peacefully.\n\nBorn in Plainview, Texas to the late Charles Hugh Thomas and Patsy Lavern (Carter) Pruitt on April 2, 1954, Dale was raised predominantly throughout New Mexico and Texas along with his two brothers and two sisters. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in September of 1972, and served in Camp Pendelton, California, Okinawa, Japan, the Philippines, and Arlington, Virginia. A graduate of Big Sandy High School, Dale returned home to Texas to study real estate and criminal justice at Tyler Junior College where he graduated with his associate’s degree.\n\nIt is there that he met the absolute love of his life, Mary Harvey Thomas, and the two were married shortly thereafter on January 26, 1980 at the First Christian Church in Mineola, Texas. Together, they built a home, a family, and a beautiful life filled with love, laughter, and the joyous hustle and bustle of raising their three children: Jessica, Jeremy, and Jenna. Dale labored as a professional truck driver, heavy-duty equipment operator, machinist, and talented welder. His unparalleled work-ethic and personal sacrifices helped ensure his family was continuously provided for and given every advantage and opportunity in life.\n\nA devoted father, Dale spent most of his free time with his children— riding bikes, playing catch, fishing, and camping. He was very involved in their various interests, volunteering to coach most of their little league and softball teams, as well as assist with band and Boy Scouts. His grandchildren were his greatest pride and joy, and it was no secret whatsoever that they each had him tightly wrapped around their little fingers. A gun enthusiast and avid outdoorsman, Dale’s passionate pursuits included fishing and hunting— although Mary liked to lovingly joke that he never killed anything but time! He was a devout Christian, and faithful member of the Cowboy Church of Ellis County.\n\nDale’s spirit of kindness and generosity extended well beyond his family. A genuine soul with a lighthearted demeaner, his smile and sunny disposition were infectious, and those that were fortunate enough to be loved by him, know that he did so unconditionally and beyond measure. Dale never knew a stranger, and would often greet friends and new acquaintances alike with affectionate monikers such as “cowboy”, “catfish”, “stinky” and “meanie”. While his family, friends, and community all now grieve the painful void his absence leaves behind, they relish the countless fond memories of his unique journey and the indelible imprint his life has left upon the world. They rejoice in the fact that he is no longer in pain and has found comfort and solace in our Lord’s, and Mary’s, sweet embrace.\n\nHe is preceded in peace by his parents, Charles Hugh Thomas and Patsy Laverne (Carter) Pruitt; his sister, Brenda Lucas; and his forever love, Mary Harvey Thomas.\n\nHis memory and legacy live on in his surviving family members: brothers, Jackie Lynn Thomas and Randall Vincent Pruitt; sister, Terri Tucker; children, Jessica Thomas Gilmore (and husband Ken), Jeremy Michael Thomas, Jenna Louise Thomas (and husband Connor); grandchildren, Ryleigh Mia Gilmore, Teagan Marie Lowrance, Jackson Thomas Gilmore, Jameson Colt Gilmore, and Grayson Reign Gilmore, as well as scores of friends and community members whose lives were enriched by Dale’s kindness and humor."
