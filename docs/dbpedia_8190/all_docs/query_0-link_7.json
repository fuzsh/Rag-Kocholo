        "text": "Dan Smith, aka Dan Under, is a New Zealand tattooist and musician. At the age of six, he moved to Auckland. Spending his childhood captured by music, Dan played in many bands all the way up until his early twenties. In 2001, after an intensive visual tattoo education from Dean Parkin and Dan Andersen of Sacred Tattoo in Auckland, Dan began traveling playing music and pursuing his self-taught tattoo career, spending the most part of two years in Australia. In 2004, Dan moved to Los Angeles, California. In 2006 he started the alternative/new wave band The Dear & Departed. Signing to Science Records saw the release of their first LP Something Quite Peculiar. In 2008 he was invited to work at Kat Von D's world famous tattoo shop High Voltage Tattoo in Hollywood. In 2009 he was picked up to be a feature on the hit TLC television show LA Ink. Smith appears as one of the main artists during the third and fourth seasons of the show. In January 2010, The Dear & Departed released an EP on Equal Vision Records called Chapters and set out on a relentless touring schedule. The Dear & Departed are set to record their next LP in August/September of this year.\n\nAlex Binnie was born Alexander Michael Steven Binnie, on 11 July 1959, in Oxford, England. He is primarily known as a tattooist, and is also a printmaker; he has been a musician and performance artist. As a tattoo artist he is known for being one of a group of artists who originated and popularized the use of large-scale tribal design (non-western, often Polynesian, and also involving elements of fusion across regional boundaries and traditions) in the West. His work reached a wide public with the publication of 1000 Tattoos by Henk Schiffmacher."
