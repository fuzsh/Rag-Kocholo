        "text": "Pendleton Herring, a political scientist, writer and foundation executive who did pioneering work in the study of American politics, died on Tuesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 100. The cause was pneumonia, his son James said.\n\nAs a scholar, Dr. Herring worked to understand the basic mechanics of government and to apply rigor to the emerging study of political science.\n\n''Group Representation before Congress'' (Johns Hopkins, 1929) was the first scholarly study of American interest groups. In ''Public Administration and the Public Interest'' (McGraw-Hill, 1936), he examined the effects of lobbying.\n\nIn his most influential work, ''The Politics of Democracy: American Parties in Action'' (Norton, 1940), he analyzed the history of American politics and argued that its improvised, decentralized political parties work better in the American system than the more programmatic, disciplined parties that many reformers have called for."
