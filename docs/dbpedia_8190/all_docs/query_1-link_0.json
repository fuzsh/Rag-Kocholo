By the time he was 14, he knew art would be his life's driving force. At 20, he apprenticed at The World Famous Bert Grimm's tattoo parlor under Rick Walters, a well-respected artist. Then, after taking a few years off to pursue sculpting, airbrushing, set design and computer graphics, Thomas jumped at the chance to work in Hart & Huntington's unique environment. A true artist with a personality to match, Thomas is charming and hip, with a smile that never lets you forget he's a bad boy. When John Huntington departed, Thomas and Carey Hart formed a new partnership. Thomas is a key factor in the look, vibe, and brand that will either make or break the Hart & Huntington shop."
