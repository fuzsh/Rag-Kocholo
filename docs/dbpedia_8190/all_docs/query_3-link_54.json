        "text": "Louis Schwabe was born on 27 August 1831 at Manchester, the son of Louis and Eliza (Thackeray) Schwabe. He was baptised on 23 September at St. Anne’s.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Blanche Hartwright in April 1864 at Chorlton, Lancashire.\n\nLouis died on 30 April 1922 at Hart Hill, Eccles Road in Pendleton.\n\nElizabeth Blanche was born on 10 November 1843 in Manchester, the daughter of William Hartwright (1787 – 1854) and Elizabeth Giles (1804 – 1875). She died on 7 December 1921 at Hart Hill, Eccles Road in Pendleton. For more on the Hartwright family click here.\n\nThe children of Louis and Blanche are:\n\nHENRY THACKERAY;\n\nLOUIS GUSTAVE;\n\nCONSTANCE BLANCHE SCHWABE, was born in 1869;\n\nARTHUR PERCY SCHWABE, was born in June 1877 and died on 11 May 1879, at Leaf Street, Pendleton, Manchester;\n\nIRENE ROSALIE SCHWABE, was born in 1872 and died on 8 August 1937, at Friars Croft Park Drive, Hale; and\n\nCLIFFORD SCHWABE\n\nDOROTHY\n\nGEORGE BOWSTEAD SCHWABE 1883 -1909\n\nNOTE: The secretary of the Cross Street Unitarian chapel at Manchester has provided the following listing of baptisms at the chapel which include Louis’ children and which can be read HERE (<— in PDF). Unfortunately he transcribes ‘George Boustead’ as ‘George Boris’ which has been the cause of some confusion.\n\nThe following press clipping which has been transcribed has passed down through the family and quotes Louis Schwabe’s recollections of an event involving his father Louis Schwabe (1798 – 1845). Unfortunately, the clipping comes undated and without the source.\n\nMr. Louis Schwabe, whose name was mentioned by Mr. Hewitt in last week’s “City News,” lived at No.1, Plymouth Grove, and his son, also named Louis Schwabe, dwelt there some seven years, from about the year 1839. The latter is, therefore, one of the oldest surviving of the former residents in that locality. His father was a manufacturer of silks in Portland street. He remembers the chains and posts which have so frequently been referred to, and also a number of the former inhabitants, including Mr. Mackay, who was Mayor of Manchester, and Mr. S. L. Behrens. In regard to the latter he states:\n\n“My father once saved three of his sons from drowning. The boys were coming home from school in Dover street and went to skate on the pool; the ice gave way, and they were plunged into the water. My father at once took off his coat and succeeded in rescuing all three. We have at home a silver goblet given by Mr. S. L. Behrens to my father in commemoration of this event.”\n\nMr. Schwabe is now eighty-two years of age and his recollections of the district are, therefore, of special interest. X. Y. Z. [Note: If Louis Schwabe was 82 at the time this article was written then it must have been written 1912-1913].\n\nSubsequent to the above the original article about the incident has been recovered from The Manchester Guardian for 1 December 1838 below:\n\nBelow, Hart Hill the Schwabe family home from the 1880’s to 1925 when it was sold to Salford City Council and demolished in 1927.\n\nJames Dugdale lived at Hart Hill for a short period of six years, moving to the Wroxall Abbey estate in 1865 where he spent the rest of his days. After Dugdale left Hart Hill was bought by Thomas Hornby Birley in 1865 where he died in 1885. After that, it was bought its final resident, Louis Schwabe. It should be noted that Louis’ cousin Gustav Christian Schwabe married Helen Dugdale, a daughter (?) of John’s.\n\nBelow, Louis’ baptism certificate:\n\nSome Census Data: 1861\n\n1871 page one\n\n1871 page two\n\n1881 Page One\n\n1881 Page Two\n\n1891 (very last line) Page One\n\n1891 – continued –\n\n1901 Census\n\n1911 Census\n\nSOME PROBATE RECORDS\n\nLouis Schwabe’s\n\nElizabeth Blanche Schwabe’s\n\nTheir daughter Irene Rosalie’s\n\nGEORGE BOUSTEAD / BOWSTEAD SCHWABE\n\nSo far we have been unable to locate a record for the birth of George. His middle name is of interest as explained on the Boustead – Schwabe page on this website HERE. He died quite young (26) and his death was announced in the Manchester Guardian on 23 March 1909:\n\nHis funeral was noted in a local newspaper below. What is of interest too is the reference to Louis Breslauer among the ‘chief mourners’ and his son Edwin Breslauer. Louis was the brother of Adolphus Breslauer who married Theresa Reis. Theresa’s brother Alphonse Louis Reis was the grandfather of Allwynne Reis who married Frank Otto Stoe Man.\n\nManchester Courier – Friday 26 March 1909: The Late Lieutenant G. B. Schwabe. The funeral of the late Lieutenant Schwabe took place yesterday in Monton Unitarian Churchyard. Lieutenant Schwabe was the fourth son of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Schwabe, of Hart Hill, Eccles Old-road, Pendleton, and died on Sunday at the early age of twenty-six years. It was the desire of Mr. and Mrs. that the funeral of their son should take place in a quiet and an unostentatious manner, but Lieutenant Schwabe’s comrades requested that they should be allowed to pay their last respects a popular officer, and consequently the family gave their consent a military interment. The coffin was placed on gun carriage drawn by six horses, and it was accompanied the following officers of the 7th Lancashire Fusiliers: Colonel Sir Lees Knowles, Bart., Lieutenant-Colonel N. Humphreys, Lieutenant-Colonel F. B. Surgeon-Major N. M. Hamilton, Captain A. E. H. Penning, Captain J. L. Swainson, Captain C. T. Alexander, Captain H. C. Holden, Captain A. Berry, Captain W. Cartwright, Captain J. G. Needham, and Lieutenant Col. Lecomber. In addition, about a hundred the regiment also accompanied the cortege. The chief mourners were Mr. Louis Schwabe (father), Mr. H. Thackeray Schwabe, Mr. L. Gustav Schwabe, Mr. Clifford Schwabe (brothers). Dr. Stewart (brother-in-law), Master Hugh Stewart and Master Kenneth Stewart (nephews), Mr. Louis S. and Mr. Edwin H. Breslauer. There were also present Mr. J. Hall, Mr. J. H. Hall, Mr. Leaf, Mr. Walter Leaf, Mr. C. J. Collman, Mr. J. R. Chapman, Mr. J. H. Byatt, F. Mr. C. B. Heron, Mr. Walter Schulz, Mr. H. Sassen. The private carriages followed of Sir Lees Knowles, Mr. Shearman, and Mrs. Pritchard. Many floral offerings were sent by relatives, friends, and the officers and men the 7th Lancashire Fusiliers. The Rev Neander Atiderton conducted the MW» and read the committal at c. A firing party, under command Captain Cartwright consisting of forty men from Lieutenant G. B. Schwabe’s company, fired the usual volleys. The arrangements were entrusted to the care of Messrs. Satterfield, Bye and Co., Manchester.\n\nGeorge’s death registry is below. It shows that he died from a coma induced by Diabetes Mellitus and that the certificate was signed by his brother in law Dr. Alexander Stewart.\n\nGeorge’s probate record is below.\n\nCONSTANCE BLANCHE SCHWABE MARRIAGE TO ALEXANDER STEWART\n\nConstance married Alexander Stewart MD on 18 June 1891 at St Luke’s near Eccles, Salford, Lancashire. He was 36 and she 23.\n\nWhile residing at South Bank, Eccles Road, Pendelton they had at least the following children:\n\nHugh Louis Garth Stewart\n\nKenneth Alexander Stewart -Baptism: 19 November 1893 St Luke, Weaste, Lancs.\n\nMargaret Blanche Stewart – Baptism 2 December 1894 St Luke, Weaste, Lancs.\n\nConstance Olga Stewart was born on 8 August 1898 and died unmarried in June 1980 at Ludlow, Shropshire.\n\n1911 Census\n\nThe family has been found on the 1911 census:\n\nAlexander Stewart died 19 July 1917\n\nKenneth Alexander Stewart – 27, Cotton Merchant, Bachelor, Hollywood Pendleton married Kathleen Fletcher – 28, Spinster, 10 The Polygon Eccles.
