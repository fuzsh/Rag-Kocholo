        "text": "Edmund Pendleton (born Sept. 9, 1721, Caroline County, Virginia—died Oct. 26, 1803, Caroline County, Va., U.S.) was a Virginia patriot during the American Revolution.\n\nPendleton’s father and grandfather died the year of his birth, and the young man grew up without paternal care. Apprenticed at the age of 14 to the clerk of the Caroline County court, Pendleton acquired a legal education, and in 1741 he was admitted to the bar.\n\nIn 1751 Pendleton became a justice of the peace, and the following year he was elected to the House of Burgesses. A conservative, he clashed repeatedly with Patrick Henry (whom Pendleton considered a demagogue) over Henry’s radical opposition to the Stamp Act and other divisive issues between Britain and the American colonies. Pendleton did charge that Parliament had exceeded its authority in passing the Stamp Act, and he soon emerged as a leader among the patriots.\n\nSelected in 1773 as a member of Virginia’s Committee of Correspondence, Pendleton represented the colony at the first Continental Congress in 1774. In 1775 he served as president of the Virginia Committee of Public Safety, which acted as a temporary government during the critical period just prior to independence. At the Virginia convention of 1776, Pendleton drew up the instructions to Virginia’s representatives in Congress, directing them to propose a declaration of independence. He later helped revise the laws of Virginia and helped draft the state’s first constitution."
