        "text": "GENERATION 1 and 2\n\nThomas AVERY (1679-ca.1710) died before 24 Nov. 1711, who was born around 1679 to Thomas and Hannah Miner Avery, married Ann SHAPLEY on July 12 1704. Ann was born in 1685; died June 17, 1751; daughter of Benjamin and Mary Picket Shapley.\n\nAfter her husband Thomas AVERY died around 1710, his widow, Ann (SHAPLEY) AVERY, married a Jonathan ROSS. \"In the inventory of the estate of Thomas AVERY, taken at New London, 11 Dec. 1711, the widow is called Ann RUFF (or RUSS) and the children are Thomas, aged 6, and Ann, age 4.\" She may have married a third time to a James Morgan.\n\nThomas and Ann Shapley Avery had 2 known children: Thomas AVERY (1705-1712); Ann AVERY (b. 1707).\n\nSon, Thomas AVERY, was born 31 March 1705. He died 3 July 1712 \"while swimming.\"\n\nDaughter, Ann AVERY, was born 12 May 1707 at Montville, New London Co., CT; she was baptized on May 25th at the 1st Church of New London. Ann married Samuel GRIFFING Nov 16, 1727 at New London, CT by the Rev. Eliphalet Adams of the First Church. Intention of marriage was published in New Long on June 18, 1727.\n\nSam and Ann Avery Griffing had two sons, Samuel \"Griffin\" and Thomas \"Griffin\". Samuel Griffing, died 10 years after marrying Ann Avery. Samuel GRIFFIN (June 8, 1705-1737; baptized First Church New London June 10, 1705) was a mariner. He was lost at sea before 27 January 1737. After Samuel died Ann married her cousin Sylvanus MINER (b. March 3, 1709) on October 6th of the same year at Stonington CT. Sylvanus was the son of Thomas and Hannah (AVERY) MINER. Sylvanus MINER and Ann moved ultimately to Nova Scotia where Sylvanus died on March 15, 1786 in Stonington at the fine age of 77 years.\n\nFrom: http://www.rootsweb.com/~ctnewlon/billc1700.html\n\n\"Samuel GRIFFIN (1728-1800) m. 28 March 1753 Desire, dau. of Peter CRARY; and Thomas GRIFFIN married 20 Sept. 1753 to Jerusha CHIPMAN. - COLLECTIONS of the NEW YORK GENEALOGICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY, Vol. VI, Part II, \"Register of Pedigrees\", V.II, p.134-135; Wurts' MAGNA CHARTA, v.5, pp.1368-1370.\"\n\n1) GENERATION 3 - THOMAS GRIFFIN\n\nSon THOMAS GRIFFIN (born 27 November 1730), married Jerusha CHIPMAN (born Sept 10, 1730) on 20 Sep 1753, Stonington CT. Jerusha was the widow of James Shipman, who died at sea. Thomas and Jerusha married at the First Congregational Church in Stonington, Conn. Rev. Ebenezer Rosseter performed the ceremony. Thomas and Jerusha had several children: Ann Griffin; Mary Griffin married 1779 to Elnathan Mason; James Chipman Griffin; Deborah Griffin; and Thomas Griffin, Jr. (October 12, 1766-1844) who married Mary \"Polly\" Brown, dau. of Simeon Brown.\n\nTheir son Thomas Jr. enlisted as a private on the first of May in 1781, serving in Captain William Latham's company/Colonel William Ledyard's Connecticut Regiment. Stationed at Ft. Griswold, Groton, CT, he was in the engagement that resulted in the British capture of Ft. Griswold on 6 September 1781. Thomas was taken prisoner, carried to NY where he was \"exchanged\" and ultimately discharged one year after he enlisted (1 May 1782). He was allowed a pension (application executed 9 October 1832 at which time he was living in Breckfield, Madison County, NY.) He died there 19 July 1844. He married 3 November 1790 at Stonington to Mary \"Polly\" Brown. On 13 February 1838, he gave a deposition as part of the pension application of his sister, Mary MASON, widow of Elnathan MASON. Pension File #W.19537 (see also pension #W.15842 Elnathan MASON). From: http://www.rootsweb.com/~ctnewlon/billc1700.html\n\n2) GENERATION 3 - SAMUEL GRIFFIN\n\nSamuel, his wife Desire [Crary], pioneers of the Penobscot region together with their children Elisah, Peleg, and infant daughter are re-interred here in Bowditch Cemetery, Searsport; monument was placed by his descendants October 1908.\n\nDESIRE CRARYdaughter of Peter and Ann Culver Crary, married SAMUEL GRIFFIN (born 27 Sep 1727 or 28; died 1800) on 28 March 1753 in Stonington, CT. Although the date of birth is unknown for Desire, she was christened on 26 Oct 1729.SAMUEL GRIFFIN, fought in the French and Indian War and later moved to Prospect. Per The Story of Stockton Springs, Maine by Alice V. Ellis, Samuel Griffin moved his family in 1775 to Stockton and they traveled by a schooner owned by Capt. Benjamin Pendleton. During the first winter in Stockton they lived with the Job Pendelton family on Brigadier Island (Sears Island). Samuel was a mason and a carpenter by trade by built his family a home in the wilderness in Searsport, adjoining Stockton Harbor. This is now called the Park District, per Alice Ellis. He built a store near his home but it was robbed three times by Tories. The family settled in their home in April of 1775. The Griffins were Quakers who diligently tried to be friendly with both the British and the Colonial Settlers.\n\nPer Alice Ellis' book, A schooner was pirated and burned in Mill Stream at Brand's Point shortly after Samuel moved to the Stockton area. 20 men were taken from the schooner to Sandy Head and murdered. The pirates left their decaying bodies on shore just above the die line. Settlers buried the bodies. Legend: Samuel and sons Elisha and Eben went fishing one night when a pirate attack upon another vessel occurred...but it was an apparition of the Brand's Point piracy!\n\n1) GENERATION 4- CHILDREN OF SAMUEL AND DESIRE\n\nPer Alice Ellis in The Story of Stockton Springs, Maine:\n\nBritish officers befriended the Griffins when they were stationed in Castine. An officer who liked young Nathan Griffin (13 years old then) gave him an English musket. Levi Griffin relates this story in the book....\n\nDucks flew further south seeking food as that winter was harsh. Rabbits and partridges were scarce due to the bitter cold. Having come right after poor crops, the larder was short of meat. While on Brigadier (Sears) Island Nathan spotted moose tracks in the snow. That night under a clear moonlit sky, Nathan hid in a thicket with his musket. The moose appeared near the spring; Nathan shot it, restoring the larder for the winter!\n\nNOTES on Children of Desire and Samuel:\n\nEbenezer (Eben) Griffin stayed in the Penobscot Bay area. Only Eben and Nathan did so. Eben did not go to sea, but instead became a builder. Part of his land is on Turnpike Road (my ancestors lived on this road also). Per Alice Ellis book, he was born in 1761 and married Lydia Pendleton. He died 1849.\n\nSamuel Griffin Jr. born in New London, CT ; died in VA. At the close of the Revolution, Samuel, Jr., moved to Virginia and married there. Two of his descendants may be William W. Griffin, President of First National Bank of Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Ella Griffin of Virginia, wife of Peleg S. Staples of Stockton, Maine.\n\nElisha Griffin never married.\n\nWilliam Griffin born in Groton, CT. Moved to Belfast 1796 and moved to Copley in Boon County, OH about 1825. He married Hannah Miller, daughter of one of the Proprietors of Belfast, Maine - James and Mary Alexander Miller. Hannah was born 3/21/1763. They had a large family. She died in Copley May 2nd, 1816 per History of the City of Belfast in the State of Maine by Joseph Williamson. The Griffin Farm in Copley Ohio was settled by pioneer William Griffin on Lot 11 in the NW part of Copley Township in 1827, consisting of 162 acres purchased from Gardner Green, an agent for the Connecticut Land Company. Per the Historical Souvenir Book of Copley Township 1819-1969, William and Hannah had 10 children, one of whom was a James M. Griffin born in 1800, who had a son Alonzo J. Griffin born in 1833; died 1917. James M. Griffin in the Spring of 1850 was traveling by horse to California for the gold rush there. At St. Joseph, Missouri, James was training a young horse to ride westward. The horse threw him and injured him severely, leading to his death within a short time. James' body was not returned to Ohio. A son of James was Harry J. Griffin. Isabel Morse Maresh of Belmont, Maine has a Samuel born January 10, 1791 in Maine as a son of William and Hannah(Miller)Griffin.\n\n(Question? Are the two men who were re-interred in the Copley Cemetery Section 2, Lot 81, Ohio, this William and Samuel, William, husband of Hannah, and Samuel, their son?)\n\n(Question? Did William Griffin marry a second time?)\n\nNathan Griffin born 30 March 1763 Stonington CT married Elizabeth Treat (daughter of Joshua and Catherine James Treat) on 10 Dec 1789. Stayed in the Penobscot Bay area. He settled in Stockton Springs, as a farmer and fisherman, where he is said to have many descendants still living there (Per Jane Mercier). Elizabeth died at Prospect January 22, 1837. He died Feb. 5, 1854.\n\nPeleg Griffin died in childhood.\n\nDesire Griffin born 15 March 1767 in Stonington CT, died 3 Dec. 1856. She married Peleg Decrow/Deckro in 1796.\n\nIsaac Griffin born 1769 in Stonington CT married Olive Benson. Isaac built his home in Searsport near the bar that leads to Sears Island. The home burned down in 1806 per Alice Ellis' book.\n\nJesse Griffin born 1772 in Stonington CT; died at age 25.\n\nNotes from \"Republican Journal article by C. S. Griffin in 1889:\n\nDesire was of Scotch parentage and had one brother and one sister. The sister married a Colonel Gallop of the British army. The brother Joseph Crary, \"Old Esquire Crary,\" was a LT in the Revolutionary War. Joseph was on board a vessel that took out \"letters of mark and they took a number of prizes.\" This means that the sister and the brother were on different sides of the war and Desire, being married to Samuel, reputed to be a Quaker per this article, was on the middle ground.\n\nArticle states that the Griffins are of Welsh origin. Llewellyn Griffith was King of Wales and surrendered to Edward the First of England in 1660.. Llewellyn's brother David Griffin tried to rebuild the kingdom, was defeated, and burned at the stake in London. Then Edward the Second was declared Prince of Wales.\n\nThe ancestors of the Maine Griffins reportedly came from Holy Wells, or Holliwell, in Wales.\n\nA) Son Ebenezer \"Eben\" Griffin was born on the 29th of January in 1758 in Stonington, CT.

His wife Hannah was born March 21, 1763 in LONDONDERRY NH (not Belfast Maine), a daughter of James Miller (born 1712 in Belfast, Ireland) who was one of the original settlers of Belfast, Maine allegedly the first, arriving there May 20th, 1770. Hannah's mother was Mary Alexander Miller, born Nov. 14, 1722 in Londonderry also.\n\nJANUARY 2009: Her father James was born in 1712 in Belfast, Ireland. James and others from Londonderry, New Hampshire sailed in 1770 supposedly to Belfast, Maine. When they landed on Saturday at what they believed was Belfast they soon discovered they were actually several miles down the coast at what they later designated as \"Saturday Cove\" Northport, Maine\n\nMiller Street in Belfast Maine is named after him. James was an Inn owner. He drew Lot #38 and Lot #37. His son, Robert Miller built the first house on the lot which now houses the Belfast Free Library. Interestingly, when this new settlement was being formed, it was a toss up, literally, between calling it Londonderry Maine or Belfast, Maine after Belfast Ireland. Much discussion and a coin toss led to it being called \"Belfast.\" James Miller was born about 1712 in Belfast, Ireland, the eldest son of Alexander Miller.\n\nWilliam and Hannah Miller Griffin's children: George, Mary, Anna, Hannah, Jenney, Robert, David, William, James:\n\nInformation on son, WILLIAM GRIFFIN, son of William and Hannah Miller Griffin, per the Vital Records of Belfast Maine to the Year 1892, Vol. 1 - Births: William was born on July 13, 1796.\n\nInformation on son, DAVID GRIFFIN, son of William and Hannah Miller Griffin, per the Vital Records of Belfast Maine to the Year 1892, Vol. 1 - Births: David was a twin born on November 8, 1798.
