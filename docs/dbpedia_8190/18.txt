Biography

Thomas Pendleton was born 3 Jan 1718/19 at Westerly., Rhode Island, the first child of James Pendleton (1693-1753) and his second wife, Elizabeth (Brown) Pendleton (1694-aft.1776); [1] died at Deer Island, New Brunswick, 23 Mar 1806, [2] while on a visit to his sons. [3]

Thomas married at Block Island, Rhode Island, 21 Oct 1743, Dorcas Dodge, born on Block Island, 11 Feb 1722, daughter of Nathaniel & Margaret (Pullin) Dodge]. [2] [4] [5]

Excerpt from the Brown Genealogy:

On 8 Mar 1742/43, "Caleb Pendleton, grandfather, & James Pendleton, father," deeded to Thomas Pendleton, husbandman, of Westerly, about three hundred acres of land in that town. [W. L. E., IV, 44]. He was admitted freeman at Westerly, 1 May 1744, and with "Darkis" Pendleton witnessed receipt given to Benoni Smith by Jonathan Brown, 6 Mar 1747, for the legacy of the latter's wife received in the will of Caleb Pendleton [Westerly C. & P. Rec., III, 330].[5]

Narrative from Brian Pendleton and His Descendants:

Tradition says that Thomas Pendleton was a whalerman, and that on one of his voyages to Greenland, he put in at Castine, where, excited by the beauty of the Penobscot Bay region, he determined to settle. In the probating of Col. Joseph Pendleton's estate, 1761, he received £101, which may have been due him as the master of one of the Colonel's vessels. At any rate, he removed to what is now Islesboro, Me., a few years before the Revolution, and when he had established himself there, he brought his entire family to the island, with the exception of his son, Nathaniel, who followed later.

It has been claimed tht the son, Samuel, was at Islesboro before his father, but there does not seem to be any way of proving which was the first settler. The statements in History of Islesborough upon this point are very conflicting, as on page 9 it says, "Without doubt, Samuel Pendleton came here with Shubael Williams of Stonington, Conn., in September, 1764, and settled on the east side."[6] On the next page, however, it states that Thomas Pendleton came in 1775, with sons Samuel, Gideon, etc., while on page 249, it is affirmed that Thomas Pendleton came to the island in 1766, and took up 900 acres, and that his whole family soon followed and settled upon his land. The records of the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County, R. I. (Book II, pp. 48, 79, 269), however, show that Thomas Pendleton, "mariner", was engaged in various law-suits in Rhode Island from August, 1769, to August, 1771, at Westerly. These facts would indicate that Thomas did not locate at Islesboro as early as has been generally supposed. He may of course have taken up land there before this as a preliminary toward making a settlement, but the actual date of his leaving the old home of the family must have been later than August, 1771.

At the first town meeting held at Islesboro, 6 Apr 1789, Capt. Thomas Pendleton was elected surveyor of highways. He took an active interest in town affairs and his name often appears in the early records. On the 14th of August, 1789, Thomas and his wife received from their son, Stephen Pendleton, a release of "The land they now live on, rent free" (Hancock Co. Deeds, v. 513).

The descendants of Thomas Pendleton are exceedingly numerous and are scattered all over the United States and Canada. They have been mostly interested in farming, shipping, and lumbering, in which latter pursuits some of the more enterprising have accumulated wealth. Of his six sons, Samuel was the only one to remain at Islesboro; Joshua and Nathaniel removed to Northport, Me., while the other three settled at Deer Island, N. B.[3]

Thomas Pendleton and Dorcas Dodge had ten children, as profiled in the Brown Genealogy, [7] and Maine Families in 1790: [8] the first six, in all likelihood, born at Westerly, Rhode Island, the others at Stonington, Connecticut:
