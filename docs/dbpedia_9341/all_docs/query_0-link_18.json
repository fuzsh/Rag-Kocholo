        "text": "ItIt is a situation that has existed for decades but one which has been largely ignored, even hidden: France is the only country in the world which still manages the currencies of its former colonies. More than 70 years after 14 African countries achieved their “independence” from France, they are still using the 'CFA franc' currency which remains under the effective control of the Ministry of Finance in Paris. More and more people in Africa are beginning to criticise a situation which is seen as perpetuating French domination over those countries. In addition many economists warn that the FCFA, as it is known in French, is holding back economic development in the countries that use it.\n\nManaging cookies\n\nWe use cookies on our website, and similar technology on our mobile apps, which allow us to collect data about your device and usage of the site.
