        "text": "Depositing is not exactly “paying”. In fact, the Banque de France paid interest on that money and is currently transferring it back to African central banks (as part of a broader transition out of the system you describe). The so-called “centralization” of currency reserves was designed as a counterpart for the fixed exchange rate and total convertibility. The notion is that the French treasury needed a way to gauge the state of each country's currency reserves and assess the risk it was assuming by extending this guarantee.\n\nIn practice, it means that France promised that anyone holding CFA Franc could receive French Francs and then Euros at the advertised rate. It also means that if a state using the CFA Franc was unable to pay for imports with foreign currency, France would step in. Clearly, that guarantee is not trivial and is one reason why these African countries would consent to rather onerous requirements.\n\nHistorically, it was of course part of a system of post-colonial dependence orchestrated by France for its own benefit (and that of the local elites) including economic and security/military agreements, foreign investment and government contracts, and more covert influence in both directions (some French politicians benefited from illegal campaing funding from African leaders who in return had a real influence on the French government). That could be regarded as an additional political reason both for the long existence of this system and for its recent reform. Most former French colonies were part of this but Guinea famously wasn't.\n\nWhether that's a good idea politically or economically is another question. There are many reasons why pegging your money to another currency or to a metal is a bad idea. That's equally true for countries doing that unilaterally (say Lebanon or Argentina), quite apart from the peculiar setup of the CFA Franc. On the other hand, if you do want to maintain a fixed exchange rate, having the government of the larger and more stable economy vouch for it would protect you from the kind of crisis Lebanon is facing right now.\n\nFrame challenge:\n\nIf your local currency is nonexistent or very weak (bad convertibility, inflation), most of your economy likely be USD-based, so you will need to buy those dollars from the USA, likely on worse conditions than France offers for CFA franc. Argentine now faces this with its push to use USD instead of Argentinean peso.\n\nBefore the end of gold standard, you actually need to hold gold to have your economy function. So you needed to sell stuff for gold first, to have any on you to participate in (monetary) economy.\n\nSo I assume that CFA franc fills the niche between a fully sovereign currency (such as the use of Chinese Yuan in China) and a complete dependency on a foreign currency you do not control (such as USD use by Ecuador)."
