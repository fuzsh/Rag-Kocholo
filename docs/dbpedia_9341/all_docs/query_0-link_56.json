        "text": "Portuguese first visited Guinea in the 1400s and the Islamic Fulani Empire controlled the interior until the 1800s. France proclaimed a protectorate over part of the area on April 5, 1849, over the coastal Rivi?res du Sud on October 12, 1882. French Guinea became a separate French colony on December 17, 1891. On March 10, 1893, a French decree separated Dahomey (Benin) and Cote d'Ivoire from French Guinea, making them separate colonies. French Guinea became part of French West Africa on June 16, 1895. Guinea gained its independence on October 2, 1958, choosing not to join the French Community.\n\nThe French Franc was introduced in French Guinea in the 1800s when Guinea was part of Senegal. The Banque de l'Afrique Occidentale issued its own banknotes (XAOF) beginning on June 29, 1901. Banknotes and coins from the Banque de France (FRG) also were allowed to circulate in French West Africa, and all monies of Metropolitan France were given legal tender status in French West Africa on August 8, 1920.\n\nGuinea was a primary source of gold for Europe and this is the reason why British gold coins were called the Guinea. Some British coins and Maria Theresa Thalers also circulated until the 1920s. On December 26, 1945, the Franc des Colonies Francaises d'Afrique (CFA Franc-XCOF) was introduced, and the circulation of Banque de France banknotes was no longer tolerated. From 1945 until 1958, banknotes of the Banque de l'Afrique Occidentale circulated in Guinea. The Franc was divisible into 100 Centimes.\n\nGuinea introduced its Franc (GNI) at par with the CFA Franc on October 2, 1958. On March 1, 1960 when it withdrew from the Franc zone. The Syli (GNS) replaced the Franc at par on October 2, 1972 with 1 Syli equal to 10 Francs. On January 6, 1986, Guinea issued a New Franc (GNF). Although it was officially issued at par with the Syli, the introduction of the Franc was accompanied by a 92.47% currency devaluation. The Banque de la Republique de Guinea issued banknotes between 1958 and 1960, and the Banque Centrale de la Republique de Guinea issued banknotes beginning on March 1, 1960."
