        "text": "Currency in French Polynesia\n\nThe official currency of French Polynesia is the French Pacific franc (XPF). This currency is used throughout the islands and is accepted at all businesses and financial institutions. However, US dollars are also widely accepted, particularly in tourist areas such as Papeete (the capital of French Polynesia) and at larger hotels and resorts.\n\nExchange Rates\n\nExchange rates between the US dollar and the French Pacific franc fluctuate, and it is important to check the current rate before exchanging currency. In general, the exchange rate for US dollars is slightly less favorable than the official exchange rate for the French Pacific franc. This means that when exchanging US dollars, you may receive slightly fewer francs for your money than you would if you were exchanging francs. However, the difference is typically not significant and can vary depending on the exchange rate at the time.\n\nDenominations Accepted\n\nWhen using US dollars in French Polynesia, it is important to note that not all denominations of US currency will be accepted. Most businesses and financial institutions will only accept bills that are in good condition. This means that bills that are worn, damaged, or otherwise not in good condition may not be accepted. Additionally, many businesses may not accept large denominations, such as $100 bills, due to the risk of counterfeit money. It is always best to have smaller denominations of US currency, such as $20 or $50 bills, to ensure that you will be able to make purchases.\n\nPlaces where US dollars are commonly accepted\n\nAs mentioned earlier, US dollars are widely accepted in tourist areas such as Papeete and at larger hotels and resorts. This includes places such as restaurants, shops, and other businesses catering to tourists. However, acceptance of US dollars may be less common in smaller towns and villages, and in general, places such as gas stations, smaller shops and markets that cater to the local population may not accept dollars. It is always best to have some French Pacific francs on hand, just in case,\n\nAlso, it is important to keep in mind that some businesses may offer a less favorable exchange rate for US dollars. This is particularly true at small, locally-owned businesses or street vendors. In such places, it may be best to pay in French Pacific francs to avoid any confusion or potential issues with currency exchange.\n\nUse of Credit/Debit Cards\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that using credit/debit cards is a very common and convenient way to make payments in French Polynesia. Most larger businesses, hotels and resorts and some smaller shops accept major credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard, and you will be able to withdraw cash from most major banks in French Polynesia. It is important to check with your bank or credit card company to ensure that your card will be accepted and to find out about any additional fees or charges that may apply.\n\nIn conclusion, US dollars are widely accepted as a means of payment in French Polynesia, particularly in tourist areas such as Papeete and at larger hotels and resorts. However, it is important to keep in mind that the exchange rate for US dollars may be slightly less favorable than the official exchange rate for the French Pacific franc. Additionally, not all denominations of US currency will be accepted, and it is best to have smaller bills in good condition to ensure that you will be able to make purchases. It is also recommended to carry some French Pacific francs, as US dollar acceptance may be less common in smaller towns and villages. Credit and debit cards are also widely accepted and provide a convenient way to make payments. Before your trip, itâ€™s important to check with your bank or credit card company to ensure your card will be accepted and to find out about any additional fees or charges that may apply. Overall, it is important to be prepared with a combination of local currency and other means of payment to ensure a smooth and convenient trip."
