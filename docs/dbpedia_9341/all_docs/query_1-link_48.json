        "text": "Eight West African countries have announced that they will rename their common currency and sever financial links with their former colonial ruler France.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo - known collectively as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) - have all used the CFA franc as their currency.\n\nFor four decades, the CFA franc – named originally as the franc of the French Colonies in Africa – was pegged to the French franc, before being linked to the euro.\n\nCNBC reports that the currency “compels participating African countries to deposit 50% of their foreign exchange reserves with the French treasury”, which “in turn guarantees payments into euros even if the CFA member state cannot meet import payments”.\n\nThis link has meant that the currency has been seen as an important stabilising financial force in the region.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––For a round-up of the most important stories from around the world - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week’s news agenda - try The Week magazine.

These are “a change of name” of the CFR franc to the eco, an end to “holding 50% of the reserves in the French Treasury” and the “withdrawal of French governance” in any aspect related to the newly renamed currency.\n\n“This is a historic day for West Africa,” Ouattara said during a news conference with Macron, who hailed it as a “historic reform”.\n\n“The eco will see the light of day in 2020,” Macron added."
