        "text": "Wrecking BallMiley Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" started life in a writing session between Dr. Luke and Sacha Skarbek intended for Beyonce. However, as the song progressed, they realized that it wouldn't work for her.\n\nLet It GoIdina Menzel\n\nThe Frozen song \"Let It Go\" was recorded in 42 different languages for the movie's foreign releases. This earned it an entry in the 2016 Guinness World Records publication for \"Most Languages Featured on a Single.\"\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick RoadElton John\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" is one of the few Bernie Taupin lyrics that is more about him than Elton John. The song is about giving up glitz for the simple life - not exactly Elton's M.O.\n\nCareless WhisperWham!\n\nGeorge Michael was 17 and on a bus to his job at the cinema when he came up with the idea for \"Careless Whisper\" and the lyrics, \"Something in your eyes calls to mind a silver screen.\"\n\nCasey JonesGrateful Dead\n\nThe Grateful Dead considered \"whipping that chain\" and \"lugging propane,\" but settled on \"high on cocaine\" for \"Casey Jones.\"\n\nGive It AwayRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nIf what you get equals what you give away, you might as well give it all away. That's the concept behind \"Give It Away\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nGreg Lake of Emerson, Lake & PalmerSongwriter Interviews\n\nGreg talks about writing songs of \"universal truth\" for King Crimson and ELP, and tells us about his most memorable stage moment (it involves fireworks).\n\nPrinceFact or Fiction\n\nPrince is shrouded in mystery, making him an excellent candidate for Fact or Fiction. Is he really a Scientologist? Does he own an exotic animal?\n\nJim Adkins of Jimmy Eat WorldSongwriter Interviews\n\nJim talks about the impact of \"The Middle\" and uses a tree metaphor to describe his songwriting philosophy.\n\nSongs About MoviesSong Writing\n\nIron Maiden, Adele, Toto, Eminem and Earth, Wind & Fire are just some of the artists with songs directly inspired by movies - and not always good ones.\n\nYacht Rock QuizFact or Fiction\n\nChristopher Cross with Deep Purple? Kenny Loggins in Caddyshack? A Fact or Fiction all about yacht rock and those who made it."
