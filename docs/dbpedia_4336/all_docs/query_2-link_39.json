        "text": "Channel 5's heartwarming period drama, All Creatures Great and Small, has become an autumn TV staple since it first graced our screens back in 2020, with each comforting series sharing uplifting tales from the lives of beloved characters James Herriot, Helen Alderson and the rest of the Skeldale House gang.\n\nWhile most viewers will know that the series is inspired by real-life vet James Herriot's popular book series, did you know that the characters are based on real people? Keep reading to learn all about the real James, Helen, Siegfried and more...\n\nThe real James Herriot\n\nJames Herriot is actually the pen name for real-life veterinary surgeon James Alfred Wight, who was born in Sunderland in 1916 but moved to Scotland when he was just three years old.\n\nJames, who was known as Alf, remained in Scotland, where he trained as a vet at Glasgow Veterinary College, until briefly returning to Sunderland in 1940 to work at a veterinary practice before relocating to the Yorkshire Dales later that year.\n\nAlf moved to Thirsk after accepting a position at the practice of Donald Sinclair. Like in the Channel 5 show, he both lived and worked with his employer at the practice.\n\nThe surgeon-turned-author enlisted in the RAF in November 1942 but was discharged in July the following year after suffering an injury.\n\nThe real Helen Alderson\n\nThe character Helen Alderson is based on James Alfred Wight's real wife, Joan Danbury.\n\nUnlike her TV counterpart Helen, who is a farmer's daughter, Joan worked as a secretary in a Thirsk corn mill.\n\nJoan was believed to be a very private woman and kept her personal life out of the spotlight.\n\nAfter tying the knot in Thirk's St Mary’s Church in 1941, the couple went on to welcome two children: James, who was born in 1943, and Rosemary, who arrived in 1947.\n\nAlf has his wife to thank for his successful writing career, as it was Joan who encouraged him to pick up the pen when he was 50 years old.\n\nThe real Siegfried Farnon\n\nSiegfried Farnon was inspired by Alf's employer Donald Sinclair, a rural veterinarian who owned a practice at 23 Kirkgate in Thirsk.\n\nDonald, who trained at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, employed Alf to run his practice while serving in the RAF. When Donald was discharged four months later, he asked Alf to stay on in a permanent position.\n\nLike Siegfried, Donald clearly had an affinity with horses and worked as the resident horse vet at Thirsk Racecourse for 50 years as a side job. He was also known to be eccentric and impulsive but also charming and honourable, according to Alf's son James.\n\nAlf and Donald remained friends until the latter's sad passing in 1995. Shortly after the death of his wife of 53 years, Audrey, Donald took his own life at his home Southwoods Hall, near Thirsk. He was survived by his two children, Jan and Alan.\n\nFIND OUT: Why isn't Tristan actor Callum Woodhouse in All Creatures Great and Small series four?\n\nThe real Tristan Farnon\n\nBrian Sinclair, the brother of Donald, was the model for Tristan Farnon.\n\nLike in the show, Brian's veterinary studies weren't exactly smooth sailing. After failing his undergraduate exams at Edinburgh University, he was transferred to Glasgow Veterinary College, where he was expelled for laughing during a pathology class. He later returned to the University and finally graduated, before going on to work at his brother's practice.\n\nIn 1944, Brian enlisted in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and served in India. After achieving the rank of captain, Brian was demobilised in 1946.\n\nMuch like Tristan, Brian was known to be fun-loving and optimistic.\n\nIn 1944, the vet married Sheila Rose Seaton, with whom he welcomed three daughters.\n\nThe real Mrs. Pumphrey\n\nMrs. Pumphrey was based on local socialite Mrs. Marjorie Warner of Sowerby, who much like her fictional counterpart, cherished her beloved Pekingese dog, who was called Bambi rather than Tricky Woo.\n\nMarjorie would thank Alf for his services by sending him luxurious Fortnum & Mason hampers, filled with caviar and other delicacies, according to the late vet's children.\n\nWas there a real Mrs Hall?\n\nWhile Mrs Hall isn't based on a particular person, Alf wrote about two women, Mrs. Weatherall and Mrs. Smith, who Donald employed to help with the cleaning and washing. It's possible that Alf may have drawn on his experiences with these women as inspiration for Mrs Hall in his novels."
