        "text": "Book of the Month is a subscription box in which members choose up to 3 hardcover books to receive each month. Once you become a BOTM BFF, you can receive up to 5 books per month.\n\nYou can sign up here to get your first book for $5.\n\nEvery month, I make (pretty accurate) predictions about which books will be featured by Book of the Month (BOTM). I take a lot of time to research upcoming releases, analyze past selections, and choose books that are solid bets.\n\nWith the last publication date in July being the 30th, I think there will at least be one July 30th pick. From the hints, it looks like The Wedding People will be an August pick. I have included The Wedding People below, but all other July predictions can be found here.\n\nI think the books will likely drop next week on July 29, 30, or 31. I have an inkling that July 30th will be the date.\n\nContemporary & Literary Fiction\n\nI wavered whether to include a few books but ultimately ruled them out, including Someone Like Us by Dinaw Mengestu, Peggy by Rebecca Godfrey & Leslie Jamison, A Season of Perfect Happiness by Maribeth Fischer, and Off the Books by Soma Mei Sheng Frazier.\n\nHistorical Fiction\n\nHistorical fiction is still the genre I struggle most with when it comes to predictions. I considered a few August books that did not make ultimately make it into my predictions: By Any Other Name by Jodi Picoult, The Instrumentalist by Harriet Constable, The Thirteenth Husband by Greer Macallister, A Pair of Wings by Carole Hopson, and The Paris Gown by Christine Wells.\n\nRomance\n\nI wavered whether to include a few books but ultimately ruled them out: Rules for Ghosting by Shelly Jay Shore, Morbidly Yours by Ivy Fairbanks, The Break-Up Pact by Emma Lord, and Given Our History by Kristyn J. Miller.\n\nThrillers, Mysteries, & Horror\n\nI also waffled about a couple of books, primarily Someone in the Attic by Andrea Mara, Till Death Do Us Part by Laurie Elizabeth Flynn; The Madness by Dawn Kurtaggich, I Need You to Read This by Jessa Maxwell, In the Blink of an Eye by Jo Callahan, The Divide by Morgan Richter, and Then Things Went Dark by Bea Fitzgerald, but ultimately left them off my prediction list. If there is an early release, my bet is that it is Here One Moment by Liane Moriarty.\n\nFantasy, Science Fiction, & Magical Realism\n\nThere is at least one possibly from my July predictions that I can see as an August pick: My Mother Cursed My Name by Anamely Salgado Reyes. I debated about whether to include The Silence Factory by Bridget Collins and Strange Folk by Alli Dyer.\n\nShort Stories\n\nI also considered There Is A Rio Grande in Heaven but ultimately decided against including it as a prediction.\n\nNonfiction\n\nI also waffled about a couple of books, primarily You’re Embarrassing Yourself by Desiree Akhavan, The Witch’s Daughter by Orenda Fink, A Well-Trained Wife by Tia Levings, and Pixel Flesh: How Toxic Beauty Culture Harms Women by Ellen Atlanta, but ultimately left them off my prediction list."
