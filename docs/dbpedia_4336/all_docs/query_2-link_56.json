        "text": "King Charles may be heading across the pond to fix a family rift.\n\nRoyal expert Tom Quinn recently told The Mirror that Charles, 75, “has had discussions” about traveling to America to visit his estranged son Prince Harry, his daughter-in-law Meghan Markle, and his grandkids Archie 5, and Lilibet, 3, “at some time in the future.”\n\n“There is no doubt if it goes ahead he would build in time to visit his youngest son and his grandchildren, but there are mountains of planning to be overcome before that becomes even a remote possibility,” said Quinn.\n\nHarry, 39, and Meghan, 42, moved to the U.S. in 2020 after walking away from their senior royal duties. They are raising their children in Montecito, California and are estranged from the royal family.\n\nCharles, who currently has cancer, has only met Lilibet once, and seen Archie a few times, but according to Quinn, he wants to be closer to Harry and Meghan’s kids.\n\n“It’s certainly possible that he would make a discreet private visit to Harry and the children in California,” said Quinn. “He is desperate to see them and hates the idea that Archie and Lily will not remember him as the warm friendly grandfather he wants to be.”\n\nRelationship expert Louella Alderson told The Mirror that Charles visiting Harry in America would be a “significant gesture” to repair their broken relationship.\n\n“The logistics behind King Charles’s making a trip to America, whether it’s private or not, and meeting with Harry without may prove difficult,” Alderson acknowledged. “King Charles has many Royal obligations and now health issues as well, so a trip to America in any capacity would likely require careful planning and coordination.”\n\nShe continued: “This fact alone means if King Charles is willing to make the effort and put forth the time and energy to visit Harry in America, it could be a significant gesture of his desire to mend their relationship.”\n\n“It’s possible that he may be more willing to address any issues and work towards finding a resolution than he has been previously,” Alderson added.\n\nHowever, she noted that Harry — who has publicly slammed his relatives numerous times, including in his and Meghan’s bombshell television interview with Oprah Winfrey, their six-part Netflix documentary, and his memoir “Spare” — might not want to reconcile with his father.\n\n“While it may show a willingness on the King’s part to try and reconcile their relationship, it ultimately depends on both parties being open to communication and willing to start working through any issues that have caused tension between them,” Alderson said.\n\nShe added, “Ultimately, the success of this trip and potential reconciliation between King Charles and Harry will depend on both parties being open and committed to resolving their differences. It may take time for their relationship to fully heal after the events of recent years, but every effort made towards reconciliation is a positive step.”\n\nThe Post has reached out to Buckingham Palace and Harry’s reps for comment.\n\nSince leaving the royal family in 2020, Harry has only seen Charles a handful of times, including when he flew to the UK in February after learning of the monarch’s cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe two only reportedly chatted for 45 minutes, and Harry left his home country less than 24 hours later.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex returned to London in May to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, but he didn’t see any of his family members. He also chose to stay in a hotel instead of a royal residence.\n\nIn “Spare,” Harry opened up about his complicated relationship with his father. He said that he had discussions with Charles about his anxiety over dinner one night.\n\n“Pa, I’m really struggling with panic attacks and anxiety,” he allegedly told Charles, who wanted to send his youngest son to a doctor who “wanted to give me pills.” Harry wrote in his book, “I didn’t want to take pills.”\n\nHarry also claimed that Charles didn’t acknowledge the British press’s brutal mistreatment of Meghan when they were still working royals.\n\n“The conversation went in circles and when we hung up I felt—abandoned,” Harry wrote."
