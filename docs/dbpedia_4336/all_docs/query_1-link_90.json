Body found on 8/18/86.\n\nTuesday, August 19, 1986\n\nNew River Gorge - Fatal Fall\n\nLocation: Fern Creek\n\nSummary: A.J.M. was backpacking with another juvenile and an adult, and fell from top of waterfall. Extensive injuries. Died shortly thereafter.\n\nJune 15, 1987\n\n87-102 - New River Gorge - Drowning\n\nLocation: Near Sandstone Falls\n\nR.A. and P.M. were wading into the New River with a group of 8-10 relatives when they apparently stepped into deeper water and were swept away by the current. The bodies of both victims were recovered by Sandstone FD and Hinton VFD.\n\nJune 16, 1987\n\n87-113 - New River Gorge - Structural Fire\n\nLocation: Glen Jean Township\n\nA fire was discovered in the historic two-story Taylor House, which the park acquired five days ago. The building was seriously damaged, but the scope and extent of the fire is not currently known. Arson is suspected. The house was boarded up, but the first person on the scene discovered a board torn off in the rear of the building - the apparent entry point. The fire also began on the first floor, but the fire marshall indicates that all electrical wiring is on the second floor of the building. Investigation underway. The building is 75-100 years old.\n\nJuly 1, 1987\n\n87-132 - New River Gorge - Brothers Missing in River/ Possible Drowning\n\nLocation: Sandstone Falls\n\nThe C. brothers ware with 2 other boys as they were wading across the river. All of them lost their footing and were swept a distance downstream/ 2 made it to shore where they waited for a couple of hours for the brothers, thinking they were playing a joke in not appearing. They finally reported the brothers as missing at approximately 2:00pm to the West Virginia State Police. The State Police, along with the NPS responded to the report. All searched until dark. At approximately 10:00pm the dam was shut down to allow the water level to go down to allow that area to be searched at daylight.\n\nJuly 15, 1987\n\n87-156 - New River Gorge - Drowning\n\nT.P.S. was fishing with a companion when he saw what appeared to be his fishing license floating in the water. He had lost his wallet earlier in the day. T.P.S. was a good swimmer and jumped into the water to recover the license only to discover that it was a tree leaf. The undertow was quite strong and apparently pulled him under. Park personnel responded to the report with a raft, but Stone had already been found by the time they arrived at the scene. The body was recovered by Jan Care Ambulance\n\nAugust 24, 1987\n\n87-207 - New River Gorge - Drowning\n\nLocation: Double Z Rapids\n\nD.G. was on an Alpine Bible Camp rafting trip down the New River when the raft she was on hit Table Rock in Double Z Rapids and she fell out. The was pinned 5' under the rock and drowned. Efforts to extricate her have so far been unsuccessful; an upstream dam will decrease its discharge so that the body can be reached and removed.\n\nDouble Z is a Class 5 rapid and is considered one of the most technically difficult to negotiate on the river. Alpine Bible Camp is a commercial rafting operation.\n\nOctober 13, 1987\n\n87-246 - New River Gorge - Fall; Fatality\n\nLocation: New River Gorge Bridge\n\nS.G. was one of about 250 registered BASE (Bridge, Antenna, Structure and Earth) jumpers who signed up to jump from the 900' bridge. His main chute did not open, and he fell too fast for him to get his secondary fully deployed. Although he was reached quickly by rangers, he was found to be DGA. Indications are that he may have packed his own chute and that it had been packed improperly. Marijuana was found on his person.\n\nThere were three other injuries during the course of the event, which is held annually. The bridge is not in NPS jurisdiction.\n\nTuesday, March 21, 1989\n\n89-54 - New River Gorge - Body Found\n\nAt noon on March 18th, outfitters from Passages to Adventure notified the park that they had recovered the body of a man from the New River. The body has not yet been identified, but it was determined that it had been in the water for several days. The body was taken to the county coroner for initial examination, and will be sent to the state medical examiner in Charleston for in-depth study. Although foul play was initially suspected, it has been ruled out for the time being. (Rick Brown, Acting CR, NERI, via Chris Andress and Ginny Paci, RAD/MARO).\n\nFriday, March 24, 1989\n\n89-54 - New River Gorge - Follow-up on Body Recovery\n\nInvestigators have identified the body of the man pulled from the New River on March 18th as that of R.H., 51, of Thornville, Ohio. R.H. had last been seen in Oak Hill, West Virginia, on January 8th. He was involved in a motor vehicle accident that evening, and was reported to have been highly intoxicated by the mechanic at the garage where the vehicle was taken. It is not known how he got into the river. The medical examiner has determined that the cause of death was drowning, not foul play as had been originally suspected. (Rick Brown, Acting CR, NERI, through Steve Alscher, RAD/MARO).\n\nTuesday, April 25, 1989\n\n89-74 - New River - Visitor Fatality\n\nOn the morning of April 23rd, R.L.R., 40, of Charlestown, West Virginia, was hit and killed by a train while backpacking with three friends along railroad tracks four miles from Thurmond. R.L.R., who was deaf, did not see the train and could not hear his companions' warning shouts. None of the other three people was hurt. (Rick Brown, NERI, via Ginny Paci, RAD/MARO).\n\nFriday, June 16, 1989\n\n89-136 - New River - Vice Presidential Visit\n\nOn June 10th, Vice President Quayle and his family rafted the lower gorged of the New River within the park. Park rangers assisted the Secret Service in planning water-related activities and possible Whitewater SAR and EMS operations; they also assisted in providing site security in the launching area. During the trip, rangers and Secret Service agents on park watercraft provided the vanguard and rear guard for the Vice President's party. The park's 20-foot motorized raft was employed to carry specialized equipment, including weapons and White House communications equipment, and to serve as a platform for possible SAR operations. At the conclusion of the trip, Vice President Quayle spoke to several rangers and thanked them for their assistance; he also said that he would like to come back in the fall and run the Gauley River, which is a new national park area. During the Vice President's visit, the park also permitted and managed a political demonstration associated with the visit. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telefax to RAD/MARO and RAD/WASO).\n\nWednesday, August 9, 1989\n\n89-215 - New River - Drowning\n\nOn August 6th, L.Z., 44, of Accoville, West Virginia, was unloading gear from his boat after a fishing trip when he apparently slipped, fell and struck his head. Friends found him face down in the water 30 to 50 minutes later. CPR was begun; although L.Z. was temporarily revived, he later died at a nearby hospital. West Virginia State Police officers are investigating. (Telephone report from RAD/MARO).\n\nTuesday, August 15, 1989\n\n89-226 - New River Gorge - Marijuana Eradication\n\nOn August 12th, a marijuana eradication task force comprised of Raleigh County sheriff's deputies and park rangers began a search of the park for a reported marijuana plantation. They employed rafts to navigate part of the New River, and discovered a plot in a remote section of the park. A total of 240 plants were taken and destroyed. The plants were under intense cultivation and of the sensimilla variety. Local authorities estimated the street value of the plants at $720,000. Eradication efforts continue. (Telefax to RAD/MARO and RAD/WASO from Bill Blake, CR, NERI).\n\nTuesday, August 22, 1989\n\n89-236 - New River Gorge - Assault with a Deadly Weapon\n\nWhile camped at Grand View Sandbar on the morning of August 17th, B.W., his wife and their 16-year-old daughter were confronted by a man named L.T. who accused the B.W.'s daughter of stealing a watchband from his recreational vehicle. During the encounter, L.T. pointed a 30-30 rifle in the face of Mrs. B.W. and threatened to kill her. After pleading with L.T., the family retreated to their campsite; L.T. pursued them and continued his threats to kill them. After a few tense moments at the campsite with more threats, L.T. left the area. Rangers were later summoned to the location and began an investigation. On August 18th, rangers apprehended L.T. in the Grand View area. While dealing with L.T., they also contacted two men believed to be associates of his and found them to be in possession of freshly cut marijuana, loaded and concealed weapons, illegal weapons, and explosives. Investigation of the incident continues. This is the fourth assault with a deadly weapon to occur in the Grand View area this summer. On August 12th, 240 marijuana plants were taken out of the park from this area. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telefax to RAD/MARO and RAD/WASO).\n\nTuesday, September 19, 1989\n\n89-279 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - VIP Visit; Water Rescues\n\nOn September 16th, Congressmen Bruce Vento (D-Minnesota) and Nick Rahall (D- West Virginia) presided over a ceremony dedicating Gauley River NRA, which will be administered (along with Bluestone NSR) by New River Gorge. A dozen other VTP's, including MAR Regional Director Jim Coleman, were also in. attendance. After the ceremony, they were taken, on a white water rafting trip down the upper stretch of the Gauley, which is world-renowned for its Class V and VI rapids. Two of the three rafts making the trip were provided by the park and were guided by park, rangers - one for VIP's and. one for protection and rescue services. Several incidents occurred during the trip. While passing through the Class V Shiprock Rapid, Assistant Superintendent Henry Law was swept out of his rescue raft, but was able to get back after a short swim. In the Class VI Sweet Falls Rapid, one of the VIP/media rafts flipped, and all six passengers were dumped, into the river. Park staff in the rescue raft assisted them in recapturing and righting their raft, then went to the assistance of eight park visitors from two other water craft that had also been overturned. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telefaxes to RAD/MARO and RAD/WASO).\n\nFriday, September 22, 1989\n\n89-289 - Southeastern Areas - Hurricane Hugo\n\nThe following update on Hurricane Hugo's impacts on units of the National Park System in the Southeast was prepared by staff in the Service's Southeast Regional Office from phone calls made to each park's superintendent or chief ranger early today. It was forwarded to the Washington Office at 6 a.m. this morning. Because of darkness and winds, it was not always possible to get an accurate assessment of the storm's effects to this point. Reports on the Virgin Islands were received yesterday afternoon. Further updates will be provided as soon as parks are able to evaluate the hurricane's impact and report to the regional office.\n\n- New River Gorge - The park reported 50 mile per hour winds and heavy rains falling as of noon on Friday. The river was reported to be well above normal autumn levels and rising rapidly. Power was out. The park staff was working with local authorities to coordinate possible river rescue operations.\n\nFriday, October 6, 1989\n\n89-304 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Illegal Rafting Arrests\n\nOn October 1st, rangers and West Virginia DNR conservation officers served arrest warrants on four individuals charged on 10 separate counts of violating commercial white water regulations in the park. The arrests culminated a two-month-long undercover operation run jointly by rangers and conservation officers. While making the arrests, small amounts of marijuana and LSD were confiscated and $18,000 worth of equipment was seized. Although the primary targets of this investigation were \"bandit\" commercial operators who had also committed a number of safety violations, intelligence was also developed regarding the distribution, sales and use of illegal drugs in the park. The investigation continues and additional arrests are expected. (Telefax report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI).\n\nFriday, October 27, 1989\n\n89-237 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Special Event\n\nOn October 21st, the tenth annual Bridge Day was held on the New River Gorge Bridge. Among other Bridge Day activities, parachutists traditionally jump from the center span of the bridge and descend to New River Gorge 870 feet below. This event is coordinated by the BASE Association, and over 450 jumpers registered to participate this year. The park, which controls the river and adjacent land, including the landing zone, issued them a special use permit for the event. On the day of the event, however, the New River was 14 feet above its seasonal normal and covered the drop zone with 15 feet of water. Although the BASE Association withdrew its support for the event and the park revoked the special use permit, 48 people made \"bandit\" jumps from the bridge. One of them, Tim Sell of Davis, California, was apprehended when he intentionally jumped onto park land; six of the remaining 48 attempted to hit a state road and landed 30 to 40 feet up in trees in the park. All were rescued without injury. One jumper missed the road and hit and caved in the roof of a personal vehicle belonging to a park ranger. On the following day, another jumper was severely injured when he conducted an illegal jump from the Glade Creek Bridge on 1-64 into the park. He was medevaced to Charleston, and rangers are investigating the incident. During the event on the 21st, rangers also rescued nine visitors whose commercial raft flipped over in the Class V Fayette Station rapids. (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI).\n\nMonday, February 12, 1990\n\n90-25 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Arrest of Commissioned Ranger\n\nOn the night of February 5th, park rangers completed an investigation into the theft of a computer and printer from the park's Canyon Rim Visitor Center with the execution of a search warrant at the house of a commissioned seasonal employee and the recovery of approximately $6,000 worth of stolen government property. The employee was arrested on the following day and charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property. In addition to the computer and printer, the rangers found badges, flashlights, law enforcement leather gear, camera equipment and SAR gear. Drug paraphernalia and material believed to be marijuana were also discovered. A check of the employee's background revealed a prior arrest and association with illegal drugs. Although the employee was commissioned, she was not required to take a drug test at the beginning of her 1989 appointment because she was not in a law enforcement position. Because the employee is a \"career\" seasonal, New River, with the concurrence of MARO, will develop an employee alert for this individual and distribute more detailed background information in the near future. The alert will contain information about a second individual who is associated with this case, has an arrest record, has been connected with illegal drugs, and is trying to obtain a law enforcement position with the NPS. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telefax report, 11 a.m. EST, 2/9/90).\n\nFriday, May 11, 1990\n\n90-96 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Robbery\n\nOn May 8th, a female visitor was physically assaulted and $1,300 was stolen from her in an incident which occurred at Grandview. The woman has been hospitalized. No further information is currently available. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telephone report to RAD/WASO, 5/10/90).\n\nFriday, May 11, 1990\n\n90-96 New River Gorge (West Virginia) Robbery\n\nOn May 8th, a female visitor was physically assaulted and $1,300 was stolen from her in an incident which occurred at Grandview. The woman has been hospitalized. No further information is currently available. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via telephone report to RAD/WASO, 5/10/90).\n\nThursday, June 21, 1990\n\n90-146 - New River (West Virginia) - Drug Bust\n\nAs a result of a cooperative effort with local and state agencies to deal with drug problems in and around the park, a combined task force has discovered two marijuana plantations in the park and eradicated a total of 421 plants with a street value (at harvest) of $421,000. The task force, which has been working together for less than a month, is sharing personnel, special equipment and intelligence. The effort is being supported by special drug funds from the park and region; outside NPS resources are being coordinated by MAR Chief Ranger Chris Andress. Several joint special operations in the park are being planned. (Telefaxed report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, to RAD/MARO and RAD/WASO, 6/20).\n\nMonday, July 2, 1990\n\n90-165 - New River (West Virginia) - Homicide\n\nOn June 24th, park visitors discovered the body of R.H. in his home, which is located in an isolated part of the park known as Mill Creek. R.H. was occupying his house under a lifetime estate agreement. R.H. had been a victim of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in the past, and park rangers and West Virginia state police are investigating the possibility that R.H. was murdered. (Telefax report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI).\n\nFriday, August 17, 1990\n\n90-260 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Marijuana Eradication\n\nOn August 15th, rangers eradicated 19 marijuana plants found in the park. The street value of these plants is estimated at $38,000. The discovery of this small plantation resulted from NERI's involvement in an inter-agency cooperative effort. Information developed by this group shows that southwest West Virginia is experiencing a 100 percent increase in marijuana cultivation over 1989. To date, rangers have located approximately 530 plants - a 110 percent increase over last year. (Telefaxed report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 8/17).\n\nTuesday, August 21, 1990\n\n90-264 - New River Gorge (West Virginia)- Double Drowning\n\nOn August 17th, E.W., 21, of Coal City, West Virginia, and G.M., 28, of Oak Hill, West Virginia, drowned in the New River near Terry Beach. Both men entered the water to assist Wyatt's wife, who was having difficult. She was able to return to shore safely, but neither E.W. nor G.M. were able to make it back. Testimony from other party members and evidence at the scene suggest that both victims had been drinking heavily. Rangers and members of a local fire department recovered both bodies. (Telefax report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 8/21).\n\nWednesday, August 22, 1990\n\n90-272 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Drug Arrest\n\nOn August 17th, rangers arrested R.E.F. of Oak Hill, West Virginia, for cultivation of marijuana in the park. Three days prior to the arrest, a special drug recon patrol conducted by rangers discovered a plantation of 127 plants in a remote part of the park. Evidence at the scene, including irrigation equipment and fertilizer, indicated that the plants were being intensively cultivated. An around-the-clock surveillance operation was immediately begun. Just after 6 p.m. on the 17th, R.E.F. entered the plantation and began working with the plants. The rangers videotaped him in the act. As R.E.F. left the plantations, he was arrested by the three rangers on the surveillance team. R.E.F. has an extensive arrest record for past violence, but offered the rangers little resistance. The plants are valued at $2,000 each, and push the total value of marijuana seized in the park past $1 million. (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 8/20).\n\nWednesday, September 5, 1990\n\n90-300 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Possible Homicide\n\nOn August 31st, rangers responded to a report of a body in the New River and discovered the remains of S.S., 27, of Buckcannon, West Virginia. Upon investigation, they found that S.S. had suffered some type of head injury or wound. The exact cause of death, however, has not yet been determined. S.S. was last seen alive on the 28th as he ran from a railroad right-of-way, where he was being chased by railway police for stealing copper wire. The right-of-way runs through the park. At that time, S.S. was with H.W., who was arrested. S.S. had escaped. An investigation is underway. (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 9/4).\n\nTuesday, September 18, 1990\n\n90-316 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Multiple VIP Visits\n\nOver the past weekend, three significant VIP visits occurred in the park. The primary attraction was the Gauley River, which has over 100 major rapids along 24 miles of river. The visits were by Vice President Quayle and his family, Secretary Lujan, and Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Scott Sewell. Regional Director Jim Coleman was also in the park and took part in the Sewell trip. Both Sewell and the Vice President rafted on the Gauley and its Class VI Whitewater; Secretary Lujan fished and rafted on the New River. Rangers were actively involved in all aspects of these trips. Class VI-qualified rangers led the two-day trip for the Sewell party; other Class VI-qualified rangers provided a law enforcement screen and Whitewater SAR and safety support for the Vice President's trip. Other park rangers were involved in the security and land-based protection for the Vice President. The only incident which occurred was an involuntary swim taken by Sewell on a Class V rapid called Insignificant. Upon returning to the raft, Sewell commented that the rapid might better be named \"Significant.\" (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 9/17).\n\nTuesday, September 25, 1990\n\n90-234 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Drowning; Rescues\n\nOn September 25th, B.B., 29, of Centerville, Virginia, drowned while kayaking in the Gauley River. B.B.'s kayak became pinned vertically in the Class TV \"Shiprock Rapids\", and B.B. was underwater for approximately 15 minutes. CPR was begun on him after he was extricated; he was then medevaced to a hospital in Beckley, where he died. Rangers were also involved in 16 additional Whitewater SAR's during the weekend, including the rescue of Congressman N.R. (D-WV), who fell out of a park raft in the Class VI \"Pillow Rock Rapids.\" Congressman N.R. was recovered by an NPS rescue kayaker. (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 9/24).\n\nTuesday, October 23, 1990\n\n90-379 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Special Event\n\nOn October 20th, rangers maintenance employees assisted at the 11th annual Bridge Day, an event which is held on the New River Gorge bridge. The bridge, which is 900 feet above the New River, is a prime location for BASE jumpers, who come from all over the world to participate in the event. This year's jump, which was held under a park special use permit, was complicated by high water, as the New River was 11 feet above normal fall levels. Due to special safety constraints, only 397 jumps were made. Rangers were involved in 59 Whitewater SAR's and one \"tree\" STAR. Five jumpers received injuries requiring hospitalization. Ranger Scott Kalna also was injured when he broke his hand while attempting to arrest the fall of a BASE jumper who fell from a tree top. Kalna's quick actions prevented the jumper from falling another 45 feet. Seven jumpers were arrested by rangers for making illegal jumps. A crowd estimated at 200,000 - a record for the event - attended Bridge Day. (Telefaxed report from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 10/21).\n\nWednesday, October 31, 1990\n\n90-392 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Structural Fire\n\nAt about 9:30 p.m. on October 27th, rangers and local firefighters responded to a report of a structural fire in the outdoor theater in the park's Grandview unit. Upon arriving, they found the front office complex of the outdoor theater fully engulfed in flames. The theater is used by Theater West Virginia for an outdoor drama program; the front office complex housed a small NPS visitor center, a concession stand, Theater West Virginia's offices, a storage area for light and sound equipment, and the subdistrict ranger's office. All facilities and equipment in the building (including $5,000 worth of SAR and EMS gear) and half of the seating area for the outdoor theater were destroyed. The total loss has been placed in excess of $500,000. On the following day, an inter-agency arson investigation team coordinated by the park concluded that the fire had been caused by faulty wiring. The park had inherited the aging facility on October 1st when the state donated what had been called Grandview State Park to the Service. (Bill Blake, CR, NERI, via CompuServe message from Ginny Paci, RAD/MARO, 10/30).\n\nMonday, November 5, 1990\n\n90-397 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Death of Employee\n\nA memorial service for Ron Gibbs, who was killed in a one-car accident on October 27th, was held last Thursday evening in Oak Hill, West Virginia. Ron was a 24-year-veteran of the National Park Service and the first historian for New River Gorge National River. A trust fund for the study of military history is being established in his name. Specific information on how to contribute to the fund will appear in the morning report later this week.

Within 24 hours, rangers and conservation officers from the state's department of natural resources made 11 arrests for illegal hunting activities within the park. Violations included taking game out of season, spotlighting, hunting without a license, taking game from a closed area, and illegal possession of weapons. (Telefax from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 11/21 report inadvertently misplaced until recently).\n\nTuesday, January 15, 1991\n\n91-9 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Poaching Arrest\n\nRangers received an anonymous report of deer poaching in the park near Sewell on January 11th. Three poachers were reported to be using a truck to enter an area along the New River via a railroad access road to spotlight and shoot deer. The poachers were reportedly selling the deer for about $50 each, and had allegedly taken about five deer in the area over the previous two weeks. Four rangers and a West Virginia conservation officer placed the area under surveillance. Around 10:00 that evening, they saw a truck matching the description the informant had given entering the area. Just after midnight, the surveillance team saw the suspects employ handheld spotlights from the truck to spot the open fields and river bank. The team closed in on the vehicle and arrested three men A.H., 71, J.H., 45, and C.J., 41, all from Oak Hill, West Virginia. The three were charged with hunting without a license, hunting out of season, spotlighting, and possession of loaded firearms in a vehicle. Two 12 gauge shotguns loaded with slugs and two spotlights were seized. No deer or other wildlife were found in their possession, but they admitted to the charges. C.J. also admitted that they had shot at but missed one deer just prior to the arrest. [Telefax from Rick Brown, DR, NERI, 1/12]\n\nMonday, April 1, 1991\n\n91-83 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Illegal Taking of Wildlife\n\nOn March 23rd, rangers working in the park's Canyon District received a report of the discovery of a large number of dead deer in a remote section of the Gauley River and found two large piles of deer carcasses and skeletons. They estimated that the remains of between 250 and 300 deer bucks, does, fawns and yearlings are in the two piles. Rangers and officers from the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources have begun a joint investigation. [CompuServe message from Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 3/27]\n\nTuesday, April 2, 1991\n\n91-84 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - ARPA Violations\n\nOn the afternoon of March 22nd, ranger Jennifer Anderson was patrolling an area of the park which contains a known archeological site. A local informant had told her that several individuals might be digging in the site that day. Anderson spotted a vehicle near the site and confirmed that it belonged to an individual who was suspected of previous cultural resource and firearms violations. Since county and state officers had previously warned rangers that the vehicle's owner and his known associates were generally armed and had often been in trouble with authorities, Anderson immediately requested backup, then found and observed three men C.F., 28, E.F., 52, and C.M., 28 digging in different areas of the site. The men eventually spotted her and immediately ran from the area. After about ten minutes, however, they returned and began approaching Anderson's position; one man carried a shovel, a second carried a mattock. Since the three men had a history of criminal behavior and were acting suspiciously, Anderson had taken the precaution of arming herself with a shotgun from her vehicle. When the trio approached to within 25 yards, Anderson ordered them to halt. Two complied, but the third continued to approach. He finally stopped 15 feet from Anderson's position when Anderson gave him a third command to stop and chambered a round in her shotgun. The three men were very agitated and verbalized vague threats towards Anderson until three responding rangers and two county deputies arrived to assist. The men admitted to digging for artifacts and were arrested for cultural resource violations. Several digging implements possessed by the men were confiscated along with a .22 caliber rifle found during a consent search of their vehicle. Rangers subsequently counted a total of over 600 holes on the site, some as deep as two and a half feet. The investigation is continuing in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's Office. Additional charges may be lodged on ARPA violations and for interfering with agency functions.

The pollution source has been known to authorities for the past ten years, and has been in state court for the last eight years without resolution. On April 30th, the U.S. Attorney for West Virginia requested a joint NPS-FBI investigation of the incident, and also asked rangers to investigate an acid mine drainage problem in the park and a logging operation near the boundary which is causing soil erosion and water quality problems for the New River. In all three cases, rangers are working with investigators from both the FBI and the EPA and are employing the Clean Water Act as the primary investigative tool. The initial investigation of Wolf Creek shows ample evidence for a grand jury indictment, and the U.S. Attorney has assured the environmental crimes task force which he chairs that his intent is to aggressively pursue and prosecute violators of environmental crimes, particularly those affecting water quality in the park.

J.C., a seasonal employee who was off for the winter, was suspected of the theft, and enough evidence was gathered to obtain a search warrant of her residence. During that search, rangers found the printer and a number of other items taken from the park, including computer software and SAR equipment. The total valuation of all items was placed at just over $2,000. J.C. confessed to having stolen a total of nearly $5,700 in government property during the twoyear period she was employed in the park. The computer was recovered from her parents' residence in Loraine, Ohio, shortly thereafter. J.C. was arraigned and later pled guilty to the theft of government property (18 USC 641). On May 6th, J.C. appeared in U.S. District Court and was sentenced to five months in prison, two years' probation, 100 hours of community service, and a $2,000 fine. Her prison time will be spent in a halfway house or community treatment center, where she will work days and be detained at night. Community service will be undertaken during the probation period.

Arriving on scene, they discovered that a small fishing boat had capsized and that the two occupants had been thrown into the New River. One of the two men, A.R., was wearing a life jacket and was able to swim to safety; the other, J.L.B., 58, was not and was swept downstream. Rangers coordinated a multiagency SAR response which included specially trained dogs, air overflights, SCUBA teams, and water and ground searchers. J.L.B.'s body was discovered on the 15th by divers checking an area that a dog had alerted on. This is the third drowning in less than a year in the Terry Beach area and the 15th drowning in that area in the past ten years.

A cooperative investigation was begun shortly thereafter involving rangers, the park's land acquisition office, a forester on loan from the Monongahela National Forest, and the West Virginia Department of Agriculture's Forestry Division. As of this date, both the loggers and contractor have been identified. Through information obtained by rangers and the forest data computer in the Monongahela NF, investigators have been able to determine that at least 10,500 board feet of hardwood timber with an estimated value of $6,000 was stolen. The method of logging utilized indicates that this was an attempt to cut out high grade, veneerquality trees in a quick operation. Federal surveyors from the Appalachian Trail Conference in Harpers Ferry are scheduled to resurvey the area this month as the last step of the investigation. The Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office has accepted the case and plans to prosecute using West Virginia's triple damage assessment law for timber theft.

On June 3rd, 15th and 18th, rangers employed intelligence gathered through an interagency drug task force in the seizure of a total of 25 highly cultivated marijuana plants. On June 28th, park investigators learned that a house located inside the park was being used as an indoor growing facility. As a result of the subsequent investigation, search warrants for the premises were obtained and executed with the assistance of the Fayette County sheriff's office. A total of 14 plants and 500 seeds were confiscated and arrest warrants were issued for those suspected of having grown the plants. Along with these activities, the park and Fayette County sheriff's office have put in service their jointlyowned, drugtrained, twoyearold German shepherd, Kiwi. The dog, which was trained in Europe and the United States, will be utilized under a cooperative agreement with the sheriff's office. Kiwi's handler is a sergeant for the sheriff's office and a parttime seasonal ranger in the park. During the month of June, Kiwi successfully located marijuana and marijuana seeds on two different occasions, and also made his debut as an educational tool in numerous schools in the county. While not specifically trained to find green, leafy, onthevine marijuana, the dog discovered nine plants in a recent interagency drug raid.

J.W., a non-swimmer, did not surface from the pool, which is about eight to twelve feet in depth. A 15-year-old member of his family group saw him disappear; family members notified local residents, who in turn advised the park and local emergency services. A joint search effort was begun employing the incident command system. At the time of the report, participants in the search included the park, a local fire and rescue department, five volunteer fire departments, three search dog teams, and four dive teams. No foul play or alcohol or drug abuse is suspected. Indications are that Waddell slipped or fell into the river.

The source of the pollution was determined to be an abandoned mine owned by L.L. and run by the Mine Management Corporation. As the magnitude of the pollution became evident, the United States Attorney asked the park and FBI to conduct an investigation into the incident. As a result of this investigation, L.L. was indicted on 18 felony counts for violations of the Clean Water Act on July 24th. The NPS has become the lead investigative agency in exploring other violations of the act; rangers are currently involved in active investigations of five major pollution sources affecting the water quality of streams and rivers within the park's boundaries. The results of one investigation are currently before the U.S. Attorney, and indictments are expected. Indictments are also likely in the remaining investigations.

Whitewater guides employed several rescue techniques and finally freed C.T. after she had been submerged in the river for about 50 minutes. Since she was picked up by people who did not know how long she'd been underwater, CPR was begun and continued on shore. Rangers arrived about 10 minutes after CPR was begun and continued resuscitation efforts while preparing to evacuate C.T.. A HealthNet Aero Medical Helicopter Service helicopter arrived on scene, landing on a large rock in the middle of the river, and medivaced her to a hospital in Beckley. Resuscitation efforts were continued in the hospital for about 45 minutes before she was pronounced dead. This was the first drowning of the season in the park.

Another climber ran out for help and reported the incident to rangers 45 minutes later. The park's SAR team responded, provided initial treatment for G.B.'s injuries, and extricated him by a 90-foot vertical litter raise directly above the accident site. The litter raise was completed just before 6:00 p.m., and medical treatment was transferred over to a flight paramedic crew from HealthNet Aero Medical Services. Rangers then evacuated the patient overland to a waiting ambulance. At 6:30 p.m., G.B. was loaded into a waiting HealthNet helicopter and taken to a nearby medical center. G.B. sustained fractured vertebrae in the thoracic and lumbar region, head injuries, and fractures to his pelvis, wrist and lower leg. He is presently in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.

Along with a small amount of marijuana, rangers found three fully-loaded weapons in J.B.'s vehicle - a 9 mm Luger machine pistol, a Model 60 Marlin rifle, and a 16-gauge sawed-off shotgun. J.B., a member of a local transient climbing community, had been contacted on numerous occasions during the previous two years by New River rangers. On June 16th, following a joint investigation by rangers and ATF agents, J.B. was indicted on one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun and one count of possession of a firearm without a serial number. J.B. previously pled guilty to one count of misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.

Both men were ordered to serve three months and a day in jail on the first count and three months on each of the other counts, and the judge also ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. The pair had been charged in April on four misdemeanor counts under 18 USC 1856 (Fires left unattended and unextinguished) following an investigation by rangers. Both had been intoxicated at the time the fires were started.

A 16-year-old male juvenile was operating a Chevy Cavalier with E.B., 19, as a passenger. The vehicle crossed the opposing lane in a curve at a high rate of speed, hit a rock embankment, recrossed the opposing lane, and was hit head on by a pickup truck with five occupants. Rangers from Grandview were the first emergency service responders on scene and provided life support for an extended period of time before local ambulance and fire department units arrived. Both occupants in the Cavalier, neither of whom were wearing seatbelts, were ejected from the vehicle and suffered severe multiple trauma injuries. The occupants of the pickup suffered only minor injuries. Because of heavy fog, a lifeflight helicopter which was 20 minutes away in Charleston could not respond. E.B. was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and the juvenile died in the Charleston Area Medical Center on July 18th. State troopers' preliminary estimates indicate that the Cavalier was travelling between 90 and 100 mph when it initially left the road.

When S.S. asked the individual, later identified as D.G., 35, what he was doing, D.G. put his hand in his pocket, told S.S. that he had a knife, and threatened to use it on S.S.. S.S. nonetheless asked D.G. to give back his belongings; D.G. threw a few items on the ground, put the rest in his truck, and drove off. He returned a few minutes later, threatened S.S. again and told him to forget that the incident ever happened. D.G. drove up the road, stopped about 50 yards away, turned his headlights on S.S. for about five minutes, then left the area. S.S. reported the incident the next day. He provided rangers with the truck's registration number and descriptions of both D.G. and the vehicle. Ranger Tony Liguori worked closely with Fayette County officers to identify D.G.. A search warrant was obtained for D.G.'s residence on July 25th. During the search, rangers identified and recovered items taken from S.S.'s vehicle, and also discovered items incidental to two other car clouts which occurred in the park's Stonecliff Beach area - one of four park areas in the Canyon District which had been hit by a series of 11 car clouts over the previous four months. Further information was obtained indicating that D.G. may have been storing stolen property at his mother's residence, and a consent search was conducted of her house the next day. Rangers found items from three other car clouting incidents, two from the series of 11 reported above, one from another park car clout. Later that day, D.G. was arrested and charged with grand larceny and released on a $10,000 bond. Charges of aggravated burglary, tampering, vandalism and three other counts of grand larceny are pending. D.G. was arrested at Stonecliff Beach after completing a whitewater rafting trip. He had accepted a fee to take a group of nine people downriver, and was subsequently cited by West Virginia DNR officers for illegally conducting a commercial operation without a permit. [Rick Brown, DR, Canyon District, NERI, 7/27]\n\nThursday, August 6, 1992\n\n92-395 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Special Event\n\nA film company from Santa Monica, California, filmed a stunt involving the bungee dropping of a GMC truck off the New River Gorge bridge over the three-day period from July 23rd to the 25th. Since the stunt, which was being done for a television commercial, took place above the park, special safety precautions on the river and adjacent lands had to be developed and carried out to ensure safe passage for thousands of whitewater rafters. Because the event attracted large crowds, the park joined with local police and EMS personnel under the incident command system to manage crowds and traffic and provide necessary emergency services. All expenses associated with the incident command operation were covered under a special use permit, whereby the film company was charged for all related overtime, regular time and administrative costs. The three days of filming were uneventful except for one major medical incident in which rangers rescued a visitor who fell 50 feet and suffered internal and back injuries. The victim was evacuated to the nearest landing zone and taken by air ambulance to a local hospital. [Regina Carrico, NERI, 7/28]\n\nThursday, August 13, 1992\n\n92-411 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Marijuana Cultivation\n\nOn June 3rd, rangers, acting on a report from a confidential source, discovered 19 marijuana plants growing in the Garden Ground area, an outlying section of the park. A remote sensing video camera was set up to monitor the site and record the time and date of any visit to the plot. The batteries and video tape were changed weekly over the next several weeks. When rangers visited the site on July 11th, it appeared that weeds had been removed from around the plants. The video revealed two persons tending the plants on July 9th, but the camera had shifted and only the top parts of their heads were visible. Rangers again visited the site on July 28th; this time, they found the camera, which had been buried on the ground, lying in the open and out of the hole in which it had been hidden. The radio antenna on top of the waterproof container was bent over, and it appeared that someone had stomped on it. The camera and sensor units, however, were intact and undamaged. The video tape showed that one person had visited the site on July 18th and was tending the plants there, but the person was unidentifiable. Rangers are working with local authorities to identify the suspect. The investigation is continuing.

Patrol rangers provided initial information on L.G., who has a history of drug use, drug dealing and violence, and investigators subsequently identified him as a suspect in drug deals both in and out of the park. Mid-Atlantic Regional Office funded a covert/surveillance operation against L.G.; the park's criminal investigators gathered additional information on him, and subsequently brought in Beckley City police and DEA. On August 13th, L.G. purchased a pound of processed marijuana from an undercover park investigator and was arrested. The marijuana had been provided by DEA, and the reverse buy operation had been approved by the U.S. attorney's anti-drug task force. The team also confiscated $1,000 in cash and L.G.'s new Ford Ranger pickup. Several federal charges are pending against him, including possession with intent to distribute. Park investigators have obtained additional information which will lead to the search of two residences used by L.G.. [Chris Schrader, CI, NERI, 8/13]\n\nWednesday, August 19, 1992\n\n92-442 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Marijuana Eradication\n\nRangers participated in a major marijuana eradication effort in New River Gorge, Gauley River and surrounding counties during the period from August 10th to the 12th. The effort was jointly coordinated by the park, Fayette County sheriff's department and state police; a helicopter from the Wood County sheriff's department, operating under a federal grant, was used to locate marijuana plantations throughout the area. Over the three-day period, nine sites containing 96 plants were found inside and outside the two park areas. A ground crew made up of rangers, deputies and troopers then moved in and eradicated the plants. No arrests were made, but some leads are currently being pursued. Two notable incidents occurred during the operation. On the 11th, a helicopter observer spotted marijuana plants along a power line. As the helicopter turned back, the observer saw one man run from a suspect residence toward the plot and a second jump on a tractor with a bush hog attached and race across a field. They next saw the tractor along the edge of the power line, where it was pulling the bush hog very quickly along a section about 50 yards long. The tractor then returned to the point where it was originally parked and the driver returned to the house. The observer and pilot were unable to find any marijuana plants when the returned to scout the site that the tractor had mowed. On August 12th, the pilot of the helicopter and a ranger serving as an aerial observer saw a man at a suspected farm on the boundary of Gauley River lay what appeared to be a pistol on the hood of his truck and aim it at the helicopter. The pilot immediately left the area and reported the incident to the ground crew. The owner of the farm is known to have grown marijuana in the past, has a history of violent behavior, and has made verbal threats against police officers in the past.

They found a small amount of marijuana, valium pills (L.G. was reportedly selling valium), and five guns, including a loaded 9mm, a .357 handgun, and a 12 gauge shotgun. All but two of the weapons were found in the bedroom with the drugs. The narcotics officers also arrested L.G.'s girlfriend, S.M., on charges which were developed from information gained at L.G.'s arrest. Additional arrests are expected. [Chris Schrader, CI, NERI, 8/18]\n\nFriday, August 28, 1992\n\n92-460 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Rescue\n\nEarly on the afternoon of August 19th, rangers responded to a report that a 14-year-old girl had seriously injured herself while whitewater rafting in the lower gorge of the New River. Due to the location of the incident, land-based rangers were able to quickly respond, while at the same time requesting a helicopter for evacuation. Rangers were on scene in 40 minutes and began EMS treatment and evacuation. Other rangers assisted in getting local ALS personnel on scene and established a landing zone for the helicopter. At one point during the evacuation, EMS personnel had to administer artificial respiration to the victim. She was taken to a waiting park vehicle, transported out of the gorge to a helicopter, then flown to a nearby trauma center, where she's now reported to be in stable condition.

Rangers and two responding fire departments arrived within minutes, but the structure was fully involved and completely destroyed. The structure, which is owned by the NPS, had been vacant and boarded up for the past five years. The reporting party stated that the building was first seen burning in the second story rear. Investigation revealed that the NPS lock on the structure had been broken, and the focus of the follow-up investigation is on a group of local residents who were repeatedly seen in the area just prior to and several times during the fire. Some of them have prior convictions in state courts for burning abandoned buildings. One is a relative of the house's last resident. Rangers also learned that the house was apparently used by a homeless member of the community on weekends, and that lights had been seen upstairs in the house late at night. The house, which was built in the late 1800s, was the central feature of the park's Quinnimont Historic District, and its loss jeopardizes the entire cultural landscape of Quinnimont and cultural aspects of the DCP planning process now underway for the Middle Gorge of the park.

Although many visited the visitor center and other areas of the park, parachutists jumping from the 876-foot-high bridge were the main attraction. Just under 300 parachutists made 550 jumps; 44 landed in the river below the bridge, and rangers made 29 water rescues during the day. Two others landed in trees. Eleven injuries occurred which required transport of the victims to the hospital. Two of these were serious leg injuries.

During a routine contact in a closed area, team members observed knives, ammunition and a marijuana pipe in plain view in J.S.B.'s vehicle. \"Kiwi\", the drug dog purchased by the NPS for the Fayette County drug task force, was brought to the scene and assisted in a search of the vehicle. Along with a small amount of marijuana, rangers found three fully-loaded weapons in J.S.B.'s vehicle - a 9 mm Luger machine pistol, a Model 60 Marlin rifle, and a 16-inch sawed-off shotgun. On October 30th, J.S.B., who had already pleaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor of a controlled substance, entered a guilty plea to one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun (26 USC 5861D).

The hunter, S.F., 22, of Princeton, West Virginia, had been missing since Wednesday afternoon, when he failed to return from hunting at a deer stand in the area. That same afternoon, a storm deposited from two to four inches of snow in the area and dropped temperatures into the teens. S.F.'s family did not notify authorities until late on Wednesday, after their own search proved fruitless. Rangers and an NPS contract helicopter joined the search effort at 6 a.m. on Friday morning. Temperatures remained in the teens and low twenties, and forecasters predicted another six inches of snow within 24 hours. Park search teams established voice contact with S.F. at 4 p.m. that afternoon, but were unable to locate him due to the rugged terrain and snow despite efforts that continued through the night. On Saturday morning, teams continued their attempts to gain access to the gorge and cliff band area where he appeared to be located, and an NPS searcher finally located him in a small cave under a cliff. Even though S.F. had no food, water or fire for 67 hours and had only a pair of insulated coveralls for protection during the adverse weather, he was found in fairly good condition, with only a minor hip injury and severely swollen feet. He was evacuated to a helicopter landing zone which had been cleared by chainsaws on private land, then flown to a waiting ambulance for transport to a hospital in Princeton. S.F. was released from the hospital after only a six-hour observation period. A unified command comprised of representatives from the park, state DNR and county emergency services provided overhead for the search, which included personnel from those agencies, state park and forestry divisions and local SAR units. [Bill Blake, CR, NERI, 12/6]\n\nTuesday, December 29, 1992\n\n92-662 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Fraud\n\nThe investigation of a park employee for false and fraudulent claims of time, attendance and per diem records culminated on December 16th with a pre-trial agreement in which the individual will be on probation for a period of one year, during which time restitution will be made to the government. If the debt is not repaid or the individual participates in any criminal activity during that time, the U.S. Attorney's Office will proceed with criminal charges on all counts. The investigation of the employee began last March. Rangers subsequently found that, during the period from August, 1991, to March 15, 1992, the individual was AWOL from his duty station for at least 15 days, had falsified time and attendance records for those days, and had also falsified per diem reports for at least 21 days during this same period of time. The monetary loss to the government totaled $2,165.32. On March 12th, investigating rangers anticipated that the suspect would be AWOL from his duty station in the park to go home to Florida for the weekend. They followed him as far as Wytheville, Virginia, and observed him continuing south on Interstate 77. The next day, rangers from Fort Caroline conducted a plain clothes surveillance of the suspect's residence in Jacksonville and spotted his vehicle there. The vehicle was the same one which New River rangers had followed into Virginia the previous day. The individual has since been fired. [Rick Brown, DR, NERI, 12/28]\n\nMonday, February 8, 1993\n\n93-52 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Timber Theft\n\nOn January 16th, a ranger on backcountry foot patrol discovered evidence of a timbering operation on park property on the rim of Dunloup Creek Gorge. Investigation revealed that approximately 75 acres were logged and over 500 trees had been taken, all between 20 and 41 inches in stump diameter. Timber haul roads had been constructed through about 7,000 feet of park property with heavy equipment. Assessments are being made to determine if any historic and/or archeological resources in the area were damaged or destroyed. The person who logged the area, Richard Lee Bailey of Oak Hill, West Virginia, was interviewed by rangers and admitted to building the logging roads in the area and removing the timber for commercial profit. Bailey maintains that he had a timber lease on an adjacent property owner's tract, that he was logging the leased timber, and that he was unaware of any NPS property in the area. He has been charged with theft of government property (18 USC 661), cutting or injuring trees (18 USC 1853), and removal or transportation of timber (18 USC). The Forest Service is assisting the park in efforts to determine the value of the stolen timber and the cost of restitution. The U.S. attorney's office has accepted the case and will seek restitution for the value of the timber, site rehabilitation, boundary survey costs, timber cruise costs, and any other costs associated with the investigation. The park will use recovered funds to set up an environmental protection account for use on future incidents.

At the time of the request, the fire was within a quarter mile of the park's boundary and was threatening structures. The fire was well within the park's initial attack zone, and eight park firefighters responded with two Type VII engines. The fire was held to 12 acres, but not before it burned two structures valued at $17,000. This was the second fire of the day (the first was 30 acres) for park fire crews, and the third in two days. Conditions in the area have been very dry and windy; 32 wildland fires occurred in the counties surrounding the park in the first four days of the month.

L.G. had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute marijuana following his arrest last August for drug deals which took place both within and outside the park. L.G., who has a history of drug use, drug dealing and violence, was committed to the custody of the U.S. Marshal at the time of the hearing because of threats he made against a witness in the case. [Duncan Hollar, CI, NERI, 2/9]\n\nMonday, March 29, 1993\n\n93-147 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Search and Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of March 20th, T.G. and J.V. set out on a seven-mile kayaking trip down a very steep run from Glade Creek in Babcock State Park through Manns Creek to the New River. Following the trip, they planned on carrying their kayaks back up a steep trail to Babcock, where their shuttle vehicle was waiting. This was the first time the pair had seen the creeks; because of the steep and rugged run, the trip required more scouting and portaging then anticipated, so the two men did not arrive at the confluence with the New River until well after dark. They decided to walk out but were unable to agree on the best route to take. T.G. decided to walk straight up the mountain through the woods back toward Babcock, while J.V. walked upriver toward Thurmond along the railroad right-of-way paralleling the river. J.V. reached Thurmond around 11 p.m. and reported T.G. still missing. Rangers were contacted about 45 minutes later and began making plans for a search operation. At 7:45 a.m. the next day, rangers found him near the top of the gorge about two miles south of the state park. T.G. had been hiking around in circles all night, and had carried his kayak and gear up the steep canyon with him. Although tired, thirsty and hungry, he was otherwise in good shape. [Rick Brown, DR, NERI, 3/26]\n\nMonday, March 29, 1993\n\n93-148 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Derailment Prevented\n\nWhile participating in the above search at about 5 a.m. on the 21st, ranger Kinsey Shilling discovered a rock slide along a main CSX railroad line. Shilling had driven down the railroad right-of-way toward Sewell about a half hour previously and was headed back toward Thurmond when he discovered the access road blocked by the slide. Due to the recent wet weather, a huge boulder - about twelve by eight by eight feet - had torn loose from a point near the top of the gorge and rolled down the canyon, hitting the tracks and bending the rails. Shilling immediately radioed dispatch, who contacted CSX dispatch by phone. Trains on the track were immediately contacted and alerted about the hazard. Within ten minutes of Shilling's discovery, a coal train over a mile long and powered by four engines approached the scene of the slide, but the engineer was able to stop well ahead of time because of the warning he'd received. The engineer praised Shilling for his quick report and stated that the bent track would have definitely derailed the train. A second train arrived on the scene behind the first one within 20 minutes of the initial report. Shilling's prompt action very likely prevented either a second derailing or a collision between the two trains.

T.D.E. and M.W., 24, of Shrewsbury, had been fishing on the river and were walking along the tracks with their dog when the train approached from behind them, coming around a slight curve. T.D.E. and M.W. stepped off opposite sides of the railroad, but the dog remained in the middle of the tracks. T.D.E. went back on the tracks to get the dog and M.W. leaned over to try to pull her off. The train hit all three at approximately the same time. T.D.E. was thrown approximately 40 feet over an embankment and apparently was killed instantly. M.W. was thrown about 15 feet and suffered severe head injuries and other major trauma. The dog was killed. Rangers responded and provided medical treatment to M.W. and utilized a CSX highrailer as an evacuation vehicle. M.W. was taken to Fayette Landing by the highrailer, then to a helispot at Canyon Rim visitor center, where he was evacuated by helicopter to Charleston Area Medical Center for treatment. He remains in critical condition in the intensive care unit. The freight train was approximately 150 cars long and was empty at the time of the accident. It took the conductor about a thousand feet to bring the train to a stop after the accident. A joint investigation by rangers and state police is underway.

A.T. was swimming alone in the river just above Fayette Station Rapid (a Class IV rapid) and was swept downstream by the current. He was able to make it to shore just before being swept through the rapid. As he was exiting the river, he struck his leg on rocks near the shoreline and severely fractured his knee. A.T. then climbed on an exposed rock near the shoreline and began shouting for help. A party camping on the opposite side of the river heard him and went to his aid. After finding him, they called for assistance. Rangers and local rescue squads responded, provided EMS and stabilized his injuries. Rangers conducted a technical rescue up the steep bank to the railroad tracks and used a homemade rail cart to transport him to an ambulance. CSX Railroad helped out by holding all traffic on the tracks until the rescue was completed. A.T. was taken to a local hospital, where he received treatment. It was later determined that A.T. had earlier been jumping from the 75-foot-high Fayette Station Bridge, and he admitted that he'd been drinking at the time of the incident. [Rick Brown, DR, NERI, 6/20]\n\nTuesday, June 22, 1993\n\n93-386 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Assault\n\nOn June 19th, several members of a group of twelve people camping in Brooklyn Bottom, including five Marines, passed through an adjacent camp occupied by two couples over the period of about an hour while en route to the New River to fish. One of them entered the camp just to talk and be social. During the conversation, J.R., 39, of Piney View, West Virginia, told the person to leave and that he wanted the entire group to pack up and leave the area. J.R. became increasingly belligerent; there were some verbal confrontations with other members of the twelve-person party, during which J.R. made threats and ordered them out of the area. J.R. then took up a shotgun, brandished it, made more threats, and fired it in the general direction of all twelve members of the party. Although no one was hit by the blast and there were no other injuries during the confrontation, the group immediately packed up and left the area. After receiving a report of the incident, rangers responded and investigated. J.R. was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, brandishing a firearm, and possession and use of a firearm. The incident is still under investigation. [Rick Brown, DR, NERI, 6/20]\n\nTuesday, June 22, 1993\n\n93-391 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Assist; Homicide\n\nOn June 19th, local FBI agents requested the assistance of rangers in an on- going homicide investigation. Recent information from Gadsden County, Florida, led agents to believe that the body of J.T.M., 32, of Apollo, Pennsylvania, was inside the park. Late on the morning of June 19th, a combined team of FBI agents and Fayette and Raleigh County investigators found J.T.M.'s body adjacent to the park's boundary in the Garden Ground area of the Grandview Subdistrict. Two local residents - S.P., 31, of Eccles, and K.A.A., 37, of Oak Hill - were arrested in Jacksonville, Florida. K.A.A. confessed to the crime and provided directions to the body. J.T.M.'s body was deposited in the area on June 12th, the same night that rangers recovered two stolen vehicles and arrested two individuals at the same location. Probability is high that rangers were in the area recovering the stolen vehicles during the time that the couple drove into the area to dispose of J.T.M.'s body. [Duncan Hollar, Acting CR, NERI, 6/20]\n\nThursday, June 24, 1993\n\n93-397 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Rescue\n\nB.B. of Fremont, Ohio, was rafting with a local outfitter on the afternoon of June 21st when she injured her neck when she was thrown against another passenger while negotiating a Class IV rapid. Rangers responded, placed B.B. in a stokes basket, and belayed her up a low angle slope from the river's edge to the railroad tracks above. She was then transferred to a CSX highrailer and taken to an awaiting ambulance, where she was transported to a local hospital for treatment. [Kinsey Shilling, SDR, NERI, 6/23]\n\nThursday, July 8, 1993\n\n93-453 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Rescue\n\nAt about 1:15 p.m. on July 3rd, S.H., 17, of Oak Hill, West Virginia, fell from a 70-foot high cliff in the Kaymoor I area of the park. S.H. and two companions had been hiking in the area all morning. He left the established trails and was scrambling around near the top of the cliff when he slipped on wet leaves and tumbled down the near vertical slope. A ranger who was on backcountry patrol in the immediate area at the time responded to his cries for help and arrived within five minutes of the fall. Rangers and members of a local ambulance squad provided emergency medical support. The park's SAR team conducted a talus belay and steep overland litter evacuation of about a half mile to the waiting ambulance. S.H. was taken to a local hospital and treated for possible fractures of an arm and both legs, head trauma with lacerations, and possible internal injuries. [Rick Brown, Canyon DR, NERI, 7/6]\n\nFriday, August 13, 1993\n\n93-595 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Drug Seizure\n\nOn August 10th and 11th, NPS investigators, rangers and members of the Raleigh County regional drug task force executed a number of search warrants in the park, arrested four people on state felony drug charges, and arrested two additional people on federal drug charges. One of those arrested on federal charges had previously done prison time for murder. During the investigation and subsequent arrests, approximately 30 pounds of processed marijuana valued at about $100,000 was seized. Drug paraphernalia and three firearms, including a 9mm machine pistol, were also confiscated. Further seizures of property, possibly including cars and/or buildings, may be forthcoming. This case originated through the observations and initial investigations of patrol rangers working out of the park's Grandview Subdistrict. [Chris Schrader, CI, NERI, 8/12]\n\nTuesday, August 24, 1993\n\n93-631 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Assault; Illegal Weapon\n\nAround 9:30 a.m. on the morning of August 19th, rangers received a report of a man - later identified as J.G. of Fayetteville, West Virginia - shooting a sawed-off shotgun and threatening people in the Cunard Landing area along the New River. Maintenance worker F.B. contacted rangers by radio and kept J.G., who was on foot, in sight for approximately 30 minutes until rangers arrived on scene. Without F.B.'s prompt action, J.G. would have escaped. J.G. was apprehended by rangers just after 11 a.m. He was found to be in possession of a ten-inch filet knife and a sawed-off 7.62mm rifle (originally reported as a shotgun) with one round in the chamber. The rifle, which had a barrel length of just under nine inches and an overall length of just under 19 inches, was being carried in a small suitcase/box. J.G. also had pornographic magazines and girl's underpants in his possession. Upon investigation, it was learned that J.G. is a convicted felon with charges of gross sexual imposition against him in the state of Ohio, that he's been arrested in the past for rape and kidnapping, and that he's a member of the Hell's Angels. J.G. has been charged with possession of an illegal firearm, which is a felony; he'll also be charged with assault with a deadly weapon, threatening, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Rangers are investigating the possibility of a sexual assault which may have occurred the night before, when J.G. allegedly accosted two women campers in the Cunard area. It was this incident that led to his use of the illegal weapon. [Rick Brown, NERI, 8/22]\n\nMonday, August 30, 1993\n\n93-636 - New River Gorge (West Virginia) - Search for Murderers\n\nRangers assisted several state and local law enforcement agencies in a search of the New River Gorge area for two fleeing murderers for three days last week. C.S. and B.H. escaped from the Huttonsville correctional facility while on a work detail on August 11th, and subsequently committed three execution-style murders in the northern part of the state. They fled in a vehicle after the second murder incident, in which "
