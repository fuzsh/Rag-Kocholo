        "text": "Here's the listing of the song's credits from the 1977 double-disc compilation album Linda Ronstadt...A Retrospective (Capitol SKBB-11629). Often people don't realize that Linda and Bernie go back to the Stone Poneys era, but Linda sang on Hearts and Flowers records (also produced by Venet) even before Bernie joined that group. Interesting that Capitol credits Kenny Edwards with being on \"Different Drum\". He always said he wasn't:\n\n\"We actually learned that song off of a bluegrass Greenbriar Boys album,\" reveals Edwards. \"We cut a version very much like that, with mandolin, kind of a jug bandy, bluegrass-lite version. That's when Nik Venet sort of took an executive position and went, 'This could be a hit song, and we need to sort of have an arranger arrange it.' So none of us actually played on the record version of that.\"\n\nhttp://www.richieunterberger.com/venet.html\n\nOf course A Retrospective features several alternate mixes, so it's possible his original guitar part is buried in the mix of that version, but I don't think that's very likely.\n\nAttached Files:\n\ndifferent_drum_credits.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n79.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n3\n\nI know the mono press of Evergreen Vol. 2 has the extended middle break...are you saying some stereos have it also?\n\nDale\n\nPS: After listening to all these versions, I'd still go with the original (not the live video) Stone Poneys version -- Linda's defiant vocal, plus the arrangement that I happen to like -- perfect for 1967 pop. Mike Nesmith's later take on his own song is cool too, but with a very different attitude. Probably the way he intended it to sound. The Greenbriar Boys version is great -- I'll have to track that one down. All the others have their strong points. Susanna Hoffs with Matthew Sweet is nice, but I find her voice too sweet for the bitterness in the song. The Lemonheads is a great rock take on the tune, but geez who EQ'd the high end on that? Sheesh I gotta wipe the blood out of my ears.\n\nI think the Sara Watkins version (s) might move up to my 2nd favorite.\n\nDale\n\nI have owned stereo pressings with the \"long\" and \"short\" versions, yes. Would love to hear the mono press.\n\nHowever, as I haven't played mine in a while, I have to dig it out myself to hear the vocal-to-the-side mix, which I honestly do NOT recall.\n\nThe long mix I have on my hard drive sounds like a modern remix: Vocals centered, Harpsichord left, strings centered, drums & chunky bass to the right.\n\nAnd it sounds absolutely heavenly, but I have no recollection where I got it from.\n\nI, too, think Linda & The Poneys version is the definitive one, although it was interesting to hear Nez do it, because let's face it. The \"I ain't saying you ain't pretty\" line is obviously more suited to be sung from a male point of view.....but either way it works.\n\nThat's funny you mention that.\n\nI've heard a few stereo versions recently, most versions I hear have the bass/drum on the right, but one version had the channels swapped and was quite bright - I think that was from Warner's Time Life series.\n\nI swear there are some odd faults in the sound here and there. At points in the song Linda's vocal seems to drop off as if there was a drop out on the tape her vocal track was originally recorded to. At these points it also seems as if her voice drifts from centre to either left or right.\n\nGenerally speaking, I think it'd be better to have her vocal a little higher in the mix too.\n\nI'll have to look around for that version you mention. With some tweaking I may be able to get something better than the versions I have heard.\n\nDidn't our host do this track on the Greatest Hits Vol.1 DCC CD? How does that one fair? I'd imagine pretty damn good, or at least as good as the source tape is ever going to sound.\n\nI've always loved this song and it was great to hear all of these versions.\n\nStill, the original Stone Poneys version is the best with the harpsicord and the sweeteness - Linda's finest moment ever in my opinion. It's just such a charming record.\n\nKudos for the Lemonheads for rethinking it in a pretty cool way.\n\nAnd the Greenbriars was cool to hear also.\n\nSuzanna? Nope, a bit overbaked.\n\nSara Watkins? Great to hear - real nice to hear younguns doing some real organic music with an ear to the past. Lovely.\n\nWhat a history for this song!\n\nThanks to the posters here...."
