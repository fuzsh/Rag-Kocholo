        "text": "I was a 60-year-old woman when I was first incarcerated in 2010 at Alderson Federal Prison Camp (FPC), one of the few federal womenâs prison camps in the United States. A month before I entered prison, my friend Russ Rothman called to tell me Martha Stewart had served her time there when she was 63. He had googled Alderson, nicknamed âCamp Cupcake,â and had found they had tennis courts and an outdoor swimming poolâmore like a country club than a prison, he said. Russ assured me I would be okayâ¦and instructed me to bring my racket.\n\nMy mother had Martha Stewart on her mind too. Not realizing that Martha had actually gone to trial and lost, she said, âMartha Stewart pled guilty and went to prison for six months. Why donât you plead guilty, go to prison, and get this nightmare over with. You canât beat city hall.â My mother also used my love of watching 24/7 TV news in her efforts to persuade me. She said, âAt least you will get cable TV in prison. I didnât get that in Auschwitz.â I had no words.\n\nUltimately, my mother was right: I couldnât beat the governmentâs charges of tax evasion and mail fraud, even though I was innocent. And so, eight years after Martha went to prison, my case went to trial and I was convicted. But from the moment I entered Alderson, I realized it was no country club. After being fingerprinted and having my mug shot taken, I was given ânewbieâ clothes, that is, the clothes inmates wear for the first day only. The slip-on sneakers were two sizes too large; the bra had as little material as a G-string and didnât hold my breasts in place. The oversized outfit could have fit two women.\n\nAfter this initial intake, I waited with three other new arrivals in a freezing cell in the Receiving and Discharge (R & D) building. We got the prison bag lunch of a bologna sandwich, cookies, an apple, and a water. When we missed dinner, we got another bag of bologna sandwiches.\n\nSoon after our arrival, R & D officers gave each of us a large laundry bag which contained a blanket, two sheets, soap, shampoo, a comb, a toothbrush, and, most importantly, âMaximum Securityâ deodorant.\n\nThe R & D building was separated from the sleeping quarters (the âunitsâ) by a long stretch known as âHallelujah Hill.â For some, this nickname was a reference to its proximity to the prison chapel, but for the older crowd, making it to the top merited a shout of âHallelujah.â During my first trek to the Admissions and Orientation (A & O) units, I was forced to stop several times to catch my breath while carrying the heavy laundry bag. I lagged far behind the younger women.\n\nDuring my first two weeks in prison, I went through orientation with thirty other women. Correctional officers showed us a film on the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and emphasized there was to be no lesbian sex. I understood that to mean lesbian sex was the only kind of sex that merited punishment, as opposed to some of the contractorsâ well-known proclivity for sexually abusing prisoners. They also lectured us on the rules of the compound, the different facilities, and told us we had to work.\n\nIn Alderson, everyone was required to work in the kitchen for their first 90 days. That is, everyone but Martha Stewart, who requested but was denied kitchen duty. I suspect she was refused because this chore might have given her an inkling of pleasure within the miserable prison environment. She was instead assigned instead to the humiliating task of mopping the floors and cleaning the toilets of the warden and other higher-ups.\n\nMy first job at the Alderson kitchen was cleaning floors after the lunch and dinner shift. Although I worked seven or eight hours a day, I earned only $5.25 during my first month. There were also few accommodations based on ageâelderly women were given the exact same jobs as younger women; even older women who could barely walk had to endure the long work hours. And after our work was done, we were not permitted to go back to the unit between lunch and dinner. We were not allowed to read, do crossword puzzles, knit, play cards, or sleep. Instead, everyone had to spend long hours in plastic seats attached to the table. As an older woman, this took a real toll on me physically.\n\nAny basis for incarceration is outweighed by the negative consequences older adults experience behind bars.\n\nAfter my days of kitchen duty were up, I got transferred to the landscaping department, which meant that, at the age of 60, I was charged with the backbreaking work of mowing the lawns in the hot summer and shoveling snow in the winter. Once, I was assigned a heavy 1950s-style lawnmower but could not get it started without assistance. When I went to push it, I couldnât even move it an inch.\n\nAfter I went to landscaper and asked for a different assignment, he gave me a broom and instructed me to sweep the streets. I cleaned the road of rocks but quickly realized that the area would be filled again as soon as a truck came by. And so, I asked the officer if I could remove the stones and put them far from the road. He replied, âBut then you would have nothing to do.â\n\nAt an age where working a physically demanding job for seven- and eight-hour days was grueling, I served as the Sisyphus of Alderson, sweeping rocks off the streets only to see my work undone by passing vehicles. My experience is far from unique. While there are 75,000 prisoners over the age of 60 that are under the jurisdiction of correctional authorities, accommodations that take into accountÂ the reality of aging behind bars are all too rare.\n\nWhat Iâve come to realize is that although older people do commit crimes that warrant punishment, there are few reasons, public safety or otherwise, to incarcerate elders. Certainly, any basis for incarceration is outweighed by the negative consequences we experience behind bars. Instead, we need alternatives to incarceration that acknowledge that older people are too vulnerable a population to be held in our prisons and jails.\n\nAs for Martha Stewart, well, Martha was lucky. She went home to a billion dollar company. But as for me, Iâm homeless, broke, and living proof that Alderson is no âCamp Cupcake.â\n\nIf you donât have a job, or you want a better one, advertisements like these may seem promising:\n\nCLEANERS â NOW STAFFING â F/T & P/T, no exp needed. Up to $29.00 per hour.\n\nThe U.S. economy continues to improve and the unemployment rate is decreasing, reaching a seven-year low of 5.2 percent in New York City in September, according to the New York State Department of Labor. But many people are still looking for a job or seeking a better one, which can be a stressful and time-consuming process. Lured by advertisements and the promise of work, some turn to an employment agency for help.\n\nThe New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), which I serve as Commissioner, licenses and regulates employment agencies. While we are very vigilant in our protection of job seekers, with such a high demand for services and many people desperately in need of work, there are inevitably those who try to take advantage of vulnerable individuals. This has led to a proliferation of predatory employment agencies that exploit the unemployed or underemployed who are trying their best to provide for their families.\n\nOne of these individuals was Rosa. After paying $125 to an employment agency, the agency sent her to a laundromat that they claimed was looking for workers. However, when Rosa went to inquire about the job, the owner of the laundromat said they were not hiring and had never asked for workers. Rosa returned to the employment agency asking for a refund, but was refused one. Their only response to her was that she was âtoo oldâ and so the laundromat just didnât want to hire her.\n\nAnd Marlon, a man from Queens, New York, paid a $125 advance fee to an employment agency plus a $774 fee for a construction training class. The agency guaranteed Marlon a job. Not only did it fail to come through on that promise, it never even referred him to a potential employer. When Marlon returned to the agency to demand a refund, the office had been abandoned.\n\nGet Talk Poverty In Your Inbox\n\nWe at DCA have seen too many job seekers respond to ads for employment only to have agencies charge them illegal fees as high as $1,400âfor processing their application, background checks, or ârequiredâ trainings like Marlonâs. Many of these agencies operate without a license, send people to jobs that donât exist, or place them in jobs that donât pay minimum wage.\n\nThis is a growing problem among our immigrant and low-income communities, as they are often the main target of these scams. Over the past year, DCA received more than 600 complaints about employment agencies, and as a result initiated more than 225 investigations into both unlicensed and licensed offices. In the past year, DCA has issued more than 400 violations and secured more than $77,000 in restitution for 269 consumers who were charged illegal and predatory fees.\n\nDCA has also increased its education and advocacy work in this industry. Together with New Immigrant Community Empowerment (NICE), DCA recently created a Job Hunterâs Bill of Rights, which is available in eight languages. It outlines what employment agencies can and cannot do. Advocacy groups have been distributing it to employers and job seekers throughout New York City. Some of the rights and responsibilities noted include: an individualâs right to a full refund of any advance fee if an agency doesnât find that worker a job or if a job offer isnât accepted; the job seekerâs right to file a complaint regardless of immigration status; and the requirement that employment agencies refer workers only to employers that are hiring.\n\nâEvery day, predatory employment agencies take advantage of unemployed low-wage and immigrant workers,â saysÂ Manuel Castro, Executive Director of NICE. âThatâs whyÂ [we have]Â worked with DCA on this Bill of Rights. With DCA cracking down on bad actors, and a campaign pushing for legislative reform, low-wage job seekers will be better protected when looking for quality jobs.â\n\nWe urge New Yorkers to know their rights, including the right to submit a complaint to DCA about employment agencies in New York. For job hunters who choose to use an employment agency, itâs important to check the local laws and know your rights. Here in New York City, get our tips and read the Job Hunterâs Bill of Rights. There are laws and rules that can protect the unemployed and underemployed from these predatory practices. Knowing those rights is the first step.\n\nAuthorâs note: Read the results from DCAâs investigations of employment agencies.\n\nJust last month, Urban Outfitters became the newest addition to a growing list of retailers that have ended the use of on-call scheduling for their employees. This practice, which requires employees to plan their lives around the mere possibility of having to work, has been subjected to an investigation from the New York Attorney Generalâs office and damning stories in the press.\n\nSure, the fact that Urban Outfitters and other retailers such as The Gap, J. Crew, Bath & Body Works and Victoriaâs Secret are nixing an abusive practice is laudable. In addition to heading off potential legal trouble, their decisions over the past several months demonstrate that companies are listening to the needs of their employees and the questions being raised by customers.\n\nBut letâs not let these headlines fool us into thinking that all is well in the retail industry. Despite Urban Outfitters abandoning the practice, many large profitable restaurant and retail chains continue to intentionally deny employees more hours and use scheduling systems that wreak havoc on their ability to take care of their families.\n\nFor example, itâs common for employees to find out whether or not they need to work a shiftÂ mere hours before they are scheduled to start. In fact, almost half of the service industry employees surveyed in Washington, D.C. reported that they first learned of their work schedules less than one week in advance. Nearly one-third received less than 24 hoursâ notice of schedule changes.\n\nAnd the problem goes beyond not knowing when youâll work. Itâs also about not knowing how much youâll work. Plenty of companies force their employees to keep their schedules open with the possibility of being scheduled full-time, but then only assign and compensate workers for part-time hours. And being sent home before the end of a scheduled shift is then passed off as a natural part of the job.\n\nThese practices add a whole new level of volatility to peopleâs lives. Not knowing when youâll work from week to week can make it difficult or men and women to arrange child care, pursue education or training, or hold down a second job to make ends meet. Itâs also next to impossible to budget when you donât know if youâll be scheduled for 10 hours or 40, or if youâll be sent home an hour early each day.\n\nIt is possible for businesses to be productive while allowing their employees to lead stable, meaningful lives\n\nLuckily, weâre making strides so that the lives of the people who ring up our purchases and serve our food are less turbulent.\n\nIn San Francisco, community leaders, labor advocates and retail employees came together and enacted the first set of comprehensive and meaningful standards that would address this issue. Now, when an employer cancels an on-call shift with less than 24 hoursâ notice, they must pay the employee two to four hours. The new rules also mandate that schedules are posted two weeks ahead of time and that the nationâs biggest and most profitable retailers must provide part-time employees with more access to hours before hiring additional part-time workers. Acknowledging that scheduling and hours are just part of the picture, the organizers of this initiative also worked to successfully raise San Franciscoâs minimum wage to $15.\n\nThis victory has inspired similar efforts in Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts. On the national level, the Schedules That Work Act would ensure that everyone has the right to request a predictable schedule.\n\nAnd so, as this momentum grows, business owners would be wise to look to their colleagues to see the benefits of consistent scheduling for both their employeesâ livelihoods and their businessâs productivity.\n\nTake Costco: in addition to offering better rates of pay and benefits than competitors, it guarantees many part-time employees a minimum of 24 hours and provides two weeks of advance notice for scheduling. As a result of these policies, the company boasts one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry.\n\nSmall business owners have also adopted stable scheduling. Tony Lucca, the owner of two D.C. restaurants, gives his employees their schedule a month in advance and uses an online scheduling system that gives employees a say in when they work. And Gina Schaefer, the owner of a number of Ace Hardware stores in the District, makes sure shifts are made available to part-time employees first before hiring anyone new.\n\nWe know that it is possible for businesses to be productive while allowing their employees to lead stable, meaningful lives. So yes, letâs cheer on the companies who are ending on-call scheduling. But as Black Friday approaches, letâs not forget that the real change will come when all families in our community achieve the strong wages, reliable hours, and sane schedules that they need in order to build a good life.\n\nSocial Security is our nationâs most effective anti-poverty program. The systemâs modest but vital benefits lifted 21.4 million Americans out of poverty in 2014, including 1.1 million children. It could lift millions more if we expand the programâs benefitsâbut things have taken a distressing step in the opposite direction.\n\nIn recent years, low and non-existent cost-of-living adjustments (âCOLAsâ) have been gradually eroding the value of Social Security benefits. These COLAs are calculated using an inflation measure that is intended to reflect costs faced by workers. The measure does not accurately account for costs faced by seniors and Americans with disabilities, who spend a far higher percentage of their income on health care.\n\nTo the wealthy few, the extra $40 or $50 a month from a COLA increase might not seem like a big deal. But to elderly Social Security beneficiaries, this increase is much-needed income that they can use to put food on the table and pay for lifesaving prescriptions.\n\nThatâs why Social Securityâs 59 million beneficiaries were devastated to hear the news that, for only the third time in 40 years, there will be no COLA in 2016. They know that the cost of basic necessities, including medical care, prescription drugs, food, and housing, has continued to increase. But their benefits are not increasing accordingly and are losing their purchasing power. If this trend continues, younger generations will have effectively lower benefits, even though the decline of pensions and rising inequality means that they will be even more reliant on these benefits than their parents and grandparents are.\n\nAnd this isnât just hurting Social Security beneficiaries. The same formula is used to calculate the COLA for many other programs, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and various veteransâ benefits including Disability Compensation benefits, pension benefits, and Military Retirement Pay. For the millions of Americansâparticularly veteransâwho receive Social Security as well as one or more of these other benefits, a year without a COLA is a double or triple whammy.\n\nGet Talk Poverty In Your Inbox\n\nBut there is hopeful news. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime champion of Social Security, is on the case. She is sponsoring the SAVE Benefits act, a billâalready supported by twenty of her colleaguesâwhich would send every Social Security beneficiary (as well as others impacted by the lack of a COLA) a one-time payment of about $581 to cover next yearâs lack of a COLA increase.\n\nThat payment would make a serious difference in the lives of millions of beneficiaries. For many seniors, it could cover over three months of groceries. For others, it may cover the average Medicare out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs. Itâs no surprise that the SAVE Benefits Act would lift over one million Americans out of poverty.\n\nSenator Warrenâs bill is fully funded by closing the âperformance payâ loophole, which allows big corporations to take a tax deduction for the lavish compensation packages they give their wealthy CEOs. This loophole costs taxpayers about $9.7 billion dollars every year. The SAVE Benefits Act uses some of these savings to provide the 70 million Americans who are not receiving a COLA with the much-needed $581 checks. The rest would go into the Social Security trust fund to bolster the programâs long-term actuarial balance.\n\nPassing the SAVE Benefits Act is an essential step, but it is only the first step. To permanently address the gradual erosion of Social Security benefits, Congress must pass legislation adopting an updated measurement tailored to reflect the real living costs (such as high health care expenses) that seniors and Americans with disabilities face, for calculating future COLAs. And to permanently tackle our countryâs looming retirement income crisis, and address the millions of seniors and people with disabilities already living in poverty, Congress must expand Social Securityâs modest benefits.\n\nThis is a powerful movement that is gaining momentum every day. The American peopleÂ overwhelmingly supportÂ expanding Social Security’s benefits by requiring the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. Forty-three Senators and over 100 U.S. Representatives have pledged to support expanding benefits, not cutting them.\n\nSocial Security has been a resounding success for over 80 years. Now is the time to build upon that legacy.\n\nTwenty years ago, I packed my gold Chevy Nova and drove across the Mississippi River toward Madison, Wisconsin. Like so many others who uproot from their hometowns, I did so for a better gig.\n\nIn my case, that gig was working as an editor-writer at a magazine, and I jumped at the chance. As a 29-year-old writer, I didnât see any opportunities for growth in St. Louis. This was a town, after all, that had slowly sucked civic pride right out of me. Underneath its veneer of friendliness, St. Louis felt like a dystopian world in which everyone is in play or being played by forces known and unknown.\n\nIt was a place, in fact, where a group of CEOs and wealthy elites working under the mantle of âCivic Progressâ made the real decisions about the cityâs direction. The benefits of said âprogressâ never extended to me or other members of my communityânot in terms of adequate jobs, housing, education or anything else that would offer us the opportunity to thrive.\n\nOn August 9, 2014, these tensions between the powerful and the disregarded boiled over when an 18-year-old black teenager was shot by a 28-year-old white police officer. I was in St. Louis at the time, celebrating my motherâs 70th birthday with families and friends. Our joy quickly turned to sorrow, frustration, and anger. We gathered around the television and watched as police officers, dressed for war, met protesters with batons, tear gas, and rubber bullets.\n\nThese events added to the sense of exclusion and disaffection that I had experienced during my years growing up in St. Louisâfeelings that persisted until this September when I downloaded the 16-person Ferguson Commission report. Instead of burying the institutionalized racism and poverty my community has struggled with, the authors state an unequivocal truth: âWe know that talking about race makes a lot of people uncomfortable. But make no mistake: this is about race.â\n\nThe report is an indictment of a country that is breaking the backs and hopes of the poor and people of color.\n\nIn painstaking fashion, the report details how multiple municipalities in the region use poor, black citizens as veritable cash machines, collecting fines and fees from them to fill the city coffers. The Commission adds to the findings of an Arch City Defenders report, which had revealed that one town, Bel Ridgeâabout the size of a square mile with a population of 2,700 people, 81 percent of whom are black and 42 percent in povertyâfiled almost 8,000 cases in municipal court. Almost a quarter of the cityâs revenues came from court fines and fees.\n\nFor me, reading the report evoked a memory going back some thirty years when I watched the police try to arrest my mother.\n\nMy father was out enjoying his morning routine, grabbing coffee at White Castle and reading the paper, when two police officersâone older and gruff, the other younger and visibly apprehensiveâcame to the door and announced that my mother was under arrest for amassing parking fines; fines that were all incurred in front of our house, mostly for alternate-side parking violations. Forking over cash for fines just didnât rank as high as other needs like paying the mortgage and buying food.\n\nNeither officer was expecting Angela Davis, but thatâs what they got. My mother sat on the staircase in the foyer and said she wasnât getting up. They threatened her and tried to pick her up, but she pulled away and yelled. Things escalated when the older police officer shouted at my grandmother who was slowed by a stroke and trying to calm the situation. The front door was open and a crowd gathered.\n\nThe older officer unbuttoned the holster to his service revolver and placed his hand on the grip. My mother said, âWell, itâs a good goddamned day to die.â\n\nThirty years later she tells me she has never been more scaredâor more defiantâthan at that moment. Like so many others who have had similar experiencesâsome of whom are included in the Ferguson reportâher resistance was not rooted in hatred of the police. Her brother, her father, two of her unclesâthey were all in law enforcement. This was about respect. My mother offered to pay the fine in person on Monday, but the officers wanted it their way.\n\nJust as I thought the arrest was about to become terrifyingly violent, my father came home. I remember how he shifted from confusion to fear to anger.\n\nNow that I am about the same age as my father was then, I realize he had felt what so many black men feel in situations like that: emasculation. My father, the Marine, the civil engineer, with no criminal pastâthe man who talked philosophy with friends and could handle himself around roughneck construction workersâwas forced to navigate a path that a white man of the same socio-economic status would likely not encounter. They didnât have that history of police harassment; black male subjugation in the face of a baton or gun; and the gut punch of knowing that the man behind the badge has total control over you.\n\nGet Talk Poverty In Your Inbox\n\nThankfully, a higher-ranking police officer, who was black, arrived on the scene. He sorted it out and reprimanded the lead officer. The next day my parents paid the fine with a little help from a family member. If my mother had been arrested, the cost to my parentsâbail, a lawyer, court fees, the fine itselfâwould have financially crippled us.\n\nThe Ferguson report demonstrates that my familyâs experience was not unique, and that the truths laid bare in the document donât just apply to Ferguson, the St. Louis area, or Missouri. In fact, the report is an indictment of a country that is breaking the backs and hopes of the poor and people of color.\n\nBut the report also offers sweeping reforms that would help us move beyond the current, unjust status quoâactions raging from police training and consolidating police departments, to court and sentencing reform, to increasing healthcare coverage for the poor and addressing hunger, to raising the minimum wage, ending predatory lending, and investing in quality job training for disconnected youth that leads to employment.\n\nIn recognizing the lived realities of African Americansâand offering reforms that speak to those experiencesâthe Ferguson report is a blueprint on how to tear down the racial wall that divides us. Now we need to respond with action, until young black people no longer have to leave repressive hometowns in search of opportunity as I did."
