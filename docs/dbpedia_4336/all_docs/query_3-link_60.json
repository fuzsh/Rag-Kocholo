The bottom right is Mr Bones or Mr Bone, something like that. I got Baron Weirwulf also, but those top right three are bugging me. Three, like most of you. I recognize two or three others from the horror comics (like @michaelekrupp said), but have no idea of their names.

Also, Mike Nesmith had a guitar solo and he was fantastic, I've always known he was a real musician and went on to become a music producer. the whole Lee Majors thing reminded me of the greatness of classic TV.\n\nP.S.\n\nStill 3 Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by sportshort\n\njust as an aside, I am watching The Monkeys and they just sang the Last Train to Clarksville.

I even saw the monkey's play live!!! They were in reruns as a kid and they played in Toronto when i was like 10...so mid 80\"s....it was great. A few years later i even got to see John Kay and Steppenwolf!!! I also had three ... Blue Beetle, Steve Austin, and The Phantom. I was really impressed that the artist captured Lee Majors well enough to recognize him. With such a small sketch? That's master-level caricature right there."
