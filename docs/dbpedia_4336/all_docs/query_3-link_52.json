        "text": "Lagniappe\n\nSweet Susannah’s writer: Gib Guilbeau\n\nBarry Ancelet — folklorist, author, Grammy-nominated musician, and founder of the Center for Acadian and Creole Folklore at ULL — writes that Sweet Susannah “was written by Floyd ‘Gib’ Guilbeau, a singer-songwriter originally from Sunset, Louisiana, who had moved out of the state in pursuit of a bigger musical career in the 1960s. He played with a number of people, including Linda Ronstadt (who recorded a version with Guilbeau and Swampwater, her backup band after the Stone Poneys), and the Gram Parsons in the Flying Burrito Brothers, among others.”\n\nHe also informs us that the new President-Mayor of Lafayette, Louisiana, Josh Guillory, is a son of Clint West. Which brings us to the next bit of lagniappe.\n\nName check\n\nWe heard from Clint West’s eldest son, Clinton Joseph Guillory II. His Facebook text was the kind of thing a writer never wants to hear: I got the subject’s first name wrong. I wrote that he “was born Maurice Guillory” When his name was really Clinton Guillory. How that happened or what made me think that was Clint West’s real name I have no idea. Here’s the text his son Clinton sent:\n\n“My only request: please correct the \"Maurice Guillory\" thing, if possible. lol. That has confused people for years. Many have copied your info without consulting Dad. My Dad's name is Clinton Joseph Guillory II. Maurice is a different person, no relation. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it upset Dad or anything, it's just confused biographers and historians over the years. The rest of the info is correct (well he's from L'anse Gris, not Vidrine, but they're both right there, and he did go to school at Vidrine High.) Also, he didn't \"form\" the Boogie Kings, he joined and took the bandleader spot in an already established local band that was formed by Doug Ardoin, Bert and Harris Miller from Eunice.”\n\nNice to be able to set the record (notes) straight. Sorry it took 46 years.\n\nSwamp Pop, Cajun, and Zydeco — in tokyo\n\nWhen the liner notes page first went online, I couldn’t remember the name of the man on the right."
