They were once part of a stock scenery collection at Steyer’s Opera House in Decorah, Iowa. The scenery was donated through the efforts of Dr. George D. Glenn and Richard Poole, authors of “The Opera Houses of Iowa.” Theatre Museum records indicate that some of the Steyer’s Opera House scenery was placed on display in 2001. When I visited the museum in 2017, the cottage shutters were still on display.\n\nSL shutter cover on display at the Theatre Museum in 2017.\n\nIn 1989, Glenn even made a 12 ½ minute documentary about the extant scenery, lighting, and stage machinery, entitled “Steyer’s Opera House.” Here is the YouTube link to the 1989 video: https://youtu.be/r_2l6pGmp3A?si=31RV5ShRr2lSka_w\n\nIn 1989 the third-floor opera house was an 1875 time-capsule of stage technology. At the time, it was possibly the oldest extant stage boasting an original 1875 scenery and stage machinery installation in North America.\n\nImage from George Glenn’s 1989 movie that shows the state of Steyer’s Opera House when he first visited the stage.\n\nAs is the case with many historic stages, new building owners, investors, and other stakeholders fail to understand the significance of what they have, especially stage artifacts. Fortunately, some of the scenes were transported to the Theatre Museum.\n\nI know of only one older scenic piece in North America – a front curtain painted by Russell Smith for the Thalian Hall in Wilmington, North Carolina (1858).\n\n1858 Front curtain by Russell Smith on display in the Thalian Hall lobby in Wilmington, North Carolina in 2019.\n\nPainted detail, 1858 Thalian Hall front curtain by Russell Smith.

Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nTo my knowledge, the Steyer’s Opera House contained the oldest collection of stage scenery, machinery, lighting equipment, “as delivered” until the 21st century. It still signifies some of the the oldest examples of signed American scenic art.\n\nSignature on the front of Steyer’s Opera House SR Cottage shutter.\n\nThe second oldest examples are 1888 wing-and-shutter scenery signed by Frank Cox for the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, Colorado. Amazingly, Dressel signed the front of the shutters. Cox signed the back.\n\nFrank Cox signature. Tree profile at the Tabor Opera House, Leadville, Colorado.\n\nThe Theatre Museum’s Dressel collection signifies the oldest extant example of stock scenery delivered to an American opera house. In addition to age, the creator of Steyer’s Opera House scenery was internationally recognized as an extremely skilled scenic artist. Dressel’s scenic art made news from Toronto to New Orleans in the nineteenth century.\n\nHere is the tale of Henry “Harry” Dressel.\n\nHenry Dressel was the fifth child born to F. Ludwig “Louis” Dressel (1817-) and Sophie Schmidt (1820-1899) in Hanover, Germany. In 1858, the Dressel family boarded a ship in Bremen and sailed for America. On Oct. 22, 1858, they arrived in Philadelphia aboard the Brig Amazone. The ship’s manifest listing Ludwig Dressel (40 yrs. cooper), Sophie (38 yrs.), Marie (15 yrs.), Christian (13 yrs.), George (9 yrs.), William (7 ½ yrs.), Henry (6 yrs.), Louise (5 yrs.), and Adolph (3 mths.).\n\nShip’s manifest with the Dressel family’s arrival in Philadelphia. Oct. 22, 1858.\n\nThe family soon settled in Chicago where Louis Dressel listed his established trade as cooper in the City Directory. Although the family initially lived in a boarding house on Kinzie, they soon secured permanent lodging at 227 N. Franklin. Dressel transitioned from cooper to a rectifier for Theodore Kraefft. Kraefft who not only sold wines and liquors (77 S. Water St.) but also operated a distillery (329 N. Wells St.). Dressel remained with the firm for some time; accepting whatever job came his way, continuing with the firm as it transitioned from Kraefft & Co. to Kraefft, Roelle & Co.\n\nIn 1870, the Dressel family were still living at their home on N. Franklin. However, Louis and William were now operating a retail grocery store, Dressel & Son. Meanwhile, Harry Dressel was listed as a fresco painter, boarding at 298 N. Franklin.\n\nWhile examining the 1870 Census report another name caught me eye – Fest. Living next door to 18 yrs. old Harry was the 19 yrs. old painter Oscar Fest. Fest was only a few months older than Dressel, having been born on Aug. 10, 1852, in Breslau, Germany. Fest and his parents had emigrated in 1853, five years before the Dressels.\n\nIn 1870, Fest was also living with his parents on N. Franklin. Both Harry Dressel and Oscar Fest started as decorative painters and later each became incredibly well-known scenic artists; Dressel in New Orleans and Fest in San Francisco. Both of their fathers had worked as coopers. It would have been quite unusual if the two families were not close. It would be uncommon for either Fest or Dressel to have apprenticed as painters after the age of 16. This means that their entrance into the painting profession occurred about 1867. Fest is even listed in the 1867 Chicago Directory a painter.\n\nBoth young men may have begun their artistic careers with Robert W. Hanington. Hanington was a wire shade and decorative artist who lived just up the street at 296 N. Franklin. Again, the first listing for Dressel as a fresco painter lists his residence as 298 N. Franklin.\n\nNorth Franklin street was destroyed by the great fire of 1871. The Dressel family immediately rebuilt their home and continued to live in the area. After all, both their home and grocery business had been in North Franklin when flames swept through in 1871.\n\nJust before the great Chicago Fire of 1871, Dressel began working as a scenic artist for the Globe Theater. Although he was listed in the 1872 Chicago Directory as a fresco painter, he was also listed as scenic artist for Chicago’s Globe Theatre that year.\n\nHis link to the Globe was advertised during the tour of Alderson’s Panorama that summer. Newspaper advertisements for the Chicago Fire Panorama listed four contributing artists for the 3,700 sq. ft. painting: one designer and three Chicago-based scenic artists:\n\nHenry Cross of the Academy of Design\n\nJ. Howard Rogers, scenic artist of McVicker’s Theatre\n\nHenry C. Tryon, scenic artist of Wood’s Museum\n\nHenry Dressel, scenic artist of the Globe Theatre\n\nI believe that Dressel first worked as an assistant to Rogers and Tryon at the Globe Theater when it opened in 1870. The Globe Theatre was initially referred to as the West Side Theatre, with Allen being the first proprietor and lessee of the place (The Chicago Evening Mail 31 Oct. 1870, p. 4). The great fire did not destroy the Globe Theatre, although it came close; crossing the river just a few blocks south. Despite many scenic artist’s losing their homes and employment, those at the Globe were fortunate. It is very likely that the Chicago Fire panorama was painted by Rogers, Tryon, and Dressel at the Globe Theatre.\n\nMap showing the Globe Theatre in relation to the river and burned district.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 1870, the Chicago Tribune advertised the opening of “Allen’s Globe Theatre, Des Plaines Street, West side, between Washington and Madison Streets” (p. 4). The announcement credited the Globe’s new scenery and drop curtain to Messrs. James Howard Rogers, John M. Kauffman, and Henry C. Tryon. Kaufmann relocated to Cincinnati by 1874, where he continued working as a scenic artist at local theaters for the remainder of the 19th century.\n\nPortrait of Henry C. Tryon in 1886.\n\nOf this grouping, Roger’s was the premiere artist of the group, with his scenic art solely mentioned in many articles. For example. On Nov. 22, 1870, the Chicago Tribune described, “The decorations of the auditorium are simple, but in great good taste, and the scenic artist, Mr. James Howard Rogers, has put forth his entire artistic skill in getting up the scenes, all of which are of real excellence. In the drop curtain Mr. Rogers has boldly departed from the eternal Lake of Como with its dreadfully Italian sky, etc.; and has drawn his inspiration from home. The picture represents the progress of civilization. It is a beautiful Western scene, composed of lake and mountains, a railroad train – the emblem of advancing civilization – crossing a bridge, and away to the westward, the Indian, with his bow and arrows, receding before it, and following his own setting sun. At the front of the curtain appears the inscription, “Westward the course of empire takes its flight” (p. 4). This article made it seem that Rogers painted everything by himself. Rogers was living in the city, however, as he was listed in the 1870 Chicago Directory: “Howard Rogers, scene painter, r. 34 Price pl.” The listing forgot to include the “J” in front of Howard Rogers.\n\nRogers maintained a close connection with the Globe, as his wife worked there in 1871. On Feb. 17, 1871, The Chicago Evening Mail announced, “Sick – Mrs. J. Howard Rogers, of Allen’s Globe Theatre, has for the last few days been extremely ill. Until yesterday, it was feared that she would not recover. She is better today” (p. 4).\n\nIt is important to remember that scenic art assistants were seldom credited in these theatrical endeavors. When both Tryon and Kauffman were credited, it was as legitimate contributors, not as assistants. Other articles solely credit Rogers as he boasted the biggest reputation at the time. Pot boys or scenic art assistants were never mentioned in metropolitan news.\n\nD. R. Allen’s management of the Globe Theatre was short-lived, ending early in 1871. There were a series of mechanics’ liens against the Globe property, with Col. J. H. Wood listed as proprietor in 1872. On January 25, 1872, the Chicago Tribune even referred to the venue was called Wood’s Globe Theatre, after Colonel Wood’s Museum Company at the Globe (p. 4).\n\nRogers, Tryon, and Dressel painted Alderson’s Great Panorama of the Chicago fire early in 1872 so it could tour that summer. They worked from primary sketches by Academy of Design instructor, Henry C. Cross.\n\nChicago before the fire. Link to image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire#/media/File:1871_Chicago_view_before_the_Great_Conflagration.jpg\n\nPhotographs by George N. Barnard after the conflagration. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire#/media/File:Attributed_to_George_N._Barnard_-_Untitled_(Chicago_after_the_Chicago_Fire)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nTheir work immediately toured the country, accompanied with musical performances and descriptive recitations. By late July the panorama was exhibited at Piatt’s Music Hall in San Francisco. Several advertisements for the panorama were placed in Figaro. This newsletter referred to itself as “the organ of amusement….circulates in….All the Theatres and is Circulated Every Day in the Year Generally Throughout the City and on the Boats and Cars.” Figaro stated that its newsletter was “published every Day in the Year by J. P. Bogardus at 22 Merchant and 535 Washington Streets, Below Montgomery, San Francisco.”\n\nAdvertisement for Alderson’s Panorama in Figaro, 1871.\n\nAnother advertisement for Alderson’s Panorama in Figaro, 1871.\n\nAlthough the digital scan of newsletter is quite poor, Figaro is a wealth of information about theatrical activities in San Francisco during the second half of 1872. Here is a link to those who may be interested: https://archive.org/stream/figarojulydec18700unse/figarojulydec18700unse_djvu.txt\n\nThe same advertisement was placed in Figaro announcements for several days. The article consistently reported,\n\n“Panorama of the Great Chicago Fire.\n\nAlderson’s Panorama of the Great Chicago Fire has arrived and will be exhibited in Piatt’s Hall on Friday evening next. This painting covers over thirty-seven hundred feet of canvas was executed from actuals views and drawings by Henry C. Cross of the Academy of Design; J. Howard Rogers, scenic artist of McVicker’s Theatre; Henry C. Tryon, scenic artist of Wood’s Museum; Henry Dreissel [sic.], scenic artist of the Globe Theatre, and Thomas Megann, scenic artist of Crosby’s Opera House. The mechanical appointments are by the celebrated John Faust of Dearborn Theater and Opera House, all famous artists in their line. The panorama represents Chicago before the fire, the city in flames, and afterwards the ruins. Other sections present views of the old cemetery, with its scenes of suffering representations of the public buildings, printing offices, and water works of prominent places. Succeeding these, are views of the ruins of the churches, the exhibition closing with the ruins of the Masonic Temple by moonlight. A lady of Chicago will deliver a descriptive lecture, interspersed with appropriate ballads, anecdotes, and incidents. This approaches the anniversary of this dreadful event which took place October 8th and 9th, recalls the horrifying scenes to memory, and these will be found faithfully depicted in the great panorama. The process of admission have been fixed at the low rates of 50 cents and 25 cents, and on Sunday afternoon a matinee will be given at half prices.” (Daily Figaro, San Francisco, 31 July 1872, page 1). Some of the advertisements included a listing of various scenes:\n\n“Chicago before the Fire; The Conflagration; Thousands of Houses in Flames; The Scenes of the Old Cemetery; The Ruins; Views of Principal Streets; Public Buildings, Printing Offices, etc.; Ruins of the Churches; Something About Mrs. O’Leary’s Cow; Music, Songs, Stories, Recitations; and Descriptive Lecture and Dramatic Ballad by a Lady of Chicago\n\nChicago” (Figaro 31 July 1872, p. 1).\n\nOne of many articles in Figaro describing the panorama in 1871.\n\nAlderson’s panorama was one of many panorama’s depicting the tragedy that toured in the country at the time. Frank D. Skiff formed, Skiff & Co., to create another panorama of the Chicago Fire. The work was credited as “the work of scenic artist Frank D. Skiff, the well-known scenic artist” (Chicago Tribune 17 Dec 1871, p. 7).\n\nDressel’s early scenic art career mimics that of many during the early 1870s. Aspiring artists secured work as decorative painters. This employment brought them into director contact with other decorative artists who worked as scenic artists at theaters. In most cases, scenic artists were paid a higher salary, but the work was more sporadic.\n\nPortrait of P. M. Almini\n\nOne example of an artist who bridged the decorative and scenic art worlds was Louis Malmsha. Malmsha not only worked for the decorative firm of Jevne & Almini (later known as P. M. Almini & Co.), but also worked at McVicker’s Theatre. Malmsha is the common thread between several scenic artists working in Chicago during the 1870s. For example, both Rogers and Tryon worked with Malmsha at McVicker’s in 1871. This is the year after Rogers and Tryon painted scenery for the Allen’s Globe Theater.\n\nAt this time, if a young artist showed promise, he was immediately brought into the theatrical fold. The demand for scenic art was greater than the supply of scenic artists.\n\nPortrait of Thomas G. Moses in 1886.\n\nThomas G. Moses is another example of a young man who worked as Malmsha’s assistant in 1873, both at Almini’s and McVicker’s in 1873. Both Moses and Tryon ended up as Sosman & Landis Scenic Studio employees by the early 1880s.\n\nWhen considering Dressel’s entry into the scenic art profession, his initial training was in Chicago before the Great Fire. The 1871 tragedy meant that many scenic artists left the city, as they were left without work. Many, such as Malmsha relocated to other metropolitan areas. There was a waiting period before new stages were constructed for popular entertainment. Others produced painted spectacles that toured, such as the Chicago Fire panoramas. Rogers, Tryon, and Dressel had worked together in the past, and therefore teamed up to paint Cross’ design.\n\nDressel was touring with the Tannehill Company at the beginning of 1872. He was listed as part of the company, as well at the scenic artist.\n\nI need to provide some context for Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Tannehill concerning the time when Dressel joined their troupe. In 1872, they sporadically performed on stages along the eastern seaboard. Their young daughter, Birdie, even joined them on some occasions. On June 13, 1872, The Valley Virginian of Staunton, Virginia, reported:\n\n“AMUSEMENTS. Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Tannehill, assisted by their infant daughter, “Birdie,” only five years old, will give one of their chaste, beautiful and intellectual PARLOR ENTERTAINMENTS, at the Town Hall, on Tuesday evening, June 18th. They are well and favourably known and remembered by our citizens, as the leading members of the ‘Old Reliable Company’ when here last Winter. Those who desire to witness a legitimate performance, will be more compensated by attending (p. 3).\n\nBirdie passed away in the spring of 1873.\n\nOn March 11, 1873, the “Deaths” section of the Staunton Spectator announced, “At 125, Simcoe Street, Toronto, Canada, on Monday, March 3rd, little Birdie, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Tannehill, aged 5 years and 6 months.\n\nFarewell parents, lay me gently\n\nIn my little narrow bed.\n\nThink of God who gave and took me;\n\nNow I slumber with the dead,\n\nF. S. M.” (p. 3).\n\nBirdie died from Typhoid Fever in Toronto.\n\nLess than a year later, tragedy struck again in Toronto. This is how I connected scenic artist Harry Dressel with the Tannehill company.\n\nAn announcement in The Hamilton Spectator on Feb. 8, 1874, announced:\n\n“FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!\n\nIn consequence of the Royal Lyceum, Toronto, burning down, the Company will play a short season at St. James Hall, commencing Monday, Feb 9. The Troupe consisted of the following first-class Artists:\n\nF. A. Tannehill, Manager, Chas. Webster, Wm. Fuller, Wm. Ford, Dick Fowler, Nellie Tannehill, Nellie Stanwood, Mrs. Bradshaw, H. B. Bell, Burton Adams, J. R. Masters, Dick Featherstone, Harry Booth, Harry Dressel, Virginia Buchanan.\n\nHarry Dressel was also listed as scenic artist, with W. Fordham as stage conductor.\n\nThe following pieces will be put on stage with new scenery, properties and machinery:\n\nTicket of Leave Man\n\nStreets of New York\n\nDora\n\nColleen Bawn\n\nPat’s Trouble\n\nUnder the Gaslight”\n\nOn January 31, 1874, The Hamilton Spectator reported, “The Theater was insured in different offices to the extent of about $12,000, and was owned by Mr. French, by whom it had lately been leased to Mr. Tannehill. This is the third time the building has been attacked by fire, and it has at last succumbed to its assailant. The origin of the fire has not been ascertained, but it is supposed that it commenced in the carpenter’s shop, which being stored with paint, wood, shavings and other flammable material, caused it to spread with such unaccountable rapidity” (p. 2).\n\nI remain unsure as to when Dressel joined the Tannehill company, or how long he toured with the group. I have yet to locate any other articles mentioning Dressel’s scenic prior to the summer of 1875. That year, Harry became the scenic artist for the Varieties Theater in New Orleans, Louisiana. There is no doubt that his association with the Tannehills would have improved his chances in the region. Mr. Tannehill had made quite a name for himself in southern theaters after the Civil War, especially Memphis. Initially, Dressel was hired to both paint and retouch scenery.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1875, The New Orleans Democrat reported, “Amusements. The Varieties Theater. – The amusement season at this favorite theater will be inaugurated to-morrow evening by the first appearance in this city of Grau and Chizzola’s admirable French Opera Bouffe Company in the late operatic novelty of Gorofle-Gizolla. The opera itself is spoken of a Lecocq’s greatest triumph, and the critics of the New York press have been lavish in their praises of its merit. During the summer the theater has been carefully renovated, and Mr. Harry Dressel, and eminent scenic artist, has been busily engaged for some time past in retouching old scenes and painting many entirely new ones, all of which are characterized by beauty of design and delicacy of touch, and color.” (p. 8).\n\nAfter his initial work at the Varieties Theatre, Dressel headed north and painted stock scenery for Steyer’s Opera House in Decorah, Iowa. On Dec. 9, 1875, the Chicago Weekly Post and Mail published, “Special Correspondence of THE POST and Mail. Decorah, Iowa, Dec. 3” (p. 3). The article continued:\n\n“Prominent among the improvements is the enlargement of the Steyer Opera House, with a general overhauling, such as reseating with chairs, enlarged gallery, costly and fine scenery (painted by Harry Dressel, formerly of your city), and with a capacity of about 1,100 persons. Rudolph’s Music Hall has also undergone a similar change. About ninety buildings have been erected, among them some fine business blocks and residences, at a cost of over $150,000. Amusements are thick, A panorama ‘busted’ here a few weeks ago, and the operators went back to their legitimate business, and Jo Steyer, of the Opera House, has a ‘show’ on his hands. Plunkett’s troupe played crowded houses for a week recently, presenting ‘Two Orphans.’ Decorah promises to be lively in the way of amusements this winter.”\n\n“Two Orphans” was a popular production in 1875. It was also featured at the Varieties Theatre in New Orleans that year, with Dressel painting the scenes. On Dec. 2, 1875, the New Orleans Bulletin reported, “Mr. Harry Dressel, the able scenic artist of the theater, has been for a long-time preparing scenes especially for this play” (p. 8). On Dec. 4, 1875, The New Orleans Bulletin further elaborated on the production and Dressel’s scenic contribution:\n\nElegant Scenery.\n\n“The Two Orphans” at the Varieties.\n\nNo matter what the intrinsic beauty of strength of a drama may be, it is in the power of the scenic artist of the theater to greatly make or mar the play as a popular production. No drama is so good that it can be entirely independent of scenic accessories, and upon the artist who creates the scene it devolves to fitly picture the playwright’s ideal of situation and locality. We were led to these reflections by the sight was of the elaborate and artistic scenery which seen Thursday evening at The Varieties Theater in the play of “Two Orphans.” We have rarely witnessed more exquisite productions of the artist’s pencil. The snow scene, in which the very excellent portion of the drama is produced, was one of the most charming and life-like it has even been our good fortune to see; the floor of the stage seemed covered with beautiful snow and had not lain upon it long enough to lose its soft appearance, and had just been there sufficient time to gain a silver shimmer, which made it exquisitely delicate and charmingly picturesque. The beautiful garden and the palace of Belair was almost like a fairy picture in its beauty, and yet not to fanciful to be real. The entire front of the magnificent palace beautifully illuminated; a large and elegant terrace, lighted by handsome chandeliers, and opening upon a lovely garden, presented and elegant scene rarely if ever equaled here on the stage. The picture of the noble’s mansion and the beggar’s hovel were alike truthful and appropriate. Aside from the intrinsic merit of the play, and it is full of admirable points, the scenery should be seen by every lover of the artistic and beautiful in our city; it affords a rare treat and should be seen by all. Harry Dressel, the artist of the theater, deserves the highest praise for his great success” (p. 1).\n\nHis scenic work for “Two Orphans” was still being heralded at the beginning of 1876. On Jan. 16, The New Orleans Bulletin reported, “Mr. Dressel, the scenic artist of the theater, wields a pencil in a way that commands the earnest applause of all judges of true artistic ability, and the scenes in the play, when first presented at this theater, evoked the warmest praise for their real intrinsic merit” (p. 1).\n\nDressel quickly made a name for himself in New Orleans, repeatedly appearing in local headlines. I am amazed at the amount of press Dressel received for his work, as there was ample work in New Orleans that year; enough to keep several scenic artists employed at multiple theaters, including Anthony Bagnette, Thomas Burke, Angelo Wiser, and William T. Porter.\n\nFortunately for Dressel, he immediately secured the scenic art position at the Varieties Theater. By December 1875, the venue was leased and managed by Mrs. Henrietta Chanfrau and C. W. Tayleure for a short season. Earlier that fall, Mrs. Chanfrau made news when she attended a performance at the Varieties Theatre with her husband. On Nov. 11, 1875, the New Orleans Republican reported, “Mr. Frank S. Chanfrau, the comedian, and his wife, Mrs. Henrietta Chanfrau, occupied a box at the Varieties Theatre last night. In a professional way, these artists differ as much as do ‘Kit Redding’ and ‘Christie Johnstone’ on the stage, and they seldom meet, and never set together during the theatrical season. In the summer they are ‘at home’ in their comfortable Long Branch residence, playing domestic life in a congenial manner, and appearing an honorable example to the members of the profession” (p. 4).\n\nOn Dec. 12, 1875, The New Orleans Bulletin announced Dressel’s scenic work for Chanfrau in “Parted, or the Trust Company Failure,” at The Varieties Theater. The article reported, “Mr. Dressel, the scenic artist of the theater, has been engaged for some time in preparing the scenery for this play, and judging from the admirable exhibition of his skill we have witnessed this season, we predict a rare treat for visitors of the theater” (p. 5).\n\nDressel continued to make news during at the Varieties Theatre for the rest of the season. On Jan. 4, 1876, the New Orleans Bulletin reviewed Geo. Fawcett Rowe in Halliday’s dramatization of Dickens’s ‘David Copperfield,’ which he named ‘Little Eml’y’.’ The article reported, “Mr. Dressel, the scenic artist, has added new laurels to his list by the elegant and effective scenery used in the play. The boat-house, the church scene, which is, by the way, and exact representation of the Canterbury Cathedral in England, and the storm scene were all perfect gems of the painter’s skill and reflect the utmost credit upon the artist whose pencil formed them” (p. 1).\n\nOf “Watts Phillip’s military and romantic drama ‘Col. Willoughby; or, Not Guilty,’ The New Orleans Bulletin announced, “The plot of the play is in itself very interesting and exciting, and with the truly magnificent setting given it last night, makes one of the most splendid stage attractions we have seen in this city for many a long day. The ship scene in the second act, and the third and fourth acts, were new artistic triumphs for Harry Dressel, scenic artist of the theatre” (25 Jan 1876, p. 5).\n\nDressel was also heralded for his work on other New Orleans projects that month. On January 9, 1876, The New Orleans Bulletin announced, “The equestrian statue of Jackson which adored the gallery of the Pickwick Club yesterday was executed by Mr. Harry Dressel, the talented scenic artist of the Varieties Theatre, and was completed in an almost incredibly short space of time”) p. 1).\n\nOn Jan. 27, 1876, The Times-Picayune described the Washington Artillery Grand Ball at St. Patrick’s Hall: “But the most conspicuous object in the hall, and one upon which the gaze dwelt the longest, was a large sized painting that extended across the wall above the stage. The cartoon was done by Dressel, the scenic artist of the Varieties Theatre, represented a scene in the Shenandoah Valley. In the far distance appeared the huge masses of the Blue Ridge, with its irregular profiled outlined against the sky and white masses of snow merging into the azure coloring of the mountain tops. The silvery course of the Rappahannock might be traced across the broad expanse of rolling green sward, until the glitter of the stream was lost on the obscurity of the forest that stretched along the foot of the mountain range. In the foreground appeared two small field pieces, and close by on the ground a pile of cannon balls, a drum, and a group of muskets. The general effect of then painting was excellent and attracted much attention” (p. 1).\n\nOf Dressel’s painting for John T. Raymond, The New Orleans Bulletin reported, “Mr. Harry Dressel, the talented scenic artist of this theater, has, won additional honors for himself during Mr. Raymond’s engagement – the realistic effect of his steamboat explosion, and his beautiful landscape painting has evoked the warmest praise” (Feb. 6, 1876, p. 8).\n\nLess than two weeks later The New Orleans Bulletin commended Dressel’s work on “Christie Johnstone” at the Varieties Theater: “The scenic effects are very fine, especially the lifeboat rescue, which is a perfect marvel in its way, and is another triumph for Mr. Harry Dressel.” (Feb. 18, 1876, p. 8).\n\nOn March 8, 1876, The New Orleans Bulletin heralded Dressel for scenery in Chanfrau’s production of “Kit” – “Mr. Harry Dressel has done all he possibly could to render the play attractive and has really produced some scenic effects worthy of applause always tendered by the audience. The steamboat and the cabin are beautifully painted” (p. 5).\n\nDressel worked in New Orleans until the end of the season, then followed the Chanfrau Company to New York for the summer. On April 30, 1876, the New Orleans Republican announced, “Mr. Harry Dressel, scenic artist of the Varieties Theatre, leaves immediately for Chicago, and will be employed at the Eagle Theatre, New York, for the summer season” (p. 4). He left the city on May 4, heading up the river to Evansville, Indiana. On. May 9, 1876, The Evansville Journal announced, The Charles Morgan arrived at 1 am with a big trip of freight and a crowd of people” that included “Harry Dressel and A. Riet, scenic artists” (p. 7). I was fascinated to read, “The Morgan was five days and eight hours out from New Orleans, including all delays.” In Evansville, the ship “discharged 65 barrels molasses, 35 barrels sweet potatoes, 15 barrels rice, 10 of pineapples, 4 cases bananas, 10 sacks coffee, and other freight.” From Evansville, Dressel headed west to Chicago. He was heading home to visit family before starting a position in New York.\n\nOn May 7, 1876, The Brooklyn Sunday Sun announced, “Mr. Clifton W. Tayleure, manager of the Varieties Theatre, New Orleans, has entered into a contract with Mr. Josh Hart, of the Eagle Theatre, for occupancy by the Chanfrau Company of the latter place of amusement after June 5…This company will probably occupy the Eagle Theatre until the fall season opens when Hart again assumes the management with a strong comedy troupe” (p. 5). Located at Broadway and 33rd Street, Josh Hart was the sole proprietor. While examining a few activities at the Eagle Theatre in 1876, I was surprised to discover sheet music for “Emancipation Day,” dedicated to Mr. Josh Hart. The cover noted, “sung with immense success at the Eagle Theatre, New York.”\n\nBraham, David, “Emancipation day: song and chorus ” (1876). Representations of Blackness in Music of the United States (1830-1920). Brown Digital Repository. Brown University Library. Here is the link: https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:17080/\n\nBefore Dressel joined the Chanfrau company in New York, he visited family in Chicago. It was early May in 1876. I wonder what brought Dressel home. It may have been his father’s declining health, as of May 1876, Louis Dressel made out his will.\n\nWhen Dressel returned to New Orleans that fall, he resumed a position as scenic artist at The Varieties Theatre. On Nov. 11, 1876, Dressel was credited with the scenery for “Our Boys” under the management of Charles Pope.\n\nAlthough Dressel was listed as scenic artist for the Varieties Theatre in the 1876 and 1877, New Orleans Directory, he also continued to complete a variety of projects that included fresco work. On Aug. 5, 1877, The Times-Picayune reported, “The ceiling of the office has been very prettily frescoed by Dressel, the scenic artist of the Varieties, and there are panels adorned with appropriate figures typifying industry and commerce. The steamboat Natchez has also a place among the figures on the ceiling. The walls are frescoed in scroll and figure work” (p. 1).\n\nIn 1877, Dressel was naturalized as a US Citizen.\n\nThe most interesting article that I discovered described Dressel’s work as a lighting artist. During the late 19th century, many scenic artists performed on stage. They would rapidly sketch characters or paint scenes as a variety act. At the Academy of Music in New Orleans, Dressel rapidly painted a tropical landscape for the benefit for Mr. William Morris, machinist of the theatre. On June 1, 1878, The Times-Picayune reported, “Harry Dressel, the scenic artist, who painted in sight of the audience, in less than eight minutes, a complete tropical landscape, commenting on a plain white canvas, six by eight feet. The subject was suggested by the audience, and the composition was the study of the moment. Time was called and the artist run a horizon line, spread on a warm sky, placed a mountain range, run a stretch of water, drew date and palm trees with spreading leaves, dropped a few bright flowers for perspective effect, and left a very pleasing picture for the admiration of an audience that was enthusiastic over such an exhibition of artistic skill and rapid execution” (p. 8). I have written about other lighting artists in the past and find their popular performances intriguing.\n\nDespite accepting a variety of projects, in 1878, Dressel was still associated with the Chanfrau Company, even mentioned in their newspaper advertisements. On April 4, 1878, the Chattanooga Daily Times included an ad for the production of “KIT, The Arkansas Traveler.”\n\nThe article reported, “Their great work was witnessed by upwards of 400,000 personsat Booth’s Theater, New York, and has realized Mr. Chanfrau over $65,000… ENTIRELY NEWSCENERY by Harry Dressel, the famous Scenic Artist of New Orleans, especially painted for this production.”\n\nDressel delivered scenery for KIT in 1878.\n\nOn October 6, 1878, the Chicago Daily Tribune published an advertisement for “Dominick Murray, in his exciting and very successful drama, entitled ESCAPED FROM SING SING; or, Criminal Life in New York” at Hamlin’s Theatre, 87 Clark-st., opposite Court House” (p. 1). The ad announced, “The Drama will be produced with entirely new Scenery by MINARD LEWIS, Esq., and HARRY DRESSEL, Esq.”\n\nThis brings Dressel back to the home of his family in 1878.\n\nBy 1880, Dressel partnered with John Charles Evans in St. Louis to form Dressel & Evans, scenic artists. Their firm was listed in the New Orleans Directory for 1881 and 1882. Evans partnership with Dressel ended by 1883. Evans, however, continued to work as an artist in New Orleans, and was listed in the next three City directories. Although his address remained the same, his name shifted from Charles to John, and back again. Evans became another employee as the Chicago-based firm of Sosman & Landis employee. Here is the link to Evans’ biography https://drypigment.net/2023/04/08/sosman-landis-shaping-the-landscape-of-american-theatre-employee-no-103-j-c-evans/\n\nJ. C. Evans was a scenic artist who went on to work for Sosman & Landis in Chicago.\n\nOn May 10, 1883, The Times-Democrat published an article entitle “OUR SUMMER OPERA – Arrival Yesterday of Miss Alice Oates and Her Company for Spanish Fort” (p. 3). Their arrival was “over the Louisville and Nashville road” with a 25-person opera company. Originally coming from NY. “Mr. Harry S. Dressel, so well known here as a scenic artist and in connection with our theatres, has made the architectural designs and will superintend the decorations, scenery, etc. His past successes insure excellent work.”\n\nOn May 14, 1883, The Times-Democrat of New Orleans, reported about the Spanish Fort: “The gangs of workmen were engaged all day on the theatre over the water, just in front of the reck grotto, and the work will be continued night and day until completed. Already the joist for the floor have been laid, and as the rest of the frame-work has already been prepared to be put together, by the 20th the building will be completed, in time for the opening by the Alice Oate’s Opera Troupe. Piles are being driven for the foundation of that portion of the building to be occupied by the stage, which work will be finished by Tuesday. Harry Dressel is not losing a moment, and yesterday was hard at it, up on a scaffold, working on the new drop curtain. It will. Represent a scene in the days of Louis Quatorze. In the centre is a colonnade and portico of a palace, not unlike the Trianon, and before it a number of court ladies and gallants are engaged in the then favorite game of battledore and shuttlecock. The poses are graceful and the picture animated. Rich foliage gives a pleasant contrast to the white marble columns and adds a softness to the scene. Mr. Dressel is sparing no pains on this artistic study (p. 3).\n\nHarry Dressel made news across the country. On Nov. 30, 1889, the Telegraphic News section of the Indianapolis Journal reported, “Harry Dressel, the well-known scenic artist, was dangerously stabbed at New Orleans, yesterday, by Ferdinand Amant” (p. 1). Dressel was now 38 yrs. old and wanted money for a project he completed.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 1889, the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette reported, “Harry Dressel, the well-known scenic artist of the New Orleans French Opera-house, was severely stabbed one day last week by a lawyer named Armant in a saloon adjoining the theater. The trouble grew out of an unpaid bill for work done by Dressel during the time of the Cotton Palace” (p. 8).\n\nOn Dec. 4, 1889, The Louisiana Review described the altercation about the unpaid bill:\n\n“A difficulty occurred between Harry Dressel, scenic artist of the French Opera House, and Fernaud Armant, last Friday afternoon, in a barroom on Toulouse Street, over an unpaid bill for painting a stage curtain of the Cotton Place. Blows were exchanged and Dressel was cut on the face and neck by Armant. The wounds are not considered dangerous. Armant surrendered to Captain Journee, but was released under a $1000 bond” (p. 5).\n\nDressel briefly left Louisiana and headed to Texas. He picked up a variety of projects, including the design and decorations of floats for German Day. On Oct. 7, 1891, the Galveston Daily News announced, “By 6 am Mr. Harry Dressel, the artist in charge of the decorated floats was busy with a corps of hearty fellow, getting the heavy floats out of the warehouse sheds into the street” (p. 8).\n\nBy 1900 Dressel returned to New Orleans.\n\nOn Aug 24, 1900, The Canton Times of Canton, Miss. Reported, “The Manning-Yale Co., the biggest and most complete vaudeville aggregation touring the South will open at the Opera House Wednesday, September 12th…the company is composed of twenty vaudevillers who have made reputations and sustained them. A uniformed concert band and complete orchestra is included. Special scenery painted by the renowned scenic artist Dressel, is used. No expense has been spared to make this production one of the grandest in every detail and disappointment has yet to be evidenced by any audience” (p. 4).\n\nOn May 30, 1905, The Times-Democrat published Dressel’s obituary:\n\n“Harry H. Dressel, a well-known scenic artist, dies at his home, 4318 Canal Street, yesterday afternoon, after an illness of several weeks. His death was a shock to his many friends and acquaintances in this city, for he had been actively engaged in his work up to a short time before his death. Mr. Dressel was born in Hanover, Germany, fifty-three years ago, in which place he received his early education in college as well as in art. He came to this country when a young man and engaged in scene painting. Thirty-one years ago, he came to New Orleans and had lived here since that time. Mr. Dressel became connected with the French Opera House, and for a time worked exclusively. For that playhouse, turning out many hundreds of pieces of work. His studio was in the building, and within those walls he acquired fame. Mr. Dressel did work for the Grand Opera House and also for the St. Charles Theatre. Mr. Dressel started Lake View Park and fixed up a studio at West End. He did much work on the park, and at the same time worked on Carnival ball settings. His work for the Atlanteans was always complimented. The work for the Atlanteans of this year was the last he did. Mr. Dressel was at one time a member of the Southern Yacht Club. He was a vice president of the Ozone Spring Water Company and was a Knight of America belonging to Crescent Lodge No. 110. Mr. Dressel is survived by his wife. The interment will take place to-morrow at the Greenwood Cemetery” (p. 10).\n\nHis will was published in The Times-Democrat on 2 Jun 1905, noting, “the will admitted to probate makes a number of bequests: $500 to Harry Groh; $200 to William O. Conne; $100 to Mrs. William Groh; $25 to Lizzie Brown – the remaining property given to Miss Annie L. Hall with $200 for the purpose of keeping the grave of the deceased. David Lemly appointed executor” (p. 10).\n\nTo be continued…\n\nCopyright © 2024 by Wendy Waszut-Barrett\n\nThis post could be titled “Sosman & Landis: Shaping the Landscape of American Theatre. Employee No. 114 – Arthur R. Hurtt.” Yes, I have identified more Sosman & Landis employees this month.\n\nThere is always a particular drop that catches my eye when examining an historic scenery collection. It might be the design, or maybe a manufacturer stamp; something that makes another piece of the puzzle fall into place.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 10, 2024, I examined a street scene at the Theatre Museum of Repertoire Americana in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. It was the end of the very long day, but my heart leapt when I read the signature – “A. R. Hurtt.”\n\nStreet Scene by Arthur Hurtt on display at the Theatre Museum of Repertoire Americana.\n\nSignature on Street Scene by Arthur Hurtt.\n\nPainted detail in Street Scene by Arthur Hurtt.\n\nI first became aware of Arthur R. Hurtt while working on an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) Grant at the University of Minnesota Libraries Performing Arts Archives. I was processing the Great Western Stage Equipment Co. collection (GWSE Co.), the second of two scenery design collections negotiated by Professor Emeritus C. Lance Brockman, University of Minnesota Theatre Department (Twin Cities). The GWSE Co. materials were purchased for the University Performing Arts Library through the collaborative efforts of the University Library, the Department of Theatre Arts and University Theatre alum, Tom Scott.\n\nI spent the better part of a year (1989-1990) cleaning and cataloguing the collection under the supervision of Barb Bezat in a run-down industrial building near the Prospect Park neighborhood. It was a far cry from the modern facility (Elmer L. Anderson Building) that is now located on the U of MN West Bank. It was Barb who taught me how to clean, repair, and catalogue incoming acquisitions; many techniques that I have carried over to scenery restoration.\n\nBarb Bezat in the stacks at the old archive building. Photograph courtesy of Bezat.\n\nIn my spare time, I replicated several designs, then enlarged painted details in distemper paint in the scene shop. As I was learning necessary scenic art skills, I was also practicing with distemper paint (dry pigment paste and hide glue).\n\n10″ x 10″ replica by Wendy Waszut, 1989.\n\nAfter copying the design at the archives, I would take my replica back to the scene shop where I would paint a 5’-0”x5’-0” full-scale detail using distemper paint (dry pigment paste and diluted hide glue). In the end my small flats were displayed at various UROP events. I presented the results of the UROP project, “The Categorization and Indexing of the Great Western Stage Equipment Co. Collection” both on campus and at a UROP conference in Schenectady, NY.\n\nPhotograph with my 5′ x 5′ distemper painting. Published in a CLA Newsletter, 1990.\n\nI received a second UROP grant to process another Brockman acquisition – The Holak Collection (Sosman & Landis and New York Studios). There is nothing quite processing an incoming collection composed of theatrical designs and supplementary materials. You become entrenched in not only the visuals, but also business logistics and marketing tactics.\n\nSome of my happiest hours were spent exploring the contents of a neighboring collection in the stacks – the Twin City Scenic Co. Collection. Much larger in scope, it had not only been processed in the mid-1980s, but had also been featured in an exhibition. Scenic designs and supplemental materials were exhibited from April 5 to June 14, 1987, in the Third Floor Gallery of the University Art Museum, Northrup Auditorium. I never had the pleasure of seeing the exhibit, as I didn’t start my college career until that fall.\n\nIt was while exploring the contents of the Twin City Scenic Collection in 1989 that I first encountered a design by Arthur R. Hurtt.\n\nHurtt, Arthur R.. Sketch of European street with a bridge and city gate.. University of Minnesota Libraries, Performing Arts Archives., umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll116:87 Accessed 29 Jan 2024.\n\nHe was a one-time employee of the Twin City Scenic Studio, c. 1900-1909. I again examined the sketch as a doctoral student in 1999. At the time, I was assisting in the design of a searchable database for the Performing Arts Archives scenery collections. One of my many tasks was to assign metadata for each digitized image in the Twin City Scenic Co. Collection, Great Western Stage Equipment Co. Collection, and the Holak Collection.\n\nScreenshot of information that used to be included in the database before it shifted servers.\n\nOne of my responsibilities was to select five keywords to best identify the artwork. I also created a list of identifiers, while determining creators. It was a challenge to match paintings based in color combinations, paint application, and brush stroke. I was constantly comparing rough drafts, pencil sketches, and color renderings. This meant that I eventually memorized the contents of three collections.\n\nBest. Training. Ever.\n\nMy continued handling of the three collections helped shape my understanding of scenic illusion for the stage. It also provided me with a visual reference when examining extant examples of full-scale scenery at historic opera houses.\n\nWhen I encountered Hurtt’s signature on a street scene at the Theatre Museum of Repertoire Americana, it was like greeting an old friend. It also meant that I immediately knew the significance of the piece.\n\nI know of no other extant scenic artworks by Hurtt. This drop may be one of the most important artifacts at the museum. Hurtt’s scenic art legacy spanned over sixty years, linking him to major scenic studios in Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, New York, and Los Angeles. In 1901, he was even chosen as the representative of the American Association of Scenic Artists in the international association, visiting Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Norway in the interests of American scenic art. Although I have gradually added information to my Hurtt file over the years, this project provided me with an opportunity to do a deep dive into his life and career.\n\nHis biography is often included in publications that list regional artists, citing that he studied at the Art Students League of New York with Douglas Volks and Irving R. Wiles, and in France with Alex Fournier. Mentions of his early life and scenic art career are vague or non-existent. I am going to try and fill in a few gaps, illustrating the theatrical contributions and remarkable individual who was born in a small Wisconsin Village six months after the onset of the Civil War.\n\nArthur Russell Hurtt, 1901.\n\nArthur Russell Hurtt was born on Oct. 31, 1861, in the village of Trimbelle, Pierce County, Wisconsin. For geographical context, the township of Trimbelle is situated along the Trimbelle River in western Wisconsin. It was a newly settled area when the Hurtt family moved north from Illinois.\n\nA map showing the location of Trimbelle, Wisconsin.\n\nTrimbelle’s post office was established in 1855, with postmaster Aaron Cornelison bringing the mail from Prescott once a week. Early buildings included a church, school, and grist mill. As settlers arrived at the area, a variety of other businesses appeared, including sawmills, blacksmith shops, and a furniture store. In fact, ten other townships were organized in Pierce County by 1860. They included Martell, Isabella, Diamond Bluff, Clifton, Oak Grove, Perry, Pleasant Valley, Hartland, Trenton, El Paso, and River Falls.\n\nThe story of Hurtt’s parents is quite complex and took quite a while to track down. Arthur was the third child born to William G. Hurtt (1826-1894) and Sarah Marcy Smith (1828-1897). That being said, he was the fourth child born to his mother. Sarah was the youngest daughter of a Revolutionary veteran. On Dec. 8, 1897, The Berkshire County Eagle reported, “Mrs. Sarah M. Smith Hurtt, whose death was mentioned in the County Eagle of November 24, as having occurred in St. Paul, Minnesota, justly claimed to belong to the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her father was the late Russell Smith of Stockbridge who enlisted in the Revolutionary War at the age of 18. He married his second wife here in Stockbridge after he was 60 years old and his only child, Sara M. Smith (Hurtt) was born when her father was 64 years of age. Mr. Smith. Who (by the way was a great uncle of your Stockbridge Correspondent) was one of the revolutionary heroes, who fought for American freedom” (p. 14).\n\nShe was quite a lady. In 1896 Mrs. Sarah M. Hurtt was featured in The Minneapolis Journal on April 25, 1896. Under the heading “In a Woman’s World,” the article reported, “This sketch is by her son, Arthur Hurtt, the well known scenic painter, from a bust by Jacob Fjelde, the sculptor. Mrs. Hurtt is the daughter of revolutionary hero, Russell Smith, who at the age of 18 was drafted, in 1780, and fought in the American Revolution. He had three brothers who fought in the same was. His daughter was born when Russell Smith was 64 years old, and she was 14 when he died. She remembers well his stories of experiences in the Revolution” (p. 5).\n\nBust of Arthur Hurtt’s mother by Jacob Fjelde, published in The Minneapolis Journal, 1896.\n\nThe sculptor was Norwegian-born American Jacob Henrik Gerhard Fjelde (1859-1896); well known as a portraitist and creator of public sculptures. Here is a link for more information about Fjelde: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Fjelde\n\nPortrait of Jacob Fjelde. Here is the image link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jacob_Fjelde#/media/File:Jakob_Henrik_Gerhard_Fjelde_(1859%E2%80%931896).png\n\nHurtt’s mother’s story and portrait were again published the following year when she passed; this time in the Minneapolis Daily Times on Nov. 24, 1897 (p. 4).\n\nSarah M. Hurt portrait, published in the Minneapolis Daily Times, 1897.\n\nThis interesting tidbit was again publicly made known when Hurtt was working as a scenic artist in Los Angeles, California. On March 9, 1907, The Los Angeles Times reported, “Mr. Hurtt is said to be the youngest person whose grandfather was in the War of Revolution. His mother was Sarah M. Hurtt, a daughter of a Revolutionary soldier. Her father, Russell Smith, enlisted in 1780 at the age of 18. He was 64 years old when his daughter Sarah was born” (p. 24).\n\nI am going to start out with Sarah M. Smith, as she was the hardest to track down in public records. Sarah was the daughter of Russell and Cynthia Smith, she married her first husband, Royal B. Whitney (1823-1856), at the age of 21 yrs. old on Aug. 24, 1849, in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. This was her 26-yrs. old husband’s second marriage.\n\nThe 1850 census lists the newly-married couple living with Royal’s family in Buxton (York County), Maine. Royal was one of several adult children living on the Whitney farmstead that year. Oddly, Royal and Sarah Whitney were also counted at another Buxton household when the 1850 census was taken, with Royal listed as an engineer. In 1853, Sarah and Royal’s only child, Mary Abbey Cynthia Whitney, was born.\n\nThis is where it gets a little confusing.\n\nSarah gave birth to William Hurtt’s first child, Isabelle Hurtt, in 1855. Hurtt was her second husband. Then the couple celebrated the birth of a son, William Hurtt Jr. in 1856. Both children were born in Illinois while her first husband, Royal Whitney, was still alive and legally married to Sarah. He did not pass away until 1856, and Sarah did not marry Hurtt until 1860. Arthur Hurtt was born in 1861, the first legitimate child of Sarah and William Hurtt.\n\nBy 1860, Sarah’s second husband was caring for her three children in Trimbelle, Wisconsin. She is conspicuously absent from the Hurtt household in the 1860 US Federal Census Report. William Hurtt’s household included: William (35 yrs.) and his children: Mary (18 yrs., step-daughter), Isabelle (6yrs., daughter) and William Jr. (4 yrs., son). His wife was also living in Trimbelle and working as a schoolteacher. However, she was living with Alexander and Hannah Hathaway, and an 8-yrs. old girl named Sarah Whitney, who listed Wisconsin as her birthplace.\n\nThe Hurtt’s were still living in Wisconsin at the onset of the Civil War. William Hurtt enlisted in the Union Army at Prescott, Wisconsin, listing the town as his residence. Private William G. Hurtt served with Company A, 12th Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, from Dec. 16, 1863, to July 16, 1865.\n\nI am uncertain as to when the Hurtt family moved twelve miles west to Prescott, but they were still living there in 1870. A much larger community than Trimbelle, Prescott is located at the convergence of the St. Croix and Mississippi Rivers and offered many more employment opportunities. It was a center for river transportation, shipping, and milling. There was an ample supply of wood, as harvested pines were rafted down the St. Croix River. When the 1870 census was taken, William Hurtt was employed as a cooper. Keep in mind that those skilled a barrel-making were an essential part of agricultural activities, especially in the Midwest.\n\nThe Hurtt family lived in Prescott for much of the 1870s before venturing up the Mississippi to St. Paul, Minnesota. Both William and Arthur Hurtt were listed in the 1878 St. Paul Directory. The family lived at 136 E. Fourteenth, with William continuing his trade as a copper and Arthur working as a painter. In later years, Hurtt recalled that he began his “study of art” in 1878.\n\nThe family remained at the same address the next year, with Arthur continuing work as a painter. In 1879, he listed his employer as Ingham & Corlies. This firm manufactured sash, door, and blinds. Painters were employed to paint scenes on decorative blinds for both commercial and residential windows. Edward Ingham’s and William Corlies’ storefront was located at Eighth and Jackson. Arthur likely worked at their factory location; the northwest corner of Sixth and Cedar. Other employed at Ingham & Corlies in 1879 included glaziers, machinists, woodturners, and carpenters. In fact, there were over 200 individuals who listed themselves as painters in the St. Paul Directory that year, working for a variety of firms that included factories for machinery such as St. Paul Harvester Works, St. Paul Plow Works, St. Paul Foundry & Manufacturing Co., and the St. P & D. Railroad. Beck & Rank, E. F. Kramer & Son, Judson & Brack, and J. A. Brazille & Bro. were decorating firms that also employed a significant amount of painters in St. Paul, advertising fresco, home, and sign painting. Hopefully, this provides context for employment opportunities when the Hurtt family moved from Prescott, Wisconsin, to St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHurtt transitioned from painting blinds to painting stage scenery in 1879. In later years, Hurtt listed that his first notable scene painting project was for C. R. Foreman’s “Cuban Spy.” In 1879, Kansas City newspapers announced the engagement of Foreman at Clark’s Coliseum Theatre in his “new and sensational drama…with new scenery, properties, etc.” (The Kansas City Times 30 Dec 1879, p. 8).\n\nArthur Hurtt painted scenery for Rial’s The Cuban Spy In 1879.\n\nIn 1879, William Hurtt was not listed in the St. Paul directory. Only Arthur and his mother, Mrs. Sarah Hurtt, were listed as living at 136 Fourteenth.\n\nIt is possible that William Hurtt’s injuries sustained during the Civil War forced the Hurtt family to move up stream and closer to a veterans’ facilities in St. Paul. On June 12, 1880, the William G. Hurt applied for a Civil War pension as an invalid. From this point on, he was not included in any City Directory. The 1880 census confirmed that William G. Hurtt was no longer part of the Hurtt household, as that year, the US Federal Census recorded that only Sarah Hurtt was living with three daughters: Mary A. C., Sarah E, and Martha “Mattie.” Arthur was likely on the road – painting. The 1890 Veterans Schedule listed William G. Hurtt at the Minnehaha Soldiers Home in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe 1880 St. Paul directory listed both Arthur and his mother living at 59 Cooper. Arthur was now listed as a scene painter, signaling the official beginning of his theatrical career. Hurtt soon working as the scenic artist for Wood’s Opera House in St. Paul and living at 202 13th street.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 1882, Hurt married Hansine “Winifred” Cammon (1864-1943) in St. Paul, Minnesota. Born in Henjum, Leikanger, Sogn of Fjordance, Norway, she was the daughter of Ole Ferdinand Cammen (1833-1896) and Bergitte Schanke (1832-1919). She emigrated with her parents as a toddler in 1866. By 1880, Winifred was listed as a domestic servant at the Kennedy boarding house at 183 Exchange Street in St. Paul. I have yet to locate any information regarding how to two met.\n\nIn later years, Hurtt stated that he worked on J. Rial’s production “Taken Fron Life” in 1882. Hurtt painted scenery for “Taken From Life” at the People’s Theatre that year. In both 1880 and 1881, Rial’s toured the Academy of Music in Minneapolis, offering an opportunity for Rial to encounter Hurtt (The Saint Paul Globe 7 Nov 1880, p. 8).\n\nIn 1883, Hurtt relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, resigning his position at Col. Wood’s Theatre. On April 1, 1883, The Saint Paul Globe reported, “Arthur Hurtt has resigned his position as scenic artist at Wood’s Opera House and will soon leave for St. Louis” (p. 5). As with many scenic artists at the time, Hurtt maintained a residence in more than one city. He painted an “H.M.S. Pinafore” set for the Chicago Ideal Opera Co. Extended stays in any one location for a scenic artist meant that new job offers had to reach them throughout the year. They trailed work from one region to the next, securing a series of rooms. For example, Hurtt was listed as an artist in the 1884 St. Paul Directory, rooming at 239 Norris. The mid-1880s found Hurtt bouncing back and forth between Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Rail travel between this metropolitan areas was extremely accessible at the time.\n\nHurtt’s services were secured for both the building and renovation of numerous opera houses throughout the 1880s. He was listed at scenic artist at St. Paul’s Olympic Theatre in Harry Miner’s Dramatic Directory for the season of 1884-1885.\n\nHis affiliation with St. Paul’s Grand Opera House started in 1883. That summer, he presented a painting to Harry G. Carter, who had charge of building the interior of the Grand Opera House. On Aug. 26, 1883, The Saint Paul Globe reported, “a picture presented by Arthur R. Hurtt scenic artist to Mr. Carter, representing Carter’s process of turning out Opera Houses rapidly, which was very appropriate to the occasion, as he is certainly doing some rapid and excellent work on the new Opera house” (p 5). Smart move, as Hurtt later worked as a draughtsman for H. G. Carter in the 1886, even listing Carter as his employer in the St. Paul Directory\n\nThe Grand Opera House opened on Oct. 15, 1883, with Hurtt acting as the venue’s primary scenic artist. The Opera House was located on the east side of Wabasha between Third and, with other places of amusement including Conley’s Varieties Theatre, Knauf’s Hall, Pfeifer’s Hall, Music Hall and Athenæum. A notable project for Hurtt in 1884 was “Siberia.” In 1884, Hurtt painted a new drop curtain for Boyd’s Opera House in Omaha. Nebraska. On Sept. 13, 1884. The North Loop Herald announced, “A new drop curtain, costing $1,000 has been put up in Boyd’s Opera House at Omaha” (p. 3).\n\nHurtt was still listed in the 1885 St. Paul Directory as “scenic artist Grand Opera House, res 513 Robert.”\n\nThe Grand Opera House, St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 1885, The St. Paul Globe reported, “Mr. Arthur Hurtt, scenic artist at the Grand Opera House, is at work on a handsome tent drop, cottage flats and a couple of interiors, and a landscape scene just finished. Mr. Hurtt has only been connected with the Grand for a short period, but he has more than demonstrated his capacity for fine and artistic work. He is also engaged in revamping several sets of the eye-sore scenery which he found in use on his arrival, and which has been the subject of adverse criticism. The old scenery will be painted out as fast as possible, and before long it will be replaced with a stock of good modern sets. Mr. Hurtt is a gifted artist, and he deserves to be liberally encouraged, his treatment of foliage and figures being particularly fine.” On Feb. 22, 1885, The Saint Paul Globe reported, “Mr. Arthur Hurtt, the scenic artist at the Grand Opera House, is a very retiring and modest young artist. He makes his brush do the talking, Mr. Hurtt is a great worker, and works very rapidly. He is engaged on the flats and settings for the opera house to be produced next week. Two of the scenes are finished, one a garden scene and the other a landscape, both good in color and perspective. Mr. Hurtt is a close student of nature, his foliage being most natural – something not at all easy in scene painting. By the way, the new drop curtain, which was put in place in the West St. Paul theater, is also by. This artist; it is a striking and very attractive piece of work” (p. 2).\n\nIn March, Hurtt was heralded for his work on the production “A Social Wreck” that month too. On Mar 8, 1885, The St. Paul Globe “A Social Wreck” – “Special scenery is being painted by Mr. Hurtt, scenic artist of the Grand Opera, for the production of the Opera” (p. 8).\n\nBy the end of summer, Hurtt again relocated to another city; his move making news in St. Louis. On August 15, 1885, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (p. 12): “Arthur R. Hurtt, the distinguished young artist who formerly lived in this city and who has made such a splendid hit in St. Paul, has temporarily located to Kansas City. Arthur is a young man who won a name through untiring energy and hard labor” (p. 12). In Kansas City, Hurtt secured accommodation at Independence Square. Hurtt was an immediate success. On August 29, 1885, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, “Arthur R Hurtt is astonishing the natives of Kansas City with the productions of his brush” (p. 11). In 1885, Hurtt delivered scenery to The Academy of Music in Omaha, Tootles Opera House in St. Joseph, Missouri, and the Bijou Grand Opera House in Milwaukee. I believe that Hurtt was sporadically working for Sosman & Landis Scenic Studio at this time. The firm had regional branches, including Kansas City, that hired well-known scenic artists for short engagements when their workload substantially increased.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in 1886 Hurtt returned to St. Paul where he worked as a draughtsman for Harry G. Carter. This is not meant to say that he stopped painting scenery for the year, he just accepted enough work to warrant the association in the St. Paul Directory. His work with Carter did not last for long, and soon Hurtt was back as a scenic artist, even on the road, working as a scenic artist throughout the region. In 1887, Hurtt became associated with a Chicago-based firm, likely Sosman & Landis. He returned to Minnesota shortly before the opening of On April 30, 1887, the Leader-Telegram announced, “Arthur Hurtt and Charles Clark, scenic artists, are now engaged in completing scenery for the new Eau Claire theatre, 211 Barstow street. Messrs. Fred Burnard and Hays yesterday purchased the fixtures, lease, etc., of the Sherman House” (p. 3). In addition to drop curtains and stock scenery collection, Hurtt also worked listed the following shows for notable work in 1887: “The Danites,” “Two Orphans,” “The Gallery Slave,” and “The Silver King.”\n\nIn 1888, Hurtt became associated with the People’s Theatre. On February 19, 1888, his name was mentioned alongside several other well-known scenic artists in an article entitled “Stage and Scenery,” published in The Saint Paul Globe (p. 10). The article reported, “Arthur B. Hurtt at the People’s Theatre, this city, is comparatively a young artist, having been painting scenery less than ten years, and a St. Louis paper is authority for his being one of the best young artists in the country. Mr. Hurtt is very retiring and modest young artist, a great worker and works rapidly He studies hard, is a close student of nature and has the true spirit of an artist, He has made a life study of trees and landscapes, his foliage being most natural, which is not at all easy to accomplish in scene painting. Being a good colorist, and draughtsman as well, his work is not often surpassed. Mr. Hurtt came here from Chicago a short time before the opening of the People’s theater and has painted all the scenery used there except the drop curtain, which was let to a Chicago scenic firm owing to the rush of the opening.” The Chicago firm mentioned in the article was Sosman & Landis.\n\nHurtt remained at the People’s Theatre for all of 1888, repeatedly making news for his scenic accomplishments. Notable projects in 1888 included “The Black Flag,” “The Octoroon,” “Hazel Kirke,” “A Celebrated Case,” “Leah, the Foresaken,” “Lost in London,” “The Mikado.” Hurtt was also credited with scenery for Theodore Hamilton’s “Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde,” “Sea of Ice,” and “Forty Theives.”\n\nOf particular note was his work on “The Forty Thieves. On Dec 22, 1888, The Irish Standard reported, “Arthur Hurtt, the scenic artist of the house, returned a few weeks ago from a two-week’s visit to New York in search of designs and materials for the elaborate stage setting which will be a conspicuous feature of the production. He has, since his return, been at work on the scenes, aided by a large staff of assistants, and some strikingly beautiful tableaux’s have been prepared.” (p. 5). Other productions at People’s Theatre included, “Romany Rye,” “The Governor, and “Antietam.” Of “Antietam,” or the Spy of South Mountain,” one newspaper article reported, “A plantation scene will be an especially elaborate piece of stage setting, and Arthur Hurtt, the scenic artist, has provided a cyclorama, showing the stockade prison at Salisbury. Over 500 figures are shown on the canvas, and the scene will be topographically and historically correct” (p. 1).\n\nHurtt also continued scenic work at theaters in Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 1889 he painted scenery for Jacob Litt’s “The Stoaway” at the Bijou. On Oct. 13, 1889, The St. Paul Globe mentioned Hurtt’s continued association with the theatre in the “Foyer Gossip” section, “Arthur Hurtt, scenic artist of the Bijou, was last week called to Denver to paint the new scenery for the Star-Away company, which was burned up while the company was en route from Salt Lake City” (p. 10).\n\nHurtt’s work for Jacob Litt’s Grand Opera House in St. Paul even made news in Iowa. On Sept. 7, 1890, the Sioux City Journal reported, “The scenic artists were Arthur R. Hurtt and Fred E. Powers” (p. 10).\n\nHurtt’s reputation as an easel artist was also on the rise. On Sept. 18, 1890, the Minneapolis Daily Times reported “Arthur Hurtt’s Work. Another Half Hour in the Exposition Art Gallery. There’s a young Minneapolis man whose constant and conscientious work is bound to get him ahead. I refer to Arthur R. Hurtt. He is a clever scenic painter who does not propose to have a drop curtain fall upon him and his art before he has succeeded in appealing to a larger audience than view his stage effects. He puts in all his extra time in hard study, and the results are becoming very creditable to him. In the first gallery at the exposition hangs a picture by Hurtt entitled “Goldenrod.” A young woman in gray is standing in the midst of the Midas-touched flowers. There is some very good work in the picture, especially in the blossoms and the texture and coloring of the gown. Minnehaha is a never-ending joy to the artist or to the genuine nature lover. Her glen has many a beautiful sheltered nook not perceived by the careless comer, only discovered by her to the best of her lovers, just as the noblest of a shy woman is seen only by those who seek her out. Hurtt has painted a bit of “Minnehaha Creek” in No. 466. His “Reflection” too, shows this same hard work which Goethe pronounces the only genius.” (p. 2).\n\nIn 1891, Arthur Hurtt assisted William P. Davis in painting a drop curtain for the People’s Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On April 11, 1891, “The Irish Standard” reported, “The stage has been enlarged and improved, new curtain and scenery being especially designed and painted by W. P. Davis, as assisted by Arthur Hurtt” (page 5). Davis was also a former Sosman & Landis employee who had worked in Kansas City with Lemuel L. Graham in the mid-1880s.\n\nShortly after Hurtt’s work with Davis, he headed east to work in New York and Boston, at Niblo’s and the Globe Theatre, respectively. Touring productions in 1891 included DeWolf Hopper’s “The Lady or the Tiger.”\n\nWhile working in the east during 1892, Hurtt painted drop curtains for stages in: Athol, Mass.; South Norwalk, Conn.; World’s Theatre, Boston, Mass.; and Soldier’s Home Theatre, Togas, Maine. That year, he was living in Boston; first at 426 Broadway S., and later at No. 3, Web Court in South Boston. By 1893, Hurtt listed two residences: 221 W. 11th St., New York City, and the Hillman House in Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite his move, Hurtt continued to return home and paint scenery for Twin City theaters, especially when architect H. G. Carter was involved with the project. In fact, in 1893, Hurtt painted scenery for Minneapolis’ Grand Opera House, Bijou Opera House, and Hennipen Avenue Theatre. On Jan. 1, 1893, The St. Paul Globe announced, “Minneapolis will have another theater, and W. F. Sterling, the veteran manager and prince of good fellows, will be its manager” (p. 13). The article noted that Carter was the architect and “Arthur Hurtt, of the Globe theater Boston, will do the scenic curtain work.” Staff for the new venue was announced on April 1, 1893, in The Star Tribune (p. 3). The article noted, “[Manager Sterling] has postponed the selection of the company long enough to engage his old stage carpenter of the People’s, Wm. Brown, for the new theater. Mr. Brown is at present head stage carpenter for the Harris house in Louisville. He will arrive here sometime before the opening and superintend the construction of the stage. The scenic artist of the new theater will be Arthur Hurtt, now of Niblo’s Garden, New York. Mr. Hurtt is well known in this city and considers it his home.”\n\nHurtt’s hiring coincided with the birth of his adopted daughter, Mildred “Minnie” M., who was born in North Dakota in April 1893. Although, I have yet to uncover any definitive dates pertaining to Minnie’s adoption, on Oct. 5, 1899, The Minneapolis Journal announced, “Arthur R. Hurtt has gone to Fargo, N. D. for a month” (p. 5).\n\nApril 20, 1893, the Star Tribune reported, “Arthur Hurtt, formerly scenic artist of the old People’s (now Bijou) Theater, and lately established in New York and Boston, arrived in the city yesterday to begin arrangements for painting and supplying the new People’s Theatre with scenery” (p. 5). By June, Hurtt began designing for the space. On June 4, 1893, the Star Tribune reported, “L. C. Stafford, proprietor of the new People’s Theater, and Manager Sterling have accepted a bright suggestion for a dramatic introduction to the theater made by the scenic artist, Arthur Hurtt. He will paint four life-sized portraits of great American actors to be handsomely framed and hung on the walls of the entrance-way as a lasting ornament and distinguishing features if the theater. Mr. Hurtt suggested four great actors, but the suggestion was patriotically amended to American actors by Manager Sterling. The sight of the speaking portraits will assist the patrons as they pass in to get into the dramatic spirit that should pervade a theater” (p. 17).\n\nOn June 18, 1893, the Star Tribune announced, “Manager Sterling, of the People’s has accepted the design for the drop curtain submitted by Arthur Hurtt. The picture will be poetic and beautifully colored representation of the coming of spring. There will be flowers, children and a beautiful colored representation of the coming of spring. She will be an ideal queen of the May.”\n\nWilliam E. Sterling, manager of the new People’s Theatre.\n\nInterior of the new People’s Theatre.\n\nOn March 17, 1894, The Irish Standard announced the anticipated opening of the new People (p. 8). The article described the stage, making special mention of Hurtt: “The paint frame and bridge for scenic artist Mr. Arthur Hurtt and his assistants is on the read was and is incessantly occupied by himself and assistants for the production of new scenes for the forthcoming plays, which will have every scene painted especially for them each week. “The new People’s Theatre opened on March 24, 1891; its final cost estimated to be $250,000.\n\nHurtt’s career continued to soar, and on May 31, 1894, The Minneapolis Journal Published a detailed article entitled, “Arthur Hurtt’s Dream” (p. 6). I am including the article in its entirety, as it fills in many blanks and shows how much scenic artists traveled for work.\n\n“There is a good deal more in dreams – some dreams – than people sometimes think, and this was attested the other day in a strangely interesting story told to a Journal man by Arthur Hurtt, the scenic painter at the People’s, and well known too, for his work in the line of landscape.\n\nIn 1879 Mr. Hurtt came to Minneapolis to do some scenic painting for the old Academy of Music. When he had completed his work here, he went to St. Louis for a few days and then to Council Bluffs where he was to do scenes for a new stock company theater just opening in that town. When he was well on with the work in Council Bluffs, he was, as is often the case with a man in any line of work, so interested that he would dream at night of his plans and work. One morning he woke up and recalled a dream he had of a beautiful landscape. It was a place of rare beauty, a dale or valley in the midst of gentle hills surmounted by graceful trees. In the center of the scene stood a large rock with a splendid old elm tree overhanging it, and near at hand, a clear stream from water, were cattle drinking – a most picturesque and interesting scene. So strong an impression did it make upon his mind that he sketched it out during the forenoon, that seeming to be the only way he could rid himself of the dream that haunted him.\n\nA day or two later a landscape was wanted to fill out the set of scenes. Casting about for some material, the artist bethought himself of his dream, got the sketch, and made a scene from it. It was complimented highly and was one of the best things he had ever done.\n\nThis was in the wintertime. In June Mr. Hurtt was in Danville, Ill., putting the scenery in a new stock house at that place. While at work one day some men about the place asked him if he would not like to go for a swim the next day. The Vermillion river is near at hand, a clear, cool stream, and the invitation was accepted, Hurtt took along his sketching box, to note down any suggestion for scenes he might find. When the party was near the bathing place, out in the country some distance from the town, they passed down a little hill and found themselves looking into a beautiful little valley. Hurtt stopped and was suddenly deep in thought. There was something familiar about the place. At last, the thought dawned on his mind that he stood in the presence of the exact scene he had painted from his dream – the same big rock, the high, overhanging elm tree, the wooded hills roundabout, the stream flowing through the grassy valley, and even as he looked some cattle came leisurely down the hill to drink, filling the last detail.\n\nHurtt could hardly speak when he was asked to go on with the party, he was so overcome with a strangeness of the whole thing. He said he would stop where he was and make a sketch and the rest went on. He was hardly able to use his material at first so impressed was he with the fact that he was actually sketching from nature the picture he had before painted from a dream.\n\nThe next day in sauntered and old actor named Keane, who had been playing Council Bluffs when Hurtt was putting in the scenery there and who was a member of the Danville Stock company. After some general conversation he said:\n\n“Say, Hurtt, why don’t you paint a landscape like the one you painted in Council Bluffs; that’s the gem of the whole lot?”\n\nMr. Hurtt told him perhaps he would, and then asked the actor if he wouldn’t like to take a walk. They did so later in the day, and Hurtt piloted him to the little valley and let him discover the scene of the dream. He was quick to see it, and exclaimed:\n\n“Well, here’s where you got your sketch is it, for your scene?”\n\nHurtt told him no. that he had never seen the spot until a day or two before; that he had never been to Danville before in his life. When he told the actor the story Keane was much impressed. It may be that the strain of superstition which some folks maintain runs in the blood of an actor was in the old actor’s veins; at any rate, he wrote a long story for it for the New York Clipper.\n\nBut the strange part of the matter did not end here.\n\nSome months afterward Mr. Hurtt was in St. Louis. He is very fond of paintings, of course, and one day he stepped into a gallery to look over the collection. Passing from picture he at last halted before a large canvas having a beautiful scene – lo! It was the scene of his dream!\n\nHe was sure of it beyond all question – the bog rock, the overhanging elm the cattle drinking. The hilly enclosure, the valley and its grassy carpet – it was his dream scene in all essentials, only worked out in detail somewhat. Ore, as a painter for an exhibition would be apt to introduce more of the details that one painting for a theatre scene.\n\nHurtt was amazed beyond measure. Plainly the artist who painted it must have visited Danville and made a sketch or done the whole painting there; and then he remembered that the manager of the theater had told him how much the scenery around Danville was admired by the artists and how they came there from various parts of the country to make sketches.\n\nThat was all well enough as an explanation of the picture in the St. Louis gallery picture came from – the artist had been there for his sketch, but that didn’t explain the strange fact of the dream in Council Bluffs.\n\nWhile Hurtt was looking at the picture and wondering about the strangeness of the whole thing, by one of those peculiar mental acts which no one can account t for suddenly remembered being in St. Louis before – a year before. He had passed along this same street and by this same gallery. Yes, and he remembered now that he had stopped in front of the window to look at a beautiful landscape when his attention was immediately taken by an accident in the street. A man or woman was hurt, and it was right in front of him, he stepped to the street with the crowd. He had but just glanced at the picture; had not had a chance to more than take in the general scope, and then when the excitement of the accident was over he had passed on up the street without looking in the window again.\n\nBut the one glance had been sufficient to photograph upon his brain the picture, before which he was now standing. In his dream he had called it from its sleeping place in the gallery of his brain.”\n\nIn addition to painting scenery for the New People’s Theatre, Hurtt also was associated with Minneapolis’ Metropolitan Opera House. However, in 1895, scenic art opportunities temporarily drew Hurtt back east. On Aug. 21, 1895, the Minneapolis Daily Times announced, reported “Arthur Hurtt, formerly the scenic artist at the Metropolitan, is now occupying the same position at the Broadway Theater, of New York” (p. 5). Hurtt went to paint for John H. Young, another former Sosman & Landis employee. On Nov. 15, 1896, the Minneapolis Daily Times verified the connection when reviewing Hurtt’s scenery in the McKee Rankin production of “New York As It Is” at the Bijou (p. 15). The article reported, “The production is promised to be adequately staged and the special scenes will include a new exterior showing the famous high bridge over the Harlem River, New York, from the brush of the well known scenic artist, Arthur Hurtt, late of the studio of John Young, of the Broadway Theater, New York.” Hurtt continued to work with Young over the years on a variety of projects. In 1898 Young designed the scenery for “Mistakes Will Happen,” with scenery painted by Hurtt. On June 18, 1898, the Minneapolis Daily Times reported, “Arthur Hurtt, the well-known scenic artist, has constructed and painted a remarkable novel scene from models furnished by John Young, the celebrated Broadway artist” (p. 4).\n\nBy the following year, Hurt was once again working in Minnesota’s Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Hurtt tried his hand at a new entertainment- Living Pictures at the Jacob Fjelde Testimonial. On May 23, 1896, the Minneapolis Daily Times described, “After a short intermission the curtain rose again over a series of very artistic living pictures, arranged by Arthur Hurtt. The first of these showed Leif Ericson, as Jacob Fjelde has sketched him – a sturdy Viking, standing in the prow of his ship, looking ahead to catch the first glimpse of the shores of Vinland. Allegoric representations of the various fine arts followed. Then came two pictures entitled “Gettysburg,” showing scenes from the famous battlefield. These two pictures were among the finest of their kind that have been seen here. The last picture showed Ole Bull, the great violist. This closed a program. Which, although somewhat extended, was excellent in every detail.”\n\nOn May 20, 1896, The Minneapolis Journal described Hurtt’s contribution, reporting, “Most interesting of all, under the circumstances, will be a reproduction, under Arthur Hurtt, of the best works of Fjelde, with living models. The living pictures, for such they will be in fact, will be illuminated by a 10,000-candle power light and will be very beautiful” (p. 13). As previously mentioned, Fjelde sculpted the bust of Hurtt’s mother.\n\nThat summer Hurtt expanded on the scope of his entertainment. He placed an advertisement on July 1, 1896, in the Minneapolis Daily Times advertising, “WANTED – Girls to pose for living pictures; professional models preferred; one small child, 3 or 4 yrs. old, to represent Cupid. Apply to Arthur Hurtt as stage door, Bijou opera house. Tuesday, 3 p.m.” (p. 7). Hurtt was in the process of creating a new entertainment. On Sept. 5, 1896, the Star Tribune “Arthur Hurtt’s Living Pictures at the Metropolitan.”\n\nAnother description of Hurtt’s “Living Pictures” was published in The Minneapolis Journal on Aug. 21, 1896 (p. 5). Here is the article:\n\n“The living pictures presented at Lake Park last night by Arthur Hurtt’s company were a great success artistically and proved an excellent drawing card. The stage arrangements were very complete and satisfactory, although the preparation had entailed a large amount of work, and the lighting was perfect. Many of the pictures were shown in half a dozen different lights, greatly enhancing the interest and artistic effect. A large number of pictures were shown, nearly all being reproductions of famous and familiar paintings. Each was accompanied by suitable musical selections by the orchestra. The pictures were carefully and gracefully posed and were the best exhibition of the kind ever shown in this part of the country, Many of them were encored. Among the pictures shown were Joan of Arc, Psyches’ Mirror, The Fates, Gettysburg. Cupid, Neptune’s Daughter, Diana, Sappho, Spring, Summer, Grace Darling, Hailing the Ferry, Soldier’s Farewell, and Sweethearts. Miss Carrie Millward gave two admirably rendered coronet solos and Miss Lizzie McKeever sang several popular songs in a very fetching manner, which brought enthusiastic recalls. The big laugh of the evening, however, was when the curtain drew back revealing the round form of a “little Jimmy” posed as Dan Cupid with white wings and bow and arrows making a desperate and successful attempt to keep his face straight. The exhibition will be continued this evening and to-morrow, with numerous changes in the program.”\n\nHurtt continued to show his living pictures as a vaudeville feature at the Bijou that fall (Minneapolis Daily Times 3 Sep 1896 p. 4). I was intrigued to discover that his living pictures were paired with an animatography debut at the Bijou Theatre and am including the article as is shows an interesting pairing of early film and live theatre. On Aug. 4, 1896, The Minneapolis Journal announced, “LIKE THE VITASCOPE – The Animatograph Makes Its Debut in Minneapolis” (p. 8). The article continued, “Before 200 guests of Manager Hays, the animatography was given trial at the Bijou last night. The animatography is on the lines of the vitascope, which has been on attraction in Chicago and New York recently. It is the kinetoscope principle extended to fill a stage with moving and life-like scenes. Some of the scene showed typical street sights, ocean views, factory workers, bridges and passengers crossing and recrossing. Every picture was full of life, and it needed only the noise of the street and the crowd to add every element of realism.\n\nG. A. Henry, who superintends the production, brought the machinery and views direct from London, Eng., where they were a part of the variety show at the Alhambra. Theodore Hays has secured the American rights with Mr. Henry and is looking after the bookings in this country. The first public production may be in Minneapolis on the roof of the Guaranty Loan building.\n\nAt last night’s entertainment Arthur Hurtt produced some of his living pictures and they were rewarded with hearty applause.”\n\nIn addition to theatrical endeavors, Hurtt’s easel art was becoming increasing popular. He exhibited watercolors as part of the first spring exhibition of the Minneapolis Art League. Held at Beard’s galleries, his work was featured alongside that of Alexis Fournier, Alex Grinager, Herbjorn Gausta, Prof. Robert Koehler, E. Ofstie, Florence Wales and Miss M. E. Roberts. Of Hurtt’s works, the Minneapolis Daily Tribune reported, “Arthur Hurtt has four strong watercolors, one of an Angora cat being particularly good” (1 June 1896, p. 6). I am going to sidetrack for a moment with the Hurtt family’s love for angora cars. In 1907, their 3-mths. Old angora cat, named Punk, even made the news.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 1907, the Star Tribune announced, “Remarkable ‘Puss’ Drinks From Babe’s Nursing Bottle.” The article continued, “’Punk,’ the talented cat belonging to Mrs. Arthur R. Hurtt, wife of the well known scenic artist, is almost human. He is a frisky little three-months-old Angora. According to his owner he is the smartest ‘baby’ for his age in all Hennepin county and can do tricks without number. One of his cutest stunts and one which he must enjoys is to hold a nursing bottle in his pows [sic.] and immediately get away with the contents of the bottle. While performing this favorite pastime The Tribune photographer caught him. Punk is the son of a full blood Angora cat that survived the San Francisco earthquake” (page 17).\n\nHurtt’s cat, Punk, featured in the Star Tribune, 1907.\n\nAnother picture of Hurtt’s cat, Punk, featured in the Star Tribune, 1907.\n\nIn 1897, Hurtt continued to travel for work, even venturing into Canada. That year he delivered a drop curtain to the New Winnipeg Theatre.\n\nHurtt continued his association with the Bijou. Notable productions that he painted for Litt in 1897 and 1898 include “Under Martial Law,” “The Showman’s Daughter,” “Matilda,” and “Mistakes Will Happen.” His association with the Bijou continued to be listed in the 1897 and 1898 Minneapolis Directories:\n\n“Hurtt, Arthur R., scenic artist, Bijou Opera House, r w s 39th av s nw 49th.”\n\nOther projects in 1898 included “Murray and Mack’s Finnigan’s Ball,” “On the Swannee River,” “Elsie DeTourney’s Joan of Arc,” and “Prisoner of Spain.” After the 1897-1898 season closed, Hurtt opened his own studio, placing advertisement in local newspapers. On 31 Jul 1898 Minneapolis Daily Tribune “SCENERY of all kinds. Studio, 215 Hennepin av, the only place of the kind in the northwest Arthur Hurtt, scenic artist” (p. 15).\n\nHurtt advertisement from Dec. 19, 1899 Minneapolis Daily Times.\n\nOn Dec. 19, 1899, Hurtt advertised in the Minneapolis Daily Times: “Scenery for opera houses, halls and secret orders, Arthur R. Hurtt 215 Hennepin, Mpls.” (p. 6).\n\nFrom the Waszut-Barrett Theatre Collection.\n\nHurtt’s success prompted a residential move. In 1899, the Hurtt family moved to the Minnehaha Falls neighborhood. That summer, Hurtt hosted the wedding of his younger sister, Martha Charlotte Hurtt to Everett Grey Loring at their new home, 4840 39th Ave. S. The Hurtt’s new home was described in the Star Tribune on Aug. 20, 1899 (p. 14): “Mr. Hurtt’s home is situated on a hill overlooking Minnehaha creek as it winds among the trees, and it provided a lovely setting for a happy event.”\n\nOn Feb. 4, 1899, The Minneapolis Journal reported, “The enterprising residents of the Minnehaha Falls District who have built Hiawatha Hall for themselves as the center for the literary, dramatic and social affairs of the suburb, find themselves the objects of many congratulations, not only on this account of the building itself, but because of the artistic drop curtain which Arthur Hurtt, the scenic artist, has supplied for the stage Mr. Hurtt lives on Minnehaha creek, and his environment was therefore well suited to inspire him for his subject. The photograph reproduced herewith gives an excellent idea of his treatment of the subject. The figures were painted from studies made from life in Mr. Hurtt’s studio. The canoe is from the real thing owned by the artist. The scene is on the creek above the falls at the point where Mr. Hurtt has built a rustic bridge near his house. The background is made up of masses of rich greens with a pretty bit of distance. Characteristic birches line the banks, and a deer may be seen peering through the foliage on the opposite shore. The picture is drapes at the top with deerskin fringed in Indiana fashion, and at the top left-hand corner hang beadwork, Indian relics and trophies. A scroll pattern of unique design borders the bottom and sides of the picture, with a strip of gold next to the latter. The whole effect is thus in keeping with the subject and the environment of Hiawatha Hall” (p. 9).\n\nImage of Hurtt’s drop curtain in the Minneapolis Journal, 1899.\n\nOn June 25, 1899, The Saint Paul Globe reported, “Among the most expensive of the improvements is the construction, under the direction of W. K. Brown, of a new and commodious stage in the large pavilion, complete with all the requirements and including a complete equipment of scenery and a most elaborate drop curtain from the brush of Arthur Hurtt, the scenic artist” (p. 28). Hurtt was also credited with Minneapolis’ Metropolitan Opera House and the St. Paul Metropolitan that year (Star Tribune 6 Aug 1899, p. 24).\n\nHurtt’s life and career constantly made news at the end of the nineteenth century. There are so many articles about his scenic work; simply too many to include in this post.\n\nHowever, one really caught my eye. It was quite unique that places Hurtt in a different light, yet gives insight into his personality and character.\n\nOn March 15, 1898, the Minneapolis Daily Times announced, “Arthur Hurtt Tells of Moshik’s Characteristics by the Lines in His Hand” (p. 5). Hurtt read palms. The article reported, “About two months ago, shortly after John Moshik had been sentenced to hang for the murder of Remie Dicharme, Arthur Hurtt, the well-known scenic artist, obtained permission from Sheriff Phillips to visit the condemns man in his cell. Mr. Hurtt is an enthusiastic cheiromant, and he desired to examine Moshik’s hand. Jailer Diffield accompanied him to the cell, and the examination was made, Moshik displaying no unwillingness.\n\nMr. Hurtt examined the hand closely and took a print of it. He told Moshik of various incidents in his past life, and in every case his statements were corroborated by the man who, next Friday, is to pay the penalty of his crime upon the gallows.\n\nHe continued uninterrupted until he told of Moshik’s having rescued from drowning a few years ago.\n\n“You told him that,” cried Moshik excitedly, turning to Jailer Duffield. “You are the only man who knew anything about it. It didn’t happen here, but I told you about it and you told him.”\n\nHe was assured that the two men had never met before, and form that time on dwelt with increased interest on what Hurtt told him. He had been forced to believe in what seemed to him miraculous knowledge of the man before him.\n\nAs already stated, this examination was made some two months ago, a fact which Jailer Duffield will corroborate, and perhaps the most remarkable thing which was disclosed was Mr. Hurtt’s opinion, expressed at that time, that Moshik would commit suicide about March 10. He warned Duffield that if great care was not taken the man would never live to be hanged. On March 8 Moshik took a spoon which he had sharpened for the purpose and attempted to sever the artery in his wrist, as already reported in The Times. Mr. Hurtt had been mistaken by just two days.\n\nAt the close of the examination Moshik asked:\n\n“Do you think they are going to hang me?”\n\n“I don’t see anything in your hand to indicate it,” responded Mr. Hurtt ambiguously.\n\n“I don’t think so either,” responded the murderer, laughing. “I guess it’s all a joke.”\n\nTo a Times reporter, Hurtt said yesterday:\n\n“When I examined Moshik’s hand there was nothing there to tell me that he was to be executed, but there was a line which said he was to die in prison, and another which announced it would likely be by his own hand. It is quite possible, however, that if I were to make the examination to-day I would find that the hand would tell me of his execution. The lines change rapidly, you know. It was merely an accident that the man did not kill himself. The intention was there. He simply did not know how to go about it; that’s all.”\n\nFor the purpose of better calling attention to Moshik’s peculiarities, Mr. Hurtt has contrasted his hand with that of Kelly, a murderer who was executed last year. Mr. Hurtt’s diagnosis of the two hands follows, just as he himself prepared it, shortly after the examination. The picture of Kelly’s hand was taken after execution:\n\n“We have here two hands of two distinct classes of murderers: In the case of Kelly, executed March 1897, the hand of an impulsive, brutal nature. Note the thick, short fingers and thumb. The whole aspect of the hand impresses an intelligent mind as being thoroughly bad. Quite different is the hand of Moshik. This is the hand of a very unlucky man, not alone because of the fact that he was sentenced to hang. No matter what station in life or in what environments, he would have been with such a hand, an unlucky person – unlucky in whatever he undertook, sure to get the worst of it, as the phrase goes. Susceptible and easily influenced by those around him, he came into the world delicate in both mind and body. His mother was insane at the time of his birth and the headline shows that he has inherited insanity, and that this insanity will show itself at times under certain conditions, such as excitement or rage. However, the palm is pink in color, which denoted a bright, sanguine and hopeful nature. His is a rather square palm, with fingers a little mixed. He is versatile, has a considerable amount of mechanical skill and had he not been so unfortunate as to. Be thrown into a channel of life that he was, he would naturally have been polite, neat in dress, and punctual. Inapt in the professions, governed by the sciences, the owners of such hands excel in negotiation, They are industrious and industrial.\n\n“The following are some of the principle events of his past life as shown in his hands, and which no doubt can be verified by Moshik himself. He was quite ill at the age of 5, nearly died with a fever at twelve and was sick again at 15. The different dates of imprisonment are indefinite but show that he spent just half of his life in prison. One term of nearly half a year was for a crime of which he was innocent. At the age of 20 his mind was at ease for about nine months, for at that time he had his liberty. A few years ago he came to near being drowned by attempting to rescue a drowning woman. He has some affection of the heart, as the line of his heart shows. He has loved a woman who has dark hair, dark eyes and is of medium height. He was engaged to be married, but the engagement was broken by another term of imprisonment, where he was terribly injured in the head.\n\n“Kelly’s execution could have been foretold two or three years in advance of the event as the tendencies grew in that direction, and in his hand taken after death his execution is marked in no less than seven ways. But strange to say, Moshik, although under sentence of death, shows only the danger of execution, however, a certain sign in his hand says that he will die in prison.”\n\nThe following year, Hurtt made news again when the passing of Jim Knight made newspapers. On Sept. 23, 1900, the Minneapolis Daily Times announced, “Fall Hermit Passes Away. Demise of the Well-Known Character. ‘Mississippi Jim’ Dies at Hospital” (p. 11). The article began with “James Knight, better known as ‘Mississippi Jim, the hermit of Minnehaha,’ died at St. Mary’s Hospital yesterday, he was 70 years of age.” Of note, a paragraph reported, “Old Jim was found at death’s door two years ago by Arthur Hurtt, scenic artist. He discovered the old man on his bed, in a semi-unconscious sate bu"
