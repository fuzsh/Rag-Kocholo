        "text": "OverviewHistory\n\nA colossal structure located in the Asdana system, with the soaring hotel \"The Reverie\" as its iconic landmark. Once a frontier prison belonging to the IPC, The Family had modeled it to serve as an interstellar transportation hub and the gateway to the Sweetdream Paradise.\n\nPenacony, also known as the \"Planet of Festivities\", is a planet currently administered by The Family in the Asdana star system.\n\nIt is the fourth world and can be accessed after completing the Trailblaze Mission Long Day's Journey Into Night in the Chapter The Sound and the Fury.\n\nThe Trailblaze Mission chapters The Sound and the Fury, Cat Among Pigeons, In Our Time and Farewell, Penacony take place in this world.\n\nOverview[]\n\nGeography[]\n\nReality[]\n\nAlthough called the \"Planet of Festivities\", the actual physical structure of Penacony in reality is that of a colossal artificial space station-like megastructure which houses The Reverie Hotel, surrounded by two small Alderson disks orbiting it. The alderson disks have several landmasses and bodies of water, which were said to be once barren deserts.[1]\n\nCity buildings can be seen jutting out on both from the \"top\" and \"underside\" of the alderson disks. Charmony Doves are a species of bird that inhabit Penacony. Penacony is located in the Asdana, a star system brimming with memoria, which has historically been one of the Macro Voids that leaked out from the Memory Zone. The memoria concentration surrounding Penacony is above normal levels.[2][3]\n\nDreamscape[]\n\nPenacony's Dreamscape is divided into twelve main discrete dream worlds, each corresponding to a \"moment\" on the clock:\n\nMoment of Midnight, the starting point of all dreams.[4]\n\nMoment of Serenity, when the first ray of sunlight shines over the horizon.[4]\n\nMoment of Morning Dew, the start of a day.[4]\n\nMoment of Daybreak, presumably based on the early morning.[4]\n\nMoment of Gilded Hour, presumably the moment before noon.[4]\n\nMoment of Sol, the moment that strikes noon.[4]\n\nMoment of Oasis, presumably afternoon.[4]\n\nMoment of Scorchsand, presumably the moment before dusk.[4]\n\nMoment of Dusk, presumably dusk.\n\nMoment of Blue Hour, presumably the moment after dusk.[4]\n\nMoment of Stars, based on the 11th hour of the clock.[5]\n\nMoment of Golden Hour, based on the moment before midnight.[6]\n\nGolden Hour is said to be the most prosperous \"Moment\" in Penacony, showcasing an entire city bathed in luxury and is the location of the Penacony Grand Theater. Morning Dew is where the majestic Dewlight Pavilion stands, providing a place for high-level members of the Oak Family to discuss business and is where one would go to meet the Family. Scorchsand has vast fields, wild winds, taverns, and a \"festive choice\" of venue. It also hosts the SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue. Dusk is said to be a shopping paradise of chic, luxury and consumerism, and includes the Penacony Auction Hall among other places.[7][8] Sol is steeped in Penacony's history and civilization and contain's Penacony's Grand Museum, the Primal Waking Library and the Paperfold Academy.[6] Serenity is said to be where the most terrifying convicts and \"interesting people\" are held and the jail can be seen on the Nightmare's edge.[9][10] Daybreak is where the Dawn Factory is located, one of the many \"imagination factories\" which processes the foundation of the dreamscape and where workers create all kinds of whimsical works day in and day out in their dreams such as garments.\n\nGilded Hour is Penacony's Currency Center where the exquisitely dressed Pepeshi people of the Alfalfa Family keep fortress-like financial city that is the economic heart of Penacony running, always in a hurry to deposit the Alfalfa credits that they earned into the bank's vault and sending blood that is made from money everywhere on Penacony. Blue Hour is said to be very romantic, featuring a dock, a large boat called the \"Eventide\" anchored along the Sea of Dreams where extravagant balls and marriage services are organized, and an airship called the Radiant Feldspar that sails through all dreamscapes.[11][12][13] Oasis has natural scenes such as Sunshine Park and a beach while Stars has an amusement park, clubs, casinos, and various competitions, including Spheroid, Roboball, and Unicycler.[5][14][15][16][17][8] The Moment of Midnight is the starting point of all dreams. People tend to overlook this moment, believing there's nothing beyond the inky darkness it presents. Chuckles and laughter can be heard from entering the dream.[4]\n\nAreas[]\n\nReality[]\n\nDreamscape[]\n\nSpace Anchors[]\n\nReality[]\n\nThe Reverie (Reality)[]\n\nThere are 2 Space Anchors in The Reverie (Reality):\n\nName Image Description VIP Lounge A luxurious salon designed specially for VIPs.
