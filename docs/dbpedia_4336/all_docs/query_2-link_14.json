        "text": "Have you ever heard the phrase ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do it all?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Well our very own CEO and Founder, Ashley Alderson, is defying the odds of that statement. Ashley is a wife, mother, sister, mentor, CEO, and founder, and she really does it all. I got a chance to chat with Ashley on some topics that fellow business owners and moms are dying to hear about, and her responses were inspiring and motivational, to say the least!\n\nYou can connect with Ashley on her personal Instagram @ajalderson ‚Äì tell her The Boutique Hub sent you! üëã and you can hear from her every week on her podcast, Boutique Chat, where every week she shares actionable tips and takeaways for the retail industry along with some pretty awesome guests!\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs get into our chat with Ashley ‚Ä¶\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your journey to starting The Boutique Hub?\n\nI think sometimes from the outside when you see a successful business, you expect that the journey to get there was somewhat of a linear process. But often, and my story is no different, it was a series of trial and error over time that go us here.\n\nThe Hub started out of my own personal wants, growing up in a rual part of North Dakota, to discover the cute boutiques and shops I loved from around the country, together on one website. When I invested our live savings to build that site, what I soon realized was that it didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶..instead the business owners I was speaking to about being on this site for consumers to discover, really just needed overall business education more than this site.\n\nMy dad always said, it‚Äôs not just what you know, but who, so I began sharing my business and economic development background with this new growing group of retailers, and inviting everyone I knew who had different skills than me to also share with the group. A year later, after coaching for free and pouring into the amazing community forming, we launched our first membership program and it blossomed from there.\n\nLesson? Find a problem someone has and solve it, and don‚Äôt be afraid to pivot along the way until you find what really works. Business plans are just a starting point, but rarely are they the real plan that works.\n\nHaving three busy kiddos, what are your best tips for managing your company while also getting to spend time with family?\n\nBeing busy is such a blessing! But boy, is it hard some days. Our family lives by our group Google Calendar, it‚Äôs layered with 3 kids going 3 directions and two very busy careers and travel schedules. I‚Äôm so thankful we really leaned into setting work boundaries for ourselves long ago, so we rarely let our to do lists spill over into the evening because there simply isn‚Äôt time for it. If we aren‚Äôt at sports, we are spending time together and try to eat as many meals together as we can.\n\nWe also know that we live in seasons, and some are busier or more impactful than others, we talk to our kids about the seasons we are in so if it‚Äôs one full of travel, they know when the end is coming and the season will change. Involving them in our business is helpful for them to see the big picture!\n\nWhat is one thing you wish you knew before starting The Boutique Hub?\n\nThe loudest boo‚Äôs come from the cheapest seats.\n\nI used to have a more difficult time with negative energy or personal attacks. I‚Äôve learned that hurt people ‚Äì hurt people, and it‚Äôs not worth taking personal. I have my own wounds too and my own self reflection and healing journey are so imporant to remain committed to.\n\nWhat is the best piece of advice you‚Äôve ever received?\n\nThe question, ‚Äòare you the bottleneck of your business?‚Äô\n\nI heard this question early on as the business started to grow, and it‚Äôs been a painful but critical and impactful journey to stop being the bottleneck! This is where I developed the framework for others to move from being an entrepreneur to become a CEO whether you employ 0 or 1000.\n\nWhat is one lesson your kids have taught you?\n\nThey‚Äôve taught me to stop procrastinating and trying to fit one more in. There is nothing more soul crushing than telling your kids ‚Äújust one more minute, one more email, just wait..‚Äù and then once you finish they are asleep, disappointed or over it. Do what you say you‚Äôre gonna do, faster.\n\nFavorite activities to do with the kids?\n\nWe love the outdoors so much, so lots of our warm season activity includes horses and rodeo, golf, tennis, hiking, or going to the pool. Everything else centers around basketball!\n\nAny busy family tips? Meal preps, scheduling hacks, chore lists, etc.\n\nEric and I focusing on the $100/hr jobs in our lives and outsourcing the $10/hr ones has allowed us to dig down into what produces the most return whether it‚Äôs financial, long term or personal.\n\nSo things like the lawn, cleaning or even some running errands and things we have part time help for. I used to feel guilty for this, like I can DO this job. But soon realized yes I can do the job, but it‚Äôs not wise for me to do it. My time is more impactful focused on income or ROI generating activity.\n\nOur kids also have chore lists each week that they initial when done, and depending on how many they get done, we will give them $5-$15 per week. They can use that money for concession stands or activities with friends. We love that it‚Äôs helping us get more done, but also teaching them how to earn and spend wisely!\n\nHow do you prioritize time for yourself?\n\nTiger Time ‚Äì my 8-10am is held for no meetings so I can focus on the most important parts of my to do list and getting my day set up right. It‚Äôs so important to me because the other hours of the day are literally back to back meetings or appointments.\n\nOtherwise the small moments for me whether it‚Äôs jamming in the car, cooking dinner, lady‚Äôs golf a few Tuesday nights of the summer, or old lady basketball are my times to just do my thing! No feeling guilty for taking the time you need to resent your brain and have some fun.\n\nDo you have any tips for working with your spouse?\n\nWhew ‚Äì worth it, but it takes some effort to do it right for sure! What has been helpful to us is really knowing our own roles and how they impact the overall company, then staying out of the other‚Äôs way. Eric works on the backend of the business with managing team, contracts, HR, finances and investments. I am all things front facing.\n\nWe also do our best to set boundaries for our kids, marriage and business as needed. Example, Eric loves to talk business from the time he gets in the shower in the morning, I prefer to stat the day talking about the kids and family first and business after 7:30. We have also had to be diligent about setting meeting times with one another to get things done vs fitting it in over dinner.\n\nWhat can we expect in season 6 of the Boutique Chat podcast?\n\nI have never been more excited for a season to launch than this one! Look for new art, new intro‚Äôs, guests requested by the community and a new series called 5 Minute Fridays with quick actionable tips and takeaways that have helped me and helped thousands of our students over the years.\n\nI think I‚Äôm personally turning a corner almost being 40, in being much more open, real and quicker to get into the meat than ever before. I hate fluff, so getting to the deep questions is really what I am after and I hope it‚Äôs helpful to listeners!\n\nYou can connect with Ashley on her personal Instagram @ajalderson and hear from her every week on her podcast, Boutique Chat, where every week she shares actionable tips and takeaways for the retail industry along with some pretty awesome guests!"
