        "text": "MAZOMANIE.\n\nBy Henry Howarth and Henry Z. Moulton.\n\nThis township, located in the northwest corner of the county, was formerly a part of the town of Black Earth, and comprises the north half of township 8 north, of range 6 east, and fractional part of town 9, range 4, lying south and east of the Wisconsin river. The northern portion of this town bordering on the river, was at one time low and marshy; but now, extensive tracts have been drained and brought under cultivation, and in time, will no doubt become very valuable and important lands. Other portions consist of prairie and oak openings, with a rich and productive soil, watered by the Black Earth creek and its tributaries, and is under excellent cultivation, while portions in the eastern and southern parts of the town are bluffy and much less valuable.\n\nThis place may be said to be entitled to the distinction of having been “discovered,” as the early explorers passed down the Wisconsin over two hundred years since, and viewed the lands of which the town is composed, with its extensive marshes bordering upon the river, and its forests and bluffs in the background; the first authentic account of which is that of Father James Marquette, a Jesuit missionary, who, in company with Joliet and five other Frenchmen, passed down the river in June, 1673, on their celebrated voyage of discovery to the Mississippi. At this time, Wisconsin, then unknown as a separate political division, was under the government of France, and so remained until 1759, when it passed into the hands of the British. During the war of the Revolution (in 1780), a force of Canadians and Indians passed down the river to secure a quantity of furs, deposited by Indian traders at Prairie du Chien, from falling into the hands of the Americans. In the “war of 1812,” another force of about five hundred and fifty men, under the command of Col. Wm. McKay, of the British army, consisting of Regulars, Canadians and Indians, passed down the river for the purpose of reducing the fort at Prairie du Chien, and after a desperate resistance on the part of the American troops stationed there, the fort was compelled to surrender. This was in 1814.\n\nIn the Black Hawk war, Mazomanie was the theater of one of the most decisive battles of the campaign, known as the “Battle of Wisconsin Heights.” The Indians having left the Four Lakes, retreated towards the Wisconsin, and the troops under Gen. Henry and Cols. Dodge and Ewing, numbering about six hundred men, having struck their trail, pursued them, until at five o’clock P. M. on the 21st day of July, 1832, they overtook them in a ravine, about three miles south of the present site of Sauk city. The battle was commenced by the Indians trying to gain possession of the bluffs or heights (located on section 24 in this township) for a better position, but were defeated in their designs, and driven with great loss into the marshes and low grounds, and during the following night they crossed the river. The troops remained during the following day scouring the country for the enemy, and preparing litters for the wounded, camping at night on the farm now owned by J. V. Cairns, on section 15. The next morning they returned to the fort at Blue Mounds.\n\nIn the year 1843, the first settlement was made in this township, and large quantities of government lands were entered by the “British Temperance Emigration Society.” Charles Wilson, the agent of this society, accompanied by Joshua Rhodes and Alfred Senier, were the first settlers. They arrived at this place on Christmas day, in 1843, and for shelter and protection against the inclemencies of this season of the year, took possession of an old, deserted Indian wigwam. They were soon after joined by John Holmes and James Ray. They at once commenced the erection of log houses for the accommodation of emigrants that were expected the following season, under the supervision of Mr. Wilson, upon whom devolved the duty of purchasing and locating the lands of the society, dividing them into farms of the proper size, and making such improvements as its rules required.\n\nIn the spring of 1844, they commenced breaking up the soil and putting in crops; five acres to each farm of eighty acres was to be prepared in this manner, and a log house erected thereon 14 by 20 feet, and one and a half stories in height.\n\nIn the latter part of June of the same year, the first of the expected emigrants arrived, among whom were George Robbins, John and Wm. Wrigglesworth, Francis Wilson, Robert North, John Royston, Wm. Thompson, Christopher Bennett, John Kerr, Charles Reeve, Robert Leach, John Linley and Robert Liman, with their families. Wm. Summerville was also among the number, and was the first to sicken and die, and the first to be buried in the cemetery, on the grounds now occupied for that purpose.\n\nIt may not be uninteresting to give a short account of the society, under whose auspices these first settlements were made. The “British Temperance Emigration Society” was organized in Liverpool, in 1842, with branches in many of the important cities and towns in England. The officers of which were Lawrence Heyworth, Robert Gorst, Charles Wilson, Charles Reeve and George Cutler. Each member paid one shilling per week per share, and a share costing £25, when full paid, entitled the holder to a farm of eighty acres, to be selected by the agent of the society. When a sufficient amount of funds would accumulate, they were sent to the agent here for the purchase of lands from the government; an election would then be had for the purpose of selecting members to emigrate and occupy the farms. Those that were thus selected would immediately prepare for emigration. But should any member desire, he could sell his right to another member, taking his chances at the next election. Each member, upon his arrival, would be conducted to the farm selected for him and which would be conveyed to him in legal form upon the full payment of his share. The lands of the society extended from Mill Creek, in Iowa county, through Mazomanie, Berry, Springfield and Westport, and about seventy families settled in the vicinity under its auspices. After a year or two, however, there began to be complaints, and a great deal of discontent was manifested among its members; so much so, that soon after, the society was entirely broken up.\n\nThe first marriage that occurred among the settlers was that of Robert Leach to Miss Emma Reeve, daughter of Charles Reeve, Esq. They were married on the 25th day of September, 1844, by Wm. Welch, Esq., then a magistrate residing in Madison. Melville Wrigglesworth was the first male child born in the settlement; this event occurring in the fall of 1844. He was the son of John and Elizabeth Wrigglesworth, and lived to reach manhood, but his health, always feeble, gave out, and he died some years since. The first physician of the settlement was W. B. Bishop, who came from Liverpool in 1846, where he had practiced medicine for forty years. He was not strictly a resident of the township, but lived a few rods across the line in Iowa county. Charles Wilson, who came in 1844, was the first lawyer, and William Powell, a few years after, commenced the practice of law. His sign may now be seen on the little office adjoining his residence on Hudson street, although his health will not permit of active work in his profession.\n\nThe first school house, a log building, was built in 1849, on the “school section;” these lands were soon after sold, but the owner would not sell any portion for the school house to remain upon, nor would he allow it to be removed; but on one pleasant, moonlight night, it took a “change of venue,” and stood next morning on lands owned by Henry Howarth, on section 15. The first public school was taught here by Mrs. Mary Williams, in the same year. This school house was also used for many years as a place of worship. Services were usually conducted by lay brethren of the Primitive Methodist church, residing in the town. Every fourth Sabbath they were conducted by circuit preachers from Mineral Point who, although having to travel winter and summer, over rough roads and through all kinds of weather, a distance of forty-five miles, were ever faithful and punctual in the discharge of their laborious duties. George Cutler, then a local preacher, also conducted services here, and in 1850, organized a small independent society, called the United Methodists, which organization was maintained for about ten years. Upon a division of the town into school districts, this school house became the property of “District No. 2,” now comprising the entire village and a large portion of the town, the first officers of which were Henry Howarth, John Kerr and T. S. North. Further reference will be made to this district in treating of the growth and business statistics of the village.\n\n“School District No. 3” is located in the eastern portion of the town; has a fine frame school house sufficiently large to accommodate the number of pupils in attendance. The present officers are Thos. H. Ward, Walter A. Johnson and Lewis Blynn.\n\nThere are at the present time three joint school districts, in addition to the districts mentioned, and the entire amount now expended for educational purposes, is about $3,500.\n\nIn concluding this sketch of the early pioneers of the settlement, it will not be out of place to notice some of the privations and hardships necessarily endured in their efforts to make for themselves homes in the distant wilderness. As will be inferred from the manner in which they secured their homesteads, being by weekly installments of about twenty-five cents, they were generally men of limited means, understood but little of agriculture–having principally been mechanics, tradesmen and professional men in their native land–and in opening up and improving their farms the strictest economy was required to procure the necessaries of life. When short of provisions it was the usual custom to borrow from each other until such times as the larder could again be replenished. In some instances resort was had to the coffee mill to grind “flour” enough for bread. One such mill, owned by Dr. Wallace, of Iowa county, and brought by him from “the old country,” was kept running for days together for this purpose. In one instance a settler by the name of Joseph Rogerson “backed” fifty pounds of flour from “Badger State mills” on Sugar river. Francis Wilson, during the summer of 1844, accompanied by another settler, went to the old “Hickox mill” in Iowa county for flour, a distance of eighteen miles. They took two yoke of oxen, and, after an absence of four days, returned with only one hundred pounds; this amount, when divided among the entire settlers, furnished a very small allowance for each family. Only by waiting for the toll from grists brought to the mill during their stay were they enabled to procure even this small amount. For a long time this was the nearest flour mill, and settlers were obliged to make two, and sometimes three, trips before getting their grists. At one time, while this mill was being repaired, Mr. Wrigglesworth and Reuben Royston started in search of some other mill, and were gone over a week before they could find one to grind their wheat.\n\nThe manner of threshing and cleaning wheat in those days was somewhat primitive; they would clear off a large space of ground, put on about four yoke of oxen and tramp it out; the cleaning was performed by throwing the grain in the air and allowing the wind to blow out the chaff.\n\nIn 1848, there began to be a surplus of wheat, a portion of which was traded off for groceries and other necessaries. About this time they commenced hauling to Milwaukee. The manner of making trips to this city was, for three or four farmers to start together, each having not less than two pair of oxen–horses then being almost unknown in the settlement–they would take their supplies from home and, camping out nights, would cook their provisions by the heat of their camp fires. Thirty bushels was considered a fair load, for which they obtained from forty to fifty cents per bushel. On their return they would sometimes load up with salt or merchandise for Madison and other places, as they could find the opportunity. The round trip was usually made in about two weeks. Many times, from delays caused by bad weather and roads, or some accident to team or wagon, their expenses would use up nearly the entire proceeds of their wheat.\n\nThe settlers procured what few necessaries they required or could afford, from Sauk City–a town of “one stores;” from Dover, in Iowa county; from Pokerville (West Blue Mounds), twelve miles distant, or from Madison, a distance of twenty-three miles. When any one went to the latter place, he would procure such necessaries as were required by his neighbors, and would also get the entire mail for the settlement.\n\nThe times were very hard for several years after the first settlements, and very little money was to be had. Fifty cents per day was considered a good price for a day’s work; usually paid for in flour, meat or other provisions. The usual price paid for harvest help was one bushel of wheat per day.\n\nThe early settlers had but little dealings with the Indians, although for many years they were passing up and down the Wisconsin for the purpose of hunting and trapping, and occasionally would camp in the near vicinity. They were always friendly and peaceably disposed. In 1851, a procession of from six to seven hundred of the following tribes, Chippewas, Pottawattamies, Winnebagoes, Stockbridges and Hurons, passed along, marshaled by the United States authorities, with a band of music and several banners of the stars and stripes floating to the breeze. They were being conducted to their several reservations west of the Mississippi, but before their arrival at their respective destinations, it was found that at least one-half of their numbers were missing, they having dropped off in the night time, preferring their Wisconsin homes to the comparatively unknown territory to which they were being removed.\n\nThe town was first called Gorstville; this was subsequently changed to Pleasant Valley, then to Farmersville, and then to Black Earth. The southern portion, being the south half of town eight, still retains this name, but the northern portion was set off in 1858, under the name of Mazomanie, a name given to it by the first proprietors of the village, signifying, in the Indian language, “The iron that walks,” or “Walking iron,” and should be written with one capital, not as a compound word, as is sometimes done.\n\nThe first officers for the new town of Mazomanie were: Supervisors–John Greening, chairman, James Craney, Philip Wagner; town clerk–Wm. L. Freeman; treasurer–S. E. Waterhouse; assessor–James Hayes; town superintendent–Dr. E. D. Bishop; justices–John Greening, Barney Campbell, John Huntington, Thomas S. North; constables–Joseph Bennett, Wm. Brink.\n\nThe present officers are: Supervisors–Luther Clark, chairman, Joseph Bennett, H. B. Catlin; town clerk–H. Z. Moulton; treasurer–B. R. Cowdery; assessor–Ed. Pratt; justices–George Cutler, S. Moulton, H. Z. Moulton; constable–John Wilcox.\n\nThe population of the township at the present time is about eighteen hundred. The value of real and personal property of the town and village for the year 1877, as appears from the assessment roll of the town, is $457,000.\n\nVillage.–While the Milwaukee and Mississippi railroad was in process of construction through our state, and the line was being surveyed through this town, the directors of the road noticed that a fine location presented itself for a village, north and west of the bluff on section 16. They observed that by maintaining a proper grade in building their road, a fine water power could be developed by making the grade serve the purpose of confining the waters of Black Earth Creek upon one side for a distance of about three-fourths of a mile, and determined to take advantage of the circumstances thus presented, to lay the foundation of a thriving village. Accordingly, after purchasing a portion of the north-west quarter of said section 16, Messrs. E. H. Brodhead, Eliphalet Cramer, Anson Eldred and Moses Scott, as proprietors, joined with Abram Ogden, a previous owner, laid out what is known as the original plat of the village. This was in the early part of the year 1855. During the same year, John Hudson and William Robinson platted a portion of section 9, under the respective titles of Hudson’s, Robinson’s and University additions, and, subsequently, Henry Walker and Alfred Senier platted portions of sections 8 and 16, under the respective names of Walker’s and Senier’s additions. The proprietors of Prairie addition were A. W. Curtis, John Catlin and Edward Barber.\n\nDuring this year the first buildings were erected, and before the close of the season, quite a village presented itself to the gaze of those old settlers who had toiled and endured so much, and with a near prospect of a railroad upon which they could send away their surplus produce, and through its influence, could once more enjoy the benefits of social intercourse with the outside world, began to feel that they were indeed “about to receive that for which they had so long wrought.”\n\nThe first arrivals were D. W. Bronson and family, David and W. H. Whitney. Mr. Bronson and the Whitneys immediately commenced work on the first store building erected in the village, the entire party living in the meantime in a shanty situated in the rear of the site upon which the “Carlisle House” now stands.\n\nThe first store was opened by S. Holbrook and John Martin, followed soon after by that of S. E. Waterhouse and D. W. Bronson. George Butler built and opened the first hotel under the name of the “American House.” This was the first frame building erected in the village. It was rebuilt and improved in 1869, and the name changed to the “Carlisle House.”\n\nSoon after, the “Mazomanie Hotel,” now known as the “Freeman House,” was built by H. A. Cowdery. The first blacksmith shop was established by John and Joseph Wilson.\n\nAmong those that came here in 1855, not already mentioned, were Saulsbury Bros., Mr. Parsons, John Robinson, C. D. Haven, G. T. Whitney, Allen and Angus Macdonald, W. U. Hover, L. D. Brooks, A. S. Sanborn, William Allen, and S. H. Vedder.\n\nG. T. Whitney was the first postmaster, but the business of the postoffice was transacted by Messrs. Bronson and Waterhouse. He was appointed under the administration of Franklin Pierce, and was succeeded by William L. Freeman. D. W. Bronson, the present postmaster, was appointed in 1861, and has held the office ever since.\n\nIn June, 1856, the railroad first reached the village, and gave at once a fresh impetus to its growth and prosperity. The first passenger cars arrived, and the first time-table was established on the 7th of that month, and on the 10th there was a rousing “Railroad Celebration” in honor of the event, said to be among the greatest gatherings ever had in Mazomanie. People were here from the surrounding country for a great distance, and it was no doubt a day of general rejoicing.\n\nThe depot, a very fine structure, was built the preceding year. This building, however, was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1857. A large and commodious eating house was built adjoining the depot, and for several years, trains stopped for refreshments at Mazomanie in place of Madison. In 1862, the building was taken down and removed, thus becoming one of the institutions of the past.\n\nJohn B. Stickney was the first depot agent, and is now the oldest acting station agent in the state of Wisconsin. He came on the advent of the cars, and has ever since retained the position, which fact is sufficient evidence that he has the confidence, not only of the managers of the road, but of the community of which he has so long been a prominent and active member.\n\nMr. Hutchins was the first wheat-buyer, but the first grain warehouse was erected by L. A. Lincoln in 1856.\n\nManufacturing Interests.–In 1857, Lynch & Walker, of Milwaukee, became the owners of the water power before referred to, and erected thereon a large and commodious flouring mill. A few years after this the mill was purchased by William Thompson, who became a permanent resident of the place, and for many years transacted a large and profitable milling business, giving employment to a great number of operatives. Mr. T. spent large sums of money in improvements on the mill. He was an active business man and a good citizen; generous, open hearted, and took great interest in all public improvements. The mill is now operated by Messrs. E. Sanderson & Co., of Milwaukee–under the charge of J. T. Vought–who have made extensive alterations and improvements, involving an outlay of about $15,000. Considering the strength and permanency of its water power, its close proximity to the railroad, its capacity for work and thorough state of repair, and its ready access to the markets and to the large grain growing districts of Iowa and Minnesota, it must be placed among the very best flouring mills of the state.\n\nThe frame flouring mill, now standing on section 8, was moved to its present location in 1864, by John Cropper and Ch. L. Jacobi, and was operated by Mr. Cropper until 1876, when he sold his interest to Robert Patterson. This is a much smaller mill, and is intended principally for custom work, although it has the requisite machinery for manufacturing what is termed “patent” flour.\n\nThe next important business enterprise established in the place was the manufacture of fanning mills, and out of its introduction important branches of industry have been built up, in giving employment to a great number of mechanics, and support to many families. In 1860, John Warren, Nathaniel and Stillman Moulton, built a large three story brick and stone building for this purpose, with steam power and machinery for planing, matching, sawing, etc. A large business was established, which steadily increased from year to year; but on the 2d day of May, 1865, a great calamity befell them, in the loss by fire of their building and entire stock, prepared during the preceding winter ready for “setting up” into mills. N. Moulton having withdrawn in 1863, the loss fell upon the other members of the firm, and was very severe, there being no insurance. A circumstance worthy of note in this connection is the fact that the machine shop of N. T. Davies, situated on the exact location, was destroyed by fire on the 10th day of May, 1877, exactly twelve years after.\n\nGeorge and N. T. Davies, the successors of J. Warren & Co., rebuilt the premises and made extensive additions and improvements, both in buildings and machinery, including the establishment of a foundry and machine shop. N. T. Davies, now the sole proprietor, is doing a large business in the manufacture of fanning mills, wagons, milk safes and other farm machinery, having with commendable pluck and perseverance rebuilt the portion recently destroyed by fire.\n\nPritchard and Davies are also extensive manufacturers of mills and safes.\n\nFanning mills are also manufactured by D. N. Smith and George Davies.\n\nJohn Parman and Charles J. Trager are each the owners and proprietors of a large establishment for the manufacture of wagons and carriages; and for strength, durability, style and finish, their work will compare favorably, if not excel, that of any other establishments of their kind in the country. As evidence of this fact, they are receiving orders not only from the city of Milwaukee, but from places in the northwest and southwest portions of our state, as well as from Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nThe Mazomanie cheese factory, owned and operated by Messrs. Humphrey & Sherwin, ranks among the important business enterprises of the town. This factory was built early in 1875, and under the efficient management of Mr. Daniel Humphrey, with Theo. J. Elmer as cheese maker, has been very successful, thus proving the wisdom of the merchants and business men who contributed so liberally to its establishment.\n\nJohn Darlington is the manufacturer and patentee of a washing machine called the “Darlington Washer,” which is said to be an excellent machine.\n\nChurches.–The First Congregational Society was organized at the log school house before mentioned, in 1853, by Rev. David M. Jones, of Arena. Through his labors a church was erected in 1855, of which he was the first pastor. Subsequently this church building became the property of the Evangelical Association, by whom it was used until 1874, when it became private property. In 1871 the society built a very fine frame church on Hudson street, under the labors of the Rev. M. M. Martin, who is the present pastor.\n\nThe First Baptist Society of Mazomanie and Black Earth was organized April 11, 1857, with Rev. Moses Rowley its first pastor. For many years they occupied the seminary. In 1865, the society was reorganized as the First Baptist Society of Mazomanie. In 1866, under the labors of Rev. Moses Pickett, they built a large frame church on Hudson street, and services are now conducted therein by Rev. Joseph Bowman, of Lodi.\n\nIn 1847, the Primitive Methodist Society was organized by Rev. George Stevens, a local preacher, and services held in private dwelling-houses. In 1850, the society was reorganized by Rev. James Alderson, and attached to the Mineral Point circuit, and in 1857, they built a small frame church. Although this society is small, they have never failed in keeping up regular services. The present year (1877) they have erected a fine parsonage near the church. The present pastor is Rev. John Ralph.\n\nThe Methodist Episcopal Society was organized November 7, 1856, with a membership of eighteen. Rev. Robert Rowbotham was the first regular pastor. The church now owned by this society–the largest and most commodious church building in the village–was erected under the labors of the Rev. J. D. Searles. The corner-stone was laid by Gen. Fallows, with due formality, in June, 1865, and in September, 1867, it was dedicated. Bishop Simpson preached the dedicatory sermon; Dr. Raymond, of Evanston College, assisted in the services. The present pastor is Rev. E. T. Briggs.\n\nSt. Luke’s Mission (Episcopal) was organized January 8, 1868, and Rev. J. B. Pradt called as missionary. For about two years, services were held in the Town Hall. In December, 1869, they held their first service in St. Luke’s Church, a fine brick edifice erected principally through the liberality of William Thompson and Richard Black. The present missionary in charge is Rev. Henry M. Green.\n\nThe first regular preacher of the Evangelical Association, so far as can be ascertained, was Rev. Henry Ragartz, who preached here in 1853.\n\nServices were usually held at the residence of different members, until 1864, when they purchased the church building formerly owned by the Congregational Society. This they occupied until 1874, when they found, from the growth of the society, that they needed more room. They built a very pretty and substantial stone church on Hudson Street, which was dedicated on the 29th of October of the same year, by Bishop Jacob Escher. Rev. Peter Held is the present pastor.\n\nCatholic.–In 1856, this church erected a frame edifice of which Father Stroker was the first regular priest. In the year 1863, finding their church building too small for the congregation, a new building was erected under the labors of Father McGinty. They now have a fine frame edifice, with a dwelling near for the residence of the priest. Father Mazeaud is the present priest.\n\nSecret Societies.–A dispensation was granted December 5, 1857, for the organization of a Masonic lodge, and on the 9th day of June of the following year, a charter was granted to Crescent Lodge, No. 91, A. F. & A. M.; with Alden S. Sanborn, its first master, and John B. Stickney, its first secretary. The membership of this lodge has increased gradually until it now numbers sixty-eight members. Illustrative of changes constantly going on in society is the fact that upwards of one hundred and fifty names have been enrolled as members of this Lodge since its organization.\n\nThe most serious drawback that this society has encountered was, in the loss of their lodge-room and entire furniture and records, destroyed by fire, May 2, 1865. They had bought and paid for the third story of the building erected by J. Warren & Co. This gave them a large and commodious hall, and was well furnished. The last payment on the hall was made but a few weeks previous to the fire. They now hold their meetings in the third story of Turck’s block. B. R. Cowdery is the present master, and H. Z. Moulton, secretary.\n\nGood Templars.–Mazomanie Lodge, No. 65, I. O. G. T. (afterwards changed to No. 14), was instituted January 15, 1858, with William Robinson, W. C. T., and John Howarth, W. R. S. This lodge has met with varying success since its organization. Like all other institutions having for their object the advancement of moral and social reform, it has its seasons of depression as well as of prosperity; but there is little question that this order, aside from its direct effect upon individuals, has exerted a great influence in building up a healthy temperance sentiment in the community. The membership of this lodge is about one hundred and thirty. Samuel Murrish is its present W. C. T., and T. F. Stair its present W. R. S. They have a hall in Turck’s block, and meet on Friday evening of each week.\n\nMendotas.–Montezuma Council, No. 8, I. O. M., was organized February 22, 1876. This is a social order, having temperance as one of its prominent objects. The membership is seventy-eight. The present officers are L. C. Oulmann, Sachem, and W. Y. Ridell, Writer. They meet in Good Templar’s hall every Monday evening.\n\nThe Patrons of Husbandry, No. 318, was organized January 10, 1874, and meet on Saturday evenings in “Butz” hall. Their membership is forty-six. Present officers are Henry Powell, Master, and O. B. Haseltine, Secretary.\n\nPublic Schools.–Mazomanie has for many years been justly celebrated for the efficiency of her public school, which has been the principal means of attracting many families to our place for the educational advantages it offered. This is mainly attributable to the liberality of its citizens in providing suitable buildings, and in the employment of teachers of undoubted capabilities as principals, among whom may be mentioned Lyman Hutchinson, N. E. Goldthwaite, W. A. De La Matyr, M. E. Wadsworth, L. D. Harvey and Miss Inez C. Childs, all of whom have materially contributed to its success. The present principal is Charles F. Harding, of Springfield in this county.\n\nIn 1857, a frame school house was built to take the place of the log house before referred to, of ample size, as was supposed, to accommodate the increase of pupils consequent upon the growth of the village; but it was barely finished, before a portion had to be sent to the seminary building. In 1861, was commenced the erection of a brick edifice, 50 by 50 feet, two stories in height. This was completed the following year, when the school was first organized under the graded system. In 1868, an addition was built, 30 by 50 feet, of the same height, making a building 50 by 80 feet, which was arranged for five departments. In 1876, however, it was again found necessary to occupy the former building, now known as the Town Hall, and to establish a primary school near the Wisconsin river.\n\nIn 1876, a free high school was established in the district, receiving state aid as provided by law. The grade, however, was already sufficient to enable pupils to enter the freshman class at the State University without further preparation; as an instance, at the last commencement, the following pupils passing directly from our school, graduated from this institution, namely: Misses Alice Stickney, Florence E. Mitchell, Hattie M. Hover, Tillie Reul, and Mr. W. A. Hover.\n\nThe district contains about five hundred and fifty pupils of school age, and upwards of four hundred were in attendance that past year. Number of teachers employed, eight; cost of instruction, about $3,000 annually. Value of school building and site is over $10,000. The site contains eight lots, and is one of the prettiest locations for the purpose to be found. Good sidewalks are provided not only about the building and across the grounds, but reach to nearly all portions of the village, except on the higher grounds where they are not so much needed.\n\nThe present officers of the district are, Jonathan Jones, J. C. Cowdery and H. Z. Moulton, the latter having served in the capacity of clerk without interruption since 1862.\n\nThe business and other interests, not previously mentioned, are represented by J. C. Cowdery & Son, bankers; W. U. Hover, J. Murrish & Sons, C. M. Howe, L. A. Lincoln, J. A. Schmitz, Charles Butz, W. W. Whalon, and S. V.

Seymour are the proprietors of the extensive nurseries. The medical fraternity are represented by Wm. H. Gleason, T. F. Stair, C. A. Lyman and T. S. North; dentistry by J. G. Mawney; insurance by H. Z. Moulton.\n\nThe place is supplied with excellent hotels, all of which are well kept, and sufficiently large and roomy for the accommodation of the traveling public, who may feel assured of receiving the utmost attention from the genial proprietors. The “Carlisle House,” kept by James Carlisle, is the largest; next in size and pretensions is the “Freeman House,” kept by Theo. Freeman, while the “Commercial Hotel” is under the charge of John Westhauser, proprietor. Mr. N. Kirch has recently erected large and commodious buildings, and, in connection with other business, proposes to provide for the entertainment of the traveling public.\n\nThe Weekly Sickle, a newspaper published by D. W. Bronson & Son, with S. E. Bronson as editor, is among the important enterprises of the place, and is of great value and convenience to the citizens and business men. The first issue was dated March 9, 1874, and the circulation has increased gradually until it now numbers five hundred subscribers.\n\nThe village of Mazomanie is what may be termed a “railroad town,” as it was directly through its influence that the place was first started, and through its business employment is given to a great number of persons. The construction train of the western division of the railway from Milwauke [sic] to Prairie du Chien makes its headquarters here. The train is under the charge of E. J. Whitney, conductor, with Frank Robinson as engineer, Mr. R. having held this position since 1865. This station ranks the fifth on the line (Pra. du C. division) as to amount of business. There is paid out to its different employees not less than $2,000 monthly, giving direct support to about fifty families, and indirectly adding largely to the general business interests of the town.\n\nThe Fire Department of Mazomanie is well deserving of attention in this sketch. It has been organized and worked up under exceeding difficulties, and several years have elapsed since its first conception, but through the persistent efforts of a few of her citizens–among whom may with propriety be mentioned the names of C. J. Trager, T. W. Wilson and R. Black–and the liberality of the business men of the place, it has now a well organized fire company, with an “A1” hand power engine, hose cart and hook and ladder outfit, including trucks, ladders, buckets, etc., costing upwards of twelve hundred dollars. The present officers are, C. J. Trager, foreman; J. A. J. Shower, first assistant, and T. T. Huntington, second assistant.\n\nThe population of the village is now about twelve hundred, mostly of American and English extraction. Of the foreign element, the Germany largely predominates, although the “Emerald Isle” furnishes a large representation. And while it is but slowly increasing in wealth and population, there seems to be an air of permanency about the village and its improvements, that surely denotes a prosperous future.\n\nThe resources of the place are much the same as contribute to the support of nearly all our western towns, being principally from grain growing districts around, making this a common center, although a peculiar adaptation of the surrounding country to grazing purposes will, at no distant future, make of it one of the most important dairying districts in the southern portion of the state. Even now it is estimated that more butter and eggs are shipped from this station than any other on the road west of Milwaukee.\n\nLocation and Scenery.–A sketch of Mazomanie would be incomplete that did not refer to its advantages as a place of residence, for such as desire a more quiet and retired life than the city affords, and yet enjoy most of its conveniences. The village is pleasantly located on both sides of the Black Earth creek, where it opens out into the valley of the Wisconsin. South of the railroad, which passes through the place, a little south of the center, is a sharp rise of ground for a few rods, where we find a large plateau, where are many beautiful locations for residences not yet occupied. Still south of this, and adjoining the village, is a range of very pretty bluffs, skirted with forests of oak, making a fine background, and giving to the scenery a very picturesque appearance.\n\nA magnificent view of the place and of the surrounding country may be had from the “school section” bluff on the southeast, which rises abruptly to the heights of about three hundred feet above the level of the Wisconsin river. From this elevation the observer may look down upon the village, nestled among the maples and elms, with which every street is lined, and which have become the pride of its citizens. Glancing to the northward, he will see the Wisconsin skirting the bluffs on the opposite side, many of which her currents have hewn squarely down to the water’s edge; towards the northeast, he sees in the distance, across an alternating landscape of forest and field, the prairies of Sauk county, dotted here and there with farm-houses, and extending back to the Baraboo bluffs. On the east and southeast, Black Earth creek and her tributaries may be seen winding their serpentine courses through pleasant valleys and rich meadows, with the constantly varying scenery of forest, bluff, and cultivated field. On the south, at a distance of twelve miles, he distinctly sees the lofty summits of the Blue Mounds, towering like sentinels above the intervening elevations of land, while turning to the westward, the view opens upon a magnificent perspective of the broad valley of the Wisconsin, which may be seen for a distance of forty miles, an almost unbroken landscape of field and meadow, diversified with constantly receding patches of forest, while at intervals in the distance the abrupt faces of the bluffs upon either side of the river seem to approach each other, until at nearly the utmost range of vision they appear to meet, thus closing up the further view of the course of this magnificent river, on its way, through narrow defiles and shifting sands, to join the Father of Waters on his course to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAlthough this village is not noted for its magnificent edifices, yet she has many pretty residences, public buildings, and places of business, no less than thirty of which are substantial, first-class brick and stone buildings. It has been the pride of her citizens to not only supply the lack of a natural growth of forest trees, by planting out large quantities of the rapidly growing maple and elm on the streets, and with various kinds of evergreens and deciduous trees of different species, in private yards and grounds, but in beautifying them with flowers and shrubs, and adorning their dwellings with choice pictures and rare curiosities, as well as in providing for the literary and musical culture and entertainment of the household.\n\nSociety.–A noticeable feature in the social elements of which Mazomanie is composed is, that while it boasts of as good society as is furnished by any town of its size and pretensions, there is but little inclination to divide into “sets,” as is too often the case, but with remarkable unanimity, her citizens are disposed to treat each other with the consideration to which they are entitled, without regard to “worldly wealth or honors.” In societies and other organizations, a certain degree of exclusiveness is necessarily required.\n\nIn summing up the many desirable features possessed by Mazomanie, we must not overlook that of health, which is paramount to all other considerations in selecting a place for permanent location. It has long been known as one of the most healthful places in the country, as has often been remarked by those who have been acquainted with it for many years. Adding to this its beauty of location, its business capacities and resources, its convenience to leading places of the northwest, such as Milwaukee, Chicago, the capital of the state, etc., ready access to all points in Iowa and Minnesota, its society, churches and schools, make it one of the most desirable places ofresidence to be found among the smaller towns of the state."
