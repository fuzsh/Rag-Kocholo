        "text": "The beginnings of automotive crash testing\n\nFrom the first traffic death in 1869 until the 1950s, the automotive industry had paid little attention to safety, and any testing that manufacturers did perform was done with pigs and other animals or with human volunteers and cadavers.\n\nIn 1966, Ralph Nader’s seminal book Unsafe at Any Speed became a best-seller, and the U.S. Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which would lead to creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency, or NHTSA, in 1970. These events and others demanded the development of crash test dummies that could more faithfully replicate human anatomical response to the full range of potential crash forces.\n\nThe first crash test dummies specifically for the automotive industry were Sam Alderson’s VIP series, introduced in 1966, which included average male, large male and small female “vehicular impact personnel” for frontal crash testing. In 1971, features of the VIP series along with parts from Sierra Engineering were incorporated by General Motors into the Hybrid I, offering improved biofidelity and greater repeatability of results.\n\nWith NHTSA sponsorship, further upgrades were incorporated into the Hybrid II series, which was introduced in 1973 and became the first dummy to be officially entered into the 49 CFR Part 572 standards for anthropomorphic test devices.\n\nAdvancing the state of the art\n\nThe VIP, Hybrid I and Hybrid II dummies were primarily useful for testing seatbelt designs at a time when over half of serious injuries and fatalities were due to head trauma. While the Hybrid II is still used to this day in aircraft testing, a more robust and sophisticated dummy was needed for automotive manufacturers to develop effective techniques for also preventing neck, thoracic, leg and other injuries, in humans of all ages, sizes and shapes.\n\nThis need led to the development of the Hybrid III series, introduced in 1978 and still required for frontal impact testing as specified in FMVSS 208 and part 572. Humanetics’ predecessor company, in partnership with the Society of Automotive Engineers, Ohio State University, and others, continued to advance the state of the art with Hybrid III improvements and expansion of the series to include large male and small female models. Child models were introduced to the series beginning in 1994.\n\nLeading a global industry into the future\n\nIn 1999, Humanetics acquired the dummy development and manufacturing business of TNO Automotive, Europe's leading and largest dummy company, creating the first truly global dummy development and manufacturing company.\n\nThroughout its history and continuing today, Humanetics has been key to the development and manufacture of a complete range of test dummies. These include side-impact, rear-impact, children, pedestrian models and more—plus the Test device for Human Occupant Restraint, or THOR, the next generation in dummy biofidelity, instrumentation, repeatability, durability and user-friendliness.\n\nIn the 21st century, Humanetics has greatly expanded its mission to encompass a complete range of technologies to protect life in motion.\n\nFor example, we provide test equipment for calibration and certification of test dummy instrumentation. Our iCrash Technology™ provides fully integrated onboard data acquisition systems, ensuing greater flexibility, improved repeatability, and reduced setup times during testing. We offer computer-aided analytics using virtual models that replicate our physical dummies in software, providing a cost-effective complement to physical product testing.\n\nOur UltraFlat Overrunable robot, or UFO, enables testing of advanced driver assistance systems designed to avoid collisions by minimizing or correcting for human errors. It’s an extremely low-profile, remote-controlled platform that can be mounted with targets representing cars, cyclists, pedestrians, pets and more to test vehicle crash-avoidance sensors and controls. We also provide driving robots, accident reconstruction software, and much more.\n\nBeyond automotive safety\n\nHumanetics also continues to lead the industry in aerospace and military safety testing equipment, and we are actively expanding our safety mission into other realms.\n\nFor example, we have added HITEC Sensor Developments to our portfolio, providing hostile-environment sensors and strain gages for safety applications in marine, transportation, aerospace and other industries. We have also added Fibercore for its specialized fiber optic systems, used in a vast array of sensing and communication applications.\n\nIn growing our business, we have established offices and manufacturing facilities around the world, and we consult with many leading laboratories and research institutions to advance the cause of human safety.\n\nWe believe the project of creating a safer world never ends. In fact, we continually seek new beginnings. From our rich, proven history through to a future of continuous innovation, look to Humanetics as the human safety leader."
