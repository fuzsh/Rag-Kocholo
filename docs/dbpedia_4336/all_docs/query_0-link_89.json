Country music has been made by and loved by Black people since it’s conception. For just as long, Black people have been overlooked and disregarded in the genre by fans and executives. Black Opry wants to change that. They invite you to discover, support and enjoy the Black artists that make magic in this space. One of the most valuable aspects of country music is its versatility and diversity in sound. Country, blues, folk, and Americana music often overlap or weave together- these artists explore all of those sounds and intersections. The Black Opry Revue showcases the diversity in sound and stories that Black artists offer to these genres. Black Opry artists Leon Timbo and Ally Free are participating in this year’s Word of South, in solo shows Saturday and then a combined show Sunday afternoon.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama are recognized worldwide as living legends of gospel music. Celebrated by The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and The Recording Academy/GRAMMYs with Lifetime Achievement Awards, inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and winners of five GRAMMY® Awards, they have attained the highest levels of achievement in a career that spans over 70 years. The Blind Boys are known for crossing multiple musical boundaries with their remarkable interpretations of everything from traditional gospel favorites to contemporary spiritual material by songwriters such as Eric Clapton, Prince and Tom Waits. They have appeared on recordings with many artists, including Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Aaron Neville, Susan Tedeschi, Ben Harper, Patty Griffin and Taj Mahal. Recently, the group’s decades-long mission of spreading light and love has taken on even deeper context, as they’ve reckoned with the loss of two of their own, Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore, both longtime members of the Blind Boys tight-knit family. The new album ‘Echoes Of The South’ is released in their honor – as well as for the group’s recently-retired leader Jimmy Carter – and keeps the Blind Boys’ long-held mission statement at its core: “As long as everybody gives all that they have to give and we sing songs that touch the heart, we’ll live on forever.” The Blind Boys of Alabama will perform a musical set at Word of South and also discuss their new book, Spirit of the Century, written with Preston Lauterbach.\n\nSofia Camile\n\nSofia Camille is a bilingual singer/songwriter based in Tallahassee, Florida. With a wide variety of genres ranging from r&b/soul to folk, Sofia Camille has a song for every ear. When she’s not singing or writing music, you can find her drinking Delirium Red, cooking Puerto Rican food for her friends, and defeating her bandmates in pickleball.\n\nSofia’s music draws inspiration from places she has traveled, people she has met, and stories she has heard. She’ll be appearing at this year’s Word of South with the young adult author Ginny Myers Sain.\n\nWilli Carlisle\n\nWilli Carlisle is a poet and a folk singer for the people, but his extraordinary gift for turning a phrase isn’t about high falutin’ pontificatin’; it’s about looking out for one another and connecting through our shared human condition. Born and raised on the Midwestern plains, Carlisle is a product of the punk to folk music pipeline that’s long fueled frustrated young men looking to resist. After falling for the rich ballads and tunes of the Ozarks, where he now lives, he began examining the full spectrum of American musical history. This insatiable stylistic diversity is obvious in his wildly raucous live performances, where songs range from sardonic trucker-ballads like “Vanlife” to the heartbreaking queer waltz “Life on the Fence,” to an existential talkin’ blues about a panic attack in Walmart’s aisle five. With guitar, fiddle, button-box, banjo, harmonicas, rhythm-bones, and Willi’s booming baritone, this is bonafide populist folk music in the tradition of cowboys, frontier fiddlers, and tall-tale tellers. Carlisle recognizes that the only thing holding us back from greatness is each other. With a quick wit and big sing-alongs, these folksongs bring us a step closer to breaking down our divides.\n\nKelsey Barnard Clark\n\nKelsey Barnard Clark is a born and raised Gulf Southerner from Dothan, Alabama. She has developed an impressive resume, including being the fifth woman and first southerner to win the title of Top Chef, and was also voted fan favorite following her season 16 win.\n\nKelsey got her start in the food industry working for a high-end caterer and catered her first solo wedding at age 15. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, she worked savory & pastry in several Michelin-star restaurants in New York City, including Café Boulud under Gavin Kaysen, and Dovetail under John Fraser.

Like many family groups, their songs are anchored by the sort of elastic, entwined harmonies that only seem to exist among kin. On their second record, West of Here, their songwriting chops match those interlocking voices, with all three members contributing songs to an album that deals with the constant search for home. Following their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys took the opportunity to explore different avenues of creativity. In 2020 the trio launched a podcast, This Side of the Mic, to showcase songs and share some laughs and insights. The band leveraged their down-time into writing and demoing dozens of new tracks, polishing their production chops and collaborating with fellow creators to expand their sound. The singles they released through 2021, such as pop/R&B track “Man On the Side” and Graceland-inspired “Last Night,” pushed the boundaries of their previous catalog.\n\nIn March of 2023 the three Currys were joined by Sebastian Green (drums), Sam Whedon (guitar), and Alex Rees (keys) to begin production on their fourth studio album. Keepers, released in October 2023, represents another step in the band’s evolution, pairing the lush, three-part harmony that marks any Currys project with a more guitar-driven, indie pop aesthetic. The album pays homage to the band’s influences, with tracks evoking Sgt. Pepper’s, Jason Isbell, even dreamy pop-punk.

It is the brainchild of Atlanta-raised sisters Leah Song and Chloe Smith, rooted in the traditional folk music of their family, storytelling, songcathing, grassroots activism, lyrical prowess, and a multi-instrumental tapestry of their melodic ensemble. The band’s unique sound is shaped by Leah and Chloe’s soulful vocals, simple instrumentation, and seamless harmonies, unique to siblings raised in folk traditions. They are joined by a host of talented musicians who bring their own cultural influences, enriching the blend of folk, world, and urban music that defines the smooth sound of Rising Appalachia. Featuring full-time members David Brown (upright bass, baritone guitar), Duncan Wickle (fiddle, cello), and Biko Casini (drums and world percussion), plus a host of special guests, expect to be swooned into a tapestry of silky sounds. Their event this year at Word of South is co-sponsored by Opening Nights at Florida State University.\n\nThe Road to Now Podcast\n\nOne afternoon in 2006, Bob Crawford and Ben Sawyer sat down in a Detroit coffee shop to talk history. Their discussion ended when Bob had to leave to play a show with his band, The Avett Brothers, but the conversation never stopped. In the years that followed, Bob’s band became one of the most celebrated musical groups in the country, and Ben went from graduate student to a professional historian. In 2016, their roads converged again, this time in the basement of Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena, where they recorded the first episode of The Road to Now.\n\nSince then, Bob and Ben have spoken with some of today’s great thinkers – from award-winning historians to entertainment legends to prominent politicians – to learn more about how the past shapes the present. They’ve recorded 300 episodes, joined the lineup on SiriusXM’s POTUS 124, and built an incredible base of listeners. They’ll be taping a show at this year’s Word of South, where they’ll be joined by the author and political commentator Jonah Goldberg.

They began to get popular and expended to local clubs in Jacksonville and Orange Park.

For country-soul singer-songwriter Leon Timbo, music is used as a form of growth and healing. Growing up the son of two pastors in Jacksonville, Florida, music was integrated into his life from the very start, as a way to communicate spiritual experience. At sixteen, Timbo began singing and by age twenty, he began playing the guitar and performing in a serious way, inspired by artists Bill Withers, James Taylor and Tim Miner. Timbo’s country sound incorporates equal measures of vintage soul, gospel, folk, R&B and even modern blues making for a unique experience that some have described as ‘transparent soul.’ Timbo is currently on the road supporting his new music and has just finished touring with 2x-Grammy Award-winning bassist, Marcus Miller, during his residency with Blue Note New York, which included two sold-out shows.

As he began releasing singles in advance of his full-length debut, Black Banjo, Wellington continued to garner attention, leading banjo workshops at the prestigious Merlefest and Gray Fox festivals; performing on the IBMA’s 2020 World of Bluegrass Main Stage and acting as host for the Momentum Awards ceremony; gaining coverage in publications like No Depression, The Bluegrass Situation and Folk Alley; and appearing on David Holt’s PBS NC series, being interviewed by Rhiannon Giddens for a BBC documentary series and by W. Kamau Bell for his CNN series, United Shades of America.

If bluegrass is about spotlighting virtuosos, here’s a new one people will be checking in on for some time to come.”\n\nBill Wharton\n\nThe Sauce Boss is a powerhouse entertainer, mixing his Bluesy slide guitar and soulful voice into an unforgettable high-energy show. His very own hot sauce spices up a big pot of gumbo while he spices up the show with his own original Blues. He has served hundreds of thousands of people for free at his legendary live shows. Sauce Boss mixes media like cornbread in his performance. Hot sauce, blues, chicken, funk, onions and okra, heartfelt songs, peppers and soul, seafood and slide guitar, all go into the gumbo. The aroma wafts through the place. The Sauce Boss stirs up the crowd. The crowd stirs up the pot. It’s a soul-shouting picnic of Rock and Roll brotherhood, and at the end of the show, everyone eats.\n\nBill Wharton, AKA Sauce Boss, is the guy Jimmy Buffett sang about in his song “I Will Play for Gumbo.” Wharton’s anthem, “Let the Big Dog Eat” is included on Buffett’s “Late Night Menu at the Margaritaville Cafe” album. Albert Castiglia released his cover of the tune, and it hit #1 on blues charts. “Let the Big Dog Eat” has also appeared in the movies “Something Wild” (Jonathan Demme), and the Rock Doc, “Jimmy Carter Rock and Roll President.” This tune and sixteen other works in the documentary earned Wharton “‘Best Original Score” from the Los Angeles Film Awards.\n\nJim White\n\nJim White gets around. When he’s not releasing his own critically acclaimed solo albums, he splits time producing records for other songwriters, exhibiting his visual art in galleries and museums across the U.S. and Europe and publishing award winning fiction.\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, the bizarrely titled “Waffles, Triangles & Jesus,” is a mind-bending joy ride of sonic influences featuring a bevy of his hometown Athens’ roots musicians, plus west coast indie darlings Dead Rock West, and rock and roll maverick Holly Golightly.\n\nPrior to “Waffles, Triangles & Jesus,” White released five eclectic, totally uncatagorizable albums plus another six even stranger side projects. Numerous songs from his back catalog have appeared both in film and television, with his Primus-esque Word-Mule being featured in Breaking Bad, and more recently his cautionary rocker Crash Into The Sun appearing in Ray McKinnon’s highly praised Sundance Channel series Rectify. Jim will be appearing on Saturday at Word of South with the musician/artist Abe Partridge and writer Tad Bartlett, and again on Sunday with Tallahassee’s Mark Hinson to discuss Jim’s new memoir, Incidental Contact.\n\n911\n\nMeet 911, a Tallahassee based band that has established itself as one of North Florida’s most unique music groups, performing original music, mostly written by award winning singer-songwriter Drew Tillman, then “evolved” into the unique songs performed as only 911 can. 911 released 2 albums, a live album, “Live at Bullwinkle’s” recorded and engineered by Fred Chester and a studio album recorded and engineered by Perry Nelson, produced by 911 and John Kurzweg. Besides the original music and recordings, 911 also performs unique renditions of songs by classic rock and folk icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, John Hyatt, John Prine, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Tom Petty, and countless others.\n\n911 is simple: Drew Tillman, acoustic guitar and vocals; Perry Nelson, drums and vocals; Richard Tengstedt, bass; and Steve Taff, electric guitar.

Country music has been made by and loved by Black people since it’s conception. For just as long, Black people have been overlooked and disregarded in the genre by fans and executives. Black Opry wants to change that. They invite you to discover, support and enjoy the Black artists that make magic in this space. One of the most valuable aspects of country music is its versatility and diversity in sound. Country, blues, folk, and Americana music often overlap or weave together- these artists explore all of those sounds and intersections. The Black Opry Revue showcases the diversity in sound and stories that Black artists offer to these genres. Black Opry artists Leon Timbo and Ally Free are participating in this year’s Word of South, in solo shows Saturday and then a combined show Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Blind Boys of Alabama are recognized worldwide as living legends of gospel music. Celebrated by The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and The Recording Academy/GRAMMYs with Lifetime Achievement Awards, inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and winners of five GRAMMY® Awards, they have attained the highest levels of achievement in a career that spans over 70 years. The Blind Boys are known for crossing multiple musical boundaries with their remarkable interpretations of everything from traditional gospel favorites to contemporary spiritual material by songwriters such as Eric Clapton, Prince and Tom Waits. They have appeared on recordings with many artists, including Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Aaron Neville, Susan Tedeschi, Ben Harper, Patty Griffin and Taj Mahal. Recently, the group’s decades-long mission of spreading light and love has taken on even deeper context, as they’ve reckoned with the loss of two of their own, Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore, both longtime members of the Blind Boys tight-knit family. The new album ‘Echoes Of The South’ is released in their honor – as well as for the group’s recently-retired leader Jimmy Carter – and keeps the Blind Boys’ long-held mission statement at its core: “As long as everybody gives all that they have to give and we sing songs that touch the heart, we’ll live on forever.” The Blind Boys of Alabama will perform a musical set at Word of South and also discuss their new book, Spirit of the Century, written with Preston Lauterbach.\n\nWilli Carlisle is a poet and a folk singer for the people, but his extraordinary gift for turning a phrase isn’t about high falutin’ pontificatin’; it’s about looking out for one another and connecting through our shared human condition. Born and raised on the Midwestern plains, Carlisle is a product of the punk to folk music pipeline that’s long fueled frustrated young men looking to resist. After falling for the rich ballads and tunes of the Ozarks, where he now lives, he began examining the full spectrum of American musical history. This insatiable stylistic diversity is obvious in his wildly raucous live performances, where songs range from sardonic trucker-ballads like “Vanlife” to the heartbreaking queer waltz “Life on the Fence,” to an existential talkin’ blues about a panic attack in Walmart’s aisle five. With guitar, fiddle, button-box, banjo, harmonicas, rhythm-bones, and Willi’s booming baritone, this is bonafide populist folk music in the tradition of cowboys, frontier fiddlers, and tall-tale tellers. Carlisle recognizes that the only thing holding us back from greatness is each other. With a quick wit and big sing-alongs, these folksongs bring us a step closer to breaking down our divides.\n\nKelsey Barnard Clark is a born and raised Gulf Southerner from Dothan, Alabama.

Since his first major hit “(I Wanna) Testify,” George Clinton made his mark in the music world for his psychedelic rock and funk band-format, with eccentric costumes and themes inspired by ’60s acid culture and science fiction. Clinton took Funk to new heights by blending the musical elements of Jazz, Rock, Pop, Classical and even Gospel into his productions, eventually developing a unique style called “Pfunk.” He’ll be appearing at Word of South as part of a musical retrospective of his work, seen though the eyes of his longtime keyboardist, Danny Bedrosian.\n\nBrought together by family ties and a shared appreciation for folk, rock, and roots music, The Currys are an Americana trio featuring brothers Jimmy and Tommy and cousin Galen Curry. Like many family groups, their songs are anchored by the sort of elastic, entwined harmonies that only seem to exist among kin. On their second record, West of Here, their songwriting chops match those interlocking voices, with all three members contributing songs to an album that deals with the constant search for home. Following their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys took the opportunity to explore different avenues of creativity. In 2020 the trio launched a podcast, This Side of the Mic, to showcase songs and share some laughs and insights. The band leveraged their down-time into writing and demoing dozens of new tracks, polishing their production chops and collaborating with fellow creators to expand their sound. The singles they released through 2021, such as pop/R&B track “Man On the Side” and Graceland-inspired “Last Night,” pushed the boundaries of their previous catalog.\n\nIn March of 2023 the three Currys were joined by Sebastian Green (drums), Sam Whedon (guitar), and Alex Rees (keys) to begin production on their fourth studio album. Keepers, released in October 2023, represents another step in the band’s evolution, pairing the lush, three-part harmony that marks any Currys project with a more guitar-driven, indie pop aesthetic. The album pays homage to the band’s influences, with tracks evoking Sgt. Pepper’s, Jason Isbell, even dreamy pop-punk. Keepers is an honest next step for a group with an appetite for exploration and a long road ahead.\n\nThe Currys will be appearing at this year’s Word of South with the all-female group The Krickets.\n\nAs a D.C. native, Demp has spent the majority of his life in Tallahassee establishing strong roots and instilling positive impressions in the community.
