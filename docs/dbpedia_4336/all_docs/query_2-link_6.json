In the two years that followed, Ulbrickson’s squad faced California crews that had vastly improved under the leadership of the former Husky coxswain and assistant coach, Ky Ebright. The results for Ulbrickson were disheartening. However,…",

        "text": "In 1930 there were 8,394 students at the school, almost twice the number in 1920. For coaches Ulbrickson and Bolles, that meant there were twice the number of crew candidates available on campus, and twice the opportunity to find the one or two men that might mean the difference between victory and defeat next spring.\n\nThe weather, disagreeable the first two years of Ulbrickson’s career, was much better in the winter and early spring of 1930. The crews spent plenty of time on the water with the focus no longer on Poughkeepsie, but of beating the Bears on Lake Washington.\n\nOn the day of the race, the freshmen raced first and were expected to lose, but surprised the field by not only winning, but winning decisively – by seven lengths. The JV’s led their race by open water at the mile mark, pushed it to four lengths at two miles, and cruised home eight lengths to the good.\n\nThe varsity race was different. Ebright’s top crew sprung from the gate, leading the Huskies into the mile. At two miles it was still California, but Washington was within a boat length. The last mile was one for the ages; Cal bringing the stroke rate up only to be matched by the Huskies, the crews closing within a deck, then even at 200m to go. At that point the Huskies poured it on in front of the huge partisan crowd, finishing the three mile race five feet in front of the Bears. Ulbrickson, who already had a reputation for not showing emotion, must have cracked a smile at some point that day.\n\nThe sweep on Lake Washington was a burden lifted off of the team. The men practiced hard throughout the spring as Ulbrickson tweaked his line-up. By mid-June all three crews left for Poughkeepsie by way of Madison, Wisconsin. On Lake Mendota, June 16th, the Huskies swept the course by open water in each event, and arrived in New York the favorites to pick up where they had left off in 1926.\n\nOn the 24th, the freshmen lined up in a strong headwind and chop on the Hudson. In a slow race, they finished a disappointing fifth. The junior varsity fared better, but still lost the race to Cornell. The varsity, failing to move in the first mile and taking on water, could do no better than sixth, the worst showing ever for a Washington crew in the IRA. The 1931 Tyee called it “the most disastrous upset in Hudson regatta history.”\n\nMaybe, but maybe not. The conditions were miserable in the race, and like the strong California crew swamping the previous year, this race was more a survival of the fittest in the fittest lane, which Washington was not. But ending such a terrific season – one with such great hope – on such a low note, once again stalled the momentum Ulbrickson was intent on rebuilding. It would rest on his shoulders to guide the team back for the 1931 season.\n\nThe undefeated class of ’37, a dominant and deep freshman squad, became the force by which Ulbrickson would build his varsity in 1935. In fact, for the only known time in Washington history, the varsity that lined up to take on Cal on the Estuary was made up entirely of one class: the sophomores.\n\nBut it came with a cost. The already competitive shellhouse environment was magnified by this development. It did not help that newspaper stories had Ulbrickson grooming this crew for the coming Olympics in 1936. And it made some sense: this was a group of highly talented men, they were young and receptive, and could be developed without risk of graduation.\n\nHowever, the squad was deep. To compound the plan, just days before leaving for the Estuary the competitive junior varsity, a typical cross-section of men (including two more sophomores), defeated the varsity in a four mile trial. That event led Ulbrickson to challenge his young varsity, once arriving in California, to face off again against the JV’s three days prior to the races. For a second time, the JV’s won. A perplexed Ulbrickson ultimately stuck with his sophomore crew for the Cal race, but these two crews were now locked in an internal battle that would not end until the season would close out months later.\n\nThe sophomore varsity rowed a strong race later that week, but trailed the Bears the balance of the three mile course – sometimes by as much as a length – only to storm back in the last 300 meters to win by six feet. The JV’s, as one might expect from the recent intersquad battles, led their race from the outset and won by six lengths, and the freshmen finished the sweep by three lengths.\n\nBy the time the crews arrived in Poughkeepsie, Ulbrickson had swapped the JV’s for the varsity, and for the first time in four years raised the money to take all three crews east. Bolles freshmen started race day by again dominating the field as his crew did in 1934, winning by five lengths over a highly rated east coast contingent. The now all-sophomore JV’s followed up with a victory in the Kennedy Cup over Navy and Cornell. The varsity, however, could not complete the sweep, like 1934 leading into the last mile but being overtaken by California and finishing third behind a closing Cornell.\n\n1935 would mark the second and last time the Long Beach course would hold a 2000m varsity sprint championship after the IRA. Six boats competed in the finals-only race, and California swept ahead at the end to defeat Washington by four seats, with Syracuse, Pennsylvania, UCLA and Wisconsin trailing in that order.\n\nThus Ulbrickson would enter the coming Olympic year with a balance of questions. On the negative side was the fact that for two years now his varsity could not close the deal at the IRA. They had also lost at the sprints in a similar manner – and to California, a perennial competitor at the 2000m distance and winner at the ’28 and ’32 Olympic trials.\n\nOn the positive side was the fact that both the classes of ’37 and ’38 were dominant – he had a young squad with racing experience and victories in the underclass races at the IRA. Further, with the Long Beach competition in 1933 and 1935, he and the crew were learning how to train into the 2000m distance. The outlook was promising, but there was little doubt that to get to the Olympics in 1936, Ulbrickson would have to face and defeat the intellectual master of the 2000m race, Ky Ebright.\n\nBuilding into the Olympic year, Ulbrickson now had ten years of coaching behind him. At his side was his ’26 classmate and friend Tom Bolles, and at his other side was the quiet master, George Pocock. The combined rowing experience – as athletes or coaches – of these three men was unmatched anywhere in the country.\n\nUlbrickson trained the men hard. Gone was the internal animosity of 1935, although there is little doubt that the fevered competition from that year led to better oarsmanship a year later. Outside of the later events of 1936, Bob Moch remembers the intersquad time trials of 1935 as the best racing of his career – the most intense and competitive. By 1936, that intensity was re-channeled into a saying that became the motto of the crew: “LGB”, meaning “Let’s Go to Berlin”, and a second meaning – “Let’s Get Better”.\n\nThe first test for this crew came in April on Lake Washington. The freshmen and JV won their races easily, and the varsity finished the sweep with a three length victory over California. Note: Watch a newsreel of the V8 event here, including a jam packed spectator train running along the now Burke-Gilman trail: Stock Footage – University of Washington beats California in a boat race in Seattle, Washington (no sound). (thank you Bob Koch)\n\nTwo months later all three crews were back in Poughkeepsie. The freshmen and JV’s both defended their titles, but the varsity remained a question. In opposite fashion of the two years before, this time the crew was almost instantly behind, and settled at a stroke rate below 30 – the leading crews moving out to a multiple – at least five – length lead. There the Huskies remained through the balance of the course, methodically stroking a 28, the crews in front, including California and Navy, sitting on them. At a mile and a half, Washington turned on the power like a switch, raised the stroke to 34, and the shell lifted out of the water. “We took off…we just flew by them” says Bob Moch, almost as surprised today as he was decades ago to feel the unleashed power of this crew. The win completed the first ever sweep of the Poughkeepsie by a west coast crew – and was the first ever varsity win for Ulbrickson.\n\nMoch reflects on a practice at night on the Hudson river with this crew prior to that race, a defining moment for the team. The crew had postponed an afternoon time trial on the course because it was so windy and rough, and had gone to a movie instead. On the water that night after it had calmed, he remembers “it was pitch black, the wind calmed down and after the time trial was over, we turned around and headed for the shellhouse…all three crews were together, we started out, just going 26, 27 – just going home – we got so far ahead of the other two crews we couldn’t even hear them … you couldn’t hear anything… you couldn’t hear anything except the oars going in the water…it’d be a ‘zep’ and that’s all you could hear – the oarlock didn’t even rattle on the release.” A shared moment in rowing history that special crews experience – still to this day.\n\nFrom Poughkeepsie the men traveled to Princeton New Jersey for the Olympic trials. On July 5th they met a polished Pennsylvania Club Crew, New York Club Crew, and Ky Ebright’s California crew for the right to represent the country in the Olympics. Ulbrickson’s now practiced strategy of “Keep the stroke down and then mow ’em down in the finishing sprints” was executed to the letter by his team, casting all three crews out for almost a full length while rowing a 34 before reeling them back in one by one. In the final 400 meters, the Huskies walked through the Pennsylvania crew as Hume took the stroke up to a forty, and they won by a length going away. “Hume stroked a perfect race and I think this crew will give a good account of itself in Berlin” said Ulbrickson.\n\nThe men stayed at the New York Athletic Club rowing quarters on Travers Island north of New York – with time for rest and rejuvenation – until departing with the entire Olympic Team for Hamburg aboard the S.S. Manhattan. George Pocock and members of the NYAC helped place the Husky Clipper onto the boat deck of the ship for safe transport to Europe.\n\nOnce in Germany, the team stayed near Lake Grunau, the site of the Olympic competition, at Koepenik. The team worked out twice a day on the lake, and dined at night with all of their competitors in the same mess hall. They also participated in the Opening Ceremonies, marching before Hitler and 120,000 frantic German fans, and attended some of the games.\n\nThe race format was similar to today. Three heats, with the winner advancing to the final, and a repechage (second chance for those not winning a heat), with the three top places of that race also advancing to the final. Washington won their heat against what Ulbrickson and Pocock felt would be the toughest competition, Great Britain, and in the course of doing it set a new world record. Germany and Italy won the other heats; these three crews now had two days of rest before the final.\n\nAnd rest was important for Washington. Both Gordon Adam and Don Hume had contracted an illness earlier in the week. The effort during their prelim only exacerbated the symptoms, particularly Hume’s. On the day of the final race, he was plainly ill – but Ulbrickson had made his decision. Much like Rusty Callow and Dow Walling at Poughkeepsie in1923, the alternative was not spoken that day. Hume would race.\n\nThe six crew final was in the afternoon. Washington was assigned lane six, based on the German officials’ decision to position the slowest qualifiers in the most protected lanes (this was challenged by the Americans to no avail). The slowest qualifier was Germany, the second slowest was Italy. The starter faced into the quartering headwind, and his commands were unheard by the Huskies, who nevertheless got a decent start. Hume brought the stroke down to a 36, and the crew went on cruise for the first 1200 meters.\n\nGermany, Italy, and Britain all moved ahead, with the leader, Germany, at least a length up. Fighting the quartering headwind in lane six, the Huskies began to increase the stroke rate. Finally, with about 500 meters left in the race the lakeshore changed, disrupting the lee in which Germany and Italy were racing. The quartering headwind was now evenly felt, at about the instant Hume and his crew began to sprint. By now we know what happens when this crew would sprint, and the confidence they had in each other; every race in 1936 this crew had fallen behind, only to gain it back. The last 200 meters were a blur, with Hume bringing the stroke rate up to an unheard of 44, the crowd chanting “Deutsch-land, Deutsch-land, Deutsch-land”, and yet it was in that last 200 meters that the United States went from third to first, crossing the line about ten feet in front of Italy, with Germany third.\n\nThe exhausted crew rowed in front of the grandstand, then to the dock, where a wreath was placed over the head of each oarsman and the coxswain. There were no interviews. The men stayed in their quarters that night. The next day they received their medals in the Olympic stadium; after the games were over, they went home various ways, some choosing to travel Europe, others going straight home.\n\nHistorically speaking, the 1936 Washington crew would have been memorable without the Olympic victory. By sweeping the Hudson for the first time, the crew established itself as the deepest to date; with the varsity coming from lengths back in the last half mile, it established itself as one of the strongest.\n\nBut with the almost surreal Olympic victory in pre-war Germany, the crew became legendary. And although the story itself seems to have a life of it’s own – every perspective is different, and the years blur some of the details – the fact remains that this is the first Husky eight-oared crew to complete their season as undefeated National Champions – and – World and Olympic champions. And forever will they hold that honor.\n\nTurning out in the fall for the varsity squad this year were members of three previously undefeated and national champion freshmen classes. The classes of ’37, ’38, and ’39 were all IRA winners, and many now had varsity or junior varsity experience. To classify this year as deep would be an understatement – the entire Olympic champion eight was back except Bob Moch, the coxswain – and there were at least sixteen more men who could likely step into any varsity boat across the country turning out at Montlake in the fall of 1936.\n\nThe race on the Estuary would reflect it. The freshmen, now coached by Bud Raney and Bob Moch after Tom Bolles departed for Harvard, won by three lengths against a highly touted California crew, followed by the JV who won by ten lengths, and then the varsity, who won by another three lengths.\n\nOn to Poughkeepsie, where Ulbrickson did what he had done on the Estuary in 1935: had his crews face off on the river, prior to the race, to see who rowed faster. They ended in a dead heat after four miles, with Jim Ten Eyck, the legendary Syracuse coach remarking to Ulbrickson afterward “Thanks for the trip – since I’ve now seen this year’s race, I can go home now” (1). Regardless of the outcome, Ulbrickson got what he wanted; two crews foaming at the mouth to compete.\n\nOn June 22, the freshmen started the day off with a wire to wire win, to claim a fourth Stewards Cup in a row for Washington. The second varsity – what else could you call it – crushed the old record in their race, winning in 13:44, or over 34 seconds faster than the previous mark.\n\nThe varsity faced a tougher challenge early, but this was the same Don Hume and the same crew behind him as in 1936. Navy shot out of the gate and set the pace for two and a half miles – Washington, Cornell and Syracuse in second. At that point Washington began to creep forward, and at three miles had moved into the lead. By then the race was as much as over, Washington just plowing forward the last mile as the rate went up, crossing comfortably in front by three lengths over Navy, capping a second consecutive sweep of the river.\n\nLike the crew of 1936 (it was, absent the coxswain), this crew could turn it on and off like a switch. The combined crew team was the deepest to date; in fact the depth of the team had been building since 1933, and with a fourth freshman IRA victory in a row, the talent in the squad would not be declining for awhile. And even though there were still three Olympians returning for 1938 – Don Hume, John White, and captain elect, Gordy Adam – the news around the shellhouse was there were five seats open in the varsity for the first time since 1935. For Ulbrickson, it was inevitable. For the oarsmen locked out of the top two boats for the last two years, it was “let the competition begin”.\n\nCalifornia came into Seattle in April of 1939 poised with one of their best crews since the twenties. Ky Ebright, who had seen his varsity crews row in the wake of Washington at the Dual for six straight years, had a deep squad, including the 1938 freshmen IRA champions, and was bent on changing the pattern.\n\nOn the Estuary, the Washington freshmen won their race, but the JV’s lost. In the varsity event the Bears, rowing with skill and the pent up frustration of losing in years past, won by twelve lengths. Subsequently, in a move that was seared into the memory of the Husky athletes and fans at the race, the California varsity then turned around and rowed back to the dock before the Huskies crossed the finish line (1).\n\nThe stunning defeat was a wake-up call for everyone associated with the program. A steaming Ulbrickson came home and began changing line-ups. The crews left for Poughkeepsie in better condition physically and with a different attitude.\n\nThe freshmen began the events by re-capturing the Steward’s Cup by two seconds over a charging Columbia crew. The JV’s fought neck and neck down the three mile course with Syracuse, only to lose by about six feet at the finish, with California trailing. The varsity ended up casting Cal out early in their race, but came rushing back in the last half mile to close within a quarter length at the finish to the same Cal squad that had defeated them by twelve lengths two months earlier, pushing Cal to a course record (18:12) on the Hudson.\n\nThe close defeats in the two upper class races were bitter. But the malaise that had gripped the program following the ’36 and ’37 seasons was gone. Washington left Poughkeepsie with a first and two seconds; more importantly, they left as a vastly improved – and vastly different – group of young men than had began the 1939 season.\n\nVBC member Ted Hokenstad, coxswain of the 1937 National Champion Freshmen team and the 1939 JV cox, joined the service after graduation and – like many of his teammates – was an active member of the U.S. Armed Forces overseas in WWII. A B-17 navigator, Hokenstad flew multiple missions aboard the “Birmingham Blitzkrieg” out of Polebrook, England, including the first Heavy Bomber air raid on mainland Europe by an American squadron on August 17, 1942. The tail-gunner of the Birmingham Blitzkrieg, Sgt. Kent West, was credited with shooting down the first German fighter plane by a U.S. gunner on that initial mission over Rouen, France (a successful attack on a German marshalling yard). As noted in the article, the crew and commanding officers were eager to get back up in the skies for more.\n\nHokenstad and his B-17 team were ultimately transferred to the North African campaign in the fall of 1942, flying missions out of Algeria. On December 26th, 1942, the Birmingham Blitzkrieg was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Biskra, Tunisia and exploded in mid-air, killing the ten-member crew. Ted Hokenstad, along with the other members of his crew, to this day are still listed as “Missing In Action.” Added 8/22; Thank You Lee Corbin"
