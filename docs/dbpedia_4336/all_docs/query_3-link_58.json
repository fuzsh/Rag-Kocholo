        "text": "Welcome to the Linda Ronstadt album by album thread. Since there was a lot of activity in the Linda Ronstadt Appreciation Thread (found here: Linda Ronstadt Appreciation Thread ), I thought it would be fun to do an album by album thread of her entire career. We'll also cover her work with the Stone Poneys and her collaborations with Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Ann Savoy, her recent live album and the official compilations. To keep track of where we are, my avatar will feature the album that's currently being discussed. We'll move on to a new album once a week. Have Fun!\n\nTHE STONE PONEYS - THE STONE PONEYS\n\nReleased: January 30 1967\n\nLabel: Capitol\n\nRecorded: October-November 1966\n\nProduced by: Nik Venet\n\nCurrently available: Yes, 2018 HDCD by Culture Factory\n\nSide 1\n\n1.Sweet Summer Blue And Gold (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (2:18)\n\n2.If I Were You (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (1:58)\n\n3.Just A Little Bit Of Rain (Fred Neil) (2:20)\n\n4.Bicycle Song (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (1:53)\n\n5.Orion (Tom Campbell) (3:20)\n\nSide 2\n\n6.Wild About My Lovin' (Traditional) (3:50)\n\n7.Back Home (Kenny Edwards) (2:00)\n\n8.Meredith (On My Mind) (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (2:10)\n\n9.Train And The River (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (2:18)\n\n10.All The Beautiful Things (Bobby Kimmel/Kenny Edwards) (1:55)\n\n11.2:10 Train (Tom Campbell/Linda Albertano) (3:20)\n\nMusicians:\n\nLinda Ronstadt: Vocals, Finger Cymbals\n\nKenny Edwards: Vocals, Guitar\n\nBobby Kimmel: Vocals, Guitar\n\nJames E. Bond: Bass, Guitar\n\nPete Childs: Guitar\n\nCyrus Faryar: Bouzouki, Guitar\n\nJohn T. Forsha: Guitar\n\nBilly Mundi: Drums\n\nTom Wood: Vocals, Rhythm Guitar\n\nThe Stone Poneys sound a bit like a cross between Peter Paul & Mary and early Fairport Convention on their debut. Acoustic music with very good vocal harmonies and lots of folk influences. When Linda sings just by herself it's already clear she has a very powerful voice. It's no surprise she would soon start on her own, singing harmonies in a folk trio didn't really do her voice justice. Nevertheless, there is some very fine material here: their covers of Fred Neil's \"Just A Little Bit Of Rain\", Tom Campbell's \"Orion\", the folky \"Bicycle Song\".\n\nit was NIK. but lots of folks spelled his name incorrectly. he was a mensch. RIP nik venet\n\nlinda was a belter, back in the day. as a kid i saw her changing her top backstage at the santa monic civic with bonnie raitt. we are both startled, she was drop dead gorgeous heh\n\nshe helped shape my youth ha.\n\nI did not get this first Stone Poneys album until it was reissued after Linda's success with \"Heart Like A Wheel\". While I remember the \"Different Drum\" hit from a bit later, I don't know that I recall ever seeing any of their albums in the stores at the time (though I was about 9 years old when this was released).\n\nAfter hearing it at that time, it was disappointing. Too many Peter, Paul & Mary type harmonies, with only 3 Linda solos, and the only one I really enjoyed was \"Orion\".\n\nThe first 2 Stone Poneys albums are on Spotify if you want to give them a listen. Sadly the 3rd is not.\n\nAlso looking forward to the thread. I have everything through \"Get Closer\" except \"Evergreen Vol. 2.\" I'll spin my copy of \"The Stone Poneys Featuring Linda Ronstadt\" tonight or tomorrow and try to add a useful comment.\n\nShe's been a favorite of mine since high school. I saw her once in concert, in 1977. I recall she wore a Cub Scout uniform, I was on a first date, and our seats were far away in a 12,000+ seat arena. I'm sure it was a great show.\n\nI've never seen this album in the wild. Are there many out there? All I have is the compilation, Different Drummer, mentioned earlier. I'd love to hear more from this period.\n\nShe was a crush during high school, drove my older brother to her concert right after I turned 16. He and his buddy (both well lubricated with Wild Turkey) showed their appreciation by shouting well intended but highly offensive observations at her between songs. She was a sex symbol.\n\nGreat thread. It'll be fascinating to go back and listen to her get command of her voice, as the years roll on. This first album is hard to listen to, as she's\n\nall soprano, on it. She's singing at the very top of her voice with little modulation. Her self-titled record is where she starts pulling it together. The\n\nFred Neil cover, is worth the price of the record.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what happened to Bobby Kimmel, but...\n\nAfter the Stone Poneys, Kenny Edwards went on to form Bryndle with Karla Bonoff, Wendy Waldman and Andrew Gold, though they disbanded releasing only a single from an unreleased album. All of them went on to work with Linda at various times of her career. Andrew and Kenny played in Linda's band for many years -- I think he appeared on virtually all of her \"hit\" albums.\n\nIn the early 90's Bryndle re-formed and they actually released two CDs, that I enjoyed very much at the time.\n\nI was lucky enough to get a sealed copy of this album a little over three years ago. I played it once at that time and didn't remember that it was this good.\n\nI'm a fan of the folk rock kind of sound on this album and love the harmonies. But Linda's voice is the star of the record, even though Linda is only solo on a few songs. I, for one, wouldn't be without this album.\n\nA couple notes about the cover, the '75 reissue back cover is very different, featuring Linda more and pointing out her solo songs (See Discogs images here). Also, being a huge early Fairport Convention fan, I noticed the front cover is similar to their debut album in that there are band members around a similar looking Tiffany style lamp (See Discogs images here).\n\nTHE STONE PONEYS - EVERGREEN VOL. 2\n\nReleased: June 1967\n\nLabel: Capitol\n\nRecorded: Spring 1967\n\nProduced by: Nik Venet\n\nCurrently available: Yes, 2016 SHM CD from Japan. Mp3 download is a lot cheaper.\n\nSide 1\n\n1.December Dream (John Braheny) (3:30)\n\n2.Song About The Rain (Steve Gillette) (2:40)\n\n3.Autumn Afternoon (Kenny Edwards/Bobby Kimmel) (2:35)\n\n4.I've Got To Know (Pamela Polland) (2:38)\n\n5.Evergreen (Part One) (Kenny Edwards/Bobby Kimmel) (3:10)\n\n6.Evergreen (Part Two) (Kenny Edwards/Bobby Kimmel) (3:33)\n\nSide 2\n\n7.Different Drum (Mike Nesmith) (2:45)\n\n8.Driftin' (Kenny Edwards/Bobby Kimmel) (2:30)\n\n9.One For One (Al Silverman/Austin DeLone) (2:50)\n\n10.Back On The Street Again (Steve Gillette) (1:50)\n\n11.Toys In Time (Kenny Edwards/Bobby Kimmel) (1:50)\n\nMusicians:\n\nLinda Ronstadt: Vocals, Finger Cymbals\n\nKenny Edwards: Guitar, Sitar, Vocals\n\nBobby Kimmel: Guitar, Vocals\n\nJames E. Bond: Bass\n\nDennis Budmir: Guitar\n\nPete Childs: Guitar\n\nCyrus Faryar: Acoustic Guitar, Bouzouki\n\nJohn T Forscha: Guitar\n\nSteve Gillette: Guitar, Harmony Vocals\n\nJim Gordon: Drums\n\nBernie Leadon: Guitar on \"Different Drum\"\n\nBilly Mundi: Drums\n\nJoe Osborn: Electric Bass\n\nDon Randi: Harpsichord\n\nSidney Sharp: Violin, Concertmaster\n\nNorman Botnick: Strings\n\nWilliam Durasch: Strings\n\nJesse Ehrlich: String\n\nHarry Hyams: Strings\n\nWilliam Kurasch: Strings\n\nLeonard Malarsky: Strings\n\nStanley Plummer: Strings\n\nRobert Sushel: Strings\n\nSince I'm not expecting a lot of discussion about the early Stone Poneys albums, I've decided to move on a little faster than just 1 album every week until we've reached her solo career.\n\nA very logical follow up to the band's debut and to my ears an improvement. More Linda vocals was a smart move, since her vocals weren't really that suited to harmony singing. With more covers instead of self written songs, the quality of the material is also higher. Highlights are the pop of \"Different Drum\", the folky \"Back On The Street Again\" and the ballad \"Song About The Rain\"."
