        "text": "Maybe these musicians were inspired by Tucson's vibe, or maybe they needed a word that rhymed with \"boots on.\" Either way, these 21 songs that have the word \"Tucson\" in them are good enough to make a cactus sway.\n\nNote: After a few years and a couple of dozen emails from Tucson music lovers, we've added a few new tunes to the list. Still don't see that Tucson song you love? Email us at thisistucson@tucson.com with your suggestion.\n\nTucson Train — Bruce Springsteen\n\nLyric: \"Seemed all of our love was in vain/My baby's coming in on the Tucson train\"\n\nRelease year: 2019\n\nFun fact: According to an Arizona Daily Star article by Cathalena E. Burch, the last time Springsteen performed in Tucson was in 1978 to a sold out crowd at the Tucson Convention Center. Read more about the song here.\n\nJack Straw — The Grateful Dead\n\nLyric: \"Half a mile from Tucson/By the morning light/One man gone and another to go/My old buddy you're moving much too slow\"\n\nRelease date: 1972\n\nFun fact: This was the most-requested song to add to our list after we didn't include it the first time. Some people were nice about it (and some people were mean) but good to know we got some Tucson Deadheads out there 💀. KXCI also has a show called Dead Air every Sunday from 6-9 p.m., where you can listen to jam bands and the Grateful Dead.\n\nWe Got Cactus — Al Perry\n\nLyric: \"Welcome to my home, no fear of pneumonia/This is paradise, in Tucson, Arizona.\"\n\nRelease year: 2004\n\nFun Fact: This song is a cover that was originally written and performed by the Tucson punk band Blood Spasm in 1985. Read about the origins of the song here.\n\nVienna Calling — Falco\n\nLyric: Womit spielen kleine Mädchen heute, hier und dort und da / Ob in Tucson, Arizona; Toronto, Canada? (Translation: What do little girls play today, here and there, in Tucson, Arizona; Toronto, Canada?)\n\nRelease year: 1985\n\nFun fact: Austrian singer Falco is better know for his other 1985 hit, \"Rock Me Amadeus.\"\n\nMel Tillis — Send Me Down to Tucson\n\nLyric: \"No one wants to go down to Tucson in the summer/So this time the boss chose me/I've been sort of restless yes he thought it might help if/I got away from my wife and family\n\nRelease year: 1979\n\nFun fact: You want a good old fashioned cheating country song? Be sure to hit play on this one.\n\nOld Black Dawning — Frank Black (a.k.a. Black Francis)\n\nLyric: I'm always happy to/Go down to old Tucson/After you had your fun/It's time to move on\n\nRelease year: 2007\n\nFun Fact: Francis is the frontman of the alternative band the Pixies.\n\nWillin' — Linda Ronstadt\n\nLyric: \"And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah/Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made\"\n\nRelease year: 1974\n\nFun fact: The song was originally written and performed by the American rock band, Little Feat. Ronstadt is a native to Tucson, so it's seems pretty fitting she has her own rendition of the song.\n\nCheck out this Ronstadt throwback from the Arizona Daily Star's archive.\n\nHere's what her band, The Stone Poneys, has to say about their sound in 1966: \"It's folk music because we're folks and it's our music.\"\n\nGet Back — The Beatles\n\nLyric: \"Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona For some California grass\"\n\nRelease date: April 11, 1969\n\nFun fact: When released as a single as part of the Beatles' final studio album \"Let it Be,\" the song hit No. 1 in the U.S. and international charts.\n\nBonus fact: Paul McCartney's first wife, Linda, studied at the University of Arizona in Fine Arts. They married in 1969, the same year \"Get Back\" was recorded. The couple bought ranch property in Tucson in 1979 and lived here for several years until Linda's death in 1998.\n\nCloser — The Chainsmokers (feat. Hasley)\n\nLyric: \"Stay, and play that Blink-182 song/That we beat to death in Tucson, OK\"\n\nRelease date: July 29, 2016\n\nFun fact: The Chainsmokers performed to a sold-out crowd at the Rialto Theatre last time they were in town in 2015. This song was inspired by Blink-182's 2004 hit \"Miss You.\" We may have just solved the mystery about what Blink song was overplayed on their tour bus in Tucson.\n\nMust Be Losing My Mind — Brett Dennen\n\nLyric: \"Burned out in the lawn in Tucson, Arizona/With the scavengers on 4th Avenue\"\n\nRelease year: 2011\n\nFun Fact: Brett Dennen is an American pop/folk singer who loads up a lot of modern day Tucson references in this song.\n\nWouldn't Wanna Be Ya — Toby Keith\n\nLyric: \"I made it out to Tucson where I turned my truck around/I started barreling down that highway boy, back to that Texas town\"\n\nRelease year: 2007\n\nFun Fact: The singer had some Tucson roots momentarily when a \"Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill\" Opened in the Tucson Mall on New Year's Eve, 2012. He then turned \"back to that Texas town\" when the restaurant closed about 14 months later.\n\nRoad to Gila Bend — Los Lobos\n\nLyric: \"Got to Tucson in the dark/Keeping an eye out for the law/Five hundred miles or more from a broken heart\"\n\nRelease year: 2006\n\nFun fact: Can't get enough Los Lobos?
