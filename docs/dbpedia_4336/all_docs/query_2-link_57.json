        "text": "Ollie Watkins was an integral player in England's Euros 2024 appearance.\n\nThe 28-year-old scored a last-minute goal in their game against the Netherlands, bringing his team to a 2-1 advantage (the other goal scored by one Harry Kane) and sending them into their second successive European Championship final. What a feat!\n\nToday's top videos\n\nNot only were there tens of thousands of fans cheering England on to succeed, but Ollie's girlfriend Ellie Alderson was in the stands of Dortmund's BVB Stadion, spurring him on to succeed.\n\nWho is Ollie's girlfriend Ellie Alderson?\n\nBorn on June 3, 1996, Ellie Anderson is a 28-year-old mum-of-two from Berkshire.\n\nEllie, who holds a diploma in interior design, has a twin named Sofia. She boasts an Instagram following of 28.1k.\n\nShe has been in a relationship with Ollie for six years, and the couple live together in Birmingham with their kids.\n\nTheir relationship\n\nIt's unknown how Ollie and Ellie first met as they keep details of their personal life private.\n\nThat being said, the loved-up couple frequently share snaps of themselves and their children on social media.\n\nTheir family\n\nEllie and Ollie welcomed their first child together, a baby girl whom they named Amara May, in September 2021.\n\nLess than two years later, Amara became a big sister as her mum and dad welcomed a baby boy to the world. 'Our sweet boy, Marley Watkins,' Ellie wrote alongside a series of snaps of their newborn at the time.\n\nAmara and Marley are their daddy's biggest supporters, regularly attending his Aston Villa matches with their mum.\n\nTheir engagement\n\nFollowing England's Euros 2024 defeat, Ollie popped the question to his longtime love Ellie.\n\nThe couple had been enjoying a romantic holiday in Italy's Lago Di Como when the footballer went out of his way to organise a lavish all-white set-up looking out at the lake to get down on bended knee.\n\nSharing photos from the proposal, Ollie wrote: 'Future wifey!! It was only right. 21.07.24,' and Ellie replied: 'Love you soo much.'"
