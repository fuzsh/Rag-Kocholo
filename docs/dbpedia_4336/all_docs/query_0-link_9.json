        "text": "BIOGRAPHIES, Greenbrier County, WV - \"A\"\n\nTHE ALDERSON FAMILY.\n\nAmong the prominent and distinguished families of Monroe County few can lay claim to a more honorable lineage or to a more splendid record for public-spirited citizenship than that bearing the name of Alderson. This family traces back to John Alderson, the progenitor in the United States of the Aldersons of West Virginia, who came from Yorkshire, England, and first located in New Jersey, where he married Mary Curtis, and for a time was engaged in agricultural pursuits. Later he entered the ministry of the Baptist Church, and followed that calling during the remainder of his life, in Pennsylvania and Maryland. He became the father of three sons and one daughter.\n\nOne of the sons of the immigrant John Alderson, \"Elder John\" Alderson, became historically connected with the early history of the southeastern part of what is now West Virginia. As a Baptist missionary he located in the immediate vicinity of Alderson, West Virginia, in 1774, and until the establishment of a church in 1781 visited around in the sparsely settled country, preaching and exhorting and bringing the Word to the pioneers. He became widely known and universally beloved, and continued as pastor of the church which he had founded until his death. He was born March 5, 1738, and October 31, 1759, married Mary Elizabeth Carroll, their children being: Alice, George, Mary, John (I), Joseph, Thomas, Margaret, Jane and John. These children of \"Elder John\" Anderson were fine characters and left honored names for their descendants, many of whom yet live in this section. George married a Miss Osborne, Joseph married \"Polly\" Newman, Margaret married Thomas Smithson, Jane married William McClung and John was married three times, first to Jane Walker, who bore him six children, next to Nancy (Robinson) Mays, who also bore him six children, and next to Millie Milholland. He died in 1853.\n\nJohn Alderson, the youngest son of \"Elder John,\" was a farmer of Monroe County, and owned the Alderson ferry across the Greenbrier River. His home was the present site of the hotel. Of all his children but one now survives, he being familiarly known as \"Uncle\" George Alderson, and he is the \"youngest son of the youngest son.\" \"Uncle\" George Alderson was born November 13, 1833, \"the night the stars fell.\" He grew up in the immediate vicinity of his birthplace and makes his home on a part of the original farm. Under the legislative grant of 1789 the Alderson ferry was established, but as time passed and others came to live here the name was dropped and ever since the place has been known as Alderson. The original farm of John Alderson was over 200 acres, but the present farm of his son George consists of 175 acres. George Alderson has always followed farming. He enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862, and during the greater part of his service acted as orderly for Generals Loring and Echols. He was elected a justice of the peace at the first election after the close of the war between the states, when the Confederates were again given the full rights of citizenship, and in 1885 was elected a representative to the last Legislature that was held at Wheeling, during which he was the author of the amendment to the penal law which provided a penalty of from one to two years' confinement for breaking into outbuildings with intent to steal. He has been twice married, first to Mary Jane Hines, who bore him three children: Charles O., who died in infancy; Emma Cornelia, connected with the Alderson Baptist Academy ever since its organization; and Ida, now deceased. Mr. Alderson's second marriage was with Virginia Stevens, and to this union there were born six children: John C., the only survivor: Bernard C.; William; George, who served two terms in the State Legislature; Virginia, who died as the wife of Charles B. Rowe, and Coleman C. Mr. Alderson is a democrat in politics and a Mason fraternally, and since its organization has been a director in the First National Bank. For forty years he was superintendent of the Baptist Sunday School, and for a longer period has been a deacon in the church.\n\nOn November 13, 1867, Mr. Alderson married Virginia M. Stevens, and their wedded life has covered a period of more than fifty-four years. On their Golden Wedding Anniversary, November 13, 1917, which was also Mr. Alderson's eighty-fourth birthday, eighty-five guests gathered at the pleasant home on Sunset Hill, this being the first Golden Wedding celebration ever held in the community. Mrs. Alderson is a daughter of J. W. P. Stevens, of English ancestry, and a native of New Hampshire, who came to Alderson as a young man and married Miriam Gwinn. For nearly a half a century he was a teacher in the surrounding schools. He was a fine penman, and because of his splendid education and beautiful penmanship more of the deeds and official papers, as well as family records, are in his handwriting than all others combined.\n\nGeorge Alderson, another son of Elder John Alderson, moved to Kanawha County, where he was engaged in salt production, and while his brothers were interested in the same business with him they maintained their homes in Greenbrier County. He became prominent in Kanawha County, and served as sheriff, and Alderson Street, Charleston, is named in his honor. George Alderson was a man of rugged type and of unusual force. He was elected and served several terms in the Virginia Legislature, where his practical knowledge was invaluable. Many interesting anecdotes are related of this man. It is told that he selected the largest corn cob that he could find, converted it into a pipe, and when his confreres remarked upon its size, replied that it was \"merely a'nubbin.' \"\n\nJoseph Alderson, son of Elder John Alderson, was elected sheriff of Monroe County, and after moving to Greenbrier County was a justice of the peace and a member of the Virginia State Legislature. He married \"Polly\" Newman, a daughter of Jonathan Newman a survivor of the Revolutionary battle of Guilford, and they had a large family. One son, George, known as \"Colonel George,\" lived at DeKalb in Fayette County, and was married twice, first to Jeanette McCleary and then to Eliza Davis, by both of whom he had children, many of whose descendants are now living at and around Alderson, which town was named in honor of the family. John Marshall Alderson, the oldest child of the first marriage, was deputy sheriff and sheriff of Greenbrier County for years, and died in 1861. His wife was Cornelia Coleman, of Amherst County, Virginia, and they had nine children, seven growing to maturity: Sallie, who became the wife of Capt. John G. Lobban; James Powell; Joseph N.; Millie J., who was Mrs. Andrew J. Riffe; John M.; Cornelia M., who became Mrs. Taylor Mann; and Lucy, who became Mrs. E. R. Lewis. The mother of these children died in 1880. Of this family Joseph N. Alderson married Lillie Putney, of Kanawha County, and was engaged in railroad work as agent during his early manhood, later followed merchandising at Alderson, and served as post master during President Cleveland's first administration; also being otherwise prominent in localaffairs. He and his wife had four children: Marshall P., who died in infancy; James M., who also died as an infant; Alethea T.; and Joseph N. The last named married Miss Frances Richardson, of Huntington, West Virginia, and they have two children: Frances and Alice Todd. Mr. Alderson was engaged in banking at Alderson until appointed postmaster in 1914, his term expiring in 1923, he being the third of his name to officiate as such. He is a past master of Alderson Lodge, A. F. and A. M., and is a Presbyterian in religious faith.\n\nJohn M. Alderson, the only surviving child of John Marshall and Cornelia (Coleman) Alderson, was born at what was then Palestine, Greenbrier County, West Virginia, February 11, 1854, and received only limited educational advantages. He left home at the age of nineteen years to become a telegraph operator and railroad agent, and in 1884 embarked in mercantile pursuits at Alderson, in which he has been engaged to the present. At one time he was the owner of a large number of branch stores, but at the present confines his attention to three establishments. During President Cleveland's second administration he served as postmaster, but he has never cared particularly for public office, preferring merely to exercise his right of franchise as an American citizen. He has been a supporter of democratic principles, in religion is a Baptist, and fraternally is affiliated with the Master Masons.\n\nOn February 16, 1893, Mr. Alderson married Miss Florence Hedges, of Mount Sterling, Ohio, and to this union there have been born five children: Gladys Cless, who is unmarried and resides with her parents; Cornelia Coleman, who is the wife of H. L. Smith; Florence Marshall, who is the wife of O. B. Kirby; John Marshall, a member of the Students Reserve Corps at the University of Richmond during the World war, now in business with his father, married Miss Elizabeth Creigh; and Julia Hodges, with her parents.\n\nIt goes without saying that the descendants of Elder John Alderson are, for the most part, Baptists in religion, although late generations have accepted other faiths. So far as is known they have been democrats. None have been known to have violated the laws of the land; and, on the other hand, many have held important official positions with credit. On the whole, the Alderson's are recognized as among the solid and substantial people of West Virginia, a credit to the state and nation.\n\nThe History of West Virginia, Old and New\n\nPublished 1923, The American Historical Society, Inc.,\n\nChicago and New York, Volume III, pgs. 618-19\n\nSubmitted by Valerie Crook.\n\nJOSEPH N. ALDERSON, JR.\n\nThe subject of this sketch, the present postmaster of Alderson, is the seventh in descent from John Alderson, the founder of the town of Alderson. Joseph N. Alderson, Sr., a well known merchant of the place, was the son of John Marshall and Cornelia (Coleman) Alderson. He was born February 20, 1848, and died August 10, 1901. His wife was Lillie Putney, daughter of Richard Putney, of Kanawha county, whom he married October 20, 1875. Their children were: James Moseley (deceased) ; Joseph N. Alderson, Jr., Aletha Todd Alderson, and Marshall Putney Alderson (deceased).\n\nJoseph N. Alderson, Jr., was born June 8, 1887, and was educated and reared in the town of his birth. On February 14, 1911, he married Miss Frances Richardson, daughter of William Richardson, of Huntington. To this union were born Frances Aletha and Alice Todd Alderson.\n\nMr. Alderson has been a successful merchant and business man in Alderson and was connected with the First National Bank of that place for several years. He has been postmaster of Alderson since February 19, 1914.\n\nHistory of Greenbrier County\n\nJ. R.

One family came from Pennsylvania and settled on the James river, near what is now called Balcony Falls, in Rockbridge county. Three brothers-Mathew, William and Thomas started from their settlement to the Greenbrier valley. Thomas was killed while hunting during the trip and Mathew and William settled at Fort Union, now Lewisburg. Mathew was a captain in the army and in a march of about nineteen days through the virgin forest guided Gen. Andrew Lewis' army from Fort Union to Point Pleasant, leaving Fort Union September 19, 1774, and fought the battle of Point Pleasant October 10, 1774.\n\nWilliam Arbuckle, brother of Capt. Mathew Arbuckle, was with the army at Point Pleasant and afterward, about 1796 or 1797, moved, and settled in Putnam county, on the Kanawha river. Capt. Mathew Arbuckle remained in comand of the fort at Point Pleasant until after 1777. In 1781, as he was returning from Richmond on a commission for the army, he was killed on Jackson river, in Bath county, June 27, 1787, in a storm, by the falling of a tree, under which he was caught. He was the father of a large family of sons and daughters, and many of his posterity are now valued citizens of the Greenbrier valley. One of his sons, Cen. Mathew Arbuckle, was with army in the Arkansas - many years and until his death, and was said to have had great influence among the Indians in his time. His name is revered in that country to this day. His brother, William, who settled in Putnam county, reared a large family of daughters, from whom descended many of the prominent families of Putnam and Mason counties. The only family of the name there now is that of James H. Arbuckle, of Putnam county, but he is a great-grandson of Capt. Mathew Arbuckle.\n\nJohn William Arbuckle, a prominent lawyer of Lewisburg, W. Va., for many years mayor of the town, and an able, efficient executive officer. As a member of the West Virginia State Senate was chairman of the judiciary committee. He has been honorably and effectively identified with the best interests of State and church. Twice married, first to Mary Tate Finley, of Augusta county, Virginia, in October, 1878, to which union four children were born: Finley M. Arbuckle, one of the leading and prosperous young business men of the town. Chosen justice of the peace at the age of twenty-one, has been successively elected to succeed himself.

On the wagon sat a log cabin, with some coon skins tacked on the walls, and a barrel of hard cider just inside the door, which an attendant was serving out to the public. Mr. Argabrite was standing on the streets of Lewisburg, an indignant spectator. Somebody asked him what he thought of it; he vehemently replied: \"What dam foolishness, what damn foolishness, and so agra-provoking!\"\n\nColonel John Argabrite, a son of Jacob Argabrite, the Revolutionary soldier mentioned above, was born February 17, 1797, and died December 10, 1884. He married Mary, daughter of Jacob Hockman, who lived in the old stone house that stands on Muddy creek, which he had built as a home. It is now owned by a descendant, Mrs. Mary Gwinn.\n\nColonel Argabrite was not in favor of secession, so he became eligible to sit on the Board of Supervisors of Blue Sulphur district. A story is told of him about this time. It was true, he said, that he was a Union man, opposed to secession, and always had been, but was always glad when our boys whipped. He was a prominent man in the county, and took part in its politics, serving in several positions of public trust, and having the name of filling such offices to the perfect satisfaction of the people.

His youth was spent on the ancestral farm, which lies near Cline's Bridge, in Bhie Sulphur district, where he lived with his widowed mother and his brothers, John Riley and Jacob L. He came of sturdy, virile and brainy stock. In his veins courses the blood of Argabrites, Jarretts, Hockmans and Gwinns. In 1869 he went to Missouri and was brought in contact with the spirit of the West. When he returned from the West he attended Roanoke College and the West Virginia University. In 1871 he went into the newspaper business as a partner with B. F. Harlow, and they published the Greenbrier Independent for many years until in 1880, B. F. Harlow sold his interest to Thomas H. Deimis and the newspaper and publishing business was conducted by Dennis and Argabrite until 1910, when Mr. Argabrite sold his interest to his partner and went to live on his farm, about our mile west of the court house.\n\nDuring the time Mr. Argabrite was engaged as joint editor and publisher of the Independent, his community, together with the entire State and country, went through great changes. Railroads, telephones, phonographs and automobiles, aeroplanes, wireless telegraphy, new methods of reducing metals, the replacing of wood by iron and steel and concrete, the introduction of machinery on the farm and many other new things came on the stage, and into common use. The patriotic situation in his State and the country changed and varied. New ideas, new philosophies, new legislation came on the scene and were adopted or rejected as the growth of the people required. His natural sense and strong mentality served to steer him safe through all these trying times. He was never carried away with \"Issues,\" yet at the same time his mind stayed young and was always open to listen to new ideas and he had a fine factulty of distinguishing the truth from error. His newspaper established a reputation for sound morality and political stability that made it a power for good. He understood his business thoroughly, could set type, write leaders, manage the financial end and do anything needed to make a good, readable sheet, and made the business prosperous. His affiliation was with the Democratic party and he was ever staunch in his allegiance to the principles of that party as he saw them, but was never an unreasoning partisan and often by word and pen pointed out rocks ahead.\n\nIn 1880 he married Mollie M. Miller, a daughter of William G. Miller. To this union three children were born, William Graeme, George Phares and Rose Miller. Since 1910 he has lived on his farm, which is of great fertility, near the town of Lewisburg. Wherever a public question arose, he has been heard from, and, in my humble opinion, he has seen a light many of his neighbors did mot see. He believes in making this world a better place for men and women to live in. He realizes we must live for our children and has backed by earnest effort every step to advance with the growth of the world. He has a vast fund of useful knowledge, well digested.\n\nHistory of Greenbrier County\n\nJ. R.
