        "text": "Alderson History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nScotland\n\nThe generations and branches of the Alderson family share a name that has its roots in the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. The name Alderson comes from the baptismal name Alder. As the naming tradition grew in Europe baptismal names began to be introduced in many countries. Baptismal names were sometimes given in honor of Christian saints and other biblical figures. There are very few Christian countries in Europe that did not adopt surnames from these religious figures. The name Alder meant wise warrior.\n\nAlternatively the name could mean \"dweller by the alder(s)\" from the Old English word \"alor.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Alderson family\n\nThe surname Alderson was first found in London and Middlesex, where the name meant 'son of the old wise warrior'. By the 16th century they had migrated north to Scotland to Haddington in East Lothian where they called themselves Alderston.\n\nIn Cumberland, Alston, the market-town and parish of Alston-Moor was home to some of the family in early times. \"Mining in this district is of some antiquity, several charters having been granted to the miners of 'Alderston' in the 13th century. \" 2\n\n\"Alderson is a name of very frequent occurrence in the Richmond district of the North Riding. John Alderson was sheriff of the city of York in 1709. The name is also established in the adjacent county of Durham.\" 3\n\nThe Alderston variant is frequented in Scotland where the name is \"Perhaps from Alderston near Bellshill in the parish of Bothwell, Lanarkshire. There is also an Alderston in the parish of Haddington, East Lothian, and an Alderstone in the parish of Mid Calder, Midlothian. Peter Alderstoune, presbyter in Glasgow, is mentioned in 1544, and the name is also found in Glasgow at the same period as Alderstoun (1551), Aldirstoune (1552), and Alderstone (1554). James Alderstoune was minister of Kilmaurs from 1637 to 1642.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Alderson family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Alderson research.

Consequently, Anglo-Saxon surnames are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. Changes in Anglo-Saxon names were influenced by the evolution of the English language, as it incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other languages. Although Medieval scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, so it is common to find one person referred to by several different spellings of his surname, even the most literate people varied the spelling of their own names. Variations of the name Alderson include Alders, Alderson, Alderston, Alderstone, Aldirstone and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Alderson family\n\nNotables of the family at this time include\n\nSir Edward Hall Alderson (1787-1857), English judge, the son of Robert Alderson, for many years recorder of Norwich, Yarmouth, and Ipswich.

Unfortunately, the majority of them traveled under extremely harsh conditions: overcrowding on the ships caused the majority of the immigrants to arrive diseased, famished, and destitute from the long journey across the ocean. For those families that arrived safely, modest prosperity was attainable, and many went on to make invaluable contributions to the development of the cultures of the new colonies. Research into the origins of individual families in North America revealed records of the immigration of a number of people bearing the name Alderson or a variant listed above:\n\nAlderson Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nAnn Alderson, who arrived in Virginia in 1650 6\n\nThomas Alderson who settled in Boston Massachusetts in 1679\n\nAlderson Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nJames Alderson, who landed in Virginia in 1705 6\n\nSimon Alderson, who arrived in North Carolina in 1705 6\n\nAlderson Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nThomas Alderson, who landed in New York in 1803 6\n\nJohn Alderson, aged 40, who settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1820\n\nJohn Alderson, who landed in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1832 6\n\nRichard Alderson, who arrived in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1840 6\n\nThomas Alderson, who settled in that same city in 1842\n\n...
