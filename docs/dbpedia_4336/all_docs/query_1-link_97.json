Because African Americans have played an integral and leading role in forming that history, records relevant to African-American life and culture constitute a prominent portion of the department's holdings of nearly 14.5 million items.\n\nThe majority of the collections documented in this guide are plantation records from the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction period. Entries for these collections discuss topics such as slaves as plantation labor, and later, the hiring of freedmen. There are also several twentieth-century collections described that cover topics such as desegregation, bussing, race relations, and civil rights.\n\nThe entries are arranged alphabetically by collection name. Listed after the collection name is the collection number and the date span of the entire collection. The entries describe only the portion of the collection pertaining to African Americans, with complete summary records for collections available through the library's online catalog. The full texts of selected inventories (i.e., folder and box lists) are present on the library's INTERNET server.\n\nThis guide would not be possible without the hard work of a number of staff, both past and present.
