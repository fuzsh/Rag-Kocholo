She often shares pictures with sister Sofia, who also looks amazing in a bikini.\n\nSHE'S THRIFTY\n\nLike most Wags, Ellie lives for travel and often shares her adventures on Instagram, on which she has just over 4,000 followers.\n\nShe's been to Paris, New York, Las Vegas and Barbados recently - often with her footballer boyfriend.\n\nBut, despite her glam lifestyle, Ellie is thrifty.\n\nJust like Aston Villa defender Matt Targett's girlfriend Jasmin Buckle, Ellie likes to flog designer clobber she no longer wears on shopping app Depop.\n\nFrom fancy dresses to jeans and sunglasses, there are bargains to be had.\n\nNot as much as a bargain as Watkins has turned out to be for Villa this season - scoring 12 goals in all competitions this term."
