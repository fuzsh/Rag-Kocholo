        "text": "Overview[]\n\nThrough forty Spenser books, Robert Parker had the opportunity to introduce many dozens of supporting characters. Most appear once, although Parker is fond of bringing back characters, sometimes years later. (And he also tends to use similar character archetypes over and over, which complicates things - but that's a separate issue.) There is nonetheless a core cast of recurring characters in the series - Spenser's primary allies and antagonists. Our goal is to eventually give each of the recurring characters his/her own page.\n\nThis \"master list\" is based on the Spenser books. It's Spenser's universe after all. Several of these characters also appear in the Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall books. For recurring characters unique to the other book series, see Characters: Jesse Stone and Characters: Sunny Randall.\n\nMain/Recurring Characters[]\n\nThe big three:\n\nSpenser.
