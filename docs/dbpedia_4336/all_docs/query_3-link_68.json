        "text": "#46\n\nPure Moods Americana - 12th/15\n\nThe Stone Poneys & Linda Ronstadt - Different Drum\n\n8.150\n\nHighest | 10 x 3 | @KamikazeHeart, @unnameable, @pop3blow2\n\nLowest | 5 | @Aester | 6 | @daninternational\n\nHalfway Mark | #49 (8.275) -- The best it got was #42 after @unnameable's 10 and before the 5 and 6 hit.\n\nReleased | September 1967\n\nN/A #13\n\nSongfacts | Mike Nesmith wrote this song in 1964, two years before he joined the made-for-TV group The Monkees. At the time, he was developing his skills as a folk singer - a far cry from the Hollywood-enhanced shenanigans and high-gloss pop songs The Monkees were known for. In 1965, he met John Herald, guitarist for a bluegrass/folk group called The Greenbriar Boys. They played songs for each other, and Herald loved \"Different Drum.\" He brought it to his group, slowed down the tempo, and released it on the group's 1966 album Better Late Than Never! Linda Ronstadt heard this version and recorded it with her group The Stone Poneys (named after the Charlie Patton song \"Stone Pony Blues\"), which is by far the best-known version of the song.\n\nThe Monkees were given very little control of their musical output, which didn't sit well with Mike Nesmith, who found out after he joined the ensemble that session musicians would be playing on their albums and hired guns would write their songs. Nesmith was a talented performer and songwriter, and he proved it with this tune, which he pitched for The Monkees. He explained in 1971: \"Most of the songs I did write, they didn't want, so on the last few albums I didn't contribute much in the way of material. I took them 'Different Drum' and they said all it needed was a hook. They asked me to change it and told me it was a stiff.\"\n\nA true story of trying to make in the music world:\n\nThe Stone Poneys were a folk trio of Ronstadt, Kenny Edwards and Bobby Kimmel. They released their first album earlier in 1967, and it went nowhere. This song was included on their second album, Evergreen Volume 2, later that year and appeared to be headed toward a similar fate. In dire financial straits, the band was driving to a meeting with their record company when their car broke down on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles. At the gas station where they ended up, they heard this song playing on the radio - it had been added to the playlist at KRLA-AM, a huge station in LA. Suddenly, they had a hit on their hands.\n\nTheir fortunes improved, but the song only took them so far. After one more charting single (\"Up To My Neck In High Muddy Water\" - #93) the band broke up. Ronstadt went solo and charted a few minor hits from 1970-1974 before landing a #1 in 1975 with \"You're No Good\" launching her to stardom.\n\nLooks like she doesn't really care that sparked her eventual path to stardom:\n\nRonstadt did one run-through of the song before recording her vocal, start to finish, in the next take. As she developed her vocal talents, she came to hate the way she sounded on the song. \"Today I will break my finger trying to get that record off when it's on,\" she said in the 2016 book Anatomy of a Song. \"Everyone hears something in that song - a breakup, the antiwar movement, women's lib. I hear a fear and a lack of confidence on my part. It all happened so fast that day.\"\n\nI can't call myself some kind of connoisseur of 1970s popular music (it's easily the decade I know least about in music) but I know I've heard Linda's name before and figured it'd be nice to add another female pop singer into the mix. I've also known this song for a long time and hoped others would too despite it not being a hit in Europe. It also has yet another little taste of the different styles being experimented with in the 1960s.\n\nOne interesting tidbit is my Mom saying Linda looked a lot like her best friend Mary in high school.\n\nCommentary\n\n@berserkboi (9) - A great discovery!\n\nHey we need more of these kind of comments!\n\n@Aester (5) - I have nothing against Linda Ronstadt usually (another favorite of my parents), but this vocal is really not her best.\n\nIt seems she would agree whole-heartedly.\n\n@Maki (7) - Cute, doesn't really make a particular impression.​\n\n#45\n\nCalifornia Vibes from 93.2 The Code - 11th\n\nThe Mamas and the Papas - Dedicated to the One I Love\n\n8.163\n\nHighest | 10 | @Hazey's Mom | 9.5 x 2 | @DJHazey, @unnameable\n\nLowest | 5 | @daninternational | 6 | @WoW73\n\nHalfway Mark | #33 (8.500) -- in the second half you'd find the 5 and the 6 and a few 7's which slowly but surely dragged the score down.\n\nReleased | February 1967\n\nN/A #2\n\nSongfacts | The song was written by Lowman Pauling, who was the guitarist of the \"5\" Royales, the group that recorded the original version of the song, produced by Ralph Bass, in 1957. A cover version was recorded and released by the girl group the Shirelles in 1959 and re-released to #2 hit in 1961.\n\nThe Mamas and the Papas version became the most prominent. It marked the first time Michelle Phillips was the lead singer on a song over Cass Elliott. That was the same story for the Shirelles when they recorded it, as normally, Shirley Owens Alston was the Shirelles' lead singer. However, on this song, Doris Coley Kenner sang lead.\n\nCouldn't find much about that song, but it definitely makes sense to me that this was first time Michelle took the lead. As I watched other live videos on YouTube for their other hits, you'll always see Cass doing most of the lead singing, but I noticed it was Michelle this time when I played this. I wanted to have four songs for the group. As I mentioned before with \"Creeque Alley\" and that being the last one I chose, this wasn't far behind. The other two songs were the definitive choices. If I had ultimately decided to only give the band two songs, I could've picked other artists, because as we can see these two didn't do much with voters. (but how far will \"Monday, Monday\" and \"California Dreamin'\" go?) I've always thought it was a sweet song though and my Mom definitely won't be happy about this elimination. (She was definitely more upset about what you all did to \"Sloop John B\" though, when I told her yesterday)\n\nCommentary\n\n@berserkboi (9) - Beautiful!\n\n@daninternational (5) - New, not for me.\n\n@Maki (7.75) - Started lovely but didn't really live up to that.\n\nHere is the version by The Shirelles.\n\nThe next song is not from California Vibes or Motown (who is still on their long hiatus) and is from act with only one song in the rate.\n\n​\n\n#44\n\nHaan FM's British Invasion - 10th\n\nThe Zombies - Time of the Season\n\n8.188\n\nHighest | 10 x 2 | @DJHazey, @Consideration\n\nLowest | 6.5 | @MilesAngel | 6.75 | @daninternational\n\nHalfway Mark | #38 (8.450) -- basically the peak because the next four scores were 7,7,7, and 7.5.\n\nReleased | March 1968\n\nN/A #3\n\nSongfacts | It was a song built around the bassline heard in the intro, with some very effective and unusual structural components that helped it endure. The bass riff is punctuated with a hand clap and the breathy \"ahhhh\" vocal. These elements add sonic texture during the verses, and also show up in the two interludes. And while most hit songs pound you with the chorus, this one doesn't. The full chorus - \"It's the time of the season for loving...\" takes just eight seconds and is repeated three times. That's just 24 seconds of chorus, but this minimalist approach gave the line tremendous impact, resonating with listeners at a time of social and political turmoil in America.\n\nThe band broke up in late 1967, shortly after recording the album. When the album was released in April 1968, it sold poorly, stalling on the US charts at #95 and making no impact in their native UK. The \"Time Of The Season\" single, however, became a huge hit in America even though the group had disbanded and couldn't support it. It sold over a million copies, peaking at #3 on March 29, 1969.\n\nWith their newfound American success, band members Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson and Hugh Grundy got the band back together, minus lead singer Colin Blunstone. This reunion was short lived, and by the end of 1969 The Zombies were once again dead.\n\nThe Zombies keyboard player Rod Argent wrote this song. He said in The Guardian February 22, 2008: \"'Time of the Season' was the last thing to be written (for the album). I remember thinking it sounded very commercial. One of my favorite records was George Gershwin's 'Summertime', we used to do a version of it when we started out. The words in the verse - 'What's your name? Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me?' - were an affectionate nod in that direction.\"\n\nThe recording of this song bought about a minor spat between keyboardist Rod Argent, who wrote the song, and the vocalist Colin Blunstone. The argument was over the phrase, \"When love runs high.\" Blunstone struggled with the high note at the end of the line, and snapped at Argent, \"If you're so good you come and sing it.\" Argent admitted in Mojo magazine February 2008: \"It was written really quickly and we didn't rehearse it an awful lot. I was trying to change the phrasing.\"\n\nBlunstone told his side in our 2015 interview. \"It was written in the morning before we went into the studio in the afternoon, and I kind of struggled on the melody,\" he said. \"Rod and I had quite a heated discussion – he being in the control room and me singing the song - and we were just doing it through my headphones. Because it had only just been written, I was struggling with the melody.\" Blunstone added: \"It makes me laugh, because at the same time I'm singing, 'It's the time of the season for loving,' we're really going at one another.\"\n\nRod Argent's organ sections take up about 90 seconds of this song's 3:22 running time. Most songs of the era that devoted so much of their time to organ riffs were much longer compositions like \"In-AGadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly and \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" by Procol Harum.\n\nI must say I'm beginning to be proud of how far the latter is doing.\n\nThis song has been sampled or interpolated on tracks by a number of artists, who sometimes use vast swaths of the song as the basis for their tracks - it's the base for the 2009 Melanie Fiona hit \"Give It To Me Right\" and for Eminem's 2013 track \"Rhyme or Reason.\" Other tracks to use it include \"Rolling Stone\" by ScHoolboy Q and \"Don't Look Back\" by Miguel.\n\nSurprisingly, this song never charted in the UK, although it is widely known there. In our 2015 interview with Rod Argent, he said: \"'Time of the Season' was the #1 in most countries in the world, but it wasn't in the UK. It's been released three times in the UK, and it's never been a hit. But the extraordinary thing is that everybody knows it in the UK. We played Glastonbury this year, and we had a big audience of the young kids who went completely mad when we played 'Time of the Season.' So, it has become, strangely enough, a classic in the UK, but it's never been a hit.\"\n\nI've always loved how spooky the song sounds, atmospheric and dark. Some of the lyrics, like \"what's your name? who's your daddy?\" fall in line with that too. It's always been one of the more seemingly sexual songs I've heard from the era, which I'll admit drew me to it because that was not very prevalent, at least the way they did it.\n\nCommentary\n\n@berserkboi (9) - I didn’t realise Take Me To The Clouds Above sampled something! Nor that Nick Cave & The Bad Seed song fff\n\nI didn't see these listed on Who Sampled.\n\n@Aester (7.5) - I love the Zombies (the album Odessey and Oracle especially), but I think this particular song may be too overplayed for me because I usually skip it. I am fond of its quirky organ solos, though.\n\nIt's funny to read this comment about overplay and the information above about how it has become such a UK classic despite never charting there and then the comments about seemingly hearing it for the first time.\n\n@Maki (8.5) - Very cool, the progressive production surely makes it stand out. Sounds quite familiar too.​\n\n#44\n\nHaan FM's British Invasion - 10th\n\nThe Zombies - Time of the Season\n\n8.188\n\nHighest | 10 x 2 | @DJHazey, @Consideration\n\nLowest | 6.5 | @MilesAngel | 6.75 | @daninternational\n\nHalfway Mark | #38 (8.450) -- basically the peak because the next four scores were 7,7,7, and 7.5.\n\nReleased | March 1968\n\nN/A #3\n\nSongfacts | It was a song built around the bassline heard in the intro, with some very effective and unusual structural components that helped it endure.
