        "text": "How did the Stone Pony in Asbury Park get its name?\n\nThe question came up during The New York Times-hosted “An Evening of Music and Memories at The Stone Pony,” Monday, Oct. 22, at the Pony.\n\nPony co-founder Jack Roig, Asbury Park councilwomen Eileen Chapman, current Pony manager Caroline O’Toole, E Street Band drummer Vini Lopez and Times reporter Nick Corasaniti participated in the discussion.\n\nIn memoriam: Butch Pielka, co-founder of the legendary Stone Pony of Asbury Park, has died\n\nRoig, who founded the Pony with the recently passed Butch Pielka, was initially a bit reticent to answer the question, posed by an audience member.\n\nHe then dove in, and it’s PG-13.\n\n“I woke up one morning, I happened to be next to somebody I really didn’t know,” Roig said. “Little horses on her shirt, and it was like November of '73. I was looking for a name for this place and I don’t know where it came from. It just popped into the head, that was it.”\n\nThe Stone Pony.\n\n“There was no dream, there was nothing — it was like divine intervention,” Roig said.\n\n“At least you didn’t name it ‘36D,’ ” quipped O’Toole to a roar of laughter.\n\n“That was beautiful,” said Roig of O’Toole’s rejoinder.\n\nThe evening covered everyone Pony, from the Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes’ 1976 Memorial Day show to the Bouncing Souls Home for the Holidays run. Southside Johnny and Bobby Bandiera closed out the night with song.\n\nWhat’s next? Perhaps Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul on the Stone Pony Summer Stage in 2019. Stevie Van Zandt suggested it was a possibility for next summer in a Tuesday, Oct. 23 tweet.\n\nBy the way, next year will be the Stone Pony’s 45th anniversary. Roig and Pielka opened it up in February 1974.\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com; Twitter: @chrisfhjordan"
