        "text": "With Michael Nesmith's recent passing, Micky Dolenz, now 77, is the last surviving member of the Monkees.\n\nFrom hit songs to the TV series that brought them together, Dolenz reflects on the group's legacy.\n\nDolenz is also kicking off a solo tour this month. The setlist is filled with the Monkees classics you'd expect to hear – as well as such lesser-known treasures.\n\nPHOENIX — It was Nov. 14, 2021, when Micky Dolenz last saw Michael Nesmith at the final concert of the Monkees Farewell Tour at the historic Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, not far from where they'd met as young men on the set of a TV show.\n\nThey didn't say goodbye that night.\n\n\"I think we both kind of avoided it,\" Dolenz recalls.\n\nIt hadn't been an easy tour.\n\n\"It was public knowledge that Nez had some health issues, some pretty serious ones, a couple years before,\" Dolenz says.\n\n\"It was pretty apparent that I wouldn't be doing many more shows with him... We were doing everything we could to make him comfortable. But it was tough. And it was bittersweet. We asked him, 'Are sure you want to do this?' And I've got to hand it to him. He hung in there.\"\n\nWatch 2016 reunion: 50 years later, they still like to monkey around\n\nDecember 2021: Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith dies at 78\n\nNesmith, 78, died of heart failure at home in Carmel Valley, California, on Dec. 10 – less than a month after they closed that final Monkees concert with one last performance of \"I'm a Believer.\"\n\n\"It did not come as a great surprise, frankly,\" Dolenz says.\n\nBut it still hit him hard.\n\nLosing Davy Jones and Peter Tork\n\nIt's been 10 years since Davy Jones became the first Monkee to leave us.\n\n\"He was the youngest one of all of us, and he was in pretty good health, supposedly. But they missed something. So that was a huge shock,\" Dolenz says.\n\nJones' final outing as a Monkee was a 45th Anniversary Tour in 2011, which Nesmith did not join.\n\nThe three surviving Monkees staged a bittersweet reunion tour the year Jones died at age 66 of a heart attack, going on to record the highest-charting Monkees album since their '60s prime, 2016's \"Good Times!,\" and 2018's \"Christmas Party.\"\n\nPeter Tork died of cancer in early 2019. He was 77.\n\nWith Nesmith's recent passing, that leaves Dolenz, now 77, as the only one to carry on the Monkees' legacy, which he intends to do when his solo tour kicks off this month.\n\n\"I think I'm still kind of processing it, to some degree,\" he says. \"Being the last man standing.\"\n\nAugust: Monkees' last surviving member Micky Dolenz sues FBI for files on the band, its members\n\nHow Circus Boy became a Monkee\n\nDolenz never saw the famous advertisement in the Hollywood Reporter seeking \"4 insane boys, age 17-21\" for a TV show inspired by the Beatles film \"A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\nAs a preteen using the name Micky Braddock, Dolenz played an orphaned water boy for elephants in the title role of a children's television show called \"Circus Boy.\"\n\n\"I had an agent,\" he says. \"So I had my own private audition right away with the producers. I remember that first interview, reading lines from the script. So no, I didn't see the ad or even know about it until later.\"\n\nThere was a second audition for improvisation, and a third for music.\n\n\"My audition piece was 'Johnny B. Goode.' I was in cover bands. One was Micky and the One Nighters. The other was Missing Links. I was the lead singer and I would sing all the hits of the day, including things like 'Johnny B. Goode' or 'Louie Louie.'\"\n\nDolenz aced that part, of course. He went on to sing lead on a number of the Monkees' biggest hits.\n\n'The ratings came in and the show was a hit'\n\n\"The Monkees\" premiered as a Monday night lead-in to \"I Dream of Jeannie\" on NBC in 1966 with an episode called \"Royal Flush,\" in which the Monkees save Princess Bettina, Duchess of Harmonica, from her evil uncle Archduke Otto.\n\nDid Dolenz know the show would be a hit when they filmed those early episodes?\n\n\"You never do,\" he says. \"Anybody that tells you they knew it was gonna be a smash is just kidding themselves. You never know. You can't. If there was a formula that you could follow, then there wouldn't be any flops.\"\n\nAll you can do is your best, Dolenz says.\n\n\"The only formula, if there is one, is surround yourself with people who have the same vision that are also talented, that are willing to work hard, and you just all do your best. And then you keep your fingers crossed.\"\n\nAll he knew for sure before the series aired was that he was having a really great time as a Monkee.\n\nEventually, \"the ratings came in and the show was a hit. And then of course the records were big hits,\" Dolenz says.\n\nThe Monkees' first four albums topped the charts while spinning off singles as timeless as \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" \"I'm a Believer,\" \"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" and \"Daydream Believer.\"\n\nAnd yet, the show only lasted two seasons.\n\n\"But you must remember, in those days, a season was 26 episodes,\" Dolenz says. \"Now, a season is eight, if you're lucky. Sometimes six. So in today's world, we probably were on ... well, what's the math?\"\n\nWhy 'The Monkees' worked so well\n\nDolenz has his theories as to why \"The Monkees\" was a hit.\n\nFor one, they kept it light.\n\n\"'The Monkees' was like an old Marx Brothers movie. It was John Lennon that first made that comment. And he's absolutely right,\" Dolenz says. \"That's one of the reasons it stands up over the decades.\"\n\nIt also also had great writers and directors, Dolenz says. And then, of course, there were the songs.\n\n\"We had such incredible songwriters,\" he says, pointing to Neil Diamond, Carole King, Paul Williams and more.\n\n\"They stand up over the years with great producers and us. I'd like to think that I had something to do with it, singing most of the leads.\"\n\nBeyond 'A Hard Day's Night'\n\nDespite all that, the Monkees did have their detractors.\n\n\"Everybody has compared it to 'A Hard Day's Night' or said we were the Prefab Four, which is just not accurate,\" Dolenz says.\n\n\"The show was about trying to become the Beatles, trying to be famous. We had a poster of the Beatles on the wall that we threw darts at. And on the show, we never made it. We were never famous. It was the struggle for success that made it work.\"\n\nVoices: The Beatles launched me into adolescence, but in 'Get Back' they weren't who I expected\n\nThey may have been a group of actors brought together to portray a band, but they became a band as part of that portrayal.\n\n\"Nez put it great once,\" Dolenz says. \"He said when we actually did go on the road and play the concerts all by ourselves for tens of thousands of screaming fans, it was like Pinocchio becoming a real little boy.\"\n\nThe Monkees' fight for creative control\n\nBy their third album, 1967's \"Headquarters,\" the Monkees had won more creative control over the music, relying less on session players and outside writers.\n\nNesmith was the only Monkee with a writing credit on the first two albums, placing one song on \"The Monkees\" and two songs on \"More of the Monkees.\" Eight of 14 songs on \"Headquarters\" had members of the Monkees in the writing credits.\n\n\"That was mostly Nez, as you know,\" Dolenz says of the struggle to win more creative control. \"Eventually, we did put our collective foot down, had a bit of a palace revolt. And out of that came that wonderful 'Headquarters' album, which I'm very, very proud of.\"\n\nNesmith arrived at the Monkees audition as an aspiring singer-songwriter.\n\n\"He had been promised that he would record his tunes and sing his tunes,\" Dolenz says. \"And then they pulled the rug right out from under him.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nThere's a story Dolenz likes to tell on stage about the early days, when Nesmith asked the show's producers to record one song in particular.\n\n\"He played it for them. And they said, 'Yeah, no, thank you. That's not a Monkee tune.' He said, 'Hey, I am one of the Monkees. What are you're talking about?'\" Dolenz said.\n\nThe show's producers didn't budge.\n\n\"So he went and gave it to this young girl singer kicking around town, at the time, relatively unknown,\" Dolenz says. \"I'm sure you know the song I'm talking about. It was 'Different Drum.' He gave it to Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys.\"\n\nDolenz put his own spin on that folk-rock classic on his latest solo album, 2021's \"Dolenz Sings Nesmith.\"\n\nIt's in the setlist on his latest solo tour, surrounded by the Monkees classics you'd expect to hear – as well as such lesser-known treasures like \"Randy Scouse Git\" and \"No Time.\"\n\n\"How can you not enjoy singing that stuff?\" Dolenz says.\n\n\"We have a saying. They pay us to travel and we sing for free. And there's a lot of truth in that. Playing music is fun. That's why they call it playing.\""
