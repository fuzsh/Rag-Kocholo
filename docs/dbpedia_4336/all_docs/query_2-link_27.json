As proud dads, our aim or desire will naturally be to lead by example in the family home. As in various different studies its been highlighted that our children will do as we do, rather than do as we say. I've found this to be so true which prompted me to share on a deeper level in my Essential Guide To Being The Best Dad You Can Be. It will feel like a whole new ball game. Instilling in our children the things our parents never knew or didn't show us. Like the importance of emotional inteligence. the courage to face thier struggles instead of keeping them locked up inside or running away from them. And having the wisdom to seek community and support when needed. Us dads all have a story to tell, some good and some not so good. And also some painful experiences and challenges in our younger years that we have kept bottled up inside as we don't want to come across as a burden or soft. I have created a guide for dads that when consumed and implemented you will: 1. Experience improved and more meaningful relationships in the family home. 2. Break the habits that have caused so much pain and upheaval in the past. 3. Learn how your past affects and shapes the present. 4 Have your own personalized blueprint to follow so you can become the best dad you can be for your children.

But rarely in today’s society do we give kids the same grace we feel entitled to as adults. One thing I’ve learned while working with kids, and always try to keep in mind, is they are dealing with some pretty big stuff. They’re walking in with their big attitudes and lack of attention span, but underneath the behavior, a lot of kids are hurting. I’ve also learned that the younger the kid, the more willing they are to share some of what’s weighing them down. And a lot of it would break your heart as an adult. Some of it we can relate to because we dealt it with back in our day. Some of it’s brand new. But all of it affects their behavior. And yet, we’re so quick to judge “kids these days”. “They need more discipline and less screens. More respect for adults and less attitude.” “Kids these days are soft. I went through hell and turned out fine.” Maybe what they need is for adults to remember that everyone, including some of the youngest of mankind, is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Maybe they could use the same empathy and understanding we long for as adults. And maybe, just maybe, if we give it to them today, we lessen the number of battles they have to fight in their future. The less battles their own kids will have to fight. Kids these days are as strong and resilient as they’ve ever been. Let’s give them a world where they’re not fighting for basic human needs before they’ve even learned to read and write. The only way they turn out fine is if they grow up to realize that depriving kids of empathy and respect is not at all fine.\n\nDo you want children? The third date is often considered too early to ask someone if they want children, but should it be? I was recently talking with some younger people, late twenties to early thirties, and they seemed unanimous in thinking that bringing up the topic of children on the third date was too much. I was shocked. If having children is an important part of your future, shouldn't you know early on if your date feels the same way? To ease into the topic, I suggested starting with a conversation about siblings, nieces, and nephews. Most people feel comfortable talking about their family, and it's an easy way to gauge their feelings towards kids. If your date has godchildren, that's another natural segue into the topic. If they respond positively and enthusiastically to talking about kids, that's a good sign they might be interested in having children in the future. If they react negatively, it's worth asking them to elaborate further by simply saying, \"tell me more.\" This can open up the conversation and give you a better understanding of their perspective. Either way, it's crucial to find out early on if your visions align. Your dating time is precious, and it's not worth over investing in someone whose values don't align with yours. You can always be friends, but don't continue dating if you want different things. Just my two cents.\n\nHow much do you trust your child? We all trust our kids but we don't trust the many strangers who pose a problem for our child so we tend to become super protective leading to mistrust. Does this resonate with you as a parent? While a few days back an 18 Year old committed suicide because he couldn't stop playing games on his mom's phone leading to clicking on an unknown link that lead to Rs 2lacs being wiped out from the parents account. Losing a life is not worth anything😢 Had the child confided in his parents he wouldn't have taken such a drastic step. As parents it's important to have trust in our children and vice-versa. We all want what's best for our children, and sometimes that means letting go a little and trusting them more. Trust isn't just about believing they won't mess up; it's about believing they have the wisdom and resilience to navigate life's twists and turns. When we trust our kids, we're showing them that we have faith in their judgment and abilities. It's like giving them the keys to their own journey and saying, \"𝑰 𝒃𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒆𝒗𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝒚𝒐𝒖.\" In today's world it can be scary to loosen the reins and let them make their own choices, but it's also incredibly empowering for them. It teaches responsibility, independence, and self-confidence—all crucial skills for adulthood. But, that doesn't mean we turn a blind eye or stop being involved in their lives. It means finding a balance between guidance and freedom, being there to catch them if they stumble but also giving them the space to spread their wings. So, let's open up those lines of communication, listen without judgment, and build a relationship based on mutual trust and respect. Because when we trust our kids, we're not just giving them permission to live their lives—we're giving them the greatest gift of all: our unwavering support. 🌟 Today have a heart-to-heart conversation about trust with your kiddos. 💖\n\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THESE 10 UNSPOKEN RULES AS A PARENT OR FUTURE PARENT 1. Let love and discipline be shared equally between Father and Mother, else children grow up with the impression that mummy really cared, while daddy was mean and wicked. 2. Our parents taught us to stay away from rich children, that they are spoilt. We ended up with poor folks and poverty mentality. Till today, some of us cannot enjoy a buffet in a decent restaurant without feeling robbed😀 3. As your children grow, let them know that you are not gods, mom and dad have fears and insecurities, struggles and vulnerabilities. Let them know that as you overcome yours, they too can overcome theirs, if challenges show up. 4. Let your children master their unique origins, culture and language, it will save them on specials days. 5. Let them learn. Give young kids a chance to find their own solutions. When you lovingly acknowledge a child's minor frustrations without immediately rushing in to save her, you teach her self-reliance and resilience. 5. You have very few years to pray with, enjoy and mould your kids, once they are off to boarding school, your influence is limited, only God’s mercy will rescue them from peer tendencies. 6. Too many teens head to secondary school dormitories with no clue how to clean their clothes. Don't let your child become one of them. You can begin laundry lessons when kids are around 6 years. 7. Teach your kids that despite their best efforts they could still fail, but they mustn’t give up, they must keep pushing till they win. 8. Don’t scold your kids to timidity, let them learn to respectfully speak their mind, understand others, express emotions and be grateful. 9. Having unrealistic expectations of your children also can cause kids to feel shame if they are unable to live up to those expectations. They also may develop negative beliefs about themselves as not being “good enough.” It can even lead them to develop anxiety and low esteem. 10. Allow kids to be kids, don’t make them up, don’t fix her a Brazilian hair for her 14th birthday, or bone straight for her 15th😁. They will have enough time in future to use these things. #dareitdoit #fathersdayextra Repost it if you found it useful\n\nWho does your child say you are? (No, I don’t mean “mom” or “dad”) Are you: - A reliable friend and confidant? - A distant, busy parent hoping they “understand“? I attended boarding school where 12-19 yo girls wore their hearts on their sleeves. My friends with absentee parents were: 1. Less confident. 2. Less trusting of people. 3. More emotionally unstable. 4. Dependent on external sources for love. My parent(s) were almost always present. They: - took me to and from school on outing weekends. - visited me on the other weekends with dinner. - surprised me on my birthday, etc. Without trying, they became the benchmark. My friends rarely cared about the why their parents were absent. They cared more about genuine effort to be present. Don’t get so caught up in giving your children a better life that you forget the children. If they can’t depend on you, they’ll find someone else to depend on. How does the way you spend your time affirm your children’s feelings?\n\nGrowing up as the oldest child often means navigating a strange sensation of being overlooked and simultaneously burdened with responsibility. From a young age, you may have found yourself shouldering the weight of familial expectations, bringing too much attention to you as the one responsible for keeping or caring for your siblings. At the same time, your own needs might have been overlooked. You might have felt unseen and not always given the space to be a child and discover your personality and preferences. It's a complex combination that can leave a lasting imprint, shaping your sense of identity and worth as you journey into adulthood. Despite the challenges, many eldest siblings emerge with a resilience born from adversity, learning to carve out their own path and assert their needs amidst the competing demands of family life. Let's recognize and honor the experiences of eldest children, acknowledging the nuanced complexities of their roles within the family dynamic. If you're an oldest child, let me know if you experienced this in the comments! 👇 #oldestchild #FamilyDynamics #mentalhealthquote #eldestdaughtersyndrome"
