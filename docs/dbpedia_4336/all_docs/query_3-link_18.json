They sing for a mate, to claim their territory, or simply to give voice to the delight of being alive in the midst of a beautiful day.” – Linda Ronstadt, from Simple Dream: A Musical Memoir Linda Ronstadt is arguably the most versatile and recognized singer of the modern era. She has forged a four-decade career which established her as one of the very important artists in one of the most creative periods in the history of modern music. She is the most accomplished Latina musical artist of her generation. Linda Ronstadt was born on July 15, 1946, in Tucson, Arizona, and grew up surrounded by music. One of her early influences was the Mexican songs her father taught her and her siblings. She learned to play guitar and performed with her brother and sister as a trio. Moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s, she began performing, first with the Stone Poneys and later as a solo act, recording a series of albums that helped create the country rock genre. Her rise culminated with 1974’s Heart Like a Wheel, which made her as star. Throughout the 70s and into the mid 80s, she expended her musical inspirations, delving into rock, contemporary pop, new wave, pop standards, and country. In 1987, Ronstadt recorded Canciones de mi Padre, a set of traditional Mexican songs from her childhood. To the surprise of many, the album became a multi-platinum success, and is still the largest-selling Spanish language CD in the history of the U.S. music industry. After another pop hit, Linda returned to traditional Mexican material with Mas Canciones and later recorded the Cuban-influenced Frenesí. Later in the 90s, she returned to contemporary pop and country, as well as recording a children’s lullaby album, a foray into jazz, and in her final recording, a duet collaboration with Cajun artist Ann Savoy. She sang her last concert in 2009, and shortly thereafter announced her retirement from singing. In 2011, she received a Latin Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and 2013, she was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2014, Linda was honored by President Barack Obama with National Medal of Arts at a White House. Her 2013 book, Simple Dreams, A Musical Memoir, made the New York Times best-seller list.
