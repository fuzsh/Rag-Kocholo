        "text": "Good morning, workers! A brand new week is upon is and we’ve got a brand new Stone Poneys playlist to start off the day, but it doesn’t end there! Read on for details!\n\nHere’s your musical lineup:\n\n11:00 a.m. In the Spotlight: The Music of The Stone Poneys NEW!\n\nWhen Linda Ronstadt first left Tucson for LA to make music, she met Bobby Kimmel who proposed they start a band. Then came Kenny Edwards (who would become an integral part of her solo career band). Thus, The Stone Poneys were born. The rest, as they say, is musical history as Linda Ronstadt forged an amazing career that earned her the title ‘The Queen of Rock’ in a male-dominated world. These early days are often forgotten, but not here in The Mermaid Lounge as we give you a brand new Spotlight featuring her days as a Stone Poney.\n\n3:00 p.m. Seasons: Various Artists\n\nYes, we are about to change seasons once again, so we think this is a good time to play this one since we’ve not heard it since the last snowfall. You’ll hear Bobbie Gentry, Janis Ian, Simon & Garfunkel, The Lovin’ Spoonful, The Byrds, Hoyt Axton, Sly & The Family Stone, John Prine, The Rolling Stones, Blood, Sweat & Tears, The Band, Nina Simone, The Kinks, The Zombies, Electric Light Orchestra, Jefferson Airplane, James Taylor and more!\n\n7:00 p.m. Hot Tuna Live at The Fillmore, San Francisco, CA, March 4, 1988\n\nClosing out the programming on Monday is another Lounge favorite, Hot Tuna. This one is live from The Fillmore West."
