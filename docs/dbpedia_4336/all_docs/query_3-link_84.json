Currently, they have a contract with the Circinus Federation and are stationed on Clayborne II.\n\nDuring the Jihad, the unit was listed as wanted because of their contract with the WoB affiliated Circinus Federation.\n\nOfficers[edit]\n\nRank Name Command Commanding Officers of Stone Ponies Captain Lyndsey Reinstadt 3067\n\nOther Officers[edit]\n\nMaster Sergeant Franco Klein.\n\nTactics[edit]\n\nThe Stone Ponies prefer to minimize civilian casualties, and try to fight away from populated areas for this reason.\n\nSupport[edit]\n\nThe unit does not possess any support assets.\n\nComposition[edit]\n\n3067[edit]\n\nStone Ponies (1 Company)\n\nCO: Captain Lyndsay Reinstadt\n\nXO/Able Lance: Lieutenant Edmund Brown\n\nBaker Lance: Lieutenant Arthur Chubarov\n\nCharlie Lance: Master Sergeant Franco Klein\n\nThe Ponies contains 6 'Mechs and the rest are medium/heavy armored vehicles.\n\nColor Scheme[edit]\n\nThe Stone Ponies use a rough rust-and-black camouflauge scheme for their unit.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]"
