        "text": "Firstly, wow. Has it really been 5 months since my last blog entry. So much has happened but I guess thats probably the reason I haven't had a moment to consider updating this blog. Sorry. If you were sat there waiting. You've probably had stuff to do.\n\nA few years ago a comedy pal of mine said I should write about the horrible stuff that has happened in my life, and write jokes about it. I thought that was a bloody ridiculous idea. I guess it was too raw to even consider. Now life has picked up somewhat, and those horrible times are still fresh but memories, I've done just that and have written my first hour's show!\n\nI have previewed it at Leicester Comedy Festival, Bath Comedy Festival and Brighton Comedy Festival so far and all the rooms have been great. Packed, and the perfect audience for my show - proper grown ups, mostly couples, and I guess people who read my flyer about me, getting fat and unhealthy, and fighting back middle age. I didnt really consider my marketing being something that attracted the right audience more than attracting AN audience, but I have to say its a wonderful accident that the explanation of my show on the leaflet naturally appeals to those in the same boat as me - it makes it easier for them to connect with my stories and laugh, or cry (as one audience member said after hearing some of the less happy stories in my show!).\n\nWriting an hour's show about my life isnt easy. I spend all my time on stage projecting an image of a man people can laugh at. Most comedians have a personae, that, whilst it includes some parts of them, isn't really them. To then write a show that reveals the real you is very disarming, and I guess quite counterproductive if your usual audience comes along and sees it. For that reason I've held off doing the show in my home city where I tend to host a lot of shows and events. Until it's perfect anyway!\n\nLast year I spent a lot of time writing and planning the show. I was struggling. Now having previewed the show 4 or 5 times, I am very excited and keen to preview it more and more. I am taking it to Guildford in July and Edinburgh for 11 nights In August, and after that it's full throttle. No more previews and work in progress. Then next year in Edinburgh is the year. Who knows!!\n\nLast year I really struggled. My previous 2 years of doing shows had taken off to such a point where I had started getting some great opportunies. I had turned pro after 2 years, and was gigging for most major chains. Last year I reached a plateau. I remember losing my way. Standing on stage and taking it slow. Pausing. Contemplating. Becoming laboured in my delivery. I was experimenting. I know that now, but more than anything I lost the energy. The thrust of my personae and my stage presence.\n\nFrom the beginning I was regularly told I look like I really enjoy myself up on stage. That's because I do. Last year the mix of confidence, success, a little bit of writing stagnation and to be honest some uncertainty in where I was going with comedy meant my stage 'punch' went. I was very worried.\n\nThen Christmas arrived (a time I love!), a few new bits of material came out that became brilliant sections of my set, and my energy ignited once more! I was over the moon! Only then did I realise what had been going wrong the previous 9-10 months. Only then did I actually realise there had been a problem. I just thought I'd lost it, and started to worry that comedy was going to fall apart for me.\n\nThat new found energy carried on into 2015, and it started so strongly in January that it made me even more excited for comedy, and my future.\n\nWhilst last year almost certainly lost me some momentum, this year I have started gigging for most of the major bookers in the country that I wasn't already, including Manfords Comedy Clubs, Rob Riley, CKP, Avalon, and just been given my first spot at The Comedy Store in London on my own merit too, not doing their nasty Gong Show! eeurgh!\n\nThis year does seem to be the year for cancellations though, as more and more clubs grow and thrive and other less organised shows crumble. The trick is spotting the less organised clubs before you agree to appear at their shows, so you avoid cancellations. Mind you. I if could do that, it would be a psychic show not a comedy show, I guess!\n\nTalking of cancellations, I was very sad that Mic, Bike 'n' Hike had to be cancelled this year. Last year, and some of the year before, I worked tirelessly to organise the big charity walk and bike ride for 10 comedians to make their way over 4 days from London to Portsmouth raising money for Macmillan Cancer, in memory of my brother. Something I'd wanted to do for a while. As my life got busier and busier, this year's event was picked up by the other comedians, so I didnt have to organise it on my own, but sadly it wasn't to be. There's something to be said for team work, but sometimes doing something on your own means you only let yourself down if you fail to do something. Hopefully it'll be back next year, or I might think of something else to do in memory of Matthew.\n\nMatthew gets a mention of course in my show. Losing him was one of the biggest kicks in my life. It's definitely tough to talk about the bad times. Though it has been quite cathartic too, to talk about all the times that you feel you may have bottled up to try and forget. haveI had some really problematic moments where I would cry whilst rehearsing the show. That's not a problem in itself. I'm in touch with my emotions, ladies....but us humans are such simple machines, and as any comedian will tell you, it remembers. The body and the brain form habits. Picking up a drink at a certain punchline. Coughing at a particular moment in your set. Repetitive actions and intonation that aren't intentional. For this reason, it can become very risky if you cry at a memory whilst rehearsing, because if it happens too much, you naturally start crying during the show, even if you actually aren't even thinking about the sadness whilst you're saying it! Weird and wonderful human beings eh?\n\nI'm not overly worried about showing emotions during the show, after all, I do enjoy myself, as everyone points out, and I love comedy. The hour show I have written it almost all laughs, but as I have pointed out to the press, all our lives are not hilarious, so whilst the show is a comedy hour, my life hasn't been one long laugh, so there are sad bits. One lady after the show said she was crying with laughter and then crying with sadness. Another said it was hilarious and inspirational.\n\nThese are things I had not expected. I didnt set out to write a show that was inspiring. I didn't set out to write a show that made people cry. What I did set out to do was write something that shows I can write an hour of a story that wasn't joke, joke, joke. Like you see when I'm at Jongleurs, or Comedy All Stars, or The Comedy Store (I know. I'm very excited!). What I wanted to write was something that would connect with the audience, and get across my life story in a way that would make people feel like they leave knowing me more, and not getting bored whilst learning. Laughing as much as possible, and having fun.\n\nThat's hopefully what the poster portrays too. It seems to be working. If you're near Guildford on 5th July then come and see it. If you're going to Ednburgh between 19th and 29th August then come see it. Nothing worse than telling me life story to the landlord and his dog!\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for coming to my show. You're coming right? Hello? Anybody? Helloooo.....?\n\nI really don't like these headings that basically line you up so you know the whole blog will be showing off about how far they've come, after all, let's be honest, no comedian is in this job to not be recognised as successful at making more and more people laugh as time goes on, but I'll be honest, if those kind of blogs arent for you....probably best stop now and find a lovely clip of a cat playing the piano or a guy trying to climb a wall but falling flat on his face and hurting himself.\n\nI write these yearly overviews every year at this time, and whilst it's great to keep everyone up to date about my journey in this wonderful career (because some people actually read this thing!), I can honestly say this is something I write more to remind myself about my year. I look down my accounts Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (sorry, name dropping), and every gig I've done, every casting, every appearance, and my mind comes alive with joy, frustration, delight, impatience about how each opportunity has gone, be it good or bad.\n\nThis year has truly been remarkable....and not in a 'I think it's been great so I'll say remarkable, so you keep reading', kind of way, but in a way that I've completed so many things, and ticked so many things off my ambition list that I feel quite exhausted looking through the list of things I've been part of. No wonder I've got bags on my bags!\n\nI'm not overly sure if I've risen up the ladder too much, as I wanted to be a regular at weekend clubs at this point, 4 years in, and although I've done quite a few weekends and weekend dates doing paid work for the main clubs, I still am not on their 'go to' list, so I'm not going to kid myself or you that I've achieved that.\n\nI wanted more TV stuff, and I had a very close call where I was filmed for Stand Up For Cancer, explaining my close call with Testicular Cancer, and then including my silly #feelingnuts bath time clips that I filmed to promote checking your nuts, and got to the final edit of the Channel 4 show, before being snipped onto the cutting room floor on the night itself when One Direction over ran on the live show....yeah I know, who??\n\nI've also been filmed doing stand up and a lengthy interview for a pilot for Channel 4 about behind the scenes in the comedy world. Not sure whether this will ever see the light of day, but it was great fun to film, and maybe it'll get on your tellbox in 2015. Whow knows eh?\n\nI naturally continued to develop my own clubs, Spinnaker Tower Comedy Club, which regularly attracts 100-150 people in its wonderfully intimate club setting (now running almost every month in 2015), and much to my delight, I have now started hosting Comedy All Stars, the 500 seater wonderful club also in Hampshire, which presents 3 TV stars each show, and will have 5 shows in 2015. Both are a delight to host, and have helped me fall in love with MCing - something I never thought I'd be able to bear back in the day!\n\nWhilst I continued to struggle but found SOME time to write a few more pages of my book \"My First 2 Years in Stand Up\", two other projects of mine did get underway as planned. The first ever outing for Foster's South Coast Comedian of the Year, and the huge charity event \"Mic, Bike 'n' Hike\". The competition, attracted over 100 new comedians, and 72 got through to the heats and competed, and hosting the heats and final really did open my eyes. Some great new comedians coming through, old and young, but some truly awful acts as well. Haha! (no, you're right, I shouldn't say that, sorry!) What amazed me more than anything was how comedians don't have a recording of their act!! It was a simple way to gauge if the act was viable to enter our competition, and not even having a recording of their act was amazing! How do they expect to promote themselves and get the attention of a promoter or agent without being able to send them a recording of themselves!!!? The winner Mike Cox was a terrific result, and an act I've gigged with and met a few times before the competition and thought had a great confidence and personae. Who knows what 2015 will bring!?\n\nThe charity walk was an exhausting, emotional and exhilerating experience, with 8 other comedians who I really bonded with. A great bunch, and all of us walked 100 miles from BT Tower to Spinnaker Tower, London to Portsmouth, and I planned the whole thing! I know...miracles, and we only took one wrong turn that lasted about 30 seconds! I was amazed too! The training involved me walking about 30 miles a week minimum for about 10 weeks before the event itself - finding the time was the biggest challenge to be honest - the amount of days between the school run where I'd walk for 3 hours in one direction exhausted in the Summer heat only to realise I had just 3 hours to get back to pick the boys up from school was a rare treat I am glad didnt happen too many times!!!!\n\nWe gigged every night along the route, and raised over £5000! The shows were great, the walking was absolutely debilitating, but also so rewarding, in seering heat in July, and the crowds were brilliant - and all for Macmillan Cancer Research!\n\nIn total I travelled just over 60,000 miles performing in 2014. It was the year that my comedy abroad really developed as I went out regularly performing for TED, mostly in Egypt, performing at their wonderful club in their 5 star resort there, and also got asked to go out to Switzerland performing mostly to Nestle staff. The travel was tiring, especially when you get back in the early hours and then have to drive 300 miles the next day to perform up north or in the deep south west, but such an exciting part of the year. A tan, free food and drink, sun bathing on a glorious beach with waiter service, and a half hour gig, whilst away for 3 days - yeah ok! Sounds fine....:)\n\nI was also involved in the record breaking attempt of the longest stand up - brilliantly arranged by fellow Pompey comedian, Joe Wells. Still not sure if we did break the record, but I had to do 3 single hour stints during the 84 hour record attempt, practising what was to be my first solo hour, in front of a varying amount of people ranging from 10, at 4:30am in the morning, to 50 just as the world record attempt approached on the final night.\n\n...but those weren't the craziest shows, although they are certainly up there. I performed too at a variety of private shows and corporates, one that was a 'Grand Ball' in a huge function hall laid out with glorious table decorations and extravagant chocolate fountains and hog roasts, to which only 11 people turned up, in full ball gown attire, whilst I stood 100 yards away on stage with a mic and cable that wouldnt let me get any closer to them!\n\nI also hosted the huuuge 3 day Southsea Comedy Festival where over 2000 people assembled each night in the most wonderful setting under the big top to watch Eddie Izzard perform his solo show on the Thursday and Friday, and then a host of big TV stars on a mixed Bill on the Saturday. Hosting the shows in my home city to such big audiences was terrific, and I was originally asked to simply 'support' Eddie Izzard as the local Portsmouth comedian, but hosting seemed the right thing to do, and giving my best buddies in the comedy world, Larry Dean and Craig Murray the stage to support Eddie on Thursday and then Friday was a terrific buzz to watch. They are both terrific guys and great comedians - such a terrific show, and meeting Eddie was certainly a tick in the box!\n\nAs I look back over each year, I can get a good general idea as to whether I have moved up or down in my career, and thinking it over I did wonder if I had progressed at all! Looking at the facts, I do feel I have, and looking at next year's bookings I have already surpassed 2014's bookings and earnings, so I am absolutely buzzing already. It's difficult when you dont get to sit down with your boss who then gives you a pat on the back, a pay rise or even a well done, with a handy productivity graph to help you - but earnings and bookings are really the only indicator. Especially when, like most comedians, your head is often full of self doubt as to whether you are completely deluded or whether you are actually even an ounce funny....\n\nA wonderful handful of well respected promoters have taken me under their wing for regular paid work that I am quite frankly elated by, and wont embarrass them (or probably confuse you) by listing. They aren't famous clubs as far as the layman, but they are very well respected in the comedy world, and it goes some way to making my status as full-time professional comedian a little more authentic, as ridiculously fantastical as that sounds when I say it in my head, or type it out here!\n\nI've only been full-time for 2 years, and only been doing this dream for 4 years, so it's still very early days, but when I glanced over at the presents under the tree and worked out what I'd been able to spend on my children, I felt very chuffed to pay for them with what is essentially laughter.\n\nI've spent most of my life laughing with people and at people (in a nice way of course), and being able to fund my little family by laughter is such a blessing.\n\nI'm a million miles away from a finished article. I've performed on the same bill as dozens of big stars this year, and seasoned professionals, and quite frankly have wanted the ground to swallow me up at the prospect of having to step into the same spotlight after them whilst watching them make the audience explode in laughter, but what I do know is that I love this job, and am constantly working to improve.\n\nI'd say this year has seen me miss just as much as hit the mark in my shows. I am very tough on myself and still film probably 80% of my shows to watch them back, and there were certainly a few months either side of Edinburgh where I completely lost my mojo; Edinburgh helped me write lots of new material but completely distracted me from my personae....my voice. I became more eratic, more random in my style, and slightly more of a freestyle voice on stage. I had become very structured and mechanical. It didnt look like it too much to the audience, but I was well aware that I was becoming a bit too rigid. Edinburgh shook that out of me, and so now, as I write my first ever solo show \"The Hunger James\" I am rattling around with a relatively new approach to James Alderson, comedian.\n\nIt's the same me, but with a bit more freedom to express truths and my life. It's not what I think people want to hear as much as it is what I want to tell them, in a way they want to hear it. It's a twist on my style, but I loved Edinburgh, and I'm determined to evolve my work in progress show of 2015 into something which will make audiences love my first ever solo hour, and just as importantly, make me love performing it, and maybe evn give them more of an insight into me and my life so far.\n\nAs I grow and grow my own clubs, inevitably some promoters may get a bit twitchy about the success they achieve, which I've sadly sensed recently (surely there's enough of an audience to go around?), but more importantly... I'm trying to not get labelled as a promoter, as I sometimes feel that is already happening, so my aim in 2015 is to continue to grow my own career and continue to develop my rapport with the main clubs. I'm very very excited about the dates I'm being asked toperform at that are coming in right now, especially the northern club dates where I really feel at home. My 20 and 30 minute sets are really what I enjoy, and the bigger clubs are where they can really come alive. Saying that, the small function rooms at the back of pubs are often just as magical to perform in, but there's something exta special about the stamp of authenticity a comedian gets when a 'chain' of clubs asks you to perform - \"what? you mean I count as a comedian??\"\n\nOnce again, I'll be involved in the Mic, Bike 'n' Hike Charity Walk, and I'll be carrying on my book, and hopefully nearly finishing it. I've been asked to perform with Jo Brand again in February at The Bloomsbury Theatre which is magical, and hosting numerous shows and events for The Children's Air Ambulance, including warm up for Lionel Richie's show to the VIPs in a box at his show in March! I'm hosting the big top to 2000 people a night again at Southsea Comedy Festival with another huge headliner, and have numerous international dates on the cards, including rumours of a potential regular comedy club starting in Switzerland that I may be resident host for!\n\nSouth Coast Comedian of the Year 2015 is just about to start as well, so I can see the next flood of new southern comedians coming through the ranks, and with over 70 other dates in my 2015 diary already I'm interested to see what comes of the next 12 months.\n\nWhatever it is, I hope it continues to be healthy, and happy for me and my family, and that I'm allowed to make people laugh, and that it happens with more and more success. Quite frankly as long as the same happens as this year, and that I don't have to put on a grey suit and stare at a partitioned wall, all the while getting post it notes put on my computer screen whilst I visit the vending machine on my 15 minute break, then I'll be happy!\n\nI often wondered what I'd do if this career never took hold, but I'm absolutely chuffed to bits that it seems to be geting a grip of my life more than I thought it could those few short years ago when I first mentioned starting comedy, sat with the wife on our sofa in 2010 watching Lee Evans at the O2 on the telly, in our front room.\n\nThank you for reaching the end of this long overview of 2014. As I said at the beginning, it's not really for you but more of a reminder for me of what I've achieved and where I've come and gone to and from :)\n\nThe fact you've come along with me, and seen me at shows, and who knows, maybe even laughed, truly makes it more special, because knowing you're on my wavelength makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, I have something funny to say that others understand: that these silly thoughts in my head aren't only that.....that I'm not on my own.\n\nLife eh? Definitely a barrel of laughs, and mine feels full!\n\n....see you in 2015!\n\n(I hope )\n\nWhen I started planning the big walk from London to Portsmouth, I'll be honest, I was bored this time last year. It's happening again to be honest. September is a quiet time post Edinburgh, before the Autumn and Winter shows kick in, and whilst the grey matter is sat relatively idle after the Edinburgh mayhem (I did 27 shows in 6 days!), I find it hard to switch off.\n\nThis year I went away for 2 weeks to Mexico with Team Alderson - our first family holiday together since I started comedy over 3 years ago - so relaxing was possible, but even then coming home to a quiet house, boys back at school, wife back at work, it still gave me the twitches to start something. I resisted. Sort of. I've set all the dates for the 2015 shows for Comedy All Stars and Spinnaker Tower Comedy Club and set the wheels in motion for South Coast Comedian of the Year 2015. I have a few new projects in hand, but I'm primarily concentrating on my own comedy career for 2015 with some exciting new relationships being forged as I type this.\n\nBut back to the hike....!\n\nIt seemed a great idea at the time, but it quickly transpired that I'd taken on a lot. With 2 weeks to go, most of the famous faces had pulled out of the walk, and all of the cyclists had pulled out (two family emergencies and one broken hip - some people will do anything to avoid being with me!).\n\nI'd been walking upwards of 40 miles a week in training, as had a lot of others, but again, a few 'hiking' comedians seemed very short on training, so that was another worry.\n\nThe big day came, and we met at BT Tower.\n\nDay 1 seemed a breeze to be honest. 4 hours of walking, nice weather, and a Travellodge at the end of it, which I must say was mighty fine. The show went well - 45 people in the audience at Bearcat Twickenham, and we all settled on pizza (carbs are important!) after the show.\n\nLater that night returning to my room, I was pleased that the mixture of heat and pavement pounding had left me with seemingly no blisters. I removed my socks only to find a layer of skin on the balls of my feet came off with it! I'd probably trained for 500 miles minimum, and never much of a blister or cut. Now after the first 15 miles my skin was falling off!! I put on blister plasters and hoped for the best!\n\nDay 2 was interesting. The first blisters had emerged but not bad ones. Nameless comedians who hadnt trained popped in to drug stores to get supplies of creams, ointments and plasters, and the walk slowly melted from London concrete to leafy Surrey tree-lined roads as we exited through Richmond Park. This was a tougher day but the weather was still very kind. Cerys had to leave for a radio show half way through, back in the big smoke, but spirits were high, and the prospect of a busy show that night was uplifting.\n\nI forgot to mention that at each night, we also had sports massage specialists as well, so the idea of this at Guildford was terrific! We stopped for lunch on this day at Sainsburys, and filled our faces, which was becoming a habit. Almost more than drink, we were stopping for treats and cakes and icecream and carb overdoses far too frequently, but it seemed to be working!\n\nOnce again the show in Guildford was a cracker, with a half full room, but still a lovely audience. The Macmillan buckets had bundles of notes in, and our tired muscles were given a boost. I also got to see my wife and boys which was lovely, if somewhat briefly.\n\nIn Guildford, we all stayed in halls of residence. My shower was on a slope, and I only just fitted in it (and I'm not even 6 foot!), so a 'relaxing' hot shower wasnt quite on offer. It smelt a bit as well, but we were greatful for somewhere for free from Surrey University. The next day, as we all sat outside you could tell the aches and blisters were a little more substantial. One of the comedians went off with one of the support cars to find more 'supplies' from a pharmacy, as we all walked into the city for breakfast.\n\nSo far we had managed to get loads of places to donate food and drink for our charity mission. Wetherspoons had offered us discounted breakfasts, one pub gave us water and breakfast bars and let us use their loo even though they were shut. Everyone was very generous. I mean, we all looked like we were about to collapse, and were dressed in bright green Macmillan tshirts, so its hard to be heartless with the state we looked, but still, they were very very kind!\n\nThe Guildford to Petersfield walk was tough. It took us through more hilly terrain, smaller country lanes, and the weather was hot. Blisters were pounding now on a few of the less trained people, and even a few of the tougher walkers, me included, had a blister or two. Blister plasters were very useful, but on hard to reach spots like little toes, they did bugger all!\n\nDuring training, I'd managed to weaken a tear in my muscle wall, where a hernia was threatening to pop, and at this point in the walk, the pain was becoming quite overbearing. I was popping painkillers like they were smarties. Another comedian had ditched his boots, for casual boots, and had now changed into newly bought sandals to give the blisters chance to air/breathe/heal (?), and was walking much better.\n\nArriving in Petersfield was very tough. It took us over the southdowns, and the sun was literally beating down - the longest part of the route, and as we appraoched the rugby club where we were due to perform, half the walkers who we had been left for dust appeared in front of us. They'd found a short cut through a park, and had avoided the 2 mile walk I'd taken the front pack on - I wasnt popular. I blame Google Maps!\n\nIt was a slight panic to get everyone ready in time for the show, as the hotel was 15 minutes drive from the venue and we were relying on one car to ferry us backwards and forwards, but we made it, and the little club house had a lively 35 people to greet us. Luckily my mate Paul was on hand to set up the stage, lights and speakers for us, otherwise we may have died trying to set it up, as our joints and muscles were now truly hurting and burning. The girls seemed to like Paul as well, so that lifted their spirits!\n\nThat night's stay was probably our best. The Premier Inn was superb, and the next morning they gave us all free full english breakfasts, and for our final walk to Portsmouth we were invigorated. It was going to be long, but we were pumped!\n\nFor the final day, I had my own deadline. At 1pm my youngest son was leaving his infant school for good to move to big school, and they were doing a leavers arch that I wanted/needed to be part of. The wife was working so if I wasnt there he'd have no one.\n\nThe walk was going via my village, so we marched off, with the plan to stop for sandwiches and drinks at my house, halfway between Petersfield and Portsmouth. The sun was very hot, and with little tree canopy on the route, we really struggled, but kept up the pace.\n\nEveryone throughout the walk kept asking how long to go, but it was always very difficult. 2 hours left quickly becomes 3 hours when you stop for a drink or the pace slows because of someones blisters, so obviously muggins here was the but of a variety of jokes from the comedians as they strained to work out if their little legs would get them to the next hotel and gig!\n\nRob, who broke his hip, was also sporadically passing us and coming to greet us on his bike, as he completed parts of the journey, as part of his rehabilitation. He also helped ferry people around and prep the shows, and was a great asset to the group. It was often quite a relief when we saw him cycling up, as we knew we were almost there!\n\nI made it to my son's leaving arch, and being at home with the walkers was a surreal but terrific experience. One of the walkers couldnt complete the final day and jumped in Robs car for the second half, and another had bailed the previous day after having to jog along side the walkers, as his feet were hurting so much with blisters and cuts he could barely settle for long on each foot, so bizarrely jogging almost on the spot felt better than walking!\n\nSo the final approach left 5 walkers, one of whom had NO blisters or aches at all, and had spent the entire walk on his phone doing emails and making calls. He's only 24, but needless to say I dont like him any more... :)\n\nAs we walked over Portsdown Hill and saw Spinnaker Tower in the distance, it was a terrific experience.\n\nWar weary and exhausted we continued our march into Portsmouth.\n\nOne thing that continued to surprise us thoughout was the regular bibs we got from the cars, and cheers. Certainly towards the end, there were only a few of us, but still we'd get a few car horn beeps most days, and not just because I was wearing sweaty, dirty tracky bottom shorts!\n\nThe final approach was a relief, and the tower peaking up about the buildings as we entered the city was a contant reminder we'd nearly walked the 100 miles, and our job was done. We had 140 people waiting at the tower for us to do the show, and we ended on a bang!\n\n3 of us sprinted the last 100 yards to the tower, and gave it a big kiss. We'd made it, and we were very, very emotional - and knackered\n\nSold out, and loads of money raised, the show was incredible, and although most of us hobbled onto the stage, and many even had to be helped onto the stage, we were all buzzing, and laughing, and having a great time.\n\nWeeks later when some of us bumped in to one another in Edinburgh, it was emotional. Cliches aside, we really had formed a great bond, going through so many unsusual and challenging situations over those four days.\n\nWe didnt quite raise the money we wanted, but before we even finished, most were talking about doing it again next year. This year seems to be flying by, so I'm not sure how realistic that is, but we did something terrific, had a great time, laughed all the way, and no one fell out once. A real indicator of how super all the comedians were who took part. Great guys and girls, and I was proud to be in the group sharing the hike together.\n\nA big thank you to all of them, and to all the people and businesses who sponsored and supported the events. Hopefully I'll see you at the next one...if there is one!\n\nAs part of my 'foot conditioning' and training for the 100 mile charity walk I'm doing for Mic, Bike 'n' Hike in 3 months time, I've been walking every week, usually testing part of the route before the big week at the end of July!\n\nTypically, I do the school run on my own, as the wife has a 'proper job' so I'd measured and tracked the distance between Denmead, the village I live in, and Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, and it said 6 hours round trip! I would be leaving at 9am from dropping my boys at school and would need to be back by 3:15pm to pick them back up. With no let-up in the pace of walking, and no margin for error, that left me little time even to stop for water breaks and something to eat, but I decided to go for it.\n\nI use a mixture of google and apple maps, on the walking mode, and so far its been perfect and today wasnt any different. I knew where I was going as its my home town, but still, always nice to check that the route actually has pathways for all 16 of us to travel along for the final 10 mile journey. Obviously my journey today would be 20 miles (not including the school run at either end!) as I was walking there and back, but that way I could be doubly sure the route was suitable...and of course condition these delicate girls soles I have under my feet.\n\nFoot conditioning is one of those ridiculous things you read about and think you dont need, but even if you've worked on a shop floor 9-5 for 10 years, nothing prepares you for the relentless slapping of feet on tarmac for 6-7 hours. Often people drag their feet around, or simply stand about and walk a bit from one end of the carpetted shop to the other. Up and down curbs, undulating pathways, and rough concrete and pebbled paths create a whole new stress on the soles of your feet and its important to toughen them up.\n\nAs I set off, the day was meant to be sunny, but as I left the village the air was clogged with mist and fog. A sure sign it would be sunny and hot later, but this was really foggy!\n\nThe time was 9am, and there was quite a lot of traffic on the road, but I kept on stepping, thinking how bloody far I had to go, and would I actually make it back to pick up my boys from school in time!! Within an hour I was climbing the foot of the first hill on the way up Portsdown Hill, which is basically the last edge of the south downs which separates the coast from the countryside. One side of the hill is villages and small towns, and mostly rural farm land, and the other side is the city and beaches.\n\nIt's only when you do these journeys at 4 miles an hour and not 40 that you realise just how undulating the roads and hills are. You also notice the little bits of history along the way. The disused doorway, the graveyard tucked away, the ancient signpost overgrown with ivy and long forgotten. As my journey continued up the hill I began to spot more and more.\n\nI was now walking the old London Road, that originally went (and still does) to London from Portsmouth as the only route.\n\nI continued on to the main hill and this felt tough. I'd walked about 3 miles I guess at this point, and it was warm. Only about 10am, but I was feeling the pressure and I had to keep up the pace, but my right inner sole of my walking boots kept slipping back, and I had already corrected it twice. I'd tightened the laces, but now with the increased temperature as my feet were swelling this was digging in. Slipping inner soles or digging in laces? An exciting multi-choice, I think we can all agree!\n\nAs I reached the peak of the main hill I looked across to where Portsmouth should be and saw this:\n\nIt was like one of those movies where they return to their home city after the end of the world and find just a dust storm and devastation. Portsmouth was completely burried in fog and mist. This happens quite a lot, as Portsmouth is on an island, but I hadn't seen fog and mist quite like this before. Maybe I should turn back? It's probably a sign.\n\nBy the time I had walked down to sea level, the town of Cosham was buzzing, and it was about 10:45am. People were bustling around the shops, and the place was very much alive for a Tuesday morning, but I had places to go, mostly McDonalds for a wee. It's amazing the things you learn from all this walking. One important thing is carry water. As much as your back pack will sensibly take. The second thing is don't wee when you think you need a wee. Your body needs fluids, but give your bladder 15-20 minutes of walking and you'll soon find you dont need a wee! That bladder full of wee has come in handy. Don't ask me where it goes, because I got a B in GCSE science, but it gets used, trust me!\n\nI used the facilities in McDonalds and tutted at the unhealthy individuals, because now I'm so super-fit of course, and walked onto Portsea Island, under the motorway and across the water towards Hilsea, which is the oldest entrance to the city, and until about 50 years ago, the ONLY entrance to the city - amazing! This is where our beloved local paper \"The News\" has its HQ - they will be offering loads of support for our charity walk so I doffed my hat (I was wasn't wearing one!), and went onwards!\n\nI was heartened to see that part of the new signage had dropped away showing the old 70s glittery typograhy of the old sign. Another glimps into the past, which gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. (no it wasnt the wee!). You can see the cool funky 'n' in this picture. It was the sign I remember from when I was young and used to go past this to the school playing fields.\n\nContinuing through Hilsea, I walked past the old bus stop I used to wait at after playing rugby/football/cricket/hockey/cross country/tennis you name it, at Portsmouth Grammar School's playing fields, and past the little newsagent where I'd often stop with my friend Ed Wareham (sadly no longer with us) on my way back from playing sport for the school and off to choir practise (yes I was head chorister of Portsmouth Cathedral Choir when I was 12. Get over it!).\n\nHard to believe that was nearly 30 years ago. It was probably there 30 years before that, but a new big Co-op has recently opened a few yards up the road, where a pub once was, so who knows how much longer it'll be there for. I like to think that quietly at the back of their consciousness, every pub from the late 19th century has always longed to be a Tesco Express or a Co-op Food outlet. Here's hoping!\n\nAnyway, I continued up northern parade, which is a very long straight road built in the late 1800s, early 1900s, when the northern dwellings on the island had started joining with the southern older development. Until the 1850s almost all of the island, and portsmouth as we know it today was just farmland and almost all the development of 'Portsmouth' was around the dockyard right in the south western tip, but with the advent of powered transport, the arrival of the railways, and increased activity in the dockyard thanks to the numerous wars of the 19th and 20th century, the city exploded, sometimes literally. This road was critical I guess to the increased traffic now coming into and leaving the island.\n\nMost of the houses towards to northern tip of the island are 1930s/40s, but every now and again you get a glimps of earlier 19th century buildings, especially as you walk further up northern parade. I like to imagine how this area looked before the developer messed it all up, and before the councils whored the island to the big corporates. What a lovely place Portsmouth must have been before the war, especially. Fields, an airport, farms, docks and coastline all around.\n\nAnyway, the sun was now starting to break, and the dull shape of the yellow circle through the thick clouds was certainly turning up the heat. I kept my hoodie on, as another thing I have learnt is that it may feel hot but when you're covered in sweat and on the open road, just a tshirt can feel absolutely bloody freezing!\n\nI was now walking into Portsmouth city itself, and through a slightly less desirable area. Its always a road that I've felt is tired and been forgotten about. It's near where my Mum used to work, and I always felt the same when I was a kid, back 30 years ago, that the area has been left to degenerate, and nothnig really has changed. They've bulldozed the wonderful characterful dog race track and recently built a park and ride there, and apparently there is more development planned, but still, its such a shame.\n\nGoing back to what I was saying earlier, at the slow pace you can take it so much. I always thought the houses were just run down holes, that were built in the early 1900s at the earliest, but looking closely at the detail and the character of some of them I thought some were older. Many of the pubs (which had so much history, and detail in their architecture) had been taken over and converted into flats, but it was fascinating to think of how they were built out of necessity when the developers first built the estates around there in the early 1900s to service the dockyard workers and tradesmen now living there, who would HAVE to have a pint after work, probably before going to the dog track with their earnings.\n\nLooking closely I noticed some older 'cottages' as they called themselves. They certainly weren't cottages now. Rented out terraced houses, but I could imagine the little houses being stand-alone buildings in the middle of nowhere back in the day. First I spotted a few with 1898 on. Then 1880. Then a few in the 1870s. These were run down houses now, but they were 144 year old buildings with a long and fruitful story to tell I'm sure.\n\nThe ones with the new roof are the oldest, which is almost impossible to tell. I'd usually just drive past these, but on closer inspection they had amazing detail to the door frames and windows, and I bet they were prized properties all those years ago, not run down rented hovels.\n\nI continue my walk, and as you can tell from the picture, it was now steaming. Over 20 degrees, and I was running low on water. My feet were throbbing a little with the heat, but they had swollen as well which had meant the slipping inner sole was no longer a problem. I walked towards the main entrance to Portsmouth and could hear the motorway slipping into the city. A real tangible roar, which must really erode the lives of the people living around it. So powerful.\n\nI came out of the small road I was walking on and arrived at this junction that used to be the main entrance to this part of Portsmouth:\n\nQuite quaint. One way in, one way out (as it is now), and some lovely buildings around it including two large churches, and a vicarage. Quite near the docks, just over 100 years ago these houses would have looked out over the water, but now of course it has been replaced with a bustling ferry port, container port, and motorway.\n\nThis is the new entrance to the city built next door:\n\nFlyover and 9 lanes of motorway entering the city, and still at most times it is gridlocked. The city has grown to the most densely populated in the UK. Much more than London. It's a wonderful place, but this little walk has shown the past and present in two very clear lines.\n\nI walked alongside the motorway (on a seperate path) and it led me to one of the most historical parts of Portsmouth (as far as visitors are concerned anyway!). Old Commercial Road. This is the birthplace of Charles Dickens.\n\nAgain, its an amazing contrast as this amazing historical building and museum backs on to the road shown in the above photograph. Buildings that date back to the 1700s have their gardens and courtyards backing onto a motorway, where once they backed onto the shoreline.\n\nBack in the days when the wife and I had money, we looked at the house next door (the yellow one), and had considered buying it. It would have been lovely to live next to this globally historic building, but it was haunted to hell! The wife and I are pretty in tune with this sort of thing, and often we'll be walking past a building and start walking a bit quicker only to turn to one another and say \"jeese! that place gave me the creeps!\". I remember when we walked around the house, we could smell pipe smoke in one part of the house. It was so weird because the rest of the house was so clean and fresh. As we turned the corner, there was a very old painting of a man smoking a pipe. The owners said it had come with the house, and that it was strange as so many people say they can smell it, but they couldnt. So we jokingly said \"is this house haunted then?\" and he replied \"oh yes!\", like he'd just told us he'd brought us back a bag of sweets from the shop.\n\nWe politely carried on the rest of the viewing but couldnt wait to get out of the house!\n\nThis road is steeped in history, and gets lots of tourists, and it is very quaint..\n\nAll the buildings date from the 1700s and its a conservation area so everything is very well looked after, even though one side has a bloody great motorway behind it, and the other has a very rough run down few streets of council houses behind it!\n\nYou only have to walk another half a mile and you come to the new Commercial Road. As the name suggests, the old commercial road was the original part of town that had stores and some shops, but as the city grew, the road grew with it, and extended. The old part became solely residential, and the new part took over. I know which part I prefer:\n\nI walked around the edge of the shops, and made the final approach to Gunwharf Quays where the Spinnaker Tower is. I could see the tower in the middle distance as I turned the corner, but it was still hidden by the fog and mist, and the ferries and boats were regularly blowing their fog horns, as the docks were drenched in the mist, but mostly I was concentrating on the fact that I was nearly halfway through my walk! Hurray!\n\nI'd seen so many old parts of the city and towns on my walk in, but now I was approaching the oldest part of the island where Portsmouth first started. The dockyard: said by many to date back to the 6th century, but officially recognised from the 11th century in the history books!\n\nThis is the earliest existing entrance to the dockyard - 1711. I've spent many happy school days looking around the HMS Victory, and Mary Rose, and more recently had our wedding meal and party with all our friends and family on HMS Warrior:\n\nI tried to relax and soak it all in, but I knew I had to get back and get the boys. It was midday (which meant I had done the first half in 3 hours and had 3 hours to get back!), but its hard not to pause for a moment when you a) are surrounded by Portsmouth's wonderful coastline and dockyard, and b) when you've finally reached the end of what will be your 100 mile walk in July with 16 other comedians. A few tears will be shed when we see this on 23rd July I'm sure!\n\nI turned on my heels and headed back home. The sun was now beating down, and it was about 12:15, and I checked my sat nav and sure enough, I had to keep my medium pace constant if i was to make it back to the boys for the school run. This was going to be close!\n\nAs I left Portsmouth and walked out towards the waters edge, I had another stark reminder of old verses new. This shot shows the original bridge that took cars over the water onto Portsea Island (and is now part of a car park by the side of the road), and in the distance the new bridge that takes cars beyond this entrance to Portsmouth, and across the water and directly into the city itself, rather than the through the northern part of the island, and northern parade that I showed you earlier. These would have had hanging lamps on when they were first built, and a plaque mark is clearly visible at the base of the first lamp column. It would be lovely to know what it said, but we'll never know I guess. You can just make out the college buildings in the distance. My Mum went to that college and has previously told me she used to walk across from the college at lunch and sit by the water in the break. She'd have to negotiate 8 lanes of motorway now!\n\nOne thing that struck me throughout all of this was how quick you could get around by foot!\n\nI had walked from the edges of countryside to the coast in 3 hours. It takes around 45 minutes on a bad day to drive the route I'd taken. Longer if you hit summertime traffic. It was quite amazing to do. The most stunning demonstration of this for me was that within 90 minutes of me leaving Spinnaker Tower, and Portsmouth, I had this view of the city.\n\nThat's Portsmouth on the horizon and Spinnaker Tower is the point on the right. This is half way up Portsdown Hill. The other striking fact of this part of the route is that 3 lads with their BMXs were casually walking up the hill with me pushing their bikes and chatting, and even though I felt I was stepping it out, I couldnt shake them. They wre barely moving, and I was in full throttle mode. That shows how wrecked I must have been, even though I didnt feel it!\n\nI say didnt feel it. For most of the journey back I had been feeling a little whincing pain behind my toes. In the old days before my hernia operation, I had done LOTS of cross country running, particularly up until 5 years ago, for a period of about 5 years, and I knew instictively that this was blister pain. Now I'd invested in blister socks and they were working brilliantly. I'd invested in expensive boots and they were working brilliantly, However, I hadn't walked in this heat before and I knew the blisters were there. I just darent take my shoes off! This is another thing I'd learnt from the walking and training. Your feet obviously swell during long periods of walking, especially in heat, but never ever take your shoes off. Except for emergencies like messed up inner soles or stones. Even if you're breaking for a few minutes. Getting the buggers back on can be a nightmare, and once you've moulded your soles and shoes to your feet, thats the most comfortable they're going to get. Leave them!\n\nAs I walked up the hill, and past Queen Alexandra Hospital I probably should have stopped at A&E to get my feet tended to, but instead I was distracted by this curious item hidden under the shrubbery.\n\nIt's hard to tell because of all the rubbish and dirt, but this is an old water pump valve, for drinking hence the drain underneath (now also filled with dirt!). This was right by an old disused and now dismantled bridge that ran alongside the road that took a tram from Portsmouth to Horndean in the late 1800s until the 1930s, and lost its use when petrol powered buses became popular. As this was half way up the hill, this could be a pump that was used for filling buckets to fuel the horses, or just for human consumption. Who knows, but yet another example of a time gone by on my little walk, that 99.99% of people never spot or think about.\n\nAs I walked up the hill, I was reminded of the old chalk pits, and caves that line the hill. There are various caves and holes and loads of history from the forts on top of the hill that then used the caves for stores and sesspits etc, and I caught a glimpse of a few on my way up to the top of the hill on the way back. Loads of chalk was cut from these hills over the centuries, and caves have also been cut out of them. Loads of folklore and urban legends fill the booklets and websites about the area, and absolutely tonnes of life filled this area when the hill forts were teaming with soldiers and parades and barracks, but now very little happens on the hills.\n\nThen as I reached the top of the hill, the famous George Inn came into view - a reminder of forgotten times. It's been many things in its lifetime: a stopover for horses, a hotel, but most famously as a hotel and for being a meeting place for many famous admirals and generals over the last 300 years!\n\nThis is right at the crest of Portsdown Hill that runs in parallet to the coastline. Behind it is the hill down to the countryside and infront (behind us in this picture) is a clear view out to see and the city of Portsmouth. This is the hill top road in the fore ground. There are stables and a clock tower towards the back of the pub. A clear sign of its importance for the area, where it has stood since the 1600s!\n\nI had now run out of water, and it was 2pm. It was all downhill from here literally, and I marched over the hill, as so many had done before me as soldiers, to Waterlooville. In fact Waterlooville (as the name would suggest) grew out of the settlement of soldiers who rested there on their way back home after fighting at the Battle of Waterloo. Many rested in the little Hamlet that was there, on returning from fighting, walking back from the docks, as I was doing, and decided to stay. They named it the village of Waterloo, or Waterlooville, and the town is obviously 200 years old next June!\n\nThe hill climb reminded me of a story my Granny once told me when I was a child. She worked in Portsmouth as manager of a hairdressers during World War 2, but they had to move out during the blitz, and she and her parents rented a single room where they lived together for a large portion of the war. This meant my Granny had to then walk from Waterlooville, to Portsmouth every day to work to open the shop and then walk home. She recalled the day during the war when she too had walked over the crest of this hill, just like I had done, probably on the same road, and she heard a deafening roar. She looked up behind her and she said she could barely see the sky, as it was absolutely full of planes. Crammed with planes off to battle.\n\nI often remember this story, and now I had pretty much walked the same path she had done back 70 odd years ago.\n\nI walked downhill towards Waterlooville, thinking of this time. My feet and my blisters had got into a rythmn and didnt seem to hurt as much, but as I glanced into the distance, I could see the main section of the south downs taunting me, as a dark shadow on the horizon, as you can see in this photo.\n\nThe sign said 11 miles to Petersfield.\n\nThat was a stark reminder that today's walk was nothing. Ahead was Petersfield and the south downs, and beyond that was Guildford, Twickenham and the BT Tower. Another 90 miles into the distance. I'd be walking over those hills in the distance in July, before the final approach to Portsmouth that I had just walked. I've tried and tested that route as well, and it is MUCH tougher than the walk I had just done, as you have to constantly walk up and down hills. This view was a reminder of how tough the last leg of this charity walk will be!\n\nI managed to get back to pick up my boys from school in time, but my blisters were so big I couldnt actually see them. I mistook them for the balls of my feet.\n\nToday they have reduced down to very bulbous 50 pence piece sized blisters, but one thing's for sure, I cant get blisters one day and walk another 8 hours the next, so these things need to toughen up.\n\nAnd so do I, I think!\n\nThe history you take in on these walks is fascinating, and I'll soak in as much as I can during training, as one thing's for sure, when I'm walking for 7 and a half hours a day for 4 days, I won't care less about the history then!\n\nYou can donate on justgiving.com/micbikehike or check out more info and donate or buy tickets for the shows via www.micbikehike.co.uk\n\nWe're also on Facebook and Twitter @micbikehike\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nAt the end of the last two years I've written a long overview of my past year and the year ahead. It's mostly cathartic, but as 2013 has seen so many developments for me, and it was my THIRD full year of comedy, I wanted to continue the trend, to remind me more than anyone else what I've done, and what I've failed to do. I know some will be interested, but many wont, and hopefully this long introduction has got rid of those that don't so I dont need to worry about those miserable gits reading stuff they really don't want to....there.....see? They've gone.\n\nSo....2013.\n\nI'd set myself a few targets for the year, and one was to do my own solo show. I did this, albeit only once, but I took it to the Brighton Festival, and had a packed room for the only night I performed it, so that is fine. More than anything, I was delighted when my material came to its conclusion, I looked down, and to my amazement it was 60 minutes exactly.\n\nMy first hour show...\n\nFor me, doing the hour wasnt something I saw as a necessity to further my career, but something of a challenge to see if (in future years) I really could put myelf up on a stage and keep people interested and indeed myself interested long enough to justify me being stood there for 60 minutes!\n\nThe laughs were regular, albeit not always as strong as I'd like based on a circuit set, but a number of people (friends and strangers) commented that it flew by and it didnt seem like an hour. To me, that is brilliant. Theres nothing worse than a comedian's set seeming to drag, and my main aim is to hear this kind of feedback, so I was delighted with the response to my first and only ever hour.\n\nMy second objective of 2013 was to get more telly work. This didnt happen. I went for a few castings, but nothing transpired. However, my Channel 4 debut did finally get its airing, where I appeared for just under 10 minutes on the Channel 4 prank show \"Eye Spy\". It was great to film, and brilliant to see it come together.\n\nIt's official...Channel 4 have said it...\n\nI loved filming it, and being involved with the production which overall took a couple of days. Hopefully I'll get to do more TV stuff, but without an agent, I'm not sure how realistic that is. I'll keep trying though!\n\nMy next ambition for the year was to go to Edinburgh with my show. I was all ready in June to evolve what I'd taken to Brighton and give it it's proper airing in Scotland, but I was disappointed with the venue offer and times presented to me by the organisers of the Edinburgh Fringe, so I sent an email out to promoters saying I was available for any normal circuit gigs in August, and got a heap of gig offers, including performing over a long weekend in Egypt, so I shunned the Edinburgh option once again for another year!\n\nHard at work in Egypt between shows.\n\nI've since found out through other comedians that the time and venue I was offered was a gem, which I should have taken, but my Edinburgh knowledge is zero really, so on reflection, the money was preferred in 2013.\n\nThe final main objective was to get into more weekend clubs. In 2013 I did a couple of half spots at The Glee Clubs, and these went ok. Nothing earth shattering, but hopefully I'll get more shots with them this year.\n\nAnother little spot for the wonderful Glee!\n\nMy recent brilliant tryouts with Jongleurs came to nought when the powers that be only had me down as doing one tryout with them way back in Feb 2011, at the dreadful Portsmouth venue, where I'll be the first to admit I struggled! Since that time I had two corkers with Jongleurs Croydon and Jongleurs Picadilly, and these notes and any record of me appearing at these shows had gone walkies. Bugger!\n\nReluctantly I agreed to do a final try out in front of Donna in March 2014 at Sway, so hopefully this will be the end of the try out runs for Jongleurs. Saying that, more and more of my friends and colleagues have been left owed money by Jongleurs this year, and everyone has been getting very twitchy, but at the end of the day, I know I can cope with Jongleurs gigs, and as long as I'm only doing the odd weekend and not putting all my eggs in one basket, I'll treat the gigs as character building and experience, and presume the money is coming to me some day, but always keep at the back of my mind that it might NEVER arrive. That's what business has taught me, and the comedy world is no different. It's just business at the end of the day.\n\nI am delighted to say though that after a second wonderful try out with Highlight in Camden in front of the lovely Julia Chamberlain, I am getting some weekend dates for 2014. I consider Highlight gigs to be somwhere between an average Jongleurs and an average Glee, and its nice to know that Julia saw me first hand and in her own words \"could keep offering me try outs, but we should be realistic and know I should be getting paid stuff from them now!\". Great feedback, and nice to hear honest industry words.\n\nIn amongst all of these things obviously came the unexpected.\n\nDoing a run of shows in Crete for TED Entertainment and two runs in Egypt as well were all surprises, but luckily they went rather well, and hopefully I'll be returning this year. The shows to children were a challenge, as to be honest they were a juggling act (not literally, although that could have been easier!), between pleasing the parents and grandparents AND the children, as the shows were at 10:30 at night!!\n\nAnyway, the resorts were 5 star, and everything was amazing, and I really do consider the opportunity to be yet another way for me to carve my craft and learn more and more about handling every single type of room thrown at me.\n\nDoing a small show last Christmas in Milton Keynes also meant that I got to be introduced to a friend of Jo Brand, Andy Williamson, who was sat in the audience watching me. He contacted me afterwards in early 2013 and asked if I would like to support Jo Brand in the Autumn. She helps the Air Ambulance raise money by doing a warm up tour show or two for them, and her usual support act was in the states. Obviously I thought about it, for half a second, and accepted the offer. This was an AMAZING experience, mostly because the gig was something completely outside anything I had done before!\n\nMe and Jo Brand. The year's highlight for sure!\n\nMost gigs involve me, and 2 or 3 other comedians. The crowd come to watch comedy, you convince them you're funny as quick as possible, do 20-40 minutes and then leave. Supporting Jo Brand I didnt really think about before hand, but as they entered the theatre it hit me that they were all there to see her. Although they knew I was there to support her, as my name was on all the posters and notices, I was just the side dish. Not even that, A dressing. I had to appeal to her audience. Not convince them I was funny. Convince them I was funny and worthy to support Jo Brand! To cut a long story short, I did. My material actually dovetails nicely with a lot of Jo's stuff, as I like to write about approaching middle age, my other half, and things that frustrate me, and obviously so does she.\n\nMy name in ink....proof!\n\nWe had wonderful chats back stage about our careers (hers as well as mine), our families, and the industry in general, and it felt like I was chatting to an old friend. Really quite endearing to see someone so unaffected by it all, but I personally think thats because she hit fame in the late 80s and early 90s before the 'celebrity' nonsense came to town. She's very grounded, and a real person. Refreshing to experience.\n\nI was also asked to be the sole comedian on a great variety bill at The Kings Theatre as part of the Children In Need Gala in November. This was a great experience. A huge theatre, and a wonderful chance to feel the buzz of a massive crowd. Hopefully I'll get a chance to perform in more theatres in 2014. I've done a few, but The Kings Theatre is something special, especially as my comedy heroes Laurel & Hardy performed there in the mid 1900s!\n\nOn stage at The Kings Theatre\n\nThere were people sat in these seats when I was on....honest!\n\nOn top of all these amazing things I also secured the club I had just started, Comedy All Stars, at the end of last year, with 4 more brilliant shows. It is now going from strength to strength and with an amazing line up exclusively of TV comedians, we are now regularly getting 350 people to every show, which happens once a quarter.\n\nMarch's line-up!\n\nMy aim was to grow the club, which in September 2012 at its first show had 225 people, and every show since has steadily grown to the 350 figure we now enjoy. It's only run by me and the wife, and it's something I wanted to do to secure us financially to put a top on my regular comedy gig earnings.\n\n2 days til the next show.....aaaaand victory!\n\nOn top of this came the opportunity to run a show at Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth. I had approached them at the end of 2012, but they were asking crazy prices for the hire of the tower, but in early 2013 we met again and we carved out a plan, and I am delighted to say that since March I have run a bi-monthly show there again, with big names, but also some up and coming comedians, and me as resident host, and we regularly sell out, which gives me more security to work on my own comedy career.\n\nI've seen many of my friends and colleagues in the industry stress and struggle financially with their career in 2013, and I have been no exception. Many of you will know that before starting a career in comedy I did have a very lucky and secure career with a proper job and my own business, and the one thing I wanted to do with my comedy when I gave up my 'proper job' was get to a point one day where I was earning similar amounts every week/month, and had security. I also wanted the freedom to have family time, and to carve and mould my career with care and without panic.\n\nRunning the two clubs has given me that freedom but more than anything I have worked hard on my profile as a comedian, as I dont want to be known as a promoter. I have made the decision to take over the hosting of Comedy All Stars in June of this year, so that the two clubs I run will also give me the chance to host more, and work directly with the big names I get down to perform. For me that is key. For me to be on stage with them, and for them to get a chance to see me in the light I want, a comedian first and foremost!\n\nIt's only by exposing myself to as many opportunities as possible that I'll get the chance to improve and raise my profile and success in the comedy world. I dont circulate the London clubs, so hopefully with all the activity I do, people will still get to hear about me, and the bookings will continue to come in. So far since I started back at the end of 2010 I have averaged 3 gigs a week. On top of this in 2013 I've also started writing two articles a month for a local magazine and regional paper, and do a weekly guest spot on ExpressFM - a Portsmouth radio station.\n\nIt's me. Coming in your ears!\n\nDuring 2013 I also started up a few extra things to keep me busy. I started writing my book \"My First 2 Years In Stand Up!\", which I wanted to do, again, for my own way of remembering, but also because I regularly get into chats with comedians even newer to this than me, and decided it could be quite useful to some people, as being a comedian is such a lonely job. I've contacted publishers, but may well self-publish, so watch this space!\n\nOne thing I also noticed during my first few years, is that competitions and the circuit in general seems very centred towards London. It's a shame, as at the end of the day its one city, not the universe, and so many agents never leave the underground zones to see comedians. I guess considering that London is where all the talent settles.\n\nIt doesnt, and on top of that, it's very difficult to get to, even for south coast dwellers like me. Even though on a map I'm little more than an inch away from the big smoke, door to door its a 3 hour journey to central london, so with that in mind I decided to start my own comedy competition \"South Coast Comedian of the Year\". By attracting only comedians who live or were brought up in a county on the south coast, we have now got 72 participants, wittled down from around 100, to take part in 9 heats and culminating in a final on 10th July.\n\nOur lovely sponsor.\n\nHopefully I can build this competition, so that the winner will be regarded as the height of new (less than 4 years in the industry) talent to be emerging from the south coast, and that it might possibly even grab the attention of London agents, if only in a small way. We have a comedy consultant from London, and a great TV headline act coming down from the big smoke for the final as judges, so its looking promising. Obviously I am hosting all the heats as well and the final. Couldnt let that slip past!\n\nAnd finally, planned for July 20-23 is a huge charity walk that I have arranged for 16 comedians (including 5 off the telly!), from London to Portsmouth, to raise money for Macmillan Cancer. My brother died of Cancer, and I never felt like I did enough to support and thank the nurses and hospice that cared for him. Indeed I suppose I couldnt do enough to thank them. I certainly wasnt in a position to financially support and donate, but this charity walk will hopefully raise a lot of money and raise awareness of their hard work they do.\n\nSome are cycling a longer route, but most are walking...then talking!\n\nStarting Sunday, we are going to do a show in central London to launch the walk, and then every day walk around 25 miles southwards, stopping each night to do a show, probably crippled with blisters and chaffing thighs, until we reach Portsmouth on the Wednesday evening to wrap the event up with a big finale of all 16 comedians.\n\nThe final line-up!\n\nIt's a massive undertaking that is proving more problematic than I ever imagined, but I am determined to do it, and with some of the other comedians' help I'm sure we can get there, mentally and physically!\n\nI'm obviously also in the middle of writing my new show that will be evolving from my sole show I did in Brighton in 2013, and will be the development of the theme about trying to be healthy and fit as I get older, but a little more specifically about losing weight. I have some possibly brilliant tie-ins with some interested parties about my solo show, so it could mean my short spell up in Edinburgh could be awesome, or it could end up being another brief flirtation with the festival, away from the usual comedy circuit. I went to Edinburgh in my first year in 2011, and although it was interesting, I wasn't completely consumed by it like many comedians are. I'm hoping that in 2014 by taking my own show up there, I'll feel more of a buzz, and that the show will create some interest with agents, but also that I'll get to show more people who love comedy what I'm up to these days.\n\nI just watched a short clip of my stand up from early 2011 and its amazing how far my set and my material has come. It's exciting, and who knows where I'll end up, but I suppose looking at the year ahead, for 2014 I just want more of the same that 2013 gave me. Continued progression, some nice surprises for my career, and more regular high-end show and club appearances.\n\nSpecifically if I had a wish list I'd put:\n\n1) Get signed to a voice over agent\n\n2) Clinch a handful of weekend gigs from each of the 3 main chains, Glee, Highlight, Jongleurs\n\n3) Do 10 days of my solo show in Edinburgh\n\n4) Gig abroad at least once again\n\n5) Enjoy myself\n\nIt's a lot to ask, but hey, you can't be too shy in this industry. There is always someone around the corner shouting louder, doing better or even trying their best to make you doubt yourself or make you feel stupid. In that sense the comedy industry is like every other industry really, except you know that annoying person in your office who is a continual joker, but a little bit unhinged and emotional? That is EVERY person in the comedy industry. You need to take from it what you need, befriend those who you can trust, and keep an eye on everyone else......but more than anything enjoy yourself and try hard, every day.\n\nAs long as I can continue to move up, have fun, spend precious time with my family, and get to enjoy some new experiences along the way, I'll be fine.\n\nThanks for coming along for the ride.\n\n“TIPS ON RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL COMEDY NIGHT”\n\nBy James Alderson\n\nIn my previous life I had a proper job in sales and marketing, and sometimes people in the comedy world can’t believe the effort I go to to promote the clubs I run. Some consider what I do standard, but as so many are surprised at the success of my nights and what I do, I thought I’d put pen to paper and write about my thoughts on running a proper night, in case it helps other clubs get more in the door! Don’t get me wrong…I’m not an expert, and this list isn’t all encompassing. I just thought some ideas might help. There will be lots of other things you can do, and I might do another of these at a later date, if people think it helped in any way.\n\nIn marketing anything, the important thing is to make sure that every single experience your customer has encourages them to want to come back, from the way you answer the phone, the first thing they see when they come into your business, or the way the website helps and welcomes them. The better the experience all round, the easier to resell, and gain a loyal customer who will tell people about your club.\n\nHere are my tips in no particular order, on building a successful comedy night:\n\n1) List every single show you do on EVERY SINGLE event-listings website. These are free! BritEvents. Eventful. Wherecanwego. Skiddle. Ents24. Remotegoat. There are loads. And obviously every single local council event site. Just Google 'things to do in your town' and whatever websites come up with listings, get your shows on there as well! It takes me about an hour for every show to list them all properly with images and ticket links, but probably 75% of all my audiences these days come from typing in 'comedy show Portsmouth' etc. and we’re talking 400 people to some shows, so it’s worth doing!\n\n2) Make sure that every piece of marketing material from a Facebook update and a Facebook listing, to posters right through to event listings on websites are ALL properly spellchecked, and grammatically clear. Nothing puts off someone more than if they think they're dealing with a top class business and then the wording doesn’t make sense, has badly spelt words or just isn't clear. Not only that, but ensure that EVERY piece of marketing blends with the other (you’ll see a common trend on all Comedy All Stars promotion as you read through this guide). If they all match in design and style, then everyone that sees your marketing efforts will be certain what show its for, and what club it’s for. You want to build a blanket of marketing to catch people at every opportunity, and build their confidence in you and your show. By ensuring everything you do matches, you make sure they’re DEFINITELY getting the message!\n\n3) Get your local newspapers on board. They are always desperate for articles these days, so every time you have a show, get the newspaper to interview you, an act or just write a piece about it. Of course make sure your event is also listed in their entertainment guide and event calendar in the newspaper. Also, don’t under value those little free directories that get pushed through your door either! Again they are always looking for editorial and always have a calendar of events in for the local community – get in there, so that the 10,000 doors they drop through feature your show! Next time that little book is read whilst they’re on the loo, they’ll read about your club!\n\n4) Make sure there is somewhere in town, other than just the venue and online that people can get tickets. Not everyone wants to travel to a venue slightly out of town to get tickets, and not everyone wants to use their credit card online. Find somewhere popular, and central in the nearest main town (or village), like a newsagent or cake shop, that (for £1 commission a ticket or something similar) will sell your tickets, and obviously put a few posters up saying “TICKETS ON SALE HERE NOW!”.\n\n5) Put leaflets in every single fast food and takeaway place within a 5 mile radius of the gig. Further if you can. It’ll take you one evening of driving around but it’s SO worth it. DON’T put leaflets in shops or pubs. They get ignored. Put posters in the windows of as many shops as will allow, and every newsagent (they usually charge £1 a week for an A4 poster). No one is more bored than a hungry person waiting for Chicken Chow Mein, so a pile of comedy leaflets is perfect. Much better than reading a 3 year old copy of Hello Magazine. I never sold any tickets from leaflets when I put them in pubs, but from the very first night I put them in fast food takeaways, I saw a marked increase, especially every following Friday, Saturday and Sunday!\n\n6) Get your local radio to announce the event or go on local radio to talk about it, or phone in. Or even better, get one of your acts, especially if they are well known, to do a 5 minute phone interview with the DJ. Offer the station 10 tickets to give away. This is SOOOO much better than giving cheap tickets away on Groupon.\n\n7) DONT USE GROUPON OR LIVING SOCIAL. Everyone knows these days now that Groupon is a last resort to get rid of something that doesn’t sell. It sends a bad message to your audience. Yes, it helps market something to a wider audience, and maybe attracts them short-term, but why devalue your brand and reduce profits? Instead of Groupon, just use a giveaway of tickets in newspapers, radio, local directories and online to spread the word instead. It makes you look really generous, rather than something which smacks of desperation.\n\n8) For every single line up have an MC, a strong opener, 2 middle shorter (in time not height) new acts, and a strong closer. That is pretty much the maximum for any gig. If it's a full pro line-up then an opening act, a middle act and a closing act, all doing 20-25 each. No more. People get bored, and at the end of the day you’re not selling Tesco stack ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap. People want quality if you’re convincing them to spend money, and taking them away from their sofa and Mock The Week on the telly!\n\n9) The MC shouldn't be a circus entertainer. They don’t need to juggle, fire breathe or do back flips! The job of an MC is simply to talk to the crowd, and prime them for a great night, and make the room as easy as possible for the comedians that follow to storm the show and want people coming back! The MC should talk to as many people in the crowd as sensibly possible, with some witty banter, relax everyone, a few giggles and some very small doses of jokes if needed, and obviously take them through the rules. The comedians need the MC to actually interact with the crowd rather than just standing there doing a routine (or juggling!), as they can sometimes pick up tips and audience member names for material or banter and the crowd feel continually engaged.\n\nAfter the MC does 10 minutes of that, the Opener does 20-25 minutes. Then a break of 10 minutes. Then the MC for 5 minutes, the first new act for 10, a few minutes from the MC (if the room needs it!), another 10 from the second new act and then a final 15 minute interval. 5 minutes from the MC before bringing on the headliner to then do whatever he thinks is needed - 25-35 minutes usually.\n\n10) Start the show at 8pm. Doors at 7pm so the bar sales go well – the venue will love you for that, as will the drinkers. Generally don't serve food. Food before a show is OK, but even then it tends to make the audience sleepy and lethargic for a good hour and a half or two! Not great for laughing. Especially with a full stomach! And keep the intervals TIGHT! Nothing worse than an audience getting leathered in a long interval and struggling to get the crowds back in, as they’ve been smoking in the car park for 25 minutes! Often if you do that, you lose audience members who go home during the second interval….be strict and (if necessary) firm with the crowd to get them back to their seats.\n\n11) Put road signs up if you can, or find local businesses with road side barriers and fencing to put signs and banners on. The cost of a decent sized sign or banner is less than £50 and these can last a good 12 months. All you then need to do is change the date with a laminated stuck on adjustment each time, for the cost of £1. Then you’ve got a focussed, geographically specific advert to attract the locals, and all in return for a few free tickets to the business that let you put the sign up - remember how generous you are?\n\n12) Wear branded shirts/tshirts. Customers love to know where they are. They much prefer the relaxed look of a branded polo shirt or tshirt than a suit or formal shirt. It's a comedy night remember? I even get the bar staff wearing our tshirts. It makes the audience think they're in a proper club, even though they're often in a college/community centre/function room!\n\n13) Get everyone's emails and tell them they'll get special deals. Then once every couple of weeks send out genuine deals and sneak exclusive news about future shows. They’ll then value the emails - unless you send them out with general nonsense and blurb that everyone knows about. Make them exclusive, and give tickets away if you want. Generous, but not Groupon stupid!\n\n14) See point 4!!!! By selling tickets at a shop (or two!) in town, this will almost certainly give you cash for the night to pay comedians. The online sales can then be your money, and by paying the comedians cash on the night it keeps the industry happy, comedians happy, and your cash flow happy!\n\n15) Don't make promises on line-ups that can’t be backed up. I never say \"some of the best comedians on the circuit!\" unless they really are. It devalues your brand because if the audience really don’t enjoy the night, or don’t enjoy a few comedians, they'll start to wonder whether you know what you're doing booking rubbish acts that you are selling as \"some of the best comedians in the UK\" etc etc. Those customers won’t come back. Ever.\n\nwww.comedy-allstars.co.uk\n\n16) Get a website! One can easily be set up for less than £50 on yola.com or similar. They don’t have to be singing and dancing, just clean, fun and easy to follow. Make sure the online ticket link is live and on EVERY PAGE of your website as well as info about where people can buy tickets in person! Set up a twitter feed into the site (again it’s simple, if I can do it!), and you're away. It's a bare minimum these days.\n\n17) Put signs on your cars. Your brothers, your parents, your girlfriends. Just a little magnetic sign on the back to promote your clubs or specific nights. It's amazing how many people I find reading my signs when I return to my car after the shopping! How often do you get stuck in traffic and laugh at a bumper sticker or notice something they have on their car. Usually it’s rubbish, but imagine what reaction you’ll get if it’s about a super comedy night locally. They cost about £10 each tops, and last forever (just change the date yourself each time with a laminated sticker over the top)! Then make sure you park your car in obviously noticeable places in car parks where ever you go. Having 3 or 4 cars driving around the town with your club details and comedy night dates on is worth its weight in gold!\n\n18) Don't book shit acts! Even if they'll do the gig for free, it's just not worth it, if you’re charging £10 to get in! It diminishes the chance of getting the audience back. Short term gain, long term loss. THIS is the reason in my opinion comedy clubs start well and then lose momentum. People will lose faith in your nights because you have rammed them full of free acts and then a big headliner. They got bored of the rubbish acts, didn’t hang around for the headliner because of long intervals, and never see what they had really paid for, and leave thinking it wasn't worth it, never to return.\n\nBook acts that you can have for free that probably are starting to get paid work, if you want (as the middle acts obviously!) for one or two shows, and use this to see if they're as good as the clip they sent you. If they are, move them up to open or MC. Always view at least one or two video clips of someone, ask around, and check references. If you offer progression then comedians will like your club more. AND the audiences will value the night more knowing you've obviously vetted the acts.\n\n19) Make sure every night has a spot light at the stage, a stage (even if it’s just a few pallets covered in a black cloth!), a decent sound system/pa, and that all seats face the front, ideally in my opinion with little cabaret tables and candles on, or just rows with some leg space. It makes a world of difference for the gig to feel intimate. The lights need to be completely off, including the bar lights, and the fruit machine! At worst on a really low dim light so the audience can't see each other in fluorescent strip lights! They need to feel like they're in a comedy club not a show room!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/m4aFckEbakI\n\n20) Get quotes from comedians and audience members about your night, and film a few short bursts of your club to demonstrate how lovely it is, and how much fun everyone is having and then put it all together on a short YouTube video. Nothing better than people seeing first hand before they book how great your club is, and reading that 10 people loved the night and are coming back, or that 6 famous comedians agree that your nights are the best in the area.\n\n21) Contact your local college, and speak to their work experience liaison. Most colleges do hospitality and events management these days, and they really appreciate the chance for students to get experience. Imagine your club with 4 extra happy friendly young faces with your club logo on a tshirt helping people to their seats, helping with directions to the bar, toilet, car park etc. A great image, and for the sake of a few drinks for the students, and obviously they get work experience and a free show, you get free staff!\n\n22) Attend networking events for businesses. You’ll be amazed how work colleagues socialise together – I know…weird. Not only that, but bosses sometimes take their staff out for Christmas parties and special anniversaries, so spreading the word to businesses is very important and having the chance to speak in a focussed 2 minute speech to 70 businesses at a network event (and usually just for the cost of £5 and including a meal) is a brilliant opportunity! Also, business people are normal people too with normal lives. You never though, they may bring mates to your show after seeing you at a business event, or even their family! Wow!\n\n23) Think of different ways that don’t break the bank to promote your night. People often scoff, but I put up big displays at car boot sales. For £6 I get my vehicle with graphics, and exhibition stands and tables with tickets, posters and flyers in front of 1000s of passers-by for 5 hours, on a Sunday morning. Where else can you get that kind of exposure locally for that kind of money?? Not only do I sell tickets, but that night I ALWAYS sell tickets online.\n\nSimilarly, have you thought about some posters in unusual places? Community notice boards? Toilets? Staff notice boards. Places people don’t expect to see a comedy club promoted and it catches their attention. When you grab attention, you grab interest and you are remembered. Think up ways you can get your club remembered, and you’ll sell tickets.\n\n24) It might sound like a lot of effort, but as mentioned above, staff notice boards are very handy to grab groups of work friends and generating group bookings. Every single business on every single industrial estate gets a poster dropped into their reception before every show I do. It takes me about one full day to do this, dropping a leaflet into every shop, store and company in the local area, but I know that quite a few make it into staff rooms, and it’s lovely to turn as I leave a reception area and I see people huddle around the leaflet and chat about wanting to go to it, AND I get to shed some weight at the same time!\n\n25) Where ever possible, try to get your night shortly after pay day! It sounds simple and maybe a bit too basic, but most people feel skint, even the rich ones, halfway through the month, so having the show in the first week of the month really can impact on sales. For example, if I put my night ON payday, I find we sell a lot online on the day and quite a few more than usual buy tickets on the door. If I put the night a week after pay day, we sell lots more of our tickets in that final week online, but almost none on the door.\n\n26) Make sure there is a decent price difference between advance sales and door sales. We sell 98% of our sell out tickets before the show. That’s 340 of the 350 or 130 of the 135 at our other club. That’s before the night even starts. How great would that feel? That’s because the tickets are £10 in advance or £15 on the door or similar. If you charge £5 in advance or £6 on the door, that’s not enough to convince people to buy early. Early advanced sales give you security, and confidence before the night arrives, to push harder, work harder, and be happier!\n\n27) Make sure you have an active Twitter and Facebook page. Put little clips up of the acts (not too much – don’t give away ALL their material!), and put up images of the acts that might mean something, like a show they’ve been on, or them winning a competition or in the press, and keep the pages updated. Also list the event on Facebook, by all means to help raise awareness, BUT NEVER EVER USE THIS AS A GUIDE FOR WHO IS GOING TO THE EVENT. We normally have 4 people going on our Facebook event. I’d panic if I relied on that. Use it merely as a way to convince that extra person who wasn’t coming. It’s just one very, very tiny way to spread the word. Not the only way…\n\nThere is only one way you truly know who is going to an event, and that is by who turns up! Even when I’ve sold 350 advanced tickets for a comedy night, we always have 10 that don’t come. That’s fine, because they’ve paid for a ticket, but don’t think for a second that by clicking “going” on a Facebook page it’s a guaranteed sale or even close! It almost certainly isn’t. This is why the whole advertising and marketing mix I’ve listed above is critical to get those advanced tickets sold!\n\n28) Give your event TIME to sell. There is no point putting an event on Facebook or a ticket site, or a poster up a week before hand. That’ll almost NEVER work. I heavily promote my shows for 2 months in advance usually. Normally all the year’s events are at least listed on the ticket site, and that way if people have birthdays coming up, they can check the dates and book their night out ahead. You might not have all the acts confirmed, but list who you have, obviously after getting the dates confirmed with the venue, and crack on!\n\n29) Tell people where the show is! Put some arrows and signs up to direct people to the show. Nothing too heavy – you don’t want the local council and busy-bodies complaining, but something functional. Also make sure you take down the signs promptly after the show. Not only will it look helpful, but it will act as a reminder to those who are yet to book tickets.\n\n30) Lastly, enjoy yourself. Smile, at every opportunity. Remember you’re promoting a comedy night. Talk, laugh, mingle, joke. Whether you realise it or not, everything you do when you’re out promoting your night reflects directly on whether people book tickets. Forget the acts, and the rest of your promotional effort. If you walk in and dump leaflets, or answer the phone like it’s a call from your ex, then you lose the sale instantly. Going right back to my first comment, you are the show. You represent it at every turn, so have fun, enjoy the ride, and look forward to a great night!\n\nHOPE THAT HELPS! IT’S NOT EASY, BUT IT’S GREAT FUN, AND THE HARD WORK IS WORTH IT!\n\nI remember the day very well...the Edinburgh email came in...venue options and times - I was disappointed. Since then I've discovered that the times I had been offered were actually prime, and the times I wanted were stupid, but hey, you live and learn.\n\nAnyway, to cut a long story short, I decided that I was going to earn a crust during August, and not just eat them, so forgot all about Edinburgh. I emailed a bunch of promoters and got a handful of gigs booked in that already made me think I'd made the right decision.\n\nThen after quite a busy first week of August gigging I was at the Southsea show promoting my own club, Spinnaker Tower Comedy Club, when I got a random text \"Long shot, but are you free tomorrow and Monday?\". Looking at who the promoter was, I had a good idea what he was asking. Sure enough a few texts backwards and forwards clarified that someone had pulled out of the Egypt shows (worried about the riots), and they needed me to get back out to 'fill-in'!\n\nI had no shows for the Sunday and Monday so there I was, less than 18 hours later on a train to Gatwick, flying out to one of the hottest places on the planet.\n\nThe days I was there it topped 50 degrees. Free food and drink, and this time I got one of their luxury rooms to stay in, rather than staff quarters. It really is a delightful job to do.\n\nOne reason some acts avoid this particular gig is that on the Monday evening you do two shows: one to children (at 10:15pm!) and one to adults at 11:15pm. The adult gig is a dream, just like a typical circuit gig, but the kids show is a bit tough, to say the least. 50 children high on a week's worth of free Coca-Cola and ice cream, and 150 parents and grandparents wishing they hadnt had to come with the kids, whilst sat burnt to a crisp.\n\nThe first venue is massive, that could easily hold 1000 with the right seating, but they spread it out to seat a few hundred.\n\nThis is a shot before the people were sat down by the way - this would have been an even tougher room. The gig went ok. The opening act Kane Brown, did a cracking job of just MCing through his 20 minutes, as by his own admission he didnt have any material for kids, but that was easily the right thing to do. He threw in a few safe jokes, but essentially he chatted his way through the set with numerous big laughs and a few applause breaks. My set was received less warmly, but I did enough.\n\nI never like that experience: just doing enough to avoid a promoter's scorn, but some gigs aren't always 'smashable', and this was one for me. Kane certainly has the mileage behind him in this game to generate the laughs from nothing, and my material was safe, had some child friendly stuff, and I did a few bits of banter to involve the parents, but as the manager says every time I see her \"That was fine. You were good, don't worry - every comedian hates doing this show and finds it tough!\". I wouldnt say I hate it, it's just a massive challenge to engage such a diverse audience of 2 year olds up to 80 year olds.\n\nThe second gig as expected was a beaut. Once again Kane smashed it, and pleased to say I wasn't left as much in his wake this time. Much more comfortable, and some great chats with the audience and a really lovely room to play.\n\nI returned to the UK the early hours of Wednesday morning, and thanks to the knob'ed lady guard at Gatwick train station, arrived in Worthing at 1am. I know. I don't live in Worthing. Luckily my Dad was still up so the superstar came to save me from a £100 cab journey, and drove the hour to pick me up and get me back home.\n\nLess than 48 hours later and I was off to headline Farmer Phil's Festival in Shropshire.\n\nOne of the benefits of not doing Edinburgh is that ANY opportunity that arises or is offered I could pretty much grab, having only half a dozen gigs in the diary at the start of the month. This festival headline spot was offered before Egypt, and before being offered the headline spot at Newquay's Boardmasters Festival the night after was booked in!\n\nNow the more astute amongst you will see the geographical challenge that this represents.but hey, Farmer Phil sounded like a decent chap.\n\nThe journey took 6 hours. Now that is pretty long, but when you get to the main town where the festival is based after 5 hours and that the satnav says the festival is just 4 miles away, you starts to feel relief that you're finally there. No. No. You are not there....\n\nTo put it in perspective, the dark strip in the middle of this track is where my wheels went either side of. It's less than a single track, on the edge of a cliff (which the handy reflective post is protecting me from in the picture): the track is two way, surrounded by sheep, and weaving around rocks and blind cliff corners. It was horrific. Those who have been a passenger in my car and know me well, know that I've driven many millions of miles in my various careers, and passed my test 20 years ago. Never has a journey been so nerve racking, especially as my 100 miles left of fuel diminished to 25 miles very quickly as I climbed the various hills on this track.\n\nFinally I found the festival, and first things first.....it wasn't a festival. Well. it was, but this was like nothing I had ever seen, and I've been to a few festivals in my time!! This was the first day of the festival, from what I could tell, and the 'farm' was basically a huge muddy car park and tents on mud, some trees, and a few awnings put up for stages, some toilets with no lights, and some hand made products scattered around for selling. It could have been mistaken for a fracking protest, that's all I'm saying.\n\nAnyway, I met up with a few of the lads also on the bill, Ash Frith and Justin Panks, who looked just as scared as me. We shared some grunts about what we had got into, and then they persuaded me to look in the purple tent we had been 'assigned' for the show. It was a disco in a small tent, like you'd get at someone's posh garden party - there was Rob Coleman and Mark Rough. No seats, no bar, no space really, and with 20 minutes to go, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers were doing a grand job of making sure no audience would come and if they did, they wouldn't hear.\n\nWe congregated in a comedian-cluster and stuck together to make sure none of us were picked off by the festival goers: you know....a bit like penguins in a snow storm. It was now 9pm and no one had come over to start our show, and the DJ in our tent was making sure the handful of people who had arrived for comedy were having a really good time dancing - I know...let's stop that fun and dancing, and make them sit on the wet grass and listen to us. That'll work!\n\nWe hunted down the organiser as a pack and SHE asked how our show was going. As all the comics involved in the show looked at each other, we all clarified that it hadn't started as we were all talking to here, and no one had come over to sort it. Anyway, Ash Frith hosted the night and got it off to a good start, and the 20 under-10 year olds at the front sat cross legged didn't seem to care when he said \"this is an adult show, so any parents need to be aware\". Obviously the parents were either off their tits on Ketamin or too stoned to realise, so the children stayed, and to the comedians credit, one by one they did their stuff, and ignored the kids. Bizarely, because of the spotlights, even as the crowd grew, from the stage, we could only see the children, so it was rather bizarre.\n\nThe crowd ebbed and flowed, but once the music stage stopped, slowly the tent filled. Justin went on before my closing set, and the kids were in full-throng, sat discerningly at the front whilst he did some of his final jokes about jizzing in a girls eye - to be fair he did a great job. Good on him as well. You can't go into thee things half-arsed.\n\nEven as a parent, I can honestly say that when a comedian has been booked for an adult festival comedy tent at 10pm he/she should do his job. Every comic did what he was booked to do, and if the parents don't care, then so be it. At this point though, the lady sat front right in the picture (above) had had enough and voiced her disgust. Aiming her desperation at poor Ash she said we should get the kids out of here. How a comedian leading 15 young children out of a tent at 10:15pm into a dark"
