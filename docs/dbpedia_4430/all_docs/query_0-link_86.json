        "text": "The uniform election date in May of an even-numbered year is a date on which many local political subdivisions, such as cities, school districts, and water districts, have their regular general elections for members of their governing bodies or special elections to fill vacancies. Therefore, this calendar is required to meet the needs of many diverse governmental bodies.\n\nHouse Bill 357 (88th Leg., R.S., 2023) amended Section 2.025 of the Texas Election Code to require the Secretary of State to set the runoff date for all runoff elections resulting from an election held on a uniform election date. Pursuant to Section 2.025, the Secretary of State has designated Saturday, June 15, 2024 as the election date for all runoff elections resulting from elections held by local political subdivisions on the May 4, 2024 Uniform Election Date.\n\nIf there are questions about the applicability of something in this calendar to your specific election, do not hesitate to call the Elections Division of the Office of the Texas Secretary of State at 1-800-252-VOTE (8683).\n\n1. Note on Campaign Information\n\n2. Note on Statutory and Administrative Code References\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Texas Election Code. The county election officer is the county clerk, the county elections administrator, or the county tax assessor- collector, depending on the actions of the county commissioners court. (Secs. 31.031, 31.071, 31.091). The county voter registrar is the county clerk, the county elections administrator, or the county tax assessor-collector, depending on the actions of the county commissioners court. (Secs. 12.001, 12.031, 31.031, 31.071).\n\nAny references to the Texas Administrative Code are cited to the relevant section of the “T.A.C.”\n\n3. Note on Web Posting Requirements\n\n4. May Uniform Date (Even-Numbered Years)\n\nWith few exceptions, counties are not authorized to hold an election ordered by county authority on the May uniform election date in an even-numbered year. A county elections administrator may refuse to provide election services by contract for an election that is held on the May uniform election date in an even-numbered year. (Sec. 41.001(d)).\n\n5. Required Use of County Polling Places\n\n6. Notice of Candidate Filing Periods\n\n7. Joint Election Requirement for School Districts\n\n8. Joint Elections Generally\n\nMany entities will have joint elections for the May 4, 2024 election. Note that the entries in this calendar are generally written in terms of elections held individually rather than jointly.\n\nDepending on the plan, different entities may choose not to hold early voting together and to do things separately. Not all joint election plans are alike. With a few exceptions, we do not discuss the impact of coordinating rules for a joint election, as we think this would make the calendar longer and confusing. We encourage joint election partners to read through the entire calendar, taking note of the rules affecting the partner entities, and to address the differences within the agreement itself. If you have questions about how different rules apply to a particular joint election plan, please contact our office by phone or email.\n\n9. Notice of Elections\n\n10.

Note on Ordering The Runoff Election and Notice of Election\n\nOur office recommends ordering your runoff election and any extended weekday or weekend voting as soon as the final canvass has been completed due to the short timeframe between the May 4, 2024 election and the June 15, 2024 runoff election. Additionally, if possible, we recommend that a local political subdivision issue the notice of election immediately after the runoff election is ordered.\n\nNotice of a runoff election must be posted on the website of the political subdivision that ordered the election no later than the 15th day before election day, Friday, May 31, 2024. If the political subdivision does not maintain a website, the notice must be posted on the bulletin board used for posting notices of public meetings. (Sec. 2.026).\n\nThe general rule is that, additionally, notice must be given using one of the following methods:\n\nBy posting a notice in each election precinct in which the election is to be held on or before the 15th day before the election, Friday, May 31, 2024. (Secs. 2.026, 4.003(a)(2)).\n\nBy publishing the notice at least once between the 30th day and the 10th day before the election, Thursday, May 16, 2024 – Wednesday, June 5, 2024. (Sec. 4.003(a)(1)).\n\nBy mailing a copy of the notice to each registered voter of the territory covered by the election, not later than the 10th day before election day, Wednesday, June 5 2024. (Sec. 4.003(a)(3)).\n\nCities and School Districts: Cities and school districts are required to publish their notice in a newspaper in accordance with Section 4.003(a)(1) (See number 2 above) and may also give any additional notice. (Sec. 4.003(c)). If a county maintains a website, the county must post any notice of a runoff election provided to the county by a political subdivision conducting a runoff election in the county to the county’s website no later than the 15th day before election day, Friday, May 31, 2024. (Secs. 2.026, 4.003(b)). If the county does not maintain a website, school districts and cities must also post a copy of the notice on the governmental bulletin board used for posting notice of public meetings no later than the 15th day before election day, Friday, May 31, 2024.\n\nNOTE - Section 4.003 requires that counties post on the county website the notice and list of polling locations of any political subdivision that delivers their notice to the county under Section 4.008. This is regardless of whether the county is contracting with the entity.\n\nNOTE - Section 4.004 requires the notice of election to include the Internet website of the authority conducting the election.\n\nNOTE - Section 83.010 requires an election order and the election notice to state the early voting clerk’s official mailing address or street address at which the clerk may receive delivery by common or contract carrier, if different, phone number, e-mail address, and the Internet website, if the early voting clerk has an Internet website. (Sec. 83.010).\n\n2. Note on Testing and Ballot Programming\n\nDue to the short timeframe between the canvass of the main election and the date of the runoff election, our office strongly recommends that your local political subdivision finalize the ballot programming and conduct your Public Logic & Accuracy testing as soon as possible after the main election has been canvassed and the runoff election has been ordered.\n\nThe Public Logic and Accuracy test must be completed no later than 48 hours before voting begins on a voting system used in the election. The last business day to conduct your public Logic and Accuracy testing is Friday, May 31, 2024. However, it is strongly recommended that such testing be completed as soon as possible after the ballot programming is finalized to allow time for corrections to programming, if necessary.\n\n3. Note on Recounts\n\nThe deadline for submitting an expedited recount petition for the main election is 2 p.m. of the second day after the date of the local canvass. It is possible that the timing of the recount may impact ballot preparation for the scheduled runoff election. As such, it is strongly recommended that the entity complete the requested recount in a timely manner following the submission of a recount petition. (Secs. 212.083, 212.089).\n\nIf an expedited recount is requested for a main election that may result in a runoff election, the recount committee members must continue performing their duties on days that are not regular working days and during hours that are not regular working hours if necessary to complete the recount in time to avoid interfering with the orderly conduct of the scheduled runoff election. (Sec. 212.089).\n\nBecause the June 15, 2024 runoff election occurs soon after the May 4, 2024 election, we recommend canvassing the May election as soon as possible to allow adequate time for your entity to prepare for the June runoff election.\n\nCalendar of Events\n\nDecember\n\nMonday, December 18, 2023 (30th day before Wednesday, January 17, 2024, first day to file an application for a place on the ballot)\n\nCities, Schools, and Other Political Subdivisions: Post Notice of Deadline to File Applications for Place on the Ballot (PDF) in a building in which the authority maintains an office.

(Sec. 1.007).\n\nNOTE - Candidates will need to provide an indication on their candidate application that the candidate has either not been finally convicted of a felony, or if so convicted, has been pardoned or otherwise released from the resulting disabilities. A person who has been convicted of a felony will need to include with the application proof that the person has been pardoned or otherwise released from the resulting disabilities. The application form must include a statement informing candidates of the requirement to submit this information. Further, the official application form will need to include a statement informing candidates that knowingly providing false information on their application related to their final felony conviction status is a Class B misdemeanor. (Secs. 141.031, 141.039).\n\nNOTE - School Districts: In addition to the general felony rule at Election Code Sec. 141.001 (finally convicted), a candidate for school board must not have been convicted (finally convicted or otherwise) of specific crimes under the Education Code in time to serve.

(Secs. 84.001(e), 84.007, 86.0015).\n\nMonday, January 15, 2024 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day)\n\nWednesday, January 17, 2024 (30th day before Friday, February 16, 2024, regular filing deadline for a place on the ballot)\n\nFirst day to file an application for a place on the ballot or a declaration of write-in candidacy. (Secs. 143.007, 144.005, Election Code; Secs. 11.055, 130.082(g), Educ. Code). See Candidacy Filing outline for more details.

You do not need to order your general (regularly occurring) election in order for the filing period to begin.\n\nNOTE - The delivery, submission, or filing of an application with an employee of the filing authority at the authority’s usual place for conducting official business constitutes filing with the authority. (Sec. 1.007)\n\nNOTE: Most elective offices now require that a candidate be a registered voter of the territory that the office is elected from as of the filing deadline or as of other statutory deadlines. (Sec. 141.001). For more information on the candidate voter registration requirement, see Voter Registration Requirements for Candidates.\n\nNOTE - Cities, Schools, and Other Political Subdivisions: There are political subdivisions that do not have office hours on all days of the business week (Monday through Friday) or do not have an office that is open for eight hours each day of the business week. The Elections Division recommends that political subdivisions take steps to have someone available for a few hours most days during the candidate filing period to accept filings, and that political subdivisions post a schedule on their websites and on the bulletin boards where notices of meetings are posted of the days and times when someone will be available to accept filings.\n\nThe Elections Division also strongly recommends having someone available at the place of business on the filing deadline, especially from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, if you are otherwise closed. This guideline is based on the office-hour rule under Section 31.122 of the Election Code. Although a political subdivision may accept applications by mail, fax, or email without a person present at the office, the political subdivision will not be able to determine which applications were timely filed by 5:00 PM.\n\nNOTE - Candidate applications, other than those that must be accompanied by a filing fee, may be filed via email. The application must be a scanned copy of the candidate application and must be sent to the filing authority’s designated email address for accepting applications. (Secs. 143.004, 144.003).\n\nWednesday, January 31, 2024 (last weekday before February)\n\nRecommended date that county election officials and local political subdivisions meet to discuss conducting elections at the same polling locations pursuant to Section 42.002, as well as any applicable joint election issues needed to be agreed upon.

(Sec. 145.094(a)(1)).\n\nNOTE: Section 145.098 states if a candidate dies on or before the deadline for filing an application for a place on the ballot, the authority responsible for preparing the ballots MAY choose to omit the candidate. If the authority does choose to omit the candidate, the deadline for filing an application for a place on the ballot is extended to the fifth day after the filing deadline, Wednesday, February 21, 2024. This extended deadline only applies to the regular filing deadline. It DOES NOT apply to the write-in deadline.\n\nFriday, February 16, 2024 (78th day before election day)\n\nPolitical Subdivisions Other Than Counties: 5:00 PM - Last day for a candidate in a political subdivision (other than a county) to file an application for a place on the ballot for general election for officers for most political subdivisions, except as otherwise provided by the Texas Election Code.

See Candidacy Filing outline for more details.\n\nNOTE - The delivery, submission, or filing of an application with an employee of the filing authority at the authority’s usual place for conducting official business constitutes filing with the authority.

Currently, the Election Code does not establish a deadline for appointing election officials; there is only a notification deadline. For further information concerning procedures for appointing judges and their alternates, see Sections 32.005, 32.008, and 32.011. General eligibility requirements are found in Subchapter C, Chapter 32. In addition to appointing a judge and alternate judge for each election precinct pursuant to Sections 32.001 and 32.005, the governing body must allow the judge to appoint no less than two clerks; however, the alternate judge must serve as one of the clerks as a matter of law. (Secs. 32.032, 32.033). The presiding judge then appoints an additional clerk(s), but not more than the maximum set by the governing body. (Sec. 32.033). Presiding judges and their alternates must be given a Notice of Appointment (PDF) not later than the 20th day after the appointment is made. (Sec. 32.009). If the appointment is for a single election, the notice may be combined with the Writ of Election (PDF), which is required to be delivered to each presiding judge not later than the 15th day before the election, Friday, April 19, 2024.

(Secs. 127.002, 127.003, 127.004, and 127.005). There is no statutory notice requirement for members of the central counting station, but good practice suggests that written notice be given to them.\n\nRecommended date to appoint the presiding judge and alternate presiding judge of the early voting ballot board or to designate the election workers of one election precinct to serve as the early voting ballot board. (Secs. 87.001, 87.002, and 87.004).

(Secs. 143.007(b), 144.005(b)).\n\nWednesday, February 21, 2024 (73rd day before election day; 5th day after regular filing deadline)\n\nIf a candidate dies on or before the deadline for filing an application for a place on the ballot, the authority responsible for preparing the ballots MAY choose to omit the candidate’s name If the authority does choose to omit the candidate’s name, the deadline for filing an application for a place on the ballot is extended to the fifth day after the filing deadline, February 21st. This extended deadline only applies to the regular filing deadline. It DOES NOT apply to the write-in deadline. (Sec. 145.098).\n\nThursday, February 22, 2024 (72nd day before election day)\n\nFirst day to post Notice of Drawing for Place on Ballot (PDF) if drawing is to be conducted on Monday, February 26, 2024. This notice must be posted for 72 hours immediately preceding the time of the drawing. (Sec. 52.094(c)).\n\nThe authority conducting the ballot position drawing shall provide notice of the date, hour, and place of the drawing to candidates by this date if the drawing is to be conducted on Monday, February 26, 2024, as recommended. (Sec. 52.094(d)). If a candidate in a special election files on this date, they should be given a copy of the notice at the time they file.\n\nThe authority conducting the drawing shall provide notice of the date, hour, and place of the drawing to each candidate. The authority may provide written notice at the time the candidate files an application with the appropriate authority.\n\nIf notice was not provided at the time the candidate filed an application, the notice may be provided by:\n\nwritten notice that is mailed to the address stated on the candidate’s application not later than the fourth day before the date of the drawing; or\n\ntelephone, if a telephone number is provided on the candidate’s application; or\n\nby e-mail, if an e-mail address was provided on the candidate’s application.

If a candidate withdraws or is declared ineligible by this date, his or her name is omitted from the ballot. (Secs. 145.092(f), 145.094(a)(4), 145.096(a)(4)). For special circumstances regarding withdrawal of a candidate before ballots are prepared, please contact the Elections Division of the Office of the Texas Secretary of State.\n\nPolitical Subdivisions Other Than Counties: 5:00 PM – Last day to withdraw as a write- in candidate in the general election ordered by a political subdivision other than a county. (Secs. 144.006(c), 146.0301, 146.054(c)). (Candidates may use the Certificate of Withdrawal (PDF)).\n\nRecommended first day that an election may be cancelled if all filing deadlines have passed, each candidate for an office listed on the ballot is unopposed (except as discussed below), and write- in votes may be counted only for names appearing on a list of write-in candidates. (Sec. 2.052). The Certification of Unopposed Candidates for Other Political Subdivisions (PDF) may be used to certify candidates as unopposed. Also, see our Sample Order of Cancellation (PDF).\n\nA special election of a political subdivision is considered to be a separate election with a separate ballot from a general election for officers of the same political subdivision held at the same time as the special election. Therefore, the fact that there may be a proposition on the ballot will not prevent a cancellation of an election for candidates who are unopposed. (Sec. 2.051(a)). If any members of the political subdivision’s governing body are elected from territorial units, such as single member districts, an election shall be cancelled in a particular territorial unit if each candidate for an office that is to appear on the ballot in that territorial unit is unopposed and no opposed at-large race is to appear on the ballot. An unopposed at-large race shall be cancelled in an election regardless of whether an opposed race is to appear on the ballot in a particular territorial unit.

This is the first of the two possible ordering times. We do not interpret the 70th day order date here as “moving” to the next business day because the date falls on a Saturday, as this is not the last day to order a special election to fill a vacancy for this uniform election date. If a candidate in a special election files on this date, they should be given a copy of the notice at the time they file.\n\nNOTE - A candidate must provide an indication on their candidate application that the candidate has either not been finally convicted of a felony, or if so convicted, has been pardoned or otherwise released from the resulting disabilities. A person who has been convicted of a felony will need to include with the application proof that the person has been pardoned or otherwise released from the resulting disabilities.
