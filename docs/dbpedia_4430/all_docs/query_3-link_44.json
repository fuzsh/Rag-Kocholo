The information required will be the minimum to enable GWindow to deal with your request. Where additional information is requested this will be marked and its provision is voluntary. Additional information is only requested to enable us to provide the most appropriate response to your request.\n\nSensitive information is not sought through this Site except where legally required as part of the recruitment process.

This information may include, for example, your IP (Internet Protocol) address, which pages you visit on this Site, other pages you visit on the Web, and which browser you used to view this Site. This technical data is used to measure and improve the effectiveness of this Site, to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer this Site, to see where Site traffic is coming from and to identify our users. We may also collect other non-personally identifiable information via this Site, such as Site usage activity and preferences, also known as demographic or profile data.

A \"web bug\" is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or e-mail message.\n\nUSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe use Personal Information collected on and through this Site for a variety of purposes in the course of business and as otherwise set forth herein. Personal Information provided is used only for the specific purpose for which it was provided except where you explicitly select to receive other information from GWindow.

In connection with this, such service providers may have access to your Personal Information for use on our behalf consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe may, as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation of our company (a \"Reorganization Event\"), transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to third parties involved in the Reorganization Event.\n\nFrom time to time, we may be required to provide Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, and to disclose any information concerning you as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate this Site properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our users or if you are involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved) in any illegal or harmful activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. We may release certain Personal Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.\n\nDO YOU HAVE CHOICES REGARDING HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION USED?\n\nOpt-Out\n\nIf you would like to opt not to receive promotional or marketing e-mail from us in the future, you may let us know by sending us an e-mail to opt-out@governmentwindow.com stating the e-mail address you wish to be removed from our mailing list. However, your option not to receive promotional and marketing e-mail shall not preclude us from corresponding with you, by e-mail or otherwise, regarding your existing relationship with us.
