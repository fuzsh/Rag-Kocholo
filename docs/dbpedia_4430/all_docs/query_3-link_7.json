        "text": "Centerville prominent in county history\n\nCenterville - laid out October 20, 1814 and recorded January 2, 1815 - is the oldest-surviving town in Wayne County. (Salisbury, platted in 1811, no longer exists.)\n\nTwo men from Cincinnati, Israel Elliott and Ethan A. Stone, donated the land and Henry Byran did the assessment over soil so muddy it was feared it would degenerate into a mud hole.\n\nAt the first sale of lots Revolutionary War veteran Christopher Roddy bought the first plot for his blacksmith shop, brashly proclaiming doing so gave him the honor of naming the place. Since he lived in the [now-extinct] town of Salisbury and this new town was an estimated three miles nearer the geographical center of the county, he dubbed it Centreville.\n\nAt the time there were a dozen people there, men clad in deerskin trousers, moccasins and blue hint-shirts, with a belt to which knives were fastened and from which hung tobacco pouches of polecat skin, and women wearing gowns of homespun cotton with calico or gingham bonnets.\n\nSettler Rebecca Julian wrote of life at the time:\n\n\"I have thought proper to mention these matters in order that future people may now know what the first settlers had to undergo… The country around us [1810] was an entire wilderness, with here and there a small cabin, containing a small family. We were nearly all new beginners at that time, and although we had to work almost day and night, we were not discouraged… Our husbands cleared the land, and assisted each other in rolling the logs. We often went with them on these occasions, to assist in the way of cooking for the hands. We had first-rate times, just as hard laboring men and women can appreciate. We were not what would be called stylish cooks… The substantials we prepared in plain, honest, old-fashioned style. This is one reason why we were so blessed with health… It was not in style to be weakly. We could take our spinning wheels and walk two miles to a spinning frolic, to do our day's work, and after a first-rate supper, join in some innocent amusement for the evening. We did not take any particular pains to keep our hands dirt-free; we never thought of having hands just to look at… We did not complain half as much as people do now [1840s]. Our diet was plain, our clothing we manufactured ourselves; we lived independent and all were on an equality. I look back on these by-gone days with great affection.\"\n\nBy 1826 the little hamlet had two stores, three taverns, one grocery, one wagon-maker, one wheelwright, two plasterers, one tinsmith, one saddler, two blacksmiths, two cabinet makers, two shoemakers, one millwright, five carpenters, two bricklayers, one tailor, two tanners, three physicians, three lawyers, one school, a post office and 'The Western Times' printing press. The population of about 200 was on more solid footing than anyone else around, especially when they got the first paved streets in Indiana, \"being paved by the government as a mark of distinction to the promising Wayne County capitol in the thirties [1830s].\"\n\nThe first Charter of a Masonic Lodge had its first meeting in Centreville. Hiram Lodge number 42 was organized in 1845 \"the feeling being so strong there for it.\" Centerville eventually \"forfeited the charter in 1868 because it admitted to its membership a man with a wooden leg.\" Since this was against the rules, Centerville residents merely chartered another.\n\nAs a vital artery on the Old National Road during the nation's 19th century westward expansion, Centerville provided creature comforts along the way, especially when the eastside Mansion House opened in 1840 as an exchange station for tired horses and as a place for weary travelers to rest and dine. The three-story structure accommodated wayfarers \"in style.\"\n\nOn June 30, 1858 the women of Centerville accommodated the Mansion House \"in style\" by smashing the interior to pieces due the rampant liquor and gambling there. At a time when women lacked equitable legal, educational and voting access; at a time when local rationale failed to \"staunch the curse,\" the females of Centerville marched with axes and clubs \"to end the sin in the den of pestilence\" and to smash, smash, SMASH! The raid testified to the resolve of Center Township womanhood and was intimidation to even men of chilled steel. Local newspapers proudly lauded them.\n\nCentreville was Wayne County's seat of justice for over five decades. This all changed in March of 1873 when a Circuit Court ruled Richmond the new county seat because it was the population center despite the fact Centreville was geographically more centrally located. As soon as the new courthouse was ready in August, county records were removed from Centreville to Richmond. All that remained was to dismantle the Centre Township jailhouse and the iron fence around it, and to transport the materials to Richmond. Work crews began the task in October, but found the work hampered when vandals destroyed the equipment.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, October 28, seven armed guards from Richmond raced to Centreville to occupy the Sheriff's jailhouse residence in order to watch over the contractor's equipment. At around 11:00 pm a mob gathered in front of the jail and began firing pistols and demanding entrance, which the guards refused. The mob hauled out Black Betty, a six-pound cannon used to fire salutes on Independence Day. After filling it with iron scraps, nails and bolts, they aimed squarely at the jail. Two blasts erupted. The door of the jail was blown from its hinges. The face of the jail was marred with brick chunks blasted away, and the Richmond deputies were unceremoniously marched to the edge of town and ordered to \"git\" back to Richmond. Which they did.\n\nThe \"conflagration\" made the front page of the New York Times. The scars of the encounter are still visible over the doors of the old Sheriff's residence which is now the Centerville and Center Township Public Library.\n\nCentreville nevertheless lost its County seat status. According to the Richmond Telegram, the wrath of the populace in the final moments as materials were loaded into wagons \"unraveled\" and \"verbiage became unsanctified,\" finding occasional utterances in incessant \"groans and damns.\"\n\nThe former county seat remains preeminent historically though.\n\nCenterville men have fought in all American wars and conflicts. Crown Hill Cemetery is testament to this.\n\nCivil War generals Ambrose E. Burnside and Lew Wallace are biographically tied there, as is George W. Julian, Wayne County's only vice presidential candidate for the second highest office in the United States. Six U.S. governors spent their developmental years in Centreville.\n\nOliver P. Morton's Centerville home still exists. Morton governed Indiana during the Civil War, two years with no tax support, which is unprecedented. Early on he raised men in arms and hundreds of thousands of dollars through loans and donations on his good name. President Lincoln said of Morton, \"Had it not been for Governor Morton sending money and men to the front when most needed, the war probably would have been lost by the North.\"\n\nThe greatest athlete in Wayne County history was born in Centerville. A rambunctious little colt foaled there on April 4, 1910 humbly entered the world without benefit of human assistance. The ungainly little specimen was dubbed Single G. The ragged horse was a super-horse hailed as the greatest pacer of all time and \"the most marvelous piece of horseflesh every foaled.\"\n\nThe Inter-State Publishing Company's 1884 'History of Wayne County, Indiana' comments on the former county seat by saying, \"Rarely does it fall to the lot of any small place to be the home of so many eminent men, conspicuous in the affairs both of state and the nation, as have lived in Centreville.\"\n\nWhat was said then is true now.\n\nAlthough Centreville has reversed its \"re\" to \"er\", Centerville is home to people of imminence and dignity. The once muddy ground laid out as a town on Oct. 20, 1814 is hallowed ground not just for east central Indiana but also for the nation.\n\nSteve Martin is a reference librarian at Morrisson-Reeves Library in Richmond."
