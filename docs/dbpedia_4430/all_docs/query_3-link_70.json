        "text": "Centerville Mayor and Council met on Tuesday evening for their February work session, and for the first time in several months—due to ongoing COVID concerns—citizens were allowed in the meeting room to voice public unease. Social distancing rules were followed and masks were required to be worn by all. Approximately 10-12 citizens joined the meeting, all of which were Houston County residents, though not citizens of Centerville itself.\n\nThe matter on the agenda to be discussed, with the public’s input, was an ordinance annexation and rezoning of 3930 N. Highway 41. As the subject was introduced, Director of Operations Mike Brumfield presented to council that Centerville’s Planning and Zoning Board had met on Thursday, February 11 to discuss the proposed rezoning and annexation that had been received from Mr. Dillon Wingate on the property located at the corner of Dunbar Road and Houston Lake.\n\n“Mr. Wingate’s proposal is to rezone from Houston County R1 to Centerville R2,” Brumfield said. “In that meeting, we did have several residents that attended and voiced their opinions and concerns about the rezoning. I think most of those are present here tonight,” he pointed out. “Overall, most who spoke stated that they aren’t against the development outright, but that they are concerned about density, traffic flow and safety in that area. No one was opposed to the annexation.”\n\nBrumfield shared with mayor and council that Planning & Zoning ultimately recommended approval of the rezoning, but with some stipulations. “What the board would like to see is the boundary line between the county R1 and Centerville R2 be rezoned as R2, but meet the requirements of R1, which would require larger lots. It would be phased in so that from the outside, you wouldn’t see the tiny lots like you would normally. It would be larger lots on the outside and they would get smaller as you go inside the development. That was the recommendation from P&Z.”\n\nFour of the attending citizens of Houston County stood to voice their inputs, and one, in particular, sounded especially passionate about his concerns. Chuck Fenske lives on five acres at the corner of Dunbar and 41 and voiced two specific concerns.\n\n“My house sits 400 feet off of [Highway] 41. The truck noise, the motorcycle noise and the vehicle noise, we can hear in the house at 400 feet away. The 18-wheelers, in some cases, brake stop. The house almost rattles, it’s so much,” he expressed. “Now, as I understand it, there will be something like 300 homes in this subdivision. That’s 300 more cars,” Fenske pointed out. “Many people have two cars, so I’m going to say it’s between 300 and 600 more vehicles that I’m going to have to listen to because people come off of Dunbar onto 41. The noise alone is irritating, and it’s just going to increase so much more with adding 300 to 600 cars.”\n\nIn making his second point, Fenske said, “I’m also concerned about the safety. Dunbar Road, between 41 and Houston Lake, is a drag strip. People will turn off of 41 onto Dunbar, and the motorcycle guys love to do the wheelies. The guys in their fast cars can be heard in our house, even the tire screeching.”\n\nFenske mentioned that while it was not his intent to knock the police, he pointed out that they are never there to catch the erratic drivers. According to if a policeman were there with a radar gun, he or she would “have a field day.”\n\n“I have a black fence across my entire property. Two to three times a year, somebody coming down Dunbar doesn’t stop, and they go through my fence,” he later added. “A few months ago, that cost me $900 to repair. It happens two to three times a year. Someone’s going to get really seriously hurt from the traffic coming down Dunbar. Either they are drunk or on drugs or not paying attention or texting. They run the stop sign, come right into my yard, burst through my fence, tear up my lawn and whatever else.”\n\nAfter listening to all of those who expressed concern, Mayor John Harley and several members of council shared their understanding with the attending citizens and the viewing public.\n\nMayor Harley explained, “That area on Dunbar between Houston Lake and 41 is Houston County. It’s not city, so we can’t put any police on that. I wish we could.” In more detail, the mayor said, “Going down 41, when you get into Dunbar on 41 to the left, you go down about half a mile before you get into Centerville. Again, that’s all Houston County right in there. I’m not trying to put the finger on them, but they have a small area of Houston County that still goes over there, and I know it’s difficult for them to keep a officer or a sheriff’s deputy over in that direction.”\n\nHarley, along with Councilman Justin Wright and Director Blumfield also assured the residents that an approval by Centerville City Council would not be the final word on whether the annexation would pass.\n\n“The development of the project has to go through Houston County, GDOT and our building department to be approved before they can do anything. Both these entrances—in this case—will not be governed by us. Houston County will be governing the Dunbar entrance and Georgia DOT will govern the 41 entrance.”\n\nMayor and council approved the ordinance annexation and rezoning."
