        "text": "In political geography, an enclave is a piece of land belonging to one country (or region etc.) that is totally surrounded by another country (or region). An exclave is a piece of land that is politically attached to a larger piece but not physically contiguous with it (connected to it) because they are completely separated by a surrounding foreign territory or territories. Many entities are both enclaves and exclaves.\n\nEach enclave listed in this section has an administrative level equivalent to that of the one other entity that entirely surrounds it. Each enclave is also a part of a main region; hence, it is an exclave of that region.\n\nName[1][2] Area (km2) Exclave of Enclaved within Coordinates Notes Apipé Islands[3] (4) ~320 Argentina (Corrientes Province – Ituzaingó Department) Paraguay (Misiones Department – Ayolas District) Four adjacent islands (Isla Apipé Grande, Isla Apipé Chico, Isla Los Patos and Isla San Martín) with territorial water borders in the Río Paraná, 39 km east of Isla Entre Rios. Island areas are about 276, 23.8, 11.8 and 3.7 km2, respectively. Isla Entre Ríos[3] ~36 Argentina (Corrientes Province – Berón de Astrada Department) Paraguay (Ñeembucú Department – Cerrito District) Uninhabited island with territorial water border in the Río Paraná, 39 km west of Isla Apipé. Isla Martín García 1.84 Argentina (Buenos Aires Province – La Plata Partido) Uruguay Territorial water border on the Uruguay side of Río de la Plata. Designated as a nature reserve under the jurisdiction of Argentina in 1973. Artsvashen ~40 Armenia (Gegharkunik Province) Azerbaijan Controlled by Azerbaijan since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1992. Torres Strait Islands (7) ~2,200 (including water area) Australia (Queensland – Shire of Torres and Torres Strait Island Region) Papua New Guinea The islands of Anchor Cay, Aubusi Island, Black Rocks, Boigu Island (89.6 km2), Bramble Cay (0.036 km2), Dauan Island (4 km2), Deliverance Island, East Cay, Kaumag Island, Kerr Islet, Moimi Island, Saibai Island (107.9 km2), Turnagain Island (12 km2) and Turu Cay, along with their territorial seas, form seven enclaves within the maritime area of Papua New Guinea under a treaty effective in 1985. The territorial sea of each island does not extend beyond three nautical miles.[4][5] The mainland of Papua New Guinea is only 6 km from Boigu. Jungholz 7.05 Austria (Tyrol state – Reutte District) Germany (Bavaria state – Swabia administrative region) Connected at a quadripoint at the summit of the mountain Sorgschrofen (1636 m); accessible only through Germany. Vinokurov (2007) states, \"For all purposes, a connection in a single point does not mean anything. It is just like being completely separated. One cannot pass through a single point, nor is it possible to transport goods. It is not even possible to lay a telephone line.\"[3] Barkhudarli ~10 Azerbaijan (Qazakh District) Armenia (Tavush Province) Controlled by Armenia since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in May 1992; west-southwest of the town of Qazax. Yukhari Askipara ~28 A destroyed village controlled by Armenia since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in May 1992; west of the town of Qazax. Karki / Tigranashen 8 Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Sadarak District) Armenia (Ararat Province) Controlled by Armenia since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in May 1992; north of Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan. Yaradullu (north and south) 0.12 and 0.06 Azerbaijan (Ağstafa District) Armenia (Tavush Province) Two farmland enclaves just across the border from the village of Yaradullu[6][7] (55 m at the closest point). They are 750 m and 1500 m southwest of the municipality of Tatlı on the west bank of the Akhum River; approximately 300x400 m and 300x200 m. The surrounding Armenian territory has been occupied by Azerbaijan since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in May 1992, so that these two small pockets of land are de facto no longer exclaves. Dahagram-Angarpota 25.95 Bangladesh (Rangpur Division – Lalmonirhat district) India (West Bengal state – Cooch Behar district) Dahagram–Angarpota is a composite enclave of two adjoining chhits. It is separated from the contiguous area of Bangladesh at its closest point by 178 metres (584 ft). The enclave has an estimated population of 20,000. After the exchange of enclaves with India under the Land Boundary Agreement on 31 July 2015, Bangladesh retained it as an exclave. The Tin Bigha Corridor, a strip of Indian territory 85 metres (279 ft) wide running from the enclave to the Bangladesh mainland at its nearest approach, was leased to Bangladesh for 999 years for access to the enclave.[1][8][9] Baarle-Hertog (22 parcels) 2.3448 Belgium (Antwerp province – Baarle-Hertog municipality) Netherlands (North Brabant province – Baarle-Nassau municipality) (H1) A group of 22 Belgian enclaves in the southern Netherlands. Enclaves H1 and H2 are connected at a single point. Međurečje 3.9584 Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska – Rudo municipality) Serbia (Zlatibor District – Priboj municipality) Homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 1,130 metres (3,710 ft) to the north. Sastavci is the name of the neighbouring village in Serbia. West Kowloon Port (aka. Mainland Port Area) 0.11 China (Guangdong province – Futian district) Hong Kong (Yau Tsim Mong district) China's immigration/customs border crossing that is located within Hong Kong; compartments of operating passenger trains on the rail link in Hong Kong are also considered part of Mainland Port Area.[10] It is not contiguous with the rest of China. Effectively ceded to China in 2018 for a token HK$1,000 per year. Quitasueño 3,577, including water area[11] Colombia (San Andrés y Providencia Department) Nicaragua [12] (QS32)[11] On 19 November 2012, the International Court of Justice upheld Colombia's claim to Quitasueño, plus a 12-NM territorial zone, and re-defined Nicaragua's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), thus surrounding the island bank.[13] It deemed one of the bank's 54 features to be an island at high tide (elevation 70 cm, area 1 m2)[14] and created enclaves as an equitable solution.[15] The area of the bank, excluding the 12-mile zone, is ~290 km2.[16] Serrana ~2,800, including water area (Southwest Cay) On 19 November 2012, ICJ upheld Colombia's claim to Serrana, plus a 12-NM territorial zone, and re-defined Nicaragua's EEZ, surrounding the island bank.[13] The land area is ~0.11 km2, and the area of the bank, excluding the 12-mile zone, is ~322 km2.[16] Colombia decried the loss of maritime areas and creation of \"'enclaves' around Quitasueño and Serrana that could restrict\" access.[13] Brezovica Žumberačka (2) 0.0183+ Croatia (Karlovac County – Ozalj town) Slovenia (Metlika municipality) The first enclave contains four dwellings surrounded by agricultural land near the Slovenian village of Brezovica pri Metliki. It is about 437 m long and 60 m wide covering 1.83 ha. Confirmed by both Croatian and Slovenian cadaster maps, it lies about 100 metres away from the main border at the closest point.[6][7][17][18]\n\nA second enclave lies within 300 metres of the first. It was created on 29 June 2017 when the Permanent Court of Arbitration decided that a disputed 2.4 ha parcel is part of Slovenia and that the border follows Slovenian cadastral limits, thus completing the encirclement of the second Croatian enclave.[19][20] Croatia has stated that it will ignore the arbitration decision.[21]\n\nOrmidhia 1.694 Cyprus (Larnaca District) Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area Small exclave surrounded by Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory in southeastern Cyprus. The degree of sovereignty and legitimacy of the Sovereign Base Areas is disputed by the Republic of Cyprus.[22][23] Xylotymbou 0.947 Small exclave surrounded by Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory. \"Electricity Authority of Cyprus\" Refugee Settlement ~0.28 North of Dhekelia Power Station from which it is separated by a British road; the closest point between the two territories is 21 metres. Dhekelia Power Station ~0.161 Partially borders the coast but enclosed by UK land and waters disputed between Cyprus and the UK; the power station is owned by the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC); no permanent population. Münsterbildchen [de] 1.826 Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia state – Aachen district – Roetgen municipality) Belgium (Liège province – Raeren municipality) West of Vennbahn trackbed; northernmost German enclave, mainly home to industrial and warehouse structures. Roetgener Wald [de] 9.98 Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia state – Aachen district – Roetgen and Simmerath municipalities) Belgium (Liège province) Western part of Lammersdorf [de], southern part of Roetgen, and intervening forest (Forst Rötgen); west and south of Vennbahn trackbed. From 1922 to 1958, the center portion (between Grenzweg and a boundary with three turning points west of the Schleebach stream) was Belgian territory. Until 1949, the east–west road that connected the two outer (German) portions was also German territory; therefore, the German land formed one oddly-shaped enclave (that also included the road to Konzen). In 1949, it was split into two enclaves when Germany ceded the roads to Belgium;[24] in 1958, Belgium returned the east–west road and also ceded the centre section of the current enclave to Germany. Rückschlag [de] 0.016 Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia state – Aachen district – Monschau town) Belgium (Liège province – Eupen municipality) Part of city of Monschau, west of Vennbahn trackbed; smallest German exclave, consisting of a house and a garden. Mützenich 12.117 Belgium (Liège province) West of Belgium's Vennbahn trackbed. Ruitzhof [de] 0.937 Part of city of Monschau, west of Vennbahn trackbed; southernmost Vennbahn enclave after 1949 (when Belgium annexed the Hemmeres [de] enclave). Büsingen am Hochrhein 7.62 Germany (Baden-Württemberg state – Konstanz district) Switzerland At its closest, less than 700 metres (2,300 ft) from Germany proper (to the east). Part of Swiss customs Campione d'Italia 1.6 Italy (Lombardy region – Province of Como) Switzerland (Canton Ticino – Lugano District) Uses the Swiss franc, Former part of Swiss customs (until 2020). Separated by less than 1 km, at the shortest distance, from the rest of Italy by Lake Lugano and mountains, but the terrain requires a 14 km road journey to reach the nearest Italian town, Lanzo d'Intelvi. Barak (de facto) 2.07[25] Kyrgyzstan (Kara-Suu District – Osh Region) Uzbekistan (Andijan Region) Kyrgyzstan's 1991 pre-independence border is the de jure international border, but much of it is hotly disputed with its neighbors. In August 1999, the area around Barak was occupied by Uzbekistan, cutting it off from Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash[26] while also allegedly seizing large areas of Kyrgyz land that had been loaned in the Soviet era but never returned.[27] They entrenched themselves within much of Kyrgyz border territory and refused to leave.[28] Barak became a de facto enclave only 1.5 km from the shifted main border.[29] Four Uzbek enclaves and Barak are major sticking points in delimitation talks,[30] and disputes have centered on the areas of Barak, Sokh, Gava and Gavasay (stream).[31] (Map) In August 2018 Kyrgyz and Uzbek authorities agreed to a land swap that would eliminate the exclave. The exchange process may take up to two years.[32] Likoma Island 130.0 (incl a territorial water area) Malawi (Northern Region – Likoma District) Mozambique (Niassa Province – Lago District) Lacustrine enclave, including smaller islets, with territorial water border in Lake Malawi (Lake Nyasa); only ~5 kilometres from the Mozambique shore; combined land area of Likoma Is. and the smaller Chizumulu Is. is 18 km2. Chizumulu Island (incl Lundu Is., Papia Is., Ngkyvo Is.) 101.4 (incl 2-NM territorial water area) Lacustrine enclave with territorial water border in Lake Malawi (Lake Nyasa); Malawian mainland is 46 km away. Baarle-Nassau (8 parcels) 0.150684 Netherlands (North Brabant province – Baarle-Nassau municipality) Belgium (Antwerp province – Baarle-Hertog municipality) (N8) Seven of the eight Dutch enclaves are counter-enclaves inside two Belgian enclaves (H1 and H8); one is in the main body of Belgium (N8). Laguna Los Portillos [es] (and beach) ~0.46 Nicaragua (Río San Juan Department) Costa Rica (Limón Province) On 2 Feb 2018, the ICJ rendered a decision in a border dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica regarding Isla Portillos [es]. Nicaragua was left with just the Laguna Los Portillos and its short strip of beach. The court also decided that the sea just outside of the lagoon would be Costa Rican waters. The ICJ concluded that the whole beach is Costa Rican except for the part directly between the lagoon and the Caribbean Sea – now a tiny enclave of Nicaraguan territory separated from the rest of the country.[33] Madha ~75 Oman (Musandam Governorate) United Arab Emirates Halfway between the Omani fragment on the Musandam Peninsula and the rest of Oman; surrounds the UAE counter-enclave of Nahwa.

In the case of international waters, the main region consists of all international waters not in EEZs. All potential paths of travel from the exclave to its main region must cross one or more different administrative-territorial regions having the equivalent legal level. Each exclave listed in this section borders on more than one other region.\n\nName Area (km2) Exclave of Coordinates Notes Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic 5,500 Azerbaijan Bounded by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey Strovilia (de facto) Cyprus Borders the British Sovereign Base Area (SBA) of Dhekelia and the de facto independent Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is unrecognised internationally. The TRNC has occupied and controlled the exclave; on 30 June 2000 the TRNC unilaterally absorbed it, despite United Nations condemnation and lack of recognition. Gulf of Fonseca outer tridominium ~190 Honduras Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua border the Gulf of Fonseca, a closed sea under international law. Each enjoys a 3-nautical mile littoral zone of sovereignty along its shores and islands in the gulf. The remaining water area in the gulf comprises a tridominium that is shared in common among all three nations. The littoral zones (territorial waters) abut each other in a way that forms two separate areas of tridominium waters in the gulf. The outer area opens directly to the Pacific Ocean and is separated from the inner area by the territorial waters of Salvadoran and Nicaraguan islets. The inner area is bordered by the waters of all three countries. The larger outer area is bordered only by the waters of El Salvador and Nicaragua and the closing line of the gulf, such that one cannot travel within the gulf from Honduras to the outer area except by passing through El Salvadoran and Nicaraguan waters. Therefore, the outer water area is an exclave of Honduras that is shared territorially with two other countries.[81][82][83] All three nations are \"entitled outside the closing line to territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. Whether this situation should remain in being or be replaced by a division and delimitation into three separate zones is, as inside the Gulf also, a matter for the three States to decide.\"[82] Gaza Strip (de jure) 360 State of Palestine Bounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, where the territorial sea and contiguous zone of Palestine are surrounded by those of Israel (the waters of Palestine and Egypt are separated by an Israeli corridor). \"Donut Hole\", High Seas ~190,000 International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of Russia and the United States (Alaska).[84] \"Banana Hole\", High Seas ~310,000 International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of Norway (including Svalbard), Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Jan Mayen (Norway) and Iceland \"Eastern Gap\", High Seas ~20,000 International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of Mexico (EEZ defined by Cape Catoche and Scorpion Reef in the Gulf of Mexico), the United States (EEZ defined by Loggerhead Key and the Gulf coast) and Cuba (EEZ extends northwest from Cayo Ines de Soto)[85] High Seas International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of Mauritius (Agalega Islands), Tromelin Island (France), Madagascar and Seychelles (Farquhar Atoll) High Seas International waters In the South China Sea, the EEZs that are defined by Taiwan (Pratas Reef), the Philippines (Luzon Island and Cabra I.), the Spratly Islands of Dao Dinh Ba and Flat Island, and the Paracel Island of Dao Hoang Sa enclose an exclave. National sovereignty over many of the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea is disputed. Hence, depending upon the claims involved, this exclave may be considered as being created by the EEZs of Taiwan and the Philippines, or by the EEZs of Taiwan, the Philippines and Viet Nam, or by the EEZs of Taiwan and mainland China, or by the EEZ of mainland China alone. High Seas ~100,000 International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of French Polynesia, Cook Islands and Kiribati \"Western Gap\", High Seas 17,467 International waters Surrounded by the EEZs of Mexico (EEZ defined by Scorpion Reef and Cayo Arenas in the Gulf of Mexico) and the United States (EEZ defined by the Gulf of Mexico coast, including Wolf Island (south of Freeport, Texas, and Raccoon Island, Louisiana)) – This exclave no longer exists per se.
