        "text": "Richmond, Indiana, Sept. 22, 2016 – State of Indiana Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb presided over today’s ground breaking for Blue Buffalo Company’s (Nasdaq:BUFF) newest Heartland manufacturing and R&D facility to be located in Richmond, IN. (View video of event here.)\n\n“Job creators across the country continue to choose Indiana because of our low-costs, minimal regulations and highly-skilled Hoosier workforce,” said Lt. Governor Holcomb. “Our business climate has earned national recognition as companies like Blue Buffalo are choosing to grow in Indiana, contributing to the nearly 150,000 new Hoosier jobs added since 2013. We’re glad to have Blue Buffalo in Indiana and look forward to many years of continued success for our newest Hoosier company.”\n\nIt is anticipated that the new facility will create approximately 165 jobs. Heartland Richmond, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Buffalo Co., will produce dry food and become the second company-owned manufacturing facility for Blue Buffalo, with the first facility located in Joplin, Missouri.\n\n“We are proud to be expanding our U.S. pet food manufacturing and R&D capabilities here in Richmond, said Bill Bishop, Chairman and Founder at Blue Buffalo. “Richmond and the surrounding communities have both the people and the “can do” attitude that it takes to help us meet the growing demand for our natural pet food products.”\n\nConstruction is planned to begin in the second half of 2016 with production of BLUE natural pet food expected to begin in 2018. Blue Buffalo will begin to hire for selected positions in the first half of 2017 and will continue throughout 2017. The new jobs will include positions in food processing, food quality assurance and general management.\n\nThe planned investment in Blue Buffalo’s Indiana plant will be approximately $150 million dollars. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation offered Blue Buffalo up to $1,625,000 in conditional tax credits based on the company’s job creation plans. These incentives are performance-based, meaning until Hoosiers are hired, the company is not eligible to claim incentives. Wayne County and the city of Richmond have approved additional incentives at the request of the Economic Development Corporation of Wayne County Indiana.\n\n“Blue Buffalo is an excellent and well-established company and we are excited to welcome them to Richmond. This ground breaking isn’t a finish line but a milestone of the success we will share in years to come,” concluded Richmond Mayor Dave Snow. “This is all thanks to a collaborative effort of the state and local economic development corporations, Wayne County, Centerville, and the Richmond City Team.”\n\nAbout Blue Buffalo\n\nBlue Buffalo, based in Wilton, CT, is the nation’s leading natural pet food company, and provides natural foods and treats for dogs and cats under its BLUE Life Protection Formula, BLUE Wilderness, BLUE Basics, BLUE Freedom and BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet lines. Paying tribute to its founding mission, the Company, through the Blue Buffalo Foundation, is also a leading sponsor of pet cancer awareness and of critical studies of pet cancer, health, treatment and nutrition at top veterinary medical schools across the United States.
