        "text": "At Centerville Christian Church we take very seriously Jesus' command to LOVE GOD and LOVE PEOPLE (Mark 12:30-31).\n\nWe exist as a family of believers to grow closer to God, experience life-changing transformation and reach out to others as we share the good news of His amazing grace.\n\nWe pattern ourselves after the church as described in the book of Acts, \"...continuing steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine, fellowship, breaking of bread (communion), and prayer.\"\n\nOur large gatherings on Sunday mornings are designed to draw us into the presence of God through prayer, vibrant worship and practical, Biblical messages. A special part of our time together is sharing in communion around the Lord's table. Our Adult Bible Fellowship classes on Sunday morning provide structured teaching from God's Word and rich fellowship with other believers. Our various small groups provide the opportunity to build closer friendships and pursue real life-change in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nWe are an independent church in that we are not governed by any outside denominational structure. We select and affirm our own leaders and they direct the affairs of the church under the leadership of the Holy Spirit in accordance with His Word. We call ourselves \"Christians\", (Acts 11:26), and use the Bible as our only rule of faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16-17). We believe in outreach - locally, nationally and internationally; and support a variety of mission efforts. We seek to be nondenominational, encouraging all believers to put aside man-made creeds and titles.\n\nWe hope you'll get to know us better and give us the chance to know you!\n\nYou can download a copy of our Mission and Vision statement .\n\nWhile we are not sure what might bring you to Centerville, what we are sure of is that you can expect to see a lot of people just like you. People who get out of bed every day to face the same world that you do. People who work hard to provide for themselves or their families, people who struggle to find enough time to invest in the important relationships in their lives and people who get to the end of the day knowing deep down inside that there has to be something more. If you decide to come and be our guest, know that you will find yourself in the company of people just like you.\n\nIf you choose to come, come as you are.\n\nWhile we want to give our very best to the God who loves us, we do not concern ourselves too much with conforming to a dress code. You will see people dressed in a more traditional Sunday wardrobe as well as people dressed in very casual attire with about everything in between. We want you to come comfortable, ready to receive whatever it is God might be longing to give you.\n\nIf you choose to come, bring everybody.\n\nWhoever it is that is an important part of your life, they will find an environment to plug into here. From little babies to grandmas and grandpas, we are constantly working to create a place that is comfortable and relevant for everyone to take what God has to offer.\n\nIf you choose to come and you aren't real familiar with church.....\n\nknow that we understand there are probably things that we will do as a church that you may not do a lot. We sing a lot because the Bible says that God loves to hear our praise when we sing. We listen a lot to God and to each other because it is usually in listening that we hear the most. And we share a lot through things like offering and communion and baptism because these are ways that we share in becoming more like Jesus.\n\nIf you choose to come to and spend a morning with us we want you to know that we will be honored to meet you. And we will do everything we can to make you feel at home among people just like you.\n\nWhile statements can foster division within the body of Christ, we do hold certain truths to be essential and believe that being in agreement on them enables us to better accomplish God’s purposes. We welcome the opportunity to discuss any of these in further detail.\n\nWe believe in one God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\n*\n\nWe believe God is the Creator of man as well as heaven and earth.\n\n*\n\nWe believe in Jesus Christ as God’s only Son who was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was resurrected from the dead. We recognize Jesus as humanity’s only means of salvation.\n\n* * * *\n\nWe believe the Holy Spirit dwells within every Christian.\n\n*\n\nWe believe the Bible is the inspired word of God and the final authority for all matters of faith.\n\n* *\n\nWe believe that man, created by God, willfully sinned, and as a result, is lost and without hope apart from Jesus Christ.\n\n* *\n\nWe believe that salvation, the forgiveness of sins and entrance into new life, comes by grace through the blood of Jesus Christ (His death on the cross and resurrection to new life).\n\n* *\n\nWe believe the Bible teaches that the following elements are necessary to receive Jesus as Savior: to believe in Christ as God’s Son and Savior of the world, to repent of personal sin, to confess Jesus as Lord, and to be immersed in baptism; and that none of these alone is sufficient.\n\n* * *\n\nWe believe God expects that a genuine conversion will result in a changed life in which every disciple will participate in the lifelong, ongoing process of spiritual transformation.\n\n* * *\n\nWe believe that the Church is the body and bride of Christ, founded on the day of Pentecost,\n\nconsisting of all Christians everywhere.\n\n*\n\nWe believe it is God’s plan for Elders to shepherd the local church.\n\n* *\n\nWe believe that death seals the eternal destiny of each person. The saved will inherit eternal life in heaven with God; the unsaved, eternal separation from God in hell.\n\n* * *"
