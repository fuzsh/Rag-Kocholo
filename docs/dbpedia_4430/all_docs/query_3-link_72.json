        "text": "Why Should Delaware Care?\n\nA growing consensus in Delaware calls for residential home developments to be built with density and walkability in mind. But where those developments should go is often a hot debate. And, how politicians are swayed in that debate could set precedents for years to come.\n\nA concept plan to develop “cottage” homes on small plots of land in the wealthy Centreville community is facing well-organized opposition from residents, several of whom converged on a New Castle County Council meeting Tuesday to argue that the development would change the tranquil nature of their hamlet.\n\nThe local controversy is sparking questions of where in the county new types of dense housing should be placed, and whether politicians should axe development approvals in the face of widespread opposition from neighbors.\n\nIt also is the latest example of a suburban backlash to development in New Castle County, following objections over the past year to controversial proposals to build warehouses in the Middletown area and an office building in Alapocas.\n\nIn February, the New Castle County Council approved a measure that amended a town land-use plan to allow for cottage developments in Centreville, which is nestled in the heart of the rolling hills of Delaware’s chateau country along the Pennsylvania border.\n\nLobbying in favor of the measure then was local attorney Wendie Stabler, whose client Spanos LLC had developed an early plan to build 10 homes around a courtyard on a roughly 1-acre lot that sits adjacent to Centreville’s primary arterial route, Kennett Pike.\n\nBut, during the months since the council’s measure to allow for so-called “pocket communities,” outcry over the Spanos plan grew in online circles and at local Centreville haunts, according to residents.\n\nUltimately, residents say they gathered more than 500 signatures on a petition opposing the measure.\n\nIn an apparent response, two New Castle County Councilmembers – Karen Hartley-Nagle and Dee Durham – sponsored competing resolutions that each would repeal the previous measure that allowed for cottage developments in Centreville. On Tuesday, the council met to discuss the resolutions.\n\nDuring the meeting, Centreville residents’ protests continued with several speaking in opposition to denser residential development in their community.\n\n“We’re the last historic village and we don’t want it turned into high-density, cluster housing of any kind,” said resident Don McDonald, who also contrasted Centreville with the nearby upscale Greenville community that has allowed new retail and apartment development projects in recent decades\n\n“We don’t want it to be another Greenville,” McDonald said.\n\nIn his comments, McDonald also asserted that the county had insufficiently engaged with his community prior to the council’s February approval of the land-use amendment. That critique was echoed by many of the residents who spoke at the Tuesday meeting.\n\nCounty Councilwoman Janet Kilpatrick, who chairs the county’s land-use committee, responded to the criticism by noting that the council had followed all public notice laws prior to the February vote on the Centreville cottage measure.\n\nThe sole voice that spoke in favor of denser residential development in Centreville on Tuesday was prominent, land-use attorney Larry Tarabicos, who opened his comments by saying he was “very uncomfortable today and a little bit nervous, frankly.”\n\nHe then characterized the council’s proposal to repeal their allowance of cottages in Centreville as “horrible,” stating that it would set a precedent that could block dense housing developments across Delaware.\n\nTarabicos also noted several past developments in New Castle County that the council had approved despite opposition from many members of the public.\n\n“We don’t govern by popular vote on zoning decisions,” said Tarabicos, who also noted that he has no financial relationship with the development and doesn’t know the developer.\n\nStill, his comments drew heckles from the crowd of Centreville residents who were in attendance at the meeting. In response, Kilpatrick scolded them, and threatened to remove one person from the meeting.\n\nThe meeting ended on schedule shortly after the mild drama.\n\nDuring an interview Wednesday, Stabler said she doesn’t know whether her client’s plans for cottages in Centreville would be killed by council’s potential vote in favor of a repeal.\n\nMake Your Voice Heard\n\nThe New Castle County Council are scheduled to vote on competing resolutions on Tuesday, June 11. Their meetings start at 7 p.m. and are located at Louis Redding City/County Building located at 800 N. French St. in Wilmington."
