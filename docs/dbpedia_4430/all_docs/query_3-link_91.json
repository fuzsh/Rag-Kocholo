        "text": "Township in Ohio, United States\n\nA suburb of Dayton, Washington Township is the largest of nine townships of Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. The population was 61,882 at the 2020 census.[3]\n\nThe township, through the independent Centerville-Washington Park District, contains eight community parks, nine nature parks and 33 neighborhood parks encompassing 1,000 acres in Centerville and Washington Township.[4]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocated in the southeastern corner of the county, Washington Township borders the following townships and city:\n\nKettering - north\n\nSugarcreek Township, Greene County - east\n\nBellbrook - east\n\nWayne Township, Warren County - southeast\n\nClearcreek Township, Warren County - south\n\nMiami Township - west\n\nSpringboro - southwest\n\nBecause most of eastern Montgomery County is urbanized, Washington Township is the only civil township in the county to border Greene County.\n\nSeveral populated places are located in Washington Township:\n\nPart of the city of Kettering, in the north\n\nPart of the city of Centerville, in the center\n\nName and history\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is one of forty-three Washington Townships statewide.[5]\n\nIn 1833, Washington Township contained four gristmills, seven saw mills, and one cotton factory.[6]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe township is governed by a three-member board of trustees who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer[7] who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\n\nBoth the township's library system and the Centerville City School District (shared with residents of the city of Centerville) are ranked highly on state and national scales.[8][9]\n\nPolice services are provided in the township through a contract with the Montgomery County Sheriffâ€™s Office.[citation needed]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
