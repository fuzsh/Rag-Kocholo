        "text": "In 1959, the South Davis Sewer District was organized by Davis County as an independent special district to service and provide wastewater services to the south half of Davis County; consisting of Bountiful, Centerville, North Salt Lake, West Bountiful, Woods Cross, and the unincorporated areas south of Lund Lane. A seven-member Board of Trustees governs the District.\n\nThe District currently serves a total population of approximately 90,000 with two treatment plants: The North Plant is located at 1800 West 1200 North in West Bountiful, and the South Plant located at 1380 West Center Street in North Salt Lake. The North Plant can treat up to 12 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater per day, and the South Plant can treat up to 4 million gallons of wastewater per day. In addition to the treatment plants, the District owns and operates a collection system made up of 370 miles of sewer lines, 8,565 manholes and 10 lift stations."
