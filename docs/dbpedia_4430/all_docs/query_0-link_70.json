Rec. S. 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 5636, 134 Cong. Rec. E. 3750; and also on findings from the paper entitled \"Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,\" by Kelly Holsopple, Program Adult Entertainment Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from \"Sexually Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View,\" by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other documentary evidence, the City Council finds:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no statewide mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined in Ohio R.C. 3768.01 as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. The \"couch dances\" or \"lap dances\" that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of \"engaging in prostitution\" under Ohio R.C. 2907.25.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and chancroid.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in the state.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Ohio.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982, and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one half million cases being reported in 1990.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â n.Â Â Â Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â o.Â Â Â The findings noted in divisions 2. a) to n) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â p.Â Â Â Adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns\n\nÂ Â Â B.Â Â Â Classification\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Sexually oriented businesses are classified as follows:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Adult arcades;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Adult bookstores, adult novelty stores, or adult video stores;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Adult cabarets;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Adult motels;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Adult motion picture theaters;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Adult theaters;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Escort agencies;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Semi nude model studios; and\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Sexual encounter centers.\n\nÂ Â Â C.Â Â Â License Required\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â It is unlawful:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â For any person to operate a sexually oriented business without a valid sexually oriented business license issued by the City pursuant to this chapter;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â For any person who operates a sexually oriented business to employ a person to work for the sexually oriented business who is not licensed as a sexually oriented business employee by the City pursuant to this chapter.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â For any person to obtain employment with a sexually oriented business without having secured a sexually oriented business employee license pursuant to this chapter.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An application for a license must be made on a form provided by the City. All applicants must be qualified according to the provisions of this chapter.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â An applicant for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license shall file with the Enforcement Officer a completed application made on a form prescribed and provided by the City Director of Finance. An application shall be considered complete if it includes the information required in this Section. The applicant shall be qualified according to the provisions of this Ordinance. The application shall be notarized. The application shall include the information called for in Divisions a) through f) and where applicable, Division g), of this Subsection as follows:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The full true name and any other names used in the preceding 5 years.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The current business address.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Either a set of fingerprints suitable for conducting necessary background checks pursuant to this chapter, or the applicant's Social Security Number, to be used for the same purpose.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â If the application is for a sexually oriented business license, the name, business location, legal description, business mailing address and phone number of the proposed sexually oriented business.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Written proof of age, in the form of either:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â A copy of a birth certificate and current photo,\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ii.Â Â Â A current drivers license with picture, or\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â iii.Â Â Â Other picture identification document issued by a governmental agency\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The issuing jurisdiction and the effective dates of any license or permit held by the applicant relating to a sexually oriented business, and whether any such license or permit has been denied, revoked, or suspended, and if so, the reason or reasons therefore.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â If the application is for a sexually oriented business license, the name and address of the statutory agent or other agent authorized to receive service of process.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The information provided pursuant to Subsections a) through g) shall be supplemented in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Enforcement Officer within ten working days of a change of circumstances which would render the information originally submitted false or incomplete.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The application for a sexually oriented business license shall be accompanied by a sketch or diagram showing the configuration of the premises, including a statement of total floor space occupied by the business. The sketch or diagram need not be professionally prepared, but shall be drawn to a designated scale or drawn with marked dimensions of the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus 6 inches.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â If the person who wishes to operate a sexually oriented business is an individual, he or she shall sign the application for a license as applicant. If the person that wishes to operate a sexually oriented business is other than an individual (such as a corporation), each officer, director, general partner, or other person who will participate directly in decisions relating to management of the business shall sign the application for a license as the applicant. Each applicant must be qualified under Section 9.49, D, and each applicant shall be considered as a licensee if a license is granted.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â A person who possesses a valid business license is not exempt from the requirement of obtaining any required sexually oriented business license. A person who operates a sexually oriented business and possesses a business license shall comply with the requirements and provisions of this Ordinance, where applicable.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The information provided by an applicant in connection with the application for a license under this chapter shall be maintained by the Enforcement Officer on a confidential basis, and may be disclosed only:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â To other governmental agencies in connection with a law enforcement or public safety function, or\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â As may otherwise be required by law or a court order.\n\nÂ Â Â D.Â Â Â Issuance of License\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Upon the filing of a completed application for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license, the Enforcement Officer shall issue a temporary license to the applicant, which temporary license shall expire upon the final decision of the Enforcement Officer to deny or grant the license. Within twenty days after the receipt of a completed application, the Enforcement Officer shall either issue a license, or issue a written notice of intent to deny a license, to the applicant. The Enforcement Officer shall approve the issuance of a license unless one or more of the following is found to be true:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â An applicant is less than 18 years of age.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â An applicant is delinquent in the payment to the City of taxes, fees, fines, or penalties assessed against or imposed upon the applicant in relation to a sexually oriented business.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â An applicant has failed to provide all information and documents required for issuance of the license as requested on the application form, or has provided information or documents as requested on the application that are insufficient on their face; provided, however, that no license shall be denied solely on the ground that an applicant has refused to disclose his/her social security number in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93 579, Â§ 7(a)(1).\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â An applicant has been convicted of a specified criminal activity. The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect under this Subsection. For the purpose of this Subsection, \"conviction:\"\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Means a conviction or a guilty plea; and\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ii.Â Â Â Includes a conviction of any business entity for which the applicant had, at the time of the offense leading to the conviction for a specified criminal activity, a management responsibility or a controlling interest.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The license application fee required by this chapter has not been paid.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The proposed sexually oriented business is located in a zoning district other than a district in which sexually oriented businesses are allowed to operate under the Unified Development Ordinance, or is not in compliance with the location restrictions established for sexually oriented businesses in the appropriate zoning district(s).\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An applicant that is ineligible for a license due to Subsection D. 1. d) of this Section may qualify for a sexually oriented business license only when the time period required by the applicable subsection in Article 11, Specified Criminal Activity, has elapsed.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The license, if granted, shall state on its face the name of the person or persons to whom it is granted, the number of the license issued to that applicant, the expiration date, and, if the license is for a sexually oriented business, the address of the sexually oriented business. A sexually oriented business employee license shall contain a photograph of the licensee. The sexually oriented business license shall be posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the sexually oriented business so that it may be easily read at any time. A sexually oriented business employee shall keep the employee's license on his or her person or on the premises where the licensee is then working or performing, and shall produce such license for inspection upon request by a law enforcement officer or other authorized city official.\n\nÂ Â Â E.Â Â Â Fees\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The non refundable initial license fee and annual renewal fee for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license shall be set by the City Council at an amount determined to be sufficient to pay the cost of administering this program, subject to Subsection 2. herein.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In no event shall the fees exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for the initial license and one hundred twenty five dollars ($125.00) for the renewal fee for a sexually oriented business license. In no event shall the fees exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the initial license, and fifty dollars ($50.00) for the renewal fee, for a sexually oriented business employee license.\n\nÂ Â Â F.Â Â Â Inspection\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â For the purpose of ensuring compliance with this chapter, an applicant, operator or licensee shall, from time to time, but no more than four times a year in total, permit city law enforcement officers and official personnel of any other city department or agency with responsibility for enforcement of this chapter, to inspect, during a licensee's regular business hours, that portion of the premises of a sexually oriented business that is open to the public.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No inspections other than those described in Division 1. of this Subsection above are permitted to enforce this chapter unless consented to by the applicant, operator or licensee or authorized through issuance of a valid search warrant.\n\nÂ Â Â G.Â Â Â Expiration of License\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Each license shall expire one year front the date of issuance and may be renewed only by making application as provided in Section 9.49 C. An application for renewal shall be made at least thirty days before the expiration date, and when made less than thirty days before the expiration date, the expiration of the license will not be affected.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When the City denies renewal of a license, the applicant shall not be issued a license for one year from the date of denial. If, subsequent to the denial, the City finds that the basis for denial of the renewal license has been corrected or abated, the applicant shall be granted a license if at least ninety days have elapsed since the date that the denial became final.\n\nÂ Â Â H.Â Â Â Suspension: The City shall issue a written intent to suspend a license for a period not to exceed thirty days if it determines that a licensee or an employee of a licensee has:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Violated or is not in compliance with any section of this chapter; or\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Refused to allow an inspection of the sexually oriented business premises as authorized by this chapter.\n\nÂ Â Â I.Â Â Â Revocation\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Enforcement Officer shall issue a written statement of intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license if a cause of suspension in Section 9.49 H. occurs and the license has been suspended within the preceding twelve months.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Enforcement Officer shall issue a written statement of intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license if the Officer determines that:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A licensee gave false or misleading information in the material submitted during the application process;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A licensee has knowingly allowed possession, use, or sale of controlled substances on the premises;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A licensee has knowingly allowed prostitution on the premises;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A licensee has knowingly operated the sexually oriented business during a period of time when the licensee's license was suspended;\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â A licensee has knowingly allowed any act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation, masturbation, or other sex act to occur in or on the licensed premises. This Subsection will not apply to an adult motel, unless the licensee knowingly allowed sexual activities to occur either:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â In exchange for money, or\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ii.Â Â Â In a public place or within public view.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â When, after the police and hearing procedure described in Section 9.49 J., the Enforcement Officer revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license for one year from the date revocation becomes effective, provided that, if the conditions of Section 9.49 J. 2. are met, a Provisional License will be granted pursuant to that Section. If, subsequent to revocation, the Enforcement Officer finds that the basis for the revocation found in Divisions 2. a) and 2. d) of this Subsection has been corrected or abated, the applicant shall be granted a license if at least ninety days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective.\n\nÂ Â Â J.Â Â Â Hearing; License Denial, Suspension, Revocation; Appeal.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the Enforcement Officer determines that facts exist for denial, suspension, or revocation of a license under this chapter, the Enforcement Officer shall notify the applicant or licensee (respondent) in writing of the intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, including the grounds therefore, by personal delivery, or by certified mail. The notification shall be directed to the most current business address on file with the Enforcement Officer. Within 5 working days of receipt of such notice, the respondent may provide to the Manager, in writing, a response that shall include a statement of reasons why the license or permit should not be denied, suspended, or revoked. Within three days of the receipt of respondent's written response, the Manager shall notify respondent in writing of the hearing date on respondent's denial, suspension, or revocation proceeding.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Within 10 working days of the receipt of respondent's written response, the Manager shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall have the opportunity to be represented by counsel and present evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf. If a response is not received by the Manager in the time stated or, if after the hearing, the Manager finds that grounds as specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension, or revocation, then such denial, suspension, or revocation shall become final 5 days after the Manager sends, by certified mail, written notice that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked.
