Many, but not all, maintain a website and/or social media presence. Each OEA Local is alphabetically listed within the tabs below.\n\nActive collective bargaining agreements filed with Ohio State Employment Relations Board as 01.01.2024 webmaster@ohea.org\n\nOEA District Association\n\nOEAâ€™s network of 10 district associations assures that Association decisions are made by representatives from all parts of the state. About two-thirds of the OEA Board of Directors is elected from units within the district associations. The number of units each district has depends on its total number of members. Each district association also has a representative on each OEA committee.\n\nThe districts serve as a liaison to the local associations from the OEA, providing professional development opportunities, legislative updates and networking for members. Each district sends its three officers to the District Leaders Council (DLC) to represent their respective district and share information to and from the OEA."
