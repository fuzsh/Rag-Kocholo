        "text": "About: I have lived in Centerville for 19 years with my wife Gina, and our two children; Dylan-17, a Senior and Lauren-15, a Sophomore, both attend Centennial High School.\n\nMy family likes spending time in the Centennial community. We enjoy city trails and spending time outside with friends and neighbors.\n\nThe past 11 years I was as a coach for Dylan and Lauren’s youth hockey and lacrosse teams.\n\nI am part of various committees; Centennial High School Strategic Planning Committee, Centennial Fire District Steering Committee, Centennial Police Department Police Governing Board, Centerville EDA, and I attend Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club meetings,\n\nThe residents who elected me to four consecutive council terms and Mayor, know I keep their best interests in mind when making difficult decisions for the city. Currently the city has an AA+ Bond rating, 63% fund balance, a clean audit, updated city infrastructure, a pavement management plan, new and updated parks, miles of new trails, an action plan for a new downtown/commercial development, and new businesses have come to Centerville. I have worked hard on finding creative solutions to keep the city portion of taxes as low as possible the past 16 years.\n\nImportant Issues: Centerville needs to continue to grow our tax base with commercial development. The new Ruffridge Johnson building being constructed is a 35,000 square ft. $2.6 million facility. We hired a realtor to market city owned properties, and our city Administrator has been very active marketing Centerville to prospective businesses.\n\nThe Waterworks building was removed last year, and Bay View Villas has been proposed, which is 18 executive townhomes. Two additional residential developments are in process; Peltier Estates- 24 detached townhomes, and Old Mill Estates- 35 single family homes.\n\nDowntown development is something I believe in, and we continue to market downtown and our Administrator has had several inquiries recently.\n\nThe city now has a Facebook page and is on Twitter. We did this to communicate with our residents more effectively. We will be live streaming our council meetings in the future.\n\nI will continue to support our Public Safety organizations.\n\nGoals if Elected: My goals are similar to the important issues listed above, because I believe they go hand in hand.\n\nParks and trails need continued upgrades and repairs, as well as new parks and trails added.\n\nThe Fete Des Lacs Celebration continues to grow and took a significant step forward this summer. I would like to see it continue to grow and showcase the city of Centerville. I would like the city to add “Taste of Centerville” to the Festival, where the local restaurants/businesses could showcase their foods, beverages, and wares.\n\nAn EDA was established, and the first meeting is in August. The EDA will assist with bringing new businesses to Centerville and engaging community outreach.\n\nI will continue to be a steward of the citizen’s tax dollars and I will make sure we keep a balanced budget.\n\nEndorsements: None Listed\n\nConnect with Me:"
