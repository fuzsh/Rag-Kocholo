Their shared love of health and fitness and their passion to support their community ensured Scott always carried the best sporting equipment in town. This ethos, along with their Depression-era frugality, helped Scott and Sis to have just enough savings to seize an opportunity in 1971.",

        "text": "CARING AND COMMUNITY\n\nWhile their business success changed the Namesâ family, it never changed the familyâs humility and commitment to serving their community. Scott and Sis remembered their humble beginnings and the struggles of life during the Depression. For them, philanthropy was a part of being human and always the right thing to do.\n\nIn 1996, Scott and Sis started the Names Family Foundation in order to formalize their innate desire to impact their family and their community. Combining their passions for philanthropy and athletics, Scott and Sis put the focus of their foundation on supporting non-profit organizations that emphasized health, wellness and physical education. Today, the influence of the Names Family Foundation can be seen, felt and experienced through the caring attention of their Executive Board.\n\nThe Names Family Foundation Board of Directors is pleased to welcome Trina Gohrick to the Board. Trina is the granddaughter of Scott and Sis Names, and the daughter of Paula Names.Â\n\nâI am so excited and grateful for the unique opportunity to serve on the NFF board and carry on my Grandparentâs legacy. I have been fortunate to have attended a handful of groundbreaking ceremonies, site visits, and events that have honored our grandparents and the foundationâs hard work.Â It has been such an honor to speak to hardworking community members and learn more about their passions to make the world a better place. These opportunities have opened my eyes and restored my faith in the many incredible people who have dedicated their lives to service.â â Trina Gohrick"
