        "text": "Brother Constant is a recurring character in the Apple TV+ series, Foundation. She is part of the Foundation, a member of the Church of the Galactic Spirit, spreading the word of the Prophet Hari Seldon and the hope he brings. Constant is portrayed by Isabella Laughland, first appearing in \"A Glimpse of Darkness\".\n\nBiography[]\n\nBrother Constant is the daughter of Foundation Director Sef Sermak and Pater.[1] Both Constant and her Pater was a Sayta-Thespin, a cultural minority, and kept their given names private.[2]\n\nBrother Constant and Poly Verisof were assigned to preach the word of the Church of the Galactic Spirit on the planet Siwenna in the Red Corridor. Constant was accompanied by her pet and steed, the bishop's claw Beki. One morning, Constant helps her fellow Church member, Poly, overcome a drunken state. She takes him to see a death threat towards the Foundation in the form of a crucified body near their camp on Siwenna. Knowing this as a sign of aggression towards the Foundation, they prepare for a later ambush on themselves.[1]\n\nLater, Constant tries to drum up interest in a show but is cut short after locals try to apprehend her. After using her aura to protect herself, Poly flies down from their ship and the pair put on a show, resisting efforts from locals to remove them. They are called away mid-performance though as they are recalled to Terminus - the Vault has opened.[1]\n\nConstant returns home with Poly and greets her Pater and her father, Director Sef Sermak, where they discuss next steps for the Vault. She is present outside the Vault when it opens and Warden Jaegger Fount is killed, asking who \"Hober Mallow\" was as his name was etched into the surface of the Vault.[1]\n\nConstant joins Poly in attempting to retrieve Hober Mallow, travelling to Korell. They arrive just as he is due to be executed by Commdor Argo. Poly attempts to delay the execution but fails, although Hober has things well in hand by escaping using a castling device that switches the bodies of two people via teleportation. Constant is impressed by his confidence, but Poly realises that Hober will try and steal their jumpship to escape. The pair catch up to him just as he leaves the planet, and Constant stops him from leaving the ship in a escape pod.[3]\n\nConstant arrives on Terminus with Poly and Hober, and she discusses with the latter their respective histories with the Foundation. When they land, Constant takes Hober to Director Sermak and she hugs her father, having not seen him for some time. With no activity at the Vault, the group goes for a private meeting.[2]\n\nAfter a brief discussion, it is agreed Hober should go into the Vault which he does so unwilling after seeing the remains of Warden Jaegger Fount. He is followed shortly after by Constant, Poly and Sermak. After some searching, the group find an artificial version of Hari Seldon. Constant is shocked and in awe of the Prophet, who in turn blesses her. He sets Constant and Poly a mission to go to Trantor to spread the word of the Foundation and attempt to delay the impending war, which will be key to its success. Hober stays behind to speak with Hari.[2]\n\nConstant and Poly wait for Hober to exit and Constant is sad Hober is going on a separate mission and not going with them. She expressed her interest in him, and hoped that they would become closer.[2]\n\nConstant and Poly arrive at Trantor via a commercial jumpship arrives at Trantor. As Constant is released from the jumppod, she strikes up a conversation with the Spacer, She-Shines-Brightly. Having never met a Spacer before, Constant remarks that she had no idea that genetic engineering could be so elegant. Out of the pod, she stands with Poly, viewing Trantor through a viewport. Constant finds it hard to believe a place like Trantor could fall. As they enter Trantor Station, Constant says she never thought she would again see this sight, noting that she dreamt of something like this as a child. Poly is first to enter customs, talking to Agent Timandra, telling her that he is an envoy from the Outer Reach arriving to open diplomatic negotiations. When Poly is told that the Empire no longer recognises some of the planets in the Outer Reach, he points out that is the situation they are there to address. Constant is added to Poly's provisional visa and allowed to enter the station. Constant looks up their hotel, but Poly has other ideas; at least for tonight, they are on the Prophet's expense account.[4]\n\nConstant and Poly arrive at their hotel, with Poly feeling a little worse for wear. As they talk, Poly asks Constant to flush his supply of vordaline dust. Having been a drunk and an addict for over a century, his encounter with the Prophet has made him want to try something new. Poly tells Constant her faith is pure because of the difference between belief and faith. Poly believes, because he saw Seldon emerge from the Vault with his own eyes. Constant had only second and thirdhand accounts, but it was enough to give her faith. The moment is interrupted by Imperial forces led by Timandra, who arrest and sensory shroud them, telling them their stay has been extended indefinitely.[4]\n\nBrought before the Genetic Dynasty, Constant and Poly try to broker peace with them. As Constant watches Poly try to convince Day to form a deal with the Foundation, Day wants to see what she has to say. She moves forward to speak and the form of Hari Seldon appears in front of her, who has been residing in her brain since when they met inside the Vault. As Hari fails to broker a deal, guards electrocute Constant, separating her consciousness from Hari's. She falls to the ground, saying to Poly that she knew Hari was in her head, but she couldn’t say anything. Day asks what kind of ghost or Prophet would do that to someone, with a hint of irony given the nature and existence of Day.[5]\n\nConstant is lead out with Poly to an execution platform with spectators, cameras, and the Cleon delegation. The pair go on their knees as Day gives a speech about the Foundation and their history on Terminus. He will use the Collar of Typhon to perform the execution and he gives Sareth the choice of who to execute. When she doesn’t, he decides it is time to end Constant’s suffering. As Day puts the collar around her neck, Poly apologises to her and she begins to pray. As the execution begins, Hober Mallow arrives on a whisper ship, crashing into the platform, knocking everyone off their feet.[6]\n\nConstant still has the collar around her neck and it has partially closed around her, drawing blood. Hober leads her away back to the ship as Becky is killed and Poly is take prisoner. They escape to Trantor’s orbit and Hober is able - through guessing - to get the collar off Constant. Later, the pair discuss the Spacers and Hober apologises for Becky being killed and not being able to save Poly. Constant reveals that Poly is the reason she joined and stayed in the Church. The pair decide they should seize the moment and they have sex. Waking up afterwards, they make a promise to attend each other’s executions. As Hober goes to grab the wine, Bel Riose arrives in his ship and says to Hober that they will dock - they should not try to run.[6]\n\nAboard the Destiny, Constant and Hober are visited by Bel Riose, where they wonder why they’re not dead. Hober tells Bel about the casting device that they confiscated and Hober tells them about it, helping them realise the Foundation has some advanced technology. Constant further explains how she sees the war ending. Hober hears Bel give his assessment of how Empire is faring, including that Empire will fall - just not yet. Later, Cleon XVII passes Hober and Constant’s cell and Hober chastises him, prompting Day to get the pair transferred to the bridge. There, Hober continues to needle Day, prompting Day to exclaim that he is retaliating after Hober’s stunt on Trantor. Hober and Constant watch in horror as Terminus is completely destroyed as the Invictus is sent plummeting down to the planet.[7]\n\nConstant watches Day as he orders Bel to prepare for the fleet to jump. Not to Trantor, but to seven planets the Foundation has a foothold on. He wants to start with Thespis to spite Constant and also wants to throw Siwenna on the list for good measure. As Bel disobeys Day’s order, the Spacer agrees to carry out the order, but notices an anomaly with the jump sequence as ships start jumping into each other. They cannot be stopped, and Hober tells Day that being captured by the Spacers was a ruse - they made a deal with Hari much to Constant’s surprise. They baited Day to Terminus with his entire fleet due to how predictable Day is. Day attacks Hober and the pair fight. Bel then intervenes and is able to defeat Day, sending him out of the airlock into space.[8]\n\nThe ship is stranded as ships around them crash into each other. There is an external cleaning module with enough air for one person for a day. Constant is nominated to use by Hober as she has a way to bringing hope to people. Constant reluctantly gets in the module and is launched. While in space, Constant’s module is picked up by a ship the resembles the Vault. She sees Poly who is pleased to see her and he asks where Hober is. She watches on as Hari explains the plan to sacrifice Terminus so the Foundation can survive. All the residents of Terminus make themselves known, including her fathers.[8]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason Two\n\n\"A Glimpse of Darkness\" (First appearance)\n\n\"King and Commoner\"\n\n\"Where the Stars Are Scattered Thinly\"\n\n\"Why the Gods Made Wine\"\n\n\"A Necessary Death\"\n\n\"Long Ago, Not Far Away\"\n\n\"Creation Myths\""
