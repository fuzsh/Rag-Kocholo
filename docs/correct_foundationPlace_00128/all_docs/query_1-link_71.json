        "text": "Collecting information about getting postmarketOS running on Symbian devices. The important part is getting the Linux kernel running of course, if we can find one that run at one point (which probably does not exist?), then it's just doing the regular porting guide. Symbian was open sourced for one year, maybe that helps. Please add any helpful information or links that you can find.\n\nProblems on Nokia devices\n\nThe OMAP registers on newer Nokia Symbian devices has been remapped from the original OMAP specs. This is because Nokia doesn't want anyone to flash their Symbian devices with other non-Symbian operating systems, and to prevent that, Nokia contacted Texas Instruments, the makers and manufacturers of OMAP, to make special OMAP chips for Nokia Symbian devices that has the remapped registers, making it harder to port operating systems to Nokia Symbian devices.\n\nEven though this change has been made on Nokia Symbian devices, this hasn't stopped the community to port Linux to Nokia Symbian devices, as people tried to uncover the remapped OMAP registers on Nokia devices.\n\nSymbian Foundation\n\nSymbian was in fact made open source, at one point.\n\nThe final repositories from the Symbian Foundation may be found here. It may be of limited use, although the code has no doubt not been maintained for a long time.\n\nBarely started Linux on Symbian phone projects\n\nLinux on Nokia N70\n\nSee also"
