        "text": "Upwards of 35,000 homes in a radius of Stafford Springs, Connecticut, are facing the potential for a failed concrete foundation due to the possible presence of a naturally occurring iron sulfide, pyrrhotite, in their concrete foundation. The concrete originated from the JJ Mottes Concrete Company in Stafford Springs, Connecticut, during the years 1983 - 2015. The mineral is found in a Willington, Connecticut, quarry that no longer supplies aggregate for residential foundations.\n\nPyrrhotite causes the slow deterioration of the concrete when exposed to oxygen and water. While the presence of pyrrhotite indicates the potential for concrete deterioration, its existence alone does not necessarily cause it.\n\nThe cracking starts small and may take more than 10 years to over 30 years to appear. Horizontal cracks or cracks that splinter out like a web are the most concerning. A rust color residue or white powder may appear. The sheetrock walls of a finished basement may need to be removed to examine the concrete. As the concrete deteriorates, it often becomes structurally unsound.\n\nThe damage is irreversible. The repair is to fully replace the impacted foundation with a new foundation that does not contain pyrrhotite.\n\nThe State of Connecticut is providing financial assistance to homeowners who have a crumbling foundation, due to pyrrhotite, where the home, condo, Planned Unit Development, or home addition was built after January 1, 1983, and before December 31, 2015.\n\nTowns Identified by CRCOG as having been impacted by Crumbling Foundations\n\nTESTING FOR PYRRHOTITE\n\nHomeowners who suspect their foundation may be showing signs of cracking should have the foundation tested by a VISUAL test and/or a CORE test. At this time, the only test that can definitively confirm the presence of pyrrhotite is a CORE test.\n\nA VISUAL test is a licensed professional engineer’s (PE) expert opinion based on education, observation, and prior experience that the foundation’s cracking is due to incompatible materials in the concrete mix. This visual report describes the current condition of the concrete and cannot predict if un-cracked concrete will deteriorate at a later date.\n\nA CORE test determines the presence, or absence, of pyrrhotite and the percent of pyrrhotite that exists in the sample. It requires drilling out a 4 inch diameter cylinder from the concrete which is sent to a lab for analysis. The concrete is plugged after the core sample is removed.\n\nThe State of Connecticut is assisting homeowners, in the affected area, with the cost of testing their foundation. Two opportunities for testing payment assistance are available.\n\nI. The State of Connecticut allocated $5 million to reimburse homeowners for the cost of testing their concrete foundation. The Capitol Region Council of Governments (CRCOG) is administering the program for the State of Connecticut.\n\nEligibility requirements for this program include:\n\nVisual Inspections must be performed by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE).\n\nThe home was built on or after January 1, 1983, and before December 31, 2015.\n\nIf the home was built before 1983, but an addition was constructed during the years 1983 to 2015, then the foundation of the addition is eligible for testing under the program.\n\nThe home is in Connecticut and within 20 miles radius of J.J. Mottes Concrete Company in Stafford Springs. A waiver application for homes outside of the 20 mile radius is available.\n\nCORE Testing will be reimbursed at 50%, up to $2,000, for pyrrhotite testing of up to 2 core samples.\n\nVISUAL inspection, performed by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE), will be reimbursed at 100% up to $400.\n\nHomeowners are eligible for the program.\n\nHomeowners are eligible to receive reimbursement for both visual and core testing on the same property. However, each house is eligible for reimbursement for only one visual examination and one set of core tests.\n\nFor full details on the program and an application for reimbursement, visit: www.foundationtesting.org or contact CRCOG at 860-724-4277.\n\nII. The State of Connecticut, Department of Housing, through a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) has provided funding to eligible municipalities for a foundation testing program. A CDBG crumbling foundations testing program may cover 100% of the costs to test a foundation for pyrrhotite, up to $5,000. There may be other qualifiers. Residents should contact the town before arranging any testing.\n\nResidents in Ellington, Stafford and Vernon should apply directly to their town before they begin testing.\n\nREDUCTION IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT\n\nConnecticut Public Act 16-45 requires municipal assessors to inspect and reassess residential properties with foundations made from defective concrete at the property owner's request. To request this reassessment, contact your town and submit a written report by a CT licensed professional engineer (PE). The property must be inspected and its assessment adjusted within 90 days after the report has been submitted or the next assessment year, whichever is earlier.\n\nThis new assessment is valid for 5 years or until the foundation is repaired or replaced, whichever is earlier. Homeowners who repair or replace the foundation have 30 days to notify the assessor in writing. The property must be inspected and reassessed by the town within 90 days of the notification or before the next assessment year, whichever is earlier.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nInsurance companies cannot cancel or refuse to renew a homeowner's policy due to a crumbling foundation. If you believe this has happened to you, you should file a complaint with the Connecticut Insurance Department or call the Connecticut Department of Insurance, Consumer Affairs Unit at 1-800-203-3447.\n\nLEGISLATION\n\nPA 18-179\n\nSummary of PA 18-179\n\nThis bill codifies the residential disclosure report home sellers must provide to purchasers and expands what must be included in it. It includes:\n\ndisclosures on the building's structure and any improvements made to it, including questions on, among other things, the roof, exterior, driveway, and the types of testing, inspection, or repairs done to the foundation; and\n\nA new statement on concrete foundations that states “prospective buyers may have a concrete foundation inspected by a licensed professional engineer who is a structural engineer for deterioration of the foundation due to the presence of pyrrhotite.”\n\nThe bill allows a member of the CFSIC’s board of directors, who owns a residential property with a crumbling foundation, or his or her spouse or dependent child, to apply for and receive assistance from CFSIC. It does so by deeming that such a circumstance does not constitute a conflict of interest, provided that the board member abstains from deliberating, voting, or taking any other action on his or her specific application.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2018 for the residential disclosure report provisions, June 2018 for the CFSIC provisions.\n\nPA 18-160\n\nSummary of PA 18-160\n\nThis bill imposes a $12 surcharge on certain homeowners insurance policies issued, renewed, amended, or endorsed between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2029 to be deposited into the Healthy Homes Fund which the bill establishes.\n\nThe bill establishes the Healthy Homes Fund, a separate non lapsing General Fund account to collect insurance surcharge funds to in part help homeowners with concrete foundations damaged from pyrrhotite.
