        "text": "There are certain words which you cannot use without first having permission to use that word, e.g. Dentist\n\nCan I Use a 'Sensitive' or 'Restricted' Word when Forming a Company?\n\nThe word ‘foundation’ is also deemed sensitive and requires slightly special treatment before Companies House will allow its inclusion in a company name.\n\nIn nearly all cases when using ‘Foundation’ the company type should be limited by guarantee. This is because ‘Foundation’ is primarily used by a not for profit organisation, and it is therefore rarely appropriate for it to be used in an LLP name because the LLP is formed as a for-profit business.\n\nAssuming the name including the word FOUNDATION is available, then you will see the below help message.\n\nPool of Money\n\nThe company or business should have a pool of money or a regular source of finance available to promote its objects. You will need to confirm this when you submit your application. Here is some specimen wording.\n\nYou can include the Pool of Money wording in the Articles but this sometimes gets missed by the CH examiners and so it better to prepare a separate letter. You should make sure that the letter is signed by the 'We' and that their full names are given.\n\nArticles\n\nThe articles of association should describe the main activities and include a non-profit distribution clause, which provides that any profits should be used to further the objects of the company and not paid to the members as dividends.\n\nNote: To be exempt from using Limited the articles will need to include a dissolution clause."
