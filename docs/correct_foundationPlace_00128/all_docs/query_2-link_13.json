        "text": "This list is the result of a research, carried out by ARCO’s Social Economy Unit about the top 100 largest philanthropic foundations in the world by total assets; it is based on up to date financial data concerning the period 2016-2018. The sources mostly used, are the financial statements published by the foundations and the Foundation Centre database. We included the country where the foundation was established, the founding year and the official website.\n\nThe objective is to provide a complete list of the largest philanthropic foundations in the world.\n\nAt the first place there is the Dutch Stichting INGKA Foundation. It has been established by the founder of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad and its philanthropic activity underpins on the support to architectural and interior design innovation. Recently it extended its philanthropic agenda to the fight against poverty in developing countries. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation comes after Stichting INGKA at the second place. The US foundation mainly acts in the field of medical research, fight against AIDS and malaria, reduction of extreme poverty and education. Third, the Lilly Endowment, dedicated to community development, education, and Christianity.\n\nThe majority of the foundations are from USA, followed by European ones, mostly from UK. We did not take consortium into account."
