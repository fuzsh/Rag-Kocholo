        "text": "Despite its former dominance in the mobile phone industry, Nokia’s failure serves as a reminder of the importance of staying ahead of market trends and continuing to innovate in order to remain competitive.\n\nIt was October 1998, and Nokia was the industry leader in mobile phone sales all over the world. Since the early days of the mobile phone industry, Nokia had been synonymous with business success and quality products. The phones were available worldwide, covering low-end to high-end prices to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nBy 1999, the company’s profit had reached $4 billion. It seemed that they could do no wrong. Even in June 2007, when Apple introduced the first iPhone, Nokia still retained 50% of the customer base. For a long time, its young leadership led the brand to success through loyal customers and repeat business.\n\nBut in 2010, things took a turn for the worse… It took only six years for Nokia to lose around 90% of its market value, and the company never recovered. Critical mistakes led to the mobile phone giant’s fall from grace.\n\nNokia’s history only serves to prove that no business is infallible, especially in the face of technological progress and changing customer expectations.\n\nWhat were some of their critical mistakes?\n\nCocky leadership, a lack of vision, and inferior technology were the unholy trinity of errors that contributed to Nokia’s downfall. They ignored implied customer feedback, lost customer loyalty, and unlike most companies in the mobile phone space, failed to keep up with evolving services and tech. Here’s what you can learn from their biggest mistakes and errors in judgment.\n\nNokia failed to adapt to changing consumer expectations and reposition itself in the market. After Apple introduced its game-changing smartphone, a large group of consumers saw what the future of the industry could provide. They understood the long-term benefits of developing mobile technology better than Nokia did.\n\nSo, here’s one of the first lessons from Nokia that you should learn: never rely solely on your brand’s reputation to retain customers and acquire new ones.\n\nNokia repeatedly failed by relying on the same inferior technology, despite changing customer needs… All because it knew that most of the target audience still felt very positive towards the manufacturer.\n\nBeing an industry leader will only get you so far. Once the demand for your product goes away, your reputation will change for the worse if you don’t adapt quickly… And customer retention (and with it, customer lifetime value) will suffer the same fate.\n\nNokia never had a strong marketing strategy in the smartphone industry, at least not like its competitors did.\n\nWhat did Apple and Samsung do? Each year they announced their new smartphone version – with improved features and services. These marketing messages were all about creating anticipation and generating excitement. It kept people interested and attracted new customers.\n\nAnother lesson to take away from the Nokia disaster is that marketing is as important as the product itself. Create a flagship product, but don’t forget to position it accordingly.\n\nEven if you only make small improvements to your product over time, strategic marketing can still generate excitement for minor upgrades too.\n\nOnce the competition in the industry got fiercer, Nokia began to crumble from the inside. Different departments stopped coordinating and began competing – and customer experiences suffered because of it.\n\nSo, where did Nokia go wrong?\n\nIt failed in its organizational structure and interdepartmental communication. Insufficient coordination among departments often leads to a variety of operational issues. In Nokia’s case, it led to many delays in the development of their OS.\n\nWhy is this important to you?\n\nBecause departments that are out of sync fall behind in their delivery of products, research, upgrades, and more. This leads to losing out to competitors and contributes to a rapid loss of existing customers.\n\nThe Nokia leadership that once brought success couldn’t adapt to the new trends. By most accounts, the top managers created a dictatorial culture, rather than an addressing customer needs in innovative ways.\n\nWhen times get tough, you have to adapt… But before you do that, you need to learn how to change. Always embrace new ideas from employees and nurture a culture of listening and learning.\n\nRemember that the culture doesn’t grow from the bottom up. It’s the other way around. Leaders should establish clear cultural values and lead by example.\n\nEmpower your employees and encourage collaboration and innovation. It’s critical in establishing a strong foundation and culture, both of which are building blocks of a strong business and changing with customer needs.\n\nThe lack of innovation and understanding at Nokia didn’t come solely from bad leadership decisions and out-of-sync departments. The cellphone maker had experienced massive, rapid growth. In fact, the business model targeted financial growth and not innovation – or evolving buying habits.\n\nTherefore, when it needed to change to meet customer expectations, the company didn’t have the resources to sustain innovation. Nokia didn’t have a vision for the future. Everything was about short-term gains, and nothing prepared them for competing in a new field with new customer needs.\n\nYou can avoid this by managing your resources wisely. Assess your position often and explore new directions you could pivot to through market research, customer feedback, focus groups, and beyond.\n\nEven if you don’t make a dramatic shift, it’s still good to know what your options are… And how much you might have to set aside to compete on a different playing field.\n\nAnother aspect of Nokia’s failing was not having the right people in the right places. Its top management lacked the technical understanding to compete in the new market, and middle management didn’t have the motivation to make specific issues and customer pain points about their services known.\n\nA company culture based on open communication can solve some of these problems, but it’s not enough for ideas to reach the ears of upper management. Management needs to have an understanding of those ideas, too.\n\nTo solidify your company, you need a great hiring process. Focus on people who can solve existing problems, and place them in positions with the power to do something about those problems that create customer churn."
