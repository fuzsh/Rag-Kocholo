        "text": "Milestone anniversaries will always draw attention. One hundred years deserves so much more. When I imagine where the Foundation started in 1922, I am struck by the magnitude and importance of the Foundation today. With assets exceeding $3 billion, the University of Oregon Foundation is a meaningful contributor to the financial health and wellbeing of the university, its faculty, students and staff. It is an honor and a privilege to be part of this organization and witness firsthand the impact it has on the University of Oregon.\n\n​\n\nStewardship is an important theme for our staff. We recognize that each one of us plays a vital role and that our roles are temporary in comparison to the longevity of the Foundation. While today we are celebrating one hundred years of service, we are proud that the Foundation will be here for hundreds of years to come, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we leave the organization in a better place for those who will come after us. Leading with our values of Trust, Integrity, Commitment and Respect in every action and interaction has been integral in remaining good stewards of the assets we manage on behalf of donors and the university.\n\nThe Foundation is legally separate from the University of Oregon, but we exist to serve the university and its donors. The partnership we share with our colleagues at the university is strong and we are aligned. The financial success and growth of the endowment is due in large part to this incredible partnership, the generosity of our donors and a commitment to helping the university continue on the path of excellence.\n\nThe Trustees of the Foundation are and have been the organization’s guiding lights. In the years I have been here, the generosity and commitment of Foundation Trustees has been inspiring and we are all grateful for their guidance, passion and support. Like the staff at the Foundation, our Trustees are devoted to doing what is right and making the organization better. I can say with confidence that the ethos present in the Trustees who are currently serving is consistent with those who have served over the last one hundred years.\n\nThe Foundation is healthy and strong at 100 and the future is very bright for decades to come. I am proud to share this remarkable milestone with you. Thank you for your continued support of the Foundation and the University of Oregon."
