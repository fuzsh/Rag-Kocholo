        "text": "One of the slight pleasures I get, is when I tell people that I work for Nokia and seeing their reaction. Usually it’s either one of, “they still exist??”, or “the phone company?” or even “Oh yea I remember that ringtone”. Invariably though, they recognize the name, they know the field of work, and more times than not they recall (depending on the age of the person I’m talking to) a seemingly ‘indestructible’ phone.\n\nIt’s often hard to part them of this meme. Finding that if I tell them we focus a lot of delivery of software in teleco, I’m met with blank stares…and then a follow up about how good those phones were. It’s not a great feeling when you’re suspecting that your best days are behind you. I watch my parents age into retirement and post retirement and it’s hard to see them have to adjust to being able to do less, and coming to gripes with people expecting less from them.\n\nI would hate to get to a point in my life where I prematurely am considered on the decline before I ever actually accomplish anything. While I fully admit the days of me coming up with some great revolutionary formula, or writing the Great American Novel may not be in the cards, I would like to think that there’s many stones unturned ahead of me.\n\nOf course getting too comfortable in your one single goal or skill set is certain death. As much as the ‘golden phone’ is lovingly remembered, it’s no coincidence that it’s the last big inflection point that many people know Nokia for. No slight against Nokia, I think we got a bit lax in our business, which if we compare to Blackberry seems like we dodged a bullet, and pivoted when we saw that ship sink. It’s interesting to see the public perception of which companies are looked favorably upon after their prime. When you mention Blockbuster, or Blackberry, usually I get the sense of a pity and a joking almost mockery of falling behind the times. And for Blackberry, it’s especially harmful sense they are doing well enough just focusing in another field, away from phones. The problem is once the reputation and cultural zeitgeist claims you, the narrative is already spun and it’s very hard to unweave that cocoon.\n\nSomething that I’ve only recently found out existed (which tells me there’s some marketing that needs to be done on our part), is the Nokia Common Software Foundation.\n\nThe NSF as it were, can be thought of as a collection of Opensource software from various developers in the FOSS community, which are modified, and added to under opensource licensing to be beneficial to the Nokia platforms. So what we have is a ‘library’ of foundational software projects, that are retrofitted with teleco relevant additions. That way when we develop things like the NCS, or need software for the Cloud Native SBC, or Cloud Native UDM, etc, we have a library to pull from first. The tools here aren’t entirely comprehensive yet. Platforms like the NCS have taken from the CSF but also has had to go directly to opensource projects. For example, the CSF has products in all manner of categories including Ignite, Apache Flink, Analytics Data Lake for Analytics, Harbor for Image support, MariaDB, and Cassandra for Databases, Prometheus and Zabbix for Telemetry, etc… Now the NCS project pulls from a few of these, but adds in things like coreDNS, Jaeger etc.. Each service can either be a base component, which is the independent software package that acts alone… or part of a “blueprint” which is a set of components to make up a service together. For example the Telemetry is a set of components so it’s a “B-Tel” (Blueprint Telemetry module)\n\nWhat Nokia is trying to build here is a common bedrock for usage across it’s unified cloud platform. As the kids say, “I’m here for it.” I really love the idea of unifying communications…unifying standards and definitely unifying software platforms. I can’t speak for other Telecos. Hell I can barely speak for this one. But I really do hope that the idea of crafting a solid base of architecture and using common threads like helm charts and open source code to string it all together. The primary (and now deprecating BCMT Blueprint for Container Management was our first iteration of having the CNF-A style, on baremetal and it was a rudimentary version of an idea…. Now the CNF-B model is on the rise and it seems to have a lot of momentum coming with it.\n\nFrom an interview done with TelecomTV.com, Bhaskar Gorti, leader of our Nokia Software branch, suggests that the “M&A” is still on the table. (Mergers and Acquisitions).. Now its no secret that not all companies, especially with tech related things, will re-invent the wheel.\n\nI really like the idea…while I adore our ‘we make tough cell phones’ heritage that’s taken on a meme all of it’s own, I think I enjoy more the ever moving forward platform we’re creating to offer this Network as a Service and Software as a Service model. Creating a common platform seems like the first big step to getting towards a set of core products that have our own ‘brand’. Having the right ‘tool’ for the job in our shed of software seems so valuable. My only worry is that this seems like we can easily balloon the library of CSF software to an unmanageable, and confusing amount. Something having too much redundant software just for the sake of keeping a diverse profile can be a detriment. I’d rather see the CSF have a few well tested, documented and known software applications instead of hundreds of software applications that have no support, no documentation, and little understanding of how or what it’s contributing.\n\nI’m really excited to follow the development of the Common Software Foundation. It’s very pie in the sky and one of those business models that sort of crosses over into the ‘for the greater good’. Despite me not being a dedicated programmer I do really appreciate the idea of making sure the opensource community of software is well supported and a viable place to develop from. Unlike many I don’t have some edgy chip on my shoulder against Microsoft, however I do believe it’s imperative that we focus on FOSS services. Not only does it allow much easier, and seamless innovation, it allows someone let myself to go to Github and find code and be able to teach myself through real life example.\n\nI leave you with a few articles about CSF and how it could be if embraced. I for one welcome our Opensource Common Software overlords.\n\nhttps://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/06/25/nokia-launches-cloud-native-digital-operations-center-software-to-drive-5g-monetization/"
