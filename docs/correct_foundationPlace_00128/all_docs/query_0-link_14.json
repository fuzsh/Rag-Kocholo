        "text": "rabble.coop is currently working on a data visualisation for a project in England. Having completed The State of Belfast map for Take Back the City in 2021, what is immediately striking is the availability of data in England compared to what's provided by the Stormont administration. Case in point: some of the most critical datasets for preparing a city to meet the climate emergency - particularly coastal and port cities - are flood maps. In England, Scotland and Wales these are readily available; the data is not simply viewable through a restrictive interface, it is open, downloadable and available to use. Interested parties can use the data in a range of ways - to visualise and enhance public awareness, develop relevant proposals and initiatives as well as provide evidence based critiques of government policy. In doing so, the open data is a necessary component in mobilising societal resources to meet the challenges of climate change. Protecting public interest data behind a prohibitive paywall means that access is effectively denied to those without the resources, expertise or professional networks. Evidenced-based planning for climate change is left in the hands of the same interests who are responsible for the status quo. The optimist in me hopes the new Minister for Infrastructure John O'Dowd MLA can sort this. The realist in me expects we'll have to figure out a way to open up public data in spite of them. https://lnkd.in/eq2JZv4h\n\n\"Supporting organisations to use software compatible with their ethos requires a mixture of education, capacity building and customised technical support. We need to understand how to build coalitions between social movements and technologists that enable us to produce technologies that server our interests, respect our privacy and safeguard our autonomy.\" In December, rabble.coop delivered training to members of the Equality Coalition providing practical tips for NGOs on digital security. We were asked to contribute an article to Just News in the aftermath. Check out the latest edition - its filled with excellent content on budget cuts to women's sector organisations, Irish language rights, Brexit & the Common Travel Area and outstanding legacy challenges from the peace agreement. https://lnkd.in/e99qNrSA\n\nOver 170,000 workers will walk off the job today in the biggest strike the northern state has witnessed in a generation. They aren't just striking for a pay rise, but for the survival of critical services that have been gradually undermined over three decades. Listen to UNISON member Deborah Yapicioz: “As I’m speaking to you now, outside Craigavon hospital, there are eight ambulances with people in them waiting to be brought into the hospital.\" “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified, now it’s just firefighting the whole time.\" “We need actions, not words, and I would say to Chris Heaton-Harris, we are ready to fight tooth and nail for our NHS to keep our services in-house, to get safe staffing, and to give our community the service that they require and that they deserve.” Shame on the British government for using public sector workers - nurses, home care workers, education staff, transport workers and more - as pawns in political negotiations. Solidarity with every worker on the picket line today. https://lnkd.in/d-NDj8Sj\n\nThe head of the DWP \"really hopes\" that his department's use of Artificial Intelligence algorithms to identify \"fraudsters\" does not repeat the UK's Post Office Horizon scandal. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that \"hoping\" (even with the \"really\" adverb attached) is not an acceptable safeguard for ensuring that people receive the (already inadequate) social security support they have a right to. https://lnkd.in/dCUF9ANb\n\nJust had a meeting with a partner looking to ditch Mailchimp for a more affordable option. We're going to self-host an alternative for them - using the excellent www.listmonk.app and our own email server. That Mailchimp seem to have gone aggressively anti-union, means our partner will now be using tech which aligns with their values. Good people don't break unions. Don't support the ones who do. https://lnkd.in/ed4cZhGa"
