        "text": "History of Augmented Reality\n\nDifferent sources trace the history of augmented reality back to the beginning of the 20th century, but it can be said that seminal work was done in the 1960s by Ivan Sutherlands and others. The term augmented reality however was coined by Thomas P. Caudellin the 80s (Caudell & Mizell, 07.01.1992 - 10.01.1992) (PDF).\n\nAncient Precursors\n\nIn 1584, Giambattista della Porta publishes a book entitled âMagia Naturalisâ, in which he presents the concept of a room in which you have a glass pane set up in a way that it reflects light bouncing off of objects in a different position, creating the illusion as if these objects were somewhere else than they actually are. This is pretty much the earliest description of Augmented Reality we have discovered so far, and the principle of reflection off a semi-transparent mirror is still popular today for head-mounted displays, albeit slightly miniaturized.\n\nLet there be a chamber wherein no other light comes, unless by the door or window where the spectator looks in. Let the whole window or part of it be of glass, as we use to do to keep out the cold. But let one part be polished, that there may be a Looking-glass on bothe sides, whence the spectator must look in. For the rest do nothing. Let pictures be set over against this window, marble statues and suchlike. For what is without will seem to be within, and what is behind the spectatorâs back, he will think to be in the middle of the house, as far from the glass inward, as they stand from it outwardly, and clearly and certainly, that he will think he sees nothing but truth. But lest the skill should be known, let the part be made so where the ornament is, that the spectator may not see it, as above his head, that a pavement may come between above his head. And if an ingenious man do this, it is impossible that he should suppose that he is deceived.\n\nIn 1862, John Henry Pepper (1821-1900) and Henry Dircks (1806-1873) create an illusion (projection) technique, called Pepperâs ghost, used in the theatre.\n\nThe basic trick here is that there are two rooms built on the stage, one that people can see into, the other one (called blue room) that is hidden. For the illusion, you set up a big glass in the main room at a 45-degree angle that is able to reflect the view of the blue room towards the audience in order to project âfloatingâ ghost objects onto the spatiality of the twin room.\n\nDircks had come up with the idea, but failed to market it. Pepper teamed up with him, modified the lay-out (reducing installation costs), and made it popular.\n\nThe technique is still in use for modern projection AR, in particular in theatres (using silver-threaded gauze and short-throw projectors instead of glass and lighting objects in order to avoid the need for a twin âblueâ room).\n\nIn 1958, early head-up displays (HUDs) are used for the military, in fighter planes, superimposing graphics onto the real world by projecting onto a glass plane in the field of view of the pilot. This requires the pilot no longer to look âheads-downâ at the instruments, hence the name âheads-upâ. This way, AR can display on any transparent display.\n\nIn 1945, head-mounted display history was written, when Henry McCollum patented the first Stereoscopic Television Apparatus.\n\nIn 1960, Morten Heiling also patented a stereoscopic television HMD for individual use. By many, this device is seen as the mother of all smart glasses, highlighting its importance (together with Heiligâs Sensorama for VR) as a milestone in the history of computing.\n\nIn 1961, Philcoâs Headsight-Remote Camera Viewing system came out. The helmet included a video screen and tracking system.\n\nIn 1968, Sutherland and Sproull developed the âSword of Damoclesâ that is the first augmented reality head-mounted display (HMD) and tracking system.\n\nIn the 1960ies and 1970ies, the US Airforce develops several versions of helmet-mounted displays (HMD) in aircraft to project data in front of pilotsâ eyes.\n\n1980ies, the concept of AR is picked up by the film industry, embedding the idea into the story line of works such as âThe Terminatorâ (1984), âRobocopâ (1987), and âThey liveâ (1988).\n\nIn 1992, the term âAugmented Realityâ was coined at Boeing in a publication by Thomas P. Caudell and David W. Mizell.\n\nIn 1992, virtual fixture was the first immersive Augmented Reality system in order to improve immersive experience.\n\nIn 1994, Azuma develops the motion stabilized display for outdoor use and it is marker-based tracking technology.\n\nIn 1995, fiducial tracking in video was introduced by Bajura and Neumann.\n\nIn 1996, UNC hybrid magnetic-vision trackers are developed, providing an accurate and robust tracking system for AR application.\n\nIn the same year, the MIT wearable computing group founded by Steve Mann, experimenting with smart glasses, amongst others.\n\nIn 1997, the Touring Machine sees the light of day, a 3D mobile augmented reality systems for exploring the urban environment, developed by Steven Feiner, Blair Maclntyre, Tobias Hoellerer, and Anthony Webster. It uses a backpack with laptop and a head-mounted display.\n\nIn 1999, ARToolKit is released, the first open source tracking library.\n\nIn 2001, the first attempt to build an AR browser with web technology took place, Real World Wide Web, later leading to Argon (2009).\n\nIn 2007, âA team led by Markus Kahari unveiled a prototype of the system at the intentional Symopsium on Mixed and AR. The team added a GPS sensor, a compass, and accelerometers to a Nokia smart phoneâ reported by MIT technology review.\n\nIn 2008, Wiktibude is a mobile AR technology providing location-based AR experiences.\n\nIn 2009, the LAYAR company was founded, allowing layering of magazine covers and other print media with an overlay AR experience on mobile phones.\n\nThe same year, Argon is released, the first open technology browser for Augmented Reality, built using web technology.\n\nARToolKit moves over to Flash, opening AR to the 1.6 billion web users, developers, also providing mature development tools.\n\nIn 2011, Blippar creates compelling Augmented Reality experiences.\n\nIn 2011, the first smart glasses were created by Google.\n\nIn 2014, Google Tango was designed for a standalone mobile platforms.\n\nIn 2014, DAQRIâs smart helmet is a novel stereoscopic wearable device to see the real world overlaid with computer.\n\nIn 2014, Meta One starts to ship, the first high quality AR headset. Although plans are for a standalone version, the developer kit device is still tethered. With Steve Mann advising the company, and Jayse Hansen, the designer behind Iron Manâs holographic interfaces, guiding the company to develop natural user interaction that shall become industry standard for future developments.\n\nIn 2015, Vuforia is released by Qualcomm, an Augmented Reality software development kit (SDK) for mobile devices.\n\nIn 2015, Microsoft HoloLens was released. It is the first headset Augmented reality equipment with a self-contained Window 10 computer and depth mapping, a breakthrough in smart glasses technology.\n\nIn 2016, the Magic Leap One is unveiled, a competitor to the Hololens.\n\nThe Magic Leap One AR glasses were released by Magic Leap on 8 August 2018. The delivery was restricted to the US. The glasses are relatively lightweight, achieved by a separate battery unit connected to the glasses by a wire. An original wireless 6DoF controller is included for comfortable navigation and interaction.\n\nLumin OS is a custom operating system with a Linux-based kernel designed for spatial computing and Magic Leap One. Lumin SDK supports Unity. Magic Leap XR Plugin provides rendering and spatial mapping support for Magic Leap.\n\nIn 2016, the AWE media platform is released as the first and only web-based immersive VR and AR.\n\nAWE media website\n\nIn 2017, Appleâs ARKit is launched, the Augmented Reality platform for IOS devices.\n\nIn 2017, Chinese companies such as Baidu and Tencent, unveil DuMiX AR and Tencent TBS AR for creating their own software development kit.\n\nIn 2017, ARCore was released by Google. It is a platform to build Augmented Reality experiences for Android devices.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft Hololens 2 starts shipping.\n\nTimeline"
