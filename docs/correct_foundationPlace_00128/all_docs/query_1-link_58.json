        "text": "Hi everyone, hope you’re all doing well.\n\nI have a Nokia G21 and I dislike the stock Android 11 experience that it comes with. I’m looking to use /e/ OS to customize it to my liking and need someone to point me in the right direction. I have no data on the phone other than it being signed in to my Google account, it’s not syncing any data from other devices. I have some requirements that need to be fulfilled, else I won’t be able to use /e/ OS because of my work and other needs.\n\nBackup the current Android version so that I can switch back to it when needed.\n\nSBI YONO banking app to function.\n\nDual/Clone Apps feature where there can be two WhatsApp instances running simultaneously but with different phone numbers.\n\nPhone product page → https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_gb/nokia-g-21/specs?sku=719901183501\n\nAs I don’t have any data on the phone, I’m fine if I have to install Android 11 freshly, but I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH BACK if it doesn’t work out.\n\nFor the banking app support and the dual/clone app feature, if it doesn’t exist yet, please provide a link where I can request for those. I’m okay if I have to wait for a while for those two.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen in the documents, it looks like Android 11 might not be supported for flashing /e/ OS in the device. But I’ve never flashed any custom ROMs in any phones, so I might be wrong. However, if I’m not wrong, please provide a link where I request for my device.\n\nThank you.\n\n@tukykarmakar This phone was just released this year. Most of the time it takes developers around a year or so to make a custom ROM for devices as it takes a lot of time. So if you want to keep your phone, then you will have to be patient. You can also trade in your phone for another which is listed already supported by /e/OS, to include the easy installer, or just buy a phone right from /e/.\n\nEasy Installer for Beginners…\n\nhttps://doc.e.foundation/easy-installer\n\nFind a supported Device\n\nhttps://doc.e.foundation/devices\n\nShop for Phones\n\nNokia G21 development\n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/t/nokia-g21-development.4424031/\n\nHello, thanks for the reply.\n\nI have no problem in waiting. I needed a new phone which had Android 9 or above just because my banking app decided not to support Android 7 any more. Otherwise, my old phone is still going strong.\n\nI was in fact interested in buying Fairphone and Framework laptops for personal use, but they are not available in my country India. Buying from sites like eBay is not a good option because of price markups and scams.\n\nSeriously though, they are missing out on a huge market. India is huge on repairing electronics as it’s more affordable, especially for students. Maybe take a page out of Chromebooks and reach out to schools and colleges? They don’t need the highest of the specifications, just something to get their work done. And when they experience the repairability, they will be drawn to it.\n\nI hope we can see these user-focused projects in India soon.\n\nI would totally have bought one of those phones, but one of my requirements was Android 9+ because of some of my important apps stopping support for 7 and 8. Maybe I can keep my Nokia with stock Android and see if my old phone can get /e/OS.\n\nMy old phone is an Oppo A83 and I would totally go ahead with flashing /e/OS on it, if I can find some concrete way to revert back to the current state the phone is in. Data is all backed up but I don’t wanna brick my phone."
