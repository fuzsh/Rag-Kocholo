        "text": "Have you ever wondered what the World will look like in 2050? In what ways has AI effected our lives? The now seen threats; how have they evolved? What about tech; how much does it dictate our daily lives? Regulation; what kind of things do we need it for? Cybersecurity jobs & roles; how have they changed since 2023? These were the topics the workshop participants were given at an event hosted by Accenture Security Finland together with Women4Cyber Finland on 14 June! ‚ÑπÔ∏èThe participants were divided into four groups, each given a topic of their own to discuss and dissect: 1. Future job/roles 2. AI 3. Threats 4. Regulation. During the breakdown session, it was interesting to hear how the participants saw life in 2050 and the effects to cybersecurity; jobs and roles consisted of e.g. Data Cleaners, cleaning up personal data from social media and other online services, as more and more people are keen on going private mode again. The workshop participants saw AI, robotics and machines needing more regulation to ensure being used in an ethical way and to avoid misuse. There were also concerns about where does all the data go, but also about the virtual, augmented and mixed realities such as the Metaverse -what things should we consider to be regulated in those realities? Weapons -do we need to reconsider them; is malware considered as a weapon? Threats in 2050 were seen to be evolved since 2023, accelerated by technology. The participants saw one thing still remaining as a potential attack vector: us humans. They also discussed about the possibility of the now used bionic arms in the prothesis industry used against people to disrupt its operation with targeted attacks. üí°The event was planned to be a low-threshold so that anyone, regardless of their experience level or background, could take part. The participants represented both, more and less experienced persons, as some were already working with cybersecurity, others being interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity. This supplied a balanced and diverse distribution between the participants, creating interesting perspectives on the discussion! Were you at the workshop? Did I miss to mention something?
