In the U.S., the big winners are Google and Apple.\n\nOpera releases data generated by its users each month. In November 2010, Opera notes that its Mini browser saw significant increases in unique users, pages viewed and data consumed. Some 80 million people used the Opera Mini browser in the month of November, viewing 44.6 billion pages. According to Opera, its server-side compression crunched down 6.3 petabytes of data.\n\nYear-over-year, Opera Mini’s page-view growth climbed 103.1%. The number of unique users swelled by 28.4%, with the average user viewing 422 web pages per month. The average user consumed 10MB of data, and the average web page was just 2Kb. Facebook was the king of the mobile internet hill in 2009, according to Opera, maker of the Opera Mini and Mobile browsers for handsets.\n\nThis year, Google regained the top spot worldwide. Globally, the top 10 web sites as ranked by Opera are: 1. Google; 2. Facebook; 3. Vkontakte.ru; 4. Youtube; 5. Odnoklassniki.ru; 6. Yandex.ru; 7. Yahoo; 8. My.opera; 9. Mail.ru; 10. Getjar. In the U.S., the top 10 web sites look more familiar; 1. Google; 2. Facebook; 3. Youtube; 4. Wikipedia; 5. Yahoo; 6. My.opera; 7. Accuweather; 8. ESPN.go; 9. NYtimes; and 10. Myspace.\n\nTurning to the handsets making use of Opera Mini, it’s no surprise to see that worldwide, the numbers favor Nokia. They are: 1. Nokia 5130 XpressMusic; 2. Nokia 2700c; 3. Nokia 6300; 4. Nokia 2690; 5. Apple iPhone; 6. Nokia 2330c; 7. Nokia 2730c; 8. Nokia N70; 9. Nokia C3; and 10. Nokia 5310 XpressMusic.\n\nNine out of the top 10 handsets using Opera Mini were made by Nokia. In the U.S, it is an entirely different picture. Handsets using Opera Mini in the U.S. are: 1. Apple iPhone; 2. LG VM265 Rumor2; 3. BlackBerry 8520 Curve; 4. BlackBerry 9700 Bold; 5. LG VM510 Rumor Touch; 6. BlackBerry 8330 Curve; 7. Samsung SPH-M810 Instinct S30; 8. BlackBerry 9630 Tour; 9. BlackBerry 8530 Curve; and 10. BlackBerry 9000 Bold.\n\nWhat’s surprising is that not a single Android handset lands in the top 10 when it comes to Opera Mini users in the U.S. Is that because Opera Mobile (Opera’s full-featured browser) is also available to the Android platform? Or is it because the stock Android browser is good enough for most people? Opera doesn’t speculate.\n\n“We believe people with access to information lead more social, more informed and more empowered lives,” said Jon von Tetzchner, Co-founder, Opera Software. “Growth in mobile browsing means the Web is pushing beyond its traditional borders. If the first era of the Web was about expanding the capability and content of the Web, the second age is clearly about access.\n\nIn Opera we believe that access to the Web is a universal right.”\n\nTHE AMOS ADAMU SCANDAL: BETWEEN NIGERIA AND FIFA\n\n“Will it help you make your decision in favour of America in some way?” asked one of the under-cover journalists.\n\n“Obviously,” Amos Adamu replied. “Of course, it will have an effect. Because certainly if you are to invest in that, that means you also want the vote. You know one has to be very discreet about these things.”\n\nAgainst the backdrop of that seemingly innocuous conversation (recorded on tape and in video), the infamous Amos Adamu finally did his image in. As one of FIFA’s most senior figures, he has become the first official from the soccer body ever to be banned for bribery after six officials were punished following a corruption scandal, in November this year. And that has earned him a three-year ban and 10,000 Swiss franc (£6,341) fine from FIFA’s ethics committee after being found guilty of falling foul of bribery rules. His fellow executive committee member Reynald Temarii was suspended for a year and fined 5,000 Swiss francs (£3,170) for breaking rules on loyalty and confidentiality.\n\nThe bans follow a Sunday Times expose which claimed the officials had asked for cash in return for World Cup votes. Neither man will be able to take part in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes on 2 December – only 22 executive members will now take those decisions. Four other Fifa officials, all former executive committee members, have also received bans of between two and four years. The other officials sanctioned were Ismael Bhamjee of Botswana, who was handed a four-year ban, Amadou Diakite of Mali and Ahongalu Fusimalohi of Tonga who were suspended for three years and Tunisian official Slim Aloulou for two. All four were also fined 10,000 Swiss francs.\n\nAdamu is believed to have fooled most Nigerians most of the times; with every scheme of his taking him to a higher position. Neither ICPC nor EFCC could gain mastery over him. Even the late President Yar’Adua tried with his executive fiat, which too was not potent.\n\nHe was Director-General of the Nigerian National Sports Commission for 10 years. Prior to his appointment as Director-General, Adamu was the Director of Sports of the ministry for 10 years.\n\nDespite the enviable positions he occupied at various times, one constant feature in his career, as observers alleged, is the penchant for incorporated corruption. “I have been warning Nigerians to be wary of Amos Adamu. He has been controlling a group of mafias in our sports since 1994. He has done so much damage to our sports. Adamu got into FIFA through the backdoor,” stated Martin Osaile, a sports administrator.\n\nIn December 2000, Amos Adamu was named president of the Organising Committee for the 8th All-Africa Games, COJA. The games were held in October 2003, in the newly constructed Abuja Stadium. At the end of the games, Adamu and some other personalities, including former president Obasanjo’s kin, were fingered in some dirty financial episode.\n\nAmos Adamu. After that name what usually follows is corruption. Until the FIFA straw that broke his camel’s back, the former director-general of the Nigerian National Sports Commission, NSC, was an Executive Committee member of the Federation of International Football Association, FIFA. Not a few have described him as the chief bane of Nigeria’s sports development.\n\nAccording to Adetokunbo Adejumo, a social and political commentator, “When he organised All African Games, COJA in 2003, the aftermath was littered with corruption and mismanagement. It was this massive evidence of corruption that made Obasanjo, never a great sports fan himself, decide to back out of Nigeria’s bid to host the first ever Soccer World Cup in Africa, and resulted in South Africa getting that honour. Obasanjo also quickly foresaw that the evidence of corruption will also implicate some members of his family. The EFCC, then under Nuhu Ribadu, wanted to pick him up, but there was so much pressure from high up, that he had to back down. The reason is that if Dr Adamu was ever picked up, he would start singing and the songs will not be melodious to the ears of some very top politicians and officials who had been compromised in the award of bogus or highly inflated contracts for the Games. They therefore had to use a lot of muscle on Ribadu to drop the investigations.”\n\nBut, he’s the kind of man who fights to the finish. Usually, corrupt men in Nigeria like to fight to the finish –at least, till they cannot bear the shame and public opprobrium any longer. Then, they sneak into the gutter that produced them. Amos Adamu might be no exception. He had announced he will appeal against his three-year suspension from football, insisting he is “completely innocent” of the charges levelled against him over a cash-for-vote scandal reported by a British newspaper.\n\n“I’m profoundly disappointed by the findings of the ethics committee. I’m completely innocent of these allegations and I will appeal with immediate effect,” Adamu promised.\n\nAdamu got a stiffer punishment than Temarii because in the audio and video footages made public by the Sunday Times of London, he specifically demanded that funds for football projects in Nigeria be transferred through a personal bank account. Adamu’s four-year tenure on the FIFA executive committee was due to end next year.\n\nAdamu, who is also the president of the sub-regional West African Football Union (WAFU), was at a time widely tipped to succeed Issa Hayattou as president of the Confederation of African Football, CAF.\n\nWord Definition\n\naerophilately collecting of air-mail stamps\n\nailurophilia love of cats\n\nammophilous sand-loving;

From aerophilately – a pastime practiced by few – to zoophily – a pastime hopefully practiced by few, but unfortunately not – if you’re a logophile, you’ll love this list. Incidentally, since “zoophily” is regularly one of the Phrontistery’s top keywords.\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nFirst-week…, “It’s 5 o’clock,dear!” My mom announced. She switched on the light in my room and left. “Oh,no!” I muttered, rolling off the bed. “omo wase, omo rise!” Ayo, my younger sister sang from her room opposite mine. “Wait till I get my first salary…” I replied. In no time, I was in the bathroom. From the bathroom to the gents. Back in my room. What do I wear? Black suit, white shirt- I learnt is formal. It took me ages to get dressed. “Let’s say a prayer before you go”, dad said. Everyone was excited: Junior is starting is first job….As I stepped out, all the confidence in the universe deserted me. Anxiety suddenly became my companion.\n\nSoon I was lost in the throng of some faceless majority- hustling and bustling. And I hated Lagos again for the uncountableth(sic) time. “Mr. Ben Tiwa,jnr?” Yes, no other birds are the hawk- I nodded in the affirmative.”Please, come with me”, the well-structured feminine figure said. Without querying her, I followed like a lamb being led to the slaughter. Who wouldn’t? “Welcome to First Foundation…”, a sonorous voice announced after taking me on a guided tour of the organization’s facility. “Thank you. It’s a pretty place,” I said. “The faces I saw are lovely too!” “Come see your office…” the voice requested. Really, am getting used to the voice like a kindred spirit. From the 5th floor, we soon arrived on the 1st floor- my domain. “So have a nice day ahead!” she said and shut the door.\n\nI was now alone- with question and exclamation marks hanging over my head-in my first office ever…Suddenly, I began sweating profusely in the air-conditioned office- instead of shivering. Has work already started? This is just the firs day-can’t they see? I pondered sheepishly. Soon I was placed on attachment to get acquainted with the organization’s six companies. It was an inspiring exploration…First-Week faded out.\n\nSECOND-WEEK…Sunday. My folks were calling me on the phone from everywhere:”Junior, congrats. You have done it again!” “Ah Jay-I thank God for you o!” “ol’ boy, you are always the man- just believe…gbabe!” The calls came in different shapes; from the sublime to the ridiculous. “Don’t you think our friendship shoild blossom this season”, Aisha suggested. “My man,better get down with one slim-shady or is it slim-lady!”Said Titi. “Ah Jay, this is the time to enjoy what you sorely missed on campus and in camp. Am sure you’ve got pretty birds in there-your office men!” Jide advised.\n\nOops! Where did these crazy folks drop from? I was still wondering when another voice popped up from phone: “Congrats! Big boy. Jay, don’t forget to send me MTN #3000 recharge card. And here’s my bank account …sweet day!” What on earth is happening? Monday. I got to office with more confidence than anxiety. Last week during my attachment I learnt about some high-sounding words like: fluoroscopy, angiography, accuson sequoia, sonoline g-20 and the list was endless.\n\nIt was a moment of learning new things. Tuesday- Saturday. I was still learning the nitty-gritty of my employer’s awesome organization. All the employees are understanding,friendly,patient and hardworking. The smiles on their faces reassured me that: I can…Now I felt a gusto of ease surrounding me. When Duke, my good pal visited my workplace- First Foundation Place-, he was overwhelmed by what he saw. Wow!(apologies to Ngozi), it is a delightful aesthetics’ masterpiece.\n\n“Junior, I love this place!” Duke said.” You are pretty fortunate. First job- First Foundation!” He paused for what seemed like eternity and asked:”Can I stay here forever!?” I looked at him in surprise; he sure knew he could not. How I wish he could! I thanked him for coming. Or what can I do without you well-wishers out there- praying, fasting and fantasizing on my behalf? “But,” he said as he was leaving, “don’t forget your guys o!” What a Parthian shot….\n\nTHIRD-WEEK…Home-front has begun to fade out. More time now spent in the office. I was privileged to be drafted into the organization’s editorial board. There were articles to write and submit. I tried hard- very very hard to put pen to paper. Nothing surfaced. I scratched my big contorted fragile head the very way a fowl would scratch a clean concrete floor for bits to peck- how futile! O is this my first fumble for First Foundation? I hope sey I no go lose my job for this.\n\nI began to say a silent prayer: Holy Father, begotten Son, take this cup from me- I no fit drink wetin dey inside!” “ Wetin dey inside-olodo”, a voice boomed. “ No be mass comm you read?drink am- and be ready for more.” I began to whine: unholy Satan, why hath thou cometh here to look for me- dem send you? Get thee behind me, now now. It was a tough moment. My entire internal system was in a feverish disarray. I had to go unwind in the gents. How I wish Ab was around. Oh why! Why has everyone forsaken me? Thursday-Saturday. I began facing reality- the present reality-more than ever before. I was getting involved fully…how inspiring to work with loving hardworking employees. Yahoo!… “Hello?” I picked up my phone saying. “Bawo wo ni dear? Asked the voice at the other end.”Who’s speaking please?” “Phoebe lo nsoro…” “Phoebe?” “Why are you sounding like Thomas,” she retorted. “ I just want to tell you…it has happened o!” “What?” “Ti e serious fun one minute jo…am pregnant for you!” she gleefully announced. “Wrong number!” I ended the call. Imagine, how could I impregnate someone I have never met before- my brother, tell me.\n\nFOURTH-WEEK… Oh la la…Pay-day approaches! The first day dragged on like one over-bloated dragon breathing smoke instead of fire. Yet, it sure dragged over-am became yesterday. Day-two was tough and tempting…Third-day was ok. Pay-day appeared very much on the horizon. I was in total ecstasy, body and soul. Then my cell phone rang… “Y’hellooo!” I responded. “Hey, smart guy…”, the voice began. “Who you?” I asked. “It’s Phoebe. Am coming down to your office tomorrow!” First, I was enraged. Then confused…what adjectives could I use? My vocab failed me. I had flung my cell phone-o mercy! It landed safely in a bin. “It wasn’t me. It wasn’t me. Phoebe-it wasn’t me!” I said sobbing. And tomorrow arrived…. Phoebe would soon arrive. I was stone confused. But, who is this pest pestering my life? God knew I did not know… 6p.m., ready to go home. Phoebe never showed up. Indeed, she called the wrong number.\n\nBack home. “ Hey, kaabo-bawo ni office?” “Where’s the bullion van that brought you home?” “Is it Ghana-must-go-bag that you used?” “Pleasssse, can everyone just relax-what’s happening?” “Wey ya salary?” my little nephew finally asked. Salary? Could you believe-I forgot to collect my first salary ever in life! A month has just ended…but, the future lies ahead….\n\nSocial and Economic Rights Action Center\n\nMay 11, 2010\n\nThe Illegal Demolition of Makoko Community\n\nThe Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) is deeply concerned about the recent acts of lawlessness, indiscipline and brutality perpetrated by officials of the Kick Against Indiscipline (KAI) Brigade. Between Monday April 19 and 22, 2010, officials of the KAI Brigade assisted by heavily armed policemen invaded a section of the Makoko community, in the Yaba Local Government Area of Lagos and forcibly evicted the residents by destroying their homes, properties and livelihoods. As a result of this action, over one thousand people, including women, children and the elderly were rendered homeless and pushed deeper into chronic poverty. This action was carried out without adequate notice, consultation, compensation or the provision of alternative accommodation in violation of the rule of law and the fundamental rights of the affected residents.\n\nThe residents have lived on the land in question since 1962. The forbears of many of the residents acquired fee simple legal interest on the land through some of the ancestral land owing families. It is also important to mention that the question as to the ownership of the underlying land has been and remains a subject matter of a pending lawsuit Madam Ayinke Ajayi V. Mesu Moses (No. LD/3010/97.) Until the communmity’s demolition by the KAI Brigade, a large and prominent sign board publishing the case stood in the center of the community. The demolition carried out by the KAI Brigade constitutes a brazen disrespect of the judicial process and contemptuous of a subsisting order of injunction of the Lagos High Court made on November 3, 1998 restraining all parties “from going or doing anything whatsoever on the land, including passing of any interest on the land…”\n\nOur investigations reveal that the KAI Brigade acted without lawful authority. Officials of the Brigade informed SERAC that they carried out the demolition in order to rid the community of miscreants and criminals. Since the demolition, one Captain Paul Rheas (Rtd.), claiming to be a representative of one of the families (Delfino Miranda Eleiye family) contesting the title to the land in question has openly used the KAI Brigade and armed soldiers to terrorize, intimidate and harass the residents in his bid to commence the fencing of the land in question. On May 3, 2010, 6 soldiers that accompanied Captain Paul Rheas shot sporadically into the air causing panic and stampede in the community and adjoining neighborhoods.\n\nThe active connivance of the KAI Brigade, an agency of the Lagos State Government with private actors to undermine the rule of law and violate the human rights of Makoko residents is unacceptable in a democracy. This is a dangerous precedent that private individuals that have scores to settle can simply hire KAI Brigade to perpetrate illegality, fraud and hope to hide under the cloak of officialdom.\n\nMakoko is one of nine host communities of the Lagos Metropolitan and Governance Project (LMDGP), a 200 Million US Dollars World Bank-funded project. Under the terms of agreement between the Lagos state government and the World Bank as well as the Operating Guidelines of the World Bank, demolitions within the project’s host communities must be carried out strictly in accordance with the Bank’s operating policies and guidelines that stipulate safeguards standards. The Bank’s Operational Guidelines obliges the Lagos State government (LASG) to ensure that proper and reasonable notice, genuine and effective consultation, fair hearing, institutional responsibility, community participation, replacement cost for loss of asset or income, financial assistance to aid relocation are observed and respected. Acts such as perpetrated by the KAI Brigade can undermine the implementation of the LMDGP with far reaching consequences.\n\nWe would like to use this opportunity to call on His Excellency, Governor Raji Fashola to call the KAI Brigade to order, and cause a full investigation to be carried out to establish the circumstances of the demolition of Makoko and to bring erring officials to justice.\n\nSigned:\n\nFelix C. Morka\n\nExecutive Director\n\nSocial and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC)\n\nWHERE IS THE WORLD GOING NEXT?\n\nDR. ADEBOWALE: OUT OF HIS MIND?\n\n“Very soon the world will know about Adeyipo Village.”\n\nThat was the optimistic and futuristic utterance of Dr. Bayo Adebowale, former Deputy Rector of The Polytechnic, Ibadan. Why not The Polytechnic, Ibadan? Why Adeyipo Village – a seemingly insignificant rural community, existing in near-obscurity on the terrestrial terrain? A village some kilometres away from Ibadan, capital of Oyo state with the road connecting it to the city demanding much resilience from visitors in its rough surface?\n\nEvery dawn, a throng of local farmers at Iyana-Irefin in Ibadan board buses going to Adeyipo through Kupe, Idi-Igba, Idi-Ogun and Akobo; the landscape presents a commune of rural centres where farming dominates daily activities. The only diversion is the one created by Dr. Adebowale. Why? Adeyipo houses the first rural community-based African studies research library. And its director and founder is Dr. Bayo Adebowale.\n\nThe African Heritage Research Library located in a typical African village is gradually expanding to become the most profound centre of information on Africa and its people. The library prides itself in three existing large halls lined with over 10,000 books and other materials. It is apparently a centre committed to research works on the African continent and the blacks in the Diaspora; it stocks material on subjects as diverse as arts, history, law, government and politics.\n\nThe research library is a product of flurry of efforts spanning a decade plus four years. According to The News Magazine “Adebowale was then a lecturer at the former Oyo State College of Education, Ila-Orangun, Osun state. One fateful day in 1988, he sat before his desk, going through an academic journal. A particular article fascinated him. In the write-up, a foreign writer made a lot disparaging remarks on Africa and Africans.”\n\nHe portrayed Africa as a continent on an endless rat race. The conclusion was most alarming. The writer insisted that most African countries were not yet ripe for independence. Adebowale saw many contradictions in the article. He, on his own, concluded that the writer must have been a victim of sincere ignorance. But Adebowale was not going to cast aspersion on the article and its author. He realised that the most appropriate solution to the problem of the writer and many others in similar shoes is enlightenment.\n\nThere and then, a project was conceived towards proper education on Africa, its history and ways of life of the inhabitants in its book acquisition policy, albeit its special interest is in African studies. It stocks books by writers from all over the world and exposes its researchers to all views leaving them to draw an informal conclusion. Music – being the soul of life – receives adequate attention; the library is a well-stocked store of materials on living and dead music legends. A section of the library has pictures and audio-tapes of jazz music greats of African origin; the musical audio-tapes are being assembled to teach the history of Africa. The centre has a demonstration farm to inculcate in local farmers alternative technique in crop cultivation and control of pests.\n\nThe library has a Board of Advisors constituted by eminent scholars from Nigeria and abroad which include Professors Niyi Osundare, Akinwunmi Ishola, Femi Osofisan, Sam Asein, Elechi Amadi and Goke Adeniji from Nigeria. Foreigners on the board include Ngugi Wa Thiong O of Kenya, Oliver B. Johnson and a host of other African American intellectuals.\n\nAdebowale, the celebrated author of The Virgin, Out of His Mind and Lonely Days, himself is a veteran in the field of research. Presently, he spends 70 per cent of his earning on the research library and his dream is that everyone will come to Adeyipo to drink from the “fountain” of authentic African research centre situated in the heart of the continent.\n\nDefinitely, Dr. Bayo Adebowale is not Out of His Mind; definitely, no more Lonely Days studying Africa and Africans outside Africa. Why? Africa Heritage Research Library is The Virgin the whole world will chase, praise and embrace!"
