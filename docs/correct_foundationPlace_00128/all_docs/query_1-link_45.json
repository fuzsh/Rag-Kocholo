        "text": "Symbian foundation platform was available to its members. As it was a non-profit organization, it was available to its members under a royalty-free license. Symbian foundation made sure to provide the best to its members by managing and unifying the platform wholeheartedly.\n\nInitially, the Symbian Foundation was not an open-source platform. But it committed to moving its software to an open-source platform within a span of two years. This was achieved with the use of the Eclipse public license. After that, this platform was made free to use by all, not only in terms of cost but also in terms of making changes. This was done to promote great innovation on board. Also, it was believed that a broader community would initiate better future developments in years to come. The developers were allowed to fix the bugs, adapt the software to their needs, and improve its functions.\n\nThe platform was made available for free to develop for programmers and web designers, service providers, and other enthusiasts. The development of the Symbian Foundation was not restricted to its members. The Symbian Foundation developer program made it easy to access it for development. It provided single point developer support i.e. provided a wide range of tools and equipment for development to its developers."
