        "text": "As the Murphy administration starts work on the proposed new state budget, officials will consider the latest look at New Jersey’s state revenues. We now have a report on January’s revenue collections from the State Treasury, and the picture looks strong. For the fiscal year overall, total revenue collections are up more than $4 billion, or nearly 22% above the same seven months in the last fiscal year. There was an increase in tax collections in all the major categories — income tax, sales tax and corporate business tax. The January report reflects activity in December so those numbers reflect the holiday shopping season.\n\nA New Jersey company has received a $2 million grant from the federal government to support research on energy efficiency. The funding went to Nokia Bell Labs, which is developing thermal energy architecture that will reduce data server cooling energy as well as deliver both heating and cooling to buildings. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was in New Jersey Monday and toured Nokia Bell Labs with U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-7th) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), who said if we want to stay competitive, clean-energy investment is a must.\n\nA Jersey City-based cryptocurrency financial services company will pay $100 million in a settlement with New Jersey and federal securities regulators. The New Jersey attorney general’s office says the settlement with BlockFi Lending is connected to the company’s offers and sales of unregistered securities. Acting Attorney General Matt Platkin said cryptocurrency-related investments may offer investors something new but they must still follow the rules. BlockFi did not admit to or deny the findings of regulators."
