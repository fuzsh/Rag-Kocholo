        "text": "GIVING BACK TO MOVE OUR COMMUNITY FORWARD\n\nScott and Evelyn (Sis) Names had more than a fondness for sports. They had a passion. Athletics and physical education played a central role in their lives and in the lives of their children. If the Namesâ family was ever not outside playing sports, you could be sure of one thing: they were inside watching sports.\n\nTODAYâ¦\n\ntheir passion for sports extends not only to the Namesâ family 4th and 5th generations, but to every resident across Pierce County. All of us get to enjoy the facilities and complexes whose existence can be traced back to the selflessness of Scott and Sis.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY,\n\nthe Names Family Foundation extends the passion of Scott and Sis by providing grants for non-profits that promote health, wellness and sports. If youâre an advocate for physical education and believe in leading with your heart, contact us today about a grant for your organization."
