        "text": "Background\n\nBuilding the next generation design system to empower designers at Nokia, a leader in building critical networks around the world\n\nNokia is a telecommunications company that builds vital mobile, fixed, and cloud networks around the world. Between May 2022 and April 2023, I interned as a UXÂ Designer under the Cloud and Network Services (CNS)Â business group. CNSÂ deals with 5G, core, IoT, and cloud solution deployment to help companies embrace disruption and develop new business models.\n\nI worked in the design system team, developing and maintaining Nokia's design system, FreeForm UX. FreeForm helps to drive and deliver unified solutions across three different libraries with fully themed, tokenized, and accessible components. FreeFormÂ is part of a larger initiative called Common Software Foundation (CSF), which aims to bring CNS applications together into a coherent software suite through modular and scalable software infrastructure.\n\nSimilar to many global design systems, FreeFormÂ strives to encourage the usage and consumption of its modular library across software teams as it reduces the cost of service and care for the company. However, scaling isn't as simple as it looks with an application suite and workforce as diverse and global as Nokia's. Therefore, we needed to think about how we might further encourage application teams to champion FreeForm as their source of truth. With a company rebrand in the works (launched February 2023), there was an opportunity for theÂ team to evolve the design system in order to help application teams reinforce and scale Nokia's core competencies as a B2B technology innovation leader. As a result, we looked closely at what our design system had and who it engaged, and pondered about how we might evolve its delivery and capabilities in order continue empowering designers at the company.\n\nGoal\n\nBuild the next generation of FreeForm UX\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nAdoption of FreeForm UX reduces cost of service and care for teams\n\nChallenge\n\nHow might we make it simpler for FreeForm UX to grow at scale and complexity with the company?\n\nOne way to approach this is by providing designers and developers with the right tools and information to build great experiences in their respective teams around the globe. This is where the majority of my efforts had been focused on during my time at Nokia.\n\nobjective\n\nProvide designers and developers with the right tools and information to build great experiences\n\nIn order to achieve this, our team focused our contribution in three main areas: the creation of new ways to consume FreeForm, the gradual improvement of what already exists, and the maintenance of elements that work well for our organization. Some of the tasks that were prioritized during my time here included; accessibility compliance, exploring new tools and processes, identifying and documenting common patterns, and expanding the capability of our components. We believed that making actionable progress in these three areas would act as a staging area for the next iteration of Nokia's design system and at the same time, increase FreeForm's adoption and allow it to scale to the company's complex and changing needs.\n\nsolution\n\nCreating new ways to consume and scale FreeForm\n\nTools are a vital medium for designers to get their work done. Part of my work included exploring and evaluating new tools to improve how FreeForm is consumed and scaled within application teams. I worked on three main projects in this domain: Evaluating a potential migration from Sketch to Figma, exploring how plugins could provide useful information to designers when prototyping, and testing new content management systems (CMS) for our design system.\n\nA potential migration to Figma would have a significant impact to how FreeForm is consumed and the tools designers would need to use the design system. We formed a team consisting of stakeholders from application and UXÂ teams to investigate the potential benefits, drawbacks, and obstacles we would face in moving over to Figma. I worked on researching and testing different configurations for a potential design system in Figma as well as finding out how feasible it was to migrate our current design system into Figma. To summarize, our overall findings were in favour of moving to Figma. The process of migration is currently ongoing. Unfortunately, I cannot speak about the other projects as they are currently ongoing.\n\nUpdate\n\nApril 2023: Parallel to Nokia's rebrand in February 2023, we migrated the bulk of our design operations from Sketch to Figma. As a result, we had the opportunity to rebuild our design libraries from the ground-up and implement new features. To ensure this effort was successful, our team needed a coherent direction to work towards. This is where I stepped up and led 10 designers to create a minimum viable offering of the design libraries we had available.\n\nAs this was a time of significant change, it was important for our team to lean towards playing the role of the educator â frequently holding 1-on-1s and team-wide tutorials to help ease designers into the new environment and tools they had available to continue solving meaningful problems. This also led to me hosting tutorials for 30 designers and creating videos for many more to reference in the future.\n\nIn addition to exploring new ways of working, I worked with application designers to compile and create new pattern documentation to address recurring and common design problems. This consisted of identifying how solutions for these problems were implemented in the real world, conversing with designers on what factors they considered when creating such solutions, researching what patterns other companies use to solve the same problem, and making refinements to documentation based on feedback from designers. The objective of creating more pattern documentation wasn't to limit designers in what they could do, but rather show them how they could address common design problems as scale and complexity were introduced.\n\nprocess\n\nCommunication helps build great solutions\n\nWhile I can't share the specifics of our processes, throughout my time here, communication has been a key factor in helping FreeFrom evolve. From consulting stakeholders during research phases, to working with developers to implement solutions based on detailed guidelines, communication kept everyone in sync with what they needed to do and what to expect from others.\n\nI frequently communicated with managers, designers, developers, and other stakeholders when solving problems. I used tools such as JIRA to stay aligned with the rest of the product team, Abstract to gather feedback from designers, Microsoft Teams to sync with stakeholders, and good old PowerPoint to create and present insightful presentations to decision makers. My primary goal when communicating with stakeholders was to understand their goals, needs, and pain points. This gave me an idea of what shape or direction my work should take. For every task I set out to tackle, I always considered the bigger picture â how did it fit into helping the design system reach its goals? Was there an opportunity to provide more value if I expanded the scope of the task? What challenges might teams face if the solution was applied to complex problems? I believe asking questions in this manner helped guide my work to provide long-term value to the design system. Overall, frequently communicating with our stakeholders meant that I was creating solutions based on clear requirements that would be useful to them when using the design system to solve ambiguous and complex problems.\n\nresults\n\nA design system set out to scale seamlessly for the complex problems of tomorrow\n\nFocusing our efforts into three main areas helped move us closer to our goal of building the next generation of FreeForm. By making sure teams have the right tools and information available to consume the design system, the barrier to adoption is much lower than it was before. FreeForm continues to evolve and is better positioned than ever to solve the complex problems that arise as the company grows. The growing maturity of FreeForm benefits over 270 stakeholders spread across five locations globally, who use and consume the design system daily to achieve their goals.\n\nMy work included a mix of immediate and long-term impact. Solutions such as new pattern documentation or new component features had an immediate impact as they are being used to solve the problems of today. On the other hand, work such as a new CMS or migrating to Figma in the months to come will have a long-term impact as it will shape the way that stakeholders use and consume the design system. As this work is internal, I cannot share specific measures of my impact, but we have observed positive results from our combined efforts to evolve our design system.\n\nThis work is not yet public\n\nUnfortunately, I can't share more details publicly as these initiatives are still in progress and have yet to be made public. I look forward in sharing more details on my website when it does. In the meantime, feel free to contact me at suhailjaffer3@gmail.com for more information."
