Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC) is the premier place for out-of-school time professionals to learn, receive resources, and engage with peers and experts. In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Education, the primary goal of the 21st CCLC NTAC is to build the capacity of OST professionals.\n\nThe 21st CCLC NTAC website provides free professional learning resources including e-learning courses, toolkits, an external resource library, and so much more!\n\nThe Campaign for Grade-Level Reading is a collaborative effort by foundations, nonprofit partners, states, and communities across the nation to ensure that more children in low-income families succeed in school and graduate prepared for college, a career, and active citizenship.\n\nThe Campaign focuses on an important predictor of school success and high school graduation: grade-level reading by the end of third grade. Research shows that proficiency in reading by the end of third grade enables students to shift from learning to read to reading to learn, and to master the more complex subject matter they encounter in the fourth grade curriculum.\n\nThe Cox Campus offers free, interactive courses and resources based on proven language and literacy practices to transform children’s learning environments. Educators and families are facing unique challenges during this time.\n\nThe Cox Campus is your go-to place for free professional development, teaching resources, and more.\n\nAfterschool programs keep kids safe, inspire them to learn, and help working families. For every child in a program, two are waiting to get in. The Afterschool Alliance is working to change that."
