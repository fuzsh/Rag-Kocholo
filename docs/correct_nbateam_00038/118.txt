Los Angeles Lakers centre Kwame Brown underwent right shoulder surgery on Wednesday, but should be ready for October training camp.

Brown, 25, had a bursa sac, bone spur and scar tissue removed during an hour-long procedure performed by Dr. Neal El Attracheat the Kerlan Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles.

The shoulder should be fully healed in eight weeks.

Brown had reconstructive surgery performed on his left ankle by Dr. David Porter of Indianapolis on May 29, a procedure which takes up to four months to fully recover from.

Brown initially sprained the ankle last Dec. 31, when he landed awkwardly on Andre Miller's foot in a 104-94 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.

Brown was sidelined the next 27 games and returned briefly, only to sit out seven more games with ankle pain.

He returned for the final two games of the regular season and played well in the playoffs, averaging 8.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 26.6 minutes as Los Angeles fell in five games to the Phoenix Suns in the opening round.

Brown averaged 8.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.2 blocked shots and 27.6 minutes in 41 games, including 28 starts, as the Lakers finished 42-40 last season.

He will be make $9.1 million US next season.

Brown has averaged 7.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 24.1 minutes in 366 appearances (171 starts) since being drafted first overall out of high school by the Washington Wizards in 2001.

The Lakers acquired him and Laron Profit for Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins on Aug. 2, 2005.
