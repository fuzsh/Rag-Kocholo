        "text": "The NBA instituted two revolutionary rule changes shortly after the end of the 1953-54 season. The 24-second shot clock was introduced, as was a limit of six team fouls per quarter (after which every foul would result in penalty free throws). The new rules accomplished two things: they helped quicken the pace of the action on the court, and they took away the tactical advantage of fouling a player who has possession of the ball late in a game.\n\nThe big question was what effect the new rules would have on the three-time defending NBA-champion Lakers, a team built around the size and power of George Mikan. But the question was never really answered, because Mikan retired before the 1954-55 season began and assumed the job of team general manager.\n\nWith Mikan gone, the center position fell to second-year player Clyde Lovellette, who contributed 18.7 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. But Lovellette was not the defensive force that Mikan had been, and the Lakers finished 40-32, second to the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western Division. Minneapolis survived the first round of the playoffs but fell to the Pistons in four games in the division finals. The beginning of the shot-clock era meant the end of the Lakers' dynasty.\n\nAge was also beginning to take its toll on Minneapolis. Jim Pollard retired before the 1955-56 season, ending an eight-year career with the Lakers that stretched back to the NBL days. Guard Slater Martin had a fine season, but he was 30 years old. The Lakers' youngest starter was the 26-year-old Lovellette, who had become the team's star, finishing fourth in the league in scoring (21.5 ppg) and third in rebounding (14.0 rpg).\n\nBy midseason the Lakers were struggling so badly that they prevailed upon Mikan to come out of retirement. It took him some time to get back into shape, but by the end of the season he had become a solid contributor, if not the star he had been a few years earlier. All told, Mikan appeared in 37 regular-season contests, averaging 10.5 points and 8.3 rebounds.\n\nSlater Martin finished among the NBA's top 10 in assists (6.2 apg) and free-throw percentage (.833), while seven-year veteran Vern Mikkelsen led the league in personal fouls for the second year in a row.\n\nThe Lakers fell under .500 for the first time in franchise history that season, finishing with a 33-39 record. Facing the St. Louis Hawks in the playoffs, Minneapolis dropped Game 1, 116-115, then walloped the Hawks by 58 points in Game 2. But St. Louis came back with a repeat of the opening game and won Game 3, 116-115, to take the series.\n\nIn 1956-57 Minneapolis managed to earn a tie for first place in the Western Division, but that said more about the division's weakness than about the Lakers' strength. Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Fort Wayne shared first place with identical losing records of 34-38. By contrast, the last-place team in the Eastern Division was 36-36.\n\nAfter a series of one-game playoffs, St. Louis earned the Western Division title and a bye in the first round of the 1957 NBA Playoffs. While the Hawks waited, the Lakers and the Pistons squared off in the division semifinals. Minneapolis prevailed with a two-game sweep. St. Louis then took out the Lakers in three straight, but the series was close for a sweep. The Hawks won Game 1 by a comfortable nine-point margin. Game 2 was a squeaker at 106-104. The final contest was a no-holds-barred marathon. The game lasted through a pair of overtime periods, and when it ended, St. Louis was the team still standing. The final score was Hawks 143, Lakers 135.\n\nThe franchise endured a disastrous season in 1957-58. George Mikan was persuaded to assume the head coaching duties, but he failed miserably and stepped aside after the club fell to 9-30. John Kundla moved back into the coaching spot after half a season in the front office, but there wasn't much he could do with the Lakers that year. The team finished with a 19-53 record and in last place in the Western Division.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nDuring the offseason the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team. Although Minneapolis fans had come out in droves to watch the Lakers when Mikan was with the club, attendance had fallen off dramatically in the ensuing five seasons. Even the presence of Elgin Baylor hadn't made much of a difference. Meanwhile, Major League Baseball's Dodgers had moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958 and had become a huge financial success. Lakers owner Bob Short, a shrewd young businessman from Minneapolis who had owned the franchise for two years, packed up the club and moved it to Los Angeles before the 1960-61 season.\n\nThat wasn't the only important change for the franchise during the offseason. The Lakers' 25-50 record the previous year had given the club the No. 2 pick in the NBA Draft. The prize was 6-21/2 guard Jerry West, a talented playmaker and scorer. West's former coach at West Virginia, Fred Schaus, was installed at the Lakers' helm.\n\nBaylor was a scoring machine and a terror on the boards for the new Los Angeles Lakers. He averaged 34.8 points and 19.8 rebounds in 1960-61. West struggled for the first half of the season before hitting his stride, finishing his first NBA campaign averaging 17.6 points. The two players combined to boost the Lakers to a 36-43 record and a second-place finish in the Western Division.\n\nThe Lakers faced the Pistons in the opening round of the playoffs. In an era of rampant scoring, the two teams lit up the scoreboard. Los Angeles posted 120 points in each of the first two games and won both. Back in Detroit, the Pistons won Game 3, 124-113, and Game 4, 123-114. The Lakers closed out the series with a 137-120 shoot-out in the final game.\n\nThat meant a Lakers-Hawks matchup in the Western Division Finals for the third year in a row. St. Louis had finished the regular season 15 games ahead of Los Angeles and was heavily favored, but the series was a dogfight. The Hawks managed a one-point victory in Game 4 to even the series at two games apiece. After the Lakers took Game 5, St. Louis eked out a 114-113 overtime win in Game 6 and a 105-103 victory in Game 7 to move on to the Finals.\n\nLos Angeles played with a slight handicap during the 1961-62 season. Elgin Baylor was one of only two NBA players called to active military duty in the wake of the Berlin crisis. (Lenny Wilkens was the other.) For much of the campaign Baylor was only available on weekends. Still, in 48 games he averaged 38.3 points. Meanwhile, West exploded for a 30.8 average in his second year.\n\nThe high-scoring duo was ably supported. The cast included 6-8 Rudy LaRusso, a third-year forward who chipped in 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game. Frank Selvy, a much-traveled veteran who had played with six teams in his first five seasons in the NBA before settling in with the Lakers, added 14.7 points per game at guard. A solid bench featured Rodney \"Hot Rod\" Hundley and Tom Hawkins.\n\nLos Angeles dominated the Western Division, topping second-place Cincinnati by 11 games. Up against Detroit in the division finals, the Lakers trounced the Pistons in the first three games of the series, lost Games 4 and 5, and then ousted Detroit in Game 6.\n\nThe NBA Finals pitted the Lakers against the Boston Celtics, and the series opened in Boston, where the teams split two games. The Lakers won Game 3 in Los Angeles, thanks to a last-second steal and a layup by Jerry West. The Celtics evened the series with a win in Game 4. Game 5, which was played in Boston, saw Baylor pour in 61 points to set a playoff record that stood for a quarter of a century. The teams headed to Los Angeles with the Lakers up three games to two and poised to clinch the championship on their home court. But the Celtics pushed the series to the limit with a 119-105 win.\n\nGame 7 ranks as one of the most exciting championship games of all time. The score was knotted at 100 apiece when Selvy put up a shot that slid off the rim as time expired. Had the shot fallen, the Lakers would have claimed the crown. Instead, the game moved into overtime, and the Celtics outscored the Lakers, 10-7, to win the game and the NBA Championship.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nAfter celebrating back-to-back-to-back NBA championships, there appeared to be no end to the Lakers impressive run of titles. And if a Robert Horry three-pointer from the wing in the final seconds of Game Five of the Western Conference Semifinals had gone in-and-out and back in again, perhaps the run might not have ended, at least this season. Opportunity, for the first time in three years, had passed the champions by.\n\nThe Lakers title defense ran into a number of obstacles abnormally early in the season. From Shaquille O'Neal missing the first 12 games due to off-season toe surgery to Mark Madsen straining a hamstring to Rick Fox being suspended for six games after a preseason fight, the new campaign began somewhat precariously for the three-time defending champs. Shorthanded throughout the first half of the season while players were out or just returning to form, Kobe Bryant carried the team early on. Bryant, who entered the season adding fifteen pounds of mass to his frame over the summer, became youngest player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career points. Night in and night out, Bryant seemingly rewrote the record books. He established a new NBA record with 12 three-pointers in a game, tied the NBA record for most three-point field goals in a half with eight 3/28 vs. Washington, established a new franchise record with 42 points in a half 3/28 vs. Washington and tallied an NBA season-high 55 points in the same game, recorded nine consecutive games scoring 40 or more points, the 4th longest streak of its kind in NBA history (Wilt Chamberlain - 14 twice, Chamberlain - 10, Michael Jordan - 9), recorded 13 consecutive games scoring 35 or more points, the fourth longest streak of its kind in NBA history with all three others belonging to Wilt Chamberlain, by averaging 40.6 points in the month of February, became only the third player in NBA history to average 40 or more points in a month and became the first Lakers player since Magic Johnson in 1991 to record triple-doubles in consecutive games. Named Western Conference Player of the Week five times while being named Western Conference Player of the Month for January, Bryant elevated his play in pursuit of a fourth straight championship.\n\nIf the team had developed one trademark after three championship runs, it was that of resiliency. Never more apparent was the Lakers never-say-die attitude than when the team came from 27 points down in the fourth quarter to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in a December 6 showdown at STAPLES Center. Yet following a Christmas day defeat that dropped the team to 11-19, the Lakers had never seemed more vulnerable. Robert Horry, however, boldly predicted the Lakers would rise above .500 before the All Star break. True to form, by February 6th, the last game before the break, Los Angeles was 24-23. The Lakers, in fact, posted a 39-13 record after Christmas, the second best record in the league.\n\nWhile Shaquille O'Neal had rejoined the team towards the end of November, it took time for him to reestablish his position as the most dominant force in the NBA. If January and February belonged to Bryant, March belonged to O'Neal. With the playoffs looming just around the corner and the team back in the hunt, O'Neal began to resemble the dominant force he had been in the previous season's NBA Finals when he garnered his third consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. He averaged 31.6 points, 11.0 rebounds and 2.88 blocks while leading the Lakers to an 11-5 mark in their toughest month of the season, earning Western Conference Player of the Month honors along the way. Although he missed the first 12 games of the season, O'Neal managed to remind the NBA that he was still its most imposing force in the middle. On the way to 2002-03 First Team All-NBA and All-NBA Defensive Second Team selections, O'Neal celebrated major career milestones such as recording his 9,000th career rebound 4/15 vs. Denver and recording his 20,000th career point 3/20 @ Sacramento. In addition, O'Neal made his 10th NBA All Star appearance while Bryant, who also was named First Team All-NBA and garnered an All-NBA Defensive First Team nod, started in the midseason classNameic for the fifth time.\n\nThe Lakers concluded their season with a 50-32 record, the team's 26th 50-plus win season since moving to Los Angeles. As a franchise, the Lakers improved to 2671-1648 (.618) all time, the most victories and best winning percentage in NBA history.\n\nAfter knocking off the Minnesota Timberwolves in a hard fought six game series and splitting the first four games of the Western Conference Semifinals with the Spurs, the Lakers hopes of a fourth straight championship hinged on a pivotal Game Five in San Antonio. Already missing one of their tri-captains in Rick Fox, who had torn a ligament in his left foot during the Minnesota series, and in a game in which San Antonio led by as many as 25 points, the Lakers poise and confidence once again emerged down the stretch. Down 18 in the final period, Los Angeles dug deep and rallied, leaving themselves a two-point deficit with a mere 4.7 ticks left on the clock. The game would come down to a familiar hero in a familiar situation. Following the inbounds pass and with 3.6 seconds remaining in the game, Robert Horry let fly the potential game winning three-pointer. Only this time the Lakers saw the ball go in, then inexplicably rim out. A shot that had always fallen in the past would not this time around. In, and then, out. Playing for the first season since the Lakers moved to Los Angeles without the legendary Chick Hearn as their voice, it was indeed Chick who would have called it best, \"In and out, Heartbrrrrrrreak!\" This shot seemed to redefine the phrases' very meaning and symbolically sealed the Lakers fate. The Lakers lost the Western Conference Semifinals in six games as the San Antonio Spurs advanced and went on to claim their second NBA title.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nWith a new coaching staff headed by two-time NBA Champion Rudy Tomjanovich and a starting line-up returning only one player from last season's Western Conference Championship team, the 2004-05 Lakers figured to be a work in progress. The team had new faces such as Lamar Odom, a starter on the 2004 U.S. Men's Olympic basketball team, and Caron Butler, a 2002-03 All-Rookie First Team selection, mixed with the veteran leadership of Vlade Divac returning home to where he began his career. Early on, however, an ominous tone was set when Divac, penciled in as a starter before training camp, was lost due to a herniated disc in his back that would ultimately keep him out for a majority of the season. Nonetheless, the Lakers opened the year with a convincing 89-78 victory over the upstart Denver Nuggets before a sell-out crowd at STAPLES Center on November 2. While unable to put together a three-game win streak throughout the opening two months, Los Angeles still built a 15-12 record at the turn of the calendar. Of their 12 losses before January 1, five came by five or fewer points.\n\nOne of those games included the most anticipated regular season basketball game in recent NBA history, matching the Miami Heat and former Laker Shaquille O'Neal against the Lakers and Kobe Bryant on Christmas day. In a game that lived up to its billing, Bryant scored a game-high 42 points while O'Neal posted a double-double (24 points, 11 rebounds) in their first ever meeting. Los Angeles, however, couldn't hold a seven-point fourth quarter lead and lost in overtime 102-104.\n\nDespite the close losses and losing Bryant for a month to injury after suffering a severely sprained right ankle against Cleveland on January 13, the Lakers continued to improve and moved to six games above .500 (22-16) by January 21. Los Angeles closed out January and opened February with consecutive victories before the season would take a dramatic shift.\n\nOn February 2, Tomjanovich stepped down from his head coaching post due to health reasons, leaving long-time Lakers' assistant coach Frank Hamblen to man the ship as Los Angeles entered the toughest part of their schedule. Exactly one month after injuring his ankle, Bryant returned to the Lakers' lineup February 13 at Cleveland. While dropping his first game back to the Cavs, the Lakers rebounded by winning their last game before the All-Star break, to which Bryant was selected a Western Conference starter, and reeled off their first three-game win streak of the season with two wins immediately following the break, improving to 28-24.\n\nThe team continued to see-saw, however, dropping their next four games following its three-game surge. Fittingly enough, Los Angeles then won four of its next five including back-to-back road victories at Dallas and Charlotte. In the game against Dallas, Bryant saw his franchise record streak of 43 consecutive free throws made come to an end, surpassing the previous mark of 40 held by Hall-of-Famer Gail Goodrich. With four games in the next five nights, Los Angeles dropped each of them, falling below .500 for the first time since they were 1-2 on November 5. In the process, the Lakers lost their leading rebounder and second leading scorer when Lamar Odom suffered a strained left shoulder March 18 against Indiana, an injury that would sideline him for the remainder of the season. The Lakers continued to slide, ultimately dropping eight consecutive games, the second longest streak in franchise history. In the process, Los Angeles dropped nine straight road games, tying the 2003-04 Lakers mark for second longest streak in franchise history.\n\nDespite the Lakers struggles down the stretch, third-year forward Caron Butler was a bright spot, averaging 22.8 points for the month of April to go along with 7.6 rebounds and 2.22 steals. In addition, as a team, the Lakers established new franchise records for both three-point field goals made (644) and three-point field goals attempted (1813). Also, entering the year, no Lakers' team had shot 100 percent from the foul line since the 1991-92 season when the team converted 27-of-27 from the charity stripe in a January game against Denver. In their March 8, 2005 contest with the Clippers, the Lakers converted 23-of-23 free throws, marking the second time during the season that the Lakers shot 100 percent from the foul line. Earlier in the year, the Lakers converted 20-of-20 free-throws in an 89-87 road victory over the Clippers December 11.\n\nEntering the Lakers regular season finale needing just three points to become the 115th player in NBA history to amass 14,000 points, Kobe Bryant scored 37 points against the Portland Trail Blazers to bring his career total to 14,034 at the end of his ninth NBA season. Already the youngest player in league history to reach 10,000 points, Bryant surpassed Michael Jordan as the youngest player to reach the 14,000 point benchmark.\n\nWhile playing just 46 games (23-23) with their opening night starting lineup of Chris Mihm, Odom, Butler, Bryant and Chucky Atkins, the Lakers season culminated in April with the team missing the playoffs for the first time since the 1993-94 season.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nThe 2005-06 season saw the return of Phil Jackson - and with him, the return of the Lakers' winning tradition. Following six seasons, four NBA Finals appearances and three consecutive championships, Phil Jackson took one year away from the team before signing on once again to coach the league's most storied franchise.\n\nA Jackson return meant a reunion with Kobe Bryant, two of the key components from the Lakers 2000, 2001 and 2002 Championship seasons. And despite the return, as well as significant off-season moves by the franchise, fans and media alike remained skeptical as to whether the Lakers would even challenge for a spot in the postseason. After missing the playoffs in 2004-05, the Lakers used their first lottery pick since 1994 to select high- school center Andrew Bynum, the youngest player ever selected in the history of the draft. In addition, the Lakers brought back a familiar face from the Showtime era in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to mentor the newly acquired Bynum at center. Los Angeles acquired forward Kwame Brown from the Washington Wizards via trade and signed free-agent Smush Parker to help add depth in both the front court and at guard.\n\nCombined with a few new faces and influx of young talent, the franchise was poised for a new start. United once again, Jackson and a rejuvenated Bryant wasted no time in getting the Lakers back to their traditional winning ways. The Lakers emerged victorious in their season opener at Denver with a 99-97 overtime thriller in which Bryant connected on the game-winner with 0.6 seconds remaining in the extra period. Although the team's first extensive road-trip in November proved to be treacherous for the team as they experienced their first three-game losing streak of the season, the Lakers opened eyes around the league by going 5-1 on a six-game trip in early December which included wins at Chicago and Dallas.\n\nWhile the team's youth led to inconsistency early on, it was clear that Bryant would need to shoulder more of a scoring burden in the early going. On December 20th at STAPLES Center, Bryant displayed just how up to the task he was at the expense of the Dallas Mavericks as he single handedly outscored the entire Mavericks squad 62-61 through three quarters. Bryant's 30-point third established a new franchise record for points in a quarter while tying for the fourth best period in NBA history as the Lakers went on to lead by as many as 35 in the contest as Bryant sat out the entire fourth period.\n\nDespite a four-game losing streak in late December that seeped into early January, the Lakers bounced back January 6 at home against the Philadelphia 76ers when Bryant and Smush Parker combined for 12-of-12 shooting from 3-point territory as Los Angeles won easily 119-93. In the victory, Bryant established a new franchise record for 3-pointers made without a miss, connecting on all seven of his attempts. Parker made all five of his attempts, marking the first time since the introduction of the 3-point shot in 1979 that two teammates have been perfect from behind the arc with a minimum of five attempts each.\n\nScoring 40 of his game-high 50 points in the second half the following night on the road against the Clippers, Bryant helped the Lakers overcome a 13-point third quarter deficit to win 112-109. Two days later, on January 9, Bryant became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in November of 1964 to record four consecutive games scoring 45-plus points. His 45-point, 10-rebound, five-assist performance propelled the Lakers to a 96-90 win over the visiting Indiana Pacers as they moved two games above .500 at 18-16.\n\nLater in the month, the Lakers avenged a disappointing Christmas Day loss to the Miami Heat with a 100-92 victory at STAPLES Center on Martin Luther King Day. Bryant led all scorers with 37 points while Lamar Odom narrowly missed a triple-double with 19 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists in the victory.\n\nFollowing a disappointing road loss to the Sacramento Kings in which the Lakers surrendered a five-point lead with 35.5 seconds remaining in regulation and a one-sided defeat to the Suns in Phoenix a night later, Los Angeles aimed to end their skid in a January 22 contest against the visiting Toronto Raptors. The Lakers once again opened the game sluggishly, falling behind by as many as 18 points beginning the third. From that point, however, the rest, as they say, is history. In one of the greatest performances in NBA history, Bryant took control of the game, scoring 55 points in the second half alone and amassing a staggering 81 points on the night to carry the Lakers to a 122-104 victory. Bryant's totals for points in a half and game became the second highest totals in NBA history, bettered only by Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game (59-point half) back in March of 1962.\n\nBryant's milestone season, however, was only beginning to gather steam. Entering the team's March 3 match-up at Golden State, Bryant needed just 10 points to become the youngest player in NBA history to reach 16,000 career points. Bryant more than reached the mark as his 42 points propelled the team to a 106-94 victory over the Warriors. Nearly one month later on April 2, Bryant tied Elgin Baylor's Lakers franchise record with his 23rd 40-plus point game of the year - leading his squad to a104-88 victory over Houston. Just four days later at Denver, Bryant surpassed the Baylor mark with his 24th 40-point game of the season, but the Lakers would fall to the Nuggets in a 108-110 overtime thriller. Bryant once again took aim at another Lakers' record prior to their April 14 contest versus Portland. Needing 16 points to surpass Baylor's franchise record of 2,719 points established more than four decades earlier during the 1962-63 season, Bryant erupted for 50 points en route to a 110-99 victory.\n\nTo top off a magical regular season highlighted by brilliant individual performances and an end of the season playoff push, Bryant helped lead the Lakers to their fifth straight victory and 11th win in their final 14 games with a 115-95 victory over the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. In the process, Bryant scored 35 points to finish the season with 2,832 points - the 7th greatest scoring season of all-time and 8th greatest scoring average (35.4 points) in league history. With the win, the Lakers finished with the sixth best record in the Western Conference and secured a seventh seed in the Western Conference Playoffs.\n\nFacing the heavily favored Suns in the First Round, the Lakers dropped Game 1 at Phoenix 102-107 but came away encouraged that they could indeed get a desired split on the road. Los Angeles controlled the tempo from the outset of Game 2 and behind Bryant's 29 points, 10 rebounds and five assists and Lamar Odom's 21 points, seven rebounds and five assists, the Lakers evened the series at one game apiece with a 99-93 victory heading back to STAPLES Center.\n\nAfter winning Game 3 99-92 to take a 2-1 series lead, the Lakers looked to take a commanding 3-1 advantage entering Game 4. Despite playing just 10 first-half minutes due to foul trouble, Kobe Bryant came up big late in one of the most memorable playoff games in Lakers history, connecting on a game-tying driving lay-up with 0.7 seconds to force overtime after Smush Parker stole the ball from Steve Nash along the sideline, leading to the break and lay-up. In the overtime period, Luke Walton tied up Nash to force a jump ball with Los Angeles down one with just a few seconds remaining. The tip went in the Lakers' direction and into Bryant's hands. With the clock winding down, Bryant took the ball up court and fading away from the right elbow, knocked down the jumper to secure a miraculous 99-98 victory, giving the Lakers a 3-1 series lead.\n\nAfter dropping Game 5 in Phoenix, the Lakers returned home looking to close out the series. With Bryant scoring the team's final five points of regulation to put Los Angeles up three with 29.3 seconds remaining, Tim Thomas connected on a game-tying three-pointer off of an offensive rebound with 6.3 seconds, ultimately sending the contest into an overtime in which the Suns scored 21 points to force a Game 7 with a 126-118 victory. Having been just seconds from the Western Conference Semifinals, a seemingly stunned Lakers team succumbed to the Suns momentum in the deciding Game 7 at Phoenix and were eliminated from the postseason with a 90-121 loss at US Airways Center.\n\nDespite a disappointing end to the season, the return of Jackson coupled with the historic brilliance of Kobe Bryant and a memorable playoff series against Phoenix made for one of the more memorable Lakers seasons of all-time while providing new-found momentum for future success to come.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nWhen the Lakers raised the 2010 NBA trophy after defeating Boston in seven games, it wasn't long before visions of a potential three-peat took hold.\n\nEven though no team had made it to four straight Finals since Magic Johnson's Lakers (1982-85) and Larry Bird's Celtics (1984-87), L.A. was returning its unmatched size alongside Kobe Bryant, thinking the 2011 trophy was theirs to lose. And the greatest coach of all-time, Phil Jackson, already owning a ridiculous three three-peats and more rings than he could wear on his fingers, was coming back to boot.\n\n\"After a couple weeks of deliberation, it is time to get back to the challenge of putting together a team that can defend its title in the 2010-11 season,\"said Jacksonwhen announcing his return in July. \"It'll be the last stand for me, and I hope a grand one.\"\n\nBut there was a bit of knowing hesitancy even then for Jackson, who recognized the minefield his players would have to navigate.\n\n\"It's an impossible task,\"he said before training camp. \"You just go about it and don't think about how difficult it is, and play each game and don't worry about anything but that. It takes remarkable talent to be able to do it.\"\n\nThe talent was certainly there for L.A., who managed to win 57 regular season games for the second consecutive year. Bryant and Gasol were again named to the All-Star team, Lamar Odom had his best season as a Laker (as shown with Sixth Man of the Year honors), Bynum dominated on defense and the glass for the first extended period of his career, Derek Fisher was steady as ever while steering the ship, Ron Artest remained among the league's very best perimeter defenders and the \"Killah Bee's\" bench trio of Matt Barnes, Steve Blake and Shannon Brown showed early-season promise.\n\nSigns of mental and physical fatigue throughout the season are telling with the benefit of hindsight, but they occurred for a team that had already earned the benefit of the doubt. Until someone actually beat the Lakers four times in a playoff series, overreaction was, perhaps, hasty. They'd won too many big games together to overanalyze a rough preseason in Europe, to let concern about Bynum (missed the first 24 games) or Bryant's respective knees reign supreme, to sweat losing streaks that reached as many as five games for the first time since Gasol came over from Memphis in 2008. They were too big, too long, too strong ... it seemed regardless of their regular season travails, they would figure it out in the playoffs.\n\nThere were some, most notably Bryant, that weren't even willing to pick against the Lakers when they were down 3-0 to the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nBut Kobe, unable to really gain full strength in a knee that was operated on the previous summer, didn't have the same burst. Gasol's struggles in playoffs were as foreign to the team as his Spanish passport. Meanwhile, the team chemistry just was not the same, shown on the court through a lack of cohesive defensive rotations and only a passing resemblance of the pretty triangle offense that marked Phil Jackson's Lakers at their best.\n\nAfter Dallas - who played fantastic team basketball throughout the playoffs - blew L.A.'s doors off in Game 4 to shockingly cut the season well short of the only acceptable goal, Lakerland had a chance to decompress, to try and explain, to attempt to and understand how a team that still felt itself the league's best had been swept. But the best answer may not have come from Bryant, Jackson, or GM Mitch Kupchak. Instead, head trainer Gary Vitti, who had spent more individual time amongst both the players and the coaching staff than anyone,offered his insight.\n\nYou can feel the fatigue even from 2008 to 2009, but there was a psychological push because you lost (to Boston in the Finals) that you push through that fatigue. From 2009 to 2010, you saw more fatigue, but it was Boston again, so we had something to prove. That's a psychological advantage. And then this season, we just ran out of gas. It's normal. When you play through June, it doesn't give you a lot of time to get your body and your mind right before you're back in training camp. It just doesn't, that's the way it is and it's why so few teams repeat, let alone three-peat. There just wasn't enough left in the tank. There was just no way to refill it ... and we tried.\n\nPretty simple.\n\nConsider that the lowest moment of the regular season came on Feb. 16 at Cleveland, when L.A. lost its third straight game prior to the All-Star break to the league's worst team, one it had beaten by 55 points on Jan. 11, then heard about it throughout All-Star weekend. This was a tired bunch of Lakers.\n\nWith just four days away from one another to find some collective energy, L.A.'s response was to go 17-1 once the break was over, unleashing controlled fury against many of the league's best, including San Antonio, Dallas twice, Oklahoma City, Portland, Orlando and Atlanta. The defending champs were back. Right?\n\nBut the fatigue was not a mirage, and it returned in a hurry. L.A. dropped five straight games in April and limped into the playoffs. And after needing six games against the Hornets in Round 1 came the ignominious sweep at the hands of Dirk and Co., and now a long, drawn out summer to think about it (imagine the look on Kobe's face when the Mavs raised Larry O'Brien...).\n\nPhil Jackson's premonition turned out to be accurate, as a fourth trip to the Finals was simply too much to ask.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nThe 2011-12 Lakers campaign almost never got off the ground, with the NBA lockout that began on July 1 extending into late November until an agreement was finally forged.\n\nAs such, new coach Mike Brown â hired over the summer to replace Phil Jackson â had quite a challenge, afforded only a two-week preseason to put in an entirely new system. Adding to the difficulty was a trade that ended up not going through, with reigning Sixth Man Lamar Odom an ultimate casualty of the process as he ended up in Dallas in exchange for a trade exception and a second round pick.\n\nThe season began on Christmas Day, with the Lakers opening the year playing unprecedented back-to-back-to-back games because of the compressed 66-game schedule. L.A. opened without the services of center Andrew Bynum, who was serving a 4-game suspension stemming from a second-round sweep to Dallas in the 2011 playoffs, and narrowly lost its first two contests.\n\nThe purple and gold struggled to string together consistent performances early on, especially on the road, where they posted just a 2-7 record during the first month of the season. But thanks to Kobe Bryant, they still managed to win a lot of games. Despite battling through a torn ligament in his wrist, the longtime All-Star strung together four games of 40+ points in early January, carrying a Lakers offense that was still trying to adjust to the new system.\n\nLooking to upgrade a roster that posted a 27-16 record before the trade deadline, Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak traded for Cavs reserve point guard Ramon Sessions, while sending Derek Fisher to Houston in a separate deal that also pought big man Jordan Hill to Los Angeles. With Sessions adding a pick and roll game to the offense, the Lakers looked a more dangerous team heading into the postseason, highlighted by a 17-point, 9-assist performance at Dallas a week after he was acquired in mid March.\n\nThe Lakers closed the season with a 14-9 mark to finish at 41-25, enough for third place in the Western Conference, their play slipping a bit after the No. 1 spot was no longer in reach. Among the major positives from the regular season was the play of Bynum, who missed only one game due to injury and averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 boards â both career highs â with 1.9 blocks on 55.8 percent shooting. That was good enough to earn the starting center slot on the Western All-Star team, where he joined 14-time All-Star Bryant.\n\nIn mid-April, Bynum pulled down a career-high 30 rebounds at San Antonio. Only four other Lakers in franchise history had previously accomplished that feat: George Mikan; Elgin Baylor; Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nBynum's game was absolutely aided by the play of Gasol, who moved away from the basket despite maintaining the NBA's best low post skills in order to accommodate his younger, bigger teammate. One week after Bynumâs 30-rebound game, Gasol put up his fifth career triple-double on the road at Golden State with 21 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Gasol's play down the stretch helped the Lakers go 5-2 while Bryant missed seven games due to a painful shin injury.\n\nThe Lakers drew the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs, taking a commanding 3-1 lead despite playing without Metta World Peace, suspended seven games for elbowing James Harden in the second to last regular season game. Denver rallied to win the next two games, forcing a Game 7 at Staples Center, but the Lakers won out behind a combined 39 points, 35 rebounds and 10 blocks from Bynum and Gasol, plus 17 points and eight assists from Bryant.\n\nNext up for the Lakers: the Oklahoma City Thunder. L.A. faced an early 1-0 deficit and found themselves within two minutes of sending the series back to Los Angeles all knotted up. Up seven points down the stretch of Game 2, L.A. couldn't hold on for the victory, and faced a 2-0 deficit heading home for Game 3.\n\nL.A. won Game 3 in front of its fans, but again blew a lead in the final moments of Game 4, OKC closing the game on a 22-8 run to take a commanding 3-1 lead in the series. The Lakers were fatigued against the younger Thunder, since Games 3 and 4 came on a very rare playoff back-to-back, due to the condensed schedule forced by the lockout.\n\nBryant went off for 42 points in Game 5, but it wasn't quite enough, the Thunder winning 106-90 to send the Lakers home before the Western Finals for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe answer from Kupchak and Dr. Jerry and Jim Buss? Get Dwight Howard and Steve Nash for the coming season.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nTo understand how the Lakers finished 2014-15 with the worst record in franchise history (21-61), look no further than the combination of a league-high 339 games missed to injury/illness, and the preseason commitment to maintaining roster flexibility heading into the coming summer.\n\nSome background: After the Lakers went to three consecutive NBA Finals (2008-2010), General Manager Mitch Kupchak and his staff first attempted to trade for Chris Paul, before ultimately moving to acquire Dwight Howard and Steve Nash. Howard departed for Houston prior to 2013-14, and Nash proved unable to stay healthy, and was declared out for the season in October ahead of his subsequently announced retirement later in the year.\n\nWith Pau Gasol signing in Chicago last summer, Kobe Bryant was the lone holdover from that championship run. And as Kupchak has reiterated on several occasions, it was the Lakersâ wish to maintain some financial flexibility heading into the final season of Bryantâs large contract, which led to L.A. avoiding signing players that it didnât see as future championship pieces or stars to long-term deals.\n\nHead coach Byron Scott replaced Mike DâAntoni, but dealt with a similar roster of players on short-term contracts, a nod to that need for future flexibility. Kupchak assembled a roster that the organization thought would be competitive, if not one capable of seriously contending, but no fewer than seven players â Bryant, Nash, Nick Young, Julius Randle, Xavier Henry, Ronnie Price and Wayne Ellington â suffered season-ending injuries at some point of the campaign.\n\nSuch was the injury situation that the Lakers had only two available guards for the season finale against Sacramento on April 15, and both were call ups from the D-Fenders of the D-League: Jabari Brown and Vander Blue. Midseason acquisition Tarik Black made for the third undrafted rookie in the starting lineup. Black made his mark with athleticism, finishing third among all rookies in rebounding, and all three are ones to watch on L.A.âs Summer League or perhaps preseason rosters.\n\nBryantâs injury was the most impactful to the loss column: He tore his rotator cuff on Jan. 21 at New Orleans and was shut down for the season. Despite struggling with his efficiency while shooting a career-low 37.3 percent from the field, Bryant did finish ninth in the league with 22.3 points per game, and passed Michael Jordan for third on the NBAâs all-time scoring chart with 32,482 points.\n\nRandle, a hardwood star since middle school and during his one year at Kentucky, fell to the Lakers at No. 7 overall in the 2014 Draft. Heâd be a harbinger for L.A.âs season when he went down in the first game against Houston on Oct. 28, and was unable to show off the skills that made him the highest Lakers draft pick since James Worthy (1982). Randle drew rave reviews inside the facility for his dedication to studying the game and attacking his rehabilitation, dead set not to waste his rookie year in preparation for the coming season.\n\nEasily the biggest bright spot for the Lakers was the emergence of Randleâs fellow rookie and No. 46 overall pick Jordan Clarkson, who rose from relative unknown to the Western Conference Rookie of the Month for March. Clarkson got his chance to play in part due to all of the injuries, and he certainly capitalized upon it. After the All-Star break, Clarkson averaged 16.7 points on 47.9 percent shooting with 5.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 32.6 minutes per game, proving himself a real asset for the organization moving forward.\n\nEd Davis was another consistent plus for the purple and gold, ranking 10th in the NBA in offensive rebounds (230) despite limited playing time as Scott developed the young roster. He made 60.7 percent of his shots, ranking second only to DeAndre Jordan (71.0 percent) in the NBA.\n\nFellow veterans Jordan Hill, Jeremy Lin, Carlos Boozer and Wesley Johnson had moments of success throughout the year, while former Lakers second round picks Ryan Kelly and Robert Sacre earned plenty of playing time to develop their games.\n\nIf there âs a positive out of the season aside from Clarksonâs emergence, itâs that the Lakers have the fourth-best chance to earn a top three pick in the 2015 Draft. They also possess Houstonâs first-round pick (No. 27 overall) and have space to acquire talent in free agency. Coupled with the return of Bryant, Randle and Young from injury, 2015-16 canât come soon enough after the most difficult of seasons in Los Angeles.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nAn incredible 60-point performance from Kobe Bryant in the final game of his Hall-of-Fame career put a bow on what was otherwise a very difficult 2015-16 season for the Lakers.\n\nL.A. went 17-65, finishing behind only Philadelphia. The Lakers did end up with the No. 2 overall pick as a result â which turned into Brandon Ingram â to serve as a payoff for a difficult season to stomach for the proud franchise.\n\nThe two stated 2015-16 goals from coach Byron Scott* had been to send Kobe out the right way, and to develop a group of young players that the franchise hoped would offer dividends down the road.\n\n*Scottâs contract was not picked up after the season.\n\nAn argument can be made that both were accomplished as the year wore on, with Bryant staying healthy enough to play in 66 games, averaging a team-best 17.6 points at age 37 through a career-low field goal percentage (35.8). Bryant showed a softer side to the Black Mamba personality, delighting fans across the country and watching around the world. There were moments of brilliance, gems spread across the campaign, of course none equaling the April 13 finale in which Jack Nicholson, Jay-Z, Kanye West and, well, everybody, could only observe and cheer in disbelief as Bryantâs point total climbed and climbed as he delivered a final victory.\n\nMeanwhile, the young quadrant DâAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and Larry Nance, Jr., who closed that final game against Utah next to Bryant, all showed degrees of progress and, thus, signs of hope moving forward.\n\nKobe, and to a lesser degree, veteran Lou Williams, dominated the basketball for much of the season, but when Russell was given the reigns, he produced like many expected from the 2015âs No. 2 overall pick.\n\nIn 10 games just after the All-Star break, Russell averaged 21.0 points, 4.8 assists and 3.1 3-pointers made, highlighted by a 39-point season-high effort against Brooklyn in which he drained a dagger three. His minutes ticked up as Bryant took a few games off, and he responded by showcasing his mix of shooting, passing and size. Russellâs season averages of 13.2 points, 3.3 assists and 3.4 boards with 1.2 steals rank right there with what current All-Star point guards produced when they were just 19 years old.\n\nWith a long way to grow on both ends of the floor and in the weight room, Russell attacked the offseason and was arguably the best player in the Las Vegas Summer League. He has a chip on his shoulder heading into his second season.\n\nRussellâs backcourt mate, Clarkson, built on a solid rookie season by serving as the teamâs most consistent offensive player, producing 15.5 points per game on 43.3 percent shooting plus 4.0 boards and 2.4 assists with 1.1 steals per game. The No. 46 overall pick in 2015 was rewarded with a new contract after the season, and is expected to start alongside Russell in the backcourt next season and, perhaps, for years to come. Clarkson recognized the need to improve his defense, a focus for the offseason, in addition to his three-point range (34.7 percent).\n\nIn what was essentially Randleâs rookie season â considering he only played 14 minutes in 2014-15 before breaking his leg â he was one of only 13 players in the NBA to average a double-double, ranking 15th with 34 of them. In 28.2 minutes per game, Randle still ranked 10th overall on the glass, and grabbed more defensive boards than all but two players (Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan). The former No. 7 overall pick was in the Lakersâ practice facility more than any other player in the offseason, working to improve his entire game, with a focus on his jump shot and right hand.\n\nNance, Jr. went from being a relative unknown as the No. 27 overall pick out of Wyoming to a clear NBA rotation player with upside thanks to his combination of elite athleticism and hoops IQ. He scored 5.5 points with 5.0 boards and nearly a steal per game in 20.1 minutes despite battling an at-times sore knee that he tore in college. Now healthy, Nance, Jr. was terrific at Summer League and could have a critical role in new coach Luke Waltonâs rotation.\n\nThe Lakers got contributions in other areas from veterans like Williams (15.3 points), Roy Hibbert (1.4 blocks) and Brandon Bass (7.2 points, 4.3 boards), but it was generally either Bryant or the young guys that were the focus.\n\nThe team got younger for 2016-17 with the additions of Ingram and No. 32 overall pick Ivica Zubac (both 19), though free agent signees Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov â as well as Jose Calderon, acquired in a trade â will bring valuable experience.\n\nIt would be impossible for any franchise to replace a player like Bryant, who brought so much for so long. With that said, Waltonâs hiring has already brought a newfound energy into the franchise. That combined with a talented stable of young players from the last three NBA Draftâs has the Lakers eager and optimistic to move forward from a difficult 2015-16 campaign.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nUnder first year coach Luke Walton, the Lakers went 26-56 to finish with the third worst record in the NBA, despite winning nine more games than the 2015-16 squad.\n\nThe season was marked by significant changes in the front office. Just before the All-Star break, Lakers Co-owner and Governor Jeanie Buss hired a new President of Basketball Operations, Earvin âMagicâ Johnson, and soon added a new GM, Rob Pelinka to replace Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak.\n\nIn Magicâs first move, the teamâs leading scorer in the first half of the season, Lou Williams, was shipped to Houston for the Rocketsâ first round pick and Corey Brewer. Meanwhile, L.A. traded veteran guard Marcelo Huertas to Houston for young point guard Tyler Ennis in a separate deal. They then waived another veteran, Jose Calderon, and called up David Nwaba from their D-League affiliate L.A. D-Fenders.\n\nIn concert with Walton, Johnson and Pelinka oversaw the continued development of the many young players on L.A.âs roster, as many of the veteran players sat subsequent to the break.\n\nSome of the vets played well earlier in the season, like Nick Young, and some struggled, like Luol Deng. Others played OK, like Timofey Mozgov. Young hit an impressive 170 three-pointers in just 60 games, nearly setting a franchise record (Nick van Exel, 183) on a solid 40.4 percent, while playing some of the best defense of his career. Deng managed just 7.6 points per game on 38.7 percent shooting, while Mozgov scored 7.4 points with 4.9 boards in 20.4 minutes.\n\nBut the focus of the season was on the improvement of 19-year-old Brandon Ingram, Ivica Zubac (20), DâAngelo Russell (21), Julius Randle (22), Jordan Clarkson (24) and Larry Nance, Jr. (24).\n\nNobody made bigger gains than Ingram. While learning what the NBA was all about early in the season, the four-time state champion from Kinston, N.C. averaged 8.0 points per game on 36.3 percent from the field. But after the All-Star break, something clicked, and Ingram put up 13.2 points on 47.5 percent from the field, looking like a totally different player. No Laker received more praise in the exit interviews from his teammates, in addition to Walton and Pelinka, and it was for good reason. Having gone against LeBron, Kawhi, Paul George and Durant, Ingram picked up the consistent aggressive mentality needed to succeed as a two-way wing player, and grew in confidence with each matchup. His future is quite bright.\n\nSpeaking of bright, fellow 2016 selection Ivica Zubac (No. 32) was quite the pleasant surprise. Looking at per 36 numbers from his 11 starts, Zu averaged 16.8 points (52.9 percent field goals), 9.4 boards and 2.0 blocks with 1.8 assists. Improving his defensive versatility will be a big focus, but he really showed off his wide array of post moves, great hands and strong work in the screen/roll game in addition to his ability to protect the rim. He went off for 25 points on 12 of 15 FGâs plus 11 boards at Denver (3/13/17).\n\nRussell made some major gains in his second season season. In 21 games after the break, he averaged 18.5 points on 42.5 percent field goals and 35.6 percent from three (2.5 makes per game), along with 5.0 assists and 1.8 steals to lead the team in each category. Russell showed his varied skill set at both PG and SG, including an excellent handle, an ability to score inside and out, a quick release on his shot and some real talent to find teammates in screen/roll situations or just generally within Waltonâs offense. Heâll need to continue to work on his body, and on his defense, but heâs well ahead of pace statistically on most of the current NBA All-Star guards when they were 21.\n\nRandle saw a jump in production despite playing just about the same number of minutes from his second season, most notably raising his field goal percentage from 42.9 percent to 48.7 percent. How? His shot selection and patience improved significantly, and he made progress on his jump shot and finishing at the rim. His per 36 numbers were strong: 16.5 points; 10.7 boards; 4.5 assists and 0.8 steals. When Randle played at peak energy, L.A. was a much better team, and Walton and the front office have challenged him to improve his body even more to be able to play like that more consistently. Even so, he tied Nance, Jr. for the most win shares on the team in 2016-17 (3.5).\n\nClarkson was one of the NBAâs most productive bench players for much of the season, before Walton tried him as a starter alongside Russell after the break. His numbers were similar to his second season, as he posted 14.7 points on 44.5 percent shooting on the season (15.5 points, 43.3 percent in 2015-16). But his production spiked after the break as his minutes went up, resulting in 19.4 points and 4.2 assists a night.\n\nance, Jr., such a versatile talent that L.A. smartly grabbed at No. 27 overall in 2015, had some well-rounded per-36 minutes numbers: 11.2 points; 9.2 boards; 2.4 assists; 2.0 steals; and 1.0 blocks. He showed his versatility by being productive in a reserve power forward role, and also as a starting center late in the season. No Laker played better off-the-ball defense, and he pledged his desire to keep improving on the ball as well.\n\nNwaba and Ennis both showed signs of being legitimate NBA rotation players once receiving regular minutes late in the season, and reserve bigs Tarik Black and Thomas Robinson had their respective moments as well.\n\nMetta World Peace made an incredibly positive impact on his younger teammates, which Walton and the young players went out of their way to note throughout the season. His on-court production was limited, but he managed to go out with an unlikely 18-point performance at Staples Center in what was likely his last game for the Purple and Gold.\n\nIn sum, the talented young core is now established alongside the combination of a very popular head coach and new front office, giving reason for excitement that everything is headed in the right direction towards the thing the Lakers care most about: winning more games.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nWith a 35-47 record in the 2017-18 campaign, the Lakers added nine wins from the previous season, and saw their young players continue to improve to solidify a talented young core thatâs been built through the past four NBA Drafts.\n\nThe season really began in Las Vegas, where the Lakers won their first Summer League championship as No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball earned MVP honors, and No. 27 pick Kyle Kuzma was named MVP of the championship game. Soon after, the Lakers moved from the Toyota Sports Center into the state-of-the-art UCLA Health Training Center, which the players (and staff) were thrilled to declare their new home.\n\nAfter starting the regular season 5-5, the Lakers struggled with injuries and unsteady play and fell to a low point of 16 games below .500 (11-27) on Jan. 5. That concluded a 9-game losing streak in which L.A. lost a series of close games to tough opponents, and in the midst of it, Julius Randle entered the starting lineup, Ball returned from a shoulder injury and Brandon Ingram started to play the best basketball of his career as the team turned things around rather quickly.\n\nIn fact, the Purple and Gold went 20-9 through March 13 to take the record up to 31-36. They remained a distance away from the final playoff spot due to the early losing, but L.A.âs play under 2nd-year head coach Luke Walton was improved enough to catch the attention of the league.\n\nWhile the Lakers ended up finishing the season with the 8th fewest games missed to injury/illness (133, which was well below the league average of 185), many of those games came in the final month, when Ball, Ingram and Isaiah Thomas missed the bulk of the action. In related news, the Lakers struggled to log wins in the final weeks, going 4-11 to finish the season.\n\nAs the sixth-youngest team in the NBA, the Lakers truly relied upon players in their first few seasons, and a terrific 2017 Draft helped considerably towards that end.\n\nBall averaged 10.2 points, 7.2 assists, 6.9 rebounds and 1.7 steals, numbers that closely mirror those of Jason Kiddâs rookie campaign (11.7, 7.7, 5.4, 1.9), and he was very good defensively, particularly for a 20-year-old, which helped him have the best net rating on the team. He was named to the All-Rookie 2nd team despite missing 30 games with various injuries.\n\nKuzma â acquired in an offseason trade with Brooklyn involving Brook Lopez, Timofey Mozgov and DâAngelo Russell â was a revelation that ultimately made the All-Rookie 1st team behind his 16.1 points (tied for the team lead), 6.3 rebounds and 159 made 3-pointers on 36.6 percent behind the line.\n\nNo. 30 pick Josh Hart was also impressive, particularly late in the season. He averaged 7.9 points and 4.2 rebounds while leading the team in 3-point shooting (39.6 percent), and more notably, in 23 starts, posted 13.3 points, 6.0 boards and 2.0 assists with 1.0 steals.\n\nAt No. 42, L.A. took Thomas Bryant, and while the 20-year-old appeared in only 15 games with the Lakers, he tore up the G-League for the South Bay Lakers, averaging 19.7 points, 7.4 boards and 1.5 blocks in 37 games and made G-League First Team.\n\nStill younger than most rookies, Brandon Ingram turned 20 in September, and finished the season matching Kuzma and Randle with 16.1 points per game to lead the team, adding 5.3 boards, 3.9 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.6 blocks. He improved his shooting percentage from 40.2 as a rookie to 47.0 percent, and his three-point percentage from 29.4 to 39.0, while also showing even more versatility than some expected by playing point guard, as he successfully filled in for Ball in February. Ingram did miss 23 games with a variety of minor injuries late in the season after posting 18.6 points, 5.6 assists, 5.2 boards, 1.1 blocks and 0.6 steals in February on 54.5 percent from the field and 52.2 percent from three.\n\nIngram, Ball and Kuzma all had arguments for team MVP, but Julius Randle may have been the best player on the team, particularly once he entered the starting line up in late December. In his 49 starts, he went for 18.6 points, 9.1 boards, 3.1 assists and 0.6 steals on 56 percent from the field and 75 percent at the free throw line. Randle showed the ability to defend big men inside while also switching onto guards on the perimeter, which unlocked L.A.âs ability to play small and switch 1 through 5. Furthermore, he played all 82 games, the only Laker to do so.\n\nLopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope were the two veterans that were with the Lakers throughout the season, and each had moments of strong play, particularly later in the season. Meanwhile, Corey Brewer and Isaiah Thomas contributed on- and off-court leadership before and after the All-Star break, respectively.\n\nTyler Ennis had his best month of action in April when Ball and Ingram were both out, while Luol Deng played only in the first game of the season.\n\nL.A. also took advantage of the first year for the two-way contracts with the South Bay Lakers, and got some needed minutes from Alex Caruso throughout the season, as well as Vander Blue and eventually Gary Payton II. They also called up longtime D-League/G-League veteran Andre Ingram for the final two games of the season, and Ingram scored 19 points on 6 of 8 shooting with three blocks in his NBA debut against Houston, more swats than heâd ever totaled in 10 years of minor league hoops.\n\nAt the February trade deadline, Larry Nance, Jr. and Jordan Clarkson were traded to Cleveland for Thomas, Channing Frye and Clevelandâs 1st Round pick (No. 25 overall), a move that allows the Lakers to get back into the first round, since their own pick (No. 10 overall) will be made by Philadelphia*.\n\n*Philly acquired the pick from Phoenix, whoâd in turn acquired it back in 2012 from the Lakers in the Steve Nash deal.\n\nThat move by President of Basketball Operations Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka also freed up additional salary cap space heading into the offseason, giving the Lakers the opportunity to be in the mix for free agents, or to assume contracts in a trade, if so desired.\n\nWith a very strong stable of young talent that should continue to get better, plus the space to add significant pieces, the Lakers appear closer to once again establishing themselves as the NBA winner that theyâve traditionally been.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nWhen LeBron James decided to join the Lakers as a free agent in July of 2018, he brought not only his four MVPâs and three Finals MVPâs, but a sense of confidence that L.A. would return to NBA prominence.\n\nUnfortunately, a slew of injuries that sidelined LeBron â who was limited to a career-low 55 games â as well as several of his teammates were perhaps the biggest factors in taking the Lakers from the No. 4 seed in the West on Christmas Day to the No. 10 seed at seasonâs end (37-45).\n\nJames suffered a groin strain late in that Dec. 25 win at Golden State, and wouldnât return for roughly six weeks, as L.A.âs playoff hopes took a big hit.\n\nIn a crowded West featuring many teams that returned largely intact from the previous seasons, the Lakers were already at a continuity disadvantage. They had a group of talented young players to go with veterans primarily signed on expiring contracts, theoretically to preserve cap space for the upcoming summer, all figuring out the best way to complement LeBronâs game.\n\nInstead of improving as the season went along, the continuity suffered further when Brandon Ingram, presumed sidekick-to-LeBron, missed four games in October (suspension) and six in December (ankle) before his season ended on March 2 due to Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) in his arm that was surgically repaired on March 16. Ingram had been playing his best basketball of his career in the six games after the break, averaging 27.8 points on 57.0 percent shooting and 52.9 percent from three, plus 7.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 37.2 minutes per game.\n\nFellow No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball had just begun to find a nice offensive rhythm to couple his consistently excellent defense when he badly sprained his ankle on Jan. 19, the last time he appeared on the court. And with Josh Hart battling knee tendinitis from late December through his final game on March 19, and Ivica Zubac traded at the deadline for Mike Muscala, Kyle Kuzma was the only member of L.A.âs young core who stayed healthy through late March, when his season ended due to left foot tendinitis.\n\nBy way of impact on the teamâs record, each of those injuries were significant, although none more than James. The 15-time All-Star had appeared in95.1 percent of the 1,453 games in his 15-year career,including all 239 playoff games, so his injury was certainly not expected. Of course, the mileage on his legs after eight straight trips to the NBA Finals is certainly significant, but he does now get his first full offseason since 2005 to get his body primed for 2019-20.\n\nOverall, the Lakers ranked 22nd in the NBA* in games lost to injury (192).\n\n*According to the Smart injury database.\n\nThe offseason will be just as important for Ingram and Ball to get fully healthy, because when they shared the court with LeBron, L.A. went 15-8, good for a 65.2 percent win rate. Though itâs a smaller sample size, that 65.2 percent would have had the Lakers battling for a top four playoff spot alongside Denver (65.9), Portland (64.6) and Houston (64.6).\n\nCoach Luke Walton, who mutually parted ways with the Lakers after the season before agreeing to become Sacramentoâs head coach, emphasized effort on defense and pace on offense.\n\nThe Lakers finished the season ranked 13th in defensive efficiency; they were seventh when Ball got hurt in January, but just 23rd from that point onward. L.A. ranked 2nd in the NBA in both fastbreak points and points in the paint, and fourth in pace.\n\nThey really struggled offensively, however, ranking 23rd in efficiency, and 29th in 3-point percentage, free throw percentage and turnovers.\n\nPresident of Basketball Operations Magic Johnson â who stepped down from his role on the final day of the season â and GM Rob Pelinka tried to address the lack of shooting at the trade deadline by acquiring the aforementioned Muscala in addition to Reggie Bullock (in exchange for Svi Mykhailiuk and a second-round pick). Neither Muscala nor Bullock were able to find a real rhythm on offense, but neither were the bulk of their teammates, at least from a shooting perspective.\n\nThat included LeBron, who shot 33.9 percent from three, his second lowest percentage since 2010-11 â¦ but he was an absolute star on the court nonetheless, and led the Lakers in scoring, rebounds, assists, made threes, made free throws and minutes.\n\nJames averaged 27.4 points (+0.2 on his career average), 8.3 assists (+1.1), 8.5 rebounds (+1.1), 1.3 steals (-0.3), 0.6 blocks (-0.2), 51.1 percent FGâs (+0.6), 33.9 percent 3âs (-0.4) and 66.5 percent FTâs (-7.1). He was fifth in the NBA in scoring and third in assists, and became the only player in league history to rank in the top 10 in scoring (fourth) and assists (10th).\n\nKuzma upped his scoring from 16.1 points as a rookie to 18.7 in his second season, and saw his passing improve to 2.5 assists per game up from just 1.8. He was in a 3-point shooting slump for much of the season, hitting only 30.3 percent after shooting 36.6 percent in year one. However, he improved both his shot selection and his finishing, and still managed to up his overall FG percentage as a result.\n\nOf the several veterans on expiring contracts, JaVale McGee had moments of real success both early and late in the season, with his 12.0 points setting a career high, and rebounding and block numbers nearly matching his 2011-12 highs. Rajon Rondo was a true leader in the locker room, though his struggles on the defensive end contributed to a net rating of -8.4, second last on the team. Lance Stephenson competed consistently on both ends, and joined Rondo as two of only four Lakers to shoot over 35 percent from three, a surprise for two players who havenât always shot the ball well from three.\n\nTyson Chandler was very impactful in November after he was waived by the Suns and opted to sign with the Lakers, before nagging injuries limited his effectiveness on the court as the season went on. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope struggled for much of the season until his minutes went way up with all of the late-season injuries to his teammates, and he averaged 23.8 points per game in April (11.4 on the season).\n\nNo. 25 overall pick Moe Wagner suffered early in the season with an injury that occurred in summer league that limited his playing time, before he was able to earn some minutes late in the season. No. 39 overall selection Isaac Bonga also played sparingly, but showed flashes of potential with his unique length at the PG spot.\n\nThe teamâs relationship with their G-League squad, the South Bay Lakers, was quite fruitful once again, as two-way players Alex Caruso and Johnathan Williams were impactful towards wins especially late in the season. Caruso led the Lakers in net rating (3.3) for players earning at least 20 minutes per game. Meanwhile, late-season call-up Jemerrio Jones defended and rebounded his way to a net rating of 10.7 in his six games, albeit ones in which the Lakers were already out of the playoff race with little but pride to play for.\n\nIf thereâs a benefit from L.A.âs difficult season, itâs the resulting lottery pick â projected to be the 11th overall selection â that was certainly unexpected at the start of the season. That, the return of a rested LeBron plus the young core and an absence of financial obligations to players that arenât producing heading into the ever-important free agency period puts the Lakers in position to achieve in 2019-20 what they were unable to in 2018-19.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nThe most mentally challenging, emotional and longest season in NBA history finally culminated in a familiar place: the Los Angeles Lakers winning the title for the 17th time in franchise history.\n\nWhat an Odyssey it was for a talented, experienced group of players led by Finals MVP LeBron James and his fellow All-NBA-First-Team member Anthony Davis, before they emerged from three months in the COVID-19-pandemic-proofed Bubble outside of Orlando.\n\nOn Oct. 11, 2020, the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat 106-93 to cap a tremendous 16-5 run to the Larry O'Brien trophy that featured 4-1 gentlemen's sweeps of Portland, Houston and Denver.\n\nOct. 6, 2019 seems further than one year prior to the raising of the trophy, but that's when the team left for a preseason trip to China.\n\nDuring the unprecedented journey that ensued, the Lakers had to push through: the devastating loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna in January; the pandemic that shut the season down from March through June; and the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other victims of police violence that sparked a push for social justice, a recognition that Black Lives Matter and the pursuit of being Anti-Rascist, which for the Lakers, including the hiring of Dr. Karida Brown, the team's Director of Racial Equity and Action.\n\nThe team had to find a way to focus on basketball, and under the guiding vision of head coach Frank Vogel, they managed to take things one day at a time.\n\nAfter the preseason trip to China amidst difficult circumstances, the Lakers returned to try and get ready for the Oct. 22 opener against the Clippers. While they narrowly lost that game, the Lakers promptly ripped off a seven-game winning streak. They'd never give up first place in the West for the rest of the season.\n\nAfter a Nov. 10 loss to Toronto, L.A. won 10 straight to reach 17-2, then 24-3 after a particularly impressive set of road wins. L.A. beat Denver 105-96 on Dec. 3, then smashed Utah 121-96 the next night, before finishing off a three-game trip with a 136-113 handling of Portland.\n\nThe first losing streak of the season was from Dec. 17-25, with the Lakers losing four games, though that came after they'd played 12 of the prior 15 games on the road, and with LeBron and AD missing one game apiece.\n\nThey responded with nine wins in 10 games to reach a 33-7 mark. L.A. then won 11 of 12 games from Feb. 8 â March 8, climaxing with back-to-back home wins over the East No. 1-seeded Bucks, 113-103, and the West's No. 2-seeded Clippers, 112-103. The last game they played before the shutdown was on March 10, a loss to Brooklyn, bringing their record to 49-14, first in the West by 5.5 games.\n\nFor the next several months, the players had to work out on their own at their respective homes, aided by videos from the strength and conditioning staff, and in some cases, equipment that was dropped off. At a certain point, players were able to return to the UCLA Health Training Center for COVID-19-safe individual workouts, as the team prepped for quarantine and eventual travel to Florida to participate in three warm-up games to the eight seeding games that would count in the standings.\n\nL.A. was without starting point guard Avery Bradley, opted out of the Bubble for personal reasons after a strong two-way regular season.\n\nWith \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"Say Their Names,\" \"Vote\" and \"I Can't Breathe\" on their jerseys, the Lakers first Bubble game was against LAC, in what many thought would be a preview of the West Finals. LAL handled business with a 103-101 win to essentially lock up the No. 1 seed. They were thus able to treat the remainder of the month like preseason to get ready for Round 1, and they went 2-5 while playing an extended rotation, and limiting the minutes for LeBron and AD in particular. They were also without Rajon Rondo due to fractured thumb, and he wouldn't be back until Round 2, where he'd make a big difference.\n\nThe Lakers opened the postseason against Portland, who'd won six of their eight seeding games to get into a play-in mini tournament with Memphis, and beaten the Grizzlies to secure a matchup with the No. 1 Lakers. And in Game 1, some of the rust from the seeding games carried through on offense. According to Second Spectrum, the Lakers had the worst \"shooting luck\" of any team dating back to the 2013-14 season, scoring 46 fewer points than expected based on the quality of the shots, the players who took those shots, and the number of free throws. They missed threes. They missed layups. And yet because their defense was very good, they still had a chance to win before ultimately falling 100-93.\n\nFrom that point forward, the Lakers exerted their dominance, winning four straight games by a total of 60 points. L.A. held Portland, who averaged 123.4 points in the seeding games, to 106.0 per game. Vogel's defensive plan for Damian Lillard worked extremely well, limiting the All-Star to 24.3 points on 39.3 percent shooting, after he'd averaged 30.0 points on 43.7 percent FG's in the regular season.\n\nA different, but similarly effective game plan helped contain James Harden and the Houston Rockets in Round 2. Like Portland, Houston won Game 1, before the Lakers figured out the proper formula and won four straight games by a total of 51 points. Harden went from 34.3 regular season points to 29.4, while Russell Westbrook went from 27.2 points to just 19.8.\n\nL.A. stuck to their familiar 4-1 ways in the Western Conference Finals against Denver, with Game 3 the only loss. LeBron and AD continued to dominate efficiently on offense, while also making a huge impact on defense against Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Those two young players are terrific offensive talents, just like Harden and Westbrook, or Lillard and McCollum, but none of those players possess the two-way impact of L.A.'s stars. Davis drilled his first career playoff buzzer-beater in Game 2 with a beautiful wing 3-pointer that barely touched the net. And the Lakers also continued to get consistent play from their role players on both sides of the court, and a 117-107 Game 5 victory (LeBron had a ridiculous 38 points, 16 boards and 10 assists) sent them to the Finals.\n\nMiami matched L.A.s 12-3 record to get easily through the East, but then dropped Games 1 and 2 to the Lakers by 18 and 10 points, respectively, as the Lakers grasped control. Injuries to Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo certainly didn't help their cause. The Heat rallied to win Game 3 behind Jimmy Butler, but the Lakers answered in Game 4. Things appeared to be set up for L.A. to clinch in 5 while wearing their Black Mamba jerseys, but Miami battled to win and force Game 6, the first time the Lakers had to go past Game 5.\n\nWith Alex Caruso sliding into the starting lineup for the first time in the postseason for Game 6, the Lakers absolutely suffocated Miami with an incredible defensive effort, as they took a 64-36 halftime lead that locked up the championship.\n\nIt was a Lakers team that clicked from Day 1 through Day 365+, and there's plenty of credit to go around.\n\nVice President of Basketball Operations/GM Rob Pelinka traded for Davis in July, and then built a roster to ideally compliment Davis and LeBron. Pelinka assembled a group of mostly veteran, two-way players that embraced a collective role around the two All-Stars. He also added free agent center Dwight Howard to replace the injured DeMarcus Cousins, and eventually picked up Markieff Morris without giving anything up in February. Both played critical roles in the championship run.\n\nHired in May, Frank Vogel focused on the day-to-day work, while establishing strong relationships in the locker room with his players and staff, and developed a defense-first culture that carried through the calendar.\n\nJames and Davis couldn't have been much better, with LeBron finishing second in the MVP race, and Davis 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, both to Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, despite both having extremely strong cases for the honors. Perhaps that provided an extra bit of motivation in their pursuit of the ultimate award, and their playoff stats couldn't have been much better: LeBron: 27.6 points, 56.0% FG's, 37.0% 3's, 10.8 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.2 steals, 0.9 blocks Davis: 27.7 points, 57.1% FG's, 38.3% 3's, 9.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.4 blocks\n\nL.A.'s third-best player may have been its defense, but they had no shortage of contributions from the rest of the roster. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Danny Green combined to hit 84 3's while providing consistent perimeter defense. Caruso and Rondo were a fantastic backcourt bench duo, often finishing games with L.A.'s smaller lineup, keyed by Caruso's defensive impact, and Rondo's massive and critical uptick in production and impact from the regular season.\n\nKyle Kuzma and Morris provided steady two-way play on the wings, with Morris even starting at center to close out the Rockets, while Kuzma eschewed his typical shot attempts to focus on defense and scoring off cuts to the rim or spot-up threes. JaVale McGee and Howard protected the paint and rolled to the rim when on the court â Howard was especially impactful against Nikola Jokic and Denver â and led the cheers from the bench when Vogel went small.\n\nJared Dudley provided steady leadership from the bench, while Quinn Cook, Dion Waiters and J.R. Smith joined McGee and Howard in vocal support made more important by the lack of fans in the Bubble. Meanwhile, 19-year-old rookie Talen Horton-Tucker flashed some real talent in limited minutes, while two-way players from the G-League's South Bay Lakers, Kostas Antetokounmpo and Devontae Cacok, got invaluable experience practicing and watching film with LeBron, Rondo and Co. for the lengthy Bubble stretch.\n\nAs such, the Lakers won the title for the first time since 2010, and the first time since the 2013 passing of Dr. Jerry Buss. His daughter Jeanie, the CEO/Governor of the Lakers, graciously accepted the trophy from commissioner Adam Silver in much the same way as her father had: by thanking and praising L.A.'s opponents, and giving all the credit to the players, coaches and front office employees.\n\nThey had sacrificed so much through the longest and most unique season in NBA history, and pushed through it all to bring the Larry O'Brien trophy back to Los Angeles.\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nComing off the 17th title in franchise history, won on Oct. 11, 2020 in the NBA finals against Miami, the Lakers entered the 2020-21 season with a clear goal of defending their crown, a mission that fell victim to injuries and the resulting lack of cohesion.\n\nWith LeBron James and Anthony Davis combining to miss over half the pandemic-shortened 72-game season, L.A. wound up with the No. 7 seed, before falling 4-2 to No. 2 Phoenix in Round 1. The Lakers took home court from the Suns and led 2-1 before AD went down with a groin injury just ahead of halftime of Game 4, and Phoenix capitalized with three straight wins.\n\nItâs hard to separate the physical and mental toll the longest season in NBA history took on the Lakers, who had only 60 days between Game 6 and their first preseason game, on Dec. 11.\n\nSome might call it the Bubble Tax. Miami (0-4 to MIL) and Boston (1-4 to BKN), the two Eastern Conference finalists in the Bubble, both lost in Round 1 in 2021, while LALâs 2020 WCF opponent, Denver, managed to beat a banged up Portland team in Round 1 before being swept by Phoenix in Round 2.\n\nInjuries happen to every NBA team, every season, but when those injuries are to star players like LeBron James and AD, they come to define the season. On Media Day leading into the season, Davis hinted at the difficulty of the short offseason, especially for him and LeBron.\n\nâBoth of us, we want to play, but it is a quick turnaround,â he said, days after signing a maximum extension with the Lakers. âWe have to make sure weâre able to have our bodies healthy enough to make sure we can repeat â¦ hopefully it all ends well where weâre able to get our rest but still get out there and compete.â\n\nWhen the season started, the Lakers were in a better rhythm than most teams, which was the positive side of the shortened offseason. By February 14, they were 21-6, second only to Utahâs 21-5 at that point, for the NBAâs best record. They found ways to win games even when they didnât play well, like during a 5-0 home winning streak in which they went to OT three straight times. Offseason acquisitions Dennis Schroder and Montrezl Harrell offered new energy and were more than carrying their weight, while Marc Gasol was fitting nicely into the starting lineup, providing spacing at the five spot that was absent the previous year.\n\nHowever, Feb. 14 was also when Davis injured his calf/Achilles area against Denver, on the same leg where some issues kept him out the previous week. He wouldnât return until April 22, and the All-NBA First Teamer started only 36 of 72 games.\n\nCompounding ADâs absence, Schroder missed four straight games between Feb. 16-26 due to the NBAâs health and safety protocols, and L.A. lost all four. Gasol then missed most of the month of March due to protocols, leaving LeBron James with a constantly rotating cast of teammates.\n\nAnd yet, LeBron led the Lakers to a 4-0 start out of the All-Star break, bringing their record to 28-13, LAL still in good position for home court advantage in the first round, and with Davis nearing a return. Still just 20, 2nd-year guard Talen Horton-Tucker continued to flash his potential, posting individual highs of 26 points and 11 assists in different games to help shoulder some of the burden. But then, on March 20, Atlantaâs Solomon Hill crashed recklessly into LeBronâs ankle, resulting in a high ankle sprain that kept LeBron out of all but four regular season games, and less than 100 percent for the Suns series.\n\nWith all the absences, Andre Drummond â acquired at the trade deadline after he agreed to a buyout with Cleveland â had very few games to integrate into a lineup with both LeBron and AD. Meanwhile, most of the Lakers that had played the full length of the Bubble â Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris â all dealt with varying nagging injuries.\n\nSo, despite closing the season with five straight wins to finish 42-30, the Lakers drew Phoenix, the NBAâs healthiest team in the regular season. Indeed, Chris Paul played 70 games for Phoenix, and Devin Booker 67, while Mikal Bridges didnât miss a game, and Deandre Ayton started the first 69 until resting for the final three ahead of Round 1.\n\nIt was the presence of Davis that Phoenix couldnât handle in Games 2 and 3, as he went for 34 points in each win, before the injury in Game 4 tilted the balance of the series.\n\nâGame 4, we had supreme confidence that we had taken control of the series,â said Coach Frank Vogel. âThen Anthony goes down, and I think there was a bigger deflating effect.â\n\nCredit has to go to the Suns, who played excellent basketball. And yet, LAL are left to think what might have happened were they to have had a traditional offseason, even while accepting the necessary business elements that had to come first.\n\nâIt was different,â said Davis. âAll around the league, guyâs bodies didnât handle that very well â¦ but now we have the opportunity to take advantage of this longer offseason â¦ to prepare for next season â¦ I think health played a big part in why weâre in the position weâre in. We just wasnât healthy. We were very healthy last year. Not this year.â\n\nâIt was a bit of a struggle, added Caruso. âKCP playing on one leg. AD couldnât go. That was just kind of the storyline of the year, taking away from the potential that this team had.â\n\nAll in all, the Lakers missed 94 games to rotation players with injuries, including 73 to starters, plus 23 games due to NBA health and safety protocols.\n\nThe injuries also made it difficult for the players to develop cohesion with one another on the floor.\n\nâA lot of that is repetitions that we couldnât have,â explained Wesley Matthews. âLive practice situations that we couldnât do. Condensed season, with travel, which doesnât leave you much time to practice, go hard and compete in practice, and play so that you can see those live looks because you have to preserve your legs (for games). So with lineups changes, superstars are in and out of the lineups, games were almost practices for us. We played I donât know how many rotations that were on the court for the first time.â\n\nEven with all the missed time, LeBron still earned a spot on the All-NBA Second Team, his record 17th All-NBA appearance (13 First Teams). He was the leading MVP candidate before his injury, continuing to refuse to show any signs of showing down in his 18th NBA season, at age 36.\n\nIn averaging 25.0 points per game to lead the Lakers, LeBron secured his 17th consecutive season, adding to his standing NBA record, with the next closest players reaching 12 seasons (Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant and Karl Malone). LeBron closed the gap on Malone for second on the All-Time scoring list (36,928 to 35,367). And, oh yeah, he also ranks 8th on the NBAâs All-Time assist list after leading LAL with 7.8 per game, trailing No. 7 Oscar Robertson 9,887 to 9,696, with Magic Johnson (10,141) also in view.\n\nDrummondâs 10.2 boards per game led the way in his 21 appearances, while AD led the team in blocks (1.64) and steals (1.25), with KCP tossing in the 10th best 3-point percentage season in franchise history (41.0 percent). KCP also ranks 5th on LALâs all-time 3-point FGâs made list (522), with teammate Kyle Kuzma currently ranking 6th (510).\n\nAD, Caruso*, KCP and Schroder all received All-Defensive Team votes in recognition of the team that finished the year ranked No. 1 in defensive efficiency despite all of the injury absences, and Frank Vogel deserves considerable credit for that.\n\n*Caruso finished third in the NBA in defensive rating.\n\nVogel was able to keep whatever players were on the floor in their defensive shape, and draw out the type of energy it takes to be good on that end most every night, but the offense struggled without LeBron most of all, and certainly AD as well. The Lakers finished the season ranked 24th on that end.\n\nNow, hereâs the good news for the Lakers: they have a full offseason to get their bodies back on track for the 2021-22 season. After a 71-day offseason last year, theyâll get all of June, July, August and September to get right mentally and physically before training camp starts in October.\n\nAnd then, once again, the goal of a team built around LeBron and AD will be simple, in Rob Pelinkaâs words: âWe have an insatiable desire to bring banner No. 18 here.â\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nWith the stated preseason goal of winning a championship, the 2021-22 Lakers finished with just 33 wins, to 49 losses, ultimately failing to qualify for a play-in berth, let alone the playoffs. Undoubtedly, it was a very disappointing campaign for all involved.\n\nLakers VP of Basketball Operations Rob Pelinka summarized things prior to Mondayâs exit interviews at the UCLA Health Training Center.\n\nThe day after the season concluded with an OT win at Denver, the organization announced that Frank Vogelâs tenure as the teamâs head coach â which included the 2020 NBA championship in his first season â had come to an end.\n\nâWe expressed gratitude for the three years of being able to work together,â said Pelinka at his exit interview on Monday, April 11. âItâs a point in the Lakers history where we felt like it was time for a change in our leadership voice. Those are difficult things to do.\n\nâThis is an inflection point where he goes from being the leader of the Lakers to part of our legacy, and especially our championship legacy.â\n\nOne of the most difficult things Vogel had to deal with throughout the 2021-22 season was a lack of health, which led to a franchise-high 41 different starting lineups on the season. Even more damaging was who was missing: LeBron James and Anthony Davis were out for a combined 68 games. Potential starter, or at worst, sixth-man-to-be Kendrick Nunn missed the entire season, and several other key role players missed action, as Trevor Ariza and Talen Horton-Tucker both had early-season surgeries.\n\nâForty one starting lineups ... wow,â said LeBron. âItâs just, you never get an opportunity to see what the ball club could have been. Definitely frustrating, for sure.â\n\nRegardless of health, the team just didnât play well enough on either side of the basketball. They finished 22nd in offensive efficiency, and 21st in defensive efficiency, after Vogel had led them to No. 1 in defense in 2020-21, and No. 3 in 2019-20.\n\nâObviously it wasnât a successful season by any means, from top to bottom,â said Russell Westbrook, who joined the Lakers in a trade that sent Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell plus a first-round pick to Washington last summer. âThere are so many different things you can point to â¦ Iâm big on putting a ton of pressure on myself coming into any situation. Just my play in general, not my best season â¦ I know a lot of people outside of here have their own expectations, but for me personally, I put myself on a very high scale, and Iâm not happy (with how I played).â\n\nL.A. failed to build the type of chemistry that seemed almost instantaneous when Davis joined LeBron in 2019-20. That team started 24-3, despite little carryover from the previous season. This yearâs edition never got more than three games over .500, at 16-13, when undrafted rookie â and major bright spot â Austin Reaves hit a buzzer-beating three at Dallas. The next game, at Minnesota, Davis suffered a knee sprain that would keep him out for over a month, right around the time where most of the team would miss games due to the NBA's health and safety protocols. From that point moving forward, Davis and LeBron would play only seven more games together.\n\nHealth provided, Davis does believe that he and LeBron can still anchor a championship team.\n\nâWeâve shown that we can,â said Davis. âI donât know thatâs something we just have to reevaluate in the offseason, upstairs, me and him talking about this season and what we would like to see next season and kind of just figure it out. Guys like to decompress and just kind of take time to think about themselves and look in the mirror and evaluate themselves and then come together as a group and just figuring out whatâs best for the team to get back to championship mentality that we had our first year. So that would be a very interesting conversation just from the standpoint of what changed.\n\nâI mean, injuries, but even when we were healthy we, I donât think we were able to reach our full potential. For whatever reason. So I think we want to figure it out and just get back to that championship pedigree that us as players know weâre capable of and like Iâve said the organization.â\n\nThat 2019-20 model â and 2020-21 to a similar extent â was built more upon athletic, two-way role players supporting LeBron and AD, where as the 2021-22 version had more primary ballhandlers, less size and less versatility.\n\nâOur roster did not work,â said Pelinka. âWe did not have the season that our fans expect â¦ we have to fix those things, and one of the things weâve done and will do as we look to hire a new coach is to include that coach in the process of how to make a roster work together.â\n\nL.A. did see several bright spots from young players throughout the season, headlined by a terrific debut from Reaves, who was nabbed by the scouting department and developed by the coaching staff from the start of summer league play. Malik Monk overproduced on a minimum contract with an efficient offensive season at all three levels. Talen Horton-Tucker had moments of on-ball dominance amidst an adjustment to a different, off-ball role, and free agent pickups Stanley Johnson and Wenyen Gabriel made meaningful contributions with their athleticism and energy.\n\nLeBron impressively averaged 30.3 points per game, the second highest of his 19-year career, and he did so efficiently, shooting 52.4 percent from the field (career average: 50.5 percent). He set a new high in threeâs made per game (2.9) and took advantage of an often-vacant paint due to small Laker lineups by consistently ranking among league leaders in points at the rim, even if those lineups often left L.A. more vulnerable on defense especially in ADâs absence. It was the first time in LeBronâs career where he played significant minutes at center.\n\nâ(Position) doesnât matter for me personally,â said LeBron. âMy personal goal was to be able to play any position on the floor. Every game is different. Matchup is different at times. So, to be able to have the availability to our team that I can switch off and play center for minutes or play point guard for minutes or play the wing spot for minutes according to what the game dictates or needs, thatâs for me to make sure that Iâm equipped and in the best possible shape I can be in to help us win ballgames.â\n\nDavis put up his usually impressive numbers, averaging 23.2 points, 9.9 boards, 3.1 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.2 steals, but had one player fall into his leg (Minnesotaâs Jaden McDaniels on Dec. 17), and landed upon the foot of another (Utahâs Rudy Gobert on Feb. 16), limiting him to 40 games played.\n\nHow to best fill a roster around AD and LeBron will be ironed out by the front office in the coming weeks.\n\nâI mean, itâs human nature to automatically to start thinking about the roster and what it could look like and how we could obviously have a roster that brings in more wins,â said LeBron. âThatâs the most important thing. Thatâs the job that weâre in. So, Iâll start to think about it a little bit. But itâs not sorely on me, obviously, but we definitely want to be better. We want to be better coming into next year. Thatâs the most important thing for this summer.â\n\n\"He feels highly motivated to return next year and have another elite (season),â added Pelinka. âFor him to play that way in Year 19 (2021-22) is jaw dropping â¦ Every indication that weâve received is he sees the Lakers as his home.â\n\nItâs only been 18 months since the Lakers won the 2020 title, and rediscovering some of the chemistry that was so electric for that team, and really, most title teams, will be important. If not easy.\n\nâBasketball chemistry can be an elusive concept,â explained Pelinka. âYou donât always know if itâs going to be there, or not, until you get a chance to see if players gel together. There are so many factors â¦ injuries to star players â¦ we also signed a point guard that we didnât get a single game out of in Kendrick Nunn. But weâre in a results business, a wins and loss business. Weâre not in an excuse business.â\n\nâI do think a chemistry of players that are willing to work hard together and make the sacrifices needed to compete every night at a high level is a north star, and a barometer,â Pelinka concluded. âBut the calculus for Lakers success is pretty binary. Either we win a championship, or we donât. There are no gold stars for the in between. This year, we failed in that mission. Thatâs the way we look at things here. To get into a position where we can be a team that competes next year at that level to try and bring our fans the 18th title is going to take a focus on making sure that the chemistry of the team is healthy and that weâre growing together throughout the course of a season.â\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nThe 2022-23 Lakers season, in some ways, had two seasons within one:\n\n1) A difficult, injury-plagued slog prior to the trade deadline that produced a 25-31 record.\n\n2) An impressive push to the regular season finish line (43-39) to secure the No. 7 seed and subsequent playoff series defeats of Memphis (No. 2) and Golden State (No. 6) before an eventual loss to Denver (No. 1) in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThough both Lakers stars, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, missed significant regular-season time due to respective foot injuries, they did begin and end the season in the starting lineup. What changed at the deadline was their supporting cast.\n\nThe season began with an 0-5 struggle, before the Lakers got their first two wins of the season against Denver and then New Orleans, before another 0-5 stretch dropped them to 2-10. A lack of continuity both in coaching staff â new head coach Darvin Ham brought with him a mostly-new group â and on the roster was evident, as the fit of Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley in the starting group never quite worked.\n\nThe first of many injuries to make that process harder came as LeBron suffered a strained left adductor on Nov. 9, a loss to LAC. But thatâs when Anthony Davis began a 10-game tear in which he averaged 35.3 points on 64.8 percent field goals, plus 15.6 boards and 2.90 blocks to lead the Lakers to an 8-2 record in their next 10 games.\n\nAmidst that run, Dennis SchrÃ¶der and Thomas Bryant both returned from preseason thumb injuries, and provided a collective spark off the bench to stabilize a rotation that had been going deeper than was ideal. Meanwhile, Davis exploded for 44 points and 10 boards, with LeBron James adding 28 points and 11 assists, enough to outduel Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in Milwaukee. AD was even better the next game against the Wizards, dropping in 55 points alongside 17 rebounds as the Lakers coasted to a 130-119 victory, improving to 10-12 on the season.\n\nBut Davis then missed two of the next three games, and some difficult-to-take losses followed in Philly (LAL missed key free throws in the final seconds) and Boston (LAL led by 13 with four minutes left). Davis then hurt his foot in a home win against Denver on Dec. 16, with LAL 12-16; heâd miss the next five-and-a-half weeks of the season.\n\nJust as Davis had stepped up in LeBronâs absence, the King returned the favor until Davis returned on Jan. 25, carrying the Lakers to a 10-10 mark without AD, an impressive feat highlighted by his scoring 47 points in Atlanta on his 38th birthday. That preceded a four-game winning streak including a tough road win at Sacramento on the second night of a B2B.\n\nDavis led the Lakers in scoring (21) and rebounding (12) while blocking four shots, keying a 113-104 win over SAS in his return. But in the next game, at Boston, an obvious shooting foul on Jayson Tatum was missed â the NBA later ruled that a foul should have been fouled as Tatum clearly hit LeBronâs arm on a layup attempt â just ahead of the buzzer in a game L.A. lost in OT, their fourth OT loss to that point.\n\nAmidst the challenging season, LeBron was also steadily pursuing Kareem Abdul-Jabbarâs all-time scoring mark, which he ultimately broke on Feb. 7 vs. OKC. Then with LeBron nursing an ankle/foot injury and missing the next three games, L.A. went into the All-Star break at 27-32.\n\nHowever, they also changed their season in that period in a major way, with a bevy of moves around the trade deadline. First came the acquisition of Rui Hachimura from Washington for Kendrick Nunn and second round picks. Then came the acquisition of DâAngelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt and Malik Beasley in a three-team trade with Minnesota and Utah, with Russell Westbrook and draft compensation going to Utah (a protected first) and Minnesota (a second), and Mike Conley from the Jazz to the Wolves. L.A. also acquired Mo Bamba from Orlando, Davon Reed from Denver, and two second round picks from the Clippers, with Thomas Bryant going to the Nuggets and Patrick Beverley and cash going to Orlando.\n\nSince that roster remake, the Lakers would go on to win eight of their next 11 games, vaulting from 13th in the Western Conference to a three-way tie for ninth at 33-34, just one games back of the No. 7 seed. That run came in spite of another injury to LeBron, who tore a tendon in his foot in an OT win at Dallas on Feb. 26; but Davis kept the Lakers afloat, "
