        "text": "A thought occurred to me as I watched the disastrous game the 76ers played Wednesday night against the previously winless Detroit Pistons.\n\nIf Jerry Buss owned the Sixers instead of the Los Angeles Lakers, would he have fired coach Doug Collins after the game?\n\nAfter all, the teams do have many similarities in how they started off the NBA season. Both have gotten off to slow starts as the players learn how to play with each other. Injuries also play a factor. Neither team has been at full strength.\n\nBoth the Lakers and Sixers also had coaches with very strong credentials. Lakers coach Mike Brown had won 60 games twice and made the NBA finals.\n\nYet when the teams did not play well out of the starting gate, Los Angeles' and Philadelphia's organizations had completely different reactions.\n\nThe Lakers fired Brown after five games.\n\nThe Sixers?\n\nWell, no one thinks Collins’ job is in any danger –and it shouldn’t be – and he has the true full confidence of management, not the phony ‘vote of confidence’ Brown was given the day before he was fired.\n\nBrown in those five games did not have a completely healthy Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard or Steve Nash. But the Lakers were not going to wait to see how Brown would mesh the team once he had all the parts.\n\nThe Sixers, of course, are just trying to do as well as possible until center Andrew Bynum is ready to play. But the team has also have been without its only other true big man, Kwame Brown, and its starting shooting guard Jason Richardson, due to injuries for half its games.\n\nThe Sixers started the season 4-4 with three of those four losses by blowout. In the other defeat, to Milwaukee by eight, the team trailed by double digits most of the time. Brown did not get beat so badly before he was axed.\n\nBut this is not L.A. and the Sixers do not have a star who is 34 years old and they were not picked by everyone to make the NBA finals.\n\nSo while the Lakers pushed the panic button, the Sixers are using patience. Do not forget the NBA season lasts freakin’ forever. Heck, if Bynum comes back in January, which right now is the worst-case-scenario, he still has two-thirds of the regular season to play.\n\nSo while it might not be fun to watch a team shoot 29 percent or act like a rebounding basketball is some strange foreign object, the Sixers brass has given Collins its full support that he will make it work.\n\nAnd the owner having the coach’s back is very important. When a player knows it'd be a choice between him and the coach, and the coach will win, he acts differently.\n\nThe Celtics won nine NBA titles in 11 years under Red Auerbach. Besides being the coach, he was also the general manager and basically ran the whole operation. If you didn’t like the way Auerbach was doing things, a player had no one to complain to so he had to do it Auerbach’s way.\n\nOwners do cave in to star players’ demands but, in the end, all it does is have the player lose respect for the franchise.\n\nDwight Howard wanted Stan Van Gundy gone as coach in Orlando last year. Ownership acquiesced and fired him. Howard still demanded a trade. LeBron James basically got anything he wanted at Cleveland. It did not help them keep him.\n\nA different sport, but many say the reason the Phillies won the World Series in 1980 under manager Dallas Green was because Green was supposed to eventually take over as general manager. Causing a ruckus over Green’s tough managing style was not going to get a player anywhere except traded or released. So they did what he wanted and finally won a World Series.\n\nPlayers know 76ers managing owner Joshua Harris has complete confidence in Collins. Unless they would enjoy going to Charlotte and losing 60 games, I expect improved play from the Sixers in the future.\n\nStuart London is a confirmed Hoopaholic.
