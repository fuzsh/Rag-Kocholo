        "text": "Sexual assault charges against Los Angeles Lakers center Kwame Brown were rejected because of a lack of physical evidence, prosecutors said today.\n\nAllegations of the assault were first reported in April by a 23-year-old student from California State University, Long Beach.\n\nSince then, a medical exam of the young woman was reviewed and “revealed no signs of forcible sexual assault,” according to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office.\n\nIn addition, Brown’s attorney would not allow him to be interviewed by police, prosecutors said. The case could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because the case is a “one-on-one” allegation.\n\nThe woman “admits engaging in some consensual activity with the suspect prior to the assault,” prosecutors wrote in a prepared statement.\n\n“She remained in the suspect’s home for several hours following the assault. No forensic evidence was found to corroborate her report.”\n\nBrown, 24, was the first high school player ever chosen with the first overall pick of the NBA draft. The 6-foot-11, 243-pound athlete played his first four NBA seasons with the Washington Wizards and was traded to the Lakers last Aug. 2."
