        "text": "I’ve heard that the Phoenix Suns will adjust to the suspensions of Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw with a very small starting line-up (Nash, Bell, Barbosa, Ja. Jones, and Marion) for Game 5. I think this would be disastrous for a number of reasons and feel they should use some of their bigger players (Thomas and Rose) instead. Bench Scoring: If the best sixth man in the Association starts, Phoenix will not have any players remaining to provide a scoring lift off the bench. I’ve always felt that Leandro Barbosa is most effective as a reserve, although he has started …\n\nIt is not the end of the Phoenix Suns’ world if Amare Stoudemire is suspended for Game 5 of the Conference Semi-Finals. The actions of Bruce Bowen and others that the Association Head Office has permitted during the first four games of the series should provide some context to any suspensions assessed as a result of Robert Horry body checking Steve Nash into the scorer’s table and the subsequent melee. Suspending Stat for leaving the bench during an altercation would be neither consistent with restorative justice nor crippling to Phoenix’s chances to beat San Antonio. First of all, the Suns …\n\nThe Association Playoffs have provided a number of interesting moments regarding how decision-making, self-actualization, creativity, and aggressiveness come to the surface on the basketball court and in life. First of all, ESPN Page 2 is entirely correct to congratulate “the Golden State Warriors for making us watch the N.B.A. again.” The Warriors – led by Baron Davis and playing with a five-second shot clock – provided one of the few surprising moments in an Association that had been mundane and predictable for the past eight or nine years. As Bill Simmons wrote, at least Golden State took chances. A number …\n\n“I think back to the people who would drop by my office and say, ‘keep your head up’ when you’re feeling down. Publicly, when I was out and about, I kept my head up, you’re never going to show people that you’re struggling with things on the inside, but when you’re sitting in your office by yourself and you’ve lost three or four in a row and people come by and say kind words, you remember those times.”– Sam Mitchell The Toronto Raptors bested the New Jersey Nets 89-83 in Game 2 of a first-round series and Sam Mitchell claimed …\n\nIrrespective of Kobe Bryant’s scoring average, the Los Angeles Lakers are in deep trouble because the team offence is completely gridlocked. The Triangle will not work without post entries and dribble penetration, which are two techniques that the Lakers are not currently practicing. The Lakers must establish themselves in those areas for the following reasons: It will create opportunities for Luke Walton, Andrew Bynum, Brian Cook, and the rest of the bench to contribute that are not available in the current man-to-man offence. If the entire team is a threat to score, opponents cannot collapse on Kobe and Lamar Odom. …\n\nCongratulations to the Raptors and their Association playoff berth. After Andrea Bargnani’s appendicitis, Jorge Garbajosa’s broken leg, and an underwhelming performance versus Kevin Durant’s next team, the Boston Celtics, Toronto regrouped and won the next two games, clinching a playoff berth. Many players shouldered the load and the team executed well under the pressure caused by the recent adversity. Michael Ruffin, on the other hand, did not execute well under pressure. On Friday, Washington was leading by three points with seconds remaining. After Ruffin intercepted a sixty-foot pass by Anthony Parker, he simply needed to dribble out the clock and …\n\nDifferent coaches have different personalities, which contribute to the diversity of sport. Some display more energy than others, some have a stage presence, and some have a sense of humour about their job. Nevertheless, there is more than one way to coach successfully. Coaching and control are synonymous in the minds of many individuals inside and outside the profession but that is not an accurate description. Coaches motivate student-athletes to reach their potential as a group. Crafting systems that best suit the team is part of that task, managing every single detail of the team is not. Creating accountability among …\n\nAlthough nothing could top Charles Barkley outracing Dick Bavetta, I thought that there were other interesting moments during the Association All-Star weekend worth noting: Dwight Howard took advantage of opportunities during Sunday’s game and Saturday’s dunk contest to make a name for himself. Howard’s athleticism and power are possibly beyond peer in the Association. Nevertheless, the weekend’s results highlight that there is still room for improvement for the top pick in the 2004 draft. If Howard acquires post moves – on the block and elbow – and a greater range for his jumper than he will truly become unstoppable. Even …\n\n“How can you give up a wide open three followed by an offensive rebound on the other side of the court?”– Bill Walton, during the Spurs-Rockets game on 24 January 2007 Team defence is getting worse and worse in the Association and beyond. Conversely it seems like the screen and roll play is getting better and better. Inbounding under their basket with few seconds remaining on the shot clock, the Spurs set a double screen for Ginobli on the foul line. Ginobli curled the screen, received a pass, and made the lay-up. Earlier in the evening, Marion set a ballscreen …\n\nTorn regarding the Raptors. Villanueva for Ford helps significantly in theory. Creates a direction for the team that could result in fifty wins in the Eastern Conference. On the other hand: Trade has about a 20-50% chance of backfiring horribly due to the relative health and shooting ability of Villaneuva and Ford. Skeptical of a deal that inspires sixty percent of Bucks fans to vote “I love it!” in an online poll. It could work out well and set the tone for Toronto’s resurgence. Think that the trade is more likely to succeed than not but less enthusiastic than other …\n\nMatt Bonner is not especially outstanding but he can shoot the three and defend inside, two commodities that are scarce in the Association. Will he play much for San Antonio? If Bonner’s shooting well, he’s another target for Tim Duncan to pass to out of the double team. I think he’s too limited offensively (off the bounce) and defensively (against quicker 4s) compared to the current Spurs line-up. If it’s true that Gregg Popovich wants to play a smaller line-up, this trade is an excellent start; Big Shot Rob can’t last forever. Isiah Thomas got his wish and Larry Brown …\n\nAt some point, athletes and teams need to make a stand. What represents all of the sacrifice and toil that got you to this point? Whatever it is, that is what you must work the hardest to defend. Is it the off-season where you will take your skill set to the next level and really hit the weight room hard that represents your desire to win? Is it the goal-line stand that represents all the parties that you skipped during the season because you had practice scheduled the next morning? Is it Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals that …\n\nThe Suns took the Lakers apart in Game 7 of the first round series. PHX is a shallow team but make us of about seven contributors. Los Angeles is a one player team. Bill Simmons wrote that all Kobe-Jordan comparisons should cease if Kobe didn’t destroy Raja Bell in the deciding game. Simmons is right: MJ would have dropped forty-eight points after the game 5 clothesline and post game comments. Michael Jordan always came through when the season was on the line As for the rest of the Lakers, some played as if they were not aware of 2002-03’s rule …\n\nPhoenix: Kobe Bryant and Lamar Odom shot the Los Angeles back into their series with Phoenix (29 and 21 points respectively). The Suns have to respond in Game 3 and need better performances from their forwards to do so. The Lakers don’t have anyone who can guard Tim Thomas, Shawn Marion, or Boris Diaw, who must put up more than about ten points of 5 for 10 shooting each. Steve Nash needs more help. Furthermore, Phoenix can’t play any defence and will have trouble winning games in this series if they don’t score triple digits. Detroit: I don’t feel that …\n\nAccording to Mark Stein, Phil Jackson chose to downplay Kobe’s offensive role in Game 1 of the Phoenix-Los Angeles series in order to allow other Lakers to score more – at the risk of losing the game – therefore increasing individuals’ feelings of self-actualisation and the team’s chance to win the series. Interesting idea. Kwame Brown, Lamar Odom, and Luke Walton went off and the Lakers lost the game. Since the supporting cast played well, does that mean that L.A. is now more likely to win four out of the next six games? Perhaps, but I think it was an …\n\nThe Toronto Raptors are a frustrating team to watch. After overcoming a double-digit deficit to claw within a single point of near the end of the third quarter, the bottom fell out. Missing dunks, conceding open threes, taking early shots, not getting back in transition, leaving posts wide open — offence and defence were both disastrous. The Suns torched the Raptors with the high rub. They’d slip the screen or roll directly to the basket and get dunks and lay-ups, using a cute baseline back-screen to occupy the help defenders. Lesson #1 for Sam Mitchell: If 5-10 Andre Barrett plays …"
