        "text": "VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) - Los Angeles Lakers center Kwame Brown faces misdemeanor charges in south Georgia following a weekend incident in which his cousin was charged with driving under the influence.\n\nValdosta Police Department Lieutenant Bobbi McGraw says police pulled over Charles Warren Junior early Saturday morning for driving the wrong way down a one-way street. McGraw says officers began questioning Warren about the strong smell of alcohol in his vehicle. McGraw says Brown, a former Glynnn Academy star, approached the officers and told them he was Warren's cousin and that the vehicle belonged to the basketball player. McGraw says Brown became disruptive and tried to interfere with the officers' investigation, which led to his arrest.\n\nPolice charged Brown, a former WTOC Player of the Year, with disorderly conduct and inferring with an officer after his cousin was charged with DUI. The 25-year-old Brown was released shortly after his arrest. McGraw says jail officials had no record of how much he paid in bond.\n\nLakers officials told the Los Angeles Times they are aware of the charges but declined to comment further. Brown, the top draft pick in 2001, was accused of sexual assault in May 2006 by a college student, but prosecutors rejected the case because of a lack of evidence."
