        "text": "PRO BASKETBALL\n\nPistons officially sign ex-No. 1 pick Brown\n\nThe Detroit Pistons signed free-agent center Kwame Brown, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft.\n\nThe team announced the signing Monday.\n\nTeam president for basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press last week that Brown will be paid $4 million next season. Brown has an option for a second season for another $4 million.\n\nThe 26-year-old has career averages of 7.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 23.7 minutes in 404 NBA games. He averaged a career-high 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds during the 2003-04 season as a member of the Washington Wizards, who drafted him No. 1 overall out of high school.\n\nBrown also has played for the Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAlso: The Cleveland Cavaliers, looking to add backcourt depth, signed former Memphis Grizzlies guard Tarence Kinsey.\n\nKinsey split last season between Memphis and Fenerbahce Ulker Istanbul in the Turkish league. In his second season with Memphis, he averaged 3.6 points and 8.7 minutes in 11 games. In Turkey, the 6-foot-6-inch Kinsey averaged 9.2 points in 14 games.\n\nPhiladelphia re-signed guard Louis Williams, keeping a key member of the 76ers' first playoff team in three years.\n\nThe deal was reportedly worth more than $25 million over five years.\n\nWilliams, a restricted free agent, averaged 11.5 points in 23 minutes per game last season.\n\nPoint guard Carlos Arroyo, who spent the last two seasons with the Orlando Magic, has become the latest NBA player to bolt overseas, signing with an Israeli team.\n\nThe 29-year-old Arroyo signed a one-year deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nGeorgia coach Richt suspends linebacker\n\nHigh expectations for Georgia were overshadowed by off-field troubles as the Bulldogs held their first practice.\n\nCoach Mark Richt fielded questions from reporters for about 45 minutes, most of them about players being arrested, dismissed or suspended since Georgia finished last season with a dominant victory over Hawaii in the Sugar Bowl.\n\n\"The reputation of this team has been damaged, no question,\" Richt said. \"I don't think it's beyond repair, and I don't think the reputation has been ruined, but certainly it has taken some hits.\"\n\nOn Monday, Richt announced backup linebacker Darius Dewberry was suspended for the first two games of the season, making him the sixth player to be suspended or dismissed from the team in the offseason.\n\nOn Saturday night, Richt announced the indefinite suspensions of two players -- snapper Jeff Henson, following his second alcohol-related arrest, and safety Donavon Baldwin, who needed stitches after he was injured in a fight early Saturday.\n\nThe 236-pound Dewberry went to St. Mary's Hospital to check on Baldwin and another teammate, linebacker Marcus Dowtin, after both suffered cuts when hit with beer bottles at a fight in an Athens bar.\n\nDewberry broke a barrier on a control arm at the parking lot -- with his hands, not his car -- and also broke four plant pots.\n\nAlso: Kentucky cornerback Paul Warford has been ruled ineligible for the 2008 season, costing the Wildcats a returning starter.\n\nWarford started 11 games last season, with 41 tackles and two interceptions. The junior from Richmond, Ky., will not be enrolled during the fall semester and will be redshirted by the team. He could return to school in January and be back on the field in 2009.\n\nWisconsin running back Lance Smith was dismissed from the team, a month after he was expelled from a first-offenders program for failing to meet its requirements.\n\nCoach Bret Bielema, who suspended Smith last month, announced the dismissal after the team's first practice of the season.\n\nSmith was placed in the program last October after a judge accepted Smith's guilty pleas to charges of battery and disorderly conduct. The charges stemmed from an altercation between Smith and his girlfriend in July 2007.\n\nNew coach Bo Pelini opened Nebraska's media day by announcing that defensive lineman Kevin Dixon has been kicked off the team for an undisclosed violation of rules.\n\nDixon, who had four starts and played in all 12 games last year, was ticketed twice by university police in July, once for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.\n\nLongtime Notre Dame assistant coach Joe Yonto, who worked under Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and Lou Holtz, died in South Bend, Ind. He was 83.\n\nA university spokesman confirmed Yonto's death but had no details on the cause.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nPrado, Nafzger inducted into horse racing hall\n\nJockey Edgar Prado and trainer Carl Nafzger, who between them have three Kentucky Derby wins, led a group of six inductees into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\n\nInducted with Prado and Nafzger were retired jockey Ismael Valenzuela and three horses: Manila, Inside Information and Ancient Title.\n\nPrado, 41, is best known for having ridden the ill-fated 2006 Kentucky Derby winner, Barbaro. He was also aboard when Barbaro broke down two weeks later in the Preakness. The horse ultimately had to be destroyed as a result of the injuries.\n\nA native of Lima, Peru, he led the nation in victories from 1997-99 while based in Maryland. Since relocating to New York, he has been among the earnings leaders and has added dozens of graded stakes wins, including two Belmont Stakes, aboard Sarava in 2002 and Birdstone in 2004. Birdstone also captured the Travers Stakes that year. Prado won the Eclipse Award as the champion jockey of 2006.\n\nNafzger, 66, a top bull rider in the 1960s before turning to training, was inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame earlier this year. He won the Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic with Unbridled in 1990 and won his second Derby with Street Sense in 2007.\n\nAlso: NCAA player of the year Amanda Blumenherst shot a 6-under 66 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship in Eugene, Ore.\n\nAlison Walshe, of Westford, Mass., shot a 4-under 68. Australian Stephanie Na and Canadian Stephanie Sherlock are three shots back entering today's final round of stroke play.\n\nThe field of 156 will be cut to 64 for five rounds of match play beginning Wednesday.\n\nThe UNLV volleyball team was picked to finish fifth in the Mountain West Conference preseason poll, as voted on by the league's coaches and selected media. Colorado State, the 2007 regular-season champion, was picked to repeat this season.\n\nTennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt will donate $600,000 to the school, to be shared by the Knoxville and Martin campuses.\n\nThe donation will be given over several years to support the women's basketball programs at both campuses and includes a $100,000 endowed scholarship for a Lady Vols basketball graduate assistant in honor of Summitt's parents, Richard and Hazel Head."
