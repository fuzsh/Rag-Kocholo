        "text": "It has been well documented that the Lakers obtained Pau Gasol through thievery. Not only did they get the former All-Star, but in the process, they got rid of Kwame Brown.\n\nBrown actually had a desirable “expiring contract,” as well as an undesirable expiring career. The Lakers’ trade turned out to be so spectacularly one-sided that newbie Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace was gun shy with trading Mike Miller, a player unnecessary for a rebuilding team, because of potential criticism that he might get in any deal with him.\n\nSo Miller stayed in Memphis after the trading deadline, and that was one deadline surprise as was Cleveland, Chicago and Seattle engineering a mammoth, 11-player deal with no clear winners except possibly the Super- Sonics, as they continue to shed their overpaid players.\n\nThe following is a breakdown of some of the wheelers and dealers this season, but no matter what has happened in the past two months, the Lakers’ Mitch Kupchak and all the other GMs still are long shots for the league’s executive of the year award.\n\nCeltics GM Danny Ainge is destined to snag that honor. His unprecedented 7-for-1 deal for Kevin Garnett coupled with his acquisition of Ray Allen for, in essence, the No. 5 pick, Jeff Green, still overrides the Gasol theft.\n\nBut maybe not the Brown giveaway.\n\nThe Winners\n\nLakers: Gasol’s a keeper. Kobe’s happy. Enough said.\n\nNets: So much attention has gone to the Mavericks and their acquisition of Jason Kidd, that sometimes the other team can be forgotten – at least out West.\n\nNew Jersey got the better of this deal, if the future is the concern. Yes, Kidd gives the Mavs a better chance at winning a championship this year. But he turns 35 next month.\n\nDevin Harris is a keeper, and he turns 25 this week. All of the other guys in the trade are simply trade fodder.\n\nThe Mavs still have a lot of talent and are a serious contender, but slowly, their bloated payroll is starting to resemble the Knicks’.\n\nHeat: Same deal as the Nets here. They got the better long-term guy in Shawn Marion, compared with 35-year-old Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nSome rumors coming out of Miami had the Heat trying to ship out Marion before the trade deadline. That didn’t happen, and so those might just have been rumors. If the Heat now can acquire a big man and point guard to go along with Dwyane Wade and Marion, they’ll be OK.\n\nGood luck with that one.\n\nSpurs: Almost meekly, they acquired Kurt Thomas and Damon Stoudamire, two veteran pieces that could help a veteran squad. They didn’t give up anything for Stoudamire, who was a free agent after being bought out by the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nFor Thomas, they gave up an aging Brent Barry, little-used Francisco Elson and a draft pick next year, destined to be a late first-round.\n\nSomehow, the defending NBA champions are now a sleeper pick to win it all. But like the Lakers, they improved their team without really giving up anything valuable.\n\nThe Confused\n\nSuns: With Shaquille O’Neal knocking his own teammate, Raja Bell, out of his debut with the Suns, that could be some sort of symbolic act.\n\nJust as the Suns knocked themselves out of championship contention, O’Neal might continue to knock out his own players.\n\nShaq does give the Suns star-power, and they desperately did need a big man. But there remains a possibility that the Marion-Shaq deal will blow up in the Suns’ face. Of course, it might not.\n\nHaving the blow-up risk out there just wasn’t worth taking.\n\nCavaliers: Cleveland and LeBron James desired a point guard more than anything. So they went out and got Ben Wallace.\n\nHuh?\n\nThey also got sharp-shooting Wally Szczerbiak, who should thrive because of James’ playmaking. And they also got Delonte West, who is considered a point guard, but is actually more of a shooting guard and wasn’t good enough to play in lowly Seattle’s rotation.\n\nGiving up Drew Gooden also could hurt the Cavs, but at least they rid themselves of Larry Hughes, his poor shooting and bloated contract.\n\nMavericks: Kidd truly gives the Mavs a better shot at winning a championship this year or next. But with all of the wackiness involved in their trade – Jerry Stackhouse premeditating a Dallas return and Devean George refusing to be moved – they looked too desperate to make a deal.\n\nMark Cuban’s over-enthusiasm for his team is both a strength and weakness.\n\nThe Losers\n\nBulls: Despite their struggles, they have a young and developing backcourt of Ben Gordon and Kirk Hinrich. So they got rid of Wallace to add Hughes. Bizarre!\n\nGooden should be a good fit in Chicago, but Hughes’ presence could mean the Bulls aren’t completely sold on Gordon, who will be a restricted free agent this summer. If they’re sold on Hughes and not Gordon, that should spell trouble.\n\nKnicks: At least for entertainment value, it would have been nice to see Isiah Thomas try some sort of harebrained move, like he tends to every year.\n\nWithout the Knicks making a trade, what it means is that not only is their team chemistry putrid, but the individuals on their squad are so devalued in the NBA, that making a trade wasn’t possible for Thomas and Co."
