        "text": "<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE </div><div class='quotemain'>He arrived with an approval rating that isn't the best.\n\nEvidence of that conclusion came once Grizzlies newcomer Kwame Brown started doing the math.\n\n\"I've been on three different teams now,\" Brown said. \"I've had four different coaches. ... But I see this as an opportunity.\"\n\nAs the centerpiece of a trade that sent former Grizzly cornerstone Pau Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers for draft picks and future salary-cap relief, Brown didn't seem slighted about being a lucrative chip the Griz will likely cash in once the regular season ends.\n\nThe Griz didn't attempt to quell the fact that Brown's expiring contract worth more than $9 million made the deal possible.\n\n\"That's not any of my business,\" said Brown, a 6-11 center. \"I just have to come out and play hard. We've got a young team here and there's definitely an opportunity for me to get minutes. This could be a fortunate situation for me. I didn't get to play much out in L.A.\"\n\nBrown averaged 5.7 points and 5.7 rebounds in 23 games with the Lakers this season.\n\nHe didn't exactly live up to expectations out there; nor has Brown satisfied the expectations that came with being selected No. 1 overall in the 2001 draft. Gasol was also taken that year, but the only thing Brown and Gasol have in common is that they both know what it's like to be booed by the home fans.\n\nIt's clear that this move had the business -- not the bounce -- of basketball written all over it. Gasol -- a bona fide low-post scorer -- and a 2010 second-round draft pick went to the Lakers for point guard Javaris Crittenton, veteran Aaron McKie, two first-round picks (2008 and 2010) and the rights to Marc Gasol.\n\nAnd, of course, the much-maligned Brown.\n\n\"People have their opinions,\" Brown said. \"I can't live up to what everybody believes. All I can live up to is God and myself. If we had to do that draft all over, who knows what would have happened. Probably the same thing would have happened. Everybody's a genius after the fact.\"\n\nGriz head coach Marc Iavaroni sounded as though he's become an agent for change, saying Brown would be given every shot at redemption.\n\n\"Perhaps we have the program for it,\" Iavaroni said. \"Everyone's misunderstood Darko (Milicic) and Darko's making progress. Perhaps we can do the same thing with Kwame. That's all I care about. I don't care about the past. I care about how much we can grow. ... This is a 35-game season. We told them that they will get the most satisfaction out of it by playing hard, playing smart and playing together.\"\n\nIavaroni spent extra time with Brown after practice as the two seemingly worked on low-post maneuvers. But Brown seemed to immediately enjoy the different philosophy.\n\nIn Memphis, frontline players can lead the fast break.\n\n\"He liked that,\" Iavaroni said. \"It's more demanding but it's going to make him a better player. It's also going to help Darko's development and Darko is going to help (Brown's) development.\"\n\nBrown suggested that the Laker situation may not have been the best for his game.\n\n\"It was a lot of back-to-the-basket stuff,\" he said. \"What I see here is more of a flow game that will allow me to use my quickness in the open court. I've got to get my offensive rhythm down. I played mostly defense in L.A. I'm going to do that also, but hopefully I can get more involved offensively.\"\n\nEven one of Brown's harshest critics, Lakers coach Phil Jackson, believes there is untapped potential. The Lakers' 21/2 -year experiment with Brown was filled with questions about Brown's toughness and skill.\n\n\"The reality is, Kwame has a game,\" Jackson told the Washington Post before their game Sunday against the Wizards. \"We're going to miss part of the game he gave to us, which was keeping people away from the basket, knocking people around with his big body. The things he could do when he could run well.\"\n\nBrown, like Gasol, called it a \"shock\" to be traded.\n\nBut unlike a 7-foot Spaniard who used to reside in Memphis, Brown wasn't the least bit sentimental.\n\n\"It's the nature of the business,\" Brown said.\n\nTip-ins\n\nThe Grizzlies officially acquired center Jason Collins and cash considerations from the New Jersey Nets for forward/center Stromile Swift. Griz general manager Chris Wallace said: \"We are pleased to add a veteran big man with Jason's team defensive skills and outstanding intangibles.\" In 43 games (23 starts) this season, the 29-year-old Collins averaged 1.4 points and 2.1 rebounds in 15.9 minutes. He will wear jersey No. 34 for the Grizzlies. ... Second-year swingman Rudy Gay will appear on ESPNews' \"Hot List\" today to promote the NBA's dunk contest, and the fan assistance Gay has solicited on YouTube. The interview is schedule to air around 4 p.m.\n\nFrom high school to No. 1 overall\n\nNew Grizzly Kwame Brown is one of just three high school players to be drafted No. 1 overall in the NBA. Here's how they compare:\n\nKwame Brown\n\nDraft details: First pick in 2001 by Washington Wizards out of Glynn Academy (Ga.)\n\n2007-08 statistics: Averaging 5.7 points, 5.7 rebounds\n\nCareer averages: 7.6 points, 5.7 rebounds\n\nNotable: Traded to Lakers in 2005 in deal that sent future All-Star Caron Butler to Washington.\n\nLeBron James\n\nDraft details: First pick in 2003 by Cleveland Cavaliers out of Akron (Ohio) St. Vincent-St. Mary\n\n2007-08 statistics: Averaging 30.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.2 assists\n\nCareer averages: 27.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 6.5 assists\n\nNotable: 2004 Rookie of the Year, four-time All-Star\n\nDwight Howard\n\nDraft details: First pick in 2004 by Orlando Magic out of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy\n\n2007-08 statistics: Averaging 21.7 points, 14.8 rebounds\n\nCareer averages: 16.2 points, 12.1 rebounds\n\nNotable: Two-time All-Star</div>\n\nSource: Memphis CA"
