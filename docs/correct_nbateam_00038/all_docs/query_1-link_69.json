        "text": "please just stop talking bro, you dont even know the beggining of \"insider\" stuff stop trying to act like a analyst because u obv dont know crap...the only reason that trade went down was because of the first trade....Kevin Garnett to Boston from Minesota whos MANAGER is KEVIN MCHALE the ex Bostin Celtic who gave him pretty much for freee, u think the gasol trade was bad? lmfao\n\nKwame suckssss asss! he is THE WORST #1 draft pick EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR­R! in any sport!\n\nThe guy played with both \"Jordans\" ( Jordan in Wizards, and Kobe in LA) and sucked ass...we used to booooo his ass everyyy time when we went to the games thank god hes out....\n\nAnd ur jokin if u think gasol wasnt as good as he is now in memphis, he is! your just never saw his games!\n\nKOBE WON WITHOUT SHAQ....and yes obvious no one player can do it by himself...as it is evident with SHAQ who has played with literally THE BEST GUARDS OF THE LEAGUE, ffrom Penny Hardaway, in Orlando, to Kobe in LA to Dwayne Wade in Miama, to Steve Nash in PHX and now with Lebron w the CAVS?!!!!! are u kidding me man go learn ur facts then try to argue!\n\nA moment ago Thu \"my puppy is fatter than yours\" N. says:\n\nI'm wondering why my dear Yelp friends Ski and Michael M. haven't stopped in on this thread yet.\n\nOh right...because even they can take Christmas for what it's worth, and make it a hate-free day (or maybe? Day's too early to tell)\n\nLook Frank, it's Christmas. Go open some presents, have a sip of wine, and try to ignore the Sports channel today? I would hate to see any Yelper break into a seizure over the NBA on Xmas day.\n\n--\n\nI hope you understand I have no hate in me.\n\nI only hate the nba. I laugh at people that try to legitmize it.\n\nAt least baseball dosent have a cap so teams like the Yankees can do what the lakers and celtics do without breaking any rules. I have opened presents. I just switched on the tv and saw Kobe talking about his championship and started laughing like Barkely did in the clip I posted. I felt the need to help people snap out of believing the hype that Kobe was perpetuating.\n\nI used to root for teams and such in the NBA but there is no point. I would rather root for a WWE wrestler. I still follow some of the plays because they are the best athletes.\n\nI just wanted to caution anyone that believes the hype to snap out of it.\n\nI hate to break it to you wrestling is not real and basketball is fake too.\n\nIt might come as a shock to some\n\nFrank, the thing is...you make it sound like you're doing the world a favor, as if what you are declaring has never been declared before. All you're doing is attempting to spread negativity about a sport people clearly enjoy watching. What's the point? What's so bad about a bunch of friends/family members gathering around the t.v. to enjoy a game? There's enough b.s going on in the world, and this should be the very least of your concerns.\n\nAlso, you compare it to the WWE... which, I see where you're getting at. But, you forget that aside from their gigantic muscles and nasty greasy hair, there's nothing else to them. You can regurgitate all the conspiracy theories about the NBA which many people before you have, but you simply can't deny Kobe's talents. Kobe's a fierce competitor who happens to be playing in a different time with different rules. Don't think for a second that if he were playing during the Showtime days, he'd be kicking it in his warmers on the sidelines, serving as the water boy to Worthy\n\nThu \"my puppy is fatter than yours\" N. says:\n\nFrank, what I'm simply trying to tell you is that your efforts are going to by the wayside...much like it would be if Pro-Choice advocates were to try to convince Pro-Lifers that Abortion is not immoral. But I loosely compare the two since Abortion is clearly a more serious issue than the conspiracy theories about the NBA. Again, you're not doing anyone any favors.\n\n--\n\nIf you are trying to tell me neither the Celtics nor the Lakers engaged in insider trading with former hall of fame players of said teams then you are like a child who still believes that the WWE is real. If you don't believe the allegations of officals about fixing games by officals then you are like a child who still believes that the WWE is real. You attempt to ratinoalize these trades all you want but they don't add up.\n\nThe rationalizations for these trades are a joke.\n\nbut you simply can't deny Kobe's talents.\n\n--\n\nFor the record he is a great player.He did his job with one of the top 3 big men of all time and got rings. No one can deny that. Much respect for him as a player. The problem with him is that he needed a fixed trade to win a championship without one of the best bigs of all time.\n\nIf the lakers would have received relative value for Kwame they would still be rebuilding as would the celtics. That is what small market teams do. It takes time rebuild. The lakers/celtics through insider trading carpool laned Kobe into a championship.\n\nPlease understand Kobe is the next in line in terms of talent to MJ.\n\nI believe the rock is a bad ass wrestler and I think he was one of the best in the WWE.\n\nI do believe that if he and the lakers did not make insider trades they would both not be championship contenders even today.\n\nI am doing this as a PSA for people that are in a fog what really took place.\n\nJudging by this thread there are a lot of people out there still quite confused.\n\nFrank S....who's jumping to conclusions now? Basically, I made a diplomatic attempt to tell you to calm the eff down, and perhaps...redirect this energy toward a more worthy \"PSA\". You're prancing around this thread like you're some sort of vigilante, saving the world from the evil powers of the NBA. Give it a rest.\n\nAll I said was I see where you're getting at with the WWE comparison, but try not to dumb it down too much because Kobe's talent is entirely on a different level than a bunch of muscular so-called wrestlers (which I see we're in agreement there).\n\nAnd FTR, I'm not going to deny that West pulled some strings for this. But, you have to remember that Kobe is just the beneficiary for all this, not the mastermind. Kobe hardly goes without crediting Gasol/Fish, two players he publicly respects and has high regard for...even dubbing Gasol one of the best players of the world in one of this interviews. What else are you expecting, a public apology to Frank S? If there's anyone you should be focusing on, it's Mitch and Jerry\n\nThu \"my puppy is fatter than yours\" N. says:\n\nFrank S....who's jumping to conclusions now?

I am very very calm. I just did Bikram yoga. I am in a meditative state.\n\nSecondly, you are attempting to dictate my value structure which is why you have reached a point where you are misjudging my mood. To make it as simple as possible value is subjective. Telling me there is no value in do a PSA is asking me to get on the semantics marry-go-round.\n\nThirdly you charaterization of me on this thread is an attack at me personally. I am in no way trying to save people from the nba. You seem to enjoy stretching my mood and other parts of my charachter to show some sort of charater flaw. This really weakens your point of view. You are straying from the glaring flaw in the NBA to some weak jabs at my person. Its ad homeim please note that I have not made any charchter judgments of you.\n\nLastly I don't think Kobe did all of this by himself. He is more interested in playing the role of Tiger Woods. That is the common confusion people on this thread are conjuring up.\n\nI am just shining light on the fact the entire system is flawed and their is ample evidence to prove it.\n\nI have been playing thread tennis with people because a lot of people including yourself can't seem to swallow the pill of reality.\n\nIts not your fault.\n\nIts not your fault.\n\nIts not your fault.\n\nThe nba is fixed like the WWE.\n\nI will keep driving this point home as long as people are condused.\n\nThanks for your time in regards to helping prove my point of the discomfort people go through when this dawns upon them.\n\nIt really is like trying to tell a child wreslting is not real.\n\nEthan S. says:\n\nFrank, honestly shut the fuck up and shot hating on the best team in the NBA. If you think the NBA is fixed, you're actually high. The NBA is completely legitimate, and stop shitting on Kobe. He's fucking amazing, and nothing you say can deny that. As for Gasol, he wasn't good before he got to the lakers, so his work ethic got him to be where he is today. There's no way the NBA could be fixed and no one knows about it. Accept the fact the lakers are legit and dominate the league. Go back to hating lakers just cause they fucked up any other team in the league.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n\"The NBA is completely legitimate\". How the hell do you know for a fact that it is? We've already seen that it wasnt (when Donaghy was still reffing). All we can do is assume. I assume the NFL, MLB, NCAA, and NBA are legit. Otherwise I would not be able to watch it. But you dont really know. Im not gonna let a rogue ref like Donaghy ruin NBA basketball for me, but the fact is is that gambling and point shaving exist, and from time to time they do and can happen.\n\n\"As for Gasol, he wasn't good before he got to the lakers\". You just lost any legitamacy you had in this thread with that comment. If you really watched and knew your basketball you would have known that Pau was good BEFORE he came to the lakers... He was averaging around 20 ppg and 9 rpg at the end of his tenure with the Grizzlies. He was an all star with them too. He wasnt good? No sir, you just didnt know about him until he came to the lakers and played on a national stage. You are the definition of what I call a \"Laker homer\". I think the following define you to a T: yelp.com/biz/los-angeles…\n\nMichael \"McBeyond\" M. says:\n\nSki:\n\nYou're forgetting that Donaghy himself didn't actually fix games. He never bet on the ones he himself reffed. He just picked winners based on who of his colleagues was reffing the games. All of the referees that he found predictable are still officiating.\n\n_______________________________\n\nHe did say that, but Im not really sure if I believe him Mike. He might have just said that to save whatever credibility he had left. Or maybe not, I dont know. But thats the thing: To say that an nba game has NEVER been fixed is irresponsible. No one knows for sure. MLB games have been fixed in the past. NCAA basketball games have been fixed in the past. What makes the NBA full proof? It has been shown though that NBA refs do favor certain players, and dislike others... From a personal and/or professional standpoint. And those views can sometimes spill out onto the court and affect the games they are officiating. Its not illegal, but no one should tell me that refs are like robots and they are not subject to any of the outside distractions like everyone else is, because they are.\n\nI believe that he did his best not to get caught. I also know that he was not a senior official and probably didn't have the power to single-handedly swing games the way that old dogs like Dick Bavetta and Danny Crawford can.\n\nRefs should be like robots--or as close as possible. The problem with the NBA is that they encourage bias and use it to manipulate outcomes. How else can you explain Danny Crawford being allowed to officiate two games out of 7 for the Mavericks-Heat series, when the NBA knows full well that the Mavericks have a 1-17 record when Crawford officiates?\n\nI don't know. Read the dude's book. Donaghy's credibility isn't really in question since he hasn't actually lied. He admitted to the whole thing. Based on Donaghy's writing, he comes across to me as a credible person. He doesn't sway particularly one way or the other on whose fault it is that NBA officials are predictable, he just states the facts. The media and the NBA on the other hand, throw out all sorts of red herrings to deflect the criticism that the officiating is indeed very poor and inconsistent. When one party refuses to acknowledge something that is visually obvious, I am inclined to believe that party is the one with something to hide.\n\nIf the NBA honestly believes that they have the best officials in the world, they need to address the facts. Until then, it's all bullshit to me."
