        "text": "One of my coolest experiences covering the Lakers was the time I got a press credential for my mom while she happened to be in town visiting. Other than the locker room (which she would have been too intimidated to enter, anyway), mom was allowed any access I had. She watched Phil Jackson take questions. She ate in the media dining room. She met Coby Karl. And she got to watch the game with me in some terrific seats. For someone who had never attended a Lakers game, this was a spectacular maiden voyage. Plus, the Lakers beat Denver decisively, making everything even more fun.\n\nHowever, January 17, 2008 wasn’t all sunshine inside Staples Center. Andrew Bynum, whose surprise breakthrough sold Kobe Bryant on this team’s championship potential, was shelved with a season-ending knee injury. This made Kwame Brown the starting center. Already pegged, along with the departed Smush Parker, as the face of the previous two seasons’ struggles, he was now a convenient target for a new set of problems, particularly since he wasn’t playing well.\n\nIn fact, Brown was last seen inside Staples during a game against Phoenix in which he drew five fouls, turned the ball over seven times and got viciously booed.\n\nHe played well enough in his followup against Denver to avoid more harshness, but tension remained so palpable with him on the court that Mom wondered what was happening. The backstory struck her as quite sad.\n\nTwo weeks later, Brown got traded to the Grizzlies in a franchise-altering deal for Pau Gasol. Talking with Mom about this, she wasn’t familiar with El Spaniard, but when I informed her Kwame was getting moved, she responded, without a hint of snark, “Well, that’s probably for the best.”\n\nFrom the moment he joined the Lakers to the moment he left, Brown was set up to lose, and it wasn’t fair.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying he was unfairly criticized for his play, which indeed left much to be desired. Brown was a legitimately great, low-post defender at a time when the game was closer to the basket and there was a premium on slowing folks like Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Elton Brand, Dwight Howard and O’Neals Jermaine and Shaquille. However, he wasn’t terribly effective in any other aspect of defense (including the glass), and his offense was even shakier. His small, stiff and seemingly never-ready hands made every pass in his direction feel like a bobble waiting to happen. Bunny layups were often astonishing misadventures, and Kwame’s confidence painfully cratered after misses.\n\nCoupled with a non-existent jumper and a free-throw percentage below 50, teammates were often playing four-on-five with the ball. Plus, Brown’s focus waxed and waned. He uncorked several effective performances during the 2006 playoffs, allowing hope for a corner turned. But more often, Kwame seemed stuck in neutral, not overtly intent to improve. Obviously, that’s on him.\n\nBut even acknowledging Brown didn’t take every right step as a Laker, he was still set up to lose. Already an NBA punchline/punching bag after his turbulent stint as Washington’s (and Michael Jordan’s) No. 1 overall pick in 2001, Kwame’s arrival in Los Angeles meant the departure of forward Caron Butler, an All-Star caliber player who instantly bonded with Kobe Bryant on and off the court. Even if you believed in Brown’s potential as a naturally gifted athlete in need of fresh scenery (and I believe the Lakers did, although I also believe they moved Butler in large part because of a reluctance to pay him long-term, which was shortsighted), he was nonetheless a project big on a team that just drafted the ultimate one in Bynum.\n\nKwame quickly represented every front office move that didn’t make sense at a time when Kobe’s prime appeared in danger of getting wasted. Already mentally wrecked, Brown was now underachieving on a higher-profile stage. Those struggles were his to own, but they also radically shaped his reputation as a human being, which never sat well with me.\n\nTruth be told, I really enjoyed covering Kwame, along with the learning experience he provided about how narrative and reality can vastly differ. I expected him to be a malcontent because that was the overarching coverage of a controversial prep-to-pro and the poster child for everything “wrong” with the NBA at the time, including how these damn kids needed to attend college and grow up! (Perhaps Brown would have developed better in college, but it’s hard to argue that making nearly $64,000,000 by age 30 equals a botched career path. Frankly, the league has seen far bigger busts than him.)\n\nAs such, I wasn’t prepared for someone soft-spoken. Introspective. Highly intelligent. A really good dude. He also was sensitive, which was a reflection of his overall character and why life in a fishbowl could be tough. Kwame was often skittish with the media, and that sometimes made conversations hard to come by. I used to call him the Lakers’ Andy Dufresne because he regularly vanished after games, as if there was a Raquel Welch poster in his locker. But when in the mood to talk, on or off the record, the conversations were enjoyable. I missed having him around, but as Mom rightly noted, it was clearly for the best.\n\nBefore closing, a few additional memories involving Kwame.\n\n1. During his first season with the Lakers, Vlad Radmanovic separated his shoulder while snowboarding over the All-Star break, a decided contract violation. (His initial explanation about slipping on a patch of ice while grabbing coffee was hilariously inept.) During his exit interview, Brown suddenly appeared off to the side, quietly repeating, “Why’d you jump off the mountain?” Vlad Rad didn’t find this terribly amusing, but it was hysterical. Low key, Kwame had a good sense of humor.\n\n2. As everyone remembers, Kobe loudly demanded a trade during the 2007 offseason, vowing to never play for the Lakers again. Uncertainty about his future bled into that season’s training camp, and it became even more dramatic when he was the last player to emerge during media day. For several minutes, there was widespread confusion about whether Bryant was even at the facility. Case in point: When I saw Kwame and we began catching up, he asked in earnest if I knew Kobe’s whereabouts. Obviously, everything worked out quite well in the end, but that exchange speaks to just how crazy things were.\n\n3. I covered this period for the Los Angeles Times’ Lakers blog, which featured a comments section that evolved into a legitimate online community. Of course, communities include insane people, and we had one commenter who was, without question, the biggest Kwame Brown fan on the planet. Like, obsessed with Kwame. In particular, he was obsessed with Brown’s calves, which he considered anatomical unicorns between their shape, size and power. These calves were regularly described as “corn fed,” and I still don’t understand what that means. Moreover, this devoted fan considered Kwame the most crucial member of the Lakers, far more than Kobe. In fact, he regularly railed against Kobe for stunting Brown’s growth. Ditto Phil Jackson. And Chris Mihm because Jackson initially started him at center over Kwame, as if that was somehow Mihm’s fault. And sportswriters like me were part of a massive conspiracy against Brown. In fact, when the Lakers acquired Gasol, this commenter declared many times (in all caps) that the franchise would not only rue this decision, one that would cost it multiple future titles, but also he was done with the Lakers. DONE! The team crossed a line disrespecting Kwame, and he would no longer be a party to it.\n\nLife is about making choices.\n\n(Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / NBAE via Getty Images)"
