        "text": "Following the Lakers’ exit from the NBA playoffs, one of the biggest draft busts in league history eviscerated LeBron James on social media for his lack of killer instinct down the stretch in Los Angeles’ Game 4 loss to Denver.\n\nThat’s right, Kwame Brown had something to say about it. The play in question came at the end of regulation when James was double-teamed by Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon and had his shot blocked as time expired.\n\n“You are a stat sheet junkie,” Brown began. “You’re a bad boy when it comes to stats. Throughout history, people are going to look up your stat line and say ‘He’s gotta be the greatest player to ever play the game,’ and then people who have actually played the game are gonna know that is bulls---. I have never seen a guy of your caliber, supposed caliber, you don’t even get a shot off?”\n\nBrown later added, “You’re probably the best scorer in the game, you got all these points. But you were looking for a bailout, again.“\n\nGiven the way that Brown’s career flamed out relative to expectations, NBA Twitter didn’t believe that the former No. 1 pick had any room to talk when it came to James, who is the leading scorer in NBA history.\n\nHere are some of the best reactions from Brown’s wild rant about James."
