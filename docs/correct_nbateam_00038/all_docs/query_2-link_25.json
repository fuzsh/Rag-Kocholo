        "text": "Brown was raised in the rural South by Joyce and Willie James Brown. The younger Brown was one of eight children who grew up in a low-income household.\n\nHis father was abusive, and he left the family when the younger Brown was starting grade school after he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Four of Brown’s brothers also served time in jail or prison for various crimes.\n\nThe Brown clan grew up in an environment where there was a lack of opportunity, and as is the case with many of America’s inner-city and poor neighborhoods, a lack of opportunity means plenty of opportunities to get mixed up with the wrong crowd.\n\nLuckily, Kwame Brown won the genetic lottery, and it would be his ticket out of Brunswick, Ga.\n\nHe would grow to be 6-foot-11 and possessed what appeared to be the body of a grown man by his senior year of high school. He was considered by many to be the best high school player in his class, so much so that NBA teams were ready to take him with one of the top picks in the 2001 draft if he skipped college.\n\nThe Washington Wizards made Brown the top pick that year, and in doing so, they made Brown the first high school player to become the first overall pick in the NBA draft.\n\nPeople around the league felt he could become the next Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett – namely the next superstar to jump straight from high school to the pros.\n\nWhen Brown debuted with the Wizards in the fall of 2001, it also marked the return of Michael Jordan, who came out of their front office to suit up for the squad.\n\nOn the outside, Brown looked like a man with elite athleticism and a body that was chiseled by God himself. But beneath that facade, he had problems.\n\nHead coach Doug Collins tried to take Brown under his wing, but he soon found that the teenager was woefully unprepared for NBA life, on and off the court.\n\nHe had a profound lack of basketball fundamentals that translated to the pro level, and he had some trouble staying focused during games and practices. The team would even discover that he had exercise-induced asthma because his lungs were underdeveloped and unable to cope with the rigors of the NBA.\n\nAccording to a revealing Washington Post article that season, Collins felt Brown was lazy and soft. He chided the rookie for wanting to sit out with a sprained ankle during the exhibition season, and the two got into plenty of spats that season.\n\nCollins, Jordan and other teammates intentionally started roughing up Brown both physically and emotionally to try to toughen him up. It didn’t work.\n\nOne day, after Collins threw him out of practice, Brown was reduced to tears.\n\nThe big man never panned out in Washington, averaging 7.7 points and 5.5 rebounds in 22.7 minutes per game during four seasons with the team. On occasion, he would have a strong game and lead observers into thinking he was turning a corner, but it never happened.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the Lakers were coming off an embarrassing season in which they had missed the playoffs. It was their maiden voyage without Shaquille O’Neal, and the entire organization looked to be a mess.\n\nOne of the team’s needs was serviceable big men, and to that end, it traded Caron Butler, who was a reliable offensive option, plus guard Chucky Atkins for Brown.\n\nPerhaps Phil Jackson, who had just returned from his one-year sabbatical to be the Lakers’ head coach again, thought a change of scenery would bring out the best in Brown.\n\nA sizeable number of hard-core Lakers fans also thought that Lakers exceptionalism would turn him into a star, or at least a good player.\n\nThey would be wrong.\n\nBrown showed no improvement in 2006, his first season with the Purple and Gold, averaging 7.4 points and 6.6 rebounds a game. Although his low post defense was solid at times, his overall game was a liability.\n\nHe had no low post moves on offense, no perimeter jumper and he would often fail to catch simple passes from teammates. He seemed to lack fire and aggression, not to mention self-confidence.\n\nWhen Brown was on the court, he was an albatross who prevented the Lakers from being anything more than the mediocre team they were at the time.\n\nWhen the emerging Andrew Bynum went down with a season-ending knee injury in January 2008, the Lakers were one of the best teams in the Western Conference. But the burden of manning their frontcourt once again fell to Brown, and the Lakers’ record would fall with him.\n\nOne night against the Phoenix Suns seemed to be a microcosm of all of Brown’s inadequacies. He had eight points, six rebounds and seven turnovers while committing five fouls in 25 minutes, and the Staples Center crowd groaned with each of his miscues.\n\nDays later, during a game versus the Detroit Pistons, Brown made a special request of Kobe Bryant.\n\nVia Washington Post:\n\n“So down the stretch of the game, they put in a box and one,” said Bryant. “So I’m surrounded by these players, Detroit players, and Kwame is under the basket, all by himself. Literally, like all by himself. So I pass him the ball, he bobbled it and it goes out of bounds.\n\n“So we go back to the timeout and I’m [upset], right? He goes, ‘I was wide open.’ ‘Yeah, I know.’ This is how I’m talking to him, like, during the game. I said, ‘You’re going to be open again, Kwame, because Rasheed [Wallace] is just totally ignoring you.’ He said, ‘Well, if I’m open don’t throw it to me.’ I was like, ‘Huh?’ He said, ‘Don’t throw it to me.’ I said, ‘Why not?’ He said, well, ‘I’m nervous. If I catch it and they foul me, I won’t make the free throws.’ I said, ‘Hell no!’”\n\nFortunately, Brown would soon be some other team’s problem.\n\nThe day after that Detroit game, February 1, 2008, was the day that drastically changed the fortunes of Bryant and the Lakers.\n\nThat day, it was announced that Brown and three other players had been traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Pau Gasol, their All-Star big man.\n\nAll of a sudden, after three and a half years of purgatory, the Lakers were legitimate championship contenders again, and they had a date with destiny, as they would face the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals that June.\n\nAlthough the Lakers lost there, their future was bright, as they went on to win the next two world championships, including one over those hated Celtics.\n\nIf Lakers fans don’t and shouldn’t hate or be mad at Brown, it’s mostly because he was an integral part of the trade that turned everything around.\n\nThe big man would go on to play five more seasons for five more teams, including the Grizzlies. He managed to stick around the league for 12 years not because he had any real value, but because, as the old saying goes, you cannot teach height.\n\nPerhaps if Brown had been a second-round pick, or even a late first-round pick, he would’ve simply been considered an adequate NBA player and not a bust.\n\nPerhaps Jordan and the Wizards were really to blame for expecting so much out of a teenager who clearly wasn’t ready for the dog-eat-dog world of the NBA."
