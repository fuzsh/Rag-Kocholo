Thinking it might all be part of Stern's master plan.\n\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12601063/\n\nLAPD: Lakers' Kwame Brown Accused Of Sexual Assault\n\nKNBC-TV\n\n4:20 p.m. PDT May 2, 2006\n\nLOS ANGELES - The Lakers' Kwame Brown is being investigated for an alleged sexual assault at an area hotel, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The alleged assault occurred Sunday after the team's playoff victory against the Phoenix Suns, police said.\n\nThe Suns and Lakers are scheduled to play Tuesday night.\n\nVF21\n\nSuper Moderator Emeritus\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nWell, you can tell Brown must be getting better.\n\nWomen never file charges against the benchwarmers...\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nYo Brick you wouldn't understand... It's a Laker thing.\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nWho would have thought that it could happen to a Laker ?\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nSo should we call the Lakers bench the SVU?\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nIt's an LA thing in many ways. Every time I hear a story like this, I remember a girl in my high school whose ex-boyfriend made it into the NBA. You could see her eyeballs light up with dollar signs as she proudly boasted of a plan to make a similar claim as a way of getting back at him for cheating.\n\nConsidering the player's current level of \"success,\" its probably best that she apparently decided against it. Her full settlement would have probably equalled the number of pennies I found on the ground today.\n\nF\n\nFillmoe\n\nGuest\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nkobe is rubbing off...\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nIt will probably have the same outcome as the other lFaker. I would say how stupid would you have to be to do this at all but especially during the PO's, but then it is Kwame so never mind.\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nWow. Too many similarities. Sad if true. So sad.\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nWill Reggie Evans be charged with sexual assault?\n\nMay 2, 2006\n\nGoGoGadget said:\n\nIt's an LA thing in many ways.
