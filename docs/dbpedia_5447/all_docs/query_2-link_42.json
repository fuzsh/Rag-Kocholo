        "text": "Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person’s sex or gender. It can lead to many harmful behaviors, from acts of violence to subtle comments that reinforce stereotypes.\n\nAll manifestations of sexism are harmful and have a negative impact on society. Women are most severely affected, but sexism also affects people of other marginalized genders. Less directly, it also harms men.\n\nIn this article, we describe the different types of sexism and give some examples that people may commonly encounter.\n\nA note about sex and gender\n\nSex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more.\n\nSexism is prejudice or discrimination against a person or group based on their sex or gender. It primarily affects women and girls, and it is the root cause of gender inequity worldwide.\n\nSexist acts include any that frame one sex or gender as inferior. Sexism can be conveyed in:\n\nbehavior\n\nspeech\n\nwriting\n\nimages\n\ngestures\n\nlaws and policies\n\npractices and traditions\n\nLearn the difference between sex and gender.\n\nPeople categorize sexism in several ways. Sexism can be:\n\nhostile\n\nbenevolent\n\nambivalent\n\nThese terms come from the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, a framework that researchers use to understand and measure the effects of this prejudice.\n\nSexism can operate on different levels in society. It can be:\n\ninstitutional\n\ninterpersonal\n\ninternalized\n\nThe following sections describe these types of sexism in more detail.\n\nThis refers to beliefs and behaviors that are openly hostile toward a group of people based on their sex or gender. Misogyny, or the hatred of women, is an example of hostile sexism.\n\nPeople who hold views that are hostile and sexist may view women as:\n\nmanipulative\n\ndeceitful\n\ncapable of using seduction to control men\n\nneeding to be kept in their place\n\nThese views may also apply to anyone with feminine traits and anyone who expresses their gender in a way that is associated with femininity.\n\nPeople who perpetuate hostile sexism want to preserve men’s dominance over women and people of other marginalized genders. They typically oppose gender equality and may also oppose LGBTQIA+ rights, seeing these things as a threat to men and the systems that benefit them.\n\nImpact\n\nHostile sexism is dangerous. According to 2019 research, it is a risk factor for sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\n\nA 2015 study found that men who endorsed hostile sexism were more likely to be physically abusive toward their partners, with alcohol use — another common risk factor — having less of an effect on rates of intimate partner violence among this group. This suggests that hostile sexism is a powerful driver of abuse in relationships.\n\nA 2019 study in Indonesia also found a positive link between hostile sexism and sexual assault. People who endorsed hostile sexism were more likely to believe in “rape myths” that place the blame for sexual assault on the victim, not the perpetrator.\n\nExamples\n\nExamples of hostile sexism include:\n\nusing sexist language or insults\n\nmaking threatening or aggressive comments based on a person’s gender or sex\n\nharassing or threatening someone for defying gender norms, online or offline\n\ntreating people as subordinates based on their sex or gender and punishing them when they “step out of line”\n\nbelieving that some victims of sexual assault “ask for it” due to their behavior or clothing\n\nengaging in physical or sexual assault\n\nBenevolent sexism includes views and behaviors that frame women as:\n\ninnocent\n\npure\n\ncaring and nurturing\n\nfragile and in need of protection\n\nbeautiful\n\nA 2020 study involving participants in the United States and United Kingdom found that people who believed in humanity’s dominance over nature and who saw women as being more closely connected with nature than men were more likely to exhibit benevolent sexism.\n\nImpact\n\nIn comparison to hostile sexism, benevolent sexism can be less obvious. It is a more socially accepted form and is much more likely to be endorsed by men and women. However, despite its name, this type of sexism is not truly benevolent.\n\nWhile benevolent sexism applies some positive traits to women and femininity, it still frames one sex or gender as weaker than another. These ideas can lead to policies and behaviors that limit a person’s agency, or the ability of someone to make their own choices.\n\nFor example, the 2020 study found that men who endorsed benevolent sexism were more likely to support policies that limit the freedoms of pregnant women. Benevolent sexism also undermines girls’ confidence in themselves and their abilities.\n\nExamples\n\nSome examples of benevolent sexism include:\n\nbasing a woman’s value on her role as a mother, wife, or girlfriend\n\nfocusing attention and praise on someone’s appearance rather than their other attributes\n\nbelieving that people should not do things for themselves, such as manage money or drive a car, because of their gender\n\nassuming that a person is a nurse, assistant, or secretary — not a doctor, executive, or manager — based on their gender\n\nsupporting policies that make it difficult for women to work, have independence, or deviate from traditional gender roles\n\nThis is a combination of benevolent and hostile sexism. People who engage in ambivalent sexism may vary between seeing women as good, pure, and innocent and seeing them as manipulative or deceitful, depending on the situation.\n\nSome researchers argue that hostile and benevolent sexism support one another as part of a system.\n\nBenevolent sexism offers women protection in exchange for them adopting a more subordinate role, while hostile sexism targets those who deviate from this. For this reason, some refer to the former as “Plan A” and the latter as “Plan B.”\n\nSome examples of ambivalent sexism include:\n\nglorifying traditionally feminine behavior and demonizing “unladylike” behavior, in media coverage, for example\n\nhiring someone because they are attractive, then firing them if they do not respond to sexual advances\n\ndifferentiating between “good” women and “bad” women based on how they dress\n\nThis refers to sexism that is entrenched in organizations and institutions, such as:\n\nthe government\n\nthe legal system\n\nthe education system\n\nthe healthcare system\n\nfinancial institutions\n\nthe media\n\nother workplaces\n\nWhen policies, procedures, attitudes, or laws create or reinforce sexism, this is institutional sexism.\n\nInstitutional sexism is widespread. It can be hostile, benevolent, or ambivalent. One of the clearest indicators is the lack of gender diversity among political leaders and business executives.\n\nAnother indicator is a gender pay gap. This refers to a difference in the median earnings between women and men. In the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a woman earns 82 cents for every dollar that a man earns. Overall, women earn less than men in almost every occupation.\n\nThis gap is wider for women with children and for Black, Latina, Indigenous, Asian, and Pacific Islander women.\n\nThis manifests during interactions with others. It can occur in the workplace, within relationships, among family members, and in interactions with strangers.\n\nExamples of interpersonal sexism include:\n\ntelling someone to be more ladylike\n\njudging someone for not fitting into stereotypes of femininity, such as by being caring or submissive\n\nmaking inappropriate comments about someone’s appearance\n\ntalking down to someone based on assumptions about their gender\n\nengaging in unwanted sexual attention or touching\n\njustifying sexist behavior by saying “boys will be boys”\n\nThere are many types of sexism. This prejudice and discrimination can be hostile and overt or seemingly benevolent and more subtly harmful.\n\nMany countries that consider themselves to be tolerant instead perpetuate a mixture of types, forming a system of ambivalent sexism.\n\nAll types of sexism are harmful to the health of society. To stop sexism, it is crucial to understand how it manifests and then to challenge sexist attitudes and practices at all levels — from the internal to the institutional."
