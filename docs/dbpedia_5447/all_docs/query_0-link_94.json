        "text": "01 of 46\n\nMICHELLE PFEIFFER: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 1990: Being named one of the World's Most Beautiful celebrities in 1990 came as something of a shock to Pfeiffer. the actress told PEOPLE. \"It's the way my mouth sort of curls up, or my nose tilts up.\" Landing on the cover – again – nine years later, Pfeiffer told PEOPLE of her younger self, \"I did nothing beauty-wise. People were horrified by how I treated my skin.\"\n\n02 of 46\n\nMICHELLE PFEIFFER: NOW\n\nNow: The 64-year-old actress (with husband David E. Kelley) sees the upside to aging. \"[Part] of feeling sexy is feeling comfortable in your own skin, and less inhibited,\" she told InStyle, \"and that goes along with getting older.\"\n\n03 of 46\n\nJODIE FOSTER: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 1992: \"My face must have dropped in the last five years,\" joked the then 29-year-old beauty, who had just earned a Best Actress Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs and won raves for Little Man Tate, her directorial debut. \"Suddenly I got bones that I never had before. Now I really enjoy putting care into my clothes, my makeup, my appearance.\"\n\n04 of 46\n\nJODIE FOSTER: NOW\n\nNow: Sixty years old and a mom of two, the actress says she isn't likely to try cosmetic surgery to keep her looks in check. \"For me, it's really a self-image thing,\" she told More magazine. \"I'd rather have somebody go, 'Wow, that girl has a big nose,' than 'Wow, that girl has a bad nose job.' \"\n\n05 of 46\n\nCINDY CRAWFORD: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 1993: The 27-year-old supermodel was on a roll that year: She was the face of Revlon, had a hosting gig on MTV's House of Style and was married to future Sexiest Man Alive Richard Gere (he earned that distinction in 1999).\n\n06 of 46\n\nCINDY CRAWFORD: NOW\n\nNow: In the decades following her Most Beautiful cover, Crawford got divorced, remarried and launched successful home furnishing, fashion and skincare lines. She also developed a good attitude about getting older. \"I take care of myself, but I don't want to be obsessive,\" the 57-year-old mom of two told Allure. \"I'm all for fighting the good fight, but I don't care how much you work out or how much cream you put on – things change.\"\n\n07 of 46\n\nMEG RYAN: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 1994: When handed the title, the actress said, \"Beauty is a very oddball subject to talk about in terms of yourself.\" Her Sleepless in Seattle costars happily did it for her, though, with Rosie O'Donnell calling her \"completely adorable\" and Tom Hanks saying she's a \"formidable presence.\" Voted \"cutest\" by her classmates at her Connecticut high school, she told PEOPLE, \"I've never thought of myself that way.\"\n\n08 of 46\n\nMEG RYAN: NOW\n\nNow: Though she kept her résumé packed through the 1980s and '90s, Ryan retreated from the spotlight following her split from Dennis Quaid, moving to New York, scaling back on projects and interviews and quietly adopting a daughter, Daisy, in 2006, while raising her now-adult son Jack Quaid. The 61-year-old stepped back in front of the camera in 2015, for Ithaca, a World War II-era film she also directed and debuted at the Middleburg Film Festival in Virginia. She recently returned to the small screen in the series Picture Paris.\n\n09 of 46\n\nCOURTENEY COX: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 1995: Back in the '90s, the Friends star admitted to being a facial product fanatic. \"I have 150 cleansers in my bathroom,\" Cox said. But she was low-key about the rest of her beauty regimen. \"I only have to do three things to look halfway decent: Curl my eyelashes, fill in my eyebrows and put some lipstick on,\" she shared.\n\n10 of 46\n\nCOURTENEY COX: NOW\n\nNow: At 58, the actress, who has a daughter with ex David Arquette, has stopped her skincare experiments sticks with a five-minute, 10-product routine she shared on social media.\n\n11 of 46\n\nJULIA ROBERTS: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2000: With her girl-next-door looks and laid-back charm, it's no surprise that the Georgia belle graced five World's Most Beautiful covers (1991, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2017) – a PEOPLE record. In 1993, The New York Times gushed about the Pretty Woman star, writing, \"Her skin is as clear as one of those High Sierra streams where the rare golden trout still swim.\"\n\n12 of 46\n\nJULIA ROBERTS: NOW\n\nNow: How does the actress, 55, keep her famous smile healthy and bright? With baking soda! In general, the busy mom of three has little time for a more complicated beauty routine. \"I'm happy if I have on moisturizer and ChapStick,\" she told InStyle.\n\n13 of 46\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2001: Zeta-Jones has made no secret that looking good takes effort. \"I think beauty is a gift that you have to make the most of,\" she said. \"I've worked hard at trying to look my best.\" She had a little help: night moisturizer. \"Sometimes I look like a seal because I'm so lathered in the stuff.\"\n\n14 of 46\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES: NOW\n\nNow: At 53, Zeta-Jones is still a stunner. She told Australian Vogue, \"[and] with a little help from our friends, it makes it even better.\" Those \"friends\" include the honey and sugar she uses to moisturize and exfoliate her entire body. \"You wash it off and your skin is gorgeous,\" she said.\n\n15 of 46\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2002: \"I was the plain one,\" proclaimed Kidman, talking about growing up with a younger brunette sister. By the time the Oscar winner graced PEOPLE's cover, she knew her porcelain skin was an asset. \"Nicole won't even cross the road without a hat,\" said pal Naomi Watts. \"She's really disciplined about that and it pays off. Her skin is like a perfect china cup.\"\n\n16 of 46\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN: NOW\n\nNow: Happily married since 2006 to country star Keith Urban, with whom she has two girls, the 55-year-old actress still makes suncare a priority. \"It is the worst thing in terms of aging,\" she told Marie Claire, \"so I wear a lot of sunscreen, and I never go in the sun.\"\n\n17 of 46\n\nHALLE BERRY: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2003: The star who'd made history the year before as the first Black woman to win the Best Actress Oscar (for Monster's Ball) described herself as \"very imperfect but okay with my imperfections.\"\n\n18 of 46\n\nHALLE BERRY: NOW\n\nNow: When does the 56-year-old mom of two think she looks her best? \"I feel the most beautiful whenever I'm doing things that I love,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I love work, I love being around children, I love reading.\"\n\n19 of 46\n\nANGELINA JOLIE: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2006: When she was featured on PEOPLE's cover, Jolie had already distinguished herself as a humanitarian who regularly went on missions to developing countries, distributing food to the hungry, even sleeping on frozen ground after a hard day's work. Her beauty regimen was just as un-diva-like: a little face powder, mascara and a dab of Vaseline on her lips.\n\n20 of 46\n\nANGELINA JOLIE: NOW\n\nNow: Jolie, 47, has continued traveling the world as a special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \"I am a proud American and I am an internationalist,\" the actress and mom of six said during a March 2017 speech for the UNHCR. \"I believe anyone committed to human rights is. It means seeing the world with a sense of fairness and humility and recognizing our own humanity in the struggles of others.\" She even headed to England to teach a master's class at the London School of Economics' Centre for Women, Peace and Security.\n\n21 of 46\n\nDREW BARRYMORE: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2007: Saying she felt most beautiful \"right after I've worked out and I'm sweating all over the place,\" the former child star described the happy results: \"I feel like I've changed the shape of my body temporarily into something more flexible and strong.\"\n\n22 of 46\n\nDREW BARRYMORE: NOW\n\nNow: The actress, 48, who's mom to daughters Olive and Frankie, has added even more titles to her credits: businesswoman and talk show host. In 2013 she started a cosmetics line called Flower and spends time doling out beauty tips. And her eponymous daytime talk show continues to be a hit.\n\n23 of 46\n\nCHRISTINA APPLEGATE: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2009: After being diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing a double mastectomy a year earlier, the actress was learning to appreciate her new body: \"I don't have to wear a bra!\" she said. \"And the gals look good in tank tops.\" Helping her heal: then-boyfriend Martyn LeNoble, who made her feel \"beautiful.\"\n\n24 of 46\n\nCHRISTINA APPLEGATE: NOW\n\nNow: Applegate, 51, who once told Cosmopolitan, \"I never looked in the mirror and thought I was a pretty girl,\" married LeNoble (with whom she has daughter, Sadie) in February 2013. Also in 2013, she returned to the big screen in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. Her series Dead to Me was her latest hit, though she has stepped back from work a bit since being diagnosed with MS in 2021.\n\n25 of 46\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2011: Then a judge on American Idol and married to Marc Anthony, Lopez said she was \"at my happiest\" when home with her husband and their toddler twins. \"Just being able to touch my face and rub my eyes and put my fingers in my hair and not having to worry about messing it up. It's so much better.\" She also reminded readers that looking good is \"part of my job,\" saying the workouts, portion control and beauty regimen could be tough. \"I don't want anybody thinking it's easy. It does take time and it's hard work. HDTV wide-screen is nobody's friend!\"\n\n26 of 46\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ: NOW\n\nNow: Lopez's \"toddlers\" are full-blown kids at age 14, she starred in the Valentine's Day rom-com Marry Me, she wrapped up a successful Las Vegas residency and she's happily married to Ben Affleck. \"I've never been better,\" the 53-year-old told PEOPLE in 2022. \"It's just that we're all in a very beautiful moment.\"\n\n27 of 46\n\nBEYONCÉ: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2012: \"I feel more beautiful than I've ever felt because I've given birth,\" Beyoncé, then a new mom to daughter Blue Ivy, told PEOPLE. \"I have never felt so connected, never felt like I had such a purpose on this earth.\"\n\n28 of 46\n\nBEYONCÉ: NOW\n\nNow: A mom of three and married to JAY-Z for 15 years, Bey runs the world, holding the record for most Grammy Awards won by a woman. The 41-year-old earned her first Oscar nomination last year, too, for the King Richard song, \"Be Alive.\"\n\n29 of 46\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2013: That year, Paltrow was promoting her new cookbook, It's All Good, her new film, Iron Man 3, and her partnership with trainer Tracy Anderson. The mom-of-two (and wife of Coldplay's Chris Martin) was also feeling happy and healthy. \"I'm more in proportion now than I was when I was 20, so I feel better in a bathing suit now than I did before I had kids,\" she said. \"But I think one of the most beautiful things about growing up is this self-acceptance that starts to happen.\" Her tips for staying beautiful included taking a nightly bath and washing her face with a hot washcloth.\n\n30 of 46\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW: NOW\n\nNow: The 50-year-old has majorly grown her footprint in the lifestyle space thanks to her website and newsletter goop, which expanded into a skincare line and beyond. Though she consciously uncoupled from Martin, the two remain some of Hollywood's friendliest exes and co-parents, and in 2014, she moved on with producer Brad Falchuk. She also continues to induce #FOMO with her Instagram account, which chronicles her travels — and delicious meals.\n\n31 of 46\n\nLUPITA NYONG'O: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2014: She stunned on red carpet after red carpet during awards season, eventually nabbing the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for 12 Years a Slave. Being named World's Most Beautiful, Nyong'o hoped she would help to challenge antiquated perceptions of beauty. \"It was exciting and just a major, major compliment,\" she said of the title. \"I was happy for all the girls who would see me on [the cover] and feel a little more seen.\"\n\n32 of 46\n\nLUPITA NYONG'O: NOW\n\nNow: Her career hasn't stopped since: The 40-year-old is a part of the Star Wars resurgence, starring in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. She's also lent her voice to the live action adaption of The Jungle Book, and made her Broadway debut in the play Eclipsed.\n\n33 of 46\n\nSANDRA BULLOCK: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2015: When she was named PEOPLE's Most Beautiful Woman in 2015, the actress simply laughed. \"No, really. I just said, 'That's ridiculous,'\" she told PEOPLE. What really makes Bullock feel beautiful is her role as mother to her son, Louis. \"What is beautiful is the honor of being Louis' mother,\" she said.\n\n34 of 46\n\nSANDRA BULLOCK: NOW\n\nNow: Bullock has her hands full at home – she welcomed a sibling for son Louis, daughter Laila, in 2015. \"When I look at Laila, there's no doubt in my mind that she was supposed to be here,\" the 58-year-old told PEOPLE of her daughter. She returned to the big screen in The Lost City before announcing she'd be taking a little break to spend more time with her kids.\n\n35 of 46\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON: THEN\n\nMost Beautiful 2004 & 2016: Aniston, who'd just wrapped up her wildly successful sitcom Friends when she landed on the cover of PEOPLE as the WMB for the first time, confessed to plastering on makeup in her younger, more insecure days. When she finally stopped, \"I'd have people say, 'God, you look so much better.'\"\n\nWhen she was honored with the title for the second time in 2016, Aniston defined beauty as: \"Inner confidence. Peace. Kindness. Honesty. A life well-lived. Taking on challenges and not feeling shame for things that haven't gone the way you felt they should have. And not feeling like a failure or allowing people to critique your life and make you feel like you've failed at something. That's just toxic noise.\"\n\n36 of 46\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON: NOW\n\nNow: Aniston returned to the small screen in the Apple TV+ hit, The Morning Show, and reunited with her best Friends on an HBO Max special about the series. \"I'm in a really peaceful place. I have a job that I love, I have people in my life who are everything to me, and I have beautiful dogs,\" the 54-year-old told PEOPLE in 2021. \"I'm just a very fortunate and blessed human being.\"\n\n37 of 46\n\nPINK: THEN\n\nBeautiful Issue 2018: Pink — and her two kids, Willow, 6, and Jameson, 16 months — graced the cover of PEOPLE's newly renamed \"The Beautiful Issue\" in 2018. Her key to the happiness that she radiates? \"Try not to take life too terribly seriously,\" she said. \"We laugh a lot. It's all about our family unit and time spent together, and much less about external stuff.\"\n\n38 of 46\n\nPINK: NOW\n\nNow: The proud mama, 43, has watched as her daughter has shared her own voice with fans on social media, and recently announced she'll be hitting the stage again herself at the 2022 Ohana Festival in California.\n\n39 of 46\n\nJENNIFER GARNER: THEN\n\nBeautiful Issue 2019: The actress opened up about the beauty in motherhood — her favorite job — and her time with kids Violet, Seraphina and Samuel with ex Ben Affleck. \"I'm starting to get to the point where I realize this job is not going to be forever,\" she shared. \"Not in the all-encompassing every meal, every moment, every day way that I have loved for the last thirteen years. It's going to shift. But there's beauty in how it works in episodes.\"\n\n40 of 46\n\nJENNIFER GARNER: NOW\n\nNow: An Instagram favorite, the 51-year-old spoke to PEOPLE in 2021 about continuing to come into her own. \"I've learned that I'm pretty sturdy,\" she said. \"I'm okay when I'm in the house by myself. I'm okay when it's just the kids and me. I'm okay when they fall apart. I mean I have my moments, but pretty much, I'm really okay.\"\n\n41 of 46\n\nKATE HUDSON & GOLDIE HAWN\n\nMost Beautiful 2008 (Kate) and Beautiful Issue 2020: Natural beauty Hudson confessed to PEOPLE at the time of her first cover, \"I don't even remember the last time I got a manicure.\" Her priority: spending free time with then-5-year-old son Ryder rather than in a salon. Still, when she did get a facial or leg waxing, \"I always think, 'I should do this more often.'\"\n\nIn 2020, she graced the cover again, this time with mom Goldie Hawn and tot daughter Rani Rose, whom she shares with fiancé Danny Fujikawa. \"My mom gave me the floor to be able to feel confident enough to go out and feel like my life could be my own,\" said Kate. \"Mom was my greatest cheerleader. And it just made me think about Rani…going, 'I hope I give her that kind of confidence,' you know?\"\n\n42 of 46\n\nKATE HUDSON & GOLDIE HAWN: NOW\n\nNow: The women are closer than ever, frequently posting about each other on Instagram and watching Rani grow. \"We all need to have an open mind and feel good about what we're doing and let other people live the way they want to live,\" Hudson, 44, told PEOPLE of motherhood.\n\n43 of 46\n\nCHRISSY TEIGEN: THEN\n\nBeautiful Issue 2021: Teigen followed the family trend by posing with her kids, Luna and Miles Stephens, with husband John Legend, and doing a second cover with her mom, Vilailuck. \"It's more important for me to enjoy things as they come. I put my mind and spirit over body. If it's going to make me happy and make me feel good, then I indulge in it,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I've spent too many years counting calories and scheduling way too many workouts and trying to figure out what my term for wellness was for myself. Now I know it's on the ground playing with my kids or going to a park or an aquarium.\"\n\n45 of 46\n\nHELEN MIRREN: THEN\n\nBeautiful Issue 2022: When Dame Helen Mirren learned she'd been chosen as the cover star of PEOPLE's 2022 Beautiful Issue, \"I was absolutely sort of gobstruck, as we say in England. I never considered myself 'beautiful.' And [at] my age! So I was amazed,\" the Oscar winner, 76, said. \"Most of us are not beautiful. We have other stuff, which is just as powerful as beauty. And I would like to see us celebrate those things … I love the word swagger because I think swagger means I'm confident in myself, I'm presenting myself to the world, I'm enjoying the world around me. I think what is called the beauty industry should be called the swagger industry. We're giving people swagger.\""
