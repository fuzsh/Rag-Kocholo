your own unusual girl name\n\nIf you really love a baby girl name you've seen but want to make it your own cool girl name by adding a unique or unusual twist, you might want to create your own unique name for your baby girl. Take a name like Alexandra, there are so many ways you can adjust the spelling or add/remove letters to make this more unusual to create a name like Alexandria, Alexina or Alexandrina.\n\nOr, you could make it more unique by swapping a letter around or changing the first letter. For instance, make Elisha - Elisya, Jemma - Jemmi, or Diamond - Diamon. If there are two names you can't decide between, which both have a lovely meaning behind them that you'd just love to have for your baby's name, you could try to combine the two names, either with a hyphen or experimenting with the spelling.\n\nThe wonder of giving your baby a more unusual name is that you can be creative and work from a starting point to create a name that is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nYou can try this with so many other names, so why not have a play around with names that you like to try and come up with a unique alternative.\n\nDon’t worry if your due date is fast approaching and you still haven’t found a name that feels like the one. Head to our baby name generator where you’ll find thousands of names to fall in love with, from more traditional sounding names, to unique baby names from all around the world.\n\nLorna White is the Senior Digital Writer for Mother&Baby.
