        "text": "Humor Is Sexy\n\nHumor is attractive to men and women — but not in the same way.\n\nThe research shows women like men who make them laugh, and men like women who laugh at their jokes.\n\nVia Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love:\n\nWhy is humor sexy? Funny people are smart, and smart is sexy.\n\nVia Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love:\n\nSo ladies can boost their attractiveness by chuckling a bit more.\n\nAnd guys, you can garner more attention by learning how to make women laugh.\n\nVia Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love:\n\nBeing Liked Is Sexy\n\nWant to increase someone’s interest in you? Might be worthwhile to make sure they find out you’re interested in them.\n\nVia How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less:\n\nThis idea is affirmed by studying the effectiveness of “playing hard to get.” What’s the best way to play that game?\n\nEstablish that you’re hard to get in general — but very enthusiastic about the person you’re with.\n\nVia Richard Wiseman’s excellent book 59 Seconds: Change Your Life in Under a Minute:\n\nWhat You Talk About Is Sexy\n\nRandom conversation with someone you’re interested in can be a bad idea. Why? What you talk about can matter — a lot.\n\nEmotional, personal information exchange promotes powerful feelings of connection.\n\nVia Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You:\n\nHow effective is it? In under an hour it can create a connection stronger than a lifelong friendship.\n\nVia Click: The Magic of Instant Connections:\n\n(You can read the most effective things to discuss here.)\n\nThat said, don’t get so nervous about your words that you can’t speak…\n\nWhen a woman is very attracted to a man, whether his pickup line is good or not doesn’t matter at all.\n\nVia Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love:\n\nPersonality Is Sexy\n\nConscientiousness is predictive of a number of very important positive elements in life.\n\nAgreeable, conscientious people make better spouses and parents — but disagreeable, non-conscientious people have more sex partners.\n\nThe former invest in quality, and it seems like the latter make up the difference in, well, volume.\n\nLooking to settle down? Check if that person has their ducks in a row, is organized and easy to get along with. That’s marriage material.\n\nVia Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love:\n\nHow They Make You Feel Is Sexy\n\nResearch shows we don’t really fall in love with a person — we fall in love with how we feel when we’re with them.\n\nThis is best demonstrated by the concept of emotional contagion: we’re bad at telling what made us feel a certain way, but good about making associations.\n\nFeeling excited, stimulated and aroused is often associated with the people around us, even if they’re not the cause.\n\nThis can be taken to extremes: having someone try to kill you can actually make you more attracted to them.\n\nVia The Heart of Social Psychology: A Backstage View of a Passionate Science:\n\nSome might find the notion that we’re just “feeling junkies” un-romantic, butthis idea can save relationships and prevent divorce.\n\nBy doing things that rekindle those exciting feelings, love can be restored:\n\nLove At First Sight Is Sexy\n\nThere’s still a lot about love and sex that can’t be easily quantified. Studies show “love at first sight” is real.\n\nVia How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less:\n\nHow can you increase the chance love at first sight happens to you? By believing in it.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nOther posts you should read on love, sex, and romance:\n\nHow To Be A Good Kisser – 10 Tips From Scientific Research\n\nHow To Flirt — Backed By Scientific Research\n\nHow To Make Someone Fall In Love With You\n\nRecipe For A Happy Marriage: The 7 Scientific Secrets\n\nJoin 45K+ readers.
