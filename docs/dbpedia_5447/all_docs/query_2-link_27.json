        "text": "CHICAGO (June 26, 2024) – U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 18-player roster plus four alternates for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Just eight players who were on the USA’s roster for the 2020 Olympics (which was played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) make a return this summer while 10 players who were members of the USA’s 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup Team were named to the final roster for Paris.\n\n2024 U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer Team Roster by Position (Caps/Goals):\n\nGOALKEEPERS (2): Casey Murphy (North Carolina Courage; 19), Alyssa Naeher (Chicago Red Stars; 104)\n\nDEFENDERS (6): Tierna Davidson (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 58/3), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 49/1), Naomi Girma (San Diego Wave FC; 32/0), Casey Krueger (Washington Spirit; 49/0), Jenna Nighswonger (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 9/2), Emily Sonnett (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 91/2)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (5): Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA; 11/0), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 17/1), Lindsey Horan (Olympique Lyon, FRA; 148/35), Rose Lavelle (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 100/24), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 19/8)\n\nFORWARDS (5):Crystal Dunn (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 147/25), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit; 38/7), Jaedyn Shaw (San Diego Wave FC; 14/7), Sophia Smith (Portland Thorns FC; 48/19), Mallory Swanson (Chicago Red Stars; 92/34)\n\nAlternates: Goalkeeper JaneCampbell, midfielder Hal Hershfelt, midfielder Croix Bethune and forward Lynn Williams.\n\n“Making an Olympic roster is a huge privilege and an honor and there is no denying that it was an extremely competitive process among the players and that there were difficult choices, especially considering how hard everyone has worked over the past 10 months,” said Hayes. “Choosing an 18-player roster plus alternates involved many considerations, but I am excited for the group we have selected and I’m looking forward to building on the work from last camp as we head into the Send-Off matches and then onto France. These are great opportunities for us to continue to show the progress we are making.”\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer Team will come together for the first time on July 8 in New Jersey in preparation to face Mexico on July 13 (3:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV, Telemundo, Universo, Max and Peacock) at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J in the Impact 99 Legacy Match, presented by New York Life. The USA will then head to the nation’s capital for the 2024 Send-Off Match, presented by Coca-Cola, on July 16 against Costa Rica at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. (7:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV, Universo, Max and Peacock).\n\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, the eighth Olympic Games to feature women’s soccer, the U.S. will open Group B play on July 25 – one day before the Opening Ceremonies – against Zambia (9 p.m. local / 3 p.m. ET) at Stade de Nice in Nice. The Americans will then play Germany on July 28 (9 p.m. local / 3 p.m. ET) at Marseille’s Stade de Marseille in their second match and finish group play against Australia on July 31 (7 p.m. local / 1 p.m. ET), also in Marseille. Located in the south of France, Nice is nearly 600 miles from Paris near France’s border with Monaco and Italy. Marseille, located 125 miles west of Nice, is the second-largest city in France.\n\nPrior to the naming of this roster, 19 USWNT players had previously made three or more Olympic Teams. Add to that list three-time Olympians Alyssa Naeher, Crystal Dunn and Lindsey Horan.\n\nDefenders Tierna Davidson, Emily Sonnett and Casey Krueger, midfielders Rose Lavelle and Catarina Macario and forward Mallory Swanson make their second Olympic Teams. Krueger and Macario were initially named as alternates for the 2020 Olympics, but when rosters were expanded from 18 to 22 due to the pandemic, they were officially added to the team. Each played a few minutes in one match. Swanson was not named to the Olympic roster in 2021 but did play in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil at the age of 18.\n\nThe first-time Olympians are goalkeeper Casey Murphy, defenders Emily Fox, Naomi Girma and Jenna Nighswonger, midfielders Korbin Albert and Sam Coffey and forwards Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Jaedyn Shaw. For Nighswonger, Albert, Coffey and Shaw, the 2024 Paris Olympics will be their first senior level world championship.\n\nHayes also named four alternate players who will travel to France and train with the team for the duration of the Olympics in goalkeeper Jane Campbell, uncapped midfielders Hal Hershfelt and Croix Bethune and forward Lynn Williams. Campbell was also the alternate goalkeeper for the 2020 Olympics in Japan before being moved to the active roster due to the Covid-19 roster expansion. Both Hershfelt and Bethune came into their first USWNT camp in June - which was also the first camp for Hayes – Bethune as a training player and Hershfelt as a member of the full roster, though she did not see action in either match against Korea Republic. Williams was a member of the USA’s 2020 Olympic Team and 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup Team. She is by far the most experienced alternate with 63 caps and 18 career goals. Williams, the all-time leading scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League, scored in the 2020 Olympic quarterfinal against the Netherlands.\n\nThe USA won the inaugural Olympic gold medal for women’s soccer in 1996 in Atlanta, won silver in 2000 in Sydney and then won three straight golds, standing atop the podium in Athens, Greece in 2004, Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012. The USA fell in the quarterfinals in penalty kicks in 2016 and earned a bronze medal in 2021. The USWNT is 24W-4L-7D all-time in Olympic competition.\n\n2024 U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer Team Roster Notes:"
