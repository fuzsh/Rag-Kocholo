        "text": "The Most Beautiful Woman in Town & Other Stories is a collection of anecdotal short stories by American author Charles Bukowski. The stories are written in both the first and third-person, in Bukowski's trademark semi-autobiographical short prose style. In keeping with his other works, themes include: Los Angeles bar culture; alcoholism; gambling; sex and violence. However, many of the stories contain elements of fantasy and surrealism. The book was initially printed as Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness [citation needed]. The stories originally appeared in Open City, Nola Express, Knight, Adam, Adam Reader, Pix, The Berkeley Barb and Evergreen Review.\n\nContents\n\n[edit]\n\nKid Stardust on the Porterhouse\n\nLife in a Texas Whorehouse\n\nSix Inches\n\nThe Fuck Machine\n\nThe Gut-Wringing Machine\n\n3 Women\n\n3 Chickens\n\nTen Jack-Offs\n\nTwelve Flying Monkeys Who Won't Copulate Properly\n\n25 Bums in Rags\n\nNon-Horseshit Horse Advice\n\nAnother Horse Story\n\nThe Birth, Life and Death of an Underground Newspaper\n\nLife and Death in the Charity Ward\n\nThe Day We Talked About James Thurber\n\nAll the Great Writers\n\nThe Copulating Mermaid of Venice, Calif\n\nTrouble with a Battery\n\n(swastika symbol)\n\nPolitics is like Trying to Screw a Cat in the Ass\n\nMy Big-Assed Mother\n\nA Lovely Love Affair\n\nAll the Pussy We Want\n\nThe Beginner\n\nThe Fiend\n\nThe Murder of Ramon Vasquez\n\nA Drinking Partner\n\nThe White Beard\n\nA White Pussy\n\nTrivia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the film The Rules of Attraction the book can be seen in the drawer of Sean Bateman's room."
