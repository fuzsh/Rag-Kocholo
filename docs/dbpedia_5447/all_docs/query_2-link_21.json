        "text": "International Women's Day 2024 campaign theme is 'Inspire Inclusion'\n\nThe campaign theme for International Women's Day 2024 was Inspire Inclusion.\n\nWhen we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world.\n\nAnd when women themselves are inspired to be included, there's a sense of belonging, relevance, and empowerment.\n\nCollectively, let's forge a more inclusive world for women.\n\nRead more about a definition of what it means to inspire inclusion here.\n\nIWD belongs to all who care about women's equality\n\nWith well over a century of history and change, the first International Women's Day (IWD) was held in March 1911. IWD isn't country, group or organization specific. It's a day of collective global activism and celebration that belongs to all those committed to forging women's equality.\n\nWorld-renowned feminist, journalist and activist, Gloria Steinem, reportedly once explained:\n\n\"The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organization but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights.\"\n\nSo together, let's all help fight the good fight. All IWD activity is valid, that's what makes IWD so inclusive. Join in and make IWD your day by doing what you can to support and advance women.\n\nCommitting to inspire inclusion\n\nWhen women aren't present, we must ask: \"If not, why not?\"\n\nWhen women are discriminated against, we must call out poor practice.\n\nWhen the treatment of women is not equitable, we must take action.\n\nAnd we must do this each time, every time.\n\nEveryone everywhere can inspire inclusion\n\nOrganizations, groups, and individuals worldwide can all play a part - in the community, at work, at home, and beyond.\n\nTo truly include women means to openly embrace their diversity of race, age, ability, faith, body image, and how they identify. Worldwide, women must be included in all fields of endeavour.\n\nHow will you continue to inspire inclusion?\n\nOn an individual basis, it's important to understand, value and seek out the inclusion of women and girls. Additionally, sharing this knowledge, support and encouragement with others is key.\n\nOn an organizational or group basis, there are many ways to ensure the needs, interests and aspirations of women and girls are valued and included. Organizations and groups continue to #InspireInclusion throughout the year in areas such as:\n\nforging women's economic empowerment\n\nrecruiting, retaining and developing diverse talent\n\nsupporting women and girls into leadership, decision-making, business and STEM\n\ndesigning and building infrastructure meeting the needs of women and girls\n\nhelping women and girls make informed decisions about their health\n\ninvolving women and girls in sustainable agriculture and food security\n\nproviding women and girls with access to quality education and training\n\nelevating women and girl's participation and achievement in sport\n\npromoting creative and artistic talent of women and girls\n\naddressing further areas supporting the advancement of women and girls\n\nStrike the #InspireInclusion pose\n\nAre you in? Will you inspire inclusion?\n\nStrike the #InspireInclusion pose to show solidarity. When we truly value difference, inclusion comes from the heart.\n\nInspire others to help forge an inclusive world by sharing your #InspireInclusion image across social media throughout the year using #IWD2024 #InspireInclusion.\n\nSubmit an #InspireInclusion image and statement here.\n\nBuild on IWD's century-plus history\n\nRemember, all IWD activity is valid.\n\nCollectively, anyone can participate through whatever activity is most relevant and impactful for their own context.\n\nEveryone everywhere can build on IWD's century-plus history to help forge positive change for women and girls.\n\nThat's why IWD is inclusive, not exclusive.\n\nStep forward in solidarity\n\nCollectively, let's continue to #InspireInclusion for women and girls everywhere.\n\nElevate your commitment to inspiring inclusion\n\nSend in your #InspireInclusion images to potentially be featured in the IWD Gallery.\n\nShare your #InspireInclusion resources\n\nInterested in providing relevant professional resources that support the #InspireInclusion campaign?\n\nSubmissions are invited throughout the year from suitable partners worldwide for white papers, articles, reports, tools, resources, projects, campaigns, activities, artistic creations, videos and more that support the #InspireInclusion campaign as useful references, to be co-published on the International Women's Day website. Help others #InspireInclusion through your resources.\n\nFurther details and specifications are available upon request."
