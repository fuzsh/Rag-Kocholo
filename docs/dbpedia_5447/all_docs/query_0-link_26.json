        "text": "Which country in the world is home to the most beautiful women? This question is categorically impossible to answer. For starters, it is safe to say that no matter what a woman's appearance, she is beautiful. The concept of beauty is far too all-encompassing for any other condition to be true. Secondly, each individual person has his or her own unique perception of beauty. One person may find a particular hair or eye color to be the most attractive. Another may prefer a certain skin tone or body shape. A third may feel that true attractiveness lies in a woman's physical appearance, but in her compassionate heart, her sense of humor, or her love of dancing. All of these views—as well as billions or other possible concepts of beauty—are accurate for the particular person who holds them. But all are also uniquely personal. There exists no ubiquitous or universal definition of beauty, and so there can be no universally applicable list of countries with the most beautiful women.\n\nThat said, media outlets continue to attempt to answer the question anyway. The ranking methodology varies from source to source, though none could be considered scientific. Beauty-pageant-focused website missosology.org took arguably the most statistical approach and compiled the number of points each country had scored in international beauty pageants (Miss Universe, World, Earth, International, and Supranational). Other listmakers compared celebrity beauties from each country or simply relied upon the writer's personal preferences. A sampling of the results appears below, with a more robust table at the end of this article.\n\nTop 10 Countries with the Most Beautiful Women (various sources)\n\nRankMissosologyScoopWhoopDefinitionBScholarly1VenezuelaBrazilItalyTurkey2PhilippinesUkraineUnited KingdomBrazil3MexicoSouth KoreaBoliviaFrance4South AfricaDenmarkCanadaRussia5VietnamColombiaIndiaItaly6ThailandRussiaPhilippinesIndia7Puerto RicoVenezuelaNetherlandsVenezuela8IndonesiaItalySwedenUnited States9ColombiaNetherlandsBulgariaSweden10United StatesCanadaArgentinaUkraine\n\nMost beautiful women: Country profiles\n\nBrazil, Colombia, and Venezuela\n\nLatin women are known worldwide for their beauty, and the fact that many of them live in the sun-kissed tropics does nothing to make them seem less exotic. Venezuela ranks near the top of most lists of this nature, Brazil could arguably be called the home of the supermodel (Gisele Bündchen, Adriana Lima, actress Morena Baccarin), and Colombia has given the world such internationally known beauties as Shakira and Sofia Vergara.\n\nRussia and Ukraine\n\nWhile the weather in Russia may be brutal, cold, and unforgiving at times, beauty can melt many things, and the women of Russia seemingly never fail to display a warmth that easily overcomes the sometimes harsh climate. Similarly, neighboring Ukraine has produced more than its share of tall and picturesque beauties, more than a few of whom have graced the pages of publications like Vogue and Prada.\n\nFrance and Italy\n\nNo list of countries with the most beautiful women would be complete without adding the belle femmes of France. Known for being a land of love, romance, and poetry, France is home to a great many beautiful women, such as legendarily sexy actresses Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, and Marion Cotillard. Like France, Italy is known for both its cuisine and its seemingly endless supply of strong, passionate, vivacious women, including the stunning Monica Bellucci, Sophia Loren, and Isabella Rossellini.\n\nThe United States, Turkey, and Sweden\n\nOften called the \"Great American Melting Pot\" thanks to its origin as a nation of immigrants and refugees, the United States is home to beautiful women with a dizzying array of ethnicities and nationalities. Whatever traits one might view as beautiful, America is virtually guaranteed to have an abundance of women who display it. Perhaps one of the greatest secrets Turkey has is that this Eurasian country is rich with beautiful women. Finally, while not all Swedish women fit the stereotype of having blonde hair and blue eyes, they are undeniably beautiful, as evidenced by examples including early movie star Ingrid Bergman, singer Tove Lo, and actress Malin Ackerman."
