        "text": "One day recently, David (my hubby) and I were having a conversation about why men don’t call and how women chronically over analyse things when he doesn’t call.\n\nThis conversation made me laugh in amusement, as it clearly highlighted the differences between women and men when it comes to talking on the phone or initiating phone calls.\n\nI laughed in amusement because no matter how many times I have a new realisation (about how different a masculine man is to a feminine woman), it’s still always funny.\n\nIt’s funny because what’s reality for a man is reality for a man.\n\nAnd what is reality for a woman is reality for a woman.\n\nWhat’s silly is how both sexes try to make each other the same.\n\nI do stop laughing quickly though. Because although it’s funny, incredible pain and suffering comes for the men and women who try to make their partner the same as them.\n\nWe all make this mistake to some extent: we want a partner with the opposite sexual energy to our own, yet every day we do things to try to make our boyfriend or girlfriend the same as us.\n\nBottom line:\n\nAs women we expect men to think like women.\n\nThat’s like asking a whale to think like a giraffe.\n\nOne is a sea animal and the other is a land animal. That fact alone makes their motivations different. It makes their daily lives different!\n\n(By the way, on the topic of feminine energy, you can do my quiz to find out how feminine you are deep down in your core. I’ve carefully designed these 9 questions to show you exactly how much you are living in your feminine energy and what it really means for you.)\n\nDo our feminine energy quiz: how feminine am i really?\n\nSo Why Don’t Men Call More Often?\n\nIt’s because of the following reasons…\n\nThey don’t know you need it (and thrive on it).\n\nThey are naturally more detached, and therefore don’t need a lot of phone chatter to fill themselves up or to feel safe in the relationship.\n\nThey’d rather be solving problems than having (what they consider to be) pointless conversations.\n\nLastly, he may not be interested in pursuing anything more with you.\n\nUltimately it’s up to you to work out which one of these reasons it is. If you truly believe that he doesn’t contact you because he isn’t interested in being in a relationship with you (and you need closure), then here’s some closure for you now…\n\nThe most basic answer I can give you is that there wasn’t enough attraction between the two of you in order for him to break out of his man-world to pursue a long term relationship with you.\n\nAttraction and connection are what it takes for a man to commit further to a steady relationship.\n\nWithout those two things, a relationship serves no purpose for a good, masculine man. Other than to drain his time and resources.\n\n(…Even one woman can take all a man’s emotional and mental resources).\n\nWhy Do Guys Never Initiate Contact?\n\nRemember this: relationships are the domain of the feminine, which means that even though it makes sense to you as a woman to initiate contact and to want to talk, bond and attach – it doesn’t always come as naturally to men.\n\nThe truth is that guys DO initiate contact, but only if there is enough emotional attraction and emotional connection. If there’s not enough of these two things, it’s not worth his energy.\n\nIn fact, if you find yourself always imitating contact and he really never reciprocates, that’s one of the signs that he doesn’t want a relationship with you.\n\nBut What If He Is Interested And Even Committed?\n\nWell, sometimes, men call very often.\n\nAny woman who has had a man be in love with her knows this.\n\nYet the calling frequency doesn’t last. Not necessarily because he’s no longer in love, but just because the nature of the relationship has changed.\n\nRelated: When He Stops Chasing You & Being Romantic: What To Do?\n\nBut no matter how in love a man is with you, at some point in your relationship with a male (if you want a long term relationship with a male), he’s going to be calling less than you wish he would.\n\nBut it’s not all bad.\n\nReally.\n\nConsider this:\n\nIf you stay together for enough years, and you give each other enough compassion and love, one or both of you will come to understand the other’s needs.\n\nWhat this understanding will do is slowly quash the hurt you feel about him not calling, and the stress you feel around it might occur less frequently.\n\nAlso, his frustration over your need for him to call you may turn in to something he lovingly remembers to do.\n\nKey word; remembers.\n\nYes, calling a woman can be a hell of a lot of memory work and effort for men, especially after the initial crazy-in-love period. And for good reason!\n\nIt’s because men don’t see time the way you do.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, they are more detached overall. That’s their equilibrium, which is different to yours I might add.\n\nFeel free to let out some anger over this if you want.\n\nFeel free to even hate me for delivering this information, I understand the magnitude of which this absolutely sucks.\n\nBut like many things that initially suck initially, if you respect them rather than resist them, they also eventually increase your own courage and strength.\n\nIt’s OK To Feel Angry About It\n\nYou letting out your anger might not change the fact that calling is work for men, but at least it will lower your stress hormones over this and allow you to relax.\n\nAfter doing that, I do invite you to come back and read.\n\nMy conversation with my husband David went (something like) this:\n\nME: SO many women have this problem of a man not calling them. *sigh in compassion and understanding for women*\n\nDAVID: Looks at me.\n\nME: Look at him.\n\nPause.\n\nDAVID: Well the reason men don’t call is obvious.\n\nME: Ok…so why?\n\nDAVID: Because he is doing something important. (Insert serious face)\n\nPause.\n\nHe turns back to his emails and computer screen.\n\nI start giggling.\n\nHe turns back to me.\n\nHe smiles.\n\nME: “BUT. From a woman’s perspective, we’re quietly thinking, what could be more important than calling me???!!!!” (insert poor me face).\n\nDAVID: Smirks. Then he smiled and said “Women!”\n\nDo the quiz: how commitment friendly is my man?\n\nBut Can’t He Be More Considerate Of MY Needs?\n\nAs a woman, reading this, right now…you’re probably thinking:\n\n“He’s doing something important. So what? What the hell does that mean. That’s besides the point. I’m hurting here. How insensitive of him!!”\n\nAnd I’m here to suggest this to you:\n\nWhat my husband said is every bit the point.\n\nAt least from a man’s perspective.\n\nHe didn’t mean: ‘you are not important.’ or ‘the woman is not important’.\n\nAlthough him not calling does give that feeling to a woman.\n\nHe means the man was doing something important to him.\n\nWhat David meant when he said men don’t call because he’s doing something important, is this:\n\nHe CAN’T call you because of these reasons:\n\nMen tend to operate visually\n\nHe is used to you sounding unhappy on the phone\n\nHe simply doesn’t value calling as much as you do\n\nWhat’s important in a man’s world can feel like life or death in his world.\n\nIntimate relationship is not the masculine priority (and thank goodness. Otherwise would they still be men?)\n\nHow YOU as a woman view it is different to how HE sees it\n\nNow let’s talk about these reasons.\n\nMen Tend To Operate Visually…\n\nSo it’s hard to talk to you on the phone therefore, he’s not that motivated to call.\n\nThis isn’t about men being pervs. It’s about men being programmed for 84,000 generations to be hunters…men generally operate best through their visual senses, NOT their auditory senses.\n\nTalking on the phone is an auditory act…he can’t flow with it as well as you can.\n\n(And even if it looks like he can, it takes a lot more energy away from him than it takes from you. Because it doesn’t recharge his masculine core as much as it recharges your feminine core.)\n\nWomen have been using their auditory senses for that 84,000 generations or more to talk to each other. We like the phone, we can spend ages on the phone just babbling.\n\nMen usually use the phone to get from A to B.\n\nA and B could be something related to work or it could be related to organising a date, or to get a piece of information, or to deliver information.\n\nIf the PHONE helps a man get from A to B then it suddenly becomes the best thing in the world.\n\nSECRETS REVEALED… Discover how you too can use this little known “Dark Feminine Art” to weed out the toxic men whilst cultivating real emotional attraction with high value high esteemed men.

This is the process of pair bonding.\n\nClick here to know how to stay high value when when he pulls away.\n\nWhat’s ‘Important’ In A Man’s World Can Feel Like Life Or Death In His World\n\nAnd let me add, what is IMPORTANT in a man’s mind CAN be the difference between life and death. For him.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen a man is focused on business or anything related to the progression of his rank in society (sports, work, entrepreneurial related tasks); it IS life or death.\n\nI’m not 100% sure men would describe it the way that I have since I am a female, but that’s how I’m describing it to you in order to help you understand.\n\nIt’s that important to him. But it doesn’t mean YOU are not important.\n\nIntimate Relationship Is Not The Masculine Priority.\n\n‘Relationship’ in this case refers to calling you to show that he cares. He often just forgets to call, and he does not have any bad intent when he forgets.\n\nDo YOU have bad intentions when you make him and you late to a party because you spent 3 hours getting ready?\n\nI’ll just remind you of that again: he doesn’t have any bad intent when he forgets.\n\nDo you have bad intent when you spend hours getting ready for an important party?\n\nDo you intend to hurt your man by spending too long putting on make up, or doing your hair, and changing your mind about outfits?\n\nThe same lack of bad intent exists when a man is interested in you, but is doing something important.\n\nBut if you really want to know how much he likes you, here’s How To Tell If A Guy Likes You: 6 Signs & 1 Test.\n\nHow YOU As A woman view It Is Different To How HE Sees It\n\nTo a woman, it is RUDE to suggest that you didn’t call because you were doing something important.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we imply meaning in words.\n\nWhen someone says that they were doing something IMPORTANT and that’s why they did not call us, we think they are communicating that something else is more important than US.\n\nWe assume they mean that we are no longer loved in that moment and that person might abandon us.\n\nIt makes women angry.\n\nBut…\n\nIt makes men confused.\n\nA man’s confusion over this is JUST as innocent as a woman’s anger over this.\n\nRelated: Why The Fear Of Abandonment Makes You More Beautiful.\n\nDo the quiz: What is my attachment style?\n\nDon’t Always Imply Negative Intent.\n\nNeither of us have bad intentions with the other person, we are just being a man or being a woman.\n\nThe fact is, if a man doesn’t call for a few days or a week, or just a few hours, AND we are in an established relationship with him, we feel hurt.\n\nBut we only feel hurt because of the meaning we place on his not calling.\n\nRELATIONSHIP for masculine men is not number one.\n\nIt CAN be.\n\nBut I believe that takes time and the building of trust between two people.\n\nIf you want a long term relationship, you must be willing to have patience with a man.\n\nThey are not as instinctively driven to connect as females are. Unless they are actually more feminine inside their physical body.\n\nHere’s Why Men Don’t Put More Effort Into The Relationship?\n\nMy honest belief is that in a committed relationship; for the relationship to work, both people must put each other first.\n\nBut if you don’t put each other first….the other begins to feel less significant and safe in the relationship. This becomes a huge problem.\n\nAnd yet, though I believe this, I believe you have to arrive at this place, after a journey together. You don’t usually start off there. You have to earn each other’s trust.\n\nYou can’t subconsciously demand that of a man 3 months or even a year in to the relationship.\n\nOn the topic of trust, if you find that you are the type of woman who reacts out of anger instead of responding (perhaps due to fears of him abandoning you), then you might want to read my article on abandonment issues.\n\nWhat Does It Mean When He Says He Will Call And Doesn’t?\n\nIt means one of these things:\n\nHe forgot.\n\nHe made a promise he couldn’t fulfil (put another way, he means well, but he just couldn’t fulfil his promise in action).\n\nHe became overwhelmed with work or familial responsibilities.\n\nHe doesn’t want to call you. (Perhaps he’s used to you sounding annoyed and unhappy on the phone, or he’s just not interested.)\n\nWhat Does It Mean If He Only Texts Me And Never Calls?\n\nIt could mean a few things….\n\nHe doesn’t realise (and you haven’t made it clear to him) how much it means to you to call you, so he just assumes it’s not that important to you.\n\nHe prefers to text (because it interrupts him less, requires less commitment and allows him the freedom and space to respond whenever is easiest for him).\n\nHe’s embarrassed or afraid to call.\n\nWorse case scenario: he is already married or seeing someone else, so he can’t invest the time into calling you (or wants to invest as little energy in you as possible whilst still keeping you around).\n\nRemember also that calling someone to talk on the phone is an auditory thing, and a lot of guys are more visual than auditory, so they prefer to talk in person.\n\nSo How Do You Encourage Him To Call More?\n\nThere are many ways to encourage him to call more.\n\nThe one suggestion I will make today is for you to do what is counter intuitive:\n\nENJOY every call he makes. Openly. Enjoy it so he can hear your enjoyment.\n\nWhen he HEARS your enjoyment, he starts to have it ‘click’ in his mind that you actually enjoy it.\n\nThen it becomes a win-win situation in his mind, because he gets to feel successful when he calls you, rather than being told he’s a dick for not calling for a day.\n\nDo you feel like punishing him for not calling?\n\nThen you should read my article on What To Do When He Takes You For Granted.\n\nThis knee-jerk response to punish a man is the common response from women. I’ve worked with enough women to see this pattern.\n\n(It’s no different to men wanting to punish a woman if she stops ‘putting out’).\n\nI’ve also been that woman who punishes (because secretly I was afraid).\n\nBut it doesn’t work.\n\nSo let’s do what works.\n\nLet’s enjoy the call…and that’s any call!\n\nSure it’s counter intuitive, but definitely helps you be a better catch than 99% of women out there.\n\nDo you want answers to the questions you have about men?
