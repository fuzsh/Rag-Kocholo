        "text": "This is actually a good question, social mores would have us say thanks. But anytime I have done so it just feels so odd... why should i be giving thanks? I didn't assembler her, or choose her conglomeration of features. It's a pretty stupid response in every way, I tend to just redirect like \"Your girl is smashable\" \"yea she's chill\"\n\nI also hate how everyone says I'm Sorry when someone dies. I didn't kill them, I am not personally sorry for anything. Therefore I stand by my stock response \"That sucks dude\"\n\nI also hate how everyone says I'm Sorry when someone dies. I didn't kill them, I am not personally sorry for anything. Therefore I stand by my stock response \"That sucks dude\"\n\nThink of it as being shorthand for \"I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\nIt does suck, but I think societal norms indicate you should use a little more tact.\n\nif someone sees a picture of your girl and says shes pretty or hot or whatever.. how do you respond to that? Thank you? that just sounds wrong for some reason.\n\n(1) How does this person see a picture of your girl? did he steal your wallet and look thru your pics? or did you show him a pic, bragging this is your chick?\n\n(2) Thank you is totally appropriate. Along with a .. yes.... yes she is.\n\nfor those who asked how they see it, i sell cell phones and theres a picture of her as my cell wallpaper and on occasion people say that (i occasionally demo my iphone so i can sell them to otherse) and i say thank you and feel odd thanking them for something thats out of my control.. maybe i should just change my wallpaper lol\n\nfor those who asked how they see it, i sell cell phones and theres a picture of her as my cell wallpaper and on occasion people say that (i occasionally demo my iphone so i can sell them to otherse) and i say thank you and feel odd thanking them for something thats out of my control.. maybe i should just change my wallpaper lol\n\nso you are an attention whore....\n\nI also hate how everyone says I'm Sorry when someone dies.

Therefore I stand by my stock response \"That sucks dude\"\n\nI hate it when people I don't know or care about tell me about the deaths of their loved ones. This one time, a guy that lives in my building was doing laundry, and I walked in and started to take my stuff out, and he was like \"Yeah, my daughter died the other day.\" WTF!? Just out of the blue like that \"Yeah, my daughter died\" Do I know you? Why the fuck are you telling me this nonsense? Do you really think I care? Do you think I'm gonna go back to my apartment, lay down in bed and cry because your daughter died? Fuck no! Anyway, I just looked at him and said \"Oh, ok\", and continued taking my stuff out. True story.\n\nDo you really think I care? Do you think I'm gonna go back to my apartment, lay down in bed and cry because your daughter died? Fuck no!

Whenever people tell me someone died, I usually respond with \"oh, that sucks\" and people get really really upset when I say it with a straight face. Maybe my straight face looks like a smile or something."
