        "text": "The word \"aesthetic\" has been gaining a lot of popularity in recent years both on TikTok and in the influencer world, but really, the noun just translates to beautiful, stylish, trendy, or artsy. Just like with everything else, the world of names is becoming more unconventional. From a society where only classic baby names were accepted, the art of naming has evolved into a diverse concept where parents have all the creative freedom they want. And if you're on a quest for aesthetic names for girls, you've come to the right place.\n\nAlthough there are certain names that are illegal for newborn babies around the world (including Queen and Christ), there are still plenty of aesthetic baby names for girls that future parents can choose from — from Aria to Zuri, and everything in between.\n\nWhether it's a really cool name that catches your eye or a significant meaning behind a particular name, it's not hard to find beautiful name options that perfectly fit for your little one.
