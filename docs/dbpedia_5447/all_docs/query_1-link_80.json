        "text": "Step into the light of an age-old phenomenon in baby names. From classics—for which you maybe didn’t know their meanings, like Alina and Zain—to contemporary stunners, like Clarimond and Alpenglow, we’ve got the best and most beautiful names that mean light in many languages for girls, boys, and parents looking for a gender-neutral name.\n\nGive the little light of your life a meaningful name that lets them know just how special they are. Here are our favorite baby names that mean light.\n\nBoy Baby Names That Mean Light\n\nAnwar: This stand-out Arabic name means “light” but also “luminous, radiance,” and “more enlightened,” for a bright and shining baby boy.\n\nArgi/Argider: Either version of this unique Basque name is a lovely fit for your little prince; it translates to “beautiful light.”\n\nDeepak: A name you’ve heard, but not one that’s overused; in Sanskrit it means “light” or “lamp.”\n\nElouan: This long and flowing baby boy name of Breton / French roots is considered quite rare.

This gender-neutral choice means both “light” and “vermillion.”\n\nAlpenglow: If you’ve been on the lookout for a name that’s extra-special with a lovely, light-filled meaning and beautiful sound, look no further than this gem. Its illustrious meaning from the German is “the rosy light of the setting or rising sun on high mountains.” Ahhh!\n\nBeacon: A pretty English word name for a “signal light,” it’s got charisma and familiarity in spades.\n\nHikaru: A beautiful gender-neutral name of Japanese roots meaning both “light” and “radiance.”\n\nKiran: This Sanskrit moniker is used for boys and girls all over the world, most traditionally in India, Nepal, and Pakistan.
