        "text": "Actually, most such phrases are little more than a \"clearing of the throat\" and can be eliminated altogether. They introduce a pause, but little more.\n\nPhrases like \"by the way\" or \"as a matter of fact\" or \"as is well known\" serve the same purpose.\n\nIf you really want to draw attention to a point, be more explicit. \"It is important/interesting to remember/know/consider that...\". This wakes them up a bit, hopefully.\n\nBut, \"dear students\" or similar might work in some cultures.\n\nI once had a colleague who thought of herself as a sort of \"mom\" to her students and often interspersed \"darlings\" or \"children\" in such cases. It was just a personal quirk that worked for her, though it is hard to recommend.\n\nThe comic in me wants to suggest \"slackers\" or \"you hiding in the back row\", but it would be wrong ;-)"
