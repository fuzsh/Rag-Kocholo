        "text": "\"Shy\" would be a description of someone who has difficulty speaking with people. You could describe someone as \"Shy around girls\", but knowing more about why they were shy might lead us to a better phrase.\n\nHow about \"selective mutist\", a selective mutist is someone who cannot talk in certain conditions, but is quite chatty in others. For instance, a boy at school having difficulty chatting with other girls, but when he gets home, jokes around a lot with his sister.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf that wasn't clear enough, how about \"parthenophobic selective mutist\"....\n\nMisogynist\n\nThis would be someone who chooses not to speak to women. Not out of fear or shyness but out of dislike. It has more of a negative connotation though."
