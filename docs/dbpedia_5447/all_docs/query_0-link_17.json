        "text": "This article will look at the 25 cities with the most beautiful women in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 10 Cities with the Most Beautiful Women in the World.\n\nThe beauty industry is a global behemoth, and it's no secret that the world's most beautiful women are at the forefront of this industry. The demand for beauty products and services is ever-increasing, from cosmetics and skincare to plastic surgeries and non-invasive procedures. In this article, we'll look at 25 cities with the most beautiful women in the world from a market perspective that focuses on the presence of the cosmetic and beauty industry.\n\nA 2018 report by Human Rights Watch highlighted the beauty-obsessed job advertisements in China. Examples included ads seeking an \"aesthetically pleasing\" clothing sales associate and a \"fashionable and beautiful\" train conductor.\n\nWith the rise of the internet and new job opportunities that rely heavily on appearance, experts say there is an increased focus on looks. Wang Jun, vice president of Gengmei, told the BBC that beauty could bring more career opportunities, such as monetizing live streaming and online video content.\n\nIn 2022, U.S. beauty consumers supported and contributed to the industry's recovery from the downfall witnessed during the pandemic. According to a survey, 75% of female beauty buyers in the U.S. have stated that buying beauty products has become equally or more important to them now than before the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. beauty industry will maintain a significant market share in 2023. This is because the industry generated an estimated total revenue of $90.2 billion across various channels in 2022, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. These figures suggest that the beauty industry will grow further in 2023.\n\nTrending Cosmetic Procedures in 2023\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reported in 2020 that approximately 16 million cosmetic surgeries are performed annually in the U.S., with women comprising 92% of patients.\n\nAccording to the ISAPS, more people opted for liposuction than any other cosmetic surgery in 2021, with a 24.8% surge and 1.9 million procedures. Breast augmentation came second, with a growth of 3.8%. The other popular surgeries were eyelid surgery, rhinoplasty, and abdominoplasty. For non-surgical procedures, botox, hyaluronic acid, hair removal, skin tightening, and fat reduction were the most in demand.\n\nNatural plastic surgeries\n\nPlastic surgery is growing, focusing on \"natural\" techniques that use minimal synthetic implants and rely more on fat grafting and minimally invasive methods. This trend towards \"natural\" beauty is gaining popularity, with more women opting for plastic surgery to achieve their desired appearance.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of natural plastic surgery is the reduced scarring, which can be so small that it's barely noticeable. This is favoured by people who want a flawless appearance without any visible signs of surgery. Natural procedures are also less expensive than traditional plastic surgery techniques.\n\nCombination procedures\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgeons surveyed that more patients seek combination procedures to minimize recovery time and obtain longer-lasting results.\n\nOne example of this trend is the \"Mommy Makeover,\" which often involves a combination of procedures such as breast augmentation, tummy tuck, arm/thigh lift, and liposuction. It is a personalized procedure targeted towards addressing post-pregnancy effects on women's physical appearance and, thus, helps them restore their pre-pregnancy appearance.\n\nKey players in the beauty industry\n\nBeauty remained a promising industry despite the challenging retail environment at the start of 2023. L'Oréal S.A (NASDAQ:LRLCF), the world's biggest cosmetics and beauty company, reported a 13% like-for-like increase in sales for the first quarter of the year in 2023. The company's earnings report showed that all divisions contributed to the growth, led by a 30.6% surge in dermatological beauty products.\n\nExpanding its footprint in the U.S. market, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) 's annual sales in 2022 reached over $10 billion and achieved a milestone for the company. Profits were record-setting at over $1 billion. Moreover, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) also expanded its loyalty program membership to over 40 million members.\n\nOn the other hand, the American-French Multinational Coty Inc (NASDAQ:COTY) 's sales of beauty products, especially high-end fragrances, remained strong during the second quarter of 2023. Its prestige fragrance market grew by high single digits, and the mass beauty market grew by mid-single digits.\n\nOur methodology\n\nThe selection of 25 cities with the most beautiful women in the world was determined after reviewing numerous threads and discussions on Reddit. Thus, the most frequently appearing cities were considered. Those cities were then further studied regarding the frequency of cosmetic surgeries, facilities, and other beauty-related industries where women's participation is actively observed.\n\nNote: We have exclusively focused on pravelence of cosmetic sugeries in these cities as an indirect indicator of prettiness. Our list doesn't necessarily focus on beauty demographics.\n\nCopyright: tomwang / 123RF Stock Photo\n\n25. Manila, Philippines\n\nMedical tourism has become popular due to the high healthcare costs in industrialized countries.

According to Whataclinic, there are nearly 111 beauty salons in Manila and 93 clinics for plastic surgery, making beauty easily accessible for women.\n\n24. Mumbai, India\n\nCosmetic surgery and non-invasive cosmetic treatments are also becoming increasingly popular among women in Mumbai, with a growing number of clinics and surgeons catering to this demand.

Mexico City, Mexico\n\nThe Mexican industry ranks third in terms of cosmetics production in the world after the U.S. and Brazil. The production in New Mexico is majorly focused on hair cosmetics products, perfumes, and hair dyes.\n\nAs a media hub, Mexico City offers a cost-effective alternative to U.S. cities. It has become a significant global destination for medical tourism, providing high-quality cosmetic surgeries. Cosmetic surgeons in the city offer a better, top-notch treatment to patients if they pay a bit above the average rate.\n\n21. San Jose, Costa Rica\n\nThe city's growing beauty industry includes a range of salons, spas, and cosmetic clinics, offering services like breast surgeries and hair care to cosmetic procedures. Popular beauty brands in Costa Rica include L'Oréal S.A (NASDAQ:LRLCF) and Maybelline New York. It is one of the cities with prettiest women in the world.\n\n20. Beirut, Lebanon\n\nBeirut is famous for cosmetic surgeries and procedures. Approximately 1.5 million surgeries are performed annually in Lebanon, also known as the Botox capital of the middle east. The industry especially thrives during the holidays when women around the globe fly to Lebanon to undergo cosmetic procedures.

The city is home to many popular beauty brands and stores, such as Sephora and Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA), and a range of high-end beauty salons and clinics, offering services such as hair care, makeup, facials, and cosmetic procedures like facelifts and liposuction.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) in N.Y. uses Redis Enterprise on Google Cloud to provide high-performance services for online shoppers. With a focus on personalized customer experiences, the beauty retailer uses technology to keep its customers happy and engaged, accounting for a significant chunk of its $10 billion-plus 2022 total sales. New York, being a global city, attracts people from all around the world, leading to a lot of diversity, especially when it comes to pretty women.\n\n17. Tokyo, Japan\n\nTokyo has a growing beauty industry with clinics, salons, and stores catering to various beauty needs. Japanese women prioritize natural beauty and focus on skincare. This has led to Tokyo's emphasis on natural beauty and, thus, the development of innovative skincare products and treatments that are highly sought after worldwide. Some popular choices for cosmetic surgeries in Tokyo include Ginza Miyako Clinics and Mirai Medical Clinic Myogadani.\n\n16. London, UK\n\nGenerally, women in London tend to observe a natural look, focusing on healthy skin, minimal makeup, and effortless hair.\n\nWhile Cosmetic surgeries and non-surgical treatments are popular in London, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), the number of cosmetic surgery procedures performed in the U.K. has steadily declined over the past few years. However, the popularity of non-surgical treatments such as Botox, fillers, and chemical peels continues to grow.\n\n15. Paris, France\n\nFrench women are known for their effortlessly chic style and natural beauty, with a focus on skincare and minimalist makeup. Cosmetic surgery is available in Paris, and numerous clinics and surgeons offer surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures. While the number of cosmetic surgery procedures performed in Paris is lower than in some other cities, the quality of care is generally very high, with skilled surgeons and modern facilities.\n\nThe quality of the beauty industry observed in Paris can be judged by the news of American-French company, L'Oréal S.A (NASDAQ:LRLCF)'s investment in a biotechnology venture for sustainable beauty ingredients, reflecting value for innovation and sustainability in the beauty industry.\n\n14. Shanghai, China\n\nChina has the second-largest beauty and personal care product market after the U.S., with a value of $25.5 billion in 2023. Shanghai has become an increasingly attractive location for beauty industry leaders due to its growing innovation in the beauty industry post-pandemic.\n\nAs a result of the growing popularity of the beauty industry, the Shanghai government has recently prohibited minors from cosmetic surgeries without the consent of their guardians. Shanghai's beauty industry potential may also be judged by the fact that Coty Inc (NASDAQ:COTY) believes that its small presence in China offers potential, even though China only contributes 4% to its net revenue.\n\n13. Caracas, Venezuela\n\nVenezuelan women are known for their beauty and have won numerous international beauty pageants, including Miss Universe and Miss World. This has helped fuel the country's beauty industry.\n\nCosmetic surgery in Caracas is less common than in some Latin American countries like Brazil and Colombia, but it is still an option for those who can afford it. Some popular cosmetic surgery procedures in Caracas include liposuction, tummy tucks, and facelifts. It is one of the cities with the most physically attractive women in the world.\n\n12.
