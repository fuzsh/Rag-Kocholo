        "text": "Jodie’s acting has won the hearts of people everywhere. Now, her looks are turning heads too.\n\nUsing modern digital face-mapping technology created by Dr. Julian De Silva, a cosmetic surgeon from Harley Street, it was found that Jodie’s face is 94.52% close to the Greek Golden Ratio. This ratio is believed to define the ideal standard of beauty. It seems Jodie’s face matches this standard very closely.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the world’s most beautiful woman and those who come close to her.\n\nJodie Comer: The Most Beautiful Woman in the Globe According to Dr. Julian De Silva\n\nThe “Killing Eve” actress, who’s 29, has a face that’s 94.52% close to the Golden Ratio – a standard that defines beauty.\n\nWhen measuring features like her eyes, nose, lips, and chin, Jodie’s face closely aligned with what the ancient Greeks considered perfect.\n\nZendaya, the 26-year-old star of “Dune” and Tom Holland’s girlfriend, was next with 94.37%. Model Bella Hadid came third with 94.35%, while singer Beyoncé came fourth with 92.44%.\n\nDr. De Silva, a cosmetic surgeon from Harley Street, used the newest digital face-mapping techniques to make this list. He runs the Centre For Advanced Facial Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery in London and sees Jodie Comer as the standout winner when comparing facial features.\n\nThe position of Jodie’s nose and lips got a score of 98.7%, which is near perfect. She also scored highly for her nose’s dimensions, lip shape, and eye position. Her chin shape is outstanding, and her face has a strong structure. However, her eyebrows got 88%.\n\nZendaya followed closely, scoring 99.5% for her lips and 98% for her forehead. Bella Hadid landed in third place, with top scores for the position of her chin and eyes. Beyoncé, in fourth, scored 99.6% for her face shape and had high scores for her brows, eyes, and lips.\n\nThe latest digital mapping techniques help us understand beauty standards and are valuable for planning surgeries.\n\nThe Golden Ratio\n\nThe Golden Ratio is a mathematical idea the ancient Greeks first looked into.\n\nIt’s a balance believed to look good and is seen in nature, as well as in art and buildings.\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci used this ratio in his iconic piece, the Vitruvian Man, aiming for the ideal male body. The basic idea is, the nearer a face’s features are to the number 1.618 (Phi), the prettier it looks.\n\nWhen talking about faces, the Golden Ratio assesses beauty standards. It suggests that facial elements, like the gap between the nose, mouth, and eyes, can be matched with the Golden Ratio to see their beauty level.\n\nBeauty experts and facial surgeons use this ratio to identify the most appealing face features.\n\nAt my clinic, we use digital mapping to study facial aspects like eyes, lips, and nose. We then set these against the Golden Ratio to determine the most pleasing features.\n\nComputerised Mapping Techniques and the Golden Ratio\n\nIn our clinic, we use digital mapping to examine facial features and their proportions.\n\nThis helps us see how they align with the Golden Ratio.\n\nWe use a software to analyse face photos, measuring aspects like the gap between the nose, eyes, and lips. These measures are then matched with the Golden Ratio to gauge their similarity.\n\nTypically, the method marks crucial spots on a face, like eye corners, mouth corners, and the nose tip. The program then uses these markers to figure out facial proportions and ratios. It then contrasts these with the perfect proportions from the Golden Ratio.\n\nWe can also use this tech to craft a 3D face model. This can be spun around, letting us inspect the face from various viewpoints. It’s handy for planning surgeries, like facelifts or nose jobs, aiming for a better-looking balance and harmony on the face.\n\nThe Ten Most Beautiful Women in the World and Their Golden Ratio Scores\n\nJodie Comer – 94.52%\n\nZendaya – 94.37%\n\nBella Hadid – 94.35%\n\nBeyoncé – 92.44%\n\nAriana Grande – 91.81%\n\nTaylor Swift – 91.64%\n\nJourdan Dunn – 91.39%\n\nKim Kardashian – 91.28%\n\nDeepika Padukone – 91.22%\n\nHoYeon Jung – 89.63%\n\nStart With the Most Beautiful Nose, Eyes, Eyebrows, Chin, Lips, Forehead, and Face Shape\n\nNose – Jodie Comer 98.7%\n\nEyes – Bella Hadid 97.7%\n\nLips – Zendaya 99.5%\n\nEyebrows – Deepika Padukone 95.2%\n\nChin – Bella Hadid 99.7%\n\nForehead – Zendaya 98%\n\nFace Shape – Beyoncé 99.6%\n\nTen Most Beautiful Stars: Dr. Julian de Silva Explains Why and Where They Were Marked Down\n\nJodie Comer – 94.52%\n\nJodie Comer, an English actress, is famed for playing Villanelle in the hit TV show Killing Eve.\n\nShe stepped into acting in the early 2000s, featuring in several TV series and movies.

She also starred in other British series, including Starlings and The White Queen.\n\nHowever, it was her portrayal of Villanelle in the hit series Killing Eve that made headlines. The show, known for its fresh twist on the spy thriller, was lauded, especially for Comer’s role.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, Jodie Comer stands out as she ticks almost all boxes for facial perfection. Comer’s lip and nose position scored a high 98.7%.\n\nShe also topped the charts for her nose’s dimensions and ranked high for her lip shape and eye position. Comer’s chin is gracefully shaped. Moreover, Comer’s facial structure is notably solid.

She played Rue Bennett in the HBO series Euphoria, winning an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series – the youngest to do so. She’s also known for her role as Michelle Jones in Spider-Man: Homecoming and its sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nAccording to Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi, Zendaya’s face aligns 94.37% with ideal proportions, coming second to Jodie Comer.\n\nWhat’s impressive is Zendaya’s lips, scoring a near-perfect 99.5%.\n\nHer forehead also boasts a whopping score of 98%. But, her nose relative to Zendaya’s lips and eyebrow shape scored a bit less.\n\nBella Hadid – 94.35%\n\nBella Hadid is a renowned American model and TV personality.\n\nShe kicked off her modelling journey in 2014 and quickly climbed to the top tiers of the fashion world.\n\nBella has collaborated with elite brands and designers, and she’s graced many major advertising campaigns and editorial shoots.\n\nIn terms of the Golden Ratio, Bella secured the third spot with 94.35%. Hadid’s chin and eyes stood out, each achieving a remarkable 99.7%, nearly perfect.\n\nHowever, her eyebrows’ shape didn’t score as impressively.\n\nBeyoncé – 92.44%\n\nBeyoncé first made her mark in the late 1990s as the lead vocalist of Destiny’s Child, a top-selling R&B girl group.\n\nTheir success paved the way for her illustrious solo career.\n\nBeyoncé’s standout vocals and magnetic stage presence have earned her many accolades, including 24 Grammy Awards.\n\nDespite being 41, Beyoncé remains stunning. Her facial shape achieved an almost perfect 99.6%, the top score. Beyonce’s lips, eyes, and eyebrow zone also scored admirably. The only aspect that didn’t score as high was Beyonce’s lips relative to her nose.\n\nAriana Grande – 91.81%\n\nAriana Grande, is an American musician and actress.\n\nShe began her journey in 2008 with the Broadway musical 13 and later gained fame as Cat Valentine on the hit teen series Victorious and its spinoff Sam & Cat.\n\nAriana is celebrated as a leading figure in the music world, bagging numerous awards, including five AMAs (American Music Awards), an MTV Video Music Award, and getting nominated for three Grammy Awards.\n\nApplying the Golden Ratio, which assesses physical perfection, Ariana achieved a score of 91.81%. While her chin and forehead were rated highly, Grande’s brows and the noticeable distance between Grande’s upper lip and nose pulled her scores down a bit.\n\nTaylor Swift – 91.64%\n\nTaylor Swift started as a country singer with her first album in 2006.\n\nOver time, she shifted to pop music and has now become one of the world’s top-selling artists, with sales surpassing 200 million records.\n\nThroughout her career, she’s bagged various awards, including 11 Grammys, an Emmy, a Brit Award, and many more.\n\nBased on the Golden Ratio, Taylor’s face got a score of 91.64%. Notably, Swift’s lips and chin ranked high. However, Taylor’s brows scored a bit lower, affecting her overall rating.\n\nJourdan Dunn – 91.39%\n\nJourdan Dunn, a British model and actress, is famed for her work in fashion shows, magazines, and TV.\n\nStarting her modelling journey in 2006, she soon became a sought-after name in the fashion world.\n\nShe has modelled for top brands like Burberry, Dior, and Balmain and has been on the covers of major magazines such as British Vogue and Elle.\n\nBased on the Golden Ratio, Jourdan’s score stands at 91.39%. My analysis showed she scored exceptionally well, over 97%, for face structure, eyes, and the distance between her nose and lips . However, Jordan Dunn’s chin and the dimensions of her nose received slightly lower scores.\n\nKim Kardashian – 91.28%\n\nKim Kardashian West is a well-known American figure, renowned as a media personality, socialite, model, and entrepreneur.\n\nShe’s famously part of the famous ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’ along with her family.\n\nIn terms of the Golden Ratio, Kim scored 91.28%. Her brow shape and chin received commendable scores. However, her lips and the general shape of her face pulled her overall rating down a bit.\n\nDeepika Padukone – 91.22%\n\nDeepika Padukone is a renowned Indian actress, mainly starring in Hindi movies.\n\nShe’s among India’s top-earning actresses and is often highlighted by the media to be among the country’s most beloved and stunning stars.\n\nBased on my findings, Deepika achieved a score of 91.22% using the Golden Ratio. Her eyebrows were almost perfect, scoring an impressive 95.2%. Yet, her nose and forehead shapes pulled her overall score down slightly. Still, it’s fantastic to see a Bollywood icon making the list.\n\nHoYeon Jung – 89.63%\n\nHoYeon Jung, from South Korea, started as a beauty pageant participant before making a name for herself as a model and celebrity.\n\nShe’s been featured in numerous ad campaigns. Recently, her role in the Netflix hit Squid Game, brought her global recognition.\n\nBased on the Golden Ratio, HoYeon’s face aligns with 89.63% of the ideal proportions. The width of her nose, eyes, and lips were standout features, getting high scores. But, the shape of her chin, brows, and forehead, slightly impacted her overall rating.\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to the Golden Ratio, a scientific measure of beauty, Jodie Comer is the world’s most beautiful woman. Her face closely matches ideal proportions with a score of 94.52%."
