        "text": "Are you an attractive woman? Or are you not sure?\n\nLet’s answer that question in today’s guide, where we look at 21 signs you’re attractive.\n\nFirst of all: if you’re a bit ecfmbarrassed at reading this article, don’t be.\n\nEveryone asks the question at some point in their lives: “Am I attractive to the opposite sex?”\n\nIt’s a deeply human need to be accepted by society and especially in terms of dating and relationships.\n\nThat being said, the simple truth is that there are many different types of beauty out there. And when it comes to love, you’ll want to focus on the two major types: Physical and Spiritual.\n\nYes, the goal is to be both physically AND spiritually beautiful.\n\nAs I mentioned, there are 21 signs in all. You don’t need to have every single one of the signs, but the more you have, the better.\n\nAnd the best part? With the tips you’ll learn in this guide, you can even GROW in both physical and spiritual beauty as time goes by.\n\nSo how many of the following 21 signs do you have? Let’s take a look and see.\n\nHow to tell if you are physically beautiful\n\nPhysical beauty is quite important in the dating game, as it’s what makes your “first impression” on other people. And while first impressions don’t necessarily last, they do influence other people’s opinions of you.\n\nPut simply, the more attractive you make yourself, the more you’ll get out of life. It may sound harsh, but it’s the truth.\n\nTo know for sure if you’re attractive, look out for the following signs.\n\n1) People are drawn to you\n\nAgain, different people have different opinions about what makes a person attractive but good looks are a common denominator. And if people are drawn to you — as in, they feel the urge to know you better — then that’s a sign you’re attractive.\n\nWatch out for these little signs:\n\nWhen you’re just walking by, people stop you to ask a question\n\nAt parties, boys periodically try to start conversations with you\n\nAt gatherings, people try to get to know more about you\n\nHere’s a tip: If a guy is drawn to you — and you’re drawn to him at the same time — then it’s a good sign of chemistry. Get to know him better — he might be good for you.\n\n2) People contact you out of the blue\n\nHave you ever heard of “Breadcrumbing?”\n\nThink of tossing breadcrumbs to animals to make them come closer to you. Sadly, it’s a tactic that’s also being used in the dating game.\n\nHere’s how people “breadcrumb” in the dating arena:\n\nThey contact people they’re interested in out of the blue\n\nThey send anonymous “love letters” as they did in middle school\n\nThey stalk you on social media, hoping you’ll notice them\n\nWhat does it mean when men “breadcrumb” you?\n\nAt worst, they want a sexual encounter with you. At best, they want to be your friend — or even your boyfriend.\n\nIn any case, proceed carefully — you don’t want to do anything you’ll regret later, right?\n\n3) Men protect you\n\nMen are much more likely to step up to the plate for women they find attractive.\n\nThey have a natural instinct to protect them (more on that below).\n\nHere are the common ways a man will protect an attractive woman who they want to be with.\n\nWhen you go somewhere shady or dangerous, he always tries to go with you\n\nIf someone is talking bad about you, he steps up and defends you\n\nIf you ever need help for any reason, he’ll always lend a hand.\n\nWhen a man protects you like this it’s because you’ve triggered his hero instinct.\n\nThe hero instinct is a new concept in relationship psychology that’s generating a lot of buzz at the moment.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that men have a biological urge to protect the women they want to be with. They want to step up for her and be appreciated for his actions.\n\nIn other words, men want to be an everyday hero.\n\nI know it sounds kind of silly. In this day and age, women don’t need a “hero” to protect them.\n\nBut here’s the ironic truth. Men do still need to feel like they are a hero. Because it’s built into their DNA to seek out a relationship with a woman that makes them feel like one.\n\nIf you want to learn the simple ways you can trigger the hero instinct in a man, watch this excellent free video.\n\nThe video reveals the texts you can send, phrases you can say, and simple things you can do to trigger this very natural male instinct.\n\nHere’s a link to the free video again.\n\n4) People are shocked when you can’t take compliments\n\nHey, I get it. Some compliments can make you think: “Where the heck did THAT come from?”\n\nLet’s say someone gives you a compliment but you disagree with it. And so you say: “Thanks, but don’t say that — it’ll get in my head” (or something similar).\n\nIf they’re surprised at how you disagreed with the compliment, then it means the compliment was sincere and so you’d better believe it.\n\nThe good news? It’s a sign you’re not just physically beautiful but spiritually too. And as you’ll see in the second part of this guide, spiritual attractiveness is just as important, if not more so.\n\n5) Men pout when they see you\n\nWhen men pout when they see you or when their jaw drops even slightly, or when they make an “ooh” sound — it’s a clear sign.\n\nThey’re attracted to you and there’s no doubting it. Body language doesn’t lie.\n\nYou might have noticed it before. You walk into a room, and you notice a guy glance at you. Then they quickly look away, pretending not to see you — but their lips are pursed.\n\nThat’s the dead giveaway that they find you pretty.\n\n6) People like your smile\n\n“I like your smile.”\n\n“I love the way you smile.”\n\n“Your smile is contagious, did you know that?”\n\nWhat do compliments like these mean?\n\nWhen a guy gives you a compliment like this, it could mean one of two things:\n\nIt may be just small talk\n\nIt may also mean he’s flirting with you\n\nSo when it happens, just say “thanks.” No need to stay up all night wondering whether he meant anything by it. Instead, observe his behavior to spot any of the other signs in this guide.\n\n7) Men act awkward around you\n\nWhen boys act weird around you, it could possibly mean they find you very attractive. And if it’s an especially common reaction you get, then there’s no doubt — you’re a hottie and you drive the boys crazy.\n\nWhy do guys act awkwardly around pretty women? It’s all Mother Nature’s idea.\n\nMen naturally want to be liked by attractive women — it makes them feel good and gives them validation. And so when they see you, a pretty girl, near them, they feel the sudden need to be on their best behavior and for most guys, that results in awkward behavior.\n\nNow, you might be thinking: “Could it also be that they’re uncomfortable around women in general?”\n\nWhile socially awkward, low-confidence guys act like that by default, pay attention if LOTS of guys do that around you. It could mean that even the more confident boys out there get rattled when you walk into the room.\n\nAnd that says a lot about how attractive you are.\n\nI learnt this from Carlos Cavallo. He’s one of the world’s leading experts male psychology and what men want from relationships.\n\nIf a guy you like is acting weird around you, watch this simple and genuine video.\n\nIn this video, Carlos reveals some “genius” phrases you can say to him that will make him obsessed over you.\n\n8) Men are hot and cold toward you\n\nDoes it seem like men are either very warm or very cold toward you — but never lukewarm or indifferent?\n\nIf so, then it could be a sign you’re more attractive than the average girl. When men treat a woman with extreme warmth, they’re likely kissing up to you and hoping to build a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, when they treat you with extreme coldness, they may be “negging” you.\n\nWhat’s “negging?” It’s a common flirting trick men use on women. They might tease you or throw mild insults your way, getting you riled up. And when you’re in a playful mood, you’re more open to flirting back without even knowing it.\n\nMy advice? Unless you fancy him, too, stay on your guard and don’t fall for the trick.\n\n9) You don’t get too many compliments from men\n\nIf women complement your looks but men don’t, it might also be a sign you’re attractive. Most men avoid complimenting a woman’s appearance because it’s obvious.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nMost men know that it’s better to keep their feelings hidden — at least for now — than to openly declare them to you.\n\nAfter all, think about it. Imagine two thoroughly average guys were dating you.\n\nOne of them openly declared his feelings for you, while the other is more aloof and mysterious. Which one of them would you find more attractive than the other?\n\nMost women would pick the mysterious one. For some strange reason, the honest one comes off as needy, desperate, and maybe even icky.\n\nSo if you don’t get too many compliments from a guy you like, it could be because he’s waiting for the right time.\n\nIs he a shy guy? Maybe.\n\nIf you like him too, it may be a good idea to ask him out and see how he reacts.\n\n10) You’ve had a fairly active dating life\n\nIf you regularly go on dates with men or if you’ve had relationships before, then you can be pretty sure men are attracted to you.\n\nSad to say, some women out there have great personalities but can go years without a single date.\n\nThat’s the power of physical attractiveness. It can make you happy or miserable depending on how you use it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationships you’ve been in have mostly been abusive, that’s another story. You may be physically attractive, but your spiritual side may need some work. Not to worry — we’ll cover that soon.\n\n11) People stare at you\n\nDo complete strangers stare at you? It could mean many things:\n\nThey think you’re attractive — after all, you turned heads\n\nThey want your attention but don’t know how to get it\n\nSomething about you looked out of the ordinary, and it caught their attention\n\nAgain, don’t rely on this sign (or any other) on its own. Check if you see the other signs as well. The more signs you spot, the surer you can bet that you’re pretty.\n\nSo there you have it. The first 10 signs are signs you’re physically beautiful.\n\nNow let’s look at the other side of the coin — spiritual beauty.\n\nHow to tell if you are spiritually beautiful\n\n“Spiritual beauty” covers your personality, worldview, and how well you accept yourself.\n\nAnd yes, other people notice it too. Your spiritual beauty — or lack thereof — will dictate just how happy and successful your “love life” will be.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, spiritual beauty is just as important as physical beauty, if not more so. While your looks will make the first impression on others, your spirit is what makes the LASTING impression.\n\nAnd here’s the thing:\n\nWhile other people tend to appreciate your physical beauty before you do, it’s the opposite with spiritual beauty. Here, you can see your spiritual beauty before others.\n\nHere are the 10 signs to look for\n\n12) You’re independent\n\nCan you rely on yourself to get the job done? Are you naturally good at problem-solving, prioritization, and execution?\n\nThat’s a beautiful thing and bosses would love having you on their teams.\n\nWhen it comes to dating, believe it or not, but independence is a trait men like in a woman.\n\nNow, you might think: “Nah, I’ve met guys who got intimidated by me”. Sure, some men are insecure and weak. But trust me when I say the strong, confident, REAL men out there would love to meet you.\n\n13) You’re happy with yourself\n\nAre you happy with yourself? Let’s do a quick test…\n\nDo you take yourself lightly?\n\nDo you avoid comparing yourself to others?\n\nDo you avoid ruminating, or obsessing about the past?\n\nDo you focus on making progress in all areas of your life?\n\nIs “giving back” important to you?\n\nThe more “yes” answers you have, the happier you are with yourself and the more spiritually beautiful you are. In a world run by social media, it’s rare to find people like you.\n\nAnd if you had more “no” answers, don’t worry.\n\nLearn to stop comparing yourself to others or thinking about the past. And start focusing on growth and giving back. It’ll change your life like nothing else.\n\n14) You accept your flaws\n\nThis one’s related to Sign #11. Nobody’s perfect. You have your own unique flaws and weaknesses.\n\nThe question is:\n\nDo you accept them? Can you forgive yourself easily? Can you laugh at your mistakes and misfortunes?\n\nOne of the most important lessons you can learn in life is to stay away from perfection. It’s great to set high standards for yourself, but perfection is an IMPOSSIBLE standard.\n\nAnd you wouldn’t set that for your worst enemy — why would you set it for yourself?\n\nInstead of striving for perfection, strive for excellence. No one can ever be perfect but anyone can be really, really good at anything. And that includes you.\n\nHere’s a tip: When it comes to romance, it’s super-important to find someone who accepts your flaws, too. But it all starts with you. If you’re not willing to do it, no one else will, after all.\n\n15) You’re good at expressing yourself\n\nDo you easily express your ideas, thoughts, and feelings?\n\nAre you good at articulating solutions and explanations?\n\nAre you not afraid of speaking your mind?\n\nThe more you answered “yes” to those questions, the more at peace you are with yourself. You’re free of the need to impress others or embellish your work.\n\nAnd yes, that’s spiritually beautiful. In a culture fueled by social media, most people feel a never-ending urge to be noticed, be liked, and be significant in some way.\n\nIt takes a lot of maturity to see that urge as unimportant and even unnecessary. If you’re mature enough to know it’s more important to be helpful than go viral, that’s a beautiful thing.\n\n16) You don’t want attention\n\nEver noticed that at times when you DON’T want attention, you get lots of it?\n\nFor instance, when you want to spend some alone time, friends call you to meet up or your boss asks you to work on a side project.\n\nOr when you stay quiet in a meeting, you get asked for your opinion.\n\nWhat does it mean when that happens to you a lot?\n\nIt simply means people see you as trustworthy and “steady.” They know they get value whenever they ask you for it and so they get as much of it as they can.\n\nContrast this with attention-seekers, who tend to overpromise, underdeliver, and shirk responsibility. You’re not that, and that’s why people trust you.\n\n17) You know what others want\n\nWhen you’re spiritually beautiful, you instinctively know what other people want from you.\n\nAnd when it comes to love, you know exactly what a man wants to be in a loving and satisfying relationship with you.\n\nAbove all else, you know that a man needs his hero instinct triggered.\n\nI mentioned this concept above.\n\nHow do you trigger his hero instinct?\n\nThe best thing you can do is watch this free video from the relationship expert who discovered this concept. He reveals the simple things you can do starting today.\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can tap into his protective instincts and the most noble aspect of his masculinity. Most importantly, you’ll unleash his deepest feelings of attraction towards you.\n\nHere’s a link to the video again.\n\n18) You have a purpose in life and you’re optimistic about it\n\nDo you have a mission in life? Do you have a purpose that’s bigger than yourself and gives your life meaning and direction?\n\nOr are you currently wandering through life, wondering what your “purpose” is?\n\nSo many women never find their purpose in life, and as a result, die unhappy.\n\nI beg you to NOT be one of them. Find a purpose, whether it’s in the corporate world, the household, or anywhere in between, or anywhere else entirely.\n\nHaving a purpose and loving it makes you so much more beautiful. It inspires other people to follow your example and make the world a better place.\n\n19) You’re being yourself\n\nDo you love yourself? By that, I don’t mean doing whatever you want, whenever you want. That’s not love — that’s greed.\n\nInstead, I’m talking about loving yourself enough to do what’s GOOD for you and for other people. Loving yourself means not being selfish but being a force of good for the world.\n\n20) You have an open mind\n\nHaving an “open mind” means being open to ideas and information outside of your own set of beliefs. It makes you beautiful and approachable.\n\nNow, you might have your own set beliefs or worldview by now. And that’s fine.\n\nHaving an open mind means you can listen to other beliefs and consider them for what they are. And when you see the sense in them, it enriches your own worldview.\n\nIf you don’t, you discard them — but at least you gave the other person the blessing of being listened to.\n\n21) You’re passionate about life\n\nLastly, a great sign of spiritual beauty is when you’re passionate about life.\n\nYou’re not all “doom-and-gloom” like lots of people today and you’re not constantly worrying about the future. Instead, you’re working tirelessly to make your dreams come true.\n\nBeing “passionate” means understanding there are lots of things in the world you can’t control. And yet you clearly see the things you CAN control and you focus all your energy and resources there.\n\nYou work with gusto. You’re unstoppable. You rise after every failure or setback.\n\nThat’s what being passionate about life means. And I sincerely hope after reading this guide, that’s precisely what you’ll strive to be from now on.\n\nSo are you attractive?\n\nSo you see, there are lots of signs to look out for when trying to see just how attractive you are. What’s more, there’s more than just physical beauty here — there’s also spiritual beauty.\n\nHow many of the signs applied to you? Are you physically beautiful? How about spiritually?\n\nNo matter what “score” you got, don’t worry about it. We all start somewhere, right? That’s the goal of this guide — to show you two things:\n\nWhere you are in terms of your physical and spiritual attractiveness\n\nWhere you need to go from here\n\nSo here’s some advice.\n\nCheck the signs that DIDN’T apply to you. Write them down. These are the “gaps” you’ll want to fill as you move forward.\n\nThen pick one of those signs as your next “life project.”\n\nI suggest you pick the one you can start working on right away. It should also be the one you feel you can achieve with the least amount of time and effort.\n\nFor example, let’s say you checked the list and you thought: “I’m not that independent.” (That’s sign #15). You then ask yourself: “What can I do to become more independent now… and have fun at the same time?”\n\nDo a quick brainstorming session, write down all the ideas that come to mind, and pick the easiest one to do. Then get to work. It’s that simple.\n\nAsk the right questions, and you’ll get the right answers.\n\nMake the lifestyle changes you need and apply them consistently until they become part of the “new you.” So go ahead — get started.\n\nLife is short, after all, so make the most of it and be happy at the same time.\n\nHow to enjoy a successful, lasting relationship\n\nBeing attractive is one thing, but it doesn’t guarantee long, lasting relationships.\n\nSure, beauty does help you to hook the guys and reel them in.\n\nBut your outer beauty isn’t going to keep them around.\n\nRelationships are built on much more than a simple physical attraction to the other person. While it’s a great start, you will find yourself flitting in and out of relationships faster than you can say the word “attractive”.\n\nIs this what you want?\n\nWhile it might be fun in the short term, you’re likely going to find yourself wanting something a little more down the track.\n\nThe best thing you can do is watch James Bauer’s excellent free video here about the hero instinct and the potential it has to help you hold onto a man for the long term.\n\nIf your partner’s hero instinct isn’t triggered, then he’s likely to walk out of your life as quickly as he entered it. This is the key to enjoying a long-term relationship with potential.\n\nSo, what is the hero instinct?\n\nThe idea is simple. Men have a biological drive to feel essential in their relationship. They want to feel needed. You manage to trigger this in your guy, he’s not going anywhere.\n\nIn his new video, James Bauer outlines several things you can do to help trigger this instinct in your man. He reveals phrases, texts, and little requests that you can use right now to bring out this very natural male instinct."
