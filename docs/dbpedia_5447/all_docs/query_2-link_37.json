        "text": "Starting a conversation with anyone can be tough, so knowing the best questions to ask a girl can be a real thinker. Whether you’re kicking something off with someone you like over text (we’ve got some good questions to ask a crush) or you and your best friend are looking to get to know each other even better (here are questions for your BFF), there are plenty of things to explore. After all, there’s nothing better than a one-on-one session of Never Have I Ever, Would You Rather, or Truth or Dare.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind once you’ve gathered questions to ask her is your body language. More often than not—especially if you’re conversing with someone you are romantically interested in—the way you’re positioning yourself will give a lot away. Maintaining eye contact and leaning toward the person shows that you’re engaged. Steer clear of pulling out your phone and scrolling mid-conversation; that’s a quick way to show someone they aren’t the priority. So before you even find yourself asking “what is the best question to ask a girl,” make sure you’re ready to listen during the conversation. And make sure to note her body language, as well—these non-verbal communications are important.\n\nThere are a ton of questions girls like to be asked. But don’t get too wrapped up in planning out what you’re going to ask. Like talking with anyone, the topics will flow naturally—and often, the best subject matter will be completely unplanned.\n\nAll of that being said, we pulled together enough questions to fuel hundreds of conversations to alleviate some of the initial stress around good things to ask a girl. After all, good, old-fashioned chat is the best way to get to know someone.\n\nIn this article:\n\nBest Questions to Ask a Girl\n\nQuestions to Ask Girls About Family\n\nSerious Questions to Ask a Girl\n\nThings to Ask a Girl You Like\n\nRelationship Questions to Ask a Girl\n\nInteresting Questions to Ask a Girl\n\nBest Questions to Ask a Girl\n\nIf you need a short list to start with, here are the best of the best questions to ask a girl that will cover a wide range of topics and help you really get to know each other:"
