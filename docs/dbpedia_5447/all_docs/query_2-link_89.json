        "text": "Man and mankind\n\nTraditionally, we use man to refer to all human beings, male and female, usually in contrast with other animals. However, many people consider this to be sexist, so it is better to use a different expression, such as human beings :\n\nHuman beings first emerged in Africa, some two million years ago. (preferred to Man first emerged …)\n\nMankind can also refer to all human beings, male and female, usually in the sense of social or conscious beings. Although people generally consider it less sexist than man, it is usually better to use a different expression, such as human beings (with a plural verb) or humankind (with a singular verb):\n\nHuman beings have always dreamt of happiness and of a perfect world. or Humankind has always dreamt of happiness … (preferred to Mankind has always dreamt …)\n\nSee also:\n\nSexist language\n\nPeople\n\nPeople can refer to all human beings, or to a group of persons in a particular situation. It is a plural noun and it takes a plural verb:\n\nPeople will always need food, so the food industry will never disappear. (all human beings)\n\nIt’s difficult to sell an old computer. People don’t want second-hand ones. (those typical persons interested in buying computers)\n\nPeople started coming into the hall at five-thirty, almost an hour before the start of the meeting. (those persons who were attending the meeting)\n\nWarning:\n\nWe don’t use the with man, mankind, humankind or people when they are used with a general meaning to refer to all human beings:\n\nPeople / Human beings will always defend their territory against an attack from outside.\n\nNot: The people/The human beings …\n\nSee also:\n\nPerson, persons or people?\n\nSexist language"
