        "text": "Irish girl names are across the world, from Cong to California and everywhere in between.\n\nHowever, while some Irish names for girls, like ‘Aisling’, are pretty common others, like ‘Cliodhna’, are reasonably rare.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a mix of old Irish girl names, many of which date back to ancient Ireland, and more modern names. Enjoy!\n\nPopular Irish girl names\n\nOver the centuries many Irish people emigrated (most notable during the Famine), carrying Irish boys names, Gaelic girl names and Irish last names and Irish customs across the globe.\n\nThe first section below is backed with the most popular Irish names for girls, like Eimear, Róisín and Fiona.\n\n1. Aine\n\nAine is arguably one of the best-known traditional Irish girls name and, interestingly enough, it stems from Irish mythology and a very powerful Goddess.\n\nThe name Aine, which means radiance, is the name of an Irish Celtic goddess who represents both wealth and summer.\n\nPopular Irish girl names: what you need to know about the name Aine\n\nPronunciation: Awn-yah\n\nMeaning: The meaning is linked to the goddess of summer and is thought to mean brightness, radiance or joy.\n\nFamous Aine’s: Aine Lawlor (radio broadcaster), Aine Minogue (harpist, singer and composer) and Aine O’Gorman (footballer)\n\n2. Aisling\n\nAisling is one of several Irish baby girl names that has numerous different spellings (Ashling, Ashlynn and Aislinn) and it was a name given to a poetic genre from the late 17th and early 18th centuries in Ireland.\n\nDespite being one of the most popular Irish girls names over the last number of decades, the name Aisling wasn’t actually used as a first name until the 20th century.\n\nOld Irish female names: what you need to know about the name Aisling\n\nPronunciation: Ash-ling\n\nMeaning: The name is derived from the Irish-Gaelic word “aislinge” which means dream or vision\n\nFamous Aisling’s: Aisling Bea (comedian) and Aisling Franciosi (actress)\n\n3. Fiona\n\nThe name Fiona is another popular one, and you’ll see it pop up in movies (remember Shrek… or, eh, maybe don’t!).\n\nDespite having Scottish and Gaelic origins, the name Fiona has become popular all over the world and is said to mean ‘White’ or ‘Fair’.\n\nCommon Irish baby girl names: what you need to know about the name Fiona\n\nPronunciation: Fee-oh-na\n\nMeaning: The name is thought to come from the Gaelic word ‘Fionn’ meaning white or fair\n\nFamous Fiona’s: Fiona Shaw (Irish actress) and Fiona Apple (American singer)\n\n4. Deirdre\n\nDeirdre is one of many Irish girl names in this guide that you hear less and less of these days. It’s origin all begins with a tale from Irish folklore.\n\nThe heroine was known as Dierdre of the Sorrows who passed tragically after her lover was taken from her. Despite the tragic tale, it’s still somehow emerged as a popular name in Ireland.\n\nPretty Irish baby girl names: what you need to know about the name Deirdre\n\nPronunciation: Deer-drah\n\nMeaning: True to the Irish legend of Deirdre of the Sorrows, the name means ‘Sorrowful’, ‘Raging’ or ‘Fear’\n\nFamous Deirdre’s: Deirdre O’Kane (Irish comedian and actress) and Deirdre Lovejoy (American actress)\n\n5. Róisín\n\nRóisín is arguably one of the most beautiful Irish baby girl names and it has been popular since the 16th century thanks to a famous love song called “Róisín Dubh” (there’s also a pub in Galway of the same name).\n\nAlthough the name can be tricky for some to pronounce, this is a name steeped in Irishness and its meaning, ‘Little rose’, is one of the reasons it’s a popular Irish girls name amongst new parents.\n\nTraditional Irish female names: what you need to know about the name Róisín\n\nPronunciation: Ro-sheen\n\nMeaning: Róisín means ‘Little rose’ in Gaelic\n\nFamous Róisín: Róisín Murphy (singer-songwriter) Róisín Conaty (comedian)\n\n6. Eimear\n\nThe name Eimear, like several classic Irish girl names in this guide, has origins in Irish folklore. It is thought that it is a variant of Emer, the wife of the hero Cu Chulainn.\n\nShe was said to possess the six gifts of womanhood: beauty, a gentle voice, speech, skill in needlework, wisdom and chastity.\n\nPopular Irish girl names: what you need to know about the name Eimear\n\nPronunciation: Ee-mer\n\nMeaning: It’s thought that the name comes from the Irish word ‘Eimh’ which means ‘Swift’ or ‘Ready’\n\nFamous Eimear’s: Eimear Quinn (singer and composer) Eimear McBride (author)\n\n7. Caragh\n\nCaragh is a popular Irish girls name that is considered to be a variant to the more commonly known name outside of Ireland, ‘Cara’.\n\nBelieved to mean either ‘Beloved’ or ‘Friend’, the name Caragh has a gorgeous Irish twang to it.
