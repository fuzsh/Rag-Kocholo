        "text": "Owing to rich and historic Japanese culture, Japanese girl names are some of the most beautiful any parent could choose for their baby girl.\n\nWith more and more parents choosing to give their children more unique names, it's no surprise to see Japanese girl names rising in popularity around the world, as well as Japanese boy names - and even other cultures like Egyptian names. After all, what could be more unique than a name written in totally different script?!\n\nJapanese names often carry several meanings, so it can be tough to choose one. We'll bring you into the world of Japanese name culture and how they're written, and bring you some of our absolute favourites, from popular Japanese girl names to rare Japanese girl names, and everything in between.\n\nYou may not know that the number seven is very important in Japanese culture, which is why we've got 107 of the very best, beautiful Japanese girl names for you.\n\nThe history of names in Japanese culture\n\nThe Japanese language is primarily made-up of kanji characters, the symbols we think of that come from the Chinese language.\n\nHowever, kanji characters can have different meanings or pronunciations. And then there are hiragana or katakana characters, simplified versions of the kanji, each with their own set of meanings and pronunciations.\n\nIn modern Japanese society, it is more common to see a baby girl given a name containing just one kanji. Throughout history, though, it was considered more meaningful to give a baby girl two or even three kanji characters. That's why you will see plenty of names on this list that combine two separate names into one.\n\nIt's very common for Japanese girl names to end in ko, a suffix meaning 'child'. This harks back to a time when\n\nYou may have also noticed that the Japanese people use their surname or family name first, and their given name second.\n\nPopular Japanese names for a baby girl\n\nLet's start off with the most popular Japanese girl names. These names on this list are a combination of the most popular names for girls in Japan, and the most popular Japanese girl names outside of Japan.\n\n1. Akari\n\nAkari simply means 'light'. But it is also the name of the Japanese lamps that use very thin paper to create a warm glow.\n\n2. Aoi\n\nAoi means 'hollyhock', a bright and colour flower loved by gardeners around the world. You'll soon see that nature-inspired names are incredibly popular in Japan, especially for girls.\n\n3. Ema\n\nEma is the Japanese version of Emma, which is, of course, very popular across Europe and English-speaking countries. And they do have different meanings - Emma means 'universal' or 'whole', whereas Ema's most common meanings are 'to bloom', 'flourish' or 'blossom'.\n\n4. Hana\n\nAnother different spelling of a popular Western name, Hana simply means 'flower'.\n\nThe Hebrew version, Hannah, means 'grace'. So, there's definitely a lovely connection between the two.\n\n5. Hina\n\nSitting comfortably in the top 10 in recent years, Hina is comprised of two characters meaning 'sunshine' and 'plants'.\n\n6. Naomi\n\nI bet you didn't realise Naomi was a Japanese name! Well, it does have both Hebrew and Japanese origins.\n\nIn Hebrew, it means 'pleasant', while the Japanese version means 'beautiful'. It's also commonly used for boys in Japan, too.\n\n7. Himari\n\nHimari was the most popular name for a Japanese baby girl in 2021, earning itself a spot on this list. Its kanji characters mean 'sunshine' and 'hollyhock'.\n\nYou may have noticed it Aoi and Himari both mean 'hollyhock'. That's because aoi and ari are different pronunciations of the kanji character 葵.\n\n8. Jun\n\nOne of the most popular Japanese names for girls and boys, Jun's most common interpretations are around 'purity' and 'cleanliness'.\n\nYou may also come across Junko, making the name 'pure child'.\n\n9. Mei\n\nMei is not just consistently one of the most popular Japanese names, it's also one of the most beautiful Japanese girl names, especially with a meaning like 'budding sprout'.\n\n10. Reina\n\nEuropean football fans may think of the Spanish goalkeeper Pepe Reina, but Reina is actually a very popular girls name in Japan which means 'wise'.\n\nWisdom is considered a very desirable trait for the Japanese people, so it's hardly surprising to see names meaning 'wise' or wisdom' among the most popular.\n\n11. Riko\n\nThe first name on this list to use the suffix ko, meaning 'child'. The Ri means 'jasmine', so put them together and Riko means 'jasmine child'.\n\nParents who give their daughter a name like this hope she grows up to be as beautiful as white jasmine flower.\n\n12. Rin\n\nRin is another name that popular for a Japanese girl or boy. It means 'dignified'.\n\n13. Sakura\n\nSakura is perhaps best known in the Western world for the anime series Naruto. You probably know that the cherry blossom tree is synonymous with Japanese culture, and that's the meaning of Sakura.\n\nIf you wanted to call your daughter your 'beautiful cherry blossom', you would say 'Utsukushī Sakura'.\n\n14. Tsumugi\n\nTsumugi is a thin, soft cloth made from silk, which means this name carries a lot of connections to words like 'delicate', 'beautiful', 'grace' and 'refined'.\n\n15. Yua\n\nYua is a Japanese girl's name that sounds as sweet as its meaning. Yu means 'to tie' or 'to bound', while a means 'love'. Combined, the name Yua means 'bound by love', which is just the most precious meaning for a little girl.\n\n16. Yūna\n\nYuna is a combination of Yua and Hina, meaning this baby girl will grow up 'bound to plants' or 'bound to nature'.\n\nTraditional Japanese baby girl names\n\nJapanese names, just like any other country or culture's names, come and go. One minute they're the trendy name to use, the next minute they're cast into obscurity.\n\nThere are, however, Japanese girl names that stand the test of time. They have defied trends and remained popular for generations. They may not always be the most popular, but they've certainly stuck around.\n\n17. Akemi\n\nAkemi was once the most popular Japanese girls name, in 1965. It's got a lovely meaning behind it; 'tomorrow's beauty'. It has also been linked to 'pure beauty'.\n\n18. Chiyo\n\nChiyo means 'one thousand generations'. It's been over a century since it was top of baby name charts for Japanese girls, but it has made somewhat of a comeback in recent years, perfectly showcasing its longevity.\n\n19. Fumiko\n\nFumiko is a great example of parents hoping to inspire a certain life upon their little girl. It mean's 'wealthy beautiful child'.\n\n20. Hanako\n\nHanako means 'flower child', and is another example of Japanese girl names being linked to nature.\n\nAs you may have guessed, it's the combination of Hana, meaning 'flower', and the suffix ko that we explained earlier.\n\nMany parents give their baby girl the full name Hanako with the intention of calling her Hana.\n\n21. Kanako\n\nIf you want your little girl to have plenty of friends, you might name her Kanako, which roughly translates to 'child who gets along well with others'.\n\n22. Kaori\n\nKaori is a name that requires you to look between the lines of the literal meanings. Taken literally, Kaori means 'scented woven fabric' which isn't a particularly inspiring meaning.\n\nThe character 香 means scent, but one that is intoxicating over overwhelming, while 織 means 'woven'. In a metaphorical sense, it is hoped that Kaori's life will be woven with love and good fortune.\n\n23. Keiko\n\nKeiko is a sweet name meaning either 'graceful child' or 'blessed child, and it's that first meaning that makes it the Japanese version of the name Grace.\n\n24. Mayumi\n\nMayumi is the name of the Japanese spindle tree, known for its elegance and supple branches. It is thought that the spindle tree represents the grace and beauty of a woman.\n\n25. Ruka\n\nRuka means 'lapis flower', a bright purple flower with very delicate petals.\n\n26. Sachiko\n\nWhat is the one thing we want for our baby girl? Hopefully you answered 'for her to be happy'. Well, Sachiko is a very traditional name meaning 'happy child'.\n\n27. Suiren\n\nSuiren is name that is both traditional and unique, with a wonderful meaning behind it. The literal translation is 'sleeping lotus', a term used to described a water lily.\n\n28. Tamao\n\nTamao is one of the older sounding Japanese girl names. Think about what you would consider to be a Western grandmother's name, and that's what Tamao is in Japan.\n\nIt has quite a unique meaning, though, 'central pearl.\n\n29. Tomoe\n\nArguably the most famous female warrior in Japan's history, Tomoe is one of the strongest Japanese baby names you could give your daughter.\n\n30. Ume\n\nPronounced 'you-mee', Ume blossom is a tree native to China but also found in Japan. Also know as the plum blossom or Japanese apricot, ume blossoms symbolise resilience given that they bloom at the height of winter.\n\nCute Japanese girl names\n\nSo many Japanese girl names are incredibly sweet, both in how they sound and the meanings behind them. The suffix ko, meaning 'child', is enough to make any name that bit sweeter.\n\nThese are our favourite cute Japanese girl names.\n\n31. Akiko\n\nThis Japanese girls name means 'autumn child', making it an sweet and apt choice for a baby girl born during the autumn months.\n\n32. Ami\n\nPronounced just like Amy, this is a name sometimes given to a second born baby girl. The a typically means second, while mi means 'beautiful'. So it's like called her your 'second beautiful girl'.\n\n33. Aya\n\nAya is one of the cutest Japanese girl names, in my opinion at least!\n\nIt means 'colour' or 'design', but it's more specifically linked with the vibrancy of colour and design.\n\n34. Ayami\n\nTrying to claim a spot on our list of ocean names for girls and boys, Ayami takes the 'vibrancy' from Aya and applies it to the ocean to give the meaning 'vibrancy of the ocean'.\n\n35. Chiha\n\nThe sky is the limit for a little Chiha, whose name means 'one thousands wings'. It's a name and meaning that is usually associated with doves or butterflies.\n\n36. Chika\n\nChika is a lovely name meaning 'scattered flowers'. The literal translation is 'a thousand flowers', but the consensus is that in order for there to be a thousand flowers, they'd have to be pretty scattered.\n\n37. Emi\n\nEmi is such an adorable Japanese girl name. Pronounced in the same way we would say 'Emmy', it is known to mean 'beautiful picture'.\n\n38. Etsuko\n\nEtsuko really is one of the most beautiful Japanese names, with a meaning like 'joy child'.\n\nIt's a name that perfectly summarises both the type of life you hope for your daughter, but also the impact she'll have on your life.\n\n39. Hanae\n\nGiven how close it is to Hana (flower), it's perhaps no surprise to see that Hanae means 'blossom'.\n\n40. Hoshiko\n\nIf you want to inspire a love of the night sky in your baby girl, Hoshiko might be the name for you. It means 'star child'.\n\n41. Hinata\n\nHinata has a couple of similar meanings all related to the sun, including 'sunny place', 'towards the sun' or 'sunflower'.\n\n42. Ichika\n\nIchika is an adorable sounding name with several meanings behind it. In some parts, it's interpreted to mean 'one summer'.\n\nIt has also been connected with words such as 'love', 'hope', 'beginning', 'flower', 'beautiful', 'affection' or 'fragrance'.\n\n43. Izumi\n\nIzumi means 'spring', but perhaps not in the sense you might expect.\n\nWhile it's commonly used for a baby girl born in spring, Izumi is an ancient samurai town on Japan's most southerly major island, Kyushu, known for its water springs. As such, some have adapted the meaning to 'fountain'.\n\n44. Kei\n\nThere are plenty of unisex names in Japanese culture, and Kei is one of the more popular. It sounds very cute but is quite peculiar when it comes to the meaning.\n\nIt has multiple meanings including 'intelligent', 'to congratulate', 'respect', 'joyous', 'blessed', and 'gemstone'.\n\n45. Kiku\n\nWhile plenty of Japanese baby girl names refer to 'flower' generally, Kiku is one that has a meaning related to a specific flower, the chrysanthemum.\n\n46. Koharu\n\nKoharu is a lovely name for a baby girl born in the late summer months. It means, you guessed it, 'late summer'.\n\n47. Mai\n\nPronounced 'my' rather than 'may', it's a name that means 'dance' or 'brightness'. Dance is the more common interpretation given that it's also the name of a traditional Japanese form of dance.\n\n48. Maiko\n\nIf Mai means dance and ko means child, we get...'dancing child'.\n\n49. Miho\n\nAny name containing mi will have a connection with the word 'beautiful', while the ho means 'protect'.\n\n50. Mio\n\nAs we've seen already on this list, mi means 'beautiful' while the o can mean either 'thread' or 'cherry blossom'.\n\nIt has been linked to 'beautiful blossom', but 'beautiful cherry blossom' seems the more likely interpretation.\n\n51. Mika\n\nNo, not the high-pitched, curly haired singer who released Grace Kelly in 2007. But it is pronounced in the same way! It means 'beautiful flower'.\n\n52. Mitsuki\n\nMitsuki is one of those Japanese baby girl names that sounds incredibly traditional yet absolutely adorable. It means 'beautiful moon'.\n\n53. Miyu\n\nMiyu is a sweet name with quite a magical meaning behind it.\n\nIt means 'ocean dream', and parents often give this name to their baby girl in the hope that her hopes and dreams will be as vast and deep and the oceans.\n\n54. Moriko\n\nAs someone who loves spending time in the forest, I'll admit I was quite taken with the name Moriko. It means 'forest child'.\n\n55. Natsuko\n\nAlong with Koharu, Natsuko is a popular choice for a baby girl born in summer because it means...'summer child'.\n\n56. Noa\n\nNoah has consistently been one of the most popular boy names in the UK and US in recent years, but this spelling is a Japanese girls name.\n\n57. Rei\n\nRei (can also be spelled 'Rai') is the Japanese word for 'beautiful' or 'graceful'. There are also interpretations linking it to 'bell'.\n\n58. Saki\n\nSaki means 'to bloom', so it's a popular name to give to a baby girl born in spring. Given the connection, over time it has become known to mean 'spring child' as well as 'bloom'.\n\n59. Sayo\n\nSayo is a sweet-sounding Japanese name with an intriguing meaning. It means 'sand world'.\n\nAnd while that may seem an odd choice, the Japanese people think of its beautiful white sandy beaches, rather than the dry deserts of the world.\n\n60. Shiori\n\nShiori is a lovely Japanese girls name with plenty of meanings, so you can probably take your pick.\n\nThe most literal translation is 'bookmark', making it a popular choice with book lovers. However, others have also connected it to words such as 'poem', 'graceful' and 'weave'.\n\n61. Tsukiko\n\nTsukiko means 'moon child', and could be used for a baby girl born on the night of a full moon.\n\n62. Yuriko\n\nYuriko is one of the more popular Japanese names for girls, which is hardly surprising given that it means 'lily child'.\n\n63. Yui\n\nA soft and delicate name for a Japanese baby girl meaning 'excellence' or 'superiority'.\n\nUnique Japanese girl names\n\nThere are definitely plenty of unique or rare Japanese girl names that could be exactly what you're looking for. Now, rare or unique could be mean different things.\n\nIt could be a popular Japanese name with a truly unique meaning, it could be a Japanese name that you really don't see or hear often, or it could be the translation of a Western name that has gained popularity in Japan.\n\nWhatever the reason, here are some of our favourite unique Japanese girl names.\n\n64. Amaya\n\nA Japanese girl name that you could imagine being a more western name, Amaya perhaps sounds better than its meaning.\n\nThe most common interpretation is 'night rain', which sounds quite intriguing. However, it's also been taken to mean 'mother city', and ominously, 'the end'.\n\n65. Anji\n\nPronounced just like the Western name Angie, Anji means 'purple apricot'. And while natural names for girls are very common in Japan, 'purple apricot' is a very specific meaning and makes this one unique.\n\n66. Ariel\n\nThis name had a surge in popularity after the Disney classic The Little Mermaid was released in 1991 (it's US release was 1989, but didn't come out in Japan until two years later!).\n\nThat's because the Japanese characters 泡姫 translate to 'bubble princess', which could be pronounced as either Arieru or...Ariel.\n\n67. Chiaki\n\nChiaki is a really fascinating Japanese girls name. It's typically taken to mean either 'gathered wisdom' or 'sparkling light'.\n\n68. Chiyoko\n\nChiyoko is a name that reflect on familial and cultural heritage, meaning 'child of a thousand generations'.\n\n69. Daiana\n\nDaiana is the Japanese spelling of Diana and is pronounced in the same way.\n\nLittle Daiana's started popping up during the 80s and 90s thanks to the impact the late Princess Diana of Wales had on the country's people.\n\nAs she was in many countries around the world, Diana was loved by the Japanese people.\n\n70. Eren\n\nEren certainly isn't a name with Japanese origins, but is has grown in usage in recent years, thanks largely to the US talkshow host, Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nThe closest translations or meanings of Eren are 'pure heart, 'forever and ever' or 'blessed'.\n\n71. Fuyuko\n\nWhen the birth of your baby girl brings all the joy and warmth to your lives in the cold and crisp of winter, Fuyuko is the name for you. The kanji combine to translate to 'winter child'.\n\n72. Honoka\n\nIf you want your baby girl to defy gender stereotypes and the delicacy that is behind so many Japanese girl names, Honoka could be a great chance.\n\nIt means 'beautiful flame', suggesting a certain spark and danger.\n\n73. Karen\n\nDespite what the name Karen has become in western society, the Japanese version means 'flower', 'lotus' or 'water lily', which makes it rather lovely.\n\nThere's also a greater emphasis on the ren, giving it another distinction from the western version.\n\n74. Kyō\n\nA gender neutral name, Kyō typically means to 'unite' or 'cooperate'. However, it can also mean 'capital city' (Kyoto, the former Japanese capital), 'village', or 'apricot'.\n\n75. Marin\n\nMarilyn Monroe was a hugely popular figure in Japan and sparked the use of the name Marin, which itself means 'seven seas'.\n\n76. Miran\n\nMiran is one of the rarer Japanese girl names that is rising in popularity thanks to a child actress. It means 'turquoise sky'.\n\n77.
