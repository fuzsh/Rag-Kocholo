In the letter, one of the things she said was \"thank you for teaching me how to be a good man\".\n\nThe English textbook isn't very good - it has lots of spelling mistakes, for example. But my friend wants to know what the textbook should have said instead.\n\nWould you say \"how to be a good woman\"? Or \"how to be a good person\"? What would be more normal English?\n\nThe sentence was in the following paragraph:\n\nMom, I know I have never written even a note to express my thanks to you before. But today, on this special occasion, I just want to tell you loudly [sic]: I love you mom! Thank you so much for not only giving birth to my [sic], but also teaching me how to be a good man. Thank you, mom, for all what [sic] you have done for me, for the whole family."
