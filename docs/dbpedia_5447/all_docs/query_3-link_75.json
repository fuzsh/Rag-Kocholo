        "text": "Attractive people have an advantage in the job search and advancing in their careers. We talk about all types of biases, but largely ignore the fact that decisions are made based upon how someone looks. While deep down, we all kind of know that this is sort of true, a new University of Buffalo study confirms this inconvenient and uncomfortable fact.\n\nSeparately, a Harvard study previously confirmed,“Workers of above average beauty earn about 10 to 15% more than workers of below-average beauty. The size of this beauty premium is economically significant and comparable to the race and gender gaps in the U.S. labor market.” For example, you tend to see generally tall men as CEOs of major corporations and winning presidential candidates.\n\nThe findings of the UB study show, “Attractive people are more likely to get hired, receive better evaluations and get paid more.” The results indicate that there is something called a “beauty premium” that exists across professions.\n\nMin-Hsuan Tu, assistant professor in the organization and human resources department and lead author on the study, said, “People like pretty or handsome people—that’s traditionally viewed as a bias, because pretty or handsome people could get more opportunities, we give them more resources, so they’re more likely to be successful.”\n\nBeing “good-looking really does pay off,” as “decades of research have shown that attractive individuals are more likely to get ahead in their careers.” There is also a related feature; attractive people know that they possess good looks, and capture the attention of people. They believe that they have more attributes, in addition to their looks, that make them smarter and more capable. They have a certain aura around them. This swagger leads to “favorable career outcomes.”\n\nData from 300 video-interview elevator pitches indicated that attractive individuals had a “greater sense of power than their less attractive counterparts” and exhibited a more effective nonverbal presence, which ultimately led to higher managerial ratings of their hirability.\n\nYou don’t have to worry if you’re unattractive. As someone who is about a 6.5 out of 10, I’ve learned that there are ways to compensate and actually do better than good-looking people.\n\nHere’s how you can increase your attractiveness in an interview to enhance and elevate your career:\n\nVisual Tips For Success\n\nIn a video or in-person interview, you want to dress the part for the role. Find out the corporate culture and dress accordingly. Wear attire that is slightly above the role you’re interviewing for to make the subtle impression that you are the right fit.\n\nThink back to what your mom and dad said when you were a kid: sit up straight, head held up high, pull your shoulders back and look the person in the eyes. Stay grounded, don’t squirm, fidget or look at your phone. Avoid overanalyzing or getting fixated on how you look in the video and pay rapt attention to the interviewer.\n\nLightly nod your head as the interviewer speaks to show you are engaged in the conversation. Use the person’s name, as it gets their attention. Smile and maintain direct eye contact. Don’t let your eyes wander or stare for too long. If you are uncomfortable with eye contact, focus on the bridge of the nose, or if you wear glasses, take them off and the other person will look blurry and you’ll feel more at ease.\n\nYour body language should come across as confident, open, friendly and assured. Don’t scrutinize the interviewer, as if you are a cop interrogating a witness. Avoid crossing your arms over your chest, tap the table, sigh or frown, even if you don’t agree with what the person is saying.\n\nThe Likability Factor\n\nIn addition to looks, hiring decisions are also made based upon likability. An applicant may hold all of the necessary required skills, but comes across as conceited or arrogant. The boss is human, and most likely wants to work with someone who will make their life easier and could forge a comfortable rapport with their direct report.\n\nTo demonstrate likability, you need to be genuinely interested in other people. Really listen to what the interviewer says, instead of just waiting for your turn to talk. Focus on the interviewer, as if they are the only person who exists. Slightly nod your head when they are speaking, as it shows that you are in agreement and listening intently. Repeat back important phrases that the interview said to both show you are paying attention and ensuring that you are on the same page. Don’t interrupt by cutting the person off mid-sentence, even if you have something genius to say.\n\nMirror the interviewer’s speech pattern. Offer sincere compliments. If an uncomfortable topic arises, such as why you were let go during the pandemic, it's easy to get flustered and frustrated having to relive this tough time. However, you need to be extra positive about the situation, “It was disappointing to be laid off after10 years with the company, but I understand that the firm was in a difficult financial situation. In a way, I’m glad that it happened. I became too complacent and would have stayed there another 10 years. It's time for me to pursue a new and exciting role that I’m passionate about, and I believe this job is perfect for my background and experience.”\n\nConfidently speak and be enthusiastic. Use your voice as if it's a musical instrument to keep the listener engaged. If you drone on and speak in a monotone voice, you'll quickly lose your audience.\n\nPrepare your answers and talking points before the meeting. It will make you feel more in control and have go-to responses if you feel lost. Give relatively short, concise on-topic answers to direct questions. Don’t talk in circles, evading an answer. If you don’t have a response, it's fine to say, “I’m not familiar with that matter, but I am very knowledgeable about X.” Then, segue into offering a couple of selling points on why they should hire you.\n\nBy following these suggestions and adding to them, you will come across as a positive, motivated, happy, enthusiastic person. The likability factor, coupled with the relevant experiences and skills, will beat out the attractive person who has the looks, but lacks substance."
