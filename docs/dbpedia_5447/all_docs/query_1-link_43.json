        "text": "Choosing a name for your girl dog requires some creative inspiration and plenty of thought. After all, this is a name that you’ll be saying to your new puppy every day for many happy years ahead. Like human baby girl names, female dog names rise and fall in popularity. It’s unlikely you’re meeting a lot of human toddlers named Ethel at preschool today, and similarly, you probably don’t meet many female puppy dogs named Lassie at the dog park anymore.\n\nWe’ve compiled the top 100+ most popular girl dog names from American Kennel Club’s purebred registration and mixed-breed enrollment data for 2022 to help you make the best choice.\n\nTrending Girl Dog Name Themes\n\nPopular culture is always a trending theme for female dog names. When the movie “Frozen” came out, there was a 900 percent rise in dogs named after that cast of characters, so there were plenty of “Elsa” girl puppies for a while. Video game character names for girl dogs, like “Zelda” and “Ellie,” are always trending in and out. Names from movies, books, TV or streaming series, and music are always coming in and out of style, such as:\n\nBella (“Twilight” franchise)\n\nTaylor (of pop music fame)\n\nWillow, Abigail, Marjorie, Betty, Inez, Cornelia, Meredith, or August (for all the Swifties out there)\n\nLeia (“Star Wars” franchise)\n\nPrincess (Disney universe of characters)\n\nNala (Disney)\n\nMinnie (Disney)\n\nNature-themed girl dog names continue to be popular, with names like “Daisy” or “River.” The night sky is extremely popular, with dog names like “Luna,” “Nova,” or “Stella” all high on the list. Food- and drink-themed names are also a favorite, with female puppy names like “Ginger,” “Honey,” and “Pepper” making the list. Mythology is popular for girl dog names, too, with “Freya,” and “Athena” making appearances.\n\nHow to Choose a Girl Dog’s Name\n\nIt’s not all about a cute or clever name when you’re naming your girl dog. A female puppy’s name is an important part of her training and socialization. Take some advice from experts in the field:\n\nChoose a name with one or two syllables. These are easiest to say and short enough to keep your girl dog’s attention.\n\nConsider a female puppy name with hard consonants, which may be easier for dogs to hear than sibilant sounds, like “Gracie” or “Bailey.”\n\nTry not to choose a girl puppy name that sounds similar to a command. Avoid names like “Kit,” which sounds like “sit,” or “Poe,” which sounds like “no.”\n\nWhen a girl dog hears her name, it’s a signal that whatever is coming next is meant for her. So use her name frequently in a positive context so she doesn’t associate it with punishment or anything negative or scary.\n\nDon’t name a female dog something that sounds a lot like the name of another family member. If your daughter is “Annie” and the dog is “Franny,” the dog (or your daughter) may be confused and not know when to respond.\n\nTake a little time to get to know your new pet. Sometimes, her looks or behavior will inspire the perfect name. But, if you’re still stuck, this list of our top 100+ girl dog names may help you decide.\n\nMost Popular Girl Dog Names"
