It's just like calling someone a \"best friend\". In most cases, people have multiple friends, all of equal importance, all \"best friends\".\n\nFor people, there are so many beautiful people in the world that singling one out as \"the most beautiful\" is a hyperbole. However, the effect of saying\n\nYou're the most beautiful man/woman I've ever seen.\n\nIs profoundly less romantic if you say, in an attempt to not 'lie',\n\nYou're one of the most beautiful men/women I've ever seen\n\nI need a way to rephrase this sentiment such that it implicitly acknowledges the untruth of the notion of a singularly \"beautiful\" person, without diminishing the truth of feeling behind the statement \"You're the most beautiful man/woman I've ever seen\".\n\nFor example: There have been several women, at various stages of my life, who have so enthralled me that I consider them all among \"the most beautiful women I've ever seen\". I knew I would be lying if I told a current partner, \"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen\", since this neglects the truth that I in middle school there was someone else I felt the same about, and her occupation of this position in my memory is not irrelevant, and to ignore it would be untruthful.\n\nThe assumption here is that anyone who thinks their partner is \"the most beautiful person in the entire world\" is not owning to the truth that they likely will encounter other people they would feel the same way about."
