Whether you have Italian heritage, have spent a lot of time in Italy, or are just looking for a lovely name for your baby girl from this melodic and charming language, we have 150 pretty, traditional and rare Italian girl names to inspire you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom rare and old-fashioned Italian names with rich Latin and Roman heritage such as Lelia and Romola, to more recognisable, popular options such as Gabriella and Gemma, our list of the best Italian girl names will help you pick the perfect name for your little bambina.\n\nLooking for more inspiration?

With some exceptions, masculine names end in o and feminine names end in a, which is why you will see so many names in our list with the beautiful and positive 'a' sound at the end.\n\nHere's our list of Italian girl names to help inspire you...\n\nTop Italian girl names | Unique Italian girl names | Beautiful Italian girl names | Old-fashioned Italian girl names\n\nTop Italian girl names\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, not many names of Italian origin make it into the top 100 names in the United Kingdom, with some notable exceptions such as Isabelle, Cara and Bella.
