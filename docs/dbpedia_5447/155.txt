It was 1990 when Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel, was the central filming location for the movie “Pretty Woman.” And now you can be the star of your own love story with our expertly crafted take on the film.

Enjoy over-the-top accommodations in one of our highly sought-after Penthouse or Presidential Specialty Suites, and indulge in a variety of VIP offerings: a behind-the-scenes tour of Rodeo Drive’s most famous fashion houses with your personal wardrobe consultant and stylist, an exclusive dining experience at Michelin-recommended CUT by Wolfgang Puck, and a romantic chef’s dinner for two in the privacy of your luxurious suite. Retreat to our award-winning Beverly Hills Spa for your own individual 90-minute massage and allow our Bath Attendant to continue the lavish experience in your accommodation with a hand-drawn bath using personalized aromatherapy oils. You’ll also enjoy a dining etiquette lesson and bespoke picnic at a nearby park, complete with a musical serenade. No detail is overlooked in this celebrity-style fairy tale.
