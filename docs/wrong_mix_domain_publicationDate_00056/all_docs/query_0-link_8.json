        "text": "My title is not exactly what the man wrote those 36 years ago. But it is an appropriate enough greeting for the author of the much-lauded, seldom-read short story, Farewell to the Master, which was adapted into the sci-fi classic motion picture, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Author Bates in not only alive and well, but planning a comebackmaybe.\n\nThe story was first printed in a pulp magazine called Astounding, of which Bates was an editor, later a publisher. I wrote it very rapidly for quick money, Bates said. I've regretted it all my life since. It's created quite a stir, and it's very poorly written, but I've re-written it along with some others, and when I get a chance, they'll be published in a collectionone which might shine even more brightly than the work of Roger Lee Vernon.\n\nIn the original story, Gnut the robot is the Master and Klaatu the servant. Two changes made in the movie were the substitution of a flying saucer for a time-sphere and a change in the name of the robot.\n\nThe editors all send me very nice letters, but I find the manuscript is not touched! Bates was trying to find the publication date as he talked. Here it is: October, 1940. Astounding Stories and it's had quite a history since. It was on the Lux Radio Show for one hour, and it's been in several anthologies. You know it was the basis for a movie.\n\nBates had high praise for the production end of the movie, but says, It wasn't at all what I had written. Everything got changed, though it was my opinion, along with others, that the story would make a much better movie; but it may be deemed a little too sophisticated for the public, or at least it was at the time the movie came out. But now the public's getting educated and can stand something of higher quality. Did you see Flowers for Algernon' on TV? Drink?\n\nIn his Astounding days, Bates received several story submissions from other noteworthy authors, though he had trouble getting his immediate superior interested in them.\n\nHe had certain prejudices. For one thing, he was dead-set against insects. I couldn't get him to buy quality stories. And our other magazine, Weird Tales, all he wanted to buy was the standard ghost stories which God knows is monotonous enough. However, I got him interested enough to buy tales from H.P. Lovecraft, E.E. Smith, Ray Cummings, et al.\n\nAstounding was most recently represented in an anthology volume which printed one story by every author since its inception in the 30s. Bates, of course, was quickly associated with Farewell to the Master.\n\nAnd that's too bad, because I wrote one other story that I really liked much better, especially now that I've re-written it. Comics have got the first. I sat down in a subway one day and there was a comic book beside me. I looked at it and there was a long story and they had all the devices, all the inventions of my story in that comic book. I wasn't paid, I wasn't acknowledged I simply had to laugh. They couldn't have figured the second story I mention out another good laugh. From his many years in the field, Bates still considers himself more an editor than a writer, having edited the science-fiction magazines and a social magazine, and having been technical editor for RCA institutes and book and story editor for David Selznick.\n\nBates was a pioneer of sorts in his field, when sci-fi wasn't particularly acceptable. There was only one real one at the time and that was David Gernsbach, unless you went to count Poe and Wells and Verne.\n\nBates doesn't read or write much sf today. People in today's space operas take Soma. I wish my own stories were better. I had to cleanse myself and re-write them. I wrote in the mainstream, and science fiction is a very good vehicle for parables or sarcasm, social comments and criticism. Farewell to the Master was written on a bet with a friend that he could do this and get paid for it. His editorial position was a secret ace in the hole. Presently, although the rewrites are much better, Bates simply can't get the editors he submits them to interested in them. Science fiction is having a new all-time low, and I figured there was no time like the present, after reading Project: Mastodon, A Gun for Dinosaur, Leg.Forst. and other such gems as I was seeing cut even in Galaxy. Then I realized it was TOO lowGalaxy was coming out with Help! I Am Professor Morris Goldpepper! and there was a thing in F&SF called The Silver Eggheads, purportedly written by Fritz Leiber. Then the magazines got kind of flat. They write you these letters and tell you how much they enjoy the stories, but the two pages stuck together toward the end, your evidence that they weren't even read, is still immaculate. They just don't want it to work with you is the secret.\n\nBates is nevertheless optimistic that they will all see print soon. He reached and gave his personal assurance: You'll enjoy them. I can't write for any jerk just off the street, but someone who's intelligent and understands big words and ironies and social criticisms may adjust. Not that I tinker them to everyone in my stories, but this is the level that I write at and it just seems natural to me. I'll bet anything that you'll like a couple of them at least.\n\nUnfortunately Mr. Bates bet his life on the proposition, but as a final story concerned the process of his own reincarnation, it might not be Farewell to the Master at allit just might be Welcome Back. Especially if the public outcry is great enough."
