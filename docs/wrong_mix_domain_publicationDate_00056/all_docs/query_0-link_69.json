        "text": "The goal of this project is to codify the works of science fiction that any decently sized public library should have available to its patrons.\n\nThe inspiration for the project was a conversation with a librarian at the Westfield, NJ public library. I expressed surprise at how many of the most important works of the genre were not on the shelf. She asked me “well, what should be in the collection,” and asked me to get back to them with an answer. The Essential Science Fiction Library is an attempt to to provide it.\n\nThis is not a “best of” list, nor is it a list of my favorites. I have compiled information from dozens of other lists and sources, and created a group of books that represents a kind of core canon for the genre as a whole, including works from the major subgenres. The ESFL is also not designed as a reading list, though it does serve that purpose quite well. A serious science fiction enthusiast will probably have read many or even most of the books on the A-List, and those who haven’t done so would be well-served by reading some more of them.\n\nThe books in each category are listed alphabetically by author.\n\nI welcome all comments and feedback, either directly to me via the contact page or in the comments section below.\n\np.s. A new revision is in the works."
