If you consume any amount of dreampunk, you’ll notice certain motifs repeating a lot, almost as if all the authors agreed to draw their imagery from a common pool of “dreamy” elements. Aside from the obligatory Alice in Wonderland references that everybody tends to make, these are the most common recurring motifs I’ve noticed. I’m not basing these on any systematic study of the literature, mind you, just my informal observations.
