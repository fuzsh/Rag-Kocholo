On the line was the secretary general of the Swedish Academy of Sciences who informed the professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena that he was the sole recipient of the 1999 Nobel prize for chemistry, the first Egyptian to win a science Nobel.\n\nAfter reading aloud the Nobel citation, the Swede passed the phone to three other members of the awards committee, who each in turn praised Zewail’s contribution to science before handing the line back to the secretary- general. “In 20 minutes we will be announcing it to the world — these are the last 20 minutes of peace in your life,” he warned"
