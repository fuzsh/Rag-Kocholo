        "text": "Editor's note:Â This article will be continually updated with information about the newly announced Nobel Prize winners and access to their research.\n\nThis week, select scientists from around the world will receive the \"magic call.\" Winning the Nobel Prize is a crowning achievement that represents decades of probing research that has had a profound impact on humanity. Their contributions reinforce the role of research as a driver of progress.\n\nConfidence in research is not something we can take for granted, of course. Science is constantly being challenged by controversies and misinformation. The Nobel Prize can help restore this confidence. The Laureates are among the millions of researchers worldwide who collaborate across borders and disciplines, sharing their diverse perspectives to solve complex problems. The prize also serves as a reminder of the importance of peer-reviewed research that withstands scrutiny.\n\nAt Elsevier, we're proud to highlight that most of the Nobel Laureates in science and economics have published in our journals and books â 217 out of 218 since the year 2000, according to aÂ ScopusÂ analysis â and some have also served as editors, editorial board members or reviewers.\n\nThe rigor and integrity they bring to their work can help reinforce the confidence in research that is so important to societal progress.\n\nTo honor this yearâs Nobel Laureates and the community that made their breakthroughs possible, we are bringing together a selection of their most cited papers published with Elsevier. Their work will, in turn, empower todayâs scientists to make further discoveries.\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicineopens in new tab/window was awarded jointly to jointly to Katalin KarikÃ³ and Drew Weissman \"for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\"\n\nThe discoveries these two scientists made played a critical role in developing effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Their findings changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, contributing to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.\n\nCommenting on the award, Peter Lee, Editor-in-Chief of the journal Immunity said,\n\n\"The Immunity article âSuppression of RNA recognition by Toll-like receptors: The impact of nucleoside modification and the evolutionary origin of RNAâÂ referenced both in the Nobel Prize press release and in subsequent coverage of the prize, reported the criticalÂ conceptual breakthrough that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines. We at Cell Press and at Elsevier are proud to be the venue to communicate this important finding and would like to celebrateÂ our authors on their monumental accomplishment.\n\n\"We wholeheartedly congratulate Drs. KarikÃ³ and Weissman for the well-deserved Nobel Prize. Their work has already saved countless lives during the pandemic and will continue to revolutionize the prevention and treatment of diseases. This prize highlights the importance of understanding fundamental science, which leads to profound impact on human well-being.\"\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics opens in new tab/windowwas awarded jointly to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'Huillier. The award recognizes their work in exploring the world of electrons inside atoms and molecules, demonstrating a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to measure the rapid processes in which electrons move or change energy.\n\nEva Olsson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics commented: âWe can now open the door to the world of electrons. Attosecond physics gives us the opportunity to understand mechanisms that are governed by electrons. The next step will be utilising them.\"\n\nDavid Clary, Editor of the Elsevier journal Chemical Physics Impact, commented:\n\nChemical physicists will be delighted by the award of the 2023 Nobel Prize for Physics to three pioneers of attosecond spectroscopy. Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'HuillierÂ developed new experimental methods that enable electron dynamics to be followed on a timescale of one billionth of a billionth of a second. The early ground-breaking work of these Nobel Laureates involved examining the effects of intense laser pulses on simple atomic gases but their methods are now having wide applications to the ultrafast study of liquids, metals and even biological systems. In the great tradition of chemical physics, their experimental results have been backed up by theoreticians whose calculations using the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation have helped to explain the details of the motion of electrons on an attosecond timescale.\n\nThe previous Nobel Prize related to this work was the 1999 award for Chemistry to Ahmed Zewail who was then the Editor of the Elsevier journalÂ Chemical Physics Letters. Zewail pioneered the study of the dynamics of atoms and molecules on a femtosecond timescale, one thousand times longer than the 2023 PrizeÂ for attosecond breakthroughs."
