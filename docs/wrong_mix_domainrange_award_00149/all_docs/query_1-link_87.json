        "text": "AMMAN — For the first time a Jordanian scientist, Shaher Momani, has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in physics for 2016.\n\nMomani, a professor of Applied Mathematics and Dean of the University of Jordan's science faculty, was nominated for the prize by a group of Jordanian and Arab scientists.\n\nPreviously, Egyptian US-based scientist Ahmad Zewail won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999, and Egyptian novelist Najib Mahfouz won the prize in literature in 1988.\n\n\"The move seeks to break the psychological barrier for Arab scientists and encourage their nomination for the prize,\" Momani told The Jordan Times on Tuesday over phone, noting that no Arab-based scientist has won the Nobel Prize in a scientific field before.\n\n\"Human resources in the Arab world have great potential, but are not fully tapped,\" he said, adding that this potential develops when nurtured in the West. He insisted that encouraging creativity and excellence should begin at home.\n\nSpecialising in fractional calculus and rated among the world's top 10 scientists in the field, Professor Momani is among the most highly cited researchers and influential scientific minds at the international level for 2014-2015, according to the University of Jordan’s website.\n\nThe scientist has published over 250 research papers in first-class international scientific journals and is an editor of over 30 such journals.\n\n\"I have received a lot of messages from local, Arab and international scientists who expressed their support,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the University of Jordan, which is supporting Momani's candidacy, scientists, academics, former Nobel Prize winners and members of the Parliament and the Senate can support Momani by suggesting his name via the link http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/who-deserves.html?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=facebook_page.\n\nCandidates for the Nobel Prize in physics are nominated by chairs of physics departments at universities across the world as well as other scientists selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The Academy then decides on a Nobel Laureate in Physics by majority vote, according to the award's website.\n\nThe Nobel Prizes were created by Alfred Nobel to promote outstanding achievement in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, and for work in peace."
