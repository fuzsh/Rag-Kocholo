        "text": "The Order of Malta and International Women’s Day\n\nSince 2003, the international relief organisation of the Order of Malta (Maltese International) has been arranging itself in the spirit of International Women’s Equaliy Day. They maintain medical centres and trauma centres in crisis areas where women are victims of violence. They also provide prophylactic treatment against the risk of HIV infection.\n\nThe humanitarian aid programmes of the sovereign Order of Malta are available to victims of violence and women in need, including means of self-sufficiency. In cooperation with local authorities, there is a measurable improvement in problem-solving and prevention towards cases of sexual violence.\n\nThe Order of Malta as an independent state\n\nThe Order of Malta is arguably the smallest state in the world (as of 7/2021). The State of the Order of Malta is not always included in the published lists of official states. This could be due to the fact that the legal scholar Jelinek defined a state according to his “three elements doctrine”.\n\nMany still follow the outdated “doctrine”. A state must have state power and possess the territory of the state, in addition to the people. This is opposed to the original legal subjects of international law of sovereign states. These include, in a limited sense, international organisations such as the Holy See, the International Red Cross and the Order of Malta.\n\nSince customary law is also a legal source of international law in addition to treaties, the Order of Malta is to be seen as a state in its own right. However, non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International or Médecins Sans Frontières are in principle not states in the sense of international law.\n\nDiplomatically active worldwide\n\nThe Sovereign Order of Malta is recognised as a State by over 110 countries and the European Union and maintains diplomatic relations with them. The Order of Malta has permanent observer status at the United Nations, as well as the major international institutions, and participates in international legal relations.\n\nThe government of the Sovereign Order of Malta is represented by the Grand Master. The Grand Master speaks as the head of the religious Order of Malta. The Order of Malta is complemented by\n\nthe Grand Commander (religious and spiritual affairs),\n\nthe Grand Chancellor (Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Interior),\n\nthe Grand Hospitaller (Minister of Health and International Cooperation)\n\nand the Preceptor of the Joint Treasury (Minister of Finance).\n\nAll members of the government are elected for 5 years. The Constitution also stipulates that the Pope sends a Cardinal (Cardinal Patron) as his representative to the Order of Malta. The Cardinal promotes the spiritual direction of the Order and maintains relations with the Holy See. The Pope appoints the Superior of the Clergy as Prelate of the Order.\n\nThe neutrality and impartiality of the Order of Malta help to provide efficient humanitarian aid during armed conflicts or natural disasters. For example, the Order of Malta is said to have mediated between South and North Korea, and to have been involved between China and Taiwan.\n\nHymn of the Sovereign Order of Malta\n\nIn 1930 Alfredo Consorti composed the official anthem “Ave Crux Alba” a triumphal march for the Order of Malta. The Grand Master Fra’ Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere then appointed Alfredo Consorti a Donat of the III Class of the Order of Malta in November 1932. The Triumphal March Ave Crux Alba was formally recognized as the official anthem of the Sovereign Order of Malta shortly afterwards. It is still played today in the presence of the Grand Master on state visits and official occasions. The anthem is not sung, only played. However, there is a Latin text.\n\nAve Crux alba, summae pietatis signum,\n\nAve Crux alba, salutis nostra sola spes,\n\nCorda fidelium inflamma, adauge gratiam, adauge gratiam.\n\nUt omnia vincat tuorum ardens caritas,\n\nUt omnia vincat tuorum ardens caritas.\n\nMilitary actions of the Order of Malta\n\nIn retrospect, the Order of Malta would probably be described as a military order. After retreating from the “Holy Land” of Jerusalem, the Knights of Malta conquered the Greek island of Rhodes around 1310 and called themselves Knights of Rhodes at that time. From there they were driven out by the Ottomans under Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, so that in 1923 the Order of Saint John settled for a time on Crete and southern Italy.\n\nAfter a few years without a home in 1530, the Roman-German Emperor Karl V, with the approval of Pope Clement, gave the Order of St John the islands of Malta and Gozo. This gave rise to the present name of the Knights of Malta. At that time, the Ottomans were raiding the coasts of Italy, Catalonia and France and were extremely active militarily in the Mediterranean. The Grand Master of the Order of Malta at the time, Fra’ Jean de la Vallette, had parts of Malta, such as Fort Elmo and Grand Harbour, converted into a fortress.\n\nMany other fortifications can be found from the knightly period in Malta.\n\nIn the article about 77 sights on Malta, you will find many watchtowers and fortifications of the Maltese Knights. In Mellieha is The Red Tower, the Ford St. Agatha from 1645. South of Mistra Bay is Selmun Palace with Fort Campbell. To the west, near Golden Bay, the same Grand Master Lascaris had the Ghajn Tuffieha Tower built and next to it, overlooking Gnejna Bay, the Lippija Tower.\n\nWho are the members of the Order of Malta?\n\nMembers of the Order of Malta traditionally came from the nobility. Today, however, the emphasis is on ethical irreproachability and behaviour of integrity (“Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum”). Living the Christian faith itself, proclaiming it and also defending it, as well as serving the poor and the sick is the vocation of the Order of Malta. The Order of Malta has therefore long ceased to be a military order.\n\nHow many members are there currently?\n\nAccording to the Sovereign Military Hospitaller, the Order has about 13,500 knights, ladies, and clergy. They are permanently supported by up to 80,000 volunteers and over 40,000 employees. The employees are mainly engaged in medical service.\n\nHow does one become a Knight of the Order of Malta?\n\nTo become a Knight of the Order of Malta, active commitment to the Catholic Church is the most important requirement. Candidates for the Order of Malta can demonstrate this by participating in pilgrimages to the sick, voluntary work in parishes, visiting services in hospitals or active nursing care for the seriously ill.\n\nThose who then also succeed in taking on a voluntary leadership function in the Maltese relief service and make voluntary donations above and beyond the annual contribution then only have to wait to be addressed by the Order of Malta. This is because no one can apply to become a Knight of the Order of Malta themselves. At that point, 2 intercessors (guarantors) should then be ready, who are obligatory for the appointment as Knight of the Order of Malta.\n\nThe Knights of the Order are divided into 3 Estates:\n\nStand: Knights of Justice or Professed, they are called Fraters (Brothers).\n\nStand: Oboedienz Knights and Oboedienz Ladies\n\nStand: Order of lay knights\n\nFor each Order, the Order of Malta has established its own admission requirements for the novitiate or formation. They are regulated in detail in the Code of the Order. In summary, the Order of Malta only appoints Knights who are characterized by irreproachable moral and Christian conduct and who have rendered outstanding services to the Sovereign Order of Malta, its institutions and its humanitarian projects over the years.\n\nEither the Grand Priory or the respective National Association is responsible for the examination of the proposals for admission.\n\nBecome a volunteer\n\nThe Order of Malta welcomes any help. Interested persons can contact directly the national Order of Malta of the desired country. In Malta, the representation is located directly in the capital Valletta.\n\nAddresses of the Order of Malta\n\nMaltese Association of the Sovereign Order of Malta\n\nCasa Lanfreducci – 2, Pjazza Jean de Valette – VLT 1104 Valletta – Malta\n\nPhone: +356.21.22.69.19\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nWeb: orderofmalta.mt\n\nVolunteers of the Order (V.O.T.O.)\n\nVolunteer Corps for Home Care\n\nCasa Lanfreducci – 2, Pjazza Jean de Valette – VLT 1104 Valletta – Malta\n\nPhone: +356.21.22.69.19 et +356.21.24.64.06\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nMalta Cross Corps (M.C.C.)\n\nRelief Corps.
