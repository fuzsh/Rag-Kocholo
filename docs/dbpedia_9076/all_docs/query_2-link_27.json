        "text": "The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta was a Catholic Military Order of a military, chivalrous and noble nature, which split into several main orders after Doomsday, in Celtic , South America.and Venice.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPre-Doomsday\n\nFounded in 1099 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Malta was the oldest surviving chivalric order. After the loss of Jersualem in the First Crusade to the Mamluk Sultanate, it became a chartered military order against persecution against Christians. Originally operating on Cyrpus, it moved to Rhodes, Malta and eventually from 1834 in Rome in Palazzo Malta.\n\nDoomsday[]\n\nOn the 27th September 1983 the world was consumed by the chaos that became known as Doomsday. The main headquarters in Rome was destoyed with the strikes upon the city.\n\nPost-Doomsday[]\n\nWith the loss of the central command and collapse of communications, several notable priories were set up.\n\nCeltic Alliance[]\n\nThe forces of the Priory in Ireland initially fared Doomsday well, with the only strike occurring in Northern Ireland. In the first weeks after Doomsday, both Republic and Northern Irish forces and governments worked together to distribute supplies. Alongside other Church institutes, the Order proved effective in maintaning communications. However, in a surprise move, in a meeting between the two governments the Irish Government disestablished its historical ties with the Catholic church to quell rebels in the North, dealing a blow to the Order.\n\nOn Easter 1984, the first Synod of Ireland since 644 met with members of the various churches of the British Isles with one main aim: re-unication. The Declaration of Armagh was made, and with it the unification of the Catholic, Anglican and Scots Presbyterian churches, using a mixture of their existing organisation. With this the Military Order gained a boost in members and support, and was able to continue it's operations.\n\nDespite this, over more recent years both the Celtic Church and the Order have lost many members and much support. As such, in the present day the Priory in Ireland barely exists, with many of the remaining members moving towards the Vatican.\n\nSouth America[]\n\nVenice[]\n\nWith Doomsday, the Order within Venice convened in council and declared a provisional priory government. With the expansion of Venice to parts of the former Yugoslavia, the order was involved in limited medical support.\n\nHowever, 1988 saw the occupation of Venice by the Sicilian Navy, with the Venitian government in exile in Trieste, while the Order was suppressed by the occupying order. However, while the de facto occupation of Venice by the Alpine Confederation saw some decline of the order, it continued to flourish and provide medical support to the local areas,\n\nWith the establishment of contact with South America, the Archbishop of Venice acknowledged Rio, with the Order joining that based in Rio. As such, it has regained its prestige and influence."
