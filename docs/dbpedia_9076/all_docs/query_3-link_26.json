        "meta_description": "The Order of Malta Federal Association, USA: The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta - commonly known as the Order of Malta - is a lay, religious order of the Catholic Church. The Order of Malta - one of the oldest institutions of Western and Christian civilization - was founded in Jerusalem during the eleventh century. Members of the Order seek to glorify God through their work with the poor and the sick and their witness of the Catholic faith. The Order of Malta Federal Association is headquartered in Washington DC.  Hospitaller Regions include: Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Hartford, Houston, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Lancaster, PA, Montgomery County, MD, New Orleans, Northern Virginia, Pittsburgh, St. Joseph, MO, Syracuse, Tallahassee, Washington, DC, and Wilmington.",

        "text": "The origins of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the United States date back to 1927 in New York City with the founding of the American Association. By the 1950's, the membership had grown so geographically diverse that the Sovereign Council established the Western Association in San Francisco to encompass the nine western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. The Order continued to increase in membership over the next twenty years and, in 1974, the Sovereign Council approved the formation of the Southern Association—which is known today as the Federal Association, U.S.A. The Federal Association is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and today its members are found in over twenty regions nationwide.\n\nToday there are well over 3,000 Knights and Dames among the three Associations in the United States. As the U.S. Associations have grown, they have continually expanded the scope of their support of various charitable projects, both domestically and internationally, that align with the mission of the Order—to care for the poor and the sick.\n\nWhile many Knights and Dames have generously supported these projects financially—there has been an equal emphasis upon their hands-on involvement. Members themselves minister to the sick in hospitals and clinics; care for AIDS patients; feed the poor in soup kitchens; clothe and shelter the homeless; tend to and comfort the elderly; aid battered women; staff day care centers for poor, working mothers.\n\nEach of the U.S. Associations holds a variety of special Masses, retreats, and other like-exercises throughout the country for their members to assist them in their continual spiritual development. Like all religious orders, the aim of The Order of Malta is the greater glory of God through the sanctification of its members. Though most members today do not take religious vows—other than that of obedience—the purpose of the Order still is the spiritual development of its members."
