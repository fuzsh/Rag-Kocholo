        "text": "Remote work is here to stay, and millions of people are embracing the work-from-anywhere lifestyle, often referred to as being a “digital nomad.” In fact, some sources estimate that there will be around one billion digital nomads around the world by 2035. And thousands of those nomads may be headed to Spain.\n\nIn 2023, Spain introduced its Digital Nomad Visa, which allows foreigners to live in the nation as residents if they are working remotely for a company based outside of Spain or are self-employed and exclusively use a computer or telecommunication system to work.\n\nReady to learn more? Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering applying for Spain's Digital Nomad Visa.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nThose looking to apply for Spain's Digital Nomad Visa are required to provide proof of income that is “at least 200 percent of the monthly Spanish national minimum wage,” which is approximately $2,704 per month or $32,479 per year, Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website explains. If the applicant travels with family, the first family member must prove “additional financial means of at least 75 percent of the Spanish minimum wage,” or about $1,100 a month. Each additional applicant must show proof of 25 percent of the Spanish national minimum wage.\n\nApplicants must also show a copy of their university degree or professional certificate, confirming that the applicant has “at least three years of experience in his/her business activity” and show proof of working for a foreign company for at least three months prior to applying.\n\nThere is also one special caveat for those who are self-employed: “He/she can also work for a company located in Spain, as long as the percentage of this particular work does not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of his/her professional activity,” the ministry explained.\n\nAdditionally, applicants must show proof of health insurance that is valid in Spain. Digital Nomad Visa holders will not have access to Spain’s public healthcare system. There are, however, companies entirely dedicated to digital nomad health insurance.\n\nWhy Spain Is Great for Digital Nomads\n\nThe benefits of working and living in Spain are pretty endless — and I’m speaking from experience. As someone who lived there in 2010, long before the term “digital nomad” existed, and now lives in its next-door country of Portugal, I can personally attest to how magnificent the historic sites, the food, and the culture really are in Spain. But you don’t need to just take my word for it.\n\n“For me, the main draws of Spain as a digital nomad destination are the low cost of living, the beautiful Mediterranean climate, and the vibrant culture,” Allison Sicking, the travel blogger behind Viva La Travelista, shared. Originally from the United States, Sicking spent time in Mexico as a digital nomad before working her way through the Digital Nomad Visa process in Spain. “I studied abroad in Spain in 2011 and absolutely fell in love with the country and the no pasa nada way of life. I knew from that experience that I wanted to live there one day, and now as a digital nomad, I have the opportunity to make that dream a reality. Plus, having easy access to other European countries for weekend getaways is a major plus.”\n\nThe cost of living is also an attractive reason to go for this visa. According to Expatistan’s calculator, the cost of living in the United States is 62 percent more expensive than living in Spain. Food is about 40 percent more expensive in the U.S. than in Spain, while housing is a whopping 105 percent more expensive in the U.S.\n\nBut you really won’t sacrifice any quality of life for these prices. After all, you’re trading in a more expensive lifestyle for the chance to live in a place that values rest, late-night dining, and savoring great wine — plus, some potential tax savings.\n\n“One of the greatest appeals of the Spain Digital Nomad Visa is access to an improved Non-Resident Income Tax Regime,” Patricia Palacios, the co-founder of España Guide, a travel guide dedicated to promoting her home country of Spain, explained. “As a result, Digital Nomad Visa holders can pay a 24 percent flat tax rate on income, instead of the standard progressive rate (which can reach 48 percent). You can take advantage of this special rate for up to five years.”\n\nHow to Apply\n\nThe process of applying for a Digital Nomad Visa isn’t hard, per se, but there is a fee and a lot of documentation involved, and everything has to be precise. This includes the aforementioned proof of employment or business ownership, financial statements showing proof of income, proof of health insurance coverage that specifically covers any medical costs in Spain, and a criminal background check. After submission, the approval process can take several months, so plan accordingly.\n\n“Another advantage of the Spain Digital Nomad Visa is that you can apply both from abroad or from Spain,” Palacios explained. “If you are abroad, you first need to apply for a visa at the nearest Spanish embassy or consulate. This visa is valid for one year, and afterward, you’re eligible for a two-year renewable residence permit.”\n\nOr, as Palacios shared, if you’re already legally in Spain (which you can do on a tourist visa for up to 90 days as an American citizen), you can apply directly for a three-year visa. The application can be done online through the electronic office of the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security, and Migration.\n\n“Either way, after renewing the visa for a total of five years, you can apply for permanent residence. And, after 10 years, there is a pathway to Spanish citizenship,” Palacios added.\n\nOnce you’re all approved, you’ll need to visit your local police station in Spain, where they’ll take fingerprints and issue your residence card, which has an additional cost of about 15€ (around $16).\n\n“Regarding the processing time, it takes around two months when applying from abroad. It’s usually about half that time when applying from Spain,” Palacios added.\n\nPalacios shared one more tip: Use the application time as a great excuse to come on an extended vacation, and maybe start exploring which neighborhood you want to call home in Spain.\n\n“Even though it’s possible to apply from abroad, it’s a bit easier and much faster to apply while in Spain,” Palacios said. “Just enter the country with a tourist visa and apply on arrival.”\n\nMoving to Spain\n\nOnce you’ve obtained a visa, it’s time to start looking for a place to live. The housing market in Spain varies greatly by city and by season, just like in the U.S.\n\nIn major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, it’s common to find apartment rentals on local listing sites like Idealista or Fotocasa. As Housing Anywhere broke down, the average private room in Madrid will cost around €575 (about $660), a studio apartment is about €990 ($1,070), and a one-bedroom apartment is around €1,500 ($1,625).\n\nHowever, the website warns that “the accommodation hunt in Madrid is fierce,” especially during the end of summer and beginning of fall with incoming students also moving to the city. According to the site, “The high demand also makes the prices go up. So the best advice we can give you would be to start your housing search as early as May.”\n\nIt's also a good idea to learn some Spanish before you move. “Not everyone speaks English, and knowing the language will help daily,” Timon van Basten, a digital nomad in Spain who runs Travel Spain 24, shared. Van Basten said you can use those new language skills to make friends with locals or other expats, too. “There are many digital nomad and expat groups in Spain for support and socializing.”\n\nAdditionally, van Basten says (and I concur) that it’s critical to lean into Spanish culture and its unique pace of life. “Spain has a more relaxed lifestyle, including the siesta tradition, which might take some getting used to,” van Basten added.\n\nTraveling Around Spain\n\nOnce you’re in Spain, it’s easy to get out and explore. The nation’s high-speed trains and extensive bus network make it simple and affordable to go see the intricate palaces of Andalusia, the modernist landmarks of Catalonia, the beaches along the eastern coast, and more."
