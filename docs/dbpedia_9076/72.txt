The Maltese government recently gave Sovereign Military Order of Malta extra-territorial rights to once again carry out its sovereign functions in what, during much of the 16th century, was the Hospitaller Grand Master's palace in Valletta - Fort Angelo. The Order is now busy restoring it, and for the first time over 200 years the Hospitallers' Crusader period battle flag flutters over the ancient fortress.

After the loss of the island of Malta in 1798, the Order settled permanently in Rome, Italy, in 1834. Its two headquarters, granted with extraterritoriality, are the Palazzo Malta in Via dei Condotti 68 - where the Grand Master resides and Government Bodies meet - and the Villa Malta on the Aventine. The latter hosts the Grand Priory of Rome, the Embassy of the Order to the Holy See and the Embassy of the Order to the Italian Republic.
