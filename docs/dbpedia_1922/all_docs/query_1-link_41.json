        "text": "Honors Convocation recognizes pursuit of academic excellence\n\nThe end of each academic year is a celebratory time to reflect on the accomplishments students and faculty have collected through their efforts inside and outside the classroom. The Millikin University campus community annually connects to honor these achievements during the Honors Convocation and Distinguished Faculty Lecture.\n\nFor the first time in two years, students, faculty and guests were able to come together in person at Kirkland Fine Arts Center for the 2022 Honors Convocation program to recognize outstanding work from the 2021-22 academic year.\n\n“We’re very delighted to have everyone here to be part of one of the most significant programs at Millikin. The importance of recognizing the many academic, scholarly and professional achievements of our faculty, staff and students is central to our mission at Millikin University,” said Millikin President Dr. Jim Reynolds.\n\nOver 90 awards were presented to Millikin students and faculty. Many of the awards have been created to honor the people of Millikin's past as well as recognize the achievements of the present, and to look forward to even more accomplishments in the years ahead.\n\nAmong the prestigious awards is the Scovill Prize, the most coveted recognition of Honors Convocation. Scovill Prize winners are selected on the basis of high academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, service and scholarship. This year, eight students were named Scovill Prize recipients.\n\nDr. Nancy Curtin\n\nAdditionally, several Millikin faculty were honored for their service to the university, including Dr. Nancy Curtin, professor of communication and chair of the Communication Department, who received the Dr. Ralph A. Czerwinski and Dr. Deborah L. Slayton Teaching Excellence and Campus Leadership Award.\n\n“Each individual being recognized tonight has given much of themselves in the pursuit of academic and professional excellence,” President Reynolds said. “We take time tonight to offer not just our congratulations but our deep respect for their work. They have left an indelible mark on our university and our work here is more purposeful because of their commitment to our mission.”\n\nEach year, the Millikin faculty vote to select one of their own as the Distinguished Faculty Lecturer. This honored faculty member delivers the keynote address at Honors Convocation. This year's Distinguished Faculty Lecturer was Professor Mary Garrison, professor of social work.\n\nProfessor Mary Garrison\n\nAn educator, clinical supervisor and consultant, Mary Garrison has had extensive practice experience in the social work field, with 30 years of public and private practice in mental health services, policy and advocacy. Garrison is an advisor to the Millikin University student organization Human Service Connection and Big Blue Backpacks, and serves as a clinical supervisor, a consultant to multiple community entities, a Macon County Continuum of Care Governing Board Member and serves as the PIT Homeless Count Coordinator for Macon County. She is a past recipient of the NASW Illinois Social Worker of the Year Award, the Cesar Chavez Social Justice Award and the first ever recipient of the Macon County Continuum of Care Advocate of the Year Award. She is the co-author of the book: “Your Playbook for Beating Depression: Essential Strategies for Managing and Living with Depression.”\n\nAs she addressed the Kirkland Fine Arts Center audience, Garrison focused on the impact of connections. “Our accomplishments are intertwined because of the connections we make with others,” Garrison said. “Connections are vital to our existence. We need connections in order to survive. When we think about connections … is there a difference between an interaction and a connection? A connection begins with an interaction and moves to creating a relationship with someone.”\n\nGarrison concluded by saying, “I believe that we can change the world with connection. Our lives and world could be better if we would only connect. Take the time to stop, acknowledge, look someone in the eye and get to know them as a human being.”\n\nCongratulations to all the honorees from Millikin University’s 2022 Honors Convocation program.\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\n\nBehavioral Science Award: Madelynn Wood\n\nHenry F.
