        "text": "The 80th Anniversary of D-Day cruise features a custom itinerary emphasizing the land, sea, and air campaigns of World War II. Sail from Hamburg, which was systematically destroyed by an Allied bombing campaign in July 1943. Sail aboard the exquisite Seabourn Ovation towards Amsterdam and learn about the Dutch Resistance during the war. A two-day stop in East Anglia, England, provides a special emphasis to the airmen and their ground support who helped make D-Day possible. Next, a stop in Dunkirk to learn more about Operation Dynamo. Finally, land in Normandy for four days of touring the rural countryside and beaches that became the backdrop for the largest amphibious invasion in history. Special guest President and CEO Emeritus and Founder of The National WWII Museum,\n\nGordon H. “Nick” Mueller, PhD, along with featured tour historians Donald L. Miller, Alexandra Richie, John McManus, and Keith Lowe provide a signature lecture series during the voyage.\n\nOPTIONAL THREE-NIGHT PRE-CRUISE TOUR\n\nFeaturing Five-Star Accommodations on Land\n\nMay 26–29, 2024\n\nBomber warfare was a new concept in the years leading to World War II. Japan’s war against China in the 1930s employed bombs that specifically targeted civilians. In 1940, the German Luftwaffe razed large sections of Rotterdam through aerial bombardment. The escalation of tactics,material, and destruction continued from 1940–1945 with numerous cities turning to rubble.\n\nFor one week in July 1943, a combined operation by the Royal Air Force and the American Eighth Air Force systematically destroyed Hamburg. Several factors influenced Hamburg’s destruction. First, the city was a hub of manufacturing and shipbuilding. Its location near the coast meant that Allied bombers had little resistance from the ground. Also, Hamburg was one of five “Fuhrer Cities,” designated for massive construction projects that would demonstrate the power of the Third Reich.\n\nOn this two-day tour of Hamburg, visit St. Nikolai Church, preserved for more than 80 years in its state of wartime destruction. Several massive flak towers dot the city, evidence of the German efforts to combat the Allied Bombers. Ohlsdorf Cemetery, one of the largest in the world, contains a mass grave to the victims of the attack overlooked by a statue showing the crossing of the River Styx.\n\nAccommodations: Fairmont Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten (2 breakfasts, 1 lunch, 2 receptions, 1 dinner)\n\nOPTIONAL THREE-NIGHT POST-CRUISE TOUR\n\nFeaturing Five-Star Accommodations on Land\n\nJune 8–11, 2024\n\nDisembark in Dover and transfer to London for an examination of the Battle of Britain. During the summer of 1940, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dueled the Luftwaffe over the skies of the United Kingdom. As the British population sought refuge in bomb shelters, the RAF developed numerous tactics to keep the damage from German bombers to a minimum.\n\nJourney into the operations of Fighter Command with visits to the Battle of Britain Bunker in Uxbridge and Bentley Priory. The underground control room in Uxbridge served as the main information center for approaching aircraft. Information from radar and coastal observers would be tracked on the plotting table as an ingenious system of clocks and switchboards relayed the information to Fighter Command Headquarters at Bentley Priory.\n\nThe air war comes into context at the Imperial War Museum, where new exhibitions on World War II and the Holocaust opened in 2021. In the new displays, a V-1 flying bomb straddles the galleries to emphasize it as a product of slave labor and its role in terrorizing the British population during World War II. As the RAF learned to tip the missiles with the wings of a Spitfire, the Germans unleashed the V-2 rocket, a weapon that caused more death through its production than its use in combat.\n\nAccommodations: Rubens at the Palace (3 Breakfasts, 2 Lunches, 1 Reception)\n\nTravel aboard Seabourn Ovation and enjoy the all-inclusive experience of small-ship cruising with every amenity included, a relaxed social atmosphere, and plenty of space for private contemplation.\n\nIntroducing the world’s finest ultra-luxury cruise line\n\nAs the foremost experts in WWII historical travel, The National WWII Museum Educational Travel Program has the reputation for exemplary programming and world-class expertise while offering only the finest in accommodations.\n\nSeabourn Ovation has been exclusively chartered by The National WWII Museum for its valued guests.

His first book, Inferno, was a critically acclaimed study of the bombing of Hamburg in 1943. His second book, Savage Continent, became a Sunday Times top 10 best seller and went on to win both the Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History and Italy’s national Cherasco History Prize. It is now a standard work on the wave of violence and revenge that swept Europe after the war. The Fear and the Freedom is an intimate history of the long-term consequences of the Second World War and the shadow that it still casts over our lives today. It was shortlisted for the Historical Writers’ Association Non-fiction Crown, and has been adapted as a 12-part radio series in the Czech Republic. His latest book, Prisoners of History, examines our monuments to the war, and asks what they are really saying about our history and ourselves. Written at a time when statues around the world were being torn down by both governments and protesters, it is a timely look at some of the world’s most important symbols of our collective past. Lowe regularly speaks on TV and radio, and he often lectures on postwar history at venues across Europe and North America. He has written for a variety of newspapers and journals, including The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Wall Street Journal, El Paìs and the NeueZürcherZeitung. He lives in London with his wife and two children."
