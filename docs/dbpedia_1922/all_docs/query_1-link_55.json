You might not know that Grace began her career 30 years ago as the welcoming voice of the University operator before moving to Facilities and eventually her current position as a coordinator and she has built lifelong friendships along the way. As a coordinator, Grace handles many tasks and situations on a daily basis, including but not limited to, providing excellent customer service to prospective, incoming and current students, parents and colleagues, processing budget and documents. She is dedicated, dependable, kind and quietly determined. If you want to know a fact about Saint Joseph’s, ask Grace. If you want to know who to call, ask Grace. If you want to learn patience, watch Grace. You might not know that GRACE is also an acronym representing five attributes Grace possesses: Generosity, Respect, Action, Compassion, Energy. These attributes make Grace a woman for others. Putting others before herself is second nature to her, both professionally and personally. You can count on Grace to always get the job done and to constantly help others whether they be students, parents, colleagues, family, friends and even strangers.\n\nWhile many things have changed, Grace has been a constant and she loves Saint Joseph’s! We are all fortunate to know her and to work with her. Today, we congratulate her and we thank her for her daily contributions to Enrollment Operations, Office of Admission and to Saint Joseph’s University.\n\nMaryanne Benetatos, Administrative Assistant for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\n\nFor the past twenty years, Maryanne has been the first person a distressed student meets when they come to counseling and psychological services. Maryanne is warm, friendly and caring as she listens to a student, schedules them to meet with a psychologist and chats with them while they wait. Contact with Maryanne is therapeutic in itself! Many past students, practicum students, post-doctoral interns and staff remember her fondly and stay in touch. She is organized, has a strong work ethic and always puts the students first.\n\nMaryanne began her days on Hawk Hill in 1990 as the administrative assistant to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and two years later moved to become the administrative assistant in the Department of Psychology. Of those 11 years in the Science Center, Maryanne says “I met so many wonderful staff and students that it was unforgettable. I was working with the first group of students to enter into the psychology graduate program. I can still remember most of those students by name.”\n\nMaryanne had ties to Saint Joseph’s long before she came to work here. She met her husband Jerry (class of 1969) at a Saint Patrick’s Day mixer in the Fieldhouse in 1967. It was when her son Chris was accepted as a freshman in 1990 that she decided to apply for a job listed in the Delaware Valley Times.

Bill also volunteered his time in 2011 to assist with fire department efforts in New York after 9/11. Bill loves softball. He also played on the facilities football team for the University.

Her second time in that role coincided with the successful completion of the “With Faith and Strength to Dare: The Campaign for Saint Joseph’s University.” One of Katie’s greatest legacies has been the growth of the athletic giving program. For many years, she oversaw this area and worked with coaches and other administrators to increase awareness, engagement and support for our Division 1 athletic teams.\n\nNever satisfied with the status quo, one of Katie’s greatest contributions is to always challenge herself and others to ask how we can do better and be better.

Dr. Weidner is a fierce champion of shared governance on campus and he has been a key ally for our adjunct colleagues and contingent workers throughout his time at the University. With his broad and deep contributions to important committees at the department, school, and university levels, he has improved our university for students and colleagues alike.\n\nKelly Welsh, Executive Director of Communications\n\nKelly Welsh is a selfless mother and partner, a caring friend, a supportive colleague and a dedicated professional who has gifted the University with her expertise for two decades. Kelly has cultivated such a strong community in both work and in life because she always gives her very best to those around her. She is a talented communicator with the organizational skills to steward some of the University’s most strategic projects. Over the years, nearly every major project has seen her influence and been better for it. Her peers have felt her kindness and warmth and become better for it. That is her way — an improver of anything she comes into contact with. Beyond her many professional accomplishments, Kelly is a spirited joke teller, a willing reviewer of regional lunch cuisine and a noted fan of breakfast meetings. Many within the Office of Marketing and Communications believe her to be a secret employee of Pica’s Restaurant in Upper Darby, PA. We are all blessed to get to work with Kelly every day and wish her nothing but continued success in the future.\n\nTheresa Zmurkewycz, Modern and Classical Languages Spanish Language Coordinator\n\nAs Spanish language coordinator, Theresa has been an invaluable colleague in the Spanish program. She has served the program in multiple capacities, teaching everything from first semester Spanish through courses for the majors and minors, as well as the study tour to Spain. She advocates for students and cares deeply about them as individuals. She looks at individual cases carefully when placing students and often stops to think about the students’ point of view on given issues. She truly delights in seeing students succeed and makes every effort to treat colleagues and students fairly."
