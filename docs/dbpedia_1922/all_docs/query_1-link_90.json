        "text": "About the Book\n\nThe award-winning author of Washington's Immortals offers a searing narrative that takes readers into the heart of combat in the Great War\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is sacred ground at Arlington National Cemetery. Originally constructed in 1921 to hold one of the thousands of unidentified American soldiers lost in World War I, it now also contains unknowns from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and receives millions of visitors each year who pay silent tribute. When the first Unknown Soldier was laid to rest in Arlington, General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force in WWI, seleted eight of America's most decorated, battle-hardened veterans to serve as Body Bearers. For the first time O'Donnell portrays their heroics on the battlefield one hundred years ago, thereby animating the Tomb by giving voice to all who have served. The Body Bearers appropriately spanned America's service branches and specialties. Their ranks include a cowboy who relived the charge of the light brigade, an American Indian who heroically breached mountains of German barbed wire, a salty New Englander who dueled a U-boat for hours in a fierce gunfight, a tough New Yorker who sacrificed his body to save his ship, and an indomitable gunner who, though blinded by gas, nonetheless overcame five machine-gun nests. Their stories slip easily into the larger narrative of America's involvement in the conflict, transporting readers into the midst of dramatic battles during 1917-1918 that ultimately decided the Great War. Celebrated military historian and bestselling author Patrick O'Donnell illuminates the saga behind the creation of the Tomb itself and recreates the moving ceremony during which it was consecrated and the eight Body Bearers, and the sergeant who had chosen the one body to be interred, solemnly united. Brilliantly researched, vividly told, The Unknowns is a timeless tale of heeding the calls of duty and brotherhood, and humanizes the most consequential event of the twentieth century, which still casts a shadow a century later.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nPraise for The Unknowns:\n\nRecipient of the Military Order of St. Louis\n\n\"With exhaustive research and fluid prose, Mr. O'Donnell relates both the history of the Unknown Soldier and the story of America's part in World War I through these soldiers' experiences. The rich color of their singular narratives--and the broad history they reveal--affirm the wisdom, nearly a century later, of Pershing's selection . . . By revealing the stories of those whose names and deeds we do know, The Unknowns prods our consciences to heap fresh honor upon the Unknown Soldier of World War I, renewing his station as the mortal embodiment of every American who has fallen on a battlefield far from home.\"--Matthew J. Davenport, Wall Street Journal\n\n\"A gripping read about a war that many Americans know little about . . . Few authors have the same kind of enthusiasm and gusto that O'Donnell brings to his topic. His gift is taking the reader from the map room to the battlefield. It's an exciting, often harrowing, trip worth taking.\"--Ray Locker, USA Today\n\n\"A gripping story told by Mr. O'Donnell, who is emerging as one of the best military historians of his generation . . . These pages capture the horrifying nature of warfare, and Mr. O'Donnell's descriptions catch the raw bravery that can emerge from men thrust into combat.\"--Joseph C. Goulden, Washington Times\n\n\"Gripping . . . O'Donnell, whose previous books include the terrific Washington's Immortals and We Were One, is a masterful storyteller. In his capable hands, the stories of each of the body bearers come alive despite the passing of nearly a century.\"--James Scott, Post and Courier\n\n\"True to form, military and combat historian Patrick K. O'Donnell, in The Unknowns, has unearthed the stirring story of World War I's Unknown Soldier. Rather than present a simple tale of the chosen body's selection, process, though, O'Donnell peels back multiple layers of WWI, shining the light on a larger cast of characters who participated in the return of the unidentified remains to American soil . . . The mastery of O'Donnell's writing is that he can bring together myriad themes and make them work together . . . [Adds] immeasurably to the growing literature of the American role in World War I. It is a simultaneously riveting and soulful work that should not be missed.\"--James A. Percoco, Washington Independent Review of Books\n\n\"While one could never begin to include all the stories of heroism, duty, and self-sacrifice that transpired during the 'war to end all wars, ' O'Donnell has managed to capture some of the most poignant and meaningful . . . As he probes deeply into the horrors of war, O'Donnell displays a unique talent for weaving in many other names of persons who are well-known and will play significant roles in military affairs . . . A superb work on the topic that surrounds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\"--Leatherneck Magazine\n\n\"Acclaimed military historian O'Donnell brings to life America's involvement in the Great War through the stories of eight body bearers for an unidentified fallen soldier . . . O'Donnell does his subject justice, beginning with the book's inspiration, his giving Marines a tour of the battlefields in France . . . A thrilling title for readers interested in WWI, and an excellent primer for understanding the full significance of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\"--Booklist\n\n\"The Unknowns is a great book on the topic that surrounds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from the First World War. It's also a good single volume work on the American Expeditionary Force's involvement and experiences in the First World War . . . Engaging, informative, detailed, exciting, respectful, and at a patriotic level, unifying.\"--David Retherford, Strategy Bridge\n\n\"Many of the topics on which [O'Donnell] writes involve the story behind the story . . . With the centennial of America's participation in World War I ongoing, this is a highly relevant publication . . . Conveys the reverence and honor which is deserved from the citizens of this nation to all of those who go in harm's way to protect us and guarantee our rights and freedoms.\"--New York Journal of Books\n\n\"The Unknowns is a dramatic and compassionately written book by one of our finest military historians who has few equals as a great storyteller. Patrick K. O'Donnell's superb tale of World War I and the exceptional valor of the eight men later chosen to escort the Unknown Soldier from France to America's most hallowed place of honor in Arlington National Cemetery is not only a tribute to those who fought and sacrificed so much but also a vivid and timely reminder of the terrible cost of war.\"--Carlo D'Este, author of Patton, A Genius for War and Eisenhower, A Soldier's Life\n\n\"This unknown story of extraordinary sacrifice and heroism is a powerful and timely tribute to the Americans who fought a century ago in the First World War. Superb history brilliantly told.\"--Alex Kershaw, author of The Longest Winter\n\n\"The Unknowns is not only the story of the Unknown Soldier but that of the unknown comrades who carried him there. Their stories of courage in deadly combat are finally made known to the rest of us in searing detail.\"--Glenn F. Williams, PhD, U.S. Army Center of Military History\n\n\"Brilliant in conception and style, The Unknowns presents the awe-inspiring and profoundly moving story of The Great War from the viewpoint of the men who fought, sacrificed and bled to win it. A 'must read, ' an incredible story related by a master storyteller!\"--James Lacey, author of Pershing and the forthcoming The Washington War, director of USMC University\n\n\"Very few historians can bring our military past to life like Patrick O'Donnell. The Unknowns shines new and welcome light on the 'forgotten generation' of Americans who fought World War One. Throughout these well written, absorbing, moving pages, we come to know the doughboys and sailors of the Great War like never before. Read this book and you will never think of the Unknown Soldier the same way again.\"--John C. McManus, Ph.D., author of The Dead and Those About to Die and Deadly Sky\n\n\"Highly readable and extremely interesting, The Unknowns is more than just an account about the American servicemen who escorted the Unknown Soldier, it also encompasses the story of American involvement and the sacrifice of young Americans in the Great War. It is a masterful tour de force of that by-gone era.\"--Col. Richard Camp, author of The Devil Dogs at Belleau Wood: U.S. Marines in World War I\n\n\"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, it's as hallowed as ground can get. But what's the story of the hero inside? A breakthrough book with a crackling narrative, The Unknowns reveals how the first unknown soldier came home from World War I, a journey born in the shell holes and on the high seas of one of humanity's ghastliest wars.

In continuing tribute to them, Maryland still proclaims its nickname as 'The Old Line State.' In Washington's Immortals, noted military historian Patrick O'Donnell has written a gripping account of the men and units that made up the Maryland Line during our War for Independence who first earned that glorious nickname, and which the soldiers of the Maryland Army National Guard's 175th Infantry continued to do so at places with names like Gettysburg, Normandy, and Iraq.\"--Glenn F. Williams, author of Dunmore's War: The Last Conflict of America's Colonial Era \"Perhaps no war in American history has been more difficult to see through soldiers' eyes than the Revolutionary War. Patrick O'Donnell brings their experiences to life for twenty-first century readers in a way that no other historian has managed to do, accomplishing for the Revolutionary War what Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers did for World War II. The 1st Maryland Regiment participated in some of the most important battles of the war, gradually progressing from ordinary to elite status. Its story is the story of how the people of the United States became free.\"--Edward G.
