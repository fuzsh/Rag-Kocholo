        "text": "Every June, we remember the Normandy landings and the beginning of Operation Overlord. We see images of landing crafts churning towards the beach, with nervous soldiers bobbing up and down inside, looking ahead at German guns zeroed in on them.\n\nThis last June, I wanted to really remember that \"Day of Days,\" so I read two books, the first, the iconic Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose and the second, The Dead and Those About to Die, by John C. McManus. The former focusing on the paratroopers of Easy Company of the 82nd Airborne Division and the latter on the 1st Infantry Division and their landing at Omaha Beach. Both units were comprised of the best soldiers in history and some of the best (and worst) leaders in history.\n\nIn reading these books back to back, an interesting and similar course of events between Easy Company and the 1st ID stood out to me, namely a change in leadership on the eve of battle.\n\nEasy Company began its training at Camp Toccoa with Herbert Sobel, so well portrayed by actor David Schwimmer in the HBO miniseries. Ambrose explained how Sobel's leadership style was harsh, unsophisticated, and caused great mistrust and hatred among the men he led. Sobel was relentless in his demands for physical fitness which led Easy Company to easily be the fittest in the Battalion but his men didn't trust him to lead them in battle as he was clumsy, got lost, and didn't perform well under pressure. Eventually, the men of Easy Company would end up with Dick Winters (Damian Lewis in the series) as their leader during D-Day. Winters was a leader one could only hope to be.\n\nWhen you read about Easy Company's switch from Sobel to Winters, their success seemed inevitable. They had a bad leader the men hated, but they got a good leader they loved. Of course they did well and of course, they were successful.\n\nThis is where the contrast comes in. In his book, McManus spent considerable time describing how \"The Big Red One\" went from a leader they loved, General Terry Allen, to a leader they didn't know, General Clarence Huebner. General Allen had been with the men of the 1st ID through North Africa and Sicily and had led them successfully through bloody combat. He loved his men, put them first, visited them at the front, and while he expected them to work hard, he also let them play hard... a little too hard. Word got to General Omar Bradley, General Allen's superior, regarding the 1st ID's exploits in Tunisia while off the line and General Bradley decided to replace Allen with Huebner. This was definitely a blow to the men of the 1st ID, especially since they were in the midst of training for D-Day.\n\nBut General Huebner came in and with a different leadership style and a mountain to climb in terms of getting the men to trust him, set about emphasizing drilling, saluting, etc. Army 101 stuff. The men hated it and felt disrespected as they were combat veterans. But unlike the men of Easy Company who never came to love Sobel, the 1st ID came to respect General Huebner and maintained their success as a combat unit. It's doubtful Omaha Beach could have been taken if another unit other than The Big Red One had landed there.\n\nWhile I'm no expert on any of these men or on the battles they fought in, I found the results after a change in leadership fascinating. One change the men wanted and the other they didn't, but both ended in victory. The men of Easy Company, while disdaining Sobel, did credit him with making them extremely fit and ready for the physical rigors of combat. And while the men of the 1st ID thought they were doomed when they were told of the switch in leadership, they ultimately went on to win.\n\nThese stories show me that there isn't a perfect leader, there isn't a perfect style, and there isn't a secret formula to produce success. And of course there are many layers of leadership in a Division and a Company, but the point still stands, that if you're placed in charge of a group of people who are yearning for something new or if you're stepping into the shoes of a beloved leader and those you lead are secretly wishing for your demise, there is a route to success. The point is, we are all in leadership positions, either now or will be. And while we may be well liked or not, for good reason or not, we have a job to do and it's a leader's responsibility to accomplish the mission at hand.\n\nGeneral Huebner was himself, and he didn't try to be General Allen to his men, and his men respected him for it and jumped on board with what he was trying to accomplish. Lieutenant Winters knew he was stepping into a role where he would have to send men to their deaths and he saw this as the immense responsibility it was and he took it seriously and made history. These are lessons for us all - be yourself, don't shirk responsibility, and put the needs of those you lead ahead of your own.\n\nAnd finally, as we all lead, we all follow. I'd say we've probably all had way more experiences of being given a new leader instead of being given a new leadership role. So what do you do if you're given a bad leader? This is tough, to be sure. But I recently read the incredible book Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin who are both retired Navy SEAL officers, who talk about this very topic in their book. Their answer to this situation is, as you might guess, take extreme ownership. Don't be passive, lead your leader. If they're uninformed, inform them. If they don't understand your role, teach them. Take ownership and change the dynamic, it's up to you. This advice is so profound and has helped me in so many ways.\n\nWhat about you? I'm curious to hear if you've ever had a change in leadership, for good or bad, and had surprising results. Ever go from a good boss to a bad boss but been more successful? I think this is an interesting dynamic and adds some layers of complexity to the topic of leadership.\n\nOMAHA BEACH TODAY"
