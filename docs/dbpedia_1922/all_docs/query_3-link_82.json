        "text": "‚ÄúYOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO BURN BOOKS TO DESTROY A CULTURE. JUST GET PEOPLE TO STOP READING THEM.‚Äù - RAY BRADBURY\n\nOver the past several years, I have developed a love and passion for learning. This love was sparked when I was doing research for my first body of work and realized that increasing my knowledge would directly impact my artistic practice. Here you will find a collection of books that have influenced my life and art over the years and I hope and believe will affect you. The books fall around the non-fiction genre, ranging from creativity, spirituality, business, biographies, and philosophy, hoping to learn, improve, and gain a new perspective. I‚Äôve tried to make it a point to read books and information that doesn‚Äôt just align with the things I already hold to be true. Scott Fitzgerald is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.‚Äù. Not saying my intelligence is first-rate, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve made an effort to do for some time, and the books will reflect that. Individuals today are seemingly unwilling to invest the time, money, and attention into any sort of long-form content, and the things they often consume cement previously held beliefs. As a society, we have gotten so polarized and divisive, and I believe reading can genuinely aid in broadening the minds of many. I also want to mention that when I say ‚Äúreading‚Äù, I am really referring to listening as I consume most books in audio form while driving, painting, or any other various activity. So this list is a little limited in that regard.\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST\n\nTAKE ALL THAT YOU CAN OF THIS BOOK UPON REASON, AND THE BALANCE ON FAITH, AND YOU WILL LIVE AND DIE A HAPPIER MAN. - ABE LINCOLN\n\nRead the Bible! Seemingly a crazy statement here in the twenty first century! But I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs good. No text has influenced me, our country, and the world more than the Bible from a purely objective place. The Bible outsells any other book (it‚Äôs not close) and is even said to be stolen more than any other. And because of its widespread reach, most have had some interaction with the bible, for better or worse. Whether that be a church service someone dragged you to or an out-of-context verse is thrown at you attempting to prove a point; seemingly everyone has an opinion of this writing. Check that at the door. If you have never picked it up or experienced it, I encourage you to do so for yourself. This book can carry so much connotation and baggage because of the way it‚Äôs been handled by individuals, which is unfortunate because I do not doubt that if you humbly and honestly read scripture and you allow it to, It‚Äôll challenge, console, confront and comfort you throughout this life and beyond.\n\nThis was quite possibly the worst way to kick this list off. Potentially turning off so many to anything else I recommend, but I hope you stick around. You may be closed off to the idea, and that‚Äôs fine. No hard feelings. If not, let‚Äôs get into it!\n\nCREATIVITY üé®\n\nWe will start with this section. Not because I feel it‚Äôs most important but because it's why you‚Äôre here, and I have a modicum of influence. Often, we think creativity is innate, and although I don't believe all people can be equally creative, that belief is quickly dispelled shortly after starting any of these books. Creativity is more of a posture and a way of seeing the world. Creativity is making connections that others may overlook. But you aren't here to read my thoughts. Let's get into the books.\n\nWAR OF ART - STEPHEN PRESSFIELD\n\nStart Here - This should be a staple on every artist's bookshelf. A quote states that if you read what everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. But, some texts are classics because of their relevance to all. This is one of those books. It speaks about the resistance that we all face. About ‚Äòturning pro‚Äô and showing up to work every day despite any distractions.\n\nWIRED TO CREATE - SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN & CAROLYN GREGOIRE\n\nAn analytical study about the things that separate genuinely creative people. Using various paragons of creativity like Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Thomas Edison, John Lennon, and Michael Jackson as examples, each chapter explores one of the ten attributes and habits of highly creative people.\n\nCREATIVE QUEST - QUESTLOVE\n\nWritten by the legend himself. Questlove, the drummer for The Roots, has been around some of the most creative individuals in the world. He gathered thoughts, stories, and observations from those encounters and compiled them for our betterment and enjoyment.\n\nART & FEAR - DAVID BAYLES & TED ORLAND\n\nMaking art is difficult. This book is an attack on the fear that stands to stop our daily creation, from tips on how to ‚ÄòNot Quit‚Äô to Fears about yourself as an artist.\n\nHOW TO BE AN ARTIST - JERRY SALTZ\n\nIt goes through six chapters and sixty-three rules the author has gathered over years of writing about and existing in the art world. He gives artists new ways to break through creative blocks, get the most from materials, navigate career challenges, and find joy in the work.\n\nTHE ARTISAN SOUL - ERWIN RAPHAEL MCMANUS\n\nAn attempt to get the reader to realize that each soul is made with the essence of an artist. McManus takes you along a journey to craft your life with wonder and beauty. Demonstrating that we are closest to and most like God when living a creative, innovative life.\n\nART/WORK - HEATHER DARCY BHANDARI AND JONATHAN MELBER\n\nThis one is tailored to visual artists. It‚Äôs as practical as it gets, as it breaks down various things like shipping paintings, contacting galleries, taxes, how much to charge for your work, and much more in great detail! How do you diversify income streams to sustain a healthy art practice? How can you find an alternative to the gallery system? How do you review a license agreement? What are digital marketing best practices? Also included are new quotes from over thirty arts professionals, updated commission legal templates, organizational tips, tax information, and advice for artists who don‚Äôt make objects. An essential resource for gallerists, dealers, art consultants, artist-oriented organizations, and artists alike, Art/Work is the resource that all creative entrepreneurs in the art world turn to for advice.\n\nCALLED TO CREATE - JORDAN RAYNOR\n\nThis book views creativity not as a job, an outlook, or a lifestyle. But as a calling, it shows you why you should feel the weight of creation. And that weight is paradoxically freeing.\n\nCREATIVE HABIT - TWYLA THARP\n\nCreativity and Habits are not generally associated with one another. But this left and right brain connection makes this pairing so effective. Tharp details how and why we must approach our craft like soldiers or athletes and how this will lead to creating some notable works of art.\n\nBIOGRAPHIES\n\nIt‚Äôs said that wise men learn from the mistakes of others. With this in mind, biographies look into the lives, routines, thoughts, decisions, and experiences of some of the most incredible humans to have lived. Here, you will find my favorite biographies. Some read more like memoirs, some are autobiographical, but all have been enlightening in several ways. Hopefully, they will be to you as well.\n\nSWEAT THE TECHNIQUE - RAKIM\n\nThe great Rakim takes us through his journey to greatness, his creative process, his spiritual journey, and the motivation behind some of his decisions. He goes into great depth about rhyming, to the point that a lot of it went over my head. But if you are a writer or write in any capacity, Sweat the Technique will give you an appreciation for the craft, and it reveals the heart and mind of the master lyricist and his love for great storytelling.\n\nLEONARDO DA VINCI - WALTER ISAACSON\n\nWritten by the legendary Walter Isaacson. He gives the reader an in-depth idea of the genius that is DaVinci. Going into his origin story, early years, and formal education. Then, it provides us with a picture of the breadth of knowledge that DaVinci acquired throughout his lifetime through his ceaseless curiosity. Leonardo may be best known for painting the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but his interests ranged from anatomy and architecture to fluid mechanics, geometry, and music. In addition to his paintings, more than 7,000 pages of his notebooks survive ‚Äì filled with a remarkable assortment of drawings, sketches, notes, doodles, and calculations, it‚Äôs an inspiring read.\n\nTHE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN - BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nOne of this country's most remarkable men recounts his life and decisions in what was the foundation of the United States as a self-made man who was successful at almost everything he did. He gives an excellent account of his journey. The book is broken up into parts, each fascinating in Its own way, detailing the making of the man, his values and thoughts on religion, and his public life.\n\nNARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS - FREDERICK DOUGLASS\n\nRecommended by the Great Dave Chappelle, I read this book as often as possible. It‚Äôs a chilling reminder of where things were in this country centuries ago. The fight that many had to go through for us and a reminder to never take opportunities for granted. He writes about specific instances of escaping his slave owners, choosing a birthday, and taking on the name ‚ÄòDouglass.‚Äô Frederick Douglass is one of the most influential men in American history, with a story everyone needs to read.\n\nI KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS - MAYA ANGELOU\n\nIt feels redundant to say these individuals have amazing stories because we wouldn‚Äôt be reading about their lives if that wasn't the case. In light of that, Maya Angelou‚Äôs story is remarkable. At eight years old, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend and told her uncles of the assault. They kicked her attacker to death. When she realized that speaking about and revealing her rapist had prompted his death, she learned the power of words and speaking, so she stopped speaking for five years! And that was just the beginning.\n\nUP FROM SLAVERY - BOOKER T. WASHINGTON\n\nA man born into slavery during the Civil War yet rose to become one of the most influential men and blacks of the 19th century. He talks about the obstacles he had to overcome to get an education, the establishment of the Tuskegee Institute, and equipping marginalized individuals with education and learning trades. He was a controversial figure during his time because he focused more on the betterment of blacks and the acceptance of whites through labor and industriousness.\n\nOPEN - ANDRE AGASSI\n\nAndre Agassi, the tennis legend, goes in-depth about his tumultuous relationship with the sport. It bled into every other area of his life and how he came out on the other side of his career. He talks about his entire history, from coming up as a young prodigy to his on-court rivalry with Pete Sampras. It is a glimpse into the level of commitment it takes to reach the pinnacle of anything and how taxing life in the public eye can become.\n\nGREENLIGHTS - MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY\n\nMcConaughey‚Äôs personality shines through in this memoir, giving us a new term to notice as we move. Greenlights shows us how he looks at the world and how we can adopt this outlook to better our lives.\n\nLUCKIEST MAN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LOU GEHRIG - JONATHAN EIG\n\nThis one was special for several crazy reasons. I was convinced that I had ALS for a couple of years. After years of working on my mind and the tendency to be a hypochondriac, I was able to rid of this from my mind. But it was humbling to read about Lou Gehrig‚Äôs journey and how he handled the disease with so much grace and courage. I am not the biggest baseball fan, but Gehrig was a part of one of the most iconic teams in history, and it talks a bit about that team dynamic.\n\nCAN'T HURT ME: MASTER YOUR MIND AND DEFY THE ODDS: DAVID GOGGINS\n\nStay Hard.\n\nTEAM OF RIVALS: THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\nThis book was instrumental at the beginning of my career and sparked an entire body of work. Lincoln, in my opinion, is one of the most remarkable men to live and made it a point to seek out and be around individuals who did not hold views similar to his. In doing this, he could get a well-rounded view of issues and become a well-rounded man. This book talks about the formation of his cabinet and Lincoln's unlikely rise to the presidency.\n\nEINSTEIN: HIS LIFE AND UNIVERSE - WALTER ISAACSON\n\nAnother classic from Walter Isaacson. If you‚Äôre interested at all in the life and work of Albert Einstein, this book is a no-brainer.\n\nSPIRITUALITY\n\nWho are we, and why are we here? This could be the most important topic that we as humans must answer. Every decision we make in our lives will flow from it, so it's essential to do your due diligence in this area. A few times, I was close to renouncing my faith and belief in God for one reason or another. And in these moments, the writings of two men, Richard Rohr and C.S. Lewis, kept me in the fight. It has been my experience that people don‚Äôt often have problems with the content of a religious text but with how people deliver it. On the other side of the coin, some people have the insight to put things in a way that makes sense and makes it harder not to believe. Rohr and Lewis have been that for me.\n\nThis section will also include books that counteract some things I hold true. They are in my opinion fair responses and critiques and if you have others send them my way!\n\nEVERYTHING BELONGS - RICHARD ROHR\n\nDuring the time that I read it, this book was as influential as any in my life. It speaks about the rational mind and how it cannot be used to achieve intimacy with God. Here's a short passage: We must go inside the belly of the whale for a while. Then and only then will we spit up upon a new shore and understand our call.\n\nTHINGS HIDDEN - RICHARD ROHR\n\nYou can have information without transformation. This book is about the latter and how we can use scripture to breathe new life into our relationship with God. He speaks about wisdom, morality, and power and paints a picture of God full of grace and abundance.\n\nFALLING UPWARD - RICHARD ROHR\n\nThe great Thomas Merton spoke about what he called the true self and the false self. Taking that idea a step further in this book, Rohr shows us that the journey that we hopefully all will go on to become our true self is one that mostly happens despite us. It is a failing up towards a higher calling and towards Christ.\n\nLEARNING TO FALL - PHILIP SIMMONS\n\n‚ÄúAnd so let us pray that if we are falling from grace, dear God let us also fall with grace to grace. If we are falling toward pain and weakness, let us also fall towards sweetness and strength. If we are falling toward death, let us also fall toward life.‚Äù\n\nFAITH VERSUS FACT: WHY SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE INCOMPATIBLE - JERRY A. COYNE\n\nEvolutionary biologist Jerry A. Coyne lays out why science is reliable based on reason and empirical study. At the same time, religion, including faith, dogma, and revelation, leads to incorrect, untestable, or conflicting conclusions. He warns that religious prejudices in politics, education, medicine, and social policy are on the rise and attempts to demolish the claims of religion to provide verifiable ‚Äútruth‚Äù by subjecting those claims to the same tests we use to establish truth in science.\n\nRETURN OF THE GOD HYPOTHESIS - STEPHEN C. MAYER\n\nBeginning in the late 19th century, many intellectuals began to insist that scientific knowledge conflicts with traditional theistic belief‚Äîthat science and belief in God are ‚Äúat war.‚Äù Philosopher of science Stephen Meyer challenges this view by examining three scientific discoveries with theistic implications. Building on the case for the intelligent design of life that he developed in other books, Meyer demonstrates how discoveries in cosmology and physics coupled with those in biology help to establish the identity of the designing intelligence behind life and the universe.\n\nTHE RIGHTEOUS MIND: WHY GOOD PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED BY POLITICS AND RELIGION\n\nHaidt argues that human nature is not innate but has been molded over time by natural selection, a book about the origin of morality and our decisions as people. This book gives concrete steps on how to talk to those who may disagree with you about very polarizing topics and breaks down the motivations of the political groups in our country and why we need each other.\n\nTHE COMMON RULE -\n\nThe modern world is a machine of invisible habits, causing us to be anxious, busy, and depressed people. We yearn for freedom but remain addicted to our technology and exhausted by our schedules. But because our habits are the water we swim in, they are almost invisible to us. This book responds to that, giving us practical rules to live by, offering four daily and four weekly habits designed to help us create new routines and transform frazzled days into lives of love for God and neighbor.\n\nCALENDAR OF WISDOM - LEO TOLSTOY\n\nIt subtitled ‚Äúdaily thoughts to nourish the soul,‚Äù and I can't say it better than that.\n\nTHE GREAT DIVORCE - CS LEWIS\n\nAn allegorical tale following the main character as he takes a bus ride from Hell to Heaven. He proposes this crazy idea that the gates of hell are locked from the inside, and no one is there who doesn't want to be.\n\nSCREWTAPE LETTERS - CS LEWIS\n\nScrewtape is a high-ranking demon, and this book is a collection of letters he has written to his young protege Wormwood. A Demon in training who is learning all of the most effective ways to keep humans from living whole, fulfilled lives.\n\nDARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL - ST. JOHN OF THE CROSS\n\nYou might be noticed a theme here.. In this book, St. John addresses several subjects, among them pride, avarice, envy, and other human imperfections. His discussion of the \"dark night of the spirit,\" which considers afflictions and pain suffered by the soul, is followed by an extended explanation of divine love and the soul's exultant union with God.\n\nTHE POCKET THOMAS MERTON\n\nA tiny book that you can keep with you at all times. Yet, it features life-changing quotes from one of the greatest American monks there ever was.\n\nTHE FREEDOM OF SELF FORGETFULNESS - TIMOTHY KELLER\n\nPound for pound, this book might be number 1 for me. It's very short but is potent in its teaching about true humility and the only way that we can achieve it.\n\nWARRIOR OF THE LIGHT - PAULO COELHO\n\nFrom the man who brought you the Alchemist. Another banger\n\nRANDOM HEAT üî•\n\nPretty much sums it up.\n\nGRIT: THE POWER OF PASSION AND PERSEVERANCE - ANGELA DUCKWORTH\n\nEffort counts twice! A great book about the most important factor that all of us need in order to be successful and how to acquire it.\n\n12 RULES FOR LIFE: AN ANTIDOTE TO CHAOS HARDCOVER - JORDAN PETERSON\n\nJordan Peterson, a very polarizing and logistical, clinical psychologists gives us twelve rules that can help us live purposefully, impactfully, and orderly. A few of the rules include Befriend people who want the best for you, and Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping!\n\nNEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE - CHRIS VOSS\n\nThe topic of negotiation is one that i still have trouble with to this day. As my business acumen is always in need of improvement this book was much needed and is invaluable for anyone going into business for themselves. Especially coming from a creative field! It gives a few concrete rules to follow when negotiating to help you with that aspect of your business and life.\n\nQUIET: THE POWER OF INTROVERTS IN A WORLD THAT CAN'T STOP TALKING - SUSAN CAIN\n\nThis one hits close to home. In so many ways, extroverts are celebrated in culture. While us introverts are left to wither away in obscurity. But as an artist, introversion is a super power and this book gives us other ways to view introversion as an asset and not something to fight against.\n\nTHE FOUR AGREEMENTS - DON MIGUEL RUIZ\n\nFour simple rules to live by.\n\nEGO IS THE ENEMY - RYAN HOLIDAY\n\nThis book is aptly named and features case studies of individuals throughout history that placed others first and how it greatly benefited everyone around them. Ryan Holiday is a student of stoicism, and this book is the first in a series based on the foundations of Marcus Arelius and stoic philosophy.\n\nOUTLIERS - MALCOLM GLADWELL\n\nBy now, we have all heard of the 10,000-hour rule that we must all achieve to become masters of our craft. Using research from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Gladwell lays the foundation for studying achievement and talent and drops gems on the way to be great.\n\nATOMIC HABITS - JAMES CLEAR\n\nThe majority of everything we do is a habit. This book shows us that if we change those habits and the many small decisions we make daily, we can effect considerable changes in our lives.\n\nTHE ENNEAGRAM: A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE - RICHARD ROHR\n\nThe enneagram channels my inner hipster because I was learning the enneagram ‚Äúbefore it was cool,‚Äù and I have to tame my protective nature since it has become mainstream. Unfortunately, the enneagram can easily become a rationalization for people's poor decisions and or lack of growth. Still, I hope you don't let a group of people who misuse the enneagram ruin its power and potential effectiveness. In consuming Richard Rohr's content, he spoke a lot about the enneagram, and I can safely say that no other text or system has given me so much clarity about myself. Allowing me to then look into the proverbial mirror, understand my motivations, and seek to improve them. I'm a four, by the way, in case you were wondering.\n\nDAVID AND GOLIATH: UNDERDOGS, MISFITS, AND THE ART OF BATTLING GIANTS - MALCOLM GLADWELL\n\nAnother banger by Malcolm Gladwell. Frankly, anytime you see anything by Gladwell. Read it. Safe to say you won‚Äôt be disappointed.\n\nDOPAMINE NATION: FINDING BALANCE IN THE AGE OF INDULGENCE - DR. ANNA LEMBKE\n\nIn a world becoming more and more tailored towards continual tiny hits of dopamine, we must understand the game we are a part of. Drugs are more potent, Social media is more addictive, and affirmation can be given and received from anywhere. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation. As such, we‚Äôve all become vulnerable to compulsive overconsumption, and this book exposes the system to keep dopamine in check.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for checking it out. If you read any of these books, let me know what you think of them or if they've affected your life. Also, I would love any recommendations you might have, so please drop them in the box below, and let‚Äôs keep growing üôèüèæ\n\nGRACE AND PEACE.\n\nNB"
