        "text": "The 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Hitler’s Europe by Allied forces is being marked this year by, among other things, the publication of a new book, “The Dead and Those About to Die,” by historian and West County resident Dr. John C. McManus.\n\nA full professor of U.S. military history at Missouri University of Science and Technology, McManus focuses his latest work on the role played by members of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division, often referred to as the Big Red One, in their bloody struggle to penetrate German defenses on the eastern part of Omaha beach.\n\nDescribing the battle there as one of the most famous in American history, ranking alongside Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, the Bulge and Iwo Jima, McManus melds historical background and facts about the battle with the personal accounts of both officers and enlisted men who were part of the invasion force.\n\nThe book’s title is taken from observations written by Col. George Taylor, who had helped plan earlier Allied landings in North Africa and had led the 16th Infantry into Sicily.\n\n“In a landing operation, there are two classes of men that may be found on the beach,” he wrote months before the D-Day invasion, “those who are already dead and those who are about to die.”\n\nAs described by McManus, Taylor’s fervent belief was that in any invasion, remaining on the beach was a virtual death sentence. At the same time, troops often succumbed to inertia when surrounded by death and destruction and needed effective leadership for the kind of forward movement that would increase their odds of survival.\n\nWhile the D-Day invasion ultimately was successful, McManus describes the battle’s early hours as being filled with developments that made the outcome substantially less than a sure thing.\n\nHeavy seas and difficult weather conditions combined to break down the intricate timetable and plans setting forth who and what were to land at what location and at what precise time.\n\n“The timetable was wrecked, shattered like a prized picture window,” McManus writes, “but the consequence was not mere shards of glass but the destruction of many lives…”\n\nFor the fighting men in the first wave, “tardy landings meant isolation from supporting units and firepower,” the historian says, with the result that the German defenders could more easily concentrate their firepower on small groups rather than dealing with larger, more numerous units.\n\nAnother major problem was that soldiers coming ashore were burdened by the weight of burdensome equipment and gear. For those who had to leave their landing crafts earlier than anticipated, the weight they carried meant a life-or-death struggle when the water they jumped into was over their heads.\n\n“Unfortunately, a number of men drowned because they didn’t even know how to swim. No one had considered the need for this basic skill among those in the invasion force,” McManus said in an interview with West Newsmagazine.\n\nThose who made it to shore faced the equally daunting task of trying to move rapidly with their heavy loads to escape enemy fire and advance on well-entrenched enemy positions.\n\nThat wasn’t the only problem. Although U.S. armed forces had a laudable commitment to provide medical care to servicemen during the war, the lack of medical evacuations to treat the wounded on D-Day was “rather stunning,” McManus observes in his book. He attributes this shortcoming, as well as the heavy loads troops had to carry, to planners and commanders being “too preoccupied with logistics and timetables, at the expense of practicalities.”\n\nWhile McManus doesn’t mince words in his critiques, he also has ample praise for the many whose actions ultimately turned the 19 hours of D-Day’s hell-on-earth into a success that turned the tide of the war and the history of the world. The book is filled with personal descriptions of heroism, bravery under fire and creative initiative by those faced with unexpected circumstances.\n\nHe spent two years writing and doing final research for his new book. However, he says his interest and other research date back some two decades when he visited the Normandy beaches as a graduate student.\n\nHe and his wife, Nancy, an audiologist at Mercy Hospital, also made a trip to the area last summer as he was in the final stages of writing the book. She took a number of current-day photographs included in the book. And, among other things, McManus visited with a young Frenchman who founded and is the curator of the Big Red One Museum at Colleville-sur-Mer, a town a short distance inland from Omaha beach.\n\n“Pierre (Gosselin) saved me from several mistakes,” McManus said of the museum owner. “He has made that museum his life and, in fact, lives in quarters above it.”\n\nMuch has been said about the strategy of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to fortify the Atlantic Wall and stop any invasion at the beaches. McManus concludes the German forces would have fared better with a more inland defense.\n\n“Using the hedgerows and fortifying them would have been a better and likely more successful alternative,” McManus observed.\n\nA graduate of Chaminade and then the University of Missouri with a degree in journalism, McManus originally had aimed for a career in sports broadcasting. But interest in writing and history acquired during his college years led to a change. He returned to school, earned a master’s degree in American history at Mizzou and a doctorate in American and military history from the University of Tennessee.\n\nHe has been on the staff at Missouri S&T for 14 years. Recently, he addressed the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., and is scheduled for an interview on National Public Radio’s Diane Rehm Show on June 5.\n\nOn June 2, he will give a keynote address and hold a book signing in the auditorium at the St. Louis County Library headquarters building, 1640 S. Lindbergh Blvd., beginning at 7 p.m. Doors will open at 6 p.m. and seating is limited."
