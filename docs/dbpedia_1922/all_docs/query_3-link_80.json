You are welcome to attend if you have not finished the book, but be prepared to hear the ending of the book.\n\nDiscussion should focus on the main themes, characters, and author of the book. While additional detail and experiences can be useful, please be brief, as the primary purpose is to share opinions of the book.\n\nDiscuss aspects of the book which did not appeal to you. Difficulties should be expressed as questions rather than statements.\n\nDiffering opinions should be expressed respectfully with the intent to disagree, not persuade others to modify their opinions. Keep an open mind, and carefully listen to the opinions of others.\n\nDiscuss with the group as a whole. Everyone will be given an opportunity to share; however, participation is not a requirement.\n\nThe group leader will allow discussion to progress naturally, but will redirect discussion to allow others the opportunity to share their thoughts.\n\nStart your own Book Group!\n\nAll Attleboro-area book groups are welcome to create a “Book Group” account at the Attleboro Public Library.\n\nAll book groups will:\n\nProvide a contact person and an e-mail address for the contact person\n\nProvide a schedule of titles chosen and meeting dates\n\nProvide a list of alternate titles in the event a title/copies are not available\n\nProvide a name for their book group\n\nProvide the number of copies required\n\nIf you would like to set up an account for your book group, please contact the Reference Department at apl_ref@sailsinc.org.\n\nOur Reference Department will:\n\nCreate an account for each book group\n\nPlace holds for book groups\n\nPost current and accurate signage on group holds shelf\n\nBe the primary contact for book groups\n\nMember Tips:\n\nMembers will pick up books from the holds area on the first floor of the library, or request them from APL staff if the books are located behind the circulation desk\n\nBooks will then be checked out to individual patron accounts"
