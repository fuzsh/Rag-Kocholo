This year, he’s helped Ford Motor Company through his partnership with Civic with strategies, content, and cultural interventions to navigate the transitions to autonomous, electric and connected vehicles. Last year, he helped Ford drive positive change with a transformative announcement of $1 billion of real estate and strategic investment in their home city of Detroit.\n\nJosh previously served as Quicken Loans and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert Chief Operating Officer to create a “for more-than-profit” approach to organizing and accelerating his portfolio of businesses, real estate, and sports holdings.\n\nPrior to his work in Detroit, Josh co-founded CreateHere, an entrepreneurship and cultural change organization that sparked over 10,000 new enterprises worldwide, and championed the world’s largest community visioning process, with over 26,000 surveys collected.\n\nJosh began his career by problem-solving with private foundations and public institutions in post-industrial cities first in Atlanta and eventually in Chattanooga.

She has experience in project management, OKR tracking, research, designing quantitative and qualitative data collection methods, defining and measuring impact, and the creation of a business planning curriculum.\n\nPrior to joining the For Purpose team, Tara was the Director of Operations and Development at Glass House Collective, a creative placemaking nonprofit, where she handled most of the organization’s behind-the-scenes work, from managing grants to assisting with program development to strategic planning.

His interest lies at the confluence of public and private partnerships, and the rich seam of meaningful value that can be derived from this process.\n\nHe grew up as a modern nomad, living in seven different countries across the Middle East and Europe, and speaking three languages at home. As a result of this cultural osmosis, he has a fascination for how the forces of history and culture shape the world we live in — leading to initial studies as an archaeologist at Brown University. Currently, he is a masters student at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) concentrated on strategy, cybersecurity and statecraft.\n\nPrior to working with the For Purpose team, Zak began building a career in New York, first as the fifteenth hire at a small startup, where he ran policy-focused programming and worked with thought leaders from Think Tanks to major journalistic outlets. Subsequently, he accepted a role at the marketing/consulting agency CIVIC. He has worked on projects for Ford Motor Company, IBM and Google — ranging from developing a corporate sustainability platform, integrating innovation into product technology, speechwriting for C-suite executives, and building partnerships with local community groups and educational institutions. Zak has also worked with a range of clients as a freelance strategist and ghostwriter, such as with Pathwayport, a insurance Saas provider, and Fruitful, a fintech financial planning platform.\n\nIn his free time, Zak is an avid reader of history, a workout nut and an outdoorsman (when his class schedule permits)."
