        "text": "Book Summary\n\nIn Fire and Fortitude - winner of the Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History - John C. McManus presented a riveting account of the US Army's fledgling fight in the Pacific following Pearl Harbor. Now, in Island Infernos, he explores the Army's dogged pursuit of Japanese forces, island by island, throughout 1944, a year that would bring America ever closer to victory or defeat.\n\nAfter some two years at war, the Army in the Pacific held ground across nearly a third of the globe, from Alaska's Aleutians to Burma and New Guinea. The challenges ahead were enormous: supplying a vast number of troops over thousands of miles of ocean; surviving in jungles ripe with dysentery, malaria, and other tropical diseases; fighting an enemy prone to ever-more desperate and dangerous assaults. Yet the Army had proven they could fight. Now, they had to prove they could win a war.\n\nBrilliantly researched and written, Island Infernos moves seamlessly from the highest generals to the lowest foot soldiers and in between, capturing the true essence of this horrible conflict. A sprawling yet page-turning narrative, the story spans the battles for Saipan and Guam, the appalling carnage of Peleliu, General MacArthur's dramatic return to the Philippines, and the grinding jungle combat to capture the island of Leyte. This masterful history is the second volume of John C. McManus's trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific War, proving McManus to be one of our finest historians of World War II.\n\nMedia Reviews\n\n\"McManus follows Fortitude and Fire with an outstanding second volume in his planned trilogy on the Pacific theater of WWII...Distinguished by informative deep dives into logistical and strategic issues and McManus's storytelling prowess, this is an excellent study of how the U.S. turned the tide of the war in the Pacific.\" - Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"The second of the author's three-volume chronicle of the war against Japan is well worth the wait...McManus' expertise shines brightest in his gripping descriptions of the tactics, technology, personalities, and gruesome fighting in a score of island campaigns…Outstanding military history.\" - Kirkus (starred review)\n\n\"The Pacific theater in World War II was the most exotic and bizarre environment for large-scale combat. John C. McManus succeeds admirably in conveying the real nature of the campaigns in the critical year of 1944, for men and commanders alike. This is a rich and absorbing narrative for anyone who wants to understand just how tough combat was for young Americans plunged into a deathly struggle for survival.\" - Richard Overy, author of Blood and Ruins: The Last Imperial War, 1931–1945\n\n\"Island Infernos cements John McManus as one of the leading historians of World War II writing today. The complex logistics, enormity, and awful brutal violence of the US Army's operations in the Pacific in 1944 are laid bare in utterly compelling detail. Full of deep knowledge and sound judgment, this book vividly brings alive many of the men involved, from the high command to those on the ground battling their way through some of the most difficult terrain imaginable in which to fight. With a narrative that never once lets up, McManus's book is a considerable achievement, and one that, importantly, adds much to our understanding of the Pacific War.\" - James Holland, author of Normandy '44: D-Day and the Epic 77-Day Battle for France\n\nThis information about Island Infernos was first featured in \"The BookBrowse Review\" - BookBrowse's membership magazine, and in our weekly \"Publishing This Week\" newsletter.
