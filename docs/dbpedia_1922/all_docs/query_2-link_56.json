        "text": "Thank you to John McManus for absolutely delivering such a service! John was great from the start! Basically everything he told me would happen through the process including milestones were spot on. I was very nervous at the front gate, but by the time we began going through the process I knew I had the right attorney and I am so Thankful for that! The process Could not have went any smoother and it takes a TOP NOTCH Attorney for that to happen!\n\nI will be sharing McManus and associates with any friend, relative, etc that would need such service moving forward! Great job Job, I am very thankful for you!\n\nNICK WHITE\n\nFinding an attorney who is excellent in his field as well as a kind and compassionate person is not always easy. He is both! It doesn't matter how bad your situation is, there is never any shame in dealing with McManus and Associates. He is down to earth, always willing to offer solutions and good sound advice, as well as the most important aspect for me which was reassurance. Going through bankruptcy is not just difficult with the weight of sorting through past debts, but also the stress that has accumulated by the time one needs an attorney. Thankfully he has made this process the least of my worries! He's also never too busy to reach out and touch base. Never had one bad experience here and I am very grateful.\n\nD4 HoneyBee\n\nWhat can I say about Mr. McManus, if I could give him 10 Stars I would. From the very start of our consultation he made me feel like there was a light at the end of the tunnel and that my case would be taken care of. He explained the process in a manner that I could understand. It was great to be able to be in a situation that makes me feel like I have some hope.I will definitely refer him to anyone I hear needs an Attorney....He is the Best!\n\nCarla A. Grayson\n\nI reached out to multiple bankruptcy attorneys in Indianapolis, including fishers and Carmel. After consulting with four of them, I must admit that I was thoroughly unimpressed. It seemed like some of them were taking advantage of my financial vulnerability and emotional fragility, using scare tactics to aggressively push for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. They failed to take the time to understand my unique financial situation.\n\nBut everything changed when I had an in-person consultation with Mr. John McManus today. Let me tell you, it was a game-changer. My anxiety, which was skyrocketing, plummeted to a peaceful zero.\n\nMr. McManus was an absolute delight to consult with. Not only did he possess a wealth of information, but he also exuded compassion, respect, kindness, and utmost professionalism. He had a no-nonsense approach and managed to simplify and clarify everything, ensuring that I understood the complexities of my situation.\n\nOriginally, I was scheduled for a 30-minute free in-person consultation, but Mr. McManus generously extended our meeting to nearly two hours. He patiently addressed each and every one of my questions, delving into great detail about how bankruptcy works. It was truly refreshing to witness his genuine concern for my well-being. His passion and expertise shone through brilliantly.\n\nSurprisingly, Mr. McManus did not recommend bankruptcy at this point, advising me to wait a few more months before considering filing. However, I knew deep down that I wanted him to be my representative and guide when the time comes, so I decided to retain his services regardless.\n\nTo all those burdened with stress, feeling overwhelmed, helpless, and embarrassed by their current financial turmoil, I want you to know that you are not alone. I implore you to do yourself an enormous favor and reach out to Mr. McManus without delay. I guarantee you won't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't. Our meeting left me with an overwhelming sense of peace. I highly recommend Mr. McManus to anyone in need of an Indianapolis bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nLiveFree\n\nPlease speak with John if you need to consider bankruptcy. I have a more \"involved\" situation that lead me to my choice of bankruptcy, in which I previously consulted with another bankruptcy firm about. The other firm was very rigid in their process and it didn't really matter to them what my circumstances were...so I walked away. I actually found John through my mom who also filed through him. John truly listened and factored in the nuances of my specific situation to ensure an outcome beneficial to me. He never made me feel ashamed or less than. He is QUICK to respond to any of your calls and it's impressive how fast on his toes he is, in terms of communicating with his clients at a moments notice. I never felt lost in this process, I knew exactly what was happening and what steps were next. Jill is also so kind and quick to communicate and relay messages to John if needed. They are both so warm and the small ownership aspect makes it so easy to just drop by the office if you need to. I finally feel like I can breathe and move on. I could not have made this decision without them. I am blessed and appreciative of them both.\n\nSkye Maree\n\nGreat experience. I am young and filing bankruptcy was not something I had planned on doing, but I made a lot of \"young\" mistakes. John explained everything that needed to be done, etc. We walked into the room to speak and I felt like my lawyer was the only one that truly prepared for this, as well as preparing me for this. A lot of people laughed it off and some lawyers missed information in their paperwork. John had everything together and it was a breeze. Thanks for the great experience!\n\nRachal M.\n\nSometimes when people have financial hardships they fail to reach out for help because of pride, fear or just confusion. We were in that state of mind when we noticed an add in the Christian Blue Book. \"Wow\" what a surprise we found an attorney who was cordial and positive. He listened to our story. We cannot say enough good things about him. He explained how the rock that was crushing us could instead be used to stand on top of. His name is John T. McManus Attorney at Law\n\nThanks,\n\nAl & Judy\n\nMy life landed me in a position that I felt overwhelmed with bills. I was dodging phone calls (important or not ) afraid to answer because bill collectors are so creative now days...... Making the choice to file bankruptcy can be embarrassing and make you feel as if you have ignored your moral compass. Contacting John McManus to assist me with resetting my life was not only stress and judgment free.... it was effective, and now over a year later. I am doing very well. I recently contacted John to refer a friend because my experience was so wonderful. He still had continual helpful information to share. This practice is GREAT! Thank you John and Associates\n\nM. Jones"
