        "text": "Winner of the Army Historical Foundation Award for Excellence in U.S. Army Writing\n\nFrom the liberation of the Philippines to the Japanese surrender, the final volume of John C. McManus's trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific War\n\nâBrilliant [and] rivetingâ¦ a truly great book.ââGen. David Petraeus â¢ âTriumphant [and] compelling.ââRichard Frank â¢ âMcManus is one of the bestâif not the bestâWorld War II historians working today.ââWorld War II magazine\n\nThe dawn of 1945 finds a US Army at its peak in the Pacific. Allied victory over Japan is all but assured. The only question is how many more monthsâor yearsâof fight does the enemy have left.Â John C. McManus,Â winner of the Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History, concludes hisÂ magisterial series, described by the Wall Street Journal as being âas vast and splendid as Rick Atkinsonâs Pulitzer Prize-winning Liberation Trilogy,â with this brilliant final volume.\n\nOn the island of Luzon, a months-long stand-off between US and Japanese troops finally breaks open, as American soldiers push into Manila, while paratroopers and amphibious invaders capture nearby Corregidor. The Philippines are soon liberated, and Allied strategists turn their eyes to China, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the Japanese home islands themselves. Readers will walk in the boots of American soldiers and officers, braving intense heat, rampant disease, and a by-now suicidal enemy, determined to kill as many opponents as possible before defeat, and they will encounter Japanese soldiers faced with the terrible choice between capitulation or doom. At the same time, this outstanding narrative lays bare the titanic ego and ambition of the Pacific Warâs most prominent general, Douglas MacArthur, and the complex challenges he faced in Japanâs unconditional surrender and Americaâs lengthy occupation."
