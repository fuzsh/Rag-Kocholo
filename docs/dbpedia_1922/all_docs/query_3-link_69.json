        "text": "In Fire and Fortitudeâwinner of the Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military HistoryâJohn C. McManus presented a riveting account of the US Army's fledgling fight in the Pacific following Pearl Harbor. Now, in Island Infernos, he explores the Armyâs dogged pursuit of Japanese forces, island by island, throughout 1944, a year that would bring America ever closer to victory or defeat.\n\nâA feat of prodigious scholarship.ââThe Wall Street Journal â¢ âWonderful.ââSt. Louis Post-Dispatch â¢Â âOutstanding.ââPublishers Weekly â¢ âRich and absorbing.ââRichard Overy, author of Blood and Ruins â¢ âA considerable achievement, and one that, importantly, adds much to our understanding of the Pacific War.ââJames Holland, author of Normandy â44\n\nAfter some two years at war, the Army in the Pacific held ground across nearly a third of the globe, from Alaskaâs Aleutians to Burma and New Guinea. The challenges ahead were enormous: supplying a vast number of troops over thousands of miles of ocean; surviving in jungles ripe with dysentery, malaria, and other tropical diseases; fighting an enemy prone to ever-more desperate and dangerous assaults. Yet the Army had proven they could fight. Now, they had to prove they could win a war.\n\nBrilliantly researched and written, Island Infernos moves seamlessly from the highest generals to the lowest foot soldiers and in between, capturing the true essence of this horrible conflict. A sprawling yet page-turning narrative, the story spans the battles for Saipan and Guam, the appalling carnage of Peleliu, General MacArthurâs dramatic return to the Philippines, and the grinding jungle combat to capture the island of Leyte. This masterful history is the second volume of John C. McManusâs trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific War, proving McManus to be one of our finest historians of World War II.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ"
