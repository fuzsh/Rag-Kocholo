        "text": "If you are looking for a survey of American Military History for your courses, your personal use, or institutional library, please consider buying _Ways of War_ co-authored by Matthew Muehlbauer and me. https://lnkd.in/eGJBn7A8 Here are endorsements and words of praise: \"This readily accessible book offers a clear and up to date account of military history,one that is highly pertinent in these troubled times. The second edition is a good instance of how best to keep books relevant and clear. Strongly recommended.\" - Jeremy Black, author of Air Power: A Global History \"This new edition brings the work up-to-date through an expanded introduction and the most recent events in international diplomacy and the Global War on Terror, probing into vital questions of national identity formation, technology, unofficial military tradition, and additional international context‚Äîfrom Queen Anne‚Äôs War to the effects of the Russo-Japanese war.\" - Ellen D. Tillman, Associate Professor of History at Texas State University and author of Dollar Diplomacy by Force: Nation-Building and Resistance in the Dominican Republic \"Authoritative and well written, WAYS OF WAR is a truly cutting edge survey of American military history. Packed with compelling narratives and crisp insights, this is not so much a traditional text book as a personal guided tour by two leading scholars through our military past. An excellent book and one that is certain to become a classic.\" - John C. McManus, Ph.D., Curators' Distinguished Professor of U.S. Military History, Missouri S&T, Author of Grunts: Inside the American Infantry Combat Experience, World War II Through Iraq \"The sheer scope of the text is impressive, yet it does not descend overmuch into the weeds of battles and military trivia, instead remaining focused on how conflict involving Americans, and not just European Americans, has evolved over the years.\" - Dr. John T. Kuehn, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, USA ‚ÄúIt is an impressive undertaking to chronicle the breadth of American military history in a single volume, and Muehlbauer and Ulbrich make a significant contribution to the literature in their effort.‚Äù ‚ÄúAround 1980, an increasing number of scholars began moving away from the traditional military history of battles and tactics in order to pay greater attention to the interaction between war and broader society. The ‚Äúwar and society‚Äù approach embraces a host of cultural, domestic, gender, economic, political, environmental, and other issues which transcend military history‚Äôs traditional focus on the conduct of armed forces, particularly how they fight.‚Äù -Kevin Dougherty, The Citadel Charleston, South Carolina\n\nI am glad to announce Norwich University's 5th Peace and War Summit that addresses the theme of \"War, Memory, and Reconciliation\" on Monday, March 18, 2024. You can register for this in-person event (with remote options) here. https://lnkd.in/egxY7UXk The global community has witnessed the outbreak of numerous military conflicts within and between nations, which cause immediate sufferings, such as deaths, injuries, and economic destructions. These intrastate and interstate wars lead the international community to seriously address those devastating consequences caused by wars, as viewed in the contemporary Russia-Ukraine War and the Israel-Palestine War. However, it tends to give scant attention to the incessantly negative impact of wars at the individual, societal, and international levels, including lingering painful memories and traumas as well as historical antagonism between former adversary ethnic groups and nations. In this context, Norwich University‚Äôs 5th Peace and War Summit thoroughly addresses the issue of war, memory, and reconciliation in diverse regions to promote our understanding of the significance of the persistent effects of past military conflicts on current societies. #norwich #war #memory #reconciliation\n\nüìö Dive into the world of Model United Nations (MUN) with \"A Student Preparation Guide to Model United Nations (MUN)\" by Dr. Dheeraj Mehrotra! üåê Whether you're a seasoned MUN participant or new to the experience, this comprehensive guide is your roadmap to success in diplomatic simulations. üí° Authored by renowned educator Dr. Dheeraj Mehrotra, this book offers practical tips, strategies, and insights to help students excel in MUN conferences.
