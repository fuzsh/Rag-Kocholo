        "text": "Growing Weeders into Leaders reminds us that great leadership is a quest for excellence, not only in ourselves, but in our teams and in our work. Jeff McManus has coached my colleagues in the classroom on how to create winning teams, and now he has brought that same leadership wisdom to the page in this easy to digest book, full of true-life leadership stories. No matter the industry, the lessons transfer seamlessly, a gentle reminder that at the end of the day, leadership is all about investing in people.\n\nI found Growing Weeders Into Leaders an inspiring and accurate reflection of the challenges involved with managing the landscape and facilities of a comprehensive higher education institution. I enjoyed and appreciated Jeff’s candor and innovation in cultivating leadership within his organization. His work clearly demonstrates the impact of genuine, caring leadership on the development and success of an organization. This is a must-read for anyone or any industry looking to impact the lives of others in a positive way!\n\nI have been coming to Oxford for the better part of 40 years, and can speak firsthand to the tremendous improvement that the University of Mississippi’s campus has seen under the leadership of Jeff McManus. It is no accident that the campus has been recognized as most beautiful on five separate occasions, and when you read this book, you’ll see why. Jeff’s leadership principles and philosophies discussed in this book can take any size business or workforce and turn them into a truly unified team that is highly motivated to achieve success. I have had the privilege of hearing Jeff speak on two separate occasions and I highly recommend him – the only thing better than the book is Jeff in person!\n\nJeff’s book may be about landscape management, but the techniques he employs and teaches are transferrable to any industry or team. McManus teaches a system with identifiable objectives, measurement techniques, and easily communicated team principles. This is a book for leaders at any stage of their development.\n\nIn Growing Weeders into Leaders, I recognize the home-grown values and principles that, when implemented, can inspire and guide an organization and the people in it. Jeff tells the story of a smart, hardworking team of men and women who, in the words of one of our greatest story-tellers, William Faulkner, not only endured, but prevailed in their pursuit of excellence."
