Marshall Sahlins's work and seminar on Fijian history became my introduction to a linguistic view of culture and the experience of historical continuity and change that continues to inform my understanding of history. Thanks to Sahlins, I came to work on the early modern British Isles and Europe via Oceania, a crooked road that has greatly enriched the travel.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nAllison M. Beese\n\nProfessor of Materials Science and Engineering\n\nBook Title\n\nThe Exceptions: Nancy Hopkins, MIT, and the Fight for Women in Science\n\nAuthor\n\nKate Zernike\n\nBook Description\n\nAs Bonnie Garmus of the New York Times wrote, \"Thanks to Zernike, we see the personal toll unconscious bias takes â€” not just in time lost or talent discarded, but on the greater good. Maybe the reason weâ€™re still running for the cure is because systemic discrimination continues to run even faster. The good news is, Zernikeâ€™s book will inspire a host of non-renegades to do something about it. Rules are indeed made to be broken. Have at it.\"\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nCatherine Berdanier\n\nAssociate Professor of Mechanical Engineering\n\nBook Title\n\nA Ring of Endless Light\n\nAuthor\n\nMadeleine L'Engle\n\nBook Description\n\nAll Madeleine L’Engle’s books, for me, have been a consistent thread through my life starting around my middle school years. Still to this day, when I read A Ring of Endless Light (an old, trusted friend at this point), the book helps me see something new about myself, about science, about faith, and about how we are all connected in our callings as stewards of the earth: scientists, engineers, writers, poets, and those of us who branch across traditional disciplinary lines.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nNita Bharti\n\nAssociate Professor of Biology\n\nBook Title\n\nCreative Quest\n\nAuthor\n\nQuestlove (Ahmir Thompson)\n\nBook Description\n\nCreativity is one of the most important and overlooked skills in science. It is essential for producing original ideas and devising novel solutions. Developing creativity requires training and practice like any other skill. Questlove provides rare and valuable insight into the process of finding and refining the creative skills that helped him become one of the greatest drummers of all time. His wisdom can and should be broadly applied across disciplines.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nDouglas Bird\n\nprofessor\n\nBook Title\n\nBlood Meridian; or, The Evening Redness in the West\n\nAuthor\n\nCormac McCarthy\n\nBook Description\n\nI may have selected this book due to McCarthy's recent death; but the work is never far from my mind. I heard the news of his death June 13 this year when I was on my way to the remote Aboriginal community where I work in Australia's Western Desert. Coincidentally I first read the book 23 years ago on my very first trip to Aboriginal Australia. For me the work is a vivid description of settler colonialism's unrelenting hellscape in remote Indigenous lands. I hope it is a cautionary tale.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nPamela Blackmon\n\nProfessor of Political Science\n\nBook Title\n\nThinking Fast and Slow\n\nAuthor\n\nDaniel Kahneman\n\nBook Description\n\nThis book showed me how to slow down my thought process to ensure that I was making decisions wisely. In addition, it illustrated the importance of thinking fast to function in everyday life. I would like to think that it has resulted in my thinking more slowly about important decisions and being aware of biases and mistakes that come from thinking too fast.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nJennifer Anne Boittin\n\nProfessor of French, Francophone Studies, and History, and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\n\nBook Title\n\nLe Grand Camouflage: Ecrits de dissidence\n\nAuthor\n\nSuzanne CÃ©saire\n\nBook Description\n\nJohn M. Merriman, my advisor, and Tyler Stovall, a mentor, left us just before I published my second (promotion) book. Our library had their books, but not yet Suzanne Roussi CÃ©saire's. A Martinican intellectual, her censored dissident writings shaped my dissertation and first book. She remains unrecognized, like many whose histories I research. Her poetic refusals of injustice started me on a path, lit by John and Tyler, of listening to and sharing obscured voices in archives. Merci.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nJacob L Bourjaily\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nBook Title\n\nGrassmannian Geometry of Scattering Amplitudes\n\nAuthor\n\nNima Arkani-Hamed, Jacob Bourjaily, Freddy Cachazo, Alexander Goncharov, Alexander Postnikov, and Jaroslav Trnka\n\nBook Description\n\nâ€”\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nMildred Boveda\n\nAssociate Professor of Education\n\nBook Title\n\nTroublemakers: Lessons in Freedom from Young Children at School\n\nAuthor\n\nCarla Shalaby\n\nBook Description\n\nCarla Shalaby and I attended the same graduate school. She impressed me with her boldness and integrity. When Troublemakers came out, I imagined the book would be brilliant. Reading it moved me. The review I wrote about Troublemakers happens to be one of my most downloaded writings. Shalaby masterfully challenged traditional notions of who should inform education research and policy. Her humanizing, student-centered, and love-based research exemplifies the scholarship most needed in our field.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nWei-Fan Chen\n\nprofessor of information sciences and technology\n\nBook Title\n\nChinese-English Bible: Old and New Testament, Union, New International Version\n\nAuthor\n\nHymnody and Bible House\n\nBook Description\n\nThis Chinese-English Bible has had a profound impact on my life, serving as a guiding light that helps me delve into not only my own identity but also the One who created me.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nLori B. Cisney\n\nAssociate Librarian\n\nBook Title\n\nHeaven\n\nAuthor\n\nRandy Alcorn\n\nBook Description\n\nWhat comes when we've passed from this life? It seems to be human nature to wonder about this philosophical question. I know that I have wished for understanding in this area and Heaven, by Randy Alcorn, has given me peace, hope, and assurance about the future. I have gone back to this book again and again as I have faced loss and challenges in my personal life. I hope that it will bring the same peace to those who get to borrow it from the University Libraries!\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nKevin Curry\n\nAssociate Professor of Agricultural and Extension Education\n\nBook Title\n\nScience Matters: Achieving Scientific Literacy\n\nAuthor\n\nJames Trefil and Robert M. Hazen\n\nBook Description\n\nWhether we look to science to help us tackle public policy decisions or commit to thinking critically about new information when forming an opinion on an issue, individuals who are scientifically literate make wiser choices for themselves and society at large. While science literacy involves many elements of thinking like a scientist, this book walks through the precursory steps of basic science knowledge to be able to have intelligent conversation on the issues.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nKai Du\n\nAssociate Professor of Accounting\n\nBook Title\n\nThe Federalist Papers\n\nAuthor\n\nAlexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay\n\nBook Description\n\nA steadfast companion since my college years in China, this book represents the enduring spirit of democracy and constitutionalism that inspired my pursuit of truth, freedom, and the rule of law as a first-generation immigrant and father of a U.S. citizen. As I reflect on my journey and the current affairs in the United States and China, it reinforces the importance of open discourse and democratic values and reminds me of the progress made and the arduous path that still lies ahead for both nations.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nBoaz Dvir\n\nAssociate Professor of Journalism\n\nBook Title\n\nPolin: Studies in Polish Jewry Volume 33: Jewish Religious Life in Poland since 1750\n\nAuthor\n\nFrançois Guesnet, Antony Polonsky, Ada Rapoport-Albert, Marcin Wodziński (editors)\n\nBook Description\n\nThis book includes a scholarly study that contains references to interviews of my Saba (“grandfather” in Hebrew). Ozer Grundman, who grew up in a Hasidic home in Poland, spoke about maintaining his religious faith through nine Nazi concentration camps. His belief in God remained intact until he was liberated at Buchenwald by the U.S. Army. May my Saba’s memory be a blessing.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nJulie Ealy\n\nProfessor of Chemistry\n\nBook Title\n\nLessons in Chemistry: A Novel\n\nAuthor\n\nBonnie Garmus\n\nBook Description\n\nI loved this book for its humor and how the author introduced chemistry to an audience of primarily women via a cooking show in the 1960s. It was a revolutionary approach that encouraged women to think and ask questions way ahead of time. Instead of “vinegar” or “salt” she said “acetic acid” and “sodium chloride.” The author’s scientific knowledge was evident and intertwined with many wonderful laughs that were obvious to anyone in close proximity as I read the book.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nJohn Phillip Robb Eicher\n\nAssociate Professor of History\n\nBook Title\n\nWonderblood\n\nAuthor\n\nJulia Whicker\n\nBook Description\n\nWonderblood is the first novel written by my partner, Julia Whicker. It is a fantasy novel that projects early modern Europe onto a future of the United States ravaged by deadly prion pathogens that have infected the Earth. Survivors wait in vain at Cape Canaveral, Florida — a new “Vatican City” — for the return of astronaut “saviors.” I chose this book because it represents the beauty of words and the power of stories that inspired, and continues to inspire, my own writing.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nChristopher G. Engeland\n\nProfessor of Biobehavioral Health\n\nBook Title\n\nA Short History of Nearly Everything\n\nAuthor\n\nBill Bryson\n\nBook Description\n\nThis book walks the reader through a myriad of scientific disciplines including chemistry, geology, astronomy, and more. The author provides a broad overview, including the historic timing and significance of each field's most important developments. Aside from providing a digestible introduction to fields I did not know, this perfectly embodied the curiosity that drew me to science - and reminded me that we must remain ever curious about all science, not just that with which we are familiar.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nJohn Ewing\n\nProfessor of Agricultural and Extension Education\n\nBook Title\n\nAnswering Why: Unleashing Passion, Purpose, and Performance in Younger Generations\n\nAuthor\n\nMark C. Perna\n\nBook Description\n\nThis book has helped me as an educator to work with students of the Y and Z generations; the \"WhY\" generation as the author calls them. It has allowed me to focus my instruction in ways that are meaningful to these students that have grown up in a very different world compared to any previous generation. This book has helped reinvigorate my passion for helping students find their purpose and passion in their future careers.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nElana Farace\n\nProfessor of Public Health Science and Neurosurgery\n\nBook Title\n\nA Wrinkle in Time\n\nAuthor\n\nMadelyn L'Engle\n\nBook Description\n\nA Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L'Engle fortified me with themes of being an outsider, the pressure to conform and the danger of conformity, the importance of giving everything to fight against evil and cherish the light, and the deep value of curiosity. It was an early encounter with strong female characters, a young girl as the heroine, and the power of feminism; channeling one's anger to make the universe a better place: â€œStay angry, little Meg, you will need all your anger now\" - Mrs. Whatsit.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nSamuel Frederick\n\nProfessor of German\n\nBook Title\n\nFinnegans Wake\n\nAuthor\n\nJames Joyce\n\nBook Description\n\nI've probably spent more hours of my life reading this book than any other--certainly over half my life. And I still struggle to understand it. It's a humbling reminder of how much there is still to learn... even after becoming a full professor.\n\nGive it a gander! I've recently been wrestling with pages 314-315. If you have any insights, let me know!\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nSusan Fredricks\n\nFull\n\nBook Title\n\nThe Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes\n\nAuthor\n\nDuBose Heyward\n\nBook Description\n\nAlthough this book is a childrenâ€™s book, the tale resonates with all female professionals. Reading this book as a child provided me with the knowledge that if I wanted a career I would have to endure. The story shows that often times women need to continuously prove themselves and jump through more hoops to get to the those golden shoes. This narrative eloquently illustrates the struggles of being a mother while pursing a career. It is a must read for all career minded women and men.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nVikash V. Gayah\n\nProfessor of Civil Engineering\n\nBook Title\n\nLittle Blue Truck Leads the Way\n\nAuthor\n\nAlice Schertle\n\nBook Description\n\nThis is how I introduced my kids to my field (transportation engineering). It was a fun way to mix work with family life, and I will always remember reading it to them during this journey.\n\nYear\n\n2023\n\nDaniel Robert George\n\nProfessor of Humanities\n\nBook Title\n\nSiddhartha\n\nAuthor\n\nHermann Hesse\n\nBook Description\n\nHesse reminds us that to be human is to live in a world that contains immense suffering, loss, and despair, and yet also gives glimpses of harmony, unity, grace, beauty, enchantment, and eternal perfection. As we go through different life stages we may ask: what is our purpose? What is the universe and the great mystery of creation asking of us now? Hesse encourages us to do as Siddhartha doesâ€”watch the river of life with a quiet heart and an open, expectant soul and simply listen for meaning.\n\nYear\n\n2023"
