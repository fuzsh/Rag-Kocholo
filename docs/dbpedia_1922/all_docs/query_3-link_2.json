McManus, PhD, Presents “Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the Pacific, 1941–1943”\n\n1:30 p.m. Presentation | 2:30 p.m. Book Signing\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War and Democracy is delighted to host John C. McManus, leading military historian and author of 13 books, to discuss his latest work Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the Pacific, 1941–1943.\n\nSince World War II ended nearly 75 years ago, the common memory of how the war was fought by Americans has been that the Army was assigned to the European theater while the Navy and Marines took the Pacific. Though that is primarily correct for the fighting in Europe, it certainly was not the case in the Pacific, where the story of the Army's contribution to victory on the road to Tokyo was marginalized to the early defeat in the Philippines.\n\nMcManus, one of the country's leading military historians and prolific authors, puts the focus on the \"forgotten\" Army, its efforts, and its contributions in the first years of the war with his new book Fire and Fortitude.\n\nHe takes readers from Pearl Harbor—a rude awakening for a military woefully unprepared for war—to Makin Island, a sliver of coral reef where the Army was tested against an already, and increasingly, desperate Japanese foe. Fire and Fortitude tells the story of the highest ranks, from Generals Douglas MacArthur, Robert Eichelberger, Joseph Stilwell, and Walter Krueger, all the way down to the GIs who were fighting in the foxholes, jungles, coral, and sand.\n\nThe presentation is free and open to the public but please register to attend.\n\nCan’t make it the Museum? Watch the event live."
