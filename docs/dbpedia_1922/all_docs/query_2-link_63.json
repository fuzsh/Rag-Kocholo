        "text": "CAN I BUY ONE TICKET TO SHARE AMONG MY GROUP?\n\nNo. To attend an in-person gathering, each member of your group will need an individual ticket to enter the host site venue at check-in. And to attend online, each member of your group will need an individual ticket to participate in interactive elements of the Online Experience.\n\nDO I NEED TO HAVE THE NAMES AND EMAIL ADDRESSES OF ALL THE ATTENDEES IN MY GROUP WHEN I REGISTER?\n\nIt is preferred that you enter all names and email addresses of attendees in your group at the time of registration, but it is not required. If you do not have the names of all parties in your group when registering, the online system will add an open “empty” registration for each unknown guest corresponding to the number of tickets purchased. You will need to add guest names and unique email addresses prior to the event.\n\nDO YOU OFFER GROUP RATES?\n\nNot currently. Tickets may be purchased in bulk but are sold at individual rates. That said, some groups may wish to host a private viewing. For information about hosting opportunities for both large and small groups, as well as private and public viewings, go to GlobalLeadership.org/host.\n\nHOW DO I UPDATE ATTENDEE INFORMATION? OR LOOK UP MY REGISTRATION AND TICKET INFO?\n\nTo find your GLS 2025 registration info, please use the link provided in your confirmation email. Or you can click on the Register Now button on this page, select any GLS experience, and on the Details page that pops up, scroll to the bottom and select “Find My Registration.” There you can enter your email and the system will provide a link to all your registrations.\n\nIS THERE ON-SITE CHILDCARE OR FACILITIES FOR NURSING MOMS AT THE CONFERENCE?\n\nThis depends on the local host site! Please inquire directly with the local host site venue you plan to attend to find out about on-site childcare options or the availability of facilities for nursing mothers at their specific venue.\n\nDO YOU HAVE SPECIAL POLICIES FOR CANCELLATIONS, HOLDS, AND TRANSFERS?\n\nYes, we do!\n\nCANCELLATION POLICY"
