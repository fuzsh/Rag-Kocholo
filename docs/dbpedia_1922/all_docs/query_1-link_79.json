        "text": "Although we experience time in a linear fashion, I'm choosing to ignore that and pretend that it's not the middle of February by writing about all the books I read in 2023. (I'd meant to have this post up before the end of January, at the latest, but life, work, making headway on the WIP, and wisdom tooth removal means this is happening now. Such is life. Now, onward!)\n\nMy reading goal for 2023 was to read a minimum of 40 books. My unstated stretch goal was to read 50 books.\n\nI fell one short of my goal by finishing 39 books, and not from lack of effort as the last one I finished on December 31. In August and September I got heavily sidetracked by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of Kingdom. It is very good, very involving, and very bad if you're trying to read a lot of books. All the same, I regret nothing.\n\nThese are the books I read, in chronological order:\n\n-Steam Titans: Cunard, Collins, and the Epic Battle for Commerce on the North Atlantic by William M. Fowler Jr.\n\n-The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson\n\n-The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia\n\n-Leech by Hiron Ennes\n\n-All You Need is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka\n\n-Locklands by Robert Jackson Bennett\n\n-The Red Scholar's Wake by Aliette de Bodard\n\n-The Fall of Berlin 1945 by Antony Beevor\n\n-Magic for Liars by Sarah Gailey\n\n-Feed Them Silence by Lee Mandelo\n\n-Rubicon by J.S. Dewes\n\n-The Geek Feminist Revolution by Kameron Hurley\n\n-The Lies of the Ajungo by Moses Ose Utomi\n\n-Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee\n\n-Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh\n\n-Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the Pacific War, 1941-1943 by John C. McManus\n\n-Nona the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir\n\n-The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi\n\n-The Space Between Worlds by Micaiah Johnson\n\n-Emergent Properties by Aimee Ogden\n\n-Jade City by Fonda Lee\n\n-Never Say You Can't Survive: How to Get Through Hard Times by Making Up Stories by Charlie Jane Anders\n\n-And What Can We Offer You Tonight by Premee Mohamed\n\n-Finna by Nino Cipri\n\n-Mammoths at the Gates by Nghi Vo\n\n-Some by Virtue Fall by Alexandra Rowland\n\n-Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi\n\n-France on Trial: The Case of Marshal Petain by Julian T. Jackson\n\n-Pageboy by Elliot Page\n\n-The Consuming Fire by John Scalzi\n\n-The Last Emprox by John Scalzi\n\n-A Fire Born of Exile by Aliette de Bodard\n\n-Starter Villain by John Scalzi\n\n-Sicily '43: The First Assault on Fortress Europe by James Holland\n\n-System Collapse by Martha Wells\n\n-Eight Days in May: The Final Collapse of the Third Reich by Volker Ullrich\n\n-Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind by Molly McGhee\n\n-To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose\n\n-Witch King by Martha Wells\n\nBecause I've gotten to the point where I don't finish a book unless I'm enjoying it (Life is too short and my to-read list too long for me to struggle through a book I'm not enjoying.), I really liked all 39 of these books. Picking a top-five is impossible and even a top-ten very difficult. Also, the criteria for something being “the best” of any particular category is extremely subjective and weighing, say, a piece of nonfiction against a science fiction novel is such a mismatched comparison that it's practically useless.\n\nMy preferred approach is to think about the books I read last year and consider which ones I would recommend for other people to read. Although I'd recommend any book on this list, I'll narrow it down to these ten:\n\n1. Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh because I absolutely loved this book and it's an engaging exploration of how a person raised in a totalitarian, racist society deprograms herself.\n\n2. To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose because it's an excellent secondary world fantasy (based on Native American history here in the US) about an Indigenous teenager finding a dragon's egg and attending a dragon school run by colonizers. Heartily recommended.\n\n3. A Fire Born of Exile by Aliette de Bodard because it's a sapphic Count of Monte Cristo retelling set in a Vietnamese-inspired space empire. Gorgeously written.\n\n4. Feed Them Silence by Lee Mandelo because it's an intriguing exploration of consent, scientific ethics, and how a woman destroys her relationship with her wife in pursuit of a selfish goal.\n\n5. Pageboy by Elliot Page because it's a well-written memoir about grappling with gender and his body while navigating the issues of fame. I will say that just about every content warning (sexual assault, drug use, violence, stalking, disordered eating) apply to this book because Page does not flinch from the things that occurred in his life. I think it makes the book that much better, but it isn't an easy read at some points.\n\n6. And What Can We Offer You Tonight by Premee Mohamed because it's an intriguing secondary world fantasy set within a high-class brothel and after one of the workers is killed, others begin to think about how they can take their freedom back.\n\n7. Leech by Hiron Ennes because it's an intensely atmospheric horror novel written from the perspective of a hivemind virus who gets locked in a battle with an emergent new pathogen that can kill it. (Not too horrific or else I wouldn't have been able to finish it.)\n\n8. Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi because I recommend anything he writes and this story about humanity escaping to space after environmental devastation and then returning to the Earth and gentrifying communities has gorgeous prose and excellent characters.\n\n9. The Space Between Worlds by Micaia Johnson because it's a great multiverse novel that tackles issues of class and race in an unflinching, engaging manner.\n\n10. Witch King by Martha Wells because it's a totally new world, character, and story from her that I absolutely loved reading.\n\nI'm glad I started keeping track of my reading back in 2021, because otherwise I wouldn't have realized just how many John Scalzi books I read this year. I can think of each of them individually (though the two Interdependency books merge together in my mind because I read them back to back in the course of, perhaps, a week), but I didn't fully recognize I read four Scalzi books. They were all good, but I think the two Interdependency books were more up my alley, and I liked Kaiju Preservation Society a bit more than Starter Villain.\n\nRubicon by J.S. Dewes was a particularly delightful surprise this year. I read The Last Watch in 2022 and thought it was well done, but I didn't connect with it very well. Rubicon, however, I devoured. I ripped through that book in a few days and if there's a sequel I will absolutely pick it up. It's about a woman soldier who is reincarnated into a freshly cloned body each time she dies on the battlefield. After a long while she's provided with an AI assistant that's merged into her consciousness in the hopes it will turn the tide of the war. It didn't end the way I expected and I loved it for that.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of this year, my goal is to read 50 books. I know setting a solid reading goal can be a bit tricksy in the sense it encourages, or rewards depending on your perspective, short books and fast reading. That's a valid criticism. For me, personally, I like setting a numeric goal because it's aspirational and it encourages me to read the books I have. The number of unread books in my personal library is hilariously massive, and having a number to chase encourages me to pick these books up and read them. If I enjoy them, I will finish them. If I don't enjoy them, or don't connect with them, then remain unfinished and are placed in the donation box for my local library's bookstore.\n\nI've read 7 books of various lengths already, so I'm off to a good start. I'm excited for the books I want to read this year and that I'll get to share them with others!"
