        "text": "Dean's Message, Spring 2024\n\nThe academic year is coming to an end, and as it seems to be the trend, it has approached way too fast! Newly admitted students have come out to catch a glimpse of campus life for next year, during Preview Day. The campus recently celebrated another successful Day of Giving; A heartfelt thank you to everyone who generously donated to help ensure that we continue to ‘Engineer with a Mission!’ Our seniors are ready for their Senior Design Conference presentations, and we all eagerly await the end-of-the-year events and celebrations.\n\nA Legacy of Passion: Dr. Tonya Nilsson's Journey at SCU\n\nDr. Tonya Nilsson, senior lecturer and vice chair for the Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering Department, began her journey at Santa Clara University (SCU) in 2010, driven by a twist of fate.

Attended by industry partners, Silicon Valley researchers and engineers, campus affiliates and friends of the School of Engineering, this showcase provides the School with an outstanding venue for research exposure while also affording students an excellent professional development and networking experience.\n\nBioengineering senior Erik Risa '17 has been accepted to the University of Washington Medical School!\n\nWith future plans of being a neurosurgeon or neurologist, Erik fills his time at SCU with a number of activities outside the classroom: member of Tau Beta Pi (the engineering honor society) and the University Honors Program, engineering tutor, bioengineering researcher, tenor saxophone player in the SCU Jazz Band, member of the SCU Emergency Medical Services Squad, and he is a Markkula Center for Applied Ethics 2016-17 Honzel Fellow in Health Care Ethics, focusing a research project on neuroethics. Congratulations, Erik!\n\nLunch with an Entrepreneur: Frankie Roohparvar '89\n\nFrankie Roohparvar '89 MS (electrical engineering) was the guest speaker at this week’s Lunch with an Entrepreneur. A serial entrepreneur and self-professed “idea guy,” Roohparvar is Executive Chairman at Batteroo, has launched multiple start-ups, holds more than 500 patents, sits on the board of three current start-ups, has a spreadsheet filled with ideas for future projects, and enjoys mentoring fledgling entrepreneurs—encouraging them to “look at things sideways to see problems and solutions in ways other people haven’t noticed.” His current venture is a device that has the potential to extend the life of disposable batteries by up to 8x their normal range. As an upstart in this $15 billion market, his company has been the target of online smear campaigns and industrial espionage, but Roo\n\nOpinion: Set high expectations of women engineers and they’ll meet them\n\nAlmost every woman in engineering I’ve talked to knows the pressure of having to prove herself. She knows what it’s like to be meticulously perfect in her calculations, and to accept that regardless of her intelligence, her work will be checked again by someone who doesn’t trust her. She knows that at the end of the day, mistakes hold more weight than they should. I say almost every woman because I am one of the few that has rarely experienced this. I’m lucky. I’m an anomaly.\n\nTraveling to Rwanda: Top 10 Lessons I Learned\n\nTraveling to Nyange, Rwanda, with EWB was one of the greatest experiences I have had as a Santa Clara engineering student. The opportunity to use the engineering skills I have gained throughout the years at SCU to empower the tile-making cooperative we work with was truly humbling and rewarding. I also learned a lot and here are my top 10 lessons for any future EWB Rwandan travelers and/or other service-based travelers.\n\nNanoGrid\n\nEnergy sustainability and the aging grid infrastructure in the United States are two important subjects at the crossroads between politics, economics and technology. One proposed solution to these two issues revolves around the concept of an islanded microgrid which we named the NanoGrid.\n\nMessage from the Chair\n\nHello! Please let me introduce myself as the new chair of the Department of Bioengineering. I am Jonathan (Zhiwen) Zhang. I would like to thank my colleagues and students who elected me as chair and I offer my deep appreciation and gratitude to Professor Yuling Yan, founding Chair, for her dedicated leadership of the department from 2012-2018."
