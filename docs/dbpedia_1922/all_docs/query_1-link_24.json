        "text": "When St. John’s opened its doors in 1870, the Vincentian founders challenged the University to provide a Catholic higher education for all students, regardless of means.\n\nTo ensure the strength of the Vincentian mission at a time of growing need, St. John’s has launched the Partners for Student Success Scholarship Initiative. The goal is to increase the University’s Scholarship Endowment Funds by raising $15 million over five years. Through this effort, generous alumni and friends make a lasting impact by creating named scholarship endowments.\n\nEndowed scholarship applications are being accepted for students applying for consideration for the current academic year. You must have the completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on file for the year in which you are applying for endowed scholarship. Applicants for endowed scholarships must be in good academic and judicial standing. Apply here by completing the general scholarship application.\n\nHow it Works\n\nA New Way to Make a Difference\n\nThrough the Partners for Student Success Scholarship Program, generous alumni and friends can establish a permanent endowment with an outright gift of $100,000 or more, or a pledge of $100,000 or greater (payable over three to five years). The University will reinvest the gift for four years, increasing its earning power.\n\nIn addition, St. John’s will match five percent, six percent, or seven percent of the total pledge or gift depending on the number of years taken to pay the full amount. The match will provide student awards while the donor’s gifts generate interest.\n\nServing New Generations\n\nA Source of Opportunity\n\nSt. John’s remains committed to serving all deserving students, including those from financially strapped families. For example,\n\nMore than one-third of the annual operating budget supports student assistance;\n\nIn 2023, 99 percent of undergraduates received financial aid and $307 million of institutional support to all students.\n\nYet rising costs present new challenges for many working and middle-class students—especially those who are the first in their families to attend college. At St. John’s, about 36 percent of entering freshmen in 2023 received federal Pell Grants for highest need.\n\nThe Partners for Student Success Scholarship Program will help new generations of entering freshmen to meet the costs associated with a St. John’s education.\n\nThree Plans for Funding an Endowment\n\nDonors establish endowments that provide permanent scholarship assistance for the growing number of entering freshmen with high financial need. There are three options for creating an endowment:\n\nPartners for Student SuccessYear OneYear TwoYear ThreeYear FourYear FiveYear SixProgram A: Outright gift or pledge payments exceeding $100,000 in first year.$100,000Endowment earnings Scholarship Award (New) *Earnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvested$5,788*\n\nEndowment award$6,078*\n\nEndowment awardUniversity Match Award (New) *$7,000$7,000$7,000$7,000Program B: Three-Year Pledge Period$33,333 +$33,333$33,333Endowment earnings Scholarship Award (New) *Earnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvested$5,517*\n\nEndowment award$5,793*\n\nEndowment awardUniversity Match Award (New) *$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000Program C: Five-Year Pledge Period$20,000$20,000$20,000$20,000$20,000Endowment earnings Scholarship Award (New) *Earnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvestedEarnings reinvested$5,802*\n\nEndowment awardUniversity Match Award (New) *$0$5,000*$5,000*$5,000*$5,000*\n\nPartners for Student Success Initiative Endowments\n\nAlbert J.

Tobin College of Business, etc.)\n\nBy major (e.g., English, math, finance, accounting)\n\nBy program participation (e.g., global studies, athletics)\n\nAward process\n\nScholarship recipients are selected by the University’s Office of Financial Aid based on need and/or scholastic achievement and according to the donor’s wishes as stipulated in the Scholarship Agreement.\n\nNaming your Scholarship\n\nYou may also choose to name your endowed funds for yourself or in honor or memory of a loved one. Each grantor is asked to provide a brief bio on themselves and/or the person for whom the scholarship is named. It helps to ensure the future recipients will be able to know the Grantor’s wishes.\n\nDonors who establish scholarships impact the lives of students and help to secure the future of St. John’s!\n\nComplete your scholarship application online.\n\nEndowment Management\n\nNew York State Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (NYPMIFA)\n\nEndowed Scholarship Listing\n\n• A.

Visiting the Writing Center is a wonderful resource, and also one of the requirements to which you agreed when accepting your scholarship.\n\nWhat sort of information do donors like to hear?\n\nOur donors want to hear all about you. What is your major? What brought you to St. John’s University? What are you involved with on- and off-campus? What do you hope to do in the future? What has this scholarship meant to you and how has it helped you? You can talk about your family, where you grew up, etc. The thank you letter is a way for your donor to get to know you as a person and as a student.\n\nWhy are letters uploaded to UIS*, emailed and/or sent via interoffice mail?\n\nLetters are uploaded on the UIS to ensure that your award is paid to your account within 48 hours.
