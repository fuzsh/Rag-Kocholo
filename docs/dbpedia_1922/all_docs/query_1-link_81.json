This is a one-year position renewable for a second year based on successful performance. CARGC produces and promotes scholarly research on global media, communication, and public life. Our work brings together regional and area studies scholarship with theory and methodology in the humanities and social sciences to understand how local, lived experiences of people and communities are profoundly shaped by global media and communication technologies and industries. This synthesis of deep regional expertise and interdisciplinary inquiry stimulates critical conversations about entrenched and emerging communicative structures, practices, flows, and struggles.\n\nThe center explores new ways of understanding and explaining the world, including through public scholarship, the arts, multi-modal scholarship, and digital archives. With a core commitment to the development of early career scholars worldwide, CARGC hosts postdoctoral, doctoral, undergraduate, and faculty fellows who collaborate in research groups, produce peer-reviewed scholarship, contribute to CARGC’s Global Media & Communication Podcast, and organize talks, lectures, symposia, conferences, and summer institutes.\n\nOngoing research groups focus on media, migration, and diasporas; media environments and the climate crisis; media industries and cultural politics; and media history and theory. We recommend that applicants familiarize themselves with CARGC’s mission and research activities listed on our website. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in the following areas: environmental media/ecomedia, indigenous media cultures, Latin American and Latinx media, and global Blackness.\n\nFellowship Details: CARGC postdoctoral fellows work on their own research while also participating in and leading ongoing research projects within CARGC. During the fellowship, they present their work as part of a postdoctoral colloquium and work closely with the Senior Research Manager on a plan for publishing their research. There are limited opportunities for teaching that are decided in consultation with Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies.\n\nFellows will receive a minimum stipend of $65,000, commensurate with previous postdoctoral experience. CARGC will also provide a research fund of $3,000, individual health insurance and dependent coverage, a workspace, and a computer in CARGC’s office, and library access.

Please note all postdoctoral fellows must submit documentation to demonstrate eligibility to work in the United States. Non-US citizens selected for this position will be required to apply for an appropriate US visa.\n\nThis is a residential fellowship. CARGC strives to be an inclusive community of scholars driven by intellectual curiosity and exchange rooted in the life of the Annenberg School, the University of Pennsylvania, and the city of Philadelphia. To foster mentoring and collaboration at all levels, we expect fellows to be fully engaged in the life of the center. Postdocs are therefore expected to work at our beautiful sixth-floor premises on the Penn campus.\n\nEligibility: We welcome applications from early career scholars with Ph.D. awarded by an institution other than the University of Pennsylvania. The chosen applicant must have successfully defended their dissertation by the fellowship start date. The appointment typically begins on August 15.\n\nApplication consists of a cover letter; research statement (3 double-spaced pages max); CV (3 pages max); names and contact info for 3 references; one peer-reviewed publication (must be published or accepted and forthcoming).

The SNF Agora Academy seeks two fellows who would engage actively with and benefit from a multidisciplinary scholarly community that enables them to extend their research and public engagement in new directions, with the active mentorship of SNF Agora Institute faculty.\n\nThe fellows will contribute actively to the academic mission of institute. They will carry out their own research, participate in seminars, and be full members of the intellectual community. As part of their commitment to the institute, they are expected to participate actively in a research/practice project of the institute, reside in the Baltimore-DC area, and regularly engage in institute activities, including weekly Tuesday and Thursday seminars.\n\nOne of the central goals of the SNF Agora Institute is to foster conversations and collaboration that don't happen elsewhere. The fellows must have a strong academic record and be on a trajectory to contribute to key disciplinary conversations, but also be excited about being part of a community that is not simply made up of academics, whether that helps them integrate other perspectives into their scholarship, employs their scholarship to help strengthen democracy in tangible ways, or both. We strongly encourage applicants to think creatively about how their research interacts with scholars in other disciplines and efforts to strengthen democracy in the world and, thus, support the SNF Agora mission. Getting your work into the public domain is not the same as having impact. How do you hope to have impact? Are there civic and political entities, including movements, parties, governmental organizations, media, etc. that you could partner with? Do you have ideas that could contribute to public debates around democracy as well as academic ones? This work should be in addition to and not a replacement for a strong academic trajectory.\n\nCompensation\n\nFellows will be appointed initially for a one-year term, and will have the opportunity to extend their fellowship for a second academic year. They will receive a stipend of $70,000, health insurance, and a modest moving and research budget.\n\nThe fellowship start date is July 01, 2024.\n\nQualifications\n\nThe fellows must have a strong academic record and be on a trajectory to contribute to key disciplinary conversations, but also be excited about being part of a community that is not simply made up of academics, whether that helps them integrate other perspectives into their scholarship, employs their scholarship to help strengthen democracy in tangible ways, or both.\n\nSNF Agora is a multidisciplinary institution. For AY 2024-25, we will be accepting applications from sociologists and political scientists. In future years, we will cycle through other academic disciplines.\n\nApplicants to the 2024-25 program must have received a doctorate or equivalent terminal degree in May 2021 or later; applicants without a terminal degree must demonstrate that they will receive one by July 01, 2024.\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nVia Interfolio, please submit your CV, a short (250 word) personal statement explaining how your research agenda, skills, and background fit you to contribute to a multidisciplinary community of scholars and practitioners engaged with democracy; a research statement (maximum 2,500 words) explaining both your existing research and a detailed proposal for how you will spend your time at the Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute. Please make sure to explain both (a) in reference to broader themes of the institute's mission, and (b) in terms that will be accessible to everyone in a multidisciplinary community; and a writing sample (approximately 10,000 words), which can be either an article or an extract from a dissertation or longer work; and contact information for letters of recommendation.\n\nReview of applications will begin on November 15, 2023.\n\nLibrary Company of Philadelphia (USA:PA) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in American and Atlantic World History and Culture - Deadline: 6 Nov. 2023[]\n\nThe Library Company of Philadelphia invites applications for 2024–25 postdoctoral fellowships supporting advanced research in the collections of the Library Company and its Fellowships Program partner, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

For this postdoctoral position, we seek a candidate with a background in Computational Musicology, Digital Humanities, or related fields. The candidate should have programming experience working with systems and standards related to the encoding, presentation, and analysis of humanities data, preferably experienced with image and/or music data.\n\nThe Postdoctoral Researcher recruited for this position will primarily work on the first phase of the project, titled “Reconstructing the repertoire”. Fragmentary and damaged, a large portion of the music once copied the insular manuscripts from c. 1150 to c. 1350 is now incomplete, and most of it was omitted from the current scholarly editions. In addition to recovering the content on these damaged and incomplete fragments using techniques such as MSI, and digitally encoding every notational glyph, features of the manuscript layout, and the orthography of the underlaid texts including their punctuation, another primary activity of this first phase of the project will be to reconstruct the missing portions of the compositions. The primary output of this phase is an innovative ‘born-digital’ scholarly edition that will present interactive reconstructions of these works alongside the enhanced manuscript images for use by scholars and performers, providing an exemplar for future digital music editions, which integrates image, sound, encoding, and context. In addition, the data captured in this phase will inform the analysis of the third phase of the project (Years 4-5) that seeks to understand the relationship of notational systems and musical style to specific regions, repertoires, communities, and individuals. The postdoctoral researcher will have a budget p.a. for research travel related expenses.\n\nSalary\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher (LEVEL 1) 2023: €42,783 - €45,322 p.a.

For this postdoctoral position, we seek a candidate with a background in Medieval Musicology, Medieval Studies, or related fields to investigate the contexts, communities, and networks related to polyphonic singing in late medieval Britain and Ireland. The candidate should have experience with the study of medieval manuscripts, and expertise in studying either medieval music, medieval liturgy, and/or medieval historical archives, and have a strong knowledge of Latin, and the palaeography of late medieval scripts.\n\nThe Postdoctoral Researcher recruited for this position will primarily work on the second phase of the project, titled ‘Contexts, communities, and networks’, which explores the meaning of music writing with a focus on the question: who was using music writing, either to write down or read music, and why? This phase of the project focuses on the case study of Worcester Cathedral: Worcester makes a particularly valuable case study for the study of music writing and its meaning for communities due its rich potential for archival and prosopographical research, its extensive medieval library, and its collection of liturgical books and fragments. The postdoctoral researcher will have a budget p.a. for research travel related expenses. The postdoctoral researcher hired for this position will examine Worcester’s music from the perspective of its ‘written-ness’, using the evidence of its surviving music manuscripts and textual culture, what can be gleaned of its book production practices and knowledge networks from its library, and what can be learned of its day-to-day musical practices through a study of its community and liturgy.\n\nSalary\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher 2023 (LEVEL 1): €42,783 p.a. (1 point) with increment after 12 months of service.\n\nClosing Date: 23:30hrs (local Irish time) on Sunday, January 14, 2024.\n\nThe full text of the advertisement may be found on the vacancies page (search for subject 'Music'), and the application deadline is Jan 14, 2024. Please note there are two positions: one for digital humanities/digital musicology, and one for a medievalist/medieval musicologist.

During the term of appointment, the fellow will teach two courses in an appropriate department at the University of Pennsylvania. The remainder of the fellow’s time will be devoted to research and writing. While this fellowship is particularly appropriate for projects designed to turn a doctoral dissertation into a publishable monograph, any proposal falling within the Center’s area of interest will be considered.

The Barra Postdoctoral Fellow will receive a starting stipend of $65,000, health insurance, and modest funds for travel and research.\n\nMaterials - The following items must be prepared for uploading as pdf files:\n\nA curriculum vitae\n\nA proposal not to exceed 1,500 words, double-spaced, describing the general scope of the project and the specific work proposed during the fellowship term\n\nAn unpublished writing sample related to the project, double-spaced, limited to 7,500 words exclusive of notes\n\nTwo confidential letters of support should be uploaded separately by the letter writers.

The research and training plan of each fellowship must address important scientific questions within the scope of the SBE directorate and the specific guidelines in this solicitation. The SPRF program offers two tracks: (I) Fundamental Research in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-FR) and (II) Broadening Participation in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-BP). See the full text of the solicitation for a detailed description of these tracks.\n\n(10/30) applied\n\nThis is a long shot, but just curious if anyone has received this and knows around what time the award notifications are released? I haven't seen the NSF SPRF on this page for a few years back and I'm trying to gauge when to expect any sort of news.\n\n(3/14) It's my first time applying, but Section VI. B of the solicitation says: \"NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months.\" Recommended proposals are then forwarded for administrative review. If that part's anything like the NSF DDRI it's pretty quick. So... May? :/\n\n(1/19) same person as above, documenting the process for future applicants. NSF Program Officer emailed me and my proposed supervisor directly and informed me that there were some issues with the documents in the compliance review. Gave 5 days to make corrections and resubmit those specific documents. Unsure if this is standard procedure (i.e., do they do a compliance review for every SPRF applicant?)\n\n(3/14) I also received an email on 1/18 saying that my application had some issues in the compliance check and was giving until 1/24 to change them.\n\n(4/12) original poster here, thank you to the other person for the confirmation! This wait is pretty long. I have a feeling we really won't hear anything until May at this rate, though I wish they would notify sooner as this impacts plans for next year :/\n\n(4/23) I agree... It's an excruciatingly long waiting period. Lots of institutions in other disciplines, like math, have agreed to coordinate postdoc position announcements exactly for this reason. It'd be nice if other fields could follow suit...\n\n(4/23) out of curiosity, have you reached out to the program directors? I am going back and forth on doing so, at least to get an ETA....\n\n(4/24) I haven't... Truthfully, I accepted a position elsewhere. At this point, I'm mostly only invested because I put so much energy into the application materials!\n\n(5/30) Documenting this process for future applicants. June 2 will be the 7 month mark and we still have not received any updates for those offered an award (the program description says they strive to notify within 7 months). Based on a Reddit post on the PRFB and comments by people corresponding with their POs, the federal fiscal budget was approved quite late and the NSF still doesn't know what their funding is for particular programs. Within this post, someone from the SPRF heard from the PO who said \"NSF has not yet received its full budget for this fiscal year, so award notices are delayed. I will let you know that the initial declines already went out.\" The PO shared with the commenter information about the proposal category/ratings/funding priority category, and that \"we are unable to make award decisions without a final budget. This is a very odd funding cycle, and I typically would have more firm answers at this point.\"\n\n(6/7) Proposal recommended for funding\n\n(7/14) Proposal recommended for funding (I declined as I had already accepted another position)\n\nNorthumbria University (UK:Eng) - Senior Research Assistant in Humanities - VERY SHORT DEADLINE, posted 18 Dec: 31 Dec. 2023[]\n\nAbout the role\n\nWorking as part of multi-disciplinary team, you will support the Principal Investigator in delivery of research activity on the ESRC-funded project ‘A New Methodological Approach to the History of Divorce, 1857-1923’ by undertaking personal and collaborative research activity, contributing ideas, engaging in data entry and analysis, writing up research work for publication, and collaborating with project partners.\n\nThis role is fixed-term for 21 months and will start in Summer 2024.\n\nAbout the team\n\nThis Research Project is being delivered within the History subject group in the Department of Humanities, which also includes the subject areas of English Literature, English Language and Linguistics, Creative Writing, American Studies and Music.
