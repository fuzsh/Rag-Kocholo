        "text": "Barrett Loehrer – Lake Beauty Covenant Bible Camp, MN\n\nI found myself in a unique situation at the beginning of the summer. I needed to decide between working at camp for the summer, or maintaining my double major in biblical and theological studies and exercise science. After a couple months of painful prayer and discernment, I felt this summer at camp was one I could not miss. God continually pointed me forward to the summer at camp. I lived here for the 2014-2015 school year as part of Solid Rock School of Discipleship. However, I had never worked for Lake Beauty before.\n\nOur theme for the summer was “Set Free”, based upon the text of Galatians 5:1. Indeed, I personally felt set free in new ways, along with the rest of the summer staff. However, it was seeing kids set free in powerful ways that made the summer worth it. The campers were set free to vulnerably share their struggles with sin and difficult questions with one another, allowing even greater freedom through prayer together about such things.\n\nIt was impossible for us to predict how any camper, or which ones, would react to the preaching of the Gospel. It became apparent to me once again that I was not in control, though I sometimes wanted to be. This summer God reminded me that He is sovereign over everything and that everything, including our calling to salvation, is entirely dependent upon His mercy.\n\nHannah Geil – Cascades Camp and Conference Center, WA\n\nI have successfully worked at camp for three summers now. I vividly remember sitting on the corner of my bed in Anderson, watching one of my good friends apply to work at a camp that was only four hours away from my home. She shared stories of how exciting it would be to venture away and serve God in the middle of the wilderness. This gave me flashbacks to when I had attended that camp for small retreats and I relived the joy those gatherings brought me in high school.\n\nMy first year I worked as a counselor. This is a special role that can truly show you what it means to pour out everything for Jesus, loving your kids 23 hours a day for every day they’re in your cabin. My second year I worked as an S.A.L.T. Crew Leader. This meant my partner and I were assigned high school students who were transitioning from being campers to being leaders and guides in the cabins and around camp. It was a summer that revived my love of helping high school students and reminded me how good my God is.\n\nFinally, this summer I worked as a Rec. Leader for a 4th-6th grade section. The Program Leader and I kept the camp moving along. We were the support system for the counselors, ensuring that they and their campers made it through the day smoothly. I oversaw the planning and leading of all the games and activities for the kids, making camp as fun and exciting as possible for the kids. It was one of the most rewarding summers for me. I saw just how awesome God was using each counselor to teach these kids more about him. It was incredible to see counselors turn into screaming children full of face paint, engage kids with the Bible, or moved to tears as they said goodbye to campers each week. No matter how rough the cabin was or how exhausted the counselor was, they always wished they had more time to love on their kids.\n\nCHICAGO (September 13, 2017) — For the third summer in a row, a select group of North Park University undergraduate students took part in an intensive mentoring program, working alongside North Park professors while conducting in-depth research in their given academic fields.\n\nCalled the North Park Research Experience for Students (NPRESS), the program allows undergrads to receive the type of guidance and research opportunities typically available only in graduate programs.\n\nAs part of the eight-week program, funded by North Park donors, students receive a $3,500 stipend, $500 materials allowance and free on-campus housing while conducting research for their theses.\n\nBoth the student and faculty mentor explore ideas together during the application process and throughout the two months of hands-on research, said NPRESS Co-Director Dr. Rajkumar Boaz Johnson. “The program allows deeper learning between students and faculty.”\n\nTwelve students, all incoming sophomores, juniors or seniors, were selected for this summer’s program.\n\nOn Aug. 30, five of them presented their theses to NPRESS donors, alumni, and faculty at a dinner in the Helwig Boardroom.\n\nRepresenting majors from History and Global Studies, Exercise Science, Biomedical Sciences, Biology, and Economics, the students discussed their theses and answered questions from the audience. Through their rigorous research, students made connections on themes involving theology of lament and J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel Legendarium, exercise science and velocity data, interactive learning tools and host-pathogen interactions, genes and unicellular alga, and lure of perceptions versus evidence and fact on inventory and cash/financial performance.\n\nBusiness and Economics major Jomarie Perlas delved deep into making connections between perception of value and actual value in researching inventory.\n\n“Conducting market research and a survey helped to provide insight into inventory management, an area I’m interested in,” Perlas said.\n\nBiology major Haydee Ramirez said the relationship she formed with her mentor, Dr. Yoojin Choi, helped her prepare for her presentation.\n\n“Getting all the research condensed into 10 to 12 minutes that a general audience can understand was a challenge, but my mentor Dr. Choi was there to work with me,” Ramirez said.\n\nDr. Johnson developed the program to offer undergraduate students a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience that encompassed research, writing, and presenting.\n\nInspired by the program, participants like 2016 NPRESS participant Hannah Hawkinson, who studied feminist theology and social justice, is now pursuing a Master’s of Divinity degree at Princeton Theological Seminary.\n\nThe NPRESS Committee expressed their gratitude to the donors and the board for making the program possible and for providing North Park students with another avenue to connect academic interests with real-life experiences.\n\nAcceptance into NPRESS is based on an evaluation by North Park’s Undergraduate Research Committee (URC), which examines student merit, outcome, and commitment to 40 hours of research per week. The application deadline for Summer 2018 will be this spring, and applications are open to faculty and undergraduate students of all disciplines. Inquiries can be made with URC Chair Dr. Yoojin Choi .\n\nRead Presentations\n\nContrary to popular belief, Ragnar made his first voyage across the Atlantic with famous Viking, Leif Erikson. Since his brief stay in North America, Ragnar has since moved back to the north of Sweden. Because of North Park’s Swedish heritage, SGA decided to send out applications to Sweden when searching for a Mascot.\n\nWhether by word of mouth or Viking sail mail, word reached Ragnar, and he applied for the position. “It’s really great to know that we have a real Viking on our hands. We knew the search would be difficult, but Ragnar was prompt in his response. He’s youthful for his age,” commented former SGA President.\n\nOn condition of anonymity, Ragnar also added that he requested special transport by “aeroplane” as his previous journey across the Atlantic “was sickening.”\n\nRagnar has received a healthy amount of exposure on North Park social media since his move earlier this year as the SGA Spirit Team is ensuring that Ragnar remains in employment for years to come. “It’s nice to see that in his millennium, he is still able to rally the millennials and we can’t wait to see what he’ll do for the crowds this coming fall,” said Alex Coleman, Interim Director of Student Activities.\n\n*Facts may have been altered or fictionalized for the purposes of a funny story; live a little.\n\nDuring Dr. John Laukaitis’ research on North Park in the Second World War, he stumbled upon this artifact in the school’s archives. “I came across the World War II memorial plaque in the F.M. Johnson Archives and Special Collections last summer. Removed at some point and stored, the memorial plaque, heavily tarnished, showed its age,” said Dr. Laukaitis in an article he wrote to be published for the Covenant History Newsletter, used by his permission. This research and discovery of the plaque drove Dr. Laukaitis into writing a chapter in a book he is editing, Denominational Higher Education During World War II (Palgrave Macmillan).\n\n“I shared drafts of the chapter with colleagues and students, including student veteran Nico Canete,” said Dr. Laukaitis. Nicholas Canete, Class of 2018, is a student veteran, who served in the Navy, beginning his school career in 2015 after his enlistment contract expired. “Nine months before my arrival on campus, I was on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf as we were launching air strikes against ISIS every day. Suddenly, I was sitting in the comfort of a college classroom where the conversation was mostly theoretical,” Canete wrote for the same article. When he heard of the plaque, Canete jumped on the opportunity and spoke to interim President Carl Balsam to have the plaque restored and reinstalled.\n\nCanete also wrote about his transition from fighting ISIS on an aircraft carrier to sitting in a lecture hall, “what made that first year easier for me was the people at North Park. North Park’s community has welcomed me to the fullest extent of its hospitality. The reinstallation of the World War II memorial plaque is an example of this generosity. For my fellow student veteran friends and me on campus, some of whom have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, the plaque represents the University’s commitment to honoring and supporting those who have served.”\n\nDr. John Laukaitis and Nico Canete invite you to join with them and the North Park Community for a rededication on the 70th anniversary of the plaque’s initial instillation. The ceremony will be held at Isaacson Chapel at 6 pm on September 15 where each of the 45 fallen will be honored by name and any other information available.\n\nChoosing a college or university can be a tough decision and one that will dictate how the next years of your life will play out. College fairs are a great place to search for schools and ask admissions counselors tough questions about their institutions. Because of the limited amount of time, and the fact that there are probably hundreds of other students looking to talk to the same counselor, here are a few questions that’ll get the most useful information out of your few minutes of conversation.\n\nWhat’s the student-to-faculty ratio?\n\nBy asking this question, you already learn a few key things about the school. The first being the amount of time and dedication your professors will have to enhance and further your learning experience; the smaller the ratio, the more hands-on you will be with your faculty. Additionally, it shows you the value the University places on your relationship with your professors.\n\nHow new are the facilities?\n\nAsk this question and you’ll be able to gauge the school’s budget and the amount they’re willing to invest into your education.\n\nWhat is the culture like?\n\nFrom here, you’ll be able to find out what type of extracurricular activities are available and the amount of value placed on life experience outside of rigorous academics. You should also be able to find out what the best living option is, on or off campus, as well as get an understanding of the surrounding city or area.\n\nWhat are the most popular majors/programs?\n\nFinding out what the school specializes in, or what is most popular, can give you an idea of what life will be like at the school and later on in your job search. This can also be what makes the school special, why it’s unique, and why you might be likely to attend.\n\nWhat is (insert interest or favorite pastime here) like?\n\nWe all have that one thing that we love: sports, reading, gaming, or political or religious discussion and debate. Ask the admissions counselor how your interests or favorite pastimes are addressed at their school, and weigh it against others to see if it’s a good fit for you.\n\nRemember, most colleges and universities will have things like financial aid, tuition and fees, residential buildings, and other empirical information easily accessible on their websites. Use the time with the admissions counselors to make that personal connection with the school which can’t be found on their website.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nChoosing a major is not something to take lightly. Knowing exactly what you want to do after graduation and the kind of direction that gives is important and helpful. What if you don’t have this same sense of direction? Don’t worry, colleges around the country have students entering with undecided majors. However, North Park’s commitment to preparing you for a life of significance and service offers you many people and steps to follow so that you can find the perfect degree to make a difference.\n\nCareer and Development Office.\n\nTo get you started, our Career Development and Internships Office (CDIO) has many resources to help you choose the right major to fast-track you through North Park’s rigorous academic programs. They have everything from career counseling to a Career Planning Course for those who want to explore potential careers. Anyone in the CDIO office would also love to chat with you and answer any questions you have concerning your potential career.\n\nTalk to your faculty advisor!\n\nAll North Park students are assigned a faculty advisor regardless of their major declaration status. Your advisors have also been through college, some of them were probably undecided at one point as well, or saw their life going in a different direction; they’ve experienced what you have. This is part of what makes student-faculty relationships so great; they are ready and available to answer any of your questions, or just to offer a listening ear.\n\nStop a student on campus.\n\nEither during your visit or after you’ve enrolled in classes, you’ll find many current students on the green spaces around campus. Being a small university, the student body is tight-knit, open, and friendly. Chat with an upper-class student about how they chose their major."
