        "text": "This text offers 6th - 12th grade educators guided instructional approaches for including young adult (YA) literature in science and math classes in order to promote literacy development while learning content. Chapters are co-authored, pairing content experts with literacy experts, to ensure that both content and literacy standards are met in each approach. Each chapter spotlights the reading of one YA novel, and offer pre-, during-, and after reading activities that guide students to a deeper understanding of the content while increasing their literacy practices. While each chapter focuses on a specific content topic, readers will discover the many opportunities reading YA literature in the content area has in encouraging cross-disciplinary study.\n\nRowman & Littlefield Publishers\n\nPages: 202  Trim: 6½ x 9½\n\n978-1-4758-3167-2 • Hardback • August 2017 • $78.00 • (£60.00)\n\n978-1-4758-3168-9 • Paperback • August 2017 • $40.00 • (£30.00)\n\n978-1-4758-3169-6 • eBook • August 2017 • $38.00 • (£30.00)\n\nPaula Greathouse is an assistant professor of secondary English Education at Tennessee Tech.
