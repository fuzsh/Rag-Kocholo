Much like writing in a journal or composing a letter home, for these veterans, the act of creating art provided a way to capture, articulate, and process what they saw and felt during their service. Whether they used pen, ink, or a camera, the resulting artwork offers a vivid and evocative statement on their individual experience and perspective of war. In all of these collections, the artwork speaks volumes, proving that a picture is indeed worth a thousand words.\n\nView the blog post related to this online presentation."
