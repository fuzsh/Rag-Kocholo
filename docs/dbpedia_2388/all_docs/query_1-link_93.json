Our electric\n\ncompany has determined that the horsepower\n\ngenerated by human muscle is\n\nworth 4¢ per hour.\n\nObviously man is not worth much as\n\nchemicals or kilowatts. His distinctive\n\nvalue is due to his brain ••• the ability\n\nto store knowledge which can be utilized\n\nto think, to reason and to make\n\ndecisions which guide his actions .\n\nFortunately, man can improve his worth.\n\nAs a comparison we can use the example of\n\na plain bar of iron worth about $5.00.\n\nThis same bar of iron made into horseshoes\n\nis worth $10.50. If made into\n\nneedles, it becomes worth $3285.00, and\n\nif turned into balance springs for\n\nwatches, it attains a worth of\n\n$250,000.00.\n\nSimilarly, a man's value can be\n\nincreased and his ultimate value is\n\ndetermined by what he makes of himself.\n\nHarold A. Henneman\n\nShort Course Director\n\nSTUDENT GOVERNMENT ;· .I\n\n.:.1\n\nSome people thirtk1 of the Short Course\n\nCouncil only as a government for Short\n\nCourse men. In my ~ork, as president\n\nof the Council, t find the Council\n\nfunctions as a service to the students\n\nby arranging activities they could not\n\notherwise take part ~ri because of their\n\nshort stay on cantpus. The activities\n\nare varied. Tertrt p~rties, banquets,\n\nfilms, pamphlets, newspapers, magazines,\n\nreference books, used book resales, and\n\nintramural olympic nights are but a few\n\nof the Council's setvices.\n\nIn all-Hall activities we work\n\nclosely with the four-year students\n\n(usually leading the way) on such\n\nprojects as the paper drive and\n\nChristmas party for underprivileged\n\nchildren, and we al~ays lead the campus\n\nin the blood drive. Together with the\n\nother Short Course students we produce\n\nthis Spartan Shorty to let you know\n\nwhat we have done in Short Courses this\n\nyear and what you c~n .look forward to\n\nin the future. .\n\nThe Short Course men have made\n\ntremendous advancements in schoolwork,\n\nextra curricular activities, and\n\ncooperation among the Armstrong Hall\n\nresidents; and t hope future students\n\nwill continue to do as well. I am\n\nsure that you will.\n\nBob Cline\n\nCouncil President\n\nSanta at the fall term banquet.\n\nGilchirst Square Dance\n\nSOCIAL\n\nThe Short Course Council sponsored two\n\nsquare dances this year, one with Mary\n\nNayo Rall and the other with Gilchrist\n\nHall. Numerous exchange dinners, card\n\nparties, pizza parties, open houses, and\n\nfloor parties keep the social register\n\nbalanced with the academic programs.\n\nJerry Ayer\n\nTOP STUDENT LEADERS\n\nOutstanding students are selected\n\nannually by the students of each Short\n\nCourse program. Those selected for the\n\n1964-65 year were as follows: Young\n\nFarmer, Kenneth Bohn; Elevator and Farm\n\nSupply, Paul Darby Graves; Farm\n\nEquipment Sales and Service, John Petru;\n\nNursery and Landscaping, Eugene Woodruff;\n\nand Floriculture, Tommy Reynolds.\n\nAlumni of these programs and industry\n\nassociations honor these young men with\n\nmementoes of their excellent scholarship\n\nand demonstrated leadership abilities.\n\nTwo special awards were made at the\n\nYoung Farmer Graduation Banquet on\n\nMarch 5. Classmates of Bob Cline and\n\nJerry Ayer felt that the service and\n\nleadership efforts of these young men\n\nshould be acknowledged. They were given\n\na presentation by Duane L. Anderson,\n\nShort Course student advisor.\n\nSPORTS\n\nShort Course students were active in\n\nall sport events again this year.\n\nWe had nine football teams last fall.\n\nAfter many practice sessions and six\n\ntough games, the Elevator II team came\n\nout on the top of the Short Course\n\nleague.\n\nImmediately after winter term registration,\n\nbasketball teams were\n\norganized and began practice sessions.\n\nThe teams were well balanced and most\n\nof the scores were close. Win or lose,\n\nthese experiences give us pleasant\n\nmemories of our college days.\n\nIn addition to the team sports, there\n\nare many individual sports, such as\n\nswinnning, handball, ping pong, paddleball,\n\nand others.\n\nThe first term \"Olympics\" were won by\n\nthe third floor \"House of Ares\". The\n\ncompetition among the three floors was\n\ngreat, and the scores were close\n\nbetween first and third floor.\n\nLarry Misenhelder\n\nKen Bohn at Little International\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nThe Activities Connnittee is always\n\nbusy doing something. We have a\n\ncouple of very important events, such\n\nas the term end banquets. At these\n\nbanquets we have a lot of fun with our\n\ntalent, and we even have a Santa.\n\nSome of our other duties are helping\n\nthe social chairman and supervising\n\nCareer Info at Farmer's Week Booth\n\ndinner meetings with some very interesting\n\nspeakers. We also edit the\n\nSpartan Shorty. We hope this Shorty\n\nwill help new students get acquainted\n\nwith the Short Course programs and help\n\nthe students living remember all of the\n\ngood times that we had at Michigan State\n\nUniversity.\n\nKennis Friess\n\nSCHOIARSHIP\n\nThe students at Short Course must\n\nattain a satisfactory gradepoint\n\naverage during their stay at Michigan\n\nState University.\n\nOur hope and our aim is to receive\n\nas much knowledge about modern and\n\ncomplex farming as possible. We have\n\ncountless instructors who are willing to\n\nhelp us with our problems. This means a\n\ngreat deal, especially when you first\n\ncome to M.s.u. This close relationship\n\nhelps to create an attitude of cooperation\n\namong students and instructors.\n\nShort Course students have a library\n\nin their dorm. It contains farm related\n\npamphlets and magazines and some of the\n\nmore popular general magazines. Films\n\nare shown weekly and bulletin boards on\n\neach floor contain a vast array of\n\ninformation. Each floor has a scholastic\n\nchairman who has the responsibility of\n\nkeeping the test file in order and offering\n\nother students help with classwork\n\nproblems.\n\nThe epitome of concentration\n\nOur grades reflect our character, and\n\nour character in turn determines our\n\nstatus in life. Someday we hope to\n\nbecome leaders in our communities. We\n\nhave laid the foundation right here at\n\nShort Course. This is an exciting,\n\nnew, and different facet of our lives.\n\nIt is an experience we will r emember\n\nfor the rest of our lives.\n\nMichael Block\n\nCLASSES\n\nShort Courses at Michigan State\n\nUniversity offer a wide range of\n\ncourses. A few of the main courses are\n\nthe follm·1ing: agricul tu.ral economics,\n\nagricultural engineering, animal\n\nhusbandry, farm crops , horticulture,\n\nand soil science. Other courses related\n\nto farming are farm law, dealing\n\nArmstrong and Short Course out-gathered\n\nthe whole campus in underprivileged\n\nchildren paper drive.\n\nwith farm leases, mortgages and rights of\n\nfarmers; leadership; speech, which helps\n\nyou become a better u.~mber of the connnuni\n\nty by participating in community organizations;\n\nfamily living, which helps you\n\nwith your problems today and some that\n\nmay come up in the future; and important\n\nimprovement courses in reading and\n\narithmetic. Reading is designed to help\n\nyou improve your reading habits and\n\nbecome a more efficient reader.\n\nStudents in the Short Course live in\n\nthe dormitories and have access to all\n\nof the facilities that four-year students\n\nhave.\n\nIf you want this great opportunity, it\n\nis yours at Michigan State University.\n\nRon Mick.\n\nNothing like a good stretch.\n\nJUDGING TEAM\n\nThe Canadian Winter Royal Fair was\n\nheld in Toronto the second week of\n\nNovember. This was the second year the\n\nShort Course was invited to attend and\n\ncompete with three Canadian Short Course\n\nteams. Ken Bohn, Ken Friess, John Moore,\n\nand Nelson Francisco were picked from\n\nthe top seven students in Animal\n\nHusbandry and attended the Fair as a\n\nteam.\n\nThe team judged M.s.u. and area farm\n\nstock for only two weeks before the\n\nshow and yet represented us well in the\n\ncompetitions. The judging practice,\n\nobservation of farms, and interviews\n\nwith owners will all be useful information\n\nto us in future years.\n\nMr. Donald Shepard, assistant director\n\nof Short Courses, and Ray Kliewer, dairy\n\ninstructor, were the two main sources of\n\nour advisory knowledge.\n\nJudging at the Canadian Royal included\n\nten classes of animals: dairy, beef,\n\nswine sheep, and swine carcasses. The\n\nteam placed fourth, but the experiences\n\nwe gained from Canadian methods, quality\n\nof livestock, and the friendliness of\n\nthe Canadian people certainly were\n\nrewarding.\n\nThe team members and the department\n\nwish to thank the Alumni Association for\n\nsponsoring the trip. We enjoyed it\n\nfully and hope future teams will derive\n\nthe same benefit.\n\nNelson Francisco\n\nLivestock Judging Team\n\nFrom left to right: E. Aberle,\n\ninstructor, K. Brown, K.

The first thing you smell is\n\nthe invigorating aroma from the sewage\n\nplant--that really wakes you up. Then\n\nyou wash your face in cold water to get\n\nyour mind working, brush your teeth,\n\nand get dressed.\n\nNow it is time to go over to Brody to\n\nget something to eat for breakfast.\n\nWith a little bit of food in our\n\nIt's a long way over to Anthony.\n\nstomachs, we start out for our 8 a.m.\n\nclass across campus. ·we never make it\n\nvery early but just in time to hear our\n\nnames called and to answer, \"here.\"\n\nAt noon we are hungry from walking\n\nfrom class to class, so we either hurry\n\nto Brody or get a meal transfer and eat\n\nat Shaw, whichever is closer to our\n\nnext class.\n\nAs soon as our afternoon classes are\n\nover, we walk back to the dorm and get\n\nready for the evening meal. Dinner is\n\nusually enjoyed in a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThe tests are over for the day; and we\n\neat with a few girls' halls, which seems\n\nto set the day off just right.\n\nOf course, the R. A. helps make your\n\nbed.\n\nAfter dinner we return to our rooms\n\nand talk over the day with our roommates.\n\nLater, we think about studying.\n\nSomething usually interferes, but we\n\nfinally get to it. In the middle of\n\nstudying we take a study break to call a\n\nfew girls. Then it is off to bed to\n\ndream of the good old days when all we\n\nhad to do was work, work, work, with\n\nonly a little think, think, think.\n\nBob Oeschger\n\nStudying Laws of Probability\n\nTHE BREEZE\n\nThis year the Short Course \"Breeze\"\n\nhas seen many editors. The year began\n\nwith Fred Currier. His brilliant\n\nefforts are still in use, along with\n\nall of our most brilliant efforts.\n\nWe are featuring a teacher of the\n\nweek series. The Short Course students\n\nvote each week for the two teachers they\n\nlike best. Someone then writes an\n\narticle on the teachers' interests and\n\npersonal life. We also feature a Dear\n\nAbby column, which gives us a chance to\n\ncomplain to someone about our problems\n\nand hope for a solution.\n\nThe \"Breeze\" provides an ample opportunity\n\nfor the students to voice their\n\nopinions and beliefs. Mr. Anderson's\n\nLeadership class provides articles on\n\nvarious subjects of interest. We try\n\nto include a few jokes and hope to have\n\ninteresting reading material for the\n\nShort Course students.\n\nMaurice Low\n\nArt Kreutzman\n\nDon Shepard\n\nAssistant Short Course Director\n\nYOUNG FARMER SHORT COURSE\n\nThe objective of the Young Farmer\n\nShort Course is to provide an opportunity\n\nfor beginning farmers to gain\n\nadditional knowledge which will increase\n\nthe likelihood of farming success.\n\nSince its beginning in 1894, around\n\nnine thousand Short Course Alumni have\n\nreturned to their home connnunities to\n\nbecome successful farmers and connnunity\n\nleaders.\n\nThe course is offered in the late fall\n\nand winter months as most of the participants\n\nare actively engaged in farming\n\nduring the busy season on the farm.\n\nThe student may elect the majority of\n\nhis subjects. He can specialize in\n\ndairy, livestock, cash crops, poultry,\n\nfruit or vegetable farming. In addition,\n\nall students take soils, engineering,\n\nconnnunications, and management subjects.\n\nThe experience of living away from\n\nhome, making friends with young men from\n\nthroughout Michigan, participating in\n\nextracurricular activities and becoming\n\nfamiliar with agricultural research and\n\nextension personnel at Michigan State\n\nUniversity are all factors which\n\ncontribute to a Short Course student's\n\neducation.\n\nYOUNG FARNER GRADUATES - CAULKINS SCHOLARSHIP\n\nFront row, left to right: Kenneth Vogel, Ronald Mick, Robert Cline, Knowlton Brown,\n\nRonald Wolfin, Robert Becker, David Sting, Richard Samson.

At\n\nthe present time, the demand is far in\n\nexcess of the available supply of young\n\nfarmers to fill these positions. Short\n\nCourse graduates with two to four years\n\nof faim experience, who are married, and\n\nwith the military service completed are\n\nin very strong demand. There are many\n\nalumni of the Michigan State Short Course\n\nprogram in very responsible positions as\n\nmanagers, herdsmen, and farm operators\n\nthroughout Michigan and adjoining states.\n\nThe modern successful young farmer is\n\na highly skilled operator. Farmers and\n\nfarm workers handle many expensive pieces\n\nof equipment, deal with complicated\n\nfeeds, hybrid seeds, high analysis\n\nfertilizers and valuable livestock. To\n\nmake a success, the young farmer needs a\n\ngreat deal of technical skill and knowledge.\n\nThat young man who is really\n\ninterested in farming, who is willing to\n\nwork, and who is skilled will always find\n\nemployment opportunities.\n\nI\n\nDistinguished s. c. alumni and wives\n\nALUMNI\n\nGraduates of the Young Farmer Short\n\nCourse program are automatically members\n\nof the Alumni Association. The Alumni\n\nAssociation does a great deal to promote\n\nthe Short Course program and is active in\n\nother ways. Two meetings are held on\n\ncampus each year. At the fall meeting\n\nDrs. Henneman, Swenson, Tenny, and Freeh\n\nthere is a luncheon, and we purchase a\n\nblock of tickets for the Homecoming Day\n\nfootball game. The annual meeting during\n\nFarmers' Week consists of a reception and\n\nbanquet. Each year distinguished alumni\n\nare honored.\n\nThe four honored this year were the\n\nfollowing: Walter E. Frahm, Frankenmuth\n\n(1948); Charles Gray, Merritt (1913); Dave\n\nMorris, Grand Ledge (1948); and Robert\n\nZeeb, Bath (1953).\n\nWalter Frahm is in partnership with\n\nhis brother, but the brothers own\n\nseparate farms. Together they own 90\n\nhead of good purebred Guernseys and\n\noperate a total of 360 acres. Their cash\n\ncrops consist of sugar beets, beans, and\n\nwheat. Walt is active in the County and\n\nState Farm Bureaus and in the State\n\nGuernsey Breeders Association as a member\n\nof the Board of Directors. He has\n\nserved in the Saginaw Presbyterian\n\nChurch as an officer and is president\n\nof his local school board. Mr. and Mrs.\n\nFrahm have five children.\n\nCharles Gray owns a 2000-acre ranch in\n\nthe Lake City - Merritt area. He runs\n\nsome 500 head of breeding ewes and about\n\n1000 head of cattle annually. Charles\n\nGray is known and respected throughout\n\nnorthern Michigan. He operated the\n\nlivestock sale at Alpena. He has been\n\na member of the local school board for\n\nmany years, was a township trustee and\n\nserved on a county advisory council for\n\nthe Extension Service.\n\nDave Morris operates 470 acres of which\n\nsome 120 are rented. This farm is\n\nmostly tillable and is nearly all in\n\ncorn and wheat. He feeds about 800\n\ncattle annually. He does most of the\n\nwork with the help of one full time and\n\nsome part-time help. In addition, he\n\nfinds time for many community activities.\n\nDave is very active in the Grand Ledge\n\nMethodist Church, at present being\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees. He\n\nis active in both county and state Farm\n\nBureau activities and is a member of\n\nthe Board of Directors of both groups.\n\nRobert Zeeb operates in a partnership\n\nwith his parents and uncle. Tilis is a\n\nmodern dairy farm of 440 acres. Tile\n\ndairy herd consists of approximately\n\n100 cows plus about 80 heifers and\n\ncalves. Bob was selected last year by\n\nthe Michigan Junior Chamber of Connnerce\n\nas the outstanding young farmer. He\n\nalso finds time to participate in the\n\naffairs of the D.H.I.A. and Farm\n\nBureau and is a member of the County\n\n4-H Club Council. Mr. and Mrs. Zeeb\n\nhave a family of three boys and a\n\ngirl.\n\nOther activities of the Association\n\ninclude publishing a newsletter quarterly,\n\nwhich is mailed to those who\n\ndesire to keep in touch with the\n\nUniversity and the alumni. Each year\n\nthe Association honors an outstanding\n\nstudent in the Young Farmer program.\n\nTile student selected this year was\n\nKenneth Bohn of Galien in Berrien\n\nCounty. His name has been added to the\n\nAlumni Award plaque on display in the\n\nShort Course office.\n\nTile Association also sponsors the\n\nlivestock judging team which has\n\nparticipated in the Royal Winter Fair\n\nin Toronto the last two years.\n\nOfficers of the Association are\n\nPresident, Victor Ball, 'S6 of Albion;\n\nVice-President, Walter Hunt, Jr., 'S7\n\nof Lake City; Secretary-Treasurer,\n\nDonald Shepard, East Lansing; Directors:\n\nCarl Schoonover, 'SS of Stockbridge;\n\nCarl Quackenbush, '60 of Burt; James\n\nSchwass, '49 of Scottville; Dick Stasa,\n\n'63 of Owosso; Marvin Lott, '49 of\n\nMason; and Roland Russell, '40 of\n\nAdrian.\n\nDonald H. Shepard, Secretary\n\nAlumni Association\n\nLITTLE INTERNATIONAL\n\nTilis event is put on by the Block and\n\nBridle Club. It is a contest on fitting\n\nand showing of livestock. Michigan\n\nState University makes this show possible\n\nby letting the club use their high\n\nquality livestock.\n\nTile show was held this year on\n\nJanuary 16. It included the following\n\nclasses of animals: Shorthorn,\n\nHerefords, Angus, ~.arket Lambs, Breeding\n\nSheep, Yorkshire Swine, Hampshire Swine,\n\nArabian Horses, and Quarter Horses.\n\nAll students interested in taking part\n\nin this contest are welcome. It is a\n\ngood experience and a way of meeting\n\nsome new friends.\n\nRobert Becker\n\n\\\n\nChoice gals for Little International\n\nFARMERS 1 WEEK\n\nThis year Michigan State University\n\ncelebrated the Golden Anniversary of\n\nFarmers' Week. The theme this year\n\nwas irFrom the Progressive Past to a\n\nForward Looking Future.\"\n\nFarmers come from all over the state\n\nto a-ttend meetings, discussions, and to\n\nsee exhibits of new things in agriculture.\n\nTile meetings cover a wide variety of\n\nsubjects, from home economics to soil\n\nscience. Not only will the farmer\n\nbenefit from Farmers' Week, but also his\n\nwife. For the homemaker there are\n\nmeetings on latest fashions, preparation\n\nof food, and many home-related topics.\n\nThis year there were exhibits on\n\nfifty years of farm mechanization,\n\nwhich was of special interesto\n\nPresident Hannah drew many people to\n\nthe University Auditorium to hear him\n\nspeak on \"Agriculture at M.s.u. in the\n\nNext Half Century.\"\n\nThe Short Course Department paid\n\nspecial honor to a group of graduates\n\nwho were in the program before 1915.\n\nCertificates of distinguished service\n\nto agriculture were awarded at the\n\nAlumni Banquet. Short Course students\n\ntake full advantage of the meetings and\n\nexhibits in their out-of-class time.\n\nAnyone who has never attended\n\nFarmers' Week has certainly missed a\n\nrare opportunity to mingle with his\n\nfellow farmers and to learn the latest\n\ndevelopments in the field of agriculture.\n\nKenneth Mahar\n\nLIBRARIES AND FIUfS\n\nShort Course students have access to\n\ntheir own library. Many pamphlets and\n\nmagazines of special interest to Short\n\nCourse students have been gathered\n\nthrough the efforts of the Short Course\n\nCouncil, the College Bulletin Office,\n\nand generous farm organizations. Much\n\nof the material covered in the magazines\n\nand bulletins is of special interest to\n\nyoung farmers.\n\nIn addition to the Short Course\n\nlibrary, students have access to the\n\nArmstrong Hall library. This library\n\nhas a good selection of reference books\n\nas well as many other books of general\n\ninterest. Also, Short Course students\n\nmay use the large facilities of the\n\nMichigan State University Library.\n\nA film is shm·m every Thursday night\n\nat 7:30 in A-3 study room. These films\n\nare both entertaining and informative,\n\nand they allow students to get together\n\nfor talk and a break from studying.\n\nLeonard Goodell\n\nNEW COURSE\n\nA new 18-month training program for\n\n\"Soil Technicians\" will start Fall term\n\n1965. This program will train young men\n\nfor work in the soil and fertilizer\n\nindustry. The course will consist of\n\n4 terms at M.s.u., plus 6 months on-thejob\n\ntraining in the fertilizer industry.\n\nMrs. Lundberg and Jerry .at Gilchrist\n\nPROMENADERS\n\nIf you want to have fun and meet a\n\nnice group of people, you should try\n\nsquare dancing. The Promenaders are a\n\ncampus-wide square dance group. They\n\nenjoy square dancing and are willing to\n\nteach anyone how much fun it can be.\n\nThey meet each Wednesday night in the\n\nWomen's Intramural Building from 7 to\n\n8:15. Visitors are encouraged; and, if\n\nyou wish to join, you are welcome to do\n\nso.\n\nRobert Becker\n\nBOOK RESALE\n\nThe Short Course has a book sale each\n\nfall just after school starts. These\n\nare all used books that are left by\n\nstudents from the preceding year. The\n\nstudent marks the price that he wants\n\nfor the book inside the front cover,\n\nthen leaves it in Room 201 Armstrong\n\nuntil the next fall. There is no\n\ncharge for selling these books. The\n\nsale is conducted by the Short Course\n\nCouncil, and after the sale, the money\n\nis sent to the student who left the\n\nbooks to be sold. This allows the new\n\nstudents to buy used books at a somewhat\n\nreduced rate and increases the resale\n\nvalue to the original mvner.\n\nDan Russell\n\nPART-TIME EMPLOYMENT\n\nThe Student Employment Service of the\n\nPlacement Bureau maintains a service for\n\nthe students who are interested in parttime\n\nemployment. The service covers all\n\nareas of student employment on and off\n\nthe campus. First term freshmen are\n\nurged not to work until they feel thoroughly\n\n\"at home\" with University life.\n\nA student employed by the University may\n\nwork a maximum of 20 hours per week\n\nunless granted special permission for\n\nlonger hours by the college in which he\n\nis enrolled.\n\nThere are various types of jobs on\n\ncampus available, on the farms and in\n\nthe dining halls. If you like to work\n\nclose, Brody cafeteria offers everything\n\nfrom a busboy to a ticket puncher.\n\nIf you can handle your studies and pick\n\nup some spending money, a part-time job\n\noffers something different and acquaints\n\nyou with many interesting people and\n\npersonalities. Leonard Goodell\n\nFOREIGN STUDENTS\n\nSeveral Short Course students come\n\nfrom foreign countries. They hope to\n\ntake some of the knowledge gained in\n\nShort Courses back to their countries to\n\napply to their farms. This year students\n\nfrom Nigeria, Malawi, Colombia, Peru,\n\nVenezuela, Jamaica, Canada, and Ecuador\n\nhave enrolled in Short Course. Many of\n\nthem plan on going into L;-H work in\n\ntheir own country.\n\nForeign students add much to Short\n\nCourse. It is always interesting to\n\nlearn about their countries and ways of\n\nlife and their impressions of our country\n\nand way of life. Their presence helps\n\nus to broaden our vision of the world\n\nin which we live. Leonard Goodell\n\nBLOCK AND BRIDLE CLUB\n\nThere are seven Short Course students\n\nwho are regular members of the Block and\n\nBridle and many who participate in special\n\nevents. The club sponsors the fall and\n\nspring judging contests, the Spring Horse\n\nShow, the Little International Livestock\n\nShow, and many other student activities\n\nthroughout the year.\n\nAnyone interested in livestock and\n\nworking with animals may become a\n\nmember of the Block and Bridle Club,\n\nthe largest organization on campus.\n\nKen Bohn\n\nLeaders of Tomorrow?\n\nFUTURE FARNERS OF AHERICA\n\nThe Future Farmers of America, better\n\nknown as the FFA, has been acknowledged\n\nand respected as one of the leading\n\nyouth groups for boys seeking futures in\n\nagriculture since its foundation in 1928.\n\nThe FFA has expanded from the 18 state\n\nassociations represented at the first\n\nnational convention in Kansas City in\n\n1928 to the ten thousand chapters representing\n\nsome !+01, b.-68 members from 50\n\nstate associations in 1964.\n\nThe FFA's purpose does not end at\n\nestablishing a boy in some phase of\n\nagriculture. It also aims to develop\n\nhim into a leader in his community and\n\ncountry and to build his personal\n\ncharacter.\n\nMichigan State University is furthering\n\nthe education of many present\n\nand past members of the FFA. This\n\nincludes State Farmers, American Farmers,\n\nand present and past state officers.\n\nThis year we have 9 of our 13 state\n\nofficers on campus. Five of the nine\n\nare in the General Agriculture Short\n\nCourse. We also have three of last\n\nyear's state officers with us in Short\n\nCourse.\n\nLooking at the achievements of our\n\nmembers, we can proudly say that we\n\npractice and believe in our motto:\n\nLearning to Do - Doing to Learn -\n\nEarning to Live - Living to Serve.\n\nDaniel J.

This is the\n\nlargest enrollment in several years.\n\nThirty students. were just starting the\n\nprogram and 17 were returning for their\n\nsecond year of class work. These second\n\nyear students will graduate in March,\n\n1965.\n\nThe second year Elevator boys won the\n\nintramural football championship with an\n\nundefeated season. They also had an\n\nimpressive record in basketball.\n\nOur congratulations go to Darby Graves\n\nfrom Gruver, Iowa. Darby received the\n\nOutstanding Student Award presented by\n\nthe Michigan Feed and Grain Dealers\n\nAssociation. The Feed and Grain\n\nindustry continues to support our\n\nprogram in many ways. They supplied\n\nscholarships to 22 Elevator students\n\ntotaling over $4000.00 during the 1 64-'65\n\nschool year. The industry also\n\nfurnishes jobs for the graduates and\n\nfor students on placement training. At\n\nthis writing most of the students (both\n\n1st and 2nd year) have jobs lined up.\n\nEducation is most important in today's\n\nAgricultural Business world. The fact\n\nthat young men have completed the\n\nElevator and Farm Supply Short Course\n\nwill open doors for them. However, it\n\nwill not prop those doors open. Where\n\nyou go from here will depend on you -your\n\nattitude -- your ambition. Good\n\nLuck!\n\nHarold J.

The four terms\n\nof campus training include courses in\n\nnursery business management, plant\n\npropagation, landscape design, salesmanship,\n\nas well as a variety of courses\n\ndealing with the culture of plants used\n\nin landscape plantings.\n\nDuring the 6-month placement training\n\nperiods students work in the type of\n\nnursery they find most interesting.\n\nExperiences this last year ranged from\n\nusing a mechanical digging machine for\n\nlarge trees and moving trees weighing\n\nup to six ton, to designing and selling\n\nlandscape plans in a garden center.\n\nThis year's activities included\n\npractical experience in maintaining\n\nthe Horticulture Gardens on campus as\n\nwell as field trips to nearby nurseries\n\nand the Lansing weather station.\n\nFebruary ll was the day for a trip to\n\nGrand Rapids and the Michigan Association\n\nof Nurserymen's annual convention. The\n\nclass had an exhibit which initiated the\n\nGrand and Glorious order of the \"Green\n\nThumb\". This is a group of nurserymen\n\nthat have supported scholarships of\n\nNursery and Landscape students. They\n\nwere guests of the association and\n\nenjoyed meeting former students and\n\nnurserymen. They also had the opportunity\n\nto talk to nurserymen about their\n\nplacement training opportunities. Mr.\n\nEugene Woodruff received the Outstanding\n\nStudent Award presented annually by the\n\nM.A.N. at the annual convention.\n\nRoy A.

It is\n\nalways a pleasure to welcome new students\n\nto the campus, and especially this year\n\nwhen we are introducing a revised and\n\nrevitalized program of course work. This\n\nyear we are using a program of courses\n\noffered outside our own department; and\n\nalthough it added only two new courses,\n\nit completed the offerings in the business\n\narea. The demand for retail\n\ncourses has increased, and two special\n\ntopics courses in floriculture retailing\n\nwere added to the curriculum.\n\nThis revitalized curriculum would have\n\nbeen more difficult to achieve without\n\nthe aid of a grant from Florists Telegraph\n\nDelivery Association, the largest\n\nof the \"Flower-by-Wire\" organizations.\n\nThe grant has made possible the use of\n\nnon-university associated consultants, an\n\nincrease in use of flowers and florist\n\nsupplies, and a broadening of the general\n\narea in which students take their placement\n\ntraining. We are much appreciative of\n\nthis indication of interest by the\n\nindustry in education.\n\nFinally, we should comment on our\n\ncurrent class of students. Their origin\n\ncovers a large geographical area, including\n\nthe states of Michigan, Illinois,\n\nOhio, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\n\nand the Dominion of Canada. This fact\n\nindicates that our program is well known\n\nover a large area, and that we have an\n\nunusually diverse group of students with\n\nwhich to work. Life here at the University\n\nshould be interesting for the instructors\n\nduring the remainder of the\n\nacademic year, and we look forward to our\n\nassociation with these students during\n\nthe coming years in the floriculture\n\nindustry.\n\nHarry Keppeler\n\nFARM EQUIPMENT SERVICE AND SALES STUDENTS\n\nFront row, left to right: James June, Franklin Sherman, Louis Fancon, Robert\n\nSchroeder, Terry Schall, David Lathrop, Bennie Luptowski, Dale Cosner.

Missing: William Rader.\n\nFARM EQUIPMENT SERVICE AND SALES\n\nStudents enrolled in the Farm Equipment\n\nService and Sales program found\n\nlittle idle time in their schedules\n\nthis year. On top of a busy schedule\n\nof class and laboratory work ranging\n\nfrom weed seed identification to diesel\n\nengine repair~ students toured the Ford\n\nTractor Plant in Detroit, attended\n\nstudent club meetings, prepared exhibits\n\nand displays, sold box lunches at\n\nFarmers' Week, attended the Michigan\n\nFarm Equipment Association's Annual\n\nConvention; and, of course, played their\n\nusual games of basketball and football.\n\nStudent club meetings were varied and\n\ninteresting this year. Programs ranged\n\nfrom police dog training and space\n\ntravel to panel discussions given by\n\nfarm equipment dealers and viewing\n\nslides of European farm equipment.\n\nThe students' motto \"Geared to the\n\nTask\" describes very well the reason\n\nwhy students participated so widely in\n\nactivities this year. To meet the need\n\nfor trained personnel in the farm\n\nequipment industry, men graduating from\n\nthe program not only need the technical\n\ntraining given in the program, but also\n\nthe ability to work and play cooperatively\n\ntogether.\n\nR. M. Bittner\n\nFarm Equipment Service and Sales\n\nScholarships\n\nThe farm machinery industry has also\n\nprovided some scholarships for students\n\nmajoring in this program. Application\n\nshould be made with the Coordinator of\n\nthe Farm Equipment Service and Sales\n\nProgram, Agricultural Engineering\n\nDepartment, Michigan State University.\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThere are two major scholarship programs\n\navailable to the General Agriculture\n\nShort Course students. They are\n\nthe Michigan Bankers and the Caulkins\n\nFoundation scholarship programs.\n\nMichigan Bankers Scholarships\n\nThrough the leadership of the Michigan\n\nBankers Association and the active\n\nsupport of many of the local bankers in\n\nMichigan, over 1600 young men have been\n\nawarded a Bank Scholarship since the\n\nprogram started in 1949.\n\nMost of these scholarships are awarded\n\nto students attending the first term of\n\nShort Course. The decision to participate\n\nand award scholarship money is\n\nmade by the local bank.\n\nUsually the scholarship amounts to\n\n$100. In a few cases individual banl;:s\n\nhave encouraged continued attendance in\n\nShort Course by awarding part of the\n\nmoney for the first term and the balance\n\nin the second term.\n\nApplication blanks are available from\n\nvocational agricultural teachers, high\n\nschool counselors, county extension\n\noffices, local banks or the Short Course\n\nDepartment.\n\nCaulkins Foundation Scholarships\n\nSince 1949, the Caulkins Foundation of\n\nDetroit has provided funds annually. All\n\ncandidates for the scholarships must have\n\ndefinite plans for getting started in\n\nfarming. Thirty-three scholarships are\n\navailable each year. Applicants for the\n\nthird term General Agriculture course are\n\neligible to apply. The scholarships\n\namount to $75.00. Those students maintaining\n\na satisfactory record will also\n\nreceive this scholarship for the fourth\n\nterm of study.\n\nOther Scholarships\n\nOccasionally, a local business, Kiwanis\n\nClub or other organization, has awarded a\n\nscholarship. Information about these is\n\nobtained from local teachers or county\n\nextension personnel.\n\nOUTSTANDING STUDENTS\n\nFrom left to right: Kenneth Bohn, General\n\nAgriculture; Eugene Woodruff, Nursery\n\nand Landscape; Paul Darby Graves,\n\nElevator and Farm Supply; John Petru,\n\nFarm Equipment Service and Sales.

Among these are the Agricultural\n\nEducation Club Student Exchange\n\nwith other Universities; Agricultural\n\nskilldays so that members can acquire\n\nsuch skills as castration, forest management,\n\netc.; Annual Awards Banquet;\n\nTrip for selected members to the National\n\nStudent Teachers Conference at Kansas\n\nCity; Visiting high schools to help judge\n\nregional FFA Contests; Offering photographic\n\nservices at the State FFA Convention;\n\nand publishing an Agricultural\n\nEducation Newsletter. Our officers are\n\nelected at the end of winter quarter.\n\nEarly in the spring quarter all new\n\nofficers spend a weekend together in camp\n\nat the Yankee Springs Recreation Area to\n\nget to know each other and to plan the\n\nprogram for the coming year.\n\nMr. Thompson of the College of Education\n\nand Dr. B. Good of the College of\n\nAgriculture are the sponsors this year.\n\nFOUR YEAR DEGREE PROGRAMS\n\nThe curricula of the College of Agriculture\n\nare designed to prepare the\n\nstudent for a career in the broad fields\n\nof agriculture and conservation. The\n\ncourses provide a fundamental understanding\n\nof the basic physical, biological,\n\nand social sciences; agricultural\n\nand conservation principles; and\n\nthe technical knowledge required for\n\nspecialization in some phase of these\n\ntwo broad areas. A student who decides\n\nto further his education after being in\n\nthe Short Course Program may transfer\n\nhis credits to the four-year program.\n\nOne credit for each week satisfactorily\n\ncompleted will be transferred to the\n\nfour-year program. The knowledge and\n\nexperience gained in Short Courses and\n\nthe credits gained can help a student\n\ngo on to college. Dr. R. Swenson\n\nAG COUNCIL\n\nThe Agriculture Council was founded\n\noriginally to promote coordination and\n\ncooperation between the agricultural\n\norganizations on campus, to bring about\n\na spirit of friendship among students\n\ninterested in agriculture, and to\n\ndevelop desirable relationships between\n\nfaculty and students.\n\nThe Council is made up of elected\n\nrepresentatives from all agricultural\n\nclubs, now numbering eighteen.\n\nThe Agriculture Council sponsors the\n\nHarvest Ball, a fonnal, all-university\n\ndance, Farmers' Week booths, featuring\n\nMichigan Agricultural Products, the Ag\n\nHonors Program, where deserving students\n\nfrom the various departments and clubs\n\nreceive recognition for scholarship and\n\nclub activities, and the Spring Swing.\n\nThe Council also sponsors teams in the\n\nintramural program to give the clubs a\n\nchance to compete against each other in\n\norganized sports, such as basketball and\n\nsoftball. The winning team of the softball\n\ntournament meets the faculty in a\n\nmost exciting game at the end of the\n\nterm.\n\nCarl Eady\n\nEIGHT-WEEK HORTICULTURE COURSE\n\nEach winter term there is an eight-week\n\nhorticulture course for those specializing\n\nin fruit or vegetable production.\n\nThe courses alternate from year\n\nto year. This year about thirteen\n\nstudents were enrolled in the vegetable\n\nproduction course.\n\nWe had lectures from different instructors\n\nwithin the horticulture\n\ndepartment covering such topics as\n\nirrigation, weed control, fertilizers,\n\nmarketing, insect and disease control,\n\nand others. We toured the M.s.u.\n\nHorticulture Farm and the Plant Science\n\nGreenhouse to observe current research.\n\nI feel that the vegetable production\n\nshort course is worthwhile and will pay\n\nfor itself many times over for one\n\ngoing into the vegetable production\n\nbusiness.\n\nKenne th ¥..ahar\n\nDHIA\n\nThe Dairy Herd Improvement Association\n\nSupervisors Training Course is conducted\n\nby the Dairy Department at Michigan\n\nState University. The one-week training\n\ncourses are held three or four times a\n\nyear. They offer a stepping stone into\n\nMichigan's dairy industry.\n\nThe opportunities in DHIA are excellent.\n\nAt the present time 89 local associations\n\nin 73 counties employ approximately 130\n\nsupervisors. Only about 23% of all the\n\ncows in the state are on test. This\n\nmeans there are approximately 500,000\n\ncows in Michigan not yet being tested.\n\nExpansion possibilities are limited only\n\nby the supervisor.\n\nWith electronic computing machines to\n\ndo much of the pencil pushing, the\n\nambitious supervisor can easily handle\n\n20-25 DHIA herds and as high as 60 or\n\n70 owner sampler herds each month.
