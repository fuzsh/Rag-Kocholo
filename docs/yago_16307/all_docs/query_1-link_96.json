        "text": "Irritation\n\nIn an interview Eerhart once told he admired Paul Verhoeven (with whom he had worked on Turkish Delight) and was not impressed by his colleagues.\n\nHe said:\"I really wanted to make a movie, I envisioned to draw full houses. What irritates me about the Dutch film in general is that they are so slowly paced. They often have a wonderful story but I go crazy due to their slowness and because they are so poorly staged. And all that bullshitting about the brilliant lighting. Well, I don't give a damn. I am just bored\".\n\nStory\n\nThe > film Wildschut tells the story of two Dutch gangsters Jim > ( Hidde Maas ) and Charlie (Jack Monkau), one white, one black and wounded, who are on the run, after an armed robbery on a casino, with their loot. They move to Flanders, choose a remote farm called Wildschut as their hideaway and take hostage their residents. To take care of Charlie's bullet wound they stay in the room of Lisa (Annick Christiaens), the stepdaughter of the family, while keeping her baby Ruben hostage. Meanwhile the local police chief Dalsum (Werther van der Sarren) has been informed about the wanted robbers and has his suspicions about Wildschut as their possible hide-out.\n\nBesides the visits of Dalsum the tension increases also because Wildschut is located on a military training area with the soldiers exercising in their backyard. Due to the troubled family relationships, father Deleye (Josse de Pauw), a bold poacher, appears to be the begetter of Lisa's child, who has withdrawn into her own fantasy world ever since, the gangster duo brings a hornet's nest about their ears. The curiosity of son Hugo (Marc van Eeghem) towards their loot preludes the violent climax.\n\n>Jack Monkau (with gun) as Charlie and Bert Onraedt as baby Ruben\n\nHidde Maas\n\nTo make it into a fast-paced film screenwriter Thijssen made several significant chances to the plotline and characters in his novel.\n\nFor instance, in the book there were three robbers, with one of them commiting suicide. In the novel the robbery plays a part which was excluded in the film and also has a less fatalistic ending.\n\nOriginally all the characters had an equal role in the screenplay. It was decided during the editing of the film that Hidde Maas's gangster Jim had to be the main character. And it is Maas's charismatic performance that stands out. His presence as the sadistic menace Jim who displays an indefatigable reign of terror on the family Deleye steals the film. After the film Wildschut, Hidde Maas was often typecasted as the vicious hoodlum with the cold eyes.\n\nThe film's initial ending was changed after the seasoned Israelian film producer/director and co-producer (with Bos) of Field of Honor (1987) Menahan Golan commented: \"It is a good movie, but the nigger should die\".\n\n>Hidde Maas (l), Jack Monkau (r), Annick Christiaens (on top)\n\nCritics\n\nBecause director Eerhart claimed no moral excuses for the depicted violence, a lot of critics blamed him for this gratuitous approach.\n\nThe tone was sometimes extraordinarily grim. Film critic Peter van Bueren of the newspaper de Volkskrant wrote that the film Wildschut had a reprehensable starting point: \"Beating, raping, killing: only as a pastime. There is no reason to be proud of that\".\n\nUnderrated\n\nUnfortunately Wildschut flopped at the Dutch box-office despite its modest budget (approx. US$ 1.5M). That the film is highly underrated and undervalued can be noticed in the inferior Dutch DVD edition which is presented in pan & scan and with poor image and sound quality. This edition is in strident contrast with the nicely restored Belgian edition from De Vlaamse Film Collectie (see below!).\n\nAlthough the film Wildschut was not judged by its true merits at the time nowadays there's an increasing revaluation. And rightly so, besides the fast-paced editing, superb cinematography, great performances (particularly by de Pauw as the vindictive poacher and Van der Sarren as the suspicious, John Wayne look-a-like, village sherrif Dalsum) the film is crammed with tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogues. A rare case of a Dutch movie that can compete with the best American B-movies.\n\nThe superior Belgian DVD Edition\n\nClick here for more > Top 10 Film Lists"
