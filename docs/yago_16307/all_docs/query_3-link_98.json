        "text": "The director has to thank his actresses Zhou Dongyu and Ma Sichun, who imbue this drama with skilful displays of raw emotion. The story is simple enough: best friends since they were 13 years old, the profound mutual affection of free-spirited Ansen (Zhou) and pragmatic July (Ma) is severely tested when they both fall for the handsome Jiaming (Toby Lee) at age 18. As they drift in and out of each other’s lives in the following decade, the two young women begin to develop a renewed appreciation for their friendship.\n\nIt is an exquisite reversal – and a heart-warming irony – that through the recurrent sacrifices and concessions that they make to preserve the bond between them, Ansen and July assume each other’s lifestyle and philosophy, as changes around them lead them to discover unfamiliar sides of themselves. The gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack provide another plus, although there’s no arguing that Soul Mate lives by its female leads’ excellent performances.\n\nSoul Mate opens on October 27"
