        "text": "Whilst visiting Sydney a few years back I decided to take in a movie and cast my eye over the local cinema ads to try and find an Australian-made film to see. I was lucky enough to spot a screening of a recently restored obscure classic and despite being only of a handful of patrons at the Chauvel Cinema that night I was blown away by the unique and singularly disturbing Wake in Fright (originally released in the US as Outback). Now on selected release in the UK, this dark gem of a film defies simple categorisation and even now I can’t think of another film quite like it.\n\nDirected by the Canadian director Ted Kotcheff (whose somewhat eclectic career takes in 70s suburban comedies like Fun with Dick and Jane, the first Rambo film First Blood & 80s cult comedy Weekend at Bernie’s) and released in 1971 (the same year as Nic Roeg’s Walkabout), Wake in Fright is nowadays cited as one of the first works in the so-called ‘Australian New Wave’ but for many years was a forgotten and seemingly ‘lost’ film. In fact Kotcheff’s film sits somewhat uncomfortably between refined arthouse classics like Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock and the altogether more down-to-earth ‘Ozploitation’ movies churned out by low-rent auteurs such as Robert Franklin and Brian Trenchard-Smith.\n\nFaithfully adapted from Kenneth Cook’s 1961 novel, the film follows the progress of the seemingly urbane school teacher John Grant (Gary Bond) as he attempts to briefly escape from his stultifying existence in the outback. Bound into service as the sole teacher in the stifling no-horse town of Tiboonda (unforgettably evoked as a dusty panoramic in the film’s opening shot) Grant yearns for the more sophisticated pleasures of the coast and heads for Sydney as soon as the school year comes to an end. Immaculately clothed in his big-city suit and barely restraining his disdain for his workaday surroundings, Grant heads determinedly for the coast only to find himself becalmed and trapped in an obscure mining town where he spirals into a bewildering dark weekend of the soul.\n\nLosing all of his savings (including his air fare to Sydney) at a boisterous back-room gambling den in the friendly but somehow terrifying transit town of Bundayabba he slowly discovers the fragility of his cultured aspirations and finds himself reduced back to his raw and bestial essence. His beer fuelled descent in the brutal world of outback masculinity is horrifyingly evoked and is as terrifying and disorienting a narrative as has ever been captured on film. With its deceptively simple story line and slew of naturalistic performances Wake in Fright is a film that vividly evokes all of the senses. The audience can taste the bitter, repetitive glasses of beer, feel the greasy sweat and the dirt of Grant’s surroundings and suffer the head-spinning force of the heat and the dust. These queasy sensations are most uncomfortably experienced during the film’s most notorious sequence as Grant takes part in a drunken kangaroo hunt (controversially filmed on an actual night hunt) but are equally apparent in the inexorable parade of drunken scuffles, fights and physical entanglements, such as the almost hallucinatory drunken wrestling of Grant with the enigmatic Doc Tydon (Donald Pleasence).\n\nSomehow the surprising appearance of Donald Pleasence as an amoral and alcoholic outback doctor makes perfect sense in Wake in Fright and his quietly demented performance is up there with his very best although the character couldn’t be much different from his tea-sipping Inspector Calhoun in Death Line. The relationship between the fearfully trapped John Grant and the self-exiled Doc Tydon symbolises the essential dualism at the heart of the film’s narrative. At once reassured and repulsed by Tydon, Grant is forced to question the nature of his desired civility and come to terms with the baser aspects of his identity. In this sense the film appears to reflect the wider growing pains of Australia itself in the latter decades of the twentieth century articulating the tensions between the stark and sometimes brutal realities of working class white settler communities and the tentatively emerging, self-consciously ‘modern’ and cultured urban middle classes. At the heart of this is the horror evoked by raw and ungoverned nature (notably explored in Colin Eggleston’s nightmarish Long Weekend [1978]) and there are certainly parallels between Kotcheff’s film and the American fear and fascination of country folk as evidences in titles like Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\n\nWhilst such American films redeem their urban characters by making them physically fight back against their rural foes, Wake in Fright explores these tensions by subtly inverting them so that the cocksure and somewhat superior-feeling Grant is forced to re-evaluate his own values and his own humanity. For all the primitive and corporeal excesses displayed by the people of Bundayabba, they are almost uniformly straight-talking and honest, unquestioningly accepting and welcoming the stranger in their midst. Their openness and lack of guile acts in stark contrast to John Grant’s thinly veiled superiority (often resulting in blackly comic exchanges such as the occasion when Grant finally rejects the offer to ‘have a beer, mate’ with an uncomprehending truck driver who appears to interpret the refusal to share a drink as clear evidence of lunacy) and even in extremis, the often convivial, sometimes terrifyingly amoral Doc Tydon – who has come to represent everything Grant despises about ‘the Yabba’ (and one suspects, about himself) – is there to pick up the shattered pieces of his calamitous misadventures."
