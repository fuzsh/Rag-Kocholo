        "meta_description": "The film director Coco Schrijber’s brother disappeared a few years ago during a diving trip to Egypt. Was he taken by the sea, or did he die by his own hand? The mystery has never been solved, and the loss of her brother still haunts her and the people he left behind. Fifteen years later, she returns to finally confront the mystery. But the sea’s alluring and dangerous forces also contain an adventurous dimension, and a beautiful and almost mythological film takes shape, while the mystery slowly unfurls on land and in the mysterious world underneath the sea surface. Why did Coco’s brother Lex leave his knife on the beach that fateful day – something a diver would never do? And who was her brother really behind his introverted exterior? HOW TO MEET A MERMAID connects the dots in its story with the overview of a detective and the sensuality of a poet, and dedicates its search to the many people who each year go missing without trace in the sea.",
