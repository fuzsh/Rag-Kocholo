        "text": "Dutch-born stage, television, and screen actor Derek de Lint (b. 1950) who appeared in films such as Paul Verhoeven’s “Soldier of Orange” (1977), Academy Award-winner “The Assault” (1986) and opposite Daniel Day-Lewis, Juliette Binoche, and Lena Olin in “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” (1988), visited Brussels recently where he was a member of the jury at the latest Brussels Film Festival. As an internationally renowned character actor, he spent a considerable amount of time in America, but several years ago, he returned to Amsterdam. Still acting, passionate and enthusiastic as ever about his craft, this what he had to say in between the films he and his fellow jury members saw at the Flagey building in Brussels.\n\nMr. de Lint, as a member of the Festival jury, from which point of view do you judge the films you get to see? Do you watch them as an actor? As a spectator?\n\nStrictly as a spectator. I do know what an actor can do with a character or with a screenplay, or how he can work with a director, but I only watch the films as a spectator—or a professional spectator, so to speak. What’s most important to me when watching a movie is that I forget that I am an actor and that I won’t start analyzing the film, the performances,… Suppose I start having my doubts about the film, then I start wondering why. Is it the screenplay? Or maybe the direction? The actors, or the casting? So I like to be absorbed by the movie and the story, and when that happens, the movie is a thrilling experience to me.\n\nWhen you get a screenplay offered, what do you focus on? What are the main ingredients you are looking for?\n\nThere are two things I always keep in the back of my mind. First of all, there is the story: how is it told, and can you visualize it on the screen? Secondly, there’s the character that I am supposed to play. If I like my part but am not blown away by the screenplay in general, is it worth then to be part of it? I don’t have the power to change a screenplay, so when I get a screenplay in my mailbox, I have the choice to accept it or turn it down. So I go through it, see how the story progresses—I am not a screenwriter, but after forty years in this business, I consider myself capable of reading a screenplay—but it is crucial to me that I get the opportunity to do something with the character. I am an actor, so in the end, that is my job, and you can do that with a good screenplay. You can’t fix a bad screenplay on the set or during the editing; you only can ease the pain a little bit.\n\nWhen watching your performances in films and on television over the years, you are always a very interesting actor to watch, even when you don’t have any lines in a particular scene.\n\nThat’s always what you try to achieve as an actor. An actor doesn’t only need to look at what’s happening around him; he also has to think because most of the time, it is more than just being. You also have to ask yourself what your character is thinking about whenever you’re on the screen. In the Dutch-language movie “Gooische Vrouwen” [2011], for example, I played a character called doctor Rossi which became pretty famous because I didn’t say anything; I only looked. But that was a comedy—first as a TV series which ran for five seasons [2005-2009], followed by two feature films [2011 and 2014]—with a character who became very well-known because he was a psychiatrist from hell who didn’t know anything. So, in that case, there’s nothing to fall back on. As an actor, you have to be and look neutral then, to emphasize the effect of comedy. If you want to show any expression or emotion without using any words, you need to think and think things through.\n\nHow do you become your character? Do you use any specific technique in particular?\n\nI sometimes feel the need to withdraw in solitude to concentrate, but I also like the ‘English school’ very much. I once did a film with Albert Finney [“The Endless Game,” 1989], and one day on the set, he was telling many anecdotes about Monty Python; during his imitations, you could hear in the background, ‘Okay, sound!’ And from the moment they said, ‘Action,’ he became his character, just like that. And he was perfect, take after take. After he had finished his scene, he came back and continued joking the whole time [laughs]. That’s something I like and admire a lot, but it doesn’t always work. I don’t think you can do that every time. When you got a very emotional scene coming up, it’s impossible to joke around with your colleagues. You have to be fully concentrated on what you’re about to do in front of the camera. You also have to focus on your director: ‘Is everything ready? We’re all set?’ So then the ‘school’ of Daniel Day-Lewis is a much better option. Also, time is very often the worst enemy on the set. So when you leave in the morning to go to the set, it’s very comfortable to know that you’ve done your homework and you know your lines, you’re focused on your scenes, you know what you’re up to—you’re in the exact mood. Then it’s not a good choice to start joking around on the set.\n\nHow and why did you become an actor?\n\nThat happened by accident, really. I first went to the Art Academy [in Enschede] because I liked to draw, but that was not a huge success. Then photography, another passion of mine, was not an option either, so then I went to the Kleinkunstacademie in Amsterdam, hoping to become a stand-up comedian. After two years, it became clear that this wouldn’t work out, but there was a teacher who taught Spanish dancing, and he introduced me to Flemish author Hugo Claus. He gave me my first acting role in a play set in a small place near Ghent, which I enjoyed very much, but it wasn’t until I was offered an important part in the feature film “Soldaat van Oranje” [a.k.a. “Soldier of Orange,” 1977] that I knew what to do for the rest of my life.\n\nThe film was very successful, also in the U.S. You became one of the first Dutch actors to work in the U.S., isn’t it?\n\nYes, but there were a few actors working there long before I arrived in the U.S., one of them being John Van Dreelen in the 1960s. He never really made it, but I once visited him in Malibu. There’s Rutger Hauer, too, of course who did much more than I did, but I am not bitter about that because I returned to the Netherlands by choice. After living in Vancouver for ten years, I thought it was time to go back home in 2005. I know now what it feels like to be homesick, and I wanted to go on stage again, play roles in Dutch movies—doing everything in my own language again, you know. I had a few wonderful opportunities in the U.S., and I came this close to a few important leading roles, such as in “Star Trek.” It would have made me very rich [laughs], but I don’t think it would have made me happy. I am very attached to my life living in the center of Amsterdam, I can go anywhere by bike, and after ten years in Vancouver, I just wanted to get my life back. Going to Los Angeles would not have been an option for me. Despite all the money I made, it was as though something had been taken away from me. While living in Vancouver, my mother had passed away, my father was almost ninety years and I simply wanted to be with him instead of visiting him once or twice a year. Also, my three sons had told me they wanted me to return to Amsterdam—one of them was living in New York—so I wanted my own private life back.\n\nIf you could turn back the clock, would you still go to America?\n\nAbsolutely. I am very happy that I had those ten years over there, and I enjoyed lots of opportunities and job offers I had while I was there. I have been able to work with a lot of international directors and actors. On top of that, I can enjoy a very nice pension now, much more than if I would have stayed in the Netherlands. But living over there for the rest of my life, even though they all have those beautiful homes and wonderful cars, no, then I prefer my old bike in Amsterdam.\n\nThe English-language trailer of Paul Verhoeven’s World War II drama “Zwartboek,” a.k.a. “Black Book” with Derek de Lint in one of the leading roles. The film was the official Dutch entry for the 2007 Academy Awards in the category Best Foreign-Language Film.\n\nI suppose that filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, who directed you in “Soldier of Orange” and later on in “Black Book” [2006], two compelling World War II dramas, had a huge influence on your career, didn’t he?\n\nYes. I adore Paul, and if he calls me to say he’s got a part for me in a new film, I would accept it right away without reading the script. I just know he would never accept a script that he has any doubts about; he is a wonderful director and a man who knows the world. When I did “Soldier of Orange,” I didn’t realize that four decades later, I would still be talking about that film. When I arrived in Los Angeles at the end of the 1970s, early 1980s, many doors opened for me thanks to “Soldier of Orange.” Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick, they all had seen the film, and they just couldn’t believe that you could make a film with such production values for a budget of merely two and half million guilder [Dutch currency unit until 2002 when it was replaced by the euro]. So “Soldier of Orange” has been tremendously important to me. I actually hoped to play the leading role; I had this still photograph of mine, and I looked just like the character of Erik [role played by Rutger Hauer]. When Paul got to see this photograph, he said, ‘That’s him, that’s our leading man!’ But I didn’t have enough experience as an actor at that time. The same thing happened to me with “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” [1988]: director Philip Kaufman and producer Saul Zaentz wanted me to play the leading role of Thomas, a great role to play, but in the end, they had to choose between Daniel Day-Lewis and me… [laughs]. By then, he had finished “My Beautiful Laundrette” and “A Room With a View” [both 1985] and I had finished “Bastille” [1984], directed by Rudolf van den Berg—also a very good picture, but that was no competition to his work. So, in the end, I didn’t mind that I didn’t get to play Erik in “Soldier of Orange,” it would have been an enormous bourdon on my shoulders as I was still a rookie at that time. Also, I had no formal education as an actor. So, to answer your question: yes, Paul Verhoeven has been very important to me. There are other directors too, like Fons Rademakers who directed me in “De Aanslag” [a.k.a. “The Assault,” 1986, Academy Award winner as Best Foreign-Language Film], he also put me on the map in the U.S.\n\nFons Rademakers was one of the great European continental filmmakers of his generation, wasn’t he?\n\nCertainly, I was talking about him with Volker Schlöndorff; he was a highly respected filmmaker. All European directors knew him.\n\nWhat made him so unique?\n\nHe was also an actor: he would always play out the scene for you, which is terrible for an actor [laughs] because you’re tempted to do what he does, and that is not done. Other than that, I can only say great things about him. He was very passionate about his work, and he enjoyed life, things we both shared. He loved the book; I knew [author] Harry Mulisch, also [cinematographer] Theo van de Sande—we had done “Van de koele meren des doods” [a.k.a. “Hedwig: The Quiet Lakes,” 1982] together—so we all knew each other. I had worked with actress Monique van de Ven already in Ate de Jong’s “Dag Dokter” [a.k.a. “Inheritance,” 1978]. Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of Cannon had bought the Tuschinsky theater chain in the Netherlands. When they heard about the plans to bring Mulisch’s book to the screen, they told him, ‘Fons, we’re gonna make a big Hollywood production with big international stars!’ And Fons said, ‘Oh no, I’m very sorry, this is a Dutch story, it will be a Dutch film, and we’ll work with a Dutch cast.’ But when the film won an Oscar, they were very happy that they could distribute the film.\n\nDid this Academy Award launch your career in America?\n\nWell, you know, the funny thing is, if you ask the day after the Oscar ceremonies who won the Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film, nobody will remember it. The Oscars that matter the most are the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Supporting Actor and Actress Awards. The films in the Best Foreign-Language category are very interesting in the countries that submit those films. In the Netherlands, the Academy Award for “The Assault” was an enormous hype, but in America, it was only important within the film industry, for casting agents, not for a mainstream audience. But Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus promoted the film just beautifully: each day, they ran a small ad in The Los Angeles Times, and they made the film very visible by running it in Los Angeles for weeks and weeks, so everybody in the industry had a chance to see it.\n\nYou made a Flemish film many years ago, called “Mascara” [1987]. Considering the booming Flemish film industry, would you consider making another Flemish film?\n\nI would love to! Now! “Mascara” back then was very important to me, maybe even more important than “The Assault”: during the premiere of “The Assault,” Patrick Conrad [director of “Mascara”] came up to me, he introduced himself and said, ‘I am going to make a film with Sting and Charlotte Rampling. Would you like to be a part of it?’ Of course, I would. Eventually, Sting wasn’t able to do the film because he had to go on tour, so he was replaced by Michael Sarrazin. I knew him from a wonderful picture called “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” [1968]. So there I was on the set in Ostende, in front of the Thermae Palace Hotel. It was a very strange film, but I played Charlotte Rampling’s lover, and she was so kind to introduce me to her French agent Olga Horstig-Primuz who also represented stars like Brigitte Bardot and Yves Montand. Later Ms. Rampling also brought me to the attention of her English agent Jean Diamond who introduced me to international films. Olga was also there when we did “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” and it was very important for me to be represented by the right people who really fought for me. And all of that happened thanks to “Mascara.” In the end, this film really made a difference for me. But now, I would love to work in Flemish films again. When “Rundskop” [“Bullhead,” 2011] came out, everybody wanted to see it—and we all did. In the Netherlands, for example, actors and directors all speak very highly about Flemish films.\n\nBrussels Film Festival, Brussels (Belgium)\n\nJune 18, 2016\n\nMr. de Lint in a hilarious 1987 TV commercial made for Dutch television.
