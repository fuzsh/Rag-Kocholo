        "text": "by Georgina Torello\n\nIntroduction\n\nWomen were involved in the cinematographic field in Uruguay since its beginnings and throughout the entire silent period. This early and sustained participation of women in the cultural sector is not surprising considering the consolidation of the modern Uruguayan State in the first decades of the twentieth century. Led from 1903 by progressive president José Batlle y Ordoñez, Uruguay was the terrain of innovative reforms at the continental level, both during Batlle’s two presidencies (1903-1907 and 1911-1915) and, subsequently, until his death in 1929 through his political affiliates, the Batllista sector of the Colorado Party. Within a broad framework of economic, fiscal, rural, and social reforms—among them, the eight-hour work day, the secularization of education, and the ability for women to file for divorce—the female population was able to carve out spaces of relative autonomy. Women participated in the debates about their position in society, fighting for their own rights and for the rights and well-being of those in need, thus taking part in direct social actions. Their many political and social crusades not only gave women more freedoms, but also a new visibility in the rapidly modernizing society. One group of women that was particularly outspoken and visible during this time was also especially active in cinema: the elite. Upper-class society ladies quickly understood the many possibilities of the medium and, unlike other groups of women (the working class, middle-class wives, or even feminists), they had the social and economic power to engage with this new field. Thus, while female participation in the cinema transcended class, as this essay reveals, the elite’s powerful position in society, with direct access to the press and time for creative endeavors, determined the group’s (omni)presence.\n\nThis overview essay deals with the various modalities of female participation within the Uruguayan cinematographic arena, from an early example in 1900, through the 1910s when the field began to consolidate, and until the end of the silent period in the late 1920s. It seeks to not only insert these modalities of interaction into the historiography of a national cinema, but also to “rescue” women’s names and images, removing them from the anonymity in which they were plunged by the passage of time and a century-long lack of interest from chroniclers and researchers. Given the absence of specialized archives on the subject, both names and practices can only be (re)constructed from fragments: news items in the daily press, specialized magazines, occasional publications, and ephemera. This new information forces us, as feminist film historians, to not only rethink the cinematographic field of that time, but also to reconsider our own research in fundamentally more fragmented terms as well as to reassess the ways in which our work develops, including the gaps it fills and the absences that remain. In short, this reconstruction process necessitates the reorganization of feminine action in the past and ours in the present.\n\nThe title of this essay is a play on the expression of “name dropping.” Taken seriously, it refers to the social prestige that several of the upper-class women discussed below had in Uruguayan society at the time as well as to the reputation and authority that these names hypothetically transferred onto whomever was quoting them. In addition, the phrase brings into play the practice of listing (their own) names (or, again, the practice of “name dropping”) that some groups of women did for themselves, as I will show, when promoting film events they organized. Conversely, it tacitly comments on how no such prestige was associated at that time with quoting, for instance, the names of middle-class musicians who performed in movie theaters. Finally, the title of this essay is an ironic comment on all these women’s total erasure in the present; it is a reflection upon the often frustrating scholarly work of reinstating “dropped” names that are unknown today or perceived as irrelevant to film history. To this end, this essay claims that despite any strategic “uselessness” of compiling names, it is urgent work in order to fully understand the Uruguayan cinematographic field and to integrate these women into the seemingly “neutral”—but exclusively male—list of names that has for decades shaped silent film history in Uruguay.\n\nThus, in this essay, I both quote these original lists and create new ones at the end of each section: lists of names that, in most cases, are all that remain from these film-related activities. Since there are practically no printed interviews or statements from the women involved in Uruguayan silent cinema, it is not possible to hear their voices, not even mediated by journalists or editorials. For this reason, I am unable to interpret their ideas and (dis)comforts. There are no declarations, just names and facts—actually, chronicles of the facts. However, using these names and facts, I will map out and reflect upon women’s involvement in the cinematographic field. The danger is, at times, to slide into stark inventories. Yet, I believe it is a necessary risk and, hopefully, will inspire continued research.\n\nOne of the goals of this essay is to shed light on the importance of women in the creation of the first film productions in Uruguay, an activity that was mainly carried out by high-society women—those who obviously had the means and connections to sustain such endeavors. As the essay unfolds, it will become clear that the engine behind many (relative) accomplishments and enterprises in primordial Uruguayan cinema were upper-class female charitable associations, whose members were eager to explore cinema’s possibilities as part of their social and civic agendas. On a smaller scale, women of other social strata played a part in this emerging field, and this essay constitutes a first survey of other key figures. As cinema as a social phenomenon grew stronger, middle-class women were attracted to its potential as both an object of intellectual reflection and as a possibility for work and emancipation. This is true, to varying degrees, for women writers and intellectuals and for female musicians who accompanied films in theaters.\n\nThe first section of this essay situates my research in relation to several key feminist film historiographical interventions in recent decades. Responding to the calls for wider fields of inquiry, I embrace the need to look at practices where female action was relevant but was not sufficiently considered. As I will show, this is particularly important when rethinking Uruguayan film historiography more broadly. Thus, connecting two projects—the feminist agenda and a specific national historiography—allows me to (re)construct a field that, until today, was inevitably disjointed. I also include here a brief survey of “professional” actresses, who, due to my larger focus, I will not consider in the rest of the essay.\n\nThe sections that follow are organized chronologically. The second section examines the early participation of women in film exhibition, especially the presentation practice of combining still and moving images that started in 1900 and spanned through the 1920s. In fact, for many decades, both fixed projection (which often allowed women to integrate Uruguayan themes into the program) and moving images (generally, foreign films) animated Uruguayan society soirées. The third section considers a fiction film project, Artigas (1915), which was conceived by a female charitable association but was never completed. The fourth section focuses on the first feature film, Pervanche (1920), made possible by another female charitable association. It is followed by a discussion of key women intellectuals and writers and their public engagement with the new medium. The sixth section is dedicated to the last silent film produced by a female charitable association, Del pingo al volante (1929). Finally, the last section of this essay before the conclusion moves toward the middle-class, also the largest group of film consumers, to explore women’s relation to cinema as a workplace, focusing on the role of female musicians during film exhibitions. Though information is scarce—we have just a few names of women who performed in movie theaters in the 1920s—the fragments we do have underscore the link between cinema, women, and work. This final section allows me to “give back names” to those women who entertained Uruguayan moviegoers.\n\n“Diverse Figures”\n\nAlthough much work has been done by Uruguayan feminists at diverse levels, the relation between women and cinema was only recently taken into account. For women in silent cinema, the situation is even less articulated. Indeed, histories of Uruguayan cinema devote little space to the silent era and references to women are reduced to only a few names of actresses. Thus, I operate at a sort of degree zero. Yet, it is a degree zero that has the advantage of looking at positions and discussions in feminist scholarship from a distance, and putting them to the test in this national context with its specific conditions of existence and production. In fact, in Uruguay, as in most Latin American countries, early film production was artisanal and episodic, and the country never succeeded in building a real film industry. In this context, it is thus necessary to specify the terms of the aforementioned alliance between women and cinema because it is an alliance only thinkable if we consider how current research on cinema and women has questioned central categories in order to explore “diverse figures.” On the one hand, recent feminist film scholarship has incorporated into its scope marginal presences beyond the more traditional and widely studied professional categories of female directors or actresses. On the other hand, it has started considering women with no direct feminist or progressive agendas, integrating different strata of society and political positions into the conversation. Both “turns” are key to my work.\n\nIn the first instance, if we did not widen our scope, we must wait until 1938 for the first female director, namely Rina Massardi, who produced, directed, and starred in her only film, the musical Vocation. Moreover, the majority of women involved in Uruguayan silent cinema, as I mentioned before, were elite amateurs that approached movies with no training in the field or with the intention of becoming professionals. Indeed, if we are to be guided only by such a historically charged category like professional, we must wait until the middle of the 1920s for the first “professional” Uruguayan actresses. These women appeared in the first “commercial” fiction films—that is, films conceived outside the charity sphere but equally not industrial in nature—which were small one-off productions made by local entrepreneurs and that followed the narrative prerogatives of foreign cinema at the time, centering their plots around female protagonists. The first of these one-time actresses was Luisa T. de Cavalieri, who played a girl suffering from tuberculosis in Almas de la Costa/Souls of the Coast (1924), directed by Juan A. Borges. She competed for the male protagonist with a character played by Judith Acosta y Lara, a “flirtatious, frivolous and seductive” femme fatale, according to the press. The same year, the Uruguayan public was able to admire Perla Mary for the first time, the only one of these actresses who would later have a film career (in Argentina). She starred as a “rich and capricious girl” in the presumed lost Una niña parisiense en Montevideo/A Parisian Girl in Montevideo (1924), directed by Frenchman Jorge M. De Neuville. The film also included a femme fatale character played by Nieves Alonso. Finally, it is also worth mentioning El pequeño héroe del Arroyo del Oro/The Little Hero of the Golden Stream (1932), by Carlos Alonso, the last and most popular film of the silent period. Although the female characters are secondary in the story, based on a real-life murder from 1929, I will still “drop” their names here: Celina Sánchez and Hilda Quinteros.\n\nThus, if women acted very little professionally and did not direct at all during the silent era in Uruguay, the concept of “diverse figures” productively reorients attention to other activities, such as acting in and producing amateur productions, organizing film programs in local cinemas, outlining screenplays, writing about film in literature and the press, playing music in movie theaters, and producing actualities that captured elite social activities that would be screened at charity events. It also allows for an appreciation of the non-professional work of charitable associations. As noted in the Introduction, the most solid and organized form of female cinematic participation—and the one on which I will mainly focus—was through charitable associations that identified the new medium as an effective tool for raising funds and promoting their causes. Charities actually influenced the entire Uruguayan cinematic domain through the screenings of imported movies, as well as through the production of short documentaries and fiction films. In fact, two of the five fiction films produced in the country during the silent period were the result of women’s initiatives of this kind.\n\nThe second aforementioned feminist film historiographical “turn,” toward “diverse figures” occupying various ideological positions, enables me to give space to women not directly involved with feminist or progressive agendas. This entails both elite women working in charitable associations, many of whom were married to upper-class intellectuals, politicians, landowners, and descendants of patrician families, and middle or even working-class women without any known political affiliation. Concentrating on these “diverse figures” allows us to focus on their actions vis-à-vis the cinematographic field and what they generated in symbolic terms. In the case of the former, for example, we are able to identify how their elite status largely determined how films were produced, what their literary and aesthetic models were, what parts of the city were shown onscreen, which topics they addressed and, finally, the very representation of their gender. For instance, it is clear that their privileged position and group synergy permitted these elite women to establish alliances with producers in order to construct their own narratives, with theater owners to negotiate deals with central and prestigious venues, and with the press to spread the word about their activities. Although, of course, women’s power was still feeble compared to men’s influence, as already noted, from the turn of the twentieth century it had increased and, in the 1920s, it grew stronger as female presence in the public sphere augmented notably in the country. It is evident thus that elite women acted in and influenced the cultural milieu of their time. Rescuing their names, along with those of other Uruguayan middle-class intellectuals and musicians, has to do with the need to inquire about their concrete practices and to have a more complete panorama of Uruguayan silent cinema.\n\nAlthough the connections between Uruguayan silent cinema and charitable work has not been completely ignored, early historians did not delve into it. It was Christine Ehrick who, in her pioneering 2006 article “Beneficent Cinema: State Formation, Elite Reproduction, and Silent Film in Uruguay, 1910s-1920s,” effectively explored for the first time women’s key role, accounting for charities’ feminine origins and analyzing Del pingo al volante, the only charitable film that survives. Interested in the power dynamics existing between these associations and the Uruguayan State, Ehrick correctly highlighted to what extent the “beneficent cinema speaks to the ways in which film, as a visual medium, played to elite audiences’ narcissistic and nationalistic desires to see themselves (literally and symbolically) projected on the big screen.” In addition, she foregrounded how charities also used cinema to promote their pedagogic, aesthetic, and social agendas. What follows, thanks to extensive research in the Uruguayan press and in film archives, builds upon Ehrick’s hypothesis with a corpus of data and footage not previously available, furthering the importance of elite women’s complex participation in early Uruguayan cinema. Yet while Ehrick was focused on charity and cinema, I am interested here in cinema and women more broadly. This wider focus allows me to also look beyond the upper class and present some new names of women who, despite being less prominent, also helped to shape the cinematic field at the time.\n\nThe First Professional Film Actresses in Uruguay: Luisa T. de Cavalieri, Judith Acosta y Lara, Mrs. De Lara, Ida Gracia Livio, Perla Mary, Nieves Alonso, Nenucha Puig Chucarro, Pina García, Rosario Millán, Celina Sánchez, Hilda Quinteros.\n\nFilm Exhibition: Between Stillness and Motion\n\nThe connection between charity and entertainment can be found in Uruguay as early as the middle of the nineteenth century, during the Guerra Grande [Civil War] (1839–1851). Before the century came to a close, charitable associations often held bazaars, recitals, dances, live paintings, and other public performances to raise money for their projects. Therefore, it is not surprising that they quickly embraced the new medium of cinema in a similar capacity. One of the earliest examples dates from 1900. It was a “perfected magic lantern” show directed by an “intelligent and distinguished young lady of our society” to raise money for an unnamed charity and took place in the provinces. It is difficult to be certain whether this was literally a magic lantern show or a cinematic projection since, for a considerable period of time, the term “magic lantern” was used for both. This anonymous young woman could also have been performing an early version of the type of spectacle that, in the following decades, would become customary for elite entertainment, namely the screening of a combination of fixed and moving images at charity events. Regardless, she was taking part in early film presentation practices. If much research on the subject still needs to be done, it is safe to assume, looking at the presence in the press of women organizing similar exhibitions during the following decades, that the legitimating process from 1900 onward was rather quick. In fact, by the 1910s, anonymity was abandoned and women’s names appeared often in connection to similar events; as I will show, the names of the organizers would specifically become a big part of the promotion of the event in the newspapers.\n\nAs noted above, during the 1910s, one of the practices adopted by charity groups was the inclusion of photo projections in their film exhibitions. The concomitance of still and moving images was a very common practice, globally, in the first decade of the twentieth century, but it progressively fell into disuse as cinema acquired autonomy. In Uruguay, however, this practice was prolonged, in charity film exhibition, until the end of the 1920s. In these decades, charity shows often mingled the latest foreign feature films and self-produced actualities with projections of photographic series. These fixed presentations offered portraits of the ladies and children (sometimes also the gentlemen) of the ruling class—both in serious and comic fashion—and shots of social events, mostly charity parties, walks on the beach, outings to the racetrack, dances in sumptuous hotels, and weddings.\n\nFor example, in 1917, María Elena Larriera, the president of Entre Nous, an association of upper-class women who sewed items for the lower classes and organized different events to finance their activities, arranged a screening at the Buckingham Salón, one of the most prestigious venues in the capital. In addition to listing the names of the women involved in the event, the program, printed in the press, informed the public that feature films would be screened. But whereas no film titles were given, a detailed list of the photographs of social events sponsored by Entre Nous, which would be projected on the screen during the event, appeared. This list included the description of group portraits of the members of Entre Nous and its general assembly, choir rehearsals, prize distributions, horse races, sewing workshops, excursions, and other gatherings. Hence, a picture of high society of the time was drawn: visually, on the screen, and discursively, on the newspaper page.\n\nSimilarly, in 1918, a committee presided over by Martha Horne Flynn, and featuring many sponsors (all listed in the newspaper announcement), organized a charity screening event at Cine Rex. Unlike the previous example, in this instance, some of the still images that would be projected during the screening also appeared in the society section of the newspaper, signaling their importance in the context of the event. From today’s perspective, the publication of these images also partially preserves this ephemeral charity screening.\n\nIt is clear from these two promotional press items, and others like them, that in their fundraising activities, these elite charitable associations not only relied on a combination of moving images and fixed projection, but also that fixed projection was an important part. In the press releases transcribed in the social sections of the newspapers, fixed projections were constantly indicated as the chief attraction at these events (the French word for such an attraction, clou, recurs in the texts) whereas the feature films shown were often not mentioned at all. Aside from the technological benefit of fixed projection—it was likely a practical and cost-effective strategy for charities’ fundraising goals—if we think, particularly, of a female audience to whom these social fundraising exhibitions were generally aimed, then the emphasis on fixed projection—both at these events and in the press—functioned as a way for the organizers to manage priorities, highlighting where to look and at what.\n\nIn other words, these upper-class women publicly associated themselves with cinema rather quickly, shrewdly shaping and using these events and the press around them to also draw attention to themselves, their social status, and their work. As noted above, in addition to projecting still images and screening foreign films, these associations also produced their own actualities, which would also be exhibited at these fundraising events. Although these short films are all presumably lost today, we could imagine their contents thanks to their descriptive titles, which were also published in the press. They ranged from patriotic gatherings and sport activities (e.g., dance of the Pericón Nacional, tennis matches), to walks in the park (in the green Prado neighborhood), and private events (at least two weddings were filmed). Thus, through the adoption and maintenance of a mixed mode of exhibition that included moving and still images produced by these women, alongside foreign films, these elite women effectively “forced” their way—i.e., their names, faces, bodies, histories, priorities, and everyday activities—onto the screen, cohabiting with the most famous movie stars of the time. To a certain extent, these members of the elite were kind of celebrities. In 1923, for example, a newspaper announced an upcoming photo-shoot for still images that would be projected at the Cine Rialto in Montevideo. By giving the temporal and spatial coordinates of the shoot, the unnamed benefic association (and the press) invited the reader to participate, as a real-life spectator and to see “behind the scenes,” even though the people to be gazed upon were not true cinematic stars, but members of the elite. The practice of extensively listing names of the society figures involved in these film exhibitions also enhanced their glamour, a practice that would be maintained during the following decade, both in the press and on printed invitations. Thus, compared to the beginning of the century, when we saw one anonymous fundraiser organizing a projection, by the 1910s and 1920s, lists of female names, detailed event descriptions, and still images appeared regularly in the press, giving the charity events, but especially the women involved in these presentations, a key media visibility, and potentially an escape from the anonymity assigned to their gender in the private sphere.\n\nCharity film exhibition organizers and sponsors: María Elena Larriera, Martha Horne Flynn, María Helena Méndez Previtale, Carolina López Acosta y Lara, Nina de Malherbe Christophersen, Paulina Algorta Camusso, Margarita Sosa Díaz Piñeyrúa, Amelia Belfort Carril, María Angélica Márquez Castro, María Carlota Montaldo De León, Margarita Gallinal, Marta Villegas Suárez, Corina Seré Rucker, María Elena Algorta Guerra, Lolita Rodríguez Ramos, Delia Christophersen Ungo, María A.

With these words, the writer invited the reader to reflect on the female gaze in the movie theater—not any gaze, of course, but the gaze of an upper-class woman to whom the society pages of La Razón were dedicated and directed as readers, describing their recreational activities, the days of receptions at home, the marriages, births, and deaths, and the charity events. In the chronicler’s telling, at first the woman seems immersed in the images on the screen, but a closer look told (and tells us) another story. Everything was a pose, the chronicler insinuated and, observed carefully, her facial gestures imperceptibly revealed that something else was going on in her mind: the female spectator here was, the chronicler continued, “weaving a seduction plot and preparing her combat weapons.” The film, then, would seem like a mere stimulus for an action that would be consummated on an extra-filmic level. Interestingly, the writer avoided a well-established trope in the readers’ imaginary—the seductive power of cinema and its potential dangers, including the specifically feminine prototype of ​​the movie-struck girl —to fall into another, equally established one—that of the femme fatale who “plots” seductions and combats. Despite this, the writer was not mistaken when s/he pointed out the strategic gaze this woman (possibly an efficient metonymy for elite women) had toward cinema at that time in Uruguay. For her (for them), the new medium did not seem to have been mere fun to dive into, but a sort of promotional tool as well. A tool to plot and combat, but in the cultural arena.\n\nIndeed, the first attempt to produce a fiction film in Uruguay, in 1915, was fostered by an elite women’s charity association with nationalistic and educational aims. Although the film, titled Artigas, was never completed, for almost a year news of the project occupied space in the society sections of several newspapers and, therefore, in people’s collective imagination. According to the newspapers, the film was to focus on the life of José Gervasio Artigas, Uruguay’s national hero, and would be interpreted by the descendants of the very patricians who had helped fight for an independent nation. The idea for the film was developed by Margarita Uriarte de Herrera, president of the Ladies Commission of the Committee for Schools and Patronages of the League of Catholic Ladies of Uruguay. Matilde Regalía de Roosen, president of the Uruguayan League Against Tuberculosis, was appointed as the film’s director. The choice of Regalía de Roosen as director was particularly significant: on the one hand, she was part of a lineage of patricians and, therefore, could ideally direct the story with insider information. On the other hand, her connection with cinema dated back to the beginnings of the new medium. In fact, the first Lumière screening in Uruguay, in July 1896, was held at her family home, Casa Roosen, which was soon converted into Montevideo’s first movie theater, the Salon Rouge.\n\nAs a project, Artigas was well received by the community, and was assured a significant budget. The press reported several details about it: the script would be written by two renowned authors, Juan Zorrilla de San Martín, already considered by 1915 to be the preeminent national poet, and Raúl Montero Bustamante; the music would be played by the very popular César Cortinas orchestra; and the production would be completed by the largest producer and distributor of the time, Max Glücksmann’s Casa Lepage. This list of male participants is noteworthy as it highlights how these upper-class women were able to establish productive agreements with important artists and entrepreneurs of the time in order to make their film. While the actor playing Artigas was never announced, the organizers did disclose the actress chosen for the female role: Margarita Heber Uriarte, one of the “protagonists” of the social scene whose portrait often appeared in magazines.\n\nTowards the end of 1915, Artigas was abandoned without any public explanation and was never taken up again. Regardless of the project’s abrupt termination, its very existence embodies the beginning of fiction filmmaking in Uruguay. It also forces us to think about the first connections between cinema, fiction, national history, and patriotism, putting female agency in the foreground (as it should have always been) and answering, at least partially, the question of who would be in charge of these narratives. Furthermore, it establishes a clear link between cinema and pedagogy, since, as one newspaper claimed, the film would be of “great educational interest for the formation of our young students because it is well known that it is not as easy to admire heroes in patriotically enthusiastic sentences than it is to see them move and throb at the impulse of that same high feeling; nor to study a moment in history than to see it unfold before the eyes.”\n\nThe unproduced film’s potential pedagogical effect paralleled the discussions around the relationship between cinema and childhood, which, precisely in the early 1910s, began to proliferate in the country, either to demonize cinema or to distinguish between good and harmful applications of the medium. Significantly, cinema was mentioned in 1913 for the first time in the report of the Theater Censorship Commission compiled by the League of Catholic Ladies of Uruguay, led by Laura Carreras de Bastos. In it, Carreras de Bastos begged upper-class women to “draw the attention of Uruguayan mothers to the dangers that cinematography embodied for children’s brains.” La Liga was not alone in this crusade because, even outside religious spheres, there was a general interest in regulating and censoring film exhibitions for children. Nevertheless, by 1915, much of the elite charity sphere understood that regulations should not prevent the use of cinema as a pedagogical tool. Even the Child Protection Committee itself, headed by Gladys Shaw, established, by 1917, agreements with businessman Max Glücksmann to program children’s matinees. It is clear, then, that the development of Artigas fit into the elite’s broader interest in (first and foremost) exploiting the cinema to raise interest (and money) for their enterprises, but also as a way to showcase their own kin, (re)write the past and present of their country, and educate younger generations through the reinforcement of a certain set of patriotic and cultural values.\n\nPlanned producer, director, and actress for Artigas; pedagogues and committee members: Margarita Uriarte de Herrera, Matilde Regalía de Roosen, Margarita Heber Uriarte, Laura Carreras de Bastos, Gladys Shaw, Julia Muñoz Nin, Magdalena and Lucila Lussich Siri, Susana Soca Blanco, Helena Hughes García Lagos, Hortencia de Herrera Uriarte, Maria Cecilia Etchepare Herrera, René Pietracaprina Méndez, María Celia and Elida Schiaffino Espalter, Hortensia Turenne Puig, Sarita Durán Guani, Inah Mañé Azevedo, Adelita and Isolina Castels Eastman, Martha and Mirta Beherens Muñoz, Maria Hortensia Serratosa Carvalho, Amelia, and Sara Méndez Schiaffino, Emita and Elina Capurro Castels, Glady, Castellanos Cranwell, Albertina Deluchi Turenne, María D., Elisa Nocetti Mullins, Sara and Laura Lussich Márquez, Martha and Raquel Zás Allende, Rosita Piccardo Ruano, María Celia Gallinal Risso, Blanquita Blanco Hughes, Blanquita and Elba Pérez Castels, Emita Seré Rücker, Delia and Susana Pascual Castellanos, Coquita Regalia Muller, Marujita Seré Castellanos, Margarita Sienra Castellanos, Cristina Mourelle Ruano, Beba and María M.

Gómez.\n\nCharity as a Pioneer of Fiction: Pervanche (1920)\n\nThe cinematic ambitions of charity groups—and Uruguayan fiction filmmaking tout court—were met in 1920 with Pervanche, a production of the aforementioned female association Entre Nous, led by Otilia Pereira Braga. The film, presumed lost today, was based on a screenplay outlined by María Magdalena Villegas Márquez, a member of Entre Nous, and one of the film’s protagonists, along with Gladys Cooper de Buck. While Pervanche’s title referred to the almost homonymous novel Pervenche (1904) by the famous female French writer Gyp, the film’s plot was an adaptation of Mademoiselle de la Seiglière (1848) by Jules Sandeau, and contained all the basic ingredients of melodrama: the decline of a wealthy family, a dangerous love triangle, and a happy ending with a marriage. The film premiered at the Teatro Solís, the most lavish venue of the capital. It was directed by León Ibañez Saavedra, and featured members of the Uruguayan elite.\n\nPervanche was not the first attempt by Entre Nous to produce a fiction film. (The organization also produced actualities, as discussed earlier.) In fact, in September 1918, the society section of La Razón announced that, under the banner of the association, a local author would write a comedy and members of the elite would be in charge of the performances. By November, it was stated that the script would be written by a “distinguished and intelligent lady, a prominent figure in the literary milieu” whose name, perhaps titillating readers’ curiosity, was not given. It was also reported that production would start as soon as Sylvia Azevedo Braga, President of the Club, returned from Rio de Janeiro. Yet, by December, when she was back in Montevideo, as stated in the press, the project was abandoned. Even if there are some coincidences that would suggest—given the recurrence of Entre Nous and the “Braga” surname in the two projects—that the project from 1918 was Pervanche itself, what seems important here is the maintained interest, within the association, in filmmaking (both actualities and fiction) in addition to their film exhibition practices as well as their faith in the power of the medium.\n\nFrom the few stills available, and from the coverage in the press, we know that, in addition to following foreign narrative tropes, Pervanche was intended to create a very precise image of Uruguay, and its capital. The story depicted Montevideo as a modern and cosmopolitan city, an image of the city that other media, such as postcards or magazines, had previously presented. That is to say, the city where the elite circulated (urban areas and parks), and where it lived (the film showed several of the city’s most beautiful palaces). Pervanche built a fragmented and exclusive discursive map, but it also, at least symbolically, invited the general public to voyeuristically “enter” that world, and rub shoulders with and observe the ways and fashions of the elite. In this way, the film not only functioned as a means of self-representation for the upper class, a practice already established at events and in the press as I have shown; it was also a form of self-representation that, under the guise of a fiction film, was perhaps more glamorous, immediate, and powerful than the actualities or static pictures, and one in which its elite makers had more conscious control.\n\nPervanche producers, script writers, and actresses: Otilia Pereira Braga, María Magdalena Villegas Márquez, Gladys Cooper de Buck, Margarita Savedra Barrozo, María Isabel Moreno, Elvira Mousques, Elisa Vargas, María Guerrero, Sylvia Azevedo Braga.\n\nIntellectuals and Cinema\n\nCriticized for its technical imperfections, Pervanche was defended by a renowned social activist, journalist, and writer: Fabiola, the pseudonym of middle-class writer Teresa Santos de Bosch. In her response to the criticisms of the film, she associated economic precariousness and aesthetic results, pragmatically establishing the need to think about film production from the periphery, and with the resources of the periphery. Her article intelligently transcended the “merely” aesthetic questions in favor of an analysis that pinpointed, as the main problem, the difficulties for marginal markets to produce films. In short, her discourse assumed that Uruguayan cinema could only be called what later film historians have articulated as a cinema of a “small nation.” And, because of that, she suggested that critics should adapt their notions according to the country’s economic and material conditions in order to promote a much-needed development of the industry. Fabiola’s review of Pervanche in 1920 thus constitutes the first articulate and lucid discourse on the question of critical reception and national cinema in Uruguay.\n\nFabiola was not the first female writer who dealt publicly with cinema. María Elena Crosa de Roxlo, in her collection of stories entitled A través de la vida/Through Life (1913) included one called “La cinta cinematográfica,” or “The Film.” In it, Crosa de Roxlo—a long forgotten writer—developed an exciting plot that fused medicine, hypnosis, and control over the female body, although she never mentions the “film” of the title. However, the title is a crucial piece of “para-text” that necessarily frames the reading: it is like declaring that everything that happens in the story, printed on paper, is “film” material. “La cinta cinematográfica” is therefore a specimen of the early association, and possible intersection, of cinema and literature in Uruguay. The book came out precisely when European film producers consolidated their melodramatic and diva film narratives and massively exported their products to Latin America. These films would soon become hegemonic in the continent, at least until the First World War; Crosa de Roxlo’s story was perfectly timed, as Uruguayan audiences were very much attuned to this kind of intricate plot on the screen. Another liaison between women, literature, and cinema was established by Edgarda Cadenazzi—an extraordinary figure of avant-garde writing—in her long “Poema en serio a Carlitos Chaplin,” or “A serious poem to Charlie Chaplin” (1928), in which she offered a labyrinthine and “modern” portrait of Charles Chaplin. Her voice joined those of other avant-garde Latin American writers, mostly men, who regarded the actor as a paradigm of dissent functioning at the very heart of the United States film industry. While more conventional, production-oriented film historiographies would perhaps ignore Fabiola, Crosa de Roxlo, and Cadenazzi’s respective critical and literary work, I mention them here to foreground the different ways that some Uruguayan women outside of the upper class actively engaged with cinema and film culture during the silent era.\n\nWhen considering the relationship between female intellectuals and writers and cinema, it is also worth mentioning another charity project. In 1923, The Committee for the Support of the Fermín Ferreira Poor Children’s Hospital, run by María Laura Viana Giuria, produced a short scenic film about a park in the Prado neighborhood. For the occasion, two poets, Juana de Ibarbourou and Esther Parodi Uriarte, offered their verses for the intertitles. Whereas no chronicle of the screening was given in the press, the magazine Montevideo Film published these women’s poems, highlighting the importance of the poetic contributions to this project. The actuality, shot by the French cameraman Henry Maurice, was set in the Prado, one of the greenest and most beautiful neighborhoods in the city, and apparently featured children. “You are going to see a festival of children and flowers/Spring of lights and colors/It takes place on emerald meadows/harmonizing wings, flowers, children and trills,” announced the prologue of the film, written by Parodi Uriarte. The main park of the neighborhood was itself the theme of Ibarbourou’s “poetic commentary.” While Fabiola, Crosa de Roxlo, and Cadenazzi’s critical and literary work described above suggests that the cinema was a theme or topic for some female intellectuals and writers, Ibarbourou and Parodi Uriarte’s poetic contributions to this film project perhaps suggest that cinema was also a medium with which to further their particular artistic practice.\n\nBoth Ibarbourou and Parodi Uriarte would appear a few years later, along with ten other female intellectuals and university graduates, to support a project for the monopolization of cinema by the State, as developed in the publication El biógrafo (1926) by Enrique Barlocco. In the booklet, these twelve public figures were asked to write brief statements endorsing the ambitious project to reduce the hegemony of foreign cinema. This is the only known example of Uruguayan women openly advocating for a national cinema.\n\nAmong these twelve women, we also find one of the most prominent voices in the field of education, that of the feminist writer, intellectual, and educator Luisa Luisi, a member of a middle-class Italian immigrant family whose sisters were the first female university students in Uruguay. Her link to cinema was well known by then and mirrored the pedagogical impulses within the charity sphere mentioned earlier in this essay. Almost a decade earlier, in 1917, Luisi organized the conference “Cinema, a School Ally,” held in the Biógrafo Uruguayo, which was conceived to be laboratory for testing the potentialities of films projections in pedagogical contexts. According to one newspaper chronicler, Luisi achieved this successfully by combining her speech with the screening of scientific and industrial films in front of an audience comprised of mesmerized children and prestigious intellectuals of the time. Remarkably, one article also offers photographic “proof” of the children’s interest.\n\nTo return to the notion of “diverse figures,” it is possible to map out a variety of ways that women outside of the upper class engaged with cinema during the silent era. These scattered but very specific examples of intellectual and literary engagement with cinema by female writers, poets, and thinkers show how women, in fact, not only participated in film screenings and events to promote and fund their charitable work. They also reflected upon the possibilities of the national cinematic production (opening debates their male counterparts chose not to participate in), elegantly included the new medium in their literary creations or used it to further their artistic practices, and actively participated in the discussions around the importance of cinema in Uruguay.\n\nIntellectuals, poets, writers, and doctors (signatories in El biógrafo): Teresa Santos de Bosch, Elena Crosa de Roxlo, María Laura Viana Giuria, Juana de Ibarbourou, Esther Parodi Uriarte, Nylia Molinari Calleros, Enriqueta Compte y Riqué, Luisa Luisi, Ema Elsa Tiribocchi, Elisa Barros Daguerre, Rosa Mautone Falco, Sofía Álvarez Vignoli de Demicheli, Noel Demateis, Aurora Velazco de Brunetto, Ángela Scalone, Edgarda Cadenazzi.\n\nCharity and the Uruguayan Flapper: Del pingo al volante (1929)\n\nDel pingo al volante/From the Racehorse to the Steering Wheel premiered in 1929. It was produced by Bonne Garde, an association that helped single mothers with their newborns by giving them instruction and housing, under the guidance of Ana Chain de Piñeyro. It starred Luisa Ramírez García Morales—in the role of Susana Aguiar—a member of the elite, as was the rest of the cast. Fortunately, the film is still extant and is held at the Cinemateca Uruguaya.\n\nDirected by Robert Kouri, the film reflected, as Pervanche did, the anxieties of the upper class, staging a family in decline whose only economic salvation was the marriage of Susana to a rancher cousin who was obviously rich. Susana does not suspect that a plot for the two to meet is planned by her mother and the family’s notary. To complete the (necessary) love triangle, and ignite the action, the film includes an indolent and equally rich man from Montevideo. Christine Ehrick has argued that Del pingo al volante “is most obviously a film about modernity and masculinity, but it is also a film about breeding and the reproduction of elites.” She also rightly refers to Susana’s mother’s power within the plot. Building on that, it is essential to emphasize that Del pingo al volante also represents Susana as part of a new generation of women, one that adopts flapper haircuts and fashionable dresses, and hints at the girl’s possible rebellious attitude. Not only is the young protagonist rather independent, speeding around town in her own car, but early in the film, in response to the wedding solution offered by the notary, her mother replies: “A marriage? For God’s sake, doctor! Susana is a very difficult girl…” Yet as the film progresses, the audience understands—and is therefore reassured—that her “difficulty” is only a mild one and that it will eventually be overcome by love. Thus, while this new generation of women was represented in the film as fashionable and modern, they were not politicized like the more feminist figure of the New Woman. And while the film seems to allow Susana a final say—she ends up choosing the “right” mate, her cousin, without discovering her mother’s plot—she ultimately helps to maintain her family’s economic position. Thus, Del pingo al volante portrayed a national version of the moderate (upper-class) flapper.\n\nDel pingo al volante is a story about the upper class and, through it, Bonne Garde presented images of a world familiar to its members. Likely that same year, the charitable association also produced a short documentary film, titled La Bonne Garde, about the institution’s house for single mothers. The film, which is also still extant and held at the Cinemateca Uruguaya, shows the practical side of the association’s work: groups of young mothers with their “saved” children in a safe environment. In short, it complements Del pingo al volante and serves as an equally effective platform for advertising Bonne Garde’s mission. In other words, it is rather fruitful to think about these two productions together as it shows more clearly Bonne Garde’s aims. (Even if no information was found about the production, or even the premiere, of La Bonne Garde, it is likely that these two films were produced simultaneously.) With one film, the organization portrayed the lively and entertaining (imaginary but credible) activities of the elite families, while, with the other, it presented the hard reality of young, single, and poor mothers, whose only hope came from the help provided by young women like the heroine of Del pingo al volante. In this sense, the elite’s version of the modern woman was one who could alternate between her luxurious, active, and fashionable world and the world of women in need.\n\nDel pingo al volante producers and actresses: Ana Chain de Piñeyro, Luisa Ramírez García Morales, Mrs. de García Morales, Cotina Jiménez de Aréchaga, María Elena Algorta Guerra, Marta Preve Thevenet, María Adelaida Ramírez García Morales, Renée Pietracaprina Méndez, Emilia Varzi Castell, Sarita Etchegaray Vidal.\n\nMovie Theaters and Musicians\n\nFemale musicians in cinema theaters were less frequently employed than men but not unusual. In actuality, from the 1920s onward, musical performances by women took place, both in the capital and inland. While there are no specific studies on the subject, it is possible to relate this appearance in movie houses and, therefore, in the professional sphere, with the education Uruguayan girls received between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Indeed, in the private realm, music was a key part of the female elite and middle-class upbringings and, as researcher Marita Fornaro has pointed out, the “nineteenth-century piano is the adornment of marriageable young women, who after their marriage can play it during family reunions.” Likewise, as the century progressed, girls began to study in conservatories located in different parts of the country, graduating as piano, music theory, and violin teachers. Following the steps of Jacinta Furriol, Carmen Luna, Orfilia Pozzolo, and Dolorcita Renteia, all composers from the nineteenth century—as Roberto Lagarmilla pointed out in his chapter about “Woman in Uruguayan Music”—some of these educated women composed, published, and premiered their opuses, as was the case with María Galli, María Eugenia Vaz Ferreira, Carmen Barradas, Aurora Calo Berro, Socorrito Morales de Villegas, and María Esther Roosen de Regalía.\n\nOur movie theater musicians thus had, undeniably, multiple female role models. From 1900 up to the 1920s, female orchestras and soloists, some of them mentioned above, used to appear in the press. But unlike these musicians, performing often at charitable events, middle-class female musicians in movie theaters (like their masculine counterparts) did not seem to reach the press. Some information about them, however, can be found directly in film programs. The ephemeral nature of this material, and the lack of significant collections in Uruguayan archives, makes any kind of survey extremely difficult and somewhat random. An important private collection of film programs from the inland city of Minas (Department of Lavalleja), somehow scattered among collectors, shows that women’s participation in cinema theaters as musicians spanned the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1925, professors Juana C. de Sarti, María del Carmen Deubaldo, and Adelina Salazar were often in charge of the musical performances at the Teatro Lavalleja. By 1927, Sisa Bonino, Ignacia Poroli, and violin teacher Miss M. Demicheli, also a member of the Orquesta Cañela, played at the Teatro Escudero. Lastly, in 1929 a Professor Minita Ricetto de Acciari was performing a symphony at the Teatro Florida, in the inland city of Florida.\n\nFor Montevideo, even less information can be gathered. I found only one, but rather significant, mention of a woman playing in cinemas in the magazine Uruguay Cinema. In 1927, María Isabel Carry—or Cary, the spelling changes in the same article—was the conductor of the Tersípcore Ladies Orchestra that usually performed at the Cine Teatro Plus Ultra. As the article stated, “she garners extended applause for the performance of an outstanding and varied repertoire, featuring fashionable and classical music that properly interprets the heterogeneous temperaments enjoying the show.” Although not much data is given, the way the article presents Tersípcore—that is, as nothing out of the ordinary, just a modern orchestra—allows us to conjecture that a certain number of female orchestras regularly performed during the period, maybe even in movie theaters, but were simply forgotten. Finally, The Golden Book of Cinema in Uruguay, written in the 1950s, devoted a chapter to musicians of the silent era. It included a long list of orchestras and male performers, but only cited two women: Libertad Balsán at the Cine Porteño and the unnamed “daughter of Don Angelo, the businessman from Cine Olivos.”\n\nThe names of these middle and potentially working-class women revealed here allow us to think of female performances in movie theaters in the first decades of the century as important professional (cinematic) work. Not only are they instances of female engagement with cinema outside of the elite (charity) sphere, but they also go beyond the domestic musical activities of “marriageable” girls or the conservatory environment. Their names also return to us a space in the new modern social order in which these women took part and, in which, following the fast and multiple images on the screen, they could improvise and create music with their pianos, violins, and orchestras as part of their jobs.\n\nMusicians in movie theaters: Sisa Bonino Juana C. de Sarti, María del Carmen Deubaldo, Adelina Salazar, Ignacia Poroli, Miss M. Demicheli, Minita Ricetto de Acciari, María Isabel Carry (Cary), Libertad Balsán, the “daughter of Don Angelo.”\n\nClosing and Opening\n\nThrough extensive research in the press and archives, this overview essay explored the wide-ranging participation of women in the precarious Uruguayan cinematographic field of the early twentieth century. It constituted a first mapping of the areas in which mostly upper to middle class women contributed to the construction of the cinematographic field of the period. Doing so, they significantly set a model for how to understand cinema for other women: those reading the newspapers and learning about the cinematic events organized by the charitable associations; those watching a charitable film; those reading their critical writing about cinema; or those listening to the music played by one of the artists mentioned above. While not the focus of this essay, the female audience—an entity that has gained much academic attention in the last decades—was the ideal public for all these women’s work. This unknown group of women from all strata of society is, in a way, also present here.\n\nMy use of “name dropping,” perhaps at times exasperating, was intended to make specific women’s contributions to the field visible. Not only as part of categories (actresses, intellectuals, musicians, etc.) or groups (charities), but as concrete people, with names, surnames, and bodies, who progressively engaged with the cinematographical field. To show these different, and often overlapping, modalities, I chose to present my research chronologically instead of grouping all the charity-related work together, for example. The kind of name-rescue that I do here is only possible due to surviving, and fragile, pieces of evidence, such as photos, programs, invitations, films, articles in newspapers, and novels. These artifacts functioned here in two ways: as a concrete and verifiable foundation for my research, and as substitutes for a presence that, until now, seemed non-existent. As secular contact relics, in other words, every piece of information kept us “close” to the protagonists. In its incompleteness, this essay also seeks to lay the foundation for future studies. Now that we do have some names, much more remains submerged, anxiously awaiting to be discovered and analyzed.\n\nSee also: “Writing the History of Latin American Working in the Silent Film Industry”\n\nby Donna Casella\n\nIn a 1921 Picturegoer article, Jeanie Macpherson advised prospective writers not to worry about submitting scenarios with scene by scene outlines; instead they should send in a synopsis of 3000 words and a scenario staff would reshape the material for shooting. She warned her audience: “Do not have the camera in mind as you write.” In contrast, by 1926 Frances Marion in Photoplay was advising those interested in adaptations to go beyond plot, to translate the original story “into screen language.” Their different perspectives on how to write for the screen reflected the rapid changes in the craft during Hollywood’s silent period. Women, like Macpherson and Marion, were very much a part of these changes. As Wendy Holliday points out, about 50% of the scenarios were written by women; although, the exact percentage is unknown due in part to inconsistent crediting. In fact women’s presence was felt in multiple areas of the American film industry including writing, directing, producing, and editing, as the industry initially welcomed, even sought out, their contribution. Women wrote both original and adapted scenarios. In addition, they contributed story ideas, served as story editors and continuity writers, and wrote titles. As department and unit heads, they further impacted the stories being told. Women were everywhere as the craft of screen writing took shape.\n\nWith many of the films and scripts from this period lost, scholars have turned to archival sources, such as fan and trade publications, memoirs and biographies, to explore women’s contribution. They have documented women’s work, and have examined both the social and economic forces that influenced women’s entrance into the industry and the gendered context and nature of their work. However, research has been relatively silent on the ways in which these women influenced screen writing as a developing craft. Women writers offered insights on how to write the scenario or shooting script. And while many women met the studio and audience expectations for female-centered narratives, female protagonists and subject matter, they also pushed the boundaries of expectations by crafting strong independent female characters, by refusing to “write to gender,” and/or by producing alternative cinematic forms. During their time in the industry, women helped shape the form and technique of cinematic writing and influenced both its tone and content. They carved a place for themselves in the history of a developing art form.\n\nAdvancing the Form\n\nWhen women entered the industry as “writers,” there was no existing craft to learn as there were no written scripts. Writing for cinema prior to 1912 involved submitting story ideas/plot synopses or writing titles. Ideas and synopses were elicited through magazine advertisements or contests, freely submitted, or written by company staffers. Women were counted among the many early contributors of these “stories,” as gender was not an impediment. Karen Ward Maher notes in Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood that women in all areas of cinematic production “enjoyed low craft and gender boundaries” in the very early days of cinema–a situation that would later change. These early stories took the form of a few lines of text, a paragraph or a one-page plot summary. Producers/directors then took the story from page to screen, while a clerk on set “held the script,” recording scenes, action, dialogue, and shooting directions. These clerks were called script girls, since most were female secretaries or assistants, a testament to the different ways women were tied to early storytelling in Hollywood.\n\nWriting for the screen was attractive to women, both those who freelanced from home (through open submission or writing contests) and those who sought full-time careers. Martin F. Norden in his study of The Moving Picture World articles from the teens explains that the open submission structure was appealing to women bound to the home as it offered them an opportunity “to pursue more creative experiences.” Maher finds a similar attraction in the company-sponsored contests advertised in popular fan magazines. Her research indicates that most winners of early company contests for the best “story idea” or plot synopsis were women. Such women followed in the footsteps of those women writers who had been contributing stories to popular magazines since the nineteenth century. Women also were drawn to full careers in the cinema. Cari Beauchamp argues in Creative Screenwriting that writing for the screen appealed to women, as did other jobs in the industry, because “With few people taking the new industry seriously, the doors were wide open to women.” Lizzie Francke in Script Girls: Women Screenwriters in Hollywood believes the arts in general, including cinema, offered attractive careers particularly to the white, middle class “New Woman” of the time, “the independent career minded and mostly middle-class females who were striding into the twentieth century.” For many, there was a financial need to work. As Sumiko Higashi explains in Virgins, Vamps and Flappers: The American Silent Movie Heroine, this need successfully challenged the separate spheres model that argued for women’s place in the home. As a result, between 1910 and 1920 women’s presence in the work force increased as did their wages. The need for writers in Hollywood, then, emerged at a time when women were looking to expand opportunities, financial and/or creative, beyond the home.\n\nAmong the documented early career writers were Edison’s Carolyn Wells who joined the staff as a writer in 1909, according to Lux Graphicus in Moving Picture World. Mary Pickford began her career the same year, writing and acting in both Getting Even (1909) and The Awakening (1909). And Kathlyn Williams started as a writer with The Last Dance (1912), before her run as a serial queen. Gene Gauntier was also one of those early writers. She quickly became a driving force as both an actor and writer for Kalem productions. In “Blazing the Trail,” which first appeared as a serialized article in the 1928 Women’s Home Companion, she explains that though she was hired at Kalem as an actor, she began writing “crude” scenarios in 1907: “A poem, a picture, a short story, a scene from a current play, a headline in a newspaper. All was grist that came to my mill.” Her comments reflect the skeletal nature of early writing. When she first started, stories consisted of outlines with a few words describing each scene: “There was never a scenario on hand.” Like Gauntier, Anita Loos entered the business early; however, Loos focused her career solely on writing. In her 1977 memoir, Casts of Thousands, she explains how she began submitting stories from home, and was only a teenager when she captured the attention of D.W. Griffith. In fact when Loos came to Hollywood to meet him, at his request, he mistook her mother for his intrepid new writer. Loos writes that her first produced story was The New York Hat in 1912, and for the next three years, she turned out over one hundred stories/scenarios. Whatever Biograph rejected went to Vitagraph, Kalem, or Selig. Loos admits in an interview with Film Fan Monthly in 1967, however, that what were called scenarios were pretty bare: “As a matter of fact, the films were practically composed on the set.”\n\nThis assembly line of film production that both Gauntier and Loos identify resulted in early crediting problems that impacted the woman writer. In the absence of detailed scenarios, the final film was often far from the original story idea or plot summary, and the author forgotten. As a result, writing credits typically were either absent or assigned to producers or directors. Scholars have explored this early issue, identifying gender bias as a “possible” cause. Jane M. Gaines in “Anonymity: Uncredited and Unknown in Early Cinema” sees the “anonymity” issue prior to 1911 as affecting both players and screen writers. Fan and trade magazines, she explains, eventually called for the crediting of players, but not writers. Though she does not argue for gender as a key factor in early anonymity, she admits that “In the first two decades of the century, anonymous is almost synonymous with the ‘woman’ writer.” Holliday, however, makes this issue the centerpiece of her 1995 dissertation, Hollywood’s Modern Women: Screenwriting, Work Culture, and Feminism, 1910-1940. Uncredited status was linked to women, she argues, because most of the early amateur/freelance screen writers were women, and freelancers were usually not credited. The link between gender and crediting bears further study. This problem only intensified as women took on full-time careers as writers.\n\nBy the mid-teens, the scenario started to take shape as something more than an idea implemented on set by a director. Women contributed to this developing craft by writing more detailed scenarios and instructing on the art itself. Among those women who actively wrote original or adapted scenarios, or both, were Zoë Akins, Hetty Gray Baker, Clara Beranger, Catherine Carr, Russian-born Sonya Levien, Loos, Macpherson, Marion, June Mathis, Bess Meredyth, and Eve Unsell. Jane Murfin adapted her own plays or wrote original scenarios, and Edith M. Kennedy is mentioned in the online AFI catalogue as a story contributor, scenarist, and adapter. Many of these women also advised prospective writers on the continually expanding scenario format. Their advice, which appeared in interviews and in their own written manuals, articles, and books, emphasized the importance of picturizing the material. Carr in The Art of Photoplay Writing (1914) asserts the need to visualize an action and even an emotion. This, she says, will produce “a human interest story.” Mathis in The Photo-Play Journal in 1917 explains, “In your mind’s eye you must visualize your plot, just as you would stand on a mountain-top and gaze at beautiful scenery surrounding you. You must visualize your characters…You must see your characters.” Marguerite Bertsch in her book How to Write for Moving Pictures (1917) also provides detailed descriptions of what goes into a scenario and models for aspiring writers. Scenarios, she explains, must include a title, the number of reels, a one paragraph synopsis, a cast, a list of scenes, a list of props, and a detailed summary of each scene including its setting, character action, and maybe some dialogue. By 1920 Loos and John Emerson in How to Write Photoplays were telling prospective writers to add descriptive subtitles and visual aids for the director, like telegrams or letters. Writing for the screen had evolved well beyond the initial story ideas or plot summaries.\n\nThe need to bridge the gap between page and screen and to include the business end of film production led to further changes in the scenario and to the birth of the continuity or shooting script. Women again were on the frontlines. Janet Staiger, in “Blueprints for Feature Films: Hollywood’s Continuity Scripts,” argues that between 1908 and 1917 the increase in film length (more reels) and the desire for well-made films with narrative fluidity resulted in a shift prior to production “from the scenario script to the continuity script.” In “Dividing Labor for Production Control: Thomas Ince and the Rise of the Studio System,” Staiger explains that continuities added the following to a scenario: director, cast and actors, locations, detailed mise-en-scene, intertitle placement, shooting schedule, budget, and distribution plan. Women, like Beranger, Sada Cowan, Beulah Marie Dix, and Meredyth, were among the many continuity writers. However, it was Mathis and Ince at Metro who developed continuity scripts as the backbone of production. According to Lewis Jacobs “they can be credited with the make-up of continuity as we know it today.”\n\nWomen also penned titles well before the continuity script came into play and instructed on the aesthetic of this new practice. Among the first title writers were women like Lenore Coffee, Katharine Hilliker, Loos, and Dorothy Yost. As Bertsch explains in her 1917 how-to book, title writing provides information on action, sets, and character emotion, and includes character dialogue, the latter a recent addition. She even advises on the art of title writing: “We must seek in our subtitles that harmony with our picture which causes them to heighten the action, bring out or express its underlying meaning or atmosphere;–all in that unobtrusive way which makes them part and parcel of the effect in toto.” Titling was a natural transition from story writing for women like Loos. As she notes in Kiss Hollywood Good-By (1974), Griffith shelved many of her early scenarios because they contained written dialogue. He believed that “people don’t go to the movies to read.” He changed his mind when he saw the reception for her titled 1916 His Picture in the Papers. As story, scenario, and title writer, Loos witnessed all aspects of the developing craft. According to her 1968 interview with Kevin Brownlow, Loos was Biograph’s scenario department.\n\nAs screen writing was codified as a respected profession, women were represented in all areas of writing in all the major studios. Epes Winthrop Sargent in his 1914 The Moving Picture World article, “The Literary Side of Pictures,” notes the following women writers and their studios: Baker (Bosworth), Carr (Vitagraph and North American), Beta Breuil (Vitagraph), Peggy O’Neil (Vitagraph), Bertsch (Vitagraph), Maibel Heikes Justice (Selig), and Mary Fuller (Edison). According to John William Kellette that same year, Elizabeth Lonergan had worked at Biograph, Kalem, and Majestic. Marion also was starting out at this time. By 1914 she was involved in all aspects of production as Lois Weber’s assistant at Bosworth. She then moved briefly to the smaller Balboa in 1915 hoping to write, finally settling in at Famous Players where she began scripting for Pickford. Sought after for her writing skills, Marion worked throughout the 1920s for a number of companies, including Norma Talmadge Productions, Goldwin Pictures (eventually Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), and Fox Films. Macpherson, who acted before she took to writing in 1915, regularly contributed stories and adaptations for Jesse L. Lasky, prompting Alice Martin in 1916 to call her the “left half of Cecil de Mille’s brain.” By 1919 Unsell had already worked with Pathé, Kalem, Universal, Metro, Triumph, and Famous Players-Lasky, according to a writer with the initials M.H.C. in The Picture Show. And a 1923 Photoplay article, “How Twelve Famous Women Scenario Writers Succeeded in This Profession of Unlimited Opportunity and Reward,” lists Beranger, Ouida Bergère, Cowan, Dix, Marion Fairfax, Loos, Marion, Mathis, Murfin, Olga Printzlau, Margaret Turnbull, and Unsell as actively working in the industry. The article notes that these women “have caught the trick of writing and understand the picture mind.” Fan magazines found women’s accomplishments noteworthy, as companies jockeyed for their skills.\n\nWomen’s readiness to handle the complex art of writing for the screen is not surprising. Most career women joined the field from acting and/or related professions. Bergère began as a stage actor, and Beranger, Marion, and Printzlau were newspaper and/or magazine writers. Novelists and playwrights included Dix, Murfin, Turnbull, and Unsell. Justice was a fiction writer, Marian Lee Patterson a magazine writer, and Baker a law librarian. Carolyn Lowry in her 1920 First One Hundred Noted Men and Women of the Screen notes that Fairfax was a stage actor and dramatist, Mathis a stage actor and magazine fiction writer, and Weber a soprano and stage actor. Loos was also a stage actor, a profession that bored her so much she started writing film plots. Adele S. Buffington was a cashier at a movie house prior to writing horse operas at Fox, and Isabel Johnston was a journalist and book editor before writing for Vitagraph. English fiction writer Elinor Glyn was recruited by Famous Players-Lasky in 1920 to write original film stories and to supervise their production. Scottish-born writer Lorna Moon was living in Minneapolis as a journalist when she was recruited by Cecil B. DeMille. Canadian-born Nell Shipman was a stage actress before writing scenarios and starting her own company in the US where she produced, directed, and wrote wilderness films. And French-born Alice Guy Blaché was a secretary for Gaumont in France before moving to the US in 1907 and starting her own company, Solax, in 1910. Here she wrote, directed, and supervised productions. Women like Shipman and Guy Blaché found an early control in the industry because they could write, direct, and produce.\n\nInfluencing the Story\n\nIn addition to shaping the form of their craft, women influenced its content. Writing for the screen quickly emerged as a female art form, written by women for women. By 1910, 40% of the working class audience was female, according to Kathy Peiss, and company heads were well aware they had to meet the needs of this demographic. To do so, they turned to the popular literary marketplace, and the romantic comedies, romantic dramas, and melodramas that had gained popularity among female readers in the previous century. These female-centered literary narratives were penned mostly by women and focused on women’s social concerns as girlfriends, wives, and mothers. Film companies hired women to write and adapt such stories for the screen. E. Ann Kaplan in “Mothering, Feminism and Representation: The Maternal in Melodrama and the Woman’s Film 1910-1940” identifies some of these films collectively as the “woman’s film.” Unlike the maternal melodrama which speaks to both the male and female spectator, she explains, “the woman’s film more specifically addresses the female spectator.” The common belief of the time was that women were uniquely suitable for writing the kinds of stories a female audience demanded. As Gary Carey explains in his study of Loos, women writers were seen as “more attuned than men to turning out the kitsch melodramas and hot-house romances that dominated the run-of-the mill Hollywood product of the period.” Even women writers acknowledged their innate ability to deal with stories of love and marriage. In a 1918 Motion Picture World article, Beranger asserts that domestic stories, love triangles, and human interest narratives are “more ably handled by woman than men because of the thorough understanding our sex has of these matters.” In a 1925 article in The Film Daily, Mathis declares that women know best the female mind and, as a result, “seem to succeed in the careful, fine detail work of scenario writing.” Among the women who delivered on these popular stories were Frederica Sagor who scripted romantic comedies, Mrs. Sidney Drew (Lucille McVey) who penned domestic comedies along with her husband, and Loos who was known for her slapstick comedies in the early years and romantic comedies throughout her career. Coffee, Julia Crawford Ivers, and Marion wrote the intensely emotional dramas and melodramas. There was no shortage of women writers in Hollywood willing to turn out the “writing to gender” studios demanded of them.\n\nWhat women wrote, however, frequently straddled both Victorian and modern sensibilities. On the one hand, women in these films were stock characters, recognizable types: the virgin, the flapper, the working girl, the sacrificing wife/mother, the reformer, and the deceived/seduced woman. They were positioned in the social order as (potential) girlfriends, wives, and/or mothers who struggled to find and keep a man or to survive difficult domestic situations. Many, however, were also independent-minded women who negotiated for freedom inside of conventional relationships, sought unconventional relationships (across classes, for example), and tried to make the best of difficult relationships. Their stories showcase the tensions surrounding the gendered expectations of women in both the public and private sphere. These edgy women are found in such films as Beranger’s Miss Lulu Bett (1921), Ruth Ann Baldwin’s The Marriage of William Ashe (1921), Marion’s The Wind (1928), and Glyn’s It (1927). Berenger’s Lulu challenges the convention that women, unlike men, are solely defined by their marital status. Baldwin’s Lady Kitty publishes political satire and poses nude for a charity event. And Marion’s Letty struggles for dignity in an abusive relationship. Glyn’s Betty Lou is a working girl and a flapper, wielding both social and sexual power. Higashi argues that the working woman status of the time shaped the female characters in these Cinderella-themed stories. Careers led to marriage even for those women not actively seeking a partner. Betty Lou, however, is also a flapper. As such, she represents what Higashi calls a new style of femininity: rebellious, sexually precocious, and capable of male friendships. Refusing to wait for a man, Betty Lou openly initiates a romance with her boss. Complications ensue as a result of class differences and Betty Lou’s brazen personality, but the two eventually find common ground. While marriage is mentioned only briefly, this is the assumed next step in their relationship. The pull of marital expectations remained strong in these films, even for sexually-liberated flappers like Betty Lou.\n\nSome women writers avoided stories of love and marriage by focusing on female characters who operate outside of the domestic sphere, though these stories frequently contained a romantic subplot. Grace Cunard and Gauntier created girl adventurers. Cunard, in collaboration with her husband Francis Ford, specialized in the female-lead adventure serials for Universal: Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery (1914) and The Broken Coin (1915). Gauntier’s action-packed stories feature spunky, athletic women engaging in death-defying exploits. Her Girl Spy (1908-1911) is based on the exploits of Belle Boyd, a Confederate spy in the Civil War. Francke argues that Gauntier’s choice of genre was an open challenge to the male action writer: “Gauntier had established that a woman writer was as adept with the thrills and spills of action-adventure genres as her male colleagues.” Gauntier does marry her girl spy off at the end of the series, but she admits in the November 1928 installment of “Blazing the Trail” that she did so because of the physical toll of doing her own stunts. In addition, her brains had been “sucked dry of any more adventures for the intrepid young woman.” Betty Burbridge, Carr, Baldwin, and Buffington also worked in another action arena: the western. Beranger took on the thriller in The Bedroom Window (1924) about a female mystery writer who brings her talents to a murder case. And Shipman’s women meet the challenges of wilderness life in such films as The Girl from God’s Country (1921) and The Grub-Stake (1923). According to Kay Armatage, Shipman’s heroine is a blend of vulnerable femininity and unbridled heroism which “allows her to resist conventional narrative inscriptions of the woman protagonist as victimized and rescued.” Both films were the work of her newly-formed Nell Shipman Productions, which she moved to Idaho in part because of Hollywood’s continual challenge to the kinds of stories Shipman wanted to make.\n\nIn addition, women tackled controversial social issues or broadened the narrative scope of their work to include a focus on male protagonists. Fairfax’s The Honor of His House (1918) and Macpherson’s The Godless Girl (1928) deal with alcoholism and juvenile delinquency respectively. Writer/director Weber devoted her career to making films that called attention to social problems. Where Are My Children? (1916) explores reproductive rights, while both Shoes (1916) and The Blot (1921) grapple with poverty and its impact on women. Dorothy Davenport Reid also focused on the social problem film, confronting drug addiction in Human Wreckage (1923) in which she also starred. As with some of her other films, however, writing credit remains uncertain. Among the writers who expanded the narrative focus of their films were Mathis, who adapted Frank Norris’ novel McTeague (Greed, 1924) about a dentist in the Midwest, and the epic Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925). Refusing to be labelled a woman’s writer, Dix regularly wrote films for male stars like her original The Call of the East (1917), starring popular Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa. Dix’s uncompromising approach to writing in Hollywood bears further study.\n\nThough some women may have challenged the “writing to gender” expected of them, they were still part of a collective codified in fan magazines as conventional working women. Authors were eager to assure readers that women could be “feminine” and still work in Hollywood. According to Photoplay’s “How Twelve Famous Women Scenario Writers Succeeded,” these were “normal, regular women…not short haired advanced feminists, not fadists.” Speaking of Macpherson, Doris Delvigne writes in the 1920 Motion Picture Magazine that “There’s nothing masculine about this little French-Scotch girl who has interested the dramatic world with her craftsmanship. She’s not a blue-stocking with emancipated ideas, nor has her contact with the biggest men in the motion picture world given her that swaggering independence which is supposed to adhere to begoggled authors. She is the most utterly feminine thing you ever beheld.” Of Unsell, M.H.C. writes, “She is so womanly–without the slightest trace of ‘pose’ or ‘literariness,’ and gives one a ‘homey’ feeling at once.” And Aline Carter in the 1921 Motion Picture Magazine praises Weber’s ability to produce, write, and edit without giving up a home life: “… she is the original woman who loves to linger over the table and ask for recipes.” These popular magazines reminded the female audience that writing for the screen was women’s work.\n\nIn some cases, however, this ideologically-coded image contrasted sharply with the woman writer’s professional or personal life. According to Francke, Dix was a “self-confessed bluestocking”; she dressed informally on set and smoked with the crew. Her daughter’s biography notes that Dix openly refused female lead stories, disapproving of the Hollywood stereotypes of women and the fact that female-centered stories tended to deal with lighter topics. Levien’s biographer, Larry Ceplair, explains that before her film work she expressed radical political and social views, particularly as a writer for the Woman’s Journal, the voice of the suffragette movement. He acknowledges, however, that she had difficulty reconciling her film work with these radical views. Adela Rogers St. Johns, a Hollywood journalist, story consultant, screen writer, and author of source material, wrote about both conventional and unconventional women. Throughout her life St. Johns confronted gendered views of men and women, prompting sports journalist Mel Durslag to comment in her 1988 obituary that “She was a kind of wild, uninhibited woman before feminism came in.” In silent era Hollywood women negotiated a fragile balance between their public and private lives.\n\nAmong the women who made films outside the Hollywood system were African-American filmmakers Tressie Souders, Eloyce King Patrick Gist, and Zora Neale Hurston. As noted earlier, careers for women in Hollywood were pretty much accessible only to white women, particularly middle class white women. There is no evidence, however, that Souders, Gist, or Hurston even desired to work in Hollywood. Very little is known about the making or distribution of director/writer Souders’ feature, A Woman’s Error (1922), which was produced by the Afro-American Film Exhibitors Company in Kansas City. More is known about Gist and Hurston who made films that furthered their political, religious, and/or social agendas. As Gloria J. Gibson writes in “Cinematic Foremothers: Zora Neale Hurston and Eloyce King Patrick Gist,” Hurston and Gist recognized the impact of the motion picture camera. Gist and husband James made highly moralistic, non-theatrical films that accompanied their religious services. Hell Bound Train (ca 1929-1930), which she retitled and orated, consists of a series of religious allegories, while the short Verdict Not Guilty (1930-1933) tells the story of a woman pleading for entrance to heaven despite her efforts to “prevent” motherhood, a reference to either birth control or abortion. Similarly, African-American folklorist and novelist Hurston’s ethnographic films–Logging (1928), Children’s Games (1929), and Baptism (1929)–chronicle the daily life of southern black culture. Little is known of the purpose of Hurston’s filmmaking other than to present her research in a pictorial format. In fact, while black male filmmakers of the period have been the subject of extensive research, there has been very little scholarship on the work of black women filmmakers. Yet, as Gibson has argued, such women made their “mark with a camera.”\n\nNavigating Industry Problems\n\nThe same could be said for those women working inside of the Hollywood system, but by the 1920s, a top-down model of studio production resulted in a series of ongoing problems, including both threats to creative autonomy and continuing struggles with low salaries. Marion and Pickford were frustrated particularly with the overly sentimental plots expected of them. According to Marion in Off With Their Heads: A Serio-Comic Tale of Hollywood, she and Pickford were fed up with Pickford’s “eternal child” character and the endless happy endings studios demanded. She and Lillian Gish experienced similar constraints while working on The Wind. When told she had to soften the ending of the film, Marion and some of the crew “created our own storm, to no avail.” Also troublesome was the increasingly complex assembly line of production that resulted in a shooting script that bore little resemblance to the original scenario. Though promised pre-production control, Glyn found it difficult to shepherd her work through with minimal interference. Like many literary writers in Hollywood in the 1920s, her work was severely altered. According to her son’s biography, “It was their names and not their literary abilities which were required by the studios.” In a 1923 New York Times interview entitled “Scenario Writers Must Find Theme,” Mathis notes that when she first started out, she had to fight for her ideas. Though she gradually gained control of the production process, she still faced opposition: “… if a director does not want to make a production in a particular way, he needs a healthy guard to force him.” In addition to struggles with creative autonomy, writers in the growing story departments also grappled with low salaries. Though top writers like Marion, Loos, and Macpherson eventually commanded good salaries, the profession as a whole did not. Marion admits in Off With Their Heads, that “scenario writers were pushed into the background, poorly paid, their talent unexploited.” Coffee was particularly outspoken on the issue of equitable pay and suffered the consequences. In the 1920s, Louis B. Mayer fired her for demanding too much money, rehiring Coffee five years later. In the interim she found work with DeMille. The career woman in Hollywood was experiencing the growing pains of a changing industry.\n\nIn addition, crediting problems continued well into the 1920s, even though freelance submissions, rarely credited in the early days, had fallen. When multiple writers in the newly-formed story departments worked on the scenario and the final shooting script, crediting frequently acknowledged only one author, and not always the major contributor. Sometimes the last person who had a hand in the script, even only minimally, was the one receiving screen credit. Often writers who rescued weak scenarios, did not get acknowledged at all. Coffee, known as the fixer-upper for saving troubled productions through rewrites and titling, admits in an interview with Patrick McGilligan that she did not always get credit for such work. She recalls one time in the early days of sound when she had written additional dialogue on a film. Another writer phoned her and wanted her to give up the credit. She told him “I’ve heard the age of chivalry is gone, and now I believe it.” Coffee then hung up the phone. Sometimes adapters, particularly early and lesser-known writers, found their screen credit eclipsed by the author of the original works. They also were forgotten in film reviews, again in favor of the author of the original work. Even Fairfax, well-known in the business by the 1920s, experienced this problem. In 1926 she wrote and produced The Blonde Saint, from a Stephen French Whitman novel. However the only writing credit listed on the BFI copy is Whitman’s. Reviews in Bioscope and the New York Times also ignore her authorship in favor of Whitman’s. Staiger believes that the “division of labor” resulting from the growing corporatization of the industry accounted for this threat to authorship.\n\nWomen, particularly those who had long careers in the industry, handled these problems with autonomy and authorship in a number of ways. They formed writer/director and writer/writer partnerships. They also became writing department and company heads, joined or formed independent units or companies, held multiple positions as writers, directors, and producers, and organized writing guilds. Marion quickly discovered that the only way to maintain complete control over her script was to be the writer and director. The next best thing was to be part of writer/director partnerships. These included Loos and Emerson (co-writer), Meredyth and Wilfred Lucas (co-writer), and Macpherson and DeMille. Among the husband and wife writing partnerships, in addition to Loos and Emerson, were Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew. Early teams included Anne and Bannister Merwin at Edison and Maria A. Wing and William E. Wing at Biograph and Selig, though little is known about Anne and Maria’s contributions. Some writers were also scenario editors: Breuil and Bertsch at Vitagraph, Carr at North American, and Baker at Bosworth. Both Marion and Fairfax formed their own companies: Frances Marion Pictures and Marion Fairfax Productions. Gauntier held multiple positions at Kalem–writer, actor, producer, director, critic, scenario editor, and studio manager–and founded her own company Gene Gauntier Feature Players with Sydney Olcott. Lillian Case Russell started a film company with her husband. And Mathis headed the script unit at Metro; she also was a producer at Goldwyn and First National. The collaborative, egalitarian nature of their work and their presence in the upper echelons meant they had a hand in the final product. In addition, women were tackling inequities as active members of societies and leagues launched to protect authorship and autonomy. Baker and Weber were among the founding members of the Photoplay Authors’ League, according to the Mariposa Gazette in 1914. Finally, women’s friendships helped them navigate a continually changing industry. According to Marsha McCreadie in The Women Who Write the Movies (1994), “there seems to have been an informal but strong and highly effect networking system among women.” Marion confirms this in an interview with De Witt Bodeen. St. Johns helped her secure the meeting with Weber that launched her career. By the end of the silent period, women were hiring each other and teaching newcomers the business.\n\nThe women writer’s dominance in the industry, however, virtually disappeared with the coming of sound. The industry that afforded them jobs and sometimes lucrative careers had altered drastically. Maher argues that the transformation of Hollywood into a business with both a national and international market and a centralized producer system pushed women from positions of power and left little room for both the independent and collaborative working culture women were used to. She notes, however, that such changes affected predominantly producers, directors, and editors, as women screen writers continued working into sound. Some women writers, like Akins, Buffington, Burbridge, Coffee, Dix, Lillie Hayward, Adelaide Heilbron, Levien, Loos, Lovett, Marion, Meredyth, Murfin, Marion Orth, and St. Johns, did make the transition into sound, but they faced a severely altered professional environment. Marion quickly learned that writers now were “like Penelope–knitting their stories all day just to have somebody else unravel their work by night.” In a 1939 letter to Alice Kauser, Akins expresses her frustration with the movie business, noting that writing what one chooses had become “a rare privilege.” Those writing from home found their services were no longer wanted as both story ideas and scenarios now emerged from story departments. Drew and Williams, who made names for themselves in serials, discovered the form no longer desirable. Though long out of the business by the coming of sound, Gauntier noted in a 1924 letter to Photoplay that changes in the industry had made it impossible for her to continue working. Speaking of her final years in the business after her company folded in 1914, she writes, “Conditions had changed so. I went with Universal for a short time, when the new plant, Universal City, was opened. After being master of all I surveyed, I could not work under the new conditions.” Once a dominating force in the industry, women writers had become workers in a well-oiled machine. They were quickly fading from the public limelight.\n\nWomen who wrote for the screen in the silent era, however, did leave their mark. They were a significant part of concretizing the language of their craft. They legitimized writing for the screen as a new medium at a time when screen writing was not a discipline and only beginning to be a business. And they offered constructive views on the art of photoplay writing. However, due to the assembly line of production, the absence of pre-production shooting scripts in the early days, and the lack of systematic crediting throughout the period, the extent and nature of women’s contribution in all areas of writing continue to be important subjects for researchers. There is still much work to be done on how women distinguished themselves as writers, sometimes resisting the formulaic Hollywood model of storytelling. Studies also need to explore how they struggled to establish authorship in the wake of industry changes, and how and why some women writers adjusted to these changes. The role of the independent filmmaker/writer, like Fairfax, Hurston, and Gist bears further study. Finally, scholarship needs to interrogate the intersection of social and economic factors that contributed to the woman writer’s eventual loss of power in an industry they helped forge.\n\nSee also:Hetty Gray Baker, Ruth Ann Baldwin, Clara Beranger, Ouida Bergère, Marguerite Bertsch, Alice Guy Blaché, Beta Breuil, Adele S.

We set out to prove that women were not just screen actresses in the silent era, in the two decades before the advent of synchronized sound motion pictures. Carrying over the impetus from the 1970s, we looked first for evidence that they had worked as directors but in the process we found that they had been not just directors. Women’s participation in the first two decades was both deeper and wider than previously thought. In addition to costume designer, as one might expect, the researchers on this project found, as one might not expect, camera operators as well as exhibitors (theatre owner and/or theatre manager). In her groundbreaking business history of women filmmakers in the silent era, Karen Mahar adds the colorist and the film joiner as well as the supervisor and the executive producer to this list.1 At first, many jobs were not necessarily gender-typed, she says. In the first decade, however, some departments became exclusively organized along gender lines, with editing or joining being the most visibly gendered work.\n\nYet the most comprehensive overview of the industry, Business Woman, in 1923 listed twenty-nine different jobs that women held (in addition to actress), including that of typist, stenographer, secretary to the stars and executive secretary, telephone operator, hairdresser, seamstress, costume designer, milliner, reader, script girl, scenarist, cutter, film retoucher, film splicer, laboratory worker, set designer and set dresser, librarian, artist, title writer, publicity writer, plasterer molder, casting director, musician, film editor, department manager, director, and producer.2\n\nWhen Were Motion Pictures Silent?\n\nScholars date the advent of motion pictures from the first public Lumière Company cinématographe exhibition in Paris, France, on December 28, 1895, and in the United States, from the Edison Company’s New York City kinetoscope premiere on April 4, 1896.3 Yet, as Mahar has pointed out, the first years were defined by competition over equipment patents, the realm of men (2006, 25). The best way of explaining early opportunities for women is to first think of the growth spurt represented by the US nickelodeon boom, 1906–1909, which meant increased demand for short, one-reel films to screen at these storefront theatres. The influx of the women we are tracking begins around 1907—the year Gene Gauntier wrote a scenario at the Kalem Company based on Ben Hur, Florence Lawrence took a role in the Edison Company’s Daniel Boone; or, Pioneer Days in America, and Alice Guy Blaché, married three days, set sail for New York from Paris, as each recalls in a memoir (Gauntier Oct. 1928, 184; Lawrence 1914, 40; Slide, 1986a, 60-61).\n\nAlthough 1927–1928 marks the official transition to sound years in the US, many of the titles we list were issued in both silent and sound versions.4 Titles after 1928 are included for other reasons. First, experimental and documentary work expand the definition of “silent film” because in the late 1920s and into the 1930s low-budget work was often shot silent with a nonsynchronous soundtrack added later, if at all. This allows us to consider,"
