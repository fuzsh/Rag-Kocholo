        "text": "It’s not a movie that’s breaking new ground for gay films or anything, but it was still very sweet and nice-natured with really good male characters, gay and straight. The hiking trail they do looked stunning, I had no idea anything like that even existed in England. A nice addition to the gay films of 2023.\n\nTHAT'S SO GAY LIST\n\nA simple lgbt story and a love story but done well, mates is a nicely shot film with a nice nature location, really shows the beautiful side of the UK. Its a chill, laid back film with not a lot of drama but character development amd personalities I liked hanging with. The only one I didn't like was mark, very negative and full of bad vibes. The music was also very chill. I like hanging with these guys, the acting was fine but the exchanges got a little bit awkward some times. But it ended well and is appropriate for a Sunday afternoon, very cozy amd chill.\n\nI suppose I would feel somewhat guilty for being honest about how bad this really was on a technical level, from the stilted and distant acting to the out-of-touch script to whatever the hell the plot was supposed to be.\n\nBut the truth is, I didn't dislike the very low-budget Mates. I watched it with a friend and it made for a lot of unintentional laughter, so it obviously wasn't a dull experience. I could at least say the director kept me engaged with all of the unpredictability of roughly sketched out characters, none of whom seemed even remotely gay or romantically interested in one another.\n\nIMDb describes this film as \"An unsuspecting man becomes the target of another guy's efforts at seduction.\" Yet, other sites are all sweet and positive.\n\nConnor was not unsuspecting. He was gay but just afraid to admit it, especially around his other friends. His friends also knew. EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING KNOWS. Adam knows as well.\n\nThe only good characters in this were Adam and Adam's Dad. The script didn't go anywhere.\n\nA veritably bad gay film that I genuinely enjoyed. Give me a cute ending and all will be forgiven. The story was dry af and the acting was horrid, but I guess I was still invested because I saw facets of myself in all of the characters: the overly clingy gay, the socially awkward orthorexic, the sexually ambiguous pushover, the cynical dad, even the annoying dudebro looool.\n\nI really hate it when such movies have an open ending. A number of open endings, actually. A presumably straight guy is left with a kiss, and a less-presumably-straight-guy-towards-the-end goes away. An unfinished walk across the countryside.\n\nIt has several traits of a budget independent gay-themed movie, but done technically very nicely. Clear sharp picture, nice lighting (thanks to mostly daylight scenes), good acting. The plot even makes you almost deaf to the loudish guitar soundtrack. The latter blends in nicely into the hiking."
