        "meta_description": "This chapter deals with the way movies approach and depict international law. Both cinema and law belong to an imaginary realm. The methods of law are conceptualization and action. The methods of movies are representations and dreams. It is therefore difficult for the cinema to dramatize international law, with the notable exceptions of criminal trials and war. It is noteworthy that the way a particular movie depicts international law will often depend on the country of production. For instance, American movies frequently resemble propaganda – soft or hard – but, at the same time, American cinema is also able to severely criticize US policies. British movies often convey a kind of imperial nostalgia, even in a parochial way. French ones are willingly self-deprecating, sometimes in a farcical way.",
