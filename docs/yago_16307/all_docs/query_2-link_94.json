        "text": "The surname Verhoeff was first found in Belgium, where the name became noted for its many branches in the region, each house acquiring a status and influence which was envied by the princes of the region. The name was first recorded in Brabant, an ancient duchy from 1190 onward. Within the province Brussels and Louvain are the major cities and the smaller Clabecq, Tubize and Wavre towns. Other towns include Vilvorde, Tirlemont and Hal. In their later history the surname became a power unto themselves and were elevated to the ranks of nobility as they grew into a most influential family.\n\nEarly History of the Verhoeff family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Verhoeff research. Another 92 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1702 and 1840 are included under the topic Early Verhoeff History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible."
