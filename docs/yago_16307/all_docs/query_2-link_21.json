        "text": "The fact this film doesn't have a review on here shows how deep the ghetto of Dutch cinema can be.\n\nIn short, twice Golden Calf award winning film from 1980, is a period-drama masterpiece. It covers a true event from the late 1920s, when an anarchist and highly-skilled brickwork pointer enters a relationship with the wife of a friend who abandons her children in the process.\n\nThe affair leads to a dramatic and terrible conclusion.\n\npardon the clich√©, but every frame looks like a classic Dutch painting, the story is compelling, well told, and the cast are excellent. Wonderful film."
