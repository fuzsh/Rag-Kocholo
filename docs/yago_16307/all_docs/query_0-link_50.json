        "text": "Epic Games have revealed a price increase to Unreal Engine, but only for developers outside the gaming industry. As shown in developer ImmatureGamerX‚Äôs social media video, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney mentioned that industries outside game dev will only be able to access Unreal Engine through a seat-based enterprise software licensing plan. This includes devs using Unreal Engine for film, TV, automotive, and other industries. Sweeney mentioned the pricing model will not be ‚Äúunusually expensive or unusually inexpensive‚Äù, with similar pricing plans to Maya or Photoshop. This comes after Epic Games revealed a large amount of layoffs last week as well as Unity‚Äôs sequence of events following its change with the Runtime Fee program. Given Epic Games are looking to address the ‚Äúfinancial problem‚Äù the company has, it seems like a better PR & marketing move to let users know this early so they can best prepare for what to expect in the future. Follow #MoreMark for #Business content in #Gaming, #Esports, and #Creators!\n\nBlog Post #1 The gaming industry as we know it, is evolving. Though what I want to say about it from my perspective is this year was probably the most complex and insane year we've ever seen. Think about it. The Pattern has always been the same. New year new video games, E3, twitch con, big triple A titles being released on specific dates over the course of the year, though this year what happened? in September we saw many big well known titles dropping in such a close time frame, E3 is no more, Microsoft bought Activision blizzard, overwatch is taking a big step into the competitive aspect of their game, the amount of layoffs that's happened. and it all happened on this very year and in such a small time frame. Again some might say this is normal but just look back at all the years that have passed and think about the patterns. Then take a moment to think deeply about this year and everything that happened. What is your take on this year? do you have an idea on what may have caused this year to be the craziest yet? please let me know. #gamingindustry #gamingcommunity\n\nAt Unreal Fest today Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced their intention to begin establishing licensing terms for the use of Unreal Engine in non gaming sectors. For those not familiar, Unreal operates under a revenue sharing model with game developers; but those using the engine in other capacities get what amounts to a free ride. The details of the new licensing are incredibly vague today with nothing other than the announcement to really go off. Exactly who and what it may apply to not even clear. But as one of the consumers of Unreal in non-gaming, I have to say I view this as fundamentally positive step. As someone who‚Äôs negotiated with Enterprise Software suppliers for some decades, it‚Äôs actually a little scary to be building a business around a vendor who doesn‚Äôt charge for their product. Vendor lock in kinda works both ways. If your business vertical is an empty line on the suppliers P&L, then that‚Äôs a real easy one for someone to draw a line through. Great care will have to be taken by Epic to ensure they do not accidentally inhibit the adoption of Unreal in emerging technology markets. That said, these markets need to be attractive and viable to Epic as well. Contracts and license agreements can often be viewed as a negative. But they can also be ways to build relationships between organizations based on mutually accepted obligations & understandings. I want Epic to continue building tooling in my space for a long time to come. And I have maaaaany opinions on how they should be doing that. If securing that commitment from Epic means entering into licensing terms for their engine then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ok. Let‚Äôs have the conversation. https://lnkd.in/ga8CHrxX\n\nMarketing Officer Log, Stardate 57931.4. Today, working alongside a familiar yet new crew, I was reminded of the profound sense of exploration and discovery that defines our endeavours. Like the intrepid voyages of the Starship Resolute, our venture into this uncharted territory ‚Äì the launch of our game on Steam ‚Äì has demanded ingenuity, collaboration, and a willingness to push beyond the boundaries of the familiar. The camaraderie and creative spark within the Dramatic Labs crew mirrored the best of Starfleet. We boldly charted narrative courses and encountered challenges along the way. Each hurdle overcome was a testament to the collective spirit of this crew. This experience has served as a powerful reminder of why I hold such a deep affection for this industry and has reminded me why I‚Äôm here. Through the power of games, we have the opportunity not only to entertain, but to forge new worlds, ignite imaginations, and boldly take players where they‚Äôve never gone before.
