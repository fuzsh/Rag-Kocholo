        "text": "To animate something is to give it the illusion of having life. The materials animators “bring to life” are unlimited. This year LET’S GET ANIMATED includes a whiteboard that expresses an evolving adoration between two people on a ball team, an ocean filled with creatures that look familiar in shape but whose composition is in opposition to their environment, and a textile-designed dinosaur that swallows a pathogen with a personality!

(2019 / 9 mins / Colombia / dir María Teresa Salcedo Montero/ animation / in Spanish w/English subtitles)\n\nNew England Premiere\n\nTESOROS (Spanish for “treasures”) is the wonderful new film by director Maria Novaro (DANZON). Refreshingly told from the children’s perspective, it examines topics from fanciful ideas about finding treasure and exploring new places to social anxiety and fitting in, and is a charming window into the heart of a child’s world.\n\nThe action kicks off when a family moves to a small town on Mexico’s Pacific Coast and find it hard to assimilate because they are different from the rest of the community. They are not excited about the new place or the new school, but siblings Dylan and Andrea join the local school and slowly settle in, making new friends. Soon, Dylan notices his new city has an uncanny resemblance to a treasure map and daydreams about finding treasure left behind by Sir Francis Drake. He convinces the entire class that treasure is underfoot, and gets everyone to participate in the search.\n\nThe slow days of living by the coast, loving families and burgeoning friendships between the children are the real story here.There are many vignettes of children with their kin, all different, showcasing the many configurations of loving families, and many scenes illustrating the peaceful Mexican lifestyle.\n\nNovaro elicits relaxed and natural acting from the children. Some of the older protagonists are in their teens, yet the audience feels part of their group, as if you knew them. The overall tone is reminiscent of one’s own childhood, with some dull moments idly passing by, including those grueling days at school, contrasted by very exciting times with friends, running around and chasing after…something. TESOROS takes us on an enchanting voyage that ends with a find far more precious than a lost pirate’s treasure trove.\n\nTwo orphaned siblings (ten-year-old Pari and her brother, eight-year-old Chotu) leave an abusive aunt in search for medical help to bring back Chotu’s eyesight. In a mystical tale they encounter the best and the worst of Indian society on their search for a Bollywood star who offers financial assistance. During their quest you can feel the heat, smell the curries, enjoy the colors and music from the other side of the world.\n\nWinner BEST FILM Generation KPlus Berlin Crystal Bear 2015\n\nReading the title might make you clap hands with your neighbor in time to the well-known chant. This wonderful documentary explores this rhythmic rite of passage, usually between young girls, in the US and around the world. Contemporary and historical footage are intertwined creating what some admiringly refer to as “hand graffiti,” “jazz of the streets” and “percussive poetry.” As it swings between games and interviews with young girls, LET’S GET THE RHYTHM has a beat; its incandescent musicality brings this hand-clapping universe to life!\n\nImagine this. Your name is Gus and you live in the most boring village in the Netherlands. You walk into your bedroom one day and there’s an actual Egyptian mummy sitting on your bed. What do you do? Well, first you jump out of your skin (of course). Then you close your eyes, count to ten, count to twenty…but it doesn’t help. The Mummy is still there!\n\nThe Mummy named Dummie (Darwishi Ur-Atum Msamaki Minkabh Ishaq Eboni) died over 4,000 years ago when he was only ten years old. But thanks to the magic of the golden scarab and one lucky lightening strike, he has come back to life as a mummy in a very changed world.\n\nGus and his father have no idea at first what to do with Dummie. Should they call a museum? The police? They decide to invite him into their family by pretending he is a cousin from Egypt who has suffered bad burns. Gus’ life changes completely as he becomes best friends with Dummie the Mummy. Gus enrolls Dummie into his school but not everybody is happy with this creepy new stranger in their midst.\n\nOne dreadful day, Dummie’s powerful golden scarab goes missing and the magic slowly fades away. Dummie falls ill and Gus and his dad fear he may die all over again. Gus must now do everything he can to find the powerful scarab. Who could have stolen it? And can Dummie be saved in time? This dilemma’s resolution brings to light the importance of tolerance, friendship and being part of a community.\n\nWickie longs to be a big, strong Viking like his father, Halvar. When Halvar is kidnapped, it’s Wickie’s brain that must save his father and not his under-developed Viking brawn. He leads the men on this swashbuckling adventure as they set off over raging oceans, tropical beaches and dangerous icy wastelands, all in pursuit of the legendary treasure of the Gods (which contains the key to his father’s release). Suspending disbelief will ensure a smile on your face. Made by Christian Ditter, director of previous PCFF crowd favorites “The Crocodiles” (PCFF 2011) and ”Crocodiles Strike Back” (PCFF 2012).\n\n“This letter is for the king… It’s vital to his country and to yours. Now that I can’t take it, you have to do it But beware. Enemies are everywhere.”\n\nWhen a dying knight speaks these words to Tiuri, pushing a mysterious letter into the adolescent’s hands, the young squire must embark on a dangerous mission to save his kingdom. Though not yet a knight, Tiuri is forced to summon the courage and cunning of a seasoned veteran to complete this quest. Through dark woods and snowy mountains, Tiuri is pursued by thieves, spies and the ruthless Red Riders, all intent on stopping him before he can reach his goal. But by never forgetting the importance of friendship and the value of keeping a promise, Tiuri learns that you don’t need a sword and shield to act with the gallantry of a knight.\n\nDirector Pieter Verhoeff brings Tiuri’s quest to the screen in true epic style. The stunning natural settings will transport viewers to a medieval world of clashing swords, daring escapes and horseback chases. Based on the book by Tonke Dragt, “The Letter for the King” is a rich and exciting adventure story that celebrates the power of honesty and friendship.\n\nThe Blue Gnomes that live in a mountain are in charge of the “magic silver” that brings sunlight to every day. The Red Gnomes are farm Gnomes with low opinions of those uppity Blues. After the magic silver is stolen by a gnome , the theft brings out the best between the two gnome groups to restore the daylight. With gnome hats to die for and a sleigh chase Tarantino would envy, this is the film that broke opening-day box-office records in Norway.\n\nWhat can be more nerve-wracking for kids than starting at a new junior high? How about starting at a haunted one?! When Eugenio, Cebola and Frida explore their future stomping grounds, they head straight into an out-of-this-world adventure involving time travel, a magic umbrella, a daring rescue and one truly terrifying teacher.\n\nAbila, 14, lives in the violent slum jungle of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya. He is a Luo – one of the many Kenyan tribes. He is smitten with Shiku, who is the same age, but she is a Kikuyu, and that is the problem. Boys and girls from different tribes are not encouraged to mix. But Abila has another problem. At the start of the film, he finds his father in a disturbing state. His mother says it’s a hangover, but Abila has a feeling there’s more going on. He finds out that his father’s soul has been stolen by a Nyawawa, a female spirit. Despite the hostility of the surroundings, Abila and Shiku set off together to save the soul of Abila’s father.\n\nYou could say that the location is the real protagonist of this film. Shot in 13 days, this film was made in Kibera, where more than one million people live and battle for survival. Its residents acted the film’s parts.\n\nThis film emerged from a workshop and benefited from production support by the famous German director Tom Tykwer. Above all, the camera work is of a level that is seldom seen in African pictures. The authentic background in combination with the outside support turned “Soul Boy” into a sparkling – and surprisingly professional-looking — short film."
