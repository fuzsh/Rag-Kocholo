        "text": "@philip_vanderveken, Frysian is the English name for Frysl√¢n or Friesland as Dutch speakers still tent call it.\n\nCalling the Fryske taal a dialect shows a little lack of knowledge of the Dutch language map. Flemish is not a dialect of Dutch either.\n\nIn general the plot shows the struggle of a small group of brothers to stay loyal to the Socialist cause, while knowing the real criminals. On the other hand being acussed by a maid that just wanted to take revenge for being rejected as a bride.\n\nAt the turn of the 20 the century Socialism was considered an outlawed actvity, so the loyalty to the cause was not so strange as it may seem now.\n\nEven if the brothers would have told the names of the real robbers, they would most likely be imprissoned for knowing them."
