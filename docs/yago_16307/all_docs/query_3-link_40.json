        "text": "LOL. This was like a Tubi-fication of Saw and Escape Room. There‚Äôs not an original idea anywhere in its DNA. The few *games* that were highlighted were semi-amusing because they were morbid inspirations from the ‚Äúdating‚Äù scene. Hands down, my favorite was the Karaoke-For-Your-Life bit, except someone else‚Äôs life was in the contestants‚Äô hands. So silly.\n\nThe actors were *fine*, just completely underdeveloped which lead me to not caring what happened to either of them. There‚Äôs this random ass shower sequence in the middle of chaos that served absolutely no purpose other than gratuitous shots of the two actors‚Äô butts. I‚Äôm serious. Both leads were also super casual about their whole ordeal by the finale, total La-Di-Da vibes.\n\nThe‚Ä¶\n\nI watched Soul Mates (2023) in theaters this evening. The storyline follows two strangers who wake up handcuffed to each other and discover they are in a game to find true love. They must go through a series of dates, and the outcome will determine someone‚Äôs fate they they know. Can the strangers work together, save lives, and maybe even fall in love in the process?\n\nThis movie is directed by Mark Gantt (A Deadly Price for Her Pretty Face) and stars Neal McDonough (Minority Report), Charles Weber (How to Get Away with Murder) and Annie Ilonzeh (Peppermint).\n\nThe storyline reminded me of a mix between Saw and Escape Room. This is one of those films where, when all the‚Ä¶\n\n\"What if Saw but a dating reality show?\" is exactly the kind of premise that I live for, especially in an age when the average Love is Blind episode already feels like the kind of demented social expEEEriment that Jigsaw might dream up. But in yet another case of people making reality television inspired horror that clearly have no interest in reality television, Soul Mates squanders this opportunity HARD right from the jump, saddling us with two poorly written characters who wake up chained together in an elaborate dungeon environment and then have to play a series of twisted games that will maybe lead to them falling in love. There are so many interesting and fun ways to take this‚Ä¶\n\nüé∂ Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me üé∂\n\nSo Escape Room, Match.com, and Scare Tactics walk into a bar‚Ä¶ and they were Soul Mates.\n\nI went into this one not expecting much, but actually loved it? It reminded me a lot of some early 2000s horror movies that I‚Äôve seen and enjoyed!\n\nCan I just say that men really be doing what Jason did, but the only difference is they get away with it (sadly)? üòÇ\n\nI loved the different rooms & challenges they had to face, especially the dinner date and the karaoke room. ‚ÄúIn The Air Tonight‚Äù AND ‚ÄúHow to Love‚Äù? ATE.\n\nWhen Jason found out he ate Liana‚Ä¶ oh that had me (and Jason) GAGGED. Although, I guess now I know that wasn‚Äôt truly the case. I guess.\n\nBonus points for including ‚ÄúHow to Love‚Äù in the credits!! Solid, fun film; it‚Äôs not for everyone, but I would certainly watch it again!"
