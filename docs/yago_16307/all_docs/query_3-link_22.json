        "text": "Soul Mates is Escape Room if it were a dating app. Directed by Mark Gantt and written by Joe Russo and Chris LaMont, the horror film opens with two people waking up in a strange place. Allison (Annie Ilonzeh) is distrustful of Jason (Charlie Weber), begging him to let her go. But he’s also a victim and trapped, which she soon learns.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Matchmaker (Neal McDonough) introduces Allison and Jason to Soul Mates. This intensive matchmaking service has a 100% success rate. The catch is the potential couple is put through hell to tear down their walls and bond over their shared trauma. The Get To Know You section, accompanied by the famed song from The King & I, is a speed round of five questions. But if the questions aren’t answered quickly enough, an innocent man will be ground to death by a wood chipper (or some similar machine). Of course, the pressure of having to save this person only adds to the tension and frustration. Why were Allison and Jason chosen? Will they survive and find true love? Can they save the unlucky bystanders also caught in this twisted game of love?\n\n“…potential couple is put through hell to tear down their walls and bond over their shared trauma.”\n\nSoul Mates is more squirm-inducing and mysterious than scary. For those expecting frights by the fistful, look elsewhere. But potential audience members who want decent characterizations alongside several gory scenes will have a good time. The plot is reasonably original, even if the big twist is seen from a mile away. The interplay between Jason and Allison, especially during a tender shower scene and the following dinner, shows they could be a good match. The various scenes of brutality are well-realized and nasty in all the right ways.\n\nIlonzeh is tender and tough in equal measure. Her reaction to a Match.com video being used against her feels believable. Weber sells the constant confusion and flustered nature his character finds himself in. McDonough uses his initiate charm to a sinister and fun effect.\n\nSoul Mates is a fun time, even if certain story beats are an obvious foregone conclusion. The leads are good and share genuine chemistry. The film’s effectiveness stems from its solid set-up and wild moments."
