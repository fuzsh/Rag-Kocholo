        "text": "First-time director Anita Rocha da Silveira’s film starts audaciously: a prolonged, fourth-wall-breaking moment of eye contact with a heavily made up, glassy eyed teenage girl. As the girl leaves her friends and begins to feel like she is being followed by an unknown pursuer, the somber vibe shifts into something neon and threatening, and by the time the title is splashed in all caps across the screen — Mate-me por favor (Kill Me Please) — we hear the girl’s screams. But Rocha da Silviera’s film isn’t quite the horror film its beginning suggests; instead, it’s a different type of horror, an existential story about privileged teen girls in Brazil coming of age in the shadow of brutal murders.\n\nAs it becomes obvious that there is a serial killer in her affluent Rio de Janiero neighborhood, 15-year-old Bia (Valentina Herszage), who lives with her brother João, becomes obsessed with sex and death. She explores her sexuality with her boring boyfriend and constantly talks about the murders with her friends. These two threads come together in disturbing but inevitable ways, as when she finds a friend struggling to live after being attacked, and kisses her dying lips."
