        "text": "Last Updated on March 16, 2024 by Angel Melanson\n\nBlack-owned production company, A Manny Halley Production, has earned another SAG-AFTRA interim agreement for the upcoming horror dating thriller, Soul Mates. On October 20th, Soul Mates is set to hit hundreds of theaters nationwide. Directed by Mark Gantt and produced by Manny Halley, Rodney Turner II, William K Baker, Yolanda Halley, and lead actress Annie Ilonzeh, the terrifying film takes dating nightmares to a whole new level.\n\nPresented by Faith Media Distribution, Soul Mates is a character-driven horror film reminiscent of classics like Escape Room and Saw, with a touch of The Running Man. Viewers should prepare for a nail-biting ride as they follow two unsuspecting strangers who must work together to survive while trapped in a deadly game. The Motion Picture Association of America gave this thriller an R rating.\n\nJason (Charlie Weber) and Allison (Annie Ilonzeh) are two singles seeking love in the digital age. Little do they know that their quest for romance will drag them through torment orchestrated by the enigmatic Matchmaker, portrayed by the incomparable SAG Award-nominated Neal McDonough.\n\nThe official trailer has been drumming up excitement, and we can’t wait to check out the full feature. Take a look at this two-minute sneak peek in the official red band trailer below, and watch Soul Mates in theaters October 20.\n\n*Sponsored by Map360\n\nAngel Melanson is the Digital Editor of FANGORIA.com. When she’s not running the website, you can find her acting as Fango’s resident online creep in various hosting capacities and occasionally writing for the magazine.\n\nHer journey from sneaking childhood peeks at FANGORIA to running the HorrorGirl Problems website and podcast came full circle when she joined the Fango family full-time in 2021. A true nightmare come true. She can also be seen in the Queer For Fear and Into The Darkness: Part III documentary series on Shudder."
