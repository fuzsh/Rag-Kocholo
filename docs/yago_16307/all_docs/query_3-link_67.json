        "text": "Past Lives (12A)\n\nDirected by Celine Song\n\nWHERE do I start with this beautiful and haunting film about first love, cultural identity and the parts of ourselves that we lose as we become the people we are.\n\nSet in South Korea and New York, it is inspired by playwright Celine Song’s own life and proves an extraordinary and deeply personal debut feature film which is exquisitely written and acted as it hits all its complex emotional notes.\n\nThe film opens with a woman sat in between two men at a US bar. One is Asian, the other is American. She is talking animatedly to her Asian companion in Korean while ignoring the other guy as a woman, out of shot, is heard trying to figure out what their story is.\n\nFlash back 24 years earlier as Korean 12-year-old best friends Na Young (Moon Seung-ah) and Hae Sung (Leem Seung-min) are just becoming childhood sweethearts when they are forced to part, as she emigrates to Canada with her liberal and artistic parents and then to New York.\n\nIn her 20s, now calling herself Nora (Greta Lee), she is actively pursuing a career as a writer when Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) gets back in touch with her. He is still living in South Korea and is studying engineering but still burns a torch for her. They embark on an intense relationship via face time until she decides they need to take a break because it is becoming all consuming. At the same time she meets her husband-to-be Arthur (John Magaro), a writer.\n\nWhen Hae Sung decides to visit Nora in the Big Apple for the first time in over two decades you can’t help but feel for her husband and the future of their marriage, as he doesn’t stand in the way.\n\nOld school Hae Sung, Nora’s first love, represents her past as she reconnects with him and her Korean side and 12-year-old self. While Arthur is both her future and who she is now, an ambitious Korean American immigrant writer.\n\nThe drama heads towards the emotional showdown of that opening moment of the three of them sat at the bar. Who will Nora choose?\n\nSong delivers a gorgeous pitch-perfect romantic drama which at its core is about a woman mourning the loss of the 12-year-old girl she left behind in Korea and the life she could have had and lost by choosing the one she did.\n\nIt is a heart-wrenching film which does not wimp out at the end, and is the best film of the year.\n\nOut in cinemas today"
