        "text": "Special Guest:\n\nROEL REINE was born in The Netherlands, and with his first theatrical feature 'The Delivery' he won The Golden Calf (aka the Dutch Oscar) for Best Director.\n\nIn 2005 Roel Reine moved to Los Angeles and has directed now an impressive slate of 20 feature films for studios like Universal, 20th Century Fox, Sony and Lionsgate, as well with independent international producers. Roel is also the Director of Photography on all his movies.\n\nRoel Reine is known by fans, critics and Hollywood studios as one of the best modern action directors around today. Some of his latest movies include, ‘Hard Target 2’ with Scott Adins, ’The Man with the Iron Fists 2’, (with RZA), 'Dead in Tombstone’ (with Mickey Rourke for Universal a VOD hit), and two very popular 'Death Race’ prequels, with Sean Bean and Ving Rhames.\n\nHis 2015 movie ‘Admiral’, a.k.a. ‘Michiel de Ruyter', an epic historical Dutch language movie, had a very successful theatrical release world wide. In 2015 it was the only Dutch movie in the box office top ten in The Netherlands. In 2016 Roel Reine started directing prime time television series such as ‘Black Sails’ and ‘Blood Drive’.\n\nIn our Official Selection:\n\n. Boudewijn directed by Vincent Fitz-Jim ***** PREMIERE\n\nBoudewijn, a 55-year-old man, is about to meet Robin. Robin is 25, that’s all Boudewijn knows of him. The excitement of not knowing what’s coming turns him on. But nothing is what is seems.\n\n. Alchemy On The Amstel (II) directed by Janja Rakuš ***** PREMIERE\n\nCinematic travelogue through the Underworld dreamed by the river Amstel. Water as a liquid mirror, visual oracle that reflects Parallel Universe of the Amsterdam city. Narration dictated by the ever-changing and re-shaping flow of the river. There is a river inside Amstel river.\n\nSpecial Guest:\n\nSIMONE VAN DUSSELDORP is a renowned director of children’s films. 'Diep' was Simone’s feature debut. After which she made Frogs and Toads, Briefgeheim and Life according to Nino. These films won prizes at many renowned international film festivals. Her latest film Owls and Mice was this year’s opening film at Cinekid film festival where she received the Life Time Achievement Award.\n\nSpecial project:\n\nAfter 'PARIS, JE T'AIME', 'NY, I LOVE YOU'.... comes ROTTERDAM, I LOVE YOU. Producer\n\nJoeri Pruys will let us know more about this urban movement with an international feature film at its core, proudly celebrating Rotterdam’s creativity, diversity and love. The film will contain 11 stories by 11 directors, showing the entire world what Rotterdam is truly like.\n\nIn our Official Selection:\n\n. Beautiful woman directed by Diëgo Nurse ***** PREMIERE\n\nA poetic portrait of the moment that Beyong , a 30-year old transgender who was taught to suppress her true self growing up, gives in to her subconsciousness and starts her transformation into the woman she is today.\n\n. GILLES directed by Jordi Wijnalda\n\nOn a Saturday night in the \"City of Love\", two sworn enemies unite in their mutual hatred for someone they despise even more than each other: a gay man.\n\n. Special Guest:\n\nLegendary actor RUTGER HAUER acting career was launched in 1969, when he took the starring role in Paul Verhoeven’s popular TV Show, Floris, but he didn’t catch the attention of American audiences until the 1980s, when he appeared in Nighthawks (1981) with Sylvester Stallone, and became notorious by playing fan favorite Roy Batty, a murderous replicant in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), where he delivered one of the most impressive improvisation moments in the history of cinema.\n\nHe also managed to capture a few hearts in the medieval fantasy\n\nLadyhawke (1985) playing Captain Navarre. Taking on a very different acting role that same year, Rutger terrorized C. Thomas Howell — and audiences — as a psychotic drifter in The Hitcher where he also did his own dangerous stunts, which led to more action-adventure films like Wanted: Dead or Alive and Blind Fury. Hauer also garnered critical acclaim in 1988 for his role in The Legend of the Holy Drinker (Golden Lion winner, Venice Film Festival), which won him the Best Actor award at the Seattle International Film Festival.\n\nRutger continued to act in both TV and film over the next several decades, scoring a memorable role in Sin City (2005) as the evil and corrupt Cardinal Roark, and again poked fun at himself - and the grindhouse action genre - as the “Hobo” in Hobo with a Shotgun, a 2011 film based on a fake trailer made by Director Robert Rodriguez.

In 1980, determined to learn more about feature film, he took the night bus to Italy. In Rome, he managed to get in touch with Italian director Marco Ferreri who offered him a humble position on his set. A decisive experience. In the famous studios of Cinecitta Rudolf got the chance to witness the director's craft. Two years later Rudolf directed his first feature film, 'Bastille', for which he received the Golden Calf (aka the Dutch Oscar) for best film. More feature films and awards followed while Rudolf showed his diversity as a filmmaker, such as 'Evenings', 'Looking for Eileen' and 'The Johnsons' (a horror film that still enjoys a modest worldwide cult status).\n\nWhen, in 1996, Rudolf's English language films 'The Cold Light of Day' and 'For My Baby' were doing well internationally but not in The Netherlands, Rudolf decided to try his luck in the US. In Los Angeles he met renowned film producer Pierre Spengler.
