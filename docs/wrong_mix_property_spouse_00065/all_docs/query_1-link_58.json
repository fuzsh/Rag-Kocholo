        "text": "Chris Brown has at all times been a magnet for controversy. Even to this day, people in the music industry as dissing him, and former enthusiasts swear off his song. Of course, most of this stems from his horrific altercation with Rihanna.\n\nBut in spite of worldwide condemnation, some celebrities defended his return to the spotlight following his sentencing for his crime. This includes one of the most loved TV and film stars dwelling lately...\n\nChris Brown's Scandal With Rihanna\n\nThere's so much to find out about Chris Brown's criminal record and assault charges. And they appear to continue to rack up alleged altercations on yachts. But all of this was sparked after his notorious assault on Rihanna in 2009 in his Lambourgini the night time prior to The Grammys. Everyone noticed pictures of a beaten and bruised Rihanna and have been rightfully furious with the rapper.\n\nRelated: Chris Brown Sued For Alleged Yacht Assault\n\nEven Chris himself admitted to the incident, in line with Grazia, announcing, \"Like I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s***, but then I really hit her. With a closed fist, like I punched her, and it busted her lip, and when I saw it I was in shock, I was âf***', why did I hit her like that? So from there sheâsâ¦spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. Itâs a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Chris was once sentenced to five years probation, six months of community carrier, and a yr of home violence counseling. Not long after this, he won some roles in a couple of series and in movies like 2012's Think Like A Man. Many questioned whether or no longer it was once suitable for Chris to still be working in the highlight. But others supported his rehabilitation, including his Think Like A Man co-star, Taraji P. Henson.\n\nTaraji P. Henson's Relationship With Chris Brown\n\nWhile selling Think Like A Man in 2012, Taraji P. Henson (best-known for Hidden Figures, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, Hustle & Flow, and Empire) defended Chris' right cameo in the film. She was requested what she thought of Chris' involvement by writer Jenni Miller at Vulture. Taraji had this to say:\n\n\"I was happy for him because I know he really wants to act. You know, heâs trying to get into acting. I donât dislike Chris Brown. I feel like we all have our skeletons. Itâs unfortunate when youâre in the limelight the world gets to know about your dirty laundry, but as humans, we all have it, so for me to stand back and judge him and say that what he did was â is what he did wrong? Absolutely. Iâm not condoning it. But what Iâm saying is we have to allow each other to be human and we have to allow humans to make mistakes and to be big enough to forgive them. I guarantee you if you could give him those five minutes back, he would change it. If he could rewrite history, he would. But unfortunately, heâs human just like the rest of us. And there are things that I wish I could erase. But unfortunately, you canât. You just gotta live and you gotta learn. Do I feel like heâs learned his lesson? Absolutely.\"\n\nRelated: Chris Brown Gets Slammed For Allegedly Leaving His Ex-Housekeeper Bleeding After His Dogâs Attack\n\nWhen asked if she has received any flack for supporting him, Taraji stated, \"No. I support humans. If somebody told me something â if I heard something [bad] through the grapevine about you before doing this interview â it wouldnât make me not want to do the interview.\"\n\nWhat Happened To Chris Brown's Acting Career?\n\nChris Brown has made and been featured in numerous track videos through the years... so much. They pretty much dominate his IMDb page. However, with regards to actual roles, he hasn't scored nearly as many as he sought after. Many believe that his horrible cameo on The O.C. ruined his shot at a successful Hollywood career.\n\nDuring an interview with MTV, Chris defined his role on the fourth season of the hit Fox series. \"I play, like, a band geek â I'm really stepping out of my own character. I was kind of a geek in school, grade-wise. But style-wise, I was always popular and cool. But [on the show] I'm geeked out all the way. I'm just trying to be myself and then be the character [the role calls for]. I don't look at it like this role takes away from who I am.\"\n\nRelated: Chris Brown Leaks Scrapped Verse From Kanye Westâs âDondaâ Album Amid Feud, And Fans Love It\n\nWhen talking about horrific cameos, Billboard.com spoke defined that while The O.C. writers didn't do much in the way in which with the nature he played, who was opposite Willa Holland, Chris used to be \"emotionless\" in his performance.\n\nAfter The O.C., Chris went on to earn small roles in This Christmas, The Suite Life With Zack And Cody, Takers, A House Divided, Battle Of The Year, and, after all, Think Like A Man with Taraji P. Henson. But not anything has in point of fact caught or propelled him into stardom as an actor.\n\nFortunately for Chris, he's at all times had track to fall again on. While many likely nonetheless feel he should be canceled, some (like Taraji) believe he's paid his price. Regardless, it seems as despite the fact that he's going to all the time have his a hit song career.\n\nNext: Chris Brown Fans In Awe As His Daughter Gets Close And Personal With Exotic Animals\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqjvs6wpWaqmZ2ur7rAZqqcmZ6Zrq1505qpmqKZYr1utMSnqqimXZu%2FqrHNnaqhoaBk"
