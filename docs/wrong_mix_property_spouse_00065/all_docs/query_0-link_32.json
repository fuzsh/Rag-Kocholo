It's such an upsetting situation. But when I wrote about the story when it first broke, I was surprised at how many of you stood up for Chris. See some of the responses below:\n\nDjkkshea wrote: Of course I feel bad for Robyn (Rihanna), but I also feel horrible for Chris Brown! I mean, he could have been drunk at the time when this happened. I heard she threw his keys out the window to keep him from driving. He was under the influence, and while we can't place our problems on alcohol, he was NOT thinking. I imagine he is feeling HORRIBLE guilt for what has happened, and this just goes to show, one night of \"fun\" can ruin your life.\n\nraquelovesyou wrote: I don't think people should judge him. Chris Brown is a great guy, so Rihanna probably did something that made him do that. He wouldn't just hit her for no reason. Chris Brown is amazing.\n\nNo matter what the outcome in this case, it's really important to me that I relay this message to all of you: It's not okay for a guy (or anyone, for that matter) to hit you, whether you provoke it or not. Of course, you shouldn't ever hit anyone else either. Loveisrespect.org created a video about this and I really hope all of you will watch it. It sums up how I want all of you to be treated in relationships â€” current and those to come."
