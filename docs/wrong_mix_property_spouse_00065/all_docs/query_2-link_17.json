        "text": "Billboard‘s newest cover star PartyNextDoor hasn’t just established himself as an alternative R&B auteur over the last decade, but he’s also cemented himself as one of pop music’s most sought-out hitmakers.\n\nAfter becoming the first recording artist signed to Drake‘s OVO label in 2013, Party has made hit after hit with The Boy. He provided background vocals on “Own It” and “Come Thru” on Drake’s 2013 album Nothing Was the Same, and he co-wrote and produced “Legend,” “Preach” and “Wednesday Night Interlude” on 2015’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, while also serving as a featured artist on the latter two songs. “Preach” earned PND his first Billboard Hot 100 entry in 2015. And he earned an album of the year Grammy nomination in 2017 for contributing to Views (he has a co-writing credit on “U with Me?”).\n\nHe’s also been behind some of Rihanna‘s biggest hits, like the nine-week Hot 100 No. 1 “Work,” featuring Drake, and DJ Khaled‘s seven-week No. 2 “Wild Thoughts,” featuring Bryson Tiller. Donald Glover recently called “Sex With Me” — another ANTI track Party co-wrote — the “GOAT” Rihanna song. And some fans and critics have argued that his leaked reference tracks for those songs sound better than their final versions.\n\nWhen it comes to demos, Party told Billboard, “I’m just trying to get these ideas out. And if I took the time to record it, that’s when I don’t give the record out. [If] I did all the background vocals, I sang it properly like a vocalist, that’s when it’s harder to give it away. So it’s easier to give it away while it’s just a skeleton and you’re just talking through things.”\n\nBillboard rounded up seven songs PartyNextDoor co-wrote and/or -produced, which other artists recorded."
