        "text": "Rihanna‘s first single from her upcoming fourth album (due November 23rd), will be unveiled October 20th at 11:23 a.m. EST. Due to the level of secrecy surrounding the star’s new LP — it’ll be her first work under her own name since she was assaulted by ex-boyfriend Chris Brown in February — producer Chris “Tricky” Stewart tells Rap-Up he’s unsure whether the track he worked on will be the first or second single and can’t release its name — but either way, he guarantees the song will be a smash. “It’s uptempo. It’s a club banger and it’s edgy,” Stewart said.\n\nThe song was written by The-Dream and produced by Stewart, the same pair responsible for Rihanna’s Good Girl Gone Bad smash “Umbrella,” but Stewart says the new single is “different.” “It’s a superstar taking a step in a totally different direction. This album is different than her past works,” Stewart said.\n\nJust as “Umbrella” featured a guest spot by Jay-Z, this new song will also feature an unspecified top-flight rapper. Stewart also confirmed that the cryptic “The Wait is Ova, November 23rd” scrawled on Rihanna’s official Website referred to the release date of the star’s fourth album. Amazon’s presale page for the record says the LP will be a double-disc, but there’s no confirmation on that as yet.\n\n“This is Rihanna coming into her own and going from being a girl that has been singing big, huge hit records, and the artist is awake and alive and moving on this project,” Stewart said. “She knows exactly what she wants to say, she knows how she wants to feel.” Stewart and The-Dream have so far only contributed the “monster” single, and Stewart confirms Ne-Yo is another songwriter working on the project.\n\nRihanna and Chris Brown’s Grammy weekend: photos.\n\nBesides appearing in Kanye West’s “Paranoid” video and singing the chorus on Jay-Z’s “Run This Town,” Rihanna has largely kept out of the musical spotlight in 2009. That’s about to change, and soon. “Everything’s about to happen really fast, so it’s not gonna be long,” Stewart said.\n\nTrending\n\nRelated Stories:"
