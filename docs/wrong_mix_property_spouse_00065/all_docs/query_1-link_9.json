        "text": "Well Chris Brown’s plans to be a self-centered girlfriend-beating douche just got even bigger. I didn’t think he could possibly come up with a new way to offend absolutely everyone, but he sure managed to. Chris is going to write a book. About abuse. With Rihanna. All in an incredibly offensive (and some would say mentally abusive) attempt to salvage his career.\n\nChris Brown and Rihanna plan to co-author a book about abuse and go on a talk show tour in a desperate bid to salvage his career, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Saturday.\n\nQuoting sources close to Brown’s legal team, the paper said the R&B singer charged with brutalizing Rihanna even has a name for his rehabilitation effort: “Project Mea Culpa.”\n\n“The only way Chris can possibly reverse things is to come clean and help raise awareness about abusive relationships,” a source told the paper.\n\n“Obviously this is a public relations campaign, but it only will work if there’s genuine healing, contrition and a path to preventing future problems,” the source said.\n\n“It’s another example of trying to turn a bad situation into something good … where people can learn to change habits.”\n\n[From the New York Daily News]\n\nI find this offensive on so many levels. The biggest one that he’s clearly just doing this for himself; there is no contrition or repentance there. But involving Rihanna in this? It’s absolutely disgusting. While I’d love to think this is untrue, the Chicago Sun-Times is a very reputable source. And we’ve already learned that absolutely nothing is below Chris Brown.\n\nHe clearly wants to profit off this nonsense. I’m sure whoever came up with this ridiculous scheme (probably his PR firm) will also be smart enough to have him donate all the profits to a domestic violence charity. But since Chris is only doing this to save his career, he’s still hoping to profit off it. I cannot believe more people aren’t calling this guy out for what he is."
