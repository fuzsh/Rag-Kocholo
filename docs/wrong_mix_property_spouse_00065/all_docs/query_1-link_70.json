        "text": "Rihanna has explained her decision to collaborate with Chris Brown on her track Birthday Cake.\n\nThe singer recently caused controversy when she teamed up with her ex for a remix of the hit and to work on his track Turn Up The Music.\n\nTalking to Ryan Seacrest, on his KIIS-FM radio show, the Barbadian singer revealed that she approached Brown about the duets.\n\nShe said: \"I reached out to him about doing Birthday Cake because that's the only person that really, it made sense to do the record... Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person.\n\n\"You know, I thought about rappers, and I've done that so many times, and the hottest R&B artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, 'Why don't you do the remix to my track?' and it was a trade off.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old singer also said that she didn't want her and Brown's fans to clash over the collaboration, adding: \"We did two records. One for my fans. One for his fans. And that way our fans can come together. There shouldn't be a divide, you know? It's music, and it's innocent.\"\n\nNews of the duet is thought to have come as surprise to fans of the singer after Brown was convicted of assault for an altercation with Rihanna in 2009.\n\nGRAMMY AWARDS 2012 RIHANNA: LOOK BOOK RIHANNA FOR ARMANI: PICS SOURCE: US WEEKLY\n\nhttps://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/search?q=chris%20brown On the 21st of February 2012, we wrote...Chris Brown and Rihanna have worked together for the first time since Brown's shock attach on the singer, collaborating on remixes of each other's tracks. The two singers, who dated until he assaulted her on the eve of the Grammy Awards in 2009, posted the new track on file sharing sites. The pair also spoke about them on their Twitter pages. News of the collaboration comes after rumours surfaced last week that the two had been working together on Rihanna's track Birthday Cake, which appears on her latest album Talk That Talk. Tweeting at Rihanna, Brown wished the Barbadian-born star a happy birthday, referring to her by her real name, Robyn."
