        "text": "Rihanna and Chris Brown haven’t been an item since 2009, ever since he was convicted of domestic abuse against her.\n\nBut in that six years, the singer has been constantly reminded of the violence she suffered and she wants it to stop.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair magazine, Rihanna explained that she felt that victims of abuse are being continually punished every time the subject is brought up.\n\n‘I just never understood that, like how the victim gets punished over and over,’ Ri said. ‘It’s in the past, and I don’t want to say “Get over it,” because it’s a very serious thing that is still relevant; it’s still real. A lot of women, a lot of young girls, are still going through it. A lot of young boys too.\n\n‘It’s not a subject to sweep under the rug, so I can’t just dismiss it like it wasn’t anything, or I don’t take it seriously. But, for me, and anyone who’s been a victim of domestic abuse, nobody wants to even remember it.’\n\nRihanna and Chris first met in 2005 and continually denied a relationship. It was only confirmed that they were an item after a picture of her was released showing the bloody and bruised wounds from his attack on her in a rented Lamborghini following Clive Davis’ Grammy party in 2009.\n\nThe Umbrella singer ended up dating Brown again, allegedly, in 2011 but now she says they are no longer friends.\n\n‘I will care about him until the day I die,’ Rihanna said. ‘We’re not friends, but it’s not like we’re enemies. We don’t have much of a relationship now.’\n\nRead the full Rihanna cover story in Vanity Fair, out now\n\nMORE : Rihanna has a new hero, and it’s definitely not who’d you expect"
