        "text": "Two years after pleading guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna, Chris Brown is to star in a romantic comedy. The R&B singer has been cast in Think Like a Man, a film adaptation of a self-help book by comedian Steve Harvey.\n\nThe original title of Harvey's book was Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment. Published in 2009, it briefly bumped Twilight author Stephenie Meyer from the top of the US bestseller list. While Harvey's tome is non-fiction, the movie version will transform his advice into a quirky love story starring Brown and actor Gabrielle Union.\n\nBrown, 22, attacked Rihanna on 8 February 2009. She suffered heavy bruising and a \"mouthful of blood\", according to police reports. Brown was later sentenced to five years' probation, a year of domestic violence counselling and six months' community service. \"I am ashamed of and sorry for what happened that night and I wish I could relive that moment and change things, but I can't,\" he said in September 2009.\n\nSince then, the R&B singer's career has slowly but surely recovered. A new album, released this year, topped the US charts and reached No 10 in the UK. Brown recently performed on Dancing with the Stars and the Today Show. After the latter programme was criticised for booking him, the singer – who has undergone anger management classes – lashed out on Twitter. \"[People] are upset at the fact that the Today Show actually focuses on talent instead of an almost 3-year old incident!\" he wrote. \"Running bogus and pointless stories don't matter! My fans prove that everyday and the haters just look old as fuck! I keep my head high and my middle finger higher!\"\n\nIn March, Brown smashed up his dressing room, \"going ballistic\" after he was asked about Rihanna in an interview with Good Morning America. He claimed he was \"just letting off steam\".\n\nThink Like a Man is due in April next year."
