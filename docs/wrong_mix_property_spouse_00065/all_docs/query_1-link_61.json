After Eminem recorded it, he scrapped it, and rewrote it. Obviously he and Rihanna have a great relationship.”\n\nElsewhere on the track, Eminem raps about beating a sex worker “mercilessly” and leaving her “for dead” as well as murdering then-16-year-old actor Dakota Fanning.\n\nThe 40 greatest song lyrics\n\nShow all 40\n\nBrown assaulted his then-girlfriend Rihanna when they were on their way to the Grammys in 2009.\n\nHe was found guilty of felony assault and sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling and six months of community service.\n\nEminem and Rihanna have collaborated numerous times, including on the songs \"Love the Way You Lie” and “The Monster”, the latter of which is about being in a violent relationship.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
