        "text": "The influence of mass media in our lives has grown exponentially in the last decade. As mass media platforms have developed and expanded, human societies have gained unprecedented access and updates to news occurring around the globe. We trust and rely on the media as our source for current news, education, and entertainment. While there is a seemingly infinite amount of content available, only a small fraction of that content appears in national media reports. More often than not, we absorb this information without considering who is behind the information or how that information may impact how we interact with one another. Prior to writing this paper, I did not realize that over 90% of the media in the United States is owned by six major corporations. These corporations have the power to shape our opinions and heavily influence our beliefs and decisions. This paper will analyze Missing White Woman Syndrome (MWWS), the disproportionate\n\nSaunders criticizes the megaphone, claiming it places priority on entertaining, profitable news as opposed to news that is educational or enlightening. Saunders furthers this claim by arguing that news media is habitually over-simplifying complicated issues, thus desensitizing the masses to stupidity and frivolity. Saunders’ essay is important because although it was published in 2007, it is still relevant (and will most likely be relevant as long as media exists). In fact, the points he makes in this essay are even more relatable now, as social media has increased greatly in popularity. Everywhere you look, there is a new “breaking story” about the Kardashians or the Jenners; and people accept this as real news! Saunders’ essay encourages readers to be critical of mass media and seek out undiluted, uncontaminated, earnest news\n\nIn a general sense society derives much of their beliefs and indifferences from stories that are covered in the media. If the stories are being reported biased, how can we, as a society, see the whole picture? The author's purpose is to inform readers about the different biases that news and media sway by and to provide evidence that proves instances when these biases have weakened the validity of the reporter's story. \"Journalist are like dogs-whenever anything moves, they begin to bark.\" (Gladstone, 2011/2013, P.25)\n\nThe twitter world as we know it has shifted from targeting business and public figures to shaming strictly personal relationships. Justine Sacco has become a twitter outrage. Her tweet was not just seen as ignorant and offensive, but a “reflexive critique of white privilege”(Ronson 6). Sacco had become a traumatic mess, but she believed that she would come back. We can track the beginnings of shaming all the way back to the colonial era where the town's used whipping and lashing in public to show people what would happen if they sinned. Most criminals would ask for a private shaming. Justine Sacco had to face the hate of the world during her time of revival. A few months after the incident Ronson asked Sacco if she could meet him to discuss where she had come to in life, but Sacco refused saying “No Way” (Ronson 11). She preferred to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nVisualize living in a society where slut-shaming occurs every day and someone's mistake is publicized to the point that everyone knows what happened. Some people would believe this would be referring to the Puritan society that existed during the 1600’s, but unfortunately, this is common situations that appear in today’s society. A “famous” person's error can show up on social media, covers of magazines, and every talk show throughout America. For example, recently the break up of the beloved Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie appeared everywhere in less than a day. The breakup sparked news on twitter, talk shows such as Wendy Williams, and prevailed to be the lead story on every tabloid by the following day. Even though our society did not devise\n\nChris Brown is an American artist, lyricist, and on-screen character. He is popular with his dance moves and R&B music. His overall music career have made him exceptionally acclaimed in many parts of the world. In spite of him being known as a great singer, he is known as well for his terrible temper and brutality. One of his famous abusive behaviors was against his ex Rihanna, which happened in 2009. \"Chris and Rihanna, had a contention which swelled into physical brutality, leaving Rihanna with noticeable facial wounds which required hospitalization\". \"He was charged on April 6, 2009, and plead not guilty to one count of attack and one count of making criminal threats. On June 22, 2009, Brown confessed to a lawful offense and acknowledged a supplication arrangement of community service, five years probation, and aggressive behavior counseling\".\n\nIn the article, “When Rape Goes Viral,” Ann Friedman, a columnist for New York magazine’s website and the Columbia Journalism Review, argues that in this time period that sexual assaults are becoming more aware of and tackled due to social media. People are viewing these assaults by videos, picture, and postings from different social media pages, claims Friedman. Friedman reports that the postings of these pictures and videos have helped in multiple cases of sexual assaults. If there were no photos or videos of evidence from the cases then some of the convictions that have been made throughout time might not have ever happened, argues Friedman. She insists that the post with the most attention leave the victims in traumatic circumstances that\n\nHave you ever wondered how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop? Well I have, however one thing I haven’t ever thought about was how many punches it takes to beat someone half to death. In this case, all it took was one punch. After 5 years of being on and off, Rihanna had reason to call an “SOS” when Chris Brown beat her so bad, that she couldn’t even make it to her Grammy performance that week. The couple kept quiet for numerous reasons in regard to their image until it couldn’t be hidden anymore. Chris Brown turned himself into the police for questioning shortly after he had allegedly been in a car accident. Rumors proved to false after a picture of Rihanna’s brutally beaten face was released on TMZ. After questioning and trial, he was released on a $50,000 bail,180 hours of community service and a received a restraining order keeping him from the pop icon, but was that enough? If you do the crime, you should do the time. To this day, Chris Brown has yet to fully repair his image and that is due to the fact of how he went about his situation. In this paper I will be assessing what happened, the image repair strategies Chris Brown took and if the message was effective or not.\n\nThe article is a pathos type argument. The article is written to play on your emotions about abuse towards women and how youth overlook the abuse with the use of social media. One example from the article that clearly brings up this point of contention would be the “flame wars” surrounding Chris Brown. When he “accepted the award for best R&B Album for his latest record ‘F.A.M.E'”. His abusive relationship with Rihanna was dragged up, and the “flame\n\nRarely does the media offer how the victim tried to defend against the aggressive act, but it quickly allows those accused to state no assault occurred, merely a miscommunication. Celebrities and song artists using rape culture and sexual assault as a way to further their career diminishes society 's concern when attacks occur. Today’s generation typically decides as a whole whether or not the statement or event categorizes as offensive or immoral, leading to not only the victims but individuals attempting to raise awareness to be told their views are invalid.\n\nIn previous research done by Kristi Grim she examined the coverage of Michael Vick, an African-American quarterback accused of running a dog fighting ring, and Roethlisberger, a white NFL quarterback, who like Vick also had a bright football career and was accused of sexual assault (Grim, 2013). She performed a qualitative research analysis examining the dominant frame in each local newspaper, and how the journalist established the frame in the story. In her research she reviewed the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) for stories on Michael Vick’s dog fighting accusations, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (PPG) for stories involving Roethlisberger’s rape accusations (Grim, 2013). In her research she only focused on articles that happened before the district attorney announced Roethlisberger would not be charged, and before Vick was charged to avoid this having an impact on the way the media portrayed the story.\n\nCelebrities have a right to have their own privacy, and the paparazzi had better not be allowed to restrict their lives. Furthermore, photographers and journalists must not be permitted to make news that can influence celebrities' success adversely. The rights of celebrities for privacy have always been abused, so they need to defend their rights, despite their profession. Though they are public figures, this does not mean that the publish of every detail of their private lives is justifiable. It is legitimate to take pictures when they are at the stage or on the red carpet, yet most cases they must be left alone. However, the media always inclines to release both sensational and negative news to public. The latest pattern is the Chris Brown and Rihanna domestic abuse scandal (\"Chris Brown and Rihanna: A Dangerous Relationship\" 1). This really influenced Chris\n\n\"Tabloids and Propaganda, Are all of the tabloids true, or are they false? Or do they have some truth to them?\" These questions ponder the minds of the readers of these pieces of journalism when they read them. They often wonder if they are truthful for there are many lawsuits that seem to say that they aren't. I tend to wonder myself as well. I constantly see the Supermarket tabloids at newsstands or at supermarkets themselves and I tend to wonder whether or not they are real. The cover itself throws me off though. Most of the time I see a famous couple with a headline for example saying \"Brad and Gwyneth are together again...behind Jennifer's back!\" Sometimes the story itself seems"
