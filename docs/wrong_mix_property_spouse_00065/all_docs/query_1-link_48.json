        "text": "Quavo and Chris Brown have been going back and forth for a couple of weeks and are taking low blows at one another. The Migos rapper released a new Chris Brown diss track Monday night (April 22) which features a posthumous hook from Takeoff. Quavo didn’t hold back from mentioning Chris Brown’s 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. On “Over H– & Bitches,” Quavo raps, “Little bitch come battle with my drac/ You been f—– your bag up when you punched Rih in the face.”\n\nThe Migos rapper also mentioned his altercation with Frank Ocean back in 2013.\n\n“It ain’t nun’ but a fade, you know you lost to Frank,” Quavo raps, adding another incident of a 2015 robbery in his San Fernando home. “N—– ran in your house, tied up your aunt ’cause you ain’t pay.”\n\nQuavo later mentions his rumored romance with Brown’s ex Karrueche which is to be believed why their feud has reignited.\n\n“Lil’ boy wanna die ’bout some coochie? You still f—– up ’bout Karrueche?/ You tried to beat up Teyana but Usher wouldn’t let you do it/ The cocaine got ’em, your honor, bipolar disorder, no wonder/ You was the greatest, n—-, you fumbled, going out sad, I’m watching you crumble,” he raps.\n\nQuavo also calls Brown “c—-head Michael Jackson” since the Virginia native is always getting compared to the King of Pop for his dance moves.\n\nLastly, Quavo brings up Takeoff, who Brown mentioned in “Weakest Link.”\n\n“R.I.P. TakeOff, he the only real one, I got true respect/ Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead,” Brown raps.\n\nQuavo responded: “This bullet got your name/ Don’t ever bring up Take, p—-.”\n\nNew Chris Brown Diss Track: Singer Responds\n\nBrown wasted no time responding to Quavo’s diss via his Instagram Story.\n\n“Google raps,” he wrote. “That s— is poooooooh.” The 11:11 singer added some facepalm and laughing emojis across the message to drive home his point. The singer didn’t stop there; he added that he was disappointed in Quavo’s response and was ready to hear what he had to say.\n\n“D— and I was excited,” he added. “That s— don’t even need a response.”\n\nQuavo’s diss follows Brown’s “Weakest Link” which he released over the weekend. Besides the Takeoff line, the singer also mentioned that he was with Quavo’s ex Saweetie while they were still dating.\n\n“You f—– my ex-h-, that’s cool, I don’t give no f—, lil n—-/ ‘Cause I f—– yo ex when you were still with her, bitch, I’m up, lil n—-,” Brown raps.\n\nListen to Quavo’s “Over H– & Bitches” below:\n\nChris Brown: 7 Of His Best Songs Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
