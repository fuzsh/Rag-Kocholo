        "text": "The concert halls and history books all have been graced with the presence of amazing Black female singer songwriters. From the early 1920s with Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerld, to the 50s with Aretha Franklin, and more.\n\nWith all the amazing contributions that black musicians have made in music that transcends till this day, it’s time to take note of 4 black women who are making their mark in the music industry.\n\nBlack Female Singer Songwriter #1: Victoria Monet\n\nSinger songwriter Victoria Monet has been killing it in the music scene! From Sacramento, California, Victoria defines the R&B and Pop music space. With her 2020 album “Jaguar” ranking 9th on Associated Press Top Albums of 2020 and 20th on NPR’s The Best Albums of 2020, she has been one to watch.\n\nIf you're not familiar with her music you may know some of the songs she wrote.\n\nBeing the singer songwriter she is, Victoria has written for multiple artists across many genres.\n\nSome artists include Fifth Harmony, Nas, Chris Brown, Brandy, and more. But she’s known for writing alongside the talented Ariana Grande. You may know songs like “Honeymoon Avenue. My Everything, 34 + 35, and Thank you next.” Victoria Monet has written all of them and more. Honorable mention goes to “Ice Cream” by popular K-Pop girl group BlackPink ft. Selena Gomez which was also penned by Victoria Monet.\n\nAs you can see, the girl has range. Whether it's her alluring vocals or her incredible lyricism, Victoria Monet is an artist you should have on your playlist.\n\nGo check out her latest single “Coastin” on Spotify now!\n\nBlack Female Singer Songwriter #2: Nija Charles\n\nNija Charles may be the new kid on the block, but she is already one of the most sought after Black singer songwriter and producer in the Hip Hop and R&B scene. From Union, New Jersey, Nija has already been nominated for 12 Grammys and won three.\n\nShe began her career in 2017 writing for the Carters (Beyonce and Jay Z). If you heard \"Heard About Us\" and \"LoveHappy\", that was her. She also worked with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, SZA, Cardi B, Kehlani, Chris Brown, and Drake.\n\nNija’s talent in songwriting cannot be denied, but she wouldn’t be a Black singer songwriter if she didn’t sing too.\n\nNija’s latest album “Don’t Say I Didn’t Warn You” is a solo project of 10 songs with popular hits such as “Ease My Mind (Come Over)”, “Finesse”, and “Beautiful Lies''. Her sound is very R&B inspired and incorporates amazing hooks that just keeps you wanting more.\n\nAs she steps out to become her own artist, we wouldn’t be surprised if a Grammy Nomination for Best R&B Artist of the year comes around the corner.\n\nGo stream her summer single “Love Like This” on Spotify now!\n\nBlack Female Singer Songwriter #3: Tayla Parx\n\nIf you remember Little Inez from the iconic musical “Hairspray”, then you should know what an icon Tayla Parx is. Tayla has worked in the music industry since the young age of 19 and has been going non-stop.\n\nIf there’s one thing you have to know about Black singer songwriter Taylor Parx, is that she is going to write some hits.\n\nTwo songs she co-wrote that made the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles include “Love Lies” by Khalid ft. Normani and “High Hopes” by Panic at The Disco. Also, we can’t forget her 9 Grammy nominations for her work in Ariana Grande’s album “Thank You, Next” and John Legend’s album “Bigger”.\n\nHer work doesn’t end there. She has written and co-written for various artists such as Demi Lovato, Chris Brown, BTS, Mariah Carey, The Internet, Jason Derulo, Babyface, Usher, Rihanna, and more.\n\nTayla is very versatile when it comes to songwriting and draws influences from many places. Her 2020 album “Coping Mechanisms” was influenced by various genres such as R&B, pop, and disco. In an interview with MTV she talks about how her album represents her confronting her inner self and her evolution with love.\n\nTayla takes creative expression to a whole nother level with her music and isn’t afraid to put herself in her work.\n\nBlack Female Singer Songwriter #4: Muni Long (MUH-KNEE LONG)\n\nMuni Long has had a long career in the music industry. Previously known as Priscilla Renea, Muni is a Black singer songwriter you should be familiar with.\n\nMuni went viral on TikTok for her 2021 R&B single “Hrs & Hrs” which sparked all the feels for people to showcase the romance in their relationships. If there's anyone who knows how to set the mood, it's Muni.\n\nMuni has over a decade of experience working and co-writing with big artists in the industry. Her work includes “California King Bed” by Rihanna, “Worth It” by Fifth Harmony, “Imagine” by Ariana Grande, and global hit “Timber” by Pitbull ft. Kesha. These songs are absolute bangers which only proves that Muni Long has some serious skills.\n\nNow, after 12 years of being in the background she’s finally taking center stage so she can shine as well. In her interview with Coveteur she talks about how she has more control now that she’s an artist. She feels like she doesn’t have to shy away from expressing herself through clothing, hair, and makeup as she once did as a songwriter.\n\nHaving the freedom to write what she wants, wear what she wants, and be who she wants to be is the goal.\n\nAs an artist Muni Long wants to leave people inspired through her music and plans to be more experimental and creative with her work.\n\nAs Muni Long is stepping into her own as an artist let's support by streaming her 2021 album “Public Displays of Affection”. Out on all major streaming platforms now."
