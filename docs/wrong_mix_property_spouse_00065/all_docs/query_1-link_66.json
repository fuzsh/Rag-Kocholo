        "text": "Update 14 November: Eminem's representative has finally addressed rumours that Eminem took Chris Brown's side after he assaulted Rihanna in 2009.\n\nIn a statement to XXL, Dennis Dennehy, who works as a spokesperson for the rapper, spoke about the leaked song, which he revealed was scrapped and rewritten.\n\n‘This is a leak of something that’s over 10 years old,’ Dennehy stated. ‘After Eminem recorded it, he scrapped it, and rewrote it. Obviously he and Rihanna have a great relationship.’\n\nA newly 'leaked' snippet, from what is believed to be an old Eminem song, reportedly features a line from the rapper taking Chris Brown’s side, after the 2009 assault which saw Rihanna sustain significant facial injuries.\n\nA Reddit user posted a seven-second snippet from a track titled '(SNIPPET) Eminem - Things Get Worse (Rihanna Diss)’ on Sunday 3 November. The song is thought to be an unreleased version of B.o.B.'s 2011 track ‘Things Get Worse’.\n\nIn the music, Eminem appears to be saying: ‘Of course I side with Chris Brown, I'd beat a b*tch down too.’\n\nInsider reports that the audio appears to have been illegally obtained and neither Eminem or Rihanna have commented on the lyrics.\n\nAccording to comments on Genius, the song was recorded over a cast-off track the 47-year-old wrote for his 2009 album, Relapse.\n\nThe album was released months after Brown was charged with felony assault, after being accused of leaving ‘visible injuries’ on the Barbadian singer with whom he was in a relationships at the time. Brown later pleaded guilty to a single felony count as part of a plea deal.\n\nThe musician was ordered to serve five years of probation, community service and counselling for domestic violence.\n\nIn the years that followed, Eminem and Rihanna collaborated on several music projects together including the hit 2010 song ‘Love the Way You Lie’ and the 2013 song ‘The Monster’.\n\nA year later, the Fenty Beauty founder and ‘Lose Yourself’ singer embarked on a mini-tour together after releasing ‘The Monster’.\n\nInsider reports that ‘Things Get Worse’ also features lyrics that refers to actress Dakota Fanning being sexually abused and murdered as well as Angelina Jolie and Jessica Simpson.\n\nIn 2015, Rihanna spoke out about victims of domestic abuse in an interview with Vanity Fair.\n\n‘It’s not a subject to sweep under the rug, so I can’t just dismiss it like it wasn’t anything, or I don’t take it seriously,' she told the publication.\n\n'But, for me, and anyone who’s been a victim of domestic abuse, nobody wants to even remember it. Nobody even wants to admit it. So to talk about it and say it once, much less 200 times, is like … I have to be punished for it?'\n\nIn 2018, the singer accused Snapchat of ‘intentionally’ shaming victims of domestic abuse after she was the subject of an advert on the social media platform which asked users if they would ‘rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown’.\n\nSnap Inc subsequently said the ad, which was for a game, ‘never should have appeared’ on their service.\n\nIn light of the advert, Rihanna posted a comment on her Instagram Story saying she was ‘trying to figure out what the point was with this mess.\n\n'I'd love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain't that dumb,’ she wrote of the company.\n\nThe 32-year-old continued, adding: ‘This isn't about my personal feelings, cause I don't have much of them... but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven't made it out yet.\n\n‘You let us down! Shame on you. Throw the whole app-ology away.’\n\nA Snap Inc spokesperson stated: ‘We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process.\n\n‘We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.’"
