        "text": "Pop princess Rihanna broke her silence on her domestic abuse case against her ex-BF Chris Brown in the latest issue of Rolling Stone.\n\n“We don’t have to talk ever again in my life,” she said, after explaining why she agreed to loosen the stipulations of the r&b bad boy’s restraining order.\n\n“I just didn’t want to make it more difficult for him professionally. What he did was a personal thing — it had nothing to do with his career. Saying he has to be 100 feet away from me, he can’t perform at awards shows — that definitely made it difficult for him.”\n\nBut the “S&M” singer assures the rock ’n’ roll mag that “it doesn’t mean we’re gonna make up or even talk again. It just means I didn’t want to object to the judge.”\n\nRihanna said these days she’s not dating, and it’s pretty quiet in her bedroom.\n\n“I’m not even sexting. It’s on complete nil,” she said.\n\nDespite putting the abuse behind her, Rihanna said she understands how she is drawn to painful situations, including some kinky behavior in the boudoir.\n\n“It’s not something I’m proud of, and it’s not something I noticed until recently,” she said. “I think it’s common for people who witness abuse in their household. They can never smell how beautiful a rose is unless they get pricked by a thorn.”"
