I hope it's not real.\n\nI'm sick to death of turning on the TV to have a flick through the UK music channels and seeing bloody Rihanna all over them.\n\nI wouldn't mind if it was any good, but it ain't my type of music.\n\nWish we had a channel for classic rock of the 60's, 70's & 80's...\n\n20 music channels and all but 2 are full of modern shit on constant re-run :( tero! 48531\n\n03.01.2013 08:32 You have music channels with actual music?!? brians wig\n\n03.01.2013 09:10\n\ntero! wrote: You have music channels with actual music?!?\n\nNo! That's partly the point I'm making. They're full of modern (what some people call) music ;-)\n\nLOL cmsdrums\n\n03.01.2013 10:26 If you're after a sort of Queen link to Rihanna, then you get one with the fact that Nuno Bettencourt from Extreme is her lead guitarist (what a waste of his talent, but probably pays massively well) PiotreQ\n\n03.01.2013 10:36\n\nbootLuca wrote: maybe is it a fan mix?\n\nFortunately - yes. john bodega\n\n03.01.2013 11:40 Her biggest contribution to society is repeatedly running into Chris Brown's clenched fist.\n\nIt's not her fault that society didn't pay attention. brENsKi\n\n03.01.2013 11:42 whoever \"mashed\" this coulda done a better job\n\nit's ok pretending something is a special mix (feat Brian May - or whoever else)\n\nbut at least use a less obvious source for the guitars\n\nthis sounds like a direct lift from \"I Want It All\"\n\nffs - it even has some of Freddie's vocals - have a listen between 1:10 and 1:25 waunakonor\n\n04.01.2013 21:15 The description says it's a remix, so it's not like the uploader is trying to pass this off as the real song. It's kind of nice hearing the Red Special's beautiful tone, no matter the context. Also, Freddie in some places. AlexRocks\n\n04.01.2013 21:56 Holy shit I didn't know that about Nuno. For real?! brENsKi\n\n05.01.2013 03:43\n\nwaunakonor wrote: The description says it's a remix, so it's not like the uploader is trying to pass this off as the real song.

Not too much in your face. Also the \"It's A Beautiful Day\" intro is quite subtle too."
