        "text": "Lying has is a part of our culture, and it seems as if not a day goes by where you do not lie at all. Our world could not exist as it does, if we lived in a society in which lying did not exist. However as humans, we are prone to lying, because of our need to protect ourselves, or the ones close to us, that we turn to lying in order to either make our lives easier or to avoid problems. Humans have adapted over time into societies where lying is an evolutionary advantage, which has made it a part of our DNA. Even children, as soon as they can talk, are using deception as a way to get what they want, and these children have not even had a chance to learn to lie. Lying also continues throughout our entire lives, because it is not something that we can help, it is a part of who we are. When evaluating the argument Stephanie Ericsson makes in “The Ways We Lie”, regarding the reasons we chose to lie, however it is also important to consider extending the argument to include the idea that lying is not only a daily occurrence, it has also become imbedded into human nature.\n\nLorde uses figurative language in her poem, “Hanging Fire.” In the poem, the author uses alliteration, repetition, hyperbole, personification, and occasional idioms. The author uses the personification, “...my skin has betrayed me…” which shows a part of her insecurities, hence her acne problems. She also uses the hyperbole, “...the boy that I cannot live without…” which shows an exaggeration of her love for the boy. In addition to that, the author uses alliteration and the idiom, “...still sucks his thumb in secret…” to express the boy’s immaturity to her. Then, the author adds repetition, “...momma’s in the bedroom with the door closed…” to convey that her mother isn’t there for her dilemmas and is rather distant, leaving the 14-year-old girl with no one to talk to. Lorde uses figurative language to show how a 14-year-old girl feels neglected by her mother and shares her fears and worries to us. The author uses the repetition, “...and momma’s in the bedroom with the door closed...”at the end of each stanza to show how\n\nYour first thought is the love between the couple is toxic and lethal yet, he cannot resist his partner. But, really it is a reference to Cocaine. Cocaine is given a female voice. He uses personification by bringing the drug to life, where it can communicate with him and become part of his life. He knows that this “girl” meaning, Cocaine is going to be the death of him. While in use of Cocaine he gets numb. “But at least we’ll both be beautiful and stay forever young/ This I know, (yeah) this I know” (3-4). You say again, that he is singing about how the love is so very satisfying. But he is actually meaning that his desire for this young and beautiful woman makes him feel good. He feels as if he is invincible when he has her. Even though he seems to be aware of the consequences that come with feeling young and beautiful; with the use of Cocaine. “She told me, ‘Don’t worry about it.’/ She told me, ‘Don’t worry no more.’/ We both knew we can’t go without it/ She told me you’ll\n\nWhile most rappers establish their credibility by boasting about their wealth and position in their lyrics, “The Way I Am” makes it clear that this rapper refuses to change his lifestyle to conform to the expectations set for rappers. Although, like most rappers, he does take an autobiographical stance in this song, he is more specific and honest in his lyrics than the majority of rappers. He reveals details about his family by claiming he often feels like his father because he “hate[s] to be bothered.” While the majority of rappers might replace a personal detail like this for one that describes their materialistic gains, Eminem ensures that his audience sees fame from an honest perspective. He provides another brief example of a personal problem he has had with fans approaching him while he’s with his family. With lines expressing these sentiments, he gives the impression that he doesn’t care about his fans’ opinions. He criticizes his fans for disturbing him, claiming that he doesn’t owe them anything. This criticism serves the purpose of establishing authority through his lack of interest. Due to the aggressive indifference his lyrics express, the interpreter will likely assume the rapper has the authority to devalue others’ opinions. The intent of the song is not to prove that he is worthy of praise, fame, or glory. On the contrary, the lyrics as a\n\n‘Lose Yourself’ by Eminem is about being famous in the music industry with the difficulty of pressure that occur in the music industry for popularity. Eminem uses dynamics and instrumentals to stay in a constant rhythm after verse one with repetition of the chorus. ‘…You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity comes once in a lifetime.’ The listeners are able to gather the truth about the music career and become more aware of what the composer feels when getting on the music stage to sing.\n\nIn Stephanie Ericsson’s essay, “The Ways We Lie”, she describes the many ways we create miscommunication individually and as a community. Lies that affect us individually are lies we commit between ourselves and a small group, like, “your hair looks great” to a friend, knowing you meant the opposite. Meanwhile, lies that affects society is on a more severe consequence scale – Adolf Hitler, world famous anarchist, persuaded his soldiers into believing obliterating the life of massive amount of Jewish believers had a good cause, when it actually disrupted society itself. Her main topic is how we are consumed by lies and deceptions abused by oneself and society. She categorizes each lie which she later elaborates the different consequences they\n\nHonesty and deception both play valuable roles in all parts of personal lives and society. Richard Gunderman stated, “To tell the truth is to live authentically and responsibly, to really live.” Living honestly is a way to have less stress to your life, proven by Richard Gunderman in “Is lying bad for us?” However, dishonesty seems to at an all time high with the growth of communication as stated in “On Bullshit” by Harry Frankfurt. In addition, lying can provide incredible short-term benefits discussed by Stephanie Ericsson in “The Ways We Lie.” Gunderman’s claim on authenticity is valid because most cultures see honesty and trust as two of the more lauded values. Telling the truth relieves stress and adds trust. Yet, there is a seemingly\n\nBeyonce uses pathos, the first of the three appeals in her song by using very descriptive phrases. When she states, “I’d listen to her, `cause I know how it hurts,” Beyonce is telling her audience that she understands what it is like to be hurt, and that if she were a boy, she would treat her women better because she could understand where she was coming from. This tugs at the listener’s heart because you can see that she has been emotionally hurt from a past relationship. Also, many people can relate to what she is disclosing. It is human nature for people to get emotionally damaged in a relationship and therefore her feelings are empathized. She also uses syntax by the way she orders her words by telling a story. If the song was not in story form, it would not produce the great impact that it does.\n\nMarshall Bruce Mathers a.k.a. Eminem. Born October 17, 1972, grew up in Kansas City. From there he began his career as an individual white rapper. Not many white people are able to succeed in the rap industry, but Eminem has proved everyone wrong. He is now one of the most talked about persons on the earth. His lyrics offend some people, this sparks controversy and censorship. His lyrics containing things such as drugs, alcohol, death, homosexuals, sex and suicide. In some of his songs he includes lyrical\n\nMax Shulman’s piece, “Love is a fallacy” expresses many arguments expressed during every day social interactions. In the piece, the author comes into contact with his roommate, Petey Bellows and a possible love interest, Polly Espy. The author makes many unjustified guess pertaining to their wisdom and intelligence, and these false pretenses contribute to his interactions with the two, and he aims to take advantage of the opportunity of manipulating the two into achieving his own selfish desires. His plan backfires, and he is forced to reconsider his actions. In the process, Max Shulman reveals that his piece is both anti-women, anti-men, and Shulman underestimates the intuitive and emotional aspects of love.\n\nThis song has a lot of emotion behind it. I believe that when Beyoncé sings this song, she is sending off a message to the families of those who lost their lives during 9/11. She is singing from the victim’s point of view saying to remember me for the positive impact I have made in the world and how I strived to make the world a better place. She is singing to tell us that no matter how rich, successful, or famous you may be, always live your life to the fullest because you never know when it\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez, a Columbian novelist, was one of the greatest writers of all time. He was well known for his book, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and the Nobel Prize for Literature he received in 1892. His fictional works were admired because of their richness in wisdom-bearing quotes. One of his quotes was “A lie is more comfortable than doubt, more useful than love, more lasting than truth,” and it was from his novel, The Autumn of the Patriarch. Although the book tells a captivating story of a tyrant who embodies both extremes of the human nature, the quote is a great topic of study."
