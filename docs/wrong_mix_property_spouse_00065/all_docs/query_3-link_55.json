        "text": "Drake fans will soon have another album to press play on, and it’s all thanks to him checking off another box on his evolving list of accomplishments. On Friday (June 23), he announced the upcoming release of his first literary work: a poetry book. “Titles Ruin Everything: A Stream of Consciousness” is co-written by Drake and Kenza Samir.\n\nAs buzz about the collection of lyrics and poems began, so did reports about new music. According to Pitchfork, a QR code found in newspaper ads led people to a website named after the book. The site’s landing page has a message that reads: “I made an album to go with the book. They say they miss the old Drake. Girl, don’t tempt me. For all the dogs.” He didn’t offer any information about a release date or track list, but the book is already up for purchase here.\n\nThe weekend is already shaping up to be a big one for the five-time Grammy Award winner. Drake may be adding more trophies to his collection as he leads the pack of nominees for the 2023 BET Awards. The “Rich Flex” rapper has the most nominations, with a total of seven in categories like Best Male R&B/Pop Artist and Best Male Hip Hop Artist. Last year, he released two albums, Her Loss with 21 Savage and Honestly, Nevermind.\n\nFollowing behind him is GloRilla with six nominations, including a nod for Album of the Year. 21 Savage and Lizzo both snagged five nominations, and rounding out the list of top nominees with four nominations each are Beyoncé, SZA, Ice Spice, Chris Brown, and Burna Boy.\n\nThe annual celebration of Black excellence in music, film, and sports takes place tonight (June 25) in Los Angeles at 8 p.m. The awards ceremony boasts a slew of performances as well as a tribute to Tina Turner and special recognition of Busta Rhymes’ career.\n\nView the list of nominees for music’s top categories below:\n\nViewer’s Choice Award\n\n“Break My Soul” Beyoncé\n\n“Last Last” Burna Boy\n\n“Jimmy Crooks” Drake feat. 21 Savage\n\n“Wait For U” Future feat.
