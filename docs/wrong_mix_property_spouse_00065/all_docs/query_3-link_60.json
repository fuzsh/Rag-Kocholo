        "text": "Rihanna says she wasn’t taking it personally, but was instead standing up for victims of domestic violence when she took Snapchat to task for an advertisement featuring Chris Brown that “would intentionally bring shame to DV victims.”\n\n“I’d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain’t that dumb!” the R&B singer posted Thursday on Instagram.\n\nThe ad in question was for the “Would You Rather” trivia game that featured images of Rihanna and ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, and asked players if they would rather slap Rihanna or punch Brown? Snapchat has since pulled the ad, but screen shots of it have been circulated on social media.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ioveonthebrain/status/974307908514172930\n\nIn 2009, Brown pled guilty to a felony assault on Rihanna, and was sentenced to served five years of probation and six months of community service.\n\n“Now SNAPCHAT I know you already know you ain’t my fave app out there! But I’m just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess!” Rihanna wrote in her post.\n\n“You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn’t about my personal feelings, cause I don’t have much of them … but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven’t made it out yet … you let us down!”\n\n“Shame on you. Throw the whole app-oligy away,” Rihanna concluded.\n\nSnapchat responded quickly by pulling the ad and issuing an apology.\n\n“This advertisement is disgusting and never should have appeared on our service,” Snapchat said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. “We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process. We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.”\n\nThe social media platform said it was not directly affiliated with the mobile video game, and that it has blocked its ad for violation of Snapchat’s advertising policies. But the company felt the fallout nonetheless as stocks fell 4.8 percent to $17.07 before sneaking back up to close at $17.20.\n\nToday’s lesson: Don’t mess with Rihanna."
