        "text": "Viral singer Muni Long has written songs for some of the biggest names in music. Here's a look at some of her hottest writing credits so far.\n\nBy D.M.\n\nMar. 12 2024, Published 5:28 p.m. ET\n\nTo some, Muni Long may seem like a rising star in music. However, the singer-songwriter, formerly known as Priscilla Renea, has been in the business for over a decade.\n\nThe Florida native stepped into the spotlight in 2009 with her bubbly pop single “Dollhouse.” She went on to release a debut album, Jukebox, which failed to achieve commercial success. Following the brief stint, the singer turned to songwriting to earn a living.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“I never wanted to be a songwriter,” Muni told NPR. “I only did it so that I could eat. The way songwriters get treated, the way they get stolen from, the way they get abused, really.”\n\nShe went on to explain that she always intended to return to the spotlight, and her moniker, Muni Long, was the perfect avenue for her reintroduction to the public.\n\nDuring her songwriting days, the “Made for Me” songstress penned hits for several popular acts and her writing skills are undeniable. From Chris Brown to Rihanna, Muni has worked with a litany of stars. Here are some of Muni’s best songwriting credits.\n\n“Don’t Wake Me Up” — Chris Brown\n\nIn 2012, Muni Long partnered with Chris Brown and his writing team – which included Alain Whyte, Alessandro Benassi, and Brian Kenney – to help create the song “Don’t Wake Me Up.” The track is featured on Chris’ fifth studio album, Fortune, as the fourth single.\n\nThe song spent 28 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 10.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Timber” — Pitbull (featuring Kesha)\n\nPitbull and Kesha’s 2013 song “Timber” was a smash hit. The single spent three weeks atop the Hot 100, becoming one of the most popular releases of that year.\n\nAccording to BBC, “Timber” sold more than 9.6 million copies worldwide and was certified diamond. However, some may not know that Muni had a writing credit on the popular song.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“California King Bed” — Rihanna\n\nOne of Muni’s most significant songwriting credits is Rihanna’s “California King Bed.” Released as part of her fifth studio album, Loud, the song takes listeners through a heart-wrenching story about a couple that has grown apart.\n\nThe track marked a pivotal moment for both artists. Thanks to the success of “California King Bed,” Muni was able to land gigs working with Chris Brown and others. Meanwhile, Loud went on to sell more than 6 million copies worldwide, according to Best Selling Albums.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Bacon” — Nick Jonas (featuring Ty Dolla $ign)\n\nIn 2016, Nick Jonas released his third studio album, Last Year Was Complicated, and Muni served as a writer for two of the tracks. The songwriter is credited on “Bacon,” which features Ty Dolla $ign, and “Touch.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Infidelity” — Mariah Carey\n\nMuni solidified her place as one of the hottest songwriters around, by working with GRAMMY-winning superstar Mariah Carey. Muni contributed to two Mariah songs as a writer and a background vocalist.\n\nIn 2015, Muni penned “Infinity” for Mariah’s compilation album, #1 to Infinity. Three years later, the duo joined forces again. Muni helped write the iconic track “A No No,” which served as the second single from Mariah’s fifteenth studio album."
