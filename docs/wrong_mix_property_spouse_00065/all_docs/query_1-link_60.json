        "text": "Chris Brown says he thought about suicide after he beat up then-girlfriend Rihanna the night before the 2009 Grammys.\n\nPoor Chris Brown.\n\nA trailer for “Welcome to my Life: The Official Chris Brown Documentary” has been released, made by Riveting Entertainment, the film seems to paint the picture of Brown as a victim of his own success and chronicles how he overcame all the negative publicity to keep his career alive, after being convicted of felony assault.\n\nPardon me while I stop to gag for a minute or two.\n\nThe clips featured names like Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Lopez, Usher, Mike Tyson, and Mary J. Blige, all talking about Brown.\n\n“This is the first time I get to say anything,” Brown says, in the clip.\n\nReally? Chris Brown hasn”t had a chance to explain himself in seven years?\n\n“I went from being on top of the world, No. 1 songs, being kind of like America”s sweetheart to being Public Enemy No. 1,” Brown said.\n\nThat”s what happens when you beat and choke your former girlfriend into unconsciousness.\n\n“I felt like a (expletive) monster,” Brown said. “I was thinking about suicide, I wasn”t sleeping, I barely ate.”\n\nPoor Chris Brown.\n\nBrown, whose career has remained strong, despite everyone picking on him, said near the end of the clip “If there was ever a doubt in your mind Chris Brown was done, he was finished … I wouldn”t bet on it.”\n\nUgh.\n\nThe trailer didn”t specify a release date, only that it”s coming “soon.”"
