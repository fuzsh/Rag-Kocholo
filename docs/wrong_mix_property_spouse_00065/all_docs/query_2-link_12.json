        "text": "Now that Rihanna's ANTI album is finally out, it's time to take a closer look at the official production and songwriter credits on the project. It's no secret that Rihanna isn't one to shy away from collaborations, which always gives her albums an added level of excitement based on the wide range of artists she worked with.\n\nWhile ANTI only has two listed feature artists—SZA and Drake—the actual credits on the album are filled with big names like Travi$ Scott, Jeff Bhasker​, the-Dream, James Fauntleroy, PARTYNEXTDOOR, and more. On the production side, the likes of Timbaland, DJ Mustard, No I.D., Hit-Boy, and more all contributed to the project.

Glass: Frequent Rihanna collaborator Glass John, who is probably best known for publicly blaming Travi$ Scott for the delay of ANTI, as well as his work with other artists including Chris Brown.\n\nJeff Bhasker: Listed above.\n\n\"Work\"\n\nProducers:\n\nMatthew Samuels: Producer known in the industry as Boi-1da who regularly works with Drake.\n\nComposers/Lyricits:\n\nAubrey Graham: Drake, obviously.\n\nJahron Braithwaite: OVO singer/songwriter best known as PARTYNEXTDOOR.\n\nR.
