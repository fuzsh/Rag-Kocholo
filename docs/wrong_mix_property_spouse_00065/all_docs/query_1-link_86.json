        "text": "Raz B\n\nBack when social media was still in its obscure infancy circa late 2010, Chris Brown got trolled by Raz B. The former B2K member tweeted, “I’m just sitting here thinking how can n***as like [Eric Benet] & [Chris Brown] disrespect women as intelligent as [Halle Berry] [and] Rihanna.”\n\nThis spawned a homophobic attack, with Brown teasing Raz B about his child molestation claims.\n\n“@RazB2K n***a you want attention! Grow up n***a!!! D*ck in the booty a** little boy,” Brown barked.\n\nHe continued, “Tell me this @RazB2K!! Why when the money was coming in you weren’t complaining about getting butt-plugged! #homothug!!! I ain’t deleting my tweet either!! I was minding my damn business and Peter Pan decides to pop off!!! #whatalame.”\n\nBrown claimed that he wasn’t homophobic. “He’s just disrespectful!!!,” he exclaimed before concluding, “I’m not mad though!!! I’m just not silent nor am I one of these scary R&B cats!!”\n\nThings went left when others, including Omarion and Raz-B’s brother, got involved, but thankfully, it never got physical.\n\nMeek Mill\n\nChris Brown and Meek got into it over the rapper’s alleged romance with Rihanna. Speculation of tension began after Breezy removed Meek from his 2012 album, Fortune.\n\nMeek’s Twitter fingers fired off a round that read, “[These] chicks belong 2 da game… not u! Never get confused and that’s all u!”\n\nBrown quickly replied, “She’s a dream chaser! There are a lot of dreamers so she’ll be running forever!”\n\nHowever, after a rumored physical altercation at a New York City nightclub, the men squashed their beef right where it started. “Me and @MeekMill ain’t on that bulls**t. Real respect Real….,” Brown tweeted.\n\nMeek co-signed the mutual agreement by responding, “Naw, we just getting money!”\n\nDrake\n\nDrake and Chris Brown got into a scuffle at a New York City nightclub back in 2012, reportedly over Rihanna. Brown was left with a minor injury, but in two years, their beef was temporarily squashed.\n\nIn 2015, Breezy reignited the feud by bashing Drake on Hot 97. “We’re not getting no check from talking about dude. We’re giving him all this pub. We’re us. I can’t keep making these motherf**kers famous. I’m responsible for reviving a lot of careers,” Brown barked.\n\nDrake responded live when he switched the lyrics to “Energy” while performing in New Zealand. It went from “I got rap n***as that I gotta act like I like” to him saying, “I got R&B n***as that I gotta act like I like.”\n\nBy 2019, Drake and Brown squashed the drama to collaborate on “No Guidance,” with Drake telling Rap Radar, “You know, really at the end of the day when you kind of step away from it and break it down you start to feel silly ’cause it’s over girl stuff, you know? But obviously, that can snowball into real sh–t and that’s what happened in this situation.”\n\nFrank Ocean\n\nIn January 2013, TMZ reported that Frank Ocean was “jumped” by Chris Brown. The outlet noted that the latter was attempting to leave a studio in West Hollywood, but Ocean and his “crew” allegedly prevented that. “This is my studio, this is my parking spot,” Ocean reportedly said.\n\nBrown reportedly punched the blonde singer, whom later tweeted, “Got jumped by Chris and a couple guys. Cut my finger now I can’t play w two hands at the Grammys.” Ocean also allegedly labeled Brown “Ike Turner.”\n\nDuring the brawl, Ocean revealed that someone yelled out the slur “fa***t,” but he’s unsure of who.\n\nThe Game\n\nThe Game and Chris Brown got into a verbal sparring match in 2015 after the rapper began following Brown’s ex, Karrueche, on Instagram.\n\nBrown commented on Game’s movements, saying, “Someone must have something they need to promote. It’s sad people need gimmicks to maintain fame. All pub is good pub I guess.”\n\nPer BET, Game responded with a threat. “Keep throwing subliminals n***a…We both know when it’s ME vs. YOU who gone come out on top punk…. I still owe you one for that s**t you pulled…We both know yo time coming blood. Now gone call who u gone call n tell who u gone tell…That ain’t gone stop me from knockin’ yo a** out when I see you #YouKnowMe.”\n\nThe rapper also took shots at Brown by name-dropping Karrueche in his song, “All Eyez.” Years later, Game clarified that he and Brown never had real beef and called him a “real n***a.”\n\nBrian McKnight\n\nChris Brown found himself at odds with Brian McKnight in 2012. While peddling some new music titled “iFUrReadyToLearn,” where McKnight sings, “Let me show you how your p***y works, since you didn’t bring it to me first/I have lots of things to show you if you’re ready to learn,” he mentioned Chris Brown’s public scandals to refute the backlash over the record’s explicit content.\n\nHe tweeted, “Since everyone’s so opinionated I’m taking suggestions on what I should do next I’m thinking rent a lambo and beat the s**t outta my girl […] That’s acceptable these days.” Many assumed this was a jab at Brown’s altercation with ex-girlfriend Rihanna.\n\nBrown, in turn, called the “Back At One” crooner “old” and “irrelevant.”\n\n“I see how this works now… When peoples careers get to the ‘nobody cares’ stage they use my name for publicity! Lol. I can’t keep helping these old n***as. Its miracle the way I’m bringing the dead alive!,” Brown quipped. “I would’ve gladly wrote you something that would make u look less irrelevant! Listening to ‘let me show u how ur P works’!!!! THAT S**T IS TRASH! If u need help just ask!”\n\nTyson Beckford\n\nTyson Beckford was another male who got into a verbal argument with Chris Brown over his ex-girlfriend, Karrueche. After the models were seen posted up together on Instagram, Brown pulled a swift post-and-delete.\n\n“Keep playing I’ma f**k ya baby momma and then whoop you child like he mine,” tweeted the singer.\n\nBeckford didn’t give into Brown’s tantrum, but the latter apologized days later, blaming his antics on light-skinned tendencies.\n\n“I’m light skin! I’m always in my feelings! No drama! People are really starting to make this s**t an issue. I can be a real one and say that I was wrong for even pressing an issue. I can be a man about it,” said the singer.\n\nUsher\n\nMany consider Usher and Chris Brown to be contemporaries, but who would’ve thought it’d become a full-fledged rumored rivalry?\n\nJust before Lovers & Friends Fest 2023, TMZ reported that the crooners got into an altercation after Brown allegedly disrespected Teyana Taylor.\n\nThe “Yo (Excuse Me Miss)” singer reportedly blamed Taylor for his scrapped Michael Jackson tribute at the American Music Awards. Both men wound up performing at Lovers & Friends and Brown addressed the “fight” on Instagram, telling fans to “keep ya narrative.”\n\nUsher clarified to The Breakfast Club that there are “no issues” between him and “that man,” adding, “We good.”\n\nOffset\n\nQuavo wasn’t the first Migos member to exchange words with Breezy. When 21 Savage experienced his issues with ICE, Brown cracked jokes using a meme of 21 rapping over Big Shaq’s “Man’t Not Hot.”\n\nOffset didn’t appreciate the singer’s taunting and commented on the post, “Memes ain’t funny lame.”\n\nBrown reacted by throwing ageist insults, accusing the rapper of drug abuse and inviting him to settle the dust at his home.\n\n“If he don’t get his EARTH WIND AND FIRE pootytang space suits WEARING CAP A** LIL BOY da f**k out my comments and off my d**k,” the singer added. Offset replied by commenting on Brown’s own alleged substance abuse issues. “Coke head don’t want [smoke emoji],” said Offset. Now, Brown is at war with Quavo."
