        "text": "R&B star Ne-Yo and hip-hop heartthrob Bow Wow have become the most recent artists to open up about Chris Brown’s alleged abuse of Rihanna. They separately offered their own opinion on the ordeal.\n\n“I mean, being in the business, the first thing is ‘Ah, it’s false, another rumor, bloggers just wanting to have traffic to their site,'” Bow Wow told OK! magazine, “but when the story was unfolding, it was kind of shocking to all. Chris is a good friend of mine. We’ve had the opportunity to tour together. And then Rihanna, she’s just a beautiful person. Period. Never done no wrong to nobody.”\n\nThe rapper continued, “At the end of the day I’ve always believed in whatever happens with people’s business… my mom always told me don’t get into. And the situation is so major, I think they just need their space and I think they need to deal with it… I’m praying for them both.”\n\nAs for the photo leaked by TMZ.com on Thursday showing Rihanna’s bruises, Bow Wow said it was “just shocking. I mean, we heard what happened, but we really didn’t get a visual for it. But I mean hey, man. The picture speaks for itself.”\n\nNe-Yo, who said he has spoken to Rihanna since the incident, told MTV that the photo “hurt me to my heart, man. Again, I still don’t know what happened, ’cause I haven’t had the opportunity to talk to Chris yet. But to take it to that level really hurt my heart. All I can say is, I’m praying for both of them. They’re both in my prayers. I haven’t had a chance to talk to Chris yet. I just wanna sit down and talk to that dude and just explain if he doesn’t understand: ‘That’s not something that’s excusable, bruh. You have to get a little smarter about whatever it is going on in your relationship. You have to get a little smarter about how you handle certain situations.'”\n\nStill, Ne-Yo refused to be Brown’s judge and jury. “I’m not going to crucify him,” Ne-Yo said. “I’m not going to do that. That’s still my homeboy at the end of the day. For it to go to that level was wrong. I won’t say who was responsible. I won’t pick no sides. I’m just saying it was wrong [that] it had to happen like that, and I’m praying for the both of them.”"
