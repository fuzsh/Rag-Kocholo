        "text": "The most troubling moment at the 55th annual Grammy Awards in February came when Rihanna performed her yearning love ballad “Stay.” Accompanied only by a pianist and (briefly) fellow singer Mikky Ekko, she dialed back her sexpot image and proudly risqué stage persona. Instead, she gently swayed and poured her heart into such longing lyrics as: Funny, you’re the broken one / But I’m the only one who needed saving… I can’t live without you…\n\nThese lyrics were inspired by Rihanna’s abusive boyfriend, Chris Brown.\n\nYes, the same Chris Brown who beat her bloody the night before the 2009 Grammys, was convicted of felony assault and has a June court hearing to determine if he reneged on his 180 days of community service.\n\nIn 2009, Rihanna was set to testify against Brown before he took a plea bargain. But their break-up was short-lived and they reconciled.\n\nTwo months ago, Brown accompanied Rihanna on the red carpet outside the Grammys and cuddled with her inside. The two duet on “Nobody’s Business,” an alarmingly buoyant song on her latest album, the emotionally conflicted and commercially exploitative “Unapologetic.” Her current “Diamonds” tour, which includes a Thursday, April 11 stop here at Valley View Casino Center, is in support of the album.\n\nRihanna professed her undying love for Brown in a recent Rolling Stone interview, saying of Brown: “He’s giving and loving.” She also declared: “Even if it’s a mistake, it’s my mistake.”\n\nThat is, of course, Rihanna’s right, as it is for other women who return to the men who beat them. But Rihanna has nearly 70 million Facebook followers, including many impressionable girls, who see her as a role model, not a cautionary example. And while Brown isn’t on her tour, his long shadow will be felt at her San Diego concert and for some time to come.\n\nIf her latest album, and his for that matter, addressed human failings and the quest for forgiveness and redemption, the result could be a valuable learning moment — for them and their fans. Instead, his album find him boasting in song: I’m winnin’, you heard about my image, but I could give a flyin’ (expletive) who’s offended, while Rihanna’s album finds her singing such apparently irony-free lines as: Your love hit me to the core and I’m prepared to die in the moment.\n\nReally?\n\nYouthful indiscretions and failings are a part of growing up — and plenty of adults (present company included) dig holes, figuratively speaking, and fall into them on a regular basis. But flaunting inexcusable behavior, as Brown does, is as bad as Rihanna excusing that behavior. It’s doubly dismaying when both appear oblivious to the same implications their songs seem to celebrate.\n\nFor listeners of any age, that’s a pity."
