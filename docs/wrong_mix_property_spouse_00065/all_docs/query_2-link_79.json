Clothing line and Art In 2012 Chris launched his clothing Black Pyramid which is now a street wear brand that has collaborated with other street wear brand such as Pink Dolphin, BAPE and more.

Target Audience Chris began his career as a teenager which made him appeal to girl =<13 due to his age and “PG” lyrics, this made him a hearttrob to young girls, and males aspired to be like him. “His hits, such as the yearning \"With You\" and his duet with his imaginary Juliet, Jordin Sparks, \"No Air,\" have bottled the overflowing earnestness of beginner- level love. When he got racy with the full-grown and lecherous pop star T-Pain in the video for his \"Kiss Kiss,\" Brown wore a schoolboy's outfit: He was a family kind of star. ”(BET) However, the Rihanna incident in 2009 shattered Chris’ image and made him lose many female fans. This impacted his music as it became more mature, especially with F.A.M.E which contained many explicit tracks. This narrowed his target audience to 15< females and males. Moreover, his artistry and dancing attracts people outside of his target audience.\n\n13.
