        "text": "Rihanna inspires millions of people, song after song, failing to disappoint. She has albums full of more prominent songs, however one seemed to completely captivate me. \"What Now\" is a song that makes one feel everything that needs to be felt. Whatever emotions one has built up inside aches and pleads to released. She is talking about having someone there, but eventually she realizes that she has changed. Not knowing what to do, where to go, or how to live anymore, all of her emotions are waiting to come out. She bellows, \"And I just wanna scream.\" This is the only way she expresses her despair, passion and sorrow. This is where the poetic elements come into play. No, the lines in the stanzas or choruses do not rhyme nor do they have a rhyme scheme. However realizing that the stanzas and the lines have a certain emotional rhythm and pace, completely validates this song's representation in search for poetic elements. By simply reading the carefully chosen lyrics in the song, one can understand the pain and anguish she is going through. This song represents a victim, lost within herself, with no answers trying to survive through the one chance she has at life. By merely thinking about that statement, it makes me reevaluate my own life. Do I really know where I am going? Do I know who I am? I understand now that life is not about just going through the motions, its about actually, truly living. I am alive, I am strong, and I am going to genuinely live life.\n\n\"What Now\"\n\nI've been ignoring this big lump in my throat\n\nI shouldn't be crying,\n\ntears were for the weaker days\n\nI'm stronger now, or so I say,\n\nBut something's missing\n\nWhatever it is,\n\nit feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror\n\nWhatever it is,\n\nit's just laughing at me\n\nAnd I just wanna scream\n\nWhat now? I just can't figure it out\n\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)\n\nWhat now? Oh, oh, oh, oh! What now?\n\nI found the one, he changed my life\n\nBut was it me that changed\n\nAnd he just happened to come at the right time\n\nI'm supposed to be in love\n\nBut I'm numb again\n\nWhatever it is,\n\nit feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror\n\nWhatever it is,\n\nit's just sitting there laughing at me\n\nAnd I just wanna scream\n\nWhat now? I just can't figure it out\n\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)\n\nWhat now? Please tell me\n\nWhat now?\n\nThere's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all\n\nThe more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone\n\n'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions\n\nI can't even get the emotions to come out\n\nDry as a bone, but I just wanna shout\n\nWhat now? I just can't figure it out\n\nWhat now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)\n\nWhat now? Somebody tell me\n\nWhat now?\n\nI don't know where to go\n\nI don't know what to feel\n\nI don't know how to cry\n\nI don't know oh oh why\n\nI don't know where to go\n\nI don't know what to feel\n\nI don't know how to cry\n\nI don't know oh oh why\n\nI don't know where to go\n\nI don't know what to feel\n\nI don't know how to cry\n\nI don't know oh oh why\n\nSo what now?"
