        "text": "She's a pop songwriting machine by day and an actress by night. The hilariously colorful Ester Dean, who plays Cynthia Rose in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, is also responsible for co-writing some of this year's biggest pop hits (Um, hits like Katy Perry's \"Firework\" and Rihanna's \"What's My Name\"!!!) She's even worked with Mary J. Blige, Chris Brown, and Nicki Minaj to boot. I had a phone date with her earlier this week, and she entertained me all the way through it. Get ready to be obsessed.\n\nGlamour: So, you're known as a songwriter. How did you get your first acting gig as Cynthia Rose in Pitch Perfect?\n\nEster: It was so random, I went in to see them about music, and they asked if I'd ever done live action. I didn't even know what live action was. Then I auditioned, and they called a few days later and told me I got the part, and that I'd have to be in Baton Rouge for three months. I was still working on Rihanna's album and Ice Age at the same time. So I wrote \"Where Have You Been\" while I was in Baton Rouge.\n\nGlamour: Talk me through your song writing process. What comes first—words or music?\n\nEster: I write by myself and then deliver the song. Everybody knows, leave Ester alone when she's in her zone. Give me a studio and the tracks, and I'll call you when the doctor is done.\n\nGlamour: What's the songwriting process like for you?\n\nEster: I'm a very emotional writer. I always need to have a boyfriend. I always need to have some food. I always need to have a heater at my feet, and I drink this thing called Cool Brew, which I found in Louisiana. It's like condensed coffee. I normally work like a vampire. Around 8 to 9pm, what I call \"the spirits\" actually show up, and then I just go in the booth and scream on top of a track. I only sing on the mic. I don't sit down and write anything.\n\nGlamour: So you need a boyfriend to write songs, or will a love interest do?\n\nEster: A love interest will do. I will make up a crush, you hear me?! I will look at a guy and say, for two months at least, \"I think you're cute.\" And then I can be psycho. I will go in my head and make a whole life with him, he don't even understand why I'm mad at him. I'm like… \"cause you came in late last night!\" And he's like \"I don't even know you.\"\n\nGlamour: Nice…\n\nEster: I really think musicians are crazy. We go into a small little room that's padded (psycho!), you close the door, turn off the lights, you sit there, and you sing into a piece of metal. I don't like anybody to see me loose my mind. I jump up and down, and my hands are moving, like some kind of revival. If my engineer tries to say something, I'm like…\"You are not here, I'm not with you. I'm in the club with some vampires or something.\" You don't want anybody to come into your crazy. And that's why you need artists like a Rihanna or a Nicki that allow you to be crazy. To say, \"Hey, I'm not going to mess with her process.\"\n\nGlamour: Let's talk about Pitch Perfect. Had you ever sung a cappella before? What was that like?\n\nEster: I can sing a cappella, I just didn't understand the idea of making music with your mouth. It's crazy to be able to break down a beat with your mouth.\n\nGlamour: Did everyone have to get training?\n\nEster: We had classes that taught us how to sing together with the sounds and the words. I did the bass with my mouth. It was so hard, and then it was even harder to add dance to it.__\n\nGlamour: The movie is so much fun. What was it like on set?\n\nEster: I was new to it, and I really gravitated to Rebel and Hana Mae [Lee]. I knew of Anna Camp because I'm in love with Cashmere Mafia, so when I met her, I was like, \"You're the girl from Cashmere Mafia.\" She was only in it for one minute, she was a babysitter, but I thought she was so good. She was supposed to be this bitch, and she played it so well.\n\nGlamour: How did she feel when you told her you were an uber fan from Cashmere Mafia?\n\nEster: She was so embarrassed. I had also seen her again on Up All Night. I always see her, I love her actually. I think she's awesome.\n\nGlamour: So, what's next?\n\nEster: I just like to grow and stay creative. I'm doing my own animation film. I just finished a song for someone I love, and I know she's going to kill it. I'm in the studio now. And I just talked to Nicki [Minaj], and we are doing something. There is so much going on in my life that if I complain, I should shoot myself. Or maybe it's just the lady's day of the month.\n\nGlamour: Well congrats on the everything, especially the movie. I can't wait to see it again.\n\nEster: We'll talk again! And next time, I'll be like… I just made a spaceship. And I'm flying to Mars or something like that.\n\n__Are you going to see Pitch Perfect this weekend?\n\nPhoto Credit: Ester Dean and Woozy Collins"
