Despite his recently tarnished image, crooner Chris Brown may win an NAACP Image Award.

The 19-year-old singer, who's accused in a domestic dispute that reportedly involves pop superstar Rihanna, is in the running for outstanding male artist at the 40th annual awards. The awards are being presented Thursday night at the Shrine Auditorium and airing on Fox.

Brown won the outstanding male artist trophy last year.

Rihanna, his longtime girlfriend, is up for outstanding female artist.

It's unclear if either Brown or Rihanna will attend. Both canceled their appearances and performances at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Other nominees for outstanding male artist are Common, Jamie Foxx, John Legend and will.i.am. Alicia Keys, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson and Mariah Carey are also nominated for outstanding female artist.

Over 30 awards honoring television, film, music and literature are to be handed out in categories such as outstanding reality series, literary work, jazz artist, music video and documentary.

Television shows including "The Game," ''Tyler Perry's House of Payne," ''Ugly Betty," ''Everybody Hates Chris" and "Grey's Anatomy" are nominated for multiple awards. "Cadillac Records," ''Miracle at St. Anna," ''The Secret Life of Bees," ''Seven Pounds" and "The Family That Preys" are nominated for outstanding motion picture.

The 40th annual Image Awards coincide with the 100th anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and will kick off a yearlong centennial celebration.
