        "text": "Home > Research Guides > Tazewell County Cemeteries\n\nTazewell County Cemeteries\n\n“Show me your cemeteries and I will tell you what kind of people you have.”\n\nHere's a list of all known cemeteries located in Tazewell County.\n\nThe Tazewell County Genealogical & Historical Society has published records for the majority of these cemeteries. In addition to the tombstone inscriptions, we used sexton & cemetery association records, funeral home records, death certificates, and obituaries to construct these listings. In some cases, we have listings for cemeteries that no longer physically exist.\n\nIf you'd like to purchase any of the listings, determine which township contains the cemetery you are interested in - then order the appropriate volume of the Tazewell County Cemetery Records. Or, if you wish, we can look it up for you as part of our Research Services.\n\nSearch Tips:\n\nThe list is initially shown in Cemetery name order. You can reorder the list by Township or Section by clicking on the triangle in the corresponding column header.\n\nAs you enter criteria into a search box, the display will automatically change to show only matching rows.\n\nUse the upper Search Box to search the entire database. For example, if you enter \"Dillon\", the display changes to those rows that contain a Cemetery containing \"Dillon\", or a Also Known As containing \"Dillon\", or a Township containing \"Dillon\".\n\nUse the boxes at the bottom of each column to limit your search only to that column's content. Suggested uses:\n\nCemetery - limit the rows displayed to just those cemeteries you are researching.\n\nTownship – limit the display to only cemeteries in a certain township.\n\nCombination - by placing criteria into multiple boxes you can do more sophisticated searches. For instance, all Unknown cemeteries in Delavan Township. However, don't forget to use the clear filters button at upper right to delete any earlier searches or you may get unexpected results!\n\nOK - I'm ready! Let's Search!"
