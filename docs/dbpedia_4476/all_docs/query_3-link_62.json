Was renamed in the 1950s by Livingston Mulligan of the Barber-Mulligan Farm to honor the builder of the farm, Aaron Barber Jr. Hartwell Road, just over the town and county line in Rush, Monroe County, was previously called Barber Road but was officially changed around the same time to reflect the pioneer Hartwells of that road and the builders of the cobblestone house on Hartwell Road. (Source: Holly Watson and Mulligan family oral history, 2014)\n\nBeckwith Road – no longer exists except for a driveway and farm lane; connected Jenks Road and Rt. 15 about ½ mile south of and parallel to North Avon Road.

Operated from 1898-1934 (www.esphs.org).\n\nWadsworth Cove - on Conesus Lake.\n\nWadsworth Oaks - See Oneida Woods. So-called because it was believed that pioneer James Wadsworth cleared the land, leaving scattered oak trees for shade. Twenty-first century research by SUNY Geneseo scholars shows that the “oak openings” habitat (meadows with large oak and/or hickory trees in the open) was a result of traditional Seneca land practices, including habitat management with fire. The ensuing early nineteenth century land practices by the Wadsworths preserved the existing oak openings habitat.\n\nWheeler’s Gully - about ¾ mile from Nations Road off Rt. 39 to the west (Jaycox Creek). Stable and clubhouse erected by Rochester Riders’ Club across from GVHC Kennels at Wheeler’s Gully (from Livingston Dem. 6/16/1926).\n\nCottonwood Point – Located in the extreme northeast corner of the town of Groveland on Conesus Lake.

Co. Directory). Letters to the editor of the Livingston County Leader in 1951 discussed East Groveland and Hunt’s Corners, with general consensus that East Groveland covered a larger area and that Hunt’s Corners was just the crossroads at the center of the hamlet. See also Hunt’s Corners.\n\nGaw-she-gweh-oh - a Seneca village near Williamsburgh, also spelled Casawavalatetah, Gaghchegwalahale, Kasawasahya, etc. by European Americans in 1779.

The area was marked as East Groveland on the 1840 Burr map, then called Groveland Corners through the 1850s. By the late 1860s, it had become simply Groveland, matching the post office (source: 1868 Liv. Co. Directory, 1872 map). In 1973, because Groveland Station had, according to some, also become just Groveland by this time, the US Board on Geographic Names voted to change the name of the northern Groveland back to Groveland Corners. This left Groveland Station as the only Groveland in the town. (Times-Union, 6/27/1974.) Groveland Corners is also called Groveland Hill by many residents.\n\nGroveland Hill – at Aten Road and Groveland Hill Road; some have called it Magee Hill.

It had been known as North Sparta from about 1874, when the post office by that name was moved over the town line into Groveland, until 1899, when it was called Groveland Station because of the DL&W and Dansville and Mt. Morris Railroad stations and activity there. The post office became Groveland in 1924, but most residents still call it Groveland Station. (Sources: Smith’s History of Livingston County and Times-Union, 6/27/1974.)\n\nGypsy Lane – the road leading to the Livingston County Hampton Corners Campus, off of Rt. 63; according to Don Higgins, county highway superintendent, and former County Administrator Nick Mazza in 2019, the road used to be a dirt lane, at the end of which transient groups sometimes stayed.\n\nHampton Corners - The area on Rt. 63 now occupied by the American Rock Salt mine and the Livingston County complex.

The first post office to operate here in 1872 was called Son Yea, but was changed to Sonyea in 1876 (www.esphs.org). The name could translate to “a sunny, warm place” (Letchworth, Life and Work, by J. N. Larned, 1912, p. 334), but more likely comes from “son-he” (a Seneca name meaning Thou Art Living There, signifying a favorite dwelling place) or from Seneca Captain Snow (Soneage or Soyeawa) (Source: Aboriginal Place Names of NY, p.109).\n\nA persistent rumor continues to circulate that the name is an acronym for “State Of New York Epileptic Asylum.” However, this was never an official name for the institution and the name Sonyea was used for the area in the early 1800s, long before Craig Colony for Epileptics opened in 1896. See also Shaker Settlement.\n\nWilliamsburgh – The earliest planned European-American settlement in Livingston County, located in the northwest corner of the town of Groveland, near the confluence of the Genesee River and Canaseraga Creek.

Williamsburgh was established in 1792 and briefly occupied by German settlers, but the village never reached its expected potential. The Williamsburgh Cemetery is all that remains of the settlement.\n\nBloody Hollow – Located at Little Beard’s Creek on the western edge of the town of Leicester near Brian Road. According to former Leicester Town Historian Velma Mahoney, it was named because sisters were murdered there. A farm on Alverson Road, just over the line in Perry, operating in the 1970s and 1980s, was called Bloody Hollow Farm (D&C 5/12/1985). See also Crooked S.\n\nBump’s Island – An island formed by a tight bend in the Genesee River in the 1800s; formerly it belonged to the town of Leicester, but when the river cut a new channel to the north, it eventually became part of the Mt. Morris flats on the north side of Rt. 408. The name comes from the Bump family who owned lots on the island at one time (1902 map).

(Sources: Amie Alden 2017; various newspaper accounts with descriptions)\n\nDutch Corners – The southeast corner of Leicester on the river flats, marked in the 21st century by a dead-end road, called Dutch Corners Road, south off Jones Bridge Road. The Jones family were longtime residents here and Wadsworth farms on the flats in 1902 were called Dutch Corners East and West. Dutch Corners Road and Perry Road once made an ell on the flats, but by the late 1970s, both became dead ends due to encroachment by the river (Batavia Daily News, 1/18/1978).\n\nGa-neh-da-ont-weh - Seneca name meaning “where the hemlock was spilled,” located at present-day Leicester village (Indian Names of NY, Beauchamp, p.37); see also Moscow.\n\nGibsonville – A vanished hamlet in the southwestern corner of the town of Leicester, now part of Letchworth State Park.

According to village minutes, the election of Mar. 20, 1917, put the proposition to change the name to the voters. Velma Maloney says in 1976: the purpose was to match the village, post office, and railroad station names. There was a Moscow, PA, just over the border and there was confusion with railroad mail and freight. She also wrote, “There are a few that maintain that the Moscow Revolution entered into the matter.” (Related to international relations with Russia and the rise of the Bolsheviks during World War I.)\n\nMoscow Landing - A stop along the Genesee Valley Canal near Jones Bridge Road and River Road intersection.

There was a St. Helena post office between 1840-1841, which may have afterward become the post office at nearby River Road Forks (New York Postal History, Kay and Smith, 1982). Changing patterns of the Genesee River and seasonal flooding decreased the number of residents at St. Helena by the early twentieth century. The hamlet was fully abandoned by the construction of the Mt. Morris Dam in 1951 due to the resulting flooding upriver at St. Helena.\n\nScipio Road – In the southeast part of Mt.

NY State did not agree, so the merchants had a new ditch dug at a cost of $6000, intending to extend the canal. In 1844, when they almost reached the state-dug portion, they fought a group of men sent by officials to prevent the completion. The merchants won, and in victory, made the final cuts through the bank, allowing water to fill their waterway. The fight took place near Dock Street, and so the street along the new branch of the canal was called Battle Street. In the early 1950s, the street name was temporarily changed to Booth Avenue, but changed back when the historical significance was pointed out. (Wilfred Rauber, 1957)\n\nCalifornia House - at junction of Rt. 63 and Stone Falls Road, mentioned in newspapers as early as 1852.

See also The Rocks.\n\nThe Rocks – known as such in 1957, according to Wilfred Rauber; the entrance to Poag’s Hole, where there were once mills.\n\n“Nearby recreational bathing in the ‘good old summertime’ besides a couple obscure ‘skinny-dipping’ swimming holes, was the rocks where the Canaseraga Creek meandered out of Poag’s Hole. Its water temperature was pleasant but its depth limited diving to shallow and its area not much larger than some present day backyard facilities. Privacy for changing to swimwear or street clothes was at the horse stables of a generous neighbor.” (From Genesee Country Express, 4/17/1986 p.1)\n\nRushbottom – another name for the Canaseraga Creek for the abundant rushes that fed cattle during the first winters (source: Miniature of Dansville Village, Clark, p.11).\n\nSky Farm – Possibly a name, dating back to the 1870s, for the crown of East Hill, on which the Jackson Sanitorium was built.

Coopersville was later known as Nunda Junction (1902 atlas).\n\nDalton – first known as Nunda Station for the Erie RR stop; was a produce and shipping center. Some say when the name was changed from Nunda Station in 1881, there were nominations for Ayro (for leading produce merchant Lyman Ayrault), Parkertown (for Sanford Parker), and Omaha. Apparently, Mr. or Mrs W. G. Haines suggested Dalton because the people of Dalton, GA, had befriended soldiers in the Civil War; the name was selected (Sources: Nunda News 1/5/1956, Nunda News 3/16/1981). The Nunda Station Post Office was established in 1856 and became Dalton Post Office in 1881 (www.esphs.org).\n\nEast Hill – In southeast corner of town, now the Rattlesnake Hill Wildlife Management Area.

The post office, as it moved from Hunts Hollow to the more active Hunt to the southwest, changed names several times: from Hunts Hollow to Hunts in 1873, to Hunt in mid-1893, to Kishawa in late 1893, and back to Hunt in early 1894. The short time as Kishawa was an attempt by some to resurrect return to indigenous names, before a petition was filed and it was returned to Hunt (New York Postal History, Kay and Smith 1982; Nunda News 12/16/1893).\n\nHunts Hollow – The area around Hunts Hollow was first called Kishawa (many variations on spelling), the Seneca name for the place.

A stub of it was said to be visible until about 1880. (Source: History of the Township of Springwater, p.13; ref. in 1842 to Liberty Pole in Springwater Circuit Sunday School Record Book, 1842-1871, p.64). Prior to 1815, Liberty Pole area was called Whitlock’s Tavern after Ira Whitlock, who operated an inn there.\n\nLime Kiln Creek / Lime Kiln Gully – A creek that runs through the center of the town; perhaps gets its name from a Mr. Tilden who operated lime kilns on the south side of the gully in the early 1800s (Robinson, History of the Township…).\n\nMarrowback – the Marrowback Hills rise to about 1200’ running mostly north and south in the Towns of Conesus and Springwater, west of Hemlock Lake. The Marrowback Road area spans a region between Marrowback Road and Hemlock Lake. The name, according to Wm. P. Boyd’s History of Conesus, “derived its name in the following singular way: In the early days of the town, the settlers had for amusement, general trainings, lasting several days at a time. One of these gala days was being held near the present village of Livonia Centre, and among the artistic sports, they formed a ring, and in the same, placed two of their most noted wrestlers, in ‘hors-de-combat.’ One of these lived near Lima, the other was from Conesus or Marrowback hills. After a severe struggle, the man from Marrowback threw his opponent, and to the merriment of all, a gentleman in the circle clapped his hands and exclaimed: ‘That man has too much marrow-in-his-back for you.”…these hills were christened ‘Marrowback hills.’ (ref. in 1842 to Marrowback in Springwater Circuit Sunday School Record Book, 1842-1871, p.34)\n\nPleasant Valley – area of Scribner Rd. and Rt. 36, on bend of Town Line Road.\n\nPokey Moonshine / Pokamoonshine – Pokey Moonshine Road connects Carney Road and Becker Road and has many possibly name origins:\n\nPokey Moonshine likely refers to a “poke of moonshine,” a poke meaning a sack.\n\nAccording to Beauchamp, who comments on “Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain” in the Adirondacks, it could be derived from Alquonquin words pohqui, meaning “it is broken” and moosi, meaning “smooth.” Pohqui-moosi would translate to “where the rocks are smoothly broken off.” (Aboriginal Place Names of NY, Beauchamp.) Some cliffs around Pokey Moonshine Road are steep.\n\nThe indigenous word pohkunni is variously translated by other scholars as “dark” or “night,” or “between two hills.” (Edward Ruttenber and Indian Geographical Names by Tooker)\n\nA theory in the 1950s held the name originates with a local Native American leader named Po-Ko Moonshine, though no one by this name has been identified.\n\nPunkey / Punky Hollow – Harvey Robinson, who attended Punky Hollow in 1865, said his father remembered an old settler in the area by the name of Punky (memories of Harvey Robinson, Wayland Register 10/11/1939). Some say “Punkey” was the nickname of a man named Richardson; others say there was a resident with the surname Punky in that locality (Source: History of the Township of Springwater, p.13). There was a district school in Springwater called Punkey Hollow, and a Punky Hollow Farm (Christmas tree farm) owned by Gene Mille in 1990, encompassing land around the Punky Hollow School.\n\nReynolds Gully / Big Gully – Located at north-central edge of town on Reynolds Road.
