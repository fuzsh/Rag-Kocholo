        "text": "During the month of October, the Society usually has a few visitors who come in to search their homes’ history. When questioned, some will say it’s because of some of the ‘strange things’ that have occurred in the house. Over the years, this volunteer has saved a collection of these stories about local GHOSTS & HAUNTINGS. (Names, and specific addresses have been omitted to protect the owners. The stories date back twenty plus years, so owners – and experiences - may have changed. ED)\n\nIn the early 2000s, a young couple bought a house on Forest Street. While doing some renovations, the couple found a small child’s chair sitting beside a very small ‘peel-hole’ window in the attic. They gave the chair to a relative and replaced the old window with a new one, to spruce up the loft. Following those changes, the wife complained of hearing someone upstairs, even when the husband was not home. Their search was to find out something about the families that had lived there before…was there a child, was a crime committed in the house…did anyone die there?\n\nOne of Westbrook’s oldest homes on E. Bridge Street has ‘something’ in the house that would wake the owner and her cats up at night. There is also an old Indian cellar behind the fireplace that the cat won’t go near. The owner has been has told that a former realtor would not go near the fireplace “because it made her feel funny.” The homeowner had a Paranormal study done and was told that “there were spirits there but they are not malevolent and will cause no harm.”.\n\nThe owner of a home on Bridge Street, who described herself as a “Christian and a non-believer in ghosts”, lived in her 1856 haunted house for 15 years. She related the following story: She had not lived there long when one day she sensed someone watching her and saw a tall, older man in period clothing, standing in the hallway. He did not speak, nor did she. She felt no fear and knew that he was not real.\n\nAfter that, there were appearances seen by her sister and by a lady who came to her yard sale. This shopper informed the owner that she had a ghost in her doorway, and described him just as the homeowner did. The woman also said that he said his name was Christopher. However, the homeowner and her husband had named him ‘George’ and continued to call him that. ‘George’ liked to play tricks, like throwing items, putting the cat in the closet, having parties late at night with singing and dancing, and calling out to the owner’s husband. The husband had not seen ‘George’, but he had seen objects being moved around the room and heard him calling.\n\nThe owners of one of the ‘mill houses‘ on Cumberland Street stated that both of them often heard a voice calling ‘goodnight, George’. They later discovered that a George Sewall lived in the house at one time. When they purchased the house there had been a small room with a shingled-over window, over their front door. During renovations, they removed the shingles and opened the window. “George” did not like this!! He started walking around the house hollering ‘why did you do that?’\n\nInteresting? Unbelievable? True? It’s up to you to take your pick, but these are some of the interesting stories of Westbrook hauntings, as told by those who experienced them!\n\nWriter Henrik Ibsen (1828 – 1906) is credited with being the one who first said \"A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed.\" This has been plagiarized and para-phrased into what we now know as “A picture is worth a thousand words”. The Internet defines this old adage as meaning that ‘complex and sometimes multiple ideas can be conveyed by a single still image.’ This editor thinks that a picture is worth a thousand questions: …who took the picture?… where/when was it taken?... what is it a picture of? …\n\nThe above photograph, taken from The Historical Society collection, was taken on “the corner of Main and Seavey Street”, obviously during some celebration as depicted by the banners and buntings.\n\nThe building, which is still standing, is easy to recognize, but when was the photograph taken and what is the history of the building? The photograph sparks the questions… and we must do the research.\n\nWestbrook tax records shows that the building was erected in 1855. The name on the front of the building is ‘Ansel H. Porter’ and it’s easy to see that the business sold Moxie! Westbrook City Directories of that era report that Ansel H. Porter’s business at 424 Main Street, supplied groceries and provisions. The building would remain the home of a market for many years. Mr. Porter resided at 95 Main Street.\n\nThe carriages tell us that the photograph was taken in the early to mid-20th Century, before the automobile became the preferred mode of transportation. The bunting decorating the building shows that it was taken during a patriotic holiday, i.e. the Fourth of July, Westbrook’s Centennial (1914), WW I Armistice Day (November 1918), or even Maine’s Centennial (1920).\n\nOn the peak of the building can be seen a sign stating “Council No. 4, Q.U.A.M. “ The Order of American Mechanics was an organization founded in PA in 1844. It began as an anti-Catholic nativist organization which campaigned against the hiring of cheap foreign labor and proposed the patronization of American Businesses. At its beginning, membership was restricted to native born citizens. The organization later abandoned its nativist politics and became the standard insurance society “United American Mechanics”. The Order offered sick, death and funeral benefits along the lines offered by The Oddfellows. It never acted as a trade union or took part in labor disputes. S.D. Warren workers would probably have had a Council of Q.U.A.M. with meetings held in this location.\n\nThe building later housed the Clover Farm grocery store which was sold in 1939 to Albert and Elizabeth Mathieu and became Mathieu’s Red & White Food Market. The Mathieus lived on Forest Street with their two sons and a daughter. The store remained a neighborhood market until the early 2000s. It now contains businesses on the first floor and six apartments on the upper floors.\n\n166 years after its erection, the building remains a Cumberland Mills landmark. And of note: the house seen on the left of the store in both photos, also remains well cared for and a treasurer of the area.\n\nDown through the years from the time Westbrook High School was established, it has been progressing in education and expanding in size. These interesting items have been collected from the minds and memories of past graduates... :\n\nIn 1883, the first public graduation was held by Westbrook High at a Congregational Church. There were three graduates: Lotta May Woodman, Eleanor Murch, and Hattie Hamblin.\n\nAround the turn of the century, the school day began at 8:00 and came to an end at 12:00. Such pranks, as are played today, were played then. Boys rolled \"shot\" down the aisle letting it hit against the wall making a noise which disturbed the class. They chewed on their tongues to attract the attention of the teachers who would ask what they were chewing on. They would then stick out their tongues.\n\nGrace MacPherson, a teacher at Forest Street, recalled from 1900-1902, that manual training was established by Ned Warren at Warren School. This subject was open to boys and girls alike. The first item the girls made was a wedge.\n\nPhysical Education was promoted by Cornelia Warren and one of the earliest instructors was Mr. Ross.\n\nAnother thing to note, for years morning exercises were held for all classes in the Main Room.\n\nIn 1912, the first Washington trip was held, at the cost of $32 per person. The chaperones for this trip were Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, the principal and his wife. The group took a train to Boston, but proceeded on to New York by boat. As they entered New York harbor early in the morning, they saw the Statue of Liberty. In the city they visited the Hippodrome. From New York they traveled to Philadelphia and saw such interesting sights as the U.S. Mint and the Liberty Bell. After leaving Washington, it took them five days to reach home.\n\nBasketball has always been an attraction at Westbrook High and in 1911, they went to the games on a trailer, hitched to the back of a trolley car. When Westbrook won the basketball championship in the years between 1913 and 1917, Hazel Wyer, a teacher in Westbrook, recalled how the students did a snake dance down Congress Street. The games were held at Cumberland Gym and plays, shows, etc., at the Star Theatre.\n\nThe Woman's Relief Corps presented Westbrook High School with an American flag in 1918. In 1919, the Seniors taught some of the subjects to the lower classes because of a shortage of teachers.\n\nHarold Fernald, a student in 1920, remembered the days when the students from Pride's Corner came to school by horse-and-buggy while the students from White Rock came by train. That year the graduation was held outdoors at Warren Park.\n\nThe Blue and White was published with class pictures for the first time in 1921, but these pictures were only snapshots.\n\nMiss Abbott, a history teacher at Westbrook High, came in 1925 when James Lewis was principal. In this year the Charleston became the dance craze and school was closed for the Gorham Fair.\n\nOn May 28th 1914 a clipping in a local newspaper reported that “…a huge bowlder (sic), which will form the center of the entrance to Riverbank, the new park which will be dedicated during the centennial celebration, was placed in position. The bowlder was secured at Rocky Hill and hauled to Riverbank during the day yesterday. Before the centennial the bowler will be properly inscribed as a permanent monument to the centennial.”\n\nThat boulder can be seen in this beautiful old post card of Riverbank Park. The Park was dedicated on June 9, 1914, the last day of celebration of the Centennial of the Incorporation of the Town of Westbrook. One would think that the park site was selected because it was located midway between the east and west ends of the city.* The name of the park was suggested by the Honorable John E. Warren. Mr. Warren had a pathway built from the old swimming pool along the bank of the Presumpscot River to the grounds of Riverbank Park. In order that no building enterprise could destroy the plans he had made, he bought, and held for many years, the land which eventually became the park, paying the taxes and finally selling it to the city for the original purchase price.\n\nIn the 1915 first annual report of the Trustees of Riverbank Park, then under the management of the Cemetery trustees, they commented that the park was the “one spot in our city dedicated for the benefit and recreation of all our citizens.”\n\nA Monument Association was formed as a result of the 100th year anniversary. Their purpose was to raise funds and plan a design for a monument to honor all of Westbrook’s veterans, at that time, the veterans of the Civil War. On July 4, 1917, Mayor O.G. K. Robinson accepted the 8-foot bronze soldier in Civil War uniform, atop its 9½ -foot base of Barre granite. Mr. & Mrs. Woodbury Dana donated the statue and it was designed by sculpturess Alice Ruggles Kitson of Quincy, MA. The town paid $500 for the base, partly paid by school children who purchased shares in the Monument Association at 10 cents a share.\n\nJudging from this information, the post card must have shown Riverbank around 1915-1916, after the boulder was placed and before the monument was dedicated. The Park has been changed over the years: new monuments to veterans and events , houses torn down, trees planted, but with such a history, it is no surprise that Riverbank Park is still a very vital spot and is probably the most used park in the City.\n\n*One older Westbrook citizen remembers her father relating that the area where the park is now, then empty land, was the dividing line between Cumberland Mills and Saccarappa Village; a line that boys of the two villages hesitated to cross.\n\nA town or city is built on its citizens. So, during Westbrook’s bicentennial year as a town, it may be advantageous to take a brief look at a few of our early citizens.\n\nW. K. Dana is one person who comes to mind when thinking of early Westbrook. “When one’s eyes fall upon the words Dana Warp Mills, the name Woodbury K. Dana instantly is spoken for he is the Dana Warp Mills”, so commented Judge Fabius M. Ray in an early article about Dana Mills.\n\nBorn on June 7, 1840 to prominent Portland citizens, Woodbury Kidder Dana attended private and public schools in Portland, then graduated from the Lewiston Falls Academy (later named Edward Little High School). At this point he knew he wanted to enter into business, preferably one of his own. After an early business adventure failed due to his lack of experience, he worked in Lewiston and Gray mills, gaining experience in the manufacturing of cod lines and bags and bunch yarn, 2 products which would later become staples of his Westbrook mill. He gave little regard to the stigma of the son of a prominent businessman becoming a laborer in the cotton trade. He obviously felt he had to start at the ground level in order to learn his business.\n\nMr. Dana was a religious man who read the Bible through at least once a year. It was written in a family biography that he spent several evenings a week going into homes of fellow employees and teaching them to read, write, and do arithmetic. He purchased books and supplies and taught them elementary studies. This characteristic of caring would be reflected in the treatment of his employees throughout his business career.\n\nIn September 1863 he enlisted in the 29th Me. during the Civil War. He served in Texas, Louisiana and Virginia. He was discharged in 1865 and was named department commander of the Maine G.A.R. in June 1865.\n\nAfter the war Mr. Dana was ready to begin his life work as an independent manufacturer. In 1866, with Thomas McEwan, he formed the Dana & McEwan Company at Saccarappa Falls; its purpose was the manufacturing of cotton warps. After a few years, Mr. Dana bought Mr. McEwan’s interest in the company and shortened its name to Dana Mills. Within seven years, the mill had grown so large that it had to move into larger building on Main Street, then six years later it moved to the Island at the Falls.\n\nThe character of the man who made the goods was stamped on the goods themselves. They were made with honor and of a high standard; for years they sold themselves. The quality of his product was due to the used of the best-known appliances, skilled labor, and intelligent supervision. He valued his employees in an era when this was not always the case. He encouraged his employees to experiment in the Company’s machine shop and generously recognized the results of their efforts and their skills.\n\nHe served as an alderman in his adopted city, was President of Mallison Power Company, and a trustee of the Walker Memorial Library.\n\nWhen interview in 1976, Miss Marion Dana, a niece, stated that “Mr. Dana was very much loved, and at…[the 50th anniversary of the founding of the mill]… in 1916, everyone turned out. Thousands of people came, and they celebrated by a parade….” She relates that the mill employees gave him a diamond stick pin as a token of their affection.\n\nWith its closure in 1958, The Dana Mill ended its 91 year history (1887 – 1958) in Westbrook.\n\nIn this year of 2014, we will celebrate the Bicentennial of the Incorporation of the Town of Westbrook. In 1914 the celebration of the Centennial encompassed one week of festivities, and old photographs show the bunting decorated store fronts on the Westbrook businesses. With the celebrating to come in June 2014, it is good to look back and try to imagine what life was like when Westbrook was in its infancy.\n\nThe years leading up to Westbrook’s Incorporation were filled with hardship, brought on by both National upheaval and primitive conditions. The War of 1812 resulted in the United States being infested with British cruisers, from Eastport to Mississippi, and causing a state of blockade. Provisions were so scarce that imported articles, even flour and bread, commanded extravagant prices. Without local harvests or imported foodstuffs, Westbrook must have suffered heavily. Black markets flourished. Supplies were so dear that pork went for $50 a barrel. Coffee, molasses, brandy and tea prices skyrocketed in 1813, often doubling from the pre-war cost. Prices did not return to normal until 1815.\n\nThe winter of 1815, the first for the Town of Westbrook, recorded heavy frosts throughout the area. Frost was reported upon the window panes in July and most all crops were ruined. At that time the people were so dependent upon the local soil for sustenance that they were obliged to resort to game meat and fish; other foods could only be purchased as a luxury.\n\nOn the brighter side, paradoxically, while the blockade injured seacoast areas, it helped manufacturing grow inland. Thirty new companies were incorporated in Maine in 1814. Westbrook could easily have enjoyed this manufacturing boom — thirty-one local business concerns were assessed that year.\n\nAdding to the hardships of this war was the fact that Maine's heart wasn't in it. In 1814 the \"United States\" were not, in fact, united in spirit. Massachusetts was thinking of seceding; and we must remember that at the time of Westbrook’s Incorporation it was a town in the District of Maine, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On June 9, 1814, the very day of Westbrook's incorporation, proof of the sentiments of Massachusetts, appeared in an article in a major local newspaper, the Portland Argus:\n\n“Advices have been received .... of a proclamation issued by the\n\ngovernment of Massachusetts……\n\n“By this proclamation it is asserted that Massachusetts withdraws\n\nherself from all participation of the war, and declares her amity towards\n\nEngland. It is also said that English prisoners in that state have been liberated\n\nand means been taken to effect a perfect conciliation with this country (England).\"\n\nIf in 1814 the Nation was primitive politically, it was equally primitive domestically. \"Chains, shackles and ring bolts\" were standard equipment at the County House (jail). At home, \"homespun clothing was generally worn by all classes. The girls were taught the art of spinning and weaving, and if they were adept in this art, coupled with that of cooking, it was considered their highest accomplishment to meet the duties of wife and mother.\"\n\n1814 is a significant year in Westbrook history; but it is also a year that will long be remembered in our nation's history. For it was after a night-long battle, when the haze and smoke of the cannons had finally cleared, that ...our flag was revealed intact at the battle of Fort McHenry outside of Baltimore, Maryland. On that September morning, in 1814, Francis Scott Key, a prisoner aboard ship in the harbor, dashed off most of the verses of our immortal Star-Spangled Banner!\n\nAs these words shows, we have come a long way since Westbrook became a town.\n\nThe Catholic Action Crusaders Club of St. Hyacinthe Church was comprised of male youth, 16 years old and up, from the Westbrook parish. The Crusaders were formed on April 12, 1937 when a young curate, Father Adrien Casavant, encouraged twelve baseball players to form a catholic action movement. Within four months the original membership of twelve rose to the astounding number of one hundred and thirty-six. The parishioners rallied behind their young men and patronized every enterprise of the new Crusaders. These endeavors included baseball, basketball and hockey teams, as well as light dramatic presentations and minstrel shows. The Crusaders baseball team won the 1938 Westbrook Twilight League championship.\n\nUpon joining, the young parishioners learned the purpose and expectations of the organization:\n\n\"This club is an organization of catholic young men grouped together in order\n\nto promote good clean social, athletic, intellectual, and religious activities.\n\n\"Of a Crusader, we expect one thing: to be a gentleman. We expect him to live\n\na good clean decent lifeand to do nothing that will bring shame and dishonor\n\nupon himself, his family, his religion or his club.\n\n“We expect him to be a man of honor and a good sport. We want him to be\n\nfriendly with all his fellow members and to be courageous and gentlemanly…\n\n“If you follow these simple rules of a Crusader, you'll be an honor to yourself, your country and your religion…..”\n\nWithin a few years of its formation, the church members decided that the boys needed a place of their own where they could meet and group together. The club president, Raymond Morin, and his aides found a suitable location and building, the old offices of the Haskell Silk Mill. Father Casavant and Armand LeBlanc took upon themselves the task of secur­ing the purchase money and a Corporation to oversee the adventure was formed from leading men of the parish.\n\nThus, by early 1940 the Catholic Action Crusaders were proud possessors of one of the best club­houses in the state. In a news article at that time, the building was described as such:\n\n“On the first floor of the 42 by 35 foot, two story structure, will be a large social room with a fireplace, a library with another fireplace, a trophy room, directors' office, a large reception hall and a pool and game room. The entire second floor will be given over to a gymnasium with a boxing ring and apparatus. The building will be completely air con­ditioned and indirect lighting will be installed. It will be finished in a modernistic style.”\n\nYoungsters, by the dozens, flocked to the membership committee seeking admission, a comfort­ing fact for those who had labored hard to make their organization enviable to all catholic youth.\n\nBy the fifties membership in the club was waning and the building was sold to the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1951. In 1958 a fire in the building greatly altered its outside appearance.\n\nThe first electric street cars appeared in Portland in 1891 on the Deering line, and ran from Monument Square to Morrill’s Corner. Horse cars had been operating in this area, which was part of Westbrook until 1871, since 1864.\n\nOn December 22, 1891 the Westbrook City Council discussed a proposed electric line extension into Westbrook. The line would operate through Spring (now Woodford’s) Street from Forest Avenue, then along Brighton Avenue, on through Cumberland Mills and Main Street, to the foot of Saco Street. The Westbrook line would the first section to be built purposely for electric operation on the Portland system.\n\nIn January 1892 the Westbrook Council accepted the Portland Railroad Company’s offer of a 25 year franchise. Certain rules and regulations were discussed and accepted: a 5 cent fare would be charged between Cumberland Mills and Saco Street; cars would be limited to eight miles per hour in the city and no more than fifteen miles per hour outside the compact area; the rails would be installed in the center of the street instead of on the side. There were some concerns about the line coming too close to a Cumberland Mills church but the Council approved the location.\n\nTwo new electric cars being built at the new Bracket Street car barn would be finished in time for the opening of the June extension. The cars were described as being 32 feet long, furnished with an oak and South American red wood interior and the exterior was to be painted olive brown or wheat (then better known as Pullman car color) and decorated in gold and vermillion. The top panel was to read: SPRING, BRIGHTON & MAIN STEETS. In the middle of the car WESTBROOK was to be painted in large letters with the lower panel reading NASONS CORNER & CUMBERLAND MILLS.\n\nThe early cars were equipped with two twenty-five horse power motors, hand brakes, no fenders or vestibule. A brakeman was employed to help stop the train when passengers wished to get off, to announce the streets and to ring the signal bell to the motorman. The conductor of the train collected all fares and checked all railroad crossings\n\nJune 29, 1892 was the Official opening of the Westbrook Trolley Line. Two electric cars carrying the Directors of the company and guests arrived at the Westbrook city square. The American Cadet Band and a large crowd was in the square as the cars glided to a stop amid the music and the waving of handkerchiefs. As soon as the cars were emptied of the dignitaries, the band and the citizens boarded and were given a ride to the east end and return. It was a joyous occasion.\n\nFrom then on cars left the head of Preble Street for Westbrook every half hour starting at 7:10 Am. By July it was reported that more than 1,000 people per day used the line. In 1898 the Westbrook City Council approved an extension of the Westbrook line which would allow it to continue on into Windham and Naples.\n\nBy the early 1900s electric street railroads operated in most large cities in New England. By changing cars several times it was at one time possible to ride on electric cars from Westbrook to Boston. Electric street cars were a convenient means of transportation and a lucrative investment for its owners. They also stimulated the building of suburban homes and businesses outside the now-expensive city limits.\n\nBut time and progress march steadily on and by 1939 some of the trolley cars were replaced by gas driven buses. The Westbrook trolley line continued until April 20, 1941 when it was reported on the front page of a Portland newspaper:\n\n“ Crowd Jams Last Trolley to Westbrook\n\nBuses Take Over Service Today\n\nThe rumbling wheels of the trolley No. 175, described by company employes (sic)\n\nas a Saco car, wrote the last chapter in an era of Paper City trolley transportation\n\nthat covered a 45-year period”.\n\nTo read more about the Westbrook street cars, visit the Society and ask to see Charles Heseltine’s collection on Westbrook Trolleys .\n\nThe Haskell Silk Company, manufacturers of silk dress goods, was one of the foremost silk manufacturers in New England. Their product was supplied through retail houses in almost every state of the union and carried the name Westbrook throughout the country. The company was established in 1874 and was the only company of this type in Maine and was one of the oldest in New England. James Haskell resigned his position as Agent for the Westbrook Manufacturing Company to establish this business. James Haskell was the President of the company, his son Frank Haskell was the treasurer and his other son, Edwin Haskell, was the General Manager. Frank Haskell, was appointed to succeed his father as agent of the Westbrook Manufacturing Company. He served both companies until 1889 when he was forced to resign as Treasurer of Haskell Silk Company to devote full time to the Westbrook Manufacturing Company. He did however continue as a director and part owner of tie Haskell Silk Company until his death in 1896.\n\nThe first Haskell Silk Mill stood on the west side of Bridge Street, next to the bridge that crosses over the Presumpscot River [at the rear of the present day Portland Pie Company and on the land where the Bridge Street traffic spur is located.]\n\nThe Haskell Silk Company started off manufacturing spool silk and twist and six operatives were employed. The business grew at a rapid pace and in 1881 the company began the manufacture of dress goods. Black was the predominant color at first. The silks were woven from pure silk, dyed in the yam. In the next few years many beautiful colored silk and satin patterns were woven.\n\nAll of the silk used in the manufacturing was imported from Japan in the form of skeins and the following process of making silk material was used. The skeins were rewound, followed by a procedure known as \"doubling\", and were then ready for the spinners. Next, the silk was reeled, dyed and wound again making it ready to be warped and quilted and woven into yard goods. The inspection or \"picking\" followed and the material was finally ready for finishing. The \"picking\" of the silk was for many years done by women in their own homes, creating a flourishing home industry in the town. The Haskell taffetas, with black warps and colored filling, were manufactured in large quantities and were widely sold throughout the United States.\n\nDue to the large demand for these Glace' Taffetas, it was necessary to expand still further and a new mill was built further up the river on Bridge Street. This new mill contained thirty-thousand square feet of floor space and employed from two hundred fifty to two hundred seventy-five employees. The dye department boiler house and repair shop were housed in a separate building. The Mattison Power Company, located at Mattison Falls in South Windham, supplied electric power for this mill. This power station was built at the same time as the mill by the owners of the Haskell Silk Company and Dana Warp Mills. The president of the company, James Haskell, retired during this period due to ill health. William Poole became the new president of the company and Lemuel Lane became the Treasurer of the company both of these men were family connected.\n\nThe old railroad bridge which spans the Presumpscot River from Brown Street (across from Cottage Place) to just below Fraser Field, bridges more than the river that once brought life to the Indians’ corn and fish to the high fishing place called Ammoncongin. The “Black Bridge”, as it has been called by many generations of Westbrook residents, also bridges time. Just its name evokes many a memory in the hearts of Westbrook citizens. A 1988 news article found at the historical society states:\n\n“Many a boy, contrary to the instructions of his parents, has hurled himself from the bridge to\n\nplummet into the cooling waters on a hot summer day. Thousands of cigarettes have been sneaked,\n\nand thousands of kisses have been stolen, in the shadows of the black bridge… Upon the granite blocks that hold its steel girders are layers upon layers of paint, and upon its girders are splotches of paint as if some artist had gone mad. Yellows, blues, greens, whites, pledging love, immortalizing rock stars, cussing teachers and policemen, and publishing the politics of the day. They are all there. The hippies of the sixties, the Beatles, Nixon, Kennedy, AC-DC and Van Halen, Power to the People, and Hell No We Won't Go. Yes, the black bridge has seen it all, and recorded most of it.”\n\n[ED note: A walk across the bridge in 2012 found that the graffiti has been mostly painted over…but the bridge still remains a busy thoroughfare.]\n\nThis black hulk of steel, (now red with age and rust), grows out of the skeleton of its wooden predecessor and remains today much as it did when our fathers and grandfathers yelled out in glee and leaped skyward, to fall into the waters below. It seems much the same as when a boy carved the name of the girl who would become his life's partner into the railing of the footbridge. Yet, the bridge does change.\n\nThe first bridge at this site was built in 1870 as part of the first 17-mile stage of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad (completed to Vermont in 1875). For the first years the only people who saw the bridge were crews and passengers on the railroad, boaters on the Presumpscot, and those few who troubled to walk through the woods or fields that stretched unbroken along both sides of the river in that area. That first bridge, built of wood, went out in 1896, victim of a raging ice-clogged river. It was replaced with a steel bridge standing on the stone piers of its predecessor.\n\nBy that time, settlement on the northwest side of the river had reached the point where there was a demand for more direct access to the commercial and cultural advantages on the Main Street side. The result was a wooden foot­bridge hung beneath the steel. Over the years this became many a youngster’s favorite route to Main Street, the ball field and swimming pool and to school. In 1989 a galvanized steel grating replaced the traditional wooden walkway of the bridge. Pipe rails were installed along inner sides of the walkway at 18 and 42 inches. The cribbing that supports the Brown Street end was replaced with three hangers that clamp and are welded to the I beam girder. In 1992 the City Council voted for two street lights to be installed at the ends of the bridge which had become an unsupervised center were teenagers and young adults hung out; underbrush was also cut back due to fires in the area. One year later, the Council decided to consider other ways to light the area since CMP costs for the proposed lighting would have been $5,000.\n\nToday there are no trains traveling over the bridge. The through trains on the Mountain Division of the Maine Central Railroad, which carried people across the bridge by the hundreds and thousands to Sebago Lake picnics and parties, to vacations in the White Mountains, and on to destinations in Vermont and Canada, are only memories.\n\nBut the footbridge remains a vital piece of our history. Maintained by the city of Westbrook, the walkway remains a thoroughfare for those who aren't old enough to drive a car or don’t own a car and to some who use it to reach the pathways that stretch along the riverbank. A well maintained walkway is on the Main Street side and goes from the Sappi Fine Paper Co. all the way to Saccarappa Falls and Vallee Square.\n\nWhen my husband and I visited the bridge in November 2012, on a beautiful sunny fall day, people were walking on the bridge, both on the walkway and overhead on the rails, and families were walking the Main Street side foot path. It was a busy day for foot traffic. Yes, the people still come, probably now for exercise or as a shortcut, since there are cleaner places to swim. But the view along the river remains a beautiful thing to see. We did not see any lighting on the ends of the bridge nor did we see much graffiti. It appears that the huge blocks of granite supporting the bridge have been painted gray but there are still a few places where you can spot a person’s name spray painted on the blocks or on the bridge itself. Two things of interest that we discovered on our walk, (1) there are two sets of tracks, one for narrow-gauge and one for wide-gauge trains and (2) there is a U.S. Geological Survey Marker on the bridge stating that the elevation is 69 feet above sea level.\n\nIn this era of growth, when we are losing more and more of our landmarks, historic buildings and farmlands, this great Westbrook landmark continues to serve Westbrook’s citizens.\n\nHere comes the milkman! Do you ever wonder what those words mean to today’s young people? To a lot of us it means the delivery of milk right to our front door stoops…fresh and oh, so cold in the winter months. Remember how the milk would freeze in winter and the cap would pop off the bottle? And how the cream separated from the milk and Mom would use it to make fudge…or chowdah? And how you knew the milkman’s name since he walked to your door, milk bottles clinking, to pick up the empty bottles and leave the new order? This snapshot of “Mr. Landry, the milk man” was taken in 1943 when milk was still delivered in a horse-drawn wagon and came from local Westbrook farmers. Who is it that complains about the ‘good-old-days’?\n\nThe 1891 Westbrook City Directory lists sixteen people under the heading ‘MILK’: Isaac G. Babb (off Spring St.), Smith Babb (Stroudwater), George M. Cobb (listed as Methodist Rd, Rocky Hill District),James H. Gowen (Duck Pond Rd), Deering Colley (Brook Rd, Prides Corner), George E. Herman (Cottage Place, Cumberland Mills),George R. Johnson, (Buxton Rd), Alonzo Libby (Main St.), James Morris (Methodist Rd), S.F. Pride (Bridgton Rd), Albion Quinby (Saco St), John Roberts (Saco St.), Cornelius Small (Methodist Rd), John Tilton (Stroudwater), Woodbury Bros. (Bridge St. Duck Pond district), and Frank Woodman (E. Bridge St.).\n\nOver the years there have been many small dairies in Westbrook which delivered milk in their own labeled bottles: Westbrook Dairy (run by Mace Willis Messenger)*, Elm Maple Farm (Roscoe and Richard F. Libby), Blue Spruce Farm (William L. Clarke), Grondin Dairy (R.J. Grondin), Westbrook Croft Dairy (G.A. Smith), Maplehurst (F.D. Bachelder, R.B.Taggart), Riverton Dairy, Valley View Farm (I. M. Boothby), Walnut Crest Farm (Clinton Rines), Twin Falls (R.J. Grondin), Ledgemere Farm (J.A. Kimball and Sons), Green Acres (Clifford and Gorman Thompson), Old Acres (M. H. Waterhouse) and Pine Grove Farm (J. S. Gordon). Today, I believe there is only one dairy farm in Westbrook, Smiling Hill Farm; and their milk, still in glass bottles, is delivered to the supermarket.\n\nAs years went on and the cause and spread of diseases became better known, larger dairies like Hood and Oakhurst were better equipped to sterilize and process the milk. Since the milk was consolidated, the delivery areas expanded and for many years the milk was delivered door-to-door from small trucks. When the automobile became more prevalent and everyone could get to the market, that practice was stopped. No one will deny that the milk is much safer now but some of us do not want to forget the Milkman and this piece of our history.\n\n*ADDENDUM: Linda Messenger Stewart of Delaware sent a correction for this article in regards to the name of the owner of Westbrook Dairy, Mace Willis Messanger, her father, She also supplied further information on that dairy: \"I am the first born daughter of Mace Messenger named in your reference to Westbrook Dairy. Please be advised that Daddy's name is Mace Willis Messenger ... there was no such person as William Messenger. Westbrook Dairy was established by my grandfather, Carl Harvey Messenger. My Daddy took over when his father passed away in the early 1950's (I believe 1951 or 1952)\" .\n\n3/11/15 Stephen Landry of Buxtonn adds the following information to this photo: \"Mr. Landry the Milkman\" is Alfonse Landry and the horse's name was 'Dick'. Dick primarily did the milk runs but was occasionally used on the farm for light duty task such as raking hay.\"\n\nWe welcome any comments or corrections to our Photo pages.\n\nWhen I first moved to Westbrook in 1951 it seemed as though there was a church on every corner. When I came upon this (collage) postcard at the historical society it seemed to support my earlier thoughts. Recently I checked the City Directory for 1953 and discovered that there were 15 churches in Westbrook at that time, 10 on Main Street!!! They were: Advent Christian at 677 Main St., Bethany Hall at 540 Main, First Baptist at 733 Main, Full Gospel Assembly at corner of Seavey & Oak, Highland Lake Union on Bridgeton Rd, Plymouth Brethren at 540 Main, Pride’s Corner Union on Elmwood Ave., St. Hyacinthe at 295 Brown St., St Mary’s at 631 Main, Salvation Army at 10 Fitch St., Trinity Lutheran at Main & School St., Universalist at 719 Main, Warren Congregational at Warren Ave. & Cumberland St., Westbrook Congregational at 852 Main and Westbrook Methodist at 755 Main. The churches pictured on this card in 1909 were a few of our older churches.\n\nADVENT –The Advent Christian Parish, under the leadership of the Reverend William Mitchell of Kennebunk raised funds to purchase a lot of land and build a church in Westbrook. Services were held in the Red Men’s Hall until 1886 when the church building was dedicated. The Church tower, stained glass windows and a new organ was installed in 1910-12. The building still stands next to Riverbank Park and is being used for religious purposes but not connected to the Adventist faith.\n\nDANISH LUTHERAN/ FIRST LUTHERAN - The first Danish family arrived in Westbrook around 1873. They brought with them the old family Bible, Luther's Postil, and their hymn books. Feeling the need of spiritual guidance, they called together other local Lutheran families for religious services. By 1876 Lutheran services were held in Westbrook homes nearly every Sunday afternoon. With increasing attendance there was a need for a church building so on November 2, 1882 the First Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of Westbrook, Maine, was organized. By 1891 the land for the site of the present church building, on the corner of Main and School Streets, was purchased from John E. Warren. On New Year's day 1893, the church was dedicated. All services were conducted in the Danish language until 1905 when one English service a month was held. The church has been enlarged and remodeled but it still stands and maintains an active congregation.\n\nCATHOLIC - In 1854 many catholic families arrived in Westbrook to work in the mills, on the railroad and clearing the river way. Originally Catholic settlers had to walk to Portland to attend Mass. Later it is claimed that they met in a brick house on Cumberland Mills before renting a chapel in Brigham Hall in downtown Saccarappa. As the number of families increased and after outgrowing their chapel, land was purchased on Brown St. in 1877 for a church building. St. Hyacinthe Parish, seen on this card, was dedicated in 1879. In 1941, due to an increasing congregation, a long-planned large stone church was erected to replace this old wooden structure. The last service was held in the old church in 1942 and services started in the new church across the street. Work continued on the new church until January 15, 1950 when a solemn High Mass and dedication took place in the completed church. The 3 Catholic parishes of Westbrook, St. Hyacinth on Brown St., St. Mary’s (1916) on Main St. and St. Edmunds on Bridgeton Rd (in Pride’s Corner) merged in 2010. Due to the overwhelming choice of the parishioners, the Catholic services still continue at the older stone church building on Brown St., now call St. Anthony’s Parish at St. Hyacinth.\n\nWESTBROOK CONGREGATIONAL - There was a First Congregational meeting house at Capisic Street, now in Portland, as early as 1767. This church was where Rev. Bradley served for 30 yrs. It was quite a walk from Saccarappa to Capisic so in 1832 twenty-three members of Parson Bradley’s Church asked dismission to form the Second Congregational Church of Westbrook, later called the Westbrook Congregational Church. The Rev Joseph Searle was called as pastor and for two years meetings were held in Small’s Hall on the second floor of the Edward’s Block on the corner of Main and Bridge Streets. In 1834 land was purchased on the corner of Main & Brackett Streets and a church building, modeled after the meeting house on Capisic, was built for $2300. The building underwent many renovations, additions and improvements over the years but it always kept its clean, simple beauty. When the Westbrook Urban Renewal was in full swing in 1974, the church building was demolished and the congregation merged with the Warren Congregational Church to form the Westbrook-Warren Congregational Church, United Church of Christ. A new church building was then built on land further up on Main Street, next to the Walker Memorial Library.\n\nWARREN CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH - In 1865, under the Rev. Joseph Danielson, the First Congregational Church started prayer services in the Village of Cumberland Mills. The meetings were held at different homes until the size of the group outgrew this arrangement. In 1866 the women of the village joined together into the Cumberland Mills Ladies’ Sewing Society with the object of raising funds toward furnishing the first Protestant church to be erected in the Village. Samuel D. Warren, owner of the local mills, offered to purchase a lot for the building and to contribute $5000 toward its erection. Any cost over that amount he would match dollar for dollar from pledges. The Cumberland Mills Ladies Sewing Society became affiliated with the church and helped raise funds. The Warren Parish was legally organized and incorporated in July 1868 and the church building on the corner of Warren Ave. and Cumberland St. was completed in 1869. The first minister was Rev. Elijah Kellogg of Harpswell. The congregation remained active until 1974 when structural problems, so severe as to be impossible to repair, were discovered in the church. With the news that the Westbrook Congregational Church would be razed and moved by urban renewal, the two congregations merged to form the Westbrook-Warren Congregational Church, United Church of Christ. This congregation is still an active participant in our city.\n\nUNIVERSALIST - Early in the nineteenth century about forty members of Parson Bradley’s Stroudwater Congregational Church “withdrew” because of their Universalist tendencies and formed a free meetinghouse on Saco St. A church building was constructed on Upper Main Street in 1832 but it did not seem satisfactory to its members. Many years of inactivity followed its construction, with only occasional services, until 1887 when a new church ‘more centrally located to accommodate those living in Cumberland Mills’, was envisioned. Construction on this church, seen on the postcard, was started in 1887 and in 1888 a 3-day celebration of dedication was held. In 1904 the Rev. Harry E. Townsend was called to the pastorate and stayed for over 40 years, a much beloved minister of the church and an active member of the community. The Westbrook Methodist Church continued to be active until 2010 when a dwindling and aging congregation prompted it to close its doors and offer the building for sale; the building remains empty two years later.\n\nFIRST BAPTIST – “The Lord surely works in mysterious ways”, reports the Brief History of the Westbrook Baptist Church, ”and when, in 1885, there was still no Baptist Church in Saccarappa, He sent to Scotland for the one who would start the work to place one here. To accomplish this he made use of the needs of the Westbrook Manufacturing Company Gingham Mills for trained personnel from Scotland to instruct their people here in the textile process. Among those who came over at this time from Scotland was Mrs. Roger Hilton, a woman who loved the Lord and immediately set out to work for Him here. Seeing the need in Westbrook, she started a Sunday School Class of small children in her kitchen on Scotch Hill.” Soon more than just the Scottish people were attending the classes. The class size grew rapidly and it became necessary to transfer to larger quarters; during the next few the years the Scotchmen’s Football club house, the Grand Army and the Odd Fellows Halls were all used for the Sunday School. Many at the school members also attended the Free Baptist Church in Portland. As the group enlarged the locals wished to establish a church in Westbrook. The present church, designed by architect John Calvin Stevens, was dedicated on Oct 28, 1888 and was fee of debt at its completion. The church history relates that the local Press reported on November 2, 1888: “The Church starts out in its good work with twenty-eight members and a bright outlook for future growth.” And how true that statement was; the church building has undergone renovations and improvements over the years but its congregation remains an active force in the City.\n\nMETHODIST – According to tradition, Methodism made its first appearance in Saccarappa (later called Westbrook) when Robert Fellowbee, a circuit rider came and preached in Mr. Conant’s house on Park Hill in 1799. The First Methodist Class was formed in 1814. After the first town meeting house (later called “the Old Iron Works” ) was built on Saco Street in 1817, Methodist meetings were held there every other Sunday. (Congregationalists met on the alternating Sundays.) When conflicts arose among the users of the meeting house, the Methodist members withdrew to a variety of locations. First they built a vestry on Main Street but by 1841 they had outgrown it and built a larger church on the present Church Street (which thus acquired its name). This church was destroyed by fire in 1864. For the following two years the Methodists met in the Universalists church and then in Warren Hall. In 1866 the congregation took steps to erect a new building on the corner of Main and Foster Streets, the structure pictured on this post card. The church was dedicated October 17,1867. Methodists flourished in Westbrook, holding the first Methodist conference here in 1871 and boasting the largest Bible Class in the state up to that time in 1916. However, by the 21st Century the church’s enrollment was aging and diminishing so the structure was sold and in 2003 it became a Teen Center\n\nSources: Highlights of Westbrook History and local church histories; all may be found in the Society’s research collection.\n\nIn 1905 Cornelia Warren funded a ‘swimming pool’ to be built in the river since this was the only swimming area available to the children at the turn of the century. The pool was placed on the banks of the Presumpscot River, nestled between the Elms and S.D. Warren Paper Company. From early morning until dusk, boys and girls would swim, wade and splash at the ‘river bath’.\n\nThe pool was constructed by placing cement block bases in the river and building a ‘pool house’ upon the blocks. The area was surrounded with a boom, and slats placed around the blocks were meant to keep out most of the flotsam. The river flowed through the slates connecting the pieces of foundation, making the center a “fresh” water tank which formed a swimming area.\n\nIn one old newspaper article the pool house is described as follows: “lockers ringed two sides of the pool. There were steps into the pool, and a wooden floor slanted downwards from one end; each year the river was drawn down and workmen from S.D. Warren Co. repaired or replaced the dryer felt (heavy canvas) that covered the floor. A rope in the middle warned swimmers of deep water beyond. On the opposite end were two diving boards, one on a platform.” The center of the house was left open to the sky.\n\nThis early photograph shows what looks like a full roof but everyone remembers the center roof-area being left open to the sky, and most other photos support this. The cement foundations are all that is left of the river bath and they can be seen along the east banks of the river. This was a very popular summer spot for Westbrook children but there was no way to purify the water flowing through the pool. Remember, at that time there were many active mills along the river and above the swimming pool. Despite being subject to pollution, it was long agreed by the Cornelia Warren Community Association* that the facility was still safer for children since they were under the eye of a life guard, than to risk a fatal accident in the river due to unsupervised swimming. However concerns for the children’s health and safety became a major concern when the polio outbreaks in the 1940s were thought to be spread via swimming.\n\nIn 1947, the Association seriously considered the idea of building a new swimming pool. Once they were able to secure financial backing with funds provided by the Association, the S.D. Warren Paper Mill, the Warren Memorial Foundation, Dana Warp Mills, and funds collected through a city wide fund drive, the excavation for a the new facility was started in October of 1947.\n\nThe new pool, which would utilize Sebago Lake water, would replace the old tank operated by the Association. A wading pool was also made available on the playground before the season opened the following June. The swimming pool was eighty feet wide and 150 feet long and allowed 300 people to swim at one session. It was completed in 1949 and the ‘river bath' became history.\n\nDid you ever swim there? If so, drop us a note to tell us of your experiences.\n\n* Cornelia Warren Community Foundation was incorporated in 1925 from a trust left by Miss Warren who died in 1921. (She was the daughter of Samuel D. & Susan Warren.) Its purpose is to maintain the many gifts that Miss Warren gave to the City of Westbrook.\n\n(Information taken from A Presence in the Community: The Warren Family Legacy. 2000)\n\nVisit the Society to see interior photographs of the pool house and photos of kids jumping from the 2nd story into the river.\n\nThe early conditions of Westbrook were not conducive to secret societies, neither were they plenty or flourishing at that time anywhere in Maine or…in the world…\n\nWe find no record or tradition of any secret society in Westbrook previous to 1840. About that time a Lodge of Rechabites was organized…but it was short lived….\n\nAbout 1844, Odd Fellowship having obtained a footing in the State, a Lodge of that order was founded in Westbrook and received many members, the number of members reaching two hundred within five years. The name chosen for the Lodge was Saccarappa and the number was eleven. After a few years of prosperity and rapid growth the interest in the Fraternity began to decline and practically ceased to exist, although the charter was never surrendered, it being held by a faithful few during these years of adversity, they keeping the Grand Lodge dues paid. After these few years of quietude the Lodge was re-organized, the charter brought from its concealment and another era of prosperity began which has continued with slight interruption to the present time. About 1880 some fifty of the members withdrew and formed Ammencongin (sic) Lodge at Cumberland Mills. While a little feeling probably arose at this time on account of their action it soon passed away and the Lodges work harmoniously… Cummings Encampment and Naomi Lodge of Rebekahs meet with Saccarappa Lodge, the members of which are made up about equally from both places.\n\nAbout 1850 a Lodge of Temperance Watchman was organized and flourished for several years. The temperance movement became so strong after a few years that prohibition was made the law of the State and the society of Temperance Watchman ceased to exist. About 1860 societies of Good Templars began to be formed and several have existed in different places in the town, Duck Pond now Highland Lake, Prides Corner, Saccarappa and Cumberland Mills… Free Masonry was introduced into Westbrook in 1856. Temple Lodge No. 86 being organized and chartered that year… In 1883 fifty odd of its members dimitted and organized Warren Phillips Lodge No. 186. The brethen (sic) left peaceably and quietly and the old Lodge presented the new a set of silver Jewells for their officers as an earnest of their good feeling. ....Eagle Chapter of Royal Arch Masons was organized in Gorham about 1857 and was moved to Westbrook a few years later. They hold their meetings in the hall with Temple Lodge and their membership is practically equal with the Lodge, reaching 216 at last report. Westbrook Council No. 15 Royal and Select Masters also meets in the same hall. It was organized and chartered in 1891… Masonry was long considered to be expressly ordained for men and no woman need apply but degrees connected with the order having been formulated, woman knocked at the door of the Lodge-room, where they confer degrees both upon themselves and the brethren… Mishap Chapter No. 3 was organized in 1891 at Westbrook and Beulah No. 5 a year later at Cumberland Mills.\n\nAbout 1870 the organization known as Knights of Pythias was launched in the community and Presumpscot Valley Lodge No. 3 was chartered at Saccarappa and grew apace… and later Westbrook Lodge was started in Saccarappa…Connected with the Pythians is the Pythian Sisterhood called Calanthe Assembly and is wholly made up of the ladies…\n\nAbout 1875 when Granges were being organized the citizens in the north part of the town started one to be known as Westbrook Grange…the number is augmented by those coming from the neighboring towns of Windham and Falmouth… They own their commodious hall.\n\nThe veterans of the Civil War were not early in uniting and forming a Post but about 1880 Cloudman Post, named after Andrew C. Cloudman who early gave his life for his Country, was organized… While the members are growing old they made a commendable appearance Memorial day and hold meetings twice a month. Connected with the institution is a Ladies' Relief Corps made up of the veteran's wives and daughters. The Sons of Veterans and the Ladies' Aid, composed of their wives and sisters, are also nourishing organizations. The camp was named after William Wade, a young man formerly residing here…\n\nAbout 1880 the order of the Golden Cross having risen to promience in the country a Commandery was established at Saccarappa and shortly after another at Cumberland Mills…About the same time a Lodge of the Iron Hall was formed. The order was for men only and required a mint of money to run…\n\nA year or two later labor organizations began to be popular and the Knights of Labor being the pioneer grew apace. Within a year there were over a million in the United States. The need of a society like this was never really felt in Westbrook yet it came and came with a rush. Within a year four lodges were established in the town… The Knights of Labor organization was worthy of a better fate as the precepts taught were good and nearly all were eligible to join, the only occupations that were denied admission were Lawyers, Bankers, Gamblers and Politicians, but Trades Unions took the place of the general union, being more select and more easily managed. Trades Unions have never flourished in Westbrook the only attempt being a Paper Makers Union which lasted only a few months.\n\nThe Red Men started at Cumberland Mills about 1890 with over one hundred charter members… The wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of members have a society connected with the Red Men called Daughters of Pocahontas.\n\nThe Foresters of America also hold meetings regularly and are a worthy organization as their name would indicate. [See Spring 2009 Newsletter, for more information on this Order.]\n\nOccasionally one portion of a cummunity (sic) feels called upon to look after and regulate doings of another portion hence we early find among us the Society of Knownothings who took upon themselves to say who should and who should not hold office. They began about 1853 and were short lived. The American Protective Association followed later, on the same lines, then the Orange Men and finally the American Mechanics, a very much milder and less aggressive order, has gained a foot hold with us and are doing a good work. The ladies connected with them and are styled Daughters of Liberty.\n\nThe new England Order of Protection also is a flourishing body composed of both men and women and have an insurance connected with them and are doing a good work.\n\nThe Catholic people also have their societies and hold meetings regularly. The principal among them are the Saint John the Baptist and Saint Joseph's Lodges. They are in a measure under the care of the church and the members are pledged to temperance. The work is performed in the French language.\n\nThere may be other societies which the writer has overlooked but enough has been written to show that no one coming here either transiently or permanently need fear of not finding a lodge home. The societies at present in existence are Masons Lodge, and Eastern Star in each end of the town, also Chapter and Council Odd Fellows, two lodges, Encampment and Rebekah, Knights of Pythias, two lodges and the Sisterhood, a Grange, Grand Army Post with Relief Corps, Sons of Veterans with Ladies' Aid, two Commanderies of the Golden Cross, two of Red Men with Pocahontas, Foresters, United Order of American Mechanics with Daughters of Liberty, Saint John and Saint Joseph's societies, Good Templars, New England Order of Protection with an open field for any other promising order that may choose to come among us.\n\n[Condensed from the 1907 Board of Trade Magazine; spelling left uncorrected.]\n\n[Also of note, the Society has a record book from The Saccarappa Martha Washington Charitable Society, 1846}\n\nIn keeping with last month’s theme, and to enlighten those who believe that Westbrook was called a ‘mill town’ only because of S.D. Warren Paper Co. & Dana Warp Mills, here is a transcript of an article from the Society’s archives. There is no notation if it appeared in a local paper but the photo that accompanied the article seems to have come from newsprint and was not of reproduction quality. (It is a photo of an “old Saccarappa Sawmill that was about 100 years old when it was torn down at the turn of the century” from its site near “Pork Hill”.) The mill scene photograph seen above is from the Ernest Rowe Collection which was originally photographed on glass lantern slides. The slides were digitized by the Warren Memorial Library and donated to the Society.\n\nTHE MILLS OF SACCARAPPA IN 1858\n\nThis sketch of early Westbrook was written about the turn of the century by Mr. E. J. Haskell\n\nStarting on the right bank of the river, the first mill on the upper dam was that of the G. & L. P. Warren Company. It was a saw mill and ran the year around. On the island was the thread mill, so called, filled with machinery for making cotton cloth. This mill was not operated in 1858. At the opening of the Civil War it was started as a paper mill, but ran only a short time because on a Saturday morning it caught fire and burned to the ground. There were also the ruins of another mill on the island.\n\nOn the mainland there was a grist-mill run by Mr. Bickford; next a mill for grinding plaster run by Mr. Allen, the father of Mrs. W. L. Knowlton; then the saw mill of Mr. Dana Brigham, and the saw mill of Mr. Samuel Clements. With that of the Warren's, these mills did a large business sawing logs into dimension timber and boards.\n\nNext there was a shingle and clapboard mill run by Mr. Thomas Akers; then the old silk mill built by Mr. Vogel and run by him until it was broken into one night and all the stock and the silk stock taken. After that, the business was given up and the mill was used for making harnesses for cotton and woolen mills. This was operated, I think, by Mr. James Pennell.\n\nOn the other side of the river on the upper dam was a small mill making bats or batting from the waste of cotton mills, run by Mr. Stephen Cole and others. It was not operated much after 1858. Then came the mills of the Westbrook Mfg. Company, composed of one brick mill of five stories, a two-story building beside it, and a wooden building nearer the road, that was the duck mill, so called. This building was replaced in 1865 by a three-story brick building, the foundations of which are still standing.\n\nThe power for all these mills was generated by over-shot, breast, and under-shot wheels. I think the only under-shot wheel was used in the harness mill and that was run by the water discharged by the mills above.\n\nThe river was full of logs almost all the time. There was a main boom opposite the place where the house of Ovide Fredette now stands, a boom at Small's and one at Steep Ledge. There were side booms between these as well as below the main boom and between the dams.\n\nThe river was very uneven in its flow. In the late summer it was so low that men could go out into the bed of the river with rakes and hoes and clear out the channel so that the water would flow to their side of the river and keep the wheels turning. Then in late fall and in the spring it was so high that the mills were troubled with back-water.\n\nAs soon as it was sawed, the lumber was taken to the yards and stacked. One yard for the Warren mill was between Park Hill and the river. Another yard was the flat between Depot and Saco Streets on the south side of the railroad tracks.\n\nThe yards were well filled with lumber although teams of six and eight yoke of oxen with a span of horses as leaders, were hauling it day and night to Portland to be shipped.\n\nThe roads in the spring and fall were very bad. The wheels of the lumber teams would sink to the hubs even in the villages, and sometimes they were obliged to go into the fields to get out of a bad place…[area missing in article]…turbines. This meant taking out enough ledge at the end of the mill to make a flume eighteen feet deep and a raceway to the river below the falls.\n\nThe work of drilling and blasting, all hand work, was started in the spring of 1858. The agent being a stranger, did not know what wages to give the men. He called them together and asked what they thought they should have. After talking it over, they said their work was worth 75 cents a day and they were paid that. These wages were not as low as might appear, as milk was 4 cents a quart, eggs 12 cents a dozen and butter about 15 cents a pound. Everything was in the same proportion except sugar and flour, but as molasses and meal were quite generally used, it was not hard to support a family.\n\nThe hours of labor were about twelve in the saw mills and eleven in the textile mills.\n\nThis is a sketch of how mills of Saccarappa looked to a boy if eight in those times."
