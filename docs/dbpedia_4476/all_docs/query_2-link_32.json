        "text": "Visiting this memorial is a moving experience that’s featured on many Washington DC tours. Delve deeper into the history of America’s capital on a tour of Washington DC’s historic landmarks, which typically also cover the Lincoln Memorial, the US Capitol Building, and the Washington Monument. Other ways to explore include walking tours, biking through the monuments at night, or a bus tour of the city.\n\nThe site is operated by the National Park Service; rangers are available to answer questions from morning until late evening on a daily basis.\n\nThe site is wheelchair-accessible; wheelchairs are available to rent on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nAdmission to the memorial is free.\n\nLocated between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, the site is easy to reach by public transport. The nearest Metro stops are the Smithsonian and Federal Triangle stations. Many tours offer pickup and drop-off services throughout the city.\n\nThe park is open 24 hours a day year round but if you want to see the full display, keep in mind that the fountains are typically winterized December through March. Visit the memorial at night to see it illuminated by lights from the reflection pool and pillars. If you’d rather have the place to yourself, visit in the early morning.\n\nAlong with a sketch of a man peering over a wall, the words “Kilroy was Here,” were a piece of graffiti that was circulated worldwide during the war. The words been engraved in two hidden locations within the memorial. The cartoon was said to spread hope and connection amongst American soldiers, and remains important to many who visit the memorial to search for the etching. You can find it near the Pennsylvania Pillar."
