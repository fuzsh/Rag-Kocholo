Tappan in Bloom\n\nEnjoy the vibrant burst of color in the small triangle between Kings Highway and Greenbush Road as you walk or drive through the\n\nhistoric center of Tappan. Most of the bulbs in bloom now were planted several years ago by Master Gardener and THS board member\n\nJoe Napoli and Tappan resident Jack Higgins. The bulbs have proliferated and were augmented by landscape designer and Tappan\n\nresident Mary Ellen LeWarn of Ironwood Design. In the fall of 2018, THS and the Orangetown Highway Department collaborated to get\n\nthe triangle in shape. A Community Service grant from Conservation Energy helped with the purchase of some of the plants.\n\nThe small triangle, known as the Gateway Triangle, was created next to the larger Memorial Triangle in 2009 by the Highway\n\nDepartment in order to improve traffic safety in Tappan’s historic center, where several roads converge. Together, the Tappantown\n\nHistorical Society, the Tappan Library, and the Tappan Reformed Church officially “Adopted- the- Spot” and over the years have tried to\n\nplant and maintain it. Not an easy task. Therefore, in 2018, THS asked Ironwood to design a low- maintenance garden. The Highway\n\nDepartment, which had installed a sprinkler system in 2009, helped with the site preparation and plants, and Ironwood did the\n\nplanting. With the help of the library and TRC, we will continue to maintain the triangle and plant annuals when possible.\n\nAs members, you are a part of this effort. Your support and commitment to THS help us to preserve and enhance the character and\n\nbeauty of the historic center of Tappan."
