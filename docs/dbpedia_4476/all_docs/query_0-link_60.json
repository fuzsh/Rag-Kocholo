Under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is prima facie evidence of the original documents published in the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510). It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this material without the express, written permission of the Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee.

Thus, 33 CFR 1.01-1 refers to title 33, part 1, section 01-1. ---------------------------- [[Page v]] EXPLANATION The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. [[Page vi]] Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000. ``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010. CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. [[Page vii]] An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume. The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

(3) Authority, pursuant to CERCLA section 106(a), to issue orders to protect the public health and welfare and the environment whenever that official determines that a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment. (4) Authority, pursuant to CERCLA section 104(e), except section 104(e)(7)(C), to enter establishments or other places where hazardous substances are or have been generated, stored, treated, disposed of, or transported from to inspect and obtain records, reports, samples and information in support of the response functions delegated in paragraphs (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section. (5) Authority, pursuant to CERCLA section 122, to enter into an agreement with any person (including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility from which a release or substantial threat of release emanates, or any other potential responsible person), to perform any response action, provided that such action will be done properly by such person. (f) Except for the authority granted in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section, each Coast Guard official to whom authority is granted in this section may redelegate and authorize successive redelegations of that authority. The authority granted in paragraph (e)(3) of this section may only be redelegated to commissioned officers. (g) The response authority described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not include authority to-- (1) Summarily remove or destroy a vessel; or (2) Take any other action that constitutes intervention under CERCLA, the Intervention on the High Seas Act (33 U.S.C. 1471 et. seq.), or other applicable laws. ``Intervention'' means any detrimental action taken against the interest of a vessel or its cargo without the consent of the vessel's owner or operator.

Source: CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 1.05-1 Delegation of rulemaking authority. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security is empowered by various statutes to issue regulations regarding the functions, powers and duties of the Coast Guard. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security has delegated much of this authority to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, including authority to issue regulations regarding the functions of the Coast Guard and the authority to redelegate and authorize successive redelegations of that authority within the Coast Guard. (c) The Commandant has reserved the authority to issue any rules and regulations determined to be significant under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. (d) The Commandant has redelegated the authority to develop and issue those regulations necessary to implement laws, treaties and Executive Orders to the Assistant Commandant for Marine Safety, Security and Stewardship (CG-5). The Commandant further redelegates this same authority to the Director, National Pollution Fund Center (Director, NPFC) for those regulations within the Director, NPFC area of responsibility. (1) The Assistant Commandant for Marine Safety, Security, and Stewardship may further reassign the delegated authority of this paragraph to: (i) Any Director within the CG-5 Directorate as appropriate; or (ii) Any other Assistant Commandant as appropriate. (2) The authority redelegated in paragraph (d) of this section is limited to those regulations determined to be nonsignificant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866. (e)(1) The Commandant has redelegated to the Coast Guard District Commanders, with the reservation that this authority must not be further redelegated except as specified in paragraph (i) below, the authority to issue regulations pertaining to the following: (i) Anchorage grounds and special anchorage areas. (ii) The designation of lightering zones. (iii) The operation of drawbridges. [[Page 13]] (iv) The establishment of Regulated Navigation Areas. (v) The establishment of safety and security zones. (vi) The establishment of special local regulations. (vii) The establishment of inland waterways navigation regulations.

Sec. 1.05-5 Marine Safety and Security Council. The Marine Safety and Security Council, composed of senior Coast Guard officials, acts as policy advisor to the Commandant and is the focal point of the Coast Guard regulatory system. The Marine Safety and Security Council provides oversight, review, and guidance for all Coast Guard regulatory activity. [CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003] Sec. 1.05-10 Regulatory process overview. (a) Most rules of local applicability are issued by District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers while rules of wider applicability are issued by senior Coast Guard officials at Coast Guard Headquarters. For both significant rulemaking (defined by Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review) and non- significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers the regulatory process begins when an office chief with program responsibilities identifies a possible need for a new regulation or for changes to an existing regulation. The need may arise due to statutory changes, or be based on internal review or public input. Early public involvement is strongly encouraged. (b) After a tentative significant regulatory approach is developed, a significant regulatory project proposal is submitted to the Marine Safety and Security Council for approval. The proposal describes the scope of the proposed regulation, alternatives considered, and potential cost and benefits, including possible environmental impacts. All significant regulatory projects require [[Page 14]] Marine Safety and Security Council approval. (c) Significant rulemaking documents must also be approved by the Commandant of the Coast Guard. (d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted, including documents to be published in the Federal Register. These may include regulatory evaluations, environmental analyses, requests for comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed rulemakings, and final rules.

The Coast Guard considers public participation essential to effective rulemaking, and encourages the public to participate in its rulemaking process. Coast Guard policy is to provide opportunities for public participation early in potential rulemaking projects. Generally, the Coast Guard will solicit public input by publishing a notice of public meeting or request for comments in the Federal Register. Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Supplemental Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and Interim Rules will usually provide 90 days, or more if possible, after publication for submission of comments. This time period is intended to allow interested persons the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through the submission of written data and views. However, certain cases and circumstances may make it necessary to provide a shorter comment period. Public meetings may also be held to provide an opportunity for oral presentations. The Coast Guard will consider the comments received and, in subsequent rulemaking documents, will incorporate a concise general statement of the comments received and identify changes from a proposed rule based on the comments. Sec. 1.05-20 Petitions for rulemaking. (a) Any member of the public may petition the Coast Guard to undertake a rulemaking action. There is no prescribed form for a petition for rulemaking, but the document should provide some supporting information as to why the petitioner believes the proposed rulemaking is necessary and the document should clearly indicate that it is a petition for rulemaking. Petitions should be addressed to the Commandant (CG- 0943), Attn: Executive Secretary, Marine Safety and Security Council, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7213, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7213. (b) The petitioner will be notified of the Coast Guard's decision whether to initiate a rulemaking or not. If the Coast Guard decides not to pursue a rulemaking, the petitioner will be notified of the reasons why. If the Coast Guard decides to initiate rulemaking, it will follow the procedure outlined in this subpart. The Coast Guard may publish a notice acknowledging receipt of a petition for rulemaking in the Federal Register. (c) Any petition for rulemaking and any reply to the petition will be kept in a public docket open for inspection. [CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003; USCG-2008-0179, 73 FR 35001, June 19, 2008; USCG-2014-0410, 79 FR 38427, July 7, 2014] Sec. 1.05-25 Public docket. (a) A public docket is maintained electronically for each petition for rulemaking and each Coast Guard rulemaking project and notice published in the Federal Register. Each docket contains copies of every rulemaking document published for the project, public comments received, summaries of public meetings or hearings, regulatory assessments, and other publicly-available information. Members of the public may inspect the public docket and copy any documents in the docket. Public dockets for Coast Guard rulemakings are available electronically at http:// www.regulations.gov. To access a rulemaking, enter the docket number associated with rulemaking in the ``Search'' box and click ``Go .'' These documents are also kept at a [[Page 15]] Docket Management Facility maintained by the Department of Transportation, West Building, room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. (b) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated by Coast Guard District Commanders are available for public inspection at the appropriate Coast Guard District office or online at http:// www.regulations.gov. Paragraph (a) of this section describes how to access and view these documents. (c) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated by Captains of the Port are available for inspection at the appropriate Captains of the Port Office or online at http://www.regulations.gov. Paragraph (a) of this section describes how to access and view these documents. [USCG-2008-0179, 73 FR 35001, June 19, 2008] Sec. 1.05-30 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). An advance notice of proposed rulemaking may be used to alert the affected public about a new regulatory project, or when the Coast Guard needs more information about what form proposed regulations should take, the actual need for a regulation, the cost of a proposal, or any other information. The ANPRM may solicit general information or ask the public to respond to specific questions. Sec. 1.05-35 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, an NPRM is generally published in the Federal Register for Coast Guard rulemakings. The NPRM normally contains a preamble statement in sufficient detail to explain the proposal, its background, basis, and purpose, and the various issues involved. It also contains a discussion of any comments received in response to prior notices, a citation of legal authority for the rule, and the text of the proposed rule. Sec. 1.05-40 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM). An SNPRM may be issued if a proposed rule has been substantially changed from the original notice of proposed rulemaking. The supplemental notice advises the public of the revised proposal and provides an opportunity for additional comment. To give the public a reasonable opportunity to become reacquainted with a rulemaking, a supplemental notice may also be issued if considerable time has elapsed since publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. An SNPRM contains the same type of information generally included in an NPRM. Sec. 1.05-45 Interim rule. (a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while other portions of the proposed rule are still under development. (b) An interim rule will be published in the Federal Register with an effective date that will generally be at least 30 days after the date of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable and is codified in the next annual revision of the appropriate title of the Code of Federal Regulations. Sec. 1.05-50 Final rule. In some instances, a final rule may be issued without prior notice and comment. When notice and comment procedures have been used, and after all comments received have been considered, a final rule is issued. A final rule document contains a preamble that discusses comments received, responses to comments and changes made from the proposed or interim rule, a citation of legal authority, and the text of the rule. Sec. 1.05-55 Direct final rule. (a) A direct final rule may be issued to allow noncontroversial rules that are unlikely to result in adverse public comment to become effective more quickly. [[Page 16]] (b) A direct final rule will be published in the Federal Register with an effective date that is generally at least 90 days after the date of publication. (c) The public will usually be given at least 60 days from the date of publication in which to submit comments or notice of intent to submit comments. (d) If no adverse comment or notice of intent to submit an adverse comment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the Federal Register to confirm that the rule will go into effect as scheduled. (e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the final rule section of the Federal Register to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If an adverse comment clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it is possible to remove that part without affecting the remaining portions, the Coast Guard may adopt as final those parts of the rule on which no adverse comment was received. Any part of a rule that is the subject of an adverse comment will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with a rulemaking following receipt of an adverse comment, a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be published unless an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment applies. (f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change. [CGD 94-105, 60 FR 49224, Sept. 22, 1995] Sec. 1.05-60 Negotiated rulemaking. (a) The Coast Guard may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2) when it is in the public interest. (b) Generally, the Coast Guard will consider negotiated rulemaking when: (1) There is a need for a rule; (2) There are a limited number of representatives for identifiable parties affected by the rule; (3) There is a reasonable chance that balanced representation can be reached in the negotiated rulemaking committee and that the committee members will negotiate in good faith; (4) There is a likelihood of a committee consensus in a fixed time period; (5) The negotiated rulemaking process will not unreasonably delay the rule; (6) The Coast Guard has resources to do negotiated rulemaking; and (7) The Coast Guard can use the consensus of the committee in formulating the NPRM and final rule.

This part describes procedures for enforcement and administration of all statutory penalty provisions that the Coast Guard is authorized to enforce. Sec. 1.07-5 Definitions. (a) The term District Commander, when used in this subpart, means the District Commander, or any person under the District Commander's command, delegated to carry out the provisions of Sec. 1.07-10(b). (b) The term Hearing Officer means a Coast Guard officer or employee who has been delegated the authority to assess civil penalties. (c) The term issuing officer means any qualified Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer. (d) The term Notice of Violation means a notification of violation and preliminary assessment of penalty, given to a party, in accordance with Sec. 1.07-11. (e) The term party means the person alleged to have violated a statute or regulation to which a civil penalty applies and includes an individual or public or private corporation, partnership [[Page 17]] or other association, or a governmental entity. [CGD 93-079, 59 FR 16560, Apr. 7, 1994] Sec. 1.07-10 Reporting and investigation. (a) Any person may report an apparent violation of any law, regulation, or order that is enforced by the Coast Guard to any Coast Guard facility. When a report of an apparent violation has been received, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any Coast Guard personnel, the matter is investigated or evaluated by Coast Guard personnel. Once an apparent violation has been investigated or evaluated, a report of the investigation may be sent to the District Commander or other designated official in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or a Notice of Violation under Sec. 1.07-11 may be given to the party by an issuing officer. (b) Reports of any investigation conducted by the Coast Guard or received from any other agency which indicate that a violation may have occurred may be forwarded to a District Commander or other designated official for further action. This is normally the District Commander of the District in which the violation is believed to have occurred, or the District in which the reporting unit or agency is found. The report is reviewed to determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case. If there is insufficient evidence, the case is either returned for further investigation or closed if further action is unwarranted. The case is closed in situations in which the investigation has established that a violation did not occur, the violator is unknown, or there is little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts. If it is determined that a prima facie case does exist, a case file is prepared and forwarded to the Hearing Officer, with a recommended action. A record of any prior violations by the same person or entity, is forwarded with the case file.

(a) After investigation and evaluation of an alleged violation has been completed, an issuing officer may issue a Notice of Violation to the party. (b) The Notice of Violation will contain the following information: (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations violated; (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation; (3) The amount of proposed penalty that appears to be appropriate; (4) A statement that payment of the proposed penalty within 45 days will settle the case; (5) The place to which, and the manner in which, payment is to be made; (6) A statement that the party may decline the Notice of Violation and that if the Notice of Violation is declined, the party has the right to a hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing Officer. (7) A statement that failure to either pay the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation or decline the Notice of Violation and request a hearing within 45 days will result in a finding of default and the Coast Guard will proceed with the civil penalty in the amount recommended on the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the procedures described in 33 CFR 1.07-10(b). (c) The Notice of Violation may be hand delivered to the party or an employee of the party, or may be mailed to the business address of the party.

(a) When a case is received for action, the Hearing Officer makes a preliminary examination of the material submitted. If, on the basis of the preliminary examination, the Hearing Officer determines that there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there is any other reason which would make penalty action inappropriate, the Hearing Officer returns the case to the District Commander with a written statement of the reason. The District Commander may close the case or cause a further investigation of the alleged violation to be made with a view toward resubmittal of the case to the Hearing Officer. (b) If on the basis of the preliminary examination of the case file, the Hearing Officer determines that a violation appears to have been committed, the Hearing Officer notifies the party in writing of: (1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations; (2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation; (3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting the penalty; (4) The amount of penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on the material then available to the Hearing Officer; (5) The right to examine all materials in the case file and have a copy of all written documents provided upon request; and, (6) The fact that the party may demand a hearing prior to any actual assessment of a penalty.

A hearing must be requested in writing; the request must specify the issues which are in dispute. Failure to specify a nonjurisdictional issue will preclude its consideration. (b) The right to a hearing is waived if the party does not submit the request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation. At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, a hearing may be granted if the party submits a late request. (c) The Hearing Officer must promptly schedule all hearings which are requested. The Hearing Officer shall grant any delays or continuances which may be necessary or desirable in the interest of fairly resolving the case. (d) A party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the scheduled hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.

The alleged violator may, upon request, receive a free copy of all the written evidence in the case file, except material that would disclose or lead to the disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant. Other evidence or material, such as blueprints, sound or video tapes, oil samples, and photographs may be examined in the Hearing Officer's offices. The Hearing Officer may provide for examination or testing of evidence at other locations if there are adequate safeguards to prevent loss or tampering. Sec. 1.07-35 Request for confidential treatment. (a) In addition to information treated as confidential under Sec. 1.07-30, a request for confidential treatment of a document or portion thereof may be made by the person supplying the information on the basis that the information is: (1) Confidential financial information, trade secrets, or other material exempt from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); (2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or (3) Otherwise exempt by law from disclosure. (b) The person desiring confidential treatment must submit the request to the Hearing Officer in writing and state the reasons justifying nondisclosure. Failure to make a timely request may result in a document being considered as nonconfidential and subject to release. (c) Confidential material is not considered by the Hearing Officer in reaching a decision unless: (1) It has been furnished by a party, or (2) It has been furnished pursuant to a subpoena. [CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002] Sec. 1.07-40 Counsel.

A party may present the testimony of any witness either through a personal appearance or through a written statement. The party may request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the case, the Hearing Officer seeks to obtain the witness' appearance. Because many statutes prescribing civil penalties do not provide subpoena power, there may be cases where a witness cannot be required to attend. In such a case, the Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of testimony. If none of these procedures is practical, the Hearing Officer shall proceed on the basis of the evidence before him. [CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002] Sec. 1.07-55 Hearing procedures. (a) The Hearing Officer must conduct a fair and impartial proceeding in which the party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the outset of the [[Page 20]] hearing, the Hearing Officer insures that the party is aware of the nature of the proceeding and of the alleged violation, and of the provisions of the law or regulation allegedly violated. (b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be determined by the Hearing Officer is presented. The party has the right to examine, and to respond to or rebut, this material. The party may offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or statement. (c) At the close of the party's presentation of evidence, the Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Hearing Officer may allow the party to respond to any such evidence submitted. (d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer is not bound by strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the Hearing Officer must give due consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of evidence. (e) The Hearing Officer may take notice of matters which are subject to a high degree of indisputability and are commonly known in the community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known accuracy. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer gives the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written statement of the matters as to which notice was taken in the record, with the basis for such notice, including a statement that the party consented to notice being taken or a summary of the party's objections. (f) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the party may present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the Hearing Officer and for further review. The Hearing Officer shall allow a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the date by which it must be received. If the statement is not received within the time prescribed, or within the limits of any extension of time granted by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer renders his decision in the case. Sec. 1.07-60 Records. (a) A verbatim transcript will not normally be prepared. The Hearing Officer prepares notes on the material and points raised by the party, in sufficient detail to permit a full and fair review and resolution of the case, should it be appealed.

If a verbatim transcript is made, the party shall submit two copies to the Hearing Officer not later than the time of filing an administrative appeal. The Hearing Officer includes them in the record. [CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002] Sec. 1.07-65 Hearing Officer's decisions. (a) The Hearing Officer issues a written decision. Any decision to assess a penalty is based upon substantial evidence in the record. If the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the record establishing the alleged violation or some other violation of which the party had full and fair notice, the Hearing Officer shall dismiss the case and remand it to the District Commander. A dismissal is without prejudice to the District Commander's right to refile the case and have it reheard if additional evidence is obtained. A dismissal following a rehearing is final and with prejudice. (b) If the Hearing Officer assesses a penalty, the Hearing Officer's decision contains a statement advising the party of the right to an administrative appeal. The party is advised that failure to submit an appeal within the prescribed time will bar its consideration and that failure to appeal on the basis of a particular issue will constitute a waiver of that issue in any subsequent proceeding.

(a) Any appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer must be submitted by a party within 30 days from the date of receipt of the decision. The appeal and any supporting brief must be submitted to the Hearing Officer. The only issues which will be considered on appeal are those issues specified in the appeal which were properly raised before the Hearing Officer and jurisdictional questions. (b) The failure to file an appeal within the prescribed time limit results in the action of the Hearing Officer becoming the final agency action in the case. Sec. 1.07-75 Action on appeals. (a) Upon receipt, the Hearing Officer provides a copy of the appeal and any supporting brief to the District Commander who referred the case. Any comments which the District Commander desires to submit must be received by the Hearing Officer within 30 days. The Hearing Officer includes the District Commander's comments, or not later than 30 days after receipt of the appeal if no comments are submitted by the District Commander, the Hearing Officer forwards all materials in the case to the Commandant. (b) The Commandant issues a written decision in each case and furnishes copies to the party, the District Commander, and the Hearing Officer, The Commandant may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision, or remand the case for new or additional proceedings. In the absence of a remand, the decision of the Commandant on appeal shall be final. In addition to the actions which may be taken by the Commandant on appeal, the Commandant may also remit, mitigate or suspend the assessment in whole or in part. Upon the taking of remission, mitigation, or suspension action, the Commandant will inform the party of the action and any conditions placed on the action.

(b) Petitions to reopen must be in writing describing the newly found evidence and must state why the evidence would probably produce a different result favorable to the petitioner, whether the evidence was known to the petitioner at the time of the hearing and, if not, why the newly found evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence. The party must submit the petition to the Hearing Officer. (c) The District Commander may file comments in opposition to the petition. If comments are filed, a copy is provided the party. (d) A petition to reopen is considered by the Hearing Officer unless an appeal has been filed, in which case the petition is considered by the Commandant. (e) The decision on the petition is decided on the basis of the record, the petition, and the comments in opposition, if any. The petition is granted only when newly found evidence is described which has a direct and material bearing on the issues and when a valid explanation is provided as to why the evidence was not and could not have been, in the exercise of due diligence, produced at the hearing. The decision is rendered in writing. (f) Following a denial of a petition to reopen, the party is given 30 days to file an appeal if one has not already been filed, or to amend an appeal which has already been filed.

(a) Payment of a civil penalty may be made by check or postal money order payable to the U.S. Coast Guard. (b) Within 30 days after receipt of the Commandant's decision on appeal, or the Hearing Officer's decision in a case in which no appeal has been filed, the party must submit payment of any assessed penalty to the office specified in the assessment notice.

The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 641(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 654 (Pub.

(b) Charges established by District Commander. The charges for supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary. (c) Sales to vessels and other watercraft. (1) The charges imposed for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast Guard. (2) Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are considered appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general stores, or repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the convenience of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their request. It is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and stock equipment and supplies except as provided for in current instructions issued by competent authority. (3) Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The responsibility to make this determination rests with the District Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates. (4) The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for such services. (5) The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will set forth [[Page 28]] the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to the vessel or watercraft.
