Even today, that battle stands as the greatest loss the United States Army ever suffered! Nine hundred of the 1200 soldiers were killed or mortally wounded. Nearly 100 camp followers suffered the same fate at the hands of nearly 1500 warriors under the command of Little Turtle of the Miami’s and Blue Jacket of the Shawnee’s.\n\nFirst Congressional Investigation: The first congressional investigation in U.S. history took place after that battle. When, during the investigation, the “evidence” began to implicate members of President Washington’s cabinet, the investigation was called off.\n\nAnthony Wayne’s Legion: Fortunately, the 1791 massacre and incredible embarrassment of the United States Army was not the end of the story. President Washington called Revolutionary War leader Anthony Wayne back into service. He was given broad authority to raise and equip a “real” army. Wayne modeled it after the old Roman Legions. The Legion of the United States Army became well-equipped, trained, and disciplined.\n\nThe fort of “Recovery”: In 1793, Wayne ordered soldiers to construct a fort on the site of the disastrous ‘91 massacre. By choosing this land, Wayne was sending a psychological message to the natives that the army and the United States were back! Unlike the previous forts named for war heroes, he ordered that this fort be called “Recovery!”\n\nThe Battle of Fort Recovery: The second conflagration (1794), “The Battle of Fort Recovery,” took place on the same triangle of land as St. Clair’s Massacre. However, with the fort’s protection, nearly 250 soldiers could resist a two-day relentless attack by 2500 warriors again under the command of Little Turtle and Blue Jacket. After the defeat of the natives, Little Turtle said he would never again fight the American Army. He said, “To do so would be suicide to my people.” This battle ultimately broke the back of Indian resistance, led to the signing of the Treaty of Greenville (August 1795), and opened up the lands of the Northwest Territory for settlement by the colonists. The success of the US Legion at Fort Recovery proved that the United States had a viable army, that it was in control of its territories, and that the survival of the United States was at last assured!\n\nVisitors to present-day Fort Recovery will be impressed with how much of that watershed military history comes alive today through:\n\nThe clearly evident “Wabash hillside and triangle of land” where over a thousand lives were lost, and the river flowed bloody. Where a surviving St. Clair soldier described the scene as “A pumpkin field, a steaming pumpkin field!” (scalped heads on that cold snowy November morning)\n\nThe reconstructed Anthony Wayne Fort has two-story blockhouses a connecting stockade, a well, and a flagpole!\n\nA totally renovated (2010) museum houses such detailed and accurate figures of Wayne’s Legion that students sometimes step back, thinking they are real. Even a dragoon and his horse! Plus, of course, the stories of Josiah Harmar, Arthur St. Clair, Anthony Wayne, and William Wells!\n\nThe prehistoric and historic Native American history, models and artifacts tell the stories of those proud people! Blue Jacket of the Shawnees, Little Turtle of the Miami’s!\n\nThe obelisk monument stands over 100 feet high in honor of the soldiers who died in both battles and whose remains are buried under that monument!\n\nThe Greenville Treaty Line Marker on the fort ground designated this point as the northwest corner of the land that could be settled by “white men.”\n\nThe pioneer cemetery where the remains of soldiers and their families who stayed to make their homes near the fort are buried.\n\nTwo log cabins depicting early colonial homes and tools.\n\nGarst Museum & Annie Oakley Center\n\nAdmission to Garst Museum & National Annie Oakley Center in Greenville is approx. $12/person.\n\nOpen: Tuesday – Saturday from 10am – 4pm.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 205 N.

Pike in Norwich, Ohio\n\nPhone: 740-826-3305\n\nWeb: click here\n\nThe Zane Grey National Road Museum\n\nThis excerpt is from a past edition of OhioTraveler\n\nAn anecdote about Zanesville recalled from childhood: A tourist in town asked for directions and was told to go to the middle of the bridge and turn left. He was also informed that he could cross the bridge and still be on the same side of the river. Each statement is preposterous as the other, yet both are true. As well as the only Y-bridge in the world, Zanesville is also known as the center of the pottery industry. At one time, there were 41 potteries in Muskingum County producing millions of artifacts, a few of which show up on Antiques Roadshow and fetch exorbitant prices.\n\nBut those anomalies pale compared to the literary accomplishments of the city’s favorite son. Zane Grey’s book sales have exceeded forty million copies of nearly ninety novels; too many to be published in his lifetime. Twenty-five were produced posthumously, and reprints of his work continue to this day, seventy years after his death.\n\nBorn Pearl Zane Gray in 1872, he grew up in Zanesville, a town founded by his maternal ancestors. His dentist’s father disapproved of nearly everything his son found rewarding. Pearl Zane, the fourth of five children was acknowledged in early childhood as complex. He was never inclined toward academics, yet was a voracious reader, especially of Revolutionary and Western history.\n\nA gifted athlete, his other interests were baseball, fishing, and brawling—the latter intensified by a testy personality and a short fuse. Of course, with a name like Pearl, a boy had better be able to fight.\n\nGrey wrote his first story at age fifteen, but his father ripped it to shreds and beat him severely. It was his mentor, an old gent named Muddy Miser, who encouraged him to pursue his instincts while his father insisted he learns dentistry—which he detested, though the training was prescient in an odd way.\n\nIn 1889 the Grays suffered a financial setback that hastened a move to Columbus and a change of the last name to Grey. Assisting monetarily, Pearl Zane made unlicensed house calls extracting teeth—until the state board caught up with him. Fortunately, he also caught the attention of a baseball scout, resulting in numerous college scholarship offers.\n\nHis study habits at the University of Pennsylvania reflected earlier patterns, spending most of his time at baseball, creative writing, and womanizing, all of which had priority over curriculum. With minimal scholastic accomplishment, he graduated in 1896 and opened a dental practice in New York City—at once and permanently dropping his first name.\n\nThe location was a poor choice given the competition, but New York was the publishing capital, and writing had become his passion—tempered with offers from professional baseball. Dentistry was merely a means to an end.\n\nNine years later and still foundering, he married Lina Roth, whom he called Dolly. Eleven years his junior, she became his greatest asset. Her confidence and natural ability as an editor, along with an inheritance, allowed him to abandon the dental charade forever.\n\nHis first book, Betty Zane, a thinly disguised biography of a direct aunt and Revolutionary War heroine, was turned down by numerous publishers but won acclaim after self-publishing with Dolly’s endowment. Three of his first four books were Indian-fighting pioneer stories of the Ohio Valley, but Zane Grey became best known for his Western fables that were first serialized in Harper’s Magazine.\n\nHis style generated a huge network of fans who eagerly awaited new publications that appeared like clockwork. But due to envy, the critics were as ravenous as his admirers. They alleged his depictions of the West were too fanciful and overly violent—his characters unrealistically larger than life. But in truth, Grey relied on personal experience, scrupulous note-taking, and photography. His works were categorized as fiction, yet based on people and situations he had experienced first-hand, punctuated with authentic dialogue.\n\nUnknown and unfathomable to his devotees was the fact that Grey fought serious bouts of depression all his life with long unproductive spells. “Realism,” he said, “is death to me. I cannot stand life as it is.” He often left his wife and three children for weeks or months to go on adventurous excursions and spend time with mistresses that calmed his demons.\n\nWhen he returned, he would have a new story and frequently pounded out a complete book in two or three months. Attesting to his versatility and proficiency, he interspersed the Westerns with two hunting books, two baseball books, and eight fishing books.\n\nThe road to success had been excruciatingly long and convoluted, but the deferred arrival seemed to contain momentum that, once freed, was unstoppable. Grey became one of the first millionaire authors, and Hollywood developed a lust for his flair that exceeded book publishers. In 1918, he moved his family to Altadena, California, to be closer to the movie industry.\n\nAt one time, Grey owned his own motion picture company, which allowed faithfulness to his books to the degree of filming on the authentic locations he had described. Eventually, he sold the company and remained a consultant, but became disillusioned with the film industry over the dilution of his stories and characters. It was undoubtedly charitable to his conscience that many of Hollywood’s adaptations came after his death.\n\nEven so, he is credited with 110 films, one TV episode, The Zane Grey Show, and a series, Dick Powell’s Zane Grey Theater, which ran for five years based on his novels and short stories.\n\nZane Grey died in 1939 perfecting an exercise he loved as much as writing—the casting of his fly rod—off the porch of his California home.\n\nUnsurprisingly, several domains sought to declare him as their own. Of course, the city named as a derivative of his ancestral surname, known more for Zane Grey than he for it, will always pay tribute. Curiously the archives are not in Zanesville but in Norwich, ten miles east on Rt. 40. The National Road Zane Grey Museum honors the author, the area’s pottery industry, and the forging of the “Main Street to the West” that shares Grey’s famous theme.\n\nWhether coming or going, you will want to traverse Zanesville’s legendary Y-bridge on the Rt. 40 main thoroughfare, but vigilance is required in the middle—where the unexpected has been known to alter and sometimes add a new dimension to the journey.\n\nBy Robert Carpenter\n\nNational Veterans Memorial and Museum\n\nAdmission to the National Veterans Memorial and Museum is approx. $10/person.\n\nOpen: Wednesday – Sunday from 10am – 5pm.\n\nLocation: (Map it) 300 West Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio\n\nPhone: 614-362-2800\n\nWeb: https://nationalvmm.org/\n\nNational Veterans Memorial and Museum is here today because of John Glenn, former Ohio Senator and Marine Colonel.

But the people of their home regions have never forgotten them, and their pride is preserved even though the association is often little more than geography.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. Dover, Ohio is located in the middle of this exemplar region, and they have rights to the famous, but also the infamous—perhaps notorious is a better characterization—and no one in Dover expresses an overt smugness with this particular relationship.\n\nIt’s understandable that there is little celebration in claiming someone portrayed as the “bloodiest man in the annuls of America.” Still, there is a fascination with this man whose name is better known than the most renowned war-time commanders coexisting during the nation’s ultimate military ordeal.\n\nOver a period of time, he was interred in two separate caskets in Dover’s Fourth Street Cemetery, but even with this bizarre arrangement, his remains are not all there. Indeed, it is said by many that William Clark Quantrill was never all there.\n\nHistory books convey an impression that Quantrill was a hardened veteran who gained followers due to his wartime experience and martial acumen, when in fact he was little more than a boy—although one endowed with extraordinary leadership ability.\n\nThe oldest of eight children, Quantrill was only seventeen when he left his Dover home in 1854. His parents had swarmed attention on him, but apparently not the kind that cultivates ideal citizenship. His hard-drinking father beat him while his mother doted on him.\n\nAlthough psychiatric problems were not then as quickly recognized as today, it was acknowledged early on that William would never be a poster boy for mental health. Although no mention is made of bedwetting or playing with fire, the third symptom of a psychopathic killer in the making—torture and killing of animals—was William Quantrill’s boyhood pastime.\n\nModern psychiatry describes psychopaths as manipulators, risk-takers, and narcissists. They lack empathy, and have a total absence of conscience—but are usually quite intelligent. It’s not insanity, but rather a character flaw described in more polite terms as an antisocial personality. History implies that Quantrill’s contemporaries deemed such a depiction laughably inadequate.\n\nIn the most paradoxical of career choices, Quantrill began as a schoolteacher in Dover and then in Indiana and Illinois as he forged his way west on his first adventure.\n\nOccupational satisfaction eluded him from the beginning, and he dropped teaching in favor of gambling, but sparse winnings compelled him back to Dover before his twentieth birthday. It was his indulgent mother who convinced two friends to claim a plot of land in “free soil” Kansas for William and allow him to repay the courtesy by laboring on their farms. No one foresaw this maneuver as precipitous to the legend of “Bloody Kansas” which was almost totally composed by the treacherous hand of William Clark Quantrill.\n\nThe territory was a perfect bailiwick for someone of Quantrill’s predisposition. Kansas and Missouri were split on slavery and skirmishes between factions escalated as the War Between the States heated up. Quantrill soon disposed of his farming obligations in favor of collecting the bounty on runaway slaves. His most profitable scam was helping Jayhawkers (abolitionists) free slaves then recapturing them for the reward money. By 1860 he was wanted in Kansas for horse stealing, burglary, larceny and arson. He was never tried due to his escape to Missouri where he joined the Bushwhackers (Confederate guerillas).\n\nWith allegiance to a cause that better excused the instincts of a modern-day terrorist, his band of guerillas rapidly grew. They ambushed federal troops, robbed the Union’s mail and murdered civilians while burning and pillaging their way through every anti-slavery community in their path. Eventually, he was commissioned as a Captain in an authorized Missouri detachment but always operated outside the official chain of command.\n\nQuantrill was described as about 5’ 9” with a Roman nose and sandy hair. He always wore a slouch hat and high-heeled boots to enhance his stature, but it was his reputation that made him a bigger-than-life hero to many southern sympathizers. Under his lead rode Frank and Jessie James and the Younger brothers who after the war continued their Quantrill-learned hit-and-run tactics to rob banks. As well as superior leadership he was a strategist of uncommon skills. So effective were his devices that Union forces never gained the upper hand over his mercenaries.\n\nHis finest hour (in his mind) and the most despicable as seen by ethical citizens, was the August 1863 raid on Lawrence Kansas. In retaliation for a perceived Union crime against Confederate prisoners, Quantrill led more than four hundred guerillas with the intent of destroying the town. The strangest and most repulsive action resulted from his twisted, heretofore unspoken code that forbids harm to women—but forced them to watch as their husbands and sons were murdered.\n\nWith an estimated two hundred killed and most of the town burned, retribution by the Union was swift and far-reaching. Quantrill, never one to stand and fight, fled to Texas. Even some of his most hard-edged followers had been sickened by the slaughter in Lawrence and the Confederate command became disgusted and embarrassed by his atrocities. Texas authorities requested he leave. In the spring of 1864 he returned to Missouri, but there the rebels suffered one of their worst defeats. With resistance stronger and Quantrill having been declared an outlaw, he slipped away to Kentucky.\n\nOrganized Union troops had never come close to capturing him so they opted for a different tact. A man named Edwin Terrell—nearly as dastardly a wretch as Quantrill, on the premise that “it takes one to know one,” was authorized to hunt him down. On May 10, 1865, Terrell’s small band caught up with Quantrill and a few of his men in Taylorsville, Kentucky. In a shootout Quantrill was struck by a bullet that lodged in his spine, instantly paralyzing him. He was taken to Louisville where he declined in agony for nearly a month before dying at the age of twenty-seven. Fearing vandalism, his grave was disguised and left unmarked –which should have signaled the end to America’s most monstrous myth. It’s ironic that for years Quantrill’s name was spoken like a bad omen, but it was only after his death that the “raiders” designation was added—inserting new verve into the legacy and keeping it alive.\n\nTwenty- two years later Quantrill’s saga was further resuscitated with the treachery and deceit befitting the subject and all the miscreants involved. Quantrill’s mother enlisted the help of William Scott, a boyhood friend of Quantrill’s, to bring his remains back home to Dover. In Kentucky, the remains were exhumed and Mrs. Quantrill identified them by a chipped tooth. She was denied permission to remove the vestiges from the state—so a scheme was devised to steal them.\n\nFor two years following, Mrs. Quantrill toured Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas attempting to learn all she could of her son’s wartime activities, and returned to Dover for the final interment. However, Scott who had interim possession of the body parts pilfered the skull, some hair and five arm and leg bones. There was a burial, but it’s unclear whether it was with deception or agreement. There is the certainty of course, that the coffin lacked all the remains. Afterward, Scott tried to sell the skull to the Kansas State Historical Society, and the bones and hair were in their possession for a time. It’s also acknowledged that the skull was later in the possession of Scott’s son and used in fraternity initiations. Years passed before it was donated to a Dover museum where it remained until October 1992 when a decision for closure put the skull to rest in a tiny coffin in the Dover’s Fourth Street Cemetery. A flat marker can be found in the Quantrill family plot in the right rear of the burial ground near the alley.\n\nIn that same month, the five bones and hair were finally re-interred at the Old Confederate Veterans Home and Cemetery in Higginsville, Missouri.\n\nWilliam Quantrill’s story is not the most dignified of Ohio’s past, and many are more than willing to let Missouri and Kansas have an outsized share of his legacy. To this day there are descendants who deny connection to Quantrill.\n\nMatt Lauezenheiser, director of the Dover Historical Society and the historical J. E. Reeves Mansion located at 325 E. Iron Avenue said, “We don’t celebrate Quantrill Day here in Dover.” In the Carriage House Museum at the rear of the Reeves Mansion, there is a life-size wax replica of William Quantrill’s head—but you’ll have to ask to see it. Lauezeheiser says they are not trying to hide it, but for preservation they keep it stored in a refrigerator.\n\nIn all its perversity, this Dover native’s tale is still among the most memorable of Buckeye state folklore. Who can forget the narrative of Quantrill’s Raiders? It’s part of history.\n\nCall 800-815-2794 for hours, tours, and prices.\n\nRay Chapman’s Grave\n\nVisit Ray Chapman’s grave at Cleveland’s Lake View Cemetery.\n\nOpen: November 1 – March 31 from 7:30am – 5:30pm; April 1 – October 31 from 7:30am – 7:30pm\n\nLocation: (Map It) Lake View Cemetery at 12316 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio\n\nPhone: 216-421-2665\n\nExcerpt from a past edition of OhioTraveler.com\n\nVisit Ray Chapman’s Grave at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland\n\nThe Cleveland Indians/Guradians and Cincinnati Reds report for Spring Training in mid-February. It’s the time of year when everyone talks about baseball legends and folklore and dreams of winning the pennant.\n\nI was (and still am) a die-hard baseball fan as a kid. And the story I’ll share is well-documented, little-known, and told by my father and his father before.\n\nRay Chapman, “Chappie,” was a fan favorite and beloved by his teammates. He played shortstop for the Cleveland Indians from 1912 – 1920. In 1917, he set a record for most sacrifice hits, 67, in a season. He was a decent hitter with a career batting average of .278. He set a team record for stolen bases in a single season, 52, that stood until 1980. In 1918, he led the American League with runs scored and walks. He was an excellent bunter, and if the Gold Glove were awarded, he’d probably have a few of those, too.\n\nBack in the early 1900s, pitchers ruled the diamond. They could do things to the ball that today’s pitchers could only fantasize about. They scuffed it, spit tobacco juice on it, smeared dirt all around it, and eventually turned the white leather into a dark mass. New York Yankee submarine pitcher Carl Mays mucked the ball up with the best of them.\n\nAnd on August 16, 1920, Chappie stepped into the batter’s box to face Mays. Due to the lack of lighting and the invisible ball, many believe Chapman never even saw what killed him. It struck him in the head; batting helmets weren’t required until 30 some years later.\n\nAlthough many say Chapman may have been inducted into the Hall of Fame had his career not been cut short, he will forever be remembered as the only modern-era professional baseball player to die as a direct result of being hit by a pitched ball.\n\nHis death later led to changes in rules governing “doctoring” baseball.\n\nFor the rest of the 1920 season, the Cleveland ball club wore black armbands to honor their fallen teammate. Together, they achieved winning their first World Series that year.\n\nRay Chapman is buried in Cleveland’s Lake View Cemetery. Over 100,000 others spanning all walks of life join him, including President James A. Garfield, Eliot Ness, and John D. Rockefeller. Lake View Cemetery is also considered a beautiful botanical garden. If you want to pay homage to a fallen hero of America’s pastime, put a flower on Raymond Johnson Chapman’s grave this season and whisper “play ball.”\n\nBy Frank R. Satullo, The OhioTraveler\n\nSuperman Born in Cleveland\n\nPictured left to right are Jerry Siegel, writer, and Joe Shuster, illustrator\n\nSuperman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in Cleveland but they made little for their efforts.\n\n“Look! Up in the air. It’s a bird. It’s a plane.\n\nIt’s S-U-P-E-R-M-A-N !!!”\n\nWe wonder how many fans know that Superman started out as a villain. It was a short-lived effort before creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster turned the action hero into a good guy, who stood for “Truth, Justice, and the American Way.”\n\nWith Siegel doing the writing and Shuster the drawings, their Superman character got off to a slow start in 1933 and was rejected again and again by various magazines and comics.\n\nA new publisher, DC Comics, had used other works by Siegel and Shuster, so they weren’t exactly unknown. When the publisher’s new magazine “Action Comics” was getting ready, they got their chance. Shuster’s art of Superman lifting a car with his hands, and the comic book story inside written by Siegel, appeared in Action Comics No. 1 in the summer of 1938.\n\nBy the time issue No. 4 appeared on the newsstands, sales were off the charts. Sounds like a real success story for a couple of young teenagers who had dreams of Superman being known all over the world. Oops! The problem was Siegel and Shuster had signed over the rights to DC Comics for a scant $130, and a contract to supply the publisher with ongoing material.\n\nBy World War II Superman was one of the most recognized comic superheroes in the world. At the same time, other comic superheroes included Captain Marvel, Batman and Robin, The Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman. In 1941 The Saturday Evening Post reported that the pair was then earning $75,000 each per year for their creative efforts, but a mere fraction of DC’s Superman profits which by then had soared into the millions of dollars.\n\nFive years later Siegel and Shuster sued for more money and DC Comics fired them. That prompted still another legal battle, and two years later they accepted $200,000 and signed away any further claim to Superman. DC Comics soon took their names off the comics.\n\nThrough the lean years, the Superman co-creators prevailed even though it was hard to find work. With the pending release of the “Superman” movie in 1978, and with the backing of some of the biggest names in the comic book industry, DC Comics was persuaded to give the creators life-long pensions, health care benefits, and credit to them as creators was restored.\n\nMany in the comic industry felt it was not enough, considering Superman had become an icon and earned DC Comics billions of dollars. The Man of Steel had become one of the most recognized comic superheroes in the world through comics, toys, clothing, other merchandise, cartoons, radio, television, movies, video games, and even the Broadway stage. The money was just pouring in. Over the years there has been legal wrangling as to the rights to the Superman character, as well as appropriate payment to the co-creators. There are still ongoing legal ins and outs, with some decisions being worked out.\n\nFew know that Siegel’s wife Joanne was the model for the Lois Lane character. She initially modeled for Shuster, not realizing she would become Superman’s heartthrob. Joanne and Jerry married 10 years after Superman made his debut, following Siegel’s divorce from Bella Siegel.\n\nA few years after Siegel’s death in 1996, his wife wanted to donate some of his personal papers and other items (his typewriter, glasses, and the like) to set up a permanent memorial, but no one in Cleveland was interested.\n\nSome of that material has ended up at the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage in Beachwood (a suburb of Cleveland) for the permanent Siegel and Shuster exhibit.\n\nToday there are three specific locations marking the important beginnings of Superman on Cleveland’s east side back in the late 1930s. One is the bronze-like historical marker by the clock tower on the corner of East 105th Street and St. Clair Avenue. A few blocks away is the original home of Siegel. And a bit further away is the corner property where Shuster lived.\n\nSome of the streets have also been given honorary names, with signs bearing the familiar stylized “S” insignia in a triangle.\n\nSo if you are a fan of that high-flying character who is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and who can leap buildings in a single bound (and can only be brought down by a little kryptonite), then you might enjoy self-touring the tight-knitted area where Superman first made his appearance.\n\nHowever, The Man of Steel had a redo by DC Comics in 1986. Gone are\n\nthe iconic red shorts, the flowing red cape, the familiar S on his barrel chest, and the clean, muscular lines of the superhero.\n\nThe “new” Superman “uniform” has been overhauled to a more modern and futuristic form in an attempt to re-capture a new generation of fans. His new appearance is akin to the characters of computer action games. Whether or not the regenerated Superman catches on remains to be seen.\n\nSo here’s what to look for Superman fans. . . . . .\n\nHISTORICAL PLAQUE\n\nA large, two-sided Ohio Historical Marker honoring the Superman creators is in front of a small clock tower on the northeast corner of a busy intersection. It was set in place in 2003, on the 65th anniversary of the 1938 release of the fabled comic book featuring the initial appearance of Superman.\n\nCommissioned by the Ohio Historical Society, the $2,500 marker was sawed off its post and stolen but was returned by the thieves three weeks later undamaged. Bronze in appearance, the plaque is actually aluminum.\n\nOddly enough, Siegel’s name is misspelled on one side of the plaque.\n\nSUPERMAN HOUSE\n\nSuperman co-creator Jerry Siegel grew up in a home off East 105th Street in what is called the Glenville neighborhood (or area) on Cleveland’s east side. Today a private residence lived in by a quiet couple for more than 25 years, the home has been restored and refurbished by the Siegel and Shuster Society, which has the first right of refusal when the house might go on the market.\n\nAt one time painted in the Superman colors, today the home is a more traditional color scheme. However, there is the familiar Superman “S” shield on one side of the front fence, and a triangular marker on the other side. These plaques were sponsored by the Siegel and Shuster Society.\n\nIt was in a second-floor bedroom of this house that the co-creators wrote and drew their Superman character.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, there was a grand ribbon-cutting to mark the completed restoration of the home. While sparsely attended, plus a rain-soaked day, Siegel’s widow and daughter were on the front porch for the ceremonies.\n\nWHERE SHUSTER LIVED\n\nA dozen blocks away, at the end of Amor Avenue where it meets Parkwood Drive is the site of what once was an apartment building where Shuster lived (he died in 1992). The corner property is now a private home and is surrounded by a wooden fence. Panels from the first Superman comic book are on the fence facing the sidewalk.\n\nAnd that first Action Comics No. 1 fetched a stunning $1 million not too long ago. It is considered the Holy Grail of comic books and was sold from a private seller to a private buyer, neither of whom released their names. Oh, it originally cost just 10 cents — a mere dime.\n\nSo if you are a fan, you can add to your enthusiasm, and perhaps get a bit more inspiration at all three locations on Cleveland’s east side. And who knows what might happen. . . . . . “Look! Up in the air. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. It’s S-U-P-E-R-M-A-N !!!”\n\nWHERE TO SEE, AND MORE TO KNOW. . . .\n\nThe Superman historical marker is at the northeast corner of East 105th Street and St. Clair Avenue, not far from the Lakeland Freeway (Route 2), on Cleveland’s east side in what is called the Glenville area. Be sure to read both sides of the plaque, and see if you can find Siegel’s misspelled last name (hint: it’s on the continued, second side). Siegel’s original home is still a private residence, although it is easy to spot at 10622 Kimberly Avenue (Jerry Siegel Lane), off East 105th Street, just three blocks from the historical marker. Shuster’s original home in an apartment is gone, and a private residence is there now at the corner of Amor Avenue (Joe Shuster Lane) and Parkwood Drive (Lois Lane). You are welcomed to stop and read the comic book panels.\n\nExcellent background material and information are available by reaching out to the Siegel and Shuster Society’s website at: siegelandshustersociety.org.\n\nSpecial to OhioTraveler.com by Tom And Joanne O’toole, Travel Journalists\n\nTom and Joanne O’Toole are full-time freelance travel journalists and photographers.

However, by February, even I’m tired of hibernating. Snow or no snow, I need to get out! Often, I kill two birds with one stone by visiting the Wood County District Public Library, spending hours reading by the fireplace, chatting with friends, and going online. I love it there!\n\nHowever, there are many other libraries in Ohio worth a visit, some tucked away in places you might not think to look, including public gardens, museums, professional organizations, and universities. Specialty libraries usually welcome visitors and allow collection use during visiting hours. Some also allow borrowing, although a membership or borrower’s card may be required first. One warning: be sure to call about policies, visiting hours, admission fees, and material availability before you visit; the current economic crisis is forcing a lot of changes.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Warren H. Corning Library, a breath of spring located at Kirtland’s Holden Arboretum. Planning future gardens here is a perfect antidote to snow! Only members can check books out, but the public is welcome whenever the library’s open. (The rare book room isn’t open to the public, but the curator might let you take a peek.)\n\nLook for the free landscape bulletins, too, which offer helpful gardening information. Need some fresh air? The Arboretum has great hiking and cross-country ski trails –borrow a field guide and see how many animal tracks you can identify!\n\nIf there’s a child in the house, a trip to the Toledo-Lucas County Public Library is a nice diversion. The main branch has a really fun children’s section that can keep kids busy for hours, complete with characters from favorite stories and a huge children’s magazine section. They also have a nice eatery and gift shop.\n\nThen there’s the Sanger Branch Library in Sylvania, home of a reading room filled with larger-than-life scenes from author/illustrator Denise Fleming’s picture books. (Interesting trivia: Fleming got her first library card as a child at the original Sanger.) A peek-a-boo brick wall, a tree twinkling with fireflies, a fish pond – kids can spend hours here finding favorite book scenes.\n\nTake heart. Winter won’t last forever. Spring is on its way. When it finally arrives, a trip to the Bainbridge Library herb garden (the brainchild of gardening enthusiast Kathy Catani) will banish the rest of your winter wearies.\n\n“My daughter worked at the library [in 1988-1989],” says Kathy, “and whenever I’d … pick her up, I’d look at that piece of ground and think what a perfect place it would be for a garden. I finally put an article in the paper asking if anybody would be interested in helping me start an herb garden there, and I got a great response.”\n\nThese eager responders eventually formed the Chagrin Valley Herb Society, which is still involved in caring for the garden and holding meetings and programs in the library.\n\nThe garden, divided into smaller gardens (such as a culinary garden, a potpourri garden, a butterfly garden, and a medicinal garden), includes two wheelchair-accessible fragrance gardens in raised beds labeled in Braille. Personal tours can be arranged through the library.\n\nMany Ohio public libraries offer more than just reading material to their patrons. Here’s a sample of unusual items available with a library card.\n\nCake pans of various shapes and sizes [Reed Memorial Library – Ravenna; J.R. Clarke Public Library – Covington; Hubbard Public Library]\n\nToys, puppets, puzzles, and games [too many to list]\n\nOriginal art and art prints [Norwalk Public Library; Wayne County Public Library – Wooster]\n\nWoodworking and crafts patterns and blueprints [Lorain Public Library]\n\nPolaroid cameras [Milton-Union Public Library – West Milton]\n\nMicroscope [Wornstaff Public Library – Ashley]\n\nVideo games [Morley Library – Painesville; Hubbard Public Library]\n\n10’ x 10’ gazebo with netting; live animal traps; sewing machine; telescopes [Canal Fulton Public Library]\n\nThere are too many great Ohio libraries to list them all; below are a few more you can investigate on your own, plus the contact information for all the places mentioned in the main article above.
