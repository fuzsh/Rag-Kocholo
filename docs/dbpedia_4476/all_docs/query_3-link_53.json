        "text": "Washington DC is full of sights, from attractions, museums, memorials, and monuments that you can’t miss.\n\nBut unless you’re planning on moving here, it’ll take much too long to do and see it all while you’re here (if you also want to sleep). So to help you narrow down your wishlist, these are 15 sights you should include in your trip and how to most efficiently visit them. We cover all these on our fully guided Washington DC Tours! Join us today!\n\nPolitical Places\n\n1. The White House\n\nThis may very well be the most famous political site: the official residenceof the President of the United States. The White House Visitor Centerhas interactive exhibits and includes furniture of past presidentsand videos with insights about the presidents.\n\nTo take a free self-guided tour of the White House, requests must be submitted to your Member of Congress between three months to 21 daysin advance. Foreign citizens should contact their embassy in DC.\n\nBook the Discover DC Day Tour, DC Highlights, Best of DC VIP Tour, DCat Night, Arlington Cemetery Tour, or our seasonal Cherry Blossom Festival Tour to see the White House from the outside. Our Glass-Top/Open-Top Convertible Bus Tour also goes by the White House! Please make sureto check out the rest of our popular Washington, DC Tours as you set outto visit the U.S. capital!\n\n2. The Capitol and Capitol Hill\n\nThe US Capitol is the seat of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the building can be seen from afar, thanks to its impressive dome. To see the Senate or House in session, US citizens can contact their Senator or Representative for a pass, foreign visitors should arrange visits through the visitor center.\n\nAdmire the Capitol from outside with our Best of DC VIP Tour, Discover DC Day Tour, DC Highlights, Open Top Convertible Bus Tour, DC Night Tour, and African American History tours.\n\n3. National Archives\n\nThe National Archives is where important documents are held, such\n\nas treaties, proclamations, and other historically significant American artifacts. This is where the original copies of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are kept and displayed. Admission to the National Archives is free and reservations are not required. Our Best of DC VIP Tour includes priority entrance into the National Archives building.\n\n4. The Supreme Court\n\nThis is my personal favorite: you can watch the Supreme Court in session! Oral arguments are open to the public and free to attend (on a first-come-first-serve basis). All you have to do is make sure the Court is in session and show up early enough.\n\nHistorical and Cultural Hotspots\n\n5. National Mall\n\nNo, the National Mall is not a big shopping center: It’s a large park containing numerous museums and monuments. And with over 24 million visitors every year, the National Mall is one of the capital’s most important highlights.\n\nThe National Mall is situated between the Capitol and Lincoln Memorial, and it’s a popular location for exercising, concerts, festivals, and protests—the most famous protest probably being the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his I Have a Dream speech. Thanks to the numerous monuments, memorials, and museums honoring the legacy and history of the United States, you’re at the right place for your dose of culture and history.\n\nYou could probably spend a couple of weeks at the park if you wanted to see everything. Some of the most important sights are:\n\nWashington Monument\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nNational Gallery of Art\n\nUnited States Botanic Garden\n\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nLincoln Memorial\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Memorial\n\nVietnam Veterans Memorial\n\nU.S. Navy Memorial (Plaza)\n\nKorean War Memorial\n\nWorld War II Memorial\n\nThomas Jefferson Memorial\n\nMost guided DC tours visit the National Mall, including the African American History Tour, DC Highlights Tour, Best of DC VIP Tour, National Cherry Blossom Festival, Open Top Convertible Bus Tour, and the Women in Military Tour. I also recommend visiting the National Mall when it’s dark! It’s less crowded and the lights make it a magical experience. Join the guided night bus tour to see it for yourself.\n\n6. Arlington National Cemetery\n\nThe main attraction in Virginia’s Arlington is the Arlington National Cemetery. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a very emotional place to visit. Witness the Changing of the Guards at the cemetery, every half hour from April through September and every hour from October to March. Don’t miss a thing with this fully guided walking tour of Arlington Cemetery.\n\nSee the city\n\n7. Potomac River Cruise\n\nD.C. is a waterfront city, and river(side) activities are popular during the warmer days of the year. Walk along the Potomac’s riverside in Georgetown and check out the neighborhood’s views and events while you’re there. Book our Best of DC – VIP Tour, which includes a Potomac Riverboat cruise (seasonal: Apr 1 to Oct 15) to see a whole different side of the city. Enjoy water activities like kayaking or stand-up paddling.\n\nOther waterside activities in DC include the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, which runs along both sides of the Anacostia River and has undergone significant upgrades, and the Wharf’s Recreation Pier, a lovely place to lounge and admire the breathtaking views.\n\n8. Cherry Blossom Festival\n\nOne of the biggest attractions in spring: DC’s cherry blossoms! Welcome the long-awaited warmth of spring with us with our National Cherry Blossoms Festival tour.\n\nThe festival happens from the end of March until early to mid-April. The National Park Service (NPS) predicts the peak bloom every year, which typically falls around the second half of March.\n\n9. DC’s Holiday Lights\n\nLooking for that holiday atmosphere? Throughout the city, businesses have holiday displays and some residential streets are breathtaking. A local favorite is the Parade of Lighted Boats on the Potomac River. The Southwest Waterfront also has live music, hot chocolate, Christmas tree lighting, and more.\n\nOur Holiday Lights Tour shows you the best lights and some of the sights mentioned above, including the U.S. Capitol, the White House, and the National Mall.\n\nDay Trips from Washington, DC\n\n10. Old Town Alexandria & Mount Vernon\n\nDiscover the colonial streets of Old Town Alexandria, George Washington’s hometown. It’s one of the oldest historic districts in America and you’ll be able to discover its many restaurants and bistros on King Street, as well as the Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum, the Torpedo Factory Art Center, and the Gadsby’s Tavern Museum. Our Old Town Alexandria tour includes a walking tour of the historic Mount Vernon Estate—from the mansion’s interior to the President’s beloved gardens.\n\n11. Colonial Williamsburg\n\nJamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, Virginia are living representations of Colonial America. Together, these towns form the Historic Triangle, scenically connected by the 23-mile Colonial Parkway.\n\nObserve the remnants of Fort James as you journey through Historic Jamestown, walk through the world’s largest living history museum in Williamsburg as costumed reenactors bring the revolutionary town to life, and observe the battlefield where General George Washington led the Continental Army to defeat British General Cornwallis and his troops during the Revolutionary War in Yorktown.\n\nOur Colonial Williamsburg Private Tour will pick you up and drop you off right at your accommodation.

Our expertly guided private tour includes a delicious meal at Dobbin House Tavern or General Pickett’s Buffet.\n\n13. Historical Winery Tour and Tasting\n\nEmbark on a captivating journey through the enchanting landscapes and historic towns of Loudoun County, Virginia – home to DC’s renowned Wine Country. Join us for an exhilarating 5.5-hour escapade, where you’ll explore two intimate, family-owned wineries nestled amidst the lush vineyards of Northern Virginia.\n\n14. Luray Caverns, Shenandoah Mountains\n\nAs the capital region transforms into a spectacular fall landscape, it’s an incredible time to head to Shenandoah National Park for some hiking and taking in that fall foliage (but honestly, it’s beautiful any time of year). Explore the caves of the Shenandoah Mountains on a day trip from Washington, D.C., and learn about natural wonders and the American Revolution. Inside the caves, ceilings can be as tall as 140 ft (43 meters)!\n\nOutside the caverns, visit the Luray Valley Museum or climb the Ropes Course and get lost in the beautiful Garden Maze, or learn geology and mining history at the Gem Sluice experience. Our guided day tour to the Luray Caverns includes lunch, free time to experience all the activities on offer, a 1-hr guided tour of the caves, and transport to and from the region.\n\nThomas Jefferson’s Monticello and Charlottesville\n\nTravel to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello; passing historic American Civil War battlegrounds as well as Quantico, Virginia – home to the FBI Academy. Explore the beautiful estate of the American Founding Father and third US president. Walk through the home skillfully designed by Jefferson himself and observe his beloved vegetable garden and enjoy the surrounding vistas. Our knowledgeable guide will tell you everything they know about Monticello and show you the best place for lunch on your private guided tour.\n\nOf course, there’s more\n\nThese are some of the most popular sights for guided tours and day trips in and around Washington, D.C.\n\nBut there’s much more. If we ever write a book, we’ll make sure to talk about those as well.\n\nFor now, some other favorites in the city are:\n\nGeorgetown (included in the Discover DC)\n\nEmbassy Row (included in the Open Top Convertible Bus Tour)\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture (included in the African American History Tour)\n\nAny of DC’s 17 Smithsonian museums and zoos, including the National Air and Space Museum (most popular), the Anacostia Community Museum, National Museum of American History (with exhibitions on more recent history).\n\nWhat’s this about guided tours?\n\nA guided tour is the most efficient way to see most (if not all) of the sights on your wishlist.
