The park is open 24 hours a day year round but if you want to see the full display, keep in mind that the fountains are typically winterized December through March. Visit the memorial at night to see it illuminated by lights from the reflection pool and pillars. If you’d rather have the place to yourself, visit in the early morning.

Along with a sketch of a man peering over a wall, the words “Kilroy was Here,” were a piece of graffiti that was circulated worldwide during the war. The words been engraved in two hidden locations within the memorial. The cartoon was said to spread hope and connection amongst American soldiers, and remains important to many who visit the memorial to search for the etching. You can find it near the Pennsylvania Pillar.
