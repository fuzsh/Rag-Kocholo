        "text": "What is ACReSAL Project Impact?\n\nACReSAL Project will help restore 1 million hectares of degraded land in the northern part of the country. This will contribute to the Federal Government of Nigeriaâ€™s objective/commitment of restoring four million hectares of degraded land set for broader landscapes restoration by 2030. The Project will also help reduce the vulnerability of millions of the extreme poor people in northern Nigeria, strengthening their own role in line with achieving environmental sustainability.\n\nWhat is the governing structure or Institutional arrangements of the ACReSAL Project at the Federal and state levels?\n\nThe Federal Steering Committee (FSC) and Federal Technical Committee (FTC) provide overall policy and technical guidance respectively. The FSC is chaired by the Minister of Environment, co-chaired by the Ministers of Agriculture and Rural Development and Water Resources, while the FTC is chaired by the Permanent Secretary of Environment with representations of Directors from Agric, Water Resources and other relevant MDAs The Federal Project Management Unit (FPMU) is responsible for the overall supervisory activities of the Project and is headed by the National Project Coordinator with support from MDAs. A State Steering Committee (SSC) and State Technical Committee (STC) also provide overall policy and technical guidance respectively. The SSC is chaired by State Commissioners for Environment, co-chaired by the commissioners of Agriculture and Water Resources, and includes Permanent Secretaries of Finance, Works, Women Affairs and other sector representatives. The STC is chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Environment and includes relevant Directors of Agriculture, Water and other sector representatives. A State Project Management Unit (SPMU) is responsible for the overall supervisory activities of the Project at the State level. The SPMU is headed by the State Project Coordinator At the community level, a Local Government Project Management Committee (LGPMC) chaired by the Director Personnel Management (DPM), supports inclusive participation and promotes local ownership of project activities\n\nWhat are the roles of partners in the project implementation ?\n\nThe role of partners is critical to promote multisectoral coordination and cooperation for building climate resilience and better management of drylands natural resources across northern Nigeria. Federal and State agencies responsible for environment, agriculture, and water management will be the lead implementing agencies, through the state project management units who are responsible for day-to-day intervention works with technical support from the World Bank and Federal Project Management Unit. The community actors/stakeholders are also critical in terms of ownership and sustainability of activities/interventions.\n\nWho are the project beneficiaries?\n\nACReSAL interventions will improve land use planning, restoration of degraded land, increase food productivity and help a wide range of communities adapt to evolving dryland conditions with an end target of 3.4 million direct project beneficiaries. ACReSAL will specifically target the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities. Importantly, farmers and host communities across the 19 participating states and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will benefit immensely from the project. This will help ensure their full participation in community level structures established or supported under the project. Government institutions at federal and state levels and other partners from governmental and nongovernmental agencies will be beneficiaries of the institutional modernization and policy support investments.\n\nGOMBE STATE ACReSAL PC HARPS ON PROPER EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Gombe ACReSAL Project Coordinator, Amb. Sani Adamu Jauro has advised the stakeholders to ensure that the expectations of the project beneficiaries are properly managed for successful implementation. This came on the heels of a review of the ACReSAL M&E manual as part of the ongoing ACReSAL workshop/clinic in Katsina state. He said, to mitigate [â€¦]\n\nLearn More"
