        "text": "Gombe, town and traditional emirate, central Gombe state, northeastern Nigeria. Gombe emirate was founded in 1804 by Buba Yero (Abubakar), a follower of the Muslim Fulani leader Usman dan Fodio. The emirate headquarters of Gambe was established about 1824 and renamed Gombe Aba (“Old Gombe”) in 1841. The emirate prospered until the 1880s, when religious warfare and the encroachment of British colonial rule brought severe disruption to the area. The emirate capital was moved in 1913 to Nafada and in 1919 to Doma, which was then renamed Gombe.\n\nLying in the wooded savanna lands of the Gongola River basin, the area is mainly inhabited by the Fulani, Bolewa, Tera (Terawa), Tangale, Hausa, Kanuri, Waja (Wajawa), and Tula peoples. Important market centres in addition to Gombe town include Kumo, Deba Habe, Pindiga, Dukku, and Nafada. The multipurpose Dadin Kowa Dam is on the nearby Gongola River."
