        "text": "Gombe State is located in North-Eastern Nigeria. Gombe State was formed in 1996. According to 2006 population census, Gombe State recorded a population count of about 2.5 million, making it rank as the 32nd most populous state in the country out of the 36 states.\n\nThe state is within the tropical West Sudanian savanna ecoregion. Important geographic features include Gongola River, which flows through Gombe's north and east into Lake Dadin Kowa, and part of the Muri Mountains, a small range in the state's far south. Among the state's fauna are a number of snake species including carpet viper, puff adder, and Egyptian cobra populations along with hippopotamus, Senegal parrot, and grey-headed kingfisher populations.\n\nThe state is predominantly populated by the Fulanis: the Fulani tribe dominates about 6 out of 11 local governments in the state. The Fulani people live primarily in the north and centre of the state along with the Bolewa, Kanuri, and Hausa peoples while the state's diverse eastern and southern regions are populated by the Cham, Dadiya, Jara, Kamo, Pero, Tangale, Tera, and Waja peoples. Religiously, the majority of the state's population (~75%) are Muslim with Christian and traditionalist minorities at about 20% and 5%, respectively.\n\nEconomically, Gombe State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of sorghum, groundnuts, millet, tomatoes, and yams crops. Other key industries are services, especially in the city of Gombe, and the livestock herding of camels, cattle, goats, and sheep."
