        "text": "The Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, has urged state directors of the Department of State Services, North-East, to focus on unearthing perpetrators of crimes and their sponsors in the region.\n\nYahaya, who Deputy Governor Dr Manassah Jatau represented, gave this advice on Wednesday at the 16th quarterly regional conference of the directors.\n\nPUNCH Online notes that the participants include directors of Bauchi, Yobe, Borno, Taraba and Adamawa states.\n\nYahaya said, “As you consider new numerous emerging challenges that may occur different nature issue like minimum wage, increasing poverty and visible hunger in the land, flooding, cyber crime, ‘wild’ social media, criminal vehicle operators, misuse of positions by government officials or politicians in addition to your regular menu of banditry, kidnapping, terrorism, farmer/herders’ clashes, cattle rustling all efforts must be done to identify the sources of undesirable activities.\n\n“Our present efforts that result into the apprehending the messengers, rather than those sending the message remain a big challenge, that must be overcome, individually and collectively as security agencies.\n\n“As you spend three days discussing your mandate, I urge you to protect and defend the\n\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, from threats of enemies and those who do not want the prosperity of our nation.”\n\nWhile commending the directors for their efforts in entrenching peace and unity in the region and country, Yahaya said they were not oblivious to the challenges each of the commands faced adding “My dear SDSES, I am not unaware of the lack of adequate logistics, capacity building, resources, unpatriotic citizens, (who have made money the goal of all social action) and other issues that are bottlenecks as you discharge your duties. Similarly, let me pinpoint that all organisations face challenges. The ability to overcome the challenges differentiates effective leaders from the non-effective ones.”\n\nHe noted that at the end of the conference, decisions, resolutions, recommendations and actions should manifest relevant, responsive, receptive, resilient and adaptive features of modern effective organisations.\n\nHe added, “Be assured of the support of the government as your organisation and indeed other Law Enforcement Agents carry out the mandate of ensuring security in the state. I wish to commend this very cordial working relationship that exists among all the Law Enforcement Agents in the state. Please keep it up, as we have seen the excellent results.”\n\nIn his welcome address, State Director of Security Gombe State, Habu Sambo, who doubles as Chairman of the SDSES, North-East zone, said the quarterly is expected to yield ideas from stakeholders towards curbing insecurity in the region.\n\nSambo said, “This gathering of minds and expertise is a significant step towards addressing our region’s various security challenges. We must come together as a collective force to strategize, collaborate, and find sustainable solutions to these pressing issues.”\n\nSpeaking further Sambo urged participants to tap the rewards of the conference to improve service delivery.\n\nHe added, “This conference provides us with a platform to fertilise ideas, share experiences of best practices, and forge partnerships that will help us in our collective efforts to ensure the safety and security of our communities. It is through collaboration and cooperation that we can effectively combat the threats that face us.\n\n“I urge all of you to actively participate in the discussions, engage with one another, and contribute your expertise and insights towards finding lasting solutions to the security challenges in our region.”"
