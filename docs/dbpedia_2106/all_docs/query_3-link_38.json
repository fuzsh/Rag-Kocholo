        "text": "The Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe a 500 bed-capacity hospital is located within the city of Gombe, the capital of Gombe State which is one of the 36 States of the Federation. It is located between latitude 100 & 110N within the savannah region. It has a population of about 2.1million people and an area of 18000km2. The temperature averages 30oC with an annual rainfall of 52cm.\n\nThe Hospital was established in 1996 by the Federal Government, but moved its operations to the present site on 22nd May 2000. It was built by the former Bauchi State Government through a loan obtained from the African Development Bank (ADB) to serve as a tertiary referral centre undertaking service, research and training for the then former state. When Gombe State was created, it inherited the hospital and when the Federal Government decided to establish Medical Centres in states that do not have a teaching hospital in the country, Gombe state automatically became a beneficiary. Consequently, the hospital was transferred to Federal Government which converted it to Federal Medical Centre, in January 1999. His Excellency, The President Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, GCFR commissioned the Centre on November 23rd 2000. Dr. Abubakar Ali-Gombe was the pioneer Medical Director of the hospital followed by Dr. Aliyu Usman El-Nafaty, Dr.Saidu Abubakar, Dr.Yahaya Saidu Alkali and currently, Dr.Yusuf Mohammed Abdullahi.\n\nWith the establishment of College of Medicine by the Gombe State University, the Gombe State Government under the leadership of his Excellency Dr. Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo OON, approached the Federal Government to use the facility as a Teaching Hospital. The President and Commander-in-Chief, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan GCFR, gave approval to the request on the 16th August 2013. The hospital was then redesignated by the Honourable Minister of Health, Prof. C.O. Onyebuchi Chukwu as Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe with Dr. Sai’du Abubakar as the Chief Medical Director (CMD).\n\nPresently, the Centre has in its employment Medical Doctors, Nurses, Laboratory Scientists, Pharmacists, Physiotherapists, Radiographers and other health care professionals in various specialties. Within the short period of operation, its impact is being felt in the whole State and beyond, because of the relative accessibility of Gombe in the North-East sub-region whereby many referrals are received from the neighboring States."
