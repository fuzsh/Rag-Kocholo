        "text": "State of Nigeria\n\nState in Nigeria\n\nGombe State (Fula: Lesdi Gommbe ðž¤¤ðž¤«ðž¤´ðž¤£ðž¤­ ðž¤ºðž¤®ðž¤¥ðž¥†ðž¤¦ðž¤«;) is a state in northeastern Nigeria, bordered to the north and northeast by the states of Borno for 93 km in the vicinity of Gongola River and Lake Dadin Kowa and Yobe in the vicinity of Gongola River for 140 km, to the south by Taraba State for 58 km, to the southeast by Adamawa State for 95 km, and to the west by Bauchi State for 277 km (172 miles). Gombe is the state capital of Gombe state and it was formed from a part of Bauchi State on 1 October 1996.[5] Of the 36 states in Nigeria, Gombe is the 21st largest in area and the 32nd most populous, with an estimated population of about 3.25 million as of 2016.[6] The state bears a slogan \"Jewel in the Savannah\".[7]\n\nGeographically, the state is within the tropical West Sudanian savanna ecoregion.[8] Important geographic features include the Gongola River â€” which flows through Gombe's north and east into Lake Dadin Kowa â€” and part of the Muri Mountains, a small range in the state's far south. Among the state's nature are a number of snake species, including carpet viper, puff adder, and Egyptian cobra populations along with hippopotamus, Senegal parrot, and grey-headed kingfisher populations.[9][10]\n\nThe state is inhabited by various ethnic groups, primarily the Fulani people living in the north and center of the state, while the state's diverse eastern and southern regions are populated by the Cham, Dadiya, Jara, Kamo, Pero, Tangale, Tera, and Waja peoples. Religiously, between 65% and 70% of the state's populations are Muslim while the Christian minority comprises between 30% and 35%.[11]\n\nIn the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Gombe State was split up between various states until the early 1800s, the Fulani jihad seized much of the area and formed the Gombe Emirate under the Sokoto Caliphate. In the 1910s, British expeditions occupied the Emirate and the surrounding areas, incorporating them into the Northern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria before becoming independent as Nigeria in 1960.[12] Originally, modern-day Gombe State was a part of the post-independence Northern Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the North-Eastern State. After the North-Eastern State was split, Bauchi State was formed in 1976 alongside ten other states. Twenty years afterward, a group of LGAs in the Bauchi's west were broken off to form the new Gombe State.\n\nEconomically, Gombe State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of sorghum, maize, groundnuts, millet, beans, rice and tomatoes. Other key industries are services, especially in the city of Gombe, and the herding of camels, cattle, goats, and sheep. Gombe has the fourth lowest Human Development Index and one of the lowest GDPs in the country.[13]\n\nGombe is one of the \"friendliest\" cities in Nigeria for doing business, due to its excellent modern infrastructure, secure and stable serenity, transparency and easier accessibility of information, regulatory environment, skills and labour and economic opportunities. These earned her the World Bank's yearly appraisal, \"The Ease of Doing Business\", in 2021 and 2023.[14]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state has an area of 20,265 km2 and a population of around 2,365,000 people as of 2006.[1]\n\nIt was formed in October 1996, from part of the old Bauchi State by the Abacha military government.[15] [5]The state is located in Nigeria's Guinea savannah and Sudan savannah belts. Undulating hills, sandy rocks, and a few volcanic rocks make up the landscape. Its location in the north eastern zone, right within the expansive savannah, allows the state to share common borders with the states of Borno, Yobe, Taraba, Adamawa and Bauchi.[16]\n\nGombe has two distinct climates, the dry season (Novemberâ€“March) and the rainy season (Aprilâ€“October) with an average rainfall of 850mm.[17]\n\nLocal Government Areas\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe State consists of eleven local government areas. They are:\n\nLGA Area (km2) Census 2006\n\npopulation Administrative capital Postal\n\ncode Akko 2,627 337,853 Kumo 771 Balanga 1,626 212,549 Tallase 761 Billiri 737 202,144 Billiri 771 Dukku 3,815 207,190 Dukku 760 Funakaye 1,415 236,087 Bajoga 762 Gombe 52 268,000 Gombe (city) 760 Kaltungo 881 149,805 Kaltungo 770 Kwami 1,787 195,298 Mallam Sidi 760 Nafada 1,586 138,185 Nafada 762 Shongom 922 151,520 Boh 770 Yamaltu/Deba 2,181 355,248 Deba 761\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe State is a multi-ethnic society that consists of the majority Fulani tribe, who inhabit the northern and central parts of Gombe State. They dominate 7 out of the 11 Local Government Areas of the state. These include Dukku, Kwami, Funakaye, Nafada, Akko, Yamaltu and Gombe LGAs. Apart from the Fulani, there are also the Tangale, found in Billiri and Kaltungo areas. Other ethnicities include the Hausa, Tula, Tera (Yamaltu-Deba), Waja, Bolewa, and Kanuri, with their different cultural as well as lingual affiliations.[18]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\n65-70% Muslim, 30-35% Christian, including the Anglican Diocese of Gombe (1999) led by Bishop Cletus Tambari (2020), within the Province of Jos of the Church of Nigeria. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bauchi (1996) includes Gombe with 92,620 followers in 28 parishes under Bishop Hilary Nanman Dachelem (as at 2017).\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state government is led by a democratically elected governor who works closely with members of the state's house of assembly.[19]\n\nThe capital city of the state is Gombe.[20]\n\nThe electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the state local government areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.[19]\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguages of Gombe State, listed by LGA:[21]\n\nLGA Languages Akko Fulani, Jukun, Tangale Balanga Bangwinji, CentÃºÃºm, Dadiya, Dera, Dikaka, Dza, Kyak, Longuda, Moo, Tangale, Tso, Waja Billiri Tangale Dukku Fulani, Bolewa Funakaye Fulani Kaltungo Awak, Tangale, Tula, Kamo, Yuwar, Cham Kwami Fulani, Kanuri Nafada Fulani, Bolewa Shongom Tangale, Kushi, Moo, Loo, Wurkun, Pipero Yamaltu-Deba Fulani, (katsinawa), Tera\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state is headed by the Executive Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya and also has 24 State House Assembly members. Gombe has 11 local government areas and 14 emirates/chiefdoms. It has three Senators and six Members in the National Assembly.[18]\n\nGovernors\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a list of administrators and governors of Gombe State.\n\nName Title Took office Left office Party Group Captain Joseph Orji Administrator 7 October 1996 Aug 1998 Military Abubakar Habu Hashidu Governor 29 May 1999 29 May 2003 APP Mohammed Danjuma Goje Governor 29 May 2003 May 2011 PDP Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo Governor May 2011 29 May 2019 PDP Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya Governor May 2019 Date APC\n\nState agencies\n\n[edit]\n\nWater Board\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe State Water Board is a state government organisation that provides water for domestic, industrial and commercial purposes. It is governed by a board of directors appointed by the state governor, with a chairman, a chief executive or chief manager, and nine other members.[22] They all serve on a part-time basis, other than the General Manager.[22]\n\nGombe Geographic Information System\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe Geographic Information System (GOGIS) is a digitalised land administrative system that carried out the process of determining, recording, disseminating information about land acquisition, ownership, its value and land management policies in Gombe State.\n\nGombe State Urban Planning and Development Authority\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe State Urban Planning and Development Authority (GOSPUDA) facilitates and enforces planning regulations for the development of the Gombe State by issuing and regulating building approval for individuals or organizations that wish to develop their land.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe dry season in Gombe is partly cloudy, and the city has year-round high temperatures. The wet season is unpleasant and overcast. The temperature rarely falls below 52 Â°F or rises over 105 Â°F throughout the year, often ranging from 57 Â°F to 100 Â°F.[23][24][25]\n\nAfforestation\n\nThe Gombe State Government has started a four million tree planting programme as part of a renewed effort to stop deforestation in the North Central Zone.\n\nIt is anticipated that the four-year plan, which would be implemented in parts, will last. The first part of the scheme has already seen the government plant 1.3 million tree saplings.[26][27][28]\n\nFlood Control\n\nAs a result of these studies, the state government has taken preventive steps to lessen the impact of the impending floods and other environmental problems that are expected to hit the state.\n\nIn order to protect people and property while minimizing the effects of upcoming weather events and their potentially fatal consequences, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya has ordered the Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources to coordinate with pertinent stakeholders and activate state emergency response and management resources.[29][30]\n\nErosion\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe State is still reeling from the devastating effects of a gully erosion that destroyed farmlands worth millions of Naira and damaged more than 200 homes. Despite state government efforts to lessen its effects, the gully erosions which particularly affected the Bogo neighborhood within the city has not been fully controlled.[31][32]\n\nAir pollution\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Gombe, the air quality is acceptable except for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution, to whom some pollutants may pose a moderate health risk.[33][34][35]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSecondary Schools.\n\nJIBWIS Islamic Science and Secondary School, Gombe.\n\nUniversities\n\nGombe State University\n\nFederal University Kashere.\n\nColleges\n\nFederal College of Education (Tech) Gombe.\n\nFederal College of Horticulture Dadin-Kowa.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal highways are:\n\nA338 north from Gombe 118 km as the Ashaka-Bajago Rd and the Tonde-Ngalda-Badejo Rd to Yobe State at Ngalda as the Jangadoli-Fuka-Ngalalda Rd, and\n\nA345 as the Bachi-Bara-Gombe Rd east from Bauchi State at Wuro Dole and south and east from Gombe as the Gombe-Yola Rd via Kumo, Kalmai, Kaltungo Boha and Bambam as the Lafia-Ture-Wuro-Biriji Rd to Adamawa State near Tiksir.\n\nOther major roads include:\n\nthe Gombe-Wuyo-Biu Rd east to Borno State near Deba Kowa, and northwest from Gombe 80 km to Dukku.\n\nRailways:\n\nThe 1067 mm Cape gauge Eastern Line east from Bauchi State via Gombe to Borno State, and the Gombe Line into downtown Gombe.\n\nAirports:\n\nGombe Lawanti International\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nGombe United F.C.\n\nDoma United F.C Savannah Tigers.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nAmina J.
