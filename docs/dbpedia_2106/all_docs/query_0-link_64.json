Neither is it news that the State is amongst the most blessed with a relatively young population. What is, however, news, is the development of the presentation of the Gombe state Development Plan, a plan that brings to the fore areas with great prospect for development for Gombe state. And the Gombe state Ministry of Finance and Economic Development is at the fore of the development stride of the government of the state.\n\nAdmittedly, some successes have been made over the years and the successive administrations have the opportunity to lead such a state as Gombe, especially on social development, while infrastructure is continually being improved through substantial public sector investment.\n\nNonetheless, since the creation of the State, there has not been any attempt to articulate a long-term economic development plan\n\nfor the State as earlier attempts at development â€“ Planning were ad-hoc, short-termed and tied to the tenures of political regimes.\n\nHowever, the current administration, led by Malam Inuwa Yahaya, understands that for development to be sustainable and political regime invariant, there is a need to develop an all-inclusive, long term Economic Development Plan for the State, owned and executed for the general interest of the current and succeeding generations of the people and governments of Gombe state.\n\nThe state now boasts of an economic plan backed up with the political will to succeed."
