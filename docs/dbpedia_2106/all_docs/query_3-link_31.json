        "text": "Several residents of Gombe, the capital city of Gombe State, have groaned over what they described as the epileptic power supply crippling businesses and causing more economic pain to the people.\n\nArewa PUNCH reports that the hardship of the residents worsened after the collapse of the four KV transmission towers on April 22.\n\nThe collapse it was learnt has exacerbated the residents’ suffering as they daily grapple with the reality of poor electricity supply.\n\nFurther checks confirmed that after about 72 hours of blackout, the Jos Electricity Distribution Company embarked on load shedding of the about 10 MW allocated by Transmission Company of Nigeria to Gombe customers and Ashaka cement company.\n\nLamenting the situation, Newspaper Vendor, Yakubu Barnabas, told our correspondent that he was pained the more because he has missed several business opportunities which should have earned him some good money due to his inability to power his GSM phone to follow up on appointments and secure fresh ones.\n\n“I have lost so much because of this outage. I barely get where to charge my phone battery whenever it drains out, and it’s risky taking your phone outside to public pay phone centres to recharge your drained out battery.’’\n\n“You don’t know who will tamper with it. This is aside the fear of the phone being stolen. Yet, in the face of these apprehensions, you are still forced to cough out so much money for the charging of your phone battery because these centres will always remind you there is fuel scarcity on the state and the current cost of petrol per litre is unaffordable.\n\n“This suffering is just too much,” he lamented.\n\nBarnabas who resides around Yalenguruza disclosed that the power situation has further worsened the hardship faced by many residents, adding, “It has further increased our pain. To get fuel without stress is to buy from the black market dealers at N1090 per litre but if you want to pass through stress, then it’s a long queue, and you will pay N800 per litre.\n\n“Either way, it’s a loss-loss situation still accompanied by suffering. Look around, people can’t cook food to last them for days again, it will go sour and money will be wasted. So, we cook less and spend more. The suffering is too much I reiterate and It’s not as if the money is coming in.”\n\nTherefore, he pleaded with President Bola Tinubu to prioritise the well-being of Nigerians in his policies, adding that it’s only those who are alive that can “benefit from the prosperity of the country. Let the President ensure that Nigerians breathe because a lot of us are suffocating,” he cried aloud.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress, Gombe State chapter, Yusuf Aish, disclosed that the Doma feeder has provided power for less than two hours to customers since the partial, power supply began.\n\nHe stressed, “Doma feeder is the worst in Gombe State. In the over three weeks that the state experienced the outage, those on the feeder have not had up to two hours of electricity power. We want to see drastic changes that was why we submitted our letters to their headquarters.”\n\nFatima Musa, a restaurant operator in the metropolis, who resides in the Tumfure area noted that the power outage has worsened the water supply in the state as tanker drivers rely on electricity to pump water into their truck vehicles.\n\n“Many of us who reside around pay water tankers through our noses because they don’t have light electricity to pump water, so they resort to using diesel generators or fuel generators to supply us water. Unfortunately, almost everyone is installing solar panels but the question is at what cost?\n\n“That explains why water supply that usually costs us N4,500 now costs N6,500 at the same venue. We are really suffering.\n\n“I just hope that this light issue will be resolved soonest. I can’t cook and leave it in the fridge. The fridge has become a cupboard with a foul smell because of sour food items. We need to sue JEDC and TCN for this delay,” she decried.\n\nAlso, bemoaning the situation was the Chairman of Gombe State Network of Civil Society Organisations, Ibrahim Yusuf, who observed that scarce resources had been wasted due to the inability to get electricity restored, even as he too acknowledged that the situation was making businesses unbearable.\n\nHe stressed, “Why will JEDC commend TCN for killing the citizens? Wasting the peoples’ foodstuffs and making life more difficult for them?”\n\nWondering why the four vandalised towers have taken this long to fix, Yusuf added, “How on earth is it heard that in the year 2024, electricity tower feeders cannot be resolved within 24 and 48 hours, and they’re still saying till month end.”\n\nAlternative power supply takes centre stage\n\nA solar panel dealer, Sammy Daniels, said in the last three weeks he has sold more, adding “I don’t know if the problem should continue but the truth is I have sold more than I have ever done since my business started.”\n\nDaniels who is a Gombe-based Igbo trader disclosed that solar installation is the latest innovation to ending power issues, “I don’t know why some still find it difficult to accept that green energy is the way to go. Government should invest its resources here instead of allocating billion on megawatts we don’t see,” the trader added.\n\nTCN, Jos DisCo react\n\nMeanwhile, the Transmission Company of Nigeria has promised to conclude work on the vandalised towers by the end of May 27.\n\nAccording to a press statement signed by Ndidi Mbah, the General Manager Public Affairs, which copy was obtained by Arewa PUNCH, it stated its resolve to restore power fully, stressing that its contractors are working assiduously to erect four new transmission towers along the Jos-Gombe axis, to enable the restoration of power supply to states in the North-Eastern part of the country, following an earlier destructive attack on four transmission towers by vandals.\n\nMbah noted that the tower collapse affected Gombe, Damaturu, Maiduguri, Yola, Bauchi, and Jalingo.\n\nThe statement partly read, “Immediately after the incident however, TCN engineers worked first to redistribute available bulk supply on the Jos – Bauchi – Gombe 132kV line between Jos and Yola Discos, while work commenced immediately at reconstructing the four vandalised towers.\n\n“Presently, we are rebuilding the four towers simultaneously. Progress is evident, with one tower nearing 80 per cent completion, another at 60 per cent, a third at 30 per cent, and dismantling work finished on the fourth tower.\n\n“Additionally, tower members are being fabricated and assembled on-site to expedite construction. We are committed to a quick restoration of bulk power on the line route.\n\n“Construction work on the Jos – Gombe transmission line, taking supply up to Damaturu and environs will be completed and energised by the 20th of May, 2024, while the Damaturu – Maiduguri axis will be completed on the 27th of May, 2024.\n\n“Expectedly, bulk power transmission would be fully restored on the affected 330kV transmission line by the 27th of May, Yola and Jos DisCos would also be able to offtake and distribute optimally from TCN substations.\n\n“For now, only 38MW is wheeled to both Jos and Yola Distribution companies, with each receiving 19MW each. Efforts to take some of the available power to Jalingo were hampered by very high voltage on the line, which could cause a system disturbance.\n\n“TCN is aware of the inconveniences resulting from the current inadequate power supply through Yola and Jos DisCos to electricity customers in the affected states, and pledges to earnestly expedite work on the towers, to ensure that the towers are completed within the time frame indicated. Please bear with us.”\n\nWhen Arewa PUNCH contacted Dr Friday Adakole, Head, Corporate Communications of Jos Electricity Distribution Plc on the challenges of Gombe residents, he said reprieve will soon come to the people of Bauchi and Gombe States as efforts have been intensified towards the restoration of power supply to the areas.\n\nHe disclosed that the management on May 11, 2024, visited the location of the four vandalised towers to ascertain the degrees of reconstruction that has taken place.\n\nAdakole added that the Jos DisCo team, which visited the sites of the four vandalised towers, was led by the Chief Operating Officer, Alhaji Mamanlafia Umar, who represented the MD/CEO Engineer Abdu Bello.\n\n“Bello, at the end of the inspection visit, gave the management of the Transmission Company of Nigeria a pat on the back for working assiduously towards fixing the problems.\n\n“The MD/CEO urged the team to work towards meeting the deadline of May 27, 2024 for the completion of the repairs and restoration of normal supply to the good people of Bauchi and Gombe States, as committed to,” he added."
