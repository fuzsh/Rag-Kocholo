Yes, we have discussed certain infrastructure as it concerns my ministry to enhance their performances, and our minds are working together. The main focus of Mr. President, when it comes to road infrastructure, is the interstate routes that are linked to security operations nationwide, the palliative jobs, and the roads that are linked to markets, industries, and factories etc. And so, this is one of the mandates that Mr. President has given to us. And so, we are going to hasten this mandate and to ensure that the desire of Mr. President, as far as road infrastructure is concerned, is achieved\"\n\n\"Road is everything. If you improve the roads, you have improved security, agriculture, education, and commerce, and you have improved the happiness of people. And this is just what Mr. President is doing. We have started to be in the field to repair over 320 roads that Mr. President directed us to do.\"\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the visiting team, the Chief of Army Staff said that the essence of the meeting was to discuss with the Hon. Minister of Works elements of national power support to the military field operations with a focus on the role of infrastructural upgrade in the enhancement of military operations across the country.\n\n\"We have discussed extensively, and we are glad that the Hon. Minister of Works is disposed to some of the suggestions that we have made on the need to focus on some critical roads that will impact positively on military operations across the country. And so, the Minister of Works has made some promises, and we look forward to seeing activities of contractors and other agents focus in this direction in the field, and the military will support them going forward.
