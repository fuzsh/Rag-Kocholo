        "text": "Abstract: The 10-Year Development Plan provides the forward-looking vision for transforming Gombe into a more progressive, vibrant and inclusive society. It outlines a framework that encompasses strategic policy manoeuvres, new approaches to development and the aspirations of all Gombe people. The Plan consists of two approaches designated as: Inclusive Socio-economic Development and Transformational Strategic Thrusts. These prongs are mutually inclusive and reinforcing. Inclusive Socio-economic Development will ensure that all socio-economic rights of the people of Gombe are achieved. Inclusivity will be at the centre of growth and development, and the benefits of prosperity will be spread as widely as possible to improve the social well-being of Gombe people. No one will be left behind regardless of geographical location, gender, ethnicity, physical and intellectual capability and social and economic status."
