        "text": "On 6 june 2024, a Nigerian delegation led by Gombe State Governor, H.E Mr. Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, met with the Secretary General of UCLG Africa, Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, at the organization’s headquarters in Rabat.\n\nGombe Governor emphasized his administration’s commitment to empowering local governments as a cornerstone of his developmental agenda, saying the success of his programmes hinges on the robust functioning of local administrations, which are closest to the people.\n\n“In Gombe State, we recognize that local governments are pivotal in delivering essential services and promoting grassroots development. Since 2019 when we took over, my administration has been resolute in ensuring that the local governments operate with the autonomy required to address local needs effectively.”, Governor Inuwa stated, adding that working with UCLG Africa “marks a significant step towards actualizing our vision of progressive, responsive, and accountable local governance”.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Secretary General made a presentation on the history of UCLG Africa, its vision, objectives, structure and governing bodies. Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi recalled that the organization was founded in 2005 in the City of Tshwane (South Africa), as a result of the unification of three continental groups of local governments, namely the African Union of Local Authorities (AULA); the Union des Villes Africaines (UVA); and the Africa Chapter of the Unao dos Ciudades y Capitaes Lusofono Africana, (UCCL AFRICA), stating that Nigeria, it’s local governments and States, including Gombe, have played an important role in sealing the unity of UCLG Africa.\n\nThe Secretary General also presented the organization’s triennial flagship event and biggest gathering of Local Africa, the “Africities Summit”, whose 10th edition is scheduled for 1-5th December 2025 in Cairo. The delegation was invited to be fully part the next Africities and to solidify their presence within the organization, as Nigerian States and local governments can significantly strengthen the voice of African regional and local governments.\n\nMr. Barr. Sani Ahmad Haruna, Chairman of Gombe Local Government and the State chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), affirmed the commitment of Gombe State local governments to adhering to UCLG Africa, with a view to unlocking a range of support and resources, including capacity-building and technical assistance.\n\nThe Gombe State delegation was informed on the UCLG Africa networks, it’s various programmes and projects, including the African Local Governments’ Academy (ALGA) online learning platform (e-Academy) and capacity-building programmes, in particular the Executive Master’s in Management of African Cities which targets local governments and whose 2nd edition was launched in Al Akhawayn University (Ifrane, Morocco), in June 2024, for twenty-six (26) English-speaking beneficiaries from eleven (11) African countries. These participants benefit from scholarships from the African Support Fund for International Decentralized Cooperation (FACDI) set up by the Kingdom of Morocco through the Ministry of Interior, Directorate General of Territorial Authorities (DGCT).\n\nThe FACDI issues annually calls supported for decentralized cooperation projects between African local governments and their counterparts in Morocco. UCLG Africa is instrumental in building and accompanying these partnerships. An example of such partnerships is the one linking the City of Shomolu-Bariga in Lagos State (Nigeria) and the Provincial Council of Tiznit (Morocco) for the promotion of social, inclusive and resilient governance through solidarity tourism, culture and heritage and income-generating activities empowering youth and women. The Secretary General Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi stated that UCLG Africa is ready to develop such links between Nigerian States, like Gombe, and Moroccan regions. He also proposed to the Governor of Gombe State to be the mouthpiece of UCLG Africa to humbly request that the Federal Government of Nigeria also establish a Fund similar to FACDI to support and boost the development of South-South pan African cooperation among Subnational and Local governments of Africa, thus contributing to the emergence of Africa of the Peoples beyond the Africa of Nations-States.\n\nThe Gombe State delegation also learned about the capacity-building programme for Chief Financial Officers of African cities in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), to prepare African cities and territories, who are members of the Africa Territorial Trade and Investment Agency (ATIA), to accessing capital markets. ATIA is a special purpose vehicle aimed at enhancing the investment capacity of African cities and subnational governments through bond issuance on the capital market.\n\nAs delivery partner of the Green Climate Fund, UCLG Africa can be a regional gateway for African subnational and local governments including State governments of Nigeria, to access climate finance.\n\nUCLG Africa is also advocating for the promotion of culture as the 4th pillar of sustainable development,. To that effect UCLG Africa has launched the celebration of the African Capital of Culture. Rabat has been the first African Capital of Culture for the years 2023 and 2024. Brazzaville (Congo) and Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo) were jointly designated the second African Capital of Culture for 2024 and 2025. The Secretary General UCLG Africa suggested that Nigeria consider bidding for the third African Capital of Culture for 2026 and 2027, the call for candidates to be issued at the end of 2024."
