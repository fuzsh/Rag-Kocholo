        "text": "Residents of the ancient city of Gombe State are battling acute water scarcity amid intense heat waves.\n\nWith temperature reaching a scorching 40 degrees celsius, residents of the state are struggling under the hot sun.\n\nSome of the mostly affected communities include Akko, Wuro Bogga, Garin Baraya, Malam Jamo, Gamadadi, Konkeje And Tongo, Lawanti, Jalingo, Dunomari, Boggage and Marori.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that in 2021, the federal government through the Upper Benue River Basin Development Agency (UBRBDA) had awarded the contract for the âextension of water pipeline and reticulation at Shongo Sarkin Yaki in Gombe North Senatorial Districtâ.\n\nThe project was under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, (FMWR).\n\nFindings by DAILY POST showed that soon after the contractor was mobilised and heavy equipment moved to the site, the project was abandoned.\n\nAccording to sources within the community, the contractor gave no cogent reason for abandoning the project site.\n\nIn 2016, the Federal Ministry of Water Resources budgeted over N500m for the Dukku regional water supply.\n\nEighth years down the line and after payment of over N350m, the benefiting community is yet to experience the joy of seeing drops of water from the project.\n\nThe failure of the Dukku regional water supply project, despite consuming nearly N400 million, serves as a stark reminder of systemic challenges plaguing water infrastructure development in the region.\n\nFor residents like Mustafa Isa and Malam Yakubu Muhammad, the scarcity of water is not merely an inconvenience but a life-challenging situation.\n\nWith households forced to spend exorbitant sums on purchasing water or resorting to laborious journeys to distant sources, the economic burden weighs heavily on already stretched communities.\n\nDAILY POST learnt that in the 2015 fiscal year, the Governor Ibrahim Dankwambo government budgeted N3.7 billion for water.\n\nIn the year that followed, the government spent yet another whooping N2.6 billion for the same purpose.\n\nBut despite such a huge spending, Gombe State capital is still facing an acute shortage of water.\n\nThe multibillion Gombe State water scheme that pumps distilled water from Dadin-Kowa dam to the state capital, has been reported to have broken down due to lack of funds for its maintenance.\n\nMalam Idris Abubakar, a representative of the affected communities, paints a picture of their plight.\n\n“The heat is too much, and the lack of water makes things even worse,” he told DAILY POST.\n\n“During Ramadan, the situation becomes even more dire as we struggle to find clean water to break our fasts,â he lamented.\n\nMustafa Isa, a newly married man, shares similar concerns about dealing with water scarcity every day.\n\n“I have to spend a lot of money buying water from vendors.\n\n“It’s a big issue for my family, especially when the summer heat is so intense,” he lamented.\n\nAccording to Abdul Adamu, a resident of Shongo Sarkin Yaki, a community in Kwami local government area of Gombe State, he will have to travel 40 minutes on foot to fetch water from the nearest pond.\n\nAdamu stated that his community has been struggling with decade-long water scarcity and often has to rely on contaminated water sources for drinking,\n\nMalam Yakubu Muhammad, a farmer in the dry area of Dukku, faces a constant battle to find water.\n\n“We depend on this lake for our water,” he says, adding “the water scarcity puts even more pressure on our resources.”\n\nCharles Abichele, a resident of Gombe town, who spoke with DAILY POST on phone, stated that the situation is not getting better.\n\nAbichele said that boreholes in Gombe are just a shadow of what should be, with no real sign of better moments ahead.\n\nHe said, âThe only source of clean water in the town is from rich individuals who built their own houses and dug their own water source.\n\nâWhenever they decide to give access to the public, the crowd that gathers is just overwhelming. You will think something else happened there.â\n\nMeanwhile, several efforts made by this reporter to speak with the Gombe State Commissioner for Water, Environment, and Forest Resources, Mohammed Faw were fruitless as his phone was switched off.\n\nMeanwhile, a staff of the ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, blamed the development on the refusal of residents to pay their water bills.\n\nâHow will they get water when they refuse to pay their bills? The government needs money to maintain the equipment. Ask those complaining to show you their water bills, they donât pay.\n\nâJust a few days ago, the House Committee on Water and Environment paid an oversight visit to the ongoing Gombe Regional Water Supply Scheme Project, which is at the stage of completion. The government is doing its best,â he told DAILY POST."
