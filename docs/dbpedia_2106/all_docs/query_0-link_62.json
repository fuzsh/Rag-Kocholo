        "text": "Updated with return to full operational status, removal of obsolete COVID-19 page links, and updates to Do Not Travel Areas.\n\nReconsider travel to Nigeria due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed gangs. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo Not Travel to:\n\nBorno, Yobe, Kogi, and northern Adamawa states due to terrorism and kidnapping\n\nBauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara states due to kidnapping\n\nAbia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Enugu, Imo, and Rivers states (with the exception of Port Harcourt) due to crime, kidnapping, and armed gangs.\n\nCountry Summary:\n\nViolent crime – such as armed robbery, assault, carjacking, kidnapping, hostage taking, roadside banditry, and rape – is common throughout the country. Kidnappings for ransom occur frequently, often targeting dual national citizens who have returned to Nigeria for a visit, as well as U.S. citizens with perceived wealth. Kidnapping gangs have also stopped victims on interstate roads.\n\nTerrorists continue plotting and carrying out attacks in Nigeria. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting shopping centers, malls, markets, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, bars, schools, government installations, transportation hubs, and other places where crowds gather. Terrorists are known to work with local gangs to expand their reach.\n\nThere is civil unrest and armed gangs in parts of Southern Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta and Southeast regions. Armed criminality and gangs, including kidnapping and assaults on Nigerian security services is also pervasive in this region.\n\nViolence can flare up between communities of farmers and herders in rural areas.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Nigeria due to security conditions.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Nigeria.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Nigeria:\n\nCarry proper identification, including a U.S. passport with a current Nigerian visa, if needed.\n\nUse caution when walking or driving at night.\n\nKeep a low profile.\n\nReview travel routes and times to vary your predictability.\n\nDo not physically resist any robbery attempt.\n\nBe extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.\n\nMonitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\nStay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and large political gatherings.\n\nReview your personal security plans.\n\nHave evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n\nEstablish a “proof of life” protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nObtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Nigeria.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nBorno, Yobe, Kogi, and Northern Adamawa states – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nThe security situation in these states is fluid and unpredictable due to widespread terrorist activity, inter-communal violence, and kidnapping. Security operations to counter these threats may occur without warning.\n\nTerrorist groups based in the Northeast routinely target humanitarian camps, security forces, churches, schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions, entertainment venues, and road travelers.\n\nApproximately two million Nigerians have been displaced as a result of the violence in Northeast Nigeria.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nBauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara states – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nThe security situation in these states is fluid and unpredictable due to widespread inter-communal violence and armed criminality, especially kidnapping and roadside banditry. Security operations to counter these threats may occur without warning.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nAbia, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Enugu, Imo, and Rivers states (with the exception of Port Harcourt) – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nCrime is rampant throughout Southern Nigeria, and there is a heightened risk of kidnapping, violent civil unrest, and armed gangs."
