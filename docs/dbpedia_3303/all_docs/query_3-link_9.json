        "text": "Why it matters: In Arkansas, we appreciate the values instilled in and passed down to us for generations. Those ideals – freedom, fairness, economic opportunity, individual responsibility, limited government, faith, love of country and our fundamental rights – are worth protecting and advancing.\n\nWhere I stand: I consistently champion and defend Arkansas values in the U.S. Senate, including proudly supporting pro-life policies, working to protect our Second Amendment rights, pushing for adherence to the Constitution and insisting on always upholding the rule of law. I also understand Arkansans’ prioritization of our national sovereignty, concerns regarding our nation’s broken immigration system, and desire to secure our borders and enforce existing laws. Finally, I’m proud to stand behind our military and law enforcement members as they serve and sacrifice so much in service to our nation, state and communities because Arkansans appreciate and hold them in high esteem.\n\nWhat I’ve Done: I’ve worked hard to support measures that protect and defend the values and ideals that most Arkansans cherish. In supporting a variety of legislative proposals and pushing back against over-reaching or ill-advised regulations, in addition lending my support to causes associated with these issues, I have fought on behalf of the men and women of our state and the issues they are interested in.\n\nSenator Boozman’s Work to Promote Arkansas Values\n\nProtecting Life\n\nSenator Boozman is an adamant proponent of policies to recognize the value and dignity of every human life, including babies in the womb. He is consistently recognized for his support of pro-life legislation such as the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, the Life at Conception Act, the Parental Notification and Intervention Act and others. In addition, the senator supports efforts to prohibit taxpayer funding of abortion and defund Planned Parenthood – the largest abortion provider in America – as well as preventing abortion as a basis for discrimination against babies diagnosed with conditions such as Down syndrome. He has routinely joined hundreds of Arkansans to advocate for the unborn as a participant in the annual Arkansas March for Life. Learn more about his work to protect life in the 117th Congress here.\n\nSupporting Our Second Amendment Rights\n\nThe senator understands that our founding documents specifically ensure Americans’ right to bear arms and agrees disarming law-abiding citizens is neither acceptable or a reasonable approach to addressing violent crime. He has helped introduce legislation to protect and enhance the ability to own and lawfully carry firearms, including the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Additionally, Senator Boozman has opposed efforts to undermine Americans’ Second Amendment rights including preventing the implementation of proposals to severely limit rifle ammunition primarily used for sporting purposes, blocking ratification of an international treaty that would violate the sovereignty of the United States to regulate the lawful ownership of firearms, and protecting veterans and social security recipients from being stripped of their Second Amendment rights without due process. He has also supported the Hearing Protection Act to remove suppressors from the National Firearms Act and fought against the so-called “Assault Weapons” ban.\n\nUpholding the Constitution\n\nFidelity to the U.S. Constitution is of critical importance, and Senator Boozman believes that applies across all three branches of the federal government. As a senator, he has used his ability to confirm nominees to the federal judiciary – including the Supreme Court – to support jurists and judges who understand and appreciate the original meaning of the Constitution as well as the intent of lawmakers who pass legislation and statutes as part of their designated role. With his help, the Senate advanced 234 such judicial nominees during the last administration, including three highly-qualified Supreme Court justices.\n\nSupporting our Military and Law Enforcement\n\nAs a proud member of a military family growing up, Senator Boozman understands the enormous costs endured by our service members and their families in defense of our country. Similarly, the Arkansans who work in law enforcement at every level also make tremendous sacrifices in the performance of their duties to protect and serve our communities. We have tremendous respect for and gratitude toward these heroes and their families.\n\nHe has always supported them throughout his time in Congress and will continue to do so. Through supporting National Defense Authorization Act provisions that raise service member pay and improve quality of life to visiting Arkansans on active duty throughout the U.S. and across the globe, he consistently looks for opportunities to stand with and assist the members of our Armed Forces.\n\nBoozman is also a proud ally of our police and law enforcement officers. He is a member of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus and advocated for the Protect and Serve Act to create federal penalties for individuals who knowingly cause, or attempt to cause, serious bodily injury to local, state or federal law enforcement officers. The senator supports law enforcement agencies throughout the state of Arkansas obtain federal assistance through programs like the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants through the Department of Justice, helping secure millions of dollars in federal funds to obtain tools to prevent and combat crime and keep their communities safe. These initiatives demonstrate his commitment to Arkansans who wear the badge."
