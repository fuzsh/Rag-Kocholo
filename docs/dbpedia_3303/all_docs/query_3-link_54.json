        "text": "Lawmakers recognized during organization's March for Change Advocacy Summit in Washington, DC\n\nARLINGTON, VA (March 5, 2023) — In recognition of their leadership in advancing legislation to support the health of moms and babies, March of Dimes is honoring four Congressional lawmakers with the 2024 March for Change Champion Award. The organization will pay tribute to Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and John Boozman (R-AR) and Representatives Michael Burgess (R-TX) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA) during a Capitol Hill reception taking place in conjunction with its annual March for Change Advocacy Summit, March 5-6, in Washington, DC.\n\nThe lawmakers were instrumental in spearheading the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2023, the only federal law in the US to help prevent preterm birth and its consequences. Working alongside a bipartisan coalition, they championed the bill's passage in the House of Representatives last year, setting the stage for consideration in the full Senate. In addition, these leaders have shown strong support for the Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act of 2023, which is a key piece of legislation focused on improving maternal health outcomes.\n\n“More than 380,000 babies are born before 37 weeks each year and infant mortality is on the rise, making the US one of the most dangerous places to give birth in the developed world,” said Stacey Y. Brayboy, March of Dimes Senior Vice President, Public Policy & Government Affairs. “March of Dimes applauds these Congressional leaders for advancing the PREEMIE Reauthorization and Preventing Maternal Deaths Acts. These bills and other key policies will help turn the tide on this devastating public health crisis.”\n\nThe March for Change Champion Awards celebrates the achievements of legislators of both parties who work across the aisle, as well as raises awareness about the ongoing need for policy initiatives that positively impact mom and baby health. The lawmakers will be honored at the March for Change Congressional Awards Reception on March 5, 2024 in the Congressional Visitors Center, Room HVC-200 from 5:30pm to 7:30pm.\n\n“In Colorado in 2022, one in ten babies was born preterm. This number has increased over the past several years, even though the United States spends $4.5 trillion dollars – more than 17 percent of our GDP – on health care, twice as much as any other industrialized nation,” said Senator Michael Bennet. “That is unacceptable and why I continue to fight to pass the PREEMIE Act, which will help address this disturbing trend and ensure that mothers and babies have access to the care that they need.”\n\n“I’m proud to champion initiatives that promote the health of mothers and infants,\" said Senator John Boozman. \"Alongside March of Dimes, we are advancing policies to improve pregnancy outcomes and I look forward to continuing our work together to invest further in research and resources to help save lives.”\n\n\"For almost 30 years, I served as a board-certified OB/GYN. Because of my experience as a physician, I am committed to prioritizing the well-being of American mothers and children,\" said Congressman Michael C. Burgess, MD. \"I am honored to accept the March of Dimes award. I am grateful that our PREEMIE Act passed the House of Representatives, which will decrease the preterm birth and infant mortality rates and ensure the safety of mothers and babies in the United States.\"\n\n“It’s an honor to receive the 2024 March for Change Award and I’m grateful to the March of Dimes for its extraordinary work to ensure all mothers and their babies live healthy lives,” said Congresswoman Anna Eshoo. “My legislation, the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2023, passed the House last year to improve pregnancy outcomes and infant health and I look forward to working with the March of Dimes to bring the legislation across the finish line.”\n\nDuring the two-day Summit, maternal and infant health advocates from across the country, including March of Dimes Celebrity Advocate Angelina Spicer and Mama Glow founder Latham Thomas, will take part in meetings with elected officials and their staff to advocate for critical legislation. In addition to the PREEMIE Act and Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, advocates will push for passage of the SHINE for Autumn Act, the Maternal and Child Health Stillborn Prevention Act, and funding for Maternal and Infant Health programs and research, newborn screening programs, vaccination access programs, and nutrition programs, among others.\n\nMarch of Dimes urges everyone to become a maternal and infant health advocate by joining a March for Change event in their community or by taking action through the organization’s Advocacy Network and calling on their legislators to prioritize the health of moms and babies. Advocates can urge policymakers to pass legislation that can improve maternal and infant health and create #BlanketChange. In addition to the Advocacy Summit in the nation’s capital, March of Dimes is mobilizing advocates to March for Change by taking part in advocacy events at 12 state capitals and territories, including Arizona, Alabama, California, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nFor more information about March of Dimes and to sign up for a March for Change event, visit marchofdimes.org/marchforchange.\n\nAbout March of Dimes"
