        "text": "— Gunner DeLay, a Fort Smith lawyer and former state senator, announced Wednesday that he is running for Congress in Arkansas’ 3rd District.\n\nThat makes DeLay the seventh Republican vying for the party’s nomination, including six candidates who decided to run afterU.S. Rep. John Boozman, R-Ark., announced Feb. 6 that he wasn’t seeking re-election to his 3rd District seat. Instead, Boozman isrunning for U.S. Senate.\n\n“I think this race kind of caught people by surprise,” DeLay told an audience of 17 at the Fayetteville Clarion Inn at noon. “They didn’t know there was going to be a vacancy, so it’ll be a sprint.”\n\nThe primary election is May 18.\n\nDeLay, 46, made his first campaign announcement of the day in Fort Smith at 10 a.m. He said that event drew a crowd of about 100.\n\nIn Fayetteville, DeLay praised the Tea Party movement, which opposes government spending as a way to combat the recession, and he said the country is on “a path to socialism.”\n\n“We have a government that wants to get into the automobile business, thebanking business and the health-care business,” he said.\n\nDeLay said the 3rd District needs a congressman who will not only slow government intrusion into the realm of private business but will “push back.” He said the nation’s $12.4 trillion debt could double by the end of the decade.\n\n“We don’t need more stimulus money,” DeLay said. “The stimulus money just creates temporary jobs that are here today and gone tomorrow.”\n\nDeLay said terrorists should be tried by military tribunals and kept in prisons outside the United States.\n\n“These terrorists in the Middle East are never going to like us,” he said. “They hate us and want to kill us.”\n\nDeLay said the United States needs “citizen legislators” and congressmen should be required to use Veterans Administration hospitals instead of private insurance.\n\nHe said he would support a federal balanced budget amendment. He stressed a strong national defense and securing the country’s borders.\n\nDeLay said he stands apart from the other Republicans in the race because he has a record of proven conservative practices.\n\nDeLay served in the Arkansas House of Representatives, 1995-99, and in the state Senate, 1999-2003. He also served as Sebastian County prosecutor in 2007-09.\n\nDeLay ran for the 3rd District congressional seat in 2001, losing in the Republican primary runoff election to Boozman, who got 57 percent of the vote. DeLay ran for attorney general in 2006, losing to Dustin McDaniel, a Democrat who got 58 percent of the vote.\n\nDeLay is a partner in the Fort Smith law firm of Rush, Rush & DeLay. He’s a distant cousin of former U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, whom he met at a family reunion at Beaver Lake in 1983.\n\nGunner DeLay is a Fort Smith native with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and a law degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s William H. Bowen School of Law.\n\nAfter the announcement in Fayetteville, Delay visited with voters in Springdale, Bentonville and Bella Vista before traveling to Harrison, where he repeated his campaign announcement.\n\nOther announced candidates for the Republican nomination are state Sen. Cecile Bledsoe of Rogers, retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent Steve Lowry of Fayetteville, businessman Kurt Maddox of Gravette, Boone County Judge Mike Moore, retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Bernie Skoch of Elkins and Rogers Mayor Steve Womack.\n\nDavid Whitaker, a former assistant city attorney in Fayetteville, is the only Democrat to announce for the congressional seat.\n\nFiling deadline for primary candidates is March 8."
