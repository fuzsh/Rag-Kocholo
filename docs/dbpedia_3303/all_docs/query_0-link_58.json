        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nOne of the highlights of my life was having the opportunity to attend the 61st Annual Reunion of the 11th Armored Division in Buffalo. What made it more special was being there with my grandfather to share in his history. Grandpop served in B Company of the 21st AIB. His experience in the war brought with it good and bad times. The good memories are those of the special bonds he developed with his fellow comrades. They trained, ate, slept, played, and fought together. They were like family and to this day, grandpop thinks about them- especially his comrades who were killed so far away on the far away battlefields of Belgium. I enjoyed the bond my grandfather and I shared that week and will cherish it for the rest of my life.\n\nIn memory of that special event in Buffalo, I want to share a photo I took during the Sing-Along. Included are the men of Company B, of the 21st AIB. May the memory of their sacrifices and contributions live on forever.\n\nFrom left to right: my grandmother (sitting), Gloria Hocker; Ralph Storm, Frank Hartzell, Roger Marquet (Belgian visitor who is well known throughout the ranks of the 11th for shepherding returning veterans around the battlefields they fought on nearly 60 years ago. Roger is an honorary member of the association for what he has done for the 11th Armored veterans over the years. His work is attributed to his sincere appreciation for the soldiers who liberated his country from the Nazis. He has also adopted a few graves of American soldiers buried in Henri Chapel American Cemetery in Belgium), John Fague; my grandfather, Charles Hocker; and the Captain of B Company, Elmore Fabrick. To all a special thanks for what you did. You will always be remembered."
