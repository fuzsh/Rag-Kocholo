        "text": "What happens if a University of Utah PI is also involved in a company as a founder, equity holder, etc. and wants to fund research in their university lab? Collaborations between the University of Utah and industry result in numerous advantages for both parties as well as the PIs involved, including more funding and more impactful research. Because of these advantages, the U has sought ways to facilitate these collaborations, while also being mindful of the conflict of interest and other issues that can arise.

A growing body of work shows that even as the world spends more on research, the bang for each extra buck has fallen. One explanation for this is that the way science is funded is out of date. Researchers must now contend with a daunting amount of bureaucracy. The rate at which grant applications are accepted has fallen, meaning more of them must be made. Two-fifths of a top scientist‚Äôs time is spent on things other than research, such as looking for money. One study found that researchers spent a combined 614 years applying for grants from a single funding body in Australia in 2014 alone. Risky ideas are often put aside. The current system is also monolithic. Western scientific systems are dominated by handouts of project grants and peer review. Most money flows to universities, and the academic career ladder is such that researchers face incentives to pursue incremental advances, in order to boost citations and gain tenure, rather than breakthrough work. It is time for another shake-up. A growing cadre of scientists, policymakers and philanthropists hopes to revamp science funding. In 2022 America‚Äôs chips Act reformed the National Science Foundation (nsf) to focus it more on technology. America‚Äôs famed Advanced Research Projects Agency (today called darpa)‚Äîwhich was founded in 1958 and seeded the modern internet‚Äîhas inspired copycats in Britain and Germany. Tech billionaires‚Äô plans to fund pet projects come thick and fast. On November 1st Eric Schmidt, a former boss of Google, announced he was funding a moonshot to build an ‚Äúartificial-intelligence scientist‚Äù to speed up biology‚Äù #funding #science #research\n\n\"Research is creating new knowledge,‚Äù per famous American astronaut and engineer Neil Armstrong. Cultivating research and ideas is vital for driving innovation and progress within society. Research enables us to foster essential creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking skills to address global challenges, improve quality of life, and create economic opportunities. By supporting research and nurturing innovative ideas, we can enhance Ontario‚Äôs intellectual landscape and ensure a brighter and more prosperous future for everyone. Ontario continues to be a leader in research by investing nearly $200 million over the next three years to help advance Ontario-made research and innovation at six leading research institutes. This funding will help keep ideas, expertise and intellectual property in the province and support long-term economic growth. This funding will also help these research institutes conduct outreach and provide students with experiential learning opportunities so Ontario can continue to grow its highly skilled workforce and attract more people to the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. The investment is as follows: - $144 million over two years for the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research - $36 million over three years for the Perimeter Institute - $5 million over two years for Ontario Genomics - $4 million over two years for Clinical Trials Ontario - $4 million over two years for The Fields Institute For Research In Mathematical Sciences - $3.16 million over two years for Compute Ontario\n\n\"Two-fifths of a top scientist‚Äôs time is spent on things other than research, such as looking for money.

Risky ideas are often put aside.\" This is a topic we have had a lot of discussion about recently. With REACH | Water Security we have had the privilege of long-term research funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office that has allowed us to focus on pursuing the research, and to take risks to explore opportunities to advance research impact. It isn't all research time, but also reporting and engagement activities. Funding scientists, rather than ideas, is one approach. But how do we design this to ensure we continue to advance interdisciplinary and applied science that can deliver impact? Imagine what we might achieve if even half of the 600 years in the Australian example could be redirected to engaging with research users, and communicating the value of the research. https://lnkd.in/euRjsGRF [note: paywall]\n\nüöÄ Transform your research into real-world applications!

As architects, we recognise that this ambition rests on strategic planning, robust infrastructure, and investment in both human capital and physical spaces. At the 3rd #CreatingaScientificSuperpower conference in London, Prof. Irene Tracey CBE, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, noted that universities are the \"engine room\" of research and innovation. This resonates with our experience in both HE and R&D sectors; without higher education's driving force, advancing scientific inquiry and technological breakthroughs would be challenging. The UK's strength in the humanities and social sciences further underscores the need for an interdisciplinary approach to facilitate societal acceptance and behavioural changes necessary for scientific advancements. The suggestion to grant combined authority planning power highlights the importance of cohesive governance in managing expansive projects. Streamlined decision-making can expedite development, creating an environment that supports rapid innovation. This is particularly relevant for critical sectors identified for superpower potential: biomedical sciences, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and climate and energy technologies. Each field requires advanced research facilities and collaborative spaces promoting cross-disciplinary interaction. Drawing lessons from Silicon Valley, as presented by Mark Thompson, Chief Technologist at PsiQuantum, we must address scale-up capabilities and leverage existing research clusters to build an interconnected and resilient innovation landscape. Central to this vision is creating neutral spaces where companies, researchers, and academics can collaborate seamlessly. These \"sticky\" spaces attract and retain top talent by offering environments conducive to work and enriching to personal and professional development. Dr. Richard Hutchins, MD of the Oxford to Cambridge Pan-Regional Partnership, reinforced the importance of local universities as pivotal hubs for talent growth. These institutions serve as the foundation for growing the next generation of innovators and leaders. Our role as architects is to design spaces that support and inspire academic and research communities, ensuring the physical environment is a catalyst for discovery and advancement. It was a pleasant surprise when one of our projects, ARU Peterborough, was mentioned as a successful example. As such, the #OxfordCambridgeSupercluster is not merely a geographic concentration of academic and research institutions; it is a visionary blueprint for the UK's ascent to scientific superpower status.
