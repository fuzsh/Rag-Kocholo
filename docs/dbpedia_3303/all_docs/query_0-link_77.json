        "text": "Senate Republicans have voted to block a bill that would have guaranteed access to contraceptives nationwide.\n\nThe Right to Contraception Act on Wednesday was stopped in its tracks after failing to achieve the 60 votes required for a full Senate vote, with all opposition to the legislation coming from Republicans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumerâ€”who changed his \"yes\" vote to a \"no\" in a last-second procedural move that allows the bill to be voted on again, said in a statement that \"Senate Republicans showed us who they are today.\"\n\nA total of 51 senators voted in favor of the bill, all of whom were Democrats and independents, with the exception of moderate Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThe following is a list of all 38 Republican senators who voted against the bill:\n\nJohn Barrasso of Wyoming\n\nMarsha Blackburn of Tennessee\n\nJohn Boozman of Arkansas\n\nTed Budd of North Carolina\n\nShelley Moore Capito of West Virginia\n\nBill Cassidy of Louisiana\n\nJohn Cornyn of Texas\n\nTom Cotton of Arkansas\n\nKevin Cramer of North Dakota\n\nMike Crapo of Idaho\n\nTed Cruz of Texas\n\nSteve Daines of Montana\n\nJoni Ernst of Iowa\n\nDeb Fischer of Nebraska\n\nChuck Grassley of Iowa\n\nJosh Hawley of Missouri\n\nJohn Hoeven of North Dakota\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi\n\nRon Johnson of Wisconsin\n\nJames Lankford of Oklahoma\n\nMike Lee of Utah\n\nCynthia Lummis of Wyoming\n\nRoger Marshall of Kansas\n\nMitch McConnell of Kentucky\n\nMarkwayne Mullin of Oklahoma\n\nRand Paul of Kentucky\n\nPete Ricketts of Nebraska\n\nJames Risch of Idaho\n\nMike Rounds of South Dakota\n\nMarco Rubio of Florida\n\nEric Schmitt of Missouri\n\nRick Scott of Florida\n\nTim Scott of South Carolina\n\nJohn Thune of South Dakota\n\nThom Tillis of North Carolina\n\nTommy Tuberville of Alabama\n\nRoger Wicker of Mississippi\n\nTodd Young of Indiana\n\nAnother nine Republicans joined indicted Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey in sitting out the vote: Mike Braun of Indiana, Katie Britt of Alabama, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mitt Romney of Utah, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and J.D. Vance of Ohio.\n\nRepublicans argued that the bill was a political stunt by Democrats tied to their support of abortion rights ahead of the November election, with multiple GOP senators calling the vote on Wednesday a \"show vote.\"\n\nSchumer countered that narrative in his statement, saying that it was \"not a show vote\" but had shown that Republicans are \"not willing to stand up and protect access to contraception, something 90% of Americans support.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the Republican National Committee via email on Wednesday night.\n\nCornyn, one of the \"no\" votes, argued that the bill was \"a wolf in sheep's clothing.\" The Texas Republican said in a statement that the legislation amounted to \"fearmongering,\" while also claiming that the bill would guarantee access to abortion-inducing drugs.\n\n\"Contraception is available in every state in America, and there's no legitimate effort to change that,\" Cornyn said. \"Democrats are using their powers as the majority party to engage in fearmongering to further their own political agenda.\"\n\n\"The bill before the Senate goes far beyond protecting access to contraception,\" he added. \"It would force healthcare providers to provide abortion drugs, regardless of any religious objections ... This bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing.\""
