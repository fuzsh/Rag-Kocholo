Historically and presently, immigrant communities have helped form the national identity of the U.S. The 2021 U.S. Census Bureau survey showed that nearly 14% of the total U.S. population is comprised of immigrants. Immigrant citizenship status is split, with 53% of immigrants being naturalized citizens and 47% being non-citizens (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). Most children in immigrant families live in mixed-status families, where their immigration status differs from at least one parent; neonatal nurses are likely to care for children and families impacted by immigration and immigration policies (Mercado et al., 2024). Disparities are seen in neonatal outcomes between immigrant and native-born populations.\n\nAs nurses, it is essential to recognize the critical role that healthcare access plays in the lives of immigrant families. Immigrant birth parents are more likely to experience adverse perinatal/neonatal outcomes. These can range from an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, 5-min Apgar score <7, stillbirth, and perinatal and neonatal mortality (Gutierrez & Dollar, 2023; Behboudi-Gandevani et al., 2022a; Behboudi-Gandevani et al., 2022b; Montoya-Williams, 2022). Disparities in outcomes have been linked to disparate access to healthcare. Immigrant adults are more likely to work jobs without health insurance, which can lead to entire families—both birthing parents and their children—being uninsured (Pillai, 2023). In 2022, the uninsured rate for immigrants was 30.3% vs. 7.7% for U.S.-born citizens (Drake et al., 2023). Insurance coverage can be impacted by structural barriers to public insurance programs, where 5-year eligibility waiting periods after legal residence may be mandated (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023). Familial language and literacy barriers also impact access to insurance coverage and can lead to delays in accessing medical care (Mercado et al., 2024). Both low enrollment and uptake of social service benefits among immigrants, despite eligibility, have been observed and result from the phenomenon known as the “chilling effect” of punitive immigration policies, as well as concerns about immigration status and enforcement (Watson, 2014).\n\nSurges in anti-immigration rhetoric have led to a resurgence of the chilling effect and have impacts on public health (Mercado et al., 2024). Delays to first prenatal visits and fewer prenatal visits were seen among pregnant non-native Hispanic women in Texas from 2015-2017, which coincided with spikes in anti-immigration Google search terms during the same period (Chu et al., 2019). Similarly, an increase in missed primary care appointments and emergency visits was seen among Muslim people, along with a 6.8% preterm birthrate increase after the implementation of the 2017 Muslim ban (Samuels et al., 2021; Samari et al., 2020). There were significant delays in immigrant women initiating prenatal care and enrolling in prenatal Medicaid and a significant decrease in birth weight after widely publicized restrictive and punitive immigration policies (Wang et al., 2022; Choi et al., 2023).\n\nThere is an imperative need for policy reform to improve U.S. neonatal outcomes. Adverse birth and neonatal outcomes result in high economic costs with both direct medical and long-term developmental costs, as well as indirect social consequences (Timilsina, 2023). Policy reforms aimed at improving health insurance coverage for immigrant families are essential for improving access to care and improved outcomes. Policymakers must continue to build on efforts to expand health insurance coverage by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and exploring innovative solutions to address the unique needs of immigrant populations. As neonatal nurses, it is imperative that we help improve immigrant families’ trust in healthcare systems and provide high-quality care to all families.\n\nOn an individual level, we must provide culturally competent care in the family’s preferred language via professional interpreters, bedside devices, or language-concordant clinicians and create partnerships to deliver equitable high-quality neonatal care. We must be aware of the institutional, local, regional, state, and national policies related to immigration and the immediate and long-term impacts on our infants and families. Health care institutions and systems should create or increase medical-legal partnerships to ensure access to legal support while the infant is hospitalized (Natl. Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2019). The full healthcare team should be aware of the community-based organizations and resources available in their settings for immigrant families to foster connections to services to impact neonatal long-term outcomes. Ultimately, providing high-quality healthcare to improve neonatal outcomes is an ethical imperative, and public policy should focus on improving overall health and access to healthcare for all neonates.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nWhat they are saying: Advocates, Leaders Applaud Administration’s New Action to Expand Affordable, Quality health Care Coverage to DACA Recipients WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: Advocates, Leaders Applaud Administration’s New Action to Expand Affordable, Quality Health Care Coverage to DACA Recipients | The White House\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Finalizes Policies to Increase Access to Health Coverage for DACA Recipients Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes Policies to Increase Access to Health Coverage for DACA Recipients | HHS.gov\n\nState Health Coverage for Immigrants and Implications for Health Coverage and Care State Health Coverage for Immigrants and Implications for Health Coverage and Care | KFF\n\nPublic Charge Resources Public Charge Resources | USCIS\n\nReferences:\n\nBehboudi-Gandevani, S., Bidhendi-Yarandi, R., Panahi, M.

But as healthcare workers and healthcare consumers, it is imperative we understand the financial funding landscape and how it impacts us and our patients.\n\nAll American healthcare is paid for through four main avenues: Medicare/Medicaid/Tricare, private insurance, self-pay, and charity care. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, there are 78 million children in the United States, and 35 million are covered under Medicaid. Of those, the Kaiser Family Foundation (2023) notes that at least 6 million are children with complex medical conditions. That’s good information, but how does this impact you or us on the neonatal units?\n\nWith nearly half of our patient population being served by Medicaid, we must recognize that Medicaid payment for services is less than that of self-pay and private insurance. On average, Medicaid only pays for 79% of the total cost provided per child for inpatient care (Children’s Hospital Association, 2023). That leaves a large amount for the organizations treating children to cover.\n\nAs medical research improves, so do patient outcomes. The United States now has a 50% survival rate for infants born at 24 weeks and 80%-90% for infants born at 28 weeks or greater (Kang & Cho, 2021). However, increased survival rates also mean increased risk of chronic disease and developmental delays (Kang & Cho, 2021). Recognizing that the patient population we serve today is the pediatric population of tomorrow means we need to advocate now for improved payment for pediatric patients.\n\nChildren’s hospitals make up 5% of the total hospitals in the United States, yet they provide 45% of the inpatient hospital care. Of that population, 50%-75% of the patients in any given children’s hospital are served by Medicaid (Children’s Hospital Association, 2023). It is an expensive endeavor to keep afloat, especially when changes are made to reimbursement rates or environmental factors increase or decrease hospitalization or Medicaid enrollment.\n\nIn October 2023, the Department of Defense changed its outpatient pediatric reimbursement rates for Tricare (military insurance) for specialized pediatric clinics and cancer patients to match the adult payment structure, lowering reimbursement to pediatric facilities by nearly 40% (Children’s Hospital Colorado, 2023). The result of this change in payment structure is particularly felt in children’s hospitals that serve high numbers of military families. This could lead to service closures that impact not only military families but the greater pediatric communities that, as organizations, must bundle their outpatient specialty care, causing patients and families to travel farther to receive the same care.\n\nIn the past decade, the United States has seen a decrease in pediatric beds and services. This decrease initially was attributed to the improved healthcare of children (Zdanowicz, 2023) with chronic health issues and immunization. However, the closure of beds in the post-COVID world also reflects that caring for adults is more profitable than caring for pediatric patients. Only 37% of US hospitals now offer pediatric services (Zdanowicz, 2023). With decreased reimbursement rates and patients requiring more specialized skills and procedures, it is imperative that we advocate for improved reimbursement rates for pediatric patients.\n\nPlease advocate for improved payment structures for all pediatric patients by contacting your U.S. Senators and emphasizing the importance of specialized pediatric care and an improved reimbursement structure to sustain care for all patients and families.\n\nReferences\n\nChildren’s Hospital Association.

Babies who receive breastmilk have a decreased incidence of asthma, type I diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome, decreased infections, and stomach viruses (CDC, 2023), and premature babies who receive breastmilk receive even more benefits such as better digestive, brain, and eye development (Nationwide Children’s, 2022). Despite numerous medical advances in recent years, the preterm birthrate has remained above 10% (March of Dimes, 2024), and The World Health Organization reports that each year, more than 20 million infants worldwide are born weighing less than 2.5 kg who need human milk to improve outcomes and decrease their incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (WHO, 2023).\n\nIn September of 2023, a bipartisan bill, H.R. 5486, was introduced to the House to improve access to pasteurized donor milk. This bill would provide additional funding for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to educate on the importance of donor milk and financially support increased access to donor milk. Additionally, 1 million dollars would go towards education for the public on the need for donor milk and awareness about milk banks. Education and access to support for breastfeeding would work to provide the benefits of breastmilk for more infants in the United States (Access to Donor Milk, 2023).\n\nIn recent years, there have been formula shortages and recalls and H.R. 5486 would work to provide 3 million dollars for milk banks to respond to a rapid and increased need for donor milk in such situations (Access to Donor Milk, 2023). The recent shortages have come from recalls and supply chain issues; however, the last few years have proven the uncertainty of supply for many food items. The most recent recall affected the preferred brand for WIC and disproportionately affected low-income families (Jung, J., Widmar, N., & Ellison, B., 2023). Although the government has responded in an attempt to mitigate these issues for the future, the most important intervention is to promote breastfeeding and the provision of human milk and thereby decrease reliance on formula (Jung, J., Widmar, N., & Ellison, B., 2023).\n\nWhen delivering donor milk, the safety of the milk should be paramount, and H.R. 5486 would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to draft standards for “collecting, processing, handling, transferring, and storing donor milk” (HMBANA, 2023). The Human Milk Banking Association, considered to be the experts on human milk banking, published standards for donor milk banking in 2020. Through their mission statement, they share their belief \"...in a world where all infants have access to human milk through support of breastfeeding and use of donor human milk” (HMBANA, 2020). The World Health Organization also acknowledges the importance of human milk for low birth weight infants and recommends provision of mothers' own milk or donor milk where safe and affordable milk banking can be set up (WHO, 2023). Acknowledgment by the WHO is an important milestone for spreading the message of how critical human milk is for all infants, particularly for premature infants.\n\nH.R. 5486, if passed, would be a tremendous step forward for spreading awareness and the availability of human milk for babies in our country. Consider writing your representatives today to support this bi-partisan bill, which will support our patients and families. If you are aware of a parent, family member, or friend with excess human milk, share your local donor human milk bank information for them to consider donating.\n\nReferences:\n\nAccess to Donor Milk of 2023, H.R. 5486, 118th congress.

As NICU nurses and providers, we appreciate the importance of these checkups, which are scheduled throughout the pregnancy. According to the Office of Women's Health, \"Babies of mothers who do not get prenatal care are three times more likely to have a low birth weight and five times more likely to die than those born to mothers who do get care\" (Prenatal Care | Office on Women's Health, n.d.). At prenatal visits, the doctors or midwives can screen for any pregnancy history, medical problems, and medications taken that could affect the mom or baby and address those concerns early, as well as provide advice on the pregnant parent's safety at home and work, and lifestyle behavior such as smoking or drinking, or using street drugs, or abusing prescription drugs that could lead to poorer health outcomes for the baby (March of Dimes, 2017).\n\nUnfortunately, we know how maternal deserts and access can impact pregnant parents receiving care. Areas with low or no access to maternal care affect over 5.6 million women and nearly 350,000 births across the United States (U.S.) (March of Dimes, 2024). According to the March of Dimes, in the U.S., 6.8% of infants were born to women who received late or no prenatal care. Additionally, every 1 in 7 infants born with their moms have inadequate prenatal care (March of Dimes, 2017). Similarly, 1 in 17 women in New York City received late or no prenatal care, and 14.9% of live births were from a pregnant person who received inadequate care (Distribution of Prenatal Care Adequacy Categories: New York City, 2022, n.d.). We can all appreciate advocating for access to prenatal care for all.\n\nAccording to the CDC provisional infant mortality report, infant and neonatal mortality had a 3% increase in 2022 compared to the rate in 2021 (Ely & Driscoll, 2023). Gov. Hogul of New York has proposed a bill to address the maternal and infant mortality crisis that we are facing in this nation. The proposed legislation is part of a six-point comprehensive plan that would expand the state's current paid family leave plan to include 40 hours of additional paid leave to attend prenatal visits. Montoya-Williams et al. (2020) demonstrated the positive impact of paid family leave after its enactment in California. The study showed a 12 percent decrease in infant deaths at 28 days and older after adjusting for other maternal and neonatal contributing factors (Montoya-Williams et al., 2020).\n\nPrenatal care leave would be a separate qualifying leave event under the Paid Family Leave Act. It would afford pregnant women the ability to have their medical needs met without choosing between the health of their newborn and supporting their household or taking away from their bonding time following the birth of their child. The New York State Governor hopes to raise the bar for the rest of the nation by introducing this legislation but hopes that other states will follow. New York State will be the first state to have such comprehensive leave for pregnant people if the proposal passes the state legislature. However, the District of Columbia currently offers two weeks of paid prenatal leave for pregnant people to receive medical care related to the pregnancy, including attending prenatal visits, diagnostic visits related to the pregnancy, and bedrest if ordered by the doctor (DC Office of Paid Family Leave (OPFL), Department of Employment Services (DOES), 2024).\n\nOnly 13 states and the District of Columbia offer paid family leave for qualifying events such as birth/adoption or infant bonding (State Paid Family and Medical Leave Laws, n.d.). In 2020, the Federal Employee Paid Family Leave Act (FEPLA) was passed, allowing specific categories of federal civilian employees to pay time off following the birth, adoption, or placement of a child (Paid Parental Leave for Federal Employees, n.d.). However, this benefit excludes birthing individuals in the private sector except those who may reside in the previously mentioned states. The lack of a universal paid family leave program at the federal level has made the U.S. 1 of 6 countries and the only industrialized country without a national program (Miller, 2023).\n\nHow can you get free or low-cost prenatal care? (March of Dimes, 2017)\n\nPer the March of Dimes, if you don't have health insurance or can't afford prenatal care, find out about free or low-cost prenatal care services in your community:\n\nCall (800) 311-BABY [(800) 311-2229].

(Fisher, 2023) If you’re still in search of a 2024 goal, how about trying a resolution that helps your community and local or state government? Have you thought about advocacy?\n\nAdvocacy is defined as “any action that speaks in favor of, recommends, argues for a cause, supports or defends, or pleads on behalf of others.” (Oxford, 2024) If you are motivated by what is happening in your community or state, or environmental or healthcare issues have you worried, you have already started the advocacy journey.\n\nThe 118th Congress began on January 3, 2023, and will end on January 3, 2025. This Congress is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse in history. Additionally, the number of women in Congress is at an all-time high, and the number of openly LGBTQ+ lawmakers is also on the rise. Also of note, 15% (82) are newly elected lawmakers. (Schaeffer, 2023)\n\nHow to get started. Advocacy starts with identifying a concern or cause that resonates with you and speaking out in favor of or against it. The first step to getting started is to know your representatives and senators. Some states have held special elections for newly open seats related to retirement or a change in position within the government. Search for your state representatives at house.gov and senators at senate.gov.\n\nNext steps include locating their offices or finding their contact information. You do not have to go to DC to meet them; they are back in their states almost every week and have office hours. Additionally, contact info can be found on their websites, which include email and phone numbers, and how to request an appointment at a local office. Many sites even have a contact form that makes connecting simple.\n\nNot sure what to say to your representative or senator? Start by attending a town hall meeting, or draft an email or scripted phone message. There are many resources for how to connect out there, most notably on the NANN/HPAC webpage. The best advice for your outreach is to share your personal story and concern and be specific. Congress has legislative aides and librarians who provide the facts on pending legislation and search the literature for them. We bring great value as nurses, one of the most trusted professions, by sharing our stories with the people in these roles. (ANA, 2024)\n\nMaybe there’s a particular bill or piece of pending legislature that you are concerned about? Or you might be uncertain if a law passed or who is sponsoring the bill. Search Bills in Congress - GovTrack.us is a bill tracker that also provides details on how many members of Congress have signed onto a bill and if it is bipartisan, with both Democratic and Republican parties sponsoring.\n\nCurious about Congress overall and feel like you need more information? Try perusing the wealth of information at congress.gov. Visit websites and follow your governing leaders on social media to really get to know them and what they stand for. This time next year, we will check back to see if we have persuaded you toward advocacy. We’d like to hear how you got started and about any emails, letters, or phone calls you made to start your new journey. Have questions?

Halstead, BSN RN RNC-NIC C-NNIC C-ELBW IBCLC\n\nNurses have long been at the forefront of creating a safe space for patients and families. The call to advocacy by nursing and the needs of nurses from society are clearly outlined in the American Nurses Association book, Guide to Nursing’s Social Policy Statement: Understanding the Profession from Social Contract to Social Covenant. Conversely, workplace violence against nursing and burnout is rising. The American Nurses Association reports that 84% of registered nurses are experiencing burnout while 42% of nurses believe their employer values their mental health. On a physical scale, 1 in 4 nurses report being physically assaulted in the workplace. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics finds that healthcare and social service workers are five times more likely to suffer workplace violence injury than any other worker. On a system impact level, nonfatal injuries and illnesses resulting in days off work amongst nurses increased by 291% in 2020. Both personal capacity to cope with workplace stressors and positive improvements in the healthcare system are necessary. In the United States Political realm, change is occurring on an individual and system level at varying degrees of momentum.\n\nThe Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act or Public Law 117-105, was passed on March 18, 2022. Through Public Law 117-105, The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award grant funding to support mental health and resiliency for healthcare workers. HHS is also obligated to conduct a movement to encourage healthcare workers to seek support and publicize best practices to prevent suicide and improve resiliency. In addition to campaigning, HHS must study and develop policy recommendations. The Government Accountability Office will be reporting the effects of all grants awarded for the efficacy of their interventions.\n\nDoctor Lorna Breen of New York inspired a change in law for all healthcare workers. She was an emergency physician at New York Presbyterian Hospital at the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Lorna’s dream since childhood had been to help others as an emergency physician. She was also a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a friend, a fellow healthcare worker and a human being. Dr. Lorna Breen died of suicide on April 26, 2020. She had no risk factors besides being a healthcare worker, specifically a physician. Like Lorna, nurses also share a risk factor for suicide by working in their chosen profession. Pre-pandemic data shows that nurses, specifically female nurses, are 70% more likely than female physicians to die by suicide; two times more likely than the general public.\n\nOn a system level, The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act or HR 1195 passed the House of Representatives, but did not pass the Senate before the 117th Convention of Congress adjourned. HR 1195 required the Labor Board to address workplace violence in healthcare, social sectors and other sectors. Interim guidelines would have been issued to protect workers until a final standard was issued within a defined timeline. Currently, Senator Courtney has reintroduced The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act as HR 2663 to the 118th Convention of Congress. The Bill has been referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means. S 1176, The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act was also reintroduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin and is currently referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\nAdditionally, HR 2584: The Safety from Violence for Healthcare Employees or SAVE Act was introduced by Representative Larry Bucshon on April 13, 2023. HR 2584 acknowledges the widespread problem of workplace violence preceding the COVID-19 Pandemic as early as 2011. States are and will remain responsible for prosecuting violent crimes under the proposed SAVE Act. However, the argument is made that the states would have increased leverage to protect workers against assault and intimidation with Federal Law enforcement protections and involvement. Federal involvement would allow for teamwork between Federal, State and Local Authorities to investigate and prosecute certain violent crimes. Grant money is proposed to be made available to qualifying healthcare facilities to train staff in de-escalation, specialized self-defense and/or structural protections such as panic buttons or metal detectors. The committee reviewing this Bill is the House Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nA free update on legislation to track progress on bills and an archive of current law can be found at www.congress.gov.

Other developed nations, such as New Zealand and Norway, sustain a significantly lower maternal mortality rate, reporting fewer than three per 100,000 births (OECD, 2023). In 2022, the CDC released data showing that 84% of these maternal deaths in the US are preventable (Centers for Disease Control, 2022). Amongst our nation, there stands a wide variation in maternal mortality rates, with Mississippi reporting an alarming 82.5 per 100,000 births and California reporting 9.7 per 100,000 births (Centers for Disease Control, 2023b). Along with the shocking rise in overall maternal mortality in our country, black mothers in the United States are three times more likely to die from pregnancy related issues than white mothers (Centers for Disease Control, 2023c). This alarming health disparity can be attributed to multiple factors including underlying health conditions, bias, and social determinants of health however, money and resources need to be allocated to close this gap.\n\nThe recent release of maternal mortality statistics prompted senators to introduce Senate Bill S.1606, known as Black Maternal Health Momnibus 2023 on May 15, 2023 in honor of Mother’s Day. S.1606 aims to “to end preventable maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity, and maternal health disparities in the United States” (Black Maternal Health Momnibus, 2023). The tenets of the bill work to improve the federal maternal health structure with the creation of a task force including the highest levels of government leadership to provide support to eliminate preventable maternal deaths. The 2022 Maternal Care Report from the March of Dimes reported increasing Maternal Care Deserts in the US with 6.9 million women and 500,000 births having low or no access to care in our country. Access to quality maternal care is critical for outcomes and Momnibus would aim to remove barriers to care, provide resources to patients to address basic needs such as food and housing, address environmental concerns, collaborate with healthcare organizations to improve outcomes, and address domestic abuse in pregnancy. A needed and progressive action by the bill would extend WIC benefits from 1 year to 2 years as well as recommendations of extended breastfeeding support to 2 years.\n\nHealthcare providers have the duty to create awareness, mitigate unconscious bias, and address social determinants of health to serve all patients. Under the Momnibus bill, grants would provide funds to reduce bias and racism in healthcare settings with the provision of education and care collaboratives. With the provision of resources, hospitals would be required to post mitigation strategies publically to allow the consumer to choose healthcare organizations based on the foundation of respectful maternal care. In 2021, the Association of Women’s Health and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) created a tool kit on the creation of respectful maternity care. This tool kit is a launching pad for organizations to provide respectful care to every patient. Additionally, under Momnibus, 15 million dollars of funding annually would go towards reducing maternal health disparities in veterans with the provision of enhanced maternal care coordination. Diversity in the maternal care workspace is supported via Momnibus with resources to recruit and train a diverse workforce, which is willing to practice in underserved areas. Maternal mental health is also part of this comprehensive package to ensure that the mothers’ physical and emotional needs are being met.\n\nThe MOMNIBUS bill if approved stands to change the face of maternal care by addressing social determinants of health and reducing disparities specifically for black women. Consider writing your senators or signing on to support maternal health outcomes with other organizations like March of Dimes.\n\nReferences\n\nAssociation of Women’s Health and Neonatal Nurses.

Edwards, MSN, APRN, NNP-BC\n\nThe second leading cause of infant death is preterm birth, along with low-birth-weight infants (Centers for Disease Control, 2022a). In 2021, there were 383,082 preterm births, representing 10.5% of live births (Centers for Disease Control, 2022b). The overall preterm birth grade in the United States is D+, without improvement since 2011 (March of Dimes, 2022). In fact, from 2020 to 2021, the preterm birth rate increased by 4% (Centers for Disease Control, 2022b). Certain areas of the United States, majority of southern states, have a higher incidence of preterm birth. In addition, certain racial/ethnic groups have a higher incidence of preterm birth, including Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic. The cause of preterm births is sometimes unknown or can occur due to risk factors, which includes multiple pregnancies, infections, and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, that often lead to long-term health problems, including developmental delay, chronic respiratory problems, and vision and hearing impairment. Preterm birth and the ongoing care needed impacts families emotionally and financially, with an annual societal economic cost (medical, education, and lost productivity) estimated at $25.2B (Waitzman, Jalali, & Grosse, 2021).\n\nIn 2006, Congress passed the original PREEMIE Act (P.L. 109-450), expanding research and developing an agenda aimed at reducing preterm birth and its consequences. The Act was reauthorized in 2018 (S. 3029/H.R. 6085), renewing the U.S.’s commitment to address preterm birth through federal research, promoting known interventions, and promoting community initiatives. At the end of 2023, research and programs made possible by the PREEMIE Act will be put at risk when approval for these programs ends. On May 12th, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sen. John Boozman (R-AZ), Rep. Burgess (R-TX), Rep. Eshoo (D-CA), Rep. Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Rep. Kelly (D-IL), Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-CA), and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) reintroduced the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act. Key provisions include renewal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research and programs on preterm birth, which includes improved tracking of national data; reauthorization of the Health Resources and Services (HHS) Administration activities of promoting healthy pregnancies and preventing preterm births; provide for a new study on the costs, impact of social factors, gaps in public health programs that lead to prematurity, and calls for HHS to make recommendations to prevent preterm birth; and establishment of an entity in the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate all federal activities and programs related to preterm birth, infant mortality, and other adverse birth outcomes. Supporting reauthorization will ensure that these lifesaving programs continue.\n\nNANN, NANNP (National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners, the APRN division of NANN) and HPAC (the NANN Health Policy Advocacy Committee) are urging you to contact your representatives by utilizing the March of Dimes form here: https://p2a.co/mogVH96.

PMID: 33541716.\n\nApril 2023 - Diversity in the Neonatal Nursing Workforce\n\nMichelle Ferrant, DNP, ACCNS-N, RNC-NIC, CBC, CPLC\n\nWe are currently amidst a crisis in healthcare in the United States. According to the March of Dimes (MOD) 2022 Report Card, the U.S. preterm birthrate has hit a 15-year high, earning a D+ grade (March of Dimes, 2022). The crisis expands beyond the neonatal population to maternal and neonatal deaths, also on the rise (March of Dimes, 2022). Among these statistics, the crisis is disproportionately affecting black pregnant and expecting mothers and their babies (March of Dimes, 2022). As neonatal nurses, this data concerns us and directs our attention on how to address the disparities in neonatal care.\n\nWhile there are many complex components contributing to the disparity, attention should be paid to the workforce caring for our patients. As neonatal nurses, we are the largest healthcare provider interacting and providing care for neonates. Working toward achieving racial and ethnic composition that mirrors the population we serve contributes to our workforce. According to data from the 2020 U.S. Census, 60% of the population self-identified as White/Caucasian, 12% as Black and 19% as Latinx (US Census Bureau, 2022). The proportion of birthing people is like the overall census data and has been reported as 48.5% being racial and ethnic minorities of which 14% were non-Hispanic Black women (Hamilton et al., 2022). The overall nursing workforce is 81% White/Caucasian and 7% Black according to the 2020 survey (Rosseter, 2022). A recent study on the neonatal nurse practitioner students and faculty workforce also mirrors these statistics with underrepresented minorities in discordance with the patient population (Newberry & Bell, 2023). Nearly half of our patients are racial or ethnic minorities, but most of the nurses and healthcare professionals who treat them will be white.\n\nHaving gaps this significant in the demographics of the population we serve, and clinicians providing care, can have critical consequences for both care delivery and health outcomes (Kozhimanil et al., 2021). Lack of diversity among the healthcare clinicians has been linked to worse health outcomes for underrepresented populations (Kozimanil et al., 2021). NANN’s advocacy agenda states that all infants, regardless of race, parental economic or educational status, or geographical area should receive equitable and quality healthcare (NANN, 2022). When discussing inequities in healthcare for racial and ethnic minorities, the social determinants of health are also influencing factors (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2023; Litt et al., 2020). The US history of racial segregation and subsequent neighborhood deprivation that has been associated with poor health outcomes is then further compounded when the healthcare workforce does not have adequate diversity (Litt et al., 2020).\n\nAs neonatal nurses, what can we do to address the diversity issue in our workforce? There are ways to increase the diversity of neonatal nurses at the institutional, local, state, and federal levels. In your institution, you can advocate for, if not already in place, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices and have processes in place to look at the demographics of your patient population and your clinical staff. Many academic nursing leaders are addressing diversity and instituting initiatives that foster DEI. How many of us know what our local academic institutions are doing? Collaborating with our local academic leaders to determine what, if any, actions are being taken is a step in the right direction to increasing the diversity, inclusiveness and allyship of the nursing student population that will soon be a part of our workforce. Some leading nursing schools are on the forefront of addressing student population diversity. One of the nation's largest nursing schools, Chamberlin University, has created a research-based framework to advance efforts and create a more diverse pool of students entering the profession (Davis, 2023). Nursing school diversity begins before admission; partnering with K-12 educations systems for career discussions and mentorship and including students from diverse areas that may differ from typical their typical acceptance pool can increase student diversity (Davis, 2021).\n\nOn a federal level, there have been several bills introduced that are written to address health disparities and healthcare workforce diversity. The Black Maternal Momnibus Act of 2021, which has provisions for actions to both grow and diversify the maternal health workforce, was introduced into the House and Senate, but they have stalled after being referred to their respective committees. There is also the Health Equity and Accountability Act of 2022, which also directs support of healthcare workforce diversity as well as requiring detailed reporting of demographic and health disparity data, aiding in the creation of initiatives at local levels. It also has been introduced but has not advanced since being referred to a House subcommittee and a Senate committee. Contacting your representatives is a vital and critical component to our governmental process; hearing your personal concerns and voice is how government works.\n\nEven small efforts can make an impact – recognizing the issue of diversity in our neonatal nursing workforce is the first step, and working toward a neonatal nursing workforce that reflects our patient population will result in improved neonatal outcomes.\n\nLearn More\n\nBlack Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021: H.R. 959 (2021) https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/959\n\nBlack Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021: S.346 (2021) https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/346\n\nHealth Equity and Accountability Act of 2022: H.R. 7585 (2022) https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7585\n\nHealth Equity and Accountability Act of 2022: S.4486 (2022) https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4486\n\nReferences\n\nDavis, C.

All patients and their families are unique. It is very important for us to provide non-judgmental care that is free of bias to support the families and ensure we build a trustworthy relationship. When you’re caring for someone’s baby, trust is vital throughout the process and especially when it comes to the education needed to maintain health and success after discharge. Now that the importance of a non-judgmental, trusting relationship between the nurse, patient, and family has been established, how do we get there?\n\nFirst, let’s make sure we have a good handle on a few current terms and a few outdated terms. A person’s gender or gender identity is defined as one’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither. This is how an individual perceives themself and how they refer to themself. A common misconception is to assume that the sex assigned at birth, which is usually determined by a medical professional, also determines gender identity. The announcement of the sex of an infant is based on external genitalia and that does not always align with how an individual will identify themselves throughout their life (HRC, 2023). It is important to know the difference and to respect an individual’s identity.\n\nAnother pool of terminology to be aware of surrounds pronouns. This ties into someone’s gender identity. A great way to open that conversation up is to identify your pronouns verbally or list your pronouns on your badge or in your email signature. That behavior invites others to share their pronouns as well by creating an environment of inclusion. The term “preferred pronouns” is now considered outdated as your identity is not a preference, it is a very important part of who you are. Someone does not prefer to identify as a woman, they identify as a woman. When asking someone about or addressing this topic, it is completely acceptable to just say “pronouns” (GLSEN, 2023).\n\nWhen you walk into a room or approach a bedside, especially for the first time, leave your assumptions behind. No one wants to mistakenly call a baby’s mother “grandma”, and that same awkward and potentially offensive mistake applies to assuming how someone identifies. This can feel like a minefield at times. You don’t want to say the wrong thing or assume the incorrect situation, and sometimes that leads us to silence or even offending the family after all. One great way to avoid this is to just ask. By introducing yourself in a warm and open manner, you’re opening the door for a positive interaction. Then, by asking the right questions, you’re enabling the family to self-identify and teach you about themselves. You might want to ask questions like, “How are you related to the baby?” or “How would you like to be addressed?” When you ask an open-ended question, you have opened the channels of communication for that family to tell you about themselves and what is important to them. If you have a baby that has same-sex parents, allow them to “name” themselves. In our practice you might have a patient with two mothers that want to be “Mom” and “Mommy”. You could also have two fathers that want to be “Dad” and “Papa”. In order to find out, we just have to ask.\n\nIt can also be helpful to keep yourself informed of the political climate in your region/state. There is legislation being introduced all the time that limits and expands LGBTQ+ rights. That doesn’t always inspire confidence in the system for these families. There may be a lot of apprehension about how they will be received or treated in the hospital, especially if the system has failed them before. For example, Congress recently passed the Respect for Marriage Act. This piece of legislation protects any marriage that was done in a state where it was legally certified, if another state were to make that same marriage illegal. Basically, if a same-sex couple is married in state A, and then they move to state B where same-sex marriage is made illegal, state B has to honor their marriage as legitimate (Respect for Marriage Act, 2022). Keeping yourself informed of the political climate and how it may affect your patients and their families is always a good rule of thumb.\n\nAs a profession we have done and continue to do amazing things every day. Let’s make 2023 a year of acceptance for all our patients and their families and continue to be the change we want to see in the world.\n\nGlossary of Terms. Human Rights Campaign. (2023).

There are so many healthcare issues and policies that impact our practice, our patients, and the overall health of our nation. Many of us only see the election cycle as \"politics\" and do not think of how pivotal our votes are toward impacting healthcare. There are over 4 million nurses who have the voting power to impact change. But do you know the issues for which you are voting? What is important to us, as healthcare influencers?\n\nI encourage you to examine issues locally, statewide, and nationally. It is important to research and do your homework. Paying attention to the \"noise\" of social media and TV commercials is difficult and often misleading and dangerous.\n\nAs healthcare professionals and stewards, we are charged with the health and welfare of our patients. We can only do this by putting in the work. Putting in the work involves researching the candidates, encouraging everyone to vote, contacting candidates on why your voice matters and why healthcare matters to everyone. Take the time to call candidates offices, state your concerns as an RN, and remind them what healthcare should look like (they may need education). Give examples from your own practice that impacts the decisions they make. These are significant ways to become a changemaker, especially when 4 million plus are doing it! A great piece of advice when advocating is to focus on key issues and tie them to your community and practice when talking to local candidates.\n\nThe ANA calls for nurses to participate in health policy. Recently the AMA as well as NIH have acknowledged that voting is a social determinant to health. Healthcare experiences are often shaped by healthcare policy and according to Vot-ER, there are an estimated 51 million unregistered voters (often \"at risk\" people, who won't be represented). We need to find ways to impact voter registration.\n\nHere are the health policy issues on the ballot for the midterms:\n\nExpansion of the ACA\n\nMedicare Payment Reductions\n\nThe Momnibus Bill-Black Maternal Health Act (key issues for our patients, including expanded postpartum care and Medicaid complement)\n\nHealth Equity/Improving Data-particularly as it impacts healthcare deserts, rural areas, POC, LGBTQ, people who are living below the poverty line and other struggling communities\n\nSurprise Billing Implementation\n\nPublic Health Legislation-(response to pandemics, supply chain, shortages)\n\nCures 2.0 (multiple issues- telehealth, access to research, therapeutics)\n\nReproductive Rights\n\nDrug Pricing (e.g., Insulin) and access to other lifesaving medications\n\nEnvironmental and Climate Justice\n\nLooking at the issues, they intersect with NANN's Advocacy Agenda. These include Healthcare Disparities, Covid-19 impacts, Mental Health, Nursing Workforce, Environmental/Climate issues, Paid Family Leave, and Access to Nutrition and Education surrounding Human Milk provisions.\n\nElections are essential to our nursing practice and NANN encourages you to participate in shaping the healthcare for our patients and our nation. Your VOICE impacts healthcare policy.\n\nResources\n\nBrown CL, Raza D, Pinto AD. Voting, health and interventions in healthcare settings: a scoping review.

Sweet MS RN ACCNS-Neo\n\nWorld Breastfeeding Week was first celebrated in 1992 with declarations and legislation in more than 120 countries to “protect, promote, and support” breastfeeding.5 Breastfeeding was recognized as “wet nursing” from 2000BC until the 20th century; this was a means, moreover, need to feed babies back then.11 Today we celebrate world breastfeeding the first week of August; with the month of August then declared National Breastfeeding Awareness Month. National Indigenous Milk Medicine, Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Week, and Black Mothers Breastfeeding Week theme observations then follow.8\n\nBreastfeeding rates have gone from 2/3 of women providing human milk in the early 1900’s, to declines of 22% initiation rates and inclines to 70% through the mid 70’s to late 90’s.15 We have learned socioeconomic, cultural and education status of the lactating parent additionally impacts breastfeeding rates. A more well-off, paid for leave parent has shown longer term breastfeeding rates than those of the less-educated and poorer income status in the US.9 Additionally those supported to breastfeed have longer term success feeding at 6 months than those without support or resources.9,10 Breastfeeding became a status symbol at one point defined as a luxury over the necessity for the baby to feed and receive the benefits of their parents human milk.9 This group knows best the science, growth, and impact of a lactating parent feeding their milk to their baby.\n\nLactating parents need our help, and the support of government and family agencies to be successful and continue providing their milk outside of the hospital.10 We learned in the past decade the importance of breastfeeding within the first hour of a newborn’s life for both c-section and vaginal deliveries. With breastfeeding an established custom from the 20th century to today, how do we continue to give our support? Established Skin to Skin, trained healthcare workers, supplementation w/ breastmilk, and Paid Family Leave are a few of those ways.9\n\nNANN Healthcare Policy and Advocacy Committee is dedicated to improve outcomes for our neonates and their families supporting Paid Family Leave, Nutrition, Direct Provision of Human Milk, and Disparities Within Neonatal Care.6 A Healthy People 2030 goal is to increase the percent of infants breastfed exclusively for six months to 42.4%.1\n\nWith headlines stating parents are now “forced” to consider breastfeeding related to the formula shortage, our nation falls into a “crisis” to find ways to feed their babies formula.4 President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Access to Baby Formula Act into law today, making sure there was government control for formula and enacted Operation Fly Formula, to bring safe and regulated international formula to the USA.12\n\nMy hopes for our neonatal population next time would be headlines reading: “Breastfeeding Alternatives are running low, see ways to ramp up your breastmilk supply.” We have accomplished much, with more to do regarding our breastfeeding rates, cultural norms and socioeconomic impacts today. The CDC Breastfeeding Report Card states “Among infants born in 2019, most (83.2%) started out receiving some breast milk, and 78.6% were receiving any breast milk at 1 month.”3 If you are not certain how your state performs, and their legislation to support breastfeeding, then check out the https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm website to see how your state report card measures up, and the work to be done.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In 2020, 14.2 million (1 in 20) U.S. adults experienced serious mental illness (SMI) (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2022). According to the National Institute of Mental Health, SMI is characterized by a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder which interferes with one’s major activities. Individuals experiencing mental illness often experience physical ailments, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, and diabetes among other conditions. Symptoms related to increased stress, exhibited as headaches, anxiety, and feelings of overwhelm may also be experienced.\n\nIn April 2020, Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency room physician at New York Presbyterian, died by suicide after several weeks of providing care for COVID-19 positive patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Dr. Breen’s death highlighted concerns regarding the care of the frontline provider. Nurses as front-line providers were experiencing high stress and burnout prior to the pandemic. The mental toll experienced from the increased patient demand, staffing shortages and increased responsibility has been classified as trauma. In a review of the psychological impact of epidemics/pandemics on healthcare workers, as much as 73% experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms. Ten to forty percent of the surveyed group experienced symptoms for one to three years post pandemic (Preti, Di Mattei, Perego, et. al., 2020).\n\nThe recognition, acknowledgement and treatment of symptoms are essential to the protection of one’s mental health. Self-care is important to maintain and improve one’s mental health. Activities including regular exercise, healthy and regular meals, prioritizing sleep, and the adoption of relaxation techniques like meditation should be a part of every nurse’s daily regimen. Nurses should not wait until symptoms are overwhelming. Finally, employers should provide resources for their staff experiencing stress and burnout.\n\nAdditional Mental Health Resources\n\nNIMH: Caring for Your Mental Health\n\nCDC: Stress and Coping Resources\n\nSuicide hotline: 988\n\nBibliography\n\n​National Alliance on Mental Illness.

The agenda reflects the interests of our organization, what would be important for our practice in Neonatology as well as current issues that impact our practice. Often, we agree to leave an item “as is” or in more recent years, we’ve edited or added critical items as noted in the inclusion of the Covid 19 and Healthcare Disparities items due to the impact on health care, policy and our practice.\n\nThis year, the committee chose to add “Environmental Justice and Climate Impacts” to the agenda. While it may seem unusual to include this, it is an important part of caring for our patients, as well as educating our present and future workforce. Nurses are ideally suited to address this. Our goal has always been to optimize health at every part of our patient’s development. In order to do that, we must work toward fair and equitable treatment of all people, address environmental and climate issues within this context, recognizing that this is a nursing advocacy role that should be a part of our practice.\n\nNursing education and standards of nursing practice require that nurses know how to reduce exposures to environmental health hazards (ANA).\n\nIn 1995, the Institute for Medicine report, Nursing, Health, and the Environment, clearly stated that environmental health was an important part of nursing practice. It was not clear, at the time, how it would be included in nursing education or practice. Soon after, The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (ANHE) was formed. It is the only national nursing organization with the sole purpose of combining health and the environment. NANN is actively involved with this group through monthly meetings and collaborates with ANHE when legislation is considered for climate, environment and health issues.\n\nBy definition, “Environmental Justice (EJ) is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies”. (EPA)\n\n“People throughout the United States face climate change-related health risks, but some of us will feel the effects earlier and more severely. Groups at increased risk include those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions.” (CDC)\n\n“Environmental factors do play an important role in maternal health. They make an important contribution towards placental problems like low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, as well as have long term effects on neuronal and behavioral development in adult life.” (NIH)\n\nHow we incorporate this into our practice will determine outcomes. Our hope is to start with small but significant steps. Over time, the HPAC committee will look for ways to raise awareness of issues that directly impact our patients and families. Nurses, alone, may not feel that they can impact global and environmental issues. However, we own responsibility to change what we can through small but significant action.\n\nIdentifying climate change and environmental pollution as a factor in poor health outcomes is our first step. This is critical in areas where health care disparities already exist. There are several ways to get involved on this topic:\n\nCommit to raising awareness, education and sharing what we know.\n\nIncorporate our awareness into action by bringing it into our practice.\n\nEngage with other organizations (ANHE) to investigate and act on how we can change the trajectory of health outcomes related to environmental toxins and climate change.\n\nEngage your elected officials, keeping in mind that they depend on us, the nursing community, to guide and influence policy.\n\nNANN is committed to raising awareness, educate and engage in the conversation, to improve outcomes. We invite you to share your experiences, add to the MyNANN conversation, share information to elevate awareness, and challenge your colleagues to do the same.\n\nReferences\n\nTriche, E.

Search engine queries instantly provide answers and information. Smart phones are utilized for video conferencing, messaging, scheduling, photography, and so much more. Podcasts and blogs cover news and a variety of other topics. And of course, there are many social media platforms used for virtual networking that, for a vast majority, has become a part of our daily routine.\n\nAdvocacy, defined as the act or process of supporting a cause or proposal (Merriam Webster, n.d.), has transformed over time. Advocacy can range from raising awareness, to direct lobbying for change. The digital age has made it simple and efficient for individuals and organizations to instantly reach large audiences via the internet. The number of websites has grown exponentially, from an estimated 3,000 sites in 1994, to 1.88 billion in 2021 (Armstrong, 2021). This abundance of existing websites can be overwhelming, and it can be challenging to find the knowledge and sources you need to get started. The websites listed below are not all-inclusive but may be helpful in locating the knowledge or resources needed to be an advocate in healthcare.\n\nAmerican Association of Colleges of Nursing\n\nAACN is a nonpartisan organization that serves to educate and advocate for nursing education, research, and practice. They host an annual Student Policy Summit and publish a Washington Weekly newsletter. The site has a “take action” section with letters you can send to your representatives.\n\nAmerican Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)\n\nThe AANP website contains links and resources for tracking the latest federal and state legislation pertaining to nurse practitioners and healthcare. The advocacy center lists several legislative issues with electronic letters of support that can be sent to representatives. Members can subscribe to receive e-bulletins, Smart Briefs, and Government Affairs Updates.\n\nAmerican Nurses Association\n\nThe ANA believes that advocacy is a pillar of nursing. The advocacy section of this website has the latest federal and state legislation and contains an advocacy toolkit with tips on becoming an effective nursing advocate. You can subscribe to their blog, Capital Beat.\n\nAssociation of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses\n\n(AWHONN) is an organization dedicated to improving the health of women and newborns and strengthening the nursing profession. This website highlights the organization's key legislative priorities and phone scripts to use when calling your representatives regarding specific bills.\n\nCongress.gov\n\nCongress.gov is the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. The site provides access to legislative information for Members of Congress, legislative agencies, and the public. Current and past legislation or topics can be queried and there are many resources along with a section to contact your state representative.\n\nThe Federal Register\n\nThis website was created to make it easier for citizens and communities to understand the regulatory process and to participate in government decision- making.

Riley, BSN RNC-NIC C-NPT C-NNIC\n\nWith Black History Month around the corner, it is important to discuss and recognize disparities within the NICU. While it might not be talked about often enough, it is known that there are significant disparities in healthcare and health outcomes for BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color) patients in our country. Three contributors to health disparities have been described: increased risk for preterm birth, lower quality of care, and socioeconomic disadvantages. This remains true for our pregnant patient population and NICU population as well. In order to assess our delivery of care in the NICU, a composite indicator was developed in California called Baby-MONITOR. This can be used to measure the quality of care provided to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants based on 9 process and outcome measures of quality chosen by a panel of experts. This tool may be applied to any NICU to assess the quality of care delivered (Profit et al., 2014). In 2017, a retrospective analysis of 18,616 patients from 134 NICUs in California specifically from 2010 to 2014 was conducted using Baby-MONITOR. It was determined that there were clinically and statistically significant racial and/or ethnic variations in quality of care between NICUs and even within NICUs. There were also findings that indicated the significant quality disparities were within modifiable measures, including whether a VLBW patient received antenatal steroids or not (Profit et al., 2017). The disparities that are apparent in NICUs across the country can be addressed and, in some cases, have been shown to nearly disappear when robust efforts are made through individualized process engineering and culturally competent care. Looking ahead, we have discussed this, analyzed this, and studied this extensively, however; what are we going to do to bring about a change in these statistics?\n\nOne of the largest recent efforts to address the aforementioned disparities is the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 (H.R. 959). This bill, which has been mentioned time and time again, would build on efforts to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months. It would also extend much further by investing in social determinants of health, funding community-based organizations to improve health outcomes, support patients with substance use disorder, and much more (H.R. 959, 2021). This bill is a consolidated effort by the Black Maternal Health Caucus to address health disparities. It provides a multifaceted approach to attacking the health disparities lamented by our broken system. This legislation has been introduced but has yet to be acted upon by Congress. Similarly, the Build Back Better Act (H.R. 5376) aims to enact many of the provisions from the Momnibus Act, allocating millions of dollars toward social determinants of health. There is also money allocated to strengthen the nursing workforce, including $500 million for the Nurse Corps and $170 million to grow and diversify the nursing workforce in maternal and perinatal health. Additionally, there are provisions to expand research and data collections to determine inequitable areas in our healthcare system (H.R. 5376, 2021). This bill has faced tremendous partisan struggles in Congress and has not moved forward. Many of these efforts are stalled because the legislation would also expand Medicaid coverage in the postpartum period nationally.\n\nThe expansion of Medicaid coverage is a tangible area that can be explored to improve care in the postpartum period. Under the Affordable Care Act, states are able to extend coverage for patients postpartum. For example, in Mississippi, the current program allows for 60 days of postpartum healthcare coverage. After that 60-day period, patients are cut off and lose health coverage. A Maternal Mortality Review Committee, which found that almost 40% of pregnancy-related deaths in the state occurred more than 6 weeks after giving birth, recommended extending coverage to a full year postpartum (Harris, 2022). This measure is still awaiting action by the state legislature. Previous proposals have been unsuccessful as legislators attempted to determine the extent to which the governor’s office can control the state Medicaid agency. This session, bipartisan bills have been filed in both the house and senate to extend Medicaid coverage and a voting deadline has been set for committees to address this (Harris, 2022). Efforts at the state level can be used to address health disparities by recognizing the gaps in healthcare and insurance coverage and seeking out solutions. Many states have made efforts to expand their Medicaid coverage, but 12 have yet to move forward with an extension. While there are many efforts on both sides of the aisle to address health disparities, we aren’t going to make any progress until we stop letting “the aisle” decide the quality of outcomes for our patients.\n\nNANN strongly believes that all infants, regardless of race, parental economic or educational status, or geographic area should receive equitable, quality healthcare. As nurses, we have to advocate for our patients and their families to the fullest extent. There are several ways to get involved:\n\nLearn and stay abreast of the issues.\n\nEngage with your local community leaders and stakeholders.\n\nShare what you learn and contact your House or Senate representatives about the importance of reducing disparities.\n\nAdvocare for awareness and support for the issues through your professional organizations.\n\nWe can do our part to help address health disparities, and demand change through action on a public policy level. Every parent and infant deserves to receive the best care possible.\n\nReferences:\n\nBlack Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, H.R. 959, 117th Cong.

Now, on the cusp of 2022, we have a vaccine that helps prevent the spread of the disease and lessen its impact if contracted. The U.S. and the world have experienced a slow and sometimes fleeting “return to normalcy.” That said, the impact COVID 19 has had on healthcare is undeniable, as are the unforeseen outcomes that are continuing to unfold especially for pregnant women.\n\nMany of the outcomes impacting pregnant women can be offset with vaccination before or during pregnancy.\n\nTo address negative outcomes of all sorts, NANN is clear in its mission: “Through the leadership of NANN's Health Policy and Advocacy Committee, NANN seeks to optimize care and health outcomes for neonates and their families.” The challenges created by the virus are testing our abilities to optimize care and health outcomes. In the United States 61.4 % of the population is fully vaccinated against COVID 19 (Our World Data, 2021). Portions of the remaining 38.6% of unvaccinated people are pregnant or lactating women. In the face of various beliefs on vaccinations and the deadliness of COVID 19 we know this: Pregnancy is a severe risk factor for the disease. Contracting COVID 19 while pregnant makes you more likely to be admitted to the ICU, require mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and an obvious worst case is maternal and infant death (CDC, 2021). If that is not startling enough there is new evidence suggesting that contracting COVID 19 while pregnant leads to additional adverse outcomes such as an increased risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and still birth (Jamieson & Rasmussen, 2021). Vaccination can help prevent contracting the disease and allow for a milder course if infected to avoid these tragic complications.\n\nThe impact of COVID 19 on mental health has become a national crisis, and the same is true for antenatal and postpartum populations. Fears surrounding contracting COVID 19 and passing it on to a child are real and prevalent. While it looks that there is minimal risk from vertical infection during pregnancy there is limited but promising research that the vaccine does provide antibodies and some protection to the infant after delivery (ACOG, 2021). Another harmful, but down-played factor is the isolation COVID 19 causes. Mothers who have COVID 19 are often fearful they will pass it on to their child after they deliver. They are at times isolated from their child and separated from other loved ones and persons of support. The lack of contact with their child can impact bonding, milk production, and increase the risk of postpartum depression and anxiety. Guilt associated with passing the virus to an infant postpartum, or the fear of the infant getting sick, can also negatively impact mothers’ mental health and the family unit. Vaccination is key in preventing this. While vaccines are imperfect and breakthrough cases do happen, especially when new variants such as Omnicron emerge, there is peace of mind knowing that a parent has done everything possible to decrease the risk of contraction for their child. Let us not overlook the value of that peace of mind.\n\nThe United States has been striving for improved social programming to improve the maternal and infant mortality statistics within the U.S. These efforts and outcomes of such programming are undermined by the lack of vaccination causing widening gaps of access to care. The impact of large numbers of unvaccinated people threatens our ability to deliver healthcare in a timely and efficient manner. The longer the pandemic continues due to large number of unvaccinated people, social programs will not meet their potential including advances in maternal and infant mortality.\n\nAs nurses we must continue to provide our patients and families the best care, which includes educating them on the positive impact vaccination "
