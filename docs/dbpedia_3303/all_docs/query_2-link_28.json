        "text": "The Editorial Style Guide provides common words, definitions and abbreviations as well as style and punctuation guidance.\n\nThe Associated Press Stylebook and Websterâs New World College Dictionary are the primary references for all university communications. The Chicago Manual of Style and other sources should be used when the Editorial Style Guide and AP Stylebook donât provide guidance for any specific issue.\n\nEntries in the guide are listed in bold font and as they should appear on first reference. Some of the entries include preferred ways to use the entry on second reference. Second references and examples are given in italic font.\n\nNumeral\n\n1021 West Dickson\n\nBuilt in 1958, it is the primary dining hall serving the residential halls on the south side of upper campus. Because 1021 West Dickson is both the name of the dining facility and its address, writers may need to be clear that they are writing about a dining facility. Use a phrase such as: The 1021 West Dickson dining facility is at the southwest corner of Dickson Street and McIlroy Avenue. Aside from the main cafeteria, 1021 West Dickson includes a Starbucks coffee shop, a Slim Chickens shop, a Quiznos sandwich shop and a convenience store among other amenities.\n\nSpell out West as part of the name, an exception to the AP style on addresses. Its building code is FSDI.\n\nA\n\nabbreviations and acronyms\n\nIn general, avoid using abbreviations and acronyms that readers would not recognize quickly and easily.\n\nAn abbreviation is a shortening of a word or words: Ph.D. for Philosophaie Doctor, for instance. An acronym is a word formed from the first letter or letters of a series of words: scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus).\n\nDo not follow an organization's full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference without this arrangement, do not use the acronym. Names not commonly before the public should not be reduced to acronyms solely to save a few words.\n\nDo not use \"the\" in front of acronyms that are pronounced like a word, such as NASA, but do use \"the\" in front of abbreviations or acronyms that are pronounced by their letters, such as the FBI or the CIA.\n\nThe Associated Press recommends abbreviating some titles when used before a full name: Dr., Gov., Lt. Gov., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Rep., the Rev., Sen. and certain military titles listed under their separate entry.\n\nAbbreviate junior and senior after an individual's name but don't set off with commas. Abbreviate company, corporation, incorporated and limited when used as part of a corporate name but do not set off with commas: Tyson Foods Inc., Allen Canning Co., Alltel Corp. or Trimble Navigation Ltd.\n\nRefer also to the academic degrees, building names, military titles and University of Arkansas entries.\n\nAbernathy AgriScience and Technology Education Center\n\nIt is located at the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center. On second reference, AgriScience Center is sufficient. Its building code is AATC.\n\nAborigine\n\nThis term is outdated. It referred to the aboriginal people of Australia. It is considered offensive and should be avoided.\n\nRefer also to the native, Native entry.\n\nacademic courses\n\nCourse names.\n\nacademic degrees\n\nThe University of Arkansas awards four types of academic degrees based on the expertise and recognition that a student has attained: a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, a specialist degree and a doctoral degree. When using an academic degree to establish a person's credentials in the narrative of a story, the preferred form is to spell out the name of the degree: Barbara Smith, who holds a doctorate, or Bill Jones earned a bachelor's degree in art from the university.\n\nWriters may use either the proper name of the degree, such as Master of Business Administration, or the informal wording, master's degree in business administration. Uppercase the former and lowercase the latter. Also lowercase words that are not part of the proper name of the degree: She earned a Bachelor of Science in biology.\n\nUse of abbreviations such as B.A., M.A., LL.D. or Ph.D. is allowed when the preferred use would be cumbersome, such as when numerous individuals are being listed with their degrees. In an exception to the Associated Press style, treat the shortened forms as abbreviations rather than acronyms, so use M.F.A. rather than MFA or M.B.A. instead of MBA. If using an abbreviation after a person's name, use it only after the full name of the person and not after just a last name: Barbara Smith Ph.D. and for use with Alumni Association materials include the graduation year with no space between the degree and the date: Jim Smith B.A.'15 or Mike Smith B.A.1915. With more than one degree, include a comma: Jill Brown B.S.'02, M.S.'04 said.\n\nThe correct form for using the possessive is to follow the possessive word â bachelor's, master's or doctor's â with the word \"degree\":\n\nRIGHT: He received a master's degree in engineering.\n\nWRONG: He earned a bachelor's of architecture degree.\n\nRIGHT: He earned a Bachelor of Architecture.\n\nRIGHT: Bill Jones B.Arch.'98 is an alumnus.\n\nWriters should be aware that abbreviations of academic degrees sometimes correspond to the Latin name of the degree. A Bachelor of Arts, for instance, is sometimes abbreviated by other institutions as A.B. because the Latin is artium bachelaurreus. The University of Arkansas abbreviates LL.M., J.D., O.T.D., Ph.D. and Ed.D in similar fashion. Generally, use the English version of full degree names rather than the Latin, except for Juris Doctor (Doctor of Law), which is awarded by the School of Law. The following degrees are awarded at the university:\n\nDegree Abbr. Bachelor of Architecture B.Arch. Bachelor of Arts B.A. Bachelor of Fine Arts B.F.A. Bachelor of Interior Architecture and Design B.I.A.D. Bachelor of Landscape Architecture B.L.A. Bachelor of Music B.M. Bachelor of Science B.S.

Master of Social Work M.S.W.\n\nRefer also to the degrees with distinction and honorary degrees entries.\n\nacademic departments\n\nThe colleges and schools at the University of Arkansas are divided into departments. Very often, an academic department will offer a major of the same name, but several departments offer additional majors and some offer no undergraduate major. For instance, the Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sscience offers both a major in crop, soil and environmental sciences and a major in crop management; and, the Department of Entomology offers a minor and a graduate program but not an undergraduate major. Writers should be aware that these differences do exist.\n\nA few also offer classwork in a particular field for which no major is offered. The physics department offers coursework in astronomy, for instance.\n\nTreat department names as proper names and capitalize the full name in constructions such as Department of History, or Ralph E. Martin Department of Chemical Engineering. This is an exception to Associated Press style, which treats academic departments as common names and recommends lowercase. Do use the subject lowercase if not part of the full department name: she teaches finance, professor of food science.\n\nThe word department may be used before or after the academic discipline: Department of History or the History Department, although using department before the discipline is recommended for departments with long names: the Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation.\n\nAcademic departments are listed below by college and school. Five schools at the university â the Eleanor Mann School of Nursing, the School of Art, the School of Human Environmental Sciences, the School of Journalism and Strategic Media, and the School of Social Work â are hierarchically at the same administrative level as these academic departments. See their individual entries for more information about them.\n\nDale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences\n\nDepartment of Agricultural and Extension Education\n\nDepartment of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness\n\nDepartment of Animal Science\n\nDepartment of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences\n\nDepartment of Entomology\n\nDepartment of Food Science\n\nDepartment of Horticulture\n\nDepartment of Plant Pathology\n\nDepartment of Poultry Science\n\nFay Jones School of Architecture and Design\n\nDepartment of Architecture\n\nDepartment of Interior Architecture and Design\n\nDepartment of Landscape Architecture\n\nFulbright College of Arts and Sciences\n\nDepartment of Anthropology\n\nDepartment of Biological Sciences\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry\n\nDepartment of Communication\n\nDepartment of English\n\nDepartment of Geosciences\n\nDepartment of History\n\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences\n\nDepartment of Music\n\nDepartment of Philosophy\n\nDepartment of Physics\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nDepartment of Psychological Science\n\nDepartment of Sociology and Criminology\n\nDepartment of Theatre\n\nDepartment of World Languages, Literatures and Cultures\n\nSam M. Walton College of Business\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nDepartment of Finance\n\nDepartment of Information Systems\n\nDepartment of Management\n\nDepartment of Marketing\n\nDepartment of Strategy, Entrepreneurship and Venture Innovation\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Department of Supply Chain Management\n\nWilliam Dillard Department of Accounting\n\nCollege of Education and Health Professions\n\nDepartment of Curriculum and Instruction\n\nDepartment of Education Reform\n\nDepartment of Health, Human Performance and Recreation\n\nDepartment of Occupational Therapy\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation, Human Resources and Communication Disorders\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nDepartment of Biological and Agricultural Engineering\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering\n\nDepartment of Civil Engineering\n\nDepartment of Computer Science and Computer Engineering\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\n\nDepartment of Industrial Engineering\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\n\nRalph E. Martin Department of Chemical Engineering\n\nRefer also to the colleges, departments, divisions and schools entries.\n\nacademic titles\n\nIn general, formal titles used before a person's name are capitalized: Dean Matthew Waller or former Chancellor Ferritor. If not used prior to a person's name, a title is no longer being used in the formal sense and should be lowercase: Matthew Waller, dean of the Sam M. Walton College of Business, or Dan Ferritor is a former chancellor of the Fayetteville campus.\n\nThe university includes two formal ranks â University Professor and Distinguished Professor â that might cause ambiguity. When used, treat them in the same manner as an endowed title and capitalize them when used before or after a name: Max Meisch, University Professor of entomology; Amy Farmer, who holds the rank of University Professor, or Boris Schein, Distinguished Professor of mathematical sciences.\n\nProfessors and administrators often wear more than one hat and subsequently have more than one title. On first reference, identify a subject by the hat she is wearing for that story. If it's a story about her research as a professor, identify her as a professor. If it's a story about a research center that she directs, identify her as the director of the research center initially and then reference her status as a professor later.\n\nEXAMPLE: If you were to write about sustainability, you might identify Gregory Salamo, director of the Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, on first reference and then further identify him in a later reference as Salamo, Distinguished Professor of physics, said â¦\n\nEndowed chairs, professorships and lectureships should include the full name of the title. When using a long title, do not use it in front of a person's name. Try to use it in the appositive form: â¦ said Amy Farmer, the Margaret Gerig and R.S. Martin Jr. Chair in Business, or write a completely new sentence: Amy Farmer is a professor of economics and holds the Margaret Gerig and R.S. Martin Jr. Chair in Business.\n\nSpell out Twenty-First when referring to one of the endowed positions created through donations to the Campaign for the Twenty-First Century: Alan Mantooth, holder of the Twenty-First Century Chair in Mixed-Signal IC Design and CAD.\n\nSome formal academic titles include:\n\nChancellor Provost Vice Chancellor Vice Provost Associate Vice Chancellor Dean Assistant Vice Chancellor Associate Dean\n\nRefer also to the academic degrees, courtesy titles, titles and professor entries.\n\nacademic year\n\nBecause the academic year starts in one calendar year and ends in the next calendar year, refer to the year as the 2014-15 academic year.\n\nStudents who finish work on degrees during a summer session or the fall semester may receive their diplomas during the Fall Commencement or the Spring Commencement, but they are included as part of the graduating class of the following spring for purposes such as Senior Walk. However, students who are sufficiently close to graduation in the spring and who anticipate finishing the degree in the summer are allowed to participate in Spring Commencement prior to finishing, but a degree and diploma are not awarded until all classwork is finished.\n\nRefer also to the calendar year and fiscal year entries.\n\naccents and diacritics\n\nDiacritics are marks added to letters, usually as a guide to show correct pronunciation of the letter in a specific language. Accents are the most common subset of diacritics, and they usually are placed above the letter needing affected pronunciation. For instance, pronunciation of the Japanese word sakÃ© might use an accent to show the \"e\" is pronounced whereas the pronunciation of the English word sake has no accent because the \"e\" is silent.\n\nEnglish uses very few diacritics, but American speech and writing have adopted many foreign words that had diacritics in their original language. For foreign words that have become common in English, diacritics are usually unnecessary: cafe, chateau, deja vu, eclair, hors d'oeuvre and naivete. (The original spellings were cafÃ©, chÃ¢teau, dÃ©jÃ vu, Ã©clair, hors d'Åuvre and naÃ¯vetÃ©.)\n\nAccents and diacritics, however, are acceptable in such words and may be preferred in less well known international words to help a reader recognize that the word being used is foreign, but writers should use diacritical marks consistently. Don't refer to someone's rÃ©sumÃ© in one paragraph and then to their resume in the next.\n\nSome common accent and diacritical marks:\n\nÃ© - acute\n\nÄ - caron (inverted circumflex)\n\nÃ§ - cedilla\n\nÃ¢ - circumflex\n\nÃ¨ - grave\n\nÃ± - tilde\n\nÃ¼ - umlaut (diaeresis)\n\nRefer also to the italics entry.\n\naccept, except\n\nAccept means to receive. Except means to exclude.\n\naccreditation\n\nThe University of Arkansas is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Various schools, colleges and departments may be further accredited. See the Catalog of Studies for a list.\n\nSpell this with two c's and two m's.\n\nACT\n\nAcceptable in all references to the previously designated American College Testing Program.\n\nacting\n\nWhen used with a proper title, it remains lowercase: The president introduced acting Chancellor Mary Smith.\n\nactor\n\nAcceptable for either male or female actors. Actress is acceptable if a subject of a story prefers it.\n\nA.D.\n\nGenerally, A.D. is assumed. Use the abbreviation only when doubt exists about whether a year is A.D. or B.C. The Associated Press says it is acceptable in all references for anno Domini; however, university writers should be aware that some academic disciplines use C.E., or common era, instead of A.D. to refer to the same time period. Follow the academic discipline's standards, but explain what common era means if the context is unclear.\n\nBecause the translation of anno Domini 1066 would read in the year of the Lord 1066, the abbreviation A.D. should be used prior to the year: A.D. 1066. If C.E. is used instead, it should follow the year: 1066 C.E.\n\nRefer also to the B.C., B.C.E., C.E. and the historical periods and events entries.\n\nadditional major\n\nFor academic purposes, additional major refers to situations in the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences when a student who is fulfilling all requirements of a Bachelor of Science, a Bachelor of Social Work, a Bachelor of Fine Arts or a Bachelor Music degree and may also claim an additional major in a humanistic discipline, social science or interdisciplinary program associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. Upon completion of all requirements in the additional major, the major will be included on the student's transcript although the B.A. degree is not awarded.\n\nRefer also to the combined majors, double degrees, double majors, majors and second major entries.\n\naddresses\n\nCampus building names should be abbreviated when used for a mailing address in narrative material: Union Programs, ARKU A665, 1 University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701.\n\nAlways use figures for an address number: 1 University of Arkansas.\n\nSpell out First through Ninth when used as street names: 504 W. Fourth St.\n\nAbbreviate Ave., Blvd., St. and points of the compass when part of a specific address: KUAF, 727 W. Dickson St., Fayetteville, AR 72701. Spell out street, boulevard and avenue when a street number is not used: Dickson Street or Arkansas Avenue. Always spell out other roadways: drive, circle, lane, road, way, etc.\n\nUse the postal abbreviations for states and territories when giving full addresses.\n\nUse periods in the abbreviation P.O. for post office box numbers.\n\nRefer also to the highway designations, states and territories entries.\n\nadjectives\n\nThis guide uses the abbreviation adj. to identify the spelling of the adjectival form of words. Adjectives modify nouns.\n\nRefer also to the hyphen entry for guidance on compound modifiers.\n\nadjunct\n\nDo not capitalize. The word adjunct denotes someone who teaches at the university without permanent status as a faculty member. It also is occasionally used to show that a professor with faculty appointment in one academic department also teaches in a second department.\n\nadministration\n\nLowercase: the university administration, the chancellor's administration, the Beebe administration or the Gearhart administration.\n\nAdministration Building\n\nBuilt in 1969, the building code is ADMN. The building includes three stories about ground and a full sub-ground-level floor. The building contains the offices of the chancellor and provost as well as the primary office for the university's divisions, including:\n\nDivision of Academic Affairs\n\nDivision of Finance and Administration\n\nDivision for Inclusion, Equity and Diversity\n\nDivision of Research and Innovation\n\nDivision of Student Affairs, including the Dean of Students\n\nDivision of University Advancement\n\nBudget Office\n\nOffice of Government and Community Relations\n\nOffice of Human Resources\n\nOffice of Institutional Research and Assessment\n\nOffice of Special Events\n\nAdministrative Services Building\n\nBuilt in 1983, the building code is ADSB. Service units housed at the building include:\n\nParking Operations Office\n\nUniversity of Arkansas Police Department\n\nUniversity Information Technology Services\n\nadmission, registration\n\nAdmission must be granted to the university before a student can register for classes.\n\nAdohi Hall\n\nThis residence hall, opened in fall 2019, is made up of a common room and two wings. It is on Stadium Drive south of Pomfret Hall and east of Bud Walton Arena. The five-story complex provides housing for about 708 students and caters to those majoring in fields focused on architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, art, theatre, music and English. The building includes amenities such as a recording studio, art studio, gallery spaces, music practice rooms, dance studio and performance spaces. \"Adohi\" is a Cherokee word with several meanings, including \"woods,\" \"forest\" and \"timber.\" Preferred translation for university use is \"woods.\" The name Adohi reflects the use of laminated timber for the major construction elements of the building.\n\nAdohi Hall is open to all students and has about 708 beds. Its common building code is ADOR. The north wing is ADOA, the south wing ADOB and the common room is ADOC.\n\nadvanced placement\n\nThe national College Board offers classes and exams in 37 subjects for high school students who want to gain college credit before starting college. Capitalize the phrase when referring to the College Board's specific Advanced Placement Program. The abbreviation AP is trademarked by the College Board and widely recognized in academic circles but not readily recognizable by the general public, so try to avoid using it.\n\nadverbs\n\nThis guide uses the abbreviation adv. to identify the spelling of the adverbial form of words. Most words ending in -ly are adverbs.\n\nAn adverb is a modifier that modifies verbs, adjectives and other adverbs, usually by showing manner, condition, degree: She quickly assembled the crowd; a newly painted room; a highly attended lecture.\n\nDon't use hyphens between adverbs ending in -ly and adjectives they modify: an easily remembered rule, a badly damaged building.\n\nRefer also to the hyphen under the punctuation entry.\n\nadverse, averse\n\nAdverse means difficult or unfavorable: She forecasts adverse economic conditions. Averse means reluctant, resistant or opposed: He is averse to making a forecast.\n\nadviser, advisory\n\nAdviser is the preferred spelling to advisor, except when used in a proper name. For instance: the University of Arkansas Board of Advisors, but the academic adviser.\n\naffect, effect\n\nAffect, when used as a verb, means to act upon: The test score will affect his grade. It is also used as a noun on rare occasion, mostly in psychology to describe a feeling or emotion.\n\nEffect, when used as a verb, means to cause: The provost will effect changes to the curriculum. When effect is used as a noun, it means a result or consequence: The effect was immediate, or the gift will have a lasting effect.\n\naffixes\n\nRefer also to the prefixes and suffixes entries.\n\nAfrican American\n\nPreferred usage to describe the heritage of someone who has both African and American heritage or citizenship. Use without a hyphen, whether as a modifier or not. In racial or cultural contexts, such as enrollment comparisons, Black may be preferable. As with other ethnicities, follow a personâs preference.\n\nRefer also to the ethnicity and race entry.\n\nafter-\n\nDo not use a hyphen after this prefix when it is used to form a noun: aftereffect, afterthought. Use a hyphen when after is used to form a compound modifier: after-dinner conversation.\n\nafterward\n\nNot afterwards.\n\nag\n\nThis shortening of agriculture should not be used except in quoted matter. When using it, no apostrophe is needed: the ag teachers.\n\nages\n\nAlways use figures for the ages of people: the 5-year-old boy, or the student is 19 years old.\n\nages of history\n\nRefer also to the historical periods and events entry.\n\nAgnes Blew Auditorium\n\nThis auditorium is in the School of Human Environmental Sciences Building. It seats 138 people. On second reference, Blew Auditorium is sufficient.\n\nAgricultural Experiment Station\n\nRefer also to the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station.\n\nAgricultural, Food and Life Sciences Building\n\nBuilt in 1955 with a second phase added in 1964, this building houses the offices of the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences, the Fayetteville office of the University of Arkansas System's vice president for agriculture and the offices of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station. It was originally called the Animal Science Building and still houses the Department of Animal Science in its north wing and the Department of Agricultural Education, Communications and Technology. Its building code is AFLS.\n\nAgricultural, Food and Life Sciences College\n\nRefer also to the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences entry.\n\nAgriculture Building\n\nBuilt in 1927, the building is on the National Register of Historic Places. The building houses the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness and the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology. Its building code is AGRI.\n\nAgriculture Annex\n\nOriginally called the Agricultural Hall, it was built in 1905 and opened in 1906 as the first home of what was then the newly created College of Agriculture. The Agriculture Annex is the second-oldest building still standing on campus, and it has also housed the home economics department and the infirmary. Currently, it houses the Agricultural Statistics Lab. Its building code is AGRX.\n\nAgri Farm\n\nRefer also to the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center entry.\n\nAgri Park\n\nThis recreational park on North Garland Avenue is part of the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center. It is operated by the University of Arkansas System's Division of Agriculture and includes a pavilion with kitchen facilities.\n\nAir Force ROTC\n\nRefer also to the Reserve Officers' Training Corps entry.\n\nall-\n\nUse a hyphen: all-around winner, all-American athlete, all-star cast.\n\nAll-America, All-American\n\nAn individual student is named an All-American athlete: All-American Darren McFadden. Use All-America when referring to the team: She was named to the All-America basketball team.\n\nall right\n\nTwo words. Not alright.\n\nall time, all-time\n\nHyphenated, all-time is a compound modifier: all-time favorite. Use without a hyphen when not a compound modifier: McDonnell was the best track coach of all time. Avoid the redundant all-time record.\n\nallusion, illusion\n\nAllusion means an indirect reference: The allusion was to Fulbright's internationalism. The word illusion means an unreal or false impression: The set director created the illusion of 1930s Germany.\n\nalma mater\n\nThe words are Latin and translate to \"nourishing mother.\" The title of the University of Arkansas anthem is \"Alma Mater,\" so put it in quotes and uppercase it when referring to the university song. Brody Payne, an alumnus, wrote the lyrics in 1909, and they were set to music by Henry D. Tovey, a professor of music. Lowercase when using generically: The professor's alma mater is Yale.\n\nalpha code\n\nThe university uses alpha code abbreviations for a variety of purposes, such as designation of buildings, courses, degree programs and academic departments. For most purposes, use of the alpha code is unnecessary for press releases and marketing. In most cases, use the full name of the building or degree program.\n\nWhen an alpha code is necessary, such as a mailing address for a campus building, capitalize all letters of the alpha code: ADMN for the Administration Building. For course designations, the alpha code should be followed by a space, the numeric code, a space and the course title: FDSC 2503 Food Safety and Sanitation.\n\nRefer also to the entries on abbreviations and acronyms and course titles and numbers.\n\naltar (n.), alter (v.)\n\nAn altar is a platform used in a religious services. To alter means to change.\n\nAltheimer Laboratory\n\nIt is part of the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center and houses the department of crop, soil, and environmental sciences. On second reference, Altheimer Lab is sufficient. Its building code is ALTH.\n\nAlumni House\n\nRefer also to the Janelle Y. Hembree Alumni House.\n\nalumnus, alumna, alumni, alumnae, alumnx\n\nAlumnus is the Latin singular masculine form, and alumna is the singular feminine form. For the plural, alumni may be used either for an all-male group or for a mixed group. For an all-female group, use alumnae.\n\nIn recent years, a non-binary version of the Latin form has been proposed, alumnx, although it is still rare. If the subject of a story has a preference for it, though, follow their preference. The informal alum and alums are also possible options for non-gendered use, although they should be used with discretion because of their informality.
