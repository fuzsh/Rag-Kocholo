        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC - Once again, politicians hostile to sexual and reproductive health are showing us exactly who they are. Today, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) brought forward the Right to Contraception Act — a bill reintroduced by Sens. Markey (D-MA), Hirono (D-HI), and Duckworth (D-IL) — that would protect the right to birth control.\n\nThis seems like an easy “yes” vote, right? Since the vast majority of Americans believe birth control should be easier to get?\n\nNope.\n\nStatement from Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO, Planned Parenthood Action Fund:\n\n“This is diabolical. These politicians who fight with every fiber of their being to ban birth control and abortion — who believe they have a right to control our bodies — continue to show us that they don’t care about protecting people’s health and well-being. They obviously have no understanding of the many reasons people are prescribed birth control, including managing conditions such as endometriosis, PCOS, hormone therapy, period cramps, acne, and the lowering of risk of cervical and ovarian cancer, to name just a few. And that’s why politicians have no business inserting themselves in medical decisions.”\n\nThe United States has a long history of denying reproductive freedom through racism, discrimination, and coercion — stripping people with disabilities and Black, Indigenous, and immigrant communities of their rights. Protecting access to birth control methods, including emergency contraception, is essential to ensuring all people can make decisions about their own bodies, lives, and futures.\n\nSo, if you’re going to mess with people’s access to essential, time-sensitive health care, we’re going to name names and demand that, in the future, they vote in line with the majority of Americans who support sexual and reproductive health and rights. Here’s a list of all the senators who voted against protecting access to birth control:\n\nAlabama\n\nTommy Tuberville\n\nArkansas\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nTom Cotton\n\nFlorida\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nRick Scott\n\nIdaho\n\nMike Crapo\n\nJim Risch\n\nIndiana\n\nTodd Young\n\nIowa\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nJoni Ernst\n\nKansas\n\nRoger Marshall\n\nKentucky\n\nMitch McConnell\n\nRand Paul\n\nLouisiana\n\nBill Cassidy\n\nMontana\n\nSteve Daines\n\nMississippi\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith\n\nMissouri\n\nJosh Hawley\n\nEric Schmitt\n\nNebraska\n\nDeb Fisher\n\nPete Ricketts\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nThom Tillis\n\nTed Budd\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nJohn Hoeven\n\nKevin Cramer\n\nOklahoma\n\nJames Lankford\n\nMarkwayne Mullin\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nJohn Thune\n\nMike Rounds\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nTexas\n\nJohn Cornyn\n\nTed Cruz\n\nUtah\n\nMike Lee\n\nWest Virginia\n\nShelley Moore Capito\n\nWisconsin\n\nRon Johnson\n\nWyoming\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nCynthia Lummis\n\n###\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund is an independent, nonpartisan, not-for-profit membership organization formed as the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Action Fund engages in educational, advocacy, and limited electoral activity, including grassroots organizing, legislative advocacy, and voter education."
