        "text": "The Crop Production report issued by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) forecasted corn production down from 2023 and soybean production up from last year. Corn production is down 1% from last year, forecast at 15.1 billion bushels; soybean growers are expected to increase their production 10% from 2023, forecast at a record high 4.59 billion bushels.\n\nAverage corn yield is forecast at record high 183.1 bushels per acre, up 5.8 bushels from last year. NASS also forecasts record high yields in Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin. As of Aug. 4, 67% of this year’s corn crop was reported in good or excellent condition, 10 percentage points above the same time last year.\n\nAs the cotton season progresses in Louisiana, there have been several reports of potassium deficiency. Potassium deficiency can weaken the plant, making it easier for plant pathogens to attack. It is very common to see fungal leaf spots on potassium stressed plants. Although pre-mature defoliation due to disease is possible, it is most likely the nutrient deficiency that is the leaf-dropping culprit.\n\nVickie Weeks joined 4-H when she was nine years old and has since been involved in the organization for six decades. Weeks was one of 12 honorees inducted into the Louisiana 4-H Hall of Fame during a ceremony held Aug. 10 at the Grant Walker 4-H Educational Center.\n\nThe LSU AgCenter Agricultural Leadership Development Program will continue to accept applications for Class XIX through Aug. 23. Once the applications have been received, an interview process will begin in September to select the class members.\n\nThe program was established in 1988 and helps educate its participants on ways to be a voice for agriculture on local, state and national levels. Bobby Soileau, program director, said class members will be exposed to a variety of critical agricultural issues and strategies that can be used to inform the public how the issues affect agriculture and the general populace.\n\nAugust is when marketing of our good Louisiana Spring-calves starts to increase. We have also seen the price for slaughter cows decrease slightly, from the highs of early Summer. Demand for ground beef continues to stay good and with school starting up coupled with Labor Day celebration, prices may increase. Continue to reduce the age of your cow herd during these times of high slaughter cow prices, so when the market “heads south” you have a young cow herd.\n\nUse of a herbicide as a desiccant in soybean has become popular to potentially improve harvest efficiency in Louisiana. Herbicides such as paraquat, Aim, Sharpen, and sodium chlorate are labeled for use in soybean as a desiccant, but paraquat is the most widely used. The paraquat label states at least 65% of pods should be mature (Figure 1) or moisture content should be 30% or less for indeterminate soybean varieties; and at least 50% of the leaves should have dropped and remaining leaves should be yellow for determinate varieties. Table 1 gives the harvest aid application timing label requirements for the labeled products in soybean.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers is introducing a bill that would require the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to provide more weekly and monthly reports on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.\n\nRep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., introduced the bill Sustainable Aviation Fuel Information Act with four other co-sponsors. The bill would require the more SAF weekly and monthly reports consistent with other reports published by the EIA.\n\nMore than 200 rice farmers, researchers, and industry partners gathered here yesterday, surrounded by golden yellow and green fields filled with FullPage® rice to commemorate RiceTec’s 25th anniversary and the enormous impact the company has had on the industry.\n\nDr. Brian Ottis, RiceTec’s director of U.S. marketing and product management, kicked off the event, welcoming attendees to the facility that had been turned into a small fair, with multiple food trucks, a beer wagon, and a stage with a local band that kept people’s feet tapping in celebration of the company’s contributions to agricultural innovation.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it is awarding nearly $4.1 million to organizations and outreach efforts to educate underserved, small-scale, and organic producers on farm risk management and climate-smart farm practices. The funding from USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) provides assistance through its Risk Management Education Partnerships for organizations, such as nonprofits and land grant universities, to develop training and resources for producers about risk management options.\n\nA new, free program offered by Daitaas and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Risk Management Agency aims to increase productivity and profitability for underserved farmers in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe TEAM Tilley Leaders Program allows qualified farmers to participate in a learn-by-doing program that combines financial and risk management education with robust proprietary technology using the farmers’ own financial data to deliver real results. The program is designed to demonstrate how the decisions farmers make throughout the growing season impact their bottom line and profitability.\n\nCrawfish season in Louisiana this year was heavily impacted by the summer drought in 2023, an arctic blast and rising costs for farmers.\n\nAnyone who wanted to buy live or boiled crawfish faced sky-high prices at retailers. Crawfish prices remained higher than usual through much of the season, selling for as much as almost $13 per pound at one point.\n\nAs the cotton season progresses in Louisiana, there have been several reports of potassium deficiency. Potassium deficiency can weaken the plant, making it easier for plant pathogens to attack. It is very common to see fungal leaf spots on potassium stressed plants. Although pre-mature defoliation due to disease is possible, it is most likely the nutrient deficiency that is the leaf-dropping culprit.\n\nThe LSU AgCenter will hold a field day focusing on best management practices for rice production Sept. 26 in Kaplan.\n\nThe event will showcase work AgCenter scientists are conducting through a grant from the Patrick F. Taylor Foundation. It will take place at one of the four model farms taking part in the grant project — Richard Farms, located at 5632 Louisiana Highway 700. Registration will begin at 9 a.m.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announces changes to the Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) Farm Loan Programs, effective Sept. 25, 2024 — changes that are intended to increase opportunities for farmers and ranchers to be financially viable. These improvements, part of the Enhancing Program Access and Delivery for Farm Loans rule, demonstrate USDA’s commitment to improving farm profitability through farm loans designed to provide important financing options used by producers to cover operating expenses and purchase land and equipment.\n\nLast week, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry’s Office of Soil and Water Conservation (LDAF-OSWC) visited two farms to learn about Best Management Practices (BMPs) on rice production agricultural lands to increase air and water quality, wildlife habitat, soil health, and more. The purpose of the visits was to film the story of implementing BMPs on the farm, and share the experience of two south Louisiana rice farming families. The resulting film will be released by the LDAF in the coming months.\n\nPeter Williams is one of four Democratic candidates aiming to represent Louisiana’s Congressional District 6.\n\nWilliams is up against current Democratic State Senator Cleo Fields, former Republican State Senator Elbert Guillory, Democratic newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson and Democrat Wilken Jones, Jr.\n\nA key focus for Williams is becoming a voice for the agriculture scene in District 6.\n\nThe heat in Acadiana over the past couple of weeks has been intense. There is concern about its effect on crops.\n\nWhen temperatures creep up into the triple digits, it's normally a bad thing for farmers, but since we've had so much rain from spring up to now in the summer months, that story is different.\n\nThe year 2024 is moving fast towards the quarter-century mark. Traveling in 32 states and engaging with many groups across the agricultural, economic, and business spectrums has provided insights on trends.\n\nEngagement with Mexican bankers at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Graduate School of Banking finds that purchases of farmland by foreign buyers is just not a U.S. issue."
