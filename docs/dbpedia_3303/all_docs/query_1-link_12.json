        "text": "April 30\n\nWith the Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired nearly 800,000 square miles of land, extending from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, including the area forming the present state of Arkansas.\n\nMay 5\n\nThe Senate approved a bill setting aside land in the Louisiana Territory between the St. Francis and Arkansas Rivers (present day Arkansas and Missouri) for military land bounties. These land grants were to be given in 160-acre parcels to soldiers and non-commissioned officers who served five years in the army, thereby encouraging settlement of the sparsely-populated region.\n\nMarch 1\n\nThe Senate passed \"An act establishing a separate territorial government in the southern part of the territory of Missouri.\" The bill became law the following day and created the Territory of Arkansas.\n\nJune 15\n\nArkansas became the 25th state in the Union.\n\nDecember 5\n\nWilliam S. Fulton of Little Rock and Ambrose H. Sevier of Lake Port presented their credentials and took their oaths of office as Arkansas' first two United States senators. The two senators then drew lots to determine class assignments. Senator Sevier drew Class 1, for a term to expire on March 3, 1837. Senator Fulton drew Class 3, for a term to expire on March 3, 1841.\n\nDecember 10\n\nAmbrose H. Sevier became chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, a position he held from 1840 to 1841, and again from 1845 to 1846.\n\nMarch 10\n\nChester Ashley of Little Rock, elected to the Senate in 1844, became chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, a position he held from 1845 to 1847.\n\nDecember 27\n\nThe Senate elected Ambrose H. Sevier as president pro tempore.\n\nDecember 14\n\nAmbrose H. Sevier became chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, a position he held from 1846 to 1848.\n\nFebruary 2\n\nThe U.S. signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the U.S.-Mexican War. Among the U.S. delegation to negotiate the treaty was Senator Ambrose H. Sevier. With the signing of the treaty, Mexico ceded to the United States the territory that now makes up the southwestern states. On March 15, Sevier resigned from the Senate to serve as minister to Mexico.\n\nMarch 8\n\nWilliam K. Sebastian of Helena, who began his Senate service in 1848, became chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, a position he held from 1853 to 1861.\n\nJanuary 21\n\nRobert W. Johnson of Pine Bluff briefly became chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs (today's Armed Services Committee). The chairman of the committee, Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, and its next ranking member, Senator Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama, had both withdrawn from the Senate on January 21 after their states had seceded from the Union.\n\nMay 6\n\nArkansas seceded from the Union.\n\nJuly 11\n\nThe Senate expelled William K. Sebastian of Helena and Charles B. Mitchel of Little Rock and declared Arkansas' Senate seats vacant. The state's two seats remained vacant until 1868.\n\nJune 23\n\nAfter Arkansas was allowed to resume representation in the U.S. Congress following the Civil War, Alexander McDonald and Benjamin F. Rice, both of Little Rock, took the oath of office as U.S. senators.\n\nMarch 6\n\nThe Senate confirmed the nomination of Senator Augustus H. Garland as attorney general. Garland resigned his Senate seat and served as attorney general for four years, through the first administration of President Grover Cleveland.\n\nMarch 26\n\nThe Senate passed a resolution of condemnation against Attorney General (and former senator) Augustus H. Garland following his refusal to provide information to a Senate committee.\n\nMarch 15\n\nJames K. Jones of Washington became chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, a position he held from 1893 to 1895.\n\nDecember 5\n\nSenator James K. Jones became chairman of the Democratic Conference, a position he held from 1899 to 1903.\n\nMarch 13\n\nThe Senate elected James P. Clarke of Little Rock as president pro tempore. Clarke served two separate terms as president pro tempore between 1913 and 1916.\n\nMarch 15\n\nJames P. Clarke became chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce (today's Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation), a position he held from 1913 to 1916.\n\nApril 8\n\nThe Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution went into effect allowing the election of U.S. senators by popular vote. James P. Clarke of Little Rock, a member since 1903, became Arkansas' first directly elected senator, winning reelection in 1914.\n\nCongress accepted a statue of Uriah M. Rose, one of Arkansas' two contributions to the National Statuary Hall Collection. The 7'6\" marble statue is the work of sculptor Frederic W. Ruckstuhl.\n\nCongress accepted a statue of James P. Clarke, the second of Arkansas' two contributions to the National Statuary Hall Collection. The 6'10\" marble statue is the work of artist Pompeo Coppini.\n\nDecember 3\n\nThe Senate Democratic Conference elected Joseph T. Robinson of Little Rock as floor leader, a position he held until his death on July 14, 1937. Robinson served as majority leader from 1933 to 1937. Simultaneously, he served as chairman of the Democratic Conference.\n\nNovember 6\n\nSenator Joseph T. Robinson ran unsuccessfully for vice president of the United States on the Democratic ticket with Alfred E. Smith.\n\nNovember 13\n\nHattie W. Caraway of Jonesboro was appointed by Arkansas governor Harvey Parnell to fill the seat left vacant by the death of her husband, Senator Thaddeus H. Caraway. Subsequently elected in a special election on January 12, 1932, she became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She was elected to a full term in 1932 and reelected in 1938, and served until January 3, 1945.\n\nAugust 1\n\nLong-shot Senate candidate Hattie Caraway began an extraordinary nine-day campaign tour across Arkansas with popular senator Huey P. Long of neighboring Louisiana. The highly publicized \"Hattie and Huey tour\" resulted in a landslide victory for Caraway.\n\nJuly 1\n\nCharles Watkins of Arkansas became the Senate's first official parliamentarian.\n\nAugust 12\n\nThe Senate acquired a portrait of Senator Joseph T. Robinson, who died in office on July 14, 1937. The portrait was painted by Nicholas Brewer in 1934, shortly after the senator's selection as majority leader.\n\nNovember\n\nWithout ceremony, an oil portrait of Illinois senator J. Hamilton Lewis by Arkansas native Louis Betts was hung in the U.S. Capitol. The exact date that Betts painted the portrait is unknown, but it was likely copied from a 1940 photograph of Lewis.\n\nOctober 19\n\nOn October 19, 1943, for the first time, a woman formally took up the gavel as the Senate's presiding officer. In the absence of the vice president and the president pro tempore, the secretary of the Senate read a letter assigning the duties of the chair to Arkansas Democrat Hattie W. Caraway.\n\nFebruary 8\n\nThe Senate elected Leslie Biffle, who grew up in Piggott, Arkansas, as secretary of the Senate, a position he held from February 8, 1945, to January 4, 1947, and again from January 3, 1949, to January 3, 1953.\n\nJanuary 15\n\nJohn L.

William Fulbright became chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, a position he held until 1974. As chair of this influential committee, Fulbright conducted \"educational hearings\" on America's role in the Vietnam War in the late 1960s and early 1970s, criticizing the presidential administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon and influencing public opinion.\n\nMay 6\n\nJohn L. McClellan became Arkansas's longest-serving senator, surpassing the record of 24 years, 4 months, and 1 day set by Joseph T. Robinson in 1937. McClellan went on to serve for 34 years and 11 months.\n\nAugust 2\n\nJohn L. McClellan became chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, a position he held from 1971 to 1979.

Caraway was featured on a U.S. postage stamp, one of the \"Great Americans\" series.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nSenator Mark Pryor of Little Rock delivered George Washington's Farewell Address on the floor of the Senate, a tradition dating back to the 1880s.\n\nSeptember 6\n\nSenator Tom Cotton of Dardanelle received the Golden Gavel Award for presiding over the Senate for 100 hours in a single Congress.
