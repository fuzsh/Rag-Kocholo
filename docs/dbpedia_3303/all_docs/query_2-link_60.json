        "text": "Katie Britt and Roger Wicker introduce resolution to designate August as National Catfish Month\n\nU.S. Senators Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville recently joined Senator Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and 10 colleagues in introducing a resolution to designate August 2023 as National Catfish Month. This resolution recognizes the importance of the U.S. catfish to our economy and praises catfish farmers and industry workers for their contributions. “Nearly 33% of all catfish produced in the United States comes from right here in sweet home Alabama,” said Sen. Britt. “Catfish is a vital part of our state’s economy, and I will always support our hardworking farmers and processors. I’m proud to join my colleagues in bringing forward this resolution to recognize the catfish industry’s contributions to our state and country.” “Mississippi is recognized across the country for our farm-raised catfish production, which helps provide American families with a fresh, local, and delicious source of fish,” Wicker said. “Designating the month of August as National Catfish Month would recognize catfish producers for their work to support this industry that contributes almost $2 billion to our national economy.” Sens. Britt, Tuberville, and Wicker were joined on the resolution by Sens. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi). The full text of the resolution states: “Whereas the Catfish Institute recognizes August to be National Catfish Month; Whereas the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas recognize August to be National Catfish Month; Whereas the States of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Tennessee embody the Channel Catfish as their State Fish; Whereas the farm-raised catfish industry in the United States employs over 9,000 people and contributes almost $2,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States; Whereas the United States has 55,855 surface water acres used for catfish production in 2023, and catfish growers in the United States had $447,039,000 in sales during 2022; Whereas the average catfish farmer produces 6,800 pounds of catfish per acre; Whereas 99 percent of all United States farm-raised catfish are grown in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas; Whereas catfish is the largest farm-raised seafood product, by weight, in the United States, representing more than 50 percent of the food fish produced by the United States aquaculture industry; Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are consistently high quality and, unlike ocean-caught fish, are available all year long; Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are a sustainable and environmentally friendly seafood product; Whereas catfish is a lean fish and an excellent source of protein; and Whereas catfish is a versatile fish in cuisine of the United States, with a myriad of regional and national recipes to be enjoyed by all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates August 2023 as ‘‘National Catfish Month’’; (2) recognizes the contributions of all workers, past and present, that produce, process, and provide catfish for the people of the United States; and (3) recognizes that purchasing United States farm-raised catfish supports farmers, jobs, and the economy of the United States.” Over the last 25 years, American catfish farmers have faced increasing pressures from foreign competitors as imports of foreign catfish and catfish-like products have increased exponentially in the U.S. Katie Britt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022.

John Cornyn (R-Texas) and five colleagues in introducing a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to strike down President Biden’s Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule. The Biden Administration’s rule purports to take a hard line on illegal migration. However, the senators argue the rule is riddled with exceptions and funnels migrants into unlawful parole programs that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has set up without Congress’ consent to allow more migrants with weak or non-existent asylum claims to enter the United States. “As the border disaster rages on, the Biden Administration continues to unilaterally install irresponsible policies that weaken our national security and disregard the rule of law,” said Sen. Britt. “President [Joe] Biden’s Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule is a transparent attempt to reclassify illegal migration as legal immigration so that the unprecedented numbers at the border appear better on paper than they are in reality.” “Last month, encounters at the border jumped by 30%,” Britt continued. “The Administration is clearly unserious about ending this crisis, as they are pulling 1,100 active duty personnel from the border while daily encounters continue to rise steadily. This rule is just the latest in a series of dangerous and unserious policies that allow transnational criminal organizations like the cartels to illegally traffic deadly drugs into our communities, schools, and homes. It’s time for the Administration to actually secure the border – not let more people into our country’s interior under different terminology.” “Joe Biden can’t run from his record on the border,” said Sen. Tuberville. “He single-handedly caused the worst border crisis in our history, flooding our country with some 5 million illegal border crossings and unprecedented quantities of deadly drugs. His latest rule might score political points, but it’s riddled with loopholes and won’t actually protect our country. I’m proud to join my colleagues today to stand up and stop it.” “The Biden administration’s rule is an unserious attempt at resolving the border crisis and is full of loopholes that the cartels will easily exploit to continue moving unlawful migrants into the United States and overwhelm our Border Patrol,” Sen. Cornyn said. “Rather than stop unlawful migration, President Biden is using this rule to funnel the migrants into unlawful parole programs, and this resolution would put an end to this shell game to hide an unprecedented level of illegal immigration.” Sens Britt, Tuberville, and Cornyn were joined on the resolution by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Ted Budd (R-North Carolina), Steve Daines (R-Montana), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi). The Biden Administration’s Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule went into effect on the same day the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 public health order expired on May 11, 2023. This rule funnels migrants into one of three “lawful” pathways, including: The Sens. claim that the first two pathways constitute an abuse of the DHS Secretary’s parole authority, which under our immigration law is only to be used on a true case-by-case basis. The Senators further claim that illegal immigrants and the transnational criminal organizations that take advantage of them will quickly learn to exploit these loopholes and overwhelm our detention facilities as Border Patrol attempts to adjudicate whether migrants fall into one of the numerous exceptions. Katie Britt is the Ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.

The Sens. Claim that the Biden policy funnels illegal immigrants into unlawful parole programs that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established without Congress’ consent. This funneling effect has allowed and encouraged more people with weak or non-existent asylum claims to enter the U.S. “Joe Biden can’t run from his record on the border,” said Sen. Tuberville. “He single-handedly caused the worst border crisis in our history, flooding our country with some 5 million illegal border crossings and unprecedented quantities of deadly drugs. His latest rule might score political points, but it’s riddled with loopholes and won’t actually protect our country. I’m proud to join my colleagues today to stand up and stop it.” “Folks, this is having real implications on real people, and the only people that are benefiting from Joe Biden’s failed policies are not Americans, not these migrants,” Sen. Britt said recently. “We need the American people to stand up and stand with us and say ‘enough is enough.’ When you think about these 300,000 unaccompanied children that have come across — let me tell you something. I’m a Momma. Do you think I’m going to let my child wander in hopes that someone finds them on the other side of the border? Absolutely not.” “I have talked to these young women, and it wasn’t that they were raped every day,” said Britt. “It was how many times a day they were raped. Folks, this has real implications. You look at the real stories of a 13-year-old boy who is being sent to be a day laborer all day long. He’s not living the American Dream. He’s paying back what his parents owe, or he promised to a drug cartel.” “The Biden administration’s rule is an unserious attempt at resolving the border crisis and is full of loopholes that the cartels will easily exploit to continue moving unlawful migrants into the United States and overwhelm our Border Patrol,” said Sen. Cornyn.“Rather than stop unlawful migration, President Biden is using this rule to funnel the migrants into unlawful parole programs, and this resolution would put an end to this shell game to hide an unprecedented level of illegal immigration.” The Biden administration’s Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule went into effect on the same day the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Title 42 public health order expired, on May 11, 2023. This rule funnels illegal immigrants into one of three “lawful” pathways: 1. The administration’s program to grant parole to up to 30,000 Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans per month, as well as other parole programs the administration has recently set up or expanded. 2. The administration’s “CBP One” mobile app, through which people can make appointments to enter at land ports of entry, where they may be paroled into the interior and given work permits; 3. Seeking asylum at any place or time after having applied for and denied asylum in a third country. The GOP Senators claim that the first two of these three pathways constitute an unlawful abuse of the DHS Secretary’s parole authority, which, under our immigration law, is only to be used on a true case-by-case basis.

U.S. Senator Katie Britt joined U.S. Senator John Cornyn, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville, and 37 Republican colleagues to introduce the Back the Blue Act. The announcement coincided with the annual observance of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week. This legislation will strengthen existing laws that protect police officers, increase the criminal penalties for individuals who target law enforcement, and expand the tools that police can use to protect themselves. “Today, we honor the courageous law enforcement officers who have valiantly made the ultimate sacrifice,” Sen. Britt said. “Every single day, the brave men and women of law enforcement go above and beyond to serve and protect our communities. It is essential that we not only support our police, but we respect the rule of law in our country. I’m proud to join Senator Cornyn and my colleagues in introducing the Back the Blue Act, and I will always stand with our police officers in Alabama and across the country.” “The Back the Blue Act adds stiff, mandatory penalties and makes it a federal crime to kill – or attempt to kill – a law enforcement officer, a federal judge, or a federally funded public safety officer,” Sen. Cornyn said. “We must make it absolutely clear that violence against them will not be tolerated. In honor of National Police Week, we honor the brave men and women who protect us, we pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and we commit to doing everything in our power to ensure that they have all the resources they need to keep our people safe.” “Today marks the start of National Police Week,” Sen. Tuberville said on Twitter. “America’s brave men and women in blue wake up every day prepared to sacrifice their own safety in service to their fellow Americans. It is more important than ever that we show our support. To all who protect and serve, thank you.” In addition to Senators Britt, Tuberville, and Cornyn, this legislation is cosponsored by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), and Senators Ted Cruz, Thom Tillis, Rick Scott, Jerry Moran, Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer, Marsha Blackburn, John Boozman, Deb Fischer, Shelley Moore Capito, Mike Crapo, Marco Rubio, Jim Risch, Pete Ricketts, Steve Daines, John Barrasso, James Lankford, Cindy Hyde-Smith, John Kennedy, Tom Cotton, John Thune, John Hoeven, Ted Budd, Josh Hawley, Tim Scott, Bill Hagerty, Roger Marshall, Bill Cassidy, Joni Ernst, Chuck Grassley, Todd Young, Eric Schmitt, Cynthia Lummis, and Roger Wicker. The Back the Blue Act has been introduced in Congress multiple times since 2017. Senator Britt is also a cosponsor of Senator Braun’s Thin Blue Line Act, which expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in capital punishment determinations to also include killing or targeting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responders.

To say that this responsibility is an honor of a lifetime would be an understatement. I continue to be humbled by the people of Alabama’s trust, confidence, and prayers, and as your Senator, I am working to make you proud every single day. Alabama sent a mom to the U.S. Senate to actually get things done, and I am happy to report that I hit the ground running immediately to do just that. From the minute I was sworn into office on January 3, I took the fight for faith, family, and freedom to Washington, D.C., as my team and I have been laser-focused on advocating for our people, our liberties, our values, and our interests. While we are off to a fast start, these past 100 days have also made it crystal clear, we have a lot more work ahead of us. In my first week as your Senator, I traveled to the Del Rio Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border in my first official trip to witness President Joe Biden’s border disaster firsthand. What I witnessed on that trip was gut-wrenching and reaffirmed that we truly have an unprecedented national security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border. This trip was an important opportunity for me to listen to and learn from the people who are facing this every single day, from boots-on-the-ground law enforcement officers to courageous survivors of the cartels’ human and drug trafficking. Following this trip, I joined Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) in introducing the “Stop Taxpayer Funding of Traffickers Act” to ensure human and drug traffickers are not subsidized by hardworking American taxpayers while these criminals await prosecution and conviction. In February, I joined Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and a bicameral congressional delegation to visit the epicenter of fentanyl trafficking in the San Diego Border Sector, where we also met with Border Patrol Council leaders. We then traveled to Mexico City to hear from top leaders in the Mexican military about the latest tactics being used by cartels and other criminals to avoid detection, capture, and prosecution while trafficking lethal drugs through Mexican territory and international waters to the United States. Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) also afforded me the opportunity to visit the border for a third time in March in the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas, where we heard about the 488% annual surge in Chinese nationals attempting to illegally enter our country. Taking what I learned and experienced across my visits, my team and I worked hard to formulate and introduce tangible solutions in a package of four pieces of legislation aimed at sealing and securing our nation’s southern border, keeping American communities and families safe, and ultimately ending the ongoing crisis. This legislation includes the “Keep Our Communities Safe Act” to close Obama-Biden catch-and-release policies, the “Asylum Abuse Reduction Act” to fix America’s broken asylum process, and the “WALL Act” to complete building the wall on the southern border. I have cosponsored nine additional bills related to border security, including Senator Marsha Blackburn’s (R-Tenn.) Stop Taxpayer Funding of Traffickers Act; Senator Chuck Grassley’s (R-Iowa) Immigration Parole Reform Act of 2023 and Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act; Senator Ted Budd’s (R-N.C.) Build the Wall Now Act; Senator Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) No Coyote Cash Act and Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act; Senator Mike Lee’s (R-Utah) Stopping Border Surges Act; Senator Tommy Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) Border Safety and Security Act; and Senator John Kennedy’s (R-La.) Fairness in Fentanyl Sentencing Act of 2023. In addition to those nine bills, I have cosponsored 60 pieces of legislation thus far in the 118th Congress. This is the most of any United States Senator in this timeframe, underscoring the urgency with which my team and I have approached this incredible responsibility. These five dozen pieces of legislation span a wide range of pressing issues facing hardworking Alabamians – they would bolster American energy independence, lower taxes, combat inflation and our runaway national debt, slash burdensome red tape, safeguard the sanctity of life, uphold the rule of law, protect the ability of girls and young women to compete in sports, defend the right to work, support our tremendous law enforcement officers, strengthen our supply chains, fortify Americans’ retirement savings, hold elected officials accountable to the people, advance election integrity, stand up for our family farmers, and much more. Already, 13 of these measures passed the Senate, including three that reached President Biden’s desk. One of my top priorities, ​​especially as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, has been to stand up to the Biden Administration’s dangerously weak national security policies. There is no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party is our greatest geopolitical and national security threat, and everything they do is as our adversary. From stealing our intellectual property and spying on our children through TikTok, to buying up American farmland near military installations and engaging in unfair trade practices that undercut Alabama steelmakers and shrimpers, we must hold the CCP accountable. Defending hardworking Americans and protecting our homeland is not a responsibility I take lightly, which is why I have joined my colleagues in introducing five pieces of legislation holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for their continued aggression. This includes cosponsoring a bipartisan resolution condemning the unlawful incursion into the United States airspace by the People’s Republic of China high-altitude surveillance balloon, and the Foreign Adversary Risk Management (FARM) Act, introduced by Senator Tuberville, which would crack down on the CCP’s growing ownership of U.S. farmland and agricultural companies. I have also cosponsored the Cutting-off Communist Profiteers (CCP) Act, prohibiting any former U.S. presidential appointees from knowingly representing, aiding, or advising the Chinese Communist Party or Chinese military companies, and the Protecting America from Spies Act, targeting Chinese Communist Party spies that are committing espionage toward American technology firms and businesses. Most recently, I joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in introducing the “Not One More Inch or Acre Act,” legislation that would prevent any Chinese national or entity from owning American land. I believe that the\n\nKatie Britt backs balanced budget amendment\n\nU.S. Senator Katie Britt joined U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and 22 additional Senate cosponsors in introducing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution to force the President and Congress to pass annual balanced budgets. The joint resolution, S.J.Res.13, proposes a constitutional amendment to establish requirements for the submission and approval of annual balanced budgets, including guidelines regarding exceeding spending caps and raising taxes. “Our ballooning national debt is already an economic and security crisis,” said Sen. Britt. “Just this week, President [Joe] Biden proposed an unserious budget that would continue to recklessly pile this burden on the backs of our children and our children’s children. Alabama families balance their household budgets every day, and we must expect the federal government to do the same. It is past time to hold Washington accountable for runaway, wasteful spending that is fueling inflation and endangering our nation’s future.” “A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would compel our nation’s leaders and the American people to make difficult choices to get our fiscal house in order,” said Sen. Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee along with Britt. “Our national response to the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated federal spending at a rate that compounds our already serious debt problems. The new deficit spending is a necessary answer to a national health emergency, but it would be completely irresponsible not to establish a strong framework from which to tackle our nation’s long-term fiscal problems—and ultimately the future of this great country.” The legislation would amend the U.S. Constitution to: • Require the President to submit a balanced budget and Congress to pass a balanced budget • Restrict federal spending to 18% of the Gross Domestic Product • Require a two-thirds majority votes in both the House and Senate to raise taxes • Require a new three-fifths majority vote in both houses of Congress to raise the debt limit On Thursday, President Biden released an outline of his Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposal, which would raise taxes by $4.7 trillion and see the gross national debt rise to $50.7 trillion by 2033. Sens. Britt and Hyde-Smith were both critical of that budget, which made no serious effort to cut the deficit. “President Biden’s budget proposal is completely out of touch with the harsh reality hardworking Alabamians are facing every day of his term,” said Senator Britt. “Prices have already skyrocketed 14.4% since he took office, while Americans’ personal savings have fallen to a nearly 15-year low. Today, President Biden confirmed that he wants to raise taxes and spend more. His unserious, yet unsurprising, budget proposal only doubles down on the failed tax-and-spend agenda fueling this kitchen table crisis. The people of Alabama know that the federal government does not have a revenue problem; this Administration has a spending problem.” “The best thing about President Biden’s 2024 budget wish list is that it’s dead on arrival,” said Hyde-Smith. “It is not the serious fiscal blueprint that we need as a nation to deal with the national debt, deficits, national defense, and other critical problems facing the American people. Instead, the President and his administration seem to be divorced from reality by producing a budget plan that doubles down on the runaway spending and taxes that characterized the first half of the Biden presidency.” President Biden defended his budget. “My budget will deliver funding to help us lead the world again,” Biden claimed. “My budget also invests in critical issues that matter to families — increasing the supply of affordable housing, lower rental costs, and making it easier to buy a home — all of which will generate economic growth and prosperity.” “I said to my introducer — he said, “I bought a small home, and I worked on it.” I said, “Guess what? That’s how every middle-class family came to be,” Biden continued. “Why? Because you build equity in that home. And after two years, five years, ten years, you may have $10-, $20-, $30,000 in equity. You can borrow against it to send a kid to school. You can borrow against it to do a lot of things.” “And so, folks, look, MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding the police departments and defunding the FBI now,” Biden said. “That’s a good one. I like that one. Well, guess what? And they refuse to provide funding that is going to keep communities safe and secure. We talk about he- — about crime. Well, it’s outra- — My budget invests in public safety. It includes funding for more training, more support for law enforcement at a time when they’re expected to pay ma- — play many roles.” The White House claims that the President’s budget will cut the deficit by $3 trillion over the next ten years, but at no time in that decade would the budget ever be balanced. The national debt is $32 trillion now and is climbing. Congress has not passed a balanced budget in 23 years. Katie Britt is in her first term representing Alabama in the U.S. Senate. Her predecessor, Richard Shelby, introduced a balanced budget amendment every one of the 36 years he was in the Senate, and it never did pass.

The reintroduction of this legislation comes as the U.S. Department of Education is moving forward to implement new rules in May that would allow biological males to compete in girls’ and women’s sports beginning in the 2023-2024 school year. “50 years ago, we discovered a winning strategy for all of America’s female athletes: Title IX. Signed into law in 1972, the 37 words of this relatively simple legislation empowered women to win by leveling the playing field and providing them access to the same athletic opportunities that their male counterparts enjoyed,” Tuberville wrote. “That level playing field is now under attack by activists who care more about politics than what’s best for female athletes.” “We must protect women’s sports. That is why I reintroduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act yesterday to push back against the far left’s attempts to destroy women’s sports and preserve the opportunities they have provided female athletes for half a century,” Tuberville explained.” My legislation would require institutions to recognize an athlete’s gender as what it was at birth and stop giving federal funding to any program or institution that allows biological males in women’s sports.” “Last year, on the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the Department of Education proposed a new rule to allow biological males to compete in women’s sports, citing the change as more ‘inclusive.’” Tuberville continued. “I submitted a public comment to the proposed rule change and discussed seeing the positive impacts of Title IX firsthand, four years after its enactment, while coaching girls’ basketball at Hermitage High School in Arkansas. But like those of many other athletes, coaches, educators, and parents, my concerns were ignored by Secretary Miguel Cardona as the Department of Education charged ahead with plans to finalize this change in May.” “There is nothing inclusive about forcing female athletes who train all their lives in hopes of achieving first place to instead compete for second, third, and fourth place because the top spot is invariably taken by athletes who have obvious physical advantages associated with their gender,” Tuberville said. “Biological men have won 28 women’s sports titles since 2003. This number will only increase when the boundaries are completely removed.” Tuberville appeared on Fox and Friends to defend women’s sports. Specifically, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act will: Ensure Title IX provisions treat gender as “recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” Ban recipients of federal funding from operating, sponsoring, or facilitating athletic programs that permit a male to participate in a women’s sporting event. The legislation is endorsed by Independent Women’s Voice, Concerned Women for America, and Heritage Action for America. Carrie Lukas is the vice president of Independent Women’s Voice. “More than 50 years ago, Congress enacted Title IX to ensure equal opportunity in all aspects of education, including athletics,” said Lukas. “But without single-sex teams and single-sex competition, equal athletic opportunity is but a farce. Forcing female athletes to compete against biological males is unfair. But it’s also discriminatory. Allowing biological males to take awards, roster spots, scholarships, or spots at a school from female athletes violates Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination ‘on the basis of sex.’ The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act will help preserve equal athletic opportunity for both sexes. IWV is thankful for Senator Tuberville’s leadership on this important issue.” Penny Nance is the CEO and President of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee – the largest women’s policy organization. “We have championed the cause of a fair playing field for female athletes for years,” said Nance. “Understanding the importance of sports, Coach Tommy Tuberville has proven to be a leader on the issue. It’s time for Congress to stop injustice and discrimination against female student-athletes in their own sports. Our Young Women for America leaders have experienced the embarrassment of competing against men and are fighting this battle on their college campuses. Passing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act is a top priority. Never again should female athletes lose their trophies, their scholarships, and their dignity to males.” Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action for America, stated. “By ignoring the biological differences between men and women and forcing women to compete against men in sports, the Left is threatening to limit women’s opportunities on and off the field. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act protects women’s physical safety and scholarship opportunities by making it illegal for a recipient of federal funds who operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs to allow men to participate in women’s athletic teams or programs. Heritage Action supports the passage of this essential legislation and thanks Senator Tuberville for leading the fight in the Senate to protect women’s safety, privacy, and opportunities.” Joining Tuberville as original cosponsors are U.S. Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kansas), Ted Budd (R-North Carolina), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Steve Daines (R-Montana), and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri). Tommy Tuberville spent decades as a teacher and coach prior to his election to the Senate in 2020.

The two Alabama Republicans joined in a letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure formally requesting a four-year extension of the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy, which allows hospitals in rural areas to compete for and retain high-quality staff by increasing reimbursements to hospitals in rural areas with lower overall wages. Without action, Medicare payments to these hospitals will reduce after September 30, 2023. Sen. Britt is a member of the subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. “Our rural families and communities depend on the medical services and potentially life-saving treatments that local hospitals provide,” said Sen. Britt. “Every Alabamian deserves access to quality care and the opportunity to thrive in safe, strong communities – no matter their zip code.” The four-year AWI adjustment by CMS for bottom quartile hospitals was first passed by the Trump administration in August 2019. Then, Sens. Richard Shelby and Doug Jones represented Alabama in the Senate. “For two decades, Alabama has been fighting the unfair Medicare reimbursements and today receives a rate that is just 67 percent of the national average,” Sen. Jones explained in 2019. “This rule adjustment will bring balance to Medicare reimbursement for Alabama, particularly our rural hospitals and hospitals across the country,” explained then-Sen. Shelby. “For years, I’ve been working with Alabama’s hospitals and the delegation to advocate for increased Medicare reimbursements for Alabama’s hospitals, which are currently reimbursed at the lowest rates in the country,” Congresswoman Terri Sewell stated when the rule was passed. “Today’s announcement is great news for Alabama’s hospitals, especially those in rural areas of the state where every dollar counts. With over 88 percent of rural Alabama hospitals operating in the red, it is critical that we do everything we can to help our hospitals provide the services needed to keep Alabamians healthy. Recalculating the way Medicare reimburses Alabama hospitals is a crucial step in achieving that goal.” “Unfortunately, due to disruptions in the marketplace caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not had the opportunity to see the true impact of the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy envisioned by CMS,” the Senators wrote in their letter. “Extending the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy for four additional years will allow hospitals and the agency to better understand the policy’s true impact in a more normal environment.” Senators Britt and Tuberville were joined by Senators Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), and Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas). Without a renewal and extension of the rule, CMS will revert back to compensating rural hospitals at 60 to 75% of the rates as hospitals in many major metropolitan areas based on the assumption that the cost of living and, thus, wages are less in the rural areas. The difficulty with that theory is that there is an intense nationwide competition for medical professionals who all go to the same medical and nursing schools. Rural hospitals already struggle to hire competent medical professionals due to the small rural populations. This means fewer patients seeking care, particularly specialized care, than in a major city hospital. If Medicare and Medicaid reimburse those hospitals for significantly less than the major hospitals will, then attracting and retaining staff at the rural hospitals becomes problematic.

U.S. Senators Katie Britt, Marsha Blackburn, and Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced legislation to ensure that persons charged with human and drug traffickers cannot continue to draw federal benefits while they await prosecution and conviction. The Senators introduced the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Traffickers Act following their recent visit to the Del Rio Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. Britt said that the amount of fentanyl seized in Birmingham alone last year reportedly was enough to kill every single person in the state of Alabama. During the first two months of the 2022 school year, Alabama schools had to administer Narcan 15 times because a student had overdosed on an opioid. “American taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize the monsters who are taking advantage of the Biden Administration’s border crisis to traffic vulnerable people and deadly drugs,” said Senator Britt. “These criminals are causing untold suffering in every corner of our country — stealing lives, destroying families, and devastating communities at record rates. It is time to seal and secure the border and end the incentives and loopholes that are fueling the crisis. I am grateful for Senator Blackburn’s continued leadership on this critical topic.” “For two years, President Biden’s open border policies have emboldened the cartels and caused human trafficking to grow to a $13 billion industry, with criminal cartels earning up to $14 million each day,” said Sen. Blackburn. “Last year alone, law enforcement seized over 14,000 pounds of fentanyl at the border, enough to kill over 3.3 billion people. We cannot continue to incentivize this blatant criminal activity. This legislation ensures that hardworking American taxpayers – already crushed by inflation – are not forced to fund the lifestyles of offenders who are making our country more dangerous.” .@SenKatieBritt blasts Biden admin for “gut-wrenching” humanitarian crisis along southern border pic.twitter.com/0xd32JL7Ah — Connect to Congress (@SinclairC2C) February 16, 2023 “Entire communities are destroyed at the hands of drug and human traffickers, and it’s appalling that some of those very communities’ tax dollars go toward putting up these criminals in government housing,” said Senator Hyde-Smith. “This legislation would ensure that traffickers can’t enjoy such government benefits after they’ve been charged for drug or human trafficking offenses.” Sen. Mike Braun is a co-sponsor of the legislation. Congresswoman Kat Cammack led the legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. “Over the last two years, we’ve seen the horrific consequences of the Biden Border Crisis, including the devastating toll on our communities nationwide from drug and human trafficking,” Cammack said. “In Marion County, Florida, our sheriff’s department has recovered bricks of fentanyl with stamps from border cartels, alongside pill presses and sophisticated distribution plans. Our first responders gear up each day to save lives from fentanyl overdoses occurring almost daily, putting their own lives at risk,” said Representative Cammack. “Those responsible for trafficking drugs and people into our country at our borders and in our waters should not receive federal assistance after violating our laws—not only is it wrong, but it rewards those who have perpetuated this deadly crisis. I’m pleased to join Senator Blackburn on this effort and look forward to growing this legislation’s support with my colleagues.” Mark Dannels is the Sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona, on the U.S. southern border. “As a border Sheriff, I have witnessed the senseless tragedies on our southern border at the evil control of ruthless and violent criminal transnational organizations, i.e., cartels,” said Dannels. “These cartels exploit their criminal enterprise based on fear, violence, and greed. I support and commend [the] efforts to pass legislation for those directly responsible in these types of criminal acts that violate Public Safety – National Security and Humanitarian offenses.” Even after offenders are charged with federal drug and human trafficking offenses, many of them continue to live in government housing and receive other government benefits while they persist in exploiting and trafficking women and children or smuggling drugs across the border. The Stop Taxpayer Funding of Traffickers Act would prohibit anyone charged with drug or human trafficking at our international borders or in our territorial waters from receiving federal government benefits. It would define “drug trafficking offense” as any federal offense that includes as an element the distribution of a controlled substance. It defines “human trafficking offense” as a range of offenses, including smuggling, transporting, and harboring individuals. The legislation would define “federal benefit” to include the issuance of any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States, as well as any retirement, welfare, Social Security, health, disability, veterans, or public housing benefit. If the charges are later dismissed, or the accused is found not guilty by a jury of their peers, then the legislation provides for back payment of benefits to any individual deprived of benefits under this section. Britt was named as the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.

Tuberville. ‘Through its decision to permit no-test, mail-order abortions after a telemedicine visit, the FDA has abandoned its dual obligations to protect the public and vulnerable populations from harm and to comply with Federal law, including Federal requirements to protect patient safety and longstanding Federal criminal laws which expressly prohibit the mailing and shipping of abortion drugs.’ Tuberville has been a leading voice on pro-life issues in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, just last week, Senator Tuberville cosponsored a bill to establish a permanent ban on using federal taxpayer dollars for abortion. On January 3rd, 2023, the FDA released new guidance removing in-person dispensing requirements for chemical abortion drugs such as mifepristone, making self-administered abortion drugs permanently available by mail or through certain pharmacies. Tuberville and the other lawmakers sent a detailed letter to Commissioner Califf explaining their view on the policy and legal faults in the FDA decision, citing it as “dangerous, reckless, and illegal.” They claim that the new policy: · Threatens the health and safety of pregnant mothers by eliminating the requirement for in-person dispensing, increasing risks of potentially life-threatening complications without an in-person screening. · Violates the FDA’s legal obligations to protect the safety of women and girls. · Violates longstanding federal criminal laws barring the mailing and shipping of abortion drugs. · Imperils the conscience rights of pharmacists by failing to provide protections for pharmacists who do not want to participate in the practice of abortion. “Through its decision to permit no-test, mail-order abortions after a telemedicine visit, the FDA has abandoned its dual obligations to protect the public and vulnerable populations from harm and to comply with Federal law, including Federal requirements to protect patient safety and longstanding Federal criminal laws which expressly prohibit the mailing and shipping of abortion drugs,” Tuberville and the other lawmakers wrote. “We therefore insist that the FDA pull the deadly drug mifepristone from the market, or, at minimum, promptly restore and further strengthen the initial basic health and safety requirements for abortion drugs, and comply with Federal criminal law.” The positions outlined in the letter have been endorsed by the SBA Pro-Life America, Americans United for Life, CatholicVote, March for Life, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Right to Life, Concerned Women for America, Heritage Action, Students for Life of America, Family Research Council, Scholars with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Family Policy Alliance, and Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. Tuberville was joined in the letter to Commissioner Califf by U.S. Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith, James Lankford, Steve Daines, Jim Risch, Mike Crapo, Marsha Blackburn, John Hoeven, J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, Rick Scott, Roger Marshall, Kevin Cramer, Roger Wicker, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, John Thune, Bill Hagerty, Todd Young, Markwayne Mullen, Mike Braun, Deb Fischer, Ted Budd, Josh Hawley, along with 54 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Last December, the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released an opinion saying the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver abortion drugs, even to mailing addresses in states that decided to prohibit access to chemical abortion pills by mail as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs versus the Jackson Women’s Health Organization that reversed the controversial Roe v. Wade decision. The letter to Garland claims that the DOJ’s memo violates existing laws. “It is disappointing, yet not surprising, that the Biden administration’s DOJ has not only abdicated its Constitutional responsibility to enforce the law but also has once again twisted the plain meaning of the law in an effort to promote the taking of unborn life. The OLC memo should be immediately rescinded or, at minimum, redrafted to articulate an accurate application of the law,” Tuberville and the members wrote. The second letter is supported by the Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Students for Life, Family Policy Alliance, Americans United for Life, CatholicVote, Scholars with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Heritage Action, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, Family Research Council, March for Life, and SBA Prolife America. Senator Tuberville represents Alabama in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Armed Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and HELP Committees. He is serving his first term in the Senate after unseating incumbent Sen. Doug Jones in the 2020 election.

This legislation would establish a single, government-wide standard to permanently prohibit the flow of federal funding for abortion. “The vast majority of Alabamians do not want their hard-earned dollars funding elective abortions in California and New York,” Britt stated. “The Hyde Amendment has saved an estimated 2.5 million lives – approximately half the population of Alabama,” said Sen. Britt. “Sadly, radicals in the Democratic Party continue to trumpet their calls for abortion at any time, for any reason. They have now targeted the long-standing, bipartisan Hyde Amendment, annually passed by Congress since 1976, which ensures federal taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions. It is time to make the Hyde Amendment and its lifesaving protections permanent so the far-left does not attempt to hold the nation hostage every year. The vast majority of Alabamians do not want their hard-earned dollars funding elective abortions in California or New York. I will continue to fight to defend life, support parents, grow opportunities for hardworking families, and preserve the American Dream for our children and our children’s children.” “Most Americans do not want their hard-earned tax dollars being used for abortion-on-demand, but our current patchwork of regulations has brought years of uncertainty,” stated Sen. Wicker. “The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would simplify federal rules, ensuring that American tax dollars are never used for the destruction of innocent, unborn life.” This legislation would make permanent the restrictions on funding for elective abortion and elective abortion coverage, including the Hyde Amendment, which currently relies on yearly approval. It would also eliminate Obamacare’s taxpayer subsidies for elective abortion coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges through refundable tax credits. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) also co-sponsored the legislation. “Millions of hardworking Americans believe that life begins at conception and don’t want their taxpayer dollars inadvertently funding abortions,” said Sen. Tuberville. “As a Christian and as a conservative, I share their belief that every life is sacred and every American has a right to life. That’s why I’m proud to sign on to this legislation that will solidify abortion funding restrictions that have been in place for decades and better protect the unborn.” Britt, Tuberville, and Wicker joined Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Ted Budd (R-North Carolina), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Eric Schmitt (R-Missouri), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis, (R-North Carolina), John Thune (R-South Dakota), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), and Todd Young (R-Indiana). With Democrats in control of the Senate, it is unlikely that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will allow this bill to even be introduced on the Senate floor.

Sens. Britt and Tuberville have co-sponsored bipartisan resolutions authored by Senator Tim Scott that would formally designate this week as “National School Choice Week” and celebrates educational freedom and excellence throughout our country. “This National School Choice Week, let’s recommit to ensuring that every single child across Alabama and our nation has the opportunity to unlock the American Dream through a high-quality education,” said Sen. Britt. “No child’s zip code should determine their destiny. School choice empowers families with the freedom to make important decisions to help their children achieve their full potential and secure a bright future.” “Nothing rivals the opportunity and freedom that come with a quality education,” Sen. Tuberville said. “The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for ensuring our students aren’t subject to educational disadvantages because of their background or location. I’m committed to breaking down educational barriers so that the next generation of leaders are empowered to achieve the American Dream, which is why I’m proud to join this resolution recognizing National School Choice Week.” Other resolution sponsors include U.S. Sens. Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Ted Budd (R-North Carolina), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Lindsay Graham (R-South Carolina), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), and Todd Young (R-Indiana). Tuberville is a former coach, mentor, and educator for more than 40 years. Tuberville spoke on the floor of the Senate, expressing his commitment to promoting educational choice opportunities for students. Tuberville called on the U.S. Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules to redefine the Charter School Program (CSP) that would strip parents of the ability to choose the best school for their child. Tuberville also introduced the Children Have Opportunities in Classrooms Everywhere (CHOICE) Act to allow low-income families with children in grades K-12 to use federal education funds for educational options that best fit their needs. Last week Britt visited Dunbar Magnet School in Mobile, Alabama, where she attended a civics class, a dance class, and a physical education class before speaking to a school-wide assembly. Dunbar is a public magnet school for grades six through eight. When it comes to education, Britt said that she believes that one size does not fit all. Every family should be empowered to make the best possible choice for their child’s education. For many, that may be their local traditional public school. For others, it might be a traditional public school elsewhere. It could be a public charter or magnet school, a private school, a trade school, homeschooling, or a virtual academy or hybrid solution. “I trust parents to make the best choices for their individual children,” Britt said. “In the Senate, I will fight for their right to do just that.” Congressman John Moolenaar (R-Michigan) introduced the companion resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives. Tuberville and Britt are serving in their first terms representing Alabama in the Senate, with Tuberville being elected in 2020 and Britt being elected in 2022.
