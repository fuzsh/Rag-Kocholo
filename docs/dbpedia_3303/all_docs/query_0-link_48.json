The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:30 a.m., in Room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Peter A. DeFazio [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Mr. DeFazio. The Subcommittee on Highways and Transit will come to order. Today, we are going to begin to delve into the issue of distracted driving, not a new issue, but an issue recently complicated by the proliferation of technology. We do know that 6,000 people died in 2008 where there were reports of one form of driver distraction or another, and that is not necessarily a comprehensive number. That is a statistic that we want to bring down, way down. And there were also a large number of injuries and, obviously, a tremendous amount of property damage due to distracted driving. It seems to be most problematic among young and inexperienced drivers, but it is a problem for drivers of any age, depending upon the technology. So today we are going to hear from the Secretary of Transportation, who has taken on this cause and is determined to make it part of his legacy, to help reduce the deaths and the injuries, and we will hear from other experts. There is not unanimity yet on what steps to take, but we hope to find our way to a path to deal with this issue through the hearing. And with that, I will turn to the honorable Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing. It is not a new problem. In May of 2001, when Mr. Petri was Chairman of the Subcommittee, I attended a Subcommittee hearing that addressed the same issue and, of course, 8 years later we are still faced with some of the challenges we discussed in 2001, except the problem has grown tremendously since that time because so many people today are addicted to the BlackBerry and other gadgets. In fact, I remember reading a few months ago where a young woman in New York City was so intensely involved with her BlackBerry that she walked into an open manhole cover in New York City. And then just yesterday, in the Politico newspaper, they had a story about a man who was almost hit by a car in Georgetown because he was trying to read his BlackBerry as he crossed the street. And so with all advances in technology, we have witnessed an increase in the number of devices and gadgets that can take our eyes and our minds off the road. I remember walking, a few years ago, walking up the street just from the Rayburn Garage to the Capitol Hill Club, and six vehicles passed me, and four of those six drivers were talking on their cell phone. Most people agree that drivers should not type e-mail messages on their BlackBerrys or text their friends on their cell phones while they are driving. And I want to say that, you know, I certainly, first of all, want to commend Secretary LaHood for convening the Summit on Distracted Driving and bringing this issue to the forefront of the administration's agenda. We certainly all need to do everything we can to discourage people from using these new gadgets while they are driving and to keep their eyes on the road. And I certainly look forward to hearing from Secretary LaHood and our other witnesses and all the experts on this problem. It is a difficult one because there is a problem about enforcement and so forth. But we need to emphasize that, unfortunately, we have more people killed in 3-1/2 or 4 months on the Nation's highways than in all U.S. aviation accidents combined since the Wright brothers' flight, and that shows how dangerous our highways still are. And in this Subcommittee we need to do, and certainly try to do, everything we can to make our roads and highways safer. So thank you for calling this hearing, and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses. Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman for his statement and his concern with the issue. With that, we will begin with a video presentation by Dr. Tom Dingus, Director, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. VIDEO PRESENTATION BY D. TOM DINGUS, DIRECTOR, VIRGINIA TECH TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE Mr. Dingus. Mr. Chairman, I have been asked today to show some videos from a series of studies that we have done that we refer to as naturalistic driving studies. These are large-scale studies where we collect a variety of sensor data and video data using sophisticated instrumentation. This instrumentation is in drivers' own cars and trucks. They are not given any specific instructions. They just drive as they normally do. Thus far we have collected data from over 600 drivers. Each driver was driving their vehicle, either car or heavy truck, between 4 and 18 months. So we have collected 100,000 hours of continuous driving data and over 7 million miles. This is an important methodology because it allows us, for the first time, to get detailed information on driver behavior just prior to crash and near-crash events. Human performance and behavior, it is well known, account for over 90 percent of vehicle crashes. A subset of these behaviors really create most of the crash risk. This is impairment due to alcohol primarily. Inattention and distraction is a big one, drowsiness, and then judgment-related error. This study provides a new opportunity to get real-world data in the larger context of driving and get detailed pre- crash information. So what I am going to do is show you some examples of the data that we have collected from a variety of different studies. This study is called the \"Hundred Car study.\" What you are going to see here in a minute is a teen driver, 18 years old, who is driving through a neighborhood, who is lost and pulls out her cell phone and begins to dial. What this little graph here shows you is that she makes a very hard-braking maneuver and that is what allowed us to find the event. But if you look in this screen right here, you will see a child on a tricycle come out in front of her and she just barely misses that child. So in the lower left she takes out her cell phone, she begins to dial and then you see the tricycle right there. Research has shown that drivers look back and forth between their cell phones and the forward roadway. If her sequence of eye scanning had been opposite of what it was she probably would have hit the child. I will play it one more time. This next case is a teen driver talking on a cell phone, and this is also a very common occurrence of what we see. This is a newly licensed teen driver, 16 years of age. And she essentially runs off the road and hits the curb on the right and misses a sign by about 12 inches--so I will play it for you--and continues to talk. Now, teens aren't very good at controlling their vehicles. Talking with one hand on the phone and being engrossed in the conversation created a near-crash event in that case. For this one I have to ensure that there is no video being recorded. Some of these are sensitive for privacy reasons. This is a driver, teen driver, newly licensed teen driver, texting on his phone. It is a little hard to see, but in the lower left, he doesn't have either hand on the steering wheel for most of the time. He is driving with his knees and he hits the left curb and barely misses trees and signs. So he is not in good control of his vehicle. He is going about 45 miles an hour. We see this kind of behavior all the time. This is a semi-tractor-trailer driver. He is using a mobile data terminal which includes a full keyboard and a display screen. He has got it sitting on his steering wheel. He runs off on the right shoulder of the road and then corrects back as a truck is passing, but fortunately keeps it in the lane without overcorrecting a little bit, or he would have hit the truck. But you can see him looking down, typing a message, barely able to control his 18-wheel truck. His eyes are off the road for somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 or 5 seconds while he is doing this task. Here is a driver who is a truck driver again, semi-tractor- trailer. He is going to text while he drives. As you see, neither hand on the wheel. He is driving on a road with no shoulder. And he just shifted and now he is going to essentially run off the road to the right, just off the pavement. Two-lane road. This is a driver that is reaching for a ringing wireless device. It looks like, it is hard to tell, but it looks like he is trying to pull it out of a jacket pocket. But you see he nearly has a head-on collision while he is trying to get to the wireless device. Right there. I am going to show you a crash. There is not--I can't show you many crashes because the subjects have to agree to release the data and, particularly in the case of trucks, truck drivers are not willing to do that very often. But this one is blurred to the point, with no video playing, that I can show you. You are going to see a truck roll over in the median. Now, this is a reading task. But it is an external task. As he passes this bobtail tractor, he is fascinated by the writing on the side of it and he is looking, trying to read what it is. He takes his eyes off the road for 5 seconds, comes across a stopped line of cars, luckily misses that minivan, but rolls over in the median. An interesting aspect of this data is the police report said that he was following too closely or tailgating, and that a distraction wasn't mentioned as a cause in the police report. He didn't even remember it until he was interviewed after the crash. And that is a shoe. So those are the videos, Mr. Chairman. Can I answer any questions at this point? Mr. DeFazio. Dr. Dingus, we have you on a subsequent panel, so I think we will reserve our questions, if that is okay, so we can move ahead with the other--with the Secretary and with the Member panel. So thank you. We will call you back up. We would ask the Honorable Carolyn McCarthy from New York's Fourth District to come forward and testify for 5 minutes to the bill she has introduced on this issue. TESTIMONY OF THE HON. CAROLYN McCARTHY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mrs. McCarthy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank Ranking Member Duncan for having me here today. And I appreciate the Members being here also. I commend the Chairman and certainly the Members for recognizing the importance of distracted driving in our Nation. Our former colleague--and now Secretary LaHood--has done a terrific job in bringing this matter to the attention of Congress as well as nationwide. But much like the Department of Transportation's recent Distracted Driving Summit, hearings such as this serve as a great opportunity to vet plausible and effective solutions to this growing problem. Having had surgery during July, I could not drive, so I had a lot of people driving me around to different appointments. And every one of them was text messaging. And I tell you, I was scared for my life, mainly because of the way they were driving, anything that was going to hit was going to hit on my side, and I didn't appreciate that. So it is banned for anyone in the car that is driving myself. Along those lines, I certainly thank President Obama, who in signing an executive order, effectively banned all Federal employees from texting behind the wheel. Both initiatives represent important steps toward cultivating safety on our Nation's roadways, but fall short of applying these safety precautions to each and every driver. This is why I am here today to testify. The dangers of distracted driving are not limited just to Federal employees. Several studies, including one conducted by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, recently concluded that drivers are 23 times more likely to get into an accident while texting and driving. With smart devices that provide access to e-mail, text messaging, the Internet and more, individuals are becoming more increasingly reliant upon mobile technology in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, as these devices continue to evolve and become more affordable, their inappropriate and unsafe use continues to grow as well. Almost as rapidly as these devices have developed, so too have hands-free and voice-activated technologies, each of which is designed to give individuals increased mobility and attentiveness while communicating. But even with the best technology many manufacturers are coming out with, driver attention is taken away from what you are supposed to be doing, and that is driving. We, as Members of Congress, should seek out ways to encourage the use of these technologies in an effort to lower the risks throughout our transportation system. Recent surveys suggest large majorities, regardless of political affiliation, believe irresponsible use of hand-helds behind the wheel should be illegal. Most recently, a New York Times-CBS poll shows that 90 percent of adults agree that sending a text message while driving should be illegal. Our goal should be to facilitate effective changes that keep more drivers' hands on the wheels and eyes on the road. You saw with what we had just seen as far as some of the videos, I have seen many people driving with their knees and doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and it is only by the grace of God that they did not cause an accident or cause someone else's injury. H.R. 3535, the Alert Drivers Act, which I was proud to introduce with my colleague, Nita Lowey, I believe represents a strong first step toward combating preventable roadway accidents. My bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish minimum texting-while-driving standards of protection that State legislators must meet; and will also allow States to establish stricter standards as they see fit. And much like the laws that establish the legal age to consume alcohol and blood alcohol concentration limits for drivers, the bill would withhold a percentage of Federal highway funding to States that do not comply. The bill has garnered the support of consumers and affected industries to create a solution to distracted driving. While some States like New York State, my home State, have taken it upon themselves to ban the practice within its borders, others still lack effective and prudent measures to curb their behavior. What makes a nationwide ban so important is the fact that distracted driving is a practice that is not isolated within particular States. Moreover, inconsistent laws across our country serve only to confuse and embolden drivers who text and drive. Let me finish up with saying that we have an opportunity here, obviously, to strengthen highway safety. But we also have an opportunity to cut down on accidents and deaths which also cost this Nation a great deal of money. There are many solutions out there. I certainly am willing to work with the the Committee and Secretary LaHood to come to a solution down the road. With that, I am open to any questions. Mr. DeFazio. Excellent. Thank you. And thanks for your advocacy and your initiative and leadership on this issue. Anyone have any questions? If not, thank you for your testimony. Appreciate it. Look forward to working with you on this issue. With that, we would move on to the next panel, which would be the Honorable Ray LaHood, Secretary of the Department of Transportation. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here today. The Secretary called because he wanted to indicate his extraordinary interest in being at this hearing and asked if I would reschedule so he could be here personally. Normally Secretaries don't testify before Subcommittees, and so we are particularly honored to have him here. But when he was calling to ask me to reschedule, I happened to be turning onto my street and driving. And so I had to say please, Mr. Secretary, could you hold on for a minute until I can pull over so we can continue the conversation? I thought that particularly embarrassing to have that conversation while driving and I didn't have a hands-free unit with me. So thank you for your indulgence, then, and thank you for being here today. TESTIMONY OF HON. RAY LaHOOD, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Secretary LaHood. Mr. Chairman, thank you for changing the time to make it convenient for me to be here. And as I told you in our phone conversation, this is a very, very important issue for me and to you and Ranking Member Duncan, to all the Members that are here. Thanks for your interest, and the opportunity to appear to discuss what I believe is one of the most important issues that we can really address, and that is distracted driving. Transportation safety is the Department's highest priority. Distracted driving is a dangerous practice that has become a deadly epidemic. Our research shows that unless we take action now, the problem is only going to get worse, especially among our Nation's youngest drivers. I think it really is an epidemic among our youngest drivers. This trend distresses me deeply, and I am personally committed to reducing the number of injuries and fatalities caused by distracted driving. Four weeks ago the Department of Transportation hosted a summit to help us identify, target, and tackle the fundamental elements of this problem. We brought together over 300 experts in safety, transportation research, regulatory affairs and law enforcement. More than 5,000 people from 50 States and a dozen countries also participated via the Web. We heard from several young adults who had engaged in distracted driving and who discussed the terrible consequences of their actions. We also heard from several victims of this behavior whose lives have been changed forever. Mothers and fathers who lost children and children who lost a parent told us their stories. And I want you to know that I promised these families I would make this issue my cause. The unanimous conclusion of the summit participants is that distracted driving is serious and an ongoing threat to safety. This conclusion is born out by the facts. Our latest research shows that nearly 6,000 people died last year in crashes involving a distracted driver and more than half a million people were injured. This is not a problem caused by just a few negligent drivers. To the contrary, AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, a nonprofit educational and research organization, reports that 67 percent of drivers admitted to talking on their cell phone within the last 30 days while behind the wheel. And 21 percent of drivers indicated they had read or sent a text or e-mail message, a figure that rose to 40 percent for those drivers under the age of 35. As shocking as these numbers are, it is clear that this problem is only getting worse. And the youngest Americans are most at risk. While the worst offenders may be the youngest, they are not alone. On any given day last year, an estimated 800,000 vehicles were driven by someone who used a hand-held cell phone at some point during the drive. People of all ages are using a variety of hand-held devices such as cell phones, personal digital assistants, navigation devices, and they are behind the wheel. However, the problem is not just confined to vehicles on our roads. It affects all modes of transportation. Experts agree that there are three types of distractions: number one, visual; taking your eyes off the road; Number two, manual; taking your hands off the wheel; and number three, cognitive; taking your mind off the road. While all distractions can adversely impact safety, texting is the most troubling because it involves all three types of distractions. In the words of Dr. John Lee of the University of Wisconsin, this produces the perfect storm. For all these reasons, at the conclusion of the summit I announced a series of concrete actions that President Obama's Administration and DOT are taking to put an end to distracted driving. The President's Executive Order banning texting and driving for Federal employees is the cornerstone of these efforts and sends a strong, unequivocal signal to the American public that distracted driving is dangerous and unacceptable. The Executive Order prohibits Federal employees from engaging in text messaging while driving government-owned vehicles; when using electronic equipment supplied by the government while driving; and while driving privately owned vehicles when on official government business. This ban takes effect government-wide on December 30, this year. However, I have already advised all 58,000 DOT employees that they are expected to comply with this Order immediately. DOT is also working internally to formalize compliance and enforcement measures, and we are in close consultation with the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, providing leadership and assistance to other executive branch agencies to ensure full compliance with the Executive Order by all Federal departments and agencies no later than December 30. DOT is also taking other concrete actions to reduce distracted driving across all modes. For instance, 1 year ago we began enforcing limitations on texting and cell phone use throughout the rail industry. We are taking the next step by initiating three rulemakings. Number one, to codify restrictions on the use of cell phones and other electronic devices in rail operations. Two, to consider banning texting messages and restricting the use of cell phones by truck and interstate bus operators while operating vehicles. And three, to disqualify school bus drivers, convicted of texting while driving, from maintaining their commercial driver's licenses. We will work aggressively and quickly to evaluate regulatory options and initiate rulemaking as appropriate. Moreover, our State and local partners are key to any success we have in addressing distracted driving. I have encouraged our State and local government partners to reduce fatalities and crashes by identifying ways that States can address distracted driving in their strategic highway safety plans and commercial vehicle safety plans. And to assist them in their efforts, I have directed DOT to develop model laws with tough enforcement features for all modes of transportation. There are other affirmative measures that States can take immediately to reduce the risk of distracted driving. For example, we are encouraging the installation of rumble strips along roads as an effective way to get the attention of distracted drivers before they deviate from their lane. Education, awareness, and outreach programs are essential elements of the action plan. These measures include targeted outreach campaigns to inform key audiences about the dangers of distracted driving and take high visibility enforcement actions. We are still researching the effectiveness of combining high-visibility enforcement with outreach campaigns in the distracted driving context, but we are hopeful that such efforts may prove effective in the same way that we have been able to use them to reduce drunk driving and increase seatbelt use. All of these measures are the beginning, not the end, in solving the problem with distracted driving. DOT will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to collect and evaluate comprehensive distracted driving-related data needed to better understand the risks and identify effective solutions. And the administration will continue to work with Congress, State and local governments, industry and and the public to end the dangers posed by distracted driving and encourage good decisionmaking by drivers of all ages. We may not be able to break everyone of their bad habits, but we are going to raise the awareness and sharpen the consequences. And I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and your Subcommittee for the interest you have shown in this issue, and I am looking forward to any questions that anyone might have about this. Thank you very much. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I first turn to John Mica. I was remiss in not giving John time for his opening remarks. So you can do opening remarks and any questions you have for the Secretary, John. Mr. Mica. Thank you. I will try to be brief. And first I want to thank you, Peter, for holding this hearing, along with our Ranking Member, Mr. Duncan, and the Secretary for being here and focusing attention on this issue. Mr. Duncan and I have not had a chance on our side to sit down and talk about legislative proposals and our support or opposition--at least from the Republican side--or what we favor, but I wanted to come this morning for just a minute. First of all, usually when the Secretary of the administration comes on, they get, you know, boxed by the--no matter what you say or do you get criticized by the opposition. And I want to do just the opposite. I want to take a minute to praise my colleague, former colleague and now our Secretary, for taking a very positive initiative. I know he was criticized--not enough, or not legislative or tough enough, or something--by some folks, but I think he did exactly the right thing. He called attention to a growing problem and a growing issue. And I think he did it; he started in his own back yard, which is with Federal employees and others we have jurisdiction over, and he outlined a very comprehensive approach. I think he has touched on all the things that he can do from an executive standpoint and from the administration's standpoint, and we are encouraged to work with him on rail, trucks, buses, all of the things that you mentioned here today, I think we will be very supportive of from our side of the aisle. So I came not to criticize, but to praise. I do, however, want to say that distracted drivers is one part of the problem. There are many types of distractions, and we know now we are up to around 6,000 fatalities, as you cited, from distraction. I remember one ride my wife and I took down a road in Tallahassee, and I thought our life was over when a young lady coming in the opposite direction was putting her makeup on and drove us off the road into a ravine. We were not injured, fortunately, but it was a distracted driver. Cell phones and textings are other forms of distraction. Now, one of the things I would ask is that--well, let me lead up to this. First, sometimes like one administration ends and the next administration begins, I think we need some continuity of efforts to try to improve situations. If you do this on a risk-based approach, you just look at the statistics. And first of all, 12,865 people died last year not using seatbelts. I remember when Norm launched that effort with the administration. You know, seat belts, that is nice. And then I looked at the number of people that were killed. That is one of the highest numbers right there. In fact, it is higher than speeding. Speeding is second. It is 11,674. And then, of course, one that I happened to see--after I left you all last night, and we went home after a wonderful dinner and the Historical Society had honored our Committee last night, and Ray LaHood addressed them. I saw yesterday's hearing in the Senate and it was pretty interesting to hear that. And I heard Dorgan lost his mother to a drunken driver. That was pretty dramatic commentary from the Senator. But alcohol still is an incredible killer; 11,773 last year were killed by alcohol. I say all this, that we need the continuum of the seatbelt proposal, we need tough enforcement, and tough enforcement does work. Let me just say in conclusion here, we had a huge problem in central Florida and Florida with big trucks and deaths. I mean, it was--some of the nightly news displays of the carnage on the road was horrible. And this is about 2003, I think, I took an interest. So we looked at a couple of things in enforcement. And then I found--and we have made some simple suggestions like you are doing here for improvements--and we found out that Florida had not passed laws compliant with what the Federal Government required. And we went to the legislature. They changed the law and they got twice as much money and twice as much enforcement. I just got the statistics on the last year and it is absolutely dramatic, the lives that haven't been lost through tough enforcement. And the Secretary did mention enforcement. So I know, in a cooperative effort of enforcing laws--and that Senate hearing and this hearing will probably talk about carrot-and-stick approaches, getting the right balance of carrot and stick from us. But I just say we will work with you and try to make the rest of what you started work, because it is important in lives saved and lost and tragedies. Lives lost is one thing, but the disruption in human--just society. I have been getting text messages all week from one of my close friends who rode off the highway last week and his wife was in intensive care all last week, on the verge of death--so far she is coming out of it--in an automobile accident on 95. So these are important issues. And I thank you all again for approaching this today. I apologize. I am distracted by another Committee meeting, so I have to speak and run. But thank you. Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman for his remarks and his concern. Mr. Secretary, if I could ask a few questions. And you may not be intimately familiar with this program, you have got a big Department, but there is something called the Future Strategic Highway Research Program which apparently includes a large-scale naturalistic driving study. And I am wondering when we might expect to hear or see results from that program and recommendations that might come from it. Secretary LaHood. You know what? I don't know, Mr. Chairman. I will have to get back to you on that. [Information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Defazio. Sure. I am sorry. We should have given you a heads-up. But if you can let us know, that would be helpful. Because if you were able to stay to listen to the later panel you would find there is some difference of opinion, and I am certain perhaps you have heard some of that at your summit. It seems like everybody agrees texting is, by far and away, the most dangerous activity. And then you get down to hand-held cell phones. But there are some studies that portray even hands-free, voice-activated devices as distracting as a hand-held cell phone, which personally I find a little bit difficult to believe. But I don't know if much of that came up at your summit and if you had any opinion on hand-held versus hands-free cell phones. Secretary LaHood. Well, I just spent 2 days in Detroit and I rode in a new Taurus. And they have a program where you can put your BlackBerry in a little device and it will sync all of your numbers. So all you have to do is talk. They have the technology, then, where you just say, dial such a number and it automatically does it. The epidemic is with people texting while driving. But I will tell you this, Mr. Chairman, I think any distraction is a problem. I think eating a hamburger, putting your make-up on, shaving, texting, talking on a cell phone, these are all distractions. But the epidemic is really with people texting. But all of these other things are distractions, too. I met a young man from Chicago at the summit whose mother was riding a motorcycle, and she was sitting at a stop light and another person came up, a woman, and plowed into the back of her, going 35 miles an hour. The woman that plowed into his mother, who was killed, was painting her fingernails. And now he has an organization called the Black Nail Brigade where he paints one hand, the fingernails on one hand, and wears a T- shirt called the Black Nail Brigade and travels all over the country trying to persuade people not to text, not to paint your nails, not to shave, not to put on make-up, not to eat a McDonald's hamburger while you are driving. These are all distractions. And as much as I like driving the Taurus and as much as I like their sync system where you put your BlackBerry in and it syncs all of your numbers and you talk to it, it is a distraction. Texting while driving is the biggest distraction. I think all these things are a distraction. Mr. DeFazio. Yes. And I wonder, and I don't know. I remember when I was learning to drive they had what in those days were movies and they would show crashes to try and sort of put a little reality on you as a kid. And I did see one YouTube video clip of a bunch of kids in a car crash due to distracted driving, very dramatic. I wonder if we are looking at either disseminating or developing some materials that could be used in schools and in drivers' ed programs around the country. It is clear distracted driving is a particular problem for young drivers because of the combination of inexperience and use of these devices. It seems to me that would be a useful educational tool. Secretary LaHood. I think there are three solutions for texting, and I think education is one of them. I think we have to get into driver education programs and really teach children, 16-year olds when they are learning how to drive, that you need to put your seatbelt on. And they do teach that. And we need to teach them the second thing you need to do is put your BlackBerry in the glove compartment, put your cell phone in the glove compartment, so that you are not distracted from what you are supposed to be doing. So I think education. I think personal responsibility. I think we need to teach the idea that you have a personal responsibility for people, your friends that are in the car, and people around you. And I also think enforcement--.08 and seatbelt laws prove that enforcement works. Everybody in America knows what .08 means now when they see it. Ten years ago they probably did not. Everybody knows click it or ticket, what that means. It means that when you click it, you are putting your seatbelt on and you are going to avoid a ticket. Enforcement is important. And I know there are not enough police to enforce all these things. That is why I talk about personal responsibility, and I also talk about education. But enforcement is very important, too, and that is what all of you are going to have to get into when you write your bill. Mr. DeFazio. This will be my last question then I will turn to Mr. Duncan. There are proposals to require the States to move forward with some restrictions or sanctions and/or enforcement, under--as Mrs. McCarthy has in her legislation-- under penalty of loss of Federal funds. Do you think we should go that far, or do you have a particular opinion on that? Secretary LaHood. Well, I do think the States are the incubators. I am proud of our State of Illinois, where Mr. Lipinski and Mr. Schock and I come from. They have passed a very, very good law. But 17 other States have passed good laws, too. But I believe in the carrot-and-the-stick approach, and I am not going to sit here and tell all of you what bill you ought to be supporting. But we are going to work with you and we will work with Senator Schumer and Senator Rockefeller. We will work with you, Mr. Chairman, and anybody else that wants to put legislation together. We need legislation. And we are willing to work with you on this. And we have got to look at what the States have done, because they are the incubators for these things. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. I turn now to Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Secretary, I commended you during my opening statement for your recent summit. And I will tell you today that I will support you as strongly as I can on anything that you want to do on this. This is not a Republican or Democratic thing. It is a very serious and growing problem, as you have said. And I know all of us have personal stories. And I frequently have used a cell phone while driving myself. I have never sent a text message. But I will say this: If this hearing had been held last week, as scheduled, I probably wouldn't have felt as strongly about it as I do now. But Friday afternoon when I flew home to Knoxville, I was driving on the interstate connector on a road where the people go 65 and 70 miles an hour. And I have an XM radio in my car and I--you know, you can push buttons and go from AM, FM and back to the XM and a lot of different stations. And I took my eyes off the road, and then I looked up after a few seconds and I saw the pickup truck up in front of me had come almost to a stop. I had to suddenly jerk my wheel. I went across from the left lane to the right lane and into the emergency lane and went into a spin, came back and whammed into the concrete median. Did a complete 360-degree turn in heavy traffic when cars were zipping by me right and left. And I still can't believe that I wasn't hit or that I didn't hit somebody else in all that heavy traffic. It is just miraculous. But it was because I was distracted, and I learned my lesson in a very dramatic way. And I am very fortunate that it wasn't much much worse. But I thank you for this effort you are making. Education is important, calling attention to the problem in every way that you can, as you are doing here this morning, that is important. I do have a question about, and you alluded to it, in that sometimes the police and the law enforcement say that they are overloaded trying to handle the rapes and the murders and all that. And they really, in the past, haven't had as much interest maybe as they should have about trying to enforce laws against the use of a cell phone and things like that. What do you think we can do to get more support from the law enforcement community on this? Secretary LaHood. Well, I think we will have it, Mr. Duncan. I think that law enforcement is very concerned about this. They know that this is a serious issue and they are the ones that investigate serious accidents and see people that are injured. And so I think we will have their support. Mr. Duncan. Did you have good participation in your summit from the law enforcement? Secretary LaHood. Law enforcement are very interested in this and they are very concerned about it. And I believe that when States pass laws, State police and others will enforce them, and have done that. And I think it will be true at the Federal level. I think that the example of that is, you know as well as I do, in the old days maybe when there weren't .08 laws and there wasn't as much attention on drunk driving, maybe law enforcement didn't look at it as seriously. But I can tell you now that when a policeman comes up on somebody whose blood alcohol level is above the legal limit, they are arrested. They take these things seriously because it is in the law, and they are charged with the responsibility of really enforcing these laws. And I believe they will take that responsibility seriously. Mr. Duncan. Well, you made a good point about the .08. When I first started practicing law in the early seventies, the limit in Tennessee and in most States was .15. And then because of action by this Committee, all the States lowered their thresholds, and that is important. But we have met success with those types of actions, and so I will support those types of actions in regard to this problem as well. And I thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to be with us this morning. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Coble, do you want to recognize your guests? And then we will go on with questions. Mr. Coble. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, good to have you with us. Mr. Chairman, and the gentleman from Tennessee, we are blessed, we are honored today to have friends from the Danish Parliament who will be visiting in our country I think for another week. I say to you, my friends from Denmark, you will be another week, will you, in this country? Well, it is good to have you. And, Mr. Chairman, I invited them to sit in on our transportation hearing. And we have a member who sits on the Transportation Committee in Copenhagen, and she especially was interested. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being with us. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Howard. Welcome here to the hearing. Mr. Bishop, I recognize you, but I would also like to recognize that I understand you have a bill that deals in particular with the issues of novices and distracted driving, and I want to recognize your work in that area and recognize you for your questions. Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I had wanted to make an opening statement, but out of deference to Secretary LaHood's time--and if you would prefer if I could wait till the third panel to make that opening statement, that is fine with me. But if I may, just to Secretary LaHood, thank you very much for being here. I just wanted to commend you on your comments with respect to drivers' ed. And that is one of two bills that I am working on, an effort to standardize and modernize our drivers' ed curriculum. And it really is, I found, shocking to learn that 15 States do not require any form of basic driver education for teen drivers; nineteen States don't require any form of classroom training before licensing. And we have not updated our drivers' ed curriculum since the 1940s. So I welcome your comments. I look forward to working with you and I, as I say, I am working on legislation that would address these issues. Mr. Chairman, also if I may request unanimous consent to place into the record testimony on this subject from Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. Mr. DeFazio. Without objection. Mr. Bishop. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time, and I will make my opening statement before the third panel. Thank you. Mr. DeFazio. Okay. On the Republican side now, Mr. Latta. Mr. Latta. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I don't have an opening statement, but if I could ask just some questions of the Secretary. Mr. Secretary, thanks very much for being with us today and for your passion on the subject. You know, I think that all of us in elective office, we put a lot of miles on our car, and I think you told me the age of one of your cars is about the age of one of mine. And I am sure that I have seen everything that you have seen, everything from people now watching television driving down the road at night, to reading books, newspapers; of course all the things you mentioned about eyelashes, lipstick, hair. Years ago my uncle, with a carload of kids, dropped his cigarette lighter underneath him when he was driving and so that was catching the seat on fire at the same time. But you know--and then probably topping them all off, several years ago my wife and I were on the interstate and a car zipped by. And as it was going by, I thought, boy, they are going by quickly. It was a young lady driving the car, changing her clothes while driving. And at that time she had her sweater off the top of her head driving down the road about 70-plus miles an hour. And I have also been trying to instill in our kids--my daughters are 17 and 16, and the one has been driving for about a year and a half. Our youngest daughter, who is 16, is finishing up her driver's education right now in Ohio. And in Ohio, several years ago when I was in the legislature, we changed the law that you had to have 50 hours with your parent in the car before you could get that license. I voted for that bill. I helped the sponsor on it. I was on the Committee. And let me tell you something. I never realized how long 50 hours is with your kids in the car. It is a long time. But it really shows to me that, you know, younger kids need that. Because I remember when I got my driver's license license years ago, I drove home. I mean, I went down and took the test and that was the beginning of driving. But we are all very, very concerned about distracted driving, especially now when we are talking about what could be happening with folks using texting or their cell phones. Because one of the things I have tried to do, and I hope my kids have listened to me, because I said there are two things in their first year of driving, they are not allowed to listen to the radio in car. And, of course, there's no cell phones to be used at all. But you know, and I have tried to trick them to figure out if they are listening to the radio in the car, because I put it on a station I know they wouldn't have been listening to. And if I get in the car and they are listening to a different station, I have a talk with them. But you know, when we are talking about on the distracted driving end, would you agree that from the studies, especially the one that we saw a little bit earlier, that with texting and talking on the phone there is a difference between that and reading and different things right now? I know how passionate you are about all distractions, but would you say that the one, especially just on the texting right now and speaking on phones, might be a little more different than some of the other ones right now? Secretary LaHood. Well, Mr. Latta, you probably don't want to hear this, but I think all of these things are a distraction. I really do. I am not going to give up on this idea. Texting is an epidemic, particularly among young people. But in Washington, D.C., talking on a cell phone is illegal. Now, when I drive around Washington, which I do in my 1998 Buick, I see everyone, just about everyone on a cell phone. And I know that they can't be driving safely when they are doing that. Mr. Latta. Just to follow up with that, Mr. Secretary, I guess one of the things that--and you mentioned that you have been up in Detroit and seen the vehicles and how they are being produced, that you can use more hands-free. But it is almost to the point anymore, are we going to even be able to stop it? I doubt it, because even though we have passed very restrictive drunk driving laws--I served as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Ohio Senate when I was in the legislature. I served as a criminal justice in the House. Year after year, we had bill after bill after bill dealing with drunk driving, but we haven't been able to get that under control. But hopefully we are instilling folks with the major penalties. But at the same time, you know, if we are able to get vehicles out there that can allow people to use some of these devices, hands-free, in my opinion that is a much better thing to do because, again, folks are still playing with their radios, they are still playing with their CDs, and there are a lot of things in the car that they are still doing. But I think, in my opinion, and I know where you are coming from, that any distraction--but I don't think that we are ever going to prevent that. You know, we can put all the laws on the book, because I did in my Judiciary Committee when I was in the Ohio Senate. I had 141 bills in one session. But I just think that--and I understand that what you are saying, that you believe they are all a distraction. But would you just, again, though, if you could make something safer, wouldn't you agree that is the way to go? Secretary LaHood. Well, I will say this. I will say that 10 years ago I am sure people never thought we would get to where we are at with .08, because you know as well as I do, in the old days police used to put somebody in a police car and drive them home or give them a pat on the back and say, you know, go on home. But we have, because of strong advocacy groups, because of good laws by Congress, because of very good enforcement. And the same is true of click it or ticket. Somebody that works at DOT told me recently they got a ticket in Washington, D.C. for not having their seatbelt on, and I think it is like a $50 ticket. So, Mr. Latta, I am not going to give up on the idea that all of these things are a distraction. I am not. And I think they are. Mr. Latta. I appreciate that, and maybe we can hear more discussion later on. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Boccieri. Mr. Boccieri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not have an opening statement but I would like to ask the Secretary a question. Mr. DeFazio. That is the point we are at, go right ahead. Mr. Boccieri. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, or Mr. Secretary, you had suggested that in a recent hearing that you were not going to equivocate on any kind of distraction, whether it is trains, planes or automobiles, distractions were to figure out a way to get cell phones, texting and all other laptops out of the hands of people who were delivering the public somewhere safely. And in light of what happened with respect to the pilots who overflew their checkpoints, are you advocating for a ban of cell phone use or operators of planes and trains? I think there was a train in Los Angeles that the driver or the operator was texting while driving. Is this the goal of---- Secretary LaHood. We have put out a restriction now that-- an enforcement that train drivers are not allowed to use cell phones or BlackBerrys. They are not allowed to. Absolutely. The two pilots that flew the plane from San Francisco and overflew Minneapolis, their licenses have been revoked by the FAA. They have an appeal process that they can follow. Pilots who are flying hundreds of people, over 100 people from one point to another, when those people get on the plane, they think they are going to get there safely. The last thing they want to hear is that the pilot had their laptop, checking their schedules, trying to figure out when the next time is they were going to work. And that is why their licenses were revoked. There are three investigations going on: one by the FAA, one by Delta, and one by the NTSB. We cannot allow this to happen. People who drive school buses, light rail, trains, automobiles, should not be distracted by anything. Mr. Boccieri. It is already illegal to drink and drive. It is already illegal to be distracted while you are driving. How do you propose the mechanisms to enforce these types of regulations? Secretary LaHood. Personal responsibility, education, and enforcement. Good laws with tough penalties, and .08 proves we can get there. We are not there yet; but it is not perfect. People are still killed by drunk drivers and injured by drunk drivers. But we have made progress. Click it or ticket. If you don't have a seatbelt on, you get a ticket. If you do have it on, you probably have a pretty good chance of not being injured or killed if you get in an accident. So I say let's really upgrade driver education particularly for first-time drivers, 16-year-olds. You know, I have four grown children. When they started driving, they all took driver education. I lived in fear. I think every one of them had an accident. Fortunately, it wasn't serious. But they never talked, even back in those days, about fastening a seatbelt. Now they do. We need to get them to talk about putting their cell phones away. There are ways to do these things, .08 and click it or ticket proves that we can do it. It is not perfect. But we are going to get there. We are at the starting point. Mr. Boccieri. There are quite a few people tragically that are killed by folks who get behind the wheel or get behind a train or whatever other public transit vehicle and they are tired. They haven't had enough sleep. Can you speak to that. Secretary LaHood. After the Colgan Air crash in Buffalo, we conducted 12 safety summits around the country looking at regional jets, which I know many of you fly. For 14 years I flew one from Peoria to Chicago in order to get out here. And during those hearings, we talked about having regional jet pilots fly from one part of the country to the other part of the country and then start their job and the fatigue involved in that. We talked about training, and we are going to put out a report, and we are looking at this very seriously. We also look at that in terms of hours of service for truck drivers. And we are addressing that issue. That comes under our purview. So we are trying to address these issues. Mr. Boccieri. My time is about to expire. Just one commitment from you, Mr. LaHood, that this will be based on sound research. I trust that you are going to make certain that all of this will be based on sound research and that every decision that we will make regarding public transit will be made from that data. Secretary LaHood. Absolutely. We have one of the best research departments at DOT. We have just brought some great people on. We do a lot of research. Our safety organization, called NHTSA, does a lot of good research. It will be based on sound research, yes, sir. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today. I enjoyed being with you last night. I appreciate your interest in this particular safety issue, and I know some of the States have already addressed it. Are you encouraging the States to pass some kind of restrictive law, or are you looking for Congress to pass a Federal law? Secretary LaHood. We don't have to give much encouragement to States. Eighteen States have done it in all different forms and fashions. And as I said earlier, they are the incubators for good ideas. Our work will really be with Congress working with all of you on the way forward for finding the right legislation, and we can do some things on our own. The President did sign an executive order. We have told all of our people from this day forward, starting a few weeks ago, that they can't use their cell phones and BlackBerries and text, particularly since many of those devices are government-issued. So we can do some things in the Department. We want to work with Congress, and the States will be doing their own thing. Mr. Brown of South Carolina. I noted that Washington, D.C. already has a ban on that. And do we have any statistics to prove that before and after the ban whether there is a significant drop in fatalities? Secretary LaHood. I don't have those figures, but I will get them to you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Brown of South Carolina. I think the Ranking Member was quoting some statistics about number of fatalities based on different actions, and I would just like to bring your attention--I know you already know this--that 22,000 Americans every year are killed because of unsafe highway conditions. And I know that we have been talking about the reauthorization bill and where we are going to move on that. Could you give us some ideas about when we could expect another highway reauthorization bill? Secretary LaHood. Well, as you know, we have recommended an 18-month extension. Not many people around Capitol Hill paid much attention to that, since now it looks like there will be an extension through maybe December 12th or something like that. That is what we have been hearing. The President wants a very strong, comprehensive, robust transportation bill. He believes in it. We believe in it. We believe it can make a difference. We believe it will put people to work. But we also believe we have got the find $400 or $500 billion to pay for it, because that is probably what it takes to have the kind of bill that we all want, that you want and we need. We need some time to do that, to put together a good bill and to find the money to do it. So from our end, we are pushing for an 18-month extension. Mr. Brown of South Carolina. I would hope that we could close that gap some. In my State of South Carolina I know we have got almost 12 percent unemployment. I think we are approaching 10 percent unemployment around the Nation, and we all know that building roads has a direct effect of putting people to work. So I would hope somehow that we could all work together. Secretary LaHood. Mr. Brown, I know that there is probably not a person on this Committee that agrees with us on this. Mr. DeFazio reminds me of that every time I see him. So does Chairman Oberstar. But it is not because we don't want a strong bill, a comprehensive bill. We want that. We think the bill that Mr. Oberstar and all of you have written is a pretty darn good bill. But we need to find the $400 or $500 billion to pay for it. And we would like some time to do that. Mr. Brown of South Carolina. I understand. And I am grateful that you talk about 400 or 500 billion so we can really solve some of the problems. Thank you for your service. Mr. DeFazio. Ms. Napolitano. Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Secretary LaHood. Good to see you, sir. And I am glad that Mr. Bishop is looking at adding to the driving school curriculum, that section, to be able to educate youngsters. Are you, by chance, working with the automobile industry to try to develop some technology or mechanisms to be able to address some of the things that have been discussed here, including the Breathalyzer, something to the effect that the automobile would sense any electronic waves going on and warn the driver about texting or phone usage, something that would help and add to and enhance the ability for that driver to remember that it is illegal to do so? And when you talk about the issue of distracted driving, I think that should be part of some of the States being able to ask their law enforcement agencies to include not necessarily putting on lipstick. Smoking is also a distraction. I had an individual that worked with me that dropped a cigarette, and as he was reaching for it down below his feet, he ended up hitting another car. So there are many things that cause accidents. And how do we get the information disseminated--whether it is to the public, whether it is to the car users--should it be in manuals that they are given when they purchase a car? All of those areas that if we are really going to be serious about this, we need to be sure we hit every single area that we can. Secretary LaHood. Well, I just spent 2 days in Detroit, Congresswoman, and I spent a half a day with each of the American car manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford, and GM. And I just had the CEO, Mr. Henderson, from GM, in our office a few days ago. Every chance I got I asked them for their help on distracted driving. We need your help either in advertising that you do or in technology that you are looking at. Many of them already have technology for hands-free types of opportunities. But I will tell you this, as I have said earlier, I think it is a distraction. But they are committed to working with us on this, and they are committed to safety and it is one of their top priorities. So we have had lots of discussions with them, and I know they will continue. Mrs. Napolitano. Even a pamphlet or some kind of an indicator inside of a packet when they purchase an automobile to remind people that these are things that can conceivably lead them to an unfortunate accident. The other area is in regards to statistics that might be available from the States that have bans on utilization of handheld devices. Do you get stats back from them, from law enforcement so that we have a better picture of whether it is working, those bans are working? Are they being enforced? Secretary LaHood. At the summit that we held, the day-and- a-half summit, we had State legislators from around the country. Eighteen States have passed laws with respect to distracted driving. Some are different than others, but as I said, the States are the incubators. We are going to look at what States have done. We are going to provide that information to Congress as a way to say this is what States have done and work with all of you on the way forward for legislation. Mrs. Napolitano. Do you have any future concept of working with the cable industry to be able to do it as a public service announcement to remind people, especially youngsters and families who have youngsters, about some of these distractions that they are not even thinking about? The only thing they can think of is a cell phone. Secretary LaHood. All of the safety groups were at our summit. We are working with the National Safety Council and a number of other groups who have a great deal of interest in distracted driving. They are going to be very helpful to us when we figure out exactly what we want to say. There is a public service message that has been put up already that is running and on the air about distracted driving, but we have to say it often enough that people really begin to understand it. Mrs. Napolitano. Repetition. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Coble. Mr. Coble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary, good to have had you at the transportation dinner last night. It was good to see and visit with you there. Mr. Secretary, are cell phone bans common among operators of mass transit systems? Secretary LaHood. Yes. Mr. Coble. I have heard that discussed pro and con. I am glad to hear an affirmative answer to that. Secretary LaHood. We are developing a rule for trucks, but we have put out an enforcement that people who drive trains are prohibited from using cell phones. Mr. Coble. I thank you for that. Mr. Chairman, in the film that was shown to us earlier, it indicated that 90 percent of the accidents are a direct result of human performance or lack of proper performance. And I think that figure alone, Mr. Chairman, indicates the sorely needed attention that needs to be directed to this issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeFazio. Ms. Richardson. Ms. Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have one question for the Secretary. As I read your testimony and you talked about the summit, and I believe in here it says together with over 300 experts in safety, transportation research, regulatory affairs and law enforcement, all participated, and it said that young people kind of gave their stories. I would like to take a little different spin than some of the comments that I have heard today. Realistically we live in the 21st century and I don't think--I could be wrong--but I don't think we are not going to have GPS systems, I don't think we are not going to have BlackBerries and phones. I think we are kind of there. And so my question would be slightly different. What can we do to work with the various industries to say okay, if we are going to have some of these devices, how can we have them be more safer or in a better environment while we drive or while we do the things that we do? Because I personally--you know, being of the younger generation, I don't see us where everyone is going to put their BlackBerry and put it in the glove compartment. I think that would be great, but I don't know if that is really realistic of what is going to happen. So I would like to suggest another alternative of what can we do--and I think some industries are going to talk today--to be more proactive and to say as you develop these systems, how can we have them make more sense? Because pilots do multitask, you know, vessels, everyone is multitasking. We have Members who are listening in hearings and texting messages at the same time. So what do you think about that theory? And I do support all of the enforcement and how we can do things better. So I am not in opposition to that. I am just saying what about that other piece. Secretary LaHood. Let me just first say when people started working on .08 and seatbelt laws, people said it couldn't be done, you are not going to get drunk drivers off the road, you are not going to get people to wear seatbelts. It is a way of life for us now, though. I think we can get there. I do think it takes a while to get this. But the specific answer to your question is that the wireless industry participated in our safety summit. I was with the Chairman of the FCC yesterday at the Senate hearing. They are committed. He and I agreed that we are going to get a group of people together to figure out how to make these devices maybe not as usable, if that is possible. But I do think if we use the model of .08 and seatbelt enforcement, personal responsibility, education, particularly in our driver education programs and with the industry, we will get there. Ms. Richardson. I look forward to that effort. Thank you, sir. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Schock. Mr. Schock. I am not sure what can be added other than to say I think it is important that aside from all of the votes that we take here in Congress and the legislation we could push, probably one of the most powerful things that we each have is our respective bully pulpits. And as demonstrated by States and as demonstrated by the District of Columbia and other municipalities that have passed bans on texting, but also the longest bans that I am aware of are on cell phone usage. And I would argue many of them have not been too effective in getting people to stop using their cell phones. And I think what is essential--and I am glad to hear the Secretary talk about it this morning--is education. Because as you mentioned, Chairman DeFazio, the YouTube video, anyone who has seen that of the crash with young people there, you can't help but be affected. And I think it really makes you reflect on your own habits and your own decisions that you are making by allowing yourself to be distracted whether it is texting, eating, talking to your kids, or whatever it might be that is diverting your attention. So I would just say I commend the Secretary for making this an issue. Certainly more people are talking about it because of your leadership, because of the work of your department. I commend you for that. I want to work with you. We will support legislation here to do something similar to what other municipalities have done. But I really believe the most important component is for all of us to become missionaries for the cause, but also that there be a public awareness campaign of the true risk so that young people understand--all people, actually. I would argue, as one of the younger Members, one of the reasons why young people are at risk is because they tend to like their technology and use it more frequently. But I think as some of our more senior members of the population get comfortable with the technology, they will begin multi-tasking as well with text messaging. But to your point, it is putting down your makeup, it is not eating a hamburger, and we still need a strong public awareness campaign to help drill that into the minds of the people to make wise choices. So I look forward to working with you on it, and I thank the Chairman for having this meeting. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Arcuri. Mr. Arcuri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for being here and your leadership in this area. Forgive me if this question was already asked, but are there any national statistics out there with regard to the number of automobile accidents caused as a result of texting as opposed to DWI or alcohol-related? Secretary LaHood. We will get those for you. [The information follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Arcuri. Thank you. And the second point that I want to make is it has been a few years since I was a prosecutor, but one of the things that I recognized was that as a result of the public outcry, the law enforcement agencies did much more with respect to law enforcement and the prosecutors did much more with respect to the prosecution. That happened not only with DWI where there was also the incentive, with respect to the fines, and then the prosecutors would look at additional fine money for the police agencies to put more police on the street, more prosecutors. But additionally, as the outcry developed, we would never think twice about not trying to get the maximum for somebody that passed a school bus. And yet, you know, there was this idea that well, it is just a cell phone or it is just texting. And it has been a few years, so I know things have changed. But I think your idea about pushing to get the idea out there, that this is a major cause, will be critically important. And my other suggestion is get the prosecutors on board as well because they are the ones that make--we could have the police doing all of the things that they need to, but without tough fines by the prosecutors, you know, they are just not going to stick on the other end. Secretary LaHood. I really agree on that, particularly on .08. When the laws were passed and it became the standard, prosecutors really have made the difference because that really gets in the newspaper then because people really see it is being taken seriously. It is not just a slap on the hand or a slap on the back and see you later or whatever. Mr. Arcuri. And the last thing, just from an ex- prosecutor's perspective, the last thing a prosecutor wants is to have let somebody go on a prior texting offense with a slap on the wrist and then they cause an accident on it in the future. So I think as that message gets out to prosecutors as well as law enforcement, I think that will greatly strengthen it and any incentive you can put in there for prosecutors to get tough I think will strengthen it as well. So thank you, sir. Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Platts. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thanks for your leadership on this issue, especially your summit. I was grateful for one of my State representatives, Eugene De Pasqually, being allowed to attend, and I know it helped him in his work in the general assembly back home. I want to especially commend the focus on younger drivers. When I was in the State House and we adopted similar State laws, as my colleague referenced, about 50 hours with an adult and things, it was staggering to see that the greatest threat to a 16- or 17-year-old losing his or her life was in a car accident. So the focus here, and combine that stat that already existed prior to texting and cell phones, add the challenge of being a good driver with texting, cell phones with a young, inexperienced driver, and we truly have a great threat to our youth out there. Is there any consideration to supporting Federal legislation as a starting point to follow the lead of some States where we do ban any cell phone use or texting by 18 and under? I know some have said 21 or under 21. And the reason I suggest that specifically is because of the data about young drivers and that we all have learned behavior. And my boys are 10 and 13 now. They have never been in a car that they weren't strapped in, starting with their baby seat, then their booster, car seat, now a regular seatbelt. So they get in the car and it is automatic, and it is great because they get in the car with my mom--different generation-- and if she doesn't immediately put her seatbelt on, I guarantee you one of them makes sure she does. So they learned the behavior, and it is going to stay with them the rest of their lives. So if we target that younger group that we know is at risk to begin with and they know it is a learned behavior to not do something, in essence, would the administration consider supporting that? Secretary LaHood. I think your point is a good point. It is not one I have heard--it is not one I have heard during these hearings, but I know exactly what you are saying about your own children because I have been admonished by my grandchildren, who have been in seatbelts all of their lives, that you need to put your seatbelt on. And that is a great example, one I am going to continue to use from here on out, because I do think these learned behaviors at a young age really can make a difference. And so I think that is a great point. As far as what we are going to support, we are going to work with all of you and figure out what the best way forward is, trying to see what the States have done that really has worked and then incorporate it in what you all want to do in the House and Senate. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and again, appreciate you taking the lead on a very challenging and life and death issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Bishop has one more question, I am told. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Secretary, you said a few moments ago-- perhaps it seems like a lot longer ago--that you said you would never have thought we would get to where we are now on .08 percent on blood alcohol content. Do you believe that it was the imposition of sanctions that got us to that point? Secretary LaHood. Well, I believe it was education, educating people that drunk drivers injure and kill people. I think it was tough penalties. In our State, if you get picked up for drunk driving they don't send you home. They, the police, don't give you a ride home. They put you in jail, they take away your license for 3 months, and you have to pay tough penalties, and you have to go to counseling. That is like for the first offense. Now, you know, when I was growing up or, you know, even a few years ago, you know, what would happen. The police would throw you in the back of their car, take you home, give you a pat on the back. And that doesn't happen any more. So it is a combination of a lot of things, Mr. Bishop. And that is why I say solving this texting is a combination--will take a combination of good education, personal responsibility, and strong enforcement. Mr. Bishop. If I may--I am in full agreement with what you just said. If I may, it does appear, though, that there is a very clear track record that when we impose sanctions as opposed to incentives that we get the kind of compliance we were hoping for. I mean, for example, the minimum drinking age, every State complies as a result of sanctions. Zero alcohol tolerance in 1995, every State complies. Commercial driver's license law, every State complies. Yet when we do something like child safety and booster seat incentive grants, so far only five States have come into compliance beyond those that were already in compliance. When we did primary seatbelt law incentive, so far only 10 States have come into compliance in addition to the 19 States that were already in compliance. So it seems to me that we have a pretty clear history that sanctions are more effective at bringing about the kind of behavior we all find desirable than incentives are. Secretary LaHood. I think you have answered your own question. Mr. Bishop. That was one of the reasons I wanted to pose it. Secretary LaHood. You got it on the record very well. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. DeFazio. I have no further questions. Unless Mr. Duncan has further questions, we will thank you for your testimony. Secretary LaHood. Thank you. Mr. DeFazio. And you notice I did not raise the issue of the reauthorization with you today. Secretary LaHood. You got a Republican to do it. Very bipartisan. Mr. DeFazio. You will find there is some substantial unanimity among Members of this Committee that we need a long- term authorization. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary LaHood. I am glad you didn't pass up the opportunity. Mr. Coble. Mr. Chairman, I want to remind the Secretary that neither did I mention the Yadkin River bridge again, Mr. Secretary. Secretary LaHood. I have heard from every Member of your delegation, Mr. Coble. Now you twice. Mr. DeFazio. We will now ask for the next panel to come forward. Mr. Vernon Betkey, Jr., Chairman, Governors Highway Safety Association; Mr. Tom Dingus, Director, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute will make a second appearance; Mr. Bobby Franklin, Vice President of CTIA - the Wireless Association; Mr. John Ulczycki, Group Vice President - Research, Communications & Advocacy, National Safety Council; Mr. Randy Mullett, Vice President of Government Relations and Public Affairs, Con-way Inc.; Mr. Robert Strassburger, Vice President of Safety & Harmonization, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; and Mr. Edward Wytkind, President of Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO. TESTIMONY OF VERNON F. BETKEY, JR., CHAIRMAN, GOVERNORS HIGHWAY SAFETY ASSOCIATION; TOM DINGUS, DIRECTOR, VIRGINIA TECH TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE; BOBBY FRANKLIN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CTIA - THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION; JOHN ULCZYCKI, GROUP VICE PRESIDENT - RESEARCH, COMMUNICATIONS & ADVOCACY, NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL; RANDY MULLETT, VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS; ROBERT STRASSBURGER, VICE PRESIDENT OF SAFETY & HARMONIZATION, ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS; AND EDWARD WYTKIND, PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTATION TRADES DEPARTMENT, AFL-CIO Mr. DeFazio. We will start in the order I read your names. So, Mr. Betkey, you are recognized for 5 minutes. I have read your all of testimony, and I know the Members have as well, so I am going to ask you to summarize your best points. If you are familiar with other members of the panel and their position--in particular, I would note there is disagreement over gradations of problems with the distracted driving and electronic devices. And one member of the panel asserts quite definitively that even voice actuated cell phones are as bad as handheld cell phones and others. And anybody who wants to address that because that will be an ongoing concern to the Committee. So thank you. You will each be recognized for up to 2 minutes to summarize, and then we will try to get into questions and a little interaction with the members on the panel. Mr. Betkey. Mr. Betkey. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Duncan and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today to discuss the important issue of distracted driving, and I thank you for giving national attention to distracted driving and also to highway safety in general. It is very important to all of us. I am Vernon Betkey. I am the Chairman of the Governors Highway Safety Association, and I am Maryland's Highway Safety Coordinator as well. The Governors Highway Safety Association is a nonprofit organization that represents State highway safety agencies. The GHSA is very concerned about distracted driving and believes that the problem is only going to worsen in the future, particularly as new technologies are developed and brought into the vehicle. While we are grateful for the attention being paid to this serious highway safety problem, we submit that the problem cannot be solved by the enactment of legislation alone. We adamantly suggest a comprehensive approach that includes data and research, legislation, education, enforcement, and adjudication, employer policies, technology, and funding. Further, we suggest that both the Federal and State governments have a strong role to play in each of these areas. The Federal Government can ensure that States take action based on solid research and data, best practices and model policies. And they can also ensure that they develop appropriate training for law enforcement and the judiciary, construct media campaigns that can be implemented by the States and evaluate technology that will control or manage distractions in the vehicles. The States can enact and enforce appropriate legislation, implement community-based education campaigns, and work with employers and the judiciary. Together, and with adequate funding, Federal and State governments can work to minimize distractions, maximize public safety and reduce crashes, deaths, and associated injuries on the Nation's highways. That concludes my testimony, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be with you here today, and I look forward to answering your questions. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you for being succinct. Dr. Dingus. Mr. Dingus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Duncan, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on this important topic. My name is Tom Dingus. I am from Virginia Tech. I am testifying before you today as a 25-year veteran of driving safety research for several important points that must be carefully considered in determining an appropriate action to this growing problem. First, our research has shown that the distraction issues that we face today are much different than those we faced just a few years ago, and consequently are resulting in a growing number of crashes. Texting, typing, reading, and dialing are much, much worse than eating, tuning a radio or talking. Second, our driving distraction problem is particularly time critical because the number of crashes involving complex tasks is growing exponentially. Third, while safety benefits can be realized with the deployment of electronic devices, these benefits can only be attained in vehicles engineered to minimize driver distraction. Fourth, teen drivers by far represent the largest population of those who engage in complex tasks while they drive and, consequently, are at a greatest risk. Fifth, the problem of driver distractions associated with electronic devices is multi-dimensional, requiring multiple solutions. Specifically, major differences exist between devices that are designed to be used in the vehicle and portable devices that are carried by consumers in the vehicles. In conclusion, driving distractions associated with electronic devices is creating a serious, rapidly growing public health risk. However, measured action is warranted so that solutions enacted with good intent do not stifle improvements in traffic safety. Therefore, I recommend the following approach: One, a national primary law banning the use of handheld wireless devices in a moving vehicle; two, regulations limiting functionality of visually demanding in-vehicle devices in a moving vehicle, including trucks; third, broadly applied standards for testing of potentially distracting devices prior to market introduction. Thank you very much. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Franklin. Mr. Franklin. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of CTIA and our wireless industry members, thank you for the opportunity to be here. With more than 280 million subscribers connected just about anywhere at any time, the wireless industry recognizes that being always available can have a downside when irresponsible drivers manually text and e-mail while behind the wheel. When a driver takes their eyes off the road and their hands off the wheel to send or read a text or e-mail, their actions are not compatible with safe driving. To help solve this problem, CTIA advocates for three components: Legislation, technology, and education. We believe this strategic combination is most likely to deliver the results we all desire: safer drivers and safer roads. First on legislation, CTIA has been working with the National Conference of State Legislators to create model legislation that could be adopted across the country that prohibits manual texting and e-mailing while driving. However, as Secretary LaHood has noted, we won't make this problem go away simply by passing laws. Second, we believe technology will continue to improve safety through new apps, changes in cars, even the roads themselves. It is important technology be effective and consumer friendly, but also that legislation not freeze innovation in place with inflexible mandates. Finally, third--and we believe the most important component to changing behavior--is education. Earlier this year, CTIA partnered with the National Safety Council to develop the on- the-road off-the-phone campaign, educatingteen drivers and their parents about the dangers of distracted driving. We believe this PSA is impactful and are proud that so many have already viewed this TV spot. Thanks again for the opportunity to be here. As we have just seen, the wireless industry continues to demonstrate our attempt to change this behavior. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. Mr. Ulczycki. Mr. Ulczycki. I am Vice President of Research, Communications & Advocacy for the National Safety Council. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Duncan, thank you for the opportunity to speak about the dangers of distracted driving and the use of cell phones. Earlier this year, the NSC became the first national organization to call for a ban on all cell phone use while driving. As an employer organization, we did that based on the risk and on the exposure. We estimate there are 100 million people in the United States who engage in this risky behavior. More than 75 research studies have shown that using a phone while driving is dangerous. Multiple studies have established that the risks of using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of a crash by four times. More than 30 research studies have shown that there is no safety benefit from hands- free devices. There are three principal distractions from cell phone use. The first two are visual, taking your eyes off the road, and mechanical, taking your hands off the wheel. And that is clearly what happens when people are texting or reading or sending e-mail, and those are of great concern to us. The third cognitive distraction, taking your mind off the road, is also of great concern. Brain scan imagery shows that 30 percent of the brain that should be engaged if driving is lost while you are talking on a cell phone. So one effect is that people on cell phones can have their eyes straight ahead on the road but they truly do not see vehicles or pedestrians. We are taking a multi-faceted approach to this problem, including legislation, enforcement, education, technology, and employer policies. We know that strong laws visibly enforced are the most effective method to change behavior. We know a total ban on cell phone use is necessary because cell phone conversations are causing the largest number of crashes. We are reaching out to law enforcement to encourage enforcement pilots that will demonstrate that cell phone laws can be enforced. We are developing educational initiatives, such as the one that my associate from CTIA just showed you, to reach teens and their parents. We are working with companies to develop technologies that manage incoming and outgoing calls and messages. We have called on employers to act on more than 460 of our member companies, including commercial carriers, bus companies, and some of the world's largest and smallest companies have put in total bans on cell phone use by all of their employees, covering 1.5 million employees today. We encourage the Congress to enact or encourage States to pass strong laws banning cell phone use while driving. We also encourage the Congress to support research that will quantify the number of deaths and injuries that are being caused by both handheld and hand-free conversations. Thank you again for this opportunity to discuss this issue. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. Mr. Mullett. Mr. Mullett. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Duncan, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the American Trucking Associations on distracted driving. ATA recognizes that a driver's ability to perform multiple cognitive tasks simultaneously is extremely limited. Our membership agrees that the use of some technologies, particularly handheld electronic devices, has increased the potential for driver distraction beyond the benefits derived from their use. In fact, the majority of fleets, including Con- way, have policies and procedures in place to limit their use while the truck is moving. We believe that a systematic approach is necessary to ensure that the use of these devices does not contribute to crashes. ATA supports legislation to ban the practices of reading, writing, or sending text messages on a handheld mobile device while driving. Specifically, we support the anti-texting provisions contained in the Alert Drivers Act in 2009, as introduced in the Senate. I believe that the companion is Mrs. McCarthy's bill that she spoke about this morning. However, other strategies are needed to bolster Federal and State law. Public attitudes and perceptions will need to change, and any legislation will have to apply to all drivers on the highway. In addition to effective legislation and regulation, we need a significant public education effort, exploration into the use of technology to reduce distractions caused by technology, tough penalties and effective enforcement of the laws, and proper funding of these initiatives. ATA believes that efforts to regulate the use of vehicle communication devices other than handheld units used for texting should be done through regulation, not legislation. In-cab fleet communication systems have been used in the trucking industry for many years. These systems help drivers perform their jobs safely, effectively, and efficiently. Because of the special characteristics of in-cab communication and the way these technologies are used in the trucking industry today, detailed analysis and public comment is required if restrictions are being considered. The efficiency and safety benefits of in-cab communication technologies should not be lost, but they can be reasonably restricted. Mr. Chairman, ATA looks forward to working with Congress and the administration to ensure that in-cab communications technology is used safely and responsibly. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Strassburger. Mr. Strassburger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Turning directly to the matter at hand, Alliance members are committed to advancing motor vehicle safety, and we take concerns about driver distractions seriously. From step one, we engineer new vehicle information and communication systems, telematic systems, to help the driver perform their primary task: the safe operation of their car or truck. We do this by engineering these systems according to our driver-focused telematics guidelines. These guidelines address the essential safety aspects of driver interaction with visual/ manual interfaces with the goal being to maximize eyes on the road. It is a rare crash that occurs while a driver's eyes are on the roadway. When a driver's eyes are not, the risk of a crash increases. Looking away from the road scene is the principal contributor to crashes and near misses. But we are not stopping there. Automakers are working on important safety enhancements right now that use wireless communications. In the near future, cars will be linked wirelessly to other cars near them and with their surroundings to further enhance safety by informing drivers of hazards and situations they can't see. Realtime navigation will also be provided, which will be critical to advancing how we manage congestion and even further reducing C02 emissions. So what should be done? We need appropriate laws with high visibility enforcement. We need consumer education about these laws and to support law enforcement activities and, further, to educate drivers about the risks of driving distracted. Finally, we need continued research so that we can further understand driving behaviors to enable the development of ever safer systems. And all of this should be done without severing the wireless communication link to vehicles, which enables tomorrow's safety and environmental benefits. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. Mr. Wytkind. Mr. Wytkind. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Duncan and the Subcommittee, for inviting Transportation Labor to testify. No one wants to improve the safety of our highways more than the men and women who drive for a living. And to truly combat distracted driving, we believe we must ban text messaging and limit the use of other communication devices. However, new policies must strike the balance between safety and the unique concerns and working environment of transportation workers. For many of our members, the vehicle is their workplace and communications devices are critical to performin"
