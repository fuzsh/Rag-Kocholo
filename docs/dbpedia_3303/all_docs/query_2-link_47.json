        "text": "Projects\n\nSpringdale Rotary Will Give Away Up To 4,000 Books on Saturday, December 16!\n\nSpringdale Rotary Club will give away FREE books to children this Saturday, December 16, 2023, at the Jones Center in Springdale from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. There is no charge for this event.\n\nBooks that are not claimed will be used for the Springdale Rotary Club’s book barrels throughout the next year.\n\nThere are approximately 4,000 used books in very good condition for children to choose from during this Santa Claus Used Book Fair. Most are in English, but there are Spanish books available as well. The books are appropriate for children up to 12 years old. Thanks to The Jones Center for making this Santa Claus Used Book Fair possible.Share\n\nWheelchair Project\n\nSince 2003, the Rotary Club of Springdale and Rotary District 6110 have been involved in purchasing and delivering wheelchairs around the world to those that need a wheelchair and cannot get one. Since we started this project, we have been able to purchase over 10,000 wheelchairs to provide mobility to those in need.\n\nThere are a lot of things that we take for granted, such as pre-natal care, and technological advancements, that are not as common elsewhere in the world. The results are birth defects, and disabilities among children and adults. Each year club members, at their own expense, help deliver the chairs to people in a different city. We have been able to have distribution trips to over 20 locations in Mexico and Central America to personally see the miracle of mobility in action. We have also been able to provide wheelchairs to those in need here in Springdale and Northwest Arkansas.\n\nEach chair costs $150.00, and Springdale Rotarians conduct an annual campaign to help raise money for this project. Each wheelchair affects the lives of more than 10 people who support the mobility-challenged individual; over 100,000 people have benefitted from this gift of mobility.\n\nWe are currently in the process of planning a trip to Mexico City in the spring of 2022 and any Rotarian is invited to go. Just as a reminder, you can change a life and the lives of those around the recipient for $150. What a deal!!!\n\nClick HERE to support the Rotary Club of Springdale's 2021 Wheelchair Drive and change lives!\n\nShare\n\nWater Project in India\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale has completed a project providing water to 13,000 people in India made possible with a grant from the Rotary Foundation. The grant was a project of Club Member and Past District Governor John Brodbeck, recently deceased. The ever-outgoing John met Rotarian Pankaj Patel at Rotary's International Convention and learned of the drought conditions in rural India some 75 miles from Mumbai. Scarce water required women to take long treks to fetch it for their families, and farmers were virtually unable to grow crops.\n\nA plan to add ten water retention ponds in several tribal areas was developed by the Pune Far East Club and Rotary District 3131. Funds from the Springdale Rotary Club of $1,900 were provided, and an additional $5,000 of District 6110 designated funds were committed with Foundation Chair Ed Hardesty's assistance. With these matching funds and the Rotary Foundation, the entire Global Grant totaled $96,415. Other partners included the Pune Central Rotary Club, Pune University and District 3131.\n\nHere is an excellent short video that the Rotarians put together - it is quite well done and worth your time to watch. Click here: Water project\n\nThe project stores water in the ponds during the monsoon season which is then used for drinking water and farming throughout the year. The deeper storage facilities also increased water percolation and raised the water table of numerous wells in the vicinity. About 500 acres of agricultural land in the area benefitted from this project, which enabled villagers to have water for drinking purposes for their cattle & agriculture (irrigation) year-round, thus raising the local economy (multiple crops per year) & reduced migration to the urban areas.\n\nWith the approval by the Rotary Foundation of the grant, construction began swiftly and was completed in the Spring of 2021.\n\nThe ponds will be maintanied by a Rotary Community Corps in the villages. A Rotary Community Corps (RCC) is a group of non-Rotarians who share our commitment to changing the world thru service projects. This provides the project with the sustainability required for all Rotary Foundation Global Grant projects.\n\nRotarians support the Rotary Foundation, and their contributions help people all around the World! Here is a specific example of our fellow Rotarians making life better for more than 13,000 people!Share\n\nNew Food Pantries in Springdale\n\nFriday, May 7, 2021\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale announced its latest project to improve the lives of people in Springdale: three Little Free Pantries stocked with nonperishable food items. The Three Little Free Pantries are installed at Springdale's Senior Center, the Youth Center, and adjacent to the Rotary Adventure Park on 48th Street.\n\nFrom President Greg Collier: \"This Project wouldn’t have happened without the help of Springdale Rotarians, and I’d like to take a moment to recognize some of them. Again, these are ALL Springdale Rotarians! Steve Miller was instrumental in helping get the project off the ground! He provided materials for the pantries and purchased the first pantry himself. Heather Lind and Cram-A-Lot assembled and delivered the Pantries. Ron Amos with Minuteman Press donated and installed the signage. Jeri Hill provided the Rotary plates. Steve Langton with Ace Handyman, permanently installed the structures. Mayor Sprouse and Patsy Christie gave their blessing from the City to do this project. And then finally, our membership gave of their money in the form of dues to purchase and stock the pantries.\n\n\"Our hope at Springdale Rotary is that those in our community needing assistance will use these pantries, and those in our community that are able to, will help stock them. This has been a blessing to our Club, and we look forward to continuing to serve our city, state, and beyond.\"\n\nThose in need are invited to take what they need. We invite the community to join us in supporting the health and nutrition of our community by contributing what they can to the pantries. All items should be nonperishable and packaged in non-glass durable packaging.\n\nShare\n\nCOVID-19 Response\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale supported our First Responders and Frontline workers through the COVID-19 pandemic by providing meals for our police department, fire department, medical personnel at Northwest Health, the Community Clinic, the city's Senior Center, and Public Works. We are honored to provide meals for these critical workers as a way to show our community's appreciation as they live out Rotary's motto of Service Above Self. The Club provided over 2800 meals through the Community Lunch Program.Share\n\nChristmas Food Baskets\n\nFor the third year in a row, the Rotary Club of Springdale distributed groceries to families of students at Lee and Jones Elementary Schools in Springdale to help combat food insecurity over the Christmas holiday school break. The Club orders the groceries weeks in advance, selecting items to be both nutritious and kid-friendly. Members meet the week before school dismisses for the holidays to sort and sack groceries and deliver them to the elementary schools. School counselors then distribute the bags to students' families. Since beginning in December 2018, this project has doubled each year, and in 2020, we were proud to be able to deliver 800 bags of groceries to Springdale students. Share\n\nThird Grade Literacy/Student Home Libraries\n\nEach year, the Rotary Club of Springdale purchases three books for each third grade student in the Springdale Public School District. Students who have books to read at home are likely to read more than students who do not, and reading is critical to student success. Books are selected for the students based on the students' individual reading levels as assessed by their teachers. Members of our Club visit each classroom to talk with students about Rotary and community service, the importance of reading and education, and to present the books to the students. Book Delivery Day is one of our Favorite Days in Rotary!Share\n\nEnd Polio Now\n\nWhy are our Pinkies Purple?\n\nSo you will ask, and we can tell you that there is this devastating disease called POLIO that has killed and paralyzed hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, mostly children under five. There is NO CURE for polio, but there is a VACCINE, and thanks to a vaccine, the United States saw its last case of polio in 1979. But while the United States was polio-free, children around the world continued to suffer, so in 1985 ROTARY launched its PolioPlus program, the first initiative to tackle global polio eradication through the mass vaccination of children. Since 1988 we have reduced the number of cases 99.9%, and in 2020, the World Health Organization certified the African region wild polio-free!\n\nWhile this is a huge accomplishment, it is not enough, because unless polio is completely eradicated, it could come roaring back with as many as 200,000 new cases a year within 10 years! No child is safe, because polio is literally only a plane ride away. Around the world Rotary and its partners are working to vaccinate every last child against this devastating illness, and children’s pinkies are often marked in PURPLE to show volunteers that they have received the vaccine.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale joins Rotarians all over the world in marking World Polio Day each year. On Tuesday, October 24, 2017, Mayor Doug Sprouse proclaimed World Polio Day in Springdale. Rotarians gathered at Jose's Bar & Grill for an End Polio Purple Margarita Special, and, for every purple margarita sold, Jose's donated $2 to the Rotary Foundation's PolioPlus fund to help rid the world of polio. In 2018, the Club raised money for PolioPlus with the sale of our Polos for Polio. In 2019 and 2020, the Club held a Happy Hour fundraiser at the Odd Soul in Downtown Springdale. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation matches every dollar raised 2:1!\n\nWHEN we eradicate polio, it will be only the second human disease eliminated from the world. Come join us and help make history!\n\nShare\n\nRotary Scholarship Program\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale, Arkansas presents two academic scholarships to graduates of Springdale public high schools each year. The Willard Walker Scholarships are $2000 each and are renewable up to four years. Additionally, the Club’s Rotary Workforce Scholarships are $1000 each for students interested in seeking a degree or certificate in a program that does not terminate in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree.\n\nThe Club's Scholarships are administered by the Springdale Public Schools Education Foundation and are awarded to Springdale students each Spring.\n\nShare\n\nRodeo of the Ozarks\n\nSince 1950, members of the Rotary Club of Springdale have served as ushers for the annual Rodeo of the Ozarks held in Springdale each summer. Ushers direct attendees to their seats, answer questions, represent our city and our club, and earn funds for our many projects in Springdale. We are proud to be a part of this Springdale tradition!\n\nShare\n\nSpringdale Rotary Charitable Trust Gives $5,000 to Springdale Schools Robotics Team\n\nMonday, October 7, 2019 The Springdale School District's Robotics Team at the Don Tyson School of Innovation was the winner of the national robotics competition. The team will represent the entire United States at the international competition in Dubai later this month. The Springdale Rotary Club's Charitable Trust donated $5,000 to the team along with other community donors to assist with cost associated with transportation of the team and their equipment to Dubai. Initally, not all team members could go due to the expense of travel and freight. The students have also been doing fundraising on their own to help with expenses. Springdale Rotarians pictured with the team from left to right: Treasurer Sabra Jeffus, Secretary Clinton Bell, Randall Harriman (in back), President Heath Ward presenting the check to the team, and far right, Rotarian and State Representative Clint Penzo. Share\n\nRotary Book Barrels\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale's \"Book Barrels\" are our version of the Little Free Library Project, where people are invited to \"Take a Book\" and \"Share a Book.\" Designed by Springdale Rotarian and architect Steve Miller to complement the Rotary Adventure Park, the accessible playground rededicated by the Club in 2013, the Book Barrels are large enough to hold books for both children and adults. Rotarians painted, assembled, and installed 5 Book Barrels around Springdale. The colorful Barrels emblazoned with the Rotary wheel are attractive ambassadors for the Club and Rotary International. The Book Barrels were dedicated with a picnic and ribbon-cutting at Rotary Park on June 4, 2018. Club members monitor the Book Barrels to replace books as needed. This project combined Springdale Rotary's traditions of projects focused on parks and literacy.\n\nShare\n\nRotary Clubs of Springdale and Fayetteville Host Day of Awareness to End Human Trafficking\n\nUpdated June 30, 2018.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Springdale and the Rotary Club of Fayetteville joined forces to present A Day of Awareness to End Human Trafficking Monday, April 30, 2018, at the Jones Center for Families in Springdale. This program, sponsored in part by the Jones Center, was designed to bring awareness, attention, and understanding to the issue of human trafficking in Northwest Arkansas.\n\nThank you to all our presenters, attendees, and volunteers who made this Day of Awareness possible. Together, we can make a difference in this issue in Northwest Arkansas.\n\nHuman trafficking, sometimes called modern slavery, is the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain labor or services or a commercial sex act. Any commercial sex act involving a person under the age of eighteen is unlawful in Arkansas and under federal law. Sex trafficking is better recognized and more frequently prosecuted, but both sex and labor trafficking are a growing concern in the United States, and in Northwest Arkansas. In order to address a problem, we first must recognize it exists: that knowledge was the purpose of Rotary's Day of Awareness.\n\nSpeakers addressed a wide range of perspectives. Topics included general information on human trafficking; incidences of trafficking in Arkansas; recognizing trafficking in various setting; remedies and assistance for survivors; and protecting children online and in social media. Two hours of continuing education credit for licensed counselors and social workers, six hours of continuing legal education credit, and six hours CLEST credit were available.\n\nAdditional resources are available below.\n\nPROGRAM CLE AGENDA SPEAKERS FACILITY GUIDE RESOURCES\n\n8:30 – 9:00 Welcome\n\nMayor Doug Sprouse\n\nCity of Springdale, Arkansas\n\nUnited States Senator John Boozman\n\nArkansas\n\n9:00 – 10:00 Session 1—Select one of the following:\n\nHuman Trafficking 101 - Chapel\n\nAnnie B.

Ahrends\n\nResident Agent in Charge\n\nHomeland Security Investigations\n\nJohn G. Ahrends is the Resident Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations’ Fayetteville, Arkansas office, which encompasses nine (9) counties in Northwest Arkansas. Mr. Ahrends has 21 years of federal law enforcement experience. Additionally, he is a combat veteran and retired from the U.S. Army Reserves.\n\nBefore being assigned to HSI Fayetteville as the SAC New Orleans 287(g) Program Manager, Mr. Ahrends had assignments as a criminal investigator in HSI Northern Kentucky (Fort Mitchell, KY), Louisville, Kentucky and Oakdale, Louisiana.\n\nPrior to being assigned as the Resident Agent in Charge, he had assumed the duties of Group Supervisor in Fayetteville. He is an alumnus of Illinois State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice.\n\nRobert Allen\n\nSpecial Agent\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nSA Robert Allen is a Special Agent with the FBI, assigned to the Fort Smith Resident Agency of the Little Rock Division. He has over twenty years of law enforcement experience. Agent Allen works all federal matters, but specializes in Child Exploitation and Sex Trafficking cases. He is part of a child exploitation task force, and has specialized in child exploitation and sex trafficking cases for many years.\n\nCarolyn Bates\n\nCommunity Outreach Coordinator\n\nMagdalene Serenity House\n\nCarolyn Bates was born and raised in Akron, Ohio. She relocated to Fayetteville, Arkansas in July of 2015 and now serves as Community Outreach Coordinator of Magdalene Serenity House in Fayetteville. Carolyn was previously the United States Veterans Initiative Outreach Director in Houston Texas. As the Outreach Director, she provided resources to hundreds of veterans, both homeless and at-risk, equipping them with the skills needed to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nMagdalene Serenity House is a sanctuary for women survivors of human trafficking, childhood trauma, and addiction. It is a free, two-year residential program that gives women a safe place to recover, heal, and reintegrate in a stress-free and financially stable environment.\n\nCarolyn serves as a crucial part of the Magdalene team by building partnerships across Northwest Arkansas and supporting the program in a variety of ways. She is passionate about the quality of care and support services available to women survivors of human trafficking, childhood trauma, and incarceration. Carolyn herself has overcome many of these obstacles, which gives her the exemplary abilities to serve and educate others.\n\nUnited States Senator John Boozman\n\nArkansas\n\nJohn Boozman is Arkansas’s senior U.S. Senator and the dean of the state’s Congressional delegation.\n\nRaised in Fort Smith, John graduated from Northside High School and went on to play football for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks while completing his pre-optometry requirements. He graduated from the Southern College of Optometry in 1977 and entered private practice that same year co-founding a family business with his brother that would ultimately become a major provider of eye care to Northwest Arkansas.\n\nDecades of experience as a successful healthcare provider and a small business owner guide John’s approach to governing. He is committed to advocating for economic policies that help Arkansas’s small businesses continue to grow and add jobs to our state’s economy. And since agriculture accounts for nearly one-quarter of Arkansas’s economic activity, John has been a consistent champion for our state’s farmers, ranchers and loggers and was instrumental in the fight for an equitable farm bill.\n\nAs the son of an Air Force Master Sergeant, John learned at an early age about the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, as well as the unique challenges military families face. He brings these values with him to Washington where he is committed to enhancing the quality of life for both our veterans and their families. John has authored provisions to extend successful federal homeless veteran programs, expand treatments for our wounded warriors and modernize educational benefits under the GI Bill.\n\nJohn serves on five committees in the 115th Congress:\n\nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\nSubcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management and Trade (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on Rural Development and Energy\n\nSubcommittee on Conservation, Forestry and Natural Resources\n\nSubcommittee on Nutrition, Agriculture Research and Specialty Crops\n\nAppropriations\n\nSubcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on Homeland Security\n\nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government\n\nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies\n\nSubcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs\n\nSubcommittee on Transportation, Housing & Urban Development and Related Agencies\n\nBudget\n\nEnvironment and Public Works (EPW)\n\nSubcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Water (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety\n\nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure\n\nVeterans’ Affairs\n\nAlong with these committees, John serves on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, commonly referred to as the Helsinki Commission, and the Congressional Study Group on Europe (CSGE), a bipartisan organization dedicated to frank and candid dialogue between American lawmakers and their peers in European capitals and Brussels.

When she learned that her own daughter was at risk for being trafficked simply because she wasn't aware of the dangers that surrounded her daughter and other teens every day, she knew she had to take action. She couldn't imagine living the nightmare of losing a child and was going to do everything in her power to equip parents to avoid that same fate. Parents Against Child Trafficking or \"PACT\" was founded in 2016 as a result of that passion.\n\nBarbara graduated Summa Cum Laude from Pittsburg State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Education and a Minor in Psychology.\n\nBarbara wholeheartedly believes that one person can make a difference, and her 15-year professional career at Walmart has only served to reinforce this message. After two years in Sustainability, Barbara transitioned to the Responsible Sourcing division, where she managed supply chain investigations into such matters as forced labor and child labor. This work opened her eyes to the hidden nature of modern day slavery and the impact it had on real people around the world. Today, Barbara is focused on influencing the social compliance industry toward meaningful change through collaboration with a broad spectrum of stakeholders around the world. In 2017, Barbara was selected to co-lead the internationally-based Sedex Forced Labor Working Group. She has been active in the Walmart Women’s Resource Council and is a current member of Toastmasters International.\n\nIn the community, Barbara is a dynamic force when it comes to raising awareness about trafficking, facilitating at victim services trainings, and sponsoring trafficking prevention activities in partnership with Hub of HOPE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\n\nIn a society where phones are closer than friends and relationships are managed by text messaging, “ultimate safety can only be achieved by forming a close bond with our children.” PACT is the only organization of its kind – an organization that equips parents to encourage, enable and support one another “to protect their children against the advances of child traffickers and other predators.”\n\nKimberly Hank\n\nInto the Light\n\nKimberly began volunteering for Into the Light in 2015 presenting our Traps of the Trafficker prevention program in local Juvenile Detention Centers.

The goal was to design a place where people of all ages and abilities can come together and have a fun adventure.\n\nThe existing play equipment was removed and the site leveled to allow for better visibility. New play equipment and individual learning stations are connected by a series of accessible ramps leading up to an elevated central pavilion. The play equipment along adventure path is designed to engage children in not only physical activities, but to stimulate discovery of their world through experiencing a series of stations exploring seven different senses.\n\nFabric canopies and trees provide shade during the hot summer months. The area around the play equipment is covered with a shock absorbent rubberized material that is ADA compliant and designed to reduce danger from falls.\n\nOur Club is proud of this conribution to the City of Springdale where everyone can play!\n\nShare\n\nRandal Tyson Recreation Park & Rotary Family Park\n\n1984-85 - Club members began exploring additional ways to serve the community and a fitness trail was chosen as a viable project. Willard Walker suggested the Club coordinate the project with the City.\n\nDon Tyson donated 40 acres of land. Willard and Pat Walker donated an additional 30 acres, and 70 acres were available for a park. In the Fall of 1984, the City Council accepted a plan to use 58 acres for youth and adult recreation fields, and 12 acres which Rotary would develop into a Family Park. The Club later purchased an additional 5 acres for the Family Park.\n\nThe City of Springdale committed over $2,000,000. The Schmieding Foundation and the Tyson Foundation contributed generously for concession stands and tennis courts. Gerald and Marge Tweedy gave over $100,000 to begin Rotary Park. The Club invested over $300,000 in the park. Gerald Harp gave the handicap accessible playground in memory of his late sister, Judy Harp Van Hoose.\n\nOn a cold October day, Club members planted 125 trees purchased by Gerald Harp. Rotarians spent hours clearing the area, planting the trees, and grooming the park.\n\nFinally, it was ready, and officially dedicated on Labor Day, 1990.\n\n“Dreams do become reality! If you don’t believe it, drive out to the Park and see the results. I hope that as far as our Park is concerned Rotary will continue to dream and that years from now Rotarians will be working on a beautification project for the park. While working on these new projects, they will undoubtedly pause and read the names of the Rotarians that dared to dream years before and made this dream a reality.” Don L. Gibson, Park Project Co-Chairman, May 2, 1990.\n\nShare"
