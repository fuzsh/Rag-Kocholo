The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:31 a.m., in Room SD-608, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Enzi, Grassley, Crapo, Graham, Toomey, Johnson, Corker, Perdue, Gardner, Kennedy, Boozman, Sanders, Murray, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Warner, Merkley, Kaine, King, Van Hollen, and Harris. Staff Present: Dan Kowalski, Republican Deputy Staff Director; George Everly, Chief Counsel; for the Minority: Warren Gunnels, Minority Staff Director; Robert Etter, Minority Chief Counsel; and Joshua Smith, Budget Policy Director OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN ENZI Chairman Enzi. Good morning, and welcome to everyone here. I will call this hearing to order. We are here today to consider the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I am going to try to keep my opening remarks brief since we have a pair of Senators before us who are going to give some introductory remarks of their own concerning the nominee. President Trump indicated his intent to nominate Representative Mulvaney for this position a little over a month ago. I think all the members of this Committee can agree that we would like to see a confirmed OMB Director in place as soon as possible, so I am happy to note that the other committee of jurisdiction over OMB, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, will be convening this afternoon to hold their own hearing with Representative Mulvaney. We need an OMB Director in place with so many pressing budgetary issues requiring the attention of the new administration. Foremost among these is the staggering $20 trillion debt burden America now shoulders. Congress needs an OMB Director who we can work with to put our Nation on a responsible fiscal path. That is why I am pleased that President Trump nominated a fiscal conservative for this key post. The Representative has been a vigilant budget hawk during his 6 years in Congress, including during his tenure on the House Budget and Oversight committees. He has been a vocal contributor to the great budget debates of recent years, focused on questions of how we ultimately stop the Federal Government from overspending while continuing to fund the country's core priorities and responsibilities. Representative Mulvaney has been a prominent voice arguing for fiscal restraint, balanced budgets, and honest budgeting that avoids the use of gimmicks such as emergency funding designation for non-emergencies. I have also discussed with Representative Mulvaney the urgent need to reform the broken budget process, which has contributed to the budgetary stalemate and recurrent continuing resolutions to which Congress now routinely resorts in order to postpone hard decisions about spending and debt. There is an urgent need for important reforms to the process such as implementing biennial budgeting and the overhaul of outdated budget accounting concepts that have outlived their usefulness. Ultimately, my goal is to produce comprehensive and lasting budget process reforms that put our Nation on a better fiscal path. Despite its significance, the preparation of the President's annual budget submission is only one of the responsibilities of OMB. As an entity within the Executive Office of the President, OMB has numerous government wide management responsibilities in addition to budgeting and spending that concern various activities carried out by Federal agencies. These include: agency rulemaking, contracting, grants management, financial management, information technology, program assessment, personnel policy, property management, and several others. I am particularly interested in hearing Representative Mulvaney's view on the role played by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, in vetting agency regulations. This Committee has been exploring the concept of a regulatory budget as one way to produce a check on the growing burden of regulations on the American economy and more so to small business. Also, since he is the House sponsor of a companion bill to recently enacted legislation concerning improper payments, I am interested in Representative Mulvaney's view on how he believes we can reduce the growing volume of improper payments made by the Federal Government each year. The annual amount reached $144 billion in 2016, and the cumulative amount of improper payments since we started counting them in 2003 exceeds $1 trillion. Senator Sanders. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SANDERS Senator Sanders. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and we welcome the discussion that we will be having with Mr. Mulvaney for this very, very important position. And I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the new members of this Committee, Senator Van Hollen and Senator Harris on our side, and Senator Gardner, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Boozman on your side. And I look forward to working with all of you. Mr. Chairman, you and I may not agree on too much, but I think we can all agree that President Trump ran a very unconventional campaign and that he told the American people that he would govern as a very unconventional Republican. I think that is fair. We can maybe get unanimous consent on that one. And over and over again, in fact, the cornerstone--one of the cornerstones of his campaign was that he was not going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He was not ambiguous about this. He did not say this in an ambush interview at 3 o'clock in the morning. He said this over and over and over again. And I suspect that many millions of senior citizens in this country or millions of working-class people who do not want to see Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid cut voted for him for that reason. And I am just going to read a few of the quotes--with your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would enter into the record many of the quotes--that President Trump said on the campaign trail. He said on May 7, 2015, ``I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.'' April 18, 2015, Trump said, ``Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security. They want to do it on Medicare; they want to do it on Medicaid. And we cannot do that. And it is not fair to the people that have been paying in for years. And now all of a sudden, they want to be cut.'' August 10, 2015, Trump said, ``I will save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts. We have to do it. People have been paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to cut it.'' Last quote, March 29, 2016, Trump said, ``You know, Paul Ryan wants to knock out Social Security, knock it down, way down. He wants to knock Medicare way down. And, frankly, well, two things: number one, you are going to lose the election if you are going to do that. I am not going to cut it. And I am not going to raise ages, and I am not going to do all of the things they want to do. But they want to really cut it, and they want to cut it very substantially, the Republicans. And I am not going to do that.'' Those are quotes from the President of the United States when he was on the campaign trail. Now the election is over. Mr. Trump or President Trump still sends out a whole lot of tweets. But, surprisingly enough, I have not seen that tweet where he says, ``I am going to keep my campaign promise, and I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.'' I am waiting eagerly for that tweet, as are millions of seniors and working people in this country. So the issue that we are discussing today is: A, will the President keep his campaign promises, and B, will he appoint people to his Cabinet who will help him keep those campaign promises? And now we get to Congressman Mulvaney. And to Congressman Mulvaney, I want to thank him for coming into our office. We had, I thought, a very productive, interesting discussion. But his views on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are exactly opposite of what Trump campaigned on. Let me quickly run through Congressman Mulvaney's record. May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on Fox Business News, ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said, ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said, ``You have to raise the retirement age, lower a payout, change the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave Social Security the way it is.'' On May 17, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said, ``I honestly do not think we went far enough with the Ryan budget because it did not cut Social Security and Medicare rapidly enough.'' And, in fact, just last year, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the budget proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker Ryan, opting instead to vote in favor of an even more extreme budget by the Republican Study Committee. This radical right-wing budget that Congressman Mulvaney supported cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the Price-Ryan budget. It cut Social Security by $184 billion more, and it cut Medicaid and other health programs by $255 billion more than the budget proposed by Chairman Price and Speaker Ryan. Moreover--and this is also interesting--in May of 2009, when Congressman Mulvaney was a member of the South Carolina State Senate, he voted for an amendment declaring Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Education unconstitutional. And let me read the text of that amendment: ``Whereas, many Federal mandates, such as those which created the U.S. Department of Education, Medicaid, and the United States Social Security Administration, are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.'' That amendment in the South Carolina Senate was defeated by a vote of 35-6. Mr. Mulvaney was one of the six. In my view, the opinions and ideas of Mr. Mulvaney are way out of touch with what the American people want and, more importantly, they are way, way out of touch with what President Trump campaigned on. And while we can all disagree on many issues, I would hope we can agree that if somebody campaigns-- as I am sure many of my Republican colleagues have, you campaign on a set of issues--that you keep your promise. And I suspect Chairman Enzi does that. He tells people how he feels, and then he keeps his word. We disagree; he keeps his word. But it does not make sense to me to have a key adviser to the President having views directly in opposition to what the President campaigned on. Last point: I have come to learn during the confirmation review process--we have come to learn during the nominating process here that Mr. Mulvaney failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny that he employed from 2000 to 2004. And here is what Congressman Mulvaney wrote about this issue in response to a question that I asked him on January 11th: ``I have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through 2004. Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the Federal taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and unemployment was $15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are not yet determined.'' Mr. Chairman, this is a serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator Daschle withdrew his nomination as Secretary of HHS after it was discovered that he failed to pay his fair share of taxes. Mr. Chairman, on this issue I agree with Minority Leader Schumer, who said, ``When other previous Cabinet nominees failed to pay their fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees to withdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should be true for Republican nominees.'' End of Schumer quote. In 2015, Mr. Chairman, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that clearly stated, and I quote, ``Any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an employee of the Federal Government.'' Mr. Chairman, I look forward to asking Mr. Mulvaney questions, and thank you for the time. Chairman Enzi. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Before we swear in the witness and hear his testimony, we will hear today a little about the nominee from our Budget Committee colleague, Senator Graham, as well as Senator Cotton. Senator Graham and Representative Mulvaney are fellow South Carolinians, and Senator Cotton served in the House with Representative Mulvaney. Senator Graham. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE LINDSEY GRAHAM, A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA Senator Graham. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am honored to be here to introduce Congressman Mulvaney, ``Mick.'' He is my buddy. We do not agree on everything, but I think he is one of the most capable people I have met during my time in public service. And we have a real friendship. We play golf. He always beats me. I accept that. He has a beautiful wife and triplets. Just remember that when you talk to him. He is sincere. Clearly, Senator Sanders would not have chosen him for his OMB Director. I think we have established that. Why would Trump, President Trump, pick a man, according to Senator Sanders, that does not agree with anything he stands for? I would argue that he picked Congressman Mulvaney because he understands he knows the budget, he will be a good overseer of the Government, he is a practical guy, and he will follow the President's vision. President Trump understands everything you said about Congressman Mulvaney, and he has confidence in this man's ability to do a job for his administration. I share that confidence. To those on the defense side, he will follow the call of the President to increase defense spending. He does believe in entitlement reform, and I think he is right to do so, to save these programs. So from a personal point of view, I have never had an occasion where he would not tell me exactly what he believed even if he knew I disagreed with it. And he is able to disagree with people in an honorable fashion, and he is incredibly smart. He has made it his life's work to understand what is wrong with our Government, and he will be dedicated to fixing it. And one final point of personal privilege. I voted, I think, for every nominee of President Obama. I think every one of them. I asked myself why I did that now. The reason I did it is I think elections have consequences. And while I disagreed with almost every nominee about the basic structure of Government, I understood that President Obama needed his team and deserved his team, if they were qualified. And here is what I would ask this Committee to consider: Give this man's life experience, his background in the public sector and the private sector, his time in Congress, do you believe he is qualified to understand how the Federal Government works and to reform it consistent with what the President will direct him to do? I believe that with all my heart and soul, and I appreciate you listening to Congressman Mulvaney. And any hard question you can ask, you are doing your job. Just realize elections have consequences for you as they did for me. Chairman Enzi. Thank you. Senator Cotton. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE TOM COTTON, A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Senator Cotton. Chairman Enzi, Senator Sanders, thank you for allowing me to appear today. I want to add my voice in support of confirming Mick Mulvaney as the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mick and I have known each other for many years now. We served together in the House of Representatives. He is a good friend of mine and a trusted confidant. So I speak from personal experience when I say he will serve our President and our Nation with distinction. The way I see it, the Director's chief job is to give the President the unvarnished truth. He has to tell the President exactly what things cost, partly to the President's agenda, but mostly to the taxpayer. The President, of course, sets the agenda, but he deserves a clear-eyed view, not rose-colored glasses. And for the last 6 years, Mick has been telling many hard truths: We are spending too much. Regulations are strangling our small businesses. And short-changing our military will only cost us more in the long run. He also understands perhaps the hardest truth of all, at least for the big spenders in Washington: It is the American people who earned this money through their hard work and sacrifice. Mick will treat every taxpayer dollar as if it were his own. And trust me, that means he will watch it like a hawk. In Arkansas, many people stop me to ask what we are doing about the national debt. It is a huge concern. So with his eagle-eyed focus on spending, Mick will be a crucial voice in the Cabinet. He will represent millions of Americans who are deeply worried about the burden we are leaving our children. And while Mick is deeply principled, he knows how to work with others and make progress wherever we can. In short, Mick is a fine choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, so I urge you not only to advance his nomination, but to do so as soon as possible. Under the law, the President is required to submit a budget to Congress early next month, which will be very difficult without a new Director. I hope the full Senate will also confirm him promptly. Thank you for your time today and your consideration of a passionate advocate for the taxpayer, a bold truth teller, and my friend, Mick Mulvaney. Chairman Enzi. Thank you, Senator Graham and Senator Cotton. You have done a great job speaking about Representative Mulvaney, so I will keep my own remarks very brief. Representative Mulvaney is now in his fourth term as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 5th District of South Carolina. He holds an undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He is a husband, and he is the father of triplets. We thank you for joining us today, Representative Mulvaney, and we look forward to a productive dialogue, which will begin with your own testimony. But, first, under the rules of the Committee, nominees are required to testify under oath. So would you please join me as I administer the oath? Do you swear the testimony that you will give to the Senate Budget Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Mr. Mulvaney. I do. Chairman Enzi. If asked to do so and if given reasonable notice, will you agree to appear before this Committee in the future and answer any questions that members of the Committee might have? Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. Chairman Enzi. Thank you. Please be seated. We now have a chance to hear from you. TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICK MULVANEY, OF SOUTH CAROLINA, TO BE DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Mr. Mulvaney. I thank the Committee, I thank the Chairman, I thank the Ranking Member. It is an honor to be here today to present my qualifications and my vision for the Office of Management and Budget. I want to thank the President for nominating me and showing confidence in me in doing so. I thank especially Senators Graham and Cotton, friends of mind, for their kind words. I want to thank especially, before we get started, my family. As the members of this Committee know, the burdens of our public service so often fall on those at home, and I am--we do not get a chance to say this nearly enough, and we certainly do not get a chance to say it very often on national television: I am extraordinarily proud of the young people that my 17-year-old triplets have become. I do not know if it is because I have been away from home or despite the fact I have been away from home, but the fact that they are the young people they are is a tremendous testament to my wife, who is with me today. The children are back in school. I am extraordinarily happy and proud to have her in my life, and I could not be here today but for the support of my family. Finally, I am grateful to the members of the Committee for taking all the time over the course of the last couple of weeks to get together and talk about the issues, as we talked about my vision for the OMB and what type of OMB Director I might be, if you see fit to confirm me. I look forward to continuing those conversations and getting your guidance and wisdom, because I think we all know that no one--no one--can do this job alone. Perhaps a Member of Congress knows that better than most. Several former Members of these bodies have served at OMB. Senator Portman, Jim Nussle, Leon Panetta--they all served with distinction, and they all set a very high bar and provided a good example of how OMB is supposed to function to serve the President and to work with Congress and the American people. If confirmed, I will use them as models. You deserve the truth about budget matters, as do the American people and the President, and it is the OMB Director's responsibility to tell you and the President the truth, even from time to time when that might be hard to hear. One truth is this: For the first time in America's history, the next generation could be less prosperous than the previous. I know that is unacceptable to every single person in this room, as it is unacceptable to me. We can turn the economy around. We can turn the country around. But it is going to take difficult decisions today in order to avoid nearly impossible decisions tomorrow. Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion. That is a number so large as to almost defy description. I choose to look at it in a different fashion. I choose to look at it through the lens of the ordinary American family. If you are an ordinary American family, the equivalent to you of a $20 trillion debt is a credit card bill of $260,000. American families know what that would mean to them, and it is time that this Government learns what it means to us. I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are necessary in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our Government's long term fiscal path, which is unsustainable. Part of that also means taking a hard look at Government waste--and ending it. American taxpayers deserve a Government that is efficient, effective, and accountable. They earn their money honestly, and they deserve a Government that spends it in the same fashion. But fixing the economy does not mean just taking a green eyeshade approach to the budget. Our country is more than just numbers. A strong, healthy economy also allows us to take care of our most vulnerable. My mother-in-law relied on Social Security in her retirement; she relied on Medicare to help her before she died of cancer. Pam and I were happy to have that safety net there for her. Pam and I would also like that safety net to be there for her grandchildren, our triplets. All of that being said, I know many of the members of this Committee will want to know my positions, should I be Director, as OMB Director. I am, of course, not yet in that position and do not presume to know about decisions I might make, much less what decisions the President might make after consulting with his Cabinet and his advisers. I do know what I believe, however, and I look forward to discussing whatever topics you consider relevant today. I have not exactly been a shy Member of Congress in my 6 years here, and I do not expect to end that today, or as Director of OMB if you see fit to confirm me. At the same time, I recognize that good public service-- whether that in the State legislature, the House, the Senate, OMB--takes both courage and wisdom, the courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen. I have learned in my time in Washington that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the cogent arguments of others--matter. My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach and to listen to various ideas on how to get our financial house in order. OMB also fulfills significant management responsibilities, performs a regulatory role, has a bunch of other responsibilities that I know you folks are as familiar with as anybody, and I look forward to talking about those today as well. I look forward to talking about all of those issues, my qualifications, and anything else the Committee sees fit. If confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress--and serving the President--to address all the challenges on behalf of the American people. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your time and for the opportunity to be here. [The prepared statement of Mr. Mulvaney follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Enzi. Thank you. Now we will turn to questions for Representative Mulvaney. Let me take a minute to explain the process for all Committee members before we start. Each member will have 5 minutes for questions, beginning with myself and Senator Sanders. Following the two of us, I will alternate questions between the Republicans and the minority. All members who were in attendance when the hearing began will be recognized in order of seniority. For those who arrived after the hearing began, you are on the list in the order of arrival. If it is your turn to be on the list to be recognized and you are not here, you will be moved to the bottom of the list and get to ask questions at that point. When everyone else is done, you will be recognized. Now, once all the Senators present have had an opportunity to question the nominee, I will allow a second round of questions if there is interest in doing that. Representative Mulvaney is scheduled to appear before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee later this afternoon, so this hearing will end no later than 1:30 p.m. to accommodate that schedule. With that, I have a few questions. I believe that significant savings could be found by eliminating duplication and waste, fraud, and overpayment across the Federal Government. You introduced the companion bill in the House to legislation signed into law last Congress as the Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act. That was a bipartisan bill that addresses a very real and growing problem that you would be in a position to help tackle as OMB Director. I even saw a recent report that the Department of Defense lost $125 billion. I do not know what ``lost'' means. Do you believe that significant budgetary savings can be found by reducing duplication, waste, fraud, and overpayment? And what do you see is the role of OMB in identifying and addressing these problems? Mr. Mulvaney. Chairman, I think you mentioned in your opening statement the recent finding that the amount of improper payments has now grown to historic levels. It is now past $100 million and on its way to--excuse me, $100 billion and on its way to $200 billion. I think it is one of the reasons that the improper payments bill, which I believe Senator Johnson and Mrs. McCaskill, Senator McCaskill, also worked on in the Senate, and passed on a bipartisan basis in the House. I will never forget when we actually started working on that bill in the House. I was working on it with Patrick Murphy from Florida, and he is a Democrat, and we were talking about it one day. And I said, ``Patrick, it is kind of unusual working on this together.'' He said, ``Mick, what you have to understand is that I am a Democrat and I believe the Government should be doing more. You are Republican, and you probably believe that Government should be doing less. But we all hate bad Government.'' And I think that is right, and I think you have hit the nail on the head on an opportunity that we have on a bipartisan basis to be better stewards of the taxpayer dollars. The Improper Payments Act, as I understand it, has gotten off to a choppy start. The report that is required by the legislation I believe is either finished or close to being finished. But in terms of actually putting the plan of action into place, it is already behind schedule. And to your point about who can help fix that, the answer is OMB. OMB could use the budget function to make sure that these agencies comply with the law. They are required by law to start using these best management practices, to start using--there are several agencies that do a great job of preventing improper payments. I will never forget when my uncle died a few years ago, I got a letter--I was the executor of his estate. I got a letter within a week of his death from the Social Security Administration saying, ``When you get his next check, do not cash it, or else you will be violating Federal law.'' So, clearly, there are agencies that do a good job. The question is: Why aren't those agencies sharing their best practices? That was part of the motivation behind the improper payments bill that we passed. I just think that it is time to take it a little bit more seriously, and if given the opportunity at OMB, I would certainly do that. Chairman Enzi. Thank you, and I appreciate your service and your willingness to serve. It was mentioned in the opening remarks of the Ranking Member, and I notice that you chose to bring to the attention of this Committee an issue recently identified that resulted in you amending prior tax returns. Can you describe this issue and whether you brought it to the attention of the IRS or whether it was discovered through an audit? Have you voluntarily paid any and all additional taxes, fees, and penalties that you discovered that you owed? Mr. Mulvaney. I have, Senator. Thank you for that, and I have been happy to discuss it with anybody who has raised it during my various meetings. In 2000, we had triplets. When they came home, we hired someone to help my wife take care of the children. In our minds, she was a babysitter. She did not live with us. She did not spend the night there. She did not cook, she did not clean, she did not educate the children. She helped my wife with the kids. I did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding and did not withhold--and did not think about it again until 2 days after the President had nominated me for this position. And during the transition, I got a checklist: Have you ever had a babysitter, a nanny, an au pair, a governess, whatever? And I said yes. And then they sent me an IRS circular. It was the first time I had seen it, and I read it, and it made it immediately clear to me that I had made a mistake and that the IRS viewed our babysitter as a household employee for whom we should have withheld taxes. I did the only thing I knew to do, which is simply tell everybody who I thought would care. I told the President, I told the transition team. I called my CPA and said, ``Look, what is the best way to fix this? It is a mistake. It has been made. I now know about it. How do we fix it?'' The CPA and I went through the process of filing, I believe, Schedule H for the relevant years. We paid the taxes, also notified the IRS of what we were doing and why. And then I told everybody on this Committee--in fact, I told everybody in the Senate and apparently told the media as well. It is the only thing I knew to do, Mr. Chairman. We made a mistake in my family, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I did the only thing I knew to do, which was to take every step to fix it. I will pay any penalties, any interest, any late fees, and abide by the law to the best of my ability. Chairman Enzi. Thank you. And to put this in context for the Committee, in 1993, President Clinton nominated Mr. Ron Brown to be the Secretary of Commerce and Mr. Federico Pena to be the Secretary of Transportation. Both of these nominees had to pay back taxes on domestic employees, and yet both were confirmed. President Clinton also nominated Mrs. Zoe Baird to be the Attorney General. Mrs. Baird withdrew her nomination because she had hired an illegal immigrant and failed to pay taxes. While she did not become Attorney General, Mrs. Baird did serve in the Clinton administration on the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Committee and in the Obama administration on the U.S. Secretary of Commerce's Digital Economy Board of Advisers. In 2009, President Obama nominated Mr. Timothy Geithner to be the Secretary of the Treasury. Even though Mr. Geithner failed to pay $35,000 in Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on his own income and was in charge of the IRS after being confirmed, he was confirmed. Mr. Sanders. Senator Sanders. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congressman Mulvaney, I have talked to some Members of the House whose views are very different than yours, but they say you are a straight shooter, that you are honest, and I appreciate that. That is a good quality in a Member of Congress. Over the weekend, I happened to bump into a psychologist, and she told me that her patients are getting very nervous, those who are on disability benefits, that they might lose their benefits. And, in fact, their conditions are getting worse. I have heard that all over the country, that people now are worried that they may lose Social Security, may lose Medicare, may lose Medicaid, disability benefits. I happen to believe that Social Security is one of the most significant and important and positive programs that the United States Government has; that Medicare, by and large, is an enormously successful health care program; and, in fact, the majority of the American people would like to see Medicare expanded to all Americans, something that I believe; and that Medicaid right now is saving the lives of millions of people. But you are on record time after time after time--and I read the quotes--as saying cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid. Now, what concerns me is you are more than entitled to your views. You get elected by the people in your own district. But what does disturb me is we have a President who ran on a set of principles that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and yet he is nominating somebody whose views are very, very different. So I have a real problem with that. So my question to you is: What will you tell the President when he says, ``I ran on a set of principles that I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid''? Will you tell the President of the United States, ``Mr. President, keep your word, be honest with the American people, do not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid''? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, your question was what would I tell the President, and I listened as Senator Cotton was giving his introduction, and I really liked what he said. I did not know what he was going to say until he said it. But he gave you the answer, which is the only thing I know to do is to tell the President the truth, and the truth is that if we do not reform these programs that are so important to your constituents in Vermont and to mine in South Carolina, I believe in 9 or 10 years the Medicaid trust fund is empty. In roughly 17 or 18 years, the Social Security trust fund is empty. We can choose to do something about that now, or we can choose to do something about that---- Senator Sanders. Well, there is a lot--forgive me for interrupting. I only have 5 minutes. There is a lot that we can do, including lifting the cap on income above $250,000, which would enable us to extend and expand Social Security very significantly. But the problem that I am having right now is not just your nomination but the integrity and the honesty of somebody who ran for office on one set of principles, nominating somebody else whose views are very different. But let me ask you another question. When you were a member of the South Carolina Senate, you voted for a proposition that said Social Security is unconstitutional. Do you believe that Social Security is unconstitutional? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. That was brought to my attention this morning before the hearing. I do not remember the vote, but I can assure you as I sit here today, I do not believe that Social Security or Medicare are unconstitutional. Senator Sanders. You were one of six members of the South Carolina State Legislature to vote on a proposition that said Social Security, the Department of Education, and Medicaid are in violation of the Tenth Amendment. You no longer hold the view that Social Security is unconstitutional? Mr. Mulvaney. I believe you, Senator. I have no reason to disbelieve that. But, again, as I sit here, I will not be arguing to the President of the United States that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional. Senator Sanders. Mr. Mulvaney, Congressman, in July 2015, you wrote a letter stating, and I quote, ``I vehemently urge House Republican leadership to use every available tool to strip Planned Parenthood of any and all taxpayer funds and take measures to prevent the group from receiving taxpayer dollars in the future.'' Some 2.5 million Americans, many of them low-income women, now get their health care through Planned Parenthood. At a time when we have 28 million people who have no health insurance today, despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act, you really believe that we should tell 2.5 million Americans, many of them low-income women, who get high quality care at Planned Parenthood, that they should no longer have access to Planned Parenthood? I hear a lot of talk in this body from our Republican friends about choice, we want to give people choice. Two and a half million Americans, many low-income women, choose Planned Parenthood as their choice for health care. Why would you deny them that choice? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, I do not have the letter in front of me, but I do remember the debate, and I also remember what I voted for, and it may have been addressed in the letter. The proposal that the House put forward in July of 2015 would have moved the money from Planned Parenthood to the federally qualified health care clinics, which are more prevalent, more available, and actually serve more needy women than Planned---- Senator Sanders. Congressman, I know a lot about the community health centers. I am one of the leading advocates for them here and helped increase funding for them. But 2.5 million people, mostly women, have chosen Planned Parenthood. And after all the talk about choice, that we want a health care system which allows people to go anyplace they want, your recommendation is that we should deny 2.5 million women their choice of health care. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Enzi. Thank you. Senator Graham. Senator Graham. What percent of GDP will be spent on defense if we go back into sequestration by 2021? Mr. Mulvaney. Let me see. If we go back into sequestration by twenty--it is going to be down, Lindsey--excuse me, Senator Graham, it is going to be well below 4 percent. It may be closer to 2. But it is between 2 and 4 percent. Senator Graham. 2.3 percent. Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. Senator Graham. Okay. What is the historical average of defense spending since World War II? Mr. Mulvaney. 4-ish? Senator Graham. Closer to 5. Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. Senator Graham. Do you support President Trump's initiative to increase defense spending? Mr. Mulvaney. I do. Senator Graham. Are you aware that almost 50 percent of defense spending involves personnel costs? Mr. Mulvaney. I do. Senator Graham. So if you want a bigger army, you are going to have more personnel costs. If you want a bigger navy, you are going to have personnel costs. Mr. Mulvaney. That is what the numbers would tell you, yes. Senator Graham. Are you willing to reform personnel programs to make it more sustainable, generous but sustainable? Mr. Mulvaney. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to do just that. Senator Graham. Entitlement reform: What drives the debt? What is the chief driver of the debt? Mr. Mulvaney. The entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Senator Graham. Okay. The deficit and the debt are different things. Explain it very quickly, the difference between the deficit and the debt. Mr. Mulvaney. The deficit is this year's shortfalls between revenues and expenditures. The debt is the accumulation of deficits over the years. Senator Graham. The baby-boom generation will be retiring en masse here. What happens to Medicare and Social Security over the next 25 years? Mr. Mulvaney. They go up. Senator Graham. Okay. In 1950, how many workers were there for every Social Security recipient? Mr. Mulvaney. 15, 16 at some point. Senator Graham. 16. How many are there today? Mr. Mulvaney. Three. Senator Graham. How many will there be in 20 years? Mr. Mulvaney. Two. Senator Graham. How can two people do what 16 people used to do? Mr. Mulvaney. The short answer is that they cannot. Senator Graham. Are we living longer or shorter? Mr. Mulvaney. Longer. Senator Graham. So we are living longer, there are fewer workers, and more people are retiring. Mr. Mulvaney. Those are the hard facts, yes, sir. Senator Graham. Will you tell President Trump that if he ignores that, he can never get us out of debt? Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. Senator Graham. Will you tell him that the promise you made about Medicare and Social Security is going to lead to their demise if you do not change that promise? Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. Senator Graham. Will you tell him that there is a bipartisan way to do this that has been studied extensively without gutting the program but saving the program? Mr. Mulvaney. I am familiar with that, yes, sir. Senator Graham. Would you agree with me that for younger workers, they may have to work longer before they enter the program to save the program? Mr. Mulvaney. I have already told my children to prepare for exactly that. Senator Graham. Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill adjusted the age of retirement from 65 to 67 to save Social Security. Is that accurate? Mr. Mulvaney. That is true. Senator Graham. Do you think we need to look at adjusting the age yet again because we live longer? Mr. Mulvaney. I do, yes, sir. Senator Graham. Do you think people in my income level should get a subsidy to pay their Medicare bill? Mr. Mulvaney. I believe that Medicare benefits should and could be means-tested. Senator Graham. What percentage of Medicare comes from the general treasury? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, that is one I do not know. Senator Graham. I think it is over 60 percent. Isn't it true that if we do not change that, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security combined will consume all the revenue that the American people send in taxes by 2042? Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. In fact, I think this year it will be close to 75 percent for just those three major programs alone. Senator Graham. Isn't it true that if we do nothing, we are going to have to either dramatically increase taxes or cut benefits in the next decade to 15 years? Mr. Mulvaney. If we do nothing, then by the time I retire, there will be an across-the-board 22-percent cut to Social Security benefits. Senator Graham. Are you in a situation where you could give up some of your promised benefits from Social Security if you had to? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, if I may--and I enjoy the rapid fire because this is what we do when we talk, right? But I would want to take a second to tell a story. I talked about the ideas to save Social Security at a Sun City Retirement Community in my district. You have been there several times. And I talked about slowly raising the retirement age. And there was a gentleman there who was 59--you have to be 55 to live there-- and he goes, ``Well, I do not want to work until I am 70.'' And I said, ``Well, no, our proposal''--at the time in the House-- ``would require you to work an extra 2 months.'' And he was flabbergasted. He said, ``Wait a second. You mean I can help fix this by working 2 more months?'' And I said yeah. And he was angry that it was actually that easy to do. And I said, ``Well, if you want to really be angry, if we had fixed it 20 years ago, it might be 2 extra weeks. But if we wait another 10 years, it might be 2 years.'' So we do have the chance to fix these programs now. Senator Graham. Very well said. Senator Sanders says that one way to save Social Security is to increase--lift the cap on people that make over $250,000. Can you repair the gap between Medicare and the unfunded liability by doing that? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. As I have told people and as I have shared with---- Senator Graham. You cannot even come close. Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. Social Security---- Senator Graham. So if you took the entire wealth of the 1 percent, everything including their dogs, could you repair the gap? Mr. Mulvaney. You can confiscate everything they have, and the answer to your question would be no. Senator Graham. Could you grow the economy at 8 percent and close the gap? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. Senator Graham. Thank you. Chairman Enzi. Senator Stabenow. Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Congressman Mulvaney, to you and your family. I have to say after that interchange, I think folks on Social Security and Medicare ought to be really worried, and it just demonstrated the difference between what President Trump has indicated he would do and what, in fact, you will be advising him, Congressman Mulvaney, if, in fact, as you indicated and Senator Cotton indicated, you would give him the unvarnished truth. So I believe people sitting on this side of the aisle believe Medicare and Social Security are great American success stories that have lifted a generation of seniors out of poverty and created health care certainty for many, many Americans. And I am thinking after that exchange that for the 57 million seniors and people with disabilities and surviving spouses and children who receive Social Security benefits, the alarm bells should be going off right now. But let me go back. As a straight shooter, which I certainly respect, you did indicate that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. Is that something that you will say to the President? And you did indicate that both Social Security and Medicaid and the Department of Education were unconstitutional. So just keeping it to Social Security, do you intend to indicate to the President that you believe Social Security is a Ponzi scheme? Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you for that, Senator, and I had a very similar conversation on this exact same topic with Senator Sanders in his office when he asked me about that. And I said, ``Well, what I described it as was a plan that takes money from people now in order to give money to people now.'' And he explained--and I think he was accurate in doing so--that Social Security has always been like that. So I would not read too much into the description of it as a ``Ponzi scheme.'' It is simply describing to people how the cash flows. And the difficulty that we face was contained in what Mr. Graham just laid through, which is 50 years ago, 15 people were paying in and 1 person was taking out. And by the time my kids are paying for my retirement, two of them will be paying in for every one that is taking out. Senator Stabenow. And is it also true, though--you and I talked in the office about the fact the cap was set in 1983, awhile ago, at 90 percent of wage income. And it goes up a little bit. But one significant way to take a burden off of Social Security and keep it going strong for those who rely on it--and, by the way, about a third of seniors basically live on the money solely from Social Security, maybe a little bit of a pension, but those pensions are being challenged right now as well. So do you think the cap should be increased as a basic sense of fairness in terms of the fact that the last cap was set in 1983? Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you for that. If the Senate sees fit to confirm me, Senator--and I believe I had this conversation with just about everybody from both parties that I met with, including the Independent, who is not from any party--there are really five levers in Social Security that you can pull---- Senator Stabenow. No, I understand all five, and I am sorry, because I have one more question I want to ask after this. Mr. Mulvaney. Sure. Senator Stabenow. I know there are five. I am asking you about one. Mr. Mulvaney. And you have mentioned one, and I think if you pull one lever, you have to pull it a long way. And if you pulled three or four or five levers, you do not have to pull them nearly as far. Senator Stabenow. Okay. Thank you. And I want to completely change to something that I may be the only one to raise, although a couple of colleagues on the other side may as well, and that is, a very important part of the budget called ``the farm bill,'' which is less than 2 percent of Federal spending and affects every small town in Michigan, every farmer, as well as all of our food assistance programs. And in the last go- around, we were very proud on a bipartisan basis to be the only Committee to actually cut spending in our own jurisdiction of $23 billion. And we are now coming into another time where we fully expect to work together on a bipartisan basis to invest in rural economy, small towns, agriculture, food programs, and so on. We are in a better position in the sense that food program spending has actually gone down because of the economy getting better. But do you intend to propose reductions to farm bill investments in rural America in your budget, despite the fact that farmers and families already contributed significant savings towards deficit reduction? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, I know that the farm bill is absolutely critical to you, as it is to many other members, including Mr. Grassley, and he and I spoke about this. I apologize. It has been several years now, I think, since the House has taken it up, so I am not in a position to give you an intelligent answer to the question, but would look forward to talking to members of all parties about how to both maintain and to improve and make more efficient the farm bill. Senator Stabenow. Thank you. Chairman Enzi. Senator Toomey. Senator Toomey. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. And, Congressman Mulvaney, welcome. Thanks for being here. Thank you for your willingness to serve, and thanks for the great work you have done in the House of Representatives. Let me follow up on a couple of the subject matters that have been raised. First of all, is it your understanding that historically the reason that we have had a cap on the wages subject to the Social Security tax is because we also have a cap on the benefits that are paid out to somebody? Is that your understanding? Mr. Mulvaney. It is my understanding, yes, Senator. Senator Toomey. And that remains the case? Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. Senator Toomey. And, in addition, if we eliminated the cap, we would not solve the problem. Mr. Mulvaney. Correct. Senator Toomey. Right. Getting back to the bigger budget picture, it is my understanding that today the revenue the Federal Government takes in as a percentage of GDP is greater than its post-war historical average. Is that your understanding? Mr. Mulvaney. Correct. I think it will be about 18.5, 19 percent this year. Senator Toomey. And an average of like 17.9. So we are taking in more revenue than we historically have done. Discretionary spending has been declining as a percentage of GDP--in fact, even in some recent years, in absolute terms. Is that your understanding? Mr. Mulvaney. That is correct. Senator Toomey. So revenue is higher than it has historically been. Discretionary spending is lower than it has historically been. And yet we have got large deficits, and the projection is that they will get worse. Isn't it pretty unavoidable to look at the entitlement programs and acknowledge that this is the problem? Mr. Mulvaney. It is the problem, and I think Congress has done a pretty good job over the course of the last couple of years to deal with the discretionary part of the budget. Senator Toomey. So one of my colleagues suggested that people on Social Security should be concerned about the things you have said. So if you are a Pennsylvanian who is in his or her, I do not know, early 70s and has a modest income and depends on Social Security, are you advocating cuts to their benefits? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. Senator Toomey. You are not advocating cuts to their---- Mr. Mulvaney. No. Senator Toomey. What about somebody who is 69 and receiving Social Security? Are you advocating that their benefits be cut? Mr. Mulvaney. I do not think that any proposal that the House has come up and certainly no proposal that I would take to the President, should I be confirmed, would suggest that we touch folks anywhere who are already--I am not making my parents go back to work. They are 74 years old. That is not what this is about. This is about trying to preserve those programs. Those folks--Senator Stabenow has stepped out. The folks who are 75 years old and relying on Social Security, be it in Pennsylvania or in Michigan, they do not have to worry about---- Senator Toomey. Is there anybody of any age on Social Security where you want to cut their benefits? Mr. Mulvaney. I am sorry, sir? Senator Toomey. Is there anybody of any age on Social Security where you want to cut their benefits that they are receiving now? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. Senator Toomey. You do not want to cut any existing benefits? Mr. Mulvaney. Absolutely not. I would not recommend that to the President. Senator Toomey. So then it is not at all clear to me why someone who is currently on Social Security needs to be afraid of this. How about somebody who is 40 years old and is expected to work for another, I do not know, 25 or 30 years? Can we deliver on the promise that Social Security currently makes to that person? Is there any way that, without change to the structure of the program, we are going to be able to follow through on that commitment? Mr. Mulvaney. Without changing the current Social Security program, a 40-year-old today will receive roughly 77 percent of what they have been promised for their adult life. Senator Toomey. So to continue to suggest that we do not have to do anything here is just being dishonest to the young people, and if I understand correctly, the changes that you would advocate would be for people who have many years left in their working lives to plan accordingly and to prepare for the eventuality. Is that fair? Mr. Mulvaney. Correct. It would require--I think one of the proposals would require me to work an extra couple of months before I retire. It would require my children to work until they are 70. Senator Toomey. And you are how old? Mr. Mulvaney. I am--I am still 49. Senator Toomey. I think it is public information. Mr. Mulvaney. I am 49. Senator Toomey. Okay. Let me switch real quickly to the regulatory side. When I have met with small business owners and other people who are working across Pennsylvania, they have been stunned by the avalanche of new regulations and the cumulative weight of all of these regulations, whether it is Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and EPA, the entire alphabet soup of agencies. In my view--and I have heard this from them--it is having a devastating effect on economic growth. The OMB Director is responsible for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and in that capacity you have a lot of say about new regulations. So, number one, do you support the REINS Act, which would hold that any major new regulation has to be approved by Congress before it goes into effect? Mr. Mulvaney. I do, sir, and I have voted for that in the House. Senator Toomey. How do you feel about a regulatory PAYGO system where, before we impose new regulations, we look at outdated, excessive, counterproductive regulations and repeal them before we impose new ones? Mr. Mulvaney. Actually, I think the law currently requires OMB to do a retrospective analysis of regulations, and it has probably been falling short on that. So I would approve of such a system and think it is actually already the law. Senator Toomey. And just lastly, how high a priority do you think the administration should assign to rolling back the current level of regulation? And do you have any other procedures or analyses that you would intend to use to achieve that? Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Senator. My very distinct impression from working with the transition team is that regulatory reform is going to be an absolute priority for this President. In fact, I think you saw him mention yesterday that he wants to cut 75 percent of the regulations. He is absolutely dead serious about this. I believe he is the first person to campaign for President on regulatory reform since Ronald Reagan. I have some plans or ideas of how OMB could help to do that, but I absolutely believe that you will see this be a priority for President Trump. Senator Toomey. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Enzi. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse. Let me lead with an observation, Mr. Chairman, and that is that in the time that I have been in the Senate, I do not think I have actually ever seen a sincere effort at regulatory reform or relief. What I have seen is a really good game of talk about regulatory reform. But every time it rears its ugly head, it is for one of two special interests: Wall Street or polluters. Period. And sure enough, the two examples that the Senator from Pennsylvania just used were--guess what?--Dodd-Frank on Wall Street and the EPA on polluters. I would suggest to you that on our side of the aisle, there may be a much broader appetite for regulatory reform if it were not simply a device, a curtain to put over helping Wall Street and big polluters, and I urge you to explore that. Second, you indicated in response to the question regarding lifting the Social Security contribution cap so that really, really high earners are not capped from contributing to Social Security, the question was if we raised the cap, we would not solve the problem, and you answered a simple yes. But isn't it true that that would sure contribute significantly to solving the problem? It is one of the levers that should be on the table? Mr. Mulvaney. Sure. As I mentioned, Senator--and, again, I think when we talked--you could raise the retirement age to 100, and that would solve the problems in Social Security. You can pull every lever a long way and fix it. I guess you could take the tax rate to 75 percent. I do not know what the number would be. Senator Whitehouse. I just want to make sure you do not dismiss that particular lever simply because it affects high- income people. Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir. Again, my intention is to lay exactly what you and I have discussed--and I have discussed this--out for the President and say, ``Mr. President, if you want to look at Social Security, here are your five levers. Where would you like us to focus?'' Senator Whitehouse. One of the issues that we focus on in this Committee is the question of how you balance the budget. And what we have here is different levels of expenditure for different kind of things. Over on the far right is $560 billion in 2016 for non-defense discretionary, the entire non-defense appropriated budget; $607 billion for defense discretionary, our entire military operation; $910 billion out the door in Social Security, not counting what comes in; and $1.1 trillion in all the Federal health care programs together--Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, the works. What is here is tax expenditures, and we have had your former Speaker say that tax expenditures are just another way of spending money for people. We have had Ronald Reagan's Budget adviser say if you want to get after the budget problem, you have got to get after tax expenditures; it is just another way of spending money. It is a particularly tricky way of spending money, though, because it tends to help people who pay big taxes so that they can get big benefits through the tax code, corporations, billionaires, and so forth. And it tends to be baked into the tax code. So unlike an appropriation you have got to fight for year after year and it gets reviewed by the Appropriations Committee year after year, there it is, there it sits, there it stays. [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The problem that I have with some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is they talk a really big game about the debt and the deficit. But when it comes to the biggest expenditure, the tax expenditures, we cannot get them to budge on anything--not the carried interest exception that lets billionaires pay lower tax rates than their chauffeurs, than brick masons, than truck drivers. That is just, I think, an outrage from simple fairness. Cannot get it touched. Fossil fuel companies make more money than any other companies on the face of the planet. They get big subsidies from the taxpayer. Makes no sense. Private jet owners can depreciate their jets faster than the airlines that fly regular people around. Makes no sense. We cannot get one piece of that through the other side of the aisle. They will go to the mat to defend every special interest, in my experience. We have never been able to do it. So if you want to put something together on this, I would urge that this administration, which says it is different from everything else before and is not just purely allied to Republican special interests, really take a hard look at these tax expenditures. More money goes out the back door of the tax code than goes out through any of these individual programs. A one-word answer. Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir, it may be that you and the President get to the same place through a different avenue, but you may have just made a very effective case for why we need tax reform in this country. That being said, if I can borrow your graph, that would be great. Senator Whitehouse. You got it. Mr. Mulvaney. Thanks. Chairman Enzi. Senator Corker. Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Mulvaney, thank you for being here. You told me in the office that being OMB Director was your dream job, I think that's slightly odd, but I thank you for your---- [Laughter.] Senator Corker [continuing]. Desire to want to do this. I was looking at the forecasts that were laid out today. We are $20.355 trillion in debt, and over the next 10 years, we are going to add $9.7 trillion. And in spite of some of the comments, I think there is actually a large group of people here that realize the immorality of that. People speak a great deal about jerking the rug out from under seniors. I do not think anybody has ever proposed anything like that. But we all, I think, are disgusted at ourselves with the immorality of living in comfort here today in the United States Senate and Congress and not dealing with these issues which we know will be hugely problematic. Do you believe that this is one of the greatest threats to our Nation today? Mr. Mulvaney. I do, and that really sank in for me, Senator, my very first week here. When I arrived in 2011, I was fortunate enough to get on the Budget Committee over in the House, and we had a presentation, and one of the--I cannot remember if he was there or if someone was talking about his presentation, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, had recently made a comment that he thought that the national debt was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States. And as a new Member of Congress, that put the fear of God in me in a hurry. Senator Corker. Only 31 percent of our expenditures are discretionary spending. I find actually what you said earlier about the five levers--I certainly would not want to focus on any of my friends on the other side of the aisle, but my guess is there are numbers of them that would be willing to look at all five of those levers to solve problems. And so I actually find your views today to be very much in the mainstream, that these are the kinds of things that we all know we need to deal with, knowing we face two workers down the road for every one person retired. I think most of us fear that we are not going to deal with this issue until we are in crisis mode. My question is: Mr. Trump did say some things during the campaign that I wish he had not said. They are totally unrealistic, make no sense whatsoever. And I just wonder, is it your sense when you talk with him about the five levers and when you talk with him about the fact that it is impossible for us to balance the budget with 31 percent of our spending being discretionary without dealing with these other programs, do you think he understands that? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, I think Senator Graham made this comment during his opening statement, which is that--and as I mentioned, I have not been quiet and shy since I have been here. It is fairly easy to find quotations from me and so forth. I have to imagine that the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role, so I look forward-- -- Senator Corker. So you think he understands that we have to deal with all of these issues to solve---- Mr. Mulvaney. I would like to think it is why he hired me-- or wanted to hire me. Senator Corker. Let me ask you this: All of us love and greatly respect the men and women in uniform, people like Tim Kaine's son and the two people who introduced you. When people serve in our military, we just have the utmost respect and admiration. But do you think OCO funding is an intelligent way of building a budget using overseas contingency operations ad infinitum, year after year, as a way of solving our budget problems? Mr. Mulvaney. No, sir, I do not. In fact, I think it is beyond not being intelligent. I think it is---- Senator Corker. It is dishonest, isn't it? Mr. Mulvaney. That is the word I was going to use. Senator Corker. Okay. Let me ask you this, and in spite of the fact that we love our men and women in uniform who serve on our behalf, do you think the Pentagon is well run? Mr. Mulvaney. I do. I think it does a tremendous job of defending the Nation. Senator Corker. In acquisitions programs, do you think it is a well-run organization? Mr. Mulvaney. I look forward to doing more investigation and possibly reforming there when possible. Senator Corker. What bothers me is we, in the name of patriotism, get to the end of a budget, and just about the time we are pressing the Pentagon to do some things that it should do, we let the pressure off with OCO. And to me, it is irresponsible, and I hope you are going to correct that. I know that my time is almost up. You and I talked about Freddie and Fannie, the two organizations that have to do with housing reform. It is your belief, as I understand it, that anything related to reforming our housing finance system and to the conservatorship that Fannie and Freddie, should be legislated by Congress and not done by the executive branch through the flick of a pen. Is that correct? Mr. Mulvaney. I think the law needs to be changed, yes, sir. Senator Corker. Thank you so much. Chairman Enzi. Senator Warner. Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I have a series of areas I want to go into, Mr. Mulvaney. I enjoyed our conversation, but I first want to follow up on Senator Corker's last comment. As someone on this issue of Fannie and Freddie, I was gravely concerned about legislation that you introduced that allowed basically a recap and release. Mr. Mnuchin last week in his hearing also agreed that we needed to do this through legislation. That recap and release that would, frankly, greatly have enhanced the financial position of a lot of the hedge funds who bought in at very cheap rates would not--if they recap and release, would leave a system in place that would allow private sector gain when things are going well and the taxpayer holding the bag when things happened as they did in 2008; we had to put up $188 billion. My hope would be you would work with Congress on reform and not simply advocate to the President the recap-and-release approach. Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Senator. I think that various members of both the House and Senate have different ideas on Fannie and Freddie. I am heartened by the fact that I think we are all trying to get to the same end, which is to protect the taxpayer, to make sure what happened before does not happen again. Senator Warner. Again, this is not the time--we do not have enough time to go through it, but I believe that the legislation you had introduced would not address that. I have got a couple other areas I want to get cleared up with you. Again, last week, with Mr. Mnuchin, one of the things I did like about what he said was, you know, the United States is the reserve currency; the United States debt obligations are absolutely sacrosanct. We should never jeopardize the full faith and credit of the United States. Mr. Mnuchin said that the U.S. Government should absolutely not have the ability to prioritize our payments and there should be no uncertainty when it comes to paying our bills, although in the House you voted for prioritization, which in effect would say we are going to repay bond holders at a higher level than perhaps payments to States or payments to FBI or CIA employees. I think that would dramatically undermine the full faith and credit, and I think most experts have said that prioritization scheme would be a disaster. Do you still share that view that prioritization of our debts is a reasonable approach? And would that not jeopardize the full faith and credit of the United States? Mr. Mulvaney. Well, I think it is undesirable to get to a situation, Senator, where this is a relevant conversation. But if we are simply talking about the principles involved, I do believe that the GAO letter from 1985 is still--it is not law, but it is good guidance. Senator Warner. I sincerely disagree with you, and we will again have a chance perhaps to continue this. Mr. Mulvaney. Sure. Senator Warner. Also, I appreciate your comments about Social Security. I would take exception to what the Senator from Pennsylvania said. It is true that Federal revenues are slightly above the 50-year average. I would point out, over that 50-year average, we have run deficits every year that we have run at that average. And as a matter of fact, the United States, when you consider Federal, State, and local taxes combined, is actually 31st out of 34 OECD nations in terms of total revenues. Now, we can argue--I do not want us to go to those European areas, but you have also signed the Grover Norquist no-tax pledge. If you are going to be willing to take a look at revenues on Social Security or revenues in terms of tax reform, are you going to be able to remain faithful to that taxpayer protection pledge? Don't you think having all things on the table would be a more appropriate role if you were accepted as OMB Director? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, very briefly, because I know your time is limited, and we can go into it longer if you would like to. But the pledge I think applies to candidates for office, which I am giving up, if you all see fit to confirm me. So I will not be bound by that. What I would be bound to is telling the President the truth and telling him what I believe his options to be. Senator Warner. Well, I hope that would mean, as you have said here today, that that would look at both sides of the balance sheet, and clearly, as you list the various levers in Social Security, one of those would be looking at additional revenues. When we met, I am concerned about the administration's current position on Federal workers. Many of these Federal workers serve their country, and they do jobs with enormous passion and pride. They view it as a calling. I know the President-elect--or the President has put in place a Federal employee hiring freeze. He says that was to address the dramatic expansion of the Federal workforce in recent years. But, Mr. Mulvaney, are you aware that the size of the Federal civilian workforce relative to the country's population has actually declined dramatically over the last number of decades and that it is actually smaller now than it was under President Reagan? Mr. Mulvaney. I was not aware of that piece of data. Senator Warner. I would hope you would relay that. Are you aware that, according to the GAO, nearly one-third of the Federal workforce is eligible for retirement between now and 2019? Mr. Mulvaney. I was not aware of that, but that does not surprise me. Senator Warner. Do you agree that if we are going to recruit and retain the best workers--and they are going to have to do a job that continues there are going to be challenges as we all look at ways that we can get our budget into balance. How are we going to do that when we have got disparity between public and private sector payment, when we send these kind of messages about the value of Federal workers on a going-forward basis? How will you reinforce that value statement to a workforce that right now is very concerned? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, as I think you and I discussed, I think the Federal Government probably could do better in dealing with employees who are exemplary and better with dealing with employees who fall below our expectations. And all I can say to you is I look forward to figuring out a way to solve both ends of that problem. Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Enzi. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Congressman, I am new here, which means I have lived in America longer than I have lived in Washington, and I want to share a perspective. A lot of Americans are very frustrated about what goes on here. Not all of them, but many of them. They believe that our country was founded by geniuses but it is being run by idiots. They look around, and they see incredible things happening in our country. Our people can unravel the human genome. They can take a diseased human heart and replace it with a new one and make it beat. They can send a person to the moon. But their representatives cannot balance a budget like they have to do at home or in their small business. Now, here is what I would like to know. I do not have enough time for you to give me an elaborate answer, but if you could give me the high points. If you were king for a day, how would you balance our budget? Mr. Mulvaney. That is a very tempting question, Senator, to ask any elected official, and I am trying to remind myself that my goal--my role at OMB is to advise the President. So maybe-- -- Senator Kennedy. I understand, but I am asking you. Mr. Mulvaney. What would we do? We would grow the economy first, Senator. In fact, that is probably the only way that we ever balance the budget, truly, given the political situation that exists in Washington, D.C. There are folks amongst us who would want to take a bigger slice of the existing pie. I do not think that is a formula for healthy economic growth or success, and certainly not---- Senator Kennedy. Okay. Grow the economy is one. What else? Mr. Mulvaney. Well, if you grow the economy, if you end up with 10 years of 3- or 4-percent growth, you are talking about doubling the size of the economy, which doubles the size of Federal receipts, which allows you to balance the budget. In fact, I believe it was Mr. Warner or maybe Mr. Whitehouse who correctly pointed out that one of the times that we have been able to balance the budget was when the economy was growing so rapidly. Senator Kennedy. I do not mean to interrupt you, but I have only got 5 minutes. Anything else? Mr. Mulvaney. I would like to figure out a way to end waste in Government. If you even assume it is 10 percent within the discretionary budget, that is almost $100 billion this year. Senator Kennedy. Okay. Let me ask you about waste. Mr. Mulvaney. Yes, sir. Senator Kennedy. In 2012, Dr. Donald Berwick, a very accomplished physician, Harvard trained, he ran CMS for President Obama. He testified before Congress that 10 percent of our Medicaid spending is fraud. Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. Senator Kennedy. Not just fraud by patients. Fraud by providers. In some States, they get $2 of Federal money for $1 of State money. So for some, not all, there is not an incentive to combat fraud. Is there any way you can use the power at OMB to incent States to try to combat Medicaid fraud? Mr. Mulvaney. Sir, I do not know off the top of my head. I would be happy to take a look at that. And, again, I think I will get specific instructions from the President to explore doing exactly that, because I think if you say one thing about this President, it is that he will not tolerate the type of waste and fraud that you have mentioned. Senator Kennedy. Okay. I hear from a lot of Louisianians and other Americans, not all but many. They believe that--and I want to ask you if you agree with this. They believe that part of the problem in American society today and with our economy and with our culture is that we have too many undeserving--I want to emphasize ``undeserving,'' because I do not want to paint with too broad a brush. We have too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts, as Sheldon pointed out, and we have too many undeserving, not all but too many undeserving people at the bottom getting handouts. And the people in the middle get stuck with the bill, and they cannot pay it anymore, because their health insurance has gone up and their taxes have gone up and their kids' tuition has gone up. Do you agree with that? Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, I think those folks would be heartened by what they saw out of the President on Saturday, because I believe that was the theme of the inaugural speech that he gave, that those folks who have been forgotten for so long will not be forgotten anymore, and that he will listen to them. And if I get the opportunity to work at OMB, I will do whatever I can to help him do just that. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Congressman. I think you will do a great job at OMB. Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Senator. Welcome here. Chairman Enzi. Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Congressman. Great meeting in my office. In announcing as a candidate in October that he would do a Federal hiring freeze, Candidate Trump said that it was necessary to reduce ``corruption and special interest collusion.'' If you know, why is the administration pitching the false view that Federal workers are corrupt or beholden to special interests? Mr. Mulvaney. I am not familiar with the statement, Senator Kaine, so I am not really comfortable commenting on it. Senator Kaine. Okay. A freeze has a lot of effects. The most direct effect would be on people seeking to work with the Trump administration. Why would there be an assumption that people coming to work with the Trump administration would come with corruption or special interest collusion problems? Mr. Mulvaney. Again, I do not think there is an assumption hard-wired in to any system that the Federal workers are corrupt. I think you and I both know as---- Senator Kaine. I am happy to hear you do not share what the President stated was the reason for this. Let me ask you this-- -- Mr. Mulvaney. There are--yes, sir. Senator Kaine. You had legislation on hiring freezes that said if three people left by attrition or got other jobs, you could hire one in. My understanding of the hiring freeze that was announced yesterday, it is even more strict than that. Isn't that your understanding, no new hires? Mr. Mulvaney. I am not familiar with the details of what they laid out yesterday. I am happy to talk about my own bill, if you like. Senator Kaine. Many applicants for Federal employment are veterans because of a significant veteran's preference. It seems like a bad idea to me to do a freeze that would have the effect of putting roadblocks up to veterans seeking Federal employment. Do you worry, like I do, about backlogs in processing of Social Security disability claims, veterans' benefit claims, backlogs in getting drugs permitted, potentially lifesaving drugs permitted to go on the market? Mr. Mulvaney. I worry about inefficiencies at many levels of Government. Senator Kaine. And I am concerned that hiring freezes in some of these areas where we are already seeing backlogs could have the effect of even making it harder for citizens to get the service they need. Am I wrong to be concerned about that? Mr. Mulvaney. I do not think you are wrong to be concerned about it, Senator. I do not think it automatically follows that hiring more people will create more efficiency. Senator Kaine. Have you read the GAO studies of blanket hiring freezes under earlier administrations, Democratic and Republican, that suggest that they are ineffective, that they hurt service to citizens and they may cost more money than they save? Mr. Mulvaney. I have not seen those, sir. Senator Kaine. Do you know whether the administration reviewed those before announcing the hiring freeze? Mr. Mulvaney. I do not know. Senator Kaine. The House resurrected the Holman rule, allowing Congress the power to slash individual Federal workers' salaries as low as $1 per year. Did you vote for that? Mr. Mulvaney. I believe I did, yes, sir. Senator Kaine. There have been reports about the incoming administration---- Mr. Mulvaney. Excuse me. I am sorry. Senator, let me correct that. I believe that may have been contained in our rules package this year, and if that is the case, then I did not vote on it. I apologize. Senator Kaine. Okay. We will check the record. Thanks for that clarification. Did you support it? Mr. Mulvaney. As you and I have discussed, I do support some application of the Holman rule in some circumstances. Senator Kaine. Okay. There have been reports that the incoming administration has been trying to gather intelligence about whether employees worked on priorities that they do not like, for example, Department of Energy employees that worked on climate activities. Were you aware of those reports? Mr. Mulvaney. I am not; no, sir. Senator Kaine. So you were not aware that they have been widely perceived as sort of being intimidating of employees that worked on priorities that the President does not share? Mr. Mulvaney. Again, I am not familiar with them. Senator Kaine. Do you want a high-morale, high performance Federal workforce or a low-morale, low performance Federal workforce? Mr. Mulvaney. High morale, high performance. Senator Kaine. How is calling Federal employees ``corrupt'' and ``beholden to special interests,'' freezing any new hiring into Federal employment, gathering information about employees who have worked on priorities that the new President does not share, and supporting a role that could target individual employees for massive salary reductions likely to build a high- morale, high-performance organization? Mr. Mulvaney. I think that rhetoric taps into a concern, shared by many, including yourself, that there are Federal workers who do not live up to our expectations, and it is hard---- Senator Kaine. But we should not paint them with a broad brush, should we, Congressman? Mr. Mulvaney. Anytime you paint with a broad brush, Senator, you run the risk of going outside the lines. Senator Kaine. In your prepared testimony, you state, ``I have learned that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the cogent arguments of others--matter. I will be loyal to the facts and to the American people . . . I serve.'' Let me ask you some questions about facts. Mr. Mulvaney. Sure. Senator Kaine. Agree or disagree. A full repeal of the ACA with no replacement will cause many people to lose health insurance. Agree or---- Mr. Mulvaney. With no replacement, that is a true statement. Senator Kaine. A full repeal of the ACA with no replacement will be a massive tax break for wealthy Americans because of two high-earner taxes in the law. Agree or disagree? Mr. Mulvaney. Again, I have seen these lists, Senator, but I do not think anybody is proposing that we repeal without replacing. So the answer to your question is yes. Senator Kaine. A full repeal of the ACA with no replacement will increase the deficit. Agree or disagree? Mr. Mulvaney. Again, if you assume that there is no replacement, I think that--no, actually, I think the CBO report says that a full repeal with no replacement actually decreases the deficit. Senator Kaine. No. The CBO says it increases the deficit by $137 billion a year in 10 years if you assume dynamic scoring, $350 billion a year if you do not, over 10 years. Mr. Mulvaney. I saw the report that I think Mr. Enzi asked for in 2015 that gave a different conclusion, but I would be happy to look at the one you---- Senator Kaine. All right. Thank you. A full repeal of the ACA with no replacement would once again allow insurance companies to discriminate against women and those with preexisting health conditions. Mr. Mulvaney. Again, I have not seen reports on that, but-- -- Senator Kaine. With no replacement. Mr. Mulvaney. But no one is proposing no replacement. Senator Kaine. A full repeal of the ACA with no replacement would raise prescription drug costs for seniors under Medicare Part D because of reopening the donut hole. Mr. Mulvaney. I am not sure about that one. Senator Kaine. Okay. Climate change, driven partly by human-generated CO2 emissions, is a huge risk. Agree or disagree? Mr. Mulvaney. Again, you and I have talked about this. I have talked about this with Mr. Sanders. I am not really sure of the nexus between the OMB operation---- Senator Kaine. I am not asking about OMB. I am off OMB now. Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. Senator Kaine. Just a statement of fact, agree or disagree. You are going to follow the facts. Climate change, driven partly by human-generated CO2 emissions, is a huge risk. Agree or disagree? Mr. Mulvaney. I am not convinced we are at the point where we have to--start to require American citizens to pay high prices---- Senator Kaine. I am just asking do you agree with the fact. Is climate change, driven by human-generated CO2 emissions, a huge risk? Mr. Mulvaney. Yeah, I challenge the premise of your fact. Senator Kaine. You do not agree with--and, finally, the Federal workforce is at its lowest as a percentage of the total workforce in 70 years. Agree or disagree? Mr. Mulvaney. Mr. Warner mentioned that, and I have no reason to believe he was not telling me the truth. Senator Kaine. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Enzi. Senator Johnson. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congressman Mulvaney, Mrs. Mulvaney, I really want to thank both you and your family for your willingness to serve. I know Senator Corker used the word ``odd.'' I think when we met, I said ``crazy.'' Mr. Mulvaney. I have been called worse. Senator Johnson. I hope you are enjoying this. As an accountant, as a business person, what drives me nuts in the Federal Government is lack of information, cherrypicking of information. I think we have seen some of that already today. I would say, as Chairman of Homeland Security, I am often asked: What is the greatest threat facing this country right now? And it is not climate change. I have been answering, and sometimes I am usually saying the denial of reality. We simply are not facing up to these enormous problems. I want to talk to you a little bit about real information, what is really going to drive this, but I want to go back to Senator Kennedy talking from my standpoint, the number one component of the solution, which is growth. And let us talk about actual information in terms of how effective that would be. If we go from 2 to 3 percent, that is another $14 trillion added to our economy over 10 years; 2 to 4 percent is $29 trillion. Even with the meager economic growth we have had since 2009, revenues flowing into the Federal Government have increased by $1.1 trillion. So, clearly, focusing on economic growth is the number one component to the solution. For me, there are four elements, and I want to talk about two because it is going to completely fall in your bailiwick as OMB Director. The first one, though, is energy, and it looks like this administration is dedicated to utilizing our energy resource, which is a good thing. We have to reform our tax code. It is a disaster, costs somewhere $200 to $300 billion to comply with, which is part of that regulatory burden, which is in your bailiwick. We have numerous studies saying it is coming close to $2 trillion per year to comply with Federal regulations. You have debt per household, $260,000 per household. The regulatory burden is $14,800 per household. That is an enormous burden. Then we can talk about debt, but let us focus a little bit just on providing information so we can actually start managing the Federal Government properly. Social Security--no, let us talk about debt, deficit. Over the next 30 years, the deficit, according to CBO, will accumulate $103 trillion. That is tacked onto our $20 trillion. Now, that is clearly unsustainable. We were talking about Social Security earlier. Of that $103 trillion, $14 trillion is in Social Security, $34 trillion is in Medicare, over $50 trillion is in interest on the debt. So if we do not want to pay creditors over the next 30 years, $50 trillion interest on the debt, we have to address Social Security and Medicare. And, again, I want to talk a little--again, we use the demagoguery. We can talk about, you know, hey, just raise the retirement age. According to the Social Security trustees, increasing the retirement age from 67 to 70, over 4 years, fills $1 trillion of that $14 trillion deficit of Social Security. So, again, I agree with you. You have got multiple levers. You are going to have to pull all of them. Just talk to me about your dedication as OMB Director to provide Congress and, even more importantly, the American people with real information on a macro basis so we can actually address these problems. Mr. Mulvaney. Senator, you left off one, at the risk of trying to correct a Senator in the middle of a Senate hearing. Senator Johnson. Be my guest. Mr. Mulvaney. And we have not talked about it today. There is a CBO report out--and I cannot remember if it is 2054 or 2044--where under the current baseline, the assumptions that things stay the way that we are, 100 percent--by the mid-2050s, 100 percent of what we take in goes to one item and one item only, and that is interest payments on the debt. No money for Social Security, none for Medicare, none for Medicaid, none for national defense, none for any of the things we have talked about here today. That frightens me. I do not want to be alarmist, but the point of the matter is we have allowed things to get in a bad situation, and now it will fall to us to make some very difficult decisions. What do I see as my job? And why do I think I might be good at it? I see my job as giving some really, really hard facts to some really, really important people under very difficult circumstances. I think I have the ability to do that. It is not easy to go into a retirement community and tell people, ``Look, we have to talk about ways to fix Social Security.'' I think that probably pales in comparison to walking into the Oval Office and saying, ``Now, Mr. President, here is where we stand on Social Security, here is where we stand on Medicare, here is where we stand on all of the other items.'' That is not easy to do. So maybe you are right and I am crazy to want to have this job, but somebody has to do it, because we cannot get to a point 20 years from now where people throw their hands up and say, ``Well, I did not know this was going to happen.'' We know it is going to happen, and the time to start trying to fix it is now. Senator Johnson. So my only question is: Are you dedicated to providing us the information, the facts, so we can start ending the denial of reality and start addressing these enormous challenges? Because this is clearly unsustainable. Mr. Mulvaney. It is one of the few things that would allow me to leave my family for the next several years, as long as the President would have me, so that I could do just that. I could look at my kids 20 years from now and say the time that I was away from you, from age 11 to age whatever, was worth it because I was able to do exactly what you just said. Senator Johnson. Thank you for your willingness to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Senator. Chairman Enzi. Senator Van Hollen. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Mulvaney, great to see you. It was good to serve with you in the House and on the Budget Committee, and I have told my colleagues who asked that you were a straight shooter and that you had a consistent set of views--I would argue in many cases consistently wrong, but, clearly, you have held to your positions and you have been straight in your communications with members in this Committee. One area where I think you have got it exactly right--and I think this came out in the questioning by Senator Corker--was with respect to the fact that Congress has tried to use the overseas contingency account, the war savings account, as a slush fund in order to escape the budget agreement. Do you still hold the view that that is a runaround on the budget agreement, and that if we are going to address those issues, we should address them in a straightforward manner rather than what was referred to by Senator Corker, I think, as a dishonest manner? Mr. Mulvaney. And I think this has become fairly an orthodox position in both parties, is that everyone admits now that the overseas contingency operations budget, the war budget, is used for that specific purpose. In fact, I think it was part of the omnibus agreement last year to use OCO for items that were not war related. Senator Van Hollen. And do you agree that that is a wrong-- that is an abuse of the budget process? Mr. Mulvaney. I do. It is not emergency spending. It puts us in a situation--imagine, Mr. Van Hollen, if the budget was balanced---- Senator Van Hollen. I have limited time. Mr. Mulvaney. Yes. The answer is yes. Senator Van Hollen. You agree it is an abuse of the process, and as OMB Director, if you are confirmed, you will not pursue---- Mr. Mulvaney. I will look forward to having an opportunity to explain to the President why I think it is not a good way to spend American taxpayer dollars. Senator Van Hollen. Okay. My concern relates largely to some of the judgments you have made on issues, and some of them were raised earlier by Senator Warner and others. One incident was around the whole issue of the debt ceiling, because we were introduced over the weekend to the phrase, the expression ``"
