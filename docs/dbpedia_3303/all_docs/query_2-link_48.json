        "text": "University of California Report Examines How “Revoking China’s Preferred Trade Status Would Be Costly for California Agriculture”\n\nThe Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics, University of California released a recent report that analyzes how revoking China's Preferred Trade Status could impact agriculture.\n\n\"Revoking [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] PNTR would likely provoke trade retaliation by China, potentially raising China’s agricultural import tariffs by 9.5%, equivalent to the change in U.S. tariffs if China’s PNTR status was revoked,\" Professors Colin A. Carter and Sandro Steinbach write. \"This could result in the value of California’s agricultural exports to China falling by one-third, with associated trade losses of $1 billion annually.\"\n\nThe report identifies tree nuts as a sector that would be greatly impacted by this decision. Read the full report here.\n\nTriState ArkLaMiss Pecan Convention Invites Exhibitors\n\nThe Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi Growers Associations unite to host the annual TriState ArkLaMiss Pecan Convention.

The GSP Reform Act, introduced by Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), would reauthorize the GSP program until December 31, 2030. The legislation permanently bans China from the list of eligible countries and sets new country eligibility for participation to ensure fair treatment for U.S. agricultural exports, fair digital and tax treatment of U.S. companies and workers, democracy, good governance, and anti-corruption standards, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “GSP is the largest and oldest U.S. trade preference program that provides nonreciprocal, duty-free treatment enabling many of the world’s developing countries to spur diversity and economic growth through trade.” Economic development is promoted by eliminating duties on thousands of products when imported from designated beneficiary countries and territories. In addition to the new country eligibility requirements, this legislation creates the first agriculture-specific eligibility criteria for participating countries. This is intended to create additional leverage to open markets for American farmers. The legislation would allow removal of countries for placing non-science-based barriers on U.S. ag products or who provide unfair subsidies. Reforms would also utilize GSP to ensure fair digital trade and tax treatment for U.S. companies and workers, allowing for the removal of countries that impose discriminatory measures against the U.S. Larry Don Womack, National Pecan Federation Chairman, stated: “In our continued efforts to build and open markets for the American pecan industry in India, the reauthorization of the GSP will be an important tool. The National Pecan Federation appreciates the work of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee to pass this legislation reauthorizing GSP and supporting American agriculture.” This legislation will now await consideration by the full U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nOPGA Hosts 2024 Conference\n\nThe Oklahoma Pecan Growers Association prepares to host its Annual Convention and Trade Show on May 30 to June 1, 2024, at the Ardmore Convention Center in Ardmore.

Tuberville Urges Biden Admin to Help Farmers Impacted by Natural Disasters\n\nWASHINGTON—This week, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) joined colleagues in sending two letters opposing the slow rollout of the Biden Administration’s Emergency Relief Program (ERP 2022), which implemented payment limits that may harm producers who have undergone significant losses. Yesterday, Sen. Tuberville joined Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) and colleagues in sending a bicameral letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack expressing their concerns about USDA’s methodology and implementation of ERP. Additionally, Sen. Tuberville joined Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) in sending a letter to Comptroller General Dodaro requesting a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of USDA’s ERP 2022 program. According to the senators, the USDA’s ERP 2022 requirements are misguided and lose sight of the program's intent outlined by Congress when it was created and over $3.7 billion allocated. The program’s purpose is to assist producers impacted by qualifying natural disasters in 2022 similarly to the first round of ERP and the previous Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+). However, USDA has established requirements that have proved inadequate in helping farmers recover from natural disasters. By the USDA attaching excessive conditions to receive aid, this federal relief program could force farmers to wait even longer for assistance or completely jeopardize their ability to access the program. “American producers have experienced significant losses, and the Administration has taken an approach that does not reflect Congressional intent. The current program does not provide needed assistance to full-time farm families that suffered the deepest losses, and in short, it misallocates limited but badly needed assistance,” the senators said in their letter. “While this program is already unnecessarily delayed, it is still imperative that USDA depart from its current path because of the major problems raised by producers and Congress. USDA needs to follow the law and Congressional intent to address the crop losses of our farm families without the pay limits and without preferences that are not authorized by the statute,” the senators continued. “We strongly request the USDA abandon this current program and implement the framework of 2021 ERP Phase 1 as quickly as possible.” Senators Tuberville and Marshall were joined in the letter to USDA by Senators Deb Fischer, Pete Ricketts, Cindy Hyde-Smith, James Lankford, John Cornyn, Ted Cruz, and many Members of the House of Representatives. Read the full letter to USDA here. Senators Tuberville and Hoeven were joined in the letter to GAO by Senators John Boozman, Roger Marshall, Pete Ricketts, James Lankford, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Steve Daines, Kevin Cramer, and John Thune.\n\nUSDA announces 2022 Census of Agriculture data release details, preliminary return rate, and upcoming special studies\n\nWASHINGTON—The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will release the 2022 Census of Agriculture data on February 13, 2024. NASS concluded the data collection this summer with a preliminary national return rate of 61%. The ag census, conducted once every five years, was mailed to more than 3 million producers across the United States and Puerto Rico late last year. NASS plans to release the data from the 2022 Puerto Rico Census of Agriculture in summer 2024. Early next year, NASS will conduct the Census of Agriculture in the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at USDA, I would like to thank the millions of producers who gave their time and effort to complete the 2022 Census of Agriculture,” said NASS Administrator Hubert Hamer. “Ag census data will inform decisions about policy, farm and conservation programs, rural development, research, technology development, ag education, and more over the next several years. These data will have a very real impact on producers, their farming operations, and communities.”\n\nThe ag census data will be available at nass.usda.gov/AgCensus and in NASS’s searchable database, Quick Stats. Publication dates for the various ag census data products can be found on NASS’s online 2024 Agricultural Statistics Board Calendar. Like all NASS data, ag census data will be available in aggregate form only, ensuring that no individual operation or producer can be identified, as required by federal law.\n\n“NASS staff are currently doing extensive analyses of each response,” said NASS’s Census and Survey Division Director Barbara Rater. “We use trusted statistical methods to account for nonresponse, under-coverage, and misclassification to continue to produce accurate data down to the county level. Per usual, these methodologies will be published in the final report.”\n\nIn addition to the U.S. territory ag census data collection, two ag census special studies that will provide more in-depth information on certain industries will be conducted this fall and winter: the 2023 Census of Aquaculture and the 2023 Irrigation and Water Management Survey. These questionnaires will be mailed to the producers who reported these activities in the 2022 Census of Agriculture. For more information about these upcoming special studies, visit nass.usda.gov/AgCensus.\n\nThe Census of Agriculture provides the only source of impartial and comprehensive agricultural data for every state and county in the nation.

He also enjoyed hunting and fishing, watching the news, and bragging on his family.\n\nHe was a lifetime member of the First Baptist Church of Blackshear and attended the MISFITS Sunday school class.\n\nA pillar of his community, he helped others anytime he could. He will be greatly missed in Pierce County and across the state.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his son, Jerry Tanner; his brother, Wayne Clough; and brother-in-law, Stephen Waters, Jr.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Shirley T.

Ossoff’s Months-Long Push, India Cuts Tariffs on U.S. Pecan Exports by 70% in Major Win for Georgia Farmers\n\nLast year, Georgia pecan farmers asked Sen. Ossoff to take action\n\nSen. Ossoff met seven times during the last year with India’s Ambassador to the United States and personally led a trade mission to India\n\nGeorgia produces about one-third of all American pecans\n\nWashington, D.C. — Today, following Sen. Ossoff’s push, the Republic of India announced a major 70% cut to tariffs on U.S. pecan exports, a big win for Georgia farmers.\n\nAt the request of Georgia farmers, Sen. Ossoff has worked behind the scenes for months with U.S. trade negotiators and Indian government officials to open the Indian market for Georgia pecan growers.\n\n“This is a huge win for Georgia pecan farmers, and it wouldn’t be possible without them,” said Sen. Ossoff. “India’s high pecan tariffs have prevented Georgia pecan exports to this market of more than one billion consumers. Today I can announce that after a year of painstaking diplomacy, the Indian government will cut that tariff by 70%. I thank U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai for her steadfast support, Indian Ambassador Sandhu for his constructive engagement, Senator Warnock for his teamwork, and Georgia’s farmers for their perseverance to secure this victory.”\n\nSen. Ossoff met seven times with India’s Ambassador to the U.S., Taranjit Singh Sandhu, over the last year, and the two agreed to work together to make improvements to the U.S.-India trade relationship.\n\nSen. Ossoff met last year with Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Sarah Bianchi, who agreed at his urging to put reducing India’s high pecan tariffs at the top of the U.S.-India trade agenda.\n\nIn August 2022, Sen. Ossoff personally led an economic delegation to the Republic of India to meet with key business and government leaders and continue urging for a reduction in tariffs.\n\nLast month, Sen. Ossoff brought U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai and the U.S. Chief Agriculture Negotiator Doug McKalip to Georgia to meet with farmers and representatives of the main agricultural industries in the state, where they briefed leaders on efforts to find a reduction in India’s high tariff.\n\nSen.

This unique formulation brings new disease fighting power to growers of soybeans, rice, and pecans.\n\n“We recognized gaps in the performance of existing fungicides in these three crops, which led us to create this specially formulated hybrid product,” said Dr. Eric Tedford, R&D manager for Summit Agro.\n\n“Regev HBX benefits from the combination of tea tree oil, a botanical ingredient, with a conventional fungicide (difenoconazole). This is why we call it a hybrid fungicide,” Dr. Tedford added.\n\nDr. Tedford cited trial data showing the effectiveness of Regev HBX against frogeye leaf spot and Asian soybean rust on soybeans. Since there are reports of widespread resistance to group 11 fungicides, it is recommended to rotate two to three effective classes of fungicides. Regev HBX is listed as FRAC BM 01 (tea tree oil) and FRAC 3 (difenoconazole).\n\nFor rice, similarly successful trials demonstrated the efficacy of Regev HBX against rice blast. Based on the trial data, pecan growers will be impressed by how well Regev HBX performs on pecan scab.\n\nThrough the combination of tea tree oil and difenoconazole, Regev HBX provides eight mechanisms of activity against fungal and bacterial plant pathogens to deliver remarkable disease control with only one MRL. Regev HBX provides significant value to soybean, rice, and pecan growers due to its preventative and curative activity, efficacy against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal diseases, and the ability to enhance plant growth and yield. These attributes make Regev HBX an important component in the disease management and control programs for these crops.\n\nRegev HBX is exclusively available from Helena Agri-Enterprises and Tenkoz member companies.\n\nMore information on Regev HBX including performance data can be found at the Summit Agro website: SUMMITAGRO-USA.COM.\n\nUSDA to provide Approximately $6 Billion to commodity and specialty crop producers impacted by 2020, 2021 natural disasters\n\nWASHINGTON, May 16, 2022 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced that commodity and specialty crop producers impacted by natural disaster events in 2020 and 2021 will soon begin receiving emergency relief payments totaling approximately $6 billion through the Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) new Emergency Relief Program (ERP) to offset crop yield and value losses.\n\n“For over two years, farmers and ranchers across the country have been hard hit by an ongoing pandemic coupled with more frequent and catastrophic natural disasters,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “As the agriculture industry deals with new challenges and stressors, we at USDA look for opportunities to inject financial support back into the rural economy through direct payments to producers who bear the brunt of circumstances beyond their control. These emergency relief payments will help offset the significant crop losses due to major weather events in 2020 and 2021 and help ensure farming operations are viable this crop year, into the next growing season and beyond.”\n\nRead the full press release here.\n\nDubai Set to Welcome the Nut and Dried Fruit Industry for the 39th INC Congress\n\nMay 4, 2022.

Jim Costa (D-Calif.) about whether China is keeping up with its current commitments to buy U.S. agricultural goods, Vilsack replied, “No.”\n\nThe USDA chief said China was $13 billion behind on purchases. “And there are seven key areas where they have yet to perform,” he added, including on biotech approvals and ethanol tariffs.\n\nVilsack also said the USDA and Biden administration is continuing to work with China and Mexico to address ongoing trade disputes over U.S. corn exports and other issues.\n\nHe took the opportunity to tout a recent trade resolution with Canada over dairy products, which he said will benefit U.S. farmers.\n\nWhat’s next: U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is in talks with her Chinese counterpart in an effort to bring China into compliance with the deal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden acknowledged on Wednesday during a press conference that many American businesses want to see tariffs on China eased, but such a step is “uncertain” because China still hasn’t fulfilled all of its commitments.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I could say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of the commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we are not there yet,” he said.\n\nU.S. Senate Finance Committee encourages U.S. Trade Representative to more aggressively enforce USMCA\n\nChairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to USTR Ambassador Tai to encourage more aggressive enforcement of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nIn the letter, Senators Wyden and Crapo write, \"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\" or the \"Agreement\") has the potential to deliver tangible benefits for America's workers, farmers, and businesses by improving and strengthening the relationship between the United States and its two closest trading partners. However, that potential will not be realized without full implementation and enforcement of the Agreement as written.\"\n\nThe letter highlights several outstanding issues where the Senators say U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Tai must \"ensure that the United States gets what it bargained for\" and take action.\n\nRead the full letter from Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo to USTR here.\n\nTexas Pecan Short Course moved to February 2022\n\nTexas A&M AgriLife Extension Service announced last week that it has rescheduled its 2022 Texas Pecan Short Course to Feb. 22-25 in Somerville, Texas.

In a statement released on Aug. 18, the agency stated that it will also revoke all tolerances for chlorpyrifos, \"which establish an amount of a pesticide that is allowed on food.\"\n\nThis decision comes in response to the Ninth Court's order directing EPA to issue a final rule in response to the 2007 petition filed by Pesticide Action Network North America and Natural Resources Defense Council. The petition requested that the EPA revoke all chlorpyrifos tolerances, or the maximum allowed residue levels in food, because those tolerances were not safe, in part due to the potential for neurodevelopmental effects in children.\n\n“Today EPA is taking an overdue step to protect public health. Ending the use of chlorpyrifos on food will help to ensure children, farmworkers, and all people are protected from the potentially dangerous consequences of this pesticide,” EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said in the statement. “After the delays and denials of the prior administration, EPA will follow the science and put health and safety first.”\n\nThis restriction on chlorpyrifos use on food follows similar actions taken by several other countries, including the European Union and Canada, and some states, including California, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, and Oregon.\n\nThe EPA said the agency will continue to review replacements and alternatives to chlorpyrifos.\n\nThe Art of Pecan, Dripping Springs, Texas, Named Top 20 Finalist for the 2021 H-E-B Quest for Texas Best\n\nSAN ANTONIO – More than 800 Texans threw their hats into the ring, submitting more than 1,200 products ready for the 2021 Quest for Texas Best.

The executive order states, \"America’s farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners have an important role to play in combating the climate crisis and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by sequestering carbon in soils, grasses, trees, and other vegetation and sourcing sustainable bioproducts and fuels.\"\n\nThis order directs the Secretary of Agriculture to collect stakeholder input on a climate-smart agriculture and forestry strategy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will then consider this public input when it prepares recommendations to expand climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices and systems.\n\nUSDA specified that it is interested in comments in response to the topics, categories, and questions shown in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of its notice on the U.S. Federal Register. The deadline for comment is April 29, 2021, at 11:59 p.m.\n\nTo participate and provide input to the USDA, please visit the U.S. Federal Register through this link.\n\nPenn State Extension survey focuses on safety and health needs of farmers\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State Extension has developed an online survey to gather input from farm owners and workers on their educational needs regarding safety and health on their farms.\n\nThe survey, which will be online at https://extension. psu.edu/ag-safety-survey throu gh April 30, asks farm managers, operators, staff, and those who work in agriculture about their educational needs relating to youth safety, equipment safety, mental health, farm fires, and related agricultural safety and health topics.\n\nThe Penn State Extension Ag Safety and Health team is looking forward to collecting input from farm operators, managers, owners, and staff.\n\nFAIR Act study examines the APC’s effectiveness\n\nIn a memorandum sent out on March 8, 2021, the executive director of the American Pecan Council shared the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act Study that was conducted on the FMO with American pecan industry members.\n\nEvery five years, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires Federal Marketing Orders (FMOs) to conduct a Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act study to ensure that the industry’s resources are being utilized in an efficient and effective manner. Additionally, this study has to be conducted by a third independent party to ensure that there is no bias in the study. The study was conducted by Texas A&M University and concluded last month. According to the Executive Summary:\n\nThe primary conclusion from the promotion analysis is that, despite its relatively recent launch, the American Pecan Council has effectively enhanced domestic and export demand for U.S. pecans over 2016/17 through 2019/20 through its generic promotion activities and generated a relatively high rate of return to pecan producers who have paid for the promotion over that period. The principal accomplishment of the APC domestic and export promotion program has been to support the annual average producer price of pecans about 24¢/lb (11%) above the level to which it might have fallen over the period of 2016/17 through 2019/20 if the promotion had not been done. Given APC promotion expenditures (including MAP funds but excluding administrative costs), the benefit-cost ratio for the APC promotion program for 2016/17 through 2019/20 is calculated at 9.9, meaning that the promotion returned $9.9 in profit to pecan producers for every dollar spent on promotion.\n\n\"This is great news as the study shows that the federal marketing order is working, in just 4 short years,\" APC Executive Director Alex Ott stated in the memorandum. A copy of the complete report can be found here.\n\nThe APC invites all those with questions to please contact the Council office at (817) 916-0200.\n\nWPGA Webinar Series Begins on March 8th\n\nThe Western Pecan Growers Association (WPGA) hosts its first webinar of a new Quarterly Webinar Series on March 8, 2021.
