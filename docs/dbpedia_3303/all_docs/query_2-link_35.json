        "text": "Farm to Treat: Celebrating Our Farmers During National Candy Month\n\n/\n\nEvery June, we celebrate the official start of summer alongside National Candy Month. Candy – in all its delightful forms – brightens smiles, livens celebrations, and serves as a small pleasure in our daily lives.\n\nThese treats certainly have a way of making our lives more delicious, and we’re thrilled to join in the sweetness by highlighting the important role American sugar producers play in making National Candy Month possible.\n\nSo, let’s celebrate the treats we love and the policies and people who make them possible, too. Our sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers and producers work day-in and day-out to provide the high-quality, made-in-America sugar that is the hallmark of your favorite treat and an essential ingredient in so many other foods.\n\nThis is all made possible by a strong U.S. sugar policy. In fact, a study conducted by economists at the University of Tennessee analyzed the profits and risk of the confectionary industry and found that the high profitability and low volatility of the industry can be attributed, in part, to U.S. sugar policy. That’s because U.S. sugar policy provides a reliable supply of domestically produced sugar and the flexibility to ensure that supply always meets demand. Talk about sweet!\n\nSugarbeet and sugarcane farmers are key to keeping candy manufacturing lines humming, but like many other farmers, they are facing significant headwinds due to persistently high input costs and weather challenges from Mother Nature. To keep the Made-in-America sugar flowing, farmers need a strong, bipartisan five-year Farm Bill that delivers a strengthened safety net for sugar producers.\n\nWhile we savor our favorite treats, let’s also indulge in some facts:\n\nThe sugar industry contributes $23.3 billion to the U.S. economy every single year.\n\nThanks to U.S. sugar policy in the Farm Bill, American farmers and workers supply 70-75% of America’s sugar needs.\n\nU.S. sugar policy ensures that we always have sugar available—every year there are over 3 billion pounds of surplus sugar.\n\nSugar creates more than 151,000 U.S. jobs in more than two dozen states.\n\nAnd all that comes at zero-cost to taxpayers and an affordable cost to consumers.\n\nAmericans prefer made-in-America sugar 8 to 1, so let’s keep our farms here instead of offshoring our production. That way we can keep celebrating National Candy Month year after year.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/National-candy-Month.jpg 528 528 Elizabeth Fusick https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Elizabeth Fusick2024-06-26 12:30:352024-06-26 12:33:01Farm to Treat: Celebrating Our Farmers During National Candy Month\n\nAmerica’s Sugarbeet and Sugarcane Farm Families, Factory Workers Applaud the Strong Farm Safety Net in House Farm Bill\n\n/\n\nOn behalf of America’s sugarbeet and sugarcane farm families and the factory workers from across the country represented by the American Sugar Alliance, Neil Rockstad, a Minnesota sugarbeet grower, fourth-generation farmer and President of the American Sugarbeet Growers Association, and Patrick Frischhertz, a Louisiana sugarcane grower and eighth-generation farmer, issued the following joint statement on the draft text release of the House Agriculture Committee’s Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024:\n\n“As farmers, we’re proud to play a critical role in feeding America, yet high production costs, rising foreign subsidies, predatory trade practices, and often Mother Nature have conspired to make it very difficult for family farms like ours to survive. That’s why we are so grateful that the Farm Bill text released on Friday by Chairman GT Thompson provides a strong new safety net for our farm families. Chairman Thompson and his team worked tirelessly to craft the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024, spending countless hours listening to the concerns of farmers and ranchers, and we commend him for his outstanding leadership.\n\n“We thank the House Agriculture Committee for the strengthened U.S. sugar policy contained in this bill which will help ensure that America’s 11,000 sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers and our workers can continue producing an essential ingredient in our food supply, maintain resilient supply chains, and meet the needs of American families and all of our customers.\n\n“Our farm families need a bipartisan, bicameral, and highly effective Farm Bill. This legislation from Chairman Thompson is the first major step towards the enactment of the 2024 Farm Bill. We stand ready to work with Chairman Thompson and all congressional leaders to make this shared goal a reality this year. This effort, particularly the farm safety net features for sugarbeet and sugarcane farm families in Chairman Thompson’s bill, merits lawmakers’ strong support.”\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CaneBeetAndCapitol7.jpg 1647 2121 Elizabeth Fusick https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Elizabeth Fusick2024-05-20 07:00:442024-05-20 06:35:48America’s Sugarbeet and Sugarcane Farm Families, Factory Workers Applaud the Strong Farm Safety Net in House Farm Bill\n\nFarm Policy Experts Note Rising Costs of Producing Sugarbeets and Sugarcane\n\n/\n\nIn a recent Southern Ag Today article, two well-respected professors looked at the rising costs of production for sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers. Their analysis, which is a timely addition to the upcoming farm bill discussions, is in stark contrast to the non-treatment of this important issue by GAO in a recent report purportedly on the U.S. sugar market.\n\n“Drs. Diliberto and DeLong examined how inflation has increased the cost of planting, cultivating, and harvesting sugarbeets and sugarcane since the last Farm Bill,” said Rob Johansson, Director of Economics & Policy Analysis at the American Sugar Alliance. “Knowing how much those costs have changed is important to know when looking at crafting a new farm bill that addresses the needs of producers today. It is unfortunate that the GAO, when writing their report for Congress over the past two years, considered neither the costs of producing sugar nor the high labor and environmental standards in America compared to other sugar producing countries.”\n\nThe authors found that the costs of growing sugarbeets and sugarcane have “drastically increased” by more than 30% since the last farm bill. The breakeven price to cover sugarcane production in Louisiana was found to be 28.2 cents/pound, far beyond the 17.2 cents/pound from 2018. And the breakeven price for sugarbeet production in Minnesota/North Dakota was found to be roughly $52 per ton of sugarbeets up from $40 per ton at the writing of the last farm bill.\n\nThis Southern Ag Today article, as well as the article on November 30, Evaluation of the Recent Government Accountability Office Sugar Program Report, underscores the necessity for a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of U.S. sugar policy.\n\nThe insights from these farm policy experts spotlight critical research studies overlooked by the GAO, including: How does the financial performance of sugar-using firms compare to other agribusinesses? An accounting and economic profit rates analysis; Factors Affecting Sugar-Containing-Product Prices; The impact of US sugar prices on the financial performance of US sugar-using firms; Economic Impact of the U.S. Sugar Industry; and the Sales and Costs of Confectionery Industries in North America.\n\nThe American Sugar Alliance is grateful that research at Louisiana State University and the University of Tennessee-Knoxville continues to inform decision-makers on agricultural production here in America and key farm bill considerations.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ASA-thumbnail.jpg 500 500 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2024-01-04 11:29:362024-01-04 16:23:25Farm Policy Experts Note Rising Costs of Producing Sugarbeets and Sugarcane\n\nThere is No Sugar Supply Shortage in the United States. Period.\n\n/\n\nRecently, big corporate candy executives have been pushing a false narrative that there is a domestic sugar shortage. According to a recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture, not only are these reports totally false — there is actually a plentiful supply of sugar, assuring American families they will once again enjoy another holiday season with all their favorite treats.\n\nConsider the following facts about how much American sugar beet and sugarcane farmers are contributing to our domestic supply right now:\n\n>> The latest USDA WASDE report showed there is plentiful supplies of sugar in the U.S. for the holidays and heading into 2024. The USDA expects a surplus of more than 3.2 billion pounds, and it is likely that will exceed 3.4 billion pounds by the end of the marketing year. Last year, the USDA reported a surplus of more than 3.7 billion pounds.\n\n>> We haven’t seen domestic shortfalls of sugar in part because when there is lower production in one region of the U.S., there is often an offsetting increase in production elsewhere.\n\n>> Weather has been a factor in certain regions, but it’s not impacting our country’s sugar supply. The U.S. has an incredibly geographically diverse sugar supply across more than two dozen states.\n\nThe U.S. had an excellent sugarbeet harvest this fall, and beet sugar production is expected to exceed 5.36 million tons, a new record.\n\nWhile drought has lowered Louisiana’s expected production from last year’s record crop of more than 2 mil tons to about 1.8 mil this year, that total may rise if good harvesting conditions continue in January.\n\nTexas’ sugarcane industry is dealing with low water supplies due to drought and Mexico’s failure to deliver water owed under the Water Treaty of 1944, but Florida’s sugarcane harvest is still coming in strong.\n\n>> Overall, U.S. sugar production is currently estimated at 9.243 mil tons of sugar, which would be the 3rd largest year of sugar production ever. In general, the United States is the 5th largest producer of sugar in the world.\n\nAs big corporate candy executives attempt to blame American farmers for problems that don’t exist, they are at the same time taking in record profits and aiming even higher.\n\nOur farmers are proud to supply America’s families as well as stores and food companies while supporting more than 151,000 jobs around the country in more than two dozen states. The $23.8 billion each year in economic activity contributes to economic opportunities for many rural and urban communities.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bryan-Simon-Pictures-2022-002_Page_07.jpg 1125 2000 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2023-12-22 11:29:402023-12-22 12:26:19There is No Sugar Supply Shortage in the United States. Period.\n\nAmerican Sugar Alliance Responds to Inaccuracies in GAO Sugar Report\n\n/\n\n“GAO continues to make major and obvious errors in their analysis of sugar policy and markets in the United States and in other countries to the detriment of American farm families and workers. We urge Congress to consider the facts, including that global sugar costs of production have routinely exceeded global sugar prices over the past 20 years, clearly evidencing a world sugar market distorted by heavily subsidized foreign sugar. Instead of relying on GAO’s flawed analysis that overlooks common sense and relies on an institutional bias against any policy that helps U.S. farm and ranch families of any commodity,” said Rob Johansson, Director of Economics and Policy Analysis for the American Sugar Alliance.\n\n“It is also unfortunate that GAO’s report ignores the economic contributions of domestic sugar production to local communities, including more than 151,000 jobs and more than $23 billion in economic activity, as well as the serious harm done to these communities due to foreign subsidies that profoundly distort the global market and harm U.S. farm families. GAO continues to utilize old studies and estimates that have been discredited. More recent economic studies conclusively demonstrate that any savings from cheaper sugar to the big multinational corporations that buy and use sugar in their products are not passed to American consumers. Instead, they add to the record profits of the users.”\n\nWhen interviewed by GAO, the American Sugar Alliance pointed out the benefits provided by current U.S. sugar policy.\n\nThe policy ensures a reliable and sustainable supply of sugar to American households and food companies that is delivered just-in-time to customers in the form that they need it. The strong and resilient U.S. sugar supply chain allows food companies to run their factories without pause or huge storage facilities, saving them hundreds of millions each year.\n\nThe policy levels the playing field for American sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers and sugar factory workers who face unfair competition resulting from the distorted world sugar market.\n\nThe policy supports American sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers, allowing them to continually increase productivity and to meet some of the highest labor and environmental standards in the world.\n\nThe policy benefits U.S. consumers and food manufacturers by addressing an increasingly unstable and unpredictable global market, where other sugar-producing countries are restricting exports in order to protect their own consumers from food insecurity.\n\nThe policy is designed to cost taxpayers $0. USDA and FAPRI show that over the next ten years, the program is expected to cost $0. It has cost $0 over the past ten years.\n\nU.S. sugar policy is supported by a large coalition of agricultural and stakeholder groups across America.\n\nASA remains committed to engaging in thoughtful discussions to ensure a well-informed approach to the future of the sugar industry, safeguarding both consumer interests and the vitality of American agriculture.\n\nSources:\n\nHow does the financial performance of sugar-using firms compare to other agribusinesses?

Our 11,000 American sugarbeet and sugarcane family farmers support more than 151,000 good-paying jobs and maintain a resilient domestic sugar supply chain for consumers and food manufacturers. We urge the House of Representatives under Speaker Johnson’s leadership to introduce and pass a Farm Bill that meets the needs of American farmers and ranchers and the communities they support.”\n\nJim Simon, General Manager of the American Sugar Cane League, added, “Speaker Johnson understands the importance of agriculture to the nation and to our state. Louisiana’s sugarcane growers and processors congratulate the new Speaker and urge Congress to act expeditiously to approve and improve the farm safety net.”\n\nThe Farm Bill, portions of which expired on September 30, 2023, plays a vital role in supporting the nation’s entire agricultural sector. In these challenging times, where farmers and ranchers face increased occurrence and severity of natural disasters, high foreign subsidies, and other predatory trade practices, a strong safety net is more crucial than ever. The Farm Bill not only provides a farm safety net but also creates more than 21 million American jobs, both on and off the farm and ranch, while fueling the U.S. economy.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png 0 0 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2023-10-25 14:56:512023-10-25 15:09:24Press Release: American Sugar Alliance Congratulates New Speaker of the House, Representative Mike Johnson\n\nBipartisan Leaders of the House and Senate Support Sugar Policy in the Farm Bill\n\n/\n\nWashington, D.C. – Members of Congress – including the leaders of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture – reiterated their support for strong U.S. sugar policy in the upcoming Farm Bill during the 38th International Sweetener Symposium held by the American Sugar Alliance.\n\nThe 22 members of Congress included Senators Stabenow (D-MI), Boozman (R-AR), Hoeven (R-ND), Klobuchar (D-MN), Smith (D-MN), Fischer (R-NE), Scott (R-FL), and Ricketts (R-NE), and Representatives Thompson (R-PA-15), Scott (D-GA-13), Costa (D-CA-21), Craig (D-MN-02), Cammack (R-FL-03), Finstad (R-MN-01), Caraveo (D-CO-08), McCollum (D-MN-04), Hinson (R-IA-02), Smith (R-NE-03), Kildee (D-MI-08), Fischbach (R-MN-08), Carter (D-LA-02), and Armstrong (R-ND-AL).\n\nChairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), noted her work to keep the sugar program strong in the 2018 Farm Bill and said, “Sugar is sweet, but its role in the economy and in communities across the country is even sweeter.” In writing the upcoming Farm Bill, she emphasized the need for “a strong coalition to defend the sugar program.”\n\nRanking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator John Boozman (R-AR), shared a statement with the industry. “Sugar producers play a vital role in agriculture. I was recently in Wyoming and heard firsthand from producers in that state about some of the challenges they face. It is important to ensure the risk management tools available to producers are effective and affordable. That means investing in improvements to the farm safety net for our producers and our rural communities.”\n\nChairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Glenn GT Thompson (R-PA-15), said, “The sugar industry is a key player on my farm team.” He reiterated that “sugar’s impact on the agriculture industry and the overall economy is significant.” Chairman Thompson noted the challenges faced by producers over the past few years. “Our nation’s producers are stretched thin,” further highlighting “the need for a domestic food supply.” On the Farm Bill, Chairman Thompson said, “Making improvements to commodity programs and crop insurance is a key priority of mine” so that farmers have “a safety net that they can rely upon when times get tough.” “If we get this right, not only are we doing right by producers but also by taxpayers who are footing the bill.”\n\nThe Ranking Member on the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. David Scott (D-GA-13), stated his support for the sugar policy. “I strongly support the sugar program and the sustainability it provides to growers of beet and cane sugar… [Sugar policy] is designed to help level the playing field at zero cost to the Federal government.”\n\nRanking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, and senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator John Hoeven (R-ND), asserted, “USDA needs to always remember that U.S. sugar policy exists to help domestic sugar farmers and their processors. It is not there to boost foreign producers that dump on the global market and don’t meet the same safety and environmental standards that U.S. farmers meet every single day.” On the Farm Bill, Senator Hoeven noted he is working on “crafting the strongest Farm Bill possible for our producers” to “improve and strengthen the farm safety net.”\n\nSenate Agriculture Committee member Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated that “protecting the [sugar] program’s integrity is among my top priorities for the Farm Bill.” The Senator thanked sugar producers for all they do to make sure consumers and food manufacturers have reliable and responsibly grown sugar.\n\nChair of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade, Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), recognized that “sugar producing and processing is a cornerstone of American agriculture.” She noted she is “pushing to ensure the core farm programs work for American producers – including protecting the sugar program.”\n\nSenate Agriculture Committee member Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) reiterated her support for sugar producers – especially in her state – and shared her goals for the upcoming Farm Bill. “I’m working to craft a [Farm] Bill that creates stronger safety nets, improves access to precision agriculture technologies, and improves disaster relief.”\n\nSenator Rick Scott (R-FL) emphasized his support for this vital industry. Understanding that farmers are facing difficult times, he told the group that “there’s no time like the present” to provide relief in the Farm Bill.\n\nSenator Pete Ricketts (R-NE) noted that “sugarbeets have played a critical role in the development of Nebraska’s panhandle” and assured the sugar industry that “ensuring the strength of our agricultural sector is essential for our economy because food security is national security. I am committed to passing a Farm Bill that reflects those priorities.”\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee member and farmer Rep. Jim Costa (D-CA-21) recognized that “sugar is an important industry because food is a national security issue.” Congressman Costa said U.S. producers are the best. “We (American farmers) can compete with anyone in the world if there’s a level playing field and it’s fair.”\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee member Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN-02) noted that sugar policy is a top priority for her in the Farm Bill. “As sugar farmers and producers, your work helps feed families and fuel the economy – and you deserve a Farm Bill that helps you sustain and grow your operations. That’s exactly what I’ll be fighting for this year.”\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee member and farmer Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fl-03) spoke on the importance of defending sugar policy and reminded sugar producers of what’s at stake. “We’ve got one shot every five years to hold together the most critical industry in the U.S…We have to talk about food security as national security.”\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee member and farmer Rep. Brad Finstad (R-MN-01) stated his number one priority in the upcoming Farm Bill is “making sure that it is written by farmers and for farmers, by rural America for rural America. Food and farm security is national security – and defending a strong American sugar policy is critical to this equation.”\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee member Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-CO-08) gave her full support for the industry. “I’m a proud advocate for domestic sugar production on the House Agriculture Committee.” She gave thanks to “the tireless work of our sugar farmers, processors, refiners, suppliers, and workers [to feed] our families every day. It’s not only vital to our economy but our everyday life.”\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee member Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN-04) emphasized her support for Minnesota sugarbeet farmers and the overall domestic sugar industry. As a leader on the House Appropriations Committee, she is “ready to fight back against deep cuts that would harm our farmers and producers who are the backbone of our food system and help keep our economy strong.”\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee member Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA-02) told sugar producers she is fighting to ensure the competitiveness of American producers. “Title I provides critical tools that we can use to protect food security and also the health of our rural communities…I am committed to elevating farmers’ priorities and perspectives to craft bipartisan policies.”\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee member Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE-03) is proud of the long history of sugar production in his state, noting that “Nebraska sugarbeet production has continued to support the state and local economies thanks to your hard work.” Rep. Smith assured sugar producers that he knows the Farm Bill is of interest and his door “is always open” to hear from the industry.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee member Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI-08) emphasized that American sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers and related jobs are “under attack from unfair competition and foreign interests,” and Congress must maintain the sugar program to “ensure fair competition between our growers and imports from abroad.” Rep. Kildee told attendees, “I’ll continue to fight for our growers against those efforts to gut the sugar program so that we can protect the growers and jobs across America.”\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee and Rules Committee member Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-MN-07) said, “The sugar industry is vital to the communities across my district and across the country.” The Congresswoman is proud to represent the largest sugarbeet-growing district in the nation. Rep. Fischbach assured sugar producers that she is closely tracking the Farm Bill renewal, saying she is “fighting for sugar producers and a strong suite of farm programs when the Farm Bill moves forward in the fall.”\n\nRep. Troy Carter (D-LA-02) said passing the Farm Bill is one of his top priorities this year. “I’m working to ensure the Farm Bill doesn’t just pass, but it has the sugar industry’s interests in mind and in the forefront.” Rep. Carter thanked the sugar industry, noting, “Not only are you supporting workers, manufacturers, and business – but you’re benefiting the American economy and people.”\n\nRep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND-AL) thanked the North Dakota sugar industry for providing thousands of jobs. “The sugar industry is incredibly important – not just important to our economy [in North Dakota] but to the ag economy as a whole.” He thanked sugar producers for “keeping our food sweet and tasting fantastic.”\n\nAmerican Sugar Alliance Chairwoman and President of the U.S. Beet Sugar Association Cassie Bladow thanked the members of Congress for addressing the industry’s annual Symposium. “We’re encouraged by your leadership and strong support for sugar policy. Thank you for appreciating our family farmers’ role as job creators and economic drivers in urban and rural communities across the country. We’re proud of our work to keep U.S.-made sugar on grocery shelves and provide timely delivery of sugar to U.S. food manufacturers.”\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Symposium-thumbnail-e1691635492131.png 85 115 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2023-08-09 22:37:152023-08-09 22:45:37Bipartisan Leaders of the House and Senate Support Sugar Policy in the Farm Bill\n\nUSDA Reiterates Support for American Sugar Producers\n\n/\n\nWASHINGTON D.C. – At the 38th International Sweetener Symposium, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC), Gloria Montaño Greene thanked sugar producers for collaborating on climate smart agriculture while acknowledging the numerous challenges sugar producers face.\n\nDeputy Under Secretary Montaño Greene assured the industry that USDA is “supportive of sugar producers.” USDA is focused on making tough decisions to balance “support for domestic producers with the demands of the sugar market.”\n\nMontaño Greene oversees the USDA’s sugar loan program as well as the disaster relief and risk-management programs critical to American farmers – including sugarbeet and sugarcane producers.\n\nU.S. sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers are navigating increasingly uncertain weather and market conditions. While sugarbeets and sugarcane are resilient, effective risk management tools are essential given the exposure to hurricanes, freezes, and frequent and more intense droughts and excess rainfall.\n\nAt the Symposium, the Deputy Under Secretary thanked sugar producers for “the work you do and your engagement with USDA. You’re not afraid of difficult conversations and we appreciate our partnership.”\n\nMontaño Greene thanked the sugar industry for their work on USDA’s Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities, noting that, “the program benefits from the input of early adopters of climate-smart practices,” including sugar producers. She also noted the opportunities available to the industry in the Inflation Reduction Act and the conservation funds available at Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\n\nModerating the panel, incoming American Sugar Alliance Chairwoman Cassie Bladow thanked USDA and Deputy Under Secretary Montaño Greene for the Department’s support of sugarbeet and sugarcane farmers and workers. “We appreciate USDA’s partnership in ensuring domestic sugar producers have adequate resources – whether that’s loans, disaster relief, or risk management tools. We rely on the talented leadership and experienced staff at FPAC to impartially administer those programs. Thank you Deputy Under Secretary Montaño Greene. Together we can ensure Americans have access to a reliable and affordable supply of sugar.”\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GMG.png 730 605 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2023-08-09 10:57:122023-08-09 13:36:08USDA Reiterates Support for American Sugar Producers\n\nCongresswoman Cammack Champions Sugar Producers in Keynote Address\n\n/\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nWashington, D.C. – American Sugar Alliance Chairman Ryan Weston kicked off the 38th International Sweetener Symposium with a keynote address from Congresswoman Kat Cammack (R-FL-03).\n\n“It’s great to bring the industry together to discuss the issues sugarcane and sugarbeet farmers are facing and hear from members of Congress on the importance of sugar policy in the Farm Bill,” said ASA Chairman Weston. “We all know the Farm Bill is incredibly important, so we are honored to have Congresswoman Kat Cammack of Florida, here today. She is a member of the House Agriculture Committee and a friend to sugar producers across the country.”\n\nOn the Farm Bill, Congresswoman Cammack emphasized, “We’ve got one shot every five years to hold together the most critical industry in the U.S…We have to talk about how food security is national security.”\n\nShe encouraged sugar producers to be involved in educating members of Congress on the importance of sugar policy. “We need to be ready to go – ready to fight – to defend sugar policy,” said Congresswoman Cammack. “Sugar is unique in that it has a great regional representation – sugarbeets up north to sugarcane in the South.”\n\nCongresswoman Kat Cammack proudly serves Florida’s Third Congressional District. As the lone Florida Republican on the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture, the Congresswoman has proven to be a true advocate for agriculture. Rep. Cammack defends Florida’s farmers, ranchers, and producers, and understands the challenges they face with rising input costs, disasters, and continually shrinking margins.\n\nAddressing Congresswoman Cammack, ASA Chairman Weston thanked her for joining the Symposium as a keynote speaker. “You have been a staunch champion for sugar producers on the Hill. Thank you for your work to preserve our family farms – especially your bipartisan Zero-for-Zero resolution with Representative Kildee to protect domestic producers against unfair trading practices in the global sugar market.”\n\nThe Zero-for-Zero resolution was reintroduced in the 118th Congress with the following members as original co-sponsors: Reps. Cammack (R-FL-03), Kildee (D-MI-8), Letlow (R-LA-5), Franklin (R-FL-18), Higgins (R-LA-3), Finstad (R-MN-1), and Fischbach (R-MN-7).\n\n###\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rep-cammack-official.jpg 1280 1024 Lillie https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Lillie2023-08-07 12:28:552023-08-08 18:45:50Congresswoman Cammack Champions Sugar Producers in Keynote Address\n\nAmerican Sugar Alliance Unites With Farm, Forestry, Environmental and Hunger Advocates on Farm Bill Passage\n\n/\n\nWASHINGTON, July 12, 2023 – Twenty groups representing agricultural, environmental, forestry, wildlife, nutrition and hunger advocates have launched the “Farm Bill for America’s Families: Sustaining Our Future” campaign to urge passage of the 2023 farm bill this year.\n\nFarm Bill for America’s Families brings together stakeholders who support the farm bill and recognize its profound impact on the well-being of all Americans.

This study highlights America’s sweetest industry, underscoring the critical importance of maintaining domestic sugar production by supporting strong farm and trade policies.\n\n“Sugar is a fundamental building block of the food we eat, and sugar production provides good paying jobs and local support that make it the backbone of many communities throughout the United States,” said Dr. Rob Johansson, Director of Economics and Policy Analysis for the American Sugar Alliance. “This report demonstrates how U.S. sugar policy supports America’s sugar farmers and workers, allowing them to maintain a safe, reliable, and affordable supply of sugar that touches all of us.”\n\nThe study, titled “Economic Impact of the U.S. Sugar Industry,” is authored by renowned agricultural economists Dr. Bart Fischer and Dr. Joe Outlaw. Drs. Fischer and Outlaw analyzed production levels and prices for the sugarcane and sugarbeet industries and profiled six growing regions to illustrate the ground-level impact of the industry.\n\nAmong the report’s findings:\n\nSugar production in America has an annual economic impact of $23.3 billion.\n\nThe sugar industry supports 151,238 direct and indirect jobs, an increase since a 2009 analysis. However, since 2009, several sugar producers have been driven out of business by increasing costs and relatively flat prices.\n\nWages and benefits associated with these jobs total $5.7 billion annually, an increase of 37 percent from the 2009 report.\n\nEfficiency gains have increased production by 13 percent.\n\nState-by-state and crop-specific results are available in the full report.\n\n“America’s sugar producers remain some of the most efficient in the world and are executing on their commitment to produce sugar sustainably,” Johansson said. “In addition to helping keep us fed, the opportunities and well-paying jobs provided by the sugar industry drive the economy in both small towns and urban centers across America. This is a testimony to the stability and certainty provided by U.S. sugar policy – without costing taxpayers a cent.”\n\nThe Texas A&M report comes as Congress begins debating the 2023 Farm Bill and as American sugarcane and sugarbeet farmers, like the rest of agriculture, face increasing pressures from rising input costs.\n\n“Rising input costs and shrinking production margins on our farms and in our factories pose a dire threat to the future of America’s sugar industry. Our family farmers are resilient, but they need sound federal farm policies to ensure that America isn’t left dependent on unreliable foreign producers for a critical food ingredient.”\n\nAmerica’s sugar producers encourage Congress to support this essential domestic industry by maintaining a strong sugar policy in the 2023 Farm Bill.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beetandcane-resources2.jpg 602 1385 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2022-06-08 11:30:322022-06-08 11:22:03America’s Sweetest Industry Supports 151,000 Jobs, $23 Billion Economic Impact\n\nNational Chocolate Chip Cookie Day\n\n/\n\nSpend some time in the kitchen as a family and bake up a batch of America’s favorite cookie!

As Americans were sheltering in place during the pandemic, dining at restaurants and other commercial food outlets decreased sharply as Americans turned to dining at home. This increase in home cooked meals translated to increased grocery store sales of sugar. The U.S. sugar industry responded to this dramatic change in the distribution supply chain to keep Americans well supplied. Moreover, no manufacturer was forced to close operations due to lack of sugar supplies.\n\nThat is because America benefits from a robust domestic sugar industry that supports 142,000 jobs in 22 states and produces high-quality sugar at an affordable price. More than 90 percent of the sugar consumed in the United States is either grown on 11,000 family farms or refined from raw sugar by American cane sugar refiners.\n\nThere are several factors that have contributed to the success of the domestic sugar supply chain:\n\nThe sugar industry is geographically diverse. Approximately half of America’s sugar production comes from sugarbeets, grown in 11 states, and sugarcane, grown in three states. These crops are processed in 45 mills, factories, and refineries across the country and sugar is distributed from 91 locations strategically located throughout the United States\n\nThe sugar industry is vertically integrated. The domestic sugar industry is largely structured as farmer-owned cooperatives. These cooperatives have made investments to respond efficiently to supply and demand challenges. The cooperative structure also allows producers to earn more of the food production dollar, supporting our vital rural communities.\n\nThe sugar industry is sustainable. Over the past 20 years, America’s sugar farmers have produced 16 percent more sugar on 11 percent less land while operating under some of the world’s highest environmental and labor standards.\n\nThe sugar industry is supported by successful farm and trade policies. America’s sugar policy ensures that we have the flexibility to respond to challenges and maintain a secure supply of sugar. All at no cost to taxpayers.\n\n“Sugar is a critical good, and we are proud of the way that America’s sugar farmers and workers have always stepped up to keep America supplied with this sweet ingredient,” said Jack Pettus, ASA’s chairman. “A strong domestic sugar industry plays a key role in our national food security and contributes to the economic well-being of our rural and urban communities. It’s critical that the United States maintain the strength and integrity of the successful farm and trade policies that underpin a viable and resilient sugar supply chain.”\n\nPlease click here to review the full report provided to the USDA.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CaneBeetAndCapitol7.jpg 1647 2121 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2021-06-21 16:00:452021-06-21 16:00:57New Report Highlights Resiliency of America’s Sugar Supply Chain\n\nMeet America’s Sugar Producers\n\n/\n\nGrowing up, fourth-generation farmer Makelle Pinsonat rode in the tractor alongside her parents in the sugarcane fields of Louisiana. Now, Makelle is raising her own family on the farm.\n\n“It’s in your blood. It’s in your heart,” Makelle says. “It’s a privilege to be able to say, ‘I’m a United States sugarcane farmer.’”\n\nAcross the country, Montana farmer Ervin Schlemmer is a fourth-generation sugarbeet farmer who cherishes the time spent working as a family.\n\n“It’s something that puts a good feeling right here in my heart to know that’s what we are all about,” Ervin says.\n\nMakelle and Ervin are two of the 11,000 farmers and farm families who grow sugarcane and sugarbeets across the country and whose stories are featured on the brand-new website: SugarAlliance.org. Those farmers – many of them multi-generational farmers, whose families have been farming the same land for more than 100 years – produce about nine million tons of sugar a year on two million acres.\n\nThose crops are then made into high-quality sugar by America’s skilled sugar workers and efficiently distributed to consumers and food manufacturers across the country. In total, America’s sugar industry supports 142,000 jobs and adds $20 billion to the U.S. economy while keeping America supplied with an essential ingredient. And sugar production is increasingly sustainable – with current U.S. production up 16 percent over the past 20 years while using 11 percent less land.\n\nIt’s incredible to see the coast-to-coast reach of America’s sugar producers.\n\nNone of this would be possible without America’s no-cost sugar policy. This policy supports America’s family farmers like Makelle and Ervin and gives them the stability to efficiently meet our nation’s sugar needs.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Makelle-1-scaled.jpg 1875 2560 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2021-02-23 09:57:052021-02-23 09:57:49Meet America’s Sugar Producers\n\nStatement on House Agriculture Committee Leadership Elections\n\n/\n\n“America’s sugar farmers and workers extend their congratulations to Congressman David Scott for his election as Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and Congressman Glenn “G.T.” Thompson for his election as the Ranking Member.

During World War II, sugar was so critical, and in such short supply since the U.S. was heavily dependent on foreign suppliers, that it was the first item to be rationed and the last item to be removed from the rationing list two years after the war ended.\n\n“Sugar is scarce, make it stretch,” one government poster urged Americans during WWII.\n\nIt’s an appropriate moment to remember this anniversary, as the world is once again at war; this time, against an invisible enemy.\n\nThere is one critical difference: U.S. farm and trade policies ensure that we now have access to an affordable and sustainable supply of sugar.\n\nDuring the 1940s, America was largely reliant on foreign nations for sugar. After the war ended and restrictions were lifted, the U.S. government sought to encourage the production of sugar here at home to make sure Americans were never again without this important food ingredient.\n\nNow, American sugarcane and sugarbeet growers and the workers who process the crop into refined sugar ensure that we have a reliable domestic source of this essential ingredient. The millions of dollars that U.S. sugar producers have invested in the U.S. supply chain ensures product gets to market quickly. And, America’s no-cost sugar policy supports 142,000 jobs in more than 20 states with an economic impact of $20 billion.\n\nMore importantly, today’s sugar policy provides flexibility to ensure that we maintain an adequate supply of homegrown and imported sugar, while ensuring we are not dependent on foreign sugar suppliers.\n\nAs the world works quickly to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, measures meant to stop the virus have also complicated supply chains and, in some cases, have slowed delivery of food ingredients. Yet grocery store shelves remain stocked with sugar at a stable price.\n\nWe are so thankful for the men and women in the sugar industry who continue to provide us with the sugar we need to provide nourishing and comforting meals to our families. In the uncertain times caused by the COVID-19, it’s reassuring to know that sugar is one less thing the American public has to worry about.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sugar-means-ships.jpg 975 1200 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2020-05-04 10:47:432020-05-04 10:47:43Sugar Policy Ensures Adequate Supplies in a Crisis\n\nSugar Producers Aid COVID-19 Fight\n\n/\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required an all hands on deck approach to protect our communities and ensure first responders have the tools they need. Sugar producers have boldly stepped up to the challenge and are making critical donations, retooling portions of their production lines or diverting sugar from their normal supply chains to create necessary products to fight COVID-19.\n\nHealth care providers across the country are desperately in need of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as N95 masks, to protect them as they are on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19. Sugar companies are donating extra masks and equipment to these first responders.\n\nMichigan Sugar Company uses PPE to keep sugar workers safe, and donated a portion of their company supply to local health systems, including hundreds of masks, safety glasses, and gloves.\n\nAmalgamated Sugar Company, which processes sugar beets in Idaho, Oregon and Washington, saw the pressing need for cloth face masks to protect against the COVID-19 virus and moved the industrial sewing machines in its quality lab into face mask production. They typically make tare sample bags but are now hard at work sewing face masks to protect their employees as they continue the essential work of producing food for our nation. Amalgamated Sugar employees are assisting in this effort as well, working to sew masks while at home.\n\n“We will donate any surplus we have once our critical infrastructure employees are adequately protected,” said Scott Winn, Amalgamated Sugar’s Vice President of Operations.\n\nBeyond masks, hand sanitizer was among the first items in short supply as the pandemic took its toll on stockpiles across the world. The sugar industry has teamed up with distilleries to help restock this critical item.\n\nIn Florida, the members of Florida Sugar & Molasses Exchange are donating molasses to Tampa Bay Rum Company to produce sanitizer that will be donated to doctors, hospitals, police, fire, EMTs, letter and package carriers or any frontline workers. U.S. Sugar is donating fermentable sugar to Sugar Sand Distillery in Lake Placid to make sanitizer.\n\nThree Roll Estate Distillery in Baton Rouge normally makes rum, but with the help of the sugarcane industry in Louisiana, they’re now distilling a higher proof alcohol for hand sanitizer.\n\nDomino Sugar’s Baltimore refinery donated sugar to Lost Ark Distilling, which will use it to create ethanol, one of the ingredients in the hand sanitizer it is producing and donating to local hospitals and first responders.\n\nIn Illinois, American Sugar Refining (ASR) Group is donating sugar and molasses to KOVAL Distillery, which will use it to create ethanol for hand sanitizer that will be given to fire stations, hospitals and ambulance companies.\n\n“By continuing to support each other and our neighbors, we will get through this crisis together and will be stronger for it,” ASR Group said.\n\nWe’re proud to lend a helping hand as we all fight COVID-19 together.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-6.42.30-AM.png 329 329 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2020-04-23 09:00:472020-04-23 09:14:05Sugar Producers Aid COVID-19 Fight\n\nAmerica’s Sugar Industry Launches SugarSustainably.org\n\n/\n\nAmerica’s sugar farmers and workers are global leaders in sustainable production, providing consumers with high-quality sugar produced under some of the world’s strictest safety, labor and environmental standards.\n\nAnd it’s all possible thanks to America’s no-cost sugar policy.\n\nToday the American Sugar Alliance launched SugarSustainably.org to highlight the commitments that our industry has made over the last several decades to preserve our natural resources, family farms and rural communities for future generations.\n\n“America’s sugar industry is proud to be on the front lines of securing a more resilient and efficient future for agriculture,” said Brian Baenig, chairman of the American Sugar Alliance.\n\nSustainable sugar production is rooted in our pledge to prioritize people, protect the planet, produce superior products, and promote fair-price policies. SugarSustainably.org shares stories from across the country about the ways that our industry has fulfilled these commitments.\n\nThe American sugar industry prioritizes people by investing in our local communities, supporting multi-generational family farms, creating 142,000 well-paying jobs and providing development opportunities for our diverse workforce.\n\nWe are continually advancing industry efforts to protect the planet, including action to reduce greenhouse gasses, sequester carbon and improve water and soil quality. Investments in research and technology have enabled sugar producers to produce 12% more sugar on 16% less land than 20 years ago while reducing carbon emissions and minimizing the use of fertilizer and pesticides.\n\nAnd we produce superior products for our customers utilizing all parts of the crop to reduce waste and create beneficial co-products. From livestock feed to road deicers, eco-friendly kitchenware, fuel and electricity generation, sugar co-products touch the lives of countless consumers.\n\nLastly, the sugar industry promotes fair-price policies in order to provide consumers with affordable sugar, help farmers mitigate risks and encourage subsidy-free markets that improve the quality of life for farmers around the globe.\n\nSugarSustainably.org features a wide range of initiatives from throughout the beet and cane sugar industries, from the innovative use of technology to leading environmental programs.\n\nThese success stories stand in stark contrast to the negative impact of a heavily subsidized world market that rewards poor environmental practices. Unfortunately, farm policy critics would like to end our no-cost sugar policy, outsourcing U.S. sugar production to this unpredictable and unsustainable global sugar market.\n\nIt’s clear that a sustainable future is one that builds upon the work already accomplished by the U.S. sugar industry to protect our environment while giving our farmers, workers and communities the opportunity to flourish.\n\nStay tuned for more stories about how America’s sugar producers are taking action to produce sugar sustainably.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SugarSustain_Social-Graphic_image-02.png 2134 2134 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2019-09-26 13:12:252022-07-06 16:38:26America’s Sugar Industry Launches SugarSustainably.org\n\nSugar Producers Send Letter to Conaway, Peterson Prior to Mark-Up\n\n/\n\nThe American Sugar Alliance sent a letter to leaders of the House Agriculture Committee yesterday, thanking the panel’s members for supporting sugar policy and asking for support in defeating possible Farm Bill amendments.\n\nThe letter expressed sugar farmers’ opposition to legislative proposals to mandate oversupplies with subsidized foreign imports and to exclude sugar farmers from loans that are available to other commodities.\n\nText of the letter, which was signed by the American Sugar Alliance executive committee, reads as follows:\n\nDear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson:\n\nOn behalf of 142,000 U.S. sugar farmers and workers, we thank you both for your continued support of America’s no-cost sugar policy. As the industry’s bankers and accountants noted in the attached letter, sugar producers are facing dire economic pressures right now, and a strong sugar policy will be essential to their ability to obtain financing and weather the storm.\n\nOpponents of this policy – driven by multinational food manufacturers – are aggressively attacking sugar producers’ safety net, which is designed to counter foreign subsidies and unfair trade practices. These attacks come even though food makers have achieved strong profits by charging consumers more for sweetened products and pocketing the savings from sugar prices that are lower today than in 1980.\n\nWe will depend on your leadership to beat back legislative attempts to further depress farmers’ prices with heavily subsidized imports. Components of H.R. 4265, which we call the “Sugar Farmer Bankruptcy Bill,” could be offered as Farm Bill amendments, and we fear these policy overhauls would have disastrous consequences if enacted.\n\nThere is overwhelming bipartisan support for current sugar policy in the House Agriculture Committee, and its members will be on solid footing in continuing their support. U.S. grocery shoppers pay 22 percent less for sugar than the rest of the developed world. Meanwhile, U.S. confectioners pay 25 percent less than companies in other developed countries and have announced more than 100 domestic expansion projects since the 2014 Farm Bill took hold.\n\nAfter years of dealing with a market distorted by unlawful, subsidized Mexican sugar imports, U.S. producers need some financial certainty right now. A five-year Farm Bill will go a long way towards providing that certainty, and we hope Congress can deliver a bill this year.\n\nWe commend each of you for the manner in which sugar policy discussions have gone to date and appreciate the continuation of existing policy in H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. We look forward to working with you as the Farm Bill process unfolds.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/slideforASA-016-featuredimage.jpg 349 373 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2018-04-18 09:28:212018-04-18 09:28:21Sugar Producers Send Letter to Conaway, Peterson Prior to Mark-Up\n\nUnion Workers Pave The Way for Sugar Farmers\n\n/\n\nIf you work on Capitol Hill, chances are good you’ve run into a sugar farmer this week. After all, there are dozens of them in town meeting with hundreds of offices.\n\nBut it’s not just farmers who are spreading the message, “Don’t cut my family out of the Farm Bill.” Union workers were in town a week earlier making the rounds.\n\n“Meeting the different representatives and being able to talk to them and understand their point of view and explaining why you’re fighting for something is important,” said William Bland, a sugar worker from Florida and member of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union (IAM).\n\nIAM is among the many organizations pushing for a strong sugar policy and fighting attempts to weaken it in the upcoming Farm Bill.\n\nFarm policy opponents are currently lobbying to outsource U.S. sugar production and good-paying U.S. jobs to heavily subsidized foreign industries that are known to have poor environmental and labor standards.\n\nMark Thompson was one of the IAM Florida Sugar Workers members who made the trip to D.C. to ask lawmakers to oppose this outsourcing scheme.\n\n“Walking the extra mile to protect our jobs is what we’re doing,” he said. “You should never be afraid to speak about something that’s important to you.”\n\nTheir trip came at an important time. Not only is Congress debating the Farm Bill, but America’s foreign competitors are busy manipulating the market in hopes of getting a leg up.\n\nIndia, the world’s second biggest sugar producer, just announced a doubling of sugar import duties to protect its domestic industry, bringing the total tax to 100%. And Pakistan increased subsidies to increase exports.\n\nAll told, more than 100 countries subsidize sugar production around the world. America’s sugar policy, which costs taxpayers $0 because it is based on loans repaid with interest instead of government checks, is all U.S. producers have to counter these foreign subsidies.\n\nIAM Florida Sugar Workers member Cornelius Fowler knows what is at stake if subsidized foreign sugar floods the market.\n\nIf there’s no sugar policy, we have “no land, no future, no job, no home,” Fowler concluded.\n\nhttps://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slideforASA-thumbnail.jpg 350 350 Staff https://sugaralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASA_logo_COLOR_221x70.png Staff2018-02-28 09:40:522018-02-28 09:40:52Union Workers Pave The Way for Sugar Farmers"
