Wade\n\n¶ Cotton Supported The Supreme Court’s Overturning Of Roe v. Wade\n\nJune 24, 2022: The Supreme Court Overturned Roe v. Wade. According to the New York Times, “The Supreme Court on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years in a decision that will transform American life, reshape the nation’s politics and lead to all but total bans on the procedure in about half of the states.” [New York Times, 6/24/22]\n\nCotton Praised The Decision Saying, “Roe Was A Tragic Mistake” And “The Supreme Court Has Finally Corrected This Mistake.” According to Cotton’s official press release, “Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) issued the following statement regarding the United States Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization: ‘Roe was a tragic mistake, taking from the American people and their elected representatives a deeply moral question. The Supreme Court has finally corrected this mistake and I highly commend the millions of Americans who toiled for years to achieve this great victory for unborn life and self-government.’” [Sen. Tom Cotton Press Release, 6/24/22]\n\n¶ Cotton Long Opposed Roe v. Wade\n\n2020: Cotton: “It’s Time For Roe v. Wade To Go.” According to a tweet from Cotton’s campaign Twitter, “It's time for Roe v. Wade to go.” [Twitter, @TomCottonAR, 9/9/20]\n\n2019: Cotton Said Roe v. Wade Was “Wrongly Decided As A Constitutional Matter.” According to Newsweek, “Existing abortion precedents, like 1973’s Roe v. Wade decision were, in Cotton’s eyes, ‘wrongly decided as a constitutional matter,’ and argued that instead, these decision are ones that the ‘American people ought to make through their elected representatives.’” [Newsweek, 5/19/19]\n\n2011: Cotton Said He Believed That Roe v. Wade And Planned Parenthood v. Casey Were “Wrongly Decided.” According to Cotton’s campaign website, “I believe Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were wrongly decided. I oppose taxpayer funding of abortion and I will work to repeal ObamaCare and to fully reinstate the Hyde Amendment, which ensures that our tax dollars don’t pay for abortion.” [Cotton For Congress, Accessed via Way Back Machine, 9/14/11]\n\n¶ Cotton Urged The Supreme Court To Overturn Roe v. Wade\n\n2012: Cotton Said He Wanted To Have A Supreme Court Willing To Overturn Roe v. Wade. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via Nexis, “All of the candidates said they oppose abortion. Rankin said she only thinks abortion should be allowed in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. She said she would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Cotton said he would support a constitutional amendment but he said it would be faster to elect an anti-abortion president and Senate because they could appoint a Supreme Court justice willing to overturn Roe v. Wade.” [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via Nexis, 4/4/12]\n\nCotton Released Statement Showing Displeasure With The Supreme Court Following Decision Of Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt\n\n2016: Cotton Accused The Supreme Court Of “Caving To The Demands Of Abortion Extremists,” After Supreme Court Ruled In Favor Of Whole Woman’s Health. According to Scott’s official press release, “‘By caving to the demands of abortion extremists who seek to normalize the ending of an innocent human life in the womb regardless of the dangers, the Supreme Court has left almost no room for common sense and simple decency in our nation's approach to abortion. I deeply believe that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and that it should be-and will be-overturned someday. But before that time, we all should have been able to agree that duly elected representatives of the people can pass laws to protect women from unsafe abortion providers. That's now impossible after this decision, and it will be to the detriment of the well-being of women across the nation.’” [Sen. Tom Cotton Press Release, 6/27/16]\n\n¶ In Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, The Supreme Court Overturned Texas’ Efforts To Restrict Abortion\n\nIn Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, The Supreme Court Invalidated Texas’ Abortion Restrictions. According to the Texas Tribune, “On a sunny Monday morning, as journalists sprinted out of the U.S. Supreme Court building, decision in hand, the crowds gathered out front exploded into cheers. It was 2016, and the high court had just overturned Texas’ latest efforts to restrict abortion access, ruling that the requirements in a 2013 law placed an undue burden on people seeking to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. […] By the time a legal challenge known as Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016, more than half of Texas’ abortion clinics had closed. During oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito, who authored Friday’s majority opinion, questioned whether those clinics closed because of the new requirements. ‘Was that their burden?’ he asked. But in the end, Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with his liberal colleagues in a 5-3 ruling that determined the requirements did constitute an undue burden on abortion-seekers in Texas.” [Texas Tribune, 6/27/22]\n\n¶ Cotton Supported Federal Efforts To Ban Abortion\n\n¶ Cotton Said He Would Support A Constitutional Amendment Banning Abortion\n\nCotton Said He Would Support A Constitutional Amendment Banning Abortion. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via Nexis, “All of the candidates said they oppose abortion. Rankin said she only thinks abortion should be allowed in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. She said she would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Cotton said he would support a constitutional amendment but he said it would be faster to elect an anti-abortion president and Senate because they could appoint a Supreme Court justice willing to overturn Roe v. Wade.” [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via Nexis, 4/4/12]\n\n¶ Cotton Supported Legislation Banning The FDA From Approving New Abortion Drugs And Place Restrictions On Those Drugs Already Approved\n\n2023: Cotton Co-Sponsored A Bill That Would Ban The FDA From Approving New Abortion Drugs And Place Restrictions On FDA-Approved Drugs Like Mifepristone. According to Congress.gov, Cotton co-sponsored the “Support And Value Expectant Moms and Babies Act,” which “prohibits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from approving any new drug (either as a brand-name drug or a generic) intended to terminate a pregnancy and imposes additional restrictions on such drugs that are already approved. Under the bill, an already-approved drug intended to terminate a pregnancy may be dispensed to a patient only with a prescription. Furthermore, the FDA may not approve any labeling change that would authorize (1) using the drug after 70 days of gestation, or (2) dispensing the drug by any means other than in-person administration by the prescribing health care practitioner. The FDA must also impose additional restrictions on such already-approved drugs, including by (1) requiring the prescribing health care practitioner to receive a special certification, (2) prohibiting the practitioner from also acting as the dispensing pharmacist, and (3) requiring the practitioner to have the ability to provide surgical intervention to the patient. The bill also rescinds any investigational use exemption already granted to such a drug if the bill would have prohibited the FDA from granting the exemption. (Currently, the FDA may grant an exemption to certain market approval requirements if a drug is intended solely for use in safety and effectiveness investigations.)” [Congress.gov, S. 95, 1/26/23]\n\nCotton Described A Federal Abortion Ban As “Reasonable”\n\nVIDEO: Cotton Said That Lindsey Graham’s Federal Abortion Ban Imposed “Reasonable Restrictions On Late Term Abortions.” According to Fox News via YouTube, “HOST: Has Lindsey Graham's messaging on a federal ban on abortion got in the way of that? COTTON: I don't think it has because Lindsey Graham has proposed something the Senate has voted on in the past, which is reasonable restrictions on late term abortions, that would simply bring the United States in line with much of the developed civilized world. France, for instance, not a notoriously conservative country, has earlier regulations on abortion.” [Fox News via YouTube, 9/20/22]\n\n¶ Graham’s Bill Would Ban Abortion After 15 Weeks Of Pregnancy\n\nGraham’s Bill Would Ban Abortion After 15 Weeks Of Pregnancy. According to Politico, “Graham’s bill bans the procedure nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a priority of many prominent anti-abortion activists who have been demanding a far more aggressive response from the GOP. It includes exceptions for rape, incest and pregnancies that threaten maternal health.” [Politico, 9/13/22]\n\nCotton Repeatedly Voted For National Abortion Bans\n\nCotton Voted For An Amendment That Would Create Penalties For Providers That Conduct Elective Abortions Later In Pregnancy\n\n2021: Cotton Voted For An Amendment That Would Create Penalties For Providers That Conduct Elective Abortions Later In Pregnancy. In August 2021, Cotton voted for an amendment which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, “create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow for legislation related to improving health programs, including to establish penalties for providers of elective abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation.” The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 48-51. [Senate Vote 348, 8/11/21; Congressional Quarterly, 8/11/21; Congressional Actions, S.Amdt. 3758; Congressional Actions, S.Con.Res.14]\n\nCotton Supported Multiple Federal Abortion Bans\n\n2019: Cotton Supported A Federal Abortion Ban. According to Cotton’s official press release, “Arkansas Senators Tom Cotton and John Boozman this week joined their colleagues in reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The legislation would provide common-sense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization, a point at which there is significant scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on the unborn. ‘Medical science increasingly confirms the common experience of parents and the religious and ethical belief of the ages: an unborn baby is just as much a person as each of us-only more innocent, more helpless, and therefore even more deserving of protection. As we celebrate Arkansas's 42nd annual March for Life this weekend, this legislation is particularly appropriate. I look forward to working with my colleagues to promote a culture of life and bring this legislation to the floor for a vote,’ said Cotton.” [Sen. Tom Cotton Press Release, 1/18/19]\n\n2018: Cotton Effectively Voted For A Federal Abortion Ban. In January 2018, Cotton voted for legislation banning abortion after the fetus is 20-weeks old. According to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would prohibit abortions in cases where the probable age of the fetus is 20 weeks or later and would impose criminal penalties on doctors who violate the ban, with certain exceptions. The bill would require a second doctor trained in neonatal resuscitation to be present for abortions where the fetus has the ‘potential’ to survive outside the womb.” The vote was on a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed, which required 60 affirmative votes. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 51 to 46. [Senate Vote 25, 1/29/18; Congressional Quarterly, 1/29/18; Congressional Actions, S. 2311]\n\n2015: Cotton Cosponsored The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. [Congress.gov, S. 1553, 3/15/16]\n\nCotton Voted For Abortion Bans In The House of Representatives\n\n2013: Cotton Voted For Banning Abortion Nationally. In June 2013, Cotton voted for a bill banning most abortion across the country twenty weeks after conception. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Passage of the bill that would create a nationwide ban on abortions performed at 20 weeks or later, except in cases where the life of the woman is in danger. It would provide exceptions to the ban in cases of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest against a minor, if it has been reported to law enforcement or a government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse. It also would impose criminal penalties on physicians who violate the ban and subject violators to a maximum five-year jail sentence, fines or both.” The House approved the bill by a vote of 228 to 196. As of November 2013, the Senate had taken any substantive action on the bill. [House Vote 251, 6/18/13; Congressional Quarterly, 6/18/13; Congressional Actions, H.R. 1797]\n\n¶ Cotton Supported So Called Fetal Personhood Legislation\n\n2014: Cotton Co-Sponsored The Life At Conception Act, Which Provides Constitutional Protection To Every “Preborn Human Person” And Says That Person Exists From The “Moment Of Fertilization.” According to the Washington Post, “A number of GOP Senate candidates, many of whom are still in primary races, are on record supporting measures that declare, in some form, that full human rights begin at the moment of fertilization. […] Gardner co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which provides for constitutional protection of the right to life of each ‘preborn human person,’ defined as existing from the ‘moment of fertilization.’ Co-sponsors of the act include Rep. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rep. Steve Daines of Montana, both of whom are expected to become their state’s GOP Senate nominee.” [Washington Post, 4/17/14]\n\n¶ Cotton Said That “Life Begins At Conception”\n\nCotton Said That “Life Begins At Conception.” According to Newsweek, “Cotton repeatedly lamented ‘unelected judges in Washington’ for allowing abortion procedures to continue across the states. Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton said he believes a fetus has constitutional rights and that life begins at conception. ‘I personally believe that life begins at conception, as long as we have unelected judges making the basic rules for abortion though we should try to find ways in which we can protect the most innocent lives that can survive,’ he said. Cotton continued: ‘I personally believe that life does begin at conception, that's the standard that most Republicans who have held the presidency in modern times have held as well. Now, we understand there are certain tragic cases like rape or incest or where a mother's life is in danger that we ought to make an account for — that was the position that Ronald Reagan has as well.’” [Newsweek, 5/19/19]\n\n¶ Cotton Was Criticized For Supporting Extreme Personhood Language Which Could Ban IVF And Contraceptives\n\nGail Collins: Cotton Was A Supporter Of Personhood, Which Could Outlaw In-Vitro Fertilization And Some Forms Of Contraception. According to a column by Gail Collins in the New York Times, “Personhood is an anti-abortion movement that holds that life begins at conception, giving fertilized eggs all the rights of a human being. It might make it impossible to kidnap them for in-vitro fertilization. It could outlaw some forms of contraception. […] A number of Republican candidates in key Senate races are personhood supporters, including Joni Ernst in Iowa; Thom Tillis, who’s running against Senator Kay Hagan in North Carolina; Tom Cotton, who’s challenging Mark Pryor in Arkansas; and, until about five minutes ago, Cory Gardner in Colorado.” [New York Times, Column – Gail Collins, 6/27/14]\n\nMax Brantley: Cotton’s Record Shows He Was Against Birth Control Pills In Some Cases. According to an opinion piece by Max Brantley in the Arkansas Times, “A day — heck an hour, it seems like — doesn't pass without a direct e-mail from Extremist U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton or one of his social media enablers touting Cotton's animus toward women. He doesn't say he’s against women, of course. He says he’s ‘pro-life.’ He is against abortion, in other words. And he's also, as an examination of his record shows, even against birth control pills in some cases.” [Arkansas Times, Opinion – Max Brantley, 1/22/14]\n\n¶ Cotton’s Stance Against IVF And Some Forms Of Contraception Was Described As Extreme And Unpopular\n\nDavid Ramsey: Cotton’s Personhood Stance “Might Be Seen As Too Extreme—And Outright Ban On Both All Abortion And Some Forms of Contraception.” According to an opinion piece by David Ramsey in the Arkansas Times, “U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, you may remember, was a co-sponsor of the ‘Life at Conception Act,’ a so-called personhood measure which would give full constitutional rights to each ‘preborn human person’ at the ‘moment of fertilization. In addition to being a frontal assault on Roe v. Wade, the bill (likely unconstitutional) could ban certain forms of birth control such as IUDs or the morning-after pill. (It could also potentially force women into dangerous pregnancies and to deliver babies that can’t survive outside the womb, or force families in situations like this to keep a braindead woman on life support). [… ] Even in Arkansas, Cotton’s position here might be seen as too extreme — an outright ban on both all abortion and some forms of contraception.” [Arkansas Times, Opinion – David Ramsey, 4/16/14]\n\n¶ Cotton Praised States’ Egregious Abortion Bans\n\n¶ Cotton Commended Arkansas’ Attorney General, Leslie Rutledge, For Implementing A Statewide Abortion Ban\n\nCotton Commended Arkansas’ Attorney General, Leslie Rutledge, For Implementing Statewide Abortion Ban. According to Cotton’s official Twitter, “I commend @AGRutledge for her efforts to protect the unborn in Arkansas. This is a momentous day.” [Twitter, @SenTomCotton, 6/24/22]\n\nThe Same Day The Supreme Court Overturned Roe v. Wade, Rutledge Implemented The 2019 Statewide Abortion Ban. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, “Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Friday afternoon implemented a 2019 law that bans abortions in Arkansas, except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier in the day overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion across the country. The Republican attorney general, who was flanked by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, certified that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling in accordance with Act 180 of 2019. This in turn certified Arkansas's Trigger Abortion law. ‘None of us thought today would come in our lifetimes,’ Rutledge said to a crowd of media members and politicians. ‘Roe was wrong on that day and it has been wrong everyday since.’ Hutchinson called the decision a turning point for the nation. ‘The [Supreme] Court returned the issue of abortion to the states,’ Hutchinson said. ‘Since Roe vs Wade was decided, the states that desired to protect unborn life had been prohibited from doing so.’” [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 6/24/22]\n\n¶ Due To The Law, Abortion Was Nearly Completely Banned In Arkansas\n\nDue To The Law, Abortion Was Nearly Completely Banned In Arkansas. According to ABC News, “Abortion is nearly completely banned in Arkansas due to a trigger law that went into effect following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Arkansas Human Life Protection Act, or Act 180, makes performing or attempting to perform an abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. The only exception is if the mother's life is in danger.” [ABC News, 6/22/23]\n\n¶ Cotton Lauded The Supreme Court's Decision To Let Texas' Abortion Ban Go Into Effect\n\n2021: Cotton Said The Supreme Court’s Decision To Let Texas’ Abortion Ban Stand Would Save “Countless Innocent Lives.” According to a tweet from Cotton’s official account, “The Supreme Court just let Texas’s pro-life law go into effect, saving countless innocent lives.” [Twitter, @SenTomCotton, 9/2/21]\n\n¶ The Texas Law Outlawed Abortion Before Most People Know They Are Pregnant And Allowed Private Citizens To Sue To Block Procedures\n\nThe Texas Abortion Ban Outlawed Abortion Before Many People Know They Are Pregnant And Allowed Private Citizens To Sue To Block Procedures. According to NPR, “With the U.S. Supreme Court mum, a new law went into effect in Texas that bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. That’s well before many women even know they are pregnant. The law allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone else who helps a woman obtain an abortion — including those who give a woman a ride to a clinic or provide financial assistance to obtain an abortion. Private citizens who bring these suits don’t need to show any connection to those they are suing. The law makes no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest.” [NPR, 9/1/21]\n\n¶ Cotton Attacked And Antagonized Planned Parenthood Throughout His Career\n\n¶ Cotton Voted At Least Five Times To Defund Planned Parenthood\n\n¶ 2018: Cotton Voted To Defund Planned Parenthood\n\n2018: Cotton Voted To Defund Planned Parenthood. In August 2018, Cotton voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “prohibit[ed] federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood.” The underlying legislation was an FY 2019 Labor, HHS, Education and Defense appropriations bill. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 45 to 48. [Senate Vote 191, 8/23/18; Congressional Quarterly, 8/23/18; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 3967; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 3695; Congressional Actions, H.R. 6157]\n\n¶ 2017: Cotton Voted At Least Twice To Defund Planned Parenthood\n\n2017: Cotton Voted For The Health Care Freedom Act, Or So Called “Skinny Repeal,” Which Defunded Planned Parenthood For One Year. In July 2017, Cotton voted for the Health Care Freedom Act, also known as “skinny repeal.” According to Vox, “The Health Care Freedom Act is the Senate Republicans’ last-ditch attempt to repeal Obamacare. Released around 10 o’clock Thursday night, it is expected to come to a vote early Friday morning. […] This HCFA would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that all Americans carry coverage. It would nix the requirement that large employers provide coverage to all workers, too. The bill includes a three-year repeal of the medical device tax and a one-year defunding of Planned Parenthood.” The vote was on the amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 49 to 51. [Senate Vote 179, 7/28/17; Vox, 7/27/17; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 667; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 267; Congressional Actions, H.R. 1628]\n\n2017: Cotton Voted To Repeal Significant Portions Of The Affordable Care Act, Such As Sunsetting The Medicaid Expansion, Repealing The Individual Mandate And Defunding Planned Parenthood. In July 2017, Cotton voted for the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have “sunset Medicaid expansion and certain taxes created under the 2010 health care overhaul, repeal[ed] the individual and employer mandates, would [have] exclude[d] health plans that cover abortion from certain tax credits and would [have] ban[ned] federal funding for abortion providers that receive at least $1 million in federal funding annually.” The underlying legislation was the reconciliation vehicle for Trumpcare. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 45 to 55. [Senate Vote 169, 7/26/17; Congressional Quarterly, 7/25/17; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 271; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 267; Congressional Actions, H.R. 1628]\n\n¶ 2015: Cotton Voted At Least Twice To Defund Planned Parenthood\n\n2015: Cotton Voted For A Bill That Defunded Planned Parenthood. In December 2015, Cotton voted for a bill that according to Congressional Quarterly, would have “scrap[ed] in 2018 the law's Medicaid expansion, as well as subsidies to help individuals buy coverage through the insurance exchanges.” Additionally, according to Congressional Quarterly the bill would have “repeal[ed] portions of the 2010 health care law and block[ed] federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. As amended, the bill would zero-out the law’s penalties for noncompliance with the law’s requirements for most individuals to obtain health coverage and employers to offer health insurance.” The vote was on passage of a reconciliation bill. The Senate approved the bill by a vote of 52 to 47. The bill was later passed by the full Congress, which the president then vetoed. The House was not able to override the veto. [Senate Vote 329, 12/3/15; Congressional Quarterly, 12/3/15; Real Clear Politics, 12/4/15; Congressional Actions, H.R. 3762]\n\n2015: Cotton Voted For Defunding Planned Parenthood. In May 2015, Cotton voted for barring all federal funding to Planned Parenthood. According to CNN, “The fight over funding for Planned Parenthood shifts to a must-pass government funding measure this fall after a procedural vote in the Senate on legislation that would have barred all federal funds for the group failed on Monday.” The vote was on cloture the Motion to Proceed; the motion was rejected by a vote of 53 to 46; 60 Senators voting yes would have been required to proceed. [Senate Vote 262, 8/3/15; CNN, 8/4/15; Congressional Actions, S. 1881]\n\n¶ Cotton Voted Against Protections For Planned Parenthood Funding\n\n2017: Cotton Voted To Overturn Federal Regulations Which Protected Planned Parenthood From Federal Funding Cuts. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, “With Vice President Mike Pence casting the deciding vote, the U.S. Senate voted to overturn a recent federal regulation that has shielded Planned Parenthood from funding cuts. The measure is now headed to the White House. U.S. Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton, both Arkansas Republicans, supported scrapping the rule, which seeks to keep family-planning dollars flowing to organizations that also perform abortions. […] In a written statement after Thursday's vote, Cotton said the legislation deserved to pass. ‘States should be free to decide which organizations receive federal funding for family planning services. And they shouldn't be required to [give] taxpayer money to groups like Planned Parenthood that perform abortions. I'm pleased we were able to take another chunk out of the Obama administration's overzealous regulatory agenda,’ he said.” [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 3/31/17]\n\n¶ Cotton Blasted Efforts To Provide Pandemic Aid To Planned Parenthood Health Centers\n\n2021: Cotton Sent A Letter To SBA Administrator Demanding The SBA To Stop Awarding PPP Loans To Planned Parenthood. According to Cotton’s official press release, “Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) sent a letter urging U.S. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza to prevent Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving illegal loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as they did last year.” [Sen. Tom Cotton Press Release, 1/14/21]\n\n2020: Cotton And McConnell Led 27 Senators Urging The Department Of Justice To Investigate Planned Parenthoods PPP Loans. According to Politico, “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans are demanding that Attorney General William Barr investigate Planned Parenthood centers that got emergency small business loans under a government program intended to avert layoffs. In a letter Thursday to Barr, 27 GOP senators led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and McConnell said Planned Parenthood affiliates received about $80 million in loans under the so-called Paycheck Protection Program but should have been ineligible — a claim that Planned Parenthood disputes. ‘It was not designed to give government funds to politicized, partisan abortion providers like Planned Parenthood,’ the senators wrote. ‘The funds in the program are not unlimited and were depleted once already because of high demand.’” [Politico, 5/21/20]\n\n¶ Cotton Promoted Discredited Videos And Urged The Government To Go After Planned Parenthood Based On THe Videos’ Faulty Claims\n\n2015: After Discredited And Misleading Video Surfaced Of Planned Parenthood Employees, Cotton Called For U.S. Attorney General To Conduct An Investigation Into Planned Parenthood To Determine Whether The Organization Violated Federal Laws. According to THV 11, “U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton requested an investigation into Planned Parenthood following the release of videos showing senior executives discussing in horrific detail the organization's role in harvesting organs of unborn babies. […] Boozman and Cotton also called on U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to conduct a full investigation into whether Planned Parenthood violated federal law. In a letter sent yesterday, Boozman, Cotton and their colleagues joined Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) urging the Attorney General and DHHS Secretary to investigate whether Planned Parenthood violated sections 498A and 498B of the Public Health Service Act. Section 498A requires doctors to certify that they did not alter the method or timing of an abortion for the purpose of obtaining human fetal tissue when that tissue is used in research conducted or supported by the National Institute of Health. Section 498B prohibits the sale of human fetal issue. ‘The disturbing facts revealed in this video raise the question of whether the employees of a federally funded organization have violated federal law by engaging in the transfer of human fetal tissue for profit, and whether the modification of abortion techniques for the purpose of obtaining that tissue violates applicable research guidelines established by federal law,’ the senators wrote.” [THV 11, 7/22/15]\n\nBusiness Insider: Republican Outrage Sparked After Heavily Edited Video Showed Planned Parenthood Doctor Explaining That The Organization Collected Tissue From Aborted Fetuses For Medical Research. According to Business Insider, “Republicans are wading back into the abortion debate, on the heels of a controversial video that shows a discussion of using tissue from aborted fetuses. Earlier this week, a video the group charges was heavily edited surfaced. It featured a Planned Parenthood doctor appearing to explain how the health-services organization collects tissue from aborted fetuses for medical-research purposes. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards apologized for the tone of the doctor in the video on Thursday, but said that it does not make money off aborted fetal tissue. But the video sparked immediate outrage on the right, with Republican leaders vowing to investigate the organization and Republican presidential candidates quick to call for more restrictions on abortion. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) tweeted that America needs to ‘foster a culture of life.’ NOLA notes that Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) called for a state investigation into Planned Parenthood clinics operating in his home state, and is attempting to block a new clinic from opening until the investigation is complete.” [Business Insider, 7/17/15]\n\n¶ Citing The Videos, Cotton Called To Defund Planned Parenthood\n\nCotton Called To Put An End To Federal Funding For Planned Parenthood.

But where words fall short I'm hopeful that we can be united in action: we must put an end to the federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Arkansans' tax dollars should not be supporting an organization that condones the activity we've seen in the videos released this week. This should be one issue that transcends partisan politics or ideology.

U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who also has a seat on the Armed Services Committee, said on Fox News Sunday that Biden is the one to blame for the current standoff. ‘[I]f the secretary of Defense and the president think this is a readiness issue and they want to find the responsible party, they should look in the mirror,’ Cotton said. ‘They’re the ones who are violating the law and using taxpayer funds to pay for abortion tourism.’ [...] Cotton said the administration should stop its abortion policy if they want the holds to be lifted. ‘Well it should end with (Defense Secretary) Lloyd Austin and Joe Biden agreeing to follow the law and rescinding their policy,’ he said. ‘… If Lloyd Austin and Joe Biden think this is a threat to our national security, the simplest thing to do would be to revert to the same practices we have had for decades.’” [Yellowhammer, 7/17/23]\n\n¶ Cotton Was Hostile To Contraception Access\n\nCotton Supported Legislation And Legal Action To Provide Big Carve-Outs For Corporations To Deny Contraception Coverage\n\n2013: Cotton Voted To Add A Provision Allowing Employers To Opt-Out For A Year From The ACA’s Requirement That Employer-Provided Health Insurance Cover Women’s Preventative Care, Including Contraception, To Legislation That Would Have Prevented A Government Shutdown. In September 2013, Cotton voted to amend a proposed continuing appropriations resolution that would have funded the federal government through November 15, 2013, by adding a provision that, according to CNN, was a “so-called ‘conscience clause,’” which “would allow employers and insurers to opt out of preventative care for women which they find objectionable on moral or religious grounds. That prominently includes birth control, which most insurers are required to provide for free under current Obamacare rules. […] With this move, House Republican leaders would give any employer or group health plan the ability to opt out of contraception coverage for the next year.” The other provisions, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have “delay[ed] for one year implementation of any provision of the 2010 health care overhaul that would take effect between Oct. 1, 2013, and Dec. 31, 2014, including the individual mandate and the imposition or increase of specified taxes and fees, […] bar[red] appropriations and transfers from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Fund, […] [and] set the expiration date for the continuing appropriations to Dec. 15, 2013.” The vote was on a motion to concur, with a further amendment, to the Senate’s amendment to the continuing resolution that the House had passed 10 days earlier.

According to Congress.gov, Cotton co-sponsored the “Parental Notification and Intervention Act,” which would restrict the performance of an abortion on an unemancipated minor under 18 years of age. Specifically, it prohibits a person or organization from performing, facilitating, or assisting with an abortion on an unemancipated minor without first complying with certain requirements, including parental notification and a 96-hour waiting period. It establishes penalties—a fine, up to one year in prison, or both—for each willful violation. A parent who is required to be notified of an abortion of an unemancipated minor may sue in federal court to prohibit the abortion. Parental notification requirements may be waived in a medical emergency or in a case of physical abuse.” [Congress.gov, S. 294, 2/8/21]\n\n¶ Parental Notification Legislation Could Subject Young People To Harm And Abuse Or Cause Them To Delay Seeking Out Care\n\nNYCLU: Parental Notification Laws “Increase The Risk That Minors Will Suffer Harm Or Abuse, Avoid Or Delay Seeking Necessary Care.” According to the NYCLU, “It is well documented in public health studies and in court rulings that parental involvement laws are bad public health policy because they increase the risk that minors will suffer harm or abuse, avoid or delay seeking necessary care, and/or seek out more dangerous alternatives in order to avoid involving their parents.” [NYCLU, 6/4/08]\n\n¶ Cotton Supported So-Called “Born Alive” Legislation To Restrict Abortion\n\n¶ Cotton Supported So-Called “Born Alive” Legislation\n\n2019: Cotton Sponsored The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

In February 2021, Cotton voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to waive all applicable sections of the Congressional Budget Act with respect to the Durbin, D-Ill., point of order that the Sasse amendment no. 192 amendment is not germane and thus violates section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act. The amendment would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow for legislation related to improving health care, including legislation to establish criminal and civil penalties for health care providers who do not provide the same degree of medical care for an infant who survives an abortion procedure as would be provided to another infant born at the same gestational age.” The vote was on a motion to waive.

According to Vox, “Abortions in the third trimester are very rare: Just 1.4 percent of all abortions take place at 21 weeks or beyond, according to Planned Parenthood. The situation described in the Virginia committee hearing simply doesn’t come up, Brandi said — ‘patients do not request abortion when they are in labor and doctors do not provide it.’” [Vox, 2/25/19]\n\nProtections Exist For Babies Born After An Attempted Abortion.

This Strange Amendment was not about segregating federal funds from abortion – it was really about restricting access to safe and legal abortion. This proposal needlessly restricted women’s access to private plans that offer abortion coverage. Health plans participating in the Marketplace may already choose whether or not to offer coverage of abortion – unless state law prohibits or requires abortion coverage.” The underlying legislation was the legislative vehicle for Trumpcare.

On October 9th, 2013, Cotton co-sponsored HR 3279. According to a press release by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), “With the exchanges of the ‘Affordable Care Act’ (AKA ‘Obamacare’) activated this month, it has become evident that it is nearly impossible for individuals to try to determine which exchange plans on their state or federal exchange, if any, exclude abortion.

Diane Black (TN-06) and Chris Smith (NJ-04) unveiled their legislation, H.R. 3279, the ‘Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act’ —cosponsored by 70 other Members of the House—to ensure full disclosure of abortion coverage, requiring prominent and transparent disclosure of abortion coverage for each plan offered on an exchange. This is crucial information for millions of Americans since the many plans that include elective abortion are required by law to impose a monthly mandatory abortion surcharge. Many Americans object to paying a surcharge into a fund to be used solely for the purpose of aborting unborn babies.” As of December 9th, 2013, the bill was referred to the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and no further action was taken.

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., that would disapprove of a Veterans Affairs Department rule related to abortion. In September, the VA issued an interim final rule that would allow the department to provide abortions to pregnant veterans and their beneficiaries in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest.

In March 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Cotton voted for the “motion to waive all applicable sections of the Congressional Budget Act with respect to the Murray, D-Wash., point of order that the Lankford amendment no. 1031 to the Schumer, D-N.Y., substitute amendment no. 891 to the bill is not germane and thus violates section 313(b)(1)(d) of the Congressional Budget Act. The amendment would make conforming changes to insert the bill's provisions related to public health programs and domestic violence prevention and support programs into the December 2020 omnibus appropriations and coronavirus relief law, which would prohibit the use of funds for abortion services.” The vote was on a motion to waive. The Senate failed to acquire a 3/5 majority and rejected the motion by a vote of 52-47. [Senate Vote 94, 3/6/21; Congressional Quarterly, 3/6/21; Congressional Actions, S.Amdt. 1031; Congressional Actions, S.Amdt. 891; Congressional Actions, H.R. 1319]\n\nCotton Signed A Letter Vowing To Vote Against Any Legislation Which Would “Eliminate” Or “Weaken” The Hyde amendment\n\n2021: Cotton Joined Senators In A Letter To Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, To Vote Against Any Legislation Which Would Eliminate Or Weaken The Hyde Amendment. According to a letter released by Sen. Marco Rubio and signed by Cotton “We are united in our resolve to guard against any changes to Federal law that would unsettle nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus against taxpayer funding for abortion on demand, or otherwise threaten the lives of unborn children. Accordingly, we are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.” [Sen. Marco Rubio, 2/5/21]\n\n¶ Cotton Voted To Prohibit Federal Funds For Health Benefits That Cover Abortions\n\n2019: Cotton Effectively Voted For Legislation Prohibiting Federal Funds From Funding Abortions Or Health Benefits Covering Abortions. In January 2019, Cotton effectively voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “prohibit[ed] federal funds from being used to fund abortions or to fund health benefits covering abortions.” The vote was on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. The Senate rejected the motion, thereby defeating the bill, by a vote of 48 to 47. [Senate Vote 7, 1/17/19; Congressional Quarterly, 1/17/19; Congressional Actions, S. 109]\n\n2014: Cotton Co-Sponsored A Bill That Would Prohibit The Expenditure Of Federal Funds For Any Abortion, Including Funds From Being Used For Health Benefits Coverage That Includes Abortion Coverage. On September 30th, 2013, Cotton co-sponsored HR 7, a bill that, according to the Congressional Research Service, would “prohibit the expenditure of funds authorized or appropriated by federal law or funds in any trust fund to which funds are authorized or appropriated by federal law for any abortion. [Would] Prohibit[] federal funds from being used for any health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion.” The bill was reported to the Judiciary Committee on January 23, 2014, and no subsequent action was taken. [HR 7, 1/24/14]\n\nNo Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act Would Change U.S. Tax Code To Establish That “Individuals May Only Deduct Medical Expenses Related To Abortion In Cases Of Rape, Incest Or Endangerment Of Life.” According to the Washington Post’s “She The People,” “But one thing the IRS probably isn’t very good at is deciding whether or not a woman has been raped. That’s why some provisions of the ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act’ don’t make a whole lot of sense. H.R. 7, which is sponsored by Rep. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.), would change the tax code so that individuals may only deduct medical expenses related to abortion in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of life.” [Washington Post, 1/22/14]\n\nBill Would Empower IRS To Investigate Whether A Woman Had Improperly Attempted To Deduct Medical Expenses For An Abortion That Did Not Result From Rape, Incest Or To Save The Life Of The Mother. According to the Washington Post’s “She The People,” “That provision seems pretty innocuous until you stop and ask: Who’s supposed to decide when a medical expense is related to a pregnancy caused by rape or incest? Supporters of H.R. 7 — the bill has 164 co-sponsors, including 11 women and four Democrats — would give that authority to the Internal Revenue Service. Yes, that’s right. The same organization that has been vilified for targeting certain organizations with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names to help determine whether they qualify for tax-exempt status will be able to target individuals to make sure that they’re not improperly claiming deductions for an abortion that wasn’t due to rape, incest or to save the mother’s life.” [Washington Post, 1/22/14]\n\nBill Would Grant IRS “The Authority To Ask A Woman To Prove That She’s Been Raped.” According to the Washington Post’s “She The People,” “Should the Internal Revenue Service have the authority to ask a woman to prove that she’s been raped?” [Washington Post, 1/22/14]\n\nCotton Voted To Prevent Zika Funding From Being Used To Pay For Abortions\n\n2016: Cotton Effectively Voted For An FY 2017 Military Construction And Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill Which Also Provided $1.1 Billion In Zika Funding, $800 Million Less Than Requested While Also Stipulating That No Funding Could Be Used To Pay For Abortions. In September 2016, Cotton effectively voted for an FY 2017 military construction and veterans affairs conference report which would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “provide[d] $82.5 billion in fiscal 2017 appropriations for the Veterans Affairs Department, military construction and military housing and would provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat the Zika virus with about $750 million in offsets.” The vote was on a motion to invoke cloture, which required 60 affirmative votes. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 52 to 46. [Senate Vote 135, 9/6/16; Congressional Quarterly, 6/28/16; Congressional Actions, H.R. 2577]\n\nLegislation Required That No Zika Funding Could Be Used To Pay For Abortions. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The measure requires that the Zika funding provided be subject to restrictions on appropriations included in the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations act (PL 114-113), which included a prohibition on the use of funds to pay for abortions. (Under federal law, U.S. foreign aid funding may not be used by other nations or organizations to pay for abortions. Some women’s health groups have urged the Obama administration to use its executive authority to reinterpret the prohibition so that federal funds could be used to fund the abortions of women who contracted Zika and fear giving birth to babies with microcephaly.)” [Congressional Quarterly, 6/23/16]\n\nCotton Voted To Prevent Federal Funds For Domestic Trafficking Victims From Being Used To Pay For Most Abortion Services\n\n2015: Cotton Effectively Voted For Expanding The “Hyde Amendment” To Prevent Federal Funds In A Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund From Being Used To Pay For Most Abortion Services. In April 2015, Cotton voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “remove[d] a provision in the bill that would state that amounts in the Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund would be subject to limitations in the fiscal 2014 consolidated appropriations law prohibiting money appropriated under the law from being spent on abortions, except for cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger, to the same extent as if the money from the fund was appropriated under that law.” According to Planned Parenthood, the underlying bill, which established the Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund that provided additional resources to survivors of human trafficking “ma[d]e permanent a prohibition of federal tax dollars from being used to pay for access to abortion care - a restrictive and harmful policy commonly referred to as the Hyde amendment.” The vote was on the amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 43 to 55. [Senate Vote 156, 4/22/15; Congressional Quarterly, 4/22/15; Planned Parenthood, 2016 Congressional Scorecard; Congressional Actions, S. Amdt. 301; Congressional Actions, S. 178]\n\nCotton Co-Sponsored The Republican Study Committee Health Care Plan That Would Have Limited Abortion Funding\n\n2013: Cotton Co-Sponsored The Republican Study Committee Health Care Plan. According to the National Review, “Either way, the notion that Republicans have no plan to replace Obamacare is news to Representative Tom Price (R., Ga.), who in June introduced a comprehensive alternative health-care plan — for the third time since 2009. It was originally introduced as the Obamacare alternative from the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC), which Price chaired at the time. The 250-page legislation, known as the Empowering Patients First Act, has yet to receive a vote in the House, but currently has 32 co-sponsors, including Representatives Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.), Tim Huelskamp (R., Kans.), Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), and Tom Cotton (R., Ark.).” [National Review, 8/16/13]"
