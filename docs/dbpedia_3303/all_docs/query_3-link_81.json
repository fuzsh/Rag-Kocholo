        "text": "Ninth-grade students learned from a special guest Tuesday in their civics class.\n\nSen. John Boozman appeared via Skype in teacher Randall Bruce’s Pre-AP Civics class at Trinity Junior High School to answer students’ questions about his role as senator.\n\nThe questions spanned from what accomplishment Boozman is most proud of to what the most difficult part of the election process was to what he does in his free time and what book he’s reading right now.\n\nHe told them about the committees he is a part of including public works and agricultural, and of his frequent travels to and from Arkansas and Washington, D.C.\n\n“You’re away from your own bed quite a bit,” he said.\n\nSome of the things Boozman is most proud of include changes to the GI bill and the passage of legislation intended to help veterans with traumatic brain injury, he said.\n\n“So much of his job goes well beyond lawmaking,” Bruce said.\n\nBoozman talked to the students about unique instances where he has intervened, such as one scenario where a 16-year-old girl went to get her driver’s license and was instead arrested. She was born in another country to an American citizen, but the proper paperwork was never completed and she could have been deported, Boozman said. He stepped in to help with the paperwork so that she would not be deported.\n\nBoozman said that one day, one of the students could be in his position.\n\n“I grew up just like you guys. I sat in desks just like yours,” he said.\n\nOne of the students’ parents works under Boozman, Bruce said, and helped arrange the Skype meeting. Bruce had each student come up with a question to ask the senator, although time did not allow for each student to ask his or hers.\n\nWhile Bruce can teach the students about how the government functions, he cannot speak from personal experience, he said.\n\nIt’s good for the students to hear from someone who is “in the trenches,” so to speak, he said.\n\n“He lives the life. He does the work,” Bruce said.\n\nThe conversation the students had with the senator is something Bruce can discuss further with this class and other classes, he said.\n\n“I had no idea that he was part of all those committees,” he said. “We teach them that lawmaking happens in committees.\"\n\nStudent Claire Watts said, “I learned more about the Republican side of things.”\n\nWatts also learned more about how much Boozman travels and what it is like to work with the federal government, she said."
