        "text": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich sent out a fund-raising letter last week on behalf of Princella Smith, a former spokeswoman at his American Solutions think tank, who is running for the Republican nomination for Congress in the Arkansas district held by Rep. Marion Berry.\n\n\"A native of Wynne and a graduate of Ouachita Baptist University, her roots run deep in Arkansas,\" Gingrich wrote potential givers. \"Working under her mentors -- Arkansas leaders such as the late Lt. Gov. Win Rockefeller, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, and US Rep. John Boozman, among others -- her impressive experience suits her to effectively represent Arkansas. But she needs your help.\"\n\nUnmentioned by Gingrich, or by Smith in her campaign biography, is Rep. Anh \"Joseph\" Cao, R-New Orleans, her last boss. Of that job, the bio says only that \"she has served as a Communications Director on Capitol Hill.\" It may be that Cao's name doesn't' carry any special resonance for voters in Arkansas, but it also may be that those who know him know that he is among the least conservative House Republicans, who voted for the health-care overhaul last year. Smith has signed a pledge that, if elected to Congress, she will seek the bill's repeal."
