        "text": "Is This the End of the Line for These Formerly Free Wild Mares from Wyoming? by Carol J. Walker\n\nLast week I was finally allowed to visit the over 500 mares rounded up during the Checkerboard Roundup last fall. Although I requested of everyone I could many many times, it was not until 10 days before that I found out about the opportunity for members of the public to take a two hour tour of the private facility. It was not that the BLM could not allow visitors before that, it was that they chose not to. R.T. Fitch the President of Wild Horse Freedom Federation was with me.\n\nThere were 1056 wild horses at the facility and roughly 569 were mares from the Checkerboard Roundup. There had been 250 foals born this spring, and foals were still being born.\n\nThis is not one of those “off range pastures” that the BLM brags about having the horses knee deep in grass. No, this is a horse feed lot. No shade, no shelter, dry as a bone, in the dryest, hottest part of Idaho, and it was only the beginning of June. There is just sandy dirt and fences as far as the eye could see. They put the hay outside the pens to minimize waste and the horses stick their heads through the bars to reach it. The mares with foals were in the interior pens and they put the hay on the ground inside in those pens. The impact of seeing these mares that I had last seen in Wyoming with their families was devastating and sickening to me.\n\nWe were driven around the facility while sitting on hay bales on a flatbed pulled by a truck. They went slowly up and down the aisles, and even drove twice past the mare foal pens and did stop twice for us. We were not allowed to get off the flatbed or walk outside the pens or enter the pens. Do you know how hard it is to find specific horses that way? I contrasted this with the help I received at Canon City finding horses in 2014 after the first Checkerboard Roundup – I was escorted on foot, showed inside pens and helped to find tag numbers. At Canon City, they wanted to get the horses adopted, they were willing to help us reunite families. Now, this tour was designed to pacify people “we have nothing to hide” and nothing more. They do not care about the horses, do not care what happens to them ultimately. They have no motivation to have people adopt these horses and help them find good homes.\n\nYes I was looking for specific horses – the mares in the Palomino stallion rounded up in Salt Wells Creek on the last day of the Checkerboard Roundup last October. Champ is now at Skydog Sanctuary in Oregon, and Clare Staples was there looking for his mares and Goliath’s grey mare. We did not find them.\n\nThe foals don’t know anything more than this – they were born here, they do not miss their family members, miss the wide open spaces, the cool canyons, the runs across the prairie. They are not the ones that break my heart. The older mares do. The BLM representative carelessly said “as soon as the foals are weaned at 6 months old, they and the mares will be sent out for adoption.” I said what about the mares over 10 years old? Surely they will not be sent out to be adopted. They can be sold without limitation. There was no answer of course. These mares will be the first on the truck to be shipped to slaughter if that is what Congress decides.\n\nAll of these mares have a story. They all had lives with their families – their stallion, their sisters, their offspring, and they had a wonderful home, on our public lands, wild and free. What do they have now? Only food and water, and no shelter, no hope. I have still not been able to visit the over 1200 wild horses that were sent directly to the private Feed Lot at Axtell Utah – mostly stallions and some mares. A handful were offered at online adoption. What will happen to the rest? I will not forget them.\n\nVideo Courtesy of Skydog Ranch Sanctuary, http://www.skydogranch.org/\n\nhttp://www.skydogranch.org/goliath-and-red-lady/\n\nWhat you can do to help:\n\nRight now the Senate is considering the BLM’s cruel, devastating and ruinous plan to sterilize wild horse herds, kill wild horses in holding and ship wild horses overseas.
