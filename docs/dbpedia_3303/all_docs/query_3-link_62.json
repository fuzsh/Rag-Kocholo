        "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman says Donald Trump was \"out of line\" when he said an American-born judge isn't qualified to preside over a case because of his Mexican heritage.\n\nBoozman on Tuesday criticized the presumptive GOP presidential nominee for saying U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel cannot judge him fairly because he is of Mexican heritage and Trump plans to build a wall with Mexico. Boozman's Democratic challenger, former federal prosecutor Conner Eldridge, earlier Tuesday criticized Boozman over his support for Trump and called the comments about Curiel \"outrageous.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday claimed his remarks on Curiel have been \"misconstrued.\"\n\nEldridge faces an uphill fight to unseat Boozman in Arkansas, where Republicans control all statewide and federal offices.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
