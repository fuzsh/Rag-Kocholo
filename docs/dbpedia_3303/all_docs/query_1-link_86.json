        "text": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – – Missouri Farm Bureau’s Political Action Committee has voted to endorse Eric Schmitt for election to the United States Senate. Schmitt was supported by Missouri Farm Bureau when initially appointed to his position as Missouri’s Attorney General, and he was endorsed by the organization during his first full campaign for that position in 2020.\n\n“Attorney General Schmitt has been a staunch ally of rural Missourians at every level of public service,” said MOFB President Garrett Hawkins. “We need strong leaders to fight on behalf of Missouri’s farmers and ranchers against an activist administration, and he has already proven he is not afraid to speak up and work for us.”\n\nAttorney General Schmitt’s roots run deep in Missouri, spanning six generations of farmers, teachers and small businesspeople who have lived and worked in Tipton, Pilot Grove, Louisiana and St. Louis. As a state senator and as Missouri state treasurer, Schmitt helped modernize the Missouri Linked Deposit Program and relaunch it as Missouri FIRST, which made a tangible, positive impact on the state’s rural communities.\n\nAs Missouri’s attorney general, he stood up for rural communities and farmers and ranchers by fighting federal government overreach of greenhouse gas emissions as well as tackling the opioid crisis through the Real Opioid Plan initiative. He fought against California’s Prop 12 regulation which tries to tell Missourians how they have to farm and sued the Biden administration to stop its Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule. When speaking with Missouri Farm Bureau leaders regarding the Senate race, Schmitt pledged to fight back against the Biden administration’s regulatory overreach affecting farmers, small businesses and rural communities.\n\nSchmitt faces opponents from the Democratic, Libertarian and Constitutional Parties in the November 8 general election. Missouri Farm Bureau’s grassroots members will advocate strongly for his election over the next two months to ensure he prevails and continues our state’s tradition of strong leadership in the United States Senate.\n\nAbout Missouri Farm Bureau"
