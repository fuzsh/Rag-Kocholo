        "text": "Alabama\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: Richard Shelby (R)\n\n4th term (68 percent)\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nShelby has a $17 million war chest, has no real Democratic opposition to speak of\n\nand is running in one of the most GOP-friendly political environments in recent\n\nmemory.\n\nHe will cruise to a fifth term.\n\nHouse\n\n2nd district\n\nIncumbent: Bobby Bright (D)\n\n1st term (50 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nBrightâ€™s 2008 race was decided by fewer than 2,000 votes, and his first\n\nre-election may come down to the wire as well.\n\nAlthough Montgomery City Councilwoman Martha Roby was an early recruit of the\n\nnational party, she has proved to be somewhat green on the campaign trail and\n\nstruggled a bit with a feisty tea-party-backed primary challenge. But sheâ€™s a solid\n\nconservative, and that may be enough in this cycleâ€™s environment.\n\nBright boasts one of the most conservative voting records in the Democratic\n\nCaucus, but Republicans think his first vote, which was to elect Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n\n(D-Calif.) as Speaker, will be enough to sink his re-election chances. In fact, in\n\nthis conservative southwest Alabama district, Republicans seem intent on making the\n\ncontest as much about Pelosi as about Bright.\n\nWhen the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched its first ads\n\nagainst Roby in September, Robyâ€™s camp quickly sent out a press release titled\n\n“Pelosi and Bright Launch False Negative Attacks.”\n\nBright, who grew up in the Wiregrass region of the district and served as mayor of\n\nMontgomery, is hoping his personal connections throughout the region will help keep\n\nRepublicans from nationalizing the contest. He has worked to distance himself from\n\nPelosi and downplay her importance (he recently called her position a “largely\n\nceremonial” one).\n\nBright and the DCCC are trying to draw as many distinctions between Roby and the\n\nCongressman as they can and have attacked her for everything from wanting to\n\nprivatize Medicare to being in the pocket of special interests.\n\n5th district\n\nOpen seat: Parker Griffith (R) was defeated in a primary\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nMadison County Commissioner Mo Brooks is heavily favored to become the next\n\nCongressman after he soundly defeated the party-switching Griffith in the Republican\n\nprimary.\n\nIn a better environment, Democrats might be tempted to compete in the northern\n\nAlabama district, where conservative Democrats have shown they can win.\n\nThis year, party officials will be too busy playing defense elsewhere around the\n\ncountry to make a serious effort here. And that makes an already steep road even\n\nsteeper for political consultant Steve Raby, the Democratic nominee.\n\n7th district\n\nOpen seat: Artur Davis (D) lost a gubernatorial primary\n\nOutlook: Safe Democratic\n\nAfter winning a primary runoff against Jefferson County Commissioner Shelia Smoot\n\nin July, attorney Terri Sewell (D) is poised to become the first black woman ever\n\nelected to Congress in Alabama.\n\nDespite a tough national environment for Democrats, Sewell wonâ€™t have any trouble\n\nwinning in this majority-black Birmingham- and Tuscaloosa-based district, where\n\nPresident Barack Obama got 71 percent of the vote in 2008.\n\nArkansas\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: Blanche Lincoln (D)\n\n2nd term (56 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Republican\n\nIn a testament to just how steep Lincolnâ€™s path to victory is this cycle, a recent\n\npoll from the Arkansas News Bureau that showed her behind by 14 points was actually\n\nthe best news the Senator has had on the polling front in months.\n\nSeveral public polls over the summer showed Rep. John Boozman (R) ahead by\n\nanywhere from 17 to 31 points.\n\nThe race will likely tighten before Nov. 2, but Lincoln may simply be too far\n\nbehind to have much hope of overtaking the Congressman.\n\nLincolnâ€™s path to victory wasnâ€™t made any easier by an expensive primary and\n\nrunoff. It was a fight that put the moderate Senator at odds with much of her\n\nDemocratic base, and it remains to be seen whether the wounds of that nasty contest\n\nhave healed enough for Democrats to come out in force this fall.\n\nLincoln is working hard to frame Boozman as part of the radical wing of his party.\n\nBut the four-term Congressman has brushed off the attacks and mostly avoided locking\n\nhorns with Lincoln, a sure sign that heâ€™s running from a position of strength. When\n\nhe has taken shots at Lincoln, it has mostly been to tie her to her more polarizing\n\nparty leaders.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton, who was a strong supporter of Lincoln in the primary,\n\nisnâ€™t done playing in the race. He continues to be a key fundraiser for Lincoln, and\n\nsheâ€™ll need all the help she can get. Thatâ€™s because it remains to be seen whether\n\nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will commit significant resources to a\n\ncontest that even some Democratic insiders admit may already be too far gone.\n\nHouse\n\n1st district\n\nOpen seat: Marion Berry (D) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nOnce viewed as a long shot for Arkansas Republicans, the 1st district has become\n\nthe stateâ€™s key battleground. Thatâ€™s because the GOP is heavily favored in all the\n\nother targeted Congressional contests.\n\nRepublicans nominated Rick Crawford, an Army veteran, farm broadcaster and\n\nbusinessman. He is untested as a candidate, and Democrats dismissed him early on. But\n\nthe National Republican Congressional Committee has touted him and the polls continue\n\nto show him running strong against former Congressional aide Chad Causey.\n\nCausey, who served as Berryâ€™s chief of staff, had an edge in the Democratic\n\nprimary in part because of the backing he received from the Congressman and from\n\nPresident Bill Clinton. Causey is well-financed and continues to earn fundraising\n\nsupport from Clinton.\n\nBut in an anti-incumbent year, Causeyâ€™s previous work for Berry has helped\n\nRepublicans frame his campaign as that of another “D.C. insider” wanting to join the\n\nclub on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocrats have hit Crawford with the commonly used attack that he wants to cut\n\nSocial Security. But they have also found campaign fodder in Crawfordâ€™s past,\n\nincluding a bankruptcy he has struggled to explain.\n\nBoth national parties have said they intend to spend money in the 1st district,\n\nand for good reason. Republicans have successfully expanded the playing field enough\n\nto possibly flip control of the House this cycle. But to do it, theyâ€™ll have to win\n\nin battleground areas like northeast Arkansas.\n\n2nd district\n\nOpen seat: Vic Snyder (D) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Likely Republican\n\nWhen Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen said\n\nthe party would be looking at the House map and make tough decisions about where to\n\ncut its losses, the Maryland lawmaker probably had this Little Rock-based district in\n\nmind.\n\nSnyder was no shoo-in for re-election in this conservative district, which is\n\ngrowing increasingly Republican. And Republicans think the prospect of a tough race\n\nagainst the highly touted and well-connected Tim Griffin (R), a former U.S. attorney,\n\nwas the main reason Snyder decided to retire.\n\nDemocrats needed a runoff before selecting state Sen. Joyce Elliott as their\n\nnominee. Elliott, who is black, has a base in Little Rock and Pulaski County, and\n\nsheâ€™s expected to perform well among black voters in a district that is 21 percent\n\nAfrican-American.\n\nBut Griffin has a cash-on-hand advantage and is expected to perform well in the\n\nRepublican-trending suburbs of Little Rock. Elliott will probably need outside cash\n\nto compete, and she isnâ€™t likely to find that coming from the Democratic\n\nCongressional Campaign Committee.\n\n3rd district\n\nOpen seat: John Boozman (R) is running for Senate\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nOf the three open House seats in Arkansas, the 3rd district is the least\n\ncompetitive. Thatâ€™s because it has long been a Republican bastion in an otherwise\n\nhistorically Democratic state.\n\nBoozman has had little trouble winning re-election in the district since taking\n\nthe seat in a 2001 special election. Democrats didnâ€™t even offer a candidate in 2008\n\ndespite a national environment that was in their favor.\n\nRogers Mayor Steve Womack is the Republican nominee and the overwhelming favorite\n\nto replace Boozman.\n\nDemocrats selected former Fayetteville Assistant City Attorney David Whitaker as\n\ntheir nominee and sacrificial offering.\n\nFlorida\n\nSenate\n\nOpen seat: Appointee George LeMieux (R) is not seeking election\n\nOutlook: Leans Republican\n\nSince being chased out of the Republican primary and deciding to run as an\n\nIndependent, Gov. Charlie Crist has made no secret that heâ€™s looking to take votes\n\nfrom both Democrats and Republicans. But it looks increasingly unlikely that he can\n\ncarve out enough votes in the center to win the three-way race against Rep. Kendrick\n\nMeek (D) and former state Speaker Marco Rubio (R).\n\nRepublicans have focused most of their attention on painting the governor as a\n\nliberal in disguise. Meek is touting himself as the only real Democrat in the race in\n\nan effort to prevent Crist from eating too far into the Democratic vote and becoming\n\nviewed as the de facto Democrat in the race.\n\nWhat appears likely is that Rubio will capture the lionâ€™s share of the Republican\n\nvote and a portion of GOP-leaning independents. Meek will get the Democratic base\n\nvote and Crist will get some middle-of-the-road and Democratic-leaning\n\nindependents.\n\nThat math adds up to a Rubio victory, which is reflected in current polls.\n\nHouse\n\n2nd district\n\nIncumbent: Allen Boyd (D)\n\n7th term (62 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nTouted as a possible Senate candidate early in the cycle, Boyd barely survived a\n\nprimary challenge and has a difficult fight to keep his seat in November.\n\nThe key issue for Republicans is the health care bill Boyd voted against in\n\nNovember but then voted for when it was brought back to the House floor this spring.\n\nBoydâ€™s decision to support the legislation came as he was working to fend off a\n\nprimary challenge from state Senate Minority Leader Al Lawson, who was running to his\n\nleft.\n\nIn the wake of his health care vote, the National Republican Congressional\n\nCommittee quickly labeled Boyd as one of the “flip-flop five” and painted him as a\n\ncloset liberal masquerading as a Blue Dog Democrat. That hasnâ€™t helped the\n\nCongressman in a district that is becoming increasingly unfriendly, even to centrist\n\nDemocrats.\n\nSince the primary, Boyd has been working to heal the wounds of his fight with\n\nLawson, refill his campaign coffers (he spent more than $2 million) and re-establish\n\nhis moderate image.\n\nRepublicans have been busy promoting Steve Southerland, a funeral home owner from\n\nBay County. Southerland is a political newcomer, but he has raised a respectable\n\namount of money. Southerland is from the western end of the district, which will help\n\nhim excite the large GOP base in the rural coastal counties.\n\nThe NRCC has already made a six-figure ad buy against Boyd, a sure sign it senses\n\nan opportunity in the Panhandle.\n\n5th district\n\nOpen seat: Ginny Brown-Waite (R) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nBrown-Waite endorsed Hernando County Sheriff Rich Nugent on the same day she\n\nannounced her retirement in late April, and he has held the inside track to follow\n\nher in Congress ever since.\n\nNugentâ€™s landslide victory in the August Republican primary made him the runaway\n\nfavorite to win the conservative west coast district, where registered Republicans\n\noutnumber registered Democrats.\n\nBesides Brown-Waite, Nugent has also received high-profile GOP endorsements from\n\nformer Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nHe faces Army veteran Jim Piccillo in November.\n\n8th district\n\nIncumbent: Alan Grayson (D)\n\n1st term (52 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nGrayson rarely misses an opportunity to stick his thumb in the eye of Republicans,\n\nand his antics have put him at the top of GOP target lists.\n\nHe riled Republicans across the country last year when he took to the House floor\n\nand described the GOP health care plan as “donâ€™t get sick,” and if you get sick, “die\n\nquickly.” He hasnâ€™t dialed back the rhetoric since.\n\nRepublicans are certain that Grayson is too far left for his district, which had\n\nlong elected Republicans before 2008. But theyâ€™ll also have to figure out a way to\n\ndeal with Graysonâ€™s vast national fundraising network, which has helped him raise\n\nabout $4 million this cycle.\n\nAfter a competitive primary, Republicans selected former state Senate Majority\n\nLeader Daniel Webster, a family values conservative who served in the Legislature for\n\nnearly three decades.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Webster is as much Graysonâ€™s opposite in style as he is in\n\npolitical outlook. Webster presents himself as the conservative, rational alternative\n\nto the liberal, fire-breathing Congressman.\n\nGrayson isnâ€™t shying away from the fight and thinks voters respect him because\n\nheâ€™s shown he has the guts to stand up for what he believes.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has already bought nearly $1\n\nmillion in airtime in the district, and itâ€™s a safe bet that it will be using some of\n\nthat time to remind voters of the Congressmanâ€™s more outrageous comments.\n\n12th district\n\nOpen seat: Adam Putnam (R) is running for state agriculture commissioner\n\nOutlook: Likely Republican\n\nPutnam wasnâ€™t expected to have much trouble if he had run for a sixth term, but\n\nhis decision to seek statewide office gave Democrats some hope in a district that\n\nwent narrowly for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 2008 and has a slight Democratic\n\nvoter registration advantage.\n\nBut as the national environment turned against Democrats, the likelihood that the\n\nnational party would play in the conservative district diminished quickly.\n\nFormer state Rep. Dennis Ross, the GOP nominee, has Putnamâ€™s endorsement, the\n\nsupport of the national party and a significant financial advantage. Democratic\n\nnominee Lori Edwards, the supervisor of elections in Polk County, has been something\n\nof a recruiting bust who has struggled on the campaign trail.\n\nEdwardsâ€™ best hope for an upset lies in the candidacy of tea party nominee Randy\n\nWilkinson, a county commissioner who Democrats hope will split the conservative vote\n\njust enough to give them a chance of stealing the open seat.\n\n17th district\n\nOpen seat: Kendrick Meek (D) is running for Senate\n\nOutlook: Safe Democratic\n\nState Sen. Frederica Wilson is all but certain to replace Meek in the House after\n\nsecuring the Democratic nomination in the overwhelmingly Democratic 17th\n\ndistrict.\n\nWilson, who has already followed Meek in the state House and state Senate, was\n\nconsidered the frontrunner in the Congressional race the day she entered the race\n\nlast year.\n\nShe got some competition in the primary from wealthy physician and first-time\n\ncandidate Rudy Moise, who vastly outspent her. But Wilson relied on her\n\nlong-established network in the Miami- and Hollywood-based district to cruise to a\n\ncomfortable victory. She should have an even easier time in November in the majority\n\nblack district that gave President Barack Obama 87 percent of the vote in 2008.\n\n21st district\n\nOpen seat: Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nThe Diaz-Balart brothers successfully pulled off a case of political musical\n\nchairs this year to keep the 21st district in the family.\n\nWhen Lincoln Diaz-Balart announced in February he would retire from the solidly\n\nRepublican district, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R) immediately announced he would retire\n\nfrom his more competitive 25th district to run in the 21st.\n\nThe move raised eyebrows in the political world but hasnâ€™t hurt Mario\n\nDiaz-Balartâ€™s chances in the Hialeah- and suburban Miami-based 21st district. No one\n\nfiled to run against the Congressman this fall, so heâ€™ll have the ballot to\n\nhimself.\n\n22nd district\n\nIncumbent: Ron Klein (D)\n\n2nd term (55 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nThe politically competitive 22nd district has been shifting toward Democrats since\n\n2004, but Republicans think this is the year to reverse the trend. To do it, theyâ€™ve\n\nturned again to 2008 nominee Allen West, a retired Army officer who took 45 percent\n\nagainst Klein last cycle.\n\nWest became an early champion of the tea party movement this cycle after a fiery\n\nspeech he gave last fall in which he called on voters to challenge their “tyrannical”\n\ngovernment. The speech became something of an Internet sensation and helped West earn\n\na speaking role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, as well as an\n\nendorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R). West has become one of the top\n\nfundraisers of the cycle, far outpacing the Congressman, and has been embraced as a\n\ntop recruit by the national party.\n\nDemocrats say the tea party icon is far too extreme for the district. Democrats\n\nhave also called him dangerous, pointing to an incident that helped end his military\n\ncareer in which he was charged with assault after firing a gun next to the head of a\n\ndetainee he was interrogating.\n\nThe tea party movement has proved to be a powerful force this cycle, but at this\n\npoint it doesnâ€™t appear to be strong enough in coastal Broward and Palm Beach\n\ncounties to get West over the top.\n\n24th district\n\nIncumbent: Suzanne Kosmas (D)\n\n1st term (57 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Republican\n\nTwo years after Kosmas ousted scandal-weakened Rep. Tom Feeney (R), Republicans\n\nthink itâ€™s time to take the district back.\n\nA GOP voter registration advantage plus a favorable national environment give\n\nRepublicans natural advantages in the Orlando- and Space Coast-based district. But\n\nGOP strategists also think Kosmas has been hurt by a few self-inflicted wounds. The\n\nstate and national Republican parties have made much of the fact that the\n\nCongresswoman voted for the health care bill this year after she originally voted\n\nagainst it. That move, along with Kosmasâ€™ votes for the cap-and-trade bill and the\n\nstimulus bill, have Republicans screaming that the Congresswoman is anything but the\n\nfiscal conservative she claims to be.\n\nKosmas faces state Rep. Sandy Adams, who was the somewhat surprising winner of a\n\ncompetitive three-way GOP primary. Kosmasâ€™ first ad of the cycle focused on Adamsâ€™\n\n“strange ideas” on constitutional issues and painted her as an extremist. Kosmas has\n\ndescribed Adams as Floridaâ€™s version of Delaware Republican Senate nominee and tea\n\nparty champion Christine Oâ€™Donnell.\n\nKosmasâ€™ $1 million-plus war chest will be her biggest asset this fall, but to hang\n\non sheâ€™ll likely also need help from the national party. The National Republican\n\nCongressional Committee has already laid down nearly $1 million to run ads against\n\nthe Congresswoman in the Orlando media market.\n\n25th district\n\nOpen seat: Mario Diaz-Balart (R) is running in the 21st district\n\nOutlook: Leans Republican\n\nAfter White House and national Democratic officials persuaded 2008 nominee Joe\n\nGarcia to take another run in this district, they were optimistic that the sprawling\n\nSouth Florida seat represented one of the partyâ€™s rare takeover opportunities.\n\nFavorable voter registration trends have made the district nearly evenly split\n\nbetween Democrats and Republicans two years after Garcia took 47 percent against\n\nDiaz-Balart.\n\nBut Republicans have a much more favorable environment this year and state Rep.\n\nDavid Rivera has proved to be a formidable recruit who has raised serious money and\n\nearned the full support of the Diaz-Balart dynasty and the National Republican\n\nCongressional Committee.\n\nThe campaign hasnâ€™t lacked for personal attacks.\n\nDemocrats have questioned Riveraâ€™s fitness for office by highlighting a bizarre\n\ntraffic accident from 2002, in which a car Rivera was driving collided with a\n\ndelivery truck that was carrying the ads of a political opponent. Democrats have also\n\ntried to tie Rivera to a 16-year-old domestic violence case.\n\nRivera, who champions taking a hard line against the Cuban government, has called\n\nGarcia an apologist and “henchman” for RaÃºl and Fidel Castroâ€™s communist regime.\n\nRepublicans think Garciaâ€™s work for the Obama administration will help them paint him\n\nas a Washington insider.\n\nThis race bears watching in the campaignâ€™s final weeks. Democrats say theyâ€™re\n\noptimistic, but the climate might make this pickup too tough.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: Johnny Isakson (R)\n\n1st term (58 percent)\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nState Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond, one of only two Democrats who hold\n\nstatewide office, garnered some excitement when he decided to run. But momentum never\n\ndeveloped, and itâ€™s hard to see a path to victory for the Democrat in a\n\nRepublican-leaning state in a GOP-friendly year.\n\nIsakson, who had some health problems in the spring but now is doing well, holds a\n\nsteep financial advantage over Thurmond, and the state labor commissioner wonâ€™t get\n\nany help from the national party to even the playing field.\n\nThurmond would need a lot of breaks to turn this into a contest. Isakson shouldnâ€™t\n\nhave a tough time winning a second term as long as he isnâ€™t sidelined by further\n\nhealth issues.\n\nHouse\n\n2nd district\n\nIncumbent: Sanford Bishop (D)\n\n9th term (69 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nThis has been one of the late-developing races of the cycle. Republicans targeted\n\nBishop in the past before a mid-decade redistricting made his seat more secure. But\n\ntime and a favorable national environment have moved Bishopâ€™s seat back into\n\nplay.\n\nBishop is a Blue Dog Coalition member and he holds one of the most conservative\n\nvoting records in the Congressional Black Caucus. But state Rep. Mike Keown (R)\n\nargues that Bishop has lost his independence under a Congress lead by Speaker Nancy\n\nPelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nRecently, Republicans have focused on reports that Bishop steered thousands of\n\ndollars in CBC scholarships to family members.\n\nThe rapidly increasing interest in the race from national GOP operatives means\n\nRepublicans see a real chance in the 2nd district. The Democratic-leaning southwest\n\nGeorgia district is also a cheap seat to play in for the national party.\n\nA key for Bishop will be to get black voters, who make up nearly 48 percent of the\n\npopulation, to come out this cycle. The black population helped give President Barack\n\nObama a 9-point margin of victory in the district in 2008.\n\n7th district\n\nOpen seat: John Linder (R) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nLinderâ€™s endorsement helped his former chief of staff, Rob Woodall, emerge from a\n\ncrowded primary and runoff to secure the GOP nomination. Woodall is now the\n\nunquestioned frontrunner to replace his old boss in the solidly Republican suburban\n\nAtlanta district.\n\nDemocrats have once again nominated Iraq War veteran Doug Heckman. Heckman took\n\njust 38 percent last cycle in a much more favorable environment for Democrats. With\n\nno help on the way from the national party and a much tougher environment, Heckman is\n\nnot expected to do much better in this yearâ€™s open-seat contest.\n\n8th district\n\nIncumbent: Jim Marshall (D)\n\n4th term (57 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly targeted Marshallâ€™s conservative district over the\n\nyears, but they think theyâ€™ve finally found the right candidate and the right\n\nenvironment to knock him off.\n\nState Rep. Austin Scott (R), who was elected to the Georgia House in 1997, decided\n\nlate in the cycle to drop his gubernatorial ambitions and challenge Marshall. He has\n\nused his connections around the state to quickly raise money.\n\nAs heâ€™s done in the past, Marshall is touting the fact that he has one of the most\n\nconservative voting records in the Democratic Caucus.\n\nBut Scott thinks a pair of high-profile votes will be the Blue Dog Democratâ€™s\n\nundoing.\n\nMarshall voted for the stimulus program, which Republicans have cast as one of the\n\nmost fiscally irresponsible bills in recent history. Scott also highlights Marshallâ€™s\n\nfirst vote this Congress, which was to elect Rep. Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. As one\n\nmight expect in the Ceep South, the liberal California Democrat is not popular in\n\nMarshallâ€™s middle-Georgia district.\n\nMarshall has worked to show his independence and recently joined Republicans in\n\ncalling for an extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire at the\n\nend of the year.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released polling in September that\n\nshowed Marshall up by double digits. But itâ€™s hard to believe those numbers wonâ€™t\n\nclose by November â€” if they havenâ€™t already.\n\nKentucky\n\nSenate\n\nOpen seat: Jim Bunning (R) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Leans Republican\n\nEye surgeon Rand Paul, the son of Texas Rep. Ron Paul (R), continues to ride the\n\ntea party wave that helped him earn an upset victory in the GOP primary.\n\nThe conservative nature of Kentucky and favorable environment give Republicans\n\ninherent advantages this cycle, and most public polling gives him the edge over\n\nAttorney General Jack Conway (D).\n\nBut the race bears watching as Paulâ€™s propensity for making controversial\n\nstatements could still cause a late shift.\n\nConwayâ€™s first negative ad focused on a comment Paul made, in which he indicated\n\nthat nonviolent crimes shouldnâ€™t be against the law. Conway pounced on the comment as\n\na way to show that Paul is out of touch with Kentucky voters. Paulâ€™s primary opponent\n\nwas unsuccessful in his attempt to tag the tea party candidate as a man with “strange\n\nideas,” but Democrats think they can make that case in the general election. Theyâ€™ve\n\nalready attacked him for questioning the governmentâ€™s role in the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964 and for describing drug use as not being a pressing issue in Kentucky.\n\nBoth national committees have signaled their intentions to play in Kentucky. The\n\nrace is likely to come down to whether voters think Paul is too extreme or whether\n\nthey think Conway will be rubber stamp for his national party leadership in\n\nWashington.\n\nHouse\n\n3rd district\n\nIncumbent: John Yarmuth (D)\n\n2nd term (59 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nWith the national environment tipping decidedly in their favor, Republicans were\n\nkeen about putting this Louisville-based district in play. But the wind was taken out\n\nof their sails when their preferred candidate, businessman Jeff Reetz, was upset by\n\ntea-party-backed commercial pilot Todd Lally in the primary.\n\nSince then, the NRCC has made the more conservative Lexington-based 6th district\n\nthe focus of its efforts in the Bluegrass State.\n\nLally has put significant personal resources into the contest and having tea party\n\nchampion and Senate candidate Rand Paul (R) at the top of the ticket should help in\n\nthe general election. But unless a very large GOP wave develops on Election Day,\n\nYarmuth should be able to hang on. A recent independent poll by a Kentucky news and\n\npolitical website put Yarmuth up by 23 points.\n\n6th district\n\nIncumbent: Ben Chandler (D)\n\n3rd full term (65 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nLike many Democratic incumbents in conservative districts, Chandler has worked to\n\ntout the times he stood up to his own party this cycle. He is quick to cite his vote\n\nagainst the health care bill and the Wall Street bailout bill.\n\nHis opponent, lawyer Andy Barr (R), has focused on the high-profile votes where\n\nChandler fell in line with his partyâ€™s leadership, including the cap-and-trade bill\n\nthat is viewed by Kentuckyâ€™s powerful coal industry as a direct attack on their\n\nlivelihood.\n\nChandler has deep roots in the district and a hefty campaign war chest, but the\n\nX-factor in the race may be the energy and coal companies that have already signaled\n\ntheir willingness to use their deep pockets to bring down the Congressman.\n\nIn a cheap media market such as Lexington, those groups could even the financial\n\nplaying field for Barr and create major problems for Chandler â€” but theyâ€™ll need to\n\nengage soon.\n\nLouisiana\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: David Vitter (R)\n\n1st term (51 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Republican\n\nRep. Charlie Melancon, the lone Democratic member of the stateâ€™s House delegation,\n\nwas probably the best recruit his party could get to take on Vitter. But it may not\n\nmatter in the current political environment and in a state that has trended\n\nincreasingly Republican in recent years.\n\nDemocrats have done everything they can to make the campaign about Vitterâ€™s\n\npersonal life and have focused on tarnishing his image among women. But the Senator\n\nis betting pocketbook issues will be the bigger concern for Louisiana voters this\n\ncycle.\n\nHe has cast himself as a staunch conservative who will stand up to the Obama\n\nadministration and Democrats in Congress. He points to Melanconâ€™s vote for the\n\nstimulus bill as reckless and a sign that the Congressman wonâ€™t rein in Washington\n\nspending.\n\nMelancon has turned his attention to tax cuts and portrayed Vitter as someone who\n\nwants to protect the wealthy. Itâ€™s a similar theme to one Democrats pushed over the\n\nsummer, when they argued the Senator wanted to protect oil interests during the\n\nenvironmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEvery public poll shows Vitter up by double digits, and even a Democratic\n\nSenatorial Campaign Committee poll from mid-September showed the Senator ahead by 10\n\npoints. To make matters worse for Democrats, Vitterâ€™s campaign war chest is more than\n\ndouble the size of Melanconâ€™s.\n\nHouse\n\n2nd district\n\nIncumbent: Anh “Joseph” Cao (R)\n\n1st term (50 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nCaoâ€™s New Orleans-based district continues to be Democratsâ€™ top takeover target\n\nthis fall.\n\nThe first Vietnamese-American Member of Congress won the district by fewer than\n\n2,000 votes against scandal-plagued Rep. William Jefferson (D) in an unusual December\n\ngeneral election that saw extremely low turnout. But Democrats expect that the\n\nmajority black district that gave President Barack Obama 75 percent of the vote in\n\n2008 will revert back to their column this cycle.\n\nWhile Cao has worked to portray himself as an independent who looks out for the\n\ninterests of New Orleans over his party, Democrats point out that Cao has voted with\n\nRepublicans more than 80 percent of the time and has tried to block Democratic\n\npriorities, including the stimulus and health care bills.\n\nCao faces state Rep. Cedric Richmond. Richmond has received several endorsements\n\nfrom top state and national Democratic party leaders, but none more important than\n\nObamaâ€™s, which came in September. Obamaâ€™s decision to step into the race is\n\nparticularly important because Cao has tried to cultivate the image that he has a\n\ngood working relationship with the White House.\n\nRecent polling from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed\n\nRichmond with a double-digit lead.\n\n3rd district\n\nOpen seat: Charlie Melancon (D) is running for Senate\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nDemocrats would have had a good shot at holding this district if Melancon hadnâ€™t\n\nleft to run statewide.\n\nBut Melanconâ€™s success in the district was a bit of a partisan anomaly unlikely to\n\ntransfer to attorney Ravi Sangisetty (D). While Melancon did not even draw a\n\nRepublican opponent in 2008, GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) took\n\n61 percent of the 3rd districtâ€™s votes.\n\nRepublicans have yet to settle on their nominee. Their late-August primary ended\n\nwithout a clear winner, although state Senate candidate Jeff Landry came very close\n\nto topping the 50 percent threshold. He was heavily favored to finish the job against\n\nHunt Downer, a former state Speaker, in the GOP runoff Saturday.\n\nMississippi\n\nHouse\n\n1st district\n\nIncumbent: Travis Childers (D)\n\n1st full term (54 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nAfter an upset special-election victory in early 2008, Childers won a full term\n\nthat fall by running 17 points ahead of President Barack Obama. But this November\n\nthere wonâ€™t be any other races at the top of the ballot to help drive Democratic\n\nturnout, and the national political environment wonâ€™t help the Congressman against\n\nstate Sen. Alan Nunnelee (R).\n\nIn this mostly rural district deep in the heart of Dixie, the Congressional race\n\nwill likely come down to which candidate can out-conservative the other.\n\nWith his membership in the Blue Dog Coalition and his opposition to abortion,\n\nsame-sex marriage and gun control, itâ€™s hard to get much further to the right than\n\nChilders. But Republicans think they can tie him to his partyâ€™s liberal leaders and\n\nknock him out with his vote for the stimulus bill.\n\nDemocrats say theyâ€™ve found a weakness in Nunneleeâ€™s conservative credentials on\n\nthe issue of taxes. Theyâ€™ve hit him for several votes on tax bills he made during his\n\ntenure in the state Legislature and have worked to tie him to the FairTax proposal\n\nthat would replace federal income taxes with a national sales tax.\n\nPolling from the contest has produced mixed results, which likely means this race\n\nwill go down to the wire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: Richard Burr (R)\n\n1st term (52 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Republican\n\nBurr may well be the luckiest Senator running for re-election this cycle. Thatâ€™s\n\nbecause the national political environment has made it increasingly difficult for\n\nDemocrats to take advantage of his upside-down approval rating in the Tar Heel State.\n\nThereâ€™s also the fact that Democrats had substantial recruiting problems in North\n\nCarolina and then failed to get their chosen candidate through the primary.\n\nDemocrats wound up with state Secretary of State Elaine Marshall. Marshall has\n\nname identification stemming from her four terms in statewide office, but her biggest\n\nproblem continues to be fundraising, especially when Burr has a $6 million-plus war\n\nchest.\n\nIn another cycle, national Democrats might be able to devote more resources to\n\nknocking off Burr. But theyâ€™re so busy playing defense this year that Marshall may be\n\nleft trying to do it mostly on her own.\n\nHouse\n\n7th district\n\nIncumbent: Mike McIntyre (D)\n\n7th term (69 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nThis race wasnâ€™t on anyoneâ€™s radar screens for most of the cycle, but the national\n\nRepublicans have been increasingly optimistic about putting the slightly\n\nRepublican-leaning downstate district in play. The National Republican Congressional\n\nCommittee demonstrated its interest in mid-September with a six-figure ad buy. The\n\nNRCC clearly thinks it can paint the seven-term Congressman as having “gone\n\nWashington.” The committeeâ€™s 30-second ad, which asked “who does Mike McIntyre work\n\nfor?” mentioned Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) three times and featured three\n\ndifferent pictures of her.\n\nThe Congressman seems concerned about his re-election prospects and has gone on\n\nthe attack against his Republican challenger, former Marine Ilario Pantano. McIntyre,\n\na native son of the Tar Heel State, has hit Pantano for not understanding the\n\ndistrict because he moved to North Carolina from New York several years ago and\n\npreviously worked for the financial giant Goldman Sachs. Democratic operatives say\n\nPantano is unfit for office, pointing to the capital murder charges he was brought up\n\non during his service as a Marine. (He was cleared after a military\n\ninvestigation.)\n\nMcIntyre has a hefty war chest and plenty of connections built over his 14 years\n\nin Congress, so itâ€™s probably going to take continued NRCC spending to really put the\n\n7th district in play. But if a large enough Republican wave develops, McIntyre could\n\nbe one of the surprise incumbents to get washed away this fall.\n\n8th district\n\nIncumbent: Larry Kissell (D)\n\n1st term (55 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nKissell is a first-term Democrat with weak fundraising in a politically\n\ncompetitive district, so itâ€™s no surprise heâ€™s a top target for Republicans in North\n\nCarolina.\n\nHis GOP challenger is former Charlotte-area sportscaster Harold Johnson, who moved\n\ninto the 8th district last year to challenge the Congressman. Johnsonâ€™s fundraising\n\nhasnâ€™t been overly impressive, and he still has room to grow as a candidate. But his\n\nbiggest strength is already clear: Heâ€™s not a Democrat. And in such a\n\nRepublican-friendly environment, that may be enough to knock off Kissell in this\n\nbattleground district anchored by Charlotte and Fayetteville.\n\nKissell has worked hard to highlight the times when heâ€™s bucked his party and\n\nmakes sure to include plenty of criticism about government overreach when heâ€™s on the\n\ncampaign trail.\n\nJohnson and national GOP strategists think they still have time to drive a wedge\n\nbetween Kissell and sympathetic conservative voters in his district.\n\nIn the end, Johnsonâ€™s chances may depend on how much national Republicans are\n\nwilling to invest in the relatively expensive Charlotte media market.\n\n11th district\n\nIncumbent: Heath Shuler (D)\n\n2nd term (62 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nOf the three North Carolina House districts that national Republicans have talked\n\nabout targeting this cycle, the 11th has gotten the least attention to date.\n\nStill, Shuler canâ€™t rest easy in his conservative mountain district, and heâ€™s\n\nalready gone on the attack. The Congressman has launched ads that call his Republican\n\nopponent, nonprofit founder Jeff Miller, as a champion of Social Security\n\nprivatization and of Medicare reforms that would hurt the districtâ€™s many\n\nseniors.\n\nMiller is working to depict Shuler as just another self-serving politician who has\n\nfailed to help working families during the economic downturn.\n\nMiller, who is well behind in the money chase, will likely need more help from the\n\nnational party to have a chance at knocking off Shuler.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent: Jim DeMint (R)\n\n1st term (54 percent)\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nDemocrat Alvin Greene may be one of the most unusual political stories of the 2010\n\ncycle, but that doesnâ€™t give him any more of a chance at knocking off DeMint.\n\nGreene, a 32-year-old black Army veteran, came out of nowhere to upset Vic Rawl to\n\nwin the Democratic nomination in June.\n\nBut Greene, who is unemployed and lives with his father, is more of a political\n\ncuriosity than a serious candidate. His long-shot campaign wasnâ€™t helped in August\n\nwhen he was indicted on a felony charge of showing pornography to a teenage student\n\nin a South Carolina college computer lab in 2009.\n\nWith millions in the bank, a favorable political environment and a growing\n\nnational reputation as a conservative champion, DeMint has little to fear this\n\nfall.\n\nHouse\n\n1st district\n\nOpen seat: Henry Brown (R) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nState Rep. Tim Scott appears well on his way to becoming the first black\n\nRepublican to serve in Congress since former Rep. J.C. Watts (Okla.) left in\n\n2002.\n\nScott dropped his bid for lieutenant governor earlier this year and became the\n\nfavorite of national party figures and outside conservative groups. He won a nine-way\n\nprimary that included the son of legendary GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond and the son of\n\nformer Gov. Carroll Campbell, then won the June runoff.\n\nScottâ€™s general election race against Democrat Ben Frasier, a former Congressional\n\naide and frequent candidate, is little more than a formality in this conservative\n\ndistrict.\n\n3rd district\n\nOpen seat: Gresham Barrett (R) lost a gubernatorial primary\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nState Rep. Jeff Duncan needed a runoff to secure the GOP nomination in the 3rd\n\ndistrict after an unexpectedly strong challenge by businessman Richard Cash.\n\nBut Duncan should cruise to victory in November now that heâ€™s the GOP nominee. The\n\ndistrict is a conservative stronghold that votes solidly Republican in state and\n\nfederal elections. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) won the district by nearly 30 points in\n\nthe 2008 presidential contest.\n\n4th district\n\nOpen seat: Bob Inglis (R) was defeated in a primary\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nSpartanburg County Solicitor Trey Gowdy capitalized on the national\n\nanti-establishment mood in June to knock off Inglis in the GOP primary.\n\nGowdyâ€™s victory in the Spartanburg- and Greenville-based district was built on his\n\nability to paint Inglis as a Washington insider who had strayed from his conservative\n\nvalues and become too moderate during his time in Congress. He was also helped by a\n\nstrong fundraising effort that never allowed the Congressman to build an overwhelming\n\nfinancial advantage.\n\nGowdy will now coast to victory in the overwhelmingly Republican district that is\n\nhome to the conservative Bob Jones University.\n\n5th district\n\nIncumbent: John Spratt (D)\n\n14th term (62 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nUnlike some of his fellow Democrats in conservative districts, Spratt canâ€™t\n\nplausibly run away from the partyâ€™s agenda this fall or try to portray himself as a\n\nWashington outsider. As House Budget chairman, Spratt is one of of the top\n\nlieutenants for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nBut Spratt is hoping that voters will remember the many projects he has helped\n\nbring to the district during his long tenure in Congress, as well as a constituent\n\nservice program that has won praise even in Republican circles.\n\nFor GOP nominee Mick Mulvaney, the narrative of the 5th district contest is how a\n\nlikable, old-line Southern Democrat from a mostly rural and conservative district\n\nlost his way and became a rubber stamp for a radically liberal agenda pursued by\n\nPresident Barack Obama and party leaders.\n\nMulvaney points out that Spratt was a “yes” vote for the three most controversial\n\npieces of legislation the House has considered this Congress: the stimulus,\n\ncap-and-trade and health care. And though Spratt is often celebrated for his efforts\n\nto produce a balanced budget in the late 1990s, Republicans have hit him this cycle\n\nfor his failure to produce a budget resolution. Mulvaney thinks the move is a\n\ndeliberate attempt by Spratt to help hide the ballooning spending and deficits.\n\nThe committees of the national parties are expected to invest heavily in the\n\nupstate district and, with Sprattâ€™s leadership connections, the race has become a\n\nsubject of national interest this cycle.\n\nTennessee\n\nHouse\n\n3rd district\n\nOpen seat: Zach Wamp (R) lost a gubernatorial primary\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nThe race to replace Wamp was pretty well decided in the GOP primary in August in\n\nthis safely Republican Chattanooga-based district.\n\nWell-funded lawyer Chuck Fleischmann narrowly defeated well-connected former state\n\nGOP Chairwoman Robin Smith in an intensely personal and negative contest.\n\nFleischmannâ€™s biggest endorsement came from former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\n\n(R), but his biggest campaign contributor was himself. He loaned his campaign about\n\n$700,000 during the primary.\n\nFleischmann faces attorney John Wolfe (D) in a race that national Democrats are\n\nnot targeting this fall.\n\n4th district\n\nIncumbent: Lincoln Davis (D)\n\n4th term (59 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nIn such a Republican-friendly environment, Democrats are wary their hold on the\n\nmiddle Tennessee 4th district could slip away late in the campaign.\n\nDavis has been a relatively weak fundraiser for an incumbent, and GOP strategists\n\nsay his vote for the controversial stimulus bill has given Republicans a key campaign\n\nissue to tie the Congressman to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nBut Davis has worked hard in his four terms to cultivate the image that heâ€™s a\n\ncentrist who has stuck to his socially conservative roots. The Blue Dog Democrat has\n\nearned endorsements from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association\n\nand the National Right to Life in this cycle.\n\nHis Republican challenger, physician Scott DesJarlais, isnâ€™t a top-flight recruit\n\nand hasnâ€™t raised much cash. Democrats have already made an issue of some of the more\n\nshocking details of DesJarlaisâ€™ nasty divorce proceedings from 2000 and 2001.\n\nDavis continues to be favored, but heâ€™ll need to work hard to hang on if a large\n\nRepublican wave hits on Election Day.\n\n6th district\n\nOpen seat: Bart Gordon (D) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Safe Republican\n\nAfter Gordon unexpectedly announced his retirement plans in mid-December,\n\nDemocrats expressed confidence the party would hold the Republican-trending middle\n\nTennessee district.\n\nBut recruitment efforts never panned out, and Democrats were left with\n\nlittle-known political newcomer Brett Carter, who will simply be outgunned by state\n\nSen. Diane Black (R) in November.\n\nNational Democratic strategists acknowledge the seat is gone and wonâ€™t waste their\n\nresources trying to hold it.\n\n8th district\n\nOpen seat: John Tanner (D) is retiring\n\nOutlook: Leans Republican\n\nFor a race that features a professional gospel singer and an ex-minister, the\n\nbattle for the 8th district has gotten pretty nasty.\n\nRepublican Stephen Fincher, a farmer who also tours with his family singing group,\n\nemerged from one of the most expensive primaries this cycle in the rural western\n\nTennessee district that Tanner has held for more than two decades.\n\nFincher is a first-time candidate who quickly became a darling of national\n\nRepublican recruiters, who think heâ€™s the right kind of candidate for this cycleâ€™s\n\n“outsider” environment.\n\nBut immediately after the August primary, the Democratic nominee, state Sen. Roy\n\nHerron, revived a line of attack that was used against Fincher in the GOP race.\n\nHerron released a commercial that accused Fincher of violating election law by not\n\ndisclosing some of his familyâ€™s assets and liabilities on his personal disclosure\n\nform. Herron has repeatedly called Fincher “unworthy of our trust.”\n\nFincher has taken the attacks personally. He has accused Herronâ€™s camp of twisting\n\nthe truth and has refused to debate Herron unless he takes down his commercials and\n\napologizes for them. Democrats say Fincherâ€™s refusal to debate is evidence that heâ€™s\n\nhiding something, and theyâ€™ve dragged the issue out for more than five weeks. Tanner\n\nhas gotten involved and has called on Fincher to “come clean” on the source of one of\n\nhis loans.\n\nRepublicans are trying to change the storyline of the race and talk about how\n\nHerron would empower Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) if he gets to Washington,\n\nD.C.\n\nSeveral conservative third-party groups have also gotten involved in the race on\n\nFincherâ€™s behalf. But the well-funded Herron has done a good job of staying on\n\noffense in a conservative seat that will be a tough one for Democrats to hold in such\n\na Republican-friendly year.\n\nVirginia\n\nHouse\n\n2nd district\n\nIncumbent: Glenn Nye (D)\n\n1st term (52 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nAfter losing this military-heavy district in the Democratic wave of 2008,\n\nRepublicans are keen on putting it back in their column. But itâ€™s difficult for\n\nRepublicans to portray Nye as in lock step with party leaders because his voting\n\nrecord is among the most conservative in the Democratic Caucus.\n\nRepublicans are hitting Nye for his vote for the stimulus bill. But that line of\n\nattack is complicated since car dealer Scott Rigellâ€™s dealership sold more than 100\n\ncars under the Cash for Clunkers program that was largely funded by the stimulus.\n\nRigellâ€™s combination of solid fundraising and personal wealth (heâ€™s put about $1\n\nmillion of his own money into the race) assures that the Republican will have all the\n\nresources he needs.\n\nNye, a proven fundraiser during his first term, is emphasizing his record of\n\ntending to the concerns of military personnel, veterans and their families as a\n\nmember of the Armed Services Committee.\n\nAnother plus for the Congressman is the presence on the November ballot of another\n\nRepublican, Kenny Golden, the former chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia\n\nBeach. Golden is running as an Independent after leaving the party earlier this\n\nsummer because he felt the primary had been stacked by party leaders to elect Rigell.\n\nGolden has the potential to siphon some votes from Rigell, which could be significant\n\nin a race as tight as this one is expected to be.\n\n5th district\n\nIncumbent: Tom Perriello (D)\n\n1st term (50 percent)\n\nOutlook: Tossup\n\nPerriello is one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country. His votes in\n\nfavor of the stimulus, cap-and-trade and health care bills endeared him to base\n\nvoters and helped him raise ample campaign funds. But the votes stirred up\n\nsignificant GOP opposition and are a key reason he may not be back for a second term\n\nrepresenting south and central Virginia.\n\nPerriello faces GOP state Sen. Robert Hurt and Independent tea party candidate\n\nJeff Clark on the November ballot. But even with Clark in the race, most polling\n\nshows Perriello to be highly vulnerable.\n\nPerriello has been working the district hard, dropping numerous ads, and his\n\nfundraising remains strong. To catch up, Hurt will need a lot of help from the party,\n\nwhich is already coming. By late September, the National Republican Congressional\n\nCommittee had already dropped $250,000 on the race.\n\n9th district\n\nIncumbent: Rick Boucher (D)\n\n14th term (97 percent)\n\nOutlook: Leans Democratic\n\nRepublicans expect that Morgan Griffith, the Majority Leader of the state House,\n\nwill give Boucher the closest race of his career.\n\nThe GOPâ€™s main line of attack is that Boucher supported the cap-and-trade bill.\n\nThey say the measure will hobble the many families and businesses that rely on the\n\ncoal industry in southwestern Virginia. Boucher, a senior member of the powerful\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee, says he helped secure important provisions for coal.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Congressman focuses on his long record of economic\n\ndevelopment that helped endear him to 9th district voters for many years.\n\nBoucher is well-known and well-funded, but Griffith is already getting help\n\nleveling the financial playing field from both the national party and conservative\n\nthird-party groups. The NRCC had poured nearly $200,000 into the district by late\n\nSeptember, while Americans for Job Security had dumped more than $350,000 into the\n\nrace.\n\nSince the results in the commonwealth will be known relatively early on election\n\nnight, it will be a good indicator that the Democratic majority is gone if Boucher\n\ngoes down.\n\n11th district\n\nIncumbent: Gerry Connolly (D)\n\n1st term (55 percent)\n\nOutlook: Likely Democratic\n\nConnolly was presumed to be relatively safe after winning this Democratic-trending\n\nsuburban Northern Virginia district in 2008.\n\nHe faces a rematch from last cycle with businessman Keith Fimian, who lost by 12\n\npoints that year.\n\nTaxes and spending are big issues in this fiscally conservative district that is\n\none of the nationâ€™s wealthiest. Thatâ€™s why Connolly has spoken against the\n\npresidentâ€™s proposal to let Bush-era tax cuts expire for those in the highest income\n\nbrackets. Itâ€™s hard for Fimian to run on the same anti-Washington message many\n\nRepublicans are championing, seeing as a quarter of 11th district voters work for the\n\nfederal government."
