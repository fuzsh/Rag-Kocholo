        "text": "In support of all our legislative priorities, NDSS champions the Congressional Task Force on Down Syndrome, a bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators committed to educating Members of Congress and their staff about Down syndrome and advancing legislative priorities that positively affect the Down syndrome community. NDSS is proud to collaborate with the Global Down Syndrome Foundation and the National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC) in jointly supporting the work of the Task Force.\n\nTake action on this priority using our Action Alert here!\n\n118th Congress Co-Chairs\n\nCongresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R – WA) Senator Bob Casey (D – PA)\n\nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D – DC) Senator Jerry Moran (R – KS)\n\nCurrent Membership\n\nCongressman Barry Moore (R – AL) Senator Roger Marshall (R – KS)\n\nCongressman Pete Sessions (R – TX) Senator John Boozman (R – AR)\n\nCongresswoman Sharice Davids (D – KS) Senator James Risch (R – ID)\n\nCongresswoman Nikki Budzinski (D – IL) Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R – WV)\n\nCongressman Anthony D’Esposito (R – NY) Senator Raphael Warnock (D – GA)\n\nCongressman Jake Auchincloss (D – MA) Senator Jon Ossof (D - GA\n\nCongressman John Rutherford (R – FL)\n\nCongressman Alex Mooney (R – WV)\n\nCongressman Jake LaTurner (R – KS)\n\nCongressman Andrew Garbarino (R – NY)\n\nOrgan Transplant Discrimination Toolkit\n\nNDSS supports the Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act (H.R. 2706/S. 1183). The bill is named after Charlotte Woodward, an advocate with Down syndrome and member of the NDSS staff who received a life-saving heart transplant a decade ago. Since then, she has advocated tirelessly to ensure others with Down syndrome and other disabilities have the same access to life-saving care that she did. NDSS supports this legislation because it would prevent discrimination based solely on disability in the organ transplantation process and provides additional legal recourse to people with Down syndrome and other disabilities should they experience discrimination.\n\nUntil a federal law is passed, NDSS will continue to work to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in organ transplantation at the state level. Currently, 40 states have laws in place that prohibit this discrimination:\n\nAlabama(2023)\n\nArizona (2022)\n\nArkansas (2021)\n\nCalifornia (1996)\n\nColorado (2021)\n\nDelaware (2017)\n\nFlorida (2020)\n\nGeorgia (2021)\n\nIllinois (2021)\n\nIndiana (2019)\n\nIowa (2020)\n\nKansas (2018)\n\nKentucky (2023)\n\nLouisiana (2019)\n\nMaryland (2015)\n\nMassachusetts (2016)\n\nMichigan (2022)\n\nMinnesota (2021)\n\nMississippi (2022)\n\nMissouri (2020)\n\nMontana (2021)\n\nNevada (2021)\n\nNew Jersey (2013)\n\nNew Mexico (2023)\n\nNorth Carolina (2021)\n\nNorth Dakota (2023)\n\nOhio (2018)\n\nOklahoma (2021)\n\nOregon (2017)\n\nPennsylvania (2018)\n\nRhode Island (2021)\n\nSouth Carolina (2022)\n\nSouth Dakota (2022)\n\nTennessee (2021)\n\nTexas (2021)\n\nVirginia (2020)\n\nWashington (2019)\n\nWest Virginia (2022)\n\nWisconsin (2021)\n\nWyoming (2021)\n\nAlzheimer's Disease Toolkit\n\nNDSS supports legislation and regulatory action that includes people with Down syndrome in efforts to research, cure, and treat Alzheimer’s disease. People with Down syndrome are uniquely situated in the Alzheimer’s landscape because they have an extra copy of chromosome 21. The 21st chromosome carries the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is strongly associated with the formation of amyloid peptides and plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. As a result, individuals with Down syndrome have an elevated lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, with the onset of symptoms coming earlier and progressing faster than in the general population.\n\nNDSS calls on Congress to improve supports for the Down syndrome community related to Alzheimer’s disease, encompassing supports for patients with Down syndrome, their caregivers, and the healthcare providers upon whom they rely for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, NDSS supports coverage determinations that ensure access to and coverage of safe and effective Alzheimer’s treatments.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Public Law 111 – 148), Congress authorized the first Congenital Heart Futures Act to support public health efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve childhood survival rates, prevent premature death and disability, and increase quality of life for the two-and-a-half million Americans living with congenital heart disease (CHD). Since its inception, these efforts have resulted in significant improvements and advancements in support for individuals with CHD. This issue is of particular importance to the Down syndrome community because approximately half of all infants born with Down syndrome have a heart condition. In the 118th Congress, NDSS supports the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2024 which would extend funding for these efforts.\n\nTake action on this priority using our Action Alert here!\n\nLearn more about Down syndrome and the heart here.\n\nNDSS is a pro-information organization, and one of our key legislative priorities is ensuring that all women and families across the country receive the most accurate, up-to-date, evidence-based information available about Down syndrome when receiving a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis.\n\nThe Prenatally & Postnatally Diagnosed Condition Act (Public Law 110-374) was enacted into federal law in 2008 to increase the readiness of accurate, up-to-date, and balanced information about Down syndrome to women and families considering prenatal testing. The federal law was not funded, and, in the absence of funding, advocates have taken up the issue with their state legislatures.\n\nNDSS supports state pro-information laws that ensure health care providers disseminate accurate and up-to-date information to anyone receiving a diagnosis of Down syndrome. The following states have passed Down syndrome information bills:\n\nDelaware(2014)\n\nFlorida (includes Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities) (2018)\n\nIdaho (2022)\n\nIllinois (2016)\n\nIndiana (2015)\n\nKentucky (2015)\n\nLouisiana (2014)\n\nMaine (2015)\n\nMaryland (2014)\n\nMassachusetts (2012)\n\nMinnesota* (includes Down syndrome and other trisomy conditions) (2015)\n\nMississippi (2021)\n\nMissouri (2007)\n\nNebraska (2016)\n\nNevada (2023)\n\nNew Jersey (2016)\n\nOhio (2015)\n\nOklahoma (2022)\n\nPennsylvania (2013)\n\nTennessee (2018)\n\nTexas (2015)\n\nUtah (2019)\n\nWashington (2016)\n\nNDSS supports ABLE improvement legislation that gives employees the option to allow their employers to contribute to their ABLE account in lieu of an employer-sponsored retirement plan. This legislation would remove a barrier to competitive integrative employment by allowing people with disabilities to save money without losing important government benefits. It also creates greater flexibility for employers striving to recruit, hire, and retain more people with disabilities.\n\nSSI Toolkit\n\nNDSS supports the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act (H.R. 5408/S. 2767) which would increase the allowable assets individuals with disabilities may possess while remaining eligible for government benefits and eliminate the marriage penalty. Currently, individuals cannot have more than $2,000 in assets without affecting their eligibility for critical government benefits. For married couples who are both SSI eligible, this limit is $3,000 combined. As a result, most individuals with IDD cannot marry without fear of losing their critical benefits. These limitations have not been changed in many years and have not increased to account for inflation or other economic factors. NDSS advocates for both increased asset limitations and elimination of the marriage penalty so that individuals with Down syndrome and other disabilities can work, save, and marry who they choose.\n\nTake action on this priority using our Action Alert here!\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (Public Law 101-476) makes available a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities that fits their individual needs. Despite the federal government’s promise to pay 40% of the extra cost of educating students under the IDEA, estimates show that the federal government covers only 14.6% of the cost. NDSS supports fully funding the IDEA at the level promised by the federal government because it would significantly increase the quality and quantity of education and related services made available to students with Down syndrome and other disabilities.\n\nTake action on this priority using our Action Alert here!\n\nNDSS supports legislation that prohibits schools that receive federal funding from secluding or physically, mechanically, or chemically restraining students except when absolutely necessary in order to protect the safety of students and staff. Additionally, we support better equipping school personnel with the training they need to effectively implement evidence-based and proactive behavior intervention strategies. Harmful seclusion and restraint practices are disproportionately used on students with disabilities. We believe that students with disabilities deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and should be protected from the risk of traumatic, dangerous, and dehumanizing procedures as a means of managing challenging behavior in school."
