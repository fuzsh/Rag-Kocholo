        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Rodney Slater, the former U.S. Transportation secretary, and Jo Luck, president and chief executive officer of Heifer International, will receive honorary degrees from the University of Arkansas at the All-University Commencement at 8:45 a.m. Saturday, May 13, in Bud Walton Arena.\n\nSlater, who is a former chairman of the Arkansas State Highway Commission, will be given an honorary doctorate of laws. Luck, who formerly served as executive director for the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism, will be given an honorary doctorate in arts and humane letters. Both are scheduled to speak to graduates during the commencement ceremony.\n\nSlater was only the third Arkansan in history to head a federal department and serve as a secretary member of a president’s cabinet when he became the 13th secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nSlater grew up in Marianna, Ark., and began working at age six, hiring himself out in the cotton fields to save money for a red Schwinn bicycle. He attended Eastern Michigan University as a scholar-athlete before returning to his home state for law school, graduating from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1980.\n\nSlater is known for his vigor, fairness and dedication to Arkansas. He served as assistant attorney general before joining then-Gov. Bill Clinton’s staff, first as executive assistant for economic and community programs and later as special assistant for community and minority affairs. He has also worked as director of governmental relations at Arkansas State University and secretary-treasurer of the Arkansas Bar Association. He was a member of the Arkansas State Highway Commission from 1987 to 1992 and served as chairman from 1992 to 1993. For the next four years, he served as administrator of the Federal Highway Commission, becoming the first African American to hold that position.\n\nAs transportation secretary, Slater transformed the Department of Transportation into a forward-thinking organization dedicated to “putting people first.” He managed 100,000 employees and a $60 billion annual budget from 1997 to 2001, and during that time he redefined transportation as more than concrete, asphalt, and steel. Under his leadership, the department became the architect of modern transportation, promoting new technologies, environmental awareness, and public safety. He received bipartisan acclaim for his visionary leadership. In fact, during his tenure, the department developed a strategic plan rated by Congress to be the best among all the federal agencies.\n\nSlater was recently one of 10 African American leaders to receive a Silas Hunt Legacy Award from the University of Arkansas. He currently lives in Washington, D.C., where he is a partner at Patton-Boggs LLP. He is married to Cassandra Wilkins, and they have a daughter, Bridgette Josette.\n\nLuck, president and CEO of Heifer International since 1992, has dedicated her career to humanitarian service. Heifer International is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Little Rock, Ark., that fights world hunger through support of micro-enterprises, community development and ecologically sound animal and agriculture techniques. Since 1944, the organization has reached out to more than 4 million families in 125 countries and 39 states. Under Luck’s leadership, Heifer has received national and international acclaim as a visionary organization committed to serving and empowering the world’s poor.\n\nLuck attended Hendrix College and pursued graduate studies at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. She was the first cabinet appointment of then-Gov. Clinton, and served as executive director of the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism for more than a decade, during which time she doubled the economic impact of the state’s tourism industry to $2 billion dollars. She was later elected to the Arkansas Tourism Industry’s Hall of Fame.\n\nLuck has long been one of Arkansas’ most active champions of social justice and environmental preservation. She was Heifer’s director of international programs before becoming president and CEO. She also helped to establish Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, as its first executive director, and was a founding member of Women Executives in State Government, the International Women’s Forum, and the Arkansas Women’s Leadership Forum.\n\nHer commitment to public service has won Luck well-deserved accolades. She was recognized by Arkansas Business magazine as one of the Top 100 Women in Arkansas for the years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. In 2001, she was one of two Arkansans chosen by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to attend the U.S. Women’s Conference Circle. In the 1980s, Luck received a Distinguished Business Leader Award from what is now called the Sam M. Walton College of Business. Recently, she was named to the National Advisory Board of the Clinton School of Public Service.\n\nShe has two children, Beth and Mark Wilson.\n\nSouth entrance doors at Walton Arena will open at 7:30 a.m., and each person attending commencement will be required to pass through a security checkpoint. Please allow extra time for this preventive measure. Cameras and personal items will be checked. Officials request that attendees not bring backpacks or baggage. These items must be left at the entrance.\n\nSeating will be in the south section above the main floor. Tickets are only required for family and friends of Senior Scholars.\n\nEach college and school will also hold its own ceremony after the All-University Commencement. The following is the schedule for those commencement ceremonies and speakers.\n\nSaturday, May 13\n\nSam M.
