        "text": "After a year and a half of preparation, planning, strategizing, and barnstorming, the Iowa Caucuses are finished. With only the Republican side being contested this cycle, it appears at the time of this writing that front-runner and nominee-presumptive Mitt Romney has come ahead with a narrow lead of 8 votes. There were will be plenty of other opportunities to talk about Mr. Romney, but I am more interested in his closest rival in Iowa, Rick Santorum. A man who was barely skirting 10% in Iowa polls a few weeks ago, Santorum enjoyed a last-minute surge of support, allowing him to come within such a small handful of votes of beating a candidate with superior name recognition, an enviable number of party endorsements, and a seemingly unlimited cash flow.\n\nI do not believe that Rick Santorum will be the Republicans’ nominee for president. He lost his last Senate campaign by 17% points, focuses on social decline in a time of economic crisis, and holds extreme anti-gay views that will turn away independent voters, and the Republican electorate will recognize this. By all rights, Santorum in 2012 should be as weak as George McGovern in the 1984 primaries— a candidate who lost his last Senate election badly, but is trying to move his party back to its soul. It is at least partly true that his last-minute rise in the polls means he is only the latest beneficiary of surges among Republican electorates who do not trust Romney, and hold Ron Paul’s social libertarianism and distrust of Israel in contempt. At various points in the last year, this elusive “not-a-romney” surge has, like Legion of old, inhabited the bodies of many– Donald Trump, Herman Cain, non-candidate Chris Christie, Rick Perry, and most recently Newt Gingrich.\n\nYet, there is something of deeper significance to be seen in the sudden rise of Rick Santorum among his colleagues in the Republican field. Consider the road of the Catholic in presidential politics. Al Smith, the first major-party nominee for the presidency in 1928 had nearly non-existent support among Protestants except perhaps in the Jim Crow South, where many Southerners would reluctantly vote for a papist over the Republican Party responsible for the indignities of Reconstruction. In 1960, John Kennedy had to address the issue head on with his famous speech before the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, and actually downplay the influence that Catholicism would have on his decision-making process. John Kerry was an extremely devout, but also extremely private Catholic. He attended mass almost daily on the campaign trail, which the press never picked up on, and which Kerry, to his credit, did not broadcast Carter-style.\n\nRick Santorum would be a very different candidate. If Smith and Kennedy were cultural “fish-fry Catholics” rather than doctrinal Catholics, and if Kerry kept his beliefs private and in the background, Santorum tries to live out his Catholicism with a fervor and focus that is much more reminiscent of the born-again evangelical Christian. (I would hasten to add, however, that Santorum’s economic policies cut against the grain of Catholicism, and this is a discrepancy that many conservative Catholics are not in a position to address convincingly. Consider for a moment the turn-of-the-century Rerum novarum, which staunchly defended the rights of the working man to a living wage and safe conditions, or the Church’s staunch opposition to the war in Iraq, or the Vatican’s support of environmentalism. In each of these cases, Santorum sides with the powerful against the weak, and in any case is not in accord with the teachings of his own church. Santorum’s Catholicism is, in its implications, as much a pick-your-own-stance “Cafeteria Catholicism” as was pro-choice, pro-marraige equality John Kerry’s.)\n\nHere is what boggles the mind– only 19% of Iowa is Catholic– close to the median among American states. By all rights, Santorum should have looked for a boost in New Hampshire, a state that is a whopping 44% Catholic. The solution to this riddle is that Santorum’s votes came heavily from evangelicals. The sweet spot for the Republican caucuses there is the state’s heavily evangelical northwestern corridor. This is the region that gave Mike Huckabee, a former evangelical pastor and a hero of social conservatives, a victory in the Iowa caucuses four years ago, and they are largely (but not wholly), the same voters that went to Rick Santorum yesterday.\n\nIt begs the question– given how Catholicism was a deal-breaker for Protestant voters of the past, how did uber-Catholic Rick Santorum come to bank upon their voters to achieve a near-victory in Iowa? Much of the answer has its roots in the 1970s. During this period, a number of conservative evangelical activists sought to broaden its base to other religious peoples– and none more so than Francis Schaeffer Sr. In short, he found ways to make unhappy mainline Protestants, Catholics, and Mormons angry about the same issues as evangelical voters- through religious television, film, church bulletins, and direct mailings. This coincided nicely with the rise of anti-abortion sentiment within the evangelical community. Evangelicals greeted 1973’s Roe vs. Wade decision with great indifference, but partly through the efforts of people like Schaeffer, Bill Bright, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell, the evangelical community constructed dissent against abortion rights by the end of the decade. Eventually, these figures worked in conversation with Mormon apostles, and Catholics like Phyllis Schlafly, whose Eagle Forum soon became common currency among Protestant voters for the first time. Aside from the abortion issue, co-belligerency succeeded at creating a litany of common grievances among these voters– secularism in schools, the threat of gay and feminist worldviews, and above all, their feeling of being beseiged within their own society. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, this term became known as “The Culture Wars,” an ongoing dialectic that set this coalition of theologically diverse voters against a common amorphous boogeyman. Some called it liberal elitism, some called it secular humanism, some called it “slouching towards Gomorrah”, but the implication was always the same– it’s “us” versus them. Co-belligerency merely created a larger, broader, and more diverse “us” than had been possible at any previous point in the 20th century.\n\nAt first, co-belligerency played out with success for evangelical candidates– consider the success of George W. Bush among “values voters”, a significant number of whom were not themselves evangelicals. What we see in Rick Santorum is the logical outcome of this strategy, one generation later. Now, the theology doesn’t seem to matter. Santorum’s Catholicism is a non-issue for “values voters”, and if Romney’s track record as a social conservative was stronger, it is likely that his Mormonism would not be an issue either. It is revealing that the three leading candidates for the Republican nomination, then, include a Catholic (Santorum), a Mormon (Romney), and someone who is technically a mainline Protestant (Ron Paul). Consider also that some second-tier candidates are also non-evangelicals, including late-in-life convert to Catholicism Newt Gingrich, and Romney’s co-religionist Jon Huntsman Jr. What began as an evangelical strategy has truly evangelized; the religious factions that were once its junior partners are now virtually in the driver’s seat.\n\nNone of this, you must keep in mind, is to suggest that evangelicals have lost influence as a force within Republican politics. Santorum’s victory was hewn through courting evangelical organizations and getting their endorsements. But now, the actual religion of the candidate is no longer quite so material, so long as their record and their rhetoric matches up.\n\nIn short, keep your eye on Rick Santorum– in the short run for throwing a monkey wrench into Romney’s hopes for an easy nomination. But also consider what his recent success as a candidate tells us about religious solidarities and identities in the long duree. Just don’t google his name.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAll-Star Senate: New England\n\nWe are starting our ranking of the top 100 senators in the northeast—historically the land of Puritans, Yankees, revolutionaries, Federalists, Whigs, abolitionists and latte-drinking visionaries. Characterized by small states, a town-hall democratic ethos, and eventually large waves of immigrants—and largely Catholic immigrants at that, these states share a common heritage that is reflected in the men and women they have sent to the Senate. These five states[i] also have long histories, and for many of them, there were some tough choices and cuts to make, if I restrict each state to exactly two senators. So, without further ado, our first edition of the All Star Senate.\n\nI. Massachusetts\n\n“ The Catalyst State” might be a more fitting name than “The Bay State” for Massachusetts. It seems that nearly every significant movement and revolution in American thought has its origins here. The cradle of the American revolution, a hotbed of antislavery (and anti-slaveholder) activism, and currently the state most associated with the modern liberal worldview, Massachusetts often pulls the rest of the country decisively in its own direction. So, I have chosen two men from Massachusetts who encapsulate specific worldviews and specific approaches to American politics.\n\n1. Daniel Webster (Anti-Jacksonian and Whig, 1827-1841, 1845-1850)\n\nWebster has a place in the Great Triumvirate of senators (along with his colleagues John Calhoun and Henry Clay.) Webster was not a saint, he accepted aid from many of Boston’s major firms and he used his gifts of persuasion in parlors and bedrooms as often as the senate floor (if you are a great orator, why not use these gifts to your advantage, right?) But Webster is most significant, I would argue, for being the first proponent of the concept of “union” as we understand it today. His famous reply to Robert Hayne, delivered on the Senate floor, is a forgotten moment in the transition of the USA from a theoretical connexion of sovereign states and into a nation in its own right. Schoolchildren would once recite his reply, and be responsible for memorizing passages. When Lincoln and others would argue that the Civil War was primarily about union, it was Webster who made such a conceptualization possible. Pro-U.S. bank, pro-tariff, pro-union and ultimately pro-compromise, Webster used his magisterial prowess as an orator to tie the interests of the nation to the interests of his home state.\n\n2. Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy (Democrat, 1962-2009):\n\nIt was said at the time of his death that Ted Kennedy had accomplished more for the average American than either of his more well-loved and well-remembered brothers. To this day, Teddy’s name is a byword for liberalism, and is used in reverence as often as it is used pejoratively. While his 45+ year tenure in the Senate is marked by personal screw-ups of the highest magnitude (Chappaquiddick, although there is strong evidence that Kennedy made every effort to save Mary Jo Kopechne even whilst intoxicated) and policy boners (No Child Left Behind), there is still much to commend, indeed, redeem Kennedy’s career as a senator.\n\nMost of the eulogies on Ted Kennedy that dominated the headlines used phrases along the lines of “Liberal Lion,” and this is, to a large extent, true. From Medicare, to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to Head Start, to most of the recent minimum wage laws, we live in a United States where poverty stings far less, and where those who are weakest cannot be taken advantage of so easily. Even so, he lobbied, without success, for many other worthy causes—universal health care (that is, providing it, not mandating that one buy it from private vendors), and an equal rights amendment remains unfinished. If the essence of 20th century liberalism is a state premised on social justice and compassion rather than ruthless self interest, Kennedy stands out as a giant among giants. He makes my list of Top 100 Senators, but he would also make the list even if I was allowed only 10.\n\nMore than this, Ted Kennedy loved the Senate and its institutions. He was a consummate deal-maker and negotiator, who also kept a tight focus on developments in his home state, keeping a formidable address book, and sending out thank you notes, condolence notes, memos, and reminders across his state. What one accomplishes in the cloakroom is just as important as what one accomplishes on the Senate floor, and on both counts, Kennedy stands out.\n\nRunners-up: No other state has furnished so many adroit and historically significant senators than Massachusetts. There are about six or seven of its sons who deserve a place in the 100 Greatest Senators of All Time. Some of the most difficult cuts included John Quincy Adams for his early work on a Federalist and nationalist viewpoint, Charles Sumner for championing abolitionism, Henry Cabot Lodge for his role as foil to the Wilson administration, and Henry Wilson, a quintessential Gilded Age politician.\n\nII. Vermont\n\nThe character of this state has changed considerably in the last 30 years; plenty of young college students went to St. Michael’s or Middlebury College, and decided to stay in the Green Mountain State. Now one of the most reliably Democratic states in national elections, Vermont was home of the thoroughgoing independent-minded Republican for much of its history. Since the formation of the Republican Party in 1854, Vermont didn’t send a Republican to the Senate until 1975, and didn’t vote for a Republican in a presidential election until Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide. If Massachusetts is an elliptical state that pushes the nation in its direction, Vermonters tend to mind their own business and conduct their own affairs as they see fit and doesn’t “proselytize” its lifestyle. With that in mind, I present…\n\n3. George Edmunds (Republican, 1866-1891)\n\nEdmunds is rarely remembered today, but he was once one of the more prominent senators of the Gilded Age, that forgotten era sprawling from the late 1860s and into 1890 or so. In a 25-year Senate career, Edmunds was a key usher of the Sherman Antitrust Act, advocated for the rights of freedmen, and oddly enough, strove to crack down on polygamy in Utah.\n\n4. George Aiken (Republican, 1941-1975)\n\nWhen I saw George McGovern speak in Burlington two summers ago at a book-signing, he took time to praise his old friend George Aiken as one of the finest men he had served with in the Senate. This short vignette demonstrates how well-regarded Aiken was among his colleagues even decades after he left. He was so beloved in his own state that he spent less than $100 in his last Senate campaign, just enough to register his campaign in Vermont. Even as late as 2006, Vermont Republicans like then-Gov. Jim Douglas could only win in the state by pledging to be an “independent-minded, George Aiken Republican.” Aiken was a forceful voice for his state’s farmers and small businessmen, an advocate of food stamps, and his anti-corporate tone contrasted to others in his party at the time. He was a Bull Moose Republican about 25 years too late, and worked in a bi-partisan fashion and forming many warm working relationships and friendships across the aisle.\n\nRunners-up: I gave serious consideration to three more recent guys—Batman-loving Pat Leahy, student-loan sponsoring Robert Stafford, and the deliciously socialist Bernie Sanders. Given enough time, Sanders may replace Edmunds in this ranking. He is the only one standing up to Wall Street excess in sufficiently strong language.\n\nIII. New Hampshire:\n\nNew Hampshire has historically been (and remains) New England’s most conservative state, the crabby tightwad uncle at New England’s Thanksgiving dinner table. Home of the New Hampshire Union Leader, for years the nation’s most influential right-leaning newspaper, it is also host to the nation’s first primary every election season. It is also a state of notorious cheapskates, New Hampshire having repeatedly welshed on interstate roads and bridges, leaving its neighbor Vermont to foot the bill. A “Live Free or Die” state, social permissiveness but economic restraint rule the day here.\n\n5. John Langdon (Pro-Administration, Anti-Administration, Democratic-Republican, 1789-1801)\n\nI wanted to be sure that my list had at least one guy from the inaugural class of senators. Given the level of top-notch revolutionary talent available at the time, this first class is an unimpressive bunch, but Langdon is probably the best of their number. Langdon stayed in his seat longer than any other member of the Senate’s first class; while most left office within the first six years, he held on for nearly two full terms. He was also the first president pro tempore of the Senate; the letter informing George Washington of his election as president thus bears his signature.\n\n6. Styles Bridges (Republican, 1937-1961)\n\nThere is no better emblem of New Hampshire’s peculiarly conservative approach than Styles Bridges. In fact, so well known was Bridges’ rancor towards the New Deal that FDR’s opponent in the 1936 election, Alf Landon, sought him out as a running mate. He was rejected, though, for fear that the Democrats would lambaste the ticket as “Landon-Bridges falling down.” Over the course of his career, Bridges opposed labor unions and anyone he suspected of being “soft on communism”, while maintaining power as the chair of the Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services Committee—ironically giving one of the Senate’s most outspoken conservatives a significant say in the distribution of federal largesse.\n\nIV. Maine\n\n“Where Maine goes, so goes the nation.” So went the popular phrase throughout much of American history, since Maine would traditionally vote for president a month or two before the rest of the country, so that early winter snowstorms would not impede voters on Election Day. It was second to Vermont as the most reliably Republican state in the nation for much of the postbellum age, never even giving its votes to FDR in any of his four presidential elections. Never forthrightly conservative, it now sends two of the last moderate Republicans, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, to the Senate every six years.\n\n7. Hannibal Hamlin (Democrat, Republican, 1848-1857, 1857-1861, 1869-1881)\n\nA rare Jacksonian state in New England at one point, Maine hopped onto the sectionalist and abolitionist bandwagon very early, changing its allegiances to the Republican Party. Nobody emblematized this change better than Hamlin, who left his party with sharp words, and began carrying a pistol with him for protection (evidently fearing physical retribution from his colleague from Mississippi, Jefferson Davis.) After serving an undistinguished term as Abraham Lincoln’s first vice-president, Hamlin eventually returned to the Senate for two terms after the war, served as Minister to Spain, and died while playing cards in a club in downtown Bangor.\n\n8. Margaret Chase Smith (Republican, 1949-1973)\n\nMargaret Chase Smith was the first significant female senator in U.S. history, but beyond this distinction, there is much to commend her career. Her finest moment, though, was her Declaration of Conscience, which castigated Joseph McCarthy, a member of her own party. Smith’s statement was one of the only genuinely prophetic acts of the 1950s Senate (prophetic in the sense of articulating moral truth, and holding a people accountable to that truth, rather than its more commonplace meaning of predicting the future.) The statement reads in part:\n\nThose of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in making character assassinations are all too frequently those who, by our own words and acts, ignore some of the basic principles of Americanism —\n\nThe right to criticize;\n\nThe right to hold unpopular beliefs;\n\nThe right to protest;\n\nThe right of independent thought.\n\nThe exercise of these rights should not cost one single American citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or livelihood merely because he happens to know some one who holds unpopular beliefs. Who of us doesn’t? Otherwise none of us could call our souls our own.\n\nRunners-Up: I really, really wanted to include Ed Muskie, whose photograph serves as my avatar for this blog. Muskie made the Democratic Party viable again in Maine during the late 1950s, and eventually became its governor and later, its senator. Muskie was chair of the formidable Budget Committee during the 1970s, and was one of the first advocates of environmentalism even before it came into vogue.\n\nV. Rhode Island\n\nA tiny little city-state, Rhode Island has been home to some of the only viable northern slave plantations, shipping magnates, and the summer homes of countless captains of industry. Since then, Rhode Island became one of the first New England states to transition from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, around the 1920s, predating the New Deal.\n\n9. Nelson Aldrich (Republican, 1881-1911)\n\nAristocratic and overbearing, Aldrich was a man who was not afraid to tinker with financial and social systems to produce better outcomes. Nobody lobbied harder than he for an aggressive system of tariffs and protections—these helped the factories in Providence and Woonsocket by kneecapping foreign competition, but also made prices artificially high. Aldrich was also an early architect of the income tax and the Federal Reserve. Libertarians hate these programs with a passion, but my reading of history convinces me that their effect on American society has been more salutary, forging an American economy that can better absorb the shocks of a volatile market. Aldrich has significant weaknesses that need to be taken into account. He was a tool of the American investor, to be sure, held the common man in contempt, and bankrolled Belgium’s King Leopold’s inhumane imperial actions in the Congo. A complicated man from a complicated era, Aldrich has a foot in the self-serving corporatism of the Gilded Age, and another foot in the managerial Progressive Age.\n\n10. Claiborne Pell (Democrat, 1963-1997)\n\n[ii] In our all-time greatest Senate, Claiborne Pell occupies an important role as “The Education Senator.” An aristocrat like Aldrich, Pell was motivated by a greater sense of altruism. He is most famous, of course, for the Pell Grants, a significant means by which young men and women from low-income families can attend college. He was also a key foreign policy man in the Senate, as a chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, an early skeptic on the Vietnam War, and a stalwart supporter of the United Nations. An odd man who wore threadbare suits and held a lifelong fascination with UFOs, John Kennedy once called Pell the “least electable man in America,” and Rhode Island voters spent nearly 40 years proving him wrong.\n\nRunners-up: Lincoln Chafee was the last real liberal Republican, and the only Republican in his caucus to vote against sanctioning the Iraq War. While he only served in the Senate for a shade over one six-year term, he still deserves a shout-out.\n\n[i] In order to divide this list into 10 sets of five states, I’m grouping Connecticut with a New York City-region group of states that I am calling “The Metropolis.” I do acknowledge, though, that The Constitution State is often placed with New England.\n\n[ii] Damn, I love the senatorial class of 1963. Lots of great senators were first elected at that time— not only Pell, but also George McGovern, Birch Bayh, Daniel Inouye, Gaylord Nelson, Abraham Ribicoff, Thomas McIntyre. Pell was one of the only ones to have survived the 1980 senatorial slaughter of the innocence that swept liberal Democrats from conservative states out of office, only to be replaced by jokers like Jim Abdnor, Dan Quayle, Bob Kasten, Brock Adams, etc.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe folks at the Epcot Explorer’s Encyclopedia are an interesting lot. They are often able to detect what is happening in the Disney parks weeks ahead of anyone else by looking at who is filing legal paperwork, where packages are mailed to within the Disney premises, and at times, I think they may have used some satellite photographs as well. Recently, they have uncovered a piece by a consultant who was hired by Disney to critique Epcot in the early 1990s. The consultant, and his colleagues, lambasted the ideology that drove Epcot– it did nothing to challenge the guests and put the park in a philosophical straitjacket.\n\nPart of the critique goes as follows: “The problem is not that Epcot has become more an amusement park than museum. The problem is that Epcot is providing a mistimed truth to a people in desperate need of moral and civic guidance. It is like trying to enlighten a miser by putting forward the idea that a penny saved is a penny earned. The miser already knows this, indeed lives by this philosophy. He will learn nothing from hearing it restated. What the miser needs to consider is something along the lines of the Robert Herrick poem that begins, “gather ye rosebuds while ye may”. To quote Andre Gide, “That education is best which goes counter to you.” He meant that we learn by contrast and comparison, not by redundancy and confirmation.\n\nThe unstated theme of Epcot is “technology uber alles.” In every exhibit, in every conceivable way, Epcot proclaims that paradise is to be achieved by technological progress. This message includes the idea that new is better than slow, that simple is better than complex…to the question, ‘what will it mean to be a human being in the future,’ EPCOT answers, ‘you will find fulfillment in loving your machines.’ People who flock to Epcot warm to this message, as a miser will warm to being told that a penny saved is a penny earned. But he will learn nothing from it.\n\nDamn! As much as I loved the Epcot of the late 1980s and early 1990s, this is a harsh and forthright rebuke, and I am convinced by many of its arguments. The author of this piece, Neil Postman, correctly identifies some problems that I recognize in hindsight. Technology is, in fact, what elevates man. Communications and transportation developments sent humanity on an upward trajectory in Spaceship Earth and World of Motions— they allowed us to fulfill our dearest wishes, whether through the freedom of the automobile, or the accessibility of the microchip. Even in Journey into Imagination, imagination was valued not for its own sake, but for its real-world application. Numerous tableau showed its role in fostering scientific discovery, for example. Similarly, even Horizons, a family-oriented view of the future, granted new (and yet-undeveloped in 1983) technologies the role of savior, bringing a family separated by hundreds of miles together through the use of holographic video screens. I think that this argument does not hold as much water when applied to the World Showcase (which has similar themes of universal brotherhood, and often implies that cultural difference is superficial compared to humanity’s commonalities.) But when applied to Future World– the pavillions with lengthy rides and corporate sponsorship– it becomes more problematic. Postman goes on to contrast Epcot with the museum of immigration at Ellis Island, which argues for a polyglot, patchwork citizenship defined by a common commitment to American ideals, rather than the consumerist model of citizenship that derived from the 1950s, or the “yellow ribbon on your car” mode of citizienship that became en vogue after September 11th. A museum must alter our way of thinking, or as Postman puts it, “A museum must be in argument with its society, and what is more, it must be a timely argument.”\n\nBut this is precisely the problem. Who would go to a museum that remonstrates, or tells you that you are consuming too much, that you are besieging the environment, or that your country’s history is rent with racial baggage? And at Disney’s exorbitant theme park prices, such lessons would be particularly unwelcome– and indeed, this is one reason why its clientele pay $75 tickets to hear an affirmative message– they would be up in arms about paying $75 to be scolded or chastised.\n\nBut suppose, for a moment, that Epcot did in fact take Postman’s suggestion, and lived up to its promise to enlighten humanity by putting forth genuinely different worldviews that challenged its guests, rather than coddled them or convinced them to place their faith in the consumer society? What would such a park look like?\n\nMy guess is this— a World Showcase that featured national images and displays that its guests were more unfamiliar with. As it stands, the World Showcase is mostly routine Western Europe fair– Germany, Italy, etc., with heavy doses of other civilizations like China and Japan that are superficially exotic. a better display, and one which would challenge its guests a bit more, might include a country lineup like Vietnam, Haiti, Turkey, Israel, Indonesia, India, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Russia. The Future World section would be more than an extended commercial. (I remember how the Universe of Energy spent 5 seconds of a 40-minute show on global warming, telling us that it was “controversial.” Maybe in the Exxon board room, but outside of conservative think tanks, there is scientific consensus.) So– pavilions on the environment, world religions, and charitable activism would certainly rock the boat. The Land might have more work on sustainable agriculture in the third world. The Universe of Energy would address pollution more forthrightly. Wonders of Life would a) be open, and b) grapple with obesity, eating disorders, and communicable disease.\n\nNobody would pay good money to see this, perhaps, but it would be a fascinating experiment if Epcot could be temporarily tweaked for a short while to see how guests would like to be challenged, rather than placated. Cynics such as P.T. Barnum once said that nobody ever got broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public, but such a bizzaro-Epcot would put this idea to the test. Ah, well. My phone remains on its stand, waiting for the Imagineers to call.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n10. Talespin: Another Disney Afternoon staple, I think Talespin holds up better than any of the others. Using a few characters from The Jungle Book, it sets them in an entirely different situation– Cape Suzzette, a harbor town during what appears to be the 1920s. I can’t think of an animated show that more skillfully evokes its setting– radio serials, art deco architecture, airfoils, foreboding and overreaching corporations (She’re Khan is an industry mogul on this show– a great touch!)– this is the 1920s to a tee. Lovingly created, skillfully voiced (Jim Cummings as Don Karnage and Sally Struthers as Rebecca Cunningham were particularly inspired choices)– it is no mistake that this show coincided with Disney’s animation renaissance in motion pictures.\n\n9. Captain Planet and the Planeteers: All of a sudden, in the early 1990s, saving the earth became both cool and urgent. We all wore “Get Earth Smart” tv shows, we all read “50 Simple Things YOU Can Do to Save the Earth”, planted trees, etc. Captain Planet spoke to this era brilliantly. Now, granted, you couldn’t quite get away with this today. Essentially, Ted Turner told an animation company, “look, I want you to make an animated show about a superhero who saves the earth. Oh, and he must have 5 sidekicks– one from every major continent.” And the animation executives scribble this down. “Oh, and this superhero must have blue skin– and a green mullet, if you can swing it.” more scribbling. “Sure, Ted, whatever you say.” We could get away with watching this show all hours on the grounds that it was education (and it was!). Conservatives have argued that this show was propaganda, and I suppose that is true– but it was necessary propaganda that we needed at the time. Sometimes, providing balance is the most dishonest thing one can do, and the writers of this show understood this truth. So, yes, while there were a number of silly and over-reaching episodes (particularly the later ones on overpopulation and The Troubles in Ireland), I’ll still stand by this show as a significant generational awakening.\n\n8. Doug: I don’t think there was ever a television character I identified with so much as Doug. Doug was the creation of Jim Jenkins for the Nicktoon series- a less well-remembered contemporary of Rugrats and Ren and Stimpy. An introspective and awkward kid, the show transitions between Doug’s everyday life and struggles– bullying, unrequited love, physical fitness tests in school, etc.– and his daydreams. There is a delightful Walter Mitty-ish character to the show that made for both good television as well as reflecting how I approached problems at the time. As an aside, I loved a recurring fictional band called The Beets that would show up on Doug— allowing for several sly Beatles references. And one of their songs, “Killer Tofu” is actually one of my favorite songs from the 1990s.\n\n7. X-Men: Making a good television series off of a comic book can be extremely difficult to pull off, but X-Men broke significant ground. How does one make sense of what was, at that point, thirty years of backstory? It wisely chose 8 X-Men (and unwisely chose Jubilee over Kitty Pryde), and Professor X, and simplified the complex milieu that Stan Lee, Chris Claremont, Scott Lobdell, etc., had created. Like Captain Planet, it could claim to be quasi-educational– questions of bigotry loomed large, and the I can’t think of a television show grappling with religion more intelligently than the show’s Nightcrawler episodes. While 90s X-Men still used mutants vs. homo sapien as a metaphor for racial struggle, I can see why the show gained traction among the gay community– for whom matters of difference and identity were well addressed on the show.\n\n6. All That: Nickelodeon’s answer to Saturday Night Live, this show had me in stitches as a preteen. Although some of the skits were troubled (two black kids hosting a cooking show where everything they eat is chocolate??), a vast majority were incredibly fun to watch– Kenan Thompson, for example, played a Frenchman taking a bath in a raincoat, while teaching children such crucial French phrases as “kiss me under the baloney tree.” Goodburger, Katrina Johnson’s Ross Perot impression (which was pretty damn good, let me tell you), and Lori Beth Denburg’s “Vital Information”. I would routinely be laughing at skits from this show days after I had watched them– even in church. While only one member from the crew (Thompson) graduated to the big leagues, it was still one of the most entertaining things you could have watched when you were 11.\n\n5. Whose Line Is It Anyway?: Putting an improv show on prime time television was risky– but one that paid dividends for ABC. Although sent to languish opposite the time slot of NBC’s Friends, a revolving cast of four improv actors set out under Drew Carey’s direction to act out scenes spontaneously. While Ryan Stiles, Colin Mocherie, and Wayne Brady anchored the show, other participants included Greg Proops, Robin Williams, and in one unforgettable cameo, Richard Simmons. There are shows that make you laugh when you are by yourself, and shows that make you laugh in the company of others- and Whose Line was certainly best as a shared experience. I don’t think there are many moments I enjoy more than watching this show with my dad, and watch Wayne Brady pull off another successful impersonation, or watch Ryan Stiles grimace as he’s given another near-impossible role (e.g. a foal being born).\n\n4. Jeopardy: I think I’ve watched more episodes of this show than any other on this list– not difficult for a game show, but still. One of the small joys of the show is watching Alex Trebek evolve from being a small, busy man with an unattractive mustache to a more urbane, debonair, sophisticated, but ultimately sympathetic host. The show has changed a bit over the years– greater dollar amounts, the right to stay on the show until you lost (hence Ken Jennings), the Clue Crew and more audio-visual clues, a greater sense of humor, and a wider range of topics. Most shows die when you change the format like that, but Jeopardy towed the line carefully and remained fun to watch. Perhaps I like the show too much for selfish reasons– it lets me show off what I know– but it is the sort of thing that each of us is better for watching.\n\n3. The Simpsons: I’ll be the first to admit the show is in irreversible decline, and has been since I was in high school. It seems that the writers have simply run out of good scenarios, and that most episodes since the mid-Clinton administration have been retreads of older episodes, The Simpsons on location to Brazil or China or India or something, three-Simpsonsized Bible stories/history lessons/tall tales etc., or an episode revolving around a guest star who badgered the show’s producers into letting him appear on the show. But from its third season until about its ninth or tenth, this was the best comedy on television. Its animated form allowed it to defy physics, have a deep bench of 100 or so minor characters, and effortlessly visit any locale. And it did so many types of humor well over the years. Much of it was character based. Knowing that Waylon Smithers was an ambiguously gay sycophant, for example, made every interaction with his character more interesting. And much of it was absurdist. (One of my favorite scenes involved Homer saying something along the lines of “I’m a nerdy sad loser with no life who has a stupid mustache” to successfully get into Ned Flanders head and guess his whereabouts). And sometimes it expanded the boundaries of animation itself. (One of my best friends’ favorite episodes is one such feature, Homer’s peyote-freakout in “El Voyaje Mysterioso del Nuestro Homer”). The Simpsons have become like family over the years, and what began life as a rude, in-your-face sitcom that drew the ire of Barbara Bush became, without changing very much of its substance over time, one of the most well-loved things on television.\n\n2. Star Trek: The Next Generation: TNG was both immaculately character-driven and immaculately vision-driven. The cynicism of Firefly is all too believable– i would argue that it took more energy and more imagination to sustain the Roddenberry vision that TNG best embodies– that humanity CAN become better, that peace can be brokered, that race and religious differences can be overcome, illness is not unconquerable, that greed need not guide society. To make this point, you had a number of generation-defining actors to actualize this vision. Patrick Stewart’s turn as Jean-Luc Picard is the most well-performed role on television in my lifetime (only my opinion, of course), but consider also how damn good Brent Spiner was as the android Data, forever aspiring to become human, or Levar Burton as nice-guy engineer Geordi LaForge, or John de Lanci’s brilliant work as the omnipotent Q. I like this better than the original Star Trek partly because of its superior budget, its more thoughtful storylines, its willingness to engage with controversy more often (I still think the “gay’ episode of TNG, “The Outcast”, was riskier than the interracial kiss on the original series’ “Plato’s Stepchildren” for its time).\n\n1. Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood: There’s so many different things that made this show great, and so many different ways that this show has had an impact on my life. To limit it to just a few: Mister Rogers validated the worth of every young person watching the show, and affirmed their importance and uniqueness as individuals. He also translated these ideals effectively in how he carried himself in his own life. He sensitively discussed issues that children needed to hear– things like divorce and grandparents dying when I was young, weightier topics like the Sept. 11 attacks during his final years. He clearly distinguished between reality and fantasy, unlike other childrens’ television shows. In Mister Rogers’ house, the normal laws of the universe were obeyed. In the Neighborhood of Make Believe, all bets were off. Although cruelly mocked by many of the years (regretfully, including myself), Mister Rogers and his television show were national treasures. Frankly, we did not deserve someone quite like him. For those of us growing up watching PBS, he made each day special, just by being himself. Can you say ‘transcendent’, television neighbor? I knew you could.\n\nRead Full Post »"
