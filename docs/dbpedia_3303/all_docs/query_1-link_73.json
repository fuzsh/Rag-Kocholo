        "text": "The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to confirm Arkansan Chris Caldwell to serve as the Federal Co-Chairman of the Delta Regional Authority (DRA).\n\nCaldwell, who serves on the staff of U.S. Senator John Boozman, was nominated to lead the DRA by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The Little Rock native was raised on a cattle ranch in central Arkansas and has headed special projects on Boozman’s staff.\n\nCaldwell has extensive experience in political campaigns, most recently managing Boozman’s successful re-election bid. He also worked on Governor Mike Huckabee’s 2008 presidential bid and Senator Tim Hutchinson’s 2002 campaign.\n\nBeyond his political and government service, Caldwell has held various roles in the private sector and is an active volunteer in his community. He graduated with a B.A. in Communications from the University of Arkansas.\n\n“Chris brings so much to the table. He’s a tenacious, committed public servant who has a strong sense of duty to the region. He understands what it takes to bring economic growth to our communities and will excel in this role. I truly believe that great things are in store for the entire Delta region with Chris at the helm of the DRA,” Boozman said.\n\nThe DRA is a federal-state partnership that works to improve regional economic opportunity in the Mississippi River Delta Region across eight states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee."
