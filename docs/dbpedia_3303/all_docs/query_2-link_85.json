Harlon’s middle name was “Ray,” and he was aptly named. His kind, encouraging, uplifting spirit was a ray of sunshine to everyone he encountered. He was fond of saying, “Strangers are just friends I haven’t met yet.” He was born September 17, 1930 to Thomas and Verna (Harrison) Sory in Shoal Creek, Arkansas. His humble beginnings and a thirst for knowledge led him to take advantage of the GI Bill after his service in the USAF to earn his degree from Arkansas Tech. Being a “people person,” he found the perfect career as a staffing specialist (HR) for the Corps of Engineers. Always willing to lend a helping hand, after retirement Harlon found fulfillment in volunteering for various groups; Visiting Nurses Association, the Food Pantry, Rockbuilders, and many others. He served as president of NARFE for several years, and many folks in Saline County are using wheelchair ramps that he helped to build. Harlon was a “wordsmith” with an incredible vocabulary that he continued to build throughout his life. He was a devout Christian and member of Bryant First Southern Baptist Church, where he could be found volunteering, ministering to people or helping out as needed. In earlier years he served as a deacon, choir member and song director. Harlon had a lifelong love of all kinds of music, even learning to play the violin after retiring. He also enjoyed sports, playing golf, gardening and overseeing ”Southfork”, he and Jean’s rural homestead near Traskwood. But the greatest source of pride and joy in his life was presiding over his family as patriarch, organizing family gatherings and being surrounded by his whole boisterous family. In short, Harlon lived a full and happy life, almost 67 of those years with the love of his life, Jean (Hays), who survives him. They were almost inseparable, enjoying their work and hobbies together in blessed harmony. Harlon is also survived by his daughter, Brenda Sory of St. Francisville, LA; son, Ken (JoAnn) Sory of Bryant, AR; granddaughters, Dr. Victoria (Paul) Evans of Little Rock and Kayla Sory of Conway, AR; grandsons, Casey (Julie) Lillie of Zachary, LA and Chris (Holly) Sory of Bryant, AR; and great- grandchildren, Isabel Sory, Gibson Evans, Alyssa Lillie, Barrett Sory, Miller Evans and Cora Sory. Harlon is also survived by a sister, Marilyn Hays of Little Rock, AR; brother, Thomas Sory of Belleville, IL; and several beloved nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents; brother, Franklin Sory; and sisters, Sylvia Sory and Maxine Citron. Visitation will be at Roller-Alcoa Funeral Home in Benton, Arkansas on Wednesday, November 13, from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Funeral service will begin at 2:00 pm following the visitation. Interment will follow at Forest Hills Memorial Park on Highway 5 in Alexander, Arkansas.
