        "text": "JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) - In his “Salute to Veterans” series, U.S. Senator John Boozman of Arkansas recognized the service of Jonesboro resident and former KAIT employee Ed Watson.\n\nWatson, who was born at his family’s home in Craighead County in 1946, attended Arkansas State University on a work scholarship.\n\nWhile at A-State, Watson participated in ROTC; however, his grades were not good enough to get a deferment. After two years of college, he was drafted.\n\nWatson said his dad was a supporter of the military, but he paid attention to the news and knew the dangers ahead for his son.\n\n“He was pretty much up to date on what was going on in Vietnam, and he was scared to death for me,” Watson said.\n\nHe first went to Fort Polk, Louisiana, for basic training, where he was recognized as the best trainee of the cycle in his unit, thanks in large part to his ROTC experience.\n\nNext, he went to Ford Ord, California, for one week before attending combat engineering training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.\n\nHe returned home briefly before going to Fort Lewis, Washington, where he was shipped out to Vietnam.\n\nDuring his deployment, Watson served as a combat demolitionist.\n\n“There were nights on end that we had mortar attacks. In fact, I have a flag that has holes in it that I had put up on a bamboo pole on top of my bunker,” he recalled. “We were sleeping in trenches on the ground with steel matting over the top of that and sandbags on top of that. And I had stuck this flag up, and a mortar hit our hole. It didn’t hit any of us. It dispersed.”\n\nAfter 50 weeks in Vietnam, Wason rotated out two weeks early. However, his time in the war zone took its toll.\n\n“Those around me know I came back a different person,” he said. “I was somewhat different. I will say a little harder, harsher.”\n\nOnce back on American soil, Watson was stationed in an armored unit at Fort Hood, Texas, to serve out his two-year commitment.\n\nWatson said part of his commitment included serving in the reserves once he left active duty. He remembered a conversation with an officer who served in Vietnam while he was there about re-enlisting. He learned even the officer had no interest in continuing his military service.\n\nWith encouragement from Army officials, Watson applied for an early separation so he could return to school in Arkansas.\n\nHe credited then A-State Professor Charles Raspberry, a Navy veteran, with helping him finish his degree.\n\n“He made sure I took classes that were in my chosen field and helped me out a lot,” he said.\n\nReflecting on his time in the service, he recalled a conversation he overheard with a veteran who was being thanked: “His response was ‘Thank you, you’re worth it.’ And I’ve adopted that. That’s how I respond.”\n\nIf there is one thing he wishes could be different, it is how civilians view those who wear our nation’s uniform.\n\n“If they knew what a veteran goes through, if they knew what a veteran lives with, I think they’d view us differently,” he said.\n\n“Ed Watson honorably served our country. Like many others of his generation, his military service shaped his life and appreciation for the unique experiences of those who spend time in our military,” Boozman said. “His story is an important piece of a larger narrative that helps us understand our own history. I’m pleased to recognize his selfless sacrifice and preserve his memories.”\n\nThe senator submitted Watson’s entire interview to the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.\n\nIn addition to his service to America, Watson was a much-loved and revered employee of KAIT-TV, where he worked as an account executive until his retirement in 2016."
