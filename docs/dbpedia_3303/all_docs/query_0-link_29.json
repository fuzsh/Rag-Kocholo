        "text": "During her initial week as a newly promoted faculty member, Isis Martel, M.S., an Instructor in the Research and Evaluation Division (RED) of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, was awarded a five year, $2 million grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The grant was awarded for a new project known as Parents and Children Together (PACT).\n\nPACT will enhance services for clients through case management and connection to clinical and community resources. This collaborative effort between UAMS, County Drug Courts, Ozark Guidance, Inc., and community agencies will link children to evidence-based treatments to treat past trauma and prevent future trauma. The target population is children of parents who have a substance use disorder (SUD), or co-occurring SUD/mental illness (COD), have experienced trauma, and who are at high risk for trauma continued inter-generational trauma. PACT will enroll participants in Benton, Washington, and Madison Counties in Northwest Arkansas (NWA). PACT will serve 335 children and their families throughout the lifetime of the project. Goals of the project are to: 1) Increase access and engagement of services among the target population; 2) Improve system capacity and infrastructure to provide effective, evidence-based, culturally appropriate trauma services; and 3) Improve child/family outcomes in NWA and reduce health disparities among historically disadvantaged populations. UAMS will facilitate infrastructure development to expand and enhance access to a comprehensive and trauma-informed continuum of care and connection to resources for our population of focus.\n\nGet additional information about this new grant and about PACT.\n\nNews about RED\n\nDFPM-RED is happy to share …\n\nThe Northwest Arkansas team is currently in process of moving locations; we will temporarily be in Lowell co-located with ACH – Center for Children and future location(s) is TBD.\n\nCOVID changes for children: Using data from parents in early childcare programs in Arkansas, two internal reports were produced (happy to send if you are interested). Key findings you might find interesting:\n\nCOVID (as expected) reduced visits to the library to near zero which makes things very difficult for low-income families.\n\nOn the positive side, the time someone read to children remained steady except a reduction in the summer of 2020. The number of books in the home also dropped in the summer of 2020, but returned to near normal by the fall of 2020\n\nYoung children also need the stimulation of activities outside the home. We found sharp drops in children joining in shopping trips (safe decision re: COVID); however, there were reductions in walks and attending athletic events (which for preschoolers are usually outside and safer).\n\nUpdates from Faculty\n\nDr. Whiteside-Mansell is focusing on funding for grant proposals related to the assessment of adverse childhood experiences in clinical settings. One was internal (123-GO) and was not funded but will be considered in the next round of funding. It was in collaboration with two regional programs. She has recently submitted an NIH/BIR proposal in collaboration with CAFES on the topic.\n\nDr. Edge: Nikki and DFPM/PRI team members submitted an application for a SAMHSA grant which would allow for the development and dissemination of trauma-informed care resources in early learning settings nationally, in partnership with Georgetown University and Arkansas State University. Cross your fingers for good news in the fall!\n\nDr. Lewis: has submitted a KL2 (UAMS Translational Research Institute: TRI career development award) proposal, with her primary mentor Dr. McKelvey, that will examine the effectiveness of Home Visiting programs delivered via telehealth compared to in-person.\n\nMs. Martel: Isis and the Northwest Arkansas team are focusing on proposals that will expand current work with vulnerable populations. They have successfully assisted 3 community organizations to apply for Substance Treatment Funding and RED will be doing the evaluation for each of these projects when awarded. We have also applied in partnership with ARBEST for a SAMHSA grant: “Parents and Children Together” (PACT) that aims to reduce adverse childhood experiences of children with parents who have a substance use disorder and/or criminal justice involvement. Isis has partnered with Melissa Zielinski in Psychiatric Research Institute to submit manuscripts for publication; the first article is under review.\n\nNew Funding\n\nIsis Martel’s team in NWA RED was awarded a sub-award to continue partnership with Washington County Drug Court evaluation for a new 5 year (see update from Martel above)\n\nThe HIV Team hits again! Courtney Hampton – a new HIV coordinator hired recently – working with mentorship from LaTunja Sockwell has just received word that her application to the Ark Dept of Health was funded. The project will receive five years of funding at $200K per year to contribute to their focus on ending the HIV Epidemic. Her key activities will be:\n\nActivity: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Awareness and Navigation\n\nI. Targeted PrEP awareness campaign.\n\nII. A website and toll-free number for connecting to a PrEP navigator.\n\nIII. Implementation of services for ensuring PrEP retention, continuous HIV testing and counseling, and linkage to PrEP provider services.\n\nIV. Implementation of a developed logistics plan for ensuring transportation assistance to a PrEP provider for care services.\n\nRecent Publications and Updates\n\nYoong, S.L., Jones, J., Pearson, N., Swindle, T., Barnes, C., Delaney, T., Lum, M., Golley, R., Matwiejczyk, L., Kelly, B., Kerr, E., Love, P., Esdaile, E., Ward, D., & Grady, A., (In Press).

Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior\n\nNews about RED Faculty\n\nDr. Lorraine McKelvey will be promoted to Professor on July 1.\n\nDr. Taren Swindle will be promoted to Associate Professor on July 1.\n\nMs. LaTunja Sockwell and Ms. Isis Martel have been notified that they will be promoted to Instructor faculty positions on July 1, 2021. Both have consistently funded their research agendas with external funding in non-faculty position. Ms. Sockwell’s work focuses on HIV prevention and education. Ms. Martel leads RED’s work in Northwest Arkansas and has focused on substance use prevention efforts. Both of these amazing individuals have functioned like faculty for some time. I am sure we will see them progress even further.\n\nUpdates from Faculty\n\nDr. Whiteside-Mansell has submitted an application to conduct preliminary work to integrate pediatric adverse childhood experiences in partnership with Drs. Edge and McKelvey and UAMS clinical faculty. She is also working an NIH funding to continue this work.\n\nDr. Edge continues her efforts on a statewide initiative to reduce expulsion of preschool children and has several ongoing efforts to expand her funding to support K-12 children who may be experiencing trauma at home.\n\nDr. McKelvey has been ask to be an expert consultant with CCDF Lead Agencies build their capacity to conduct narrow cost analyses; combine findings from narrow cost analyses with market rate survey data; and use both price and cost data to inform the setting of child care subsidy reimbursement rates.\n\nDr. Swindle is nervously awaiting news about the funding status of her NIH R01 submissions which will focus on testing an adaptive implementation strategy for WISE. This strategy seeks to optimize providing ECE settings with the right amount of support to succeed in WISE implementation, recognizing that some sites will need more, and some sites will need less support.\n\nDr. Lewis is preparing a KL2 (UAMS Translational Research Institute (TRI) for career development) that will examine the effectiveness of community interventions delivered in-person compared to using telehealth. See also her and Dr. McKelvey’s new publication in the prestigious journal Pediatrics.\n\nMs. Sockwell is working on a new community grant in partnership with a community organization to expand her work in the prevention of HIV from SAMSHA.\n\nMs. Martel will be busy implementing her new grant (see below). She has drug treatment grant’s in collaboration with adult drug courts in NWA in the works.\n\nNew Funding\n\nNWA RED has been informed of intent to fund new ADH grant under “rural opioid” category. Partnership with Washington County Drug Court expansion into Madison County for supportive services to be added there and provided by Harbor House. UAMS is grantee Isis Martel as PI.\n\nRecent Publications and Updates\n\n1. Whiteside-Mansell, L., Sockwell, L., Knight, D., Crone, C.
