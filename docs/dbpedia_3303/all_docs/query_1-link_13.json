        "text": "WASHINGTON — The schedule shows Congress will be in town for 13 days between now and the week after the Nov. 5 congressional and presidential elections.\n\nJudging from the amount of work left, such as passing an annual federal government budget, most remaining legislation will be shunted aside, including the $1.25 trillion Farm Bill, the shorthand for H.R. 8467, the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024.\n\nIt’s not just 25,000 Louisiana farms that rely on Farm Bill policies and federally backed loans to cover expenses until crops are harvested. The Farm Bill also funds SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps for about 936,000 Louisiana residents.\n\nAs Louisiana's third largest industry, after tourism and energy, agricultural production accounts for $30 billion of economic impact for the state, Louisiana economic development officials say.\n\n\"The vast majority of Louisiana's agricultural commodities are penciling out below the cost of production,\" Richard Fontenot, president of the Louisiana Farm Bureau, said Friday night. \"That means without an updated safety net through an updated Farm Bill, many of our farmers will either go further into debt or even out of business. That's why we need Congress to act now and proceed with the Farm, Food, and National Security Act. ...Farmers are counting on leadership to prevail, and prevail soon, over partisan politics.\"\n\nThe Republican-majority House Committee on Agriculture approved its version May 24. The Democratic-majority Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee has issued a kind of outline but no bill yet.\n\nThe key sticking points between Republicans and Democrats is how much the Farm Bill will cost for its basic elements – food production, food security, and conservation – and how those amounts will be paid.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated that the House version of the Farm Bill would increase spending an estimated $33 billion, mainly due to increases in commodity spending, according to the report released Friday.\n\nThat CBO report led Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Ag committee, to say the GOP House version clearly isn’t paid for and “relies on magic math and wishful thinking.” She added, “To reach a bipartisan agreement, we need to have a real negotiation on how to pay for our investments in the Farm Bill.”\n\nAmerican Farm Bureau economists are projecting across-the-board losses because Farm Bill policies were last updated in 2018. Those policies set the price in the formulas that determine loan costs and set subsidies protecting America’s food supply from everything from market swings to bad weather.\n\nThe five-year law was last passed in 2018. When it came up for renewal in September 2023, the Republican-majority 118th Congress couldn’t agree and punted until the end of September 2024.\n\nDuring those six years, the Farm Bureau points out, the nation’s economy shifted dramatically — particularly as the pandemic, coupled with wars in Israel and Ukraine, Europe’s breadbasket, stressed the supply chain and drove up costs for seeds, fuel and labor.\n\n“In the last five years, 141,000 family farms have gone under due to economic pressures, changing circumstances and regulatory burdens. The time is now, not next year, to renew and improve risk management programs,” Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau, said in a statement.\n\nEven before the CBO report added to situation, passing a Farm Bill by the end of the year was going \"to be really difficult,” at least that was how Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman assessed the situation in mid-July. He made those comments to fellow Arkansas delegates during a breakfast meeting at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper.\n\nA Shreveport native, Boozman is the highest-ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.\n\nThe state’s junior senator, Tom Cotton, who is given to flamboyant rhetoric, then told the delegates that should the GOP win the Senate majority in November, then Boozman could chair the Senate panel.\n\n“The willingness to delay the bill to play election-year politics is selfish and disrespectful to our farmers. They depend on us to pass a bipartisan farm bill,” Rep. David Scott of Georgia, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House ag committee, said July 11.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, didn’t respond to a query about whether he would schedule a Farm Bill vote during the 20 days the House is scheduled to meet in November and December.\n\nPer usual for this Congress, policy differences are described with extreme rhetoric. The points of contention, though, are fairly technical.\n\nFor instance, there’s disagreement over whether money to pay for conservation efforts should come from the Inflation Reduction Act or as a separate appropriation. Democrats want to keep the IRA funding because it addresses carbon emission reduction. Republicans would put that money toward other uses within the Farm Bill and rely on the separate appropriation to cover the climate-smart agricultural initiatives.\n\nIssues also need to be ironed out over handling inflationary increases in SNAP benefits and money left over from loan programs.\n\nFive hundred agricultural organizations asked Johnson and other congressional leaders in a letter to stop politicking and get to work finding common ground.\n\nIf the 118th Congress can’t pass the Farm Bill by the end of December, the whole process begins again in January with a new bill filed and new hearings held. None of that work starts immediately. The newly elected 119th Congress first will have to elect new leaders, who then will choose new committee chairs and members.\n\n“We cannot continue to wait for updated policies, provisions, initiatives and critical funding that support our collective interests,” the groups wrote July 22 in a fairly short and direct letter. Ten of the letter’s 12 pages are signatories, including the Louisiana Pork Producers Association and the Louisiana Wildlife Federation.\n\n“We respectfully and strongly urge you to craft a bipartisan farm bill that can pass your respective chambers.”"
