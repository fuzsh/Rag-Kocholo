        "text": "Recent 'Salute to Veterans' Highlights\n\nThe late Marvin Trigg grew up on his family’s farm in rural Missouri. He was put to work at an early age milking cows and using a two man crosscut saw to harvest wood. He enlisted in the Army in 1955 when he was 21 years old. His family was supportive of his decision. He was stationed at Fort Chaffee and Fort Knox during his service. Click here to learn more about his time in uniform.\n\nKeith Greene was born in Jackson County, Missouri where he and his siblings grew up working in their dad’s grocery business. He remembered working hard from an early age with the rest of his family. Greene enrolled in junior college after graduating high school in 1960, but quickly realized he didn’t enjoy the class schedule or continuing to work for his dad. He was sent to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for basic training. Although it was in the same state, Greene remembered it being very different from his life at home. Greene also found that the skills he learned in his family’s business could help him in the Army, especially his ability to drive a truck. He had a chauffeur’s license and was frequently assigned to haul people all over the base. He remembered being thankful the job allowed him to get out of kitchen patrol duty.

He also participated in ROTC. This experience made him better prepared than most others for basic training as evidenced by a citation he earned as the best trainee of the cycle in his unit. He deployed to Vietnam and served as a combat demolitionist. Watson spent 50 weeks in Vietnam and rotated out two weeks early because he was saving money to be married and had unused vacation days. With encouragement from Army officials, Watson decided to apply for an early separation so he could return to school in Arkansas. He says military service changed his attitude, but he would do it again. Click here to learn more.\n\nHarold Beaver grew up in Searcy, Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas where he pursued a degree in engineering. After completing a mandatory two years of ROTC, Beaver chose to pursue advanced ROTC. He graduated in May 1969 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. He was selected for pilot training. After he completed his class he elected to be a pilot training instructor. He taught student pilots to fly the T-37. Beaver and other instructors trained a lot of foreign pilots. One of his best students was from Norway. He found it most challenging to train Iranian students, because they weren’t proficient in English. Beaver said the hardest part of learning to fly was the motion sickness, but he found ways to overcome the challenge. Click here to hear more about his time in the Air Force."
