(born 1950). American politician John Boozman was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2010 and began representing the state of Arkansas the following year.

Boozman was born on December 10, 1950, in Shreveport, Louisiana, but grew up in Fort Smith, Arkansas. He excelled in sports as a youth and played gridiron football while at the University of Arkansas in nearby Fayetteville. He did not graduate, but he received a degree in optometry from the Southern College of Optometry in 1977 and established a private practice, which he operated until 2001. He also ran a small ranch in Rogers, Arkansas, the Ozarks city where he established his eye clinic and served on the school board.

In 1998 Boozmanâ€™s brother, Fay Boozman, ran as the Republican candidate against Democrat Blanche Lincoln for a U.S. Senate seat but was defeated by a large margin. John, who won a special election for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 and was subsequently reelected to the House four times, ran against Lincoln in 2010 and won.

Boozman generally pursued a conservative agenda and reliably voted with his party, although he broke with Republican colleagues on some issues of spending and budget. He opposed gun control, amnesty or pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He was particularly involved in legislation that concerned agriculture and foreign trade, noting that his Arkansas constituency relied on a strong agricultural economy. In 2014 Boozman underwent emergency heart surgery but returned to the Senate later that year.
