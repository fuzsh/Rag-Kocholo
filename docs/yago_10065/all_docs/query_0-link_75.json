        "text": "Want to move people to action? Call in the designers. Need to right the ship in a hurry? Same.\n\nOn the Sunday in July when Joe Biden announced he was passing the torch, the Biden/Harris design team leapt into emergency responder mode, rebranding the campaign within hours with a “Harris for President” logo fashioned to convey both continuity and a fresh start.\n\nA smooth transition in the candidacy and an orderly Democratic National Convention (DNC) required an immediate visual identity for the party to grab onto and rally around.\n\n“Designing for Change: Chicago Protest Art of the 1960s–70s,” the Chicago History Museum’s current exhibition, makes a case for our town as an epicenter for protest movements and the design that mobilizes them. It includes more than 100 artifacts and artworks from the years before, during, and after the notorious 1968 DNC.\n\n“Designing for Change: Chicago Protest Art of the 1960s–70s”\n\nThrough 6/28/2025: Tue-Sat 9:30 AM-4:30 PM, Sun noon-5 PM, Chicago History Museum, 1601 N. Clark, chicagohistory.org, $19 ($17 seniors 65+ and students 19-22, members and Illinois residents 18 and under free)\n\nChicago has long been a hub for what’s now called artivism, says Olivia Mahoney, the exhibition’s curator. She retired from the museum in 2019 after nearly 40 years there but returned for this project, which took three years to research and develop.\n\nMahoney says that while the process might be akin to creating the corporate logos so abundant today, artists working for social movements then were unlikely to be on any payroll. “Committed to their causes, they tended to be students or recent art school graduates. We had several art schools and a community of artists, which helps explain why we produced so much protest art. And with the city’s numerous colleges and universities, the student movement here was also really strong.”\n\n“These were mostly graphic artists,” Mahoney says. “Chicago has a very rich history of graphic art, both protest and commercial. And we were a major printing center. All of that fed into it. Chicago produced some really important material over the decades, but it usually gets overshadowed by the fine artists, making unique, one of a kind work. This is art that is mass produced for the masses.”\n\nIn the 2024 spring/summer issue of the museum’s magazine, Chicago History, which functions as a catalog for the exhibit, Mahoney writes, “Coupled with mounting casualties, Chicago’s artistic output helped change American views toward the [Vietnam] war, a profound shift in public opinion that eventually led to the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. . . . Yet, these works are usually absent from most historical accounts of the time.”\n\nThe exhibition is divided into five main sections, each focused on the art of a social movement. They are the Chicago Freedom Movement (which fought for open housing in the 1960s and was led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.); the Black Power/Black Arts movement (including the Organization for Black American Culture, or OBA-C, and AfriCOBRA); the anti–Vietnam War movement; the women’s liberation movement; and the battle for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nThere’s a lot to see, not all of it locally created. The iconic peace symbol is here, of course (did you know it was originally designed for a British nuclear disarmament campaign?), as is the Venus symbol (a circle dangling a small cross) that was the emblem of the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union and—especially doubled and interlocked—lesbian organizations. Mahoney says it was here in Chicago that the doubled Venus was linked with a doubled Mars image to represent the united gay liberation movement before the arrival of the west coast–born rainbow logo. There are buttons, posters, flags, and banners, along with some striking Ebony magazine cover portraits and the memorable political art of the Chicago Seed. (I can’t shake its February 1, 1970, death’s-head Statue of Liberty cover by Karl-Heinz Meschbach.)\n\nBut the symbol that moved most prevalently through decades of protest art is the image of a raised clenched fist. It appears in the exhibit’s brief introductory section, in a 1917 Industrial Workers of the World journal illustration, The Hand That Will Rule the World, and then reappears too many times to mention, on behalf of everything from gay liberation to environmental justice—but most notably as a symbol of the Black Power movement. Barbara Jones-Hogu’s intense and dynamic 1968 screen print, Unite, for example, is another unshakable image.\n\nAn additional concluding section features a small selection of more recent work, including Carlos Barberena’s powerful 2020 linocut portrait of George Floyd; Tonika Lewis Johnson and Janell Nelson’s 2024 Folded Map Action Kit; and William Estrada’s 2023 Education Is a Right poster (featuring a sunburst with a big clenched fist at its center), in support of public schools.\n\nThere’s nothing here about the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, but Charles Bethea, the museum’s director of curatorial affairs, says he’s hoping visitors can see the “through lines, the commonality” with current events. Especially, he adds, “since you’re talking about movements that were in full swing in the 60s and early 70s, and some of these issues we’re still arguing and addressing today.”\n\nSays Mahoney: “I just wanted to make the statement that this work continues. Some of the issues are the same, some are different, but artists and designers are continuing to play a role in social movements.”"
