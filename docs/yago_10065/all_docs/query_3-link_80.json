        "text": "At the end of ABC’s dual Bachelorette season, which starred twice the women and produced half the drama, I observed that Zach Shallcross (a second runner-up on Rachel Recchia’s side and new lead of the franchise) “looks as if he was concocted in a lab to be The Bachelor.”\n\nThose suspicions were confirmed over the course of Monday’s two-hour premiere on ABC, where “Zach the Snack,” as one contestant referred to him, meandered his way through an utterly snoozy season opener. Signs that viewers were in for a lethargic episode came early, starting with host Jesse Palmer’s totally straight-faced pitch for why Shallcross is a surprising pick: He’s “a good-looking guy, tall, ready to find a wife. But, in fact, Zach was also a DJ in college—betcha didn’t know that!”\n\nThe rest of the pre-limo exit proceedings were similarly dull. Sean Lowe, a Bachelor lead from a decade ago who is still married to his final rose recipient, Catherine, prepped Shallcross to be “the most shirtless Bachelor of all time” by lifting weights alongside him and shaving his body hair. “He has a side people haven’t seen yet,” Lowe promised, without including any details on what that might actually mean. A cover of “Can’t Help Falling in Love” played over highlights of what looks to be a paint-by-numbers season (no fence jump or rose-ceremony meltdowns here!). Meanwhile, three of the contestants declared they wanted to be “Mrs. Shallcross” in the first half hour alone.\n\nAnd with Palmer’s insistence that Shallcross “Go find a wife!” (any wife will do), 30 (largely white) women began their intrepid walks from limo to mansion. These were also frustratingly uninspired. Greer, a 24-year-old who is prone to referring to herself in the third person, presented Shallcross with a cup of coffee allegedly all the way from New York City. Twenty-six-year-old Christina Mandrell (whose mother and aunts were featured the 1980s variety show Barbara Mandrell & the Mandrell Sisters) entered via party bus. And Mercedes, a 24-year-old from Iowa, arrived with her pet pig, Henry, in tow.\n\nThe most shocking moment of the limo entrances—and dare we say, episode—was thanks to Shallcross himself. Bailey, 27, was one of the women to meet him at the Bachelorette finale back in September, where she offered the rhyme “On the daily, I’m going to be thinking of Bailey” to help Shallcross in remembering her. Moments later, when asked her name, he stumbled to say…Bailen. When reminded of this gaffe out of the limo, Shallcross insisted that Bailey had made an impression, so much so that he gave her an impromptu kiss. The moment was natural, but surprising, and full of spark. If only there had been more like them once the crew gathered inside the mansion.\n\nIn fact, any potential edge, moment of ingenuity, or even dash of insecurity was woefully missing in Shallcross for the rest of the episode. “Holy shit,” he declared upon seeing all of his suitors gathered in one room, before quickly adding, “I should not be cussing right now.” Shallcross’s opening remarks included the statement “I’m just a dude who loves family, football, and frozen pizzas,” without a hint of irony, alongside generic platitudes about searching for his “forever best friend.”\n\nDefending his casting in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Shallcross said: “The reality is, if you are someone that likes the show because you want people to find true love and an actual focus on what it’s supposed to be about—not about acting, not about this and that—then I think fans are gonna love it. If you’re into the unnecessary drama and stuff that’s just like ridiculous and doesn’t make sense, then yeah, maybe I’m not the guy for you.”\n\nBut here’s the problem. Without the “this and that,” of which Shallcross speaks, the season will survive on the strength of a bachelor’s true emotional connections to multiple contestants—think Ben Higgins telling both of his final suitors that he was in love with them. But few of his night-one conversations (or the eight kisses that resulted) yielded any chemistry. Greer, who received the first-impression rose, impressed Shallcross by touting that her parents—who met in their 20s—and both sets of grandparents were still together, and that she was dead set on moving to his hometown of Austin, Texas.\n\nThe night’s only source of predictable, seemingly producer-driven tension came from 26-year-old Madison, who in an effort to establish herself early stole Shallcross twice, danced the Griddy with him, and pulled him in for an ill-advised peck. “The kiss sat wrong with me,” Shallcross admitted as Madison cried on the mansion steps. She was the episode’s sacrificial lamb, getting a stammering breakup from Shallcross only when prompted to share his true feelings.\n\nIn its 27th season, The Bachelor has never felt more like a relic of the reality-dating-series space—a milquetoast relative of Love Island or Love Is Blind, which cast (slightly more) diverse contestants and evolve their formats accordingly.\n\nWhile the show has long had problems with diverse casting, they were more prominently displayed during Matt James’s season as the franchise’s first Black Bachelor, when ABC was eager to make a public corrective following widespread Black Lives Matter protests. James gave his final rose to Rachael Kirkconnell, who was accused of past racist behavior (for which she publicly apologized). Longtime host Chris Harrison’s apparent defense of Kirkconnell and diatribe against cancel culture ultimately led to his ouster.\n\nSeemingly reeling from the fallout, recent seasons have been a mixed bag trending downwards. Michelle Young’s time as Bachelorette felt like a breath of fresh—if a bit too considered for reality TV—air. Clayton Echard’s season was ill-conceived and, ultimately, memorable only for its dumpster-fire ending. And the double-Bachelorette attempt failed to deliver either drama or deep connections.\n\nThis time around, ABC has opted for the safest route possible, which could be their biggest misstep of all. A lead without a compelling narrative will require the women (and producers) to do all of the heavy lifting. Whether they’ll be up for reviving this comatose franchise remains to be seen—that is, by those still watching."
