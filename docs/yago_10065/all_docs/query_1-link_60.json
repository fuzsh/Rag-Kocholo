        "text": "Nelson George & Opinions on Eminem and Passion Pit\n\nAuthor and critic Nelson George talks with Jim and Greg about his new book City Kid: A Writer’s Memoir of Ghetto Life and Post-Soul Success. Later Jim and Greg review Eminem's new album \"Relapse.\"\n\naudio player Download Subscribe via iTunes\n\nMusic News\n\nAfter much debate, France has passed its three strikes law against filesharers. That means that if you are caught illegally downloading three times your internet could be shut down. It also signals an alliance between the French government and the record industry, and according to the EU, a limiting of personal freedom.\n\nSpeaking of limited personal freedom, the Chinese government continues to hinder access to popular music. Eager to curb potential protests, China's Ministry of Culture has cancelled major Oasis shows and moved the major MIDI festival from centrally located Beijing. Jim is not usually a fan of censorship, but actually favors an Oasis crackdown.\n\nWhile we in this country have been busy with American Idol, Europeans were anxiously anticipating the winner of the biggest song contest in the world. This year's Eurovision winner is Alexander Rybeck of Norway. More than 100 million people watched his song \"Fairytale\" take the crown. Of course, Jim and Greg don't take this contest too seriously, but it's nice to know that the love of schlock pop is universal.\n\nNelson George\n\nMusic critic, author and screenwriter Nelson George joins Jim and Greg on the show this week. His many books have become cornerstones on American thinking about hip hop, soul and pop music. Now he has a new book out called City Kid: A Writer’s Memoir of Ghetto Life and Post-Soul Success. After years of exploring the lives of others, including Chris Rock, James Brown and Russell Simmons, Nelson took himself on as a subject. He relays his experience growing up in Brownsville. Music and art gave him a way to experience the outside world and later became his ticket to success. He even made his way to Hollywood, writing and producing the hip hop parody film CB4.\n\nRelapse Eminem\n\nOne of hip hop’s most successful artists is Eminem. After a five-year wait, he's back with a new album called Relapse. The Detroit rapper has again sought help from producer Dr. Dre, and is again relying on violence and misogyny to shock and entertain listeners. The problem-it's not so shocking anymore. Both Jim and Greg were bored by this record, and Greg hears boredom in Eminem's own voice. Perhaps Em should try a little good taste for a change. He gets a double Trash It.\n\nManners Passion Pit\n\nThe next album up for review is Manners, the debut from Boston-based Passion Pit. The electro-pop quintet is helmed by Michael Angelakos. It's his falsetto that dominates the album, in addition to the lush, swirling synths. In fact, the music is a little too lush and sugary for Mr. Kot, who wishes there were a few more moments of calm. He gives Manners a Try It rating. Jim was certain Greg would be all over this record. He hears the music as a successful, indie take on '80s disco and gives the album a Buy It.\n\nJim\n\nJim and Greg’s choices for the Desert Island Jukebox are often influenced by current events or discussion in an episode. But this week, Jim just wanted to hear some Buzzcocks. Their album Singles Going Steady is one of the great compilation albums of all time. But the one great single that didn't make it on is the band's 1979 song \"I Believe.\" Is it a manifesto? Or just a joke? Jim doesn't know, but he'll be happy listening over and over again.\n\nFeatured Songs\n\nSerge Gainsbourg, \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Bonnie and Clyde, Fontana, 1968\n\nRun DMC, \"It's Like That,\" Run-DMC, Arista, 1984\n\nMartha & the Vandellas, \"Heat Wave,\" Heat Wave, Gordy, 1963\n\nJay-Z, \"Heart of the City,\" The Blueprint, Roc-A-Fella, 2001\n\nKurtis Blow, \"The Breaks,\" Kurtis Blow, Mercury, 1980\n\nTeddy Pendergrass, \"Turn Off The Lights,\" Teddy, Legacy, 1979\n\nGrandmaster Flash, \"The Message,\" The Message, Sugar Hill, 1982\n\nNWA, \"Straight Outta Compton,\" Straight Outta Compton, Ruthless, 1988\n\nWhitney Houston, \"Saving All My Love For You,\" Whitney Houston, Arista, 1985\n\nMichael Jackson, \"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough,\" Off the Wall, Epic,1979\n\nDr. Dre, \"Nuthin' But a \"G\" Thang,\" The Chronic, Priority, 1992\n\nBadia, \"Danger,\" Donne l'alerte, Le Son'Art, 2009\n\nJ*Davey, \"Hi Sun,\" The Beauty in Distortion, Interdependent Media, 2008\n\nSkull Gang, \"I am the Club,\" Skull Gang, eOne Music, 2009\n\nEminem, \"Crack a Bottle,\" Relapse, Aftermath Entertainment, 2009\n\nEminem, \"My Mom,\" Relapse, Aftermath Entertainment, 2009\n\nPassion Pit, \"Sleepyhead,\" Manners, Frenchkiss, 2009\n\nPassion Pit, \"The Reeling,\" Manners, Frenchkiss, 2009\n\nPassion Pit, \"Swimming in the Flood,\" Manners, Frenchkiss, 2009\n\nThe Buzzcocks, \"I Believe,\" A Different Kind of Tension, United Artists, 1979\n\nJohnny Thunders & the Heartbreakers, \"Get off the Phone,\" Single, Beggars Banquet, 1979\n\nWillie Nelson, \"A Song for You,\" Willie and Family Live, Columbia, 1978\n\nGreen Day, \"Last Night On Earth,\" 21st Century Breakdown, Reprise, 2009\n\nJohn Lennon, \"Isolation,\" John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, Apple, 1970\n\nFootnotes\n\nFrance passes law against filesharers\n\nChinese authorities cancel Oasis performance\n\nAlexander Rybak\n\nNelson George\n\nEminem\n\nDr. Dre\n\nPassion Pit\n\nBuzzcocks\n\nDear Listeners,\n\nFor more than 15 years, Sound Opinions was a production of WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Now that the show is independent, we're inviting you to join the band and lend a hand! We need your support more than ever because now we have to do all the behind-the-scenes work that WBEZ handled before (like buying insurance and paying for podcast hosting, ugh). Plus, we have some exciting ideas we'd like to try now that there's no one to tell us no!\n\nPlease consider becoming a Sound Opinions member by giving whatever you can via Patreon or with a one-time donation through PayPal. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support!"
