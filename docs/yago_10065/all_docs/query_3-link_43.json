        "text": "Our International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day documentaries are appropriate for most middle and high school–aged children to watch with a guardian. They are not intended for children under 12, or for children or adolescents who are currently struggling or suicidal. Guardians, please use your best judgment when deciding whether to let those in your care view these films.\n\nIn the 2023 documentary Healing Together: Culture, Community and Suicide Loss, three families share how they navigated the loss of their young loved one to suicide. Throughout the film, families reflect on their approaches to grief and the healing process, while also acknowledging the importance of community and culture. Their insights show that, through resilience and support, suicide loss survivors can find understanding, meaning, and even joy in their lives while continuing to honor the lives of those they have lost.\n\nWatch the trailer for Healing Together or view the film in its entirety below.\n\nPathways to Healing: Hope after Suicide Loss follows the family and friends of Chris Taddeo, a young adult who died by suicide. Together, they show the individual experiences a community of people can have after a shared loss: from confusion and denial, to isolation and finding support. Through their various approaches to grief and healing, each journey shares a message of hope, connection and resilience.\n\nWatch the trailer for Pathways to Healing: Hope after Suicide Lossor view the film in its entirety below.\n\nA Daughter’s Journey follows Sarah, a young adult, through her story of milestones, family, coping and positive growth after the loss of her father. She shares her story of hope, connection and resilience in the aftermath of a suicide loss.\n\nWatch the trailer for A Daughter’s Journey or view the film in its entirety below.\n\nLife Journeys, the third in AFSP’s Journey series of films about suicide loss, traces the grief and healing journey that follows a suicide loss over time. Drawing on stories and insights from long-term loss survivors, the film shows us that through resilience and support we can achieve hope and understanding in our lives while celebrating the lives of those we lost.\n\nThe documentary was first screened on Survivor Day 2016 at over 350 events worldwide.\n\nWatch the trailer for Life Journeys or watch the film in its entirety below.\n\nFamily Journeys is the second in a series of AFSP-produced documentaries on suicide loss. It traces the ripple effects of a suicide through the eyes and experiences of three families, and shows how the members of each family are weathering the loss of their loved one, how they’re healing, and how they’re finding meaning again after living through a suicide. The film was first screened on Survivor Day 2015 at over 300 healing events around the world.\n\nWatch the trailer for Family Journeys or view the film in its entirety below.\n\nAFSP’s documentary The Journey, which was produced for Survivor Day 2014, tells the stories of a diverse group of suicide loss survivors. It’s a compelling film that shows how each survivor is weathering the loss of a loved one, and how they are finding their way back to a life rich in meaning—and even joy.\n\nIn The Journey Revisited, a follow-up featurette to The Journey that was produced for Survivor Day 2017, six of the original film’s participants gather three years later to reflect on their grief and healing journey with the insight and perspective that their continued experience has afforded them.\n\nWatch the trailer for The Journey and the trailer for The Journey Revisited or view the films in their entirety below."
