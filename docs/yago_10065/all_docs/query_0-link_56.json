        "text": "As the Washington cliche goes:Personnel is policy. And while most of the focus on Vice President Kamala Harris is on her newly minted presidential campaign, it’s just as important to pay attention to the new people entering the Harris political orbit.\n\nWhile Harris has kept the campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., far from Harris’ hometown in the Bay Area, she has started to put her own spin on the campaign operations — bringing in advisers close to her, even though they’ll be working under Jen O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair whom Biden hired early this year, reports Jewish Insider senior national correspondent Gabby Deutch.\n\nSo far, Harris’ early hires include a mix of her own loyalists as well as strategists who had worked closely with former President Barack Obama, seeking to harness some of the grassroots energy of his 2008 and 2012 campaigns. (O’Malley Dillon also held a senior role on Obama’s 2012 campaign.) David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s 2008 campaign and served as a top adviser to him in 2012, is now a senior adviser to Harris.\n\nPhil Gordon, Harris’ longtime national security adviser, will be receiving a lot more attention. (JI profiled Gordon last December, noting the vice president has consistently “offered tougher words for Israel than President Joe Biden.”)\n\nOther new additions to the Harris campaign include close allies that hearken back to Harris’ West Coast roots. Brian Nelson, who has served as the Treasury Department’s point person on sanctions and terrorism financing since 2021, has left government to serve as a senior policy adviser to Harris; he previously worked for Harris when she was California attorney general and remained close to her while she served in the Senate.\n\nSoon after Oct. 7, Nelson gave a speech outlining the Treasury Department’s goal of going after those funding Hamas. Otherwise, little is known about where he stands on major policy issues; before joining the Biden administration, Nelson was the chief legal officer of the organizing committee for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso joining Team Harris — unofficially — is Tony West, Harris’ brother-in-law and chief legal officer at Uber. Last week he formally took a leave from that role to support Harris, although he will serve as an unofficial adviser and “family-member surrogate,” according to an email he wrote to Uber employees.\n\nWest served as associate attorney general in the Obama administration. West’s wife, Harris’ sister Maya, served as a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. Maya, a former attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, helped burnish Harris’ progressive bona fides in her 2020 campaign, when she attempted to court criminal justice reformers after a career as a prosecutor.\n\nPeople like West, Nelson and Maya Harris may not be household names to anyone but the most politically tuned-in Washingtonians, but advisers like them can have an outsized impact on key policy positions Harris will take.\n\nThe biggest question facing Harris’ campaign is where Harris stands on key issues. Will she break with Biden on any key issues? How would she govern as president? What is her foreign policy worldview, and how deep is her support for the U.S.-Israel alliance? The public is watching Harris to figure out her vision. Behind the scenes, a new team of strategists is helping her shape it.\n\nFor several weeks, the City of Chicago has been sitting on a request from a pro-Israel group to hold a solidarity march during the Democratic National Convention, even as it has granted permission for a coalition of pro-Palestinian activists to demonstrate when the proceedings kick off later this month. The Israeli American Council, a nonprofit organization representing Israeli-Americans that seeks to strengthen ties between the U.S. and Israel, filed two applications with Chicago’s Department of Transportation at the beginning of July, according to Aya Schechter, the group’s chief programming officer. But with just under two weeks remaining until the convention, the IAC has yet to receive an answer from the city, despite following up via phone and email, Jewish Insider’s Matthew Kassel reports.\n\nUnbalanced treatment?: For Schechter, the so far unsuccessful effort to secure a desirable permit ahead of the convention, which is expected to draw thousands of anti-Israel protesters, has underscored what she characterized as unbalanced treatment as her group seeks to show support for Israel and the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. “It seems like we don’t have equitable access to whatever the other group was approved for,” she said in an interview with JI earlier this week, voicing frustration with the city’s delay. “We didn’t get any offer to do a march, not even in an alternative location.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHamas named its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, as the head of its political bureau on Tuesday, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, who is believed to be living in Hamas’ massive tunnel system ever since, was released from Israeli prison in 2011 in a swap for kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit and has been the head of Hamas’ Gaza operations since 2017. He is now the head of the entire terrorist organization, directing its war against Israel from Gaza and its international relations – including negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of the 115 hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza, Jewish Insider’s Lahav Harkov reports.\n\nSinwar’s sights: Khaled Abu Toameh, an expert on Palestinian affairs at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, said that rather than rewarding Sinwar, Hamas’ leadership abroad may be trying to distance itself from him, “by saying ‘you launched Oct. 7 on your own, you continue now.’ I see it as consolidating the risk.” Sinwar “despised” Haniyeh, his deputy Khalil al Hayya and Haniyeh’s predecessor, Khaled Mashaal, Abu Toameh told JI. Sinwar and his allies “say ‘we are the ones in Gaza, we went to Israeli prison, you [Hamas leaders abroad] didn’t. We are paying the price … and you are abroad enjoying a good life,’” Abu Toameh said. As such, Sinwar, his brother Mohammed Sinwar, a senior Hamas commander, and Mohammed Deif, the commander of Hamas’ military, who Israel killed last month, “completed a coup [they] have been waging to take over Hamas in recent years,” Abu Toameh said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHaving Israel’s Back?: Michael Oren, Israel’s former Ambassador to the U.S., writes in the Times of Israel: “With war looming, Israel must determine to what degree America will have our back. We must know the extent to which the United States will help defend us irrespective of whether we retaliate against Iranian aggression or strike Iran preemptively. Needed now is the clear and consistent US policy often lacking in the last ten months. For all its dangers, the present crisis offers a unique opportunity to deter Iran and strengthen the regional alliance against it. America, too, can emerge with its reputation as a reliable ally and formidable superpower restored. By staying the course and acting in effective concert against Iran, the US and Israel can change the course of Middle East history.” [TimesofIsrael]\n\nCori’s Story: In Commentary, Seth Mandel holds up the reportedly embellished and misrepresented story Cori Bush told about helping up a Jewish activist backing her opponent who fell over at a fundraiser as a “weird fabrication” that provides insight into her handling of the Israel issue. “But when St. Louis Magazine looked into the story, they found that Bush had taken some artistic license when retelling it. The woman in the story was actually Debbie Kitchen, who is neither Jewish nor AIPAC-affiliated. ‘It just blew my mind,’ Kitchen told St. Louis. ‘Then to find out that she raised $30,000 that night—I was livid.’ … This was not an innocent mistake, then. It was an egregious lie told to manifest Jews as the enemy in any situation in which Cori Bush faces opposition. This is what voters have seen and is indicative of the kind of nonsense that likely cost Bush her seat in the House. It’s easier in retrospect to see this, in part because Bush has let the mask slip completely. Now that she’s been tossed out of the House, she says, the gloves are off. In that same concession speech (if ever the term ‘concession’ were used generously, it is here), Bush ranted: ‘As much as I love my job, all [AIPAC] did was radicalize me and so now they need to be afraid.’” [Commentary]\n\nAxios reports that Israel told the U.S. that if Hezbollah harms Israeli civilians as part of its anticipated retaliatory attack, the Israel Defense Force’s response would be disproportionate. Israeli officials speculated the terror group could try to target IDF headquarters in the center of Tel Aviv or the Mossad headquarters and other intelligence bases in northern Tel Aviv…\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog released a videotaped message to communities across the world in reaction to the threat of an Iranian attack: “We carry another most precious resource, the remarkable resilience of our people. A resilience which is rooted in the deep sense of connection and shared destiny that we have shared all across the ages. It is what has enabled us to get back up and rebuild after even the worst tragedies, and it is what we lean into right now,” Herzog said in his speech…\n\nThe U.S. has launched roughly 800 missiles and seven rounds of air strikes in the past year against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. On Wednesday, Vice Adm. George Wikoff, commander of Naval Forces Central Command, said the Houthis are well armed and have strong and consistent supply lines into Iran, “and are looking for a reason to use it”…\n\nAfter two months of stating that the onus to accept a cease-fire-for-hostages deal rests on Hamas, two top Biden administration officials said on Wednesday that neither side has agreed to the latest iteration of the deal. “The deal hasn’t been accepted because neither side has signed up to it,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said…\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has “grown increasingly upset about Vice President Kamala Harris’ surging poll numbers and media coverage since replacing Biden on the ticket, complaining relentlessly and asking friends about how his campaign is performing,” the Washington Post reports…\n\nSenior Democrats are floating Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) as a top secretary of state contender in a potential Harris administration, and Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) as a leading candidate to serve as secretary of defense. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) is also mentioned as a secretary of state possibility…\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, spoke in 2019 at a “Challenging Islamophobia” conference sponsored by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), where he posed for a picture with Hatem Bazian, an antisemitic scholar who has defended anti-Israel terrorist activity…\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), the GOP vice-presidential nominee, frequently texted with far-right blogger Charles Johnson, who has made comments casting doubt on the Holocaust, about a wide range of issues after he was elected to the Senate, according to the Washington Post. Vance pushed back on Johnson’s criticism of Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the conversations. “Publicly and privately not a single rep of the Israeli government has sounded as insane as our neocons,” Vance wrote to Johnson.\n\nJohnson said he leaked the texts because he grew disillusioned with Vance’s pro-Israel views, and told the paper he now supports Vice President Kamala Harris…\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) spoke to reporters about the ouster of President Joe Biden from the presidential race and the pain it caused her as a longtime friend of the president. “So we are friends for a very long time. I love him so much. We pray together. I cry over it, I lose sleep over it and the rest, but that’s what evolved,” the Washington Post quoted Pelosi as saying…\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) shared on social media a doctored poll falsely claiming that 47% of Israelis believe that IDF soldiers are allowed to rape Palestinians…\n\nRahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, will not attend this year’s atomic bombing memorial service in Nagasaki because Israel was not invited…\n\nThe American Jewish Committeecriticized “blatant discrimination” in the decision to ban the Israel’s youth ultimate frisbee teams from the European Youth Ultimate Championship in Belgium, following anti-Israel vandalism at the sporting venue and threats of protest that led to their exclusion for “safety concerns”…\n\nThe U.S. Army is revamping its missile-defense strategy to counter a wide variety of complex threats expected in the 2040 time period…\n\nIsraelrevoked the diplomatic accreditation of eight Norwegian diplomats based in Tel Aviv, who serve in Norway’s representative office in the Palestinian Authority, citing a “series of anti-Israel” steps taken by the country including its recognition of a Palestinian state…\n\nBritain’s largest private-sector pension fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme, has sold £80 m. of Israeli assets, the Financial Times reports…\n\nThree Taylor Swift shows in Vienna have been canceled after police narrowly thwarted an ISIS plot to attack her Eras Tour shows…\n\nPolitico’s Playbook newsletter included Hamas terrorist leader Yahya Sinwar in its “Transitions” section noting promotions and job changes for political and policy professionals…"
