        "text": "FOR LOVE & LIFE: NO ORDINARY CAMPAIGN is a documentary film that follows Brian Wallach, who at 37, was diagnosed with ALS on the same day he and his wife Sandra brought their youngest daughter home from the hospital. With major support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the film highlights Brian and Sandra’s fight to remake a healthcare system for their own future — and for the millions of other patients living with rare and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nNearly 7,000 rare diseases, including ALS, affect 300 million people worldwide. CZI’s Rare As One Project supports patient advocates like Brian who are leading groundbreaking movements to find treatments and cures for rare diseases. Presented by Amazon MGM Studios, a LIMA CHARLIE PRODUCTION, “FOR LOVE & LIFE: NO ORDINARY CAMPAIGN” will debut on Amazon on May 28. Watch the trailer here.\n\n###\n\nAbout the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education, to addressing the needs of our communities. Through collaboration, providing resources and building technology, our mission is to help build a more inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.
