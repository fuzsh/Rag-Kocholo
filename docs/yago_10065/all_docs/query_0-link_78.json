        "text": "Steveston's waterfront is once again being featured in a recent Netflix show.\n\nDead Boy Detectives, a Netflix show following the lives of teenage ghosts running a paranormal-mystery-solving agency, features scenes filmed at the Steveston Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nIn the show’s first episode, a trio of characters arrive at “Port Townsend” for the first time, walking along the historic waterfront and featuring the area’s iconic buildings and slanted roofs.\n\nThis location hosts several restaurants, as well as landmarks like the Gulf of Georgia Cannery and Britannia Shipyards.\n\nOther fragments of the show were also filmed across the Lower Mainland, including Vancouver, Surrey and Langley.\n\nNetflix in Your Neighbourhood is a website created to help fans discover the various Canadian locations showcased in their productions, with more than 40 titles included to date.\n\nRichmond’s cultural and geographic diversity has made it a popular location for film productions, according to the city, hosting six film studio facilities and contributing around $28 million to the local economy.\n\nIn 2023, around 40 location agreements were signed in Richmond, despite labour strikes in industry."
