        "text": "The animated movie \"Migration\" will be screened in Prince George on Aug. 26 as part of the Beem Credit Union's Moonlight Movie Tour.\n\nAdmission is by donation. Proceeds will go to the Prince George Child Development Centre.\n\nThe film can be seen at the Park Drive-In Theatre, 9660 Raceway Road. Gates open at 7:30 p.m. and the movie starts at 9 p.m. It's the first time Prince George has been on the tour.\n\n\"Migration,\" starring the voices of Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina and Danny DeVito, is the story of a family of ducks who attempt to migrate from New England, through New York City, to Jamaica.\n\nBeem Credit Union, formed through the merger of Gulf and Fraser and Interior Savings (which has two branches in Prince George), is hosting the tour across the province from Aug. 27 to Aug. 29. The financial institution partners with non-profits in each community, and since 2008 has raised more than $210,000.\n\nWhile the Prince George event takes place at a drive-in theatre, other stops on the tour will see a large screen set up in an outdoor location, like a park. All the films being shown are recently released family-friendly animated movies.\n\nOther stops along the tour include Fort St. John, which will host a movie night Aug. 17 with \"Kung Fu Panda 4\" at Centennial Park. Proceeds from that will go to the North Peace Gymnastics Association. Other communities will see the movie \"Elemental.\"\n\nThe farthest north the tour goes is Fort Nelson on Aug. 21. Other communities being visited include Kelowna, West Kelowna, Barriere, Kamloops, Lilooet and more."
