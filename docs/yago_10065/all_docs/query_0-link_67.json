She served in a multitude of ministerial positions and vied once for party leadership.\n\n“My long involvement in the Saskatchewan community has led to a firm commitment to close working relationships between government and all sectors of our society,” read her announcement.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCrofford will battle it out with fellow candidate Jessie Morris, a teacher and librarian. Incumbent Cheryl Stadnichuk announced she will not seek re-election.\n\nMorris’ campaign website lists fiscal responsibility, housing access and environmental sustainability as policy priorities.\n\nWard 2\n\nBob Hawkins, first elected in 2012, is running again for another four years against university marketing manager Chidi Igwe and local business owner George Tsiklis. All three declared in June.\n\nWard 3\n\nThis spring, Coun. Andrew Stevens announced he does not intend to run for a third term in Ward 3.\n\nThe only alternative currently vying for the vacancy is David Froh, vice-president of the Regina Food Bank who was previously with Economic Development Regina.\n\nWard 4\n\nCharles Umeh, a local film producer and adviser at Creative Saskatchewan, intends to challenge incumbent Lori Bresciani for Ward 4. Bresciani ran unopposed in 2020, and has yet to state her plans for this fall.\n\nWard 5\n\nCurrent councillor John Findura also hasn’t publicly declared whether he will seek a sixth term to represent Ward 5 and no other hopefuls have put their names forward for Ward 5 as of Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWard 6\n\nFirst elected in 2020, lawyer Dan LeBlanc will run for a third time in Ward 6. Currently, he stands alone on the ballot.\n\nWard 7\n\nFirst-time councillor Terina Nelson is looking for a second term as the representative of Ward 7. Nelson’s priorities include seeing “taxpayer dollars used wisely” and “championing initiatives to improve parks, infrastructure and public services,” according to her election announcement.\n\nSo far, Nelson will face off once again with Shobna Radons, president of the Regina and District Labour Council, for a second election cycle in a row.\n\nWard 8\n\nShanon Zachidniak announced in mid-July that she will be seek re-election in Ward 8.\n\n“I plan to continue championing transparency, accountability, responsible spending, environmental sustainability, and building an inclusive and vibrant community,” she said.\n\nNo other candidates have yet announced plans to challenge her.\n\nWard 9\n\nIncumbent Jason Mancinelli told the Leader-Post in June he has not yet made a decision on whether to run for a third term in Ward 9, but other hopefuls have emerged.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJeff Soroka, a former RCMP constable and civil engineer, will take another swing at it, having run previously in 2020.\n\nIn an email to the Leader-Post, Soroka cited turnover in top city administration and financial transparency for taxpayer dollars as top concerns that led to his decision.\n\nTanis Wilder will also be on the ballot, claiming the ward “needs an advocate for the northwest on city council.”\n\nWilder, currently the acting associate dean for the faculty of digital innovation at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, said her focus will be on improving core services and addressing rising property taxes.\n\nWard 10\n\nCandidate hopeful Tara Jijian announced her intention to run for Ward 10 in a short message posted on social media.\n\n“I am looking forward to working with various committees and representing the residents,” stated the post.\n\nJijian ran as a Saskatchewan Liberal party candidate in 2016, later serving as the provincial party’s interim leader from 2017 to 2018.
