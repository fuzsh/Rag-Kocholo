        "text": "UPDATE: Mamie Laverock, the 19-year-old actor who went on life support after she fell five stories from a balcony, is “out of her big surgeries” as doctors say “she is doing well,” according to the GoFundMe page set up by her parents. “It’s impossible for us to be happier,” they wrote. “Thank you for all your support.”\n\nLaverock, known for her role as Rosaleen Sullivan across several episodes of the Hallmark Channel series “When Calls the Heart,” was hospitalized earlier in May due to an undisclosed “medical emergency.” After spending two weeks in “intensive treatment,” Laverock “was escorted out of a secure unit of the hospital and taken up to a balcony walkway from which she fell five stories,” per her parents, Rob and Nicole Compton.\n\n“She sustained life threatening injuries, has undergone multiple extensive surgeries and is currently on life support,” Laverock’s parents wrote. “We are all devastated, in shock, at this intensely difficult time.”\n\nAccording to the GoFundMe campaign, Laverock’s mother traveled to Winnipeg, Canada, on May 11 to help Laverock with a “medical emergency.” “Nicole was able to get there in time to save her life,” the description reads. Laverock was then transferred to a hospital in Vancouver. At the time, her parents wrote that “her recovery is unclear” but “she is alive and is showing signs of improvement.”\n\nHallmark Media responded to the accident with a statement to Variety: “We are deeply saddened to hear the news about Mamie. As a beloved member of our When Calls the Heart community, we wish her and her family peace, comfort, and many prayers during this difficult time.”\n\nLaverock fell off of a balcony on May 26, more than two weeks after her initial hospitalization. The details of Laverock’s medical emergency are unclear.\n\nAs of this publication, the fundraiser has collected more than $14,500 to aid in Laverock’s recovery.\n\nLaverock’s “When Calls the Heart” co-stars have shown support for the young actor on social media. Erin Krakow boosted the GoFundMe page on her Instagram, writing, “I just donated. If you have the means to do so, I hope you will too.” Johannah Newmarch also shared the link on X, writing, “I love this family, my heart is broken. A devastating time for all who care for Mamie. Please help if you can. They need all the support they can get to make it through this.” Loretta Walsh similarly promoted the fundraiser, writing, “Please donate and share if you can. Mamie and her family need our support. Link in bio. Thank you.”\n\nLaverock appeared in nine episodes of “When the Heart Calls” from 2014 to 2023, including the premiere episode. Her other credits include “This Means War,” “A Series of Unfortunate Events” and “The Hollow Child.”"
