        "text": "It was a busy summer at YU and we remain an East Oakland oasis serving and supporting thousands of youth and community members! YU continued advancing its mission to transform East Oakland into a healthy and economically robust community through developing young leaders, offering hands on assistance with educational goals, career growth, work experience, mental and physical wellness, and providing access to critical resources that meet their basic needs.\n\nSpecifically, this summer YU:\n\nEmployed and trained over 100 youth through our Career & Education Department in partnership with the City of Oakland and a host of community minded businesses.\n\nSustained and grew our social enterprises, employing young adults in the fields of food service, landscaping, and janitorial work.\n\nExpanded wellness services, providing nearly 200 hours of mental health services to young people.\n\nRe-established our Community Care program, providing groceries to nearly 150 families.\n\nLaunched YU's Baby Care program, providing a range of supports, from diapers to parent-child play groups\n\nCelebrated YU's 15th Annual Back Pack Give Away, providing necessary school supplies to Middle and High School students\n\nAt 17, Brandy is a senior at Castlemont High School and East Oakland resident full of promise. She aspires to be a mechanical engineer and YU is wrapping around her to ensure her success. Our leadership development program has involved Brandy in community efforts to develop creative housing solutions for the homeless. And, YU's Career & Education Program is working with her to make sure she's prepared to attend the Historically Black College of her choice -- she's already been accepted to Dillard University. Brandy's newfound confidence coupled with YU supports gives her the opportunities she deserves to fulfill her potential.\n\nYU recently hosted Misty Copeland, who made history as the first African American Female Principal Dancer with the prestigious American Ballet Theatre.\n\nMisty, whose husband is an Oakland native, was in town to learn more about Oakland's unique Turf Dancing culture and share her experience as a pioneer in American dance. She was joined by author and filmmaker Nelson George (CB4, The Get Down, Strictly Business) in a meeting with YU alumni The Turf Feinz and their proteges Turf Inc.\n\nThe gathering enjoyed an afternoon of rich discussion about the power of artistic expression, the history of Oakland originated dance styles, and the importance of creating spaces to celebrate young artists.\n\nIt was an honor to have Misty and Nelson join us to learn more about Turfin’ an art form that is deeply entrenched in not only our legacy, but also Oakland’s.\n\nYU was born out of youth leadership development, with young people initially leading in all aspects of moving YU from vision to a reality. Our commitment to youth empowerment continues today with YU’s in-house youth leadership team, Rise-Up.\n\nThe current Rise-Up team, supported by Brooklyn Williams, is focused on executing high impact community service projects. Through our extensive training program Rise-Up Members learn leadership and life skills. They practice prioritization of the issues that affect their neighborhoods, and how best to design and execute campaigns to improve the policies underlying those issues.\n\nLook out for more updates on Rise-Up's efforts to transform East Oakland.\n\nYU Hosts Castlemont's Registration Day\n\nCastlemont High School, adjacent to YU, has always been a core partner. Over the years, as both YU and Castlemont have evolved, so has our collaborative relationship. In September, YU again hosted Castlemont students and staff for their Back-To-School Registration Day. This year, we were thrilled to support Michael Scott as the new principal of Castlemont. Mr. Scott, in his former role as AP, has been a leader on campus for many years. It is with great expectations that his promotion enables us to deepen and expand this long standing partnership with our neighbor."
