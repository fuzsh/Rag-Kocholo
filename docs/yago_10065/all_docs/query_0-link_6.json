        "text": "In Brooklyn, New York, the former crack addicted Ana Wallace is HIV positive and is a volunteer in the Life Support, an organization that promotes a fight against AIDS in the African American community.\n\nAna wanders through the streets handing out condoms and helping people with AIDS through lectures and advices.\n\nWell meaning though it doesn't always hit its mark.\n\nThe movie has a good story to it but the style made it feel more like a video you would watch in high school to be scared from whatever they wanted you scared of that week.\n\nThe end credits were beautiful.\n\nThis movie was super compelling and emotional. Definitely certified Queen Latifah’s place as one of the most talented people in Hollywood. One thing I wish this movie did was show addiction as a product of the systems of oppression the characters faced rather than their individual choices leading them down an unlikely path. However, this movie did do an amazing job of humanizing HIV patients and emphasizing how it is a prevalent issue amongst black women + LGBTQ+ communities alike (hence why they don’t care to do extensive treatment research). I was really touched by the work Ana does at the hiv center, she is so open about sex education and I love to see that in movies. This movie…\n\nThis was a fine, workman like film, if that makes sense. There wasn't really anything surprising here, just some solid performances with a solid story. It didn't jump out at me - I dunno what it was missing to really take it a step further into something great. The suspenseful subplot didn't really catch me. It just mostly felt like regular people having to deal with some unregular shit, but in a competent way.\n\nI did wince a bit when the doctor prescribed a recovering drug addict Vicodin for her chronic foot pain. in the opioid epidemic present, that was a big yikes.\n\nNovember 2022 Ranked\n\nI enjoyed this film and Queen Latifah in her role. The movie reminded me of the struggles that positive folks must deal with on a daily basis (economic hardship, homelessness, having to take daily medication that comes with side effects, deciding when and how to tell a potential partner about their status, etc.) It seemed like it was meant to be fear/anxiety-inducing at times and was also a bit sensational, but I enjoyed the movie nonetheless.\n\n(Directed by Nelson George.)"
