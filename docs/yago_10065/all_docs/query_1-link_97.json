        "text": "In Nelson George’s legendary tome, The Death of Rhythm and Blues, he sets forth a very interesting premise. George, a long-time music critic, writer and movie producer, tracks African American popular music in the book and the African American creative power behind those forms.\n\nBeginning with “race music” (records by Black artists playing Black creative forms), George provides a history of racism in America through the prism of music and the music industry. It is all here: Blues, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Soul, Funk, and then at the end Hip-hop. Yet, George also includes discussions on how white artists eventually began to record and perform these African American music forms in softer, watered-down forms at the behest of their record companies."
