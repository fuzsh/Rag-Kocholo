        "text": "Manager Nelson Jardim insists a major squad overhaul and change of playing style at Newport County this season is not a \"gamble\".\n\nThe League Two club has seen a dozen players leave over the summer with a similar number of recruits to Rodney Parade.\n\nJardim, who takes the reins at a Football League club for the first time, has set his sights on a âcomfortable seasonâ.\n\nâItâs not a gamble because we know exactly what we want,\" said the Portuguese former Swansea City and Birmingham City assistant.\n\nâWe are not trying things, we are actually putting a plan in place. That will take time we know that.â\n\nJardim replaced previous boss Graham Coughlan at the start of pre-season, having initially been appointed as lead coach, before being elevated to the head coach role by Chairman Huw Jenkins, who employed Jardim as a coach at Swansea.\n\nJenkins has instigated a change of style to a more possession based game and Jardim has had to incorporate 13 new players, including the most recent acquisition of 6â4â striker Hamzad Kargbo.\n\nBut despite mixed pre-season results, Jardim has been pleased with the way the squad has gelled and made clear the need for comfort this campaign did not mean a lack of ambition.\n\nâWe are looking for a comfortable season, that comfort gives you more time to keep on working on the style, focussing on what we can control, which is how we play.\n\nâThat is probably the main point for the season, to make sure there is a clarity in the way we go about the games and our style. We are looking to play football, to get control of the ball.\n\nâWe know that is hard but we believe it will provide us a clear and good way to make sure we reach our goals. That will give us a comfortable place in the table to again keep on working on our style.â\n\nNewport, who finished 18th last season, kick of the campaign with their shortest trip of the season as they travel to play Cheltenham Town, managed by former manager Michael Flynn who Jardim admitted did a âgreat jobâ in his time at the Exiles.\n\nThe club are expected to take a sizeable travelling support, and as they embark on a new approach Jardim said: âWe need everyone to be connected with the idea especially the fans. They will be massive, we need their energy.\n\n\"I am sure they will be happy with the way things are going, they will be happy with the way players play, happy with the way the players show their commitment, aggression and desire to play a good game and provide to the fans good afternoons.\"\n\nNewport have fitness worries over midfielder Bryn Morris, who will be assessed for a tendon problem.\n\nJardim said he would not have a sleepless night before his big day.\n\nâYou need a big sleep before a big game. You need that to make sure you are fresh and take the best decisions you can take.â"
