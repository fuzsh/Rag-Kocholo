        "text": "Queen Latifah never does the expected. So when asked about the challenges of playing an HIV-positive wife and mother, as she does in HBO's \"Life Support,\" her answer was, indeed, surprising.\n\n\"The only challenge was trying to stay in character when you've got people driving past you on the street going, 'Queen!' 'Do it Latifah!' 'That's LATIFAH!\"' she says of the on-location shoot in Brooklyn last year for HBO's \"Life Support\" (March 10, 8 p.m., with an HBO On Demand preview available Feb. 26-March 8).\n\nTo play Ana, a peer counselor at an AIDS facility in Brooklyn whose past drug addiction has put a strain on her family relationships, Latifah (nee Dana Owens) channeled the muse of the New York streets where the New Jersey girl hung out as a teenager.\n\n\"I grew up around these women and around these streets, so it was probably one of the more relatable backdrops that I've been able to sort of step into,\" Latifah says. \"I really felt like I really could relate to the characters, to the situations, a family disrupted by drug addiction. I could relate to that just in my own family. So I could relate to Ana's sense of wanting to get out there and see what life had to offer, although we took dramatically different turns. \"\n\nDirector Nelson George co-wrote the film with Jim McKay and Hannah Weyer, based on his own HIV-positive sister."
