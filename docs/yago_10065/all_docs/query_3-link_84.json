The film is an adaptation of Sue Monk Kidd’s critically acclaimed debut novel, “The Secret of Life of Bees.”\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Dakota Fanning, Tristan Wilds and Queen Latifah all went to “bee school.” A trainer was brought in to coach them on how to handle themselves in the apiary, since all three actors had to work in the Black Madonna hives, gathering honey while real bees swarmed around them.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Producer Lauren Shuler Donner brought on Dakota Fanning even before Gina Prince-Bythewood came on board. Though Fanning was only 11, Donner was convinced she could play older. However, it took so long to get the financing together for the film that Fanning was almost 14 – exactly the same age as her character Lily – by the time production wrapped.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Alicia Keys learned to play the cello in four weeks for the role of June Boatwright.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES producer Jada Pinkett Smith originally intended to play the role of June (eventually performed by Alicia Keys), but she ultimately had a scheduling conflict with her own directorial debut, THE HUMAN CONTRACT.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The movie earned a People’s Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Movie and an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Motion Picture.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES has also been adapted into a stage musical. Vassar College’s Powerhouse Theater and New York Stage and Film presented a workshop production of it, which starred Uzo Aduba (ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK) in the role of Rosaleen. The show featured music from Tony Award® winner Duncan Sheik and a book by Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage.\n\nLearn more at the AFI Catalog.\n\nThe movie doesn’t end at the credits: Family-friendly Discussion Questions\n\nJoin the conversation on Twitter and Instagram now using #AFIMovieClub.
