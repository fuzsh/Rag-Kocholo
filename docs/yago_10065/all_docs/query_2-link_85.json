        "text": "The Yale School of Architecture presented the symposium “George Nelson—Designs for Living: American Mid-Century Design and Its Legacy Today”, about the legendary product designer and his lasting influence on contemporary design. The event coincides with the exhibition George Nelson: Architect, Writer, Designer, Teacher, opening this week at Yale.\n\nFor the symposium, Pentagram has created a poster that translates the form of Nelson’s iconic Ball Clock (1948) into the color palette of all Pentagram's posters for Yale—black and white—with the clock's hands appearing in gray. Nelson's twelve-letter name, set in Poster Bodoni Italic, fills the clock's hours."
