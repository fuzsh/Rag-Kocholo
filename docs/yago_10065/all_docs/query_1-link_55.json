        "text": "In 2016, English professor Lawrence Jackson returned to his native Baltimore, accepting a job at Johns Hopkins University. His book Shelter: A Black Tale of Homeland, Baltimore, reflects on what it means for a Black man to leave and return; build a home in a neighborhood that would have been inaccessible to him earlier; and process changing dynamics of time, place, and race. Jackson discusses his insights and observations with renowned author and filmmaker Nelson George, whose groundbreaking works reflect on the black experience in America and who himself has borne witness to the intersection of change, place, and race in his own lifelong home of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nParticipants\n\nLawrence Jackson is a biographer and critic whose writing has appeared in Harperâ€™s Magazine, n+1, and Best American Essays. He is the author of the award-winning books Chester B. Himes: A Biography and The Indignant Generation: A Narrative History of African American Writers and Critics. A Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of English and History at Johns Hopkins University, Jackson founded the Billie Holiday Center for Liberation Arts to create opportunities for enhanced intellectual and artistic relations between Hopkins and his hometown of Baltimore. He earned his PhD in English and American literature at Stanford University, and is a 2019 Guggenheim fellowship awardee."
