Catch up with\n\nalumni in this issueâs Almaâs and see\n\nthe exciting schedule planned for\n\nReunion Weekend 2014.\n\nWhatâs Inside Winter/Spring 2014\n\nCover and inside cover photos credit to Nicole Mount.\n\nP:03\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nI find myself talking about âthe college\n\nprocessâ frequently. As a former\n\nAdmissions Officer at the university level,\n\nthere are two changes to the process that\n\nstrike me as particularly noteworthy.\n\nFirst, the number of enrolled students\n\nat colleges has not appreciably increased,\n\nhowever, the demand for those seats has.\n\nMore people are going to college than\n\never before. If you combine this trend\n\nwith the following mind-set â the\n\nsubjective belief that for each, only a few\n\ncolleges are the ârightâ choice â you\n\nratchet up the stress level of parents and\n\nstudents around admissions. Selecting a college that is\n\nbest for you is no longer the driver for many; getting into\n\na specific college is now the focus.\n\nFor Solebury, the ârightâ college is about the best fit\n\nfor the individual student. We take into consideration\n\ntheir style of learning, as well as their physical and\n\nemotional needs â all the variables such that, when\n\nproperly aligned, position our graduates for success in\n\ncollege.\n\nFor the students, the college process spans much of\n\ntheir time at Solebury. Tim Gallen, Soleburyâs Director\n\nof College Guidance, devotes all of his time to helping\n\nour families negotiate this process. Tim offers seminars\n\nand workshops to the parents of sophomores and\n\njuniors. He answers questions from ninth graders\n\nthrough seniors about course selection and how âthe\n\ncollegesâ will view this particular course choice as\n\nopposed to that one. He helps to chart the course our\n\nstudents must navigate â ensuring access to the necessary\n\ntests (PSAT, ACT, SAT, SAT Subject Tests) â as well as\n\npreparing our students for regional and national college\n\nfairs. He teaches a class on the college process, required\n\nfor every junior and has built strong relationships with\n\nmany institutions of higher learning. Under Timâs\n\nleadership, the school adopted Naviance, an online\n\nanalytic tool that informs students and parents as to how\n\nthe studentsâ credentials match the desired profile of the\n\ncolleges they are contemplating. In addition to Tim, all\n\nfaculty are part of the support network as our students\n\napproach the college process â from supportive advisors\n\nwho listen, guide and counsel, to those faculty who\n\nauthor highly personalized letters of\n\nrecommendation.\n\nIn addition to Timâs official school\n\nrecommendation, each student typically\n\nrequests two to four letters in support of\n\ntheir application from those teachers\n\nwho know them best.\n\nWhich brings us to Senior year, when\n\nthe emphasis shifts to a series of\n\ndecisions for the student. How many\n\nschools should I apply to? What are my\n\nâsafety schoolsâ and are they really safe?\n\nDo I have a first choice and should I\n\napply Early Action (EA), Early Decision (ED) or\n\nRegular? How does that decision affect my financial aid\n\nif I need financial assistance? Which teachers should I\n\nask for my recommendations? With one eye (hopefully)\n\nstill focused on their current academic work, the first\n\nhalf of the senior year sees the other eye focused on a\n\nmountain of forms, some paper and others electronic,\n\nessays and deadlines.\n\nAnd thenâ¦the waiting begins. How long the wait\n\ndepends on which schools are in the mix, whether they\n\npractice precipice or rolling admission, and whether the\n\nstudent applied ED, EA or Regular. Thus, almost the\n\nentirety of the year is dotted with a mixture of joy and\n\npathos as students learn of their decisions from\n\nNovember through April.\n\nLike the classes before them, the class of 2014 has\n\ninvested much time and effort in both their time at\n\nSolebury and in making choices for the next step in their\n\neducational journey. We have students actively seeking\n\nadmission at schools such as Brown, Yale, Penn and\n\nColumbia, while George Washington University,\n\nUniversity of Illinois, Skidmore, Penn State, NYU,\n\nBennington, Hampshire, Pitt, and Indiana University\n\namong others have already welcomed Solebury seniors\n\nto their freshmen class of 2018. Of our 51 seniors, more\n\nthan half have already received an acceptance.\n\nWhat does all this mean? I do not subscribe to the\n\nview that only a relative handful of schools define the\n\nuniverse of acceptable options as our students graduate\n\nfrom Solebury School. I do believe in fit and feel and\n\nA Note from\n\nTom WilschutzâHead of School\n\n(continued on page 11)\n\nP:04\n\n4 â Solebury School Magazine Winter/Spring 2014\n\nDuring the next 18 months, Solebury School will participate in the rigorous accreditation process\n\nof the Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools (PAIS). Currently, our faculty and staff\n\nare deeply engaged in comprehensive, thoughtful reflection about all aspects of the work we do as a\n\nschool. This effort will culminate with a written self-study composed by the entire faculty and staff\n\nand demonstrating our approach to 25 standards that include the schoolâs philosophy, governance,\n\ninstitutional advancement, financial management and health and safety.\n\nOnce the self-study is complete, it will be submitted to PAIS and we will\n\nbegin preparing to welcome a Visiting Team composed of volunteers who are\n\nteachers, administrators and Heads from other independent schools, all\n\nmembers of PAIS. The Visiting Team, chaired by the Head of another\n\nindependent school, will arrive in late October to visit every class, review all the\n\npaperwork with collateral materials and meet with students, administrators,\n\nparents and faculty. The visiting team is examining us based on the criteria we\n\nhave set for our school and evaluating our efforts against generally accepted\n\nstandards for effective independent schools. The standards provide a basic\n\nframework that is intended to be shared among independent schools in\n\nPennsylvania and its narrative format allows us to detail the unique and special\n\nattributes of Solebury School. Some months after the visit, we will receive\n\nfeedback from PAIS regarding the status of our accreditation, along with a\n\ndetailed written report with commendations and recommendations to guide us\n\nas we seek to continually improve the experience for our students and all\n\nmembers of the community. Once approved, Solebury will be accredited with\n\nPAIS through 2021.\n\nSpecial acknowledgement goes to our librarian Hanna Elliot, who is chairing the self-study, and the entire Steering\n\nCommittee for their extraordinary effort and time commitment to this process. âI have been really grateful for the extra\n\nwork that everyone has been doing,â said Elliot. âIt isnât an easy process but our faculty and staff has been willing to\n\nparticipate and rise to the challenge.â\n\nâAs time consuming as this effort is, this process offers the whole community an opportunity to examine closely who\n\nand what we are and evaluate that snapshot against both our mission and our vision for the schoolâs future,â said Tom\n\nWilschutz, Head of School. âPerhaps as valuable, we ask a group of external experts who arrive without bias or\n\npreconceived ideas to read carefully what we think of ourselves, then to come and spend time with us â listen and observe\n\nâ and confirm for us, or challenge us, on our reality. In most every instance both are true. We will be praised for doing\n\nsome things very well and we will be challenged to improve where needed. The schools that engage the reaccreditation\n\nprocess with serious intent seize a wonderful opportunity to insert into the busy lives of a school time for thought,\n\nreflection and discussion such that the near term path forward is well lit by these three beacons as we seek the kind of\n\ncontinuous improvement that keeps us completive and relevant.â â\n\nStandards of Academic Excellence\n\nPAIS Accreditation\n\nP:05\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nJust a couple of months ago, English teacher Kara\n\nMcCabe had a conversation with a student that let her know\n\nshe was doing something right. Referencing a popular image\n\nfor good ideas, McCabe heard, âIâve run out of light bulbs!\n\nYou canât make any more connections today.â\n\nYet connections are what itâs all about in the new\n\ninterdisciplinary Middle School Program, designed to\n\nhighlight the interconnected relationship between\n\nLiterature, History, Science, Math and Language. The new\n\n7th and 8th grade curriculum invites students to broaden\n\ntheir understanding, spark their critical thinking skills, and\n\nnotice the overlap of issues in the world around them.\n\nStudents read Greek myths while learning about early Greek\n\ndemocracy; they learn about languages as a window into\n\nworld cultures; they learn about science while exploring the\n\nlocal environment, interviewing local farmers and preparing\n\ntheir own farm-to-table meal; they learn about their own\n\ncultural identity as a way of exploring immigration,\n\ngeography and government.\n\nâWe hoped that they would see the inter-related nature of\n\nschool and really all academic disciplines,â said Kristy\n\nThurrell, a history teacher who, along with McCabe, teaches\n\na Middle School humanities course called Identity,\n\nCommunity, Change. âWe planned it out, with the\n\nconnections there, and said, âMaybe theyâll see them.â They\n\nreally have, maybe even more than we hoped. And theyâre\n\nmaking the connections themselves.â\n\nWith just 16 students, the new Middle School program is\n\nsmall by design, and offers a challenging and advanced\n\ncurriculum. Essentially, this is Honors Middle School,\n\nobserves Cari Nelson, science teacher and director of the\n\nMiddle School program. âThere is a higher level of thinking\n\nat work here,â said Nelson. âThese students will be very\n\nprepared for high school.â\n\nNelson pointed to the small class size, interdisciplinary\n\napproach and the opportunity for experiential learning as the\n\ncornerstones of this unique program. During their two\n\nyears, Middle School students visit Washington, D.C., the\n\nUnited Nations, an Environmental Education Center,\n\nOverlook Farm, run by Heifer International, and even take\n\nan international trip. The Middle School also has a 1:1 iPad\n\nprogram, allowing students to develop their technological\n\nskills while staying organized. âWe are 90 percent digital,â\n\nsaid Nelson. âStudents turn in work on the iPad, I grade it\n\non the iPad, and give it back on the iPad. It helps with\n\norganization. There are no more loose papers for Middle\n\nSchoolers.â\n\nThis is one of the many changes that students seem to\n\nappreciate. âI really like the fact that we use iPads for\n\nlearning now,â said Stella Stinnett â18. âI am learning about\n\nso many new things and itâs very fun at the same time.\n\nOverall this year at Solebury School has been a great\n\nexperience for me and Iâm having so much fun and learning\n\na lot.â â\n\nThe New\n\nMiddle School Program\n\nMiddle Schoolers Connor Leff â19, Garritt Zalewski â19 and Robbe Genyn â18\n\nwork on their LEGO robot projects.\n\nMiddle School Director Cari Nelson (center), works with Lorenz\n\nMarkhoff â18 and Ben Weinberg â18 on their iPads.\n\nP:06\n\n6 â Solebury School Magazine Winter/Spring 2014\n\nSolebury Schoolâs Philosophyâ\n\nAn Enduring Foundation\n\nWhen the school opened in 1925\n\nwith just four teachers and four\n\nstudents, these core ideas became the\n\nfoundation of an educational\n\nphilosophy. The future may have been\n\nmurky, but the schoolâs mission was\n\ncrystal clear. âOur goal is to start a\n\nsmall school with an informal\n\natmosphere, where the needs of each\n\nboy would be attended to, where\n\nfriendship between teachers and pupils\n\nwould be encouraged, and where a boy\n\nwould be prepared not only for\n\ncollege, but for life beyond high\n\nschool,â wrote Arthur âDocâ\n\nWashburn, Soleburyâs first headmaster.\n\nNearly 90 years later, Solebury\n\nSchoolâs philosophy includes five tenets\n\nthat align seamlessly with the four\n\nfoundersâ original intentions:\n\nchallenging academics, a partnership\n\nbetween students and teachers, respect\n\nfor the individual, the importance of\n\ndiversity and relevant education.\n\nâWhen I think about Soleburyâs\n\nphilosophy, Iâm jealous that our\n\nstudents get to go to school here,â said\n\nScott Eckstein, Solebury Schoolâs\n\nDirector of Admissions. âThey attend\n\na school where the classes are full of\n\nmeaningful work, they are surrounded\n\nby adults who care, and they are part\n\nof an environment where they can\n\ntruly be themselves. A community like\n\nthis is an incredible gift and creates a\n\ngreat high school experience.â\n\nToday, the five tenets of Solebury\n\nSchoolâs philosophy are not just words\n\non a page. Instead, they are living,\n\nbreathing emblems of what the school\n\nrepresents. They are embodied in the\n\nbright and vibrant students that\n\npopulate the campus. They endure.\n\nIt is difficult to find a student at\n\nSolebury School who does not\n\npersonify the schoolâs philosophy.\n\nHere are brief snapshots of five\n\nstudents who help bring the schoolâs\n\nphilosophy to life every day.\n\nChallenging and Inspiring Academics\n\nLooking at\n\nEli Sadoffâs\n\nacademic\n\ntranscript,\n\nseveral patterns\n\nappear â like\n\nthe repetition of\n\nthe word\n\nâHonorsâ or the\n\nfrequent use of\n\nthe letters âAPâ.\n\nSadoff â14, has sought out challenging\n\ncourses since he arrived at Solebury\n\nSchool in 9th grade. Now in his senior\n\nyear, when he could perhaps ease up a\n\nbit, he has instead decided to take AP\n\nFrench, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry,\n\nHonors Physics, 19th Century Novel,\n\nand Multivariable Calculus, a college\n\nlevel course where he is the only\n\nstudent in the class. âMy schedule is\n\nkind of crazy,â laughed Sadoff. âI\n\ndecided to make my senior year my\n\nhardest.â\n\nYet while Sadoff has always pushed\n\nhimself, he has also enjoyed his\n\nstudies. He said the small class sizes,\n\nindividual attention from teachers, and\n\nthe notion that education is about\n\nmore than just earning grades has\n\nmade what could have been an\n\nacademic slog into something much\n\nmore satisfying. âThere is some stress,\n\nbut there is also the joy of learning,â\n\nsaid Sadoff. âI look forward to going\n\nto class.â\n\nStudents and Teachers â\n\nA Partnership in Learning\n\nIan Grady\n\nâ14 considers\n\nhistory teacher\n\nKristy Thurrell\n\nhis friend. At\n\nSolebury, this is\n\nnot atypical.\n\nInstead, this is a\n\ncommon\n\noccurrence on a\n\ncampus where\n\nclass time is all about discourse,\n\ndiscussion and debate; and where\n\nstudent/teacher relationships are all\n\nabout collaboration, conversation and\n\ncamaraderie.\n\nâIâve been at schools where you\n\ncalled teachers by their first names,\n\nbut even then you couldnât sit down\n\nand have lunch with a teacher. You can\n\nat Solebury and itâs a huge plus,â said\n\nGrady. âYou feel a lot more confident\n\nin class when youâre asking questions\n\nor if you donât understand something.\n\nIan Grady â14\n\nIn the early 1920s, four young men with big dreams and few resources embarked on one revolutionary idea: to build a better school.\n\nThey had seen what was out there â rigid rules, rote learning, authoritarian teachers â and envisioned something different. They\n\nimagined a place where education could be challenging and inspiring, where learning could be more about asking new questions than\n\nreceiving old answers, where studentsâ individual passions could be ignited and encouraged, and where the bonds between teachers and\n\nstudents could feel like a genuine partnership. They imagined Solebury School.\n\nEli Sadoff â14\n\nP:07\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nItâs a lot easier to say, âI have no idea\n\nwhat you just said.ââ\n\nGrady arrived at Solebury School last\n\nyear, and has spent three trimesters in\n\nThurrellâs history electives. This year\n\nhe doesnât have Thurrell as a teacher,\n\nbut still makes time to have lunch or\n\ncoffee with her. Grady said forming\n\nbonds with his teachers has enhanced\n\nhis experiences here, allowing him to\n\ndevelop relationships based on mutual\n\nrespect. âYouâre treated much more as\n\na peer,â said Grady. âTeachers talk to\n\nyou like a person.â\n\nProfound Respect for the Individual\n\nSome high\n\nschools are\n\nruled by the\n\nclique, the\n\nstereotype, the\n\nlabel - not\n\nSolebury\n\nSchool. When\n\nVeronica Fitton\n\nâ14 arrived here\n\nin 7th grade,\n\nthis notion was a revelation. âI always\n\nliked to do a lot of things, but I never\n\nknew that I could do 10 things I\n\nloved,â she said. âI thought I had to\n\npick one.â\n\nSix years later, Fitton has found her\n\nunique individuality by pursuing all the\n\nthings she loves. She plays softball and\n\nfield hockey, she is a captivating singer\n\nand performer, she is a peer mentor, a\n\ngraduate of the Teach2Serve program,\n\nand the co-founder of GirlForward, a\n\nclub that highlights the challenges\n\nfaced by adolescent girls around the\n\nworld. Fitton said Soleburyâs\n\nencouraging environment helped her\n\nfind the confidence to pursue her\n\npassions. âStereotypes are not a thing\n\nhere,â she said. âItâs not like if youâre a\n\njock you canât also be a singer or an\n\nactivist. You can be whoever you want.\n\nThereâs no one whoâs going to tell you\n\nâNo you canât do this.â Instead itâs âYou\n\nwant to do this? How can we make that\n\nhappen?â Itâs a âmake it happenâ kind of\n\nschool and community.â\n\nWithout the constraints of being told\n\nwho she should be, Fitton found\n\nherself. âSolebury influenced me to be\n\nwho I want to be,â she said. âItâs just a\n\nsupportive place to grow.â\n\nThe Importance of Diversity\n\nAs the word\n\nimplies,\n\nâdiversityâ can\n\nmean many\n\ndifferent things.\n\nAt Solebury\n\nSchool, the facts\n\nwill tell you it\n\nmeans that the\n\ncampus has a\n\npopulation\n\nwhere 20 percent of students are of\n\ncolor and 15 percent are international\n\nstudents. Yet to Zonia Rueda â15, it\n\nmeans something much more personal.\n\nâDiversity means that my friends like\n\nto learn about my culture and\n\nlanguage,â said Rueda, whose family\n\ncomes from Guatemala. âIt means that\n\neveryone is friends with everyone. It\n\nmeans itâs a place to be who you are\n\nand express who you are.â\n\nRueda said Solebury is a welcoming\n\nplace that has encouraged her to join\n\nchorus, Master Singers, theater\n\nproductions, Diversity Club, Judiciary\n\nCommittee and the Intercultural\n\nStudent Association. It is a place that\n\nalso encouraged her to celebrate her\n\nown heritage. Last year, Rueda founded\n\nthe Hispanic Affinity Group, a club\n\nthat hosts a Day of the Dead event at\n\nschool, sponsors movie nights, and\n\nholds meetings for members to talk\n\nabout issues related to cultural identity.\n\nRueda said the varied student body,\n\nunique clubs, and multicultural campus\n\nevents make Solebury feel very\n\naccepting. âItâs a comfortable place to\n\nbe respected,â she notes.\n\nRelevant Education\n\nWhat does a\n\nrelevant\n\neducation look\n\nlike? It looks like\n\na student who\n\nfeels prepared to\n\nmeet the\n\nchallenges\n\nahead. It looks\n\nlike a student\n\nwho understands\n\ntheir connection to the broader\n\ncommunity. It looks like a student who\n\nfeels empowered to change the world.\n\nA relevant education can look like\n\nAlliyah Allen â14.\n\nLast year, Allen completed Solebury\n\nSchoolâs Teach2Serve program, an\n\ninnovative two-year curriculum that\n\nteaches public service\n\nentrepreneurship. As part of her\n\ncapstone project, Allen developed a\n\ntutoring program for elementary and\n\nmiddle school students at a school in\n\nTrenton â a program that continues\n\ntoday. Allen was also invited to\n\nparticipate in Solebury Schoolâs TEDx\n\nconference, presenting her TED Talk\n\non how to motivate middle school\n\nstudents in inner city schools. âI didnât\n\neven know what a TEDx conference\n\nwas before,â said Allen. âNow Iâve\n\npresented at one.â\n\nAllen said that these experiences â\n\nalong with classes like Ethics, American\n\nStudies and Honors Theory that\n\nencouraged her to explore social issues,\n\nsignificantly changed how she sees the\n\nworld and herself. âIt pushed me to\n\nwant to be better and do more,â she\n\nsaid. âItâs not just about GPA. Now I\n\nfeel like Iâm working toward\n\nsomething.

As a Spanish teacher,\n\nnewspaper supervisor, dorm\n\nparent, and Spanish Honors\n\nSociety head, Kim clearly\n\npossesses a knack for adaptability, immersing herself in\n\nmany facets of Solebury life. She has some practice, after\n\nall, having lived in both Spain and Argentina while\n\npursuing her Masters in Spanish from Middlebury\n\nCollegeâs prestigious language program.

She is a natural\n\nathlete and a predestined\n\nathletic trainer, having\n\nrecognized her calling when\n\nshe was still in high school. Her position at Solebury\n\nmarries everything she loves: teaching, training,\n\ncommunity, and sports. Stacie earned her Masterâs in\n\nKinesiology from Temple University last May and upon\n\ngraduating, chose to turn her concluding year-long\n\nexternship at Solebury into a full time lifestyle.

Student opinion was decidedly\n\nunenthusiastic.\n\nâThe question on everybodyâs lips nowadays concerns the\n\nmerger between Holmquist and Solebury and whether or\n\nnot it will be a satisfactory and advantageous arrangement,â\n\nwrote Noel Crowley in the May 1949 issue of Soleburyâs\n\nstudent newspaper, The Scribe. âWhile we have not taken\n\nconsensus of opinion on the subject, we have listened to the\n\nviews expressed by members of both student bodies and\n\nhave found very few supporters of the merger.â\n\nHappily, opinions quickly changed.\n\nThis year marks the 65th anniversary of the merger of\n\nSolebury School and the Holmquist School. Back in 1949,\n\nco-educational independent schools were not the norm.\n\nAbout 77 percent of private schools were single sex in 1950,\n\nwrote Arthur G. Powell in Lessons from Privilege: the\n\nAmerican Prep School Tradition. Yet the progressive leaders\n\nof Solebury and Holmquist decided on the merger.\n\nThat first year following the merger, Solebury School\n\nwas populated by 64 boys and 45 girls. Since then, women\n\nhave impacted, enhanced and influenced the school in\n\nmany ways. Soleburyâs student body is now composed of\n\n118 boys and 103 girls. More than half of Soleburyâs\n\nteachers are women and there are nine female\n\nadministrators. Solebury fields nine girlsâ sports teams\n\nthroughout the year and, this year, all three school\n\npresidents are girls. On campus today, there is an openness\n\nand strong support system â with faculty advisors, peer\n\nleaders, Life Skills classes, and more â that nurtures girls,\n\nand all students. And there are clubs like GirlForward, a\n\ncampus group started by two students last year which\n\nhighlights the challenges facing adolescent girls around the\n\nworld and gives young women a place to talk, share,\n\nquestion and connect.\n\nâThis is one of the safest places Iâve ever seen for the\n\ndevelopment of a teenage girlâs mind,â said Shawn Wright,\n\nthe girlsâ dorm parent of the aptly named Holmquist\n\nHouse. âWe have a really unique opportunity here, with\n\nour size, philosophy and methodology. I see that the culture\n\nhere fosters strong student leaders.â Wright tried to define\n\ntodayâs âSolebury young woman.â âSheâs very independent,\n\nmore confident than other girls, with a little more faith in\n\nher skills,â she said. âAnd her individuality is really\n\nexpressed and encouraged.â\n\nP:11\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\ntone as key filters in helping a student select their college\n\nchoices. Increasingly, I see the value of the practice of taking a\n\nâgap yearâ â while the path leads to college for the vast\n\nmajority of our students, Solebury also sees some seniors who\n\nexplore exciting opportunities that postpone college by at least\n\na year. Last year, one of our seniors spent a year in Brazil\n\nworking with young children as part of the Global Citizen Year\n\nProgram. Next year, weâll send a current senior into the\n\ncompetitive City Year program to mentor young minds in\n\nChester, Pennsylvania. I hold fast to the view that a strong\n\nundergraduate program focuses on education rather than only\n\ntraining. I believe exiting your undergraduate years with the\n\ncapacity to read critically, to write cogently, to think broadly,\n\ndeeply and logically, and to discriminate fact-less opinions\n\nfrom fact-based, rational thought; all are the stuff that should\n\nbe required of the undergraduate experience. And I believe\n\nthat more and more of our students will need to continue their\n\neducation in graduate school, law school or one of the\n\nprofessional schools. They enter a world where pace continues\n\nto pick up, where too much information will be their challenge\n\nand where continuous education will be the norm.\n\nThe process for identifying and then gaining admission to\n\ncollege is indeed a daunting one for students and their caring\n\nparents. Soleburyâs role is to support, to guide, and to be a\n\nvoice of reason and balance, a buoy that our students and\n\nparents rely on to help navigate and for support. A final\n\nperspective: as this college thing swirls about them, blowing\n\nharder and harder with each passing year of high school, I\n\nalways stress to our students that âgetting inâ is not the end.\n\nOnce in, their lives will be far more impacted by what they did\n\nthan by where they went. A track record of diligence, of\n\nsuccess, of involvement that belies commitment and passion â\n\nthese will be keys that unlock the doors post college\n\ngraduation.\n\nI hope you enjoy this issue of our magazine. You will meet\n\nsome folks new to Solebury, have an opportunity to see how\n\nwe are spending our year on the re-accreditation process, learn\n\nabout our recently redesigned Middle School program as well\n\nas spend some time reflecting on some of the guiding tenets\n\nthat underpin the Solebury School philosophy.\n\nEnjoy. â\n\nThatâs just what the founders of the Holmquist A Note from Tom Wilschutz (continued from page 3)\n\nSchool intended. Karline Holmquist started her\n\nschool with six students and five teachers in 1917,\n\npredating Solebury School by eight years. One of\n\nthe original students, Peggy Rickett Ramsperger,\n\nwrote a letter about her recollections of Miss\n\nHolmquist. âShe did not believe in grades and\n\nrequirements, or unnecessary rules and\n\nregulations,â wrote Ramsperger. âShe did believe\n\nin encouraging our interests and abilities.â\n\nThe tradition of supporting young women\n\ncontinued after Holmquist merged with Solebury.\n\nAndee Falco â63, who arrived at Solebury just ten\n\nyears after the merger, recalls âa very kind,\n\nnurturing environment.â Yet she also recalls a\n\ndifferent time in history. When she and fellow\n\nclassmate, Bella Schauman â63, visited Solebury\n\nSchool last year, they were struck by the advances\n\nof women and girls on campus. âYoung women\n\nare challenged, encouraged and nurtured to\n\ndevelop their talents at an earlier ageâ said Falco.\n\nSchauman agreed. âIt seems to me that girlsâ\n\nemotional and social lives are much better\n\naddressed now,â she said. âThereâs a conscious\n\nfaculty thatâs trying really hard to be aware of\n\nwhat girls need and provide a model of a world\n\nwhere girls can thrive.â\n\nSixty-five years after Holmquist merged with\n\nSolebury, girls continue to impact and enhance\n\nthe school. And the school continues to shape and\n\nsupport young women and all students.\n\nâSolebury School is an empowering place for\n\nyoung women but just as equally empowering for\n\nyoung men,â said Alex Leone â14, a co-founder of\n\nGirlForward who organized an all-day campus\n\nconference last April. âI have always been\n\nencouraged to try new things and push myself at\n\nSolebury the same as every other student.â â\n\nP:12\n\nIn November, Alexandra Leone â14\n\nwas recognized for her exceptional\n\ncommunity service and her\n\nextraordinary display of character and\n\ncommunity involvement. Alex was\n\nrecognized by the Central Bucks\n\nChamber of Commerce as a recipient\n\nof the Chamberâs Young Citizens\n\nAward at a luncheon ceremony at The\n\nWarrington Country Club.\n\nAlex came to Solebury School\n\nlooking to branch out. She was raised\n\nby her mother and grandmother and\n\nhad attended all-girlsâ schools through\n\neighth grade. She felt the need to\n\nexpand her horizons at a school where\n\nstudents were excited about learning\n\nand encouraged to be themselves.\n\nAlexâs unflagging work ethic helps her\n\nboth in and out of the classroom. Alex\n\nshines as a student who can\n\nconsistently excel in the classroom and\n\nin the community. During her time at\n\nSolebury, she has been involved in our\n\ncommunity council, rising to the level\n\nof class president twice and council\n\npresident this year. She has\n\nhelped international students\n\nlearn English, been a peer\n\ntutor on campus as well as a\n\nvolunteer tutor at a charter\n\nschool, sung with our chorus\n\nand advised on our academic\n\ncommittee to help students\n\nwho were struggling. She is\n\nalso an accomplished Irish\n\ndancer; she has been dancing\n\nsince she was eight years-old\n\nand has competed nationally\n\nand internationally.\n\nAlex is known for her\n\nservice on both a local and\n\nglobal stage, accumulating\n\nover 200 community service\n\nhours during her time at\n\nSolebury. During ninth grade,\n\nshe attended a Junior Statesman of\n\nAmerica program at Princeton\n\nUniversity, where she focused on\n\ninternational relations and made her\n\nfirst of many trips to the United\n\nNations. From there she has helped\n\nrebuild flood-damaged houses in\n\nIthaca, NY and travelled to Costa Rica\n\nwhere she painted a school and worked\n\nwith children and a community garden.\n\nBack home, she worked at a home for\n\nhomeless Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and\n\nTransgender youth and interned at Life\n\nTies, Inc., an organization that\n\nprovides care and services to youth in\n\ncrisis due to sexual orientation. She\n\nhelped these adolescents learn daily\n\nliving skills. She then took her\n\nexperience in Life Ties and created and\n\nhosted a life skills workshop for young\n\nwomen at Solebury, bringing in a\n\nheadhunter to talk about resumes,\n\nrepresentatives from PNC Bank to talk\n\nabout money management, a selfdefense instructor, a teen model and a\n\nhealthy living advocate. Last year, she\n\nco-founded GirlForward, a group\n\ndedicated to the empowerment of\n\nyoung women at Solebury. She worked\n\nwith representatives at the United\n\nNations to help link our program to\n\ntheir Girl Up program, becoming a\n\nteen advisor with the UN for their\n\nprogram. Last spring, she shared her\n\nexperience at the schoolâs first\n\nTEDxYouth conference with her own\n\nTED Talk at Solebury.\n\nCongratulations Alex! â\n\nAward-winning Solebury Senior\n\nAlexandra Leone â14\n\nYoung Citizens Award recipient Alex Leone â14 (center) with\n\nher grandmother, Susanne Case, and Steve Buteux, Assistant\n\nHead of School.\n\nYoung Citizens Award recipient Alex Leone (front row second from left).\n\n12 â Solebury School Magazine Winter/Spring 2014\n\nP:13\n\nAlmaâs Update\n\nWinter 2014\n\nHOLMQUIST SCHOOL FOR GIRLS\n\n1917-1949\n\nClass of 1940\n\nCarla Zingarelli Rosenlicht moved to a\n\nretirement community in Walnut Creek,\n\nCalifornia with many activities.

Our\n\nSoleBenefits stories highlight\n\nsome of our most altruistic\n\nindividuals committed to\n\nSolebury School.\n\nSoleBenefits\n\nSolebury Schoolâs mission is\n\nto create an environment of\n\neducational excellence that\n\nprepares students for success\n\nin college and beyond. In\n\nthe Solebury community, we\n\nstrongly value intellectual\n\nchallenge and academic\n\nachievement, creative and\n\nindependent thinking,\n\nmutual respect between\n\nstudents and teachers, deep\n\nrespect for each individual,\n\nand diversity.\n\nSarah Dawes Bailin â56\n\nA Life Changing Experience\n\nIn the early 1950s, a shy timid girl from a small New England town\n\narrived at Solebury School for her first time. Selected based on the schoolâs\n\nacademic reputation and merit, her parents wanted their daughter to have\n\nthe opportunity for a sound education.\n\nFor the first three months, Sarah wanted nothing more than to return\n\nback to the small rural community she called home - Hudson,\n\nMassachusetts. But then, a very distinct turning point occurred, a life\n\nchanging one that made her want to stay and eventually led her to call\n\nSolebury School her home. For the first time in Sarah Dawesâs life, she\n\nbegan to read with comprehension. For Sarah this opened a new world for\n\nher understanding and exploration.\n\nâSolebury saved my life. They taught me to read with\n\nmeaning and it changed me forever. I would not be the\n\nperson I am today without Solebury.â\n\nP:17\n\nSolebury School values bequests, large and small.\n\nIncluding Solebury in your legacy plan is simple.\n\nOne sentence in your will or trust can help support future generations of Soleburians.\n\nI give to Solebury School, 6832 Phillips Mill Road, New Hope, PA 18938 (EIN 23-1365-969)\n\n$_____________ (or ________% of the rest of my estate) to be used for general purposes.\n\nPlease let us know of your intent so we may honor your gift purpose appropriately.\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nAt the time, she recalls Solebury had recently merged with The\n\nHolmquist School for Girls. Sarah was one of nine girls that lived at the\n\noriginal Holmquist dorm located at the corner of Phillips Mill and River\n\nRoad. Some of her most memorable moments included school dances,\n\nfinding ways to get around âlights outâ with her classmates, and study\n\nparties in her closet. Several of her classmates were spirited jokesters and\n\nwho targeted each other as well as the faculty. Not even Head of School\n\nArthur âDocâ Washburn was immune.\n\nIt was like a big family with caring adults. The teachers\n\ngave you a chance for explanation and somehow they\n\nunderstood me. It was okay to be curious and ask questions\n\n- a place to explore. Solebury gave me a sense of myself\n\nand built my self-esteem. It became my home.\n\nAlways designing clothes for herself while at Solebury, upon graduation\n\nshe attended the Prince School of Retailing at Simmons College, earning a\n\nBachelorâs of Science in Merchandising. On the fashion buyerâs career\n\ntrack, she worked in the high-fashion sector for companies like Bonwit\n\nTeller, Neiman Marcus, I. Magnum and Joseph Magnum. She found her\n\nway to the West Coast and managed a womenâs retail clothing shop in San\n\nFrancisco before returning to New England to lead her familyâs textile\n\nbusiness. One of her favorite innovations during this time was the\n\nproduction and marketing of the printed shoelaces that were popular during\n\nthe 1980s. This particular product helped the family business to achieve, for\n\none year, its greatest profits in its entire 134-year history. Sheâs proudly\n\nraised two very independent and strong daughters.\n\nShe has toured the world â a bike tour in China, explorations in Budapest,\n\nalong with extensive business travel to Europe â and continues to travel\n\ntoday. One of her most rewarding challenges was taking on the job of a\n\nland developer and creating a residential community. Today, she spends\n\ntime weaving garments on a ten-harness floor loom for family and friends.\n\nRegardless of her path she remains grounded in her Solebury roots and\n\ncalls Solebury her home; the place that changed her life. âSolebury gave me\n\nthe confidence I needed academically but gave me the chance to become an\n\nindividual.â\n\nSarah wants others to experience the life changing possibilities that a\n\nSolebury education can provide so sheâs incorporated Solebury in her estate\n\nplanning. She notes, âIncluding Solebury in my legacy plan is one small way\n\nthat I can give back to Solebury and say thank you for changing my life.â â\n\nWhatâs your legacy?\n\nInterested in learning more\n\nabout planned giving\n\nopportunities at\n\nSolebury School?\n\nVisit www.solebury.org/giving\n\nor contact\n\nJenn Burns at\n\n215-862-5261 ext. 183 or\n\n[email protected]\n\nP:18\n\n18 â Solebury School Magazine Winter/Spring 2014\n\nSolebury School\n\nAthletic Hall of Fame\n\nSolebury School is pleased to announce the 2014 Class\n\nPlease join us for the induction ceremony on Saturday, May 3 at 1pm\n\nJohn D.

The auction is the schoolâs biggest fundraising event and helps fund educational programming, student\n\nactivities and facility improvements at the School.\n\nFor over 25 years, parents, staff and students of Solebury have worked together to make this important evening\n\nsuccessful. To date, we have raised in excess of a million dollars, making a significant impact on the lives of Solebury\n\nstudents.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Live Auction is the Special Appeal, which directly benefits one building or program at\n\nSolebury. Last year, the auction raised $125,000 in total, with more than $50,000 raised through the special appeal and\n\nbenefiting our Visual Art program.\n\nThis year, the Special Appeal will benefit the Solebury Black Box Theater. Recognizing the importance of our Theater\n\nprogram and the historic building it is housed in, an anonymous donor has generously agreed to match every dollar raised\n\nthrough this yearâs special appeal, up to $50,000! Your gift is worth twice as much thanks to this matching grantâthis\n\ncould be the largest Special Appeal ever.\n\nGood friends, good gifts and great school â this yearâs Annual Dinner Auction is sure to be terrific. Mark your calendars\n\nfor May 3 and plan on joining for this great event â invitations will arrive in mid-March and sneak previews of auction\n\nitems, as well as tons of other information, can be found at solebury.org. You can also help by donating an item, pledging\n\nmoney to the Special Appeal or joining an auction committee. All levels of participation are greatly appreciated.

Our theater program is growing by leaps and bounds and it is so exciting to enhance an\n\nabsolute jewel of a Black Box Theater on our campus. The Barn, which is home to the Theater, is often the very first\n\nthing people see as they enter the front circle of campus. With the generous investment of auction attendees, it can better\n\nreflect the wonderful and amazing things that are going on within. We are so proud of the program and the increasing\n\nnumber of students and parents who are becoming involved. In our last production alone, 20 percent of our students were\n\nin the cast or involved in the technical program! Along with our productions, many classes are taught in this space.\n\nWe anticipate that the Special Appeal will enhance the experience of our actors and audience, as well as everyone\n\ninvolved with the production. Some of the plans we are exploring include: new seating, improved audio/visual technology,\n\nbackstage improvements, much needed revamping of the interior space and much more. This Appeal has the potential to\n\ntransform the space, meeting the needs of Solebury students, families, alumni, and friends for years to come.\n\nOur Theater Department is thriving and growing. Your support will help this space to be beautiful, comfortable and\n\nmuch more widely functional for the entire Solebury community. I look forward to seeing you at the auction on May 3. â\n\nShawn Rowley Wright\n\nSolebury Theater Director\n\nAuction Special Appealâ\n\nThe Black Box Theater\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nP:22\n\n2013-2014\n\nSolebury School Winter Magazine\n\nEditor\n\nJennifer K.

In 2001, by an overwhelming bi-partisan\n\nmajority, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania made history\n\nby becoming the first state to pass an education tax credit\n\naimed at corporations. Pennsylvaniaâs EITC program offers\n\nbusinesses an incredible opportunity to direct a portion of\n\ntheir state tax dollars to scholarship support to educational\n\ninstitutions such as Solebury School.\n\nWhat does this mean for my business? Participating\n\nbusinesses can receive a tax credit equal to 75% of its\n\ncontribution to a Scholarship Organization, like Solebury\n\nSchool, up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year. Of\n\ncourse, each companyâs tax situation is different, please consult\n\nwith your companyâs financial advisor to determine the best\n\nstrategy.\n\nWhat types of taxes can be offset by this credit? âSâ and âCâ corporations must be subject to one of the following\n\nPennsylvania business taxes to participate:\n\nâ¢ Corporate Net Income Tax â¢ Bank and Trust Company Shares Tax\n\nâ¢ Insurance Premiums Tax â¢ Capital Stock Franchise Tax\n\nâ¢ Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax â¢ Title Insurance Companies Shares Tax\n\nâ¢ Personal Income Tax of S Corporation Shareholders, or partners in a limited or general partnership\n\nHow does my donation benefit Solebury School? Donations received from approved EITC Pennsylvania businesses benefit\n\nSolebury students in need of financial assistance in the form of scholarships. Eligible students must be school age, a\n\nresident of Pennsylvania and demonstrate financial need.\n\nHow can my business participate? Pennsylvania businesses can begin applying for EITC credits through DCEDâs\n\nelectronic single application system at http://www.newpa.com/eitc Tax credit applications are processed on a first-come,\n\nfirst-served basis and approved until the amount of available tax credits is exhausted.\n\nInterested in partnering with Solebury School for scholarship opportunities?\n\nContact Gail Acosta at (215) 862-5261 or [email protected] for more details.\n\nEducational Improvement Tax Credits\n\nfor PA Businesses\n\nLast year, thanks to our generous partners, EITC funding\n\nprovided scholarships to Solebury students from Pennsylvania.\n\nwww.solebury.org\n\nP:24\n\nNon-Profit Org.\n\nU.S. Postage\n\nPAID\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nPermit #85\n\n6832 Phillips Mill Road\n\nNew Hope, PA 18938-9682\n\nAddress service requested\n\nThis Magazine is printed on Forest Stewardship Council\n\ncertified recycled paper using vegetable-based inks.\n\nBack cover phone credit to Tom Rondeau.\n\nScan this QR code with your\n\nsmartphone to make your online\n\ndonation to Solebury School."
