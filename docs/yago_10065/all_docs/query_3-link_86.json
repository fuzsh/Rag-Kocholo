        "text": "I didn’t put any of Terrence Malick’s films on my list of the best movies of the decade, but I did mention him as one of the decade’s best directors. The run of movies that he’s made in the past ten years—“The Tree of Life,” “To the Wonder,” “Knight of Cups,” and “Song to Song”—is, in effect, a single movie, ranging over the places and experiences of his life and linking them to a grand metaphysical design. He is, moreover, one of the few filmmakers—ever—to realize a style that matches such a transcendent goal. Yet, when I heard that the subject of Malick’s new film, “A Hidden Life,” would be the story of an Austrian soldier who refuses to fight on behalf of Nazi Germany, I worried. Malick’s recent string of glories focusses on places that he knows well and at first hand. He has spent plenty of time in Texas, France, and Hollywood, but he has, of course, never been to Nazi Germany. Even so, I walked into “A Hidden Life” buoyed by confidence in the impulses and intuitions of such a great director.\n\nIt’s painful to discover that “A Hidden Life” is as aridly theoretical and impersonal as its bare-bones description suggests. It’s based on the true story of Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), an Austrian farmer living peacefully in the rustic farm village of Radegund with his wife, Fani (Valerie Pachner), their three young daughters, her sister (Maria Simon), and his mother (Karin Neuhäuser). In 1940, he’s conscripted into the Army—at a time when Austrian soldiers, in the wake of the Anschluss, were forced to swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler. Franz doesn’t believe in the Nazi cause or agree with its racial hatreds. He thinks that Germany is waging an unjust war, and he doesn’t like Hitler. He shows up for military duty grudgingly but refuses to swear the oath, claiming conscientious-objector status, and is consequently arrested and imprisoned. Meanwhile, his outsider status—as other men in the village have gone off to fight and die—leads to Fani and their children being ostracized, apart from the secret support of a few friends who share Franz’s sympathies but not his resolve or courage.\n\nThe movie includes heavily edited illustrative clips from newsreel footage, showing the destruction of the Second World War, Hitler giving speeches, and Nazi rallies. These clips present both a mystery and an authenticity that nothing in the rest of the film can match. For that matter, clips from home movies of Hitler appear, appallingly, as part of a dream sequence, but they seem tossed in, mainly serving as a reminder of Hitler’s ubiquity at the time. This historical footage overwhelms the entire movie, turning the dramatization into a virtual puppet show.\n\nFranz and Fani are seen romping through the fields of Radegund, like blissfully ignorant children, until the lightning bolt of the military draft strikes their household, in 1940, two years after the Anschluss and seven years after Hitler came to power. It’s as if politics and its cultural and local correlates had never existed in Austria. The townspeople appear to have been living like Rousseauian innocents, in a state of natural nobility tinged by a golden drop of Catholicism—happy, safe, and holy. Their village is a hermetic, apolitical, and utterly pre-modern agrarian paradise. The first sign of trouble, ludicrously, is the sound of an airplane overhead, which makes Fani tilt her head upward in bewilderment.\n\nMeanwhile, the village’s committed Nazi mayor (Karl Markovics) drunkenly rails against “outsiders” and “immigrants”—but did he and his hatreds suddenly come from nowhere? Austrian politics throughout the nineteen-thirties were turbulent, and the Anschluss happened in 1938, yet it seems that politics didn’t penetrate the village’s rustic fabric until the draft snapped up Franz, in 1940—and, even then, he takes his conscription and training as a sort of summer-camp game (though he is conspicuously alone among recruits in not applauding a newsreel of German military victories). Returning home, Franz worries about the possibility of being called to active duty; he refuses to say “Heil Hitler” to passersby. (His response of “Pfui Hitler” gets him into trouble.) Then, in 1943, he is asked to report to the barracks for active duty; that’s when he refuses to swear the oath to Hitler.\n\nThe familiar freedom of Malick’s rhapsodic cinematography is here largely sacrificed to illustrative and indicative images (the cinematographer is Jörg Widmer, who was a camera operator on several of Malick’s earlier films) and the acting is constrained to match, reduced to facile theatrics and superficial expressions, smiling and frowning, gleeful frolics and heavy trudges. Before the trouble strikes, family happiness is shown in the carefree laughter of a game of blind man’s bluff, the ardent young couple romps in the fields while cutting hay or travelling a farm road. The natural splendors of Radegund are postcard-like; the plunging and surging camera work is merely a tic. More or less every shot represents a descriptive line in a screenplay rather than a free observation or a distillation of inner experience; each image checks off predetermined points rather than effecting discoveries.\n\nThe entire movie seems designed to illustrate a thesis, one that’s explicitly stated in the film, albeit inversely. “A Hidden Life” is designed solely to contradict the warning of Nazi officials that Franz’s resistance is futile, not only because he’ll be executed but because his sacrifice will be forgotten and remain unknown and without effect or influence. By the very fact of making the film, Malick both remembers the story and calls it to viewers’ minds—though he isn’t the single-handed recoverer of an otherwise-lost historical event. The letters between the real-life Franz and Fani have survived and have been published, and they provide the basis for the film (as well as the texts for some of its voice-overs). Malick is transmitting a story of which powerful documentary traces remain. What’s missing from his depiction of Franz’s resistance is literally the documentary aspect, the element of the story that connects it directly to Malick’s first-person obsessions.\n\nIt is Malick’s extreme and original approach, in his past decade of work, to experience and observation that has led to his furiously lyrical transcendental style. The present-tense-based dramatizations that, when they involve Malick’s own life and his own places, people, and activities, have been so comprehensively challenging, prove, in “A Hidden Life,” vague, impersonal, and complacent. Malick has turned his own idiosyncratic manner into a commonplace, a convention, a habit. There’s one moment in which Malick declares something like an artistic purpose—a scene in which an artist painting scenes from the life of Christ on the walls of the local church complains to Franz of his own inadequate work as a painter of consolation rather than of torment, of reverence rather than of sacrifice. (The artist also alludes to the vain confidence of parishioners that they’d have stood with Jesus rather than with his persecutors—a line that hits Franz like a challenge.) Malick stands on both sides of the equation: he offers images of earthly rapture, suggesting the virtual paradise given to humanity, and he also offers images of torment and agony, suggesting the spoliation, through sin, with which humanity has besmirched that paradise.\n\nYet in “A Hidden Life” Malick’s merely illustrative and forcedly expressive approach to his subject—complete with studio Nazis from Central Casting (who bark in German, while Franz and Fani speak to each other in English), shots of natural splendor that are numbingly nonspecific and pictorial, and performances that leave no room for ambiguity, contemplation, or mere presence—culminates in a sequence of heavily intended exaltation, a death scene of such leaden bombast and overwrought vagueness as to turn its sacred simplicity into a self-parody. The representation of the torments that Franz endures in the course of his years of opposition and months of imprisonment—which fill nearly two hours of screen time—has the arm’s-length glorification of suffering, the revelling in agony, that marks Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ.”\n\nA central problem with “A Hidden Life” is in the resistance of Nazis to fictional depiction. Some of the very worst movies of recent years have used depictions Nazis in the Second World War as a shortcut to gravitas, starting with this year’s garish grotesquerie “Jojo Rabbit” and including last year’s “Memoir of War” and “The Captain.” Now there’s news that Jonathan Glazer, best known for the science-fiction thriller “Under the Skin,” from 2013, is making another feature, his first since then—a drama set in Auschwitz. I worry for him, too.\n\nI’d like to make a suggestion: de-Nazify the cinema. Filmmakers who make movies about the Second World War, with a closeup view of Nazi Germany and its occupying forces, do so mainly with high-stakes metaphors and storytelling in mind—using the era to illustrate the ultimate clash of good and evil, the ultimate price of resistance. Few filmmakers who make movies about Nazi Germany have a good reason to do so; most dramatic movies on the subject approach it emblematically, with Nazis as instant avatars of evil, posing a special moral challenge to characters that proves irresistible to screenwriters in need of a fix of high-stakes conflict and moral high ground (and, perhaps, of irresistibly lurid villains or ironic paradoxes) and producers who find the starkness of such choices sensational."
