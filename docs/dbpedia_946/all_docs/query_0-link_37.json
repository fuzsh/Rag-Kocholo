        "text": "List of institutions where the University and College Union is involved in an official dispute\n\nA string of University and College Union branches have announced industrial action ballots in recent weeks, while others have announced plans to consult on balloting for strikes. This page includes information on universities where steps towards formal industrial action have been taken—either in the form of a ballot or plans to ballot.\n\nGoldsmiths, University of London\n\nA marking boycott is due to begin a marking boycott on Friday 19 April as a result of planned job cuts. Ina March ballot, more than 87 per cent of UCU members who voted said yes to strike action in a ballot with a turnout of 69 per cent.\n\nUniversity of Kent\n\nStaff at the University of Kent have backed strike action after the institution announced that several courses—including art history, music and audio technology, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology and journalism—are to be phased out, resulting in job losses. Some 85 per cent of UCU members who voted said yes to strike action in a ballot with a turnout of 57 per cent.\n\nUniversity of Lincoln\n\nA consultation over potential strike action will begin on 22 April over plans that could result in job losses.\n\nNorthumbria University\n\nA strike ballot is open at Northumbria University and is due to close on 26 April. The UCU said management at Northumbria has refused to rule out compulsory redundancies as part of plans to make £12.5 million of staffing cuts.\n\nUniversity of Portsmouth\n\nIn March, the UCU opened a consultation at the University of Portsmouth after the institution announced plans for an “academic reset” that could result in job losses and merged departments.\n\nSoas, University of London\n\nAn indicative ballot exploring the possibility of strike action was held in February at Soas, University of London. The UCU said around 30 staff are at risk of losing their jobs and being rehired on inferior terms and conditions.\n\nSheffield Hallam University\n\nA strike ballot will open at Sheffield Hallam University in April, in response to plans the UCU said could result in multiple job losses, including dozens of staff facing compulsory redundancy.\n\nUniversity of Winchester\n\nUCU members at the University of Winchester are consulting over taking industrial action in response to plans—including the closure of its English language programme—that the UCU said could result in redundancies.\n\nThis article is based on information made public by the UCU and was last updated on 18 April 2024.
