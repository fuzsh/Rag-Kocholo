        "text": "Client: Northumbria University, Newcastle\n\nProject: New Brand High Level Signage\n\nIn March 2018 University of Northumbria (UNN) launched a new brand, which reflected a clear vision for the future supported by their strong heritage. The new logo is inspired by the official University crest outwardly communicates Northumbria’s history and stature as an institution. Combined with the University name and location, it creates one single logo which can be used across all platforms.\n\nAs a trusted manufacturing partner, Interplan were appointed in June, to implement their new brand across nine prominent high-level locations within their City Centre and City Campus East estate. The aim was to install all locations by mid-September 2018 to a programme agreed with the University Estates Department and our remit can be outlined as follows:\n\nCarry out a full site survey of at each location to determine the existing letter sizes and assess the safest means of accessing the signage to ensure the safety of our installation engineers, building users and members of the public.\n\nPrepare a design document, which provided a detailed specification of the proposed new brand face illuminated lettering and contained Photoshop visualisation of the existing brand and the proposed new brand.\n\nPrepare planning applications with the local authorities (Newcastle City Council, North Tyneside Council and Gateshead) for the lettering.\n\nManufacture 9 sets of lettering in sizes ranging from a span of 4000mm to 12000mm with a combination of rimless face and rim and return construction lettering. In the case of the high-level lettering at two locations, the existing frames were removed from their positions to ground level by crane so that they could be modified by adding extension pieces to take into account the different shape of the new brand logo.\n\nThe typical complexities of installing in a live environment were present – for example, working at height, working next to the platform edge etc. Every need was considered, and detailed work package plans and task briefings were written and communicated to our installation teams, following approval by the Clients’ H&S team.\n\nRemoval and installation began in early August and all of the signs were removed and installed in accordance with our agreed programme, to agreed quality standards and within budget prior to the students returning from their summer break.\n\nClient Testimonial following completion of project\n\n“Northumbria University partnered with Interplan on a large range of signage schemes in 2018 which brought our new brand identity to life. The strict UNN brand guidelines have been interpreted to update our interior directories and exterior directional systems. The large property portfolio required and array of material options, production techniques and finishes which were presented for our consideration to fit the available budget. Totems and illuminated signage across 2 campuses was swiftly replaced by the Interplan’s team which also assisted the Estates and Facilities Services with planning and listed building consent applications. I would therefore highly recommend Interplan as a contractor of quality and choice.\n\nMichal Luczun – Project Officer at Northumbria University”"
