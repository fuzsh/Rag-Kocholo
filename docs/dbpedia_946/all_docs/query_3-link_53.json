        "text": "We live in an age of crisis and decline. The right presents ‘solutions’ that only worsen the situation, driving a downward cycle in which desperation leads to despair. But the left is also to blame: progressive politicians have consistently failed to recognise both the urgency of people’s need and their receptiveness to new solutions.\n\nAt a stimulating public event next month, Northumbria University’s Common Sense Policy Group will launch Act Now, an inspiring manifesto offering a better vision for Britain.\n\nIn Act Now: A Vision for a Better Future and a New Social Contract, a team of leading researchers present a compelling and achievable vision for a progressive future. They outline clear policies for welfare, health and social care, education, housing and more. Arguing for a rolling forwards of the state, they call for a new era of active citizenship and economic democracy, grounded in robust and resilient institutions.\n\nAt a book launch hosted by Northumbria University, the authors will argue that only a comprehensive and integrated approach, based on clear evidence of feasibility and popularity, can provide a pathway to the secure, democratic and prosperous Britain of tomorrow. This book is the blueprint calling on politicians, pundits and the British people to act now.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nSpeakers at the book launch include:\n\nProfessor Andy Long FREng, Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive, Northumbria University\n\nProfessor Louise Bracken PVC, Northumbria University\n\nProfessor Matthew Johnson, Professor of Public Policy & Chair of the Common Sense Policy Group at Northumbria University\n\nProfessor Kate Pickett, Professor of Epidemiology, University of York\n\nProfessor Danny Dorling, Professor of Human Geography, University of Oxford\n\nProfessor Richard Wilkinson, Emeritus Professor of Social Epidemiology at the University of Nottingham Medical School, Honorary Professor at University College London, and Honorary Visiting Professor at the University of York, and Visiting Professor in SWECW"
