        "text": "My research advocates the role of the Artist Facilitator: exploring the development and practice of this position as mediator, mentor and catalyst. The research draws upon authentic relationships of working within a variety of contexts, partnering with a range of experts in particular fields of practice, drawing on my professional experience, including contemporary art education, gallery learning, cultural management and creative production in an applied theatre situation.\n\nOngoing fieldwork explores the impact of creativity on facilitated experiences, exploring new models of understanding, relating and application. This includes a focus on mutual and symbiotic relations between artists and communities: with particular interest in ethnographies of arts practice including artist-led environments, artist residencies and collaborative learning within a networked community.\n\nThis research investigates and identifies the measurement of artist-led approaches in situations of learning, with an interest in alternative methodologies, curriculum challenges and creative, cultural education. It tests and evaluates experiential approaches towards innovative pedagogy that stimulate critical dialogue and positive interaction and draws on the importance of reflective practice and arts production to challenge aspiration and promote individual development.\n\nDr Judy Thomas describes her practice as that of an Artist Facilitator.\n\nWorking with creative practitioners, teachers, professionals from the cultural sector and students from schools and universities, her research explores collaborative practice within the context of artist-led learning programmes. Recent activities have focused on the essential aspects of creative education in the development of young people’s imaginative futures through the BxNU Participation Action Research Project and the evaluation and professional development for the Paul Hamlyn Foundation funded programme Create Aspire Transform with Berwick Visual Arts. Judy completed her practice-based PhD at Northumbria University in 2014, with her area of study concentrating on the Artist Facilitator role.\n\nAs Head of Department, Judy contributes to the overall success of Teesside University by providing academic leadership of innovative practice and strategic direction to maximise the academic and business performance and development for the School of Arts and Creative Industries.\n\nWhilst working at Northumbria University (2010-23), Judy was actively involved in establishing postgraduate routes for qualified art teachers through the MA Fine Art and Education (2010-2016) and MA Contemporary Arts and Education programmes (2016-18) both in collaboration BALTIC, Centre for Contemporary Arts, Gateshead.\n\nDrawing upon an extensive cultural network has worked in a freelance capacity as Cultural Enterprise and Skills Coordinator for Museums and Archives Northumberland at Woodhorn, leading the Northumberland Creative Employment and Northumberland Strategic Capacity Building programmes. She also worked at Tyneside Cinema as Learning and Participation Programme Producer – Art, supporting The Factory, Tyneside Cinema's Young Peoples’ programme, Random Acts and leading on resources and interpretation for the Tyneside Cinema Gallery. She is a member of Mortal Fools theatre, drama and creative learning charity working as Creative Producer on Future Ready, a programme that uses theatre production as a vehicle to develop confidence, aspirations, social and emotional skills of young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) to prepare them for the transition from education into adult life.\n\nHer previous roles include Learning Manager at Creativity, Culture and Education, Learning Manager at Waygood Gallery and Studios (now BALTIC 39) and Programme Manager (Learning and Inclusion) for Liverpool Biennial. Between 2004 and 2007 she was Acting Head of Education and Public Programme for BALTIC. She worked at BALTIC for four and a half years, with a specific focus on Formal Education. This followed a stint as secondary school teacher of Art and Design, a role that has informed her practice as gallery educator and her interest in learning through questioning and the creation of teaching resources.\n\nJudy is an experienced subject focussed and chief External Examiner in UK Universities of programmes in Art Education including Liverpool John Moores University (2010–2014), Institute of Education: University College London (UCL) (2014–2018) and Goldsmiths University, Department of Educational Studies and Centre for Arts and Learning (CAL) (2014–2019) and the Technological University of Shannon, Limerick (2019-2023)."
