        "text": "The open procurement will select a team for an estimated £5 million contract to design and deliver a flagship new complex bringing together key research, teaching and knowledge exchange activities and supporting the university’s Net Zero ambitions.\n\nThe £90 million CHASE project, planned to complete in 2025, will see Northumbria University’s existing health and life science services relocated from Coach Lane Campus to the City Campus West (pictured) which is located a short distance from Newcastle’s new Farrell Centre.\n\nAccording to the brief: ‘CHASE will be an inclusive centre that will enable us to create social value through our key research, teaching and knowledge exchange activities. It will capitalise on our position as an anchor institution in the region to evidence and grow our impact on inequalities regionally and beyond.\n\n‘It encompasses the research, education and knowledge exchange activity of colleagues currently located at Coach Lane Campus and draws more broadly on the strength in a wide range of related disciplines across the university.’\n\nFormerly known as Newcastle Polytechnic, Northumbria University teaches 37,000 students across to local campuses – City Campus and Coach Lane – and one satellite campus in London.\n\nThe new CHASE complex will be constructed on a site next to the Newcastle Central Motorway on the western side of City Campus, known as City Campus West.\n\nKey aims of the 15,000m² development include creating a flagship new hub focussing on reducing health inequalities across the region. A new energy and data centre will also be constructed as part of the scheme.\n\nBids will be evaluated 60 per cent on quality and 40 per cent on price."
