        "text": "Northumbria University has operated a learning centre which offers under-represented young people progressions into higher education for the last three years. The IntoUniversity Newcastle East Centre has supported more than 1,200 students in the past year alone.\n\nThe centre is a partnership between Northumbria and Newcastle Universities, and IntoUniversity, the UK's largest university access charity. Based at the Monkchester Community Centre in Newcastle's east end, the learning centre provides young people aged between 7-18 with academic support, soft-skill development and experience of the working world.\n\nIntoUniversity Newcastle East worked with 1,283 young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in 2022/23, providing them with advice, guidance and a way to progress into higher education. The average progression rate into higher education for students supported at the Monkchester Centre is currently 74%, compared with national average progression rates for students of 44%, and just 12% locally.\n\nRead more: Northumbria University awarded £388,000 from National Lottery to support innovative mental health scheme\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nProfessor Andy Long, Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of Northumbria University, said: \"A key plank of our strategy at Northumbria is to offer life-changing opportunities through social mobility, so to see how many students we are now working with through IntoUniversity Newcastle East, and their positive progression rates, is incredibly rewarding.\n\n\"Up to 40% of our undergraduates come from traditionally under-represented backgrounds, which is a record of which we are incredibly proud. Our IntoUniversity collaboration, together with a number of other outreach programmes with schools and colleges in the region and beyond, clearly demonstrates our commitment to young people and enabling them to engage with higher education.\"\n\nAcross the UK, IntoUniversity centres have supported more than 52,000 young people in the past year. Maximising the value of working in partnership with IntoUniversity is part of the Collaborative Newcastle Universities Agreement, which brings together the world-leading expertise and collective power at Newcastle and Northumbria Universities to support the health, wealth and wellbeing of our local communities.\n\nDr Rachel Carr OBE, IntoUniversity Chief Executive Officer, added: \"Our collaborative work has become ever more important as the long-term impacts of the pandemic are becoming increasingly clear, in particular on those from the least advantaged backgrounds.\n\n\"The educational challenges following the pandemic are not going away for our young people; it is crucial that we continue to work with our partners to ensure that our support remains impactful and that we adapt where necessary to meet emerging challenges and opportunities.\""
