Northumbria has a rich history going back through its constituent colleges to the late nineteenth century. It was founded as Newcastle Polytechnic in 1969 and inaugurated as a university in 1992.\n\nOffering courses in most major subject areas such as Engineering, Computing, Sciences, Business, Law, Design, Built and Natural Environment, Arts, Social Sciences, Psychology, Sport, Health and many more. Northumbria’s consistently excellent performance in UK quality audits places it at the very top among modern universities.\n\nSixteen of its subject areas have been awarded 22 or more out of a maximum possible of 24 by the Quality Assurance Agency. The cost of living is lower in Newcastle than many other cities in the UK and it has once again been voted the UK’s Top University City! Northumbria boasts one of the best inner-city sites in the country having invested well over £100 million in its city centre campus."
