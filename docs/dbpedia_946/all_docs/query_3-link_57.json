        "text": "Based at Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, our research investigates the impact of nutrients, extracts and whole foods on brain function and psychological health and well-being. A key question of our work asks how can diet and nutrition support optimal brain health across the lifespan.\n\nOur lab facilities were purpose-built for the testing of nutritional interventions in humans and we do so in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines. Our 4 large testing labs contain individual testing desks which are divided to allow visual isolation from other participants.\n\nTCD is a non-invasive method of measuring cerebral blood flow velocity from the basal intra-cerebral vessels through the intact skull. TCD can be combined with other neuroimaging devices such as NIRS.\n\nOur key area of expertise is assessing the effects of nutritional supplements on cognitive function in humans; from children through to older adults. We do this using our own task delivery system COMPASS.\n\nCOMPASS currently comprises over 20 cognitive tasks; many based on traditional assessments, which measure attention, vigilance, working-, spatial- and secondary memory, executive function, mood and tasks which induce cognitive demand. COMPASS tasks have been well validated, with hundreds of published journal articles evidencing their sensitivity to a range of nutritional interventions.\n\nâ\n\nIf you are not eligible or able to take part in any of these current studies please be advised we will have other studies in the near future.\n\nTo make sure you are kept up to date about new projects you can sign up to our participant database and we will contact you when new studies start. Use the link below to sign up.\n\nSign up to the participant database\n\nWe store all information in accordance with GDPR regulations and will remove your details, at any time, upon request. We will only use the information you provide to contact you about Northumbria University research studies and will not pass on these details to any third party organisations.\n\nThe BPNRC has an extensive publication history, encompassing the last 20 years, below is a selection of some of our recent key papers. Our full publication list is also included below."
