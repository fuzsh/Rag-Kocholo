        "text": "Publisher open access agreements\n\nOur publisher or transformative agreements allow Newcastle University staff and students who act as corresponding authors to publish their research articles as open access without additional charges or receive a discount on the publishing costs. Please be aware that the eligibility criteria for these agreements vary and that the agreements the university participates in are subject to change.\n\nEligibilty for agreements is generally based on the corresponding author's affiliation. Please consider who is most appropriate to act as corresponding author in relation to the agreements and authorship guidelines.\n\nSome agreements limit the number of papers that may be made open access. Where this applies papers with corresponding authors who are an honorary member of staff, visitor, or otherwise affiliated with linked organisations (eg NHS trusts) will only be approved if specific funding is acknowledged (from UKRI, Wellcome Trust, Blood Cancer UK, British Heart Foundation (BHF), Cancer Research UK (CRUK), Parkinson's UK or Versus Arthritis). Where this restriction applies this is noted in the agreement details below.\n\nIf you have any questions about your eligiblity for these agreements or how they work in practice, please contact the open access team.\n\nSherpa Services is an online tool that consolidates information about publishers, journals, funders and repositories, which may offer guidance when choosing where to publish open access. Journal checker tool can also provide information about which publishing options are supported by your funder's OA policy. Note that the information of these pages should be used as guidance, but check here for the most up to date information and how to use the agreements.\n\nThe information listed on this page is correct as of March 2024 unless otherwise noted.\n\nLicence choice"
