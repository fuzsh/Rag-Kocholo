        "text": "He's a former Northumbria University student who has landed a major record deal with Afrojack's label.\n\nMax Robinson has been making waves in the electronic music scene after catching the attention of the Dutch DJ and producer in September last year. Afrojack played one of the 23-year-old's house tracks on the mainstage of the Ultra Japan festival and quickly signed the rising star to his label, 'WALL Recordings.'\n\nThis summer, Max released a house track called 'Hold On' after teaming up with fellow rising star Amél. The track has racked up thousands of streams on Spotify, with WALL Recordings hailing the pair as \"the newest sensations in electronic music.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Mum's fury after being kicked off Jet2 flight at Newcastle Airport 'for having diabetes'\n\nREAD MORE: Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nMax, who graduated with a degree in business with financial management from Northumbria University, said: \"After I submitted a demo version of this track to one of the Afrojack demo streams [it was] played live at Ultra Japan later that week. I’m incredibly excited to have it released on WALL. Working with Amél was an amazing experience, he is such a kind and great producer.\"\n\nMax, who now lives in Burnley, continued: \"The reaction to Hold On has been great. It has just hit 10,000 Spotify streams and has been played by many DJs including Afrojack. It has also been on the radio numerous times.\""
