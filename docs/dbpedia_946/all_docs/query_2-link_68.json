        "text": "Northumbria University says 770 students have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nJust 78 of them were displaying symptoms, a spokesperson said, and all those affected are self-isolating.\n\nFlatmates and any close contacts are also going into quarantine and have been advised to book a test if they develop symptoms, the spokesperson added.\n\nA public health source has suggested the figures may need to be reconsidered, however.\n\nThey told Sky News: \"They (the university) are reporting more cases than the whole of the district of Newcastle.\n\n\"We wonder if they are counting all isolating students - including contacts - rather than cases.\n\n\"The local public health team is investigating. The university only gets self-reported data, after all.\"\n\nEllie Burgoyne, 19, a first-year social sciences student, said at least 20 flats in her halls of residence were isolating.\n\nShe too is quarantining after one of her flatmates tested positive a week ago and it \"isn't the most fun\", she said.\n\nA member of staff, who wished to remain anonymous, said there were \"high anxiety levels\" about \"face-to-face teaching\".\n\nAnother staff member - a lecturer - said the number of positive tests was \"terrifying\".\n\nThe university said it was supporting those affected by providing food and other essential items, such as laundry and cleaning materials.\n\nIt is also offering \"welfare support including 24/7 online mental health support and one-to-one support from our wellbeing teams\".\n\nAnd it is \"working together with our students' union, the City Council and other partners\".\n\nBut it warned students who break coronavirus rules would be \"subject to fines from police and disciplinary action by the universities (it and Newcastle University), which may include fines, final warnings or expulsion\".\n\nStudents now confined to their accommodation will continue to learn remotely with \"additional academic support in place to make sure they are not being disadvantaged\" if they miss some face-to-face tuition.\n\nOther universities, including Glasgow and Manchester Metropolitan, have suffered similar problems.\n\nMore than 50 UK universities have confirmed cases of coronavirus as students return to campus, according to analysis from the PA news agency.\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the \"university sector and the government must address this public health crisis immediately\".\n\nNorthumbria said it had \"Covid Response Teams on call that are working closely with NHS Test and Trace\" and local officials.\n\nStudents are also being encouraged to download the NHS COVID-19 app.\n\nCouncillor Irim Ali, a cabinet member on Newcastle City Council, said the city and university had gone to \"incredible lengths\" to create COVID-secure environments for students but \"sadly, a small number of students are undermining these efforts\".\n\nShe added: \"If we are to beat the virus, we need a collective effort.\"\n\nAre you affected by this story? If so, please get in touch via news@sky.com.\n\nAnalysis: Fears student infections may spill over into community\n\nBy Rowland Manthorpe, technology correspondent\n\nThis big outbreak will raise further questions about the wisdom of reopening universities and colleges, not least because the risk of doing so was identified well in advance by the government's scientific advisors.\n\nMinutes from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) meeting of 1 September, released today, warn that opening further and higher education \"has the potential to drive outbreaks\".\n\nYoung people are much less likely to have severe coronavirus, but SAGE warns that transmission within universities and colleges may \"spill over into the community\".\n\nThe movements of students, the scientists say, means \"the risk may be national\".\n\nBut even though we have already seen outbreaks across universities, the biggest risk may yet be to come.\n\nSAGE says larger outbreaks might leak into the community \"towards the end of the academic term, coinciding with the Christmas and New Year period, when students return home\".\n\nManaging that will need, they note, \"national oversight, monitoring and decision-making\".\n\nThe decision has been made and students have gone to university.\n\nBut it's not at all clear how they will be able to leave."
