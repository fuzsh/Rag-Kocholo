        "text": "BINUS Northumbria School of Design (BNSD) is a concept result from intense collaborative efforts between BINUS UNIVERSITY and Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK. It aspires to become the best design school in the region. Indonesia and ASEAN are currently one of the fastest-growing regions globally; with that fast growth, we see a need for skilled professionals who can solve problems through design.\n\nOur BINUS Northumbria School of Design programs are designed to prepare students for professional practice in both corporate and entrepreneurial settings. Supported by excellent well-maintained facilities and labs, our design students can develop their skills and competencies in a high-standard learning environment.\n\nAdditionally, our multiethnic campus and various multi-disciplinary subjects embedded in our curricula provide opportunities for our students to mingle and develop their cultural awareness and communication skills.\n\nBNSD also provides opportunities for our students to participate in immersion trips within Indonesia and abroad that complement students’ research skills and their understanding of cultural aspects of art and design. Students may also choose to spend one year abroad at Northumbria University in Newcastle.\n\nIn helping to launch and expose our students’ innovative work to the world, BNSD also takes part and creates yearly events for students to showcase their masterpieces. Selected students’ works may be showcased during the yearly Jakarta Fashion Week or other design-focused events.\n\nFashion Program (Fashion Design and Fashion Management)\n\nA wide range of career opportunities in the fashion industry is introduced in which students will be prepared throughout the four years of study. The integrated curriculum is designed and developed to support students in building on their technical and non-technical skills as well as engaging with industry.\n\nThe Fashion Program provides an internship program for each student where the student may conduct real projects as a practical study within industrial contexts. The program develops the student’s ability to be involved in professional practices, and ethical and organizational responsibilities.\n\nFurthermore, the industrial internship program provides students with real experience in the workplace and teaches them to cope with the demands of the work environment. In addition, a series of study/field trips to visiting professionals and industries will be conducted to give good grounds for having a broad overview of the industry. These experiences support individual career aspirations and may provide social and professional networks.\n\nFashion Design\n\nThe Fashion Design program aims to challenge students to produce contemporary fashion through design research and critical thinking, with high craftsmanship that underpins garment making. It enables students to explore a range of materials, pattern cutting, aesthetics, printed fashion fabrics, woven fabrics, and knitwear. The program will help students to build a personal philosophy and improve comprehension skills through drawing and illustration, pattern cutting, fabric manipulation, and trend research with the support of contextual fashion studies in response to commercial feasibility. Aware of career diversity in fashion, the program encourages students to pursue their own path in the fashion industry.\n\nPic: BNSD’s Fashion Program at Jakarta Fashion Week 2020\n\nThe graduates of the Fashion Design program are expected to be ready as designers for medium to mass production and manufacture, in response to various market levels. The graduates are also prepared to work for design consultancies, fashion styling, media communication, textile design, and trend forecasting consultancies.\n\nFashion Management\n\nThe Fashion Management program embraces both management skills and creative skills to grasp the creative industry of fashion and equips graduates with creative expertise as well as business knowledge. Promotion, branding, visual communication skills, and product development are the main subjects to be developed in terms of preparing qualified and professional experts for the fashion industry. The Fashion Management stream enables students to have the ability to analyze market needs and forecast the trends in order to develop fashion products and services as well as to design a business strategy.\n\nPic: AKSU by Nadira Alisha Suarga and Arintha Vysistha (Fashion Management alumnae)\n\nIn the Fashion Management stream where students focus on the knowledge of fashion business strategy and promotion, the graduates will be able to develop both creative products and business management skills. They will also be prepared to work in the retail industry, fashion trend forecasting consultancies, trend research companies, and media, advertising, or public relations. BINUS Northumbria School of Design also provides career support for students by disseminating information on the latest job vacancies, internships, and workshops.\n\nAward/Degree\n\nSarjana Seni (S.Sn.) from BINUS UNIVERSITY\n\nBA (Hons.) from Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK\n\nGraphic Design and New Media Program (Graphic Design and Interactive Digital Media Design)\n\nThe Graphic Design and New Media Program offers a variety of opportunities in creative industry areas.
