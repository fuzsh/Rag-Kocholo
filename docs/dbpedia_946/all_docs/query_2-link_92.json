        "text": "The facilities management contract extension means Sodexo will continue to manage the Trinity Square and City Campus student accommodation.\n\nSodexo was appointed FM partner to Trinity Square in 2014, with the contract being extended in 2016 to include Northumbria University’s remaining seven student halls, accommodating over 2,000 students. The organisation provides a range of services which include managing reception, helpdesk, energy management, mechanical and electrical maintenance, and cleaning.\n\nAs part of the new contract, the team will deliver a 7-day-a-week operation, 365 days a year across Trinity Square and City Campus, with the aim of providing a more consistent approach to proactive and reactive service and ultimately an enhanced experience for students.\n\nTo ensure any facilities issues are dealt with promptly, Sodexo will also appoint Student Residential Ambassadors (SRA). SRA’s will receive thorough onboarding and robust training to become first responders for problems such as a leak in a flat. Trinity Square has previously trialled this peer-to-peer approach with the initiative working well. Students in this role will be able to add their experience to their CVs, therefore, improving their long-term employability.\n\nThe new contract will also see Wando, a digitalised FM platform, being introduced so students can report maintenance issues directly rather than visiting the helpdesk. Clients also have access to this integrated solution, so they have real-time visibility of any issues and how they're being addressed across the estate.\n\nSFG20, the mobile-enabled maintenance system which is recognised as the industry standard for building maintenance specifications, will continue to be delivered across the contract, ensuring a timely servicing of assets to reduce unexpected breakdown and inconvenience and minimise costs and extend equipment life."
