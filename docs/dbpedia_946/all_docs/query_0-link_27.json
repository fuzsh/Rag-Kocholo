        "text": "In an ambitious partnership, we’ll provide networks, insight and experience for Northumbria University’s staff and students, centred around the screen industries and moving image culture.\n\nThough projects such as live briefs, masterclasses and curriculum development, our work will ensure students have exposure to the industry before leaving university. Film industry figures and BFI leads will also meet students, local talent and organisations to offer industry networking opportunities.\n\nProfessor Katy Shaw, Director of Cultural Partnerships at Northumbria University said: “Northumbria is delighted to launch this national partnership with the BFI. Preserving, producing and promoting film and television is core to our activities in teaching and research within the creative industries in the North East today. This new national partnership will create a much-needed talent pipeline to address a creative industries skills shortage, training the best new screen talent, in the North, for the global screen industry. On a wider level, we will work together to support the expansion of the screen industry in the North East.”\n\nAll students and staff will also be able to stream critically acclaimed classic, cult and archive films, including specialist collections curated by the BFI, such as Black stories, LGBTQIA+, and visionary directors on the award-winning BFI Player. Jules et Jim, pictured above, is available to stream from 1 September 2022.\n\nSenior Business Development Manager at the BFI, Simone Pyne, reported: “We are thrilled to be partnering with Northumbria to enrich learning and embed moving image culture throughout the university with BFI Player and our upcoming projects. A robust and meaningful relationship between higher education and industry is critical for the future success of film and high-end television, and together we’ll develop transferable and industry specific skills, helping to address the UK’s screen skills shortage.”\n\n“Our approach to partnerships is to facilitate research-enriched learning opportunities, where our students are working with cultural partners to address big questions and global challenges,” added Head of the Department of Arts at Northumbria University, Professor Solomon Lennox. “We are extremely proud of the partnership with the BFI and the scope it provides students to work on responding to matters of social justice within the film industry.”"
