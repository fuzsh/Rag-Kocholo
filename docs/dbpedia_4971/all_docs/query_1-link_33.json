Recently, I attended an event where I had the pleasure of hearing JP Michel speak for the very first time. JP's groundbreaking approach to youth career development completely rocked my world. This is particularly significant for me, as my work primarily involves assisting mid-career clients in their quest to uncover their true calling. As well, I have two young adults of my own who are embarking on their journeys to define their own paths in the world. While JP's message may be geared towards youth and young adults, the \"Challenge Mindset\" he presents is incredibly relevant and effective for individuals of all ages who are seeking to discover their 𝙥𝙪𝙧𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙚 and make a meaningful 𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙘𝙩 on the world. Whether you're a parent, child educator, student, or even a mid-career professional still contemplating the age-old question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\", I strongly recommend taking a few moments to watch JP's thought-provoking TEDx Talk: https://lnkd.in/g_mw3xnD #CareerDevelopment #ChallengeMindset #ProfessionalPurpose\n\nWhat’s your ‘Development Story’? https://lnkd.in/e842hijh There are various pathways to our #zonesofgenius. An example of this is a story of two boys to men who dominated their sport, one had a pushy parent and the other a ‘pully’ parent. The pushy parent had his son specialising at 2 yrs old & competing at 4. The pully parent encouraged her son to go through a ‘sampling period’, experiencing a variety of sports, gaining a diverse range of physical proficiencies. This boy was late to his elite game, competing in his late teens. Both built athleticism & hand eye coordination, both had very different pathways to dominate their sport. One engaged in ‘deliberate practice’ from a very early age. You’d assume he had a marked head start vis a vis 10,000 hrs + (#30violinists & discussed in Gladwell’s ‘Bounce’ book). Reading #DavidEpstein’s #TheRange, he highlights the two routes to success of Tiger Woods v Federer, one the ‘specialist’ v the ‘generalist’. Despite Federer’s later start he was still ranked no 1 at 30. Interestingly the 2014 German World Cup team were predominantly late starters too. Studies show the development progress & sampling period of late starter generalists v specialists also increases & maintains creative capacity. We can link this knowledge to our education system & the development cycle of early years, allowing kids to be creative & diverse in their sampling period. We also know that our young adults need to be prepared for diversification for the future of work. Of course we need specialists however when we are hyper focussed or deep in the trenches we need to stick our heads above the parapet & take in the 360 view. We can also link it to start-up founders & entrepreneurs. It is interesting how many LinkedIn profiles show diverse roadmaps to careers. In a graduation speech Steve Jobs talks about joining the dots, looking back on his sampling period & range of skills which contributed to his success. I would class myself as a generalist, & having many conversations, so do other #entrepreneurs and start up founders, who possess a range of #diverseskills. Whether you are a Generalist or a Specialist on my #startupjourney I am grateful to my pushy & pully ‘parental mentors’ & our team for their #range of #specialist & #generalist #skillsset. #Generationevolve #evolveeducation #futureleaders\n\n🎉 Exciting News! 🎉 My latest blog post is now live and ready to dive into! 📖✨ If you've been following along with my previous posts, you won't want to miss this next chapter. And if you're just joining in, there's no better time to catch up and become a part of the adventure. 🌄🚀 Chapter 3. The Transition. Life is this incredible rollercoaster of transitions – you know, those moments when everything seems to shift and change. From switching schools to starting a new job, or even something as simple as moving to a different city, transitions are like those plot twists that keep our stories interesting. They might feel intimidating at first, like stepping into the unknown, but they also bring the chance to grow, learn, and discover new facets of ourselves. It's like life's way of nudging us forward and saying, 'Hey, there's a whole world out here – go explore!' So, here's to embracing those transitions, riding the waves of change, and seeing where they lead us next. #newblogpost #TheTransition #Chapter3 #LifeExperiences\n\nA Letter to My Students Dear Students, As we stand on the precipice of a new year, a year filled with boundless potential and endless opportunities, I am reminded of the strength that resides within each and every one of you. It is a strength that transcends the challenges of this politically charged time and propels us forward into uncharted territories of possibilities of achievement and growth. Some of you are embarking on a new and exciting journey, college. As you set forth to start new ventures, remember that the absence of failure does not merely define success but rather it is the ability to rise stronger each time you fall. Do not be afraid to push the boundaries of your comfort zone, for it is at the edges of familiarity that innovation takes root. I wish you success in finishing what you've started and doing it well. Take ownership of your endeavours whether they lead to triumphs or setbacks. By owning your mistakes, you will gain the wisdom to overcome them and emerge stronger on the other side. Remember, the most meaningful victories often arise from the most formidable challenges. Stay strong in the face of adversity, and let it be known that your resolve is unbreakable. As you pursue your dreams, stay true to yourselves. Hold fast to your principles, for they are the compass that guides you through the storms of uncertainty. So, let your authenticity be your guiding light, and let your actions reflect the principles that define you. I wish you success in bringing more exciting visions for technological innovations and humanitarian progress in the coming year. You, the young generation, are chosen to be the architects of positive change, creators of a future shaped by your audacity to dream and your tenacity to achieve. Be the catalysts of progress, and may your collective efforts inspire those who follow in your footsteps. May this year be a testament to your resilience and unyielding pursuit of a better tomorrow. Cheers and Godspeed, Yours, Mrs. Gencheva at VoicED #VoicED #newyear #newyearnewgoals #studentsuccess #studentdevelopment"
