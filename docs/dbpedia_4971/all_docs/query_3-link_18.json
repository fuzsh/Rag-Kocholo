        "text": "An Interview with Don Davis by Randall D. Larson\n\nOriginally published in Soundtrack Magazine Vol.18/No.69/1999\n\nText reproduced by kind permission of the editor Luc Van de Ven and Randall D. Larson\n\nWhile his most popular work may revolve around science fictionesque themes – from the early HYPERSPACE to Robin Cook’s INVASION and Peter Benchley’s THE BEAST, not to mention the expansive if under-appreciated music to WARRIORS OF VIRTUE, Don Davis has scored a wide variety of TV movies since the mid 1980s, including numerous episodes of the popular fantasy series, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, STAR TREK: TNG, and SEAOUEST. As an orchestrator Davis has worked on TITANIC, AIR FORCE ONE, TOY STORY, and numerous other films. But it may well be Davis’s latest assignment, THE MATRIX, that will make audiences and Filmmakers take notice. Reuniting him with BOUND directors Larry and Andy Wachowski, THE MATRIX may prove to be a groundbreaking film, scored by Davis with a groundbreaking textural approach that merges with the film’s stunning visuals to create a mesmerizing experience.\n\nInterviewed on the 20th Century Fox Scoring Stage on February 18th in the midst of recording THE MATRIX, Davis describes his score and his views about this film.\n\nAt what point were you brought into this film?\n\nThey gave me a script long before it was started, so I had a lot of time to think about it. They also showed me some storyboards and things they were working on, so we had some pretty early discussions, and I played a couple of things on tape for them.\n\nIt must have been a luxury to have that much time to plan out what you’re doing.\n\nYes, I wish I could do it on every project! But this isn’t your everyday project either.\n\nYou’ve done some fantasy material before, WARRIORS OF VIRTUE, and you’ve done some adventure-horror like THE BEAST, and some science fiction like INVASION, but THE MATRIX is like a whole different realm. How would you describe your approach to this particular film?\n\nI took a post-modern approach, and let me explain what I mean by that. There’s kind of a movement in concert music that I haven’t heard used very often in film scoring. About 15 or 20 years ago, composers started to turn their back on total serialism, that big, dissonant style that was predominant until then. The first composers to do that were minimalists, and were not particularly accepted by the establishment – they also turned their back on a lot of other things like harmony! And there’s a trend that’s going on now that accepts minimalism and that also embraces elements of the dissonant thing that happened before that. It’s really kind of an exciting time in music. There’s a climate of accepting an assimilation of all these styles that have been developing independently of each other for 34 years now, and it’s like all these barriers are starting to drop. It seemed to me that MATRIX would be a perfect canvas to introduce this kind of music into film, in particular because it deals with reality and diffe­rent meanings of reality.\n\nAre you using this approach in a thematic way, or is MATRIX more textural in style?\n\nThere are thematic elements but its not thematic in a theme-and-variations kind of a way. There are motivic ideas that are associated with certain elements of the film. The first thing that I developed is heard in the opening cue, a simple little pattern that is highly contrapuntal, with a whole bunch of different things happening, in layers on top of each other. I used that in association with what’s happening in the actual Matrix, which is supposed to be a simulated reality program. Its a texture more than a theme.\n\nIt seems like the nature of this film demands something a little bit different, a little bit more of a sense of tweaked reality.\n\nEvery scene is questioning that, so in every cue I had to look at it and think how to approach it in a conventional film, and then do something specifically different! It took a lot of time to sit there and think about it! But I think we’re on to something, because I think this post-modern kind of sound resonates in this kind of film, and I think it’s a ground-breaking film. I think you’re going to hear a lot of people talking about this picture, and you’re going to see a response to it in other pictures. I’m hoping it’s something I can continue to develop.\n\nDid your approach change at all from your initial discussions and your reading of the script to when you saw the actual visuals?\n\nWe didn’t really go through a lot of different permutations. It kind of just grew on the same ideas that we started out with. It stayed pretty true to the concept, and also they got me a print of this pretty early, before Warner Bros. even saw it, and I got a chance to actually start working on it prior to spotting. The net result of that was by the time we did the temp dub for the test screening, we were able to test it with the actual score – using demos that I had made for he directors to hear.\n\nSo you didn’t have an actual temp track of somebody else’s music impede what you were trying to do.\n\nRight, I didn’t have to deal with the tyranny of the temp track. That can be very oppressive.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge you faced in this assignment?\n\nThe biggest challenge was one of approach. When you’re dealing with a film that’s as ground­breaking as this, you can’t accept the tried and true, and taking a post­ modern idea and making it into a film score doesn’t mean that you can’t write music that doesn’t function as a film score. There are still things that it has to do, it has to play the tension, it has to add energy to the chases and the fights. I had to be pretty judicious about where I was applying a technique.\n\nWhere are you on the process right now?\n\nWe’re actually exactly half way through scoring. We’ve got three more days of scoring to do – today is the fourth day. We’ve still got the last scene to finish. I’ve written it on synthesizer and I have to orchestrate it, but it’s not really orchestration, I kind of have to go back to the drawing board when I translate this stuff into orchestra. They are expedients when you do something for the demo, and you want to be able to put in all the various nuances when you orchestrate it.\n\nHave you done your own orchestrations?\n\nYes.\n\nHow much music did you write for THE MATRIX?\n\nA hundred minutes.\n\nI assume, since you came into the project so early, that it wasn’t a real rushed job?\n\nNo, I can’t really say that. If I had just sat down and scored the thing conventionally, without doing the synthesizer demos, it would have been a nice leisurely schedule. But I had to do all the demos first, it was important to make as good a presentation for the test screenings as we could possibly get. So I lost a week to mix it all and I had to re-demo things, and all that kind of thing, so as it turned out it was a rush job! But, isn’t it always?\n\nHaving worked with the directors before on BOUND, you’ve established a pretty good working relationship?\n\nYeah. The important thing with those two guys is trying to get them to communicate what they’re thinking. It’s interesting, because they’re so in tune with each other that they don’t really talk, they just kind of say, when they’re looking at something, “is that too-?” “you mean when she says-?” “yeah.” “oh!”\n\nThey understand it but the rest of you are going, “huh?!”\n\nExactly. So, for example, when I demo’d the last sequence, I think Andy’s first thought was “oh, it needs to be more grandiose.” Which didn’t make any sense to me because what I did was basically pretty grandiose! When we sat down and went over it with a fine-tooth comb, it was like, “well, let’s hit this thing here and then come down and then come up to this here and then comedown and hit that over there and hit this over there,” which they hadn’t said before. So it wasn’t that they wanted it grandiose but they wanted it to do specific things, and then build from there, and that, in their crypticspeak, was “grandiose!” So the whole thing is to communicate what they want, because once they get it out it’s very specific. They know what they want.\n\nHow did you link up with them? Was BOUND the first time you worked together?\n\nYes. I met them through the editor, who I worked with on BLACKOUT.\n\nI liked the music for BOUND almost as much as I liked the cue titles on the CD!\n\n(Don Davis laughs). Well, that’s between me and my psychiatrist!\n\nHow did you come up with your approach for BOUND?\n\nThe Wachowski’s don’t seem to really resonate with thematic, melodic ideas. Their concept in music is more malleable, they think of it in terms of textures – they want slams and they want builds and things like that, so the love melody between the two women in BOUND wasn’t melodic.\n\nAnd yet that fit the style of the film, the way they were portraying the story.\n\nExactly. Which brings me to my point, that they know what they want, they’re just so in tune with each other that breaking that barrier can be a challenge. But we kicked around a number of things. The opening of the picture changed a lot, in terms of the title coming up and all of that. Originally it was like about a 10-second “BOUND” and then (the music went) into the closet. I actually came up with a kind of a tribute to Ennio Morricone for the gangster concept, and they liked that a lot and they wanted to start the picture with that, which was good, but when they showed the closet they wanted it to be textural. I said, “in 10 seconds I can’t really state the theme, so I can either start it with texture, or you can put something else in front of the picture so that I can write 30 seconds at least, « and they went in and shot a sequence…”\n\nSo they actually accommodated you for the music there?\n\nYeah, and that was great I wasn’t asking, “you have to do this for me » but they were giving me a contradictory idea, and once I figured out what they wanted, it worked out. They brought in Patti Podesta to do a very nice opening sequence, with the camera going around the shadowy lettering and then it pulls back and you just get the “BOUND” and then it pulls away. In THE MATRIX, the opening is sort of like the same thing, where it has the Matrix code coming down…\n\nLike raindrops.\n\nYeah, and then the letters come up and then they go away. It’s a very textural approach…\n\nIt ‘s almost like it’s intangible. You see it, but you can’t reach out and grab it, and then it’s gone.\n\nExactly. That’s sort of what the film is about, really, other realities. Also, there’s a lot of things in THE MATRIX that deal with reflections. There’s a scene where Keanu Reeves and the boy are bending spoons, and in the spoon you see their reflections. There’s another sequence where he reaches for a door knob – like that M. C. Escher self portrait with the hands on a crystal ball, and you see Escher in the ball, a reflection coming back up. There’s a shot very similar to that as Keanu Reeves reaches for a doorknob, and the hand’s coming out of the doorknob and you see him in the reflection.\n\nThe film, of course, has a lot of pop songs on the soundtrack. How do you fit your score in amongst the songs? It’s become almost expected, to throw some songs in there, even if they may not belong there?\n\nThat’s generally true, but I wouldn’t say that’s necessarily true in this case. They go to a nightclub, they’re enjoying the music, they have a song there, a techno, ultra-hip veneer, certainly something these guys would be listening to, yet there’s also the text of the story in which all that’s false. So, in a way, the disparity between the songs and the score sort of works to that end.\n\nIt’s like the cultural music and then the anti-cultural music. The anti-reality that comes out in the score?\n\nRight, exactly. But also there are some elements of techno in the score, so I don’t think it’s that distinct.\n\nAny final comments about MATRIX?\n\nIt’s tremendously inspiring to be working on a film that’s groundbreaking too. You don’t run across this kind of thing every day. It crosses so many genres… It has some of the most intensive action sequences I’ve ever seen, yet it has this intellectual story that goes back to John Paul Sartre and existentialism, and there are also a number of biblical references, There’s so many things in this picture. There are a lot of sequences that are shot in comic book style, and there’s kung fu fighting!"
