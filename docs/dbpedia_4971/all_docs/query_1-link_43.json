        "text": "Watch this video, just recorded live at IRCE in Chicago, as MarketingSherpa's Daniel Burstein interviewed Don Davis, Editor-in-Chief, Internet Retailer. Chatting in the MarketingSherpa Media Center, Davis revealed some insights into growth trends in global e-commerce.\n\nDavis discussed how e-commerce in China has exploded, with more and more people getting online for the first time and buying products. Marketers should be cognizant of catering to their needs, which include gaining trust through having a live chat and having an effective delivery system.\n\n\"Nobody in the United States has lived through the kind of growth that China is having right now,\" he explained.\n\nAlso, Davis talked about other emerging markets, and the future of global e-commerce.\n\n\"Looking over the horizon, in the emerging markets, like Russia, Brazil, China, there are still a lot people that are not online, or have just come online and are just trying out online shopping. And we've seen in this in the U.S. â€” the longer you're on the Internet, the more you order, you buy more and more,\" Davis said."
