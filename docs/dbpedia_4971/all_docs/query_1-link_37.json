He was exceptional at loading his plate at the buffet!\n\nDon enjoyed the Lake of the Ozarks and moved permanently to the lake in 2010. One of his favorite past-time activities was feeding the wildlife and watching the birds. Bluegrass music was a must!!\n\nDon was a Deacon at Colony Baptist Church in Edwards, Missouri. He enjoyed sharing his faith in Jesus Christ and visiting people in the community while they were in the hospital or sick at home.\n\nHe married Janette Meuschke and she preceded him in death in 2003.
