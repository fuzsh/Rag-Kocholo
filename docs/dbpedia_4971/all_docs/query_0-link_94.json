        "text": "GRAMMY- and Oscar-winning composer Johnny Mandel died on Monday at his home in Ojai, Calif. at the age of 94, the New York Times reports. He composed and arranged music for jazz bands and pop singers like Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett, but is most remembered by his classic movie scores and themes.\n\nTwo of his most celebrated works include \"Suicide Is Painless,\" the theme song for the 1970 film M*A*S*H and its long-running TV series spin-off, and \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" the oft-covered GRAMMY-winning theme song for the 1965 film The Sandpiper. He also scored both films, winning a second GRAMMY for latter score, as well as nomination for the former.\n\nGRAMMY Museum July Content Lineup: Blues Royalty Zakiya Hooker, Country Star Brett Eldredge & Much More\n\nBorn in New York City in 1925, a young Mandel got his start in music playing trumpet in the Catskills while many musicians were overseas for World War II. Soon after, he joined jazz bands in the City, before focusing exclusively on arranging and composing in 1954, according to the Times. Four years later, he moved to Southern California and began his career writing music for Hollywood.\n\nShortly after, he received his first three GRAMMY nominations in 1959 at the 1st GRAMMY Awards, for his debut film score, 1958's noir I Want To Live!\n\nHis next three GRAMMY nominations—and first two wins—came at the 1966 GRAMMY Awards, for \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" which won Song Of The Year, and The Sandpiper's score, which won Best Original Score. The theme also earned him an Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\nGRAMMY Rewind: Watch Barbra Streisand Win A GRAMMY For 'A Star Is Born'\n\nA romantic number, \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" has been covered by countless artists, including Bennett (Manel arranged his version as well) Stevie Wonder, Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass Band, Sinatra and his daughter Nancy Sinatra. Mandel said the song was inspired by the scenic Northern California coast: \"I saw that gorgeous panorama, shooting from Big Sur out on to the ocean. How do you write that? I figured, you write it with a solo voice ... I'd try to translate that into what it looked like.\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP2ZaQ7Wq24' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nFollowing the two GRAMMYs he won in 1966, Mandel earned three more career GRAMMYs, in 1982, 1992 and 1993. The 1992 GRAMMY Awards win, for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s), came from his arrangement on Natalie Cole's \"Unforgettable,\" based on her father Nat King Cole's hit of the same name. Thanks to overdubbing, the powerful track features her father's vocals alongside hers.\n\nOther films he scored include The Americanization of Emily (1964), Point Blank (1965), Freaky Friday (1977) and Caddyshack (1980).\n\n\"Into The Night\" Singer/Songwriter Benny Mardones Dies At 73\n\n\"I only make records when I feel I have something to say,\" Sade Adu asserted in 2010 upon the highly anticipated release of Sade's GRAMMY-winning Soldier of Love album, which arrived after a 10-year hiatus. \"I'm not interested in releasing music just for the sake of selling something. Sade is not a brand.\"\n\nThis lifetime of dedication toward achieving musical excellence helped Sade — vocalist Adu, bassist Paul S. Denman, keyboardist Andrew Hale, and guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman — gain prominence in the mid-80s, also garnering enormous respect from fans, critics, and peers alike. Formed in 1982, the English band is one of the few acts that can still be met with a hungry audience after disappearing from the spotlight for multiple years.\n\nIn an industry where churning out a new body of work is expected every couple of years, the four meticulous members of Sade move on their own time, putting out a mere six studio albums since 1984. Every project becomes more exquisite than the last, but it all began 40 years ago with Sade's illustrious debut album, Diamond Life. Ubiquitous hits like \"Smooth Operator\" and \"Your Love Is King\" appealed to listeners young and old — offering a unique blend of R&B, jazz, soul, funk, and pop that birthed a new sound and forced the industry to take notes from the jump.\n\nAs Sade's Diamond Life celebrates a milestone anniversary, here's a look at how the album helped push R&B forward, and why it's just as relevant today.\n\nIt Helped Set Off The \"Quiet Storm\" Craze\n\nBy mid-1984, Michael Jackson, was riding high off of winning the most GRAMMYs in a single night (including Album Of The Year) for his blockbuster album Thriller, Madonna celebrated her first top 10 hit with \"Borderline,\" and Prince's Purple Rain was just days away from its theatrical release. Duran Duran, Culture Club, Billy Idol, and the Police were mainstays, while \"blue-eyed soul\" in particular had also hit an all-time high thanks to Hall and Oates, Wham, Simply Red, and others. What's more, many Black artists like Lionel Richie and Whitney Houston opted for more of a pop sound to appeal to broader audiences during MTV's golden era.\n\nDiamond Life was refreshing at the time, as it fully embraced soul and R&B. The album offered a chic sophistication amid the synth-heavy pop and rock music that ruled the charts.\n\nSingles like \"Your Love Is King\" and \"Smooth Operator\" introduced jazz elements into mainstream radio. In turn, Sade helped usher in the \"quiet storm\" genre — R&B music at its core, with strong undertones of jazz for an ultra-smooth sound. Sade and Diamond Life also laid some of the groundwork for neo-soul, which saw a surge in the '90s à la Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, and Erykah Badu.\n\nIt Made GRAMMY History\n\nIn the 65-year history of the GRAMMYs, a small number of Nigerian artists, including Burna Boy and Tems, have won a golden gramophone. In 1986, a then 27-year-old Sade Adu made history as the first-ever Nigerian-born artist to win a GRAMMY when she and her band was crowned Best New Artist at the 29th GRAMMYs. Still, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg had to accept the award on Sade's behalf — signaling Adu's elusive nature as she rarely attends industry events or grants interviews.\n\nSince then, Sade has gone on to earn three more GRAMMYs, including Best Pop Vocal Album in 2001 for their fifth studio album, Lovers Rock. The win signified their staying power in the new millennium.\n\nIt Birthed The Band's Signature Song…\n\nWhile Diamond Life spawned timeless hits like \"Your Love Is King\" and \"Hang On to Your Love,\" \"Smooth Operator\" became the album's highest-charting single — and remains the most iconic song in their catalog. The seductive track about a cunning two-timer propelled the band into international stardom: \"Smooth Operator\" skyrocketed to No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nEven non-Sade fans can identify \"Smooth Operator\" in an instant, from Adu's unmistakable vocals to that now-iconic instrumental saxophone solo. As of press time, it boasts over 400 million Spotify streams alone, and has remained a set list staple across every one of Sade's tours.\n\n…And It Houses Underrated Gems\n\n\"Smooth Operator\" may be Sade's commercial classic, but deep cuts like \"Frankie's First Affair,\" \"Cherry Pie,\" and \"I Will Be Your Friend\" are fan favorites that embody the band's heart and soul.\n\n\"Frankie's First Affair\" offers a surprisingly enchanting take on infidelity: \"Frankie, didn't I tell you, you've got the world in the palm of your hand/ Frankie, didn't I tell you they're running at your command.\" And, it's impossible to resist the funky groove that carries standout track \"Cherry Pie,\" which served as a catalyst for some of Sade's later, more dance-oriented hits, including \"Never As Good As the First Time\" and \"Paradise.\" Some of Sade's most poignant statements about lost love, including \"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\" from 2000's Lovers Rock, can be traced back to \"Cherry Pie.\"\n\nDiamond Life's penultimate song, \"I Will Be Your Friend,\" offers both solace and companionship — another recurring theme throughout Sade's music, from 1988's \"Keep Looking\" to 2010's \"In Another Time.\"\n\nIt Was The Best-Selling Debut Album By A British Female Singer For More Than Two Decades\n\nSade has sold tens of millions of albums worldwide, but Diamond Life remains the band's most commercially successful LP with over 7 million copies sold. Most of Sade's other platinum-selling LPs, including Diamond Life's follow-up, 1985's Promise, boast sales between four and six million copies.\n\nThe 7 million feat helped Sade set the record for best-selling debut album by a British female singer. She held the title for nearly 25 years until Leona Lewis' 2008 album Spirit, which has sold over 8 million copies globally.\n\nIt Introduced Sade Adu As A Style Icon\n\nWhen we first met Adu, her signature aesthetic consisted of a long, slicked-back ponytail, red lip, and gold hoops. Sade's impeccable style is front and center in early videos like \"When Am I Going to Make a Living,\" in which she sports an all-white ensemble paired with a pale gray, ankle-length trench coat and loafers.\n\nAdu rocked the model off-duty style long before it became a trend. Her oversized blazers, classic trousers, and head-to-toe denim looks were as effortless as they were chic and runway-ready — proving that less was more amid the decade of excess.\n\n\"It's now so acceptable to be wacky and have hair that goes in 101 directions and has several colours, and trendy, wacky clothes have become so acceptable that they're… conventional,\" Adu, who briefly worked as a fashion designer and model before pursuing music, told Rolling Stone in 1985. \"I don't like looking outrageous. I don't want to look like everybody else.\"\n\nIt Shined A Light On Larger Societal Issues\n\nWhile most of Diamond Life leans into love's ebbs and flows, a handful of tunes deal with financial strife coupled with a dose of optimism, as evidenced by \"When Am I Going to Make a Living\" and \"Sally.\" The latter song characterizes the Salvation Army as a young charitable woman: \"So put your hands together for Sally/ She's the one who cared for him/ Put your hands together for Sally/ She was there when his luck was running thin.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Adu, a then-starving artist, scribbled down portions of \"When Am I Going to Make a Living\" on the back of her cleaning ticket. The soul-stirring \"We are hungry, but we won't give in\" refrain emerges as a powerful mantra in the face of adversity and still holds relevance in 2024. Similar themes appear throughout Sade's later work, including unemployment (\"Feel No Pain\"), unwanted pregnancy (\"Tar Baby\"), survival (\"Jezebel\"), prejudice (\"Immigrant\"), and injustice (\"Slave Song\").\n\nDiamond Life closer \"Why Can't We Live Together\" is a well-done cover of Timmy Thomas' 1972 hit about the staggering Vietnam War deaths. The band wisely doesn't veer too far from the original recording, but Adu's distinctive contralto voice brings a haunting quality that's reminiscent of Billie Holiday.\n\nIt Ignited The Public's Ongoing Fascination With Sade Adu\n\nSince 1984, Sade has only released six studio albums, and a remarkable 14 years have passed since the group's last offering, 2010's Soldier of Love. Ironically, that scarcity — both in terms of music and access to the artist — has actually added to Adu's appeal. Case in point: Sade's sold-out Soldier of Love Tour grossed over $50 million in 2011, and the band still brings in close to 14 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nAdu's striking beauty, mysterious persona, and knack for letting her music do all the talking has earned the admiration of her peers across genres and generations. Everyone from Beyoncé to Kanye West to Snoop Dogg have sung her praises. Drake even has two portrait-style tattoos of the singer on his torso. Prince reportedly described 1988's \"Love Is Stronger Than Pride\" as \"one of the most beautiful songs ever.\" Metalheads Chino Moreno of the Deftones and Greg Puciato of the Dillinger Escape Plan have also cited Adu as inspiration — showing that her influence runs far and wide.\n\nIn 2022, reports circulated that Sade was recording new music at Miraval Studios in France. But upon Diamond Life's 40th anniversary, \"Flower of the Universe\" and \"The Big Unknown\" from the respective soundtracks to 2018 films A Wrinkle in Time and Widows stand as Sade's latest releases.\n\nWhether fans get new music anytime soon remains to be seen, but the impressive repertoire of Adu, Denman, Hale, and Matthewman is one that aims to be truth-seeking and inspiring while exploring life's peaks and valleys. Diamond Life in particular holds up as one of the purest representations of the group's creative legacy, both commercially and musically.\n\nFrom quadruple platinum status to resonating with several generations, Diamond Life will forever stand as a remarkable debut — one that continues to influence music in a multitude of ways.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nJust like that, another GRAMMYs has come and gone — but the 2024 telecast brought many moments that will be immortalized in pop culture history.\n\nIt was the evening of legends, as Billy Joel and Tracy Chapman returned to the stage for the first time in decades and Joni Mitchell made her debut with a performance of her 1966 classic, \"Both Sides, Now.\" Stevie Wonder and Celine Dion honored greats, both those we've lost and those who are dominating today. And Meryl Streep had two memorable moments at the show, making a fashionably late entrance and getting a hilarious GRAMMY lesson from Mark Ronson.\n\nBut it was the younger generation of artists who ultimately dominated the show. Boygenius — the supergroup of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker — won numerous awards in the Rock, Metal & Alternative Music Field. Billie Eilish and SZA scooped up a couple more golden gramophones, respectively, and Best New Artist winner Victoria Monét celebrated three wins in total, also winning Best R&B Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.\n\nTaylor Swift built on the momentum of her colossal year with more GRAMMY records and an unexpected announcement of her next studio album.\n\nCheck out the full list of winners here, and take a look at our top 10 highlights from another show-stopping installment of the GRAMMYs below.\n\nBoygenius Run To Accept Their First GRAMMY Award\n\nBoygenius won the first trophy of their careers during the Premiere Ceremony, and they were so ecstatic they sprinted through the crowds to get to the stage.\n\n\"Oh my God, I want to throw up,\" Lucy Dacus said as the group accepted their Best Rock Performance trophy for \"Not Strong Enough.\"\n\nEven though the trio was over the moon, they weren't entirely shocked by their win: \"We were delusional enough as kids to think this would happen to us one day,\" she continued. Phoebe Bridgers would sing at a local Guitar Center \"in hopes of getting discovered,\" while Julien Baker dreamed of performing in stadiums as she played in multiple bands, and Dacus has been perfecting her acceptance speech for years.\n\nTheir hard work was manifested three times over, as the trio also won Best Rock Song for \"Not Strong Enough\" and Best Alternative Music Album for the record.\n\nKiller Mike Makes A Clean Sweep\n\nKiller Mike had the largest GRAMMY night of his career, winning all three of the Rap Categories for which he was nominated: Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \"SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS,\" and Best Rap Album for MICHAEL.\n\n\"I'm from the Southeast, like DJ Paul, and I'm a Black man in America. As a kid, I had a dream to become a part of music, and that 9-year-old is very excited right now,\" he cheered. \"I want to thank everyone who dares to believe art can change the world.\"\n\nMinutes after his sweep, the LAPD detained the Run the Jewels rapper. However, he was released and still able to celebrate his achievements, Killer Mike's lawyer told Variety.\n\nMiley Cyrus Finally Receives Her \"Flowers\"\n\nMiley Cyrus entered the GRAMMYs with six nominations for her eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation. After she won Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Flowers,\" she delivered a jubilant performance in celebration. \"Started to cry, but then remembered, I just won my first GRAMMY!\" she exclaimed at the song's bridge, throwing her hands in the air and joyfully jumping around the stage.\n\nCyrus' excitement brought a tangible energy to the performance, making for one of the night's most dynamic — and apparently one of Oprah Winfrey's favorites, as the camera caught the mogul dancing and singing along.\n\n\"Flowers\" earned Cyrus a second GRAMMY later in the night, when the No. 1 hit was awarded Record Of The Year.\n\nTracy Chapman Makes A Rare Appearance\n\nLuke Combs breathed a second life into Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\" when he released a cover of the track in April 2023. He quickly climbed to the top of the Billboard charts and received a nomination for Best Country Solo Performance at this year's show. Of course, it called for a special celebration — one that was meaningful for both Combs and GRAMMYs viewers.\n\nChapman joined the country star on stage for her first televised performance since 2015, trading off verses with Combs as he adoringly mouthed the words. The duet also marked Chapman's first appearance on the GRAMMY stage in 20 years, as she last performed \"Give Me One Reason\" at the 2004 GRAMMYs. (It also marked her second time singing \"Fast Car\" on the GRAMMYs stage; she performed it in 1989, the same year the song won Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female and Chapman took home three awards total, including Best New Artist.)\n\nNaturally, Chapman's return earned a standing ovation from the crowd. As Combs fittingly put it in an Instagram post thanking the Recording Academy for the opportunity, it was a \"truly remarkable moment.\"\n\nRead More: 2024 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Full Winners & Nominees List\n\nJoni Mitchell Takes The GRAMMY Stage For The First Time At 80\n\nIn one of the most emotional parts of the night, Joni Mitchell performed on the GRAMMYs stage for the first time in her nearly 60-year career.\n\nAccompanied by Brandi Carlile — who referred to Mitchell as \"the matriarch of imagination\" before the performance — Lucius, SistaStrings, Allison Russell, Blake Mills, and Jacob Collier, Mitchell sang a touching rendition of \"Both Sides Now.\"\n\n\"Joni is one of the most influential and emotionally generous creators in human history,\" Carlile added in her introduction. \"Joni just turned 80, my friends, but we all know she's timeless!\"\n\nMitchell also won her 10th golden gramophone at the 2024 GRAMMYs, as her live album Joni Mitchell at Newport was awarded Best Folk Album at the Premiere Ceremony.\n\nStevie Wonder Salutes The Late Tony Bennett, Duetted By His Hologram\n\nAnother heartfelt moment came during this year's In Memoriam segment, when Stevie Wonder memorialized his friend, Tony Bennett, who passed away from Alzheimer's disease in 2023.\n\n\"Tony, I'm going to miss you forever. I love you always, and God bless that He allowed us to have you in this time and space in our lives,\" Wonder proclaimed. Thanks to a hologram of Bennett, the two singers could duet \"For Once in My Life\" one last time.\n\nThis year's tribute also saw Annie Lennox covering Sinéad O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" Jon Batiste's medley of Bill Withers' hits, and Fantasia's reimagining of Tina Turner's \"Proud Mary.\"\n\nMeryl Streep Gets Educated On Album Vs. Record And Single\n\nMeryl Streep joined Mark Ronson — who happens to be her son-in-law — to announce the Record Of The Year winner, which sparked a funny interaction between the two when Streep thought she was announcing Album Of The Year.\n\n\"A record is an album!\" Streep confidently declared, only for Ronson to give a quick 101 on the difference between Record, Song, and Album Of The Year.\n\n\"It's a really important award, and it's an award that recognizes everything that goes into making a great record — the producers, the recording engineer, and the artist, and all their contributions,\" Ronson explained of Record Of The Year.\n\n\"It's the Everything Award! It's the best,\" Streep smiled.\n\nCeline Dion Surprises The World With A Special Cameo\n\nBefore the GRAMMYs commenced, producer Ben Winston told viewers they would be in for a treat because of a surprise presenter for the final award of the night, Album Of The Year. \"They are an absolute global icon. I think jaws will drop to the floor. People will be on their feet,\" he shared.\n\nIt was none other than Celine Dion, who has largely been out of the limelight after her stiff person syndrome diagnosis.\n\n\"When I say that I'm happy to be here, I really mean it with my heart,\" Dion said. \"It gives me great joy to present a GRAMMY award that two legends, Diana Ross and Sting, presented to me 27 years ago.\"\n\nDion is referring to her Album Of The Year win at the 39th GRAMMY Awards in 1997, when her smash LP Falling Into You won the honor.\n\nTaylor Swift Breaks The Record For Most AOTY Wins\n\nIt was a historic night for Taylor Swift in more ways than one.\n\nShe began the evening by winning her 13th GRAMMY for Best Pop Vocal Album for Midnights. To commemorate the milestone (13 is her lucky number), Swift announced her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, arriving on April 19.\n\nShe ended the evening with a coveted fourth Album Of The Year win, which made Swift the artist with the most AOTY nods in GRAMMY history.\n\n\"I would love to tell you this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song or crack the code to a bridge that I love or when I'm shot listing a music video or when I'm rehearsing with my dancers or my band or getting ready to go to Tokyo to play a show,\" she said. \"The award is the work. All I want to do is keep being able to do this.\"\n\nBilly Joel Serves Double GRAMMY Duty\n\nAfter Swift's momentous win, Billy Joel ended the ceremony with a feel-good performance of his 1980 single, \"You May Be Right.\" Along with being a rousing show closer, it was also his second performance of the night; Joel performed his newest offering, \"Turn the Lights Back On,\" before Album Of The Year was announced.\n\nJoel's performances included three firsts: It was the debut live rendition of \"Turn the Lights Back On,\" his first release since 2007, and the performances marked his first time playing on the GRAMMYs stage in more than two decades. It was a fitting finale for a history-making show, one that beautifully celebrated icons of the past, present and future.\n\nA Timeline Of Taylor Swift's GRAMMYs History, From Skipping Senior Prom To Setting A Record With 'Midnights'"
