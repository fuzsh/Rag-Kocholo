        "meta_description": "\"Step into the rage!\" sing the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, their syncopated melody jabbing menacingly against a funky bass line. Clearly, Patty Hearst -- at least as she appears in Anthony Davis's new opera, \"Tania\" -- is drawn irresistibly to the angry, passionate world that the S.L.A. embodies. And clearly, so is Mr. Davis. During rehearsals for \"Tania,\" which opens on June 17 at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia, he breaks into a grin during this scene, bobbing his head, drumming his fingers to the rhythms. \"That's going to be \n\nbad\n\n,\" he says, laughing.\n\nLater, at dinner, that rage is still on his mind: \"Step into the rage. I identify with that, because I've always had so much rage. Everyone has a Tania in their closet, this rage underneath, just waiting to come out. Every day I see stuff, just in terms of the acceptance of black composers in the music world, that could make me constantly angry, if I let it.",

Clearly, Patty Hearst -- at least as she appears in Anthony Davis's new opera, \"Tania\" -- is drawn irresistibly to the angry, passionate world that the S.L.A. embodies.

Every day I see stuff, just in terms of the acceptance of black composers in the music world, that could make me constantly angry, if I let it.\n\n\"I always tried so hard to fit in, and then I figured out I didn't want to fit. I knew I could never be accepted as a straight-ahead jazz musician, nor would I accept myself as that. I would never be accepted as a Minimalist. I wouldn't be a 'downtown' composer. Because I find all orthodoxies, all doctrines, to be ultimately banal.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Davis's outburst might seem surprising, it reflects a continuing struggle, both personal and professional, that has defined his career as a composer. In fact, that effort to fit in accounts for much of the rage that simmers beneath his joke-cracking exterior. As a jazz pianist who wanted to embrace notated composition and the European avant-garde, he was considered too highbrow by jazz traditionalists. As a composer of concert music, he was viewed with suspicion by the classical-music world, as if he were somehow tainted by his jazz background. And as a black composer who works within a primarily white classical-music establishment, he fights stereotypes at every turn.\n\nSo it is no wonder that Mr. Davis, now 41 years old, has written three operas that all have searches for identity as their central conflict: \"X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X\" (1986), \"Under the Double Moon\" (1989) and now \"Tania.\" When the new opera has its first performance next week (no New York performance is currently scheduled), Patty will sing: \"Who am I? Is what I see what I am?\" It could just as well be Mr. Davis asking those questions.\n\nHis dilemma is no recent development. It seems, in fact, to have colored his childhood. Mr. Davis grew up in a number of college towns in the Northeast as part of a family with a long academic tradition. On his father's side, he is descended from the Davises who helped found the Hampton (Va.) Institute; on his mother's side, he hails from a line of physicians, including several connected with Howard University. His father, Charles T. Davis, was the first black professor at Princeton and a pioneer in the field of black studies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
