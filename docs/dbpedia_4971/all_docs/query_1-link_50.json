        "text": "RFK Jr. qualifies for Texas ballot\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the ballot in Texas, the Texas Secretary of State’s office announced on Thursday.\n\nIn May, the Kennedy campaign submitted over 245,000 signatures to the Texas Secretary of State. Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan appeared in person to help carry boxes of signatures into the state’s elections office in Austin, part of the campaign’s effort to highlight the strength of its signature-gathering operation by petitioning in the state with one of the largest signature thresholds in the country for independent candidates.\n\nOn Thursday, Texas Director of Elections Christina Adkins informed the Kennedy campaign in a letter that Kennedy will appear on November’s ballot, after his petition was found to contain 122,513 valid signatures, more than the 113,151 signatures needed to qualify.\n\nIn July, Texas Democrats sent a letter asking the Secretary of State’s office to reject Kennedy’s petition, arguing Kennedy’s signatures violated several state laws on the proper formatting guidelines for petition signatures. The letter to the Kennedy campaign did not acknowledge the Texas Democrats request.\n\nIncluding Texas, Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in 16 states. He’s also gained ballot access in New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, New Mexico, Tennessee, Minnesota, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Nebraska, Hawaii and Utah.\n\nKennedy is now eligible for 212 electoral college votes.\n\nFact check: Trump exaggerates the role energy prices had on inflation\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said during his news conference Thursday that the United States wouldn’t have experienced “any inflation” had it not been for “bad energy problems” during the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is false. He appeared to be referencing the spike in gas prices that occurred after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. That certainly contributed to inflation at the time, but it was trending higher before then as a result of pent-up demand from the pandemic and labor shortages.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that domestic oil production was higher in 2022 compared to when Trump was president, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nHarris and Walz filmed campaign content in Michigan today\n\nAhead of their event at the United Auto Workers local 900 union hall, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz filmed campaign content for digital platforms, the campaign said.\n\nThe two spent a little over an hour at the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Detroit where they filmed videos. The stop was closed to the press, according to pool reporters traveling with her.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims migrants are being deliberately sent from jails and mental health facilities\n\nIn a news conference Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, former President Donald Trump repeated his familiar story about how migrants are supposedly arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed by foreign leaders from prisons and mental health facilities.\n\n“Why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums?” he said. “These are institutions that are being emptied out, not in South America, all over the world, including South America, all over the world. Prisons are being emptied out into our country because we have a president that’s the worst president in the history of our country.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that jails and mental health facilities around the world are being emptied out so that their inhabitants can travel to the US as migrants. Last year, Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.\n\nRepresentatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.\n\nTrump says his ear has \"pretty much recovered\" following assassination attempt\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump was asked about his ear following an assassination attempt at one of his rallies last month, he said it has “pretty much recovered.”\n\nHe said he doesn’t have any hearing damage, saying “I got very lucky.”\n\nWhen asked if there’s a scar on his ear, Trump said, “yeah, a little bit. Not much.”\n\nToday's campaign schedule: Harris and Walz in Michigan as Trump holds news conference\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will speak at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, around 3 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nHarris will appear with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz before they travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for an event.\n\nThe duo were welcomed by a massive crowd in an airplane hangar in Detroit during their first joint rally as the presumptive Democratic ticket in the battleground state of Michigan on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me, I have to be honest. I don’t know how I can explain to you walking into that arena in Philly or that field out in Wisconsin or right here, to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign,” Walz remarked to the thousands of Michigan voters crowded into an airplane hangar, many standing for several hours packed together on a sunny day.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump announced he would be holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nCNN’s Ali Main contributed reporting to this post.\n\nHarris campaign releases new ad targeting Latino voters across battleground states\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign on Thursday released a new ad targeting Latino voters in key battleground states as they try to court the key demographic.\n\nThe 60-second ad begins with a collage of photos from Harris’ childhood and highlights her upbringing as the daughter of immigrants and the success of her political career.\n\n“With that same determination, she always defended us. As a prosecutor, she protected us from violent criminals. As attorney general, she beat the banks that kicked families out of their homes. As our vice president, she fights for women’s reproductive rights—every day. And she beat the pharmaceutical companies to lower costs for insulin and prescriptions,” it continued.\n\nRemember: A recent New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection found that Harris improved on Biden’s standing among Latino voters, shifting from 50% Trump to 41% Biden in the earlier poll to 57% Harris to 38% Trump now.\n\nCNN Poll of Polls average continues to show a close race for the presidency\n\nA CNN Poll of Polls average of general election polling continues to find no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, with each holding 49% support in an average of recent polls testing the head-to-head matchup.\n\nThe latest Poll of Polls incorporates six surveys released in the weeks since Joe Biden announced his decision to exit the campaign. All six show a race within the margin of error.\n\nA new Marquette Law School poll, fielded July 24-August 1 and released Thursday morning, finds Harris taking 52% to Trump’s 48% among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, with a +/- 4.1 percentage point margin of error. When third-party candidates are included, the poll finds Harris leading Trump, 47% to 41%, among registered voters, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. taking 9%, Jill Stein taking 2% and Cornel West and Chase Oliver at 1% each.\n\nIn the Marquette Law School poll, 10% of voters are so-called “double haters” — those with unfavorable opinions of both Harris and Trump. In Marquette’s May poll, 21% had unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump. About 4 in 10 registered voters (41%) in the new Marquette poll describe Harris as “very liberal,” while 48% describe Trump as “very conservative.”"
