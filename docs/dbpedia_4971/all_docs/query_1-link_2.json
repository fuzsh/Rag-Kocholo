        "text": "Don has been working to improve the quality of life for families in eastern North Carolina. Our region has suffered from years of underinvestment and policies from Washington, D.C., that have disregarded the actual needs of rural communities. Don advocates for action to bring back good-paying jobs, support small businesses, and bolster North Carolina’s agriculture. He is pushing for essential investments to enable eastern North Carolina to thrive, including ensuring access to high-speed broadband, which drives investment in small businesses and industry. Additionally, Don is working to create opportunities for children in rural communities.\n\nDon believes no one should be left choosing between putting food on the table and getting necessary care, medication, or life-saving treatments. He is concerned about the healthcare crisis in eastern North Carolina. Our region experiences higher rates of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, and maternal mortality and morbidity compared to other parts of the state. Families often have to travel long distances to seek treatment. Don is advocating for better care for the aging population in the region, which has more significant healthcare needs. Don is committed to making accessible, quality healthcare available to every person.\n\nDon, a United States Air Force veteran, understands our service members' challenges when transitioning to civilian life. He's keenly aware of the difficulties experienced by military families during and after their loved one's deployment. His commitment lies in improving veterans' education, career training, health, and housing assistance because he knows firsthand their struggles. The current rates of unemployment, homelessness, and suicide among our veterans are too high. Don firmly believes that as a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure that the transition from active duty to civilian life is a positive and supportive experience for our veterans.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience as an educator and a Doctorate in education, Don understands the importance of providing quality, affordable education to everyone. Don is committed to ensuring that all children in eastern North Carolina have access to good public schools, regardless of zip code, and to making college and job training more accessible for all North Carolinians. He wants to expand early childhood education, reduce the cost of higher education, and make significant investments in our HBCUs. He is committed to advocating for our youth and young professionals in Washington, D.C.\n\nDon understands the importance of investing in rural infrastructure for the prosperity of eastern North Carolina in the long run. That's why Don has secured over $1 billion to expand broadband internet in North Carolina and will continue to advocate for reliable access to high-speed broadband internet, which is crucial for economic and educational opportunities. In our rapidly changing and increasingly digital economy, the Internet is an essential service for small businesses, educators, and all citizens, and it must be equally accessible to all. Don also recognizes the significance of agriculture and our farmers as the backbone of our economy.\n\nDon understands the pressing need to protect women's rights, especially now when they are under attack. Congress must take action and codify Roe v. Wade. He firmly believes that a woman's health decisions should remain private between her and her doctor. Don recognizes that choosing when to start a family is deeply personal. He is fighting to improve maternal health outcomes in eastern North Carolina, where the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity are alarmingly high.\n\nDon knows that every person must be treated with dignity and have equal rights under the law. He fought to raise the age at which children could be tried as adults in North Carolina. Don will fight for needed criminal justice reform. Don understands no person in a free and fair society should make less money, be denied government services, pay more for healthcare, lose a job or housing opportunities, or face discrimination in the community or workplace because of their gender, race, creed, national origin, or disability."
