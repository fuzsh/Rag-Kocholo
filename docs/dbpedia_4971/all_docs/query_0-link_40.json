        "text": "When Helga Davis was notified by email in December that she was one of four finalists for the 2019 Greenfield Prize, she thought it was some kind of hoax.\n\n“The subject said you have been nominated and I thought there’s got to be a Nigerian on the other end of this waiting for me to send my social security number. I felt like it came from nowhere,” Davis said in a telephone interview last week.\n\nWhen the call came last weekend that she had won the $30,000 commission for a new work and a residency at the Hermitage Artist Retreat on Manasota Key, she was simultaneously crying and laughing, thinking it might be another prank. She wasn’t sure why two familiar voices were calling from a reception in Sarasota; two of the jurors — Limor Tomer, the jury chair, who runs the concert and lectures series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and WQXR classical music radio host Terrance McKnight — are personal friends and colleagues.\n\nDavis, a multidisciplinary artist who works as an actress, singer, writer and composer, admits she didn’t know about the Greenfield Prize when she first heard of her nomination, nor that other friends had been recipients. But she has been learning about it in the last few days.\n\n“I work a lot and I’m very new to this world of people secretly knowing what you do and saying yes, help her, or this person deserves this award so they can continue doing what they do and bringing what they bring to whatever one or how many disciplines they explore,” she said.\n\nDistinguished company\n\nThe Greenfield Prize was established in 2009 through the Hermitage by the late philanthropist Bob Greenfield.\n\nIt rotates annually among playwrights, composers and visual artists. Previous music winners include Eve Beglarian, Vijay Iyer and Bobby Previte. Last year’s winner, Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Martyna Majok, was chosen based on a proposal to write her first musical about longtime friends who grew up near the site of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.\n\nEach winner is given two years to create a performance or exhibit that will have its first presentation in conjunction with a Sarasota-area arts institution. The work of 2016 winner Coco Fusco, an interdisciplinary artist, is on display at The Ringling through Feb. 17.\n\nEach juror suggested up to 10 people to be considered for the prize — artists don’t submit applications — and together they whittled their list down to four finalists who were asked to submit proposals.\n\nThe three jurors, who also included Karen Sander, former artistic and executive director of the World Music Institute and the director of public programs for the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, saw something in Davis’ creative output they wanted to encourage.\n\nTomer, who also served on the jury that selected Iyer for the 2012 music prize, said Davis was chosen not so much for her specific proposal but because of a combination “of her practice, which is very collaborative; creativity; where she is in her career; her stature; a match between opportunity and her trajectory and the strength of the vision in the proposal.”\n\nMcKnight said the deliberations were grueling. The group first honed in on two candidates before coming to a unanimous decision during a meeting on Jan. 26 where they learned more about Greenfield “and his vision, his objectives and his interests,” which factored into their debate and decision.\n\nThe two finalists submitted proposals that he called “really relevant and pertinent and seemed to have some kind of local context to the Sarasota area and also to what’s happening in our world in the moment. They’re not just stating what’s happening, but looking forward to possibilities of what could happen.”\n\nThree projects in mind\n\nDavis said she has three projects in mind to work on for the Greenfield Prize.\n\nOne is a collaboration with the singer and instrumentalist Shara Nova. Another is further development of her first full-length theater piece “Cassandra” and the third is a reimagining of Langston Hughes’ “Black Nativity,” for which she has written music but needs more time to flesh it out.\n\n“The thing that is most exciting is that while I did submit a proposal for a project, they were very clear with me after that they’re supporting an artist and even with what I submitted, I’m free to change my mind. I can’t say enough about how incredible it is to be supported as an artist, the kind of freedom that would give me to think and to really be where my energy wants to go, what it wants to make.”\n\nWhatever piece she winds up creating will have its first performance in Sarasota in a collaboration with ensembleNEWSRQ, the Sarasota contemporary music collective founded by George Nickson and Samantha Bennett, who were involved in the selection process.\n\nDavis may be best known from her work performing in Philip Glass and Robert Wilson’s opera “Einstein on the Beach.”\n\nWilson has called her a “united whole with spellbinding inner power and strength.” She also starred in Wilson’s “The Temptation of St. Anthony”; “Milton” by Katie Pearl and Lisa Damour; “Elsewhere” by cellist Maya Beiser and Missy Mazzoli; and “The Blue Planet,” a multimedia theater piece by Peter Greenaway and Saskia Boddeke.\n\nDavis has also been active in the Next Wave festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She hosts the Helga podcast, live events for New Sounds and was a host for WQXR’s Q2 Music. She is midway through a year serving as visiting curator at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where she is creating music programs triggered by the art on display.\n\n“It’s great to be here and take inspiration from the collection and see what situations, what people, what music, what words might draw out new ideas and new projects,” she said.\n\nInterested?\n\nThe 2019 Greenfield Prize Dinner honoring Helga Davis will take place at 6 p.m. April 14 at Michael’s on East Ballroom, 1212 East Ave. S., Sarasota. Tickets are $150-$250. 941-475-2098, ext. 2; development@hermitageartistreateat.org. The dinner is part of a weekend of artist discussions and events coinciding with the opening of an exhibit of photos by 2017 Greenfield Prize winner David Burnett. Details will be released later."
