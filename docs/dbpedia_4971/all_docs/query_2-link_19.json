        "text": "IGN FilmForce interviewer Kenneth Plume recently talked to composer/orchestrator Don Davis.\n\nIn his 20-year career as a composer and orchestrator, Davis has composed fifty movies, TV series, and made-for-TV movies, and orchestrated over thirty other movies. His composer credits include House on Haunted Hill, The Matrix, Bound, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Hart to Hart. Movies he's worked on as an orchestrator include A Bug's Life, Titanic, The Phantom, Toy Story, and Die Hard 2.\n\nIn his five part conversation with Ken, Davis discusses his start in the business, the difference between a composer and an orchestrator, the difficulties involved in scoring for television, the differences between scoring for film and television, scoring for animation, working with Randy Newman, James Horner, Alan Silvestri and Michael Kamen, and his work on The Matrix and its two upcoming sequels.\n\nCLICK HERE to access the first installment of the interview. CLICK HERE to access the second installment. CLICK HERE to access the third installment.\n\nPLUME: You also worked on The Phantom with David Newman, and there has been some criticism from music buffs that the film is themeless¿ What are your thoughts on that?\n\nDAVIS: I thought it had a great theme. I'd have to go look for it to play it for you, but I remember that theme as being very distinctive. I haven't heard that criticism before.\n\nPLUME: What are your thoughts on the importance of themes in film scoring? Is it important that there be music that you walk away from the theater remembering?\n\nDAVIS: That depends on the film. These days, a lot of that importance has gone to the songs that have been inserted into the film score, rather than the score itself. I think that was the case with The Matrix ¿ I think you walked away with that Rage Against The Machine song at the end of it. There are some scores, like The Matrix, in which the consensus is that a musical texture is going to be a lot more effective than some kind of hummable thematic situation. Part of that was that they were looking for an unusual, new score¿something that was avant-garde, and melody ¿ as we recognize a hummable melody to be ¿ is not really avant-garde. I've been in situations where directors have told me, \"This has to be a score like none ever before!\" Then they say, \"But we want a melody that the audience can hum.\" That's a contradictory directive. Is melody important? Not in every single movie, but the traditional soaring score with a memorable theme is always going to be part of the film-scoring lexicon. A movie like Avalon or The Natural or even Titanic, for example ¿ without their striking melodic themes ¿ would have been very ineffective had they just been avant-garde texture scores. I guess the short answer is: absolutely, melody is one of them most important things ever, but it's not if you're trying to do something new.\n\nPLUME: Touching upon the increasing use of pop songs in films, what are your thoughts on the increasing reliance on them?\n\nDAVIS: Everyone's opinion is based on their own perception. My perception is always going to be that underscore is important, because that's what I do, but I've come to realize that my perception is not the same as everyone else's. The answer to your question is that it's really not for me to say that songs don't belong in scores like that. For my film-going self ¿ the guy that sits in the audience enjoying movies ¿ I enjoy it more when it's not a song and it's underscore, but I understand that I'm in the minority. The studios are in the business of selling tickets and they're not in the business of pleasing single-minded nerds like myself.\n\nPLUME: Does the desire to place a pop song everywhere harm the composer's ability to give the film what they feel is the right support in scoring it?\n\nDAVIS: Obviously, if there's a song in the scene there's not going to be a score there. David Rose told me once that film scoring is a matter of opinion. The more I do it, the more I realize he was absolutely right. I've seen so many situations where the consensus about what makes music effective in a particular scene is so varied from one person to the next that I can't say that something works in certain situations and something else doesn't. All I can offer is my own perceptions and my own viewpoints. That viewpoint is usually, predictably, that songs don't work that well in pictures and they're overused and annoying and all that kind of stuff.\n\nPLUME: Have you ever found yourself in a position where you were trying to carry an idea through a score, and then been told, \"No, there's a song going there\", and that messed up what you were trying to accomplish with the score?\n\nDAVIS: Of course¿ but at the end of the day, what was better ¿ the song or the underscore? I'm a big believer in thematic integrity and using themes and thematic development to propel a story and a character, and to bring the story to a satisfying conclusion and things like that, but one must take care not to analyze a black-and-white painting for color. It's a bottom-line business, and if a producer's decision to put a song into a movie ¿ to the detriment of the score ¿ sells one more ticket, then it's the right decision. As unfortunate as that may be, that's the reality of it.\n\nPLUME: Getting off dangerous territory for a bit, I have two more names. You may even be able to combine the two¿ Alan Silvestri and Michael Kamen¿\n\nDAVIS: If we combine them, that will be Alan Kamen¿\n\nPLUME: See, now you're just playing games with me¿\n\nDAVIS: Both of these composers I've worked with less than the previous two. Alan Silvestri's main orchestrator over the years has been Bill Ross ¿ who's one of the very best in the business. He also is a major composer in his own right, and he and Alan have been dealing with that however they deal with it. Alan is a very, very strong composer. I don't know Alan as well as I know the other two guys. Michael Kamen¿ I haven't worked for Michael for some time, but he brings a lot to the table ¿ no question about it. I respect Michael a great deal.\n\nPLUME: At what point did the composing work outweigh orchestration?\n\nDAVIS: As was the case when I first started out, it's always been that when things got slow in the composing thing, I would seek out orchestration work. When things picked up with the composing thing, I would turn down orchestration jobs¿ and that's still the case, really. Things are cyclic. When I was doing Beauty and the Beast, I was so busy with Beauty and the Beast that I didn't have time to orchestrate for other guys. Once Beauty and the Beast was cancelled, I had some time on my hands. Now that Matrix has come out and it's successful, I feel that I have less availability as an orchestrator.\n\nPLUME: Have they contacted you about The Matrix sequels?\n\nDAVIS: Oh yeah.\n\nPLUME: So you're onboard¿\n\nDAVIS: So I'm told. Yeah, I've been asked to start thinking about what's going to happen in the next two movies, and I've been thinking about it. Until I see a script ¿ and frankly, I think I'm supposed to see something this week ¿ I can't really make any decisions about what the music's going to do. There are thematic things that I want to expand upon¿\n\nPLUME: If you had your druthers, what would you like to expand upon?\n\nDAVIS: I think it's a fair statement that there's going to be more fistfights. There were three major fight sequences in The Matrix. The first one involved the learning sequence, so I don't think that particular thing is going to be expanded upon, but the last two were major fights between the Agents and the protagonists. There's kind-of a percussive, rhythmic thing that I did in both of those sequences. I've been thinking about how I can take that idea and develop it further. I think there are ways to do that. I don't think I'm revealing any secrets when I say that Jet Li will be involved in the next two Matrix films, which means that the Kung-Fu action is going to be stepped-up significantly. I've been working out in my mind ways that I can take this rhythmic element that I used in the first Matrix and developing that so it's significantly more kinetic and intense.\n\nPLUME: You've also been put into a position that not many composers get, which is being allowed to expand and develop thematics over the course of multiple films in a series¿\n\nDAVIS: That's true, and it's a big luxury. One thing that's true about The Matrix ¿ and unusual about The Matrix ¿ is that The Matrix was not just a film that came down the pike¿there was a lot of creative space built around it for everyone. I think that shows on the screen. The average film that comes down the pike is what I call a \"grinder\", in that they have to get it out and get it out quick and there's sort-of a formulaic thing that they look for. The people that didn't understand that The Matrix was not built that way were kind-of weeded out. The big luxury in The Matrix is not just that the other two have this luxury of creative space around them, but that first one had it too.\n\nPLUME: At what point were you initially approached to come aboard The Matrix?\n\nDAVIS: After I had scored Bound, Larry and Andy gave me the script for The Matrix. I guess they wanted to wait till they heard the music before they gave it to me. It was immediately after we finished dubbing Bound that they gave me the script and told me what was up. The Matrix had actually been written before Bound was written and ¿ as I understand it ¿ Warner Bros. was very interested in it, but they couldn't give this film to a couple of guys who'd never directed before, so they told them, \"Go out and direct a film and we'll talk.\" That film was Bound, and Bound is a shockingly amazing effort by two guys who had never directed before. Things just kind-of fell in to place, really. The short answer is that I did The Matrix because of my work on Bound.\n\nPLUME: When you take stock on your career as it stands now, do you consider yourself a composer, an orchestrator, or both?\n\nDAVIS: Musically, there's really no distinction. I guess this is where I and a lot of other people differ, but I don't consider the act of writing music and the act of orchestrating music a separate act ¿ and I never have. Professionally, however ¿ with the exception of a few cues that Randy Newman might throw me just for laughs ¿ I'd like to be able to say that my orchestration days are behind me. This business we're in, music-to-film, is full of surprises and lack of predictability, so I'm not going to say anything for certain about anything because I ¿ like William Goldman ¿ know nothing.\n\nPLUME: But you're very happy with where your career is now and where it seems to be going?\n\nDAVIS: I'm one happy guy. It's true, if we can wind this down on a philosophical note, that these are really the best years of my life. I've got a great wife, I've got a 10 year-old and an 8 year-old ¿ it's an amazing time for them, and I'm happy with what my career is doing ¿ it's fulfilling, challenging work. It doesn't get much better than this.\n\nPLUME: So, right now, you'd say you're satisfied with where you are in life.\n\nDAVIS: To a reasonable point.\n\nPLUME: So you still have to have that hunger¿\n\nDAVIS: There's that artistic thing that makes us all crazy.\n\nPLUME: Does film work fulfill you as an artist, or is there something you want to do beyond it?\n\nDAVIS: Well, the only thing we haven't talked about is that I've kept active in concert music. Ever since I was in college, I've been writing chamber music and serious orchestra pieces ¿ trying to stay in the forefront of the avant-garde. I've tried to keep abreast of what's going on in that forum. I think that has significantly helped my film career, in that that was the sort of thing the Wachowski's were looking for both in Bound and The Matrix. I really ¿ without being too self-congratulatory ¿ think I can safely say that a composer who hadn't kept abreast of what was going on in the concert world would not have been able to write the score for The Matrix. That being said, I was in Paris in April ¿ I had my violin and piano piece played at the Pompidou Centre ¿ and I was in France the previous Fall ¿ where I was a finalist in a composition competition there. I've kept busy doing that.\n\nPLUME: Does that give you more, less, or the same fulfillment as film? Or different?\n\nDAVIS: Different than film. The fulfillment in film is one of professional satisfaction. The musical satisfaction can be there when it is there and is not there when it isn't. The bottom line is that we ¿ as film composers ¿ have a job to do, which is to bring the director's vision to life. It's a different job than \"write great music\", and can be mutually exclusive. When writing pieces for the concert stage, I'm not beset by these operative strictures: what if the director doesn't like this, what if it drowns out the line there, what if it's too big for the scene, what if it's too small for the scene¿ I can just write music, and write the kind of music that I think should be written. That's a completely different kind of satisfaction.\n\nPLUME: I have one final question¿ Looking at your credit list, there's something that begs to be answered. How did the conductorship for The Eagles special come about?\n\nDAVIS: That came about because The Eagles were re-forming, and Don Henley asked Randy Newman who he should get to arrange and conduct the orchestra parts, and Randy told him to get me. That's really as simple as it was. The third kind of satisfaction is doing something completely different from the above. It was a rare opportunity to get involved in popular music that's so direct ¿ much more direct than underscoring, and certainly more direct than concert music, which is music for a very limited audience. This is music for an audience that's unlimited, and that's an amazingly exciting environment.\n\nPLUME: And you also got a little view into Randy's other world¿\n\nDAVIS: That's right. I did some work on Randy's Faust album, and I also did some conducting for Randy on his orchestral tour. Randy did a pops concert with the Chicago Symphony that I conducted, and also the Colorado Symphony and the San Francisco Symphony.\n\nPLUME: And would it be something you'd do again if the opportunity presented itself?"
