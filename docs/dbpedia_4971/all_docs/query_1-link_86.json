        "text": "Press Release\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Don Davis (NC-01) hostedrepresentatives from Huntington Ingalll’s (HII) Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS), eastern North Carolina community college leaders, and workforce development officials for a roundtable discussion on the importance of bringing good-paying jobs to North Carolina’s First Congressional District.\n\nThe conversation has ignited an exciting new opportunity for collaboration and connection to more good-paying jobs in the East. Newport News Shipbuilding employs a large number of North Carolinians and is currently adding 3,000 new personnel each year, with plans to increase that number to 4,200 by 2026 to meet demands for the Department of Defense.\n\nIn addition to expanding the workforce, the Navy intends to expand the fleet in the long-term. In FY2024, the Navy procured nine vessels and plans to procure eleven vessels per year, including submarines and ships. In FY2025, the Navy requested 134 unmanned vessels in total, including 78 unmanned surface vessels and 56 extra-large unmanned underwater vessels.\n\n“In northeastern North Carolina, there is a growing need for employment opportunities that can provide young people with long-term careers,” said Congressman Don Davis. “Currently, Newport News Shipbuilding employs more than 1,100 North Carolinians and serves as an economic engine in the region. We can help young people from our region by fostering these relationships and connecting them with good-paying jobs. With the increased need for more naval ships and submarines, we’re inspired to work closer together to pave the way for a brighter future in the East.”\n\nTrained personnel has been identified as one of the biggest hindrances to meeting the increased workforce demand. The industry is currently experiencing a 30-year decline in the workforce, with the average time to train a new employee still being 2-5 years. With a low available workforce, national security risks may arise when it comes to submarine and ship production. They are currently making nine ships a year and hoping to increase that number to 11.\n\nNorth Carolinians with no technical skills in shipbuilding can earn a starting salary of $45,000 at Newport News and would be paid through the training process. The current median income in Pasquotank County in northeastern North Carolina is $34,081.\n\n“We appreciate Rep. Davis bringing together workforce development leaders in Northeastern North Carolina for these important meetings,” saidXavier Beale, Vice President of Human Resources at HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding Division. “At NNS, we don’t just build great ships; we build great careers. We’re excited by the momentum underway to create talent pipelines for North Carolina residents to train locally for jobs at the shipyard and ease their ability to work at NNS while still living in North Carolina.”\n\nOne of the paramount challenges in the shipbuilding industry is ensuring the training and qualification of personnel for its specialized and demanding tasks. Recognizing the urgency of this matter, leaders from multiple community colleges in eastern North Carolina have united to address this challenge. Congressman Davis played a pivotal role in facilitating constructive dialogue between shipyard executives, community college leaders, and seasoned veteran shipyard workers.\n\n\"Many of our neighbors in northeastern NC have benefited over the years from the opportunities available for those who choose to work at the shipyard,” said Brandi Bragg, Regional Coordinator at Northeast Pathways to Prosperity. “We appreciate the connections and continued collaboration with our partners north of the border. We are committed to increasing the options and opportunities available to the people of northeastern NC.\"\n\n“Supporting the maritime industry is vital to workforce development in northeastern NC. This industry is embedded in the fabric of our culture and has helped to develop a proud and skilled workforce,” said David Whitmer, Director of the Northeastern Workforce Development Board.“More importantly, it has contributed to the growth of many self-sustaining and thriving families here in the northeast.”\n\nThis meeting served as the initial gathering, and Congressman Davis aims to hold future meetings. This initiative holds significant potential to develop a solution that benefits stakeholders and crucially, creates much-needed job opportunities in the region.\n\nIssues:Jobs and the Economy"
