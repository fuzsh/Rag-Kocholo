        "text": "Chip Davis\n\nComposer, keyboardist, drummer, record company executive\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nThe only child of Louis and Betty Davis, Louis Jr.— or Chip, as his mother called him—grew up in Toledo, Ohio, where his father taught high school music and his mother played the trombone. At age five, Chip took piano lessons from his grandmother and he later learned to sing and play the oboe and bassoon. Due to a blood disorder, Davis’s physical activities were restricted. So he focused his energy on music, and by the time Davis attended high school, music was his sole interest. Davis attended the University of Michigan, from which he graduated in 1969 with a music degree.\n\nDavis went on tour with the Norman Luboff Choir for a time, during which he met Jackson Berkey, a noted pianist and keyboard player, who became a close friend and later part of Mannheim Steamroller. Davis also played with the Toledo Symphony, taught high school music, and learned to play rock and roll drums for gigs with local groups. Much of what eventually became the album Fresh Aire I were pieces that Davis composed to interest his high school students in classical music by giving it a jazzy cast.\n\nBy 1972 Davis was earning a living jingles for an Omaha advertising agency, while unsuccessfully trying to interest record companies in a demonstration tape of his works. Davis teamed up with advertiser Bill Fries to record the highly successful Old Home Bread commercials. The commercials, which related the saga of the colorful Old Home Bread delivery truck driver C. W. McCall, evolved into the hit country and western song “Convoy” that sold more than seven million copies and engendered the major motion picture Convoy, starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali McGraw, and Ernest Borgnine, for which Davis composed the soundtrack. One hit led to another and then a string of gold records and international recognition. Davis is not fond of country and western music, yet he paradoxically earned the title Country Music Writer of the Year in 1976. “Sometimes the irony of it gets to me,” Davis told T. L. Henion of the Omaha World Herald. “Everything that I’m able to accomplish now came about largely because of the success of a country and western song.”\n\nThe financial success of “Convoy” allowed Davis to concentrate more intensely on his own work. While working as a musical director at the recording studio Sound Recorders, Inc. in Omaha, Davis heard his music come alive. Davis loosely gathered together musicians and called them Mannheim Steamroller, after an eighteenth-century musical style called Mannheim Roller, to play his style of music, a blend of classical and pop. In 1974 he founded American Gramaphone to record, produce, and market Fresh Aire, “aire” meaning “song.”\n\nDavis combines authentic period instruments, such as harpsichords, clavichords, recorders with synthesizers. While his music has been solidly placed in the vanguard of New Age music—characterized by the use of synthesizers, computers, exotic instruments, multiple overdubbing, and is often amelodic—Davis’s style is obviously rooted in the tradition of classical music. Each representing a different season, Fresh Aire (spring) is baroque in tone, Fresh Aire II (fall) reflects medieval influences, and Fresh Aire III (summer) is characterized by renaissance and contemporary sounds. Fresh Aire IV (winter) focuses on twentieth-century avant-garde repertoire. According to Davis, later albums reflect his interest in intellectual themes: Fresh Aire V explored outer space with French Impressionist overtones and Fresh Aire VI interprets the music and mythology of ancient Greece.\n\nThe American Gramaphone label is known for the very high quality of its recordings and packaging. Davis uses state-of-the-art equipment and innovative techniques, which include using a separate microphone for each acoustic instrument in an ensemble.

It was one of the first labels to commit strongly to the compact disc. The sales success of Davis’s recordings has been largely by word of mouth, for the Fresh Aire recordings have received little radio play and though they are frequently used by the ABC television network, Davis is not credited.\n\nThe holiday-inspired albums Mannheim Steamroller Christmas and A Fresh Aire Christmas introduced many listeners to the Mannheim Steamroller sound for the first time. These contemporary holiday classics, which numbered Number 2 and Number 1, respectively, on Billboard’s 1989 “Christmas Hits” list, have gone platinum, and Mannheim Steamroller Christmas was nominated for a Grammy. A Fresh Aire Christmas is unique both in its recording process and in that eleven of the carols on it were chosen by vote among thousands of fans on the American Gramaphone mailing list. The twelfth carol is an original composition by Davis. An additional Christmas album is tentatively planned to appear in the midnineties.\n\nSince 1978 Davis has lead Mannheim Steamroller on an annual tour, which by 1988 had drawn large, responsive, and loyal crowds. The performing ensemble includes Davis on drums; Jackson and Almeda Berkey on keyboards; Rick Swanson on percussion; and Eric Hansen on bass, dulcimer, cello, and other stringed instruments. Several local musicians are usually hired in each city to supplement the core group’s synthesizers, computers, and other special sound equipment. The shows are multimedia events, featuring slides, dances, film animation, and computerized lighting. Davis has also moved into the realm of videotapes. The video samplers feature clips that had previously been presented in Mannheim Steamroller’s live concert performances, as well as those seen on network and cable television.\n\nDavis takes on many responsibilities with American Gramaphone, yet he finds his greatest satisfaction in composing. He told Henion, “I do a lot of different things, but I consider myself a composer. That is what I do best; make music from experiences in my life and hope somebody who listens to it can grab those feelings.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nAll on the American Gramaphone label; recordings on compact disc and magnetic tape\n\nFresh Aire I.\n\nFresh Aire II.\n\nFresh Aire III, 1979.\n\nFresh Aire IV, 1981.\n\nFresh Aire V (with the London Symphony and Cambridge Singers), 1983.\n\nFresh Aire VI (with the London Symphony and Cambridge Singers).\n\nMannheim Steamroller Christmas, 1984.\n\nA Fresh Aire Christmas, 1988.\n\nSaving the Wildlife.\n\nFresh Aire Interludes, (interludes from Fresh Aire I-IV ).\n\nYellowstone: The Music of Nature, 1989.\n\nA Fresh Aire Motivator.\n\nClassical Gas (Mason Williams and the Mannheim Steamroller).\n\nRecordings on videotape\n\nThe Video Sampler I (includes “Come Home to the Sea” from Fresh Aire VI, “Africa” from Saving the Wildlife, “Crystal” from Fresh Aire IV, and “Deck the Halls” and “Stille Nacht” from Mannheim Steamroller Christmas).\n\nThe Video Sampler II (includes “Interlude I” from Fresh Aire I, “Door IV” from Fresh Aire II, “Mere Image” from Fresh Aire III, and “Escape from the Atmosphere” from Fresh Aire V).\n\nA Fresh Aire Christmas Video (includes “Little Drummer Boy” from A Fresh Aire Christmas, “Deck the Halls” from Mannheim Steamroller Christmas, as well as Grammy nominated “Silent Night” and “Bring a Torch Jennette Isabella”).\n\nSources\n\nChicago Sun-Times, August 8, 1989.\n\nLos Angeles Herald Examiner, November 20, 1986.\n\nOmaha World-Herald, April 23, 1989.\n\nSan Francisco Examiner, November 7, 1986.\n\n—Jeanne M.

He told Henion, \"I do a lot of different things, but I consider myself a composer. That is what I do best; make music from experiences in my life and hope somebody who listens to it can grab those feelings.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Davis not only continued with the Fresh Aire series but also began to extend the Mannheim Steamroller vision to other themes by recording such albums as 1994's To Russia with Love and 1998's Renaissance Holiday. The 1999 Mannheim Steam-roller Meets the Mouse album was released in collaboration with the Disney entertainment conglomerate, one of the few instances in which Davis operated in an orbit that reached beyond his Omaha headquarters. Davis continued to live in Omaha, where he married and raised three children.\n\nWith the 2000 release Fresh Aire VIII, Davis announced that he was bringing the Fresh Aire series to a close. That album was accompanied by its own DVD, and was recorded in a digital surround-sound format that rivaled those of cinematic extravaganzas. Mannheim Steamroller's shows by this time had become extraordinarily complex undertakings, with a staff of 200 and enough equipment to fill nine semi-truck trailers.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Davis occasionally recorded under his own name but mostly continued to use the Mannheim Steamroller designation. His new creations, both in concert and on recordings, were explorations of a single theme; the 2003 Mannheim Steamroller releases American Spirit and Halloween were examples. No matter how complex Davis's music became, it rested essentially on its original mixture of classical music with Davis's own compositions. Always exploring new media, Davis penned a Christmas book, A Night Like No Other, in 2003. Large entertainment companies were knocking on Davis's door by that year, eager to learn the secrets of his continuing success during a period of implosion for the music business. He might have answered with a brief observation he made to the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2002 regarding his relationship with his audiences. \"I'm just really out to wow them and take them on a journey to infinity,\" he said.\n\nFor the Record …\n\nBorn Louis (Chip) Davis, Jr.; son of Louis (a music teacher) and Betty Davis; married; wife's name Trisha; children: three, Kelly, Evan, Elyse.
