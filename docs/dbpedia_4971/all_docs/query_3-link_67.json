        "text": "Every minute passes faster than the one before it. With every moment we grow older, the totality of our time spent alive diminishes the perceived length of a given stretch of time. Do you remember the way the summer between, say, fourth and fifth grade stretched out endlessly before you on the last day of school? Now, with deadlines and projects and everyday life consuming the day-to-day, a month can vanish almost into thin air. As we begin to move faster and faster into the future, the little quotidian details compress our view until we look up and the summer is nearly over. The pages of my calendar exist only to be perpetually in need of updating, it seems, and it feels like the first truly hot day of June was something like last week.\n\nTime dilations, while still only a theory, are a fact of life for football fans. The remarkable speed at which the season flies by, when stacked up next to the longest offseason in sports, is all the proof I need to say that the guy credited with the theory of special relativity may have been onto something. After all, Caltech had a football team when Einstein taught there.\n\nThe 2024 Carolina football season starts in exactly three weeks, a harbinger of the fall and a welcome return of my favorite sport. I’m well documented here as being overly excited and joyfully ignorant of the perils awaiting a Tar Heel football fan this season. I reckon, by the time we’re halfway through the season (at this rate, sometime next week), there will be plenty of time for sober realism. The ramp up to the season opener is a time for wild optimism. Omarion Hampton is going to be toting the rock for the Heels this year! He’s incredible and that’s going to be fun! The defense should improve! Someone will be playing quarterback!\n\nThere’s not much longer to wait, although of course that’s all relative. Three weeks until we’re back in the swing of things. 21 days until we enter the future, with new conference mates and a 12-team playoff. It’s closer than it’s ever been this offseason, and we’ll never have more time to hope for the best.\n\nHowever quickly it flies by, it’s always a great day to be a Tar Heel."
