Most of the songs were written in the last century. A few were commissioned by Cantus. One, a meditation on rejection and acceptance called N-400 Erasure Songs by Australian-American composer Melissa Dunphy, is breathtaking.\"\n\nJuly 16, 2023 - KPTZ 91.9 Port Townsend\n\nMelissa Dunphy on Cats in our Laps\n\n\"Since moving to America, I've become very passionate about art as a vehicle for thinking about how society could be better -- could do better... and commenting on social justice and political topics. \"\n\nJune 5, 2023 - KDHX\n\nChoral Review\n\n\"For a text based on such horrific history, Ms. Dunphy’s work is actually quite restrained, never trying to approximate the volume of combat. Instead, she employs understated effects like whispering and melisma, and resists any temptation to over-sentimentalize the words.\"\n\nMay 24, 2023 - Opera Philadelphia\n\nQ&A with composer Melissa Dunphy\n\n\"Something I love about the next generation of composers is that, like me, they are not wedded to a particular style of music or traditional idea of what opera looks like. The music in \"Everything for Dawn\" draws upon pop genres like electronica, rock, and Broadway, as well as what might be termed “classical music,” which I think is a reflection of what we are exposed to in the 21st century, with the ease of access that the internet provides. \"\n\nMay 6, 2023 - ChoralNet\n\nWomen composers in St. Louis\n\n\"It is complemented by another past SLCC commission, Dunphy’s “Voices of Gallipoli” which sets – to haunting effect – epitaphs found on Australian graves at Lone Pine Cemetery. \"\n\nApril 20, 2023 - Whitman Wire\n\nWWU’s ICantori choir showcases stunning new work\n\n\"The last line is, ‘When we falter we make amends.’ That line always gave me chills because we can acknowledge that we have had major faults in the past and still do have major faults, but when we work to [be] greater, we can fix things, even if it’s slow.\"\n\nFebruary 16, 2023 - Cleveland Classical\n\nDunphy & Goldfinger’s Alice Tierney makes its debut at Oberlin College\n\n\"Melissa Dunphy’s score is a magical mix of styles that supports each change of emotion.

Her choral textures are inventive and the Pembroke singers rise to the challenges of the piece very successfully.\"\n\nOctober 6, 2022 - VAN Magazine\n\nThe Troubled Kids Club\n\n\"This is not just a story that I’m trying to tell. This is also excavating a lot of my history.\"\n\nAugust 18, 2022 - Gramophone\n\nMeeting Anna Lapwood, classical music's dream ambassador\n\n\"One work I hear them record, Halcyon Days by Melissa Dunphy, has particular poignancy. The final piece sung at the end of an academic year, it was also the first sung on returning from Covid, and Lapwood asks the singers to remember what it felt like to be together again after the challenges of the pandemic. It works.\"\n\nAugust 16, 2022 - The Chautauquan Daily\n\nVocal ensemble Cantus to sing about immigration, celebration of cultures\n\n\"The lyrics used for the song come from the N-400 documents that U.S. immigrants must fill out to apply to become naturalized citizens. Dunphy, who emigrated from Australia to the United States, often found herself frustrated and perplexed by these documents. Using erasure poetry, she drew the lyrics from the forms to create the song cycle, which will close out Cantus’ concert this afternoon.\"\n\nFebruary 23, 2022 - Opera Uprising Podcast\n\nComposing Activism - Melissa Dunphy (Pt.

Australian-born composer Dr. Melissa Dunphy joins Moveable Do this week to discuss growing up in Australia with immigrant parents and how that shaped her political ideology. \"\n\nOctober 16, 2021 - Star Tribune\n\nThe voices of Cantus rise to the challenge once again\n\n\"Each of the three movements proved powerful, the first haunting and mournful, while the second pulsed with the anxious spirit of one sinking in the quicksand of bureaucracy. But reassurance arrived in the program's finale, a beautifully moving embrace upon arrival for which Dunphy created both music and text.\"\n\nJune 30, 2021 - ClevelandClassical.com\n\nLocal 4 presents an engaging variety of music by women in final concert of She Scores\n\n\"After a year with no shortage of pre-recorded performances, watching musicians play together live and unmasked — even through a computer screen — feels like a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nJune 24, 2021 - American Theatre\n\nThe Unique Tension of ‘Pass Over’ in a Public Park\n\n\"Included in Melissa Dunphy’s sound design were ever-present sirens, realistic enough that I and many other would pause for a moment to lift one side of the headphones or turn the volume knob down just to see if there were actually police on their way. \"\n\nApril 25, 2021 - Metro Philadelphia\n\nMetro honors Philly Power Women\n\n\"Contemporary composer Dr. Melissa Dunphy has made her mark on Philly in more ways than one. The Australia native has created a unique and enlightening musical experience by taking social or political commentary and transforming it into works of art.\"\n\nMarch 30, 2021 - Broad Street Review\n\nAbigail Adams in song\n\n\"“I’m primarily a storyteller,” said Dunphy, whose musical oeuvre includes vocal, political, and theatrical compositions. Her website carries a mission statement to “bring the voices of women and minorities to the stage,” and she often sets prose that doesn’t easily lend itself to composition.\"\n\nMarch 24, 2021 - Philly Metro\n\nHow one local composer is remembering the ladies of past and present\n\n\"Composing has always been in Dunphy’s blood as someone with a past in theater and music, but the history spin was sparked by some digging… literal digging in the dirt.\"\n\nMarch 24, 2021 - 6abc Action News\n\nNew choral work puts Abigail Adams' letter to music in Philadelphia\n\n\"\"I love setting really interesting cool, political texts to music,\" Dunphy said. \"And then, I hear that the museum is bringing the letter to Philadelphia, and so then things just sort of started cooking. I was like, 'What if I write a choral piece for this?'\"\"\n\nMarch 23, 2021 - NBC Philadelphia\n\nAbigail Adams' Words Inspire Modern Museum Music\n\n\"The song is my love letter to the women and the people of color back then who, you know, dreamed of a future like this, but maybe thought it was impossible.

(All the roles, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s only woman, are gender-reversed.)\"\n\nNovember 10, 2020 - DC Metro Theater Arts\n\nIN Series’s amusing ‘Gonzales Cantata’ musicalizes a congressional grilling\n\n\"Composer Melissa Dunphy has taken the transcripts from the 2005 congressional hearings on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, accused of improperly firing several attorneys, and has had performers sing those texts operatically, accompanied by organ.\"\n\nNovember 6, 2020 - DC Theatre Scene\n\nReview: The interrogation of Alberto Gonzales hits its musical mark in Gonzales Cantata\n\n\"Composer Melissa Dunphy’s work reminds us, perhaps even comforts us – we’ve been on the brink of political and moral disaster before.\"\n\nNovember 6, 2020 - Mother Jones\n\nBiden’s Lead Has Philly Protesters Elated, But “So Much More Work” Remains\n\n\"“Listen, Biden is aggressively fine for this moment in American history,” said Melissa Dunphy, a musician who joined the rally with a sign—featuring Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty—that read, “Fuck Around and Find Out.” Biden’s likely victory was, as Dunphy said, a “first step,” but nowhere close to the last gasp for Philadelphia’s progressive movement. \"\n\nNovember 5, 2020 - AFP\n\nProtesters pro- and anti-Trump converge at Philadelphia vote counting center\n\n\"\"I'm here because American democracy is at risk,\" said Melissa Dunphy, a college professor demonstrating with \"Count Every Vote.\"\"\n\nNovember 2, 2020 - DC Theatre Scene\n\nGonzales Cantata: A moment of profound American shame gets set to music\n\n\"Melissa Dunphy’s The Gonzales Cantata, which will begin its run on In Series’ website November 3, is an opera with a unique libretto – transcripts of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearings on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’ December 7, 2006 decision to fire seven United States Attorneys. \"\n\nOctober 29, 2020 - Chor Leoni\n\nChor Leoni: Further Inside with Melissa Dunphy\n\n\"And I love music - some of which has purely musical inspiration - like purely harmonic or purely melodic inspiration.
