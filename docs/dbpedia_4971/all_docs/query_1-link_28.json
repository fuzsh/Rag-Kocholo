None of this would have been possible without the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and your partnership with us. Let's continue multiplying faithful stewards, mobilizing peer accountability groups, and growing generous giving to God’s work together! #GTPat5\n\nWhen you trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, what did you expect to happen? Did you think your life would change? Did anyone teach you what to expect or how to live a godly Christian life? God has an extraordinary plan for your life, and in this wonderful sermon entitled Sanctification: The Process, Dr. Stanley discusses how God prepares you for service and transforms you into the image of Christ. Charles Stanley: Sanctification: The Process, Part 2 ❤️🔥 https://lnkd.in/ew-my4hY\n\nOur salvation for all eternity comes exclusively through the LIFE, PASSION, DEATH, and RESURRECTION of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we claim as our own when we BELIEVE in Him. \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved\" (John 3:16-17, KJV). Read full chapter\n\nSCRIPTURE READING FROM TODAY - JULY 3, 2024 Scripture Reading Ephesians 2:19-22 You are no longer aliens or foreign visitors: you are citizens like all the saints, and part of God’s household. You are part of a building that has the apostles and prophets for its foundations, and Christ Jesus himself for its main cornerstone. As every structure is aligned on him, all grow into one holy temple in the Lord; and you too, in him, are being built into a house where God lives, in the Spirit.\n\n\"As it was in the early 19th century, the collective heart of Baptists is the same today: to work together so that we can share the Good News of Jesus Christ with every tribe, nation, and people as our Lord commanded us.\" Read Hughes full article here: https://vist.ly/3dvi2\n\nChurch! \"And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.\" - Jeremiah 3:15 KJV \"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:\" - Ephesians 4:11-12 KJV \"Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.\" - Hebrews 10:23-25 KJV\n\n12th November 2023 ROR Review - First sentence, first paragraph; the summary of today's devotional article! \"You've been exalted to the highest position of authority, dominion and power.\" ~ Pastor Chris. Dear Brother/Sister, your place is with Christ Jesus Himself. Don't step down to a lower life; live the glorious life of dominion and power. Enjoy the entire article and have a great day. #InspiredByROR#InspiredByTheWord\n\n\"23 Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, 24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.\" Colossians 3:23-24 -- One of the most common verses used in terms of serving and working. But what we fail to see here is that we work and serve people because we have already received our ultimate reward -- our salvation in Jesus Christ. What we do is but a response to that. . . . #prayer #businessstrategy #christianbased #biblebased #christiancreative #christianfreelancer #christianliving #christianbusinessowner #bibleprinciples #marketingprinciples #intentionalchristiancommunity #christianmarketing #christianreels"
