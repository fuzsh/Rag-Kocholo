        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — A new emergency alert called the Missing and Endangered Persons emergency alert code will notify people just like AMBER Alerts do.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to establish this emergency alert code on Wednesday, according to a news release.\n\nAlthough modeled after the AMBER Alert, the Missing and Endangered Persons emergency alert code hopes to fill the gap between AMBER and Silver Alerts. That’s why it will focus on missing adults between the ages of 18 and 65.\n\nFCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said the alert will help law enforcement save more lives by getting information out.\n\n“Just last year thousands of adults went missing or was endangered and fell outside of the criteria to issue an AMBER Alert,” Starks said. “And so, today’s order closes that critical gap.”\n\nStarks said the alert will especially help Native American communities, which make up 2.5% of all missing person cases in the United States despite only being 1.2% of the population.\n\nOnce transmitted, the Missing and Endangered Persons emergency alert code will go out to radio stations, TV channels and emergency notifications on people’s phones."
