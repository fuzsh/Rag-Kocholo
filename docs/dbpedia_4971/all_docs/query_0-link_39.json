        "text": "The man behind the Steamroller machine\n\n©by Leo Adam Biga\n\nAppearing in the December 2018 issue of New Horizons\n\nMusic is a birthright for Grammy Award-winning American Gramophone and Mannheim Steamroller founder Chip Davis.\n\nThe Omaha transplant has built an international following with his music, which has earned some half a billion dollars in retail sales over four decades. Millions more have come from performing multimedia concert dates across the U.S. and the world.\n\nAn acknowledged entrepreneurial and branding whiz, he’s leveraged his music’s appeal to partner with Walt Disney Company, NBC, Universal Studios, NASA and the National Parks System.\n\nIn terms of fame and riches, only one other Nebraska musician can rival Davis – singer-composer Paul Williams, a Grammy and Oscar-winner. But where Williams is a solo act, Davis fronts a multi-dimensional machine under the Mannheim Steamroller name.\n\nDavis maintains a large production-recording-distribution complex in North Omaha. It covers five acres and four buildings, three of which are interconnected. He sponsors two national touring bands performing Steamroller’s popular Christmas catalogue. The tours nearly rival the Nebraska Theatre Caravan’s tours of A Christmas Carol.\n\nDue to a bum arm from neck surgery, Davis no longer tours, though he still makes surprise appearances. His touring musicians travel via luxury buses, but the grueling every night schedule is too strenuous for him.\n\nHis private Hawker 900 XP jet gets him wherever he needs to go quickly and in comfort. He keeps a vacation home in Florida.\n\nIn December he’ll fly to Orlando to conduct a 60-piece orchestra at Universal Studios playing the music from The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. The concerts are held in an outdoor bandshell he calls “absolutely beautiful.”\n\nHe creates and oversees a branded line of non-music products, including food items that range from a spay-on meat baste to a cinnamon hot chocolate mix.\n\nBreaking the mold\n\nThis third-generation musician from small town Ohio is credited with helping give birth to the New Age genre for his signature fusion of classical and rock. Before that though he was hard on the path of becoming a symphony orchestra player. But then a funny thing happened on the way to his dream. He went from the world of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart to the great American Songbook to a rock opera to advertising jingles to winning country music writer of the year to hitting upon his synthesized Steamroller sound of baroque meets easy listening.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time someone in his musical family made a detour. His parents made their own break from classical to commercial. His father Louis played saxophone in the Glenn Miller touring band. His mother Betty played trombone in the NBC Symphony and in Phil Spitalny’s All Girl Orchestra.\n\nHis family’s connections to American popular music run deep. His country doctor grandfather loved the (John Philip) Sousa marches and the lead trombonist in the Sousa band taught Chip’s mother in high school.\n\nHis folks. plus an aunt and uncle, studied at the University of Michigan’s prestigious music school. His father taught music, led choirs and built instruments. His mother also taught music. Davis intended following suit as a teacher and classical performer.\n\nInfluences\n\nReflecting on how much of his own musical predisposition is inherited and how much is a result of environment and exposure, he said, “I think there’s probably a combination of both. I grew up around it. Third generation both sides of my family. Music was flowing in my veins from the time I was born. In fact, my mother said when I was 6-months old I could hum the melody to ‘Silent Night,’ which is pretty crazy at that age. So I must be just full of music.”\n\nThe precocious only child started on piano at 4 with his grandmother as his first teacher. He conducted in front of the family console radio. At 6 he composed a four-part chorale ode to his pet dog, Stormy, who died.\n\n“It broke my heart.”\n\nIn addition to being immersed in music and feeling compelled to create it, he said, “I had some of the best teachers you could ever have.” His accomplished father taught music theory-music history and was Chip’s main teacher through high school.\n\n“I had all of that and then I went to the University of Michigan’s famous music school.”\n\nFor his primary instrument, Davis chose bassoon though he’s best known as a percussionist. It may surprise some this instrumental icon was a singer through his early 20s.\n\n“I sang in a boys choir when I was about 10-years old in Oregon after our family moved there.”\n\nHe was invited to sing with the Vienna Boys Choir.\n\nThe family moved back to Ohio, where Davis was in his dad’s high school choir.\n\nAt Michigan Davis sang in the glee club and played drums in the marching band. He joined select students performing with the Toledo Symphony Orchestra.\n\nHis classical tradition focus was so intense he missed the en vogue music of the 1960s.\n\n“I wasn’t sensitive to it at all. I mean, I certainly knew who Diana Ross and the Supremes were because they were right over in Detroit. I had roommates not in music that would go to concerts at the Fisher Theatre in Detroit. But it kind of slipped by me. I was so classically oriented that I didn’t really notice what was going on.”\n\nWhile his friends listened to the latest hits from Motown and British Invasion rock bands, he stuck to classical.\n\n“I listened to WJR Detroit – a big 100,000 watt AM station – primarily because Karl Haas (later an NPR fixture) had a classical music program on every day and I would listen to that. I actually learned quite a lot from his explanations of different things, of composers and pieces and the way they’re constructed.”\n\nMusic kept him so preoccupied he was oblivious to the Vietnam War and civil rights protests on the Michigan campus, which was a hotbed of student activism.\n\n“I didn’t even notice that.”\n\nHe did not participate in the counter-culture revolution at Michigan, but the school gave him the foundation for his professional music career.\n\n“I still have a close connection with them,” he said. “When I was first there as a student the university opened a new music building. Now they’ve added a new wing and I’m fortunate enough to have my name on the Chip Davis Technology Studio. It’s full of computers and things we use for composing today.”\n\nHe donated about a million dollars to create the tech suite, which serves as a project workshop, research laboratory and multimedia gallery for courses in Sound Recording and Production, Interactive Media Design, Immersive Media and Performance Systems.\n\nDavis finds it ironic that Michigan became a legacy school – “a lot of family ended up there” – when his family’s from Ohio, not Michigan.\n\nLittle did he know a youthful fascination with electronics would be revisited when his music career took off.\n\n“I had this ridiculous notion in high school I was going to go into electrical engineering – until I found how much math it took. Then I was like, Well, I’m pretty good at music, I guess maybe I’ll do that. I built electrical things, including an oscilloscope, from a Heath kit. For a senior science project I used it to analyze music notes. For example, flute is almost all sign waves.”\n\nHe could never have imagined how electronics would intersect with his music years later.\n\n“Right, exactly,” he said in his state-of-the-art recording studio where everything’s digitally programmed.\n\nThe room’s on its third control board, though it too has grown nearly obsolete in the new digital age, he said.\n\n“We don’t even use it anymore. Everything’s done on Pro Tools” (an Avid Technology digital audio workstation for Microsoft Windows and macOS). Everything’s in the computer as far as controlling levels and all that.”\n\nExploration\n\nEver the searcher, Davis loves the freedom technology affords to explore.\n\n“Something astounding you can do today you couldn’t just a few years ago is sample different instruments. I have a new album coming out called ‘Exotic Spaces.’ I wrote pieces about exotic spaces like the Taj Mahal. I had access through Pro Tools to all these Indian instruments. I wrote with those instruments and I did it in the style of Indian music but with my Mannheim spin.\n\n“I wrote another piece about Egyptian pyramids and I found Egyptian instruments, including one called the nay, which is a flute that almost sounds like a bagpipe.”\n\nPerhaps his “farthest out” experiments have involved capturing natural sounds.\n\n“I’m a scuba diver. I’m way into that,” he said. “I have Navy grade hydrophones because I’m interested in capturing sound under the surface of the ocean. On one dive we recorded a whale singing. On this new album ‘Exotic Spaces’ I use the whale song as the basis for a song I wrote the accompaniment around.\n\n“I almost always write in the key of C because you don’t have sharps and flats and all that unless you want to add them. It’s an easy key signature to maneuver around in. Well, that darn whale was singing in the key of C. I had no idea beforehand. but when I put down the whale song track in the mix I discovered it was singing in the same key I write in.”\n\nHis Ambience series records terrestrial sounds.\n\n“I’ve got microphones out in the woods back on my farm. They’re 200 feet apart in a square and record the sounds of nature out there. The sound engineers here come out and run the gear for me.\n\n“I wanted to go further. I used to go to Canyon Ranch (Arizona) quite frequently as a chill-out place. Once, my crew and I home-based there and went out and recorded desert sounds, which are entirely different from Great Plains sounds. Then we went to the west coast and got the sounds of waves.”\n\nOn a Northern Minnesota excursion to record loons he and his crew arrived at Black Duck Lake. Listening devices were strategically placed before inclement weather set in. The team holed up in a cabin listening to what the remote devices picked up.\n\n“Out of the blue, we heard a loon. I said, ‘Hey, hit the record button quick.’ We were getting this great loon sound. Then all of a sudden the door to the cabin opens and my son comes in, saying, ‘Did you get that?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘That’s a loon whistle i got down at the Sinclair station.'”\n\nIntegrating music wit nature adds an ethereal depth of atmosphere and background listeners find soothing.\n\n“I write the music over it. I write the music around the sounds. The sounds take precedence. The amount of music content is maybe only a third out of an hour. It’s not music heavy, it’s nature heavy. We’re hardwired to recognize those sounds.”\n\nThe Ambience series is available in four-channel DVDs. Davis sends film crews to capture images of nature that are then married with the nature sounds and music.\n\n“People can play the DVDs in their home theater systems. Within three minutes, you are there. You close your eyes and you’re in the desert, you’re at the ocean. It seems to be real good chill out kind of stuff.”\n\nHe’s since applied this nature-music sonic approach to health and healing. His Ambience Medical company creates calming psychoacoustic tracks for use in medical settings. His Ambient Therapy combines specially-recorded sounds of nature with distinctive music content via a patented Ambient Therapy System.\n\nThe system is used in post-op treatment rooms at the Mayo Clinic, for example.\n\nHe also has a series on seasons.\n\nNature\n\nThis work combining nature with music has intersected with his abiding passion for wildlife conservation. His interest in the natural world, he said, goes back to his childhood, when he “played all the time in the woods.”\n\nHis “Yellowstone: The Music of Nature” project raised over $3 million for conservation efforts between the concert tour and album.\n\n“I did ‘True Wilderness’ for Glacier National Park. The head ranger at the time was from my dad’s high school choir. She had grown up in my hometown. One of those quirky things. I did ‘Saving the Wildlife’ in conjunction with Lee Simmons as a fundraiser for the Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo’s Species Survival program.”\n\nHe recently gave $350,000 to fund an Eagle Mew for the Raptor Woodland Refuge at Fontenelle Forest.\n\nAt his 150-acre farm nestled in Ponca Hills north of Omaha, Davis keeps horses and wolves. A buddy built his rustic-chic 10,000 square foot Swiss Chalet-style home there.\n\nFrom classical to country\n\nThe expansive breadth of his musical life may not have blossomed had he not diverged from the classical path. Soon after graduating college he got an opportunity that changed the course of his life and career when he signed to sing with the famed Norman Luboff Choir.\n\n“I met Norman when he came to do a workshop in Toledo. He took new singers on every year. I asked if I could audition and at his invitation I went to his New York apartment to audition. He hired me on the spot.”\n\nSinging tenor with Luboff freed Davis to be more diverse in his own music appreciation and experimentation\n\n“Absolutely. It was the way Norman was. He wrote original compositions but he was a fabulous arranger.\n\nHe had songs of the West and songs of the South, and we did those different songs on tour. So I became very familiar with a lot of different styles that my classical upbringing kept a clamp on. It really opened a floodgate of, Hey, let’s try this.”\n\nThus, when Davis came to Omaha for an early ’70s workshop, he was ripe for branching off in new directions. While here he met the late noted choral conductor Mel Olson (Master Singers), who informed him Talk of the Town Dinner Theatre needed a music director for a regional production of Hair.\n\nDavis had never seen the musical but was just curious enough about the opportunity to apply. He got the gig.\n\n“They needed somebody to rewrite the arrangements from the Broadway size down to where it could be played by a handful of players. I wasn’t familiar with any of that type of music and I had to learn it and then figure out how to rearrange it. So I did.”\n\nThe show proved a smash.\n\n“We did six shows a week. It was supposed to run six weeks and it ran 26.”\n\nSinger-actress Karla DeVito was in that production and Davis became good friends with her. She later performed with national rock acts, on Broadway and in feature films. She’s married to actor Robby Benson.\n\nOmaha began as a waystop for Davis but he found his creative home and career-making work here.\n\n“It completely opened me up. During that time I met the guys at Sound Recorders. They asked me to write jingles for their ad agency clients, On my off days (he was teaching) I started writing jingles. I found out I could make a really good living doing that.”\n\nHe became music director at Sound Recorders, where he met Bozell & Jacobs creative director Bill Fries.\n\n“Bill and I started on the C.W. McCall path and that just took precedence over everything.”\n\nSome Steamroller fans are too young to remember, but Davis first made the big-time writing music to a series of Old Home Bread commercials penned by Fries. The folksy campaign was built around a fictional trucker named C.W. McCall, the Old Home Filler-Up an’ Keep-on-a-Truckin’ Café and a waitress named Mavis.\n\n“Bill was writing these sagas of C.W. McCall and he was trying to find voice talent to do it the way he heard it in his head and the guys at the studio said, you sound great doing it, just do it yourself. I got involved writing the arrangements and songs .\n\n“The C.W. McCall thing picked up and really took off.\n\nPeople knew the commercials.”\n\nThe spots not only boosted the regional food company’s sales but caught the attention of media, advertising and music executives, especially when the campaign won the ad world’s highest honor – the Clio.\n\n“Then we started writing a lot of original material,” said Davis. “I think we wrote 90 songs altogether.”\n\nRealizing they were onto something big, Davis, Fries and Sound Recorders owner Don Sears formed American Gramophone to capitalize on these country and western musical tales, which they packaged and released as albums and singles.\n\n“When we made the first 45 (record) we got it into all the jukeboxes. We had an ad campaign with a budget of $50. We turned it all into quarters. Everybody at the studio would grab a pocketful of quarters and go punch up the tune on jukeboxes at bars around town so that people could hear it and know that it existed.\n\n“Later, we hired an independent promoter to go out and plug radio. In a very short period of time we sold 350,000 units.”\n\nA subsequent single, “Wolf Creek Pass.'” was a crossover hit – even making Casey Kasem’s nationally syndicated “American Top 40” countdown show..\n\nThe second McCall album, “Black Bear Road,” contained a song called “Convoy” with an elaborate CB (Citizens Band) radio narrative. To everyone’s surprise, the single went viral.\n\n“On the album we had ‘Convoy’ buried in the middle, as the seventh cut, because we thought it was too crazy. The DJs found it on their own. The DJs made that work. We didn’t push it at all.”\n\nThe success of “Convoy” led to commercial endorsement deals for CB radios, even lawnmowers.\n\nNashville came calling.\n\nIt even led to a 1978 major motion picture, Convoy, that took the song as its title. The legendary but troubled Sam Peckinpah directed the movie for EMI Films. It starred A-listers Kris Kristofferson, Ali McGraw, Burt Young and Ernest Borgnine.\n\nThe film shot in New Mexico. At that point in his life Peckinpah was an alcoholic and drug addict. He was nearly fired from the chaotic production and when he submitted a nearly four-hour long cut, the studio did ax him and editor Garth Craven. A new editor, Graeme Clifford, recut the film and drastically shortened it. Davis was then approached to score the film that his song inspired. The studio asked Davis to record a sample track before committing to him.\n\n“They wanted me to record it in L.A. and I said, ‘No, I want to record it in Omaha.’ They were like, ‘All right, go try it.’ I recorded two or three cuts and synched it to film. We knew how to do all that stuff down at Sound Recorders. I took the sample out to L.A. and played it for the suits and they said, ‘You’ve got the job.’ I asked, ‘When do you need it?’ ‘Three weeks.'”\n\nDoing a complete film score in that short of a window pushed Davis to the limit but he loved the challenge.\n\n“It was frame-to-frame scoring. I had to synchronize all the music to the cuts.”\n\nThe movie did good box-office, due no doubt in part to its subject coinciding with the CB craze.\n\nFinding his niche with Mannheim Steamroller\n\nDavis was tempted to try his luck as a freelance film scorer in L.A. but thought better of it.\n\n“It’s right when Mannheim Steamroller was about to start. I thought if I go out to L.A. I’m going to be up against these hot composers like James Horner and John Williams and I just decided that seems pretty competitive and out of my control. But I have a lot more control with my own record label and music back in Omaha, where I have a shot of maybe making something out of this.”\n\nThe money Davis made off McCall funded his 18th century classical rock endeavor. As Davis readied his first Steamroller album, ‘Fresh Aire I,’ he had no idea how it would be received by the masses.\n\nThe first inkling he was onto something came from music producer Jimmy Bowen and TV music composer Mike Post, whose engineer John Boyd went to work for Davis.\n\n“I played a couple tracks off of ‘Fresh Aire I’ and they said, ‘That’s what you should be doing. This McCall thing is great, you’ll make a bunch of money on it, your ship’s coming in, but this unique blend of classical and rock is worth exploring.'”\n\nThe first market inroad came when Sound Recorders owner Don Sears “got placement for the first ‘Fresh Aire’ album in hi-fi stores,” said Davis. “Then we started going to the Consumer Electronics Show, renting a booth and passing out these albums as demo material.”\n\nDavis and Fries found a formula in McCall that worked in the country category, “but this was a completely different animal,” since no one had ever heard anything quite like ‘Fresh Aire’ before.\n\n“I wanted to call it eclectic because it’s eclectic music. The retailers all thought I said electric,” Davis recalled.\n\nEven Davis wasn’t sure what he had.\n\n“I was so classical that when writing the first ‘Fresh Aire’ album I thought I was writing rock ‘n’ roll. I had no idea it was still sounding like classical music to a lot of people. I didn’t realize what I was doing and that this hybrid mix was coming out as a combination. Just because I put bass and drums with it didn’t make it rock. I kind of forgot I still had harpsichord and string orchestras in it.”\n\nDo it yourself\n\nBeing an independent music creator and record producer may have been his greatest stroke of genius.\n\n“The really fortunate thing for me is that the RCAs and industry guys I pitched it too did not take it. If they had taken it and if it didn’t work right away, I would have been dead in the water and never would have recovered. By distributing it ourselves, showing up with a trunk-full of records at Homer’s and other places around town, we got a good jumpstart right here in Omaha. That taught me how to go on with it.”\n\nBesides, “he said, “I had more passion for it I’m sure than they did in New York or Los Angeles because it was my creation. And I had more control.”\n\nHe suddenly found himself both a musician and a businessman.\n\n“The music part, I certainly was prepared for, but I had no business training at all. I was really flying seat of the pants trying to figure out how to run a company and how to promote and how to advertise and sell and do distribution and all that.”\n\nWhat explains the appeal of his music and it selling something like 50 million units to date?\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know,” he said. “It’s different and it has a sound of its own.”\n\nMannheim Steamroller merchandising not only includes food lines but casual clothing, holiday books and personal comfort items like lotions and candles. Davis calls it “connect-the-dots marketing.”\n\nFor him, it’s all part of the same creative urge.\n\n“it comes from the same place the music comes from. It’s just another way to do what I do and create. I mean, I love all of it. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”\n\nHis family enjoyed the ride as Steamroller gained momentum and found unexpected mega success.\n\n“When I first started touring with my own band my parents went went me. My dad was part of the crew as the piano tuner. Mom went along, too. They went all over the place with us. They were really proud.”\n\nWhen Davis needed a harpsichord with a distinct sound, his father built him one.\n\nFringe benefits\n\nTravels for his music have brought him to Great Britain to record with the London Symphony Orchestra, St. Petersburg, Russia to score the Goodwill Games, the Czech Republic to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and the namesake of his group’s name, Mannheim, as part of a nine-city tour in Germany.\n\n“I’ve been all over the place/”\n\nHe’s recorded with notable guest artists such as popular pop singer Johnny Mathis and he produced an album with the late superstar John Denver. Denver went morel mushroom hunting on Davis’ farm.\n\nDavis’ wide-ranging interests have given him access to NASA space subtle launches. He provided the technology to make hyper-accurate film-sound recordings of Discovery and Atlantis launches. He’s met several astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin.\n\nMannheim Steamroller has performed at the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree ceremony during the Clinton, George W. Bush and Trump administrations.\n\n“I’m around a lot of cool people and get to see a lot of cool things.”\n\nHis celebrity isn’t something he dwells on.\n\n“You don’t think about fame when you are concentrating on composing and producing music and building your own record label-company and planning for the future.”\n\nDavis is grateful his music resonates with so many.\n\n“I couldn’t do this without my fans obviously.”\n\nHe’s also wise enough to know he’s often been in the right place at the right time.\n\n“I feel very fortunate I’ve had the retail breaks I’ve had. People gave me a shot with my 1984 Christmas album (the first of many Xmas recordings). With their help, we got it out there. I’m really fortunate to have run across these people and to be given those opportunities.”\n\nTies that bind\n\nThere there’s the artists he’s gathered around him for studio sessions and concerts. He credits concertmaster and violinist Arnie Roth with landing stellar classical musicians.\n\n“We’re talking real big-deal players from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra I could never have gotten to myself. French Horn superstar Dale Clevenger played all my sessions. We had just monster players in the studio. I couldn’t have done it without Arnie.\n\n“And my musicians are just intensely loyal.”\n\nFor the Steamroller tours, contract musicians are hired at each stop to join the touring players to create a great big sound machine on stage.\n\nThe first violin player Davis hired to play, Steve Shipps, is associate dean at UM’s School of Music and he sits in as lead violinist whenever Steamroller plays in that area.\n\n“It’s like a gigantic family of musicians stationed in different places,” Davis said.\n\nSome of Omaha’s best known musicians have collaborated with Steamroller: Jackson and Almeda Berkey, Joey Gulizia, Ron Cooley, Becky Kia, Chuck Penington.\n\nThe music connections are everywhere.\n\nOmaha native Jonathan Swoboda plays keyboards in the Universal Studios orchestra Davis conducts. Swoboda’s father was the attorney who trademarked American Gramophone for Davis.\n\nDavis has had the same business partner and the same agent for decades. He became-remains friends with the head buyer who got his work in Target.\n\n“These relationships have lasted,” he said.\n\nA gift shared\n\nMost of all Davis is grateful for the gift of music and the ability to share it. He feels obligated to.\n\n“This music comes into me from somewhere. I don’t know where. I feel like it comes from above or from God or the ultimate creator. I feel its pouring into me and it just kind of leaks out.\n\n“Sometimes it comes to me in my sleep.”\n\nHe may awaken in the middle of the night with an idea and stay up all night to write it. He keeps a voice recorder handy to whistle or hum notes that appear.\n\nThe framework for his music is always classically based.\n\n“There are very distinct forms like a Rondo form, a Saraband form. I follow those forms but I plug my own notes into them. It’s a super structure.”\n\nMaking a difference with his music is icing on the cake.\n\n“Doing things for people like the Ambience project makes me feel I’m repurposing different things I have been given a shot at doing. To not take advantage of it would be a sin.”\n\nHe’s made sizable donations of CDs to U.S. troops, military hospitals, the VFW and military support groups.\n\nFor the Strategic Air Command & Aerospace Museum’s 20th anniversary gala on October 19 he conducted Mannheim Steamroller in concert and led the audience in singing the national anthem.\n\nHe’s far more comfortable in the studio than on the stage, where there are no do-overs.\n\n“You’re only as good as your last performance. You can make mistakes out there in front of a bunch of people.”\n\nThe gregarious Davis is surprisingly shy.\n\n“The thing that bothers me the most is talking to the audience.”\n\nDoing press is another thing he’d rather not do, though he does a lot of it. He’s employed a high-priced interview coach to help him hone his message.\n\nThe family musical line hasn’t stopped with Davis. He said his two daughters are “really good singers.” He wrote an album for his youngest, Elyse. She’s yet to commit to music as a career. “I wish she’d pursue music,” he said. “Maybe she will later. It has to be on her own terms.”\n\nDavis himself is still exploring new ground.\n\nHe and Mark Valenti co-wrote a boxed-set audio book, The Wolf and the Warlander, inspired by the friendship between a horse and a wolf who’ve grown up together on Chip’s farm.\n\nThe two men wrote the book in the Tiki-style hut Davis keeps in Florida.\n\n“When we got done with the last chapter it was sad – we were having such a good time creating,” Davis said.\n\nHe could live and work anywhere but Omaha continues being his permanent home. Why leave where it all happened for him?\n\n“The hand of God put me down here in this town and said, ‘You will create,” he said, laughing. Seriously, he added, “I wouldn’t want to be in any other place. There’s a lot of freedom here. A lot of memories.”\n\nChip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller will perform Christmas concerts at the Orpheum Theater on December 22 and 23.\n\nVisit http://www.mannheimsteamroller.com.\n\nRead more of Leo Adam Biga’s work at leoadambiga.com."
