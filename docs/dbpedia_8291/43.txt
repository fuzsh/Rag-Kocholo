Hello All,

Thanks for reading. I've asked a few questions on the -questions mailing list before but I think I'll post this problem here for visibility now and in the future.

I found out about a project called caddy, which is written in the go language:

https://caddyserver.com

It's a simple to deploy (as in a single binary) webserver that can be started up with just nohup caddy &

I'd like to run this on my FreeBSD 10.2-release system on digital ocean but using inetd because inetd is pretty efficient, and I don't want to make a startup script for caddy. Additionally, I don't want caddy to run as root for port 80, etc.

The problem is either with caddy's code or my inetd configuration. I would appreciate some eyeballs reviewing my configurations so the developer of Caddy can then look into what the problem may be.

Here's my /etc/services:

Code:

caddy2 2022/tcp # caddy test

Here's my /etc/inetd.conf:

Code:

caddy2 stream tcp nowait.1000 sean /home/sean/bin/caddy2/caddy /home/sean/bin/caddy2/caddy --conf="/home/sean/bin/caddy2/Caddyfile"

The way I'm reading this is that inetd will start caddy at the path /home/sean/bin/caddy2/caddy with the Caddyfile[0] at /home/sean/bin/caddy2/Caddyfile.

When starting inetd in debug mode and going to my page, I see this in the stio:

Code:

inetd: someone wants caddy2 inetd: accept, ctrl 8 inetd: 52066 execl /home/sean/bin/caddy2/caddy inetd: handling signal flag C inetd: 52066 reaped, status 1

I'm not an inetd expert but this looks like it processed the request, as requested.

The problem with this is when you review the contents on the webpage, you will see:

Code:

2015/12/02 06:29:12 open "/home/sean/bin/caddy2/Caddyfile": no such file or directory

Did inetd really process the request successfully and this is simply an application problem, or is there a glaring inetd problem I'm overlooking?

I have not yet tried xinetd as I'd like to try and have inetd up and running first.

Thanks,

JB
