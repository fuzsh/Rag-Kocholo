        "text": "The kernelopts environment variable stores the defined kernel command line parameters for systems that use the GRUB2 bootloader. The variable was stored in the /boot/grub2/grubenv file for each kernel boot entry. The variable is deprecated and kernel command line parameters are stored in the Boot Loader Specification (BLS) snippet as a replacement.\n\nWith this removal of support for the dump utility, use other commands to back up file systems, for example, tar, dd, or bacula.\n\nThe restore component of the dump package remains supported and available as a separate restore package.\n\nThe /etc/cron.d/rear crontab is deprecated in the rear package. The crontab utility monitors for any changes in the disk layout and runs rear mkrescue if changes are detected. If you require the rear functionality, configure the ReaR utility to run periodically.\n\nSupport is deprecated for SQLite as a database backend of the Bacula backup system. You should migrate to one of the backends that Bacula supports, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\nAs a mount option, hidepid=n controls access to /proc/[pip]. The option is incompatible with the systemd infrastructure and might cause certain systemd services to generate SELinux AVC denial messages, which would inhibit completion of other operations.\n\nSupport for TLS cipher suites that use a SEED cipher is deprecated in the Network Security Services (NSS) library from Mozilla. If your setup relies on SEED ciphers, you should enable support for other cipher suites in preparation for the complete removal of SEED ciphers from NSS.\n\nSecure Socket Layer 2's Client Hello message used to be supported by earlier versions of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Being deprecated in the NSS library, this feature is now disabled by default.\n\nIf your application requires support for Client Hello, enable the feature by using the SSL_ENABLE_V2_COMPATIBLE_HELLO API.\n\nThe introduction of scopes for crypto-policies directives in custom policies has resulted in the deprecation of the following derived properties of crypto-policies:\n\ntls_cipher\n\nssh_cipher\n\nssh_group\n\nike_protocol\n\nsha1_in_dnssec\n\nUse of the protocol property now requires a scope. For more information, see the crypto-policieis(7) manual page.\n\nSetting the SELINUX=disabled option in /etc/selinux/config to disable SELinux at runtime has deprecated support. If you use only this option to disable SELinux, then SELinux remains enabled but with no loaded policy.\n\nTo completely disable SELinux, add the selinux=0 parameter to the kernel command line.\n\nPolicies for allowing and denying execution rules used to be specified in the /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.rules file. This file is being replaced by files inside the /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d directory.\n\nThe fagenrules script now merges all component rule files in this directory to the /etc/fapolicyd/compiled.rules file. Rules in /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.trust are still processed by the fapolicyd framework but only for ensuring backward compatibility.\n\nNetwork scripts are no longer available by default. New versions of ifup and ifdown scripts call the NetworkManager service through the nmcli tools. Therefore, to run these scripts in Oracle Linux 8, the NetworkManager service must be running.\n\nOther commands in /sbin/ifup-local, ifdown-pre-local, and ifdown-local scripts are ignored. If you manually install the legacy network-scripts package and use the scripts, a warning is displayed about their deprecated state.\n\nThe xt_32 module enables users to match arbitrary 32 bits in the packet header or payload for their iptables. Because this module is unsupported, migrate to the nftables packet filtering framework.\n\nFirst, change your firewall to use iptables with native matches to incrementally replace individual rules. Then, use the iptables-translate command and accompanying utilities to migrate to nftables. If the iptables rules have no native match in nftables, use the raw payload matching feature of nftables instead.\n\nFor more information, aee the raw payload expression section in the nft(8) manual page.\n\nThe firewire subsystem provides interfaces to use and maintain any resources on the IEEE 1394 bus. This subsystem is deprecated in the kernel package and likewise, associated user space components that are provided by the libavc1394, libdc1394, and libram1394 packages.\n\nThe VDO Manager is deprecated and is replaced by the LVM-VDO integration. To create VDO volumes, preferably use the lvcreate command instead.\n\nYou can use the /usr/sbin/lvm_import_vdo script in the lvm2 package to convert existing volumes that were created with the VDO Manager. In this manner, these volumes can be managed through the LVM-VDO integration.\n\nThe elevator kernel command line parameter sets the disk scheduler for all devices. If you require a different scheduler than what the kernel automatically selects, use udev rule or the TuneD service to configure your preferred scheduler.\n\nThe clufter tool is used for analyzing cluster configuration formats. The pcs commands that support the clufter tool are deprecated. Using these commands generate a warning about their deprecations. Sections that are related to these commands are removed from the pcs help display as well as the pcs(8) manual page.\n\nSpecifically, the following commands are deprecated:\n\npcs config import-cman\n\npcs config export\n\nIn place of the deprecated libdwarf library, use the elfutils and libdw libraries for applications that need to process ELF/DWARF files.\n\nAs an alternative to the libdwarf-tools dwarfdump program, you can use the binutils readelf program or the elfutils eu-readelf program. Both programs can be used by passing the --debug-dump flag.\n\nThese packages were distributed in earlier Oracle Linux releases to support 32-bit versions of the GNU Debugger (GDB). With the removal of support for 32-bit hardware, these packages are no longer supported or available. The 64-bit version of GDB in gdb.x86_64 packages can debug 32-bit applications.\n\nThe web console no longer performs translations for languages whose available translations are less than 50% of the console's translatable strings. For these languages, the user interface will be in English.\n\nSupport for creating snapshots of VMs is limited only to those that do not use UEFI firmware. However, the operation might cause the QEMU monitor to become blocked and affects hypervisor operations.\n\nAs an alternative, use external snapshots."
