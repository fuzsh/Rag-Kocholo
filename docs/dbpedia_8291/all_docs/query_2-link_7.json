        "text": "This part provides an overview of functionality that has been deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nDeprecated devices are fully supported, which means that they are tested and maintained, and their support status remains unchanged within Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. However, these devices will likely not be supported in the next major version release, and are not recommended for new deployments on the current or future major versions of RHEL.\n\nFor the most recent list of deprecated functionality within a particular major release, see the latest version of release documentation. For information about the length of support, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle.\n\nA package can be deprecated and not recommended for further use. Under certain circumstances, a package can be removed from the product. Product documentation then identifies more recent packages that offer functionality similar, identical, or more advanced to the one deprecated, and provides further recommendations.\n\nFor information regarding functionality that is present in RHEL 7 but has been removed in RHEL 8, see Considerations in adopting RHEL 8.\n\nFor information regarding functionality that is present in RHEL 8 but has been removed in RHEL 9, see Considerations in adopting RHEL 9.\n\n9.1. Installer and image creation\n\nSeveral Kickstart commands and options have been deprecated\n\nUsing the following commands and options in RHEL 8 Kickstart files will print a warning in the logs:\n\nauth or authconfig\n\ndevice\n\ndeviceprobe\n\ndmraid\n\ninstall\n\nlilo\n\nlilocheck\n\nmouse\n\nmultipath\n\nbootloader --upgrade\n\nignoredisk --interactive\n\npartition --active\n\nreboot --kexec\n\nWhere only specific options are listed, the base command and its other options are still available and not deprecated.\n\nFor more details and related changes in Kickstart, see the Kickstart changes section of the Considerations in adopting RHEL 8 document.\n\n(BZ#1642765)\n\nThe --interactive option of the ignoredisk Kickstart command has been deprecated\n\nUsing the --interactive option in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux will result in a fatal installation error. It is recommended that you modify your Kickstart file to remove the option.\n\n(BZ#1637872)\n\nThe Kickstart autostep command has been deprecated\n\nThe autostep command has been deprecated. The related section about this command has been removed from the RHEL 8 documentation.\n\n(BZ#1904251)\n\nThe lorax-composer back end for Image Builder is deprecated in RHEL 8\n\nThe lorax-composer back end for Image Builder is considered deprecated. It will only receive selected fixes for the rest of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 lifecycle and will be omitted from future major releases. Red Hat recommends that you uninstall lorax-composer and install the osbuild-composer back end instead.\n\nSee Composing a customized RHEL system image for more details.\n\n(BZ#1893767)\n\n9.2. Software management\n\nrpmbuild --sign is deprecated\n\nWith this update, the rpmbuild --sign command has become deprecated. Using this command in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux can result in an error. It is recommended that you use the rpmsign command instead.\n\n(BZ#1688849)\n\n9.4. Security\n\nNSS SEED ciphers are deprecated\n\nThe Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library will not support TLS cipher suites that use a SEED cipher in a future release. To ensure smooth transition of deployments that rely on SEED ciphers when NSS removes support, Red Hat recommends enabling support for other cipher suites.\n\nNote that SEED ciphers are already disabled by default in RHEL.\n\n(BZ#1817533)\n\nTLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated\n\nThe TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols are disabled in the DEFAULT system-wide cryptographic policy level. If your scenario, for example, a video conferencing application in the Firefox web browser, requires using the deprecated protocols, switch the system-wide cryptographic policy to the LEGACY level:\n\n# update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY\n\nFor more information, see the Strong crypto defaults in RHEL 8 and deprecation of weak crypto algorithms Knowledgebase article on the Red Hat Customer Portal and the update-crypto-policies(8) man page.\n\n(BZ#1660839)\n\nDSA is deprecated in RHEL 8\n\nThe Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is considered deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Authentication mechanisms that depend on DSA keys do not work in the default configuration. Note that OpenSSH clients do not accept DSA host keys even in the LEGACY system-wide cryptographic policy level.\n\n(BZ#1646541)\n\nSSL2 Client Hello has been deprecated in NSS\n\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2 and earlier allow to start a negotiation with a Client Hello message formatted in a way that is backward compatible with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol version 2. Support for this feature in the Network Security Services (NSS) library has been deprecated and it is disabled by default.\n\nApplications that require support for this feature need to use the new SSL_ENABLE_V2_COMPATIBLE_HELLO API to enable it. Support for this feature may be removed completely in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\n(BZ#1645153)\n\nTPM 1.2 is deprecated\n\nThe Trusted Platform Module (TPM) secure cryptoprocessor standard version was updated to version 2.0 in 2016. TPM 2.0 provides many improvements over TPM 1.2, and it is not backward compatible with the previous version. TPM 1.2 is deprecated in RHEL 8, and it might be removed in the next major release.\n\n(BZ#1657927)\n\ncrypto-policies derived properties are now deprecated\n\nWith the introduction of scopes for crypto-policies directives in custom policies, the following derived properties have been deprecated: tls_cipher, ssh_cipher, ssh_group, ike_protocol, and sha1_in_dnssec. Additionally, the use of the protocol property without specifying a scope is now deprecated as well. See the crypto-policies(7) man page for recommended replacements.\n\n(BZ#2011208)\n\nRuntime disabling SELinux using /etc/selinux/config is now deprecated\n\nRuntime disabling SELinux using the SELINUX=disabled option in the /etc/selinux/config file has been deprecated. In RHEL 9, when you disable SELinux only through /etc/selinux/config, the system starts with SELinux enabled but with no policy loaded.\n\nIf your scenario really requires to completely disable SELinux, Red Hat recommends disabling SELinux by adding the selinux=0 parameter to the kernel command line as described in the Changing SELinux modes at boot time section of the Using SELinux title.\n\n(BZ#1932222)\n\nThe ipa SELinux module removed from selinux-policy\n\nThe ipa SELinux module has been removed from the selinux-policy package because it is no longer maintained. The functionality is now included in the ipa-selinux subpackage.\n\nIf your scenario requires the use of types or interfaces from the ipa module in a local SELinux policy, install the ipa-selinux package.\n\n(BZ#1461914)\n\n9.5. Networking\n\nNetwork scripts are deprecated in RHEL 8\n\nNetwork scripts are deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and they are no longer provided by default. The basic installation provides a new version of the ifup and ifdown scripts which call the NetworkManager service through the nmcli tool. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, to run the ifup and the ifdown scripts, NetworkManager must be running.\n\nNote that custom commands in /sbin/ifup-local, ifdown-pre-local and ifdown-local scripts are not executed.\n\nIf any of these scripts are required, the installation of the deprecated network scripts in the system is still possible with the following command:\n\n~]# yum install network-scripts\n\nThe ifup and ifdown scripts link to the installed legacy network scripts.\n\nCalling the legacy network scripts shows a warning about their deprecation.\n\n(BZ#1647725)\n\nThe dropwatch tool is deprecated\n\nThe dropwatch tool has been deprecated. The tool will not be supported in future releases, thus it is not recommended for new deployments. As a replacement of this package, Red Hat recommends to use the perf command line tool.\n\nFor more information on using the perf command line tool, see the Getting started with Perf section on the Red Hat customer portal or the perf man page.\n\n(BZ#1929173)\n\nThe cgdcbxd package is deprecated\n\nControl group data center bridging exchange daemon (cgdcbxd) is a service to monitor data center bridging (DCB) netlink events and manage the net_prio control group subsystem. Starting with RHEL 8.5, the cgdcbxd package is deprecated and will be removed in the next major RHEL release.\n\n(BZ#2006665)\n\nThe xinetd service has been deprecated\n\nThe xinetd service has been deprecated and will be removed in RHEL 9. As a replacement, use systemd. For further details, see How to convert xinetd service to systemd.\n\n(BZ#2009113)\n\nThe term slaves is deprecated in the nmstate API\n\nRed Hat is committed to using conscious language. Therefore the slaves term is deprecated in the Nmstate API. Use the term port when you use nmstatectl.\n\n(JIRA:RHELDOCS-17641)\n\n9.6. Kernel\n\nKernel live patching now covers all RHEL minor releases\n\nSince RHEL 8.1, kernel live patches have been provided for selected minor release streams of RHEL covered under the Extended Update Support (EUS) policy to remediate Critical and Important Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). To accommodate the maximum number of concurrently covered kernels and use cases, the support window for each live patch will be decreased from 12 to 6 months for every minor, major and zStream version of the kernel. It means that on the day a kernel live patch is released, it will cover every minor release and scheduled errata kernel delivered in the past 6 months. For example, 8.4.x will have a one-year support window, but 8.4.x+1 will have 6 months.\n\nFor more information about this feature, see Applying patches with kernel live patching.\n\nFor details about available kernel live patches, see Kernel Live Patch life cycles.\n\n(BZ#1958250)\n\nInstalling RHEL for Real Time 8 using diskless boot is now deprecated\n\nDiskless booting allows multiple systems to share a root file system via the network. While convenient, diskless boot is prone to introducing network latency in realtime workloads. With a future minor update of RHEL for Real Time 8, the diskless booting feature will no longer be supported.\n\n(BZ#1748980)\n\nThe Linux firewire sub-system and its associated user-space components are deprecated in RHEL 8\n\nThe firewire sub-system provides interfaces to use and maintain any resources on the IEEE 1394 bus. In RHEL 9, firewire will no longer be supported in the kernel package. Note that firewire contains several user-space components provided by the libavc1394, libdc1394, libraw1394 packages. These packages are subject to the deprecation as well.\n\n(BZ#1871863)\n\nThe rdma_rxe Soft-RoCE driver is deprecated\n\nSoftware Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet (Soft-RoCE), also known as RXE, is a feature that emulates Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). In RHEL 8, the Soft-RoCE feature is available as an unsupported Technology Preview. However, due to stability issues, this feature has been deprecated and will be removed in RHEL 9.\n\n(BZ#1878207)\n\n9.7. File systems and storage\n\nVDO write modes other than async are deprecated\n\nVDO supports several write modes in RHEL 8:\n\nsync\n\nasync\n\nasync-unsafe\n\nauto\n\nStarting with RHEL 8.4, the following write modes are deprecated:\n\nsync\n\nDevices above the VDO layer cannot recognize if VDO is synchronous, and consequently, the devices cannot take advantage of the VDO sync mode.\n\nasync-unsafe\n\nVDO added this write mode as a workaround for the reduced performance of async mode, which complies to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID). Red Hat does not recommend async-unsafe for most use cases and is not aware of any users who rely on it.\n\nauto\n\nThis write mode only selects one of the other write modes. It is no longer necessary when VDO supports only a single write mode.\n\nThese write modes will be removed in a future major RHEL release.\n\nThe recommended VDO write mode is now async.\n\nFor more information on VDO write modes, see Selecting a VDO write mode.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-70700)\n\nNFSv3 over UDP has been disabled\n\nThe NFS server no longer opens or listens on a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket by default. This change affects only NFS version 3 because version 4 requires the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n\nNFS over UDP is no longer supported in RHEL 8.\n\n(BZ#1592011)\n\ncramfs has been deprecated\n\nDue to lack of users, the cramfs kernel module is deprecated. squashfs is recommended as an alternative solution.\n\n(BZ#1794513)\n\nVDO manager has been deprecated\n\nThe python-based VDO management software has been deprecated and will be removed from RHEL 9. In RHEL 9, it will be replaced by the LVM-VDO integration. Therefore, it is recommended to create VDO volumes using the lvcreate command.\n\nThe existing volumes created using the VDO management software can be converted using the /usr/sbin/lvm_import_vdo script, provided by the lvm2 package. For more information on the LVM-VDO implementation, see Introduction to VDO on LVM.\n\n(BZ#1949163)\n\nThe elevator kernel command line parameter is deprecated\n\nThe elevator kernel command line parameter was used in earlier RHEL releases to set the disk scheduler for all devices. In RHEL 8, the parameter is deprecated.\n\nThe upstream Linux kernel has removed support for the elevator parameter, but it is still available in RHEL 8 for compatibility reasons.\n\nNote that the kernel selects a default disk scheduler based on the type of device. This is typically the optimal setting. If you require a different scheduler, Red Hat recommends that you use udev rules or the Tuned service to configure it. Match the selected devices and switch the scheduler only for those devices.\n\nFor more information, see Setting the disk scheduler.\n\n(BZ#1665295)\n\nLVM mirror is deprecated\n\nThe LVM mirror segment type is now deprecated. Support for mirror will be removed in a future major release of RHEL.\n\nRed Hat recommends that you use LVM RAID 1 devices with a segment type of raid1 instead of mirror. The raid1 segment type is the default RAID configuration type and replaces mirror as the recommended solution.\n\nTo convert mirror devices to raid1, see Converting a mirrored LVM device to a RAID1 logical volume.\n\nLVM mirror has several known issues. For details, see known issues in file systems and storage.\n\n(BZ#1827628)\n\nperipety is deprecated\n\nThe peripety package is deprecated since RHEL 8.3.\n\nThe Peripety storage event notification daemon parses system storage logs into structured storage events. It helps you investigate storage issues.\n\n(BZ#1871953)\n\n9.8. High availability and clusters\n\npcs commands that support the clufter tool have been deprecated\n\nThe pcs commands that support the clufter tool for analyzing cluster configuration formats have been deprecated. These commands now print a warning that the command has been deprecated and sections related to these commands have been removed from the pcs help display and the pcs(8) man page.\n\nThe following commands have been deprecated:\n\npcs config import-cman for importing CMAN / RHEL6 HA cluster configuration\n\npcs config export for exporting cluster configuration to a list of pcs commands which recreate the same cluster\n\n(BZ#1851335)\n\n9.10. Identity Management\n\nopenssh-ldap has been deprecated\n\nThe openssh-ldap subpackage has been deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and will be removed in RHEL 9. As the openssh-ldap subpackage is not maintained upstream, Red Hat recommends using SSSD and the sss_ssh_authorizedkeys helper, which integrate better with other IdM solutions and are more secure.\n\nBy default, the SSSD ldap and ipa providers read the sshPublicKey LDAP attribute of the user object, if available. Note that you cannot use the default SSSD configuration for the ad provider or IdM trusted domains to retrieve SSH public keys from Active Directory (AD), since AD does not have a default LDAP attribute to store a public key.\n\nTo allow the sss_ssh_authorizedkeys helper to get the key from SSSD, enable the ssh responder by adding ssh to the services option in the sssd.conf file. See the sssd.conf(5) man page for details.\n\nTo allow sshd to use sss_ssh_authorizedkeys, add the AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/sss_ssh_authorizedkeys and AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody options to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file as described by the sss_ssh_authorizedkeys(1) man page.\n\n(BZ#1871025)\n\nDES and 3DES encryption types have been removed\n\nDue to security reasons, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm has been deprecated and disabled by default since RHEL 7. With the recent rebase of Kerberos packages, single-DES (DES) and triple-DES (3DES) encryption types have been removed from RHEL 8.\n\nIf you have configured services or users to only use DES or 3DES encryption, you might experience service interruptions such as:\n\nKerberos authentication errors\n\nunknown enctype encryption errors\n\nKerberos Distribution Centers (KDCs) with DES-encrypted Database Master Keys (K/M) fail to start\n\nPerform the following actions to prepare for the upgrade:\n\nCheck if your KDC uses DES or 3DES encryption with the krb5check open source Python scripts. See krb5check on GitHub.\n\nIf you are using DES or 3DES encryption with any Kerberos principals, re-key them with a supported encryption type, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). For instructions on re-keying, see Retiring DES from MIT Kerberos Documentation.\n\nTest independence from DES and 3DES by temporarily setting the following Kerberos options before upgrading:\n\nIn /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf on the KDC, set supported_enctypes and do not include des or des3.\n\nFor every host, in /etc/krb5.conf and any files in /etc/krb5.conf.d, set allow_weak_crypto to false. It is false by default.\n\nFor every host, in /etc/krb5.conf and any files in /etc/krb5.conf.d, set permitted_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes, and default_tkt_enctypes, and do not include des or des3.\n\nIf you do not experience any service interruptions with the test Kerberos settings from the previous step, remove them and upgrade. You do not need those settings after upgrading to the latest Kerberos packages.\n\n(BZ#1877991)\n\nStandalone use of the ctdb service has been deprecated\n\nSince RHEL 8.4, customers are advised to use the ctdb clustered Samba service only when both of the following conditions apply:\n\nThe ctdb service is managed as a pacemaker resource with the resource-agent ctdb.\n\nThe ctdb service uses storage volumes that contain either a GlusterFS file system provided by the Red Hat Gluster Storage product or a GFS2 file system.\n\nThe stand-alone use case of the ctdb service has been deprecated and will not be included in a next major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. For further information on support policies for Samba, see the Knowledgebase article Support Policies for RHEL Resilient Storage - ctdb General Policies.\n\n(BZ#1916296)\n\nIndirect AD integration with IdM via WinSync has been deprecated\n\nWinSync is no longer actively developed in RHEL 8 due to several functional limitations:\n\nWinSync supports only one Active Directory (AD) domain.\n\nPassword synchronization requires installing additional software on AD Domain Controllers.\n\nFor a more robust solution with better resource and security separation, Red Hat recommends using a cross-forest trust for indirect integration with Active Directory. See the Indirect integration documentation.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-100400)\n\nRunning Samba as a PDC or BDC is deprecated\n\nThe classic domain controller mode that enabled administrators to run Samba as an NT4-like primary domain controller (PDC) and backup domain controller (BDC) is deprecated. The code and settings to configure these modes will be removed in a future Samba release.\n\nAs long as the Samba version in RHEL 8 provides the PDC and BDC modes, Red Hat supports these modes only in existing installations with Windows versions which support NT4 domains. Red Hat recommends not setting up a new Samba NT4 domain, because Microsoft operating systems later than Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 do not support NT4 domains.\n\nIf you use the PDC to authenticate only Linux users, Red Hat suggests migrating to Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) that is included in RHEL subscriptions. However, you cannot join Windows systems to an IdM domain. Note that Red Hat continues supporting the PDC functionality IdM uses in the background.\n\nRed Hat does not support running Samba as an AD domain controller (DC).\n\n(BZ#1926114)\n\nThe SSSD version of libwbclient has been removed\n\nThe SSSD implementation of the libwbclient package was deprecated in RHEL 8.4. As it cannot be used with recent versions of Samba, the SSSD implementation of libwbclient has now been removed.\n\n(BZ#1947671)\n\nThe SMB1 protocol is deprecated in Samba\n\nStarting with Samba 4.11, the insecure Server Message Block version 1 (SMB1) protocol is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\nTo improve the security, by default, SMB1 is disabled in the Samba server and client utilities.\n\nJira:RHELDOCS-16612\n\n9.11. Desktop\n\nThe libgnome-keyring library has been deprecated\n\nThe libgnome-keyring library has been deprecated in favor of the libsecret library, as libgnome-keyring is not maintained upstream, and does not follow the necessary cryptographic policies for RHEL. The new libsecret library is the replacement that follows the necessary security standards.\n\n(BZ#1607766)\n\n9.12. Graphics infrastructures\n\nAGP graphics cards are no longer supported\n\nGraphics cards using the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bus are not supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Use the graphics cards with PCI-Express bus as the recommended replacement.\n\n(BZ#1569610)\n\nMotif is deprecated\n\nThe Motif widget toolkit is now deprecated. Development in the upstream Motif community is inactive.\n\nThe following Motif packages are deprecated, including their development and debugging variants:\n\nmotif\n\nmotif-static\n\nopenmotif\n\nopenmotif21\n\nopenmotif22\n\nRed Hat recommends using the GTK toolkit as a replacement. GTK is more maintainable and provides new features compared to Motif.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-98983)\n\n9.13. The web console\n\nThe web console no longer supports incomplete translations\n\nThe RHEL web console no longer provides translations for languages that have translations available for less than 50 % of the Console’s translatable strings. If the browser requests translation to such a language, the user interface will be in English instead.\n\n(BZ#1666722)\n\n9.14. Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Roles\n\nThe geoipupdate package has been deprecated\n\nThe geoipupdate package requires a third-party subscription and it also downloads proprietary content. Therefore, the geoipupdate package has been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major RHEL version.\n\n(BZ#1874892)\n\n9.15. Virtualization\n\nSPICE has been deprecated\n\nThe SPICE remote display protocol has become deprecated. As a result, SPICE will remain supported in RHEL 8, but Red Hat recommends using alternate solutions for remote display streaming:\n\nFor remote console access, use the VNC protocol.\n\nFor advanced remote display functions, use third party tools such as RDP, HP RGS, or Mechdyne TGX.\n\nNote that the QXL graphics device, which is used by SPICE, has become deprecated as well.\n\n(BZ#1849563)\n\nvirsh iface-* commands have become deprecated\n\nThe virsh iface-* commands, such as virsh iface-start and virsh iface-destroy, are now deprecated, and will be removed in a future major version of RHEL. In addition, these commands frequently fail due to configuration dependencies.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended not to use virsh iface-* commands for configuring and managing host network connections. Instead, use the NetworkManager program and its related management applications, such as nmcli.\n\n(BZ#1664592)\n\nvirt-manager has been deprecated\n\nThe Virtual Machine Manager application, also known as virt-manager, has been deprecated. The RHEL web console, also known as Cockpit, is intended to become its replacement in a subsequent release. It is, therefore, recommended that you use the web console for managing virtualization in a GUI. Note, however, that some features available in virt-manager may not be yet available in the RHEL web console.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-10304)\n\nVirtual machine snapshots are not properly supported in RHEL 8\n\nThe current mechanism of creating virtual machine (VM) snapshots has been deprecated, as it is not working reliably. As a consequence, it is recommended not to use VM snapshots in RHEL 8.\n\n(BZ#1686057)\n\nThe Cirrus VGA virtual GPU type has been deprecated\n\nWith a future major update of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Cirrus VGA GPU device will no longer be supported in KVM virtual machines. Therefore, Red Hat recommends using the stdvga or virtio-vga devices instead of Cirrus VGA.\n\n(BZ#1651994)\n\nKVM on IBM POWER has been deprecated\n\nUsing KVM virtualization on IBM POWER hardware has become deprecated. As a result, KVM on IBM POWER is still supported in RHEL 8, but will become unsupported in a future major release of RHEL.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-71200)\n\nSecureBoot image verification using SHA1-based signatures is deprecated\n\nPerforming SecureBoot image verification using SHA1-based signatures on UEFI (PE/COFF) executables has become deprecated. Instead, Red Hat recommends using signatures based on the SHA2 algorithm, or later.\n\n(BZ#1935497)\n\n9.16. Supportability\n\nThe -s split option is no longer supported with the -f option\n\nWhen providing files to Red Hat Support by uploading them to Red Hat Secure FTP, you can run the redhat-support-tool addattachment -f command. Due to infrastructure changes, however, you can no longer use the -s option with this command for splitting big files into parts and uploading them to Red Hat Secure FTP.\n\n(BZ#2013335)\n\nThe redhat-support-tool diagnose <file_or_directory> command has been deprecated\n\nThe Red Hat Support Tool no longer supports the redhat-support-tool diagnose <file_or_directory> command previously used for advanced diagnostic services for files or directories. The redhat-support-tool diagnose command continues to support the plain text analysis.\n\n(BZ#2019786)\n\n9.17. Containers\n\nThe Podman varlink-based API v1.0 has been removed\n\nThe Podman varlink-based API v1.0 was deprecated in a previous release of RHEL 8. Podman v2.0 introduced a new Podman v2.0 RESTful API. With the release of Podman v3.0, the varlink-based API v1.0 has been completely removed.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-45858)\n\ncontainer-tools:1.0 has been deprecated\n\nThe container-tools:1.0 module has been deprecated and will no longer receive security updates. It is recommended to use a newer supported stable module stream, such as container-tools:2.0 or container-tools:3.0.\n\n(JIRA:RHELPLAN-59825)\n\n9.18.

Deprecated and unmaintained devices\n\nThis section lists devices (drivers, adapters) that\n\ncontinue to be supported until the end of life of RHEL 8 but will likely not be supported in future major releases of this product and are not recommended for new deployments. Support for devices other than those listed remains unchanged. These are deprecated devices.\n\nare available but are no longer being tested or updated on a routine basis in RHEL 8. Red Hat may fix serious bugs, including security bugs, at its discretion. These devices should no longer be used in production, and it is likely they will be disabled in the next major release. These are unmaintained devices.\n\nPCI device IDs are in the format of vendor:device:subvendor:subdevice.
