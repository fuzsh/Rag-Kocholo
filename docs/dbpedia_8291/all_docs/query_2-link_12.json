        "text": "What is DevSecOps?\n\nDevSecOps is all about introducing security in the earlier phase of the application or software development cycle and continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment pipelines (CI/CD), which helps to minimize vulnerabilities and meet IT and business objectives related to security and compliance. It mainly focuses on securing applications and automating security in the DevOps process. Good DevOps Security Tools and strategies are required to determine risk tolerance and conduct a risk/benefit analysis.\n\nDevSecOps is a practice of implementing security at every step in the DevOps Lifecycle with DevSecOps Tools. According to the traditional method where penetration tests and vulnerability assessment were done after the build, DevSecOps is based on the concept of integrating security assessments and vulnerability tests at each point of the CI/CD pipeline. DevSecOps tools help in implementing security within the DevOps workflow.\n\nDevSecOps is the answer to integrating various enterprise challenges into a coherent and effective approach to software delivery. A central tenet of DevSecOps Tools is that security is an integral and essential element of DevOps – the method by which enterprises innovate at speed and scale.\n\nThe DevSecOps Manifesto\n\nLeaning in over Always Saying, “No.”\n\nData & Security Science over Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.\n\nOpen Contribution & Collaboration over Security-Only Requirements.\n\nRelying on empowered development teams more than security specialists.\n\nConsumable Security Services with APIs over Mandated Security Controls & Paperwork.\n\nBusiness Driven Security Scores over Rubber Stamp Security.\n\n24x7 Proactive Security Monitoring over Reacting after being Informed of an Incident.\n\nShared Threat Intelligence over Keeping Info to ourselves.\n\nCompliance Operations over Clipboards & Checklists.\n\nWhat's driving the DevSecOps Movement\n\nAs software continues to grow rapidly in IT, DevSecOps and DevSecOps Tools become the foundation of competitiveness in the modern marketplace. Every business must become an agile and innovative software delivery machine to survive. This leads all of us to the enterprise IT paradox: go faster and innovate. But always stay secure. Modern Applications are mostly “assembled.” Developers often use and download vulnerable open source components and application frameworks.\n\nIn the DevOps world, organizations are building applications faster than they have forgotten the Security aspect. Cloud platforms and continuous delivery life cycles often circumvent traditional security processes and checks.\n\nSecurity Collaboration – it’s everyone's responsibility. Organizations must try to bring individuals of all abilities to a high level of proficiency in a short period of time.\n\nDevSecOps, it’s going to enhance the purpose of DevOps. Taken From Article, A Quick Guide to DevSecOps Pipeline\n\nImportant DevSecOps Tools For DevOps Pipeline\n\nAutomated Testing Tools\n\nApplication Security Testing Tools\n\nLog Management Tools\n\nMonitoring Tools\n\nAlerting Tools\n\nDashboard Tools\n\nThreat Modeling Tools\n\nAdditional DevOps Security Tools\n\nAutomated Testing Tools\n\n[Code]AI\n\nParasoft Tool Suite\n\n[Code]AI\n\n[Code]AI is a smart, automated, secure coding application that fixes security vulnerabilities in source code.

Pre-commit\n\nLightweight, iterative threat modeling, and risk assessments.\n\nStatic analysis (SAST) checking in the engineer’s IDE.\n\nPeer code reviews (for defensive coding and security vulnerabilities).\n\n2. Commit Stage\n\nCompile and build checks, ensuring that these steps are clean and no errors or warnings.\n\nTry to identify risk in third-party components.\n\nGenerating Alerts on the high-risk code.\n\nAutomation of unit testing of security functions, with full coverage of code analysis.\n\n3. Acceptance stage\n\nSecure, automated configuration management and provisioning using tools such as Ansible and Chef.\n\nTargeted dynamic scanning (DAST).\n\nAutomated functional and integration testing of security features.\n\nDeep static analysis scanning.\n\nManual Penetration Testing using web exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit.\n\n4. Production deployment and post-deployment\n\nAutomated deployment and release orchestration.\n\nAutomated runtime asserts and compliance checks.\n\nProduction monitoring/feedback.\n\nRuntime defense.\n\nBug bounties.\n\nLearning from failure\n\nDepending on the risk and uncertainty profile of your organization and infrastructure, you shall need to implement these practices and controls.\n\nArchitecting Container Infrastructure for Continuous Security and Compliance\n\nAs organizations benefit from agility, scalability, and even migrating to containers and microservices, Security and compliance parameters are often overlooked—some of the most critical security listings for container infrastructure.\n\nKernel Security\n\nDenial Of Service\n\nImage Security\n\nCredentials and Secrets\n\nRuntime Security\n\n1. Kernel Security\n\nWhen it comes to containers and microservices, all rely on a single kernel of the host machine. Most of the intrusions can be stopped if proper kernel security is implemented. This is really efficient for multiple reasons you probably know already, but from the point of view of security, it can be seen as a risk that needs to be mitigated\n\n2. Docker Host and Kernel Security\n\nIf an attacker compromises your host system, then container isolation and security safeguards won’t make much difference. Besides, containers run on top of the host kernel by design.\n\nMake sure your host and Docker engine configuration are secure. Watry using the Docker bench audit tool to check configuration best practices.\n\nKeep your base system reasonably updated, subscribe to security news feeds for the os and any software installed for 3rd party repositories, like the container orchestration platforms.\n\nUsing minimal, container-centric host systems like CoreOS, Redhat Atomic, RancherOS, etc.\n\nYou can use Mandatory Access Control to prevent undesired operations both on the host and on the containers at the kernel level using tools like Seccomp or Selinux.\n\nEnsure you have the removed lethal kernel modules; packages such as xinetd and telnet can be lethal, and privileges and access should be ensured accordingly.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities can exist in OSS (Open source software) libraries that we import as much as we write. Tons of developers do programming every day, and manual code reviews don't scale. Here is the real power of DevSecOps lies. Click to explore about, Relationship of DevSecOps with CI/CD Pipeline\n\n3. Distributed Denial Of Service\n\nDistributed denial of service DDOS attacks are some of the most pervasive and difficult attacks to prevent. These kinds of attacks use many distributed endpoints and systems to flood a web domain, application, or service with an excess number of service requests or application calls.\n\nRunning penetration tests on software early in development is one way to thwart holes that enable L7 DDoS attacks.\n\nThe failed test requires a response. One such response is to build the software when the software fails the test automatically. If development can't move forward without fixing the security holes, the security holes will be fixed.\n\nDevelopers should not have to do a lot of digging to uncover these methods. Use resources such as the Open Web Application Security Project ( OWASP ) clearly set these approaches apart and label each of them independently.\n\n4. Image Security\n\nMany images are available on different repositories on the internet doing all kinds of useful stuff. Still, if you pull images without trust, authenticity, or vulnerability scanning, you are running arbitrary software on your machine.\n\nCertain parameters must be followed before using that docker image:-\n\nWhere did the image come from?\n\nDo you trust the image creator? Which kind of security policy are they using?\n\nHow do you know nobody has been tampering with the image?\n\nBest Practices to follow\n\nDo not run unverified software and/or from sources you don’t explicitly trust.\n\nDeploy a container-centric trust server using some of the Docker registry servers in our Docker Security Tools list.\n\nEnforce mandatory signature verification for any image that is going to be pulled or running on your system.\n\n5. Credentials and Secrets\n\nYour software needs sensitive information to run, such as user password hashes, server-side certificates, and encryption keys. The microservices deployed on containers are plenty and may constantly be created and destroyed.\n\nYou need an automatic and secure process to share this sensitive info.\n\nBest Practices to follow\n\nDo not use environment variables for secrets; this is a widespread yet very insecure practice.\n\nDo not embed any secrets in the container image. Like “The private key and the certificate were mistakenly left inside the container image.”\n\nDeploy a Docker credentials management software if your deployments get complex enough, Do not attempt to create your own ‘secrets storage’ unless you know really well what you are doing.\n\n6. Docker runtime security monitoring\n\nAs we build Docker container images, we need to know exactly what goes into each container layer. We also must ensure that containers installed by third-party vendors do not download and run anything at runtime.\n\nA Holistic Approach\n\nTowards Automation and Continuous Security using DevSecOps Tools\n\nDevSecOps is all about implementing security at every step in the DevOps Lifecycle. it is an approach to secure an application and infrastructure using DevSecOps Tools based on DevOps, making sure the application is less vulnerable and ready for user use. All things automated, and security checks started from the beginning of the application’s pipelines.\n\nWith DevSecOps Tools, it is easier to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and deliver more secure products. It allows the organization to take a proactive approach toward security. DevSecOps Tools enables the development, safety, and operations teams to work closely and deliver better results within the same frame but with relatively fewer efforts. It also allows the organization to monitor the products for new security threats as DevSecOps tools can be easily merged into the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nExplore Impact of Insider Threats in Cyber Security\n\nRead about Azure Security Services at Glance, along with Security Checklist\n\nDiscover An Integrated Approach to Cloud Native Security and Observability\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDevOps\n\nTesting Microservices | Strategies and Processes for Enterprises\n\nDevOps\n\nValueOps: Transforming with Complete Value Stream Management\n\nDevOps\n\nPersistent Storage Strategies and Consulting for Kubernetes"
