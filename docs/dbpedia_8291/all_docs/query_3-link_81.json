The OP asked about the installation of the checkmk server which has a requirement in its RPM package for xinetd.\n\nIt is needed for the livestatus daemon. The commands omd config set LIVESTATUS_TCP… basically manipulate the (per-site) xinetd configuration.\n\nBut you are right, the agent can be operated without xinetd. Its RPM has no special Requires statements.\n\nCheers,\n\nDirk\n\nIndeed I am talking about the server and not the agent.\n\n@r.sander: I do have the “web and scripting” module and the “development tools” module configured as suggested in the documentation but the xinetd is not available in any of them.\n\n@Dirk: The repository you suggested only provides xinetd for SLES15 but not for SLES15 SP1.\n\nI am still looking for a solution here…\n\nActually Dirk’s suggestion worked !\n\nI went ahead and downloaded the SLES15 version of xinetd from the link he suggested and I was able to install that on my SLES15 SP1 (I was expecting to get a warning about a distro mismatch…)\n\nAfterwards the cmk server installation was possible without any further issues.\n\nMaybe someone can update the documentation related to SLES15 SP1 installation procedure.\n\nMany thanks !\n\n@fayepal, while you are at it you may also want to discuss Nagvis crash due to missing dependency in rhel8 installer\n\nThe problem is that the checkmk-enterprise RPM package does not explicitely mention the dependency\n\nRequires: php-json\n\nYet, this package is needed if Nagvis is used, e.g. to display maps."
