        "text": "CustomBuild doesn't install xinetd,...\n\nYou are right Martino, sorry for the mistake, but I'am sure the base install don't install 'xinetd'. And after read all the 'build' script, also sure that 'CustomBuild' has not installed it. But if not 'CustomBuild' need to be DA install due dependencies because 'yum.log' say 'xinetd' was installed 3 minutes after launch the DA 'setup.sh'. Maybe need to send a msg. to support to be sure. I don't know... But I have disabled xinetd without problem.\n\n...but I've seen many trojan and rootkits hide themselfs as xinetd because it's installed by default in many distributions.\n\nI don't want to scare you, but you should check the security of your system.\n\nI am glad not to be the only security paranoid... But same problem on the test bed server accepting only SSH access from my static ip address. But out of doubt I verified the MD5 sum of 'xinetd' on production server and is correct.\n\nHere's my understanding on xinetd (still inetd on certain distributions):\n\nFirst of all, here's what xinetd is all about:\n\nIt's a superdaemon which listens on certain ports and starts the daemon that's supposed to run on that port (but not as a persistent daemon, only as one instance to handle one request) when a request comes in for a service on that port.\n\nYears ago this was important on a lot of systems, because memory constraints and slow processes made it unwise to run lots of daemons waiting for requests.\n\nToday some VPS configurations may still work better with xinetd, because of said memory constraints.\n\nSince I'm not running any VPS licenses right now I don't know if DirectAdmin automatically sets up xinetd for VPS licenses, but I don't think so.\n\nI can't see anything DirectAdmin does which would require xinetd to run. Certainly Dovecot is controlled by DirectAdmin through the Services control panel; therefore it does NOT require xinetd.\n\nHopefully John, Martynas, or both, will respond to this thread.\n\nJeff"
