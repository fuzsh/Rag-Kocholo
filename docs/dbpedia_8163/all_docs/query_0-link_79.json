        "text": "Public excitement be dammed, Vienna’s rabidly anti-Semitic press hardly missed an opportunity to trumpet their angry disapproval, or rare grudging consent of Mahler’s way with the standard operatic repertoire. Despite such celebrity treatment, his composing identity was still little known in Vienna at the time of this fateful encounter in December 1904. Schoenberg wrote to Mahler immediately:\n\nI saw your soul naked, stripped bare. It lay before me like a wild, mysterious landscape with terrifying reefs and chasms; and at the next turning there were delightful, sunlit meadows, idyllic resting places…I saw the forces of good and evil locked in mortal combat, saw a man agonizingly striving for inner harmony, sensed a human being, a drama, the truth, the unrelenting truth.\n\nZeitgeist\n\nBy then the younger composer had set aside his own massive enterprise with five soloists, narrator, double men’s chorus, and immense orchestra—the Wagnerian oratorio Gurrelieder intended to be Schoenberg’s first symphonic work! He began it in 1901 but wouldn’t complete Gurrelieder until 1911, after Mahler’s death. Struggling to feed his young family they relocated from Vienna to Berlin and back again while he taught, arranged, and orchestrated for hire. Nonetheless, in 1903 Schoenberg managed to compose the ambitious Pelleas und Melisande, Op 5—conceived without awareness of Debussy’s 1902 opera in Paris. This 40-minute single movement tone poem would be premiered in January 1905 by a large upstart pickup orchestra founded under Mahler’s aegis. Pelleas und Melisande, however, was conducted by the inexperienced composer with unfortunate if predictable results. The premiere of every Schoenberg work beginning with Op. 1, a lush Brahmsian baritone song, provoked scandal.\n\nTwo years before this rehearsal meeting Mahler had read the score of Schoenberg’s Transfigured Night, a 30-minute single movement string sextet composed in 1899. Perplexed by it, Mahler nonetheless encouraged his opera orchestra concertmaster and brother-in-law Arnold Rosé to have the Rosé String Quartet enlist an additional violin and cello to give the 1902 premiere at Vienna’s Bösendorfer Hall. Again, a disastrous public reception.\n\nSchoenberg found in Mahler’s Third Symphony a kindred spirit who embraced the complexity of his Jewish Bohemian cultural heritage while navigating a reconciliation of the Brahms/Wagner “schism”. Mahler’s music modeled for him an openly volatile and contradictory psychology. Bruno Walter, Mahler’s friend and devoted conductor ob-served, that the great luminous dome of an adagio ending the Third symphony “with its broad, solemn melodic line, is, as a whole—and despite passages of burning pain—eloquent of comfort and grace. It is a single sound of heartfelt and exalted feelings, in which the whole giant structure finds its culmination.”\n\nEmotionally the symphony embodied the expressionism of the times, its tangled Jugendstil decor, symbolist poetry, Freudian analysis, focus on the masteries of nature, and fin de siècle yearnings. The larger-than-life Austrian painter Gustav Klimt’s body of work also worshiped nature by bringing forward its unseen geometry and layers of implied patterns. Klimt’s hieratic portraits were drenched with the sensuality of late summer colors and cultural references. Golden Chinese brocades comingled with an ambiguous iconography redolent of ancient Babylon.\n\nAirborne metallic triangles winking like folded love notes—kites sailing above spiraling tendrils and over opulent cascades of flowering nasturtiums. Klimt’s withering sunflowers clenched the ground like small trees with their leathery leaves and crowning ornament, a yellow-fringed bird feeder ripening in the summer heat—mocking the pagan trees of winter solstice. In a city whose lifeblood was music, Mahler’s Third would soon raise this zeitgeist to explosive heights.\n\nEach of the symphonies premiered with the composer conducting in less cosmopolitan cities than Vienna where audiences were more sympathetic and the cultural politics less cutthroat: Budapest, Berlin, Krefeld, Munich, Cologne, Essen, and Prague. Only Mahler’s Ninth symphony would premiere in Vienna posthumously in 1912.\n\nFriction and Friendship\n\nNot without some friction, these two thin-skinned composers became close friends. Mahler’s new wife Alma invited Schoenberg and his brother-in-law Alexander von Zemlinsky to visit their summer country retreat in Maiernigg. The couple had two toddlers in tow. Maria was born soon after their hasty 1902 wedding and Anna followed in 1904. That summer was devoted to composing the Seventh Symphony, which would premiere in Prague four years later. Mahler’s Sixth symphony still awaited its 1906 Essen premiere.\n\nNOTE: Before this narrative can continue a brief sidebar is needed to sort out the intimate histories and romantic relationships of our dramatis personae.\n\nMahler had been romancing Anna Von Mildenburg, a stunningly beautiful Wagnerian soprano, the star of the Vienna opera, for some four years when the composer’s Fourth symphony received its Munich premiere in 1901 with another soprano. Some believe that the Jewish singer bore Mahler a son out of wedlock named Roland before she married in 1909. Mahler eventually broke off the affair to capture the pearl-of-great-price Anna Schindler—the young, dazzling, and socially well-connected daughter of a highly successful landscape painter. Her sensuous demeanor, intelligent conversation, musicality, and mysterious beauty were perfectly suited to the setting that Viennese high society provided.\n\nAlma’s inquisitive independence and fire, as well as her voluptuous figure, had already captured the attention of “the prince of painting” when, as an unaccompanied teenager, Alma visited Klimt’s studio. Instead, she embarked on an affair with the gnomish Zemlinsky, her music composition teacher, before Mahler would come to dominate her attention. Like Alma, Zemlinsky’s already pregnant sister Mathilde married Schoenberg in 1901. It seems that the poem by Richard Dehmel which inspired Schoenberg’s Transfigured Night about an unborn out-of-wed-lock child “transfigured” by the acceptance of a non-paternal lover resonated for both men as the 20th century began unfolding.\n\nWunderhorn\n\nThe Third Symphony was to have culminated Mahler’s so-called “Wunderhorn” symphonies each repurposing songs from his Des Knaben Wunderhorn (The Youth’s Magic Horn), a song cycle begun before the First Symphony. But this enormous six-movement structure, a Bacchic summer daydream of nature and cosmic consequence, left no place for his cheerful Wunderhorn song The Heavenly Life: What the Child Tells Me.\n\nThe miracle of the Fourth symphony is how this 60-minute four-movement symphony can end in pure sweetness aware of the slaughter of innocent lambs and the implacable fate of doomed oxen embracing Grimm’s dark truths within a fairy tale’s happy ending. Instead of baking the leftover piecrust with cinnamon and sugar, Mahler extracts the dough’s molecular structure and builds an elaborately—sometimes manically transforming—confection, a magical gingerbread house replete with characters, dramatic lighting, fake snow, thunder sheets, and lightning bolts that is ultimately swept away for the inevitable, perfect, but wholly unexpected dessert.\n\nAcceleration\n\nVienna’s electrifying rate of change from 1900 to 1909 is challenging to grasp even from the perspective of our own confounding change-driven world. At the turn of the century Mahler hit his stride with the Fourth Symphony while Schoenberg tore away his self-taught cocoon and emerged with the confident Transfigured Night. By 1906 Mahler had advanced with a wayward and turbulent symphony inauthentically subtitled “Song of the Night.” The tonal scheme is more complicated than its predecessors with increasingly dissonant language. Despite his undiminished ability to write heart-breaking melodies, a sense of foreboding prevails with two spectral night music movements that surround a demonic scherzo marked schattenhaft (shadowy) within a 5-movement structure. The jubilant dawn of the rondo-finale lurches forward with a kind of strained triumphalism. Mahler’s forced resignation from the Vienna Opera, the death of 5-year-old Maria from scarlet fever, and a troubling heart diagnosis in the intervening year that may have colored the symphony’s 1908 Prague premiere with sense of premonition. Mahler was straining at the limits of his symphonic tether while suffering three major life crises.\n\nMeanwhile Schoenberg was taking an opposite tactic by boiling down the standard four-movement symphony structure into a continuous flow lasting some twenty minutes. While quite unprecedented, the model for his First Chamber Symphony was the 30-minute one-movement Liszt B-minor Sonata for solo piano. Also, Mahler’s pro-fusion of themes based upon the interval of a fourth in his Seventh symphony has parallels in Schoenberg’s unique contraction of the form. Perhaps this shared characteristic and the time spent with Mahler while finishing the sprawling work explains why Schoenberg became an enthusiastic champion of this least understood Mahler symphony.\n\nThe Chamber Symphony Op. 9 (to be heard in Jacaranda’s final concert) marks Schoenberg’s maturity, his first unquestioned masterpiece—and the birth of his son Georg. Gone is the bloated orchestra of Pelleas und Melisande replaced instead by a string quartet and eleven more players. Mahler regarded the score with awe, recognizing that his friend had fearlessly leapt into a future that would leave him behind. The work is teeming with ingenious variations. Its tonal centers shifting uneasily from each “movement” to land on an emphatic D major.\n\nThis premiere was no less scandalous. At Vienna’s Musikverein Mahler was infuriated by the blatant and callous disrespect. “Mahler got up and enforced silence,” recalled Alma, “as soon as the performance was over, he stood at the front of the dress circle and applauded until the last of the demonstrators had gone.” Schoenberg was undaunted. Soon a trio of new works, Opus 10, Opus 11, and Opus 15, would travel where no composer dared to go before.\n\nAnother Planet\n\nThe String Quartet No 2. Op. 10 incorporated a soprano for the first time ever and famously declares she feels “the air of another planet.” The texts for the last two movements are from the poet Stefan George, whose world view and symbolist leanings captured Schoenberg’s sympathy and imagination. Were these startling innovations not enough to garner the string quartet’s fame, its final movement “Entrückung” (Rapture) abandons key signature altogether. Again, despite the peerless playing of the Rosé Quartet and singing by Marie Gutheil-Schoder, a highly accomplished opera star in Bösendorfer Hall, the 1908 premiere was deemed a fiasco and Schoenberg pilloried in the press as a public nuisance. Today, this quartet is the composer’s most often performed, analyzed, and applauded.\n\nIts neighbor, as opus numbers go, is Schoenberg’s first important solo piano work: Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11 (to be heard in Jacaranda’s November concert) was completed after The Book of the Hanging Gardens Op. 15. Today, among pianists and composers of piano music each of these darkly opalescent gems contain worlds in microcosm deserving of focused attention. Their proximity to early piano works of Schoenberg’s important students Anton Webern (1883-1945) and Alban Berg (1885-1935) and to the great piano virtuoso/composer Ferruccio Busoni, with whom Schoenberg corresponded, is now being examined with more interest. Berg and Webern joined the master’s private classes in 1905.\n\nLike the quartet, the first two piano pieces flirt with appreciable tonal centers, but the third abandons tonality out-right. As a solo work Op. 11 is ideal for teaching about this important moment in history. Regarding Schoenberg’s style of instruction at this time, one student of several future musicologists wrote, “All the artistic rules that seem dry in old textbooks and from the lips of bad teachers appear in his lessons to have been born at that moment from an immediate perception…every stage of his teaching becomes an experience for his pupil…”\n\nHanging Gardens\n\nWe open Planet Schoenberg with The Book of the Hanging Gardens because it is the least understood and most rarely performed of this trio of pivotal works. The song cycle on paper and in a few recordings holds a legendary status in the imagination of many music lovers dating back to the intoxicating years when Columbia Master-works issued eight volumes of the complete works of Schonberg on vinyl LPs with additional sets of the complete quartets by Juilliard, and complete songs with piano accompaniment by Glen Gould.\n\nStefan George travelled to Paris where he met the symbolists Stefan Mallarme and Paul Verlaine. He was the first German intellectual to embrace the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and produced a groundbreaking German translation. To successfully embody George’s exotic poetry and the quicksilver mood of Schoenberg’s music, a charismatic mezzo-soprano is needed with consummate attention to textual nuance and a supple technique capable of navigating a wide-leaping vocal range, beautiful German, and feeling for Late Romantic style.\n\nSuch singers may not be rare, but few have invested in this rewarding cycle. Furthermore, the cycle’s piano accompaniment is quite technically demanding. While producing splintered haloes of notes the pianist must be entirely at service to the singer’s projection of each fleeting storyline. Fifteen poems make up the cycle with some settings lasting less than one minute, some barely more than two, and the longish last song surveys a myriad of details before leaving the “ashen walls of Eden…overcast and sultry.”\n\nSchoenberg’s belief that these songs are the essential next step in the lieder tradition of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, Strauss and Mahler was unshakable, yet their closest forerunner is Wagner’s Wesendonck Lieder. Flirting to varying degrees with tonality these songs inhabit a hanging sensation suited to the poetic sensibility of the new 20th century. “It is not a lack of invention or of technical skill that has urged me in this direction.” Schoenberg wrote at the time, “I am following an inner compulsion that is stronger than education and am obeying a law that is natural to me – therefore more powerful than my artistic training.”\n\nVienna’s van Gogh\n\nAn extreme gamut of personal challenges now dogged this exceptionally fertile period for Schoenberg. In the spring of 1906, he met a young misfit painter Richard Gerstl with whom he resonated. The composer had always felt comfortable with visual artists and recognized a latent talent in himself that aligned with the most progressive trends in painting. Given that he still struggled to support the family, Schoenberg thought he might have more success as a painter in Vienna, so he began lessons with Gerstl. The 23-year-old the artist was Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele’s friend and senior by several years. Together they soon represented the antithesis of Klimt’s crowd-pleasing success.\n\nWhile arrogant, irascible, taciturn, and eccentric described him perfectly, Gerstl was well-mannered, intellectual, and amiable enough to be welcomed into Schoenberg’s circle. Perhaps as an outsider he found a kindred spirit, and perhaps he was motivated to present himself as more appealing to his composer/student’s wife. The composer found a firebrand genius to guide and inspire him, the Mathilde found a passionate lover!\n\nDespite the common association of this marital crisis and its aftermath with the “liberation of dissonance” e.g., atonality, Schoenberg had traveled on this advanced musical path since his embrace of chromaticism in 1899. The composer found Gerstl and Mathilde in flagrante delicto leading to the couple’s extremely painful alienation, and ultimately to Gerstl’s suicide stabbed in the chest hanging in front of a full-length mirror November 4, 1908. Given his youth, the self-destruction of many of his paintings, and the Nazi denunciation of avant-garde art, it has taken many years for Gerstl’s standing as the father of German expressionism and “Austria’s van Gogh” to come into focus with major museum retrospectives and exhibition catalogues. Regardless, Gerstl’s rising reputation is for-ever linked to Schoenberg, who found love soon after Mathilde’s untimely death in 1923 at age 46, when he was able to make a gift of his new Serenade Op.24 to Gertrude his new wife.\n\nAfter Mahler\n\nDuring this time of crisis and until his death, Mahler provided moral and financial support to Schoenberg. Among his last letters to Alma, he worries about who will help the composer after his passing. Despite her condescending manner Alma did invite the family to visit, underwrote a concert, and would give a platinum bracelet to Schoenberg’s daughter.\n\nMahler’s widow soon found a lover in the painter Kokoschka who immortalized their torrid affair with the 1914 painting Bride of the Wind. By the time Schoenberg’s Book of the Hanging Gardens found a remarkably receptive audience, and critics who proclaimed his genius in the Paris of 1920, Alma was separating from the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius after five years and a daughter Manon, born at the height of World War I.\n\nAfter the war’s massive transformation of European economics, politics, and culture, the ever-pragmatic Schoenberg founded the exclusive pay-as-you can subscribers-only Society for Private Musical Performances in February 1919 to protect and promote mostly innovative music from “Mahler to the present.” He was president, Berg vice president; Zemlinsky, Webern and Hanns Eisler shouldered compositional responsibilities. With multiple performances spaced apart to give works time to resonate, Schoenberg’s disciple Erwin Stein was named music director. Programs were not announced in advance. Booing, hissing cheering and for that matter applause was forbidden, as were critics.\n\nA Hothouse for Music\n\nPerhaps nostalgia was at work for his youth as a junior bank clerk playing on a miserable cello in Zemlinsky’s on-on-a-part chamber orchestra Polyhymnia in 1894. Or perhaps Zemlinsky’s short-lived Union for Creative Musicians from 1905 with Mahler as its titular head was the model. Or just as likely, Schoenberg sought to revive the long tradition of piano transcriptions and wind band reductions free form the free-for-all circus of public concert life. Be that as it may, the remarkable treasures presented to on a weekly basis over three years included Debussy’s Prelude to Afternoon of the Faun arranged by Benno Sachs, Stein’s arrangement of Busoni’s Berceuse Élégiaque, and Anton Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony, a shared ensemble arrangement by Stein, Eisler and Karl Rankl. Maurice Ravel and Alfredo Casella played the world premiere in November 1920 of Ravel’s La Valse in a two-piano version. Rudolf Serkin was a frequent pianist.\n\nZemlinsky took on arranging Mahler’s Sixth Symphony for two-pianos, while Schoenberg composed arrangements of Mahler’s Songs of a Wayfarer, Das Lied von der Erde, and commissioned Stein to arrange the work they both cherished—Mahler’s Symphony No. 4.\n\nOf the Society’s 117 concerts, Schoenberg selflessly excluded his own music for the first two years so that 154 works could be given 354 performances by 79 top-notch musicians and well-known ensembles. Since January 1921 the annual inflation rate would soar to 10,000 per-cent by August 1922. Hyperinflation crashed the Viennese economy and finally brought the Society to its knees December 5, 1921 when Schoenberg’s 1913 cultural lightning bolt Pierrot Lunaire, the source of his endlessly replicated “Pierrot ensemble” was performed.\n\nPATRICK SCOTT © 2023\n\nInsurrection\n\nAn arrest warrant for making hand grenades and serving as a lookout in the tower of Dresden’s Church of the Holy Cross ended Wagner’s Royal Saxon Court conductorship after the failed May Revolution of 1849. Dresden suffer-ed 200 casualties, and saw the burning of the old opera house, six homes, and the palatial public gardens. The insurrection was among the last of many such uprisings throughout Europe following the French Revolution of 1789. The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was published February of 1848 in London and that very month a new revolution in Paris led to the collapse of the French monarchy and the foundation of the Second Republic.\n\nWagner had roused passions with incendiary writings and speeches in Dresden, home base to a hotbed of liberals and anarchists who elevated the legitimate grievances of oppressed workers. After many years of living in poverty, he was compelled to sacrifice his hard-won respectability. Wagner fled to progressive Zurich, Switzerland, where he lay low and managed to survive with his disgruntled wife Minna, a renowned actress, stunning beauty, and the breadwinner, while writing manifestos, libretto texts, and establishing the principles that would utterly trans-form the future of opera.\n\nThe Wesendonck Affair\n\nIn 1850 under a pseudonym, Wagner also wrote “Jewishness in Music” for a modest new music periodical co-founded by Robert Schumann that reached some 800 influential readers. By 1852 Wagner met Otto Wesendonck, a wealthy silk merchant, music lover, and owner of an estate with a cottage he offered to the Wagners. The composer gained security, safety, and debt cancellation from the generosity of his new patron. He also gained the friendship of Wesendonck’s enchanting wife Agnes who, upon her marriage, assumed the name of Otto’s first wife Mathilda. The existence of this wife was only later revealed to her later and that she had died a few years before their union.\n\nWagner was under the spell of the orientalist and philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, whose first widely read book of essays had been recently published, Dramatic sketches for a mystical love triangle in three acts were assembled by the end of 1854. However, another spell was working on Wagner’s passionate imagination—that of his patron’s wife, thirteen years younger and the mother of five children. It is believed that their affair was chaste, and that it transpired with her husband’s full knowledge. Like Wagner, Tristan was conflicted by his passion for Isolde and by gratitude toward his sponsor and protector King Marke. This existential predicament yielded an operatic work of illicit sexual attraction, orgasmic sensuality, and metaphysical transformation.\n\nIn 1857 Wesendonck offered Wagner residence in his Green Hill Villa to complete his new opera while the family traveled to Italy. Presumably Minna was mostly left alone in the cottage. The fruit of Wagner’s platonic infatuation was Five Poems for Female Voice composed during that period by setting five of Mathilde’s poems—an attribution delayed until after her death in 1902, when the cycle be-came known as the Wesendonck Lieder.\n\nTwo of the songs were preliminary studies that drew directly from the well that would be known as Tristan und Isolde: No. 5 “Dreams” composed December 1857 (Act 2 love duet) and No. 3 “In the Greenhouse” composed May of 1858 (Prelude to Act 3). “Dreams” was immediately given a chamber ensemble arrangement and performed under Mathilde’s window on her birthday, the day before Christmas Eve. This idyllic fantasy was interrupted in the new year by tragedy. One of Mathilde’s children, a young boy died in 1858. In tribute Wagner composed the one-page Elegy in A-flat Major for solo piano responding to the death with the harmonic language of his magnum opus that dwelled in the nexus of love and death.\n\nFurther difficulty ensued when Minna confronted Mathilda through a letter. Her marriage was destroyed, and she died less than ten years later.\n\nWagner’s second wife Cosima was born Christmas Eve 1837 and lived until April Fool’s Day 1930. She was the daughter of Wagner’s best friend Franz Liszt, and mother to Wagner’s three illegitimate children before they were finally wed. Shortly before his death she reported that Wagner played this poignant remembrance of his life with Mathilde. Elegy exists today as little more than a DNA sample from the juggernaut opera that changed the direction of history.\n\nExpectancy\n\nWagner died February 13, 1883, almost a decade after Arnold Schoenberg was born September 13, 1874. In Vienna Wagner’s music was nearly inescapable due to the public rivalry of antithetical factions supporting the “radical” Wagner and the “conservative” Johannes Brahms when a voracious Schoenberg was learning to be a composer under no one’s wing. Schoenberg learned primarily from studying and playing chamber music and hewed to a classical ideal rooted in Bach, to whose Lutheran religion he converted at age 24. Schoenberg’s lifelong love of Brahms was evident in his late Romantic Quartet No. 0, (1897), in his teaching, and in the ingenious late career orchestral arrangement of Brahms Piano Quintet. By contrast Wagner’s chamber music output amounted to little more than the Wesendonck Lieder and Elegy, but by the end of the 19th century the future belonged to Wagner.\n\nIt was the conservatory-trained composer/conductor Alexander Zemlinsky (1871-1942) who fostered Schoenberg’s embrace of Wagner’s aesthetic—thematic cohesion employing leitmotifs and the advanced chromaticism that was unleashed by Tristan und Isolde. Zemlinsky befriend-ed the slightly younger composer as a mentor in 1894. Schoenberg worked as a clerk in a soon-to-be insolvent bank while playing cello for Zemlinsky’s newly formed chamber orchestra Polyhymnia.\n\nTristan und Isolde was first performed to great success in Vienna the year of Wagner’s death after years of mediocre or worse productions across the continent and London. It is almost certain that Schoenberg and Zemlinsky attended conductor Gustav Mahler’s famed 1898 complete production of Wagner’s The Ring of the Nibelungs. Even more likely was revolutionary production of Tristan und Isolde at the height of Mahler’s tenure in 1903 with the painter Alfred Roller, co-founder of the Vienna Secession, as scenic designer at the Vienna State Opera months before Schoenberg and Mahler met in person.\n\nZemlinsky introduced his wayward sister Mathilde to Schoenberg in 1899. A romance ensued that helped liberate Schoenberg’s imagination. Verklärte Nacht (Trans-figured Night, 1899) fully embraced Wagner’s advanced harmony, dissonance, and endless melody while expressing for the first time Schoenberg’s authentic voice. The story of an illegitimate pregnancy transfigured by love resonated with both composers’ biographies. Yet 1899 also saw the publication of Schonberg’s Michael the German, a short choral work based on a popular nationalistic poem, the setting of which quoted Wagner’s recurring Valhalla motive from The Ring. It was performed by an amateur choir which paid him modestly to direct. In a lecture Schoenberg explained:\n\n“When we young Austrian-Jewish artists grew up, our self-esteem suffered… It was the time when Richard Wagner’s work started its victorious career and the success of his music and poems was followed by an infiltration of his philosophy…you were not a true Wagnerian if you did not believe in Teuton-ism; and you could not be a true Wagnerian without being a follower of his anti-Semitic essay, “Judaism in Music” [expanded and reissued under his own name in 1869]. Wagner asked Jews to become true humans, which included the promise of having the same rights on German mental culture, the promise of being considered like true citizens.”\n\nIn a civil ceremony Schoenberg married Mathilde in 1901, after his pregnant lover converted to Protestantism. Be-cause Schoenberg’s family hadn’t been serious about observing Jewish religious practices, the conversion had little significance than to signal assimilation. Another such gesture was to compose, as his first orchestral work, the sprawling orchestral tone poem Pelleas und Melisande Op. 5 heedless of the landmark opera by Claude Debussy. Both were responding to the popular play by Maurice Maeterlinck (1862-1949) about compulsive love, destiny, and oblivion first mounted in 1893. Schoenberg’s work was savagely condemned at its 1905 premiere in the home of the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nThe 1906 Chamber Symphony Op. 9 (to be heard in Jacaranda’s final concert) marks Schoenberg’s maturity, his first unquestioned masterpiece—and the birth of his son Georg. Gone is the bloated orchestra of Pelleas und Melisande replaced instead by a string quartet and eleven more players. Schoenberg was undaunted by the scandal that the premiere sponsored by Gustav Mahler produced. Soon a trio of new works including the Opus 11 piano pieces, would travel where no composer dared to go before.\n\nSchoenberg’s first important solo piano work: Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11 was completed in 1909 after The Book of the Hanging Gardens Op. 15. Today, among pianists and composers of piano music each of these darkly opalescent gems contain worlds in microcosm deserving of focused attention. The first two pieces flirt with appreciable tonal centers, but the third abandons tonality outright. “It is not a lack of invention or of technical skill that has urged me in this direction.” Schoenberg wrote at the time, “I am following an inner compulsion that is stronger than education and am obeying a law that is natural to me – therefore more powerful than my artistic training.”\n\nAnton Webern (1883-1945) and Alban Berg (1885-1935) joined the master’s private classes in 1905.The proximity of Opus 11 to early works of Webern, Berg and to the great piano virtuoso/composer Ferruccio Busoni, with whom Schoenberg corresponded, is being examined now with more interest. Regarding Schoenberg’s style of instruction at this time, one student among several future musicologists wrote, “All the artistic rules that seem dry in old textbooks and from the lips of bad teachers appear in his lessons to have been born at that moment from an immediate perception…every stage of his teaching be-comes an experience for his pupil…”\n\nIn the spring of 1906, he met a young misfit painter Richard Gerstl with whom he resonated. The composer had always felt comfortable with visual artists and recognized a latent talent in himself that aligned with the most progressive trends in painting. Given that he still struggled to support the family, Schoenberg thought he might have more success as a painter in Vienna, so he began lessons with Gerstl.\n\nWhile the adjectives arrogant, irascible, taciturn, and eccentric seemed to describe him perfectly, Gerstl was well-mannered, intellectual, and amiable enough to be welcomed into Schoenberg’s circle. Perhaps as an outsider he found a kindred spirit, and perhaps he was motivated to present himself as more appealing to his composer/student’s wife. While the composer found a fire-brand genius to guide and inspire him, Mathilde found a passionate lover!\n\nSchoenberg found Gerstl and Mathilde in flagrante delicto leading to the couple’s extremely painful alienation. Despite the common but spurious association of this marital crisis with causing the “liberation of dissonance” e.g., atonality, Schoenberg had rigorously traveled his own advanced musical path since his embrace of Wagnerian chromaticism in 1899. Mathilde was grudgingly convinced by Schoenberg’s friends and students including Webern and Berg to reconcile, Gerstl was ostracized. On the night of a private concert to which he was not invited Gerstl destroyed many of his paintings and stabbed himself in the chest hanging from a rafter in front of a full-length mirror in 1908.\n\nSecond Viennese School\n\nBerg finished his one-movement Piano Sonata Op.1 in 1908 a year after his studies with Schoenberg ended. He was initially shy about showing it to his former teacher, so the Sonata’s astonishing debut performance waited until 1911. Like Schoenberg’s Chamber Symphony, the work compresses features of the multi-movement sonata form into a unified statement. As did Schoenberg, Berg harkened back as far as 1853 and the one-movement Sonata in B minor by Liszt (Op. 1is also nominally in the key of B minor) and more immediately to the Chamber Symphony, a distillation of the symphonic argument.\n\nThe Sonata’s opening theme generates two more themes, which in turn proliferate and mutate. Tristan is certainly echoed in the Sonata’s chromaticism, yet its heightened state occupies a relatively short amount of time. Although the scent of overblown roses is not far away there is a highly satisfying rigor in Berg’s structure, its intricate de-sign supports an emotional state both restrained and charged. This the only piano sonata of what would be-come known as the Second Viennese School, aptly re-presents the group’s flowering among the period’s gilded landscape paintings, eccentric architecture, and daring applied arts.\n\nAlthough Webern’s formal studies with Schoenberg end-ed in 1908, the role of disciple was a lifelong calling. That year his teacher finished the Second String Quartet which included a soprano who famously intoned the line by poet Stefan George “ I feel the air of another planet.” This moment is often cited as signifying the birth of atonality. Indeed, the atonal air became considerably more rarified in Webern’s hands the next year. Paul Griffiths describes some of the effects in his Five Movements as:\n\n“…harmonies tasted for the moment, rhythm measured by pulse rather than meter, infinitely various colors (fortissimos struck with the wood of the bow, nasal sounds made by bowing near the bridge, chords in harmonics)…an atmosphere created by a few strands of melody, a few chords, and an ostinato.”\n\nHere intervals have function, imitative canons provide a glimpse of cohesion and sonata form is abstracted to its barest structural presence. With the quartet’s tightly wound movements ranging in length from 45 seconds to three-and-a-half minutes, Webern’s Opus 5 was a resoundingly original achievement.\n\nThe one-act opera/monologue for soprano and large orchestra Erwartung (Expectancy) is yet another monument of modernism composed in 1909. Composed only ten years after Transfigured Night it reflects a darker scene with a near impossible complexity and expressionistic depth. The plot resonates with the grim events that roiled Schoenberg’s unhappy marriage. Mathilde expressed to a friend that her lover’s suicide was the better choice than hers. In the opera an agitated woman searches for her lover at night in the forest. Her fright deepens when she mistakes her lover for a tree trunk believing it is his corpse. Desperately she searches on in the gloom and stumbles upon a dead body – her lover. Her calls for help are unanswered. She tries to revive him, all the while imploring him as though he were still alive to confess his infidelity. Finally resigned to her hopeless fate, she tries to imagine her life bereft of her lover and wanders deep-er into the dark forest. With its atonal thicket of meter and tempo changes, Erwartung could not be premiered until 1924 in Prague under the knowing baton of his friend and mentor Zemlinsky.\n\nPreface to Arkhipov\n\nArmageddon. The word conjures up something all-encompassing that has never happened, a word that would be lost with language itself should it ever happen. Mutually assured destruction before the sun would set around the globe—is its modern meaning. Last year, President Biden about Vladimir Putin’s escalating rhetoric concerning the invasion of Ukraine rattled the foreign policy establishment by observing, “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.” While those and other elite professionals are now well-versed in the story we are about to tell, most people to-day have no idea how close we came to nuclear Armageddon on October 27, 1962.\n\nHow did we get there? What was the Cold War all about?\n\nNikita Khrushchev succeeded the dictator Joseph Stalin following the despot’s suspiciously sudden death in 1953. He was born in Donetsk (formerly Stalino) a poor town inside the border of Ukraine – where Khrushchev grew up as an “ethnic Ukrainian.”\n\nFast forward to 1956. At midnight Khrushchev, during a closed-door session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party, delivered the so called “secret speech” On the Cult of Personality that denounced as deranged Stalin’s history of political purges and state-sanctioned assassinations. It is difficult to grasp today the intense shock this act of political betrayal caused among two generations of indoctrinated government leaders. Some in the room laughed with choked back hysteria, heart at-tacks were reported, others committed suicide soon afterward. This brazen recalibration of power ushered in de-Stalinization and the so-called “Khrushchev Thaw,” coined from the 1954 bestselling short novel Thaw by Ilya Ehrenberg, who was among the first to break with Stalin’s doctrine of Socialist Realism. The book’s storyline included Stalin’s wholly fabricated theory of murderous Jewish medical specialists conspiring to eliminate party officials known as the Doctor’s Plot.\n\nKhrushchev appeased the pro-Stalinists with unsparing hostility to the west. While addressing the NATO bloc at the Polish Embassy in 1956 he said “Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!\" Twelve NATO nations and Israel walked out.\n\nA bellicose Khrushchev gaining the tactical upper hand when in 1957 the Syrian Crisis exposed the diplomatic failure of President Eisenhower to contain Soviet influence in Turkey and Syria. This standoff was soon upstaged by the game-changing Sputnik Satellite, the first to orbit the earth, which launched the so-called Space Race. Eisenhower would soon be termed out. His Vice President Richard Nixon represented the Republican Party’s best hope of containing the Cold War in November. Diplomatic efforts proliferated to maintain an appearance of status quo.\n\nKhrushchev’s unprecedented 1959 state visit to the U.S., with his family in tow, featured ceremonies in Washington DC, a speech at the UN, judging pigs and turkeys in Iowa, and in Hollywood a meeting with Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and Gregory Peck. To his petulant dismay, Disneyland was cancelled for security reasons. This trip was emblematic of transformation beyond Khrushchev’s economic and trade reforms, surpassing even his relaxation on the Soviet cultural front, which included international art festivals and previously censored books read by foreign authors. During the “Thaw”, jazz was celeb-rated, Black celebrities ballyhooed, and banned movies screened. Yma Sumac, Hollywood’s Peruvian songbird, drew vast adoring audiences. Blue jeans were suddenly allowed, and American dances rocked The Little Blue Light, an emerging Soviet television show named after the cathode rays coming from small boxes in living rooms.\n\nWhile playing the unpredictable cultural parvenu and thwart-ed fan of Disneyland, Khrushchev boasted of Soviet technological superiority and growing stockpiles of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs. Meanwhile the U.S. secretly flew U-2 reconnaissance planes over the Soviet Union gathering images and data as President Kennedy took office. Tensions were running high. International plans hastily developed for a 1960 disarmament summit in Paris.\n\nWhether pilot Francis Gary Powers used “mayday,” the universal signal of distress, when his U-2 “Dragon Lady” spy plane was shot down over the Soviet city Sverdlovsk, the crash happened on May 1, International Workers Day, the USSR’s most important holiday at the time—and the opening day of the Paris summit. The strained meeting utterly collapsed when Khrushchev condemned U.S. spy-ing and stormed out, He subsequently promised to defend Communist Cuba with advanced technology. But the credibility of such advanced weapons was soon undercut by the nuclear meltdown on K19—the state-of-the-art pride of the Soviet fleet of submarines in July 1961. While initially nicknamed “Hiroshima,” K-19 become widely known as the “The Widowmaker.”\n\nMeanwhile, 15 US-built PGM-19 Jupiter missiles capable of striking Moscow with nuclear warheads were deployed in Turkey. The next year, American U-2 planes confirmed the presence of ICBMs in Cuba smuggled via merchant ships. Khrushchev assumed the U.S., with its glamorous young President Kennedy was either weakened by the democratic process or hamstrung by fallout from the U2 scandal and would not respond to Khrushchev’s secret tit-for-tat strategy. Khrushchev’s generals in Polyarny Naval Base launched four obsolete diesel submarines each loaded with one nuclear torpedo unbeknownst to the crew except one outsider on board—the Special Weapons officer. This fleet of four “foxtrot” submarines was deployed to protect and defend Communist Cuba.\n\nThe high stakes drama of the Cuban Missile Crisis has overshadowed the suspenseful story dramatized by the opera Arkhipov, but the clarity of the B-59’s mission failure and the heroic role of a key individual to prevent global annihilation is the more important story today.\n\nArkhipov by Peter Knell\n\nIn December 2016, I came upon an article by Eric Schlosser in The New Yorker entitled “World War Three, by Mistake,” which discussed various close calls the world has had with nuclear Armageddon over the past 70 years. There were frighteningly many instances, so many that the subject of our opera rated a mere few sentences:\n\n“In perhaps the most dangerous incident, the captain of a Soviet submarine mistakenly believed that his vessel was under attack by U.S. warships and order-ed the firing of a torpedo armed with a nuclear warhead. His order was blocked by a fellow officer. Had the torpedo been fired, the United States would have retaliated with nuclear weapons.”\n\nThis germ of a story piqued my curiosity, and I commenced to research the incident further, discovering that the sub-marine was B-59, and the officer who blocked the order was Vasili Arkhipov. I then reached out to playwright and librettist Stephanie Fleischmann, and we agreed to collaborate on a chamber opera about Arkhipov and B-59. Together, we read numerous primary sources from the American and Soviet archives and spoke with leading experts on the Cuban Missile Crisis, including Graham Allison, head of the Belfer Center for Science and Inter-national Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School, and Svetlana Savranskaya of the U.S. National Security Archive, who translated many of the primary Soviet sources, interviewed many of the Soviet submariners involved in the incident, and convened a 2002 conference commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis at which the nuclear dimension of the incident was first disclosed to the West.\n\nOur research gave us an understanding of the events surrounding the incident, as well as a context for the submainers’ life. Armed with this knowledge, we set about structuring the opera, tracing the journey of B-59—from its departure from Murmansk, in Russia’s far north, to its October encounter with the American fleet in the Sargasso Sea.\n\nStephanie’s beautiful and intricately layered libretto provided the foundation for the architecture of the music. Lyrical and haunting, visceral and, at moments surreal and cataclysmic, the score manifests the apocalyptic nature of the opera’s subject matter with an orchestral intensity, evoking the harsh, metallic world of the sub-marine and the mysterious depths it traverses. The low voices of the submariners color the work with darker hues, while an earthy mezzo-soprano and a soaring counter-tenor provide tonal contrast. In counterpoint to the music, a pair of silent characters (played by the same actor) looms over the proceedings in both timeframes: The Zampolit, the political officer aboard B-59, who represents the Communist Party and ensures ideological compliance among the crew; and Arkhipov’s wife Olga’s interrogator in 1998.\n\nAlthough centered on a historical event, the subject resonates profoundly today. As I read the New Yorker article, I was struck by how close we have come to nuclear exchanges on several occasions—yet have been lulled into thinking that the nuclear threat was past. While we worked on the opera, North Korea engaged in constant nuclear brinkmanship. Iran advanced toward nuclear arms; India and Pakistan glowered with (nuclear) daggers drawn. And Russia explicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons in its invasion of Ukraine. The opera also looks at the fallibility of communications, with (mis)communication being literally a life and death concern. The opera gestures at our current global crisis of leadership. With more and more countries sliding toward autocracy and belligerence, now more than ever we need an Arkhipov to be our global Ark.\n\nPATRICK SCOTT © 2023\n\nHis future immediately darkened; his 1898 baptism at age 24 into J.S. Bach’s Lutheran church became moot. Since 1923 Schoenberg had been closely watching Hitler’s rise and was ready. By mid-May the family, prompted by Gertrude’s brother in an anxious telegram to get a “change of air”, em barked for France. Among those attending the formal ceremony on July 24, painter Marc Chagall witnessed Schoenberg’s defiant re-embrace of Judaism in a Paris synagogue.\n\nDisembarking the lavishly appointed art deco ocean liner with Chile’s delegate to the League of Nations, Belgium’s ambassador to the U.S., the great Italian tenor Tito Schipa, and Gustav Mahler’s former assistant conductor Artur Bodanzky who oversaw German repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera, the little family arrived in Manhattan on Halloween. They journeyed to Boston’s Malkin Conservatory for a teaching position that also required traveling by train to Manhattan for additional students. The commute was exhausting, and the harsh New England winter soon took its toll on the composer’s health.\n\nTerra Firma/Terra Incognita\n\nParis rivalled Vienna as cultural capital of the Old World when Schoenberg made his transatlantic voyage. Only the emerging Hollywood film industry vied with New York’s cultural dominance in the New World. Always controversial, Schoenberg was a well-known if polarizing figure in Vienna. Across the Atlantic Ocean he was unrecognized. Only Otto Klemperer, conductor of Los Angeles Philharmonic, championed him. Even so, a cadre of top film composers would soon surrender to the gravitational pull of a brilliant theory and composition teacher in a city where there were none.\n\nMusically speaking, Arnold Schoenberg’s life would have divided more neatly into two parts if the mature music composed in Los Angeles were more often performed and much better appreciated. Transatlantically speaking, the Viennese period (1874-1933) contains the bulk of his justly famous and most often performed works. Standouts include Verklärte Nacht Op. 4, First Chamber Symphony Op. 9, Second String Quartet Op. 10, the Opus 11 and 19 piano pieces, Five Pieces for Orchestra Op. 16, Pierrot Lunaire, Op. 21, Serenade Op. 24, Wind Quintet Op. 26, and the Suite for seven instruments Op. 29.\n\nHis Variations for Orchestra Op. 31 was premiered in 1928 by no less than the Berlin Philharmonic under the towering Wilhelm Furtwangler. While such a highly visible, vehemently quarrelsome, and under-rehearsed premiere would have a political cost, this extraordinary work languished for many years awaiting champion conductors such as Georg Solti and Pierre Boulez.\n\nThe Los Angeles period (1934-51) yields a bonanza of astonishing underperformed masterworks—Violin Concerto Op. 36, Fourth String Quartet, Op. 37, Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte Op. 41, Piano Concerto Op. 42, String Trio Op. 45, Phantasy for violin and piano Op. 47,and the choral work Driemal Tausend Jahre (Three Times 1000 Years) Op. 50a. His late tonal music included the ingenious orchestral arrangement of Brahms Piano Quintet, the surprisingly delightful 15-minute Cello Concerto in D major after the Baroque composer Georg Matthias Monn written for Pablo Casals, the Suite for String Orchestra commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered by Klemperer in 1934—and the overshadowed Chamber Symphony No. 2 Op. 38. These neoclassic tonal works have more in common with Igor Stravinsky’s Apollo, Orpheus, and Concerto in D, than they do with Schoenberg’s great concertos and chamber music of this period.\n\nRoots Music\n\nFor our 21-year-old autodidact the closest thing to a graduation exercise In Vienna was his 1895 Presto in C Major. While It’s unusual for a one-movement quartet to bear just a tempo marking, the C Major key signature was on the nose for conformity. The tempo is neither allegro—quick and bright at 109-132 beats-per-minute—nor the livelier vivace/molto vivace at 132 to 140. Presto is extremely fast and virtuosic, racing at the rate of 168-170 beats-per-minute!\n\nYoung Schoenberg’s well-crafted six-minutes can be heard as summarizing 70 years of speedy string quartet vocabulary. A review of presto movements from Beethoven to Dvorak reveals that Schubert was most likely a model for Schoenberg. Only Beethoven’s third and his final two quartets have prestos—marvels of concision in tight formal arguments. Mendelsohn’s fourth quartet presto matches the running time of Schoenberg’s but not the ingenuity. Schumann’s best presto ends his first quartet sounding like Mendelssohn.\n\nDvorak and Brahms wrote no prestos opting instead for the more genial vivace. Schoenberg greatly admired Brahms and would surely have played the vivace opening of his folk-dance-flavored third and final quartet. Dvorak was composing his late quartet masterpieces concurrently. But none of these works with their sophisticated moods and advanced vocabulary would yet have come to Schoenberg’s attention. By contrast the presto movement bloomed in Schubert’s hands. No less than a third of his fifteen quartets feature brilliant prestos, most as rousing finales. Schubert’s ingenuity, transparency, and virtuosity helped establish the composer’s authority in the genre. Like the manic moods of Schubert’s Death and the Maiden presto, Schoenberg’s restless churning of ideas makes this C Major work an effective opener or closer to a quartet program. On the rare occasion that it is heard, audiences never fail to respond enthusiastically.\n\nLate Romanticism\n\nSchubert’s Quartetsatz was surely known to Schoenberg. He may even have performed the cello part. Schubert intended Quartetsatz as the opening movement of his unfinished twelfth quartet. It is widely considered the threshold to Schubert’s mature style and a harbinger of Late Romanticism. Quartetsatz was forgotten until the score was acquired by Brahms, who arranged for its premiere in Vienna March 1, 1867.\n\nSchoenberg’s lifelong love of Brahms was evident in his Late Romantic Quartet No. 0, (1897). However, by the end of the 19th-century the public rivalry of Brahms and Wagner was settled; the future belonged to Wagner. The conservatory-trained composer/conductor Alexander Zemlinsky fostered Schoenberg’s embrace of Wagner’s revolutionary aesthetic—thematic cohesion employing leit-motifs and the advanced chromaticism unleashed by Tristan und Isolde. He befriended the younger composer in 1894. While playing cello for Zemlinsky’s newly formed chamber orchestra, 20-year-old Schoenberg worked as a clerk in a soon-to-be insolvent bank.\n\nIn due course, Zemlinsky introduced his wayward sister Mathilde to Schoenberg in 1899. A romance ensued which would resonate with a recent poem by Richard Dehmel about lovers trysting in an ancient forest of tall oaks beneath a cloudless moonlit night. Following the poem’s evolving mood and its formal structure closely, Schoenberg composed a one-movement tone poem in the unprecedented form of a string sextet lasting nearly thirty minutes. Verklärte Nacht (Transfigured Night, 1899) embraced Wagner’s chromaticism and endless melody while ex-pressing Schoenberg’s authentic voice for the first time. Schoenberg married Mathilde in a 1901 civil ceremony after his pregnant lover converted to Protestantism. At Gustav Mahler’s urging, Verklärte Nacht was premiered in 1902 by his brother-in-law and concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic Arnold Rosé’s quartet. The late-blooming conservative composer Franz Schmidt (1974-1939), who would become politically compromised by the Nazis, was the additional cellist.\n\nMoonlit Forest\n\nDehmel was the son of a forester who tended woodlands rife with oak groves. He would emerge as a free spirit who chafed under authority, championed workers’ rights, and was acquitted in court on charges of obscenity. He married Ida Auerbach, a Jewish poet, feminist, and arts patron, who had been the mistress of Dehmel‘s rival poet Stefan George. The Book of the Hanging Gardens cycle of George poems was set by Schoenberg in 1909. Dehmel’s poetry would provide a trove of well-shaped psychological sentiment for musical settings by Zemlinsky, Richard Strauss, Alma Mahler, Anton Webern, Carl Orff, and Kurt Weil. Yet none of them attained the Freudian dimension of Schoenberg’s interpretation of Dehmel’s poetry as pure music\n\nThe poem Verklärte Nacht is here freely translated:\n\nA couple are walking through a bare, cold wood; the moon keeps pace with them and draws their gaze. The moon floats above tall oak trees, no wisps of clouds obscure the radiance to which the black, jagged spikes reach up. A woman's voice speaks:\n\n\"I am carrying a child, and not by you. I am walking here with you in a state of sin. I have offended grievously against myself. I despaired of luck and happiness, yet felt a longing for life's fullness, for a mother's joys and duties; and so I sinned, shuddering, I yielded my sex to the embrace of a stranger, and even thought myself blessed. Now life has taken its revenge as I have met you, oh you.\"\n\nShe walks on, stumbling. She looks up at the moon above. Her dark gaze suffused with light. A man's voice speaks:\n\n\"Do not let the child you have conceived be a burden on your soul. Look, how brightly the universe shimmers! Splendor falls on everything around, you are floating with me on a cold sea, but the glow of an inner warmth passes from you into me, from me into you. That warmth will transfigure the stranger's child, and you will bear from me, begot by me. You have transfused me with splendor and made a child of me.\"\n\nHe holds her strong hips. Their breath embraces in the air. Two people walk through the high, bright night.\n\nA Transatlantic Fast forward\n\nThe family vacationed in upstate New York as summer turned toward fall. Schoenberg celebrated his 60th birthday in much better health on September 13 and made a spontaneous decision. He gave notice to Malkin Conservatory and booked a train to Los Angeles. After arriving at Union Station and settling temporarily in Hollywood, Schoenberg wrote to his famous student Anton Webern November 13, 1934:\n\n“If you only knew how beautiful it is here! You have Switzerland, the Riviera, the Vienna Woods, the desert, [the lakes around Salzburg], Spain and Italy – you have it all here in one place. And on top of that, hardly a day without sunshine – supposedly even in winter.\n\nHis all-important immigration card was issued at the Mexican-Californian border town Calexico dated November 13, 1935. By this time Schoenberg had begun to make the film studio scene and meet celebrities. Oscar Levant’s admiration for Schoenberg’s teaching had no bounds. That spring the student pianist/composer and radio gadfly who had just composed the score to In Person starring Ginger Rogers, introduced Schoenberg to his close friend and collaborator George Gershwin. Gershwin’s success and youthful vitality soon became a model for the Hollywood lifestyle. Following Charlie Chaplin’s lead, he had recently added a tennis court to his home. Schoenberg was an avid tennis player, so they established a weekly match and Gershwin became his informal student.\n\nBlack Consciousness\n\nGershwin had already met Schoenberg’s famous student Alban Berg in Philadelphia at the 1931 American premiere of his opera Wozzeck conducted by Leopold Stokowski and was deeply impressed. Meanwhile, his 1930 song “I Got Rhythm”, from the hit musical Girl Crazy, was quickly becoming a standard and its opening chord progression was copied by jazz innovators Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Recent scholarship suggests the “I Got Rhythm” melody may have entered Gershwin’s consciousness from “Humor” the third movement of William Grant Still’s First Symphony “Afro-American” built upon his improvisations as a pit-pianist in Eubie Blake’s jazz infused Shuffle Along —the 1921 all-Black Broadway musical revived in 1933.\n\nDespite Gershwin’s unique Pulitzer Prize for the musical comedy Of Thee I Sing, the commercial failure of his Porgy & Bess in 1935 impelled him to leave New York and sign an MGM contract in Hollywood where he privately battled artistic insecurities. Gershwin often turned to the older Jewish composer and tennis partner to reassure him that his music mattered. Their bond deepened as both were also accomplished oil painters. Gershwin made a point of having himself photographed in a painter’s smock with paint brushes and a large portrait of Schoenberg on his easel.\n\nDuring their brief friendship Schoenberg composed the Violin Concerto and Fourth String Quartet. By early 1937 Gershwin began suffering from coordination issues while eating and at the piano. While living with friends he experienced blackouts and blinding headaches. Then he entered Cedars of Lebanon (Cedars Sinai since 1961) for a courageous emergency surgery. He died from glioblastoma at age 38.\n\nThough it has not been widely enough acknowledged, their friendship was so close that it was Schoenberg who ad-dressed a stunned American audience via national radio giving Gershwin’s eulogy on July 12, 1937:\n\n“George Gershwin was one of these rare kinds of musicians to whom music is not a matter of more-or-less ability. Music, to him, was the air he breathed, the food which nourished him, the drink that refreshed him. Music was what made him feel and music was the feeling he expressed. Directness of this kind is given only to great men. And there is no doubt that he was a great composer. What he has achieved was not only to the benefit of a national American music but also a contribution to the music of the whole world. In this meaning I want to express the deepest grief for the deplorable loss to music. But may I mention that I also lose a friend whose amiable personality was very dear to me.”\n\nThe Crescendo Club\n\nYears later this friendship was memorialized with a piano tennis match by the Canadian composer Eldon Rathburn. In 1944, the Los Angeles Philharmonic had convened a panel of judges including Schoenberg to award a prized commission. In 1991, now the dean of Canadian film music, the commission winner Rathburn composed Schoenberg vs Gershwin: A Tennis Match. This piano rally of signature themes became a “Name That Tune” parlor game among friends and former students at USC’s Schoenberg Institute. Only its director, the conductor/pianist and founder of Piano Spheres, Leonard Stein scored 100%!\n\nKlemperer conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a performance of Schoenberg’s expanded string orchestra version of Verklärte Nacht that deeply impressed Irving Thalberg at MGM in 1934. He needed a composer for The Good Earth film based on Pearl Buck’s bestselling novel. The meeting in Thalberg’s office would have been an errant comedy of contradicting assumptions if it weren’t for the blow to the composer’s ego when his strong ideas were rejected. Although Schoenberg’s film projects never came to fruition—isn’t that ever the most common story in Hollywood—he was taken seriously by Thalberg, and his eyebrow-raising ideas and large fee demands challenged the Hollywood status quo.\n\nKlemperer, Schoenberg, and composer Edgard Varèse were the most distinguished members of the Crescendo Club—not to be confused with the nightclub Crescendo, where Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and Sammy Davis Jr. were known to hang out. This distinguished trio joined with the pianist Maurice Zam, Director of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and Arts, and the Club’s president, to invite William Grant Still to join when he settled in Los Angeles and began working in the studio pool of composers. Upon Still’s death in 1978, Zam remembered “we were astonished and ashamed when he was blackballed by an implacable racist. Klemperer was enraged and boomed out ‘throw the swine out.’ Schoenberg quietly said, ‘No. Instead, let us all resign and let him be the only member.’ Confronted with the prospect of being a club of one, the racist squelched his bigotry and Still was elected a member. Schoenberg’s brilliant solution blackballed the blackballer.”\n\nSchoenberg and Gertrude had pictures taken on a studio back lot with Chaplin, who was one of the composer’s idols. Schoenberg’s student David Raksin introduced them. Modern Times was in production so the actor/director’s fascination with the famous modernist breaker-of-rules was timely. Raksin was working with the soon-to-be power-house composer Alfred Newman on this hybrid sound and silent picture about dehumanizing technology starring Chaplin’s “Little Tramp.”\n\nFilling a Vacuum\n\nEvery film composer who studied with Schoenberg gained greater discipline, a stronger sense of musical identity, and more open mindedness to the possibilities of film scoring: Newman (Diary of Anne Frank, All About Eve), Raksin (Laura, The Bad and the Beautiful), Leonard Rosenman (Rebel Without a Cause, East of Eden), Franz Waxman (Rear Window, Sunset Boulevard) as well as Levant, and Gershwin. With stature and Academy Award nominations Newman arranged for a recording of the complete cycle of Schoen-berg quartets by the Kolisch Quartet at United Artists. Another less visible film composer like Still was Eric Zeisl.\n\nAs an uncredited contract musician, he composed much of the score for The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Zeisl’s daughter Barbara was eight years old in 1944 when he dedicated Pieces for Barbara, a set of 17 easy pieces for piano including a subset from which three receive a rare performance tonight. They are in the vein of Debussy’s Children’s Corner, as well as Stravinsky’s Five Easy Pieces and Faure’s Dolly Suite for piano duet. Those composers were as influential as was Zeisl’s German émigré tradition. His finest work Hebrew Requiem was modeled after Faure’s masterpiece. Barbara would marry Schoenberg’s older son Ronald.\n\nJust a month before Kristallnacht Schoenberg composed Kol Nidre Op 39 for narrator and orchestra to support Rabbi Jakob Sonderling’s efforts to find sponsors for Jews trapped in Europe. Too unconventional for a synagogue, the premiere, was held in the Ambassador Hotel’s Coco-nut Grove nightclub with the Rabbi as narrator and members of the Fox Studio Orchestra. Among the important Jewish composers in Schoenberg’s émigré community was Hanns Eisler, a left-wing song collaborator with writer Berthold Brecht. Eisler returned to the 12-tone method with his ingenious film score 14 Ways of Describing the Rain (1941). It was performed in the Schoenberg home and dedicated to him as a 70th birthday present. Four years later Eisler would be deported by the U.S. for communist activities. From East Germany he wrote in 1951, \"Schoenberg's death shook me most profoundly. I have learned from him everything I know...” Although he was not Jewish like Eisler, Vienna-born Ernst Krenek aroused the rath of the Nazi Party with his wildly popular 1926 “jazz opera” Jonny Spielt Auf. The cover page of the score featured a Black saxophonist. This drawing was grotesquely parodied for a Nazi poster promoting a touring exhibition of “Degenerate Art” In 1938.\n\nMahler & Mann\n\nAlma Mahler and her daughter Anna figure into Krenek’s biography and tangentially link him to Schoenberg. He studied with Franz Schreker in Vienna and Berlin before being drafted near the end of WWI. Stationed in Vienna, Krenek met Mahler’s widow and dated her daughter. He declined Alma’s offer to complete Mahler’s unfinished Tenth Symphony after editing its substantially complete first and third movements. Instead, he married Anna in 1924 only to divorce her before their paper anniversary could be celebrated! Many years later in Los Angeles, it was Alma who sparked the tinder between Schoenberg and Thomas Mann after publication of his bestselling novel Doktor Faustus, and damaging Schoenberg’s reputation. Referring to the compositional method that is key to the novel’s plot, the famous widow and seductress goaded Schoenberg with the claim he was owed money from Mann’s publisher for his intellectual property. Hearsay has it that Schoenberg confronted Mann at the Brentwood Farmers Market loudly insisting he did not have syphilis, as did the character in Mann’s novel!\n\nThe popularity of Jonny, an Austrian cigarette brand, spawned by the jazz opera’s popularity and still sold today, explains why the composer needed to make a clear stylistic break. Krenek embraced Schoenberg’s 12-tone method for Karl V his next commissioned opera and the first full-length opera of its kind. The opera’s 1934 premiere was cancelled in March of 1933 when Krenek was blacklisted by the Nazi’s. Its larger-than-life historical hero and theme of Christian universality was apparently intolerable. Krenek first fled to Prague then emigrated to the US the same year. He was naturalized in 1945. Krenek wrote seven piano sonatas, the last five in his Schoenbergian style. Between the Third and Fourth Sonatas Krenek composed a remark-ably genial and sun-filled tribute to his new homeland and to the birth of democracy. The George Washington Variations can be regarded as neoclassical for its inventive treatment of a minuet from the time of our first president—with the whimsy of a Charleston and the gravity of a military march. This bravura one-off reflects Krenek’s patriotism composed between the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings and Senator McCarthy’s anti-communist witch hunt.\n\nDenouncing Tyranny\n\nPolitical stimulus was also behind Schoenberg’s most patriotic work Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte. After the attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, catapulted the U.S. into WWII, Schoenberg began searching for a vehicle to express his outrage. With Lord Byron’s vivid poem in hand, work began March 12 and was finished June 12. The formidable actor Basil Rathbone was asked to narrate but schedules would not cooperate. Stein who performed piano for the premiere wrote about a late stage in the process:\n\n“He showed me with barely concealed pride and excitement a serendipitous discovery he had just made… the remarkable inspiration which produced in combination the “Marseillaise” and the motif of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony at the very spot where the reciter de-claims the words “the earthquake voice of victory.”\n\nWhile tightly hewing to the 12-tone system with his most effective musical speech notation system yet, Schoenberg allowed tonality to underscore the building of a climax. He set to music 19 of the poet’s stanzas in iambic pentameter. Each stanza sustains an unusual rhyming scheme: A-B-A-B-C-C-B-D-D. Byron’s grand structure helps the listener navigate his extravagant vocabulary, convoluted classical references, and simmering rhetoric. Byron heaps on delicious scorn and sarcasm then soaringly lifts the vaunted name of Washington. The timelessness of Schoenberg’s Ode is striking—we are never without tyrants to despise—as is his moment-to-moment inspiration, direct-ness, clarity, and ability to evoke strong feelings with complex language.\n\nQuoted in a 1938 interview Schoenberg observed, “It might astonish some critics that I am somewhat the creature of inspiration. I compose and paint instinctively....I see the work as a whole first. Then I compose the details. In it working out I always loose something. Cannot be avoided. There is always some loss when we materialize....I am somewhat sad that people talk so much of atonality, of twelve-tone systems, of technical methods when it comes to music.... I wish that my music should be considered as an honest and intelligent person who comes to us saying something he feels deeply, and which is of significance to all of us”\n\nPATRICK SCOTT © 2023\n\nStride Piano & Tone Clusters\n\nAs might an eager army recruit alter his real birthdate (September 20, 1885 or October 20, 1890?) to see wartime action, the upstart musician and Creole denizen of New Orleans instead seized bragging rights. Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe, aka Jelly Roll Morton, claimed to have invented jazz in 1902 at a younger age than was likely. Morton began working in brothels around age 14 after his mother died. Countess Willie Piazza, an impressive multilingual Storyville madam—her ear as discerning as her cigarette holder was long and her business prosperous—soon elevated Morton’s musical status. Regardless of whether his outsized personality and commanding musicality entitled Morton to the contested claim as the inventor of jazz, this distinction has survived the test of time and gained the great record producer Ahmet Ertegun’s endorsement.\n\nAmong its earliest master improvisors, Morton was unquestionably the first published jazz composer when Jelly Roll Blues was printed in 1915. From the Gulf Coast he travelled in vaudeville and minstrel shows, fluent in ragtime, blues, and spirituals. In 1917 He moved to Mexican-dominated Los Angeles where his tango tune Crave became popular in Hollywood. In Chicago five years later, Morton formed the 9-piece Red Hot Peppers and began making popular recordings such as King Porter Stomp with the Victor Talking Machine Company. Buffeted by shifts in public taste and a short-lived radio show in New York, Morton relocated during the depression to Washington. DC, where he managed jazz clubs as a pianist, bartender, and bouncer. His fading reputation was salvaged in 1938 by an enterprising Library of Congress archivist and ethno-musicologist Alan Lomax who recorded more than eight hours of piano music and personal reminiscences of New Orleans in the Library’s Coolidge Auditorium. Morton’s more salacious songs and salty stories were suppressed until 2005. He died in Los Angeles in 1941.\n\nMorton’s ragtime performances involved stride piano style with rough 10-note crashing chords in the left hand resembling what would become known in classical music as tone clusters—attributed to their young inventor Leo Ornstein. Enormous crowds gathered in London, Paris, Vienna, New York and elsewhere to hear the teenager’s sensational solo piano concerts of such virtuoso fare as his favorite, the Chromatic Fantasy & Fugue by Bach, alongside Liszt, Chopin, Schumann plus the fresh sounding modernists Ravel, Debussy, Scriabin—and giving the U.S. premiere of Schoenberg’s Three Piano Pieces Op. 11. Ornstein’s daring programs were jacked up further with ornery works such as his Wild Men’s Dance (aka Danse Sauvage, 1914) with its 17 tempo markings and 33 meter changes. “Insufferable hideousness” snorted a prominent music critic. Nonetheless, Ornstein’s flame burned brightly across Europe through the tribulations and after-effects of wartime concert touring life well into the 1920s.\n\nBorn Lev Ornshteyn in an industrial town on the banks of the Dnieper River in 1893, the working-class boy started making the rounds of conservatories by age six. With prized recommendations he attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory (1903-06). His family was swept up in a series of crushing pogroms that forced a surge of Jewish immigration to the U.S. unparalleled at the time. His Juilliard (then Institute of Musical Art)-based mentor prepared the young pianist for his New York debut and subsequently travel-ed with him on his first European tour. Described as an “evil genius”, and “the great anarch” by his biographer in 1918, The Musical Quarterly (Oxford University Press) described him as “the most salient musical phenomenon of our time.”\n\nFrom Spotlight to Training Ground\n\nHowever voracious Ornstein’s compositional appetite was for pioneering sounds and instinctive ways to organize his prolific keyboard improvisations, he hated performing in public. Persistent earworm syndrome, stage fright, social anxiety, and the exhaustion of being a public curiosity night after night ultimately took its toll. Touring with other well-known pianists to sell Ampico player pianos and pro-mote piano rolls of conventional music was especially debasing despite generous fees. By the onset of the Depression and the advent of radio, the notorious iconoclast stopped per-forming and completely faded from public view.\n\nOrnstein was always astonished at how his music looked on the page once his wife, nee Pauline Cosio Mallet-Prèvost, a socially prominent pianist, created his manuscripts —as needed. A new piece would come to him, then be worked out in his head, relentlessly practiced it, and finally performed from memory. The distinctive tone clusters of Suicide in an Airplane (1921) for example, were eventually elaborated upon and systematized by Henry Cowell, who made the tone cluster an important compositional tool.\n\nThe Ornsteins established a music school in Philadelphia around the time Jelly Roll Morton was eking out existence in depression-era DC and Coltrane was about ten. The Ornstein School of Music offered a holistic and intuitive approach that would flourish in “Philly”—America’s greatest jazz proving-ground at the time—and expanded to other cities until it closed in 1955. Jimmy Smith (1928-2005), an Ornstein School grad would go on to popularize the Hammond organ by bridging jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel to create a new music genre soul jazz that e-merged during the Civil Rights movement in late 1950s and early 1960s. Even more influential and important was John Coltrane his older classmate and saxophone player, who began study at age eighteen in 1944—before joining the Army for two years.\n\nColtrane studied with Ornstein’s Mike Guerra, a renown saxophonist admired by Rachmaninoff for his solo playing in the 1941 premiere of Symphonic Dances by its dedicatee the Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy. According to an important footnote in Andreas Apostolou’s exhaustive new dissertation on Ornstein, to which I’m deeply indebted, Guerra “taught standard method books, but also gave more complicated homework on obscure chord progressions with chromatic scales which Coltrane enjoyed.”\n\nColtrane was known as a compulsive player obsessed with practicing the melody of Schubert’s Serenade, known primarily in the Liszt arrangement for solo piano. With a florid piano accompaniment reminiscent of Ravel, Ornstein wrote the hauntingly elegant Ballade (1955) for a gifted saxophone student. Among the cadre of Ornstein-trained saxophone players researchers have not confirmed that this student was Coltrane, though less likely due to the date. Tantalizing!\n\nColtrane used his GI Bill money to study advanced harmony with Dennis Sandole (born Dionigi Sandoli) at Philadelphia’s Granoff Studios in 1946. Sandole had worked in Hollywood as a musician at MGM during the late 1930s and through private lessons became a devoted disciple of Schoenberg. Sandole whose almost incalculable im-pact on what became known as progressive jazz has been described as subcutaneous and molecular. In Sandole’s sphere was Eric Dolphy, Yusef Lateef, James Moody, Pat Martino, Ornette Colman and Teo Macero, among others.\n\nSandole was uniquely gifted at teaching improvisation and explored non-western music traditions and unusual instruments to identify alternative tunings and harmonic languages that could enrich not only his guitar playing but also his much sought after approach to teaching. Sandole’s most devoted scholar T. Scott McGill, (Schoenberg is Alive: Some Aspects of Arnold Schoenberg’s Influence on Modern Jazz, monograph, Arnold Schoenberg Centre, 2015) summarizes shared characteristics:\n\n“The nine-tone set of three chromatically related augmented triads is clearly at work as an overall structural entity. Schoenberg is using this relationship as early as Erwartung and Op. 11. with rigor. Sandole also uses this relationship within his literature and constructs sets that have combinatiorial properties similar to Schoenberg and uses these relationships for thirds cycles and many other interesting compositional and improvisational relationships.”\n\nMcGill asserts that basic elements common to both approaches were comprised of partitioning schemes—trichords, tetrachords, and hexachords, twelve-tone structures, emphasis on horizontal counterpoint, advanced harmony melodic abstraction, and octave displacement. Given their common task of creating new expression, such technical means were developed as though by destiny.\n\nAshley Kahn (A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane’s Signature Album, Penguin 2002) quotes Sandole who described Coltrane as, “perfect student…in the conservatory he’d walk around with the horn all day playing.” In Coltrane’s handwriting a complex study page documents the scope of his work with Sandole. Fellow student and close friend Jimmy Heath remembered listening in the Philadelphia Library to Stravinsky, and other modern composers to learn from the cadenzas in their concerto recordings. But Coltrane also had a taste for spellbindingly long-breathed melodic lines with dynamic changes such as the Schubert Serenade and the “Vilja Lied” by the Austrian operetta composer Franz Lehar (1870-1948)—an almost exact contemporary and diametric opposite of Schoenberg. The Merry Widow premiered in 1905. Its “hit song” gained international popularity in the 1930s with big bands led by Artie Shaw and Glenn Miller–even sung and recorded in plangent Japanese!\n\nAngel EMI released a glamorous complete recording in 1953 staring the de-Nazified soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf that re-energized the song’s popularity. Vilia, Coltrane’s version of this song about a wood nymph seducing a young huntsman was taped in March 1963, eight months before the landmark recording of A Love Supreme.\n\nColtrane worked intensively in 1946 with Sandole, who became Coltrane’s mentor until a desperate Miles Davis came calling in 1955. Coltrane’s drummer friend Philly Joe Jones had joined Davis’ new group modeled on Charlie Parker’s bebop quintet – a rhythm trio plus two horns. The problem was his sax player Sonny Rollins had checked himself into rehab and Columbia Records was offering Davis a recording contract with his first national tour. In 1952 Rollins had crushed the faltering Coltrane in contrived matchup for Davis, so the trumpet phenomenon was only courteous to Jones under pressure when pushed to hear his friend this untested saxophone player again. Davis heard in Coltrane’s playing the potential for a perfect match. The testy, strained, and brilliant partnership lasted until 1960.\n\nCritics were not always prepared to understand the tectonic fusion of Davis and Coltrane’s new directions, lambasting “Trane” as angry and anti-jazz. The most eloquent product of Coltrane’s maturity erupted with the January 1965 Impulse! Records release of an utterly unique LP. A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane’s Signature Album (Penguin Books, 2003) explores in affectionate detail the many ways that this work has gained importance and spiritual meaning for many listeners crossing all de-fining boundaries and generations. Many full-bleed photographs, and handwritten endpapers give the highly read-able narrative a lively and involving context.\n\nA Love Supreme as a destination on Planet Schoenberg, offers Coltrane’s most distilled, mature, and considered musical thinking. The work’s four-parts last little more than thirty-three minutes. Part I “Acknowledgement” relies on a simple four-note figure repeated in various guises with shifting tempi, embedded in ornamental layers, and ultimately as a long repeated mantra intoning the work’s title. Teased by a solo bass intro, the upbeat Part II “Resolution” exudes an urbane and frenzied ensemble character fueling saxophone cadenzas that lead to a restatement of the opening melody—an insistent writhing phrase that would vamp its way into the hearts of minimalist composers Terry Riley in San Francisco and Steve Reich in New York.\n\nProportionally the longest, Part III “Pursuance” starts with an extended drum solo encompassed by alternating virtuosic horn and keyboard solos in hot pursuit of insistent rhythms in a ecstasy of speed, density, and dazzle. Once again, percussive color commands attention. From a flurry of beats and atomized metallic haze the double bass e-merges, as if from a heat-induced mirage, to deliver a soliloquy of profound inner wisdom touching the mantra lightly. Part IV “Psalm” returns to the roughly 7-minute lengths of Parts I and II. It offers a hopeful vision that is sultry and noble, pained, embracing and defiant. The saxophone testifies while buffeted by a riled-up scenery that responds to its every breath with flying arms like branches in a storm. The work was recorded it in one session December 9, 1964, at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Coltrane’s quartet featured McCoy Tyner, piano, Jimmy Garrison, bass and Elvin Jones, drums.\n\nUnder the concentrated tutelage of Schoenberg, Dennis Sandole became a brilliant and rigorous pedagogue whose milieu was jazz. He often used the master’s ten-minute touchstone set of Five Piano Pieces Op. 25 as a teaching tool. It was the first work in which Schoenberg crystallized the 12-tone method. The five pieces are given contrasting tempo markings with the last piece improbably proclaiming itself to be a waltz. The work gestated over three years 1920-23, just as Ornstein threw down the pianistic gauntlet in 1921 with Suicide in an Airplane. Due to its celebration of the machine as paragon, especially the rapidly evolving airplane, this torrent of notes was describe-ed as the epitome of Futurism—a label Ornstein rejected. He offered no explanation of the title, nor is one needed.\n\nEach and every student of Schoenberg was treated as an individual with a unique voice and particular strengths needing to be nurtured. The 12-tone method was invented to impose rigor on improvisation free of tradition, and the overused rules of tonality, while allowing dissonance to be shaped into an expressive musical language. Pierre Boulez, a relentless seeker of the new, studied privately in Paris with Olivier Messiaen the most advanced French composer of the time. Upon hearing Schoenberg’s fierce 12-tone Wind Quintet conducted by Schoenberg follower René Leibowitz in 1945, Boulez immediately apprenticed with him for a short time and produced the 12 Notations—twelve tiny works each twelve measures in length and lasting not more than say 90-seconds. These highly polished exercises adhere to the 12-tone method, but the listener cannot escape the sound of Debussy and Ravel gleaming in their microcosmic DNA. His advanced student’s work prodded Messiaen to invent a far-reaching method introduced in his Four Rhythmic Etudes of 1949-50 that would apply even greater rigor to duration, articulation and dynamics and become known as serialism.\n\nDegree of Difficulty\n\nThe Chamber Symphony Op 6. has emerged in the last decade as entry-level Schoenberg for listeners and a work by which the most ambitious young conductors want to cut their teeth. The work’s high concentration of technical conducting challenges and compelling formal integrity have established the Chamber Symphony as a key transitional work from terminal Romanticism to modernism. In quick succession Schoenberg introduces two pair of themes that each inhabit a different tonal center. An end-less profusion of intricate variations and contrapuntal interplay in two linked sections never quite abandon tonality but manipulate the listener’s sense of home with great forward momentum. A lunar slow section exhales Viennese sensuality and a fin de siècle fragility only to be overrun by an even more marvelously condensed development of the original four themes. Overall, the 1906 work bristles with ideas embellished by a profusion of sardonic exclamation points only to – hold your breath – stick the landing!\n\nSchoenberg used Franz Liszt’s B-minor Sonata as a model for how to condense the four-movement sonata form into one, and the Schuman Fourth Symphony for its fresh book-ended shape. A contemporary work that may have impinged upon Schoenberg’s awareness was the massive 50-minute tone poem A Heroic Life by Richard Strauss premiered in March of 1899. The younger composer’s Transfigured Night was written between September and December. The premiere of it was sponsored by Gustav Mahler three years later. Strauss’s sprawling action adventure liberally quotes his previous tone poems, parodies his critics, casts his wife in a preening cameo, indulges in an epic battle, and generally touts himself in the grandest term as the paragon of modernity. By contrast Schoenberg is all concision, economy and crafting a three dimensional structure redolent with expression but never self-aggrandizing.\n\nIt is possible to hear the Chamber Symphony as a complex 20-minute opening movement such as Maher would contemporaneously write for his three middle period symphonies—advanced to the next level. More fruitfully, how-ever, is to listen to Schoenberg’s astonishing ability to telescope the symphonic form while drastically reducing the instrumentation for maximum clarity. This mission would become a matter of economics made even more relevant today. After the first World War, Schoenberg would assemble a society of composer-musicians in Vienna dedicated to making chamber arrangements and piano reductions of important pre-war works he was determined to perpetuate into an uncertain future. This short-lived enterprise remains to be fully appreciated for Schoenberg’s anticipation of the economic and political constraints ahead and for teaching generations of young composers in Vienna, Berlin, Barcelona, London, and Los Angeles how to create small ensemble works with maximum impact.\n\nThe opening journey of Planet Schoenberg, September 23, 2023, featured Erwin Stein’s 1920 chamber arrangement of Mahler’s Fourth Symphony, a sterling example of such craft. Not among the works arranged by the Viennese group were any by Richard Strauss. However, in 1954 just six years after the death of Strauss, Franz Hasenöhrl (1885-1970) was inspired to arrange Strauss’s most genial and witty tone Poem Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks. Translated as “little rabbit ears” Hasenöhrl published in Vienna under the name Franz Höhrl. The result, Till Eulenspiegel—einmal anders (i.e., “another way,” – or “for once differently”), runs half as long and reduces the behemoth orchestra of about 80 players to five without missing much and distilling the work’s swaggering charm, gallows humor, and brilliant colors into a striking amuse bouche.\n\nOnce Endangered\n\nMahler symphonies were considered highly endangered and most worthy of transcription by the Society for Private Musical Performances. In addition to Stein’s Fourth, Schoenberg arranged Das Lied von der Erde, and Zemlinsky made a four hand arrangement of the Seventh symphony. Mahler’s orchestral cycle Songs for a Wayfarer was also arranged. Such arrangements have become a cottage industry in the last several decades owing to Mahler’s extreme popularity and the extraordinary intimacy that they offer. This trend may have started with Hans Stadlmair’s 1970 string orchestra arrangement of the Adagio from Mahler’s Tenth Symphony recorded by Kremerata Baltica in 2007.\n\nThe genesis story of the unfinished symphony can begin with his acceptance to conduct three concerts in New York City with what soon would become the New York Philharmonic, soon after reducing his Metropolitan Opera commitment. After the summer composing the Ninth Symphony, Mahler returned to New York and his obligation to 46-conecrts. His own First Symphony was a failure with the critics, and the public found his taste in programs too challenging, so they stayed away, all of which had dire financial consequences. Mahler’s last summer of composing was undermined by an intentionally misaddressed love letter to his wife Alma from the brilliant young architect Walter Gropius. On one of her spa visits to manage her depression after the death of their first child in 1907, Alma turned to Gropius for consolation and a romance ensued. She would have a miscarriage there, which may have actually been an abortion. Her belated confession of the affair led Mahler to visit Sigmund Freud in Holland, after many cancellations. Their four-hour walk in Leiden helped put his life in perspective and reduced his anxiety. The summer of 1910 featured the spectacular premiere of Mahler’s Eight Symphony billed as a “Symphony of a Thousand”.\n\nThe public was enthralled. No greater approval had been bestowed upon him. He dedicated the work to Alma—a futile gesture to win back her love. He went further by having her early songs performed publicly and published, all of which left little time to complete his Tenth Symphony. By November and their return to New York the Adagio was completed and four more movements sketched. Be-fore leaving Europe, however, Alma concocted a reason why she needed to go separately to Paris ahead of their departure. Her letters were signed “Your Bride”. The time away was likely spent with Gropius in unrestrained passion. Given the number she slept with before and after Mahler’s death it is hardly surprising that she is said to have confided that there was no better taste than the semen of a genius.\n\nThe manuscript of the Adagio is annotated with Mahler’s scribbled description, in his self-recrimination and expression of love for “Almschi” the muse wHo had betrayed him. Two thirds of the way into the austerely beautiful journey of elongated lines with harmonies that seem to quiver near focus and then disambiguate, the music swells toward breaking only to become an attenuated whisper of profound suspense. Suddenly a chord of such shocking dimension sunders the silence with a hair-raising dissonance that is difficult to comprehend. But life continues until it ebbs away. This is how Mahler’s last intended symphony opens. Given his committed friendship, Mahler’s death was the worst thing that happened to Schoenberg’s career.\n\nGiven his committed friendship, Gershwin’s death was the second worst thing that happened to Schoenberg’s career. To understand the effect of Schoenberg in Holly-wood, two anecdotes help set the stage. More interesting than the exchange between Gershwin and Ravel about who should teach whom, was Gershwin’s escorting of Ravel to the Clubs of Harlem to hear jazz for the first time. The experience made a permanent change toward the direction of jazz that was signaled by Ravel’s Concerto for the Left Hand. Gershwin and Schoenberg were close friends, fellow painters, and tennis partners. When Ravel was asked about Schoenberg, the Basque asserted that Schoenberg’s influence may have been overwhelming for his first students Alban Berg and Anton Webern, but “the significance of his art is to be identified with influences of a more subtle kind—not the system, but the aesthetic, of his art. I am quite conscious of the fact that my Chansons madécasses [1926] are in no way Schoenbergian, but I do not know whether I ever would have been able to write them had Schoenberg never written.”\n\nHollywood Modern\n\nThe Viennese émigré inadvertently as a teacher gave birth to the aesthetic of Hollywood modernism best exemplified by his student, the Oscar and Emmy winning film composer Leonard Rosenman. James Dean his actor friend and piano student, convinced director Elia Kazan to hire Rosenman to score the film East of Eden, the actor’s debut playing Steinbeck’s tormented outsider in a broken Salinas family. The film’s “Finale” shows a strong capacity to merge edgy counterpoint with tuneful music for the Ferris Wheel scene, literally the turning point in Julie Harris and Dean’s understanding that poignantly ends the film. Shot later but released first was Rebel Without a Cause – another tormented outsider in a dysfunctional family. As described by Scott Dunn, pianist, conductor, arranger and authority on Rosenman, “his score for Rebel glows with jazz licks and free tonality reminiscent of Berg and Schoenberg. Listeners may recall that the atonal cue for “Planetarium” was utilized in the 2016 film La La Land.” Also, that year, the LA Phil commissioned Dunn to adapt Rosenman’s Rebel Without a Cause score for live orchestra-to-film performance. During the early pandemic years, he made stand-alone concert suites of music from Rebel Without a Cause for both orchestra and solo piano.\n\nForever Modern\n\nIn Johann Sebastian Bach’s Partita No. 2, the singular Chaconne follows a set of four familiar Baroque dances: Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue. The Chaconne stands apart due to its length of around thirteen minutes, its exceptionally probing character. The work’s searing intensity makes it sound modern in every subsequent era and gained pinnacle status in the 20th Century solo violin repertory due to the championship of Lithuanian born and Russian trained LA émigré superstar Jasha Heifetz seen on television in 1970.\n\nWriting this month for The Colburn School, Anne Erickson states, “Becoming a naturalized American citizen in 1929, Heifetz began calling Los Angeles his home. In the late 1940s, architect Lloyd Wright, who was also a friend of Heifetz, designed the hexagonal [studio] building that sat adjacent to the violinist’s Coldwater Canyon home.” How the Jascha Heifetz Studio Found Its Home at Colburn.\n\nDuring the course of 29 variations beginning in d minor, shifting to D major, and back to d-minor, Bach’s infinite imagination reveals an encyclopedic understanding of the instrument’s expressive and technical capacity. With the requisite virtuosity, the passionate flow of indescribable emotions leaves receptive listeners in a state of disbelief that such music exists.\n\nPATRICK SCOTT © 2024\n\nWinemaking dates to a time before religion, as we know it, and well before the DNA of myth emerged. The making of wine has been with us for millennia – always changing as technology advances. The ability of historians and archeologists to trace cultural specifics back in time has also grown more sophisticated by powers of ten, while Greco-Roman mythology provides an ever-fertile ground for inventive composers\n\nOrigin Stories\n\nWine intoxication was considered spiritual in the ancient world. Imbibing wine became part of religious practice with the emergence of the Roman cult of Bacchus, or Dionysus, as the god was known among Greeks. Archeological evidence of winemaking can be traced back to circa 6,000 B.C., in the region bordered by the Black Sea.\n\nThe development of clay vessels around 10,000 B.C. be-came crucial to the emergence of viticulture. The Gauls later invented wooden barrels; Syrians devised glass bottles. Archeological forensics have shown evidence of white wine in the tomb of Tutankhamun (c 1341-1323 B.C.), a data point that now seems to contradict the long-held idea that Egyptian royalty consumed only pomegranate wine, believing that grape vines grew from the earth soaked in enemy blood. The earliest chemically confirmed alcoholic beverage, was found dating to 7,000 B.C. in Jiahu village in China’s Henan province, according to Adjunct Professor of Anthropology Patrick McGovern, with the extraordinary additional title – Scientific Director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia.\n\nIn the Old Testament, Noah began fermenting grapes after the Great Flood when his ark came to rest on Mount Ararat in Turkey. Greeks attributed the origin of wine to the mythical mountains of Nysa, birthplace of Dionysus (“god of Nysa”). Nysa was where lived the Hyades, rain nymphs who raised Dionysus, son of Zeus and Persephone.\n\nEmpire\n\nThe oldest bottle of liquid wine has been carbon dated to between A.D. 325 and 350 belonging to a Roman noble-man – a date well past the two centuries of public drunkenness and alcoholism that spanned the delineating birth of Christ now placed at around 4 B.C. Wine was part of the Roman diet and became an international distribution business. The Roman empire essentially established the footprint of the European vineyards that thrive today while innovating with a succession of built structures and embellishments that would eventually draw craftsmen from around the world and define high art coming from an increasingly powerful center – Rome, founded in 2774 B.C.\n\nThe Prix de Rome, a multi-year Roman artist residency and competition paid for by the French Government, was established in 1663 for painting, sculpture, and architecture. It wasn’t until 1804 that music was added. Among the hundreds of First Prizes awarded before the Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968, only Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, George Bizet, Jules Massenet, Claude Debussy, and Henri Dutilleux are heard in concert halls and opera houses around the world today.\n\nThe American Academy in Rome was opened in 1894. Its founders regarded the entire city a museum, an experiential living chronicle of the ages. By 1965, The Companion Guide to Rome (Boydell & Brewer Ltd), was e authored by architectural historian, photographer and writer Georgina Masson (1912-80), born Marion Johnson in Britain.\n\nThe Companion Guide to Rome\n\nAndrew Norman is inspired by architecture, sculpture, painting, and the fluid geometry of MC Escher drawings. Simultaneous to the string trio, Norman composed for the LA Chamber Orchestra, The Great Swiftness (2010), an homage to La Grande Vitesse a public sculpture by Alexander Calder. Since 1969 it dominates the civic center plaza in Grand Rapids, Mich., where Norman was born ten years later. Fabricated in France, the gigantic, red-painted steel sculpture is itself an homage to the country’s high-speed TGV, or Train de Grande Vitesse.\n\nLike landscapes in a window transformed by speed, and Escher’s geometry evolving into birds and fishes, “I love the idea of one sound transforming itself into something else and watching that process unfold,” Norman said. “It’s like a dream where just as soon as you can grab onto something and say, ‘This is this,’ it’s already on its way to being something else.” The transformations the composer observed in Rome, the City of Seven Hills were quite the opposite of speed. Norman explains:\n\n“Like many of the buildings in Rome, this piece is the product of a long gestation marked by numerous renovations, accretions, and ground-up reconstructions. What has emerged is a collection of portraits —nine in all— of my favorite Roman churches. The music is, at different times and in different ways, informed by the proportions of the churches, the qualities of their surfaces, the patterns in their floors, the artwork on their walls, and the lives and legends of the saints whose names they bear. The more I worked on these miniatures, the less they had to do with actual buildings and the more they became character studies of imaginary people, my companions for a year of living in the Eternal City.” The complete work was first performed by Scharoun Ensemble at Radialsystem V in Berlin, Germany, May 30, 2010. It became a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize.\n\n1.
