        "text": "he end of the year: a time when people look both backwards and forwards. And at Gramophone, we’re no different; reflecting on something with the perspective a little distance from an event brings is both healthy and enjoyable. Our Critics’ Choice feature, in which our reviewers name their favourite release from the past year, is always among the most popular for both readers and writers. Some albums appear twice, affirmation (if needed) of their quality; I hope it helps to make your Christmas shopping that little bit easier. But of course we also look further back than that. Art always does, and should; it’s one of the most powerful means humanity has of offering to the present the understanding of the past, and to make that meaningful for our own lives (and…\n\nBeing in touch with the music and personality of Vladimir Horowitz for the past few months has been one of the most pleasant things I’ve ever done, and also one of the most responsible and terrifying ones,’ says MICHELLE ASSAY. ‘I care a great deal for this pianist who first inspired me to go to the piano.’ ‘The Weinberg discography has grown exponentially since his death in 1996, in proportion to his dramatic resurgence in the concert hall and opera house,’ says DAVID FANNING who writes about the composer this month. ‘The quality of recent issues has made my survey a labour of love.’ ‘Words don’t come easily to Andris Nelsons, at least not in English and at 8 o’clock in the morning,’ says PETER QUANTRILL, who interviews the conductor…\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concertos Nos 2 & 5 Martin Helmchen pf Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin / Andrew Manze Alpha This recording really stands out among the pre-anniversary Beethoven releases for its fine sense of collaborative musicianship. VAUGHAN WILLIAMS The Lark Ascending, etc James Ehnes vn Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra / Andrew Manze Onyx An album of RVW’s most-loved orchestral pieces – and ones rarely performed with such grace and sensitivity as here. CPE BACH Complete Original Works for Violin & Keyboard Tamsin Waley-Cohen vn James Baillieu pf Signum The real achievement here is the sense of lyrical line that Tamsin Waley-Cohen carries through all the sonatas, in a perfect partnership with the pianist James Baillieu. BEETHOVEN Three Violin Sonatas, Op 12 James Ehnes vn Andrew Armstrong pf Onyx The second of two appearances this month for James Ehnes, joined here by Andrew Armstrong,…\n\nAmerica’s National Symphony Orchestra has launched its own label. The first album – due for release on February 21 – will be of Copland’s Suite from Billy the Kid paired with Dvorák’s Symphony No 9, conducted by the orchestra’s Music Director Gianandrea Noseda. It was recorded live in June. The recording venture is being produced in partnership with LSO Live, the London Symphony Orchestra’s pioneering label which launched 20 years ago and has since formed own-label collaborations with the Mariinsky Theatre, King’s College, Cambridge, and Colin Currie Records, founded by the British percussionist. ‘The National Symphony Orchestra and I are thrilled to present this first album on our new label,’ said Noseda. ‘We believe that recordings are an essential part of an orchestra’s life because they capture singular musical experiences for future…\n\nCristian Macelaru, one season into his post as Chief Conductor of the WDR Sinfonieorchester, has been named the new Music Director of the Orchestre National de France. He succeeds Emmanuel Krivine (who directed the orchestra on Gramophone’s 2019 Recording of the Year, two Saint-Saëns piano concertos with Bertrand Chamayou for Erato). The Romanian conductor takes up the post at the start of the 2021 season and his contract will run initially for four years. Macelaru, who played in the first-violin section of the Houston Symphony for two seasons, was the youngest concertmaster in the history of the Miami Symphony Orchestra and made his Carnegie Hall debut with that orchestra at the age of 19. As a conductor he attracted attention in 2012 when he stepped in for Pierre Boulez with the…\n\nBorn into a musical family – her father was the violinist and conductor Dmitry Sitkovetsky – the young British-American soprano Julia Sitkovetsky made her operatic debut at the age of 16, as an understudy in the role of Flora in Britten’s The Turn of the Screw at Glyndebourne. Her operatic career has since flourished. A lyric/dramatic coloratura soprano of enormous expressive range, she has appeared at the Semperoper Dresden, Deutsche Oper am Rhein and Staatsoper Hannover, and made her debut as the Queen of the Night in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte at Scottish Opera. She has also appeared in recital at London’s Wigmore Hall with the pianists Iain Burnside and Roger Vignoles. She has made her debut recording with Vignoles, of Rachmaninov songs for Hyperion, which will be issued next year. Roger…"
