        "text": "Robert Fuchs\n\nFrom the late studio of the master of serenades Duos and chamber music by Robert Fuchs\n\nAlthough he composed one symphony more – a total of ﬁve – than his immediate contemporary, Johannes Brahms, he went down in history with his ﬁve serenades for string orchestra and chamber orchestra: People still often talk about the “Serenade Fox” when the Austrian composer Robert Fuchs is mentioned. Today, his works are rarely seen on concert programs, whereas many of his pupils gained worldwide renown. Only recently, people have begun rummaging in Fuchs’ extensive catalog of works and unearthing one or another gem from it – especially in the chamber music area.\n\nThe life of the composer born on February 15, 1847 in Frauental an der Laßnitz in the Austrian state of Styria was consistent and quite unspectacular. He came from a very musical family: his father, Patritz Fuchs (1789–1867), was an organist and composed several sacred works. His older brother, Johann Nepomuk Fuchs (1842–99), was also a composer, a conductor at the Vienna Court Opera and a professor at the Conservatory of Vienna. After having worked as a teacher in Graz for a short time, Robert Fuchs also moved to Vienna in 1865 in order to study under Anton Bruckner, Felix Otto Dessoff and Joseph Hellmesberger. Already ten years later, he became a theory professor at he conservatory there himself, a position he held for 37 years. His pupils included, amongst others, George Enescu, Edmund Eysler, Leo Fall, Richard Heuberger, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Gustav Mahler, Eusebius Mandyczewski, Franz Schmidt, Franz Schreker, Jean Sibelius, Robert Stolz, Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf and Alexander Zemlinsky. In addition to his teaching activities, he also worked as conductor of the concerts by the Society of Friends of the Music in Vienna (the famous “Musikverein”), as organist at the Vienna Piarist Church and ﬁnally as Imperial-Royal court organist. Fuchs died on February 19, 1927, only a few days after his 80th birthday, in Vienna, where he was given a grave of honor in the Central Cemetery.\n\nThe reasons why Fuchs polarized already early on and why his works were in part – especially by the circle surrounding Johannes Brahms – highly esteemed, while others derided them, can only be discovered in a very limited way on the basis of musical parameters today. One incident, which Julius Korngold, the successor of Eduard Hanslick as Vienna’s “pope of critics”, recounts in his memoirs of a dinner with Anton Bruckner seems typical: “[…] Talk also went against criticism, particularly against Hanslick and certain new works. ‘Well, if I wanted to compose like this...,’ he said and hummed a parody of a theme of Robert Fuchs’ ‘Serenadenweiß’ which was popular then.” – Nonetheless, Korngold himself most likely showed great respect towards Fuchs; after all, he explicitly chose him for teaching his son, Erich Wolfgang, based on his profound theory expertise. In retrospect, he gives a very vivid and concise image of Fuchs:“"
