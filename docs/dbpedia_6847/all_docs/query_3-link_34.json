        "text": "The various rounds & events:\n\nJune 20 - final registration & draw; Bolshoi Ballet's 'La Bayadere' (Grigorovich version), starring Svetlana Zakharova\n\nJune 21 - 23 - Round One (all competitors) - includes classical & modern dances; soloists and couples (pairs) allowed; both junior (ages 14-18) & senior (19-26) levels\n\nJune 25 - 26 - Round Two (semifinalists)\n\nJune 28 - 29 - Round Three (finals)\n\nJune 30 - Awarding of Prizes to dancers in all categories + special choreographic prize (among Modern Ballet segments)\n\nJuly 1 - Special Gala Concert\n\nAt the Thursday, June 16, press conference, the following information concerning competitors was provided:\n\nWe received 450 applicants from 38 countries. After eliminations work, including the screening of videos, photos and applications, some 230 participants from 22 countries (including Austria, Bulgaria, Venezuela, China, USA, Ukraine, the Philippines, Russia, etc.) were invited to compete. So far, 201 dancers have confirmed their participation, among whom are 60 'juniors.' The rest are seniors. ***Among the 201 dancers are some 45 past winners of recent International Ballet Competitions & from the All-Russia Competition in Krasnodar, who were allowed to pass-on to Round One without going through the preliminary elimination committee. Some 30 choreographers have applied to the Choreographic Competition (their work to be seen in the modern segment of Round One).\n\nSource: Bolshoi Theater web site press release.\n\n* I will post the list of all competing dancers as soon as it is available.\n\nDAY ONE REPORT (will add/delete/edit this, as new info comes in)\n\nBits of Info re. Roster of Dancers, Jury changes -\n\nREGARDING ROSTER:\n\nAlthough the competition just started, I'm still waiting for the final roster. I've e-mailed the competition site for this & other official releases but have received nothing yet. [Mikhail -- if you have the final roster, or the order for Round One days, could you please e-mail them to me at nnabatova@yahoo.com or post a link to them here? Thanks.]\n\nConfirmed top Russian & Ukrainian names, among dancers:\n\nBolshoi Ballet dancers, incl soloists:\n\nNatalia Osipova (grad in '03...I've seen her...spectacular raven-haired beauty)\n\nAnna Tikhomirova (another top grad of '02 or '03)\n\nLola Kochetkova - competing as BOTH dancer & choreographer (tall, dark-haired Glamazon type; I've reviewed her here before)\n\nEkaterina Krysanova\n\nChinara Alizade\n\nAlexei Matrakhov\n\nPavel Dmitrichenko\n\nAnton Kondratov\n\nBolshoi Choreographers, in addition to Lola Kochetkova:\n\nMorihiro Ivata\n\nAndrei Melanin\n\nKremlin Ballet soloist:\n\nRoman Artyushkin (I wonder if he is related to Alla Artyushkina, Bolshoi star 20 years ago?)\n\nMoscow Ballet of Kasatkina-Vasiliov soloist:\n\nNikolai Chevychelov\n\nKirov-Mariinsky Soloist:\n\nEvgenia Obraztsova (grad of '02...sensation as Juliet at home and abroad...seen by some as a new Ulanova)\n\nFavorite Ukrainian dancers, all confirmed:\n\nAlla Domracheva, who competed as a junior last time, partnered by winner Leonid Sarafanov (now a Kirov star)\n\nDenis & Anastasia Matvienko, as a couple - Denis has already won gold here; perhaps he is now a non-competing partner to Anastasia?\n\nAndrei Pisarev (any relation to Ukrainean superstar Vadim Pisarev of 20 yrs back?)\n\nZherlin Ndudi\n\nYaroslav Salenko\n\n\"Favorites' if they show up; not yet sighted/confirmed:\n\nKirov-Mariinsky - Alina Somova, Julia Bolshakova, and this year's grads, many of whom are to be competing here\n\nTatchkin Ballet soloist Irina Kolesnikova not yet confirmed, but is to be competing\n\nJURY NEWS:\n\nOn Russian TV last night , Altynai Assylmuratova was not among the final jurors named by Yuri Grigorovich, although her no-show has not been publicly acknowledged yet. Instead, esteemed Bolshoi coach & former ballerina, Ludmilla Semenyaka (not on the original list), was named. So Semenyaka is definitely there as a juror. Too, Charles Jude (France) had not appeared as of this morning but there is still a spot for him in the panel; he's expected to arrive later today (Day One).\n\nCOMPETITION NEWS:\n\nIt all began this morning, with Group One of Day One (two groups each day, with a mix of Juniors & Seniors in each) . Standouts in this initial group include senior men Zherlin Ndudi of Ukraine & Ivan Vasiliev of Belarus. The former is elegant & soft; the latter very powerful jumper & Spartacus type of guy, who 'nailed it' with a Flames of Paris variation. No big stand-outs among the women yet, although the Bolshoi's Anna Tikhomirova made an impression in her Kitri Act III variation. Natalia Vorontsova (Russia?) was mentioned as a good junior girl in this morning's group. No junior boys mentioned yet.\n\nNo non-USSR-territory dancers mentioned yet. Perhaps the Americans & others have yet to compete. [uPDATE: Matthias Dingman of the USA/U.B.A.-Wash, DC, competed this morning, as per chiapuris' report, below.]\n\nEdited June 21, 2005 by Natalia\n\nDAY TWO information\n\nFor starters, here are the links to the full lists of competitors, alas only in Russian but many of you should be able to understand the names:\n\nThe 56 Juniors:\n\nhttp://www.bolshoiballet.ru/spisok1.htm\n\nThe 73 Seniors:\n\nhttp://www.bolshoiballet.ru/spisok2.htm\n\nSo out of the over-200 approved entries, 129 actually showed up in Moscow & are competing. Among these, 34 dancers represent non-USSR-territory countries:\n\nJapan - 11 dancers\n\nKorea - 7\n\nUSA - 4\n\nChina and the Philippines - 2 each\n\nBulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Macedonia, Venezuela, Brazil, Israel & Mexico - one dancer each\n\nAmong yesterday's unconfirmed famous names, we can now confirm Irina Kolesnikova, 'prima' of the K. Tachkine Ballet. The Kirov's Alina Somova opted to not compete but there's an 'unknown' Natalia Somova from Moscow. Kirov soloist Evgenia Obraztsova -- their famous Juliet -- is here. All of the anticipated Bolshoi dancers are here. Certain dancers are so famous (Kolesnikova & Obraztsova, for example) that they are practically guaranteed medals unless they fall flat on their po-pos. Ditto the more favored soloists among the various Moscow-based dancers (Osipova, Kochetkova & such). Just my observation after umpteen years of following IBC events chaired by Yuri Grigorovich. :blush: Not that those famous dancers would not deserve it if they dance to their known potential. Hopefully, 'new discoveries' will also be rewarded, if they perform well...as was the case with Thiago Soares (Brazil) in 2001 and the unknown sprite Alina Cojocaru (Romania) in 1997! This year's discoveries could be established stars four years from now, dancing with ABT or the Royal Ballet. Who knows?\n\nTo confirm the final list of USA dancers:\n\nOne Senior: Jonathan Drake\n\nThree Juniors: Kristina Chevchenko, Matthias Dingman, & Jana Feldman\n\nMORE NEWS FROM YESTERDAY (the evening round):\n\nIt was reported on 'Kultura' television news that Russia's Natalia Somova broke her foot in the midst of the competition & is out. Her partner had to finish the pdd all by himself.\n\nEveryone agrees that the standouts among junior men, yesterday, were Ivan Vasiliev of Belarus and Ndudi of Ukraine. A late report on yesterday's morning round also notes -- besides those pointed out earlier -- Miss Sayaka Takuda of Japan, in Flames of Paris pdd.\n\nIn yesterday's evening round, stand-outs (all seniors) included\n\nEkaterina Alayeva of Ukraine - for her lightness, as Giselle\n\nMaria Seletskaya of Estonia - for her contemporary dance, to Stravinsky\n\nLola Kochetkova of the Bolshoi - considered rather weak in classical but superb in contemporary (her own choreography)\n\nMiryana Pop-Alexova of Macedonia - a big surprise! Excellent Corsaire Medora variation\n\nLudmilla Konovaliova of Moscow - very professional, clean classicist, by all accounts\n\nTODAY's COMPETITION NEWS:\n\nA report of Day Two's morning round, in the Bolshoi Forum (by author \"Marekh\") states that the biggest impressions were made by the \"two Americans\" (in parentheses, as names are not typically American) Kristina Chevchenko and Jana Feldman for the junior girls. Ukraine's Xenia Rusina, dancing a contemporary tango, impressed for her sheer physical beauty. Junior guys of note today were Ukraine's Alexander Shpak -- mentioned by ALL reports as superb! -- and Japan's Yasuomi Akimoto in Flames of Paris.\n\nAnother report on the morning round also praised Alexander Shpak of Ukraine & Ilya Bolotov of Perm-Russia, both of whom appear to have danced the same contemporary number by Radu Poklitaru (a modern take on a Chopin Mazurka). By the way, Poklitaru is the perennial winner of the choreography prize at such competitions; he choreographed the controversial new 'Romeo & Juliet' at the Bolshoi. A lot of people figure that he'll win yet again here.\n\nStandouts (all seniors) in today's evening round, according to various reports:\n\nAlexei Matrakhov of Moscow\n\nRoman Artyushkin of Moscow (who was a memorable lead in the Kremlin Ballet's Coppelia not long ago, writes one reviewer)\n\nEvgenia Obraztsova of St. Petersburg - huge accolades for her classical work\n\nVladimir Kuklachev of Israel -- actually born in Russia -- who is being coached by ex-Kirov great Valery Panov\n\nAlexander Buber of Belarus - said to have the most spectacular technique, so far, among the senior men\n\nFrom the writings I've read, it appears that the huge hope of all Muskovites is NATALIA OSIPOVA of the Bolshoi, who will dance tomorrow. [she was my big favorite at the May 2002 graduation of the Bolshoi Academy, even outdancing her classmate, the now-famous Polina Semionova, IMO.] Osipova was lucky to have received a 'high draw number' and will dance on the 3rd and final day of Round One. In other words, she is set to make a huge impression tomorrow, if she 'delivers.' Fans will be there en-masse for her.\n\nNatalia\n\nEdited June 22, 2005 by Natalia\n\nDAY THREE\n\nPoint of clarification: I am not on site, in Moscow. I thought that I had made my location clear at the start of this thread; sorry if this was not the case. I am in my home in Washington, DC, reading/compiling/translating various Russian-language reports on the competition, as they trickle in, as a service to you. Chiapuris, who has posted a bit, is on site & we welcome his/her additional postings. The more, the merrier.\n\nDAY THREE STANDOUTS, as per a compilation of reports on various Russian-language fora:\n\nNatalia Osipova of the Bolshoi - magnificent classical portion: 'Flames of Paris' pdd with non-comp-partner Jan Godovsky. Then people's hearts sank with her contemporary piece: a pdd from V. Gordeev's \"Last Tango\" that seemed under-rehearsed & generally shaky. Partner for this was Ruslan Pronin. Still, the general consensus is that she'll make it on to Round Two.\n\nMagnificent Chinese pair, esp. the girl, Sin SAN, dancing the Black Swan pdd. The man, Zhibbei BANG, is also good, if not as impressive as the girl.\n\nAnastasia & Denis Matvienko of Ukraine - very polished, beautiful 'Sleeping Beauty' pdd [He has already won a gold medal -- maybe even an Grand Prix? -- at this competition. How can he top himself this year, one wonders?]\n\nMiriam Faustino & Gerardo Francisco of the Philippines - surprisingly good classical but downright SPECTACULAR contemporary pdd 'Spiders' (Arachnids), with very tricky acrobatic supports\n\nKatia & Peter Borchenko of Russia - another good Black Swan pdd\n\nViktoria Luchkina of Krasnodar, Russia impressed with her light elegance, reminding one reporter of Irina Kolpakova\n\nDoshan Tabuildi of Kazakhstan was cited as one of the best solo (non-pair) men in the senior ranks\n\nDISAPPOINTMENTS today (beside Osipova's contemporary piece) -\n\nIrina Kolesnikova of St Petersburg/Tatchkin Ballet Troupe - cited as one of the 'most professional' competitors but very 'rough' in-your-face manner, as if trying too hard.\n\nNatalia Domracheva of Russia - she was wonderful in 2001 (when I attended live), as Leonid Sarafanov's partner. This year's audiences are not quite as impressed. She has grown up (body wise) and isn't as fresh & sparkling. People were expecting her to build on 2001 & it doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nONE MORE NOTE ON YESTERDAY's COMPETITION:\n\nPeople are still buzzing about the magnificent Israeli, Vladimir Kuklachev, calling him a new Yuri Vladimirov (ex-Bolshoi star) due to his acrobatic leaps and quick shifts of direction in midair. Kuklachev's coach is Valeri Panov, himself a wonderful demi-caractere dancer & high-jumper from the Kirov in the 1960s & early '70s.\n\nNatalia"
