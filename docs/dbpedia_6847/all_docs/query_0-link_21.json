Students are selected by audition for their potential and mental readiness to begin a rigorous training program. Our Vaganova-based curriculum gives our students ample opportunity to achieve significant technical skill milestones while gaining a deeper understanding of the individual artistic potential and developing greater self-awareness. Led by master instructors Natalia Bashkatova, Zherlin Nhudi, and Diane Withee, our unique approach also includes significant contemporary work and Pilates-based cross-training, leading to the development of dancers who are exceptionally versatile and prepared to enter the world’s leading companies.\n\nMEN’S TECHNIQUE – The focus of this class is the vocabulary of the male dancer, including turns, jumps, and line.
