        "text": "New English Ballet Theatre (NEBT) is a vibrant professional ballet company committed to creating original works that capture the relevance and diversity of dance in modern society. NEBT has become well-known and respected for both its innovative, all-encompassing approach to ballet creation and its dedication to advancing exceptional talent.\n\nArtistic Director Karen Pilkington-Miksa created NEBT in 2010 in response to what she saw as a lack of early-stage career opportunities in the dance industry and as a creative platform for upand-coming ballet dancers and choreographers.\n\nThe company’s original goal was to nurture and cultivate young talent in dance, music, and design by offering exceptional performance opportunities within a supportive and cooperative work environment.\n\nThe company has nurtured the careers of 120 dancers and presented 25 up-and-coming choreographers, 31 artists and designers, 86 musicians and singers, and produced 34 original ballets since its founding As the dance scene changes, NEBT, now in its second decade, is embarking on a new chapter.\n\nFrom an early-career platform, they have transformed into a company committed to fostering the careers of choreographers, showcasing fresh work, and producing outstanding dance experiences for as many people as possible.\n\nConstance Devernay-Laurence is a Principal dancer, actress, yoga instructor and ballet coach currently working in London, NY and Paris.\n\nBorn in France, Constance trained at l’Ecole Supérieure de Danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower, and the English National Ballet School before joining the Scottish Ballet in 2008. She was promoted to Soloist in 2014 and to principal dancer in 2016.\n\nIn addition to her ability to embody the emotional depth of each character and transfer it into stunning movements in ballets like Swan Lake, Mayerling, Coppélia, etc., Constance is passionate about imparting her knowledge and skills to aspiring dancers, sharing her knowledge through seminars and workshops, encouraging the upcoming generation of dancers to pursue their dreams of becoming professional dancers and pushing themselves to new limits.\n\nFollowing a highly successful career at the Scottish Ballet, Constance is currently filming a dance series and pursuing new opportunities in her acting career.\n\nIana was born and raised in Kyiv, Ukraine. She started with gymnastics and folk dancing and just started ballet when shewas 12. Though it was a late start, Iana began to focus on ballet. In 1995, she was invited to attend the Vaganova Academy in St. Petersburg, but her mother believed it was too far away, so she trained at Vadim Pisarev’s school in Donetsk. At age 15, she became one of Pisarev’s dance partners, and danced at his company Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theater. She graduated in 2000.\n\nIana became a soloist at Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre after her graduation. Two years later, in order to be closer to her family, she moved to Kyiv Ballet as a principal dancer. After meeting her futurehusband Marian Walter in a competition, Iana auditioned for the Berlin State Ballet where he was based. She was offered a demi-soloist contract in 2005, and became a soloist the following year. After dancing the title role in Cinderella, Iana became a principal dancer in 2007. In 2013, she made her Royal Ballet debut in Don Quixote, partnering Steven McRae and became a regular guest returning to dance in other productions, such as Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux, The Two Pigeons and Giselle.\n\nAs a guest artist, Salenko has also performed in galas and companies in Croatia, Russia, Italy, Poland, The Netherlands, Taiwan, Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\nBorn in Germany, Mic was always a creative and musical child.\n\nWith his amazing skill, he became renowned throughout Germany during the first season of The Voice of Germany and his following album PLENTY OF LOVE, which was praised as Grammy-worthy by Xavier Naidoo and stayed in the German Top 10 for almost 20 weeks.\n\nHis career began much earlier, though, as a break-dancer and back vocalist for some of the finest Soul musicians of his day. In Germany, when people talk about “soul music,” his name is a reference.\n\nHe signed his first record deal at the age of 19 and released his debut album STILLE WASSER (in German) in 2004, which is still considered cult in scene circles. His track JEMAND DA, which reached the top 100 of the German charts at the time, is still in many people’s ears.\n\nHis charisma and an incredible range of voices ranging from operatic theatricality to soft hip-hop romance to deep soul phrasing distinguish him as an international musician (Süddeutsche Zeitung).\n\nGreat performers like Erykah Badu, Stevie Wonder, and Carlos Santana, with whom Mic was allowed to tour, acknowledged this as well.\n\nHis second English-language album, RISE AND SHINE, was released in 2015. Mic then decided to take a longer artistic break, during which he traveled throughout the world alone, bearing only a backpack and flip-flops.\n\nMic has been involved in various projects since his return, including the singing voice of the Netflix production ‘ARLO THE ALLIGATOR BOY’ (German version), in collaborations with Sami Deluxe, and the release of the single ‘Panzerglas’ in March 2021.\n\nMic is currently working on single track releases as well as a new album.\n\nLaylah was born in Munich into a sports & artists family, so she was immersed in both worlds from the very beginning.\n\nShe began dancing with her mother when she was 2 years old. With 4 she began gymnastics just like her father and added horseback riding in the same year. She found her passion in acting and singing once she joined a musical school based in Munich at the age of 6 continuing until now in her seventh year.\n\n“The combination of acting, singing and dancing like at the musical school makes a lot of sense to me, even though I do see myself more acting in front of a camera rather than on stage. I’m still young and I am looking forward to learning and diving more into this fantastic artistic world.”\n\nLaylah attends grade 7 at high school and apart from her current acting and singing activities she is part of a semi-professional gymnastics team.\n\nIñaki began dancing at a young age in La Plata before enrolling in the Art Institute of the Colón theatre in Buenos Aires.

In addition to his career as a Principal, he founded his Argentinean Ballet Company “Ballet Concert” in 2000, and they have performed on renowned venues and worldwide festivals across Europe, America, Asia, Oceania, and Africa.\n\nParallel to his career as a Principal, Iñaki began his career as a choreographer in 2003, creating ballets that have received excellent praise from specialized press and have been performed on international stages – “La Traviata” Music by G. Verdi; “Romeo y Julieta” Music by Prokofiev; “Sylvia” Music by L. Delibes, “Floralis” Music by S. Prokofiev; “Chopin Tales” Music by F. Chopin and also his version of the classics “Nutcracker”, “Swan Lake”, “Giselle” and “Don Quixote”.\n\nIn 2013, the President of Argentina entrusted Iñaki with the creation of Argentina’s first National Ballet, where he served as creative director until December 2017. In 2018, he performed a farewell tour across the world as a dancer. In 2019, he was commissioned to choreograph “La Dame de Pique” in honor of Pushkin’s 225th birthday (collaborating with Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino) for a premiere at the Alexandrinski Theatre in Saint Petersburg, followed by performances at the Mariinsky Theatre (December 2019) and the Bolshoi Theater (May 2020).
