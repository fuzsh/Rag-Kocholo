        "text": "In 2007, Carinthia Bank traveled to Ukraine for the first time. As an exchange student studying ballet at the Donetsk Ballet, Bank, now 18, participated in weekend trips scheduled by the company for its visiting students. Here she recognized a refinement that, according to her, most people don’t discern in a country that, in the late 20th century, struggled to manage its independence from a Soviet regime.\n\n“A lot of people say that it’s not a beautiful place, but I think it is,” says the soft-spoken Chestnut Hill native.\n\nAs for the dance training, “it was just really intense,” says Bank. “The teachers want you to get the most out of it, so they give you a lot of corrections and attention. You want to do a good job, so you push yourself more than you normally would. I was a lot younger then and it was hard.”\n\nAccompanied by a handful of other promising students from Wissahickon Dance Academy, Bank traveled to Donetsk through Philadelphia’s International Ballet Exchange, benefiting from a relationship the nonprofit’s executive director Nancy Malmed has worked tirelessly to cultivate between IBE and the Donetsk Ballet.\n\nAlthough the company has always welcomed a partnership with IBE, Ukraine, and the ever-evolving city of Donetsk, haven’t always been an environment congenial to young students. In 1993, Malmed brought her first group of students over, but found that the country’s eight-year recession that followed its independence made future trips more difficult.\n\n“In 1995, the country had fallen apart when we went back, and it was a horrible experience,” says Malmed. “We didn’t go back again until 2003, when we were invited back for a big festival. We saw how the city had changed, how money had been infused in it; Donetsk resembled a little Paris, so cosmopolitan, and that’s when I decided I could bring kids back again in 2007.”\n\nThe company’s artistic director, Vadim Pisarev, welcomed the American students, especially Bank. Pisarev, who used the studio at Wissahickon Dance Academy as a rehearsal space during tours through the U.S., had seen Bank dance during summer classes. Like Bank’s estimation of a beautiful Ukraine beneath a distressed economy, the Ukrainian performer recognized a unique talent.\n\n“[Pisarev] saw Carinthia at a very early age,” says Malmed. “When Carinthia came with me in 2007 to study at his school in Ukraine, he looked at Carinthia and he said, ‘She is our future.'”\n\nWhen Bank graduated from the Kirov Academy in Washington, D.C., this past May, Pisarev invited her to join the Donetsk Ballet. Deferring her enrollment in Princeton University, Bank joined the company in September for two months of rehearsals before a weeklong tour in France.\n\nDespite a multitude of cultural barriers, ballet and the kindness of fellow dancers, she found, acted as a bridge, and her transition to life in the Eastern European country wasn’t as dramatic as she anticipated.\n\n“Obviously I don’t understand much Russian,” says Bank. “But the company has been very nice about helping me, and they translate for me. Even if they can’t convey a specific movement in English, they are really understanding of the fact that it might take me longer to understand. They’ve been very patient.”\n\nWhen Bank dances in the Donetsk Ballet’s performance of “The Nutcracker” at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting on Dec. 15 and 16, it will be the realization of a young woman’s international achievements. But, whereas the ballet’s lead, Clara, falls back to sleep at the close of a whirlwind adventure, throwing the entire story into the shroud of a dream, Bank’s career is no figment – though it may feel like one to a budding professional.\n\n“I’ve been watching the Donetsk Ballet perform ‘The Nutcracker’ with my studio since I was 8 years old, and I always really admired them,” she says. “Dancing with amazing people that I’ve looked up to for so long is a dream come true.”\n\nAs any young person does, Bank dreams for miles, and her aspirations seem limitless. When she enrolls in Princeton next fall, she hopes to test subjects outside of ballet.\n\n“I’ve spent so much time focused on ballet, so there are a lot of things I want to explore in college,” Bank says. “I am interested in journalism, and I’m interested in food. My other dream job would be writing for Bon Appetit magazine. I’m also interested in travel, so writing about it would be amazing. I really don’t know. I want to go to college and explore.”\n\nMalmed and the IBE are just as forward-thinking. The organization, which also works with Philadelphia schools to bring ballet to low-income students, is hoping to take another several talented dancers to study abroad.\n\n“We’re going to take a group of students this summer to Cuba,” Malmed says. Whether bringing teachers into local schools, or traveling thousands of miles to introduce exceptional students to a world-renowned company, the IBE, and those like Bank, whose talents it cultivates, are testaments to the value of a dance education.\n\n“Our program gives kids a broad perspective of ballet,” says Malmed. “It is an international perspective, and it is invaluable.”\n\nThe Donetsk Ballet’s\n\n“The Nutcracker”\n\nRuns at Plymouth\n\nWhitemarsh High School,\n\n201 East Germantown Pike\n\nPlymouth Meeting, PA. 19462,\n\nSaturday, Dec. 15,\n\n6:30 p.m. and\n\nSunday, Dec. 16,\n\n2 p.m.\n\nTickets: $18 – $28.\n\nInfo: 215-849-7950 or\n\n1-800-849-4919."
