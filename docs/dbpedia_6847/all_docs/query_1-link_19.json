        "text": "Another laureate, Julio Bocco, a dancer of great charm and temperament, was already an established professional with excellent technique despite his young age. According to Bocco, a contemporary dancer must establish contact with the audience, be a sensitive partner, and, consequently, be a thinking artist and master technique. All of this makes up the portrait of the ideal artist, which for Bocco is Vladimir Vasiliev. After the competition, the dancer was invited by Mikhail Baryshnikov to join the American Ballet Theatre (New York), and in 1990 he established his own company, the Ballet Argentino (Buenos Aires).\n\nOne of the highlights of the third round was the performance of Nina Ananiashvili and Andris Liepa. This duo had been together since the last competition in 1981. In 1985, Nina Ananiashvili was awarded the gold medal, and her partner got the silver one. In this duo of two Bolshoi soloists, audiences were attracted by the surprising combination of naturalness and spontaneity of their performance with a carefully considered form.\n\nSeveral related events took place during the competition. At the end of the first round, a meeting with the international jury members was organized. It was held in the Round Hall of the Bolshoi Theatre. During the meeting, guests and professionals discussed music's role in ballet and its importance as a stimulus for choreography development.\n\nThe events of the competition were widely covered in the media. Soviet and foreign journalists, and representatives of significant agencies from 25 countries, were accredited to the Press Centre."
