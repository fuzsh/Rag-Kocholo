        "text": "Reposting of Theater Plus blog No. 213. This was a real shame, the removal of ON.TEATR from its space in St. Petersburg. It turned out not to be quite the political football that it appeared at first (as reflected in my piece below), but was mostly a spat between neighbors. A woman in the same building didn’t like the theater and, since she had strings to pull, she pulled them to get rid of it. It went on to perform for another year and a half at other spaces in St. Petersburg, its last being a space on Vasilyevsky Island, where it performed its last shows in December 2014. Milena Avimskaya, who founded On.Teatr, tells me now she weighed the decision to close the theater even more seriously than her decision to open it. She said that all over St. Petersburg small theaters, laboratories and studios began popping up – “some with names like N.Teatr or O.Teatr.” Major directors such as Andrei Moguchy and Yury Butusov opened their own director’s studios at their theaters. In short, the mission of ON.TEATR, had been fulfilled and was expanding by leaps and bounds, even without ON.TEATR. For the record, Avimskaya is now the managing director at the Russian Army Theater in Moscow, and on March 25, 2018, she will open – a new directorial studio there. Good ideas do not die. They merely come back as different good ideas. A little unsettling now is the little tack-on I did at the end of this piece: bearing witness to the beginning of the end of the old Teatr.doc in Moscow. The visit from the fire inspector that Yelena Gremina tells about was the first salvo leading to the closing of the theater’s original space. So much going down, down, down, down. My photo above shows the exterior of ON.TEATR, which was a short-lived, but highly influential venue for new theater in St. Petersburg.\n\n21 April 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nSince moving into a basement space at 18 Ulitsa Zhukovskogo in 2011, St. Petersburg’s ON.TEATR has fostered something the city on the Neva River has not had for decades — a strong and viable youth movement.\n\nGathering around the energetic and visionary Milena Avimskaya, the theater’s founder, young St. Petersburg directors, actors and writers began creating new work and having an impact on the city’s mainstream venues.\n\nAll of that now is in danger of being lost.\n\nComplaints about noise from upstairs neighbors, followed by inspections from St. Petersburg’s safety regulators, have nearly brought the theater to a standstill. A second court date on Tuesday ended with the city closing ON.TEATR temporarily. It was ordered to stop all activities for 90 days, after which the court will determine whether safety irregularities have been solved.\n\nAccording to a report on 100 TV, ON.TEATR’s attorney Ilya Chernyshyov stated that he would file an appeal so that the theater may continue to perform through the end of April. In fact, on the evening of the trial the theater unveiled its newest production, Konstantin Steshik’s “A Time to Be Ashes.” Only time will tell whether that title proves to be prophetic or not.\n\nSpeaking to me by phone on Friday, Avimskaya sounded a frustrated but defiant note. She has heard rumors through back channels that officials have given the order to “destroy” the theater and yet, she said, “like pioneer scouts we stand strong and do everything we can to fix the problems.”\n\nThese problems are relatively small, but nearly insurmountable since the configurations of the basement space do not correspond to basic city regulations. As Avimskaya stated in an interview with St. Petersburg’s Argumenty i Fakty, there is little that can be done. The ceiling, for example, is ten centimeters lower than what is allowed for public organizations. Door apertures are smaller than the prescribed minimum, by a total of 12 centimeters in width and 15 centimeters in height. Major structural changes that could do irreparable damage to the 130 year-old building would be required to bring the space into accordance with the law.\n\n(I would like to correct an error I made in my blog report about this incident three weeks ago. Relying on numerous internet sources I stated that following the first court case in March ON.TEATR was ordered to pay a fine of 20,000 rubles [$635]. In fact, Avimskaya confirmed to me, the fine was for 200,000 rubles [$6,357], which comes due at the end of April.)\n\nThe basement was originally granted to ON.TEATR by the city’s culture committee, apparently without any thought being given to whether or not it was suitable for a theater.\n\nIn the two years since the theater opened its doors, the collective of artists benefitting from the theater’s appearance has spent countless thousands of hours and hundreds of thousands of rubles, cleaning and renovating the space. Avimskaya noted that, in order to show building occupants that the theater could be a good neighbor, the theater has done much to improve shared space around and in the building, including cleaning the courtyard, putting up good outside lighting, rebuilding a broken gate, installing an intercom and electronic entry system, as well as repairing faulty water pipes in the building.\n\nHowever, at present, Avimskaya admitted on Friday, it increasingly looks like ON.TEATR will have to occupy a new space if it is to be kept alive. She is actively searching for a possible replacement venue.\n\n“I have looked at many places, but have not found one that fits yet,” she declared.\n\nStill, one possibility is Lenfilm Studios, which has recently undergone major renovations. Avimskaya toured the studio grounds recently and believes it could be a potential match. “These are people who understand that developing new talent is important, and they can also benefit from it,” she stated. She said she can imagine moving performances to a location at Lenfilm and keeping Ulitsa Zhukovskogo as a rehearsal space.\n\nAvimskaya’s natural optimism is tempered by the harsh reality of the situation that has arisen. She has been told repeatedly by officials at the St. Petersburg Culture Committee that she should “keep going” and that she has their support. Even after the court order to close the theater on Tuesday an official repeated his exhortation for her to “keep going.” Yet she suggests that real support from culture bureaucrats has been lacking.\n\n“I’m not doing this for myself,” she told me. “I am not a director defending my own shows. I represent 25 directors and 200 actors who work at ON.TEATR. We have made an impact, thank God. I can now take cover behind the back of Dmitry Volkostrelov, who just won a Golden Mask award this week. Dima is one of the many young artists who began working at ON.TEATR. The city must understand that this is to their advantage. I won’t do it alone.”\n\nIn an apparently unrelated development, Moscow’s Teatr.doc has also been visited by safety inspectors. Theater co-founder Yelena Gremina posted a note on her Facebook page Friday evening, stating that fire inspectors had gone through the Teatr.doc basement space earlier in the day and had found some violations. One was that the new door which the theater installed just months ago was found to be unlawful — its width of 110 centimeters fell 10 centimeters short of the required 120 centimeters for a public organization.\n\nA court hearing on the violations was set for Thursday morning and an undisclosed fine was levied, although Gremina stated the amount was reduced significantly when she convinced the inspectors to fine her personally rather than fine Teatr.doc as an organization.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 211. Extremely rarely did I use my blog space to write something like a review. One of the instances in which I might do that was during the Golden Mask Festival – it gave me an opportunity to write about shows I would not normally be able to write about (since my policy was to write about shows that readers could go out and see, i.e, shows produced and performed in Moscow). This meant that every year I pretty much got to write a review of a production by Lev Dodin. This particular year, however, there was no Dodin to write about – so some other St. Petersburg theaters got the spotlight. The photo above, from the Golden Mask archives, is of “Antibodies,” a production by St. Petersburg’s Baltiisky Dom. (One of the shows I discuss below, Pavel Pryazhko’s “Haughty Girl” underwent a name change in English, when I later translated and published it in TheatreForum journal as “Angry Girl,” which I came to realize was much closer to the original intent.)\n\n07 April 2013\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nThere was plenty of talk when the nominations for this year’s Golden Mask awards were announced and St. Petersburg’s Lev Dodin was nowhere to be found among them.\n\nDodin, the master of the Maly Drama Theater — known in the West affectionately as “the Maly” — is a perennial nominee and almost a perennial winner. He has been the standard-bearer for theatrical excellence in St. Petersburg since the late 1980s and he still is that, make no mistake.\n\nBut things have changed, make no mistake about that either. That became quite clear to me on Thursday and Friday. In the course of those two days I saw three shows from St. Petersburg, each very different, each a huge success if taken on its own terms.\n\nBut let’s get one messy detail out of the way before we expand upon that.\n\nThe day is long gone when an actor or director worked with a “home” company and rarely strayed. So when we talk “St. Petersburg productions,” we’re also talking about some pretty important Moscow talent. Just as some significant St. Petersburg talent has begun to call Moscow at least a home-away-from-home — consider the movie star Konstantin Khabensky at the Moscow Art Theater or the director Yury Butusov working at the Satirikon, the Art Theater and the Pushkin Theater.\n\nAs such, some of the St. Petersburg shows at the Golden Mask have a Moscow stamp. The Alexandrinsky’s scintillating “Hedda Gabler” was staged by Moscow’s Kama Ginkas. (Although Ginkas attended theater institute in Leningrad in the 1960s and worked there sporadically in the 1970s.) “Lear,” a production of the Priyut Komedianta, was staged by Konstantin Bogomolov, who was born, bred and began his career in Moscow. Even Mikhail Patlasov, who directed “Antibodies” for Baltiisky Dom, spent a few years studying in Moscow after beginning his career in Perm, but before moving to St. Petersburg.\n\nThe point is that I am not referring to a “purely” St. Petersburg kind of theater art. But the fact remains: in two days I saw three highly innovative shows that originated in the city on the Neva River.\n\nThe first I saw was Dmitry Volkostrelov’s staging of Pavel Pryazhko’s “Haughty Girl,” produced by the Bryantsev Theater Yunogo Zritelya and Post Theater. Born in Moscow 30 years ago, Volkostrelov studied in St. Petersburg with Dodin and founded his Post Theater there a few years ago, although, let’s note, he was born in Moscow and he told me Thursday that he now is spending most of his time here.\n\nVolkostrelov has earned a strong following (while baffling some) with a distinctive style that seems to take the notion of “realism” to extremes. His actors move around the stage, sometimes talking to themselves, sometimes busying themselves silently with tasks the audience has no way of understanding. If I had to find comparisons to make the point I might compare his works to the paintings of Edward Hopper, say, or to the way we perceive what fish are up to in an aquarium.\n\nMost of the time in recent years Volkostrelov has worked with the texts of Pavel Pryazhko, a Minsk-based writer whose plays originally appeared in Moscow thanks to Teatr.doc, and who increasingly seems to be seeking ways to break down the theatrical and dramatic process in new ways.\n\nPryazhko’s “The Soldier,” for example, consists of two sentences and Volkostrelov’s production takes 15 minutes to perform. Yet it is more fully defined than most new plays I see produced. Another recent collaboration between the two was “I Am Free” — wherein Volkostrelov stood in front of an audience showing 90 minutes of bleak slides “organized” dramaturgically by Pryazhko. When I saw this performance in September it really angered most people in the hall. Volkostrelov, who constantly wears an almost imperceptible grin on his lips, never changed expressions once as people shouted at him and he continued to click his computer to bring up the next slide.\n\nBy comparison, “Haughty Girl” might seem a traditional play — although it is nothing of the sort. There is almost no dialogue. Most of the text is prose description or narration with a few monologues tossed in. Volkostrelov’s actors lounge on stage, go to bed, sleep, fix coffee, watch movies on their computers, swim in swimming pools and stand jumping up and down in the cold. Rarely do they actually do what the words of the play say, so there is usually a gap in what we perceive. It works a little bit like stereo, I guess, whereby our brains are given two sets of information simultaneously — what we see and what we hear. It’s up to us to make of it what we will.\n\nI found the show to be a brilliant and incisive portrait of a generation.\n\nOne hour after the conclusion of “Haughty Girl,” with its highly stylized, super-clean visual lines, I found myself staring at the wildly chaotic set for Patlasov’s production of “Antibodies.” This is a piece of documentary theater, based on interviews with people involved in one way or another in the 2005 murder of a young antifascist in St. Petersburg. In well edited snippets we hear from the mothers of the killer and the victim, from the victim’s girlfriend, from a security guard who watched the event occur, from one of the killer’s fascist friends and from the police investigator.\n\nThe story is harrowing and, what is more, the production is too.\n\nThat is a tremendous achievement. If I have a complaint with documentary drama as we usually see it — and, boy, do I ever — it is that the shows we see are often weaker and less involving than the burning topics they take on. After attending documentary productions about murder and mayhem I often leave the theater grateful that someone is taking on these controversial topics, but underwhelmed by the theatrical experience. At worst, this does legitimate social or political topics a great injustice by making them seem banal.\n\n“Antibodies” raises the level of its performance to match the drama and horror of its topic. It’s the kind of show that leaves an audience stunned. Questions of whether you “like” what you saw or not are beside the point. The show does what it intends to – make you feel that suffering, anger and helplessness that destroyed (or did not destroy) the lives of those affected by a senseless murder.\n\nThe set designed by Valentina Serebrennikova is brilliant (although she is inexplicably not nominated for a Golden Mask award). It uses a multitude of surfaces — doors, walls, glass panes, human bodies and such — on which to project light or video projections fed from two live cameras stalking the stage with the actors. The juxtaposition of close-ups, long shots and mirrored effects conceived by video designer Yelena Anisimova either expands the significance of the images we see, or breaks down our sense of visual unity, depending upon the device being used at any given moment.\n\nAs for the acting, it is arguably the finest I have ever seen in a Russian docudrama. There isn’t a wisp of overacting. Yet the connection between each performer and his/her character is so deep that it leaves a profound impression on us. It’s no coincidence that Olga Belinskaya is nominated for Best Actress. She is superb in the devastating role of the killer’s mother.\n\nFriday I took in Bogomolov’s “Lear.” Bogomolov has become something of the bete noir of Russian theater lately, his kitsch-laden, inventive, poetic and pop-oriented shows garnering him huge groups of fans and detractors.\n\n“Lear,” as the title suggests, is less than Shakespeare’s “King Lear” – but it is also much more. This garish, in-your-face production is a mostly comic riff on the theme of the tragedy. It is set in the Moscow Kremlin before and during World War II, with a few scenes moving to an insane asylum and the front line of military action. Most characters bear Russian or Russianized names and General Secretary Lear, if I may put it that way, is a foul-mouthed, enigmatic character whose behavior changes little, regardless of whether he is in full charge or himself is in the charge of psychiatrists.\n\nThe text includes bits of Shakespeare, Varlam Shalamov, Paul Celan, Friedrich Nitzsche (his Zarathustra is a character in the play) and others. In all cases men play female characters, women play male characters.\n\nIt is a violent, crazy, irreverent portrayal of the way dictatorial power consumes everyone who touches it. The twist here, however, is that dictators and their sycophants never die. They just get up from their bloody spots on the floor and carry on dictating and scheming.\n\nBogomolov created a comic-book version of Shakespeare’s story (not play), that yanks it into the modern world. His version of Lear-as-Stalin is on no way time specific. This cold, reptilian, zombie-like dictator is a dictator for all seasons.\n\nI hesitate to draw any far-reaching conclusions based on this trio of shows. Twelve, 14 years ago St. Petersburg seemed poised to make a huge leap forward, as several young directors began making very impressive, important work. But that kind of petered out, if you’ll pardon the sour pun.\n\nAs such, I’ll avoid making any grand predictions. But I do want to say: St. Petersburg theaters have provided me with the most rewarding hours I have spent so far at this year’s Golden Mask Festival.\n\nReposting of Theater Plus blog No. 162. This is a video blog with Tom Sellar, the editor of Theatre magazine and a member of the faculty at the Yale School of Drama. Although I’ve said it many times, I’ll say it again: I loved these video blogs because they allowed me to open the field of discourse to other voices.\n\n09 April 2012\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nTom Sellar sees a lot of theater around the world in his capacity as editor of the prestigious Theatre magazine published by Yale University. He knows American theater well — particularly American theater made in New York — because of his position as theater critic for the Village Voice. Over the years he has kept an eye on Russian theater as well.\n\nStarting in 2003 he began taking stock of theater in Eastern Europe, looking to put together a series of special issues of Theatre based on work in Russia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine and Poland. Those issues, which came out over a prolonged period for most of the first decade of the century, informed American readers of some of the most important writers, directors, theaters and trends in the East.\n\nSellar was in Moscow in 2005 collecting information and doing interviews for a double issue of his magazine on the state of the art in Russia. That issue, which came out in 2006, has been through numerous print runs and is still one of the main sources for information in English on Russian theater in the 2000s.\n\nI crossed paths with Sellar on Saturday at the Meyerhold Center and asked him to give me five minutes of his time. He is currently in Moscow to attend the Russian Case festival, a small showcase put on for foreigners within the Golden Mask Festival. We sat down in the theater’s cafeteria in front of a poster for Vsevolod Meyerhold’s ground-breaking production of Nikolai Erdman’s “The Mandate” in 1925. It seemed like a fitting place to talk about the innovative theater Tom is here to see this month.\n\nHe pointed out that one show he attended, “Two in Your House” at Teatr.doc, is an example of the new political work cropping up in Russia. Based on the story of a Belarusian presidential candidate who was put under house arrest after losing the election in 2010, it is an example of new political theater “acquiring special power,” said Sellar.\n\nOne difference he noticed since his last trip to Moscow is that “no one wanted to talk politics” in 2005. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Now everybody is talking about it and “the discussions have been as interesting as the plays,” he declared.\n\nHe also attended a performance of Yury Butusov’s “The Seagull” at the Satirikon, a show of “extraordinary energy” that, he added, demonstrates the “making and unmaking of Russian traditional classical theater” today.\n\nWhen I asked Sellar about an interview he did with the Ukrainian-born, Russian-language playwright and director Klim a few years back, he smiled and called him “an extraordinary figure” who had some very pessimistic opinions about the future of politics in Ukraine. “He expects to see a war, a bloodbath” between the two political factions in that country, Sellar explained. “He is pessimistic about what can be done by artists in these circumstances.”\n\nTo hear these and other comments Tom Sellar made, watch the video of our chat above.\n\nTheater Plus blog No. 143. This was originally a video blog in which Annie Baker talked about her play “The Aliens” and her experience seeing it come to life in Russia thanks to, among many others, Mikhail Durnenkov for his excellent translation. I’ve forgotten now how long it lasted, maybe a year. But one day I received an email from Annie. In it she asked me to take the video down from YouTube. It turns out that an interviewer from the New York Times had watched it before meeting with her and referred to it. She didn’t like that. Of course I removed the video from public access as per the writer’s wishes. The written word, however, is indelible. So, the little that follows is what is left of that chat I had with Annie. I took the photo above of Annie and Mikhail on the Arbat. The photo of the two below was taken at the Playwright and Director Center in Moscow. Both were snapped at the end of November 2011.\n\n28 November 2011\n\nBy John Freedman\n\n“It was one of the stranger, more wonderful experiences of my life, seeing my play read in Russian,” Annie Baker told me in St. Petersburg on Saturday evening.\n\nShe was talking about her play “The Aliens,” which originally opened at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in New York in 2010, but has been presented in staged readings in Russian in Omsk, Moscow and St. Petersburg over the course of the last month.\n\n(For the purposes of full disclosure, I state here that I am one of the organizers of the New American Plays for Russia project, through which Baker’s and six other American plays have been translated, adapted and presented in Russia under a grant from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow under the aegis of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission.)\n\nBaker, who is considered one of the most promising young playwrights in American theater, made the trip to Russia to see the readings in Moscow and St. Petersburg. I cornered her in a well-lighted, but chaotic rehearsal space at St. Petersburg’s hottest new venue, On.Teatr, and asked her to tell me a bit about the experience.\n\nShe said she was “taken aback” by the fact that people she “doesn’t know in a foreign country” have become so deeply interested in her work. Indeed, her public appearances — including question and answer sessions following readings — have drawn full houses and enthusiastic audiences. Following the reading in Moscow one spectator proclaimed Annie the “American Chekhov.”\n\nOne of the reasons that her play touched Russian audiences so deeply is that it was adapted by Mikhail Durnenkov, one of the top figures in the so-called New Russian drama movement. Working from a literal translation created by Yekaterina Raikova, Durnenkov spent several months fine-tuning the Russian text in ways that made it more accessible to Russians through its lexicon, intonations and sensibilities.\n\n“Durnenkov and I were weirdly simpatico,” Baker says with a smile. She added that in him she felt she had “met the Russian male version of myself.”\n\nShe was also moved and amused by the way that Durnenkov squirmed and suffered his way through the Moscow reading alongside her. “I felt as though he had written the play as much as I had,” she declared.\n\nIn Moscow, Baker also found time to attend three local productions — Yury Butusov’s staging of “The Seagull” at the Satirikon, Kama Ginkas’s “Rothschild’s Fiddle” at the Theater Yunogo Zritelya, and Marat Gatsalov and Mikhail Ugarov’s production of Pavel Pryazhko’s “Life Is Grand” at Teatr.doc. She was impressed by the variety of the shows — Butusov knocking her out by taking the stage himself to dance during act breaks and scene transitions, Ginkas with his “beautiful, mournful production,” and the cast of “Life Is Grand” showing her “some of the best acting I have seen in a long time.”\n\n“I am determined to get someone to bring this show to New York,” she said.\n\nBaker’s next project in New York is an adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya.” She has already completed the writing, but while in Moscow she spent time hunting for appropriate costumes for the future show.\n\nTo hear Annie talk in detail about these topics and more, click on the image above.\n\nTheater Plus blog No. 100. This is a companion piece to No. 99, another attempt at using a list to draw a picture. As I look back, this is a bit quirkier than my list of the 15 best plays that appeared from 2001 to 2010, but I do see in it a likeness of the vibrant, varied era that I traversed together with my Moscow colleagues in the first decade of the current millennium. The photo above shows a scene from Sergei Zhenovach’s production of “The River Potudan” at the Studio of Theater Art.\n\n16 January 2011\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nYou think it’s too late for one more New Year’s list? Then you don’t live in Russia, like I do.\n\nWe just celebrated Old New Year on Friday. This is the New Year that would have been if the Soviet government had not decided to join the same calendar as the rest of the world in 1918. It’s the New Year that the Russian Orthodox Church continues to observe to this day.\n\nIn short, the New Year’s tree is still up. My friends and colleagues are only now just coming out of hibernation. And I’m making a new list to join the one I put together last week of the 15 new plays I consider the most important of the last decade.\n\nToday we’re talking directors and their productions. And this one is much harder. I’m already in conflict with myself, wondering why I picked “this” and not “that.”\n\nA few rules and explanations. Unlike last week’s play list, this list of productions concerns only Moscow. By and large I did not include new plays in this list – they got their due last week. I did not include single directors multiple times, thus leaving out some masterful shows that were more accomplished than some I did include.\n\nBut my point in this list is less to create a primer to perfection, which doesn’t exist anyway, than it is to create a picture of a decade.\n\nPlasticene (2001) directed by Kirill Serebrennikov at the Playwright and Director Center. First on my list and I’m already violating my rule excluding contemporary plays. But this production of Vasily Sigarev’s tale of a young man pitted against the world was epoch-defining. It is the play that kicked off the term “new drama” in earnest, served as the Moscow debut for a major new director, and solidified the position of a theater as the most forward-looking of the new century.\n\nRain After the Deluge (2001) directed by Tonino Guerra and created by Ilya Epelbaum at the Ten Theater. This was the second entry in Epelbaum’s ambitious project named the Lilikan Museum of Theatrical Ideas – 15-minute productions created by some of the most famous people in the theater world. Before the talk about global warming really heated up, Guerra, the great screenwriter for Fellini, Antonioni and Tarkovsky, imagined an entire planet deluged beneath the waves of a marauding sea. Epelbaum, using his usual tools of smoke, mirrors, glue, glass, gauze and shadows, gave Guerra’s idea extraordinary expression in the tiny confines of the Lilikan Theater – a little box of maybe three square meters.\n\nPolyphony of the World (2001) composed by Alexander Bakshi and directed by Kama Ginkas for the Chekhov International Theater Festival. This astonishing work of music and theater remains one of the single greatest productions I have ever witnessed. It told the story of the birth of the universe, segueing into the maturation and death of a single man. It played just twice, in part because it proved too difficult to bring the enormous international cast of 100 together again. Ginkas continued to hit gold throughout the decade with such stunning productions as “The Lady With the Lapdog” and “Rothschild’s Fiddle” at the Theater Yunogo Zritelya, but I can only describe “Polyphony of the World” with the word “masterpiece.” That goes for the director and the composer.\n\nAcademy of Laughter (2001) directed by Roman Kozak at the Pushkin Theater. This funny, fast-paced play by Japanese author Koki Mitani hit like a display of fireworks when it opened. Kozak had just taken over the moribund Pushkin Theater and he showed he was not going to give in to widely shared superstitions that the theater was jinxed. “Academy of Laughter” was a critical and popular success and, indeed, it revived the theater almost instantly, bringing in audiences and critics who had forgotten the path to this theater years ago.\n\nThe School of Fools (2003) directed by Nikolai Roshchin for the ARTO Theater and the Meyerhold Center. Imagine a huge three meter-high schooner “floating” up to the front row in a theater and then suddenly a wild crowd of characters escaping from below deck as if straight from the paintings of Breughel and Bosch. That was just the first few minutes of this amazing three-hour extravaganza that was a challenging mix of physical, musical, poetic and even puppet and shadow theater. I’m not sure anybody really knew what this show was about – there were hints that it contained a kind of Faust-Mephistopheles narrative line – although “meaning” wasn’t the meaning of this thrilling, provocative and unforgettable piece of theater. Experiencing the unknown and the unexpected was.\n\nRichard III (2004) directed by Yury Butusov at the Satirikon Theater. Butusov staged several brilliant shows at the Satirikon over the last decade, and actor Konstantin Raikin put on numerous great performances. But if I flinch and ignore their collaboration on “King Lear,” this comic-book version of the bloody Shakespearean tragedy was the most memorable of all.\n\nThe Tale of an Upright Man (2004) directed by Boris Yukhananov for the Laboratory of Angelic Directing and the School of Dramatic Art. This was pure theatrical magic. Yukhananov combined dance, philosophy, video art, an author composing texts onstage in real time, children’s toys and a bit of Stanislavskian realism to create a show that I have always had difficulty describing and have not been able to forget. This beautiful, inspiring work about – what? – about an artist being true to himself, continues to inspire me today even though the show has not been performed for years.\n\nThree Sisters (2004) directed by Pyotr Fomenko for the Fomenko Studio. There is very little that is joyous in this, Anton Chekhov’s play about smart and sensitive people whose lives are extinguished amidst the tedium of everyday life. But Fomenko brought to it a sense of regal, high tragedy that I don’t believe I had ever seen in it.\n\nThe Stone Guest, Or Don Juan is Dead (2006) directed by Anatoly Vasilyev at the School of Dramatic Art. This show was staged just as the official campaign to oust Vasilyev from the theater he founded was getting underway. And he put everything that he was experiencing into this powerful, visually stunning work based, in part, on a short play by Alexander Pushkin. As I predicted would happen in my review at the time, Vasilyev did lose the battle with the city fathers who wanted him gone. But art is greater than politics. Some of those city fathers – former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, for instance – are now gone, but I still remember Vasilyev’s “Stone Guest” as though it played last night.\n\nI Am the Machine Gunner (2007) directed by Irina Keruchenko for the Playwright and Director Center. This play was hardly more than a year old when Keruchenko, a graduate of Kama Ginkas’s directing class at the Moscow Art Theater, unveiled her stunning production. It not only established Keruchenko as a hot new director, it raised the status of this play that has now become something of a modern classic.\n\nGogol Evenings: Part I (2007) directed by Vladimir Pankov for the SounDrama Studio. Pankov is a prolific director and composer and I can imagine a couple of his productions being in this list. But for me it was this, the first in a trilogy of Gogol prose adaptations that worked with astonishing precision, clarity and vision. The integral, organic way that Pankov weaves drama and music together was perfect for this folkloric tale of love, mystery, magic and mayhem set in old Ukraine.\n\nCarmen: The Outcome (2007) directed by Andrii Zholdak for the Theater of Nations. This director from Ukraine came to Moscow once every few years throughout the last decade and set theatrical houses on fire. I have loved all of his iconoclastic shows – including “Phaedra: Golden Braid” and “Moscow: Psycho,” but I thought “Carmen” was the piece de resistance. Using rock music, several screens projecting images of live video feed, and numerous stage platforms positioned in various places around the large stage, this sweeping tale of a woman scorned took no prisoners. For added fun, I happened to attend the premiere at which dozens of spectators stomped out demonstratively, angry that they had not received what they expected when they bought tickets. Personally, there are few things I love more in theater than when a director tosses things at me I don’t expect. I think that’s the epitome of great art.\n\nThe Marriage (2007) directed by Mark Zakharov at the Lenkom Theater. In an age of throwaway commercial theater featuring casts of stars to haul in audiences, no matter how grizzly the production on stage, this version of “The Marriage” was nothing less than heroic. It starred almost all the great actors at the star-heavy Lenkom – including the great Oleg Yankovsky in his final role – and it was just crushingly good. I rather imagine this is what theater was like in the 19th century, when the acting was so superb you didn’t even need a director. That is no slight on Zakharov – on the contrary, because his work here was to make it look like the actors just got together to goof off and have fun. And he did it brilliantly.\n\nOpus No. 7 (2008) directed by Dmitry Krymov at the School of Dramatic Art. This director probably defined theatrical experiment better than any other in the second half of the decade. In shows like “Auction,” “The Demon: The View from Above,” “The Cow” and “Tararabumbia” he constantly found new ways to put together the same old ingredients theater has been using for millenniums – well, at least centuries. But it was “Opus No. 7,” incorporating music by Alexander Bakshi and Dmitry Shostakovich to tell tales of tyranny and survival, that stripped the top of my head off as I watched it.\n\nThe River Potudan (2009) directed by Sergei Zhenovach at the Studio of Theater Art. Ask others in Moscow and you’ll probably get five or six different answers as to Zhenovach’s best production at his relatively new theater. But this is the one that, for me, brought his style and sensibility together like no other. This show about a young man and woman who loved each other but had no idea what to do with that love was delicate, tender and bluntly honest at every turn.\n\nTheater Plus No. 24. Another of my video blogs. Everybody knows that New York was so nice they had to name it twice. Well, Heidi Schreck is a well-known actress from New York and I could only do justice to her stories of encountering Moscow theater by putting up two videos. They offer a great look of Moscow theater ca. 2009 from a visitor’s point of view.\n\n01 June 2009\n\nBy John Freedman\n\nHeidi Schreck is an American actress and playwright who is originally from the state of Washington but has been based in New York City since 2003. She won a prestigious OBIE award in 2008 for her performance in “Drum of the Waves of Horikawa,” after which one New York blogger called her “God’s gift to audience members everywhere.” This year she received a Page 73 playwriting grant, in connection with which she spent a week in Moscow doing research at the end of May. Heidi spent a year teaching English in Siberia in the mid-1990s and, before resuming her acting career in the U.S., spent two years working as a journalist in St. Petersburg. It’s that experience in Russia that she plans on using as material for a play. For the record, Heidi is also the sister of Carl Schreck, a former editor of The Moscow Times, although we won’t hold that against her.\n\nWhile conducting interviews and doing research around Moscow, Heidi found time to check out a number of shows. I cornered her in a cafe with my trusty digital camera and coerced her into spilling the beans. So, what did she think? Her answers, taped in two video segments, can be watched below.\n\nIn the first, Heidi talks about how she ended up at Dmitry Krymov’s production of “Auction” at the School of Dramatic Art almost by accident. At the time, the actress didn’t even realize that her antenna for talent had led her to a show by one of the most interesting directors to emerge in town over the last decade. Heidi then launches into an impassioned description of Yury Butusov’s production of Eugene Ionesco’s “Macbett” at Konstantin Raikin’s Satirikon Theater — so impassioned, in fact, that she actually runs out of words to describe her impressions. I pushed “stop,” Heidi took a breath, and we picked up where we left off in a second take.\n\nAlthough the elaborate stagecraft of “Macbett” sometimes “got in the way of the narrative” for her, Heidi said this show was “a constant progression of surprises,” and she declared one of the scenes of Grigory Siyatvinda playing Macbett “one of the most beautiful things I think I’ve seen.”\n\nAnother show that caught Heidi’s eye was Valery Fokin’s dramatization of Nikolai Gogol’s “The Overcoat” for the Sovremennik Theater. She was taken with the work of composer Alexander Bakshi and designer Ilya Epelbaum, who created the impressive shadow scenes. But her highest praise was saved for Marina Neyolova, the actress who plays the nondescript clerk Akaky Akakievich. “You could see her thinking, which is an amazing quality in an actor,” Heidi said of Neyolova.\n\nClick the images below to watch the videos.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EreUBfY12Sw\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tuh8a5lXC0&feature=related"
