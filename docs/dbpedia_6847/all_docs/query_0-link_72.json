        "text": "Yes, but is it sport?\n\nArt is what ballet is about, and yet the talk this time of year is increasingly of medals, gold and otherwise. Even during the recent Prix de Lausanne, celebrating its 20th anniversary as a prestigious Swiss ballet competition in which young talent is fostered rather than exploited, the dominant images were tinged with Olympics-style hopes, both realized and dashed.\n\nA tall, lanky Russian, who had been eliminated by the 11-member jury before the semifinals, sat dejected at the end of a row of seats in a darkened theater. In contrast, 17-year-old twin brothers from Czechoslovakia were elated; after a poor showing in 1991, they had competition-hopped around the world, improved their technique and learned enough about impressing a jury to win two cash prizes in Lausanne.\n\nThe jury's top choice, a 16-year-old French student named Laetitia Pujol, could not repress a cry of \"C'est super!\" in perfect Franglais after Princess Caroline of Monaco congratulated her with an on-stage kiss. But there was also a group of Japanese boys and girls, their expectations unmet, who could not stem a flow of tears at the post-gala dinner.\n\nThe verdict is still out on the value of major international ballet competitions, which now extend from Tokyo to Moscow to Jackson, Miss. At their best, these events offer young dancers recognition, scholarships and a public showcase, and even serve as a springboard at the start of a career.\n\nYet competition fever can also breed the facile dancer, the equivalent of the anonymous virtuoso of piano competitions. At Lausanne, most contestants tried to compensate for generally lackluster performances of the required classical solos with a showy number in the contemporary or \"free\" category.\n\nThe greater danger is that the entire agglomerate of competitions is becoming one vast audition and marketing device for dancers and organizers. Cities court the prestige that comes with international contests; teachers and schools with pupils who excel seek the limelight. Young dancers at the brink of their career compete with the intention of parlaying their performances into contracts with company directors.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
