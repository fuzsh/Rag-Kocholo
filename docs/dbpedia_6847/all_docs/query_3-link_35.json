        "text": "Peter Tchaikovsky’s famous, fairy-tale ballet, The Nutcracker, is coming to a local venue. The performances, sponsored by the Philadelphia-based International Ballet Exchange (IBE), are scheduled for December 20 and 21, 2014 at Plymouth/Whitemarsh High School, by the much acclaimed dance company, the Donetsk Ballet of Ukraine. The company is on tour in the USA despite a raging civil war in their city and country.\n\nSince 1989, the Donetsk Ballet has been touring the world: Italy, Spain, Norway, France, China, Japan, and cities throughout the United States. In 2012, the company spent three months touring France with their production of Swan Lake. In 2013 they toured Western Europe with their production of Romeo and Juliet. Everywhere they have been recognized for their technique and artistry. The power of the male dancers and the delicacy of the ballerinas in splendidly choreographed staging leave audiences exhilarated. Eighteen members of the company touring the USA, led by artistic director Vadim Pisarev, brings that expertise to such roles as the Sugar Plum Fairy, the Mouse King and, of course, the Nutcracker.\n\nInternationally renowned principal dancer, Irina Komarenko will be dancing the lead role for the company as well as Yeltsaveta Barkalova, an up and coming star. Irina Komarenko was a finalist in the 1998 USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson and in 2000 she received an award for being the best non-competing partner at Varna’s International Ballet Competition in Bulgaria. Taking the parts as the children in the production are 50 local ballet students, two of whom have won the coveted roles of Clara and Fritz, the children in the story whose lives are touched by a magical nutcracker.\n\nTchaikovsky’s music, the delightful story, and the talent of the dancers come together for an unforgettable experience for young and old. The two performances, 6:30 pm on Saturday, December 20, and 2 pm on Sunday December 21, will be presented at Plymouth/Whitemarsh High School, located at 201 East Germantown Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462. Ticket prices are $18 for students and seniors and $28 for adults. For online ticket sales go to http://ibexchange.ticketleap.com. Tickets can also be purchased at the door. For information, call 215-849-7950 or 1-800-849-4919. Group rates are available.\n\nThe performances are sponsored by the International Ballet Exchange (IBE). IBE is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing high-quality ballet education, performance opportunities, and cross-cultural exposure to young aspiring ballet dancers. IBE will also present The Nutcracker at reduced rates for school children throughout the city at George Washington High School Thursday, December 18, at 10:15 am.\n\nThis project is supported by the Philadelphia Cultural Fund and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, a state agency, through its regional arts funding partnership, Pennsylvania Partners in the Arts (PPA). State government funding comes through an annual appropriation by Pennsylvania’s General Assembly and from the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal agency. PPA is administered locally by the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance."
