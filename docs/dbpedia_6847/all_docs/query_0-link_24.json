        "text": "The music of Tchaiskovsky filled the Washington Township Center of the Performing Arts as two performances of the Nutcracker were given last week by the Donetsk Ballet Company of the Ukraine.\n\nWith help from local children, the group brought the holiday classic to life.\n\n“There were 55 children from this general area that were in the cast of this ballet,” said Fern K. Helfond, director of the L’Ecole de la Dance, co-sponsor of the production. “Fifteen of the children are from Washington Township. This show gives local children an opportunity to perform with an internationally famous dance company.\n\n“It is an excellent chance for young dancers to learn from professional dancers,” said Helfond.\n\nThe Donetsk Ballet Company has trained children in Italy, Norway and many other European countries as well as across the United States.\n\n“We had a matinee performance on Monday,” said Helfond. “There were 2300 students from Washington Township Schools along with 16 special education students who enjoyed the free performance.”\n\nVadim Pisarev, who portrayed the Nutcracker Prince, was trained at the Kiev Academy and has won many awards, including first prize in the International Ballet competition held in Jackson, Mississippi in 1986.\n\nPisarev won a Male Dancer of the Year award in 1990 and is considered by many to be the next ballet superstar.\n\nHis abilities have earned him a growing fan base in the former Soviet Union, Europe and North America.\n\nInna Dorafeyeva, a 1983 graduate of the Kiev Choreographic School, portrayed Maria, princess of the Nutcracker.\n\nShe became a member of the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre soon after and is now the prima ballerina.\n\nDorafeyeva has performed in France, South Korea, Poland, India, Sweden and the United States.\n\nShe has danced the lead in Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty and won a gold medal at first Ukraine Ballet Competition.\n\nViktor Yeliohin, choreographer for this production of the Nutcracker, has danced soloist roles with the Donetsk Ballet, including Don Quixote, Sleeping Beauty, Giselle and La Bayadere.\n\nYeliohin served as a choreographer for Olympic men’s gymnastic teams from 1982 to 1986.\n\nHe has continued his career as a choreographer and instructor throughout the United States and since 1992, has served as choreographer for the children for the Donetsk Ballet Company during their annual Nutcracker tour.\n\nThe Nutcracker was first performed at the Maryinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia on December 17, 1892.\n\nIn the years since, the popularity of the ballet has grown throughout the world and is performed by countless dance companies each holiday season.\n\nThe Nutcracker tells the story of a young girl named Clara who receives a nutcracker doll as a Christmas gift.\n\nHer brother breaks the doll, and Clara has a dream that the doll as come to life and is being chased by the Mouse King, the leader of the evil Mice People.\n\nThe Mice People steal the doll, but Clara’s other dolls come to life and rescue the nutcracker.\n\nA grand celebration follows to cap the story."
