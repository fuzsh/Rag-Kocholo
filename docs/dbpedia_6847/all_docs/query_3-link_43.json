        "text": "The Dance World Will Come to Jackson, Mississippi, in 2023\n\nThe USA International Ballet Competition (USA IBC) will take the stage in Jackson, Mississippi, June 10-24, 2023. More than 100 dancers from around the world will\n\ncompete in Jackson for the 12th time on the stage at Thalia Mara Hall. The USA IBC is among the oldest and most prestigious international ballet competitions in the world.\n\nThe USA IBC competition was originally scheduled for June of 2022, but was rescheduled for 2023 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted 2020 competitions planned for Helsinki, Finland, and Varna, Bulgaria.\n\n“USA IBC leaders worked with our sister competitions in three countries to develop new, coordinated schedules and ensure that despite the pandemic, dancers who had trained for years would still be able to compete and the world would still have the opportunity to come together for these celebrations of art and athleticism,” said Mona Nicholas, USA IBC executive director.\n\nThe forced postponements of the 2020 competitions would have moved their new dates to within months of the 2022 Jackson competition. Having three major competitions within two months would have negatively impacted all three of the IBCs. The pool of competing dancers would have been diluted and ticket sales would have suffered; the sister competitions would have essentially been competing with each other.\n\nInstead, the four competitions came together to work out a solution. USA IBC led the way by volunteering to reschedule its competition until 2023.\n\n“Our partners in Varna, Moscow, and Helsinki shared our belief that we should work together to make the competitions accessible to as many gifted dancers and as many\n\nglobal audience members as possible,” Nicholas said. “The pandemic affected the entire world, with countries closing borders and the arts temporarily dark. Now more than ever, the people of the world need art. We need events that unify us and remind us there is still beauty in the world. These competitions do just that.”\n\nFor more information about USA IBC or becoming a sponsor, visit usaibc.com or contact Mona Nicholas at mnicholas@usaibc.com or call 601-355-9853 x 4.\n\nNew Competition Schedule\n\n2021 Moscow\n\n2022 Helsinki and Varna\n\n2023 Jackson\n\n2024 Varna\n\n2025 Moscow\n\n2026 Helsinki and Varna\n\n2027 Jackson\n\n2028 Varna\n\nImpact of USA IBC in Mississippi in 2018, the most recent competition year\n\nTotal Economic impact of $12.5 million\n\nThe event generated in-state spending of more than $9.3 million, a payroll impact of more than $2.8 million and contributed $416,491 to the state general fund through tax\n\nrevenues, for a combined economic impact approaching $12.5 million.\n\nAdditionally, there were:\n\n40,400 attendees during the two-week competition and related events;\n\nTicket holders from 35 states and 25 countries;\n\n400 million media impressions worldwide;\n\n100 competing dancers from 17 nations;\n\n92 dance students from 17 states and three countries; and\n\n600 volunteers.\n\nHISTORY OF THE IBCS\n\nUSA IBC / Jackson\n\nThe dance world comes to Jackson because legendary dancer and instructor Thalia Mara (1911-2003) brought it here. In 1975, the Jackson Ballet Guild invited Mara, who was then living and working in New York, to develop a professional ballet company and school for the state of Mississippi. As part of her developmental plan, Mara worked with city leaders to secure the USA IBC for the city of Jackson.\n\nThe first USA IBC was held in 1979, featuring 70 dancers from 15 countries. Robert Joffrey, renowned artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, chaired the first international panel of jurors. In 1982, the United States Congress passed a Joint Resolution designating Jackson the official home of the International Ballet Competition.\n\nSubsequent competitions have earned an ever-growing number of dancer applications and worldwide acclaim. Over the competition’s 40-plus-year history, many USA IBC\n\nmedalists have gone on to dance as principals in major international companies. The storied careers of Grand Prix Winners Nina Ananiashvili, Andris Liepa, Johan Kobborg,\n\nand José Manuel Carreño were launched in Jackson. USA IBC alumni, including Jeffrey Cirio, Sarah Lane, Christine Shevchenko, Daniil Simkin, Misa Kuranaga, Isaac\n\nHernandez, and Jurgita Dronina, are helping to shape the ballet world today.\n\nVarna IBC\n\nEstablished in 1964, Varna IBC is the oldest event of its kind in the world. As a pioneer of the International Ballet Competitions movement, Varna IBC has set the highest\n\nprofessional standards, and was later followed by the establishment of similar competitions in Moscow, Jackson, Helsinki, Lausanne, New York, Perm, Seoul,\n\nShanghai, and other locations.\n\nFor over half a century, Varna IBC has discovered and nurtured such legendary dancers as Mikhail Baryshnikov, Vladimir Vasiliev, Natalia Makarova, Maximiliano Guerra,\n\nAurelie Dupont, Vladimir Malakhov, Sylvie Guillem and Patrick Dupond. Some of the laureates have joined the Varna IBC’s prestigious jury, alongside Galina Ulanova, Yuri\n\nGrigorovich, Serge Lifar, Alicia Alonso, and Robert Joffrey.\n\nMoscow IBC\n\nThe Moscow IBC was established in 1969 and has been celebrated ever since as one of the world’s most important and prestigious ballet competitions. Staged at the world-famous Bolshoi Theater, Moscow IBC is recognized as a serious platform for young dancers. Legendary choreographer Yuri Grigorovich has served as the permanent chairman of the jury and artistic director of the competition since 1973.\n\nHelsinki IBC\n\nThe Helsinki International Ballet Competition was founded by Professor Doris Laine-Almi, a former prima ballerina and director of the Finnish National Ballet. Professor Laine-Almi was inspired to found the Helsinki event after serving on the juries of international ballet competitions in Jackson, Moscow, and Varna. The first Helsinki IBC\n\ntook place in 1984. The home of the HIBC is the Finnish National Opera and Ballet.\n\nJackson, Varna, Moscow, and Helsinki are members of the International Federation of Ballet Competitions (IFBC), an organization founded in 2005 to coordinate international competitive activities and help young dancers develop their careers. IFBC includes 18 international ballet competitions.\n\nThe USA International Ballet Competition has been awarded a $26,100 grant from the Mississippi Arts Commission (MAC). This grant is a portion of the $1.3 million in grants the Commission will award in 2018-2019 and will help the USA IBC fund operations and programming. The grants are made possible by continued funding from the Mississippi Legislature and the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n“Arts organizations throughout the state of Mississippi play a pivotal role in sharing the power of the arts with people from all walks of life,” said Malcolm White, executive director of MAC. “The arts are for everyone, and the Mississippi Arts Commission is pleased to support arts organizations committed to growing the presence of the arts in their communities.”\n\nThe USA IBC is the official international ballet competition for the United States, as designated by a Joint Resolution of Congress. Held in Jackson every four years, the competition attracts dancers and visitors from around the world and generates a multi-million-dollar economic impact for the state and capital city. In between competitions, the USA IBC presents a Reunion Gala performance by past medalists. It also sponsors CityDance, an ongoing ballet instructional program for students in the Jackson Public Schools.\n\nThe Mississippi Arts Commission, a state agency, serves residents by providing grants that support programs to enhance communities; assist artists and arts organizations; promote the arts in education; and celebrate Mississippi’s cultural heritage. Established in 1968, the Mississippi Arts Commission is funded by the Mississippi Legislature, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mississippi Endowment for the Arts at the Community Foundation of Greater Jackson and other private sources. The agency serves as an active supporter and promoter of arts in community life and in arts education.\n\nFor information from the Mississippi Arts Commission, contact Anna Ehrgott, Communications Director, 601-359-6546 or aehrgott@arts.ms.gov.\n\nRobert Joffrey, co-founder of The Joffrey Ballet, is being remembered at the 2018 USA International Ballet Competition. Joffrey was instrumental in the launch of the first IBC in Jackson in 1979 and chaired the juries for the first three Jackson competitions.\n\nRepresentatives of the Gerald Arpino and Robert Joffrey Foundation will present a panel discussion on Joffrey at 10 a.m. Monday, June 18, in the 3rd Floor Theatre of the Jackson Convention Complex. Speakers include Charthel Estner, Trinette Singleton, and Nicole Duffy Robertson.
