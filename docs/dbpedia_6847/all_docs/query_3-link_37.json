        "text": "“Nutcracker! Magical Christmas Ballet,” celebrates its 31st year and returns to the State Theatre for the Arts, Easton, on Nov. 25.\n\nPresented by Talmi Entertainment, this beloved holiday tradition highlights skilled dancers from around the world, including Ukraine, Japan, Italy, Russia, Poland and Germany.\n\nAveraging 100 performances in November and December, the visually-stunning production boasts dazzling costumes, magnificent choreography, hand-painted scenery and 10-foot-tall puppets.\n\nIn a phone interview with soloist and audition director, Anna Trofimova, she says she’s been involved with the production since 2015.\n\n“I play Clara’s mom. I usually [perform] this role because it’s very special to me. It was the first part that I got when I joined the company.”\n\nShe also performs in the Snowflake scene, and the Act II variation.\n\nUkrainian-born Trofimova was invited to study at the Vadim Pisarev School of Choreographic Mastery at the age of eight. She was accepted at the Ukrainian National University of Culture and Arts in 2012 and 2014, and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree.\n\nShe has since performed at the Donetsk National Opera House, and more recently at the Kharkov National Opera House. She was a dancer with the Ukrainian Ballet Theatre, a teacher at the Lvov Ballet School, and an instructor at the summer choreographic camp “Ballet-Dance” Her extensive repertoire includes “Swan Lake,” “Giselle,” “Sleeping Beauty,” “Don Quixote,” “Romeo and Juliet” and “Cinderella.”\n\nThis “Nutcracker” production is comprised of two companies, performing in the eastern and western United States, with 40 members in each cast.\n\nThe ballet is based on the libretto “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,” with the score written by renowned composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. It premiered in December 1892 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The story has had several creative variations over the past 100 years but has endured as a consummate symbol of the Christmas season.\n\nCharacters such as young Clara, her brother Fritz, Herr Drosselmeyer, the Mouse King, the Nutcracker Prince and Snow Maidens represent their country’s gifts. Talmi’s production includes the “Dove of Peace,” with two dancers balancing on one another to form a beautiful soaring bird with a 20-foot wingspan.\n\nTrofimova describes her favorite scene: “My special love is the Snow adagio performed by the Nutcracker and Clara. I fell in love with this music. I can’t explain why. It just has a special place in my heart.”\n\nThe role of Clara is shared by four principal dancers, from Ukraine and Japan. This year, the show introduces fresh characters and integrates new choreography that blends classical ballet with new techniques. Arthur Oliver, an internationally-recognized designer, has created costumes for “Nutcracker!” for more than 30 years.\n\nTrofimova arrived in the Lehigh Valley two months in advance to train student ballet dancers who were chosen to perform in “Nutcracker!,” through the “Dance with Us Program.” More than 20 students from the Pennsylvania Classical Ballet Company, Northampton, will perform with the professional cast, giving the young dancers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\n“I’m so excited to have this opportunity with American students during the tour,” says Trofimova. “It’s very special for them, sharing the stage with professionals, and very special for us to have this chance to spend time, get them ready, see them on stage, and see how happy they are.”\n\nThe production strives for community engagement by hosting Creative Development Residencies, interactive workshops via New Horizons: A Children’s Program for Life, and providing opportunities for local pre-professional musicians to accompany principal dancers through the Musical Wunderkind Program.\n\n“When we have the chance, we also are happy to meet Girl Scout groups,” says Trofimova. “Spending time with them, exploring American culture and telling them about our culture. I am Ukrainian and so happy to share a piece of my culture with them. After the shows, we usually do question and answer sessions and take a picture together.”\n\nThe “Nutcracker” ballet remains a timeless holiday experience, delighting audiences across all cultures and age groups.\n\n“The classics never die,” says Trofimova. “Each person can find something different in [‘Nutcracker’], not dependent on the changing generations.”\n\nThe production also promotes a sincere message.\n\n“The second act of the show takes place in the Land of Peace and Harmony, instead of the Land of Sweets, which speaks to the message of our production. It communicates a message of peace,” says Trofimova.\n\n“Don’t miss a chance to see our 2023 principal dancers from Ukraine and other renowned companies,” Trofimova says."
