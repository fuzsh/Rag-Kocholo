Malawi is a country in southeastern Africa with a 350-mile-long lake that contains more species of fish than any other lake in the world. Its people are from many different ethnic groups and are known for their friendliness to strangers, giving the country the nickname, “The Warm Heart of Africa.” Samaritan’s Purse began distributing gift-filled shoeboxes there in 2000 and launched The Greatest Journey, our follow-up discipleship program, in this nation in 2010.

Pray for Your Shoebox Recipient

“Whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”—Matthew 21:22

Please don’t stop praying for the boy or girl that you first lifted up when you packed your shoebox. Continue to ask God to soften his or her heart to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, so that he or she will follow Him all the days of their life. Pray also for families and entire communities to be transformed as God’s love is shared through your simple gift.

The Greatest Journey

After your shoebox gift delights a boy or girl, you can give them the opportunity to participate in The Greatest Journey.

Taught by trained local teachers, this 12-lesson discipleship program shows children how to follow Christ and share Him with others. As boys and girls share the Scripture stories they learn in class, their friends and family come to faith—growing churches, starting new congregations, and transforming communities by the power of the Gospel.
