        "text": "Dalia Soda is one of only three female pump mechanics in Salima District. Highly respected by co-workers and communities alike, she was already a keen volunteer in the region before she learnt her trade.\n\n“I knew Nzeremu Village before the borehole came,” Dalia explains. “I was encouraging people to contribute something towards it. They were collecting water from the lake.”\n\nAfter training from WaterAid, Dalia now keeps the boreholes in Nzeremu and several other villages working. The job has helped her build her own house and pay for all seven of her children’s school fees.\n\nLooking to the future, Dalia has started taking her 19-year-old son with her on jobs so that he can assist. One day, when she is too old to work, she hopes he can take over.\n\n“I'd be very happy if he wanted to be a pump mechanic. I know it would be of service to a lot of the people in the community.”"
