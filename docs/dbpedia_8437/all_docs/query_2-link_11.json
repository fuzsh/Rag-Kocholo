        "text": "Overview\n\nMalawi holds regular elections and has undergone multiple transfers of power between political parties. Political rights and civil liberties are largely respected by the state. However, corruption is rife, police brutality is common, and Malawians are in severe economic distress. Discrimination and violence toward women, members of minority groups, and people with albinism remain problems.\n\nOverview\n\nInternet freedom in Malawi improved during the coverage period. The government repealed a law that had criminalized insulting the president, fewer journalists were arrested in retaliation for their coverage of political leaders, and the countryâ€™s Anti-Corruption Bureau blocked the acquisition of a new system that could give the government greater access to data from telecommunications providers. Online news outlets have been subject to government manipulation through unofficial directives in recent years, though there were no reported cases of forced removal of content during the coverage period."
