From 1968 to 1994, Chewa was the only national language; it is now one of the numerous languages used in print and broadcast media and is spoken by a majority of the population.

It is urbanizing at a very rapid rate, however, with movement toward urban areas taking place at a pace far swifter than either the African or global averages.\n\nA rural village—called a mudzi—is usually small. Organized around the extended family, it is limited by the amount of water and arable land available in the vicinity. On the plateaus, which support the bulk of the population, the most common village sites are at the margins of madambo, which are usually contiguous with streams or rivers and are characterized by woodland, grassland, and fertile alluvial soils. In highland areas, scattered villages are located near perennial mountain streams and pockets of arable land. The larger settlements of the Lake Malawi littoral originated in the 19th century as collection points for slaves and later developed as lakeside ports. Improvements in communications and the sinking of wells in semiarid areas permitted the establishment of new settlements in previously uninhabited areas. Architecture is changing: the traditional round, mud-walled, grass-roofed hut is giving way to rectangular brick buildings with corrugated iron roofs.\n\nUrban development began in the colonial era with the arrival of missionaries, traders, and administrators and was further stimulated by the construction of the railway. Important urban centres include Blantyre, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Lilongwe. Although some district centres and missionary stations have an urban appearance, they are closely associated with the rural settlements surrounding them. Blantyre, Malawi’s industrial and commercial centre, is situated in a depression on the Shire Highlands at an elevation of about 3,400 feet (1,040 metres). Zomba, the capital of Malawi until 1975 and now the seat of the University of Malawi, lies at the foot of Zomba Mountain. Lilongwe, Malawi’s capital since 1975 and a centre of agricultural industry, is located in the central region. Mzuzu, long associated with the wood industry, is situated farther north on the Viphya highlands.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fishing\n\nAgricultural products constitute a large proportion of Malawian export revenue; the most important of these are tobacco, sugar, tea, and cotton. Tea is grown on plantations on the Shire Highlands; coffee is produced mostly in the Shire Highlands and in northern Malawi, especially in the northeastern Viphya Mountains, and near Rumphi and Misuku. Tobacco, by far the most important export, is raised largely on the central plateau on large estates and by smallholders in various parts of the country. With the rise of worldwide campaigns against smoking, however, farmers have been increasingly encouraged to diversify so as not to be wholly dependent on tobacco.\n\nCorn (maize) is the principal food crop and is typically grown with beans, peas, and peanuts (groundnuts) throughout the country by virtually all smallholders. Other important food crops include cassava (manioc), bananas, pulses, sweet potatoes, and rice; chickens, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats are raised.\n\nAlthough the major share of commercial crop production is on large estates, most farms are small, with the majority less than 2.5 acres (1 hectare) in size. Until the early 1990s, smallholder cash crops were purchased and marketed solely by the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), which also dominated the fertilizer business. Because ADMARC kept a high proportion of the profits, this arrangement was to the disadvantage of smallholders, whose conditions improved little. In 1987 the ADMARC monopoly over smallholder produce was ended. Through schemes such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Agricultural Sector Assistance Program, the government liberalized the production and marketing of smallholder tobacco. With greater control of their crop, growers’ income from tobacco sales was significantly increased.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the government sponsored the development of several large timber and pulpwood plantations aimed at making the country self-sufficient in construction grades of timber; pine and eucalyptus have also been planted extensively in the northern Viphya Mountains to supply a large pulp and paper project in the region. In spite of this, forest plantations account for only a fraction of the total Malawian forest cover.\n\nThe rapid rate at which wooded areas have been disappearing in Malawi is a source of grave concern. Between the early 1970s and the early ’90s, more than half of Malawi’s forested area was depleted, and, although the deforestation rate modestly decreased in the following decade, it nevertheless remained extremely high by relative standards. The use of wood as fuel is one major factor in the depletion of the country’s woodlands. In rural areas, wood has always been used to provide fuel for cooking, and, as the population grows, more of it is used; in the urban areas, charcoal is the main source of energy, adding more pressure on woodlands. The heavily dominant tobacco industry has resulted in further denudation of forests, as trees have been regularly felled both as timber for the construction of sheds to dry or cure the crop and to fuel the curing process itself. Another source of the problem is brick making, which relies heavily on firewood to fire the kilns. The reduction of casual labour and the number of civil service positions at the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank has meant forest reserves no longer have personnel to guard them from abuse.\n\nFishing is practiced for subsistence as well as by artisanal and commercial fisheries. The lakes and rivers of Malawi provide a diverse catch. Lake Malawi in particular is a rich source of fish within easy access for most of the country’s population and accounts for some three-fourths of the country’s catch. Other important sources include Lakes Chilwa, Malombe, and Chiuta and the Shire River. Although aquaculture is practiced, much of the country’s total catch is obtained by capture, with artisanal fisheries accounting for the greatest proportion of that take. Some fish are exported to neighbouring countries. Since the late 20th century the fish population has dwindled because of overfishing, the use of nets with a mesh size smaller than those recommended by fisheries experts, and the disregard of the ban on fishing in the breeding season. In response, natural resources committees have been formed in lakeshore communities to participate in the management of fisheries and the enforcement of fishing regulations."
