        "text": "The best time to visit Malawi is during the dry season from late April to October or November. For wildlife viewing, late in the dry season is best as this is when animals converge at water holes, although the afternoons can be long and hot. The scenery is at its best from May to July when the weather is also less oppressive, although nights can be chilly and local wildlife harder to spot. The wet season runs from December to March and, and while the weather can be quite unpredictable, the vegetation will be at its lushest.\n\nWith the third largest lake in Africa running almost the entire length of its eastern flank, visitors to Malawi often make a beeline to the idyllic shores of Lake Malawi and choose to explore no further. And, with pristine water that's ideal for all forms of water-based fun, it's easy to see why! But venture a little further afield and you'll discover much natural diversity and changing terrain of lush forests and game parks, rugged mountains and fertile plateaux.\n\n1. Waterside fun\n\nGo swimming or try your hand at some water sports on the vast expanse of Lake Malawi.\n\n2. Throw a line in\n\nExperience the daily routine of lake-dwelling fishermen firsthand by rising early to watch them fishing on the still lake at the break of day.\n\n3. On two feet or two wheels\n\nHike or cycle around the fishing villages that pepper the shoreline of this magnificent landscape.\n\n4. Underwater world\n\nStrap on a snorkel or join a scuba diving excursion to experience the abundant underwater world that thrives beneath the calm surface of the lake.\n\n5. Hit the streets\n\nExplore the bustling markets and city streets of the country's beating heart, Lilongwe."
