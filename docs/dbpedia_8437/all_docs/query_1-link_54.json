Since we’re at our best working with artists to produce really good music and organising tours, and at our worst trying to promote what we’re doing, I think this could be a game changer. The good people at QG will primarily help us spreading the word about Gasper Nali’s and Michael Mountain’s upcoming UK autumn tour and then who knows where it will take us?\n\nWe’re super excited to announce that Gasper Nali (MW) and Michael Mountain (MW) will do a joint autumn 2023 tour in the UK. So far 20 shows are booked in late September and October and more is on the way. Check dates and links to tickets below!\n\nGasper Nali is a roots one-man-band from the small town of Nkhata Bay on the shores of Lake Malawi. He plays a one-string home-made 3-metre long Babatoni bass guitar with a stick and an empty beer bottle, and together with a cow skin kick drum and catchy melodies, he creates the most amazing and danceable original Afro Beats possible!\n\nMichael Mountain is a reggae poet and small-scale farmer. The front porch of his small house in the remote village of Viboko is his favourite place, and from there he can clearly see life from a different point of view, and put his reflections into song.\n\nClick the venues to get your hands on tickets.\n\nSep 30 CHIDHAM, The Old Malthouse\n\nOct 1 BORNEMOUTH, Arts by the Sea\n\nOct 1 PORTSMOUTH, The Lens\n\nOct 4 CAMBOURNE, Cambourne Library\n\nOct 6 LONDON, Green Note\n\nOct 7 SUFFOLK, John Peel Centre\n\nOct 8 COLCHESTER, Colchester Arts\n\nOct 10 SETTLE, Victoria Hall\n\nOct 11 BURY, Bury Met\n\nOct 12 HEBDEN BRIDGE, Trades Club\n\nOct 13 NEWCASTLE, Star & Shadow Cinema\n\nOct 14 GLASGOW, Hug & Pint\n\nOct 18 BRIGHTON, The Rose Hill\n\nOct 19 MANCHESTER, The Vale\n\nOct 20 ISLE OF MAN, Centenary Arts\n\nOct 21 WHITBY, Musicport Festival\n\nOct 22 NORTHAMPTON, Garibaldi Hotel\n\nOct 25 LIVERPOOL, Philharmonic Hall\n\nOct 26 WESTON-SUPER-MARE, Loves Cafe\n\nOct 27 BRISTOL, Pangea @ Lost Horizon\n\nOct 28 ABERYSTWYTH, Art Centre\n\nGASPER NALI SUMMER TOUR\n\nUK July 2023\n\nGasper Nali is back with another UK festival tour in July 2023.

Singles, new album ‘Two Big Elephants’ out in 2023!\n\nMichael’s wonderful 2015 album ‘Nowhere Else To Go’ is finally back and available online (Spotify, iTunes etc etc) It was down for a while due to changing digital distributor and we also decided to take the opportunity to give it a bit of a re-master. The bulk of the album is recorded live in Nkhata Bay, Malawi, in 2014, and it’s a collection of absolutely beautiful songs of life and strife in rural Malawi. Favourite track: Working With My Tools.
