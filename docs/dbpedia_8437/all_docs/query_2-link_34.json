        "text": "Quick Facts\n\nMalawi people of Bantu origin are comprised of many different ethnic groups, contributing to its rich culture.\n\nThe official language in Malawi is English and Chewa.\n\nAround 70% of the population of Malawi live making under $1.90 a day.\n\nThe adult literacy rate in Malawi is 69.8% for men and 55.2% for women.\n\nIn general, young people between the ages of 13-24 have been affected by AIDS more than other groups. That is why many experts are calling for AIDS education in schools.\n\nMalawi has high dropout rates among students and especially among females, in particular, who are expected to work at home and provide for their family at a young age.\n\nThe people of Malawi have a rich history of traditional dance, mask carving and basketry.\n\nMalawi\n\n775 libraries established\n\nKnown as “The Warm Heart of Africa”, The Republic of Malawi is a landlocked country with a population of 18.7 million. The history of Malawi goes back to the 10th century when the area was first settled. Today, Malawi is one of Africa’s poorest and most densely populated nations. Malawi’s economy is based on agriculture. Maize (corn) is the country’s main staple food while tea, coffee, and sugar are some of its biggest exports.\n\nEducation in Malawi: School enrollment has historically been low. However, in 1994, free primary education for all children was introduced and enrollment in primary schools nearly tripled. Wungwero Book Foundation (WBF) initiated a partnership with the African Library Project in 2008. WBF was soon joined by DAPP Malawi, Malawi Institute of Education, and University of Malawi – Chancellor College Library . Together, the organizations evaluate and monitor the libraries in Malawi.\n\nLearn More About The Regions We Serve\n\nEast Africa\n\nSouthern Africa\n\nWest Africa\n\nKenya\n\nTo walk the land of Kenya is to walk the history of humankind. Did you know some of the earliest fossils of prehistoric humans have been discovered in Kenya? A former British colony, Kenya achieved independence in 1963. Since then, the country has seen vast economic growth both in agriculture and technology.\n\nLearn More\n\nUganda\n\nUganda, officially known as the Republic of Uganda, is one of the youngest countries on earth with half of its population under the age of 14. Although control of the country passed to the British Colonial Office in 1905, Uganda was never fully colonized.\n\nLearn More\n\nBotswana\n\nBotswana, a former British protectorate, gained independence in 1966. The country’s economy depended primarily on livestock until the 1970s when Botswana became a major exporter of diamonds. Currently, Botswana has one of the most successful economies and stable democracies in Africa.\n\nLearn More\n\nLesotho\n\nLesotho is a tiny country nestled in the middle of South Africa. Founded as a kingdom in the 1820s, Lesotho was a British protectorate for almost 100 years before regaining independence in 1966. Today, the country is one of the world’s smallest constitutional monarchies known for its beauty and unique culture. Since 2000, primary school education in Lesotho is free and as a result, enrollment has increased.\n\nLearn More\n\nMalawi\n\nKnown as “The Warm Heart of Africa”, The Republic of Malawi is a landlocked country with a population of 18.7 million.

It was the first sub-Saharan nation to achieve autonomy from colonial rule. Ghana was also the first place in sub-Saharan Africa where Europeans arrived to trade - first in gold, later in slaves. Archaeological evidence shows that humans have lived in present-day Ghana from about 1500 BC. Today, Ghana is a model of democracy for the continent and the world.\n\nLearn More\n\nSierra Leone\n\nAccording to archeological findings, people have been residing in the Sierra Leone for at least 2,500 years. In the sixteenth century Sierra Leone was a very important center for the transatlantic slave trade. However the country’s involvement with the slave trade ended in 1787 after Freetown was established by repatriated former slaves. Due to its rough beginnings, over 70% of the population in Sierra Leone lives under the poverty line.\n\nLearn More"
