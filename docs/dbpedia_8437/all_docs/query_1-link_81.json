They have competed in all Commonwealth Games since then. This narrow south-eastern African country, shaped by the dramatic Rift Valley, won a boxing bronze medal on its debut and returned to Scotland in 1986 to win two more boxing medals. In Glasgow in 2014 they took part in eight different sports.\n\nBased in the capital Lilongwe, the Malawi National Olympic Committee is responsible for the country's participation in the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games and was formally recognised in 1968."
