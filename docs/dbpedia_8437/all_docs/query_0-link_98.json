        "text": "The socio-economic landscape of Malawi presents a complex web of opportunities and challenges. The country is rich in potential, resources, culture, and human capital, yet its people have long grappled with poverty, unemployment, and limited access to basic services (World Bank, 2023; Chunga & Tsoka, 2022).\n\nExacerbated by the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and last year’s deadly Cyclone Freddy, the country’s economic woes are reflected in high inflation and shortages of petrol and foreign currency. The Malawian kwacha was devalued by 25% in May 2022 and again by 44% in November 2023. In November, President Lazarus Chakwera suspended all international travel for his government, including himself (Jegwa, 2023; Al Jazeera, 2022; World Bank, 2023; African Development Bank, 2023).\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (2023) has approved a U.S. $175 million loan that “aims to support the authorities’ commitment to restore macroeconomic stability, build a foundation for inclusive and sustainable growth, including to strengthen resilience to climate-related shocks, and address weaknesses in governance and institutions.”\n\nHow do ordinary Malawians assess their country’s persistent economic challenges?\n\nFindings from Afrobarometer’s 2022 survey show that citizens overwhelmingly see their government as failing on economic issues and believe that their country is going in the wrong direction. Few are optimistic that things will improve in the near future."
