        "meta_description": "Vibrant Stapler Obscures Characteristic Growth by Hastings Of Malawi, released 10 March 2015\n\n1. Pineapple Magnate\n2. Boeuf En Crut\n\nA classic masterpiece from 1981, never re-released before. Originally 1000 copies pressed on orange/red vinyl. 120 copies were sold through Rough Trade and Virgin Records. 800 copies were bought and later destroyed by the United Dairies label, makin this record even more rare. \r\n\r\n\r\nHastings of Malawi were Heman Pathak, David Hodes and John Grieve.\r\n\r\nThey recorded the album in one night in 1981 with no plan and no idea of what they were doing.\t\r\n\r\nThey played drums, clarinet, synthesiser and piano but also made use of things that they found lying around the studio – old records, cookery books, telephone directories and a telephone.\r\n\r\nThe recordings were played down the phone to randomly dialled numbers and the reactions added to the recording.\t\r\n\r\nAll three had been involved in the recording of the first Nurse with Wound album Chance Meeting On A Dissecting Table Of A Sewing Machine And An Umbrella and had contributedmetal scrapings, piano, effects, clarinet and guitar during the session.\r\n\r\nThe album was released in 1981 as Vibrant Stapler Obscures Characteristic Growth by Hastings of Malawi on the Papal Products label.\r\n\r\nThe star of the record is Pat Simmons who was the voice of the UK speaking clock between 1963 and 1984.\r\n\r\nIn his book Lipstick Traces writer Greil Marcus seeks to draw a line\tfrom Dada through the Situationist International to punk rock. If this line exists then this record sits on the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe only review that the album received was from Steve Stapelton who suggested that “nobody should miss this vinyl disaster”\t\r\n\r\nGood or bad are not concepts that can be applied to this recording.\r\n\r\nThe record stands firmly in opposition to the now all pervading concepts of commercialisation, celebrity culture and the commodification of creative activity.",
