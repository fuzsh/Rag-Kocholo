        "text": "Malawi, a largely agricultural country, is making efforts to overcome decades of underdevelopment.\n\nFor the first 30 years of independence Malawi was run by an authoritarian and quixotic President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, but democratic institutions have taken hold since he relinquished power in the mid-1990s.\n\nMost Malawians rely on subsistence farming, but the food supply situation is precarious because of the climate.\n\nIn recent years the country has achieved significant economic growth.\n\nMr Chakwera was sworn in as president in June 2020, ending a period of turmoil after annulled elections the previous year.\n\nA Christian preacher and theologian, he beat the incumbent president Peter Mutharika in a re-run of the 2019 poll, which the courts decided had seen widespread irregularities.\n\nPresident Chakwera has pledged to try to unite the country after the bruising political stand-off.\n\nRadio is the leading medium and state-run Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) is the main national broadcaster.\n\nThe mid-1990s saw the start of a new era for press freedom in Malawi, with the emergence of independent newspapers and radio stations.\n\nHowever, newspapers are published in English, which limits their reach in a country where many do not speak the language."
