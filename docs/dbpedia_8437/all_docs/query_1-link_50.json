        "text": "Access to energy is a vital stage in the development of remote communities. It allows people to break out of a cycle of poverty and unlock their potential. Our Malawian projects make sure that the poorest people benefit, by leveraging the spending power of larger businesses.\n\nPeople living in extreme poverty can’t lift themselves out of it unless they have reliable energy sources. These communities are also the least able to adapt to the devastating consequences of climate change.\n\nIn Malawi, the demand for electricity is huge. Communities need it to power their businesses, schools and hospitals. Parents need it for earning an income, as well as cooking and refrigerating food. And, as daylight fades, children need it for safety and study.\n\nA unique combination of renewable hydro-electric power, skills training and knowledge sharing is already transforming lives in Malawi. Families are harnessing the power of flowing water to give them the electricity they so desperately need. Micro-hydro schemes are owned and operated by the communities they serve, putting them in control.\n\nOur work with our local partners in Mulanje brought clean, renewable energy to nearly 30,000 people. Six schools, three business centres and a clinic have also been connected to electricity."
