        "text": "Geography\n\nMalawi has long and narrow country lands extending in the north-south direction in the southeastern part of the African continent. The country is adjacent to Tanzania in the north, Zambia in the west, Mozambique in the south, southeast and southwest.\n\nThe country has a length of 850 km in the north-south direction and 350 km in the west-east direction. The entire border length of the country is 2,881 km, of which 475 km is Tanzania, 1,569 km is Mozambique and 837 km is Zambia.\n\nOf the countryâ€™s 118,484 kmÂ², 31% consists of forests, 25% of wetlands, 20% of agricultural land and 15% of pastures. The northern part of the country is more mountainous than the other regions and the elevations can reach 3,000 m above sea level.\n\nThe highest mountain in the country is Sapitwa Mountain with 3,002 m. Covering almost the entire eastern part of the country and dominated by Malawi for the most part, Lake Malawi is the largest lake in Malawi with the total area of 29,600 kmÂ², 570 km in length and 80 km in width. The Shire River is the longest river in the country with a length of 402 km.\n\nGovernance\n\nAccording to the constitution discussed in 1966, the country is governed by the presidential system. Malawi Congress Party (MCP) was the only party allowed by this constitution in the country that was a member of the Commonwealth.\n\nWith the referendum held in 1993, the possibility of transition from a single-party system to a multi-party system was provided. The Malawi parliament has a total of 177 deputies elected every five years. Like the deputies, the president is elected every five years, and a president can be elected for a maximum of two consecutive terms.\n\nClimate\n\nThe dry season is experienced from May to November. During this period, the air temperatures are quite high. December to April is the rainy period.\n\nTemperatures are around 20 degrees between May and September, and around 30 degrees in October and November.\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to the 2015 estimated data of the countryâ€™s population, 86.9% live according to Christian religious beliefs. The rate of 12.5% of the population living in Malawi according to the Islamic faith is a high rate for this part of the African continent.\n\nThe other population believes in local religions. Islam is more prevalent among the Yao ethnic group in the southern parts of the country. The religion, which first came to this land in the 1890s through Arab merchants and Mozambique, was later adopted and practiced especially by Yao.\n\nAccording to 2015 estimates, 26.9% of the Christian population believes in Protestantism and 18.1% in the Catholic sect, while 41% adopts other Christian beliefs, especially African Christianity, taught by Presbyterian and European missionaries.\n\nIndustry and Tourism\n\nMalawi is one of the less developed countries in the world and its economy is generally based on agriculture. 90 percent of gross national product and export income comes from agriculture and agricultural products. Approximately 85 percent of the population live in rural areas and engage in agriculture.\n\nMain export products are:\n\nTobacco\n\nCotton\n\nTea\n\nCoffee\n\nCandy\n\nChili pepper\n\nPeanut,\n\nProcessed wood products\n\nThe fish\n\nBauxite\n\nUranium\n\nGold"
