Malawi believes that being well dressed goes beyond good sewing, or good material, the connections that each person has with their spiritual side goes through being comfortable and being able to make Mother Earth proud. The entire creation of the brand and its unfolding was designed to convey the simplicity and culture of Africa.\n\nThe logo was created for this project and the entire unfolding of the brand identity, institutional items and packaging material for mailing. The whole concept of the brand and a duality of luxury and simplicity of the people of Malawi.\n\nmanifesto malawi\n\nby mother earth\n\nWe are worthy of spiritual sustenance in the form of clothing.\n\nOur clothes warm and comfort the soul of a rich people without riches. Wealth is in the simple moment of connecting with culture. The glow of being unique and authentic. Be proud of me mother earth.\n\nBe more Malawi is not a brand, it never had that pretension.\n\nB.M.M was born with the dream of being a cultural manifesto, with hundreds of years of history of the African people running through our veins, it was only a matter of time before we screamed for everyone to notice us. Happiness in the midst of social chaos, struggles and tribes that are alive in every conscious Malawian. We live on the sustenance of our culture and the world needs to experience the sensation of dressing in the eternal glories of our people."
