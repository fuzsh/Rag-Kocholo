        "text": "The Capital City of Malawi and one of the major entry points into the country. It is the seat of government and is located in the central region. Lilongwe started as a small village on the banks of the Lilongwe River, and became a British colonial administrative centre at the start of the 20th century. Lilongwe is sometimes referred to as the green city because of its well tendered gardens and abundant trees, exotic and indigenous.\n\nThe City Centre and Capital Hill, where banks, Diplomatic missions and Government ministries are located, are worth visiting. “In the centre of the city, near the referral Kamuzu Central Hospital, is the Lilongwe Nature Sanctuary and Wildlife Centre, an area covering 120 hectares established to give visitors an idea of what the place looked like before construction of the city began. The sanctuary has some animals.” “In the centre of the city, near the referral Kamuzu Central Hospital, is the Lilongwe Nature Sanctuary and Wildlife Centre, an area covering 120 hectares established to give visitors an idea of what the place looked like before construction of the city began. The sanctuary has some animals.” The city has seen unprecedented development since it assumed capital status. Buildings of modern architectural design are mushrooming everywhere, complimented by the city’s breathtaking landscape. Lilongwe as a tourist destination has been greatly enhanced, thanks to three multi-million dollar landmark projects under which an International Conference Centre, and the country’s first five-star hotel and a modern 40, 000-seat stadium have been built. With the expansion of most of the city’s roads into dual carriageways to improve the flow of traffic and ease congestion, a visitor to Lilongwe no longer finds it difficult to travel within the city as was the case in the past. The capital is served by the Kamuzu International Airport, located about 25 Km north of the city. The airport, offers regional and international flight connections. Malawian Airlines is the national flag carrier. The airport is also serviced by South African Airways, Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airlines, among others.
