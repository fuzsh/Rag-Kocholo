        "text": "Welcome to Malawi!\n\nAfrican’s Warm Heart, Malawi, is beating faster now and the legendary welcome is there for all who wish to experience the unrivalled combination of Lake, Landscape, Wildlife & Culture in one of Africa's most beautiful and compact countries. Recently crowned as one of Lonely Planet's Best in Travel Top Countries for 2022 (a remarkable second appearance on that prestigious list in recent years) Malawi’s tourism is set to return to the upward trajectory it was on pre-pandemic.\n\nDescribed as the ‘Warm Heart Of Africa’, this relatively little known gem of this diverse continent has so much to offer; wildlife, culture, adventure, scenery, and of course the third largest lake in Africa. A year-round destination, some even go as far to describe Malawi as the most attractive and complete destination in Africa!\n\nThis may seem to be an extravagant claim for such a relatively small country but the truth lies in the unique combination of attractions that Malawi has to offer. Where else will you find such rich cultural interaction and such a genuinely warm welcome in a country at peace with itself? Where else can you experience such a diverse scenic kaleidoscope in such a small area? Here you have central Africa’s highest mountain, vast high plateaux with seemingly limitless views, forests and unspoilt game parks and, the jewel in the crown, Africa’s third largest and most beautiful lake – truly an inland sea. With thrilling safaris now rivalling its neighbours thanks to the sustainable wildlife revolution brought about by Africa Parks, it’s easy to see why Malawi is now proving so popular.\n\nMalawi’s tourist industry is vital to the overall economy of the country and supports huge numbers of local Malawians through employment and community projects, as well as helping conserve the country’s natural riches. As it attempts to recover from the damage caused by COVID-19, and continue in its important role, the industry is doing all it can to ensure the well-being of its visitors. A set of national COVID-19 Health & Safety protocols for tourism has been established, that have resulted in the award of the World Travel & Tourism Council’s Safe Travels Stamp. WTTC’s Stamp was established to show travellers which destinations have adopted globally standardised health and hygiene protocols in order that they can experience ‘Safe Travels’.\n\nThis site is brought to you by members of Malawi's travel and tourism industry - accommodation providers, tours & safari companies, and transport companies. Everything you might need for your holiday in Malawi."
