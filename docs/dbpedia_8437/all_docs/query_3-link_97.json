        "text": "In Malawi, our Bantwana Initiative is preventing new HIV infections and reducing vulnerability among children and adolescent girls and young women.\n\nThough Malawi has made progress controlling the HIV epidemic, of the 1.1 million Malawians who are living with HIV, 74,000 are children under 15. Only 85% of them are enrolled on antiretroviral drugs, and of those, only 65% are achieving viral suppression. Bantwana is helping to close that gap by facilitating referrals for testing and linkage to care as well as providing adherence support to ensure all children living with HIV are maintained on life-saving antiretroviral therapies.\n\nWe also provide wrap-around services to families of children living with HIV so that parents and caregivers can support their children to stay healthy and thrive.\n\nAdolescent girls and young women make up over 70% of new HIV cases in Malawi. Many are child brides, sexual violence survivors, and young mothers. We are helping girls to stay HIV-free by delivering a layered package of support that includes life skills, HIV and sexual violence prevention, education and economic strengthening support, and positive parenting interventions for their caregivers."
