        "text": "* * *\n\nSunday in Belfast. Reverend Martin Smith, a leader of the Orange Order, is preaching. Great Victoria Street Presbyterian Church is filled with row on row of men in dark suits with black and silver tasseled bands around their necks and down the front of their suits.\n\nSomber faces. A warm beery smell in the pews and hard looks for the stranger who takes notes. Eyes that squint tight like vises, seeking acknowledgement. Who are you, boy? A question that leads to stomping and smashing of the face for those who aren’t dressed right, whose hair is too long.\n\n“Many say,” the Reverend intones, “that the trouble is an anarchist, Republican, or Communist plot. All of these are involved, yes, but it is those people who have closed out the sun, who use the name Jesus as only a blasphemy, who have forsaken their churches to gather in the streets who are to blame. And what shall we do? What are the Orange to do?\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“Stand together, as always. For the tragedy is not those who are born in darkness and die in darkness but those who have seen the light and turn away. Let us pray.”\n\nHeads bow. After the sermon, the Royal Black Preceptory Order march, in black bowler hats, white gloves, and dark suits. Scotch-Irish replicas of English gentlemen by the hundreds fill the streets of Belfast. Again, the Union Jack floats past Unity flats, daring any to defy it.\n\n“A terrible beauty is born,” is the way William Butler Yeats described the Easter Rebellion of 1916. Sixty-five years later, the terrible beauty still lives. It has not aged a day. New names, new faces play out old roles.\n\nIn Ireland, another Easter has come and gone. Belfast still waits."
