        "text": "Who knew what the future had in store on May 27, 1944, when enemy fire knocked tail gunner Martin Smith's B-17 out of the sky over France?\n\nWhen the Flying Fortress crash-landed and came to rest in a field near the tiny village of Avoudrey, who could have predicted that, more than 60 years later, the resident would return to that very spot and receive France's most prestigious award -- the Legion of Honor?\n\nCertainly not Martin A. Smith. He and his crewmates had far weightier matters to contemplate on that grim day so long ago.\n\nSurvival, for instance.\n\n\"Fur you, die var ist ober,\" Martin remembers a German officer saying -- although it was already, even then, a World War II movie cliche -- as they were herded into the first of the two prisoner of war camps in which they would spend 11 months of grueling captivity.\n\nThe war was indeed over for the 22-year-old Smith on this, his eighth combat mission.\n\nAnd life would never be the same.\n\nForced to walk hundreds of miles through freezing mud, water and ice, Martin's feet became frostbitten. And once inside the barbed-wire enclosures, bitter cold and hunger were his constant companions.\n\n\"I was 170 pounds when I went in,\" Martin can joke now, \"but I was down to 120 when I came out. It's the last time I saw my ribs.\"\n\nThe 82-year-old man chronicled his adventures of incarceration and deprivation in a self-published book, \"Stalag,\" four years ago.\n\nLittle did he envision that this reminiscence would become the groundwork for a French author's book and set in motion the kaleidoscope of events that would culminate in the award.\n\nIt all came about when the Avoudrey town pharmacist, Phillippe Guillery, happened upon an old black-and-white photo of the downed B-17 that sparked his interest. Copious research, and four years worth of e-mails with Martin, resulted in a successful book, \"Crash Pour La Liberte.\"\n\nPhillippe later organized a small town celebration on July 14 for Bastille Day. One thing led to another, and it appears half of France got involved with the preparations.\n\nCertainly, Martin and his wife, Florrie, invited by Phillippe to attend the festivities, had no idea beforehand of the immensity of the ballyhoo.\n\n\"Champagne flowed like wine, and the wine flowed like water,\" Martin laughingly recalls. \"Everywhere we went, people treated us like royalty.\"\n\n\"It was an easy lifestyle to get used to,\" Florrie agrees.\n\n\"The French people could not have been nicer to us throughout our two-week stay,\" Martin says emphatically. \"Gifts of cash, candies, bottles of wine, books, DVDs ...\"\n\nSo much for a supposed anti-American French bias.\n\nThe centerpiece of their stay, of course, was the dedication ceremonies. In the field where the plane crashed, a monument had been erected in the crew's honor with every name engraved upon it.\n\nMartin was the guest of honor at this dedication --\"There's nobody else left from the crashed plane's crew ... in good health, at least,\" Martin explains -- which included ribbon cuttings, balloons and a parade of World War II-era antique vehicles to mark the symbolic route walked by the captured crewmen to the nearby town of Flangebouche.\n\nThe highlight of the day, of course, besides the conferring of three medallions, was the Legion of Honor award presentation.\n\nNot to mention kisses on both cheeks.\n\n\"I was flabbergasted ... because what I did was not all that tremendous,\" Martin says, before pausing.\n\nUpon reflection, Martin realizes the award is not a personal honor so much as a heartfelt thank-you from the French people to all World War II American servicemen.\n\n\"I mean, I was just a sergeant,\" he says, laughing.\n\n\"Now look at me I'm a knight of the Legion of Honor.\"\n\nFor one man in Hank's World, it was a long day's journey into knight.\n\nThis story appeared on Page A5 of The Standard-Times on August 15, 2004."
