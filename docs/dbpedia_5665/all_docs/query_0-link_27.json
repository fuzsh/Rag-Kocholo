        "text": "DATE October 9, 2003 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Martin Smith discusses his \"Frontline\" documentary\n\nentitled \"Truth, War and Consequences\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\n\"Truth, War and Consequences\" is the title of the report on the season\n\npremiere of the PBS investigative series \"Frontline.\" It's about the\n\ninfighting among the Pentagon, State Department and White House over the\n\nintelligence that was used to make the case for war in Iraq and the planning\n\nthat was done to create an orderly postwar transition.\n\nMy guest, Martin Smith, is the reporter and co-producer of this edition.\n\nHe's made several \"Frontline\" documentaries that have focused on terrorism,\n\nincluding \"The Terrorist and the Superpower,\" \"In Search of al-Qaeda\" and\n\n\"Hunting bin Laden.\" His \"Frontline\" documentary \"Truth, War and\n\nConsequences\" airs tonight on most PBS stations.\n\nOne of the people you interviewed for the show is Ahmed Chalabi, who was a\n\nmajor source for the Pentagon in its pre- and postwar planning. Just tell us\n\nbriefly who Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress, which he was part\n\nof, who they are.\n\nMr. MARTIN SMITH (\"Frontline\" Correspondent): The Iraqi National Congress\n\nwas founded in 1992 in the wake of the first Gulf War; founded by Dr. Ahmed\n\nChalabi, who comes from a banking background. And he has probably done more\n\nto bring about the fall of Saddam Hussein than any other person besides George\n\nBush. Civilians in the Pentagon have been enthralled with him. He's, at the\n\nsame time, a very divisive figure, a controversial figure who many in the\n\nState Department and the CIA revile. That's not too strong a word, given the\n\nkind of controversy that he stirs up in Washington.\n\nGROSS: What kind of information did he give the Pentagon that the Pentagon\n\nused to make its case for invading Iraq?\n\nMr. SMITH: He provided defectors. He actually received money from the US\n\ngovernment, and he used that money to attract and pay defectors. Now he has\n\nsaid that he has only provided three defectors. But if you talk to people in\n\nthe intelligence community, it's much more than that. And his organization,\n\nif it wasn't Ahmed Chalabi himself providing the defector, has also provided\n\ninformation and defectors.\n\nSo Richard Perle, the Defense Department adviser, told The New York Times\n\nthat Ahmed Chalabi was, I think the quote is, \"without question, the single\n\nbest source of intelligence the US government had on Iraq.\"\n\nGROSS: What was Chalabi telling the Pentagon about weapons of mass\n\ndestruction?\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, he was making a case all along that Saddam Hussein had\n\ncurrent and active programs. And the problem here is that Iraq was a black\n\nbox. It wasn't well-penetrated by our intelligence services, so we relied on\n\ndefectors. And people in the intelligence agencies will tell you that\n\ndefectors are a risky bet because they have other motivations. And these\n\nguys were getting money. They also knew their bread was buttered by the INC.\n\nThe INC had a political interest in seeing Saddam fall. And so the defectors\n\nknew that if they brought information that the INC wanted to hear, it would\n\nbe well received.\n\nGROSS: If the Pentagon trusted Ahmed Chalabi and the INC as a source, how\n\ncome the State Department did not?\n\nMr. SMITH: The State Department was dubious about the idea of backing any\n\nsingle Iraqi exile. The idea that the State Department had was that we\n\nshould move into Iraq and allow Iraqi exiles to come back home and to let\n\nIraqis in the country organize themselves politically and not come in with a\n\npreordained--you know, backing an Iraqi exile group from the get-go.\n\nSo it wasn't so much that they all distrusted Chalabi, although there were\n\nthose that did. They'd had some bad experiences in the middle of the '90s in\n\nwhich they had backed Chalabi. He'd received CIA contacts and money. And he\n\nwas running some operations in Iraq to try to get an uprising going. And he\n\nprovided intelligence to the CIA and the State Department that was deemed\n\nshoddy. The depth and breadth of his support was deemed not what he was\n\nclaiming it to be. And that soured many people in the State Department on\n\nwhat this guy represented.\n\nGROSS: Another source of disagreement between different branches of the Bush\n\nadministration was the weapons of mass destruction. Was there definitive\n\nevidence of weapons of mass destruction? Where did the Pentagon stand on\n\nthat?\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, the civilians in the Pentagon believed that there was\n\nenough evidence. They had felt that the CIA, the DIA were biased, that they\n\ndidn't evaluate the intelligence of weapons of mass destruction or the\n\nevidence of links with al-Qaeda, you know, between al-Qaeda and Saddam fairly.\n\nThey thought that the CIA had biases against believing that al-Qaeda and\n\nSaddam could work together. So they formed their own small intelligence unit\n\nin order to essentially second-guess the intelligence that was coming out of\n\nthe CIA and the other agencies.\n\nGROSS: And what did they find with this special intelligence office?\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, the special intelligence office is a bit of a secret. We\n\ndon't know exactly what they found. We do have some information that they\n\nwere looking over the intelligence that existed and re-evaluating it and\n\nsending it back up, you know, to policy-makers. Much of it was apparently\n\nintelligence that had been ignored or discredited, and they pulled this back\n\nout of the file and said, `Hey, wait a minute. Look at this.'\n\nOne example of that was reports of meetings between the 9/11 hijacker Mohamed\n\nAtta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague. This got into comments that\n\nthe vice president would make on \"Meet the Press.\" This was information that\n\nhad been discredited by the FBI. They determined that Atta could not have\n\nbeen in Prague when those supposed meetings took place. But yet this would\n\nlive on and this would continue to be repeated by the vice president. This\n\nwas the kind of thing that the special intelligence office would take a look\n\nat and say, `Wait a minute. We think this could've happened, we think this is\n\ngood evidence.' And so they would ship it on.\n\nGROSS: Now you interviewed Ahmed Chalabi for your report, \"Truth, War and\n\nConsequences.\" And you asked him about his claim that he had evidence that\n\nthere were links between Iraq and al-Qaeda. What did he tell you?\n\nMr. SMITH: It was an interesting exchange that I had with Ahmed Chalabi.\n\nI'd met him in '98, because, at that time, after the African Embassy bombings,\n\nI was investigating al-Qaeda at that time, and I met with Ahmed Chalabi\n\nbecause he was making claims about al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein then. And I\n\nasked him again about that in the program, and he said, indeed, he had lots of\n\nevidence that there were links. And I said, `Do you have any documentary\n\nevidence of any kind?' He says, `Yeah, there's such a document.' And I said,\n\n`Well, I'd like to see that. That's important.' I mean, in fact, that's the\n\nreason we went to war, one of the explanations for why we needed to go after\n\nSaddam Hussein. And he then sort of twisted and did promise finally to show\n\nme the document but then never was able to do so. He's now said that he can't\n\nfind it. It's a kind of dog-ate-my-homework excuse, which I can't quite buy.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Martin Smith. And his report\n\n\"Truth, War and Consequences\" will be broadcast tonight on most PBS stations\n\nas part of the \"Frontline\" series.\n\nAnother subject that you investigate in \"Truth, War and Consequences\" is the\n\nplanning that went on within the Bush administration for what would happen in\n\nIraq after the invasion. The State Department had created something called\n\nthe Future of Iraq Project, and this was created before the invasion of Iraq.\n\nWhat was the goal of this project?\n\nMr. SMITH: The Future of Iraq Project, the idea behind it, was to draw on\n\nthe Iraqi exile community, engage Iraqis in thinking hard about the problems\n\nthat a postwar Iraq was going to face. This ranged from, you know, how to\n\nkeep law and order on the streets to how to keep the water and electricity\n\nflowing after the war, I mean, all of these very important questions that we\n\nfailed really to address in the immediate postwar period and still struggling\n\nto address them. So they engaged about 200 to 300 Iraqis in about 15\n\ndifferent working groups all looking at various aspects of postwar Iraq.\n\nGROSS: And what did they recommend?\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, the problem with the Future of Iraq Project is that there\n\nwas no head to this thing. I mean, it was a lot of seminars, a lot of talk,\n\nbut there was no single synthesis of this material because, essentially, the\n\nproject got cut short. It got cut off before it could come to any kind of\n\nsynthesis. So it's hard to say that there were any--in fact, many of the\n\nreports--and there were pages and pages of reports--were in Arabic and never\n\ngot translated in such a way that an American official in Iraq could even\n\nread them.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Martin Smith. His documentary \"Truth, War and\n\nConsequences\" airs tonight on most PBS stations on the investigative series\n\n\"Frontline.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're (technical difficulties) Martin Smith. And his report\n\n\"Truth, War and Consequences\" will be broadcast tonight on the PBS series\n\n\"Frontline.\"\n\nYou also interviewed members of the military. And some of them shared with\n\nyou their frustrations that they were unequipped to help prevent looting and\n\nto keep order.\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, they were unequipped to keep order. They hadn't had that\n\nkind of training. They aren't policemen. On the other hand, I talked to\n\nGeneral Conway, who heads up the Marines there, and he said that they\n\nbasically stood by for several days and watched the looting with a kind of\n\npassive attitude because they weren't told to do otherwise. This goes back to\n\nthe rosy scenario. We had an understanding--I mean, if you remember,\n\nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld talked about stuff happens, when you give people\n\nfreedom, they're going to run wild a bit, and there was kind of an, you know,\n\nattitude that this wasn't such a big problem.\n\nThe problem was that our concept of looting and their concept of looting were\n\nworlds apart. And the kind of looting that took place was so crushing to the\n\ninfrastructure of the country that it set us, you know, far, far back.\n\nGROSS: So did members of the military who you interviewed tell you that they\n\nwished they had been given orders to stop the looting once it started?\n\nMr. SMITH: Yeah, I found it almost exasperating talking to General Conway\n\nwhen I asked him about that and he said that they had pretty much watched it\n\nwith the attitude that it was something like, you know, sort of a\n\nmuch-deserved redistribution of wealth. And I said, `Well, but as you\n\nrealized it was going further than that and it was crushing the\n\ninfrastructure.' I said, `Did you get on the phone and call anybody and say,\n\nyou know, \"Maybe we ought to stop this?\"' And he says, `No.' Basically, he\n\nwaited for orders and the orders didn't come. `We sat by and we allowed this\n\nto go on.'\n\nGROSS: In your \"Frontline\" story, several people you interview make the\n\npoint how unprepared the United States was for the looting, but one person you\n\ninterviewed talks about how he tried to convince the Bush administration to\n\nprepare for this 'cause he'd seen it in other countries. What did he tell\n\nyou?\n\nMr. SMITH: This is Robert Perito, who works for the US Institute for Peace,\n\nwhich is a government-sponsored think tank in Washington. He was invited by\n\nRichard Perle to come make a presentation. Perle had seen one of his\n\nmonographs, his papers, and Perito was an expert on postwar situations. So he\n\ncame to the Defense Policy Board in February, 2003, just a month before the\n\nwar really began, and said, based on his experience in studying postwar\n\nsituations in Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Panama--in all of these\n\nsituations what was paramount was to have a police force on the ground\n\noperating immediately after the fall of the existing government to prevent\n\nlooting and disorder and rampant crime.\n\nAnd his presentation was to take 30 minutes. The Defense Policy Board, which\n\nmeets just off the, you know, conference room right next to Secretary\n\nRumsfeld's office, had him there for 90 minutes. They were very interested in\n\nwhat he had to say. He was told that he was likely to come back. I couldn't\n\ntalk to Richard Perle about this, because Perle says that the discussions that\n\ntake place at the policy board are off the table, off the record. But, in any\n\ncase, Perito did speak about it, he did make his presentation, but when he\n\ntalked to the reconstruction team, they told him, well, they didn't really\n\nknow what was going to go on after the war so they were going to wait and see\n\nand then make recommendations later. Well, that proved fatal.\n\nGROSS: Another controversy that you look into in your \"Frontline\" report is\n\nthe issue of whether people who had been in the Baathist Party, Saddam\n\nHussein's party, should be allowed to participate in the reconstruction of\n\nIraq. In the first phase of the reconstruction, under General Garner, they\n\nwere allowed to participate. Then when Paul Bremer took over the\n\nreconstruction, he started a de-Baathification program. What was his\n\nexplanation for wanting, you know, to get Baathists out of the reconstruction\n\nprogram?\n\nMr. SMITH: De-Baathification, again, was a key platform plank of the Iraqi\n\nNational Congress. The basic assumption was that the Baathists had done so\n\nmuch harm to the country that there was no way that anybody who was in the,\n\nyou know, top 40,000 Baathists technocrats, bureaucrats that had anything to\n\ndo with Saddam's government simply couldn't stay. They had to go. This was a\n\ncontroversial proposal because there were other Iraqis who said, you know, `We\n\nneed a smooth transition. Many of these people were Baathists out of need,\n\nnot because of belief, not because they were committed to Saddam but simply\n\nbecause they were people who had chosen to get by.' So they said, `And, look,\n\nwe've got to keep some of these people in place.' And Garner was going about\n\nwith that approach.\n\nAnd when Garner was let go and Bremer came in, Bremer basically removed some\n\n30,000 to 40,000 people from ever working again in any government position.\n\nAnd these people then had nothing to do. Some people will say that these\n\npeople then become a major problem for the occupation in that they support the\n\nso-called resistance.\n\nGROSS: We've talked about the importance of Ahmed Chalabi's role in making\n\nthe case to go to war and how controversial he was, you know, how the\n\nPentagon supported him and the State Department distrusted him. What is the\n\nrole of Ahmed Chalabi now in the new Iraq?\n\nMr. SMITH: Well, Ahmed Chalabi is one of the members of the Iraqi Governing\n\nCouncil that was appointed by the coalition, by the administrator, Paul\n\nBremer. So he's one of the 25--it's now 24 because of the successful\n\nassassination of one of the members. So he's one of 24. He no longer enjoys\n\nthe kind of backing that he would've hoped. Bremer realizes that it's going\n\nto be a long and slow process of building a democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, there still is pressure coming out of the vice president's\n\noffice and some in the civilians of the Pentagon who would like to see a\n\nquicker turnover of power. Ambassador Bremer seems to understand, from what\n\nI can gather from talking to him, that it's going to take time to build\n\ninstitutions that will stand up a real democracy. You don't want to rush\n\ninto an election before everyone that counts has a chance to organize\n\npolitically and put forward candidates.\n\nGROSS: You went into your \"Frontline\" documentary, \"Truth, War and\n\nConsequences,\" with a lot of questions. What are some of the questions you\n\ncome away with now that you've completed it?\n\nMr. SMITH: That's a good question. I think I have a lot of the same\n\nquestions. You know, I still have the questions about the intelligence. It's\n\nnot my contention that the administration was lying, as many believe. I think\n\nthey believed that--I mean, they interpreted the intelligence. Again, the\n\nintelligence was spotty. So I still have questions about how they were able\n\nto take such spotty evidence and turn it into the kind of, as I say, clear and\n\nunambiguous message that they did. I have questions about why we listen so\n\nmuch to the rosy scenario, you know, we will be greeted as liberators, sweets\n\nand flowers, when there was lots of evidence on the table that this wouldn't\n\nbe the case. So those are still the big questions.\n\nGROSS: Martin Smith, thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nMr. SMITH: It's great to be here. Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Martin Smith. His \"Frontline\" report \"Truth, War and Consequences\"\n\nwill be shown tonight on most PBS stations.\n\nI'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, actress Sarah Polley and her new film, \"My Life Without\n\nMe.\" She plays a young wife and mother who's just found out she's dying of\n\ncancer, but she keeps it a secret from her husband and children. Polley's\n\nother films include \"Exotica,\" \"The Sweet Hereafter\" and \"Go.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Sarah Polley on her life and career as an actress\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest Sarah Polley is a veteran actress although she's only 24. She\n\nstarted acting professionally at the age of six. Her movies include\n\n\"Exotica,\" \"The Claim,\" \"Go\" and \"The Sweet Hereafter,\" for which she won the\n\nBoston Society of Film Critics Award for best supporting actress.\n\nPolley stars in the new film \"My Life Without Me\" with Mark Ruffalo, Deborah\n\nHarry and Amanda Plummer. Polley plays a young wife and mother who lives in a\n\ntrailer with her husband and two daughters in the back yard of her mother's\n\nhouse. She works nights as a janitor at a university. Early in the film she\n\nlearns she's dying of cancer, but she doesn't want to cast a shadow over her\n\nfamily, so she keeps the news a secret from them. After making that decision,\n\nshe has her second meeting with her doctor.\n\n(Soundbite of \"My Life Without Me\")\n\nUnidentified Actor: So you didn't come last week.\n\nMs. SARAH POLLEY: There didn't seem to be a lot of point.\n\nUnidentified Actor: I have to give you a further scan and a fuller biopsy.\n\nMs. POLLEY: OK. No, no. I'm sorry. I don't want any of those things.\n\nUnidentified Actor: OK.\n\nMs. POLLY: I'm sorry. I need to feel like I've got some control, so I don't\n\nwant any more tests if they're not going to save me. OK? I don't want to be\n\nhere. I don't want to die here. I will not have the only thing my kids\n\nremember about me be a hospital ward.\n\nUnidentified Actor: So why are you here then?\n\nMs. POLLEY: It's this package. I want you to look after it for me.\n\nUnidentified Actor: I don't know. What is it?\n\nMs. POLLEY: I've recorded birthday messages for both of my daughters for\n\nevery birthday till they're 18.\n\nUnidentified Actor: And you want me to give these to them? Why don't you ask\n\nyour husband?\n\nMs. POLLEY: 'Cause Donald, you know, he'd lose them, or maybe he'd give them\n\nto them next year or maybe the year after that. I don't--or maybe he'd give\n\nthem to them all at once. You know, they wouldn't understand a thing if he\n\ndid that. So can you just tell me you'll do it, please?\n\nGROSS: Sarah Polley, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Thank you very much.\n\nGROSS: Well, what is it in your character's personality that you think\n\nexplains why she doesn't want to tell her husband and her children that she's\n\ndying?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Well, I had it explained to me by a Japanese journalist who\n\nsays--she's a very Eastern character. I think that she does actually the\n\nexact right thing in the context of her life. I don't know that keeping your\n\ndeath or your dying a secret is the right thing for many people to do in the\n\ncontext of their lives. But for her I think it really is the greatest gift\n\nthat she can give her kids and her husband, to save them the kind of trips to\n\nthe hospital and the memory of her dying. And as someone who--you know, I\n\nlost my mother to cancer when I was very young. I really understand that\n\ninstinct to do that. It's not necessarily, again, what I would recommend\n\npeople do in this situation. But I think in the context of her life, where\n\nshe really is the most responsible, competent person in her life, she really\n\nis giving them a gift, and she really is doing the right thing.\n\nGROSS: Your mother died of cancer when you were 11, is that right?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: How did she tell you that she was sick?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Well, it's an interesting thing and probably another reason why I\n\nwas really attracted to this material. You know, I don't think she ever\n\nreally admitted or knew that she was going to die, although objectively sort\n\nof, you know, in retrospect, it would have been very clear to anyone that it\n\nwas terminal, you know, two and a half years before she died. But she had a\n\ndoctor who was actually a really good friend of hers who was also in denial.\n\nAnd no one really everadmitted she was going to die until, like, the day\n\nbefore it happened. So she was someone who didn't get a chance to do all the\n\nthings she wanted to do before she died for her kids or for herself. And so\n\nthere's something sort of oddly therapeutic about playing a part where someone\n\ndies so well and so gracefully and accepts it so fully and then has the chance\n\nto try to do something about it.\n\nGROSS: How long was she sick? How long?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Two and a half years.\n\nGROSS: So you watched her get sicker and sicker?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: You know, one of the premises of \"My Life Without Me\" is that the\n\ncharacter, when she finds out that she's dying, your character, makes a list\n\nof all the things that she wants to do before she dies, including, you know,\n\nfinding a new wife for her husband, sending birthday messages for every year\n\nuntil they reach 18 for both of her daughters. Did you ever find anything\n\nlike that that your mother had, a list of, like, things that she wanted to\n\naccomplish before she died?\n\nMs. POLLEY: No, because I think, unfortunately, she never had the moment of\n\nrealizing she was going to die. And I think that's why...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMs. POLLEY: ...this was so interesting to me because I think she's someone\n\nwho would have made that list and would have been very practical and very\n\npragmatic and had the strength to do all those things. She just didn't have\n\nthe chance.\n\nGROSS: Lots of people have fantasies about what they would do, how they would\n\nlive if they were told that they only had a few days or weeks or months. Did\n\nyou ever have fantasies like that?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. You know, it's funny, I don't know that I ever really\n\nmanaged to make my list, you know. I actually found that while I was making\n\nthis film, it was important for me to not compare what I would do to what the\n\ncharacter would do because I inevitably came into conflict with the character.\n\nI think she's 10 times stronger and nobler and braver than I'll ever be. So,\n\nyou know, moments where she's doing things for other people, I'm not sure\n\nthat, you know, having discovered what I would do would make it easier to play\n\nher in some way. So I don't know. I mean, I honestly think what I would do\n\nwould make a very boring movie. It's like the least cinematic list of all\n\ntime. Like, I think it'd justinvolve sort of drinking tea on a couch and\n\nreading the paper and, you know, hanging out with friends. So it's really not\n\na good movie.\n\nGROSS: I think it's interesting what you said, that you didn't want to\n\nexamine what you would do too much because it would bring you into conflict\n\nwith her character. One technique of acting is to kind of go deep into\n\nyourself and find those similarities between you and the character and to find\n\nthe emotional moment in your life that most resonates with that moment. And\n\nit's interesting that you would say that that sometimes doesn't work, that\n\nthere's a big difference, and you have to go with the character and not\n\nyourself.\n\nMs. POLLEY: For me, I have no objection to actors sort of taking things\n\npersonally and making those personal connections. I think it can really work\n\nfor some people. For me, I find my acting's always a lot better when those\n\nconnections are subconscious. And I think, you know, what drew me to the\n\ncharacter and to the piece--you know, the connections are all there, and I\n\nhave a lifetime of experience that kind of, you know, helped me go there. To\n\nmake those connections consciously for me, it feels like you're somehow\n\nexploiting your own life in a way that I'm sort of uncomfortable with. Again,\n\nI pass no judgement on actors who do do that, but for me I always find the\n\nbest work I do comes out of really trying to see the world through someone\n\nelse's eyes and not through my own.\n\nGROSS: Now you started acting when you were, like, five or six, so you\n\nobviously hadn't studied the method yet or, you know, you hadn't been to,\n\nlike, drama school. So what advice were you given about what to draw on and\n\nhow to get into a character when you were just a child?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Well, it really varied. And, you know, there are directors who\n\nknow what they're doing with kids, and there are a lot of directors who don't\n\nknow what they're doing with kids. And, you know, ultimately, I think it's an\n\nincredibly damaging environment for any child to be in, no matter how much\n\nthey want to or no matter how much their parents want them to be in it. You\n\nknow, the worst examples were two weeks after my mother died I was on a\n\nseries, and they wrote in a scene where I cry about my mother dying because\n\nthey knew they'd get a great performance out of me. So, you know, that's\n\nwhere, you know, I probably formed my whole, you know, style of not making\n\nthose connections personally because for me, you know, that began as a very\n\nsort of exploitative tactic from someone else. So I sort of felt like that\n\nexperience, in a way, got robbed from me by someone for a crappy TV show,\n\nwhich was kind of a drag.\n\nGROSS: That sounds horrible.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, it was pretty bad.\n\nGROSS: So did you weep a lot in that scene because the emotions were still\n\nraw?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. And I think, you know, the problem then becomes--and, you\n\nknow, I kind of have a theory about child actors. When you see a great\n\nperformance by a child actor, you know, the ones that we can think of--I've\n\ndone a lot of research into it, and, you know, nine time out of 10 when there\n\nis something written, sort of, biographical information about that child, the\n\ngreat child performances, the great crying scenes come from kids who were\n\neither abused physically or sexually or had a parent die young. And so it\n\nsort of calls into question, like: Are we watching a great actor in, you\n\nknow, this child actor, or are we watching somebody's grief that is being sort\n\nof a forced catharsis that then prevents them from experiencing it in a\n\nnatural way maybe when they're older and more mature and ready to do that? So\n\nI sort of have this ongoing debate in my head about whether or not, you know,\n\nI should even go and see films that have kids in it when they're crying. So I\n\nthink crying scenes with kids should be avoided at all costs.\n\nGROSS: My guest is actress Sarah Polley. She's starring in the new film \"My\n\nLife Without Me.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Sarah Polley is my guest, and she's starring in the new movie \"My Life\n\nWithout Me.\"\n\nNow I know your father is an actor, Michael Polley...\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...and your late mother was a casting director.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: Did you learn about acting from watching TV or from watching them go\n\nto work?\n\nMr. POLLEY: Probably both. My mother was an actor, too, at certain points in\n\nher life. And, you know, I think that they probably taught me that it was\n\nsomething, you know, worthwhile in some sense. Like, I constantly, in my\n\nlife, feel ambiguous about whether or not this is a worthwhile thing to do\n\nwith your life. I always want to feel like I'm contributing something or\n\nchanging the world in some way, and is acting really the most direct way to do\n\nthat? And they were people who were very sort of progressive and very\n\nsocially conscious and felt like this was, in a small indirect way, a way to\n\ncontribute or change the world in some way. So, in that sense, I learned its\n\nworth and its merit.\n\nYou know, they were stage actors and very different style of acting than I\n\nhave. I mean, my dad--you know, the kind of actor he was on stage is\n\nsomething I could never do or never even aspire to do. He's sort of like the\n\nkind of person who can own a room and light up a room. And I'm the kind of\n\nperson who's--you know, I'm very introspective, and I think I only really work\n\non films in that way. Like, he can go out to an audience, and I can only work\n\nin environments where the audience comes to me. So it's a very different kind\n\nof craft, I think.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's interesting that you say that because, with the exception\n\nof \"Go,\" the roles that I've seen you in are really introspective roles. And\n\nyou often have some kind of, like, secret that you're keeping or something\n\njust, like, really private and personal. And when I watch you on screen, I'm\n\nalways thinking, `What is she thinking? What has gone on? Why is she doing\n\nthis?' It is a very kind of introverted presence that you often have.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. And, you know, it's something that I really love doing.\n\nI've always really loved playing characters with secrets. I feel like there's\n\nso many more layers to play with there, and scenes where you come into contact\n\nwith another actor become so much more sort of dynamic when there's something\n\nyou're withholding. I find even roles where there isn't a secret, I try to\n\ncreate one just because I think the possibilities then are endless. And you\n\ncan surprise yourself more often, which I think is the greatest joy of being\n\nan actor--is when you do something that you didn't expect. So I do love\n\nplaying those kinds of parts. I'm sort of experimenting now with doing other\n\nthings where I'm a little less introspective and a little braver in some\n\nsense. So I don't know. I mean, maybe I'll mostly focus on doing the kinds\n\nof roles I've done, but I'd sort of like to be able to know that I could do\n\nthe other if I felt like it.\n\nGROSS: Now something else I wanted to ask you about, about your childhood. I\n\nread about this. Tell me if it's true: that you had an operation for\n\nscoliosis, curvature of the spine, when you were young.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. Yeah, when I was 15, I had two Harrington rods put in my\n\nback.\n\nGROSS: Wow. So you have them now?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. I've got a pound of steel in my back that goes off every\n\ntime I go through an airport metal detector.\n\nGROSS: Oh, what a great time for that. Remind me not to travel with you.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, it's really something. There's a lot of having to hike up\n\nmy shirt and show, like, 50 people that there's a scar.\n\nGROSS: Oh, how bizarre.\n\nMs. POLLEY: No, it's really bizarre.\n\nGROSS: So does that limit, like, the exercises and stuff you can do?\n\nMs. POLLEY: No. It's actually one of those--it just worked really well for\n\nme, this surgery. You know, it's a 10-hour major surgery on your spinal cord,\n\nand somehow my life is completely normal. There's very few things I can't do.\n\nI mean, I don't do anything high impact, and I don't move pianos. But beyond\n\nthat, you know, I experience little to no pain.\n\nGROSS: And were you very troubled, like, with pain before the operation?\n\nMs. POLLEY: A bit. It's more discomfort. It's more just sort of a long-term\n\nthing because, I mean, I was walking strangely. My spine was clearly curved.\n\nLike, I had a bit of a Quasimodo stance when I was about 15. So ultimately it\n\ncould have, you know, collapsed in my organs and my lungs and that kind of\n\nthing. So it was sort of more a preventative thing because scoliosis\n\ngenerally doesn't get better. It either stays the same, or it gets worse.\n\nGROSS: Right, right.\n\nMs. POLLEY: It was about a 60-degree curve I had, so it was pretty important\n\nto have it done.\n\nGROSS: Right. Wow. So, you know, I want to figure out how you got from the\n\nchildhood roles that you did on screen, which were, like, Disney\n\nroles--actually, before we get to the roles that you've done as an adult, just\n\nkind of tick off for us some of the childhood roles.\n\nMs. POLLEY: You know, I was the lead in a series called \"Road to Avonlea,\"\n\nwhich I think in the States was called \"Avonlea,\" that ran for many years on\n\nthe Disney Channel. I was in \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.\" I was in\n\na series called \"Romona\" and then a bunch of sort of, like, TV movies and\n\nthings like that.\n\nGROSS: OK. Now as a mature teen-ager and young adult, you started doing\n\nfilms like Atom Egoyan's movies--he's an independent Canadian film\n\ndirector--the film \"Exotica,\" in which you co-starred. This is a film about\n\nincest and mysterious sexual urges and lots of secrets. And, really, it's a\n\nterrific film, so it's a pretty complex movie. And then also with Atom\n\nEgoyan, you made \"The Sweet Hereafter,\" in which you play a student who\n\nsurvives a bus crash and is left crippled and unable to walk. And there's\n\nmore about secrets in that movie also. But both of those movies are movies in\n\nwhich a lot is implied and not said, and the viewer has to kind of figure it\n\nout.\n\nAnd then in the movie \"Guinevere,\" you played opposite the actor Stephen Rae,\n\nwho's maybe most famous for his role in \"The Crying Game.\" And, you know, he\n\nplays, like, an older artist who's in his 50s, and you're, you know, a young\n\ngirl about to enter college. And he becomes your mentor and lover, and that's\n\nsomething he always has in his life. He has a string of, like, young girls\n\nwho he's mentored and been lovers with, and it's a very complex, unpredictable\n\nrelationship. Anyways, these are complicated films. So how did you find\n\nthem?\n\nMs. POLLEY: I would say that working with Atom Egoyan is really what made me\n\nfall in love with acting and realize it was something that I wanted to do into\n\nmy adulthood. And I feel like I learned about acting from working in his\n\nfilms. Then, you know, working with an actor like Ian Holm was a really\n\npivotal experience for me in \"The Sweet Hereafter.\" And so I think that, you\n\nknow, I was sort of trained there. I sort of think of those films as my\n\nacting school, \"Exotica\" and \"The Sweet Hereafter.\" And so the rest kind of\n\ncame naturally out of that.\n\nGROSS: I'm glad to hear that Atom Egoyan made you really want to stay an\n\nactress because I like his films so much. But tell me what it was about\n\nworking with him that made you feel more strongly about acting.\n\nMs. POLLEY: There's just such a thoughtfulness to the process of making his\n\nfilms, and there's such intellect behind what he does. And, you know, up to\n\nthat, I'd really done kids shows. You know, It wasn't something that I\n\nthought of as a serious thing to do with your life. I thought, you know, I\n\nwould quit acting, you know, when I was 15 or 16. And, you know, I wanted to\n\ngo to university, and I wanted to get a degree in political science, and I\n\nwanted to run for office. And I thought, like, `This is how you change the\n\nworld.' And I sort of felt like, you know, what he taught me is there's this\n\nway of saying something important that's either directly or indirectly\n\npolitical through films you're making or saying something, you know, sort of\n\nthat has some kind of human importance and that it's a way of being an\n\nactivist in a strange sense. And sometimes it's really clear what that means,\n\nand sometimes it's not. But there's a kind of faith he gave me in films and\n\ntheir ability to change our minds and affect the way we live that really\n\nexcited me.\n\nGROSS: And what about the British actor Ian Holm who you worked with in \"The\n\nSweet Hereafter?\"\n\nMs. POLLEY: Well, that was just--I think working with him and doing scenes\n\nwith him, it's this moment when you're working with certain actors who are so\n\nfocused on what they're doing, so focused on what the other actor is doing\n\nthat you realize there are certain moments that it's sort of worth living a\n\nlife for, where you have a moment of pure, unmitigated communication with\n\nanother human being. And sometimes I feel like those moments were only\n\nuninhibited enough to have those moments when there's artifice of a film set\n\naround us; that when we are shooting a film, we can actually look into each\n\nother's eyes and affect what the other person is saying, affect how the other\n\nperson is reacting and change what they're going to do. And there's something\n\nso intoxicating about that. And I experienced that for the first time with\n\nhim. And, you know, if I would look a certain way in a scene, he would stop\n\nwhat he was saying and look to where I was looking. And that sense of being\n\nso attuned to what another person is doing, I just felt like what a useful\n\nexercise in terms of, you know, learning to be a human being in this world.\n\nGROSS: I love how you describe what Ian Holm was doing, how he was responding\n\nto your every move and probably your every thought. It's so, like, not the\n\negocentric actor who's just thinking, like, `How do I look, and how do I get\n\nthe attention focused on me?'\n\nMs. POLLEY: No. I mean, it's an amazing thing. And to sort of work with\n\nsomeone who's such a sort of brilliant technical actor and so sort of\n\nincredible, who's willing to kind of give it all up based on what the other\n\nactor is doing, even if that actor is, like, a 17-year-old totally\n\ninexperienced young girl, it's a pretty astonishing thing to see, you know.\n\nGROSS: My guest is actress Sarah Polley. She's starring in the new film \"My\n\nLife Without Me.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sarah Polley, and she's starring in the new movie, \"My\n\nLife Without Me.\" She's also starred in \"Exotica,\" \"The Sweet Hereafter,\"\n\n\"Go\" and \"Guinevere.\"\n\nYou had apparently been very close to getting a role in \"Almost Famous,\" the\n\nrole that Kate Hudson played of the groupie Penny Lane, and you decided it\n\nwasn't for you. Do I have that right?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And why did you decide that? Because that's an example of a\n\ncareer-making role.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Mm-hmm. You know, there's a lot of sort of complicated and\n\ndisparate reasons for that. It's a decision that I'll always be really happy\n\nI made. I think it's a really great film, and I think Kate did an amazing\n\njob. And I think that I had an instinct that I was not the right person for\n\nthat part, and so I pulled myself out of it. And when I saw the film, I felt\n\nreally legitimized because I feel she was the right person for that part. And\n\nshe brought a depth to that part that I couldn't see. And I don't know. You\n\nknow, the truth is, like, you know, the last five years of my life, I guess\n\nsince I made that decision, I've worked only on films that I love doing. I\n\nhave a comfortable life. I can't see a way of complaining or having regrets.\n\nAnd the truth is, like, my worst nightmare would be to have Kate Hudson's life\n\nright now, you know. I have this sort of wonderfully anonymous life combined\n\nwith being able to do films that I love. So, you know, it was a sort of\n\nlife-forming decision in a way, but it's always one that I'll be grateful that\n\nI had a clear enough head to make at the time.\n\nGROSS: You don't seem to be into the glamour part of acting.\n\nMs. POLLEY: I don't really know what glamour is. I think that's my problem.\n\nLike, I read this thing in \"The Art of Seeing\" by John Berger that says\n\n`Glamour is the state of being envied.' And that, to me, is so kind of\n\nabstract and so difficult to want. I mean, in a way, I understand why people\n\nwant tons of money, and I understand why people want this and want that. But\n\nfame is something so elusive, and it doesn't really mean anything, except that\n\nwhole bunches of people that you've never met know your name. And it just\n\nseems like a sort of frightening thing to aspire to. It just sort of seems so\n\ndifficult to pin down.\n\nGROSS: Now you said that you really wanted to change the world and that you\n\nfelt when you were young that you'd drop out of acting and study political\n\nscience and, you know, run for office. You actually dropped out of high\n\nschool and not with the intention of acting, but with the intention of\n\nbecoming more political?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah. I had a couple of years where I quit acting and I quit\n\nschool, and I was just really involved in organizing politically. There is a\n\nconservative government that was elected in the province I live in in Ontario,\n\nand they immediately set about, you know, cutting welfare to the point where\n\npeople couldn't really live anymore, cutting funding for the arts, trying to\n\ndismantle our public health care system in order to clear the way for a\n\ntwo-tiered health care system. And it was something where I saw, like, the\n\nthings that I love about Canada and the reason I'm so proud to live there sort\n\nof coming apart and disintegrating before our eyes.\n\nAnd so it was sort of a sense of urgency where I just thought, `I don't think\n\nI can sleep at night unless this is what I'm working towards every day--is\n\nstopping these people.' So I was involved with a lot of anti-poverty\n\norganizations, and I'm involved still with the Toronto Health Coalition in\n\ntrying to sort of preserve public health care because it's been working really\n\nwell. And it's not going to anymore once they set a manufacturer crisis big\n\nenough that they can justify bringing in some private coverage.\n\nGROSS: Now you said that you had a couple of teeth knocked out during a\n\ndemonstration?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, when I was 16, yeah. It was one of the first really large\n\nprotests against the conservative government in Ontario. And, you know, at\n\nthat time in Ontario, police violence to that degree was kind of unheard of.\n\nAnd they sort of brought the riot cops in, and we got trapped between sort of\n\na huge, you know, row of horses and about five lines of riot cops in riot\n\ngear. And I'd been standing on the front lines talking to this cop for about\n\nhalf an hour. There's just a standoff. And, you know, he was saying, `You\n\nknow, when I was your age, I was doing the same thing as you are right now.'\n\nAnd we had this really amazing talk. And I sort of thought naively--I was 16,\n\nyou know--`This is amazing, you know. We can form these bonds across the\n\nbarricades.' And the next thing you know they had the sort of call to push\n\nus off, and I had two teeth knocked out and had my stomach battered in by the\n\nsame guy who I had made this really great connection with. So, yeah, it was\n\ndefinitely a wake-up call.\n\nGROSS: So this is when you were 16?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: What? So this was after the scoliosis operation.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Gee. So, I mean that's a bad time to be getting battered around like\n\nthat.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, I guess so. Thanks for your concern. I don't think\n\nanyone's ever made that connection before.\n\nGROSS: But you were OK?\n\nMs. POLLEY: Yeah, I was fine. It was fine. I mean, the sad thing, again,\n\nabout that and, again, where my sort of sense of not knowing whether or not\n\nit's a great thing to talk about these things in the press is, you know, I was\n\nstanding up there with, you know, nine or 10 welfare moms who were beaten up\n\neight times as badly as I was, who went to the hospital and had stitches.\n\nNobody wrote anything about them. They were never on the radio talking about\n\nit, and it's been totally forgotten. And, you know, this is, I mean, eight\n\nyears later, and I'm still talking about getting my teeth knocked out.\n\nGROSS: Right, yeah.\n\nMs. POLLEY: So there's a certain sense of, like, an imbalance to things and\n\nplaying into something that you fundamentally despise about society that\n\nactors have all this air time and people who need it don't that, you know, I\n\nguess you just have to keep struggling with. I don't know that you can ever\n\nresolve it.\n\nGROSS: You live in Toronto, which is obviously, you know, far from Hollywood.\n\nI'm sure that probably helps in keeping your life as the life that you want it\n\nto be. But do you ever feel too distant from roles or too distant from the\n\npeople making the decisions about roles?\n\nMs. POLLEY: You know, I've been really lucky, and I don't think it's really\n\naffected my career in a negative way. I mean, I'm sure there are things I\n\ndon't know about that may have happened if I had been stationed in LA. But\n\nI'm really happy in Toronto. I have a really great life, and I've been able\n\nto continue to do the films I want to do. So there really is no reason for me\n\nto move. And, you know, I have a community there, and I have family there,\n\nand my life is there, so it's never been something that's really been an issue\n\nfor me, whether or not to move.\n\nGROSS: Well, I want to thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMs. POLLEY: Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Polley stars in the new film \"My Life Without Me.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
