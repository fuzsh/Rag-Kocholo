The team is being led by two-time WNBA MVP Breanna Stewart, who has a game-high 13 points at the half and has made five of her seven shots, including 2-of-3 from three-point range.\n\nNigeria’s Ezinne Kalu is having a game to remember with 12 points at halftime on 67% shooting.\n\nSoufiane El Bakkali takes gold in thrilling 3,000m steeplechase final, US' Kenneth Rooks wins silver\n\nWhat a thrilling finale to tonight’s action here at the Stade de France!\n\nSoufiane El Bakkali charges in the final stretch to win the 3,000-meter steeplechase, chasing down Kenneth Rooks in the final stages after the American had led much of the final lap.\n\nThere’s a big concern on the western side of the track after Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia, who had been among the leaders the entire race, is being tended to by medical staff. Girma failed to clear a barrier about 200 meters from the finish line and landed extremely hard on the track.\n\nThe Ethiopian didn’t get up and laid on the track for several minutes after falling.\n\nHe’s carried off by medical personnel on a backboard and is being taken to the back.\n\nEl Bakkali rings the winners’ bell and goes off on his victory lap, celebrating with the Moroccans here.\n\nNina Kennedy of Australia tops Katie Moon of the USA to take gold in the women's pole vault\n\nAustralia’s Nina Kennedy is going to beat Katie Moon in the pole vault after the American failed two attempts at clearing 4.95 meters.\n\nMoon had failed her first attempt at getting over 4.90 meters and then opted to pass the rest of that height, which meant she only got two opportunities to clear 4.95 meters. Kennedy passed the 4.90-meter height on her first attempt.\n\nKennedy and Moon both failed on their first attempts at 4.95 meters, which meant that it all came down to Moon’s last jump. If she cleared the bar, then Kennedy would have had to match her and clear it herself. But if she missed, she handed the Aussie the gold and would have to settle for silver.\n\nMoon ran down the runway and planted her pole, but just couldn’t get her body over the bar. It fell to the ground and Kennedy began to sob as she was mobbed by her family in the stands.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Australia’s Nina Kennedy.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona wins the gold medal in the discus throw in a major upset\n\nRojé Stona has just ruined the Alekna family’s plan for a party in Paris.\n\nThe Jamaican has topped Mykolas Alekna, the top-ranked discus thrower in the world and the owner of the world record. Stona takes home the gold and the Olympic record that Alekna held for a few short minutes earlier tonight.\n\nAlekna had beaten his father’s Olympic record with a toss of 69.97 meters on his second throw of the competition. But just a bit later, Stona tossed the discus 70 meters even, setting a new Olympic record and doing enough to take home the gold.\n\nThe stage was set for Alekna to top Stona on his final throw, but the disappointing effort fell well short.\n\n“It’s a very special night. It’s everything I wanted, but for it to actually happen, it’s a very good feeling,” Stona said post-final.\n\nStona finished 19th in the world championships in 2023, yet became an Olympic champion one year later, a feat that surprised even the Jamaican.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Jamaica’s Rojé Stona.\n\nMohammadhadi Saravi wins men's 97kg Greco-Roman wrestling gold for Iran\n\nIran’s Mohammadhadi Saravi has beaten Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia 4-1 to take home the gold medal in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling 97kg class.\n\nCuba’s Gabriel Rosillo and Uzur Dzhuzupbekov of Kyrgyzstan took bronze.\n\nTeam USA's Quincy Hall charges down the stretch for an incredible come-from-behind win in the 400 meters\n\nThe competitors are out for the men’s 400-meter final race and American Quincy Hall is the favorite here in an otherwise wide-open race\n\nRunning out of lane eight, Hall seemed to barely get out of a jog during qualifying for this race and feels likely to take home the gold here — possibly with a new world record.\n\nThe gun sounds and they’re off! A massive roar from the Stade de France crowd as 80,000 watch the first gold medal race of the evening.\n\nHall trails most of the race and is in sixth as they come around the final curve. But here comes Hall!\n\nCharging down the final straightaway, Hall makes up ground quickly — the effort written on his face — and he’s suddenly passing runners.\n\nIn the final meters, Hall overtakes Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith in a thrilling finish, beating the Team GB runner to the line by .04 seconds!\n\nOn his unbelievable finish, Hall told reporters afterwards: “I was just thinking, ‘Get home, sir. Get home, sir.’”\n\nAs a result, it’s a gold for Quincy Hall, silver for Hudson-Smith and bronze for Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga.\n\nHall rings the victory bell here at the Stade de France and takes off his shoes to pose for a photo.\n\nHe grabs Old Glory and goes for a shoeless victory lap around the track here, being cheered as he goes. It’s an incredible moment for the American, who ran a personal best and led for only a tenth of a second in the race, leaning across the finish line to take the gold from Hudson-Smith.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team USA’s Quincy Hall.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona tops Mykolas Alekna's Olympic record in the discus, minutes after it was set\n\nAn incredible moment here at the Stade de France!\n\nMere minutes after Lithuania’s Mykolas Alekna beats his father’s Olympic record in the discus throw, Jamaica’s Rojé Stona outdoes him and takes it for himself.\n\nWith an incredible 70-meter throw, Stona is now in the lead for gold and has the Olympic record. It’ll take another Olympic record to top him, but Alekna owns the world record in this competition and will feel like he can do it.\n\nPoland's Natalia Kaczmarek wins third semifinal heat in the women's 400-meter run\n\nNatalia Kaczmarek of Poland is on to the finals after winning the third semifinal heat here in the women’s 400-meter run.\n\nAmber Anning of Great Britain finishes in second.\n\nKaczmarek finishes in 49.45 seconds, Anning in 49.47.\n\nChina beats the USA to gold in enthralling team acrobatic routine final\n\nSome of the best athletes in Paris are competing right now!\n\nThe artistic swimmers representing 10 countries that have qualified for the team acrobatic routine are delighting the packed Saint-Denis Aquatic Center.\n\nJaw dropping synergy and stunts … it’s like watching swimming combined with dance, gymnastics, cheerleading and the endurance of water polo.\n\nTeam USA was thrilled with their performance scoring a 271.3166, which put them in gold medal position for a brief time.\n\nChina followed the USA with a more difficult routine and grabbed gold. USA finishes in silver. Spain in third.\n\nCanada used Snoop Dog music, so clearly the People’s Choice award!\n\nDown to four competitors in the women's pole vault as bar goes up to 4.90 meters\n\nAmálie Švábíková of the Czech Republic is out of the women’s pole vault competition after failing to clear the 4.85-meter bar.\n\nHeading into the 4.90-meter height, only Australian Nina Kennedy, American Katie Moon, Canadian Alysha Newman and Swiss Angelica Moser remain.\n\nMoser decided to pass on her third attempt at 4.85 meters, meaning she has to clear 4.90 meters on her first attempt or else she is eliminated from the competition.\n\nMarileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic crushes the field in second women's 400-meter semi\n\nMarileidy Paulino just ran away from the pack in the second women’s 400-meter semifinal, easily qualifying for the final. She finished in 49.21 seconds.\n\nAlexis Holmes of Team USA finished almost a second later to take the second qualifying spot, running her lap of the track in 50 seconds flat.\n\nNao Kusaka wins gold for Japan in men's 77kg Greco-Roman wrestling\n\nJapan’s Nao Kusaka has won gold in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling 77kg class, beating Demeu Zhadrayev of Kazakhstan on points in the final.\n\nKusaka, the 2023 World Championships bronze medalist, outscored Zhadrayev 5-2.\n\nArmenia’s Malkhas Amoyan and Akzhol Makhmudov of Kyrgyzstan won the bronze medals.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Japan’s Nao Kusaka.\n\nBahrain's Salwa Eid Naser wins first semifinal heat of the women's 400-meter run\n\nSalwa Eid Naser of Bahrain won the first semifinal heat of the women’s 400-meter run, qualifying for the finals with a time of 49.08 seconds.\n\nRhasidat Adeleke of Ireland took the second qualifying spot in the race with a time of 49.95 seconds.\n\nMykolas Alekna breaks his father's Olympic record in the discus throw\n\nMykolas Alekna will take an Olympic record and family bragging rights home from Paris.\n\nAlekna broke his father’s record in the discus throw with a massive second effort, going 69.97 meters. That tops his dad, Virgilijus Alekna, who had a 69.89 throw 20 years ago in Athens.\n\nThe world record holder was always the favorite tonight, but now he’s got a record under his belt and four more attempts to lengthen it.\n\nField set for the men's 200-meter run final on Thursday\n\nThe field is set in the men’s 200-meter run, with the final scheduled for Thursday night at the Stade de France.\n\nHere’s the lineup:\n\nMakanakaishe Charamba of Zimbabwe\n\nTapiwanashe Makarawu of Zimbabwe\n\nKenneth Bednarek of USA\n\nNoah Lyles of USA\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana\n\nErriyon Knighton of USA\n\nAlexander Ogando of Dominican Republic\n\nJoseph Fahnbulleh of Liberia\n\nWomen's pole vault field narrows to 5 as the height increases\n\nThe women’s pole vault field was once 20 — and it’s now down to five.\n\nWilma Murto of Finland, Aikaterini Stefanidi of Greece, Elisa Molinarolo of Italy and Eliza McCartney of New Zealand all failed to clear 4.80 meters, and their Olympics are over.\n\nAmalie Svabikova of the Czech Republic cleared the 4.80-meter bar on her third and final attempt, allowing her the opportunity to go after 4.85 meters, which is the next height.\n\nSo far, Katie Moon of Team USA is in pole position to win the gold, having not missed a jump yet. World No. 1 Nina Kennedy missed one attempt at 4.7 meters, which could cost the Australian at the end of the competition.\n\nThe first tiebreaker, should two competitors both fail to clear a height on three attempts, is based on the number of misses earlier in the competition. The athlete with the fewest number of misses wins the tie break.\n\nMykolas Alekna leads the field in the men's discus throw after the first round\n\nWorld record holder and favorite Mykolas Alekna of Lithuania leads the field here after each competitor throws their first of six attempts in the men’s discus championship.\n\nAlekna, who is looking to achieve the same feat that his father did in 2000 and 2004 with a gold medal, tossed his discus 68.55 meters to pace the field.\n\nEach thrower gets six chances to throw the discus and the longest toss wins.\n\nTeam USA's Erriyon Knighton wins his 200-meter run semifinal heat\n\nA third American is headed for the finals of the 200-meter run.\n\nErriyon Knighton wins this third and final semifinal heat with a time of 20.09 seconds in a come-from-behind effort, where he made up ground in the straightaway.\n\nLiberia’s Joseph Fahnbulleh takes the second qualifying spot with a time of 20.12 seconds. Zimbabwe’s Tapiwanashe Makarawu is going to be disappointed not to take that second spot after leading into the final 50 meters but fading at the very end.\n\nWhat we're watching tonight in track and field at the Stade de France\n\nBonsoir from the Stade de France outside Paris where four gold medals are up for grabs tonight in track and field.\n\nHere’s what we’re watching tonight:\n\nMen’s 200-meter run semifinals: American Noah Lyles is back on the track after winning the 100-meter sprint on Sunday night, looking to cruise into the finals of the race that is his specialty. Lyles is looking to get three — maybe four — gold medals at these Games.\n\nWomen’s pole vault: It’s a showdown between world No. 1 Nina Kennedy of Australia and No.2 Katie Moon of the USA. Kennedy and Moon have had epic showdowns in the past, including sharing the world championship last year in this competition.\n\nMen’s discus throw: Mykolas Alekna of Lithuania is looking to take the gold, having set the world record in this contest earlier this year. If he’s able to do that, he’ll match the feat that his father, Virgilijus Alekna, accomplished in 2000 and 2004. Mykolas will undoubtedly be looking to break his father’s Olympic record throw of 69.89 meters as well, which is almost five meters shorter than his current world record.\n\nMen’s 400-meter run: American Quincy Hall is debuting in the Olympics and looking to potentially set a new world record after easily qualifying for the final with a 43.95-second time. The current world and Olympic record was set in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro by South Africa’s Wayde van Niekerk.\n\nMen’s 3,000-meter steeplechase: Runners will need to go over large barriers and through water to win this one. World No. 1 Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco will hope to get gold, but world record holder Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia will also be on the hunt.\n\nHome favorite Céline Boutier leads after first round of women’s golf tournament\n\nHome favorite Céline Boutier has a three-shot lead after the first round of the women’s golf tournament in Paris.\n\nBoutier shot a seven-under-par 65 comprised of eight birdies and just one bogey to seal her spot at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nThe Frenchwoman sits first with South Africa’s Ashleigh Buhai second after carding a four-under-par 68.\n\nFour golfers – Gaby López, Morgane Metraux, Mariajo Uribe and Lilia Vu – sit in third at two under.\n\nIt proved a tricky day of golf at Le Golf National with only 12 players of the 60-strong field recording scores under par.\n\nWorld No. 1 and reigning champion Nelly Korda finished the day on level par.\n\nAustralia's Keegan Palmer successfully defends his men's park skateboarding title\n\nKeegan Palmer is the last skater to complete his third run in the men’s park final, but he’s already got the gold medal in the bag.\n\nPalmer’s first run score of 93.11 is enough to top the leaderboard, successfully defending his title from Tokyo three years ago. The other competitors are clearly delighted for the Australian, embraced him before and after his final run.\n\nUSA’s Tom Schaar, who showed excellent consistency throughout the final, wins silver with 92.23, while Brazil’s Augusto Akio takes bronze with a score of 91.85.\n\nSnoop Dogg drops in on the skateboarding\n\nWe’re into the closing stages of the men’s park skateboarding final and it’s still Keegan Palmer who leads.\n\nThe Australian tops the standings with a big score of 93.11, ahead of USA’s Tom Schaar and Brazil’s Augusto Akio, who celebrated his third run by jumping off his skateboard and juggling with three juggling clubs.\n\nSnoop Dogg has also made an appearance, walking around the edge of the concrete bowl and greeting some of the competitors.\n\nHe’s been a constant presence throughout these Games, carrying the Olympic torch at the opening ceremony and also being involved with NBCUniversal’s coverage.\n\n“Amazing event,” Snoop said about the skateboarding. “I got to see Tony Hawk and the skaters. And a bunch of good kids doing their thing.”\n\nPressed to reveal his favorite Olympic sport, Snoop remained impartial: “All of them,” he responded.\n\nUS figure skating team finally receives Beijing 2022 gold medals in ceremony under the Eiffel Tower\n\nThey say good things come to those that wait – and the wait has certainly been worth it for the USA’s figure skating team.\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the US finished second behind the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) in the team event, with Japan coming third.\n\nHowever, after Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva had a doping test come back positive for the performance-enhancing substance trimetazidine, no medals were awarded.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) then handed down a decision to disqualify Valieva of “all competitive results” achieved since her positive test, and announced the US and Japan would move up to first and second respectively.\n\nInstead of receiving their medals in front of empty stands in Beijing, though, Team USA had their golds placed around their necks at a packed Champions Park in Paris today.\n\nA huge roar went up from the crowd as the skaters held their medals and bouquets aloft.\n\nThe Japanese team members – who were awarded their silver medals alongside the USA and emerged from the tunnel with beaming smiles while doing the conga – stepped off the platform to allow the Americans to have their gold medal moment.\n\nRead more about the controversial saga surrounding the 2022 figure skating medals here.\n\nDefending champion Keegan Palmer leads men's park skateboarding final after first run\n\nThe men’s park skateboarding final is underway at Place de La Concorde and it’s Australian Keegan Palmer, the defending champion in this event, who leads with a big score of 93.11.\n\nAs he comes out of the bowl, Palmer gets a big hug from Tate Carew, the world’s top-ranked skater who’s clearly impressed with what he’s seen.\n\nUSA’s Tom Schaar is the only other person to complete a run, scoring 90.11.\n\nEach competitor has three runs in total with their highest score counting towards the final standings.\n\nLi Fabin successfully defends men’s 61kg weightlifting title, setting Olympic record along the way\n\nChina’s Li Fabin successfully defended his men’s 61kg weightlifting title on Wednesday, as he set a new Olympic record along the way.\n\nThe 31-year-old lifted 143kg in the snatch portion of the contest for the Olympic record – Fabin also holds the world record of 146kg in that discipline for his weight category.\n\nFabin then was able to lift 167kg in the clean and jerk portion before failing at his attempt at 172kg.\n\nNevertheless, Fabin was able to hold onto his Olympic gold, which he won in Tokyo three years ago with a combined score of 310.\n\nTheerapong Silachai of Thailand won silver with 303 points while Team USA’s Hampton Morris won bronze with 298.\n\nThere was drama with the last attempt of the event as Morris, who already had bronze wrapped up, aimed for silver with a world record attempt at a 178kg clean and jerk – he holds the current record at 176kg.\n\nHaving successfully performed the clean aspect of the lift, Morris couldn’t quite maintain the jerk part. Although Morris was clearly disappointed, he left the stage with a smile and loud applause from the crowd at his effort.\n\nLéon Marchand tells CNN what goes through his mind before a race\n\nNo matter where Léon Marchand goes, a mass hysteria tends to follow.\n\nThe support reached its peak when France’s new hero was competing for medals inside Paris’ La Defense Arena, a venue which generated arguably the best atmosphere of the Games so far.\n\nBut amid all the swirling noise and electric energy, there was still a swimmer bidding to do his best against a world-class field of rivals.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, Marchand explained what went through his mind as he stood poised on the starting blocks at this year’s Olympics.\n\n“The pool was really noisy, I was trying to focus on myself, keep building my energy up,” he said.\n\n“When I got on [the starting block], I thought about what I did in the last few years. A lot of work, really hard.\n\nAustralia’s Matt Wearn retains his men's dinghy Olympic gold after weather disrupted medal race\n\nAustralia’s Matt Wearn retained his men’s dinghy sailing Olympic title on Wednesday after a weather-disrupted medal race in Marseille.\n\nWearn, who had been the overall fleet leader heading into the medal race, was made to wait after it had to be resailed due to the weather in southern France.\n\nBut when it eventually got back underway, the 28-year-old made no doubt of his gold medal by winning the medal race to finish on 40 points, finishing five seconds ahead of Cyprus’ Pavlos Kontides in second on 56 points.\n\nWearn becomes the first man to win back-to-back gold medals in this format of sailing.\n\nIt was a momentous silver medal for Kontides, who claims Cyprus’s second ever Olympic medal in any sport – Kontides won the other one as a silver medalist in London in 2012.\n\nBronze went to Peru’s Stefano Peschiera, who won the South American nation’s first Olympic medal in any sport since 1992.\n\nFrance's Léon Marchand explains why his parents didn't initially want him to pursue a swimming career\n\nLéon Marchand is arguably the best swimmer in the world right now, but it could have been so very different.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Coy Wire, the Frenchman said his parents initially weren’t keen on him starting a swimming career.\n\nBoth his mother and father swam in the Olympic Games, so were aware of how much work was required to compete at the very top level.\n\nThankfully, Marchand didn’t listen and the rest is history.\n\nSwimming superstar Léon Marchand tells CNN how the Paris crowd inspired his Olympic success\n\nThe sight of Léon Marchand flying through the pool, to the deafening sound of the Paris crowd cheering him on, will be one of the lasting memories of this year’s Olympics.\n\nSwimming’s latest superstar won a total of five medals – four gold and one bronze – at his home Games and became a household name as a result.\n\n“It was amazing. The first day was definitely the most impressive for me. I just came on the pool side and the whole pool was cheering for me,” he told CNN’s Coy Wire.\n\nOut of all his races, Marchand said the 200m butterfly final was his favorite.\n\nHe beat world record holder Kristóf Milák in a tense battle which almost blew the roof off Paris’ La Défense Arena.\n\nMarit Bouwmeester creates history with gold in women’s dinghy while men’s medal race is abandoned\n\nMarit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands became the most successful woman in Olympic sailing as she won her fourth medal on Wednesday, winning the women’s dinghy gold.\n\nShe finished fourth in the medal race – the race had been delayed until winds picked up – but her 38 points were enough to ensure she left Marseille as an Olympic champion again.\n\n“I should have probably gone for the win a bit more,” she said after the race. “It was quite hard because I’ve already seen family and I spent some time with my daughter, but it was nice being out there, nice to see the fight, and it was a good race.\n\n“It’s incredible. I’m so proud. I always say the big example is when people dominate and change the sport and not do it once, but do it multiple times, and to be one of them is incredible.”\n\nThe 36-year-old now has two golds – the other coming 8 years ago in Rio – one silver and a bronze medal to her name.\n\nDenmark’s Anne-Marie Rindom won silver with 61 points, while Line Flem Hoest of Norway claimed bronze with 75.\n\nMeanwhile, the men’s dinghy race was abandoned midway through due to weather.\n\nThe sailors were heading to the third mark when race control flew the blue and white checkered flag to signal racing should be stopped. According to Olympics.com, the resailing has been delayed due to weather.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from The Netherlands’ Marit Bouwmeester.\n\nThis 51-year-old proved that age is just a number in a field full of teenagers\n\nSkateboarding at this year’s Olympic Games has seen some of sport’s best and brightest talent shine on the world’s biggest stage.\n\nFourteen-year-old Arisa Trew won gold in the women’s skateboarding park event on Tuesday. The event also saw 15-year-old Cocona Hiraki finish second and 16-year-old Sky Brown complete the podium with a bronze medal.\n\nIn the men’s skateboarding park event, there is also a competitor defying the odds and age-based expectations – just at the complete other end of the spectrum. What he lacks in youthful exuberance, 51-year-old Andy Macdonald more than makes up for in experience.\n\nMacdonald, representing Great Britain at the Olympics, is somewhat of a skateboarding icon. He has a record 23 X-Games medals in skateboarding, has skateboarded through the White House and is also good friends with the iconic Tony Hawk – who made the trip to Paris to see Macdonald skate.\n\nWhile Macdonald did not advance to the men’s park final, he seemed to have a brilliant time skating in front of a packed crowd and proved to millions around the world that age is just a number.\n\n“Nobody can take our home.\" Ukrainian fencer talks about the extra burden when competing at Games\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tanks and troops into Ukraine in February 2022, it triggered Europe’s largest land invasion since World War II.\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years later, the war grinds on with Ukrainians fighting a battle for survival and trying to push Russian forces out of their country.\n\nAfter missing out on a medal at the last Games in Tokyo in 2021, the world of Ukrainian fencer Olga Kharlan – and that of her countrymen and women – was turned upside down.\n\nKharlan, competing at her fifth Olympic Games, is making up for lost time in Paris.\n\nDays after the opening ceremony, she claimed a dramatic individual bronze medal, rallying from a six-point deficit to beat South Korea’s Choi Se-bin and hand her country its first medal at the 2024 Games.\n\nIt served as a tonic for her to put on a brilliant performance and lead Ukraine to a stunning comeback win against South Korea for the country’s first gold in Paris.\n\nRead more about Kharlan’s decision not to shake hands with a Russian fencer\n\nRecord-breaking 14-year-old skateboard gold medalist reveals gift she asked for if she won Olympic title\n\nWin an Olympic gold medal and some might want a new car or a new phone from their parents or sponsors. But for 14-year-old Arisa Trew, she had a different gift in mind.\n\nTrew, who won skateboarding gold in the women’s park event to become Australia’s youngest ever Olympic champion, revealed that she’d asked her parents for a pet duck if she won the Olympic title.\n\n“My dad’s been like saying yes this whole time, but my mom was saying no,” she told 10 Sport. “But then I said, ‘If I did win, could I get a duck?’ And she said yes.”\n\nWhat does someone do with a pet duck? Well, Trew already has some ideas in mind. “I’m going to take the duck to the skate park as well and take it on walks.”\n\nBut aside from the promise of a mallard mascot, just having her parents in Paris has been reward enough.\n\n“It was really cool having my parents here because I was just really excited to have them there and watch me skate because they’ve been there through all my training,” she said.\n\n“They’ve taken me to the skate park at like 9 p.m. some nights. It’s just like late night and all this effort and them supporting me through it all, taking me everywhere around the world. It’s just amazing to have them see what I’ve done.”\n\nTrew also revealed that members of her skateboarding school back in Australia, Level Up, slept out in the skate park to watch her win gold.\n\nKatie Ledecky tells CNN what she plans to do after retiring from competition one day\n\nKatie Ledecky is only 27 years old, so has many more years of racing ahead of her. But, inevitably, her reign of dominance will have to end one day.\n\nThe American swimmer, though, told CNN that she wants to stay involved in the sport for as long as possible, even after retiring.\n\nGiven she is one of the greatest swimmers in history – not to mention the most decorated female US Olympian of all time – few would be better placed to take up a coaching role in Team USA.\n\nHowever, having seen the sacrifices her own team makes to help her achieve her dreams, she’s unsure whether a career as a coach is for her. Although, she didn’t totally rule it out.\n\n“I’ll always be attached to swimming in some respect,” she added.\n\nKatie Ledecky tells CNN what her parents sacrificed to support her remarkable career\n\nBehind every Olympian stands a support network that has had to make sacrifices for their loved one to achieve on the global stage.\n\nFor Katie Ledecky, it was her parents who helped lay the foundations for her incredible career.\n\nIn her interview with CNN, the American swimmer paid tribute to those early years when her parents would wake up at the crack of dawn to ferry their child to training.\n\nLedecky comes from a family of high-achievers.
