        "text": "LAKELAND -- Joanne Martin is desperately trying to coax her 6-year-old daughter out of a furious temper tantrum.\n\n\"Amanda, do you want a Popsicle? Why don't you come play with your toys?\" the Lakeland mother suggests brightly. \"Want to come sit over here with me?\" Amanda continues to howl. Mom is tense and counts to 10.\n\nThis is typically when Martin's husband, Thomas, would step in and take over, either by getting stern with Amanda or by distracting her with one of their nightly tickle games.\n\nBut Thomas Martin isn't here. The 38-year-old staff sergeant is in Kuwait, serving with an Army National Guard unit in Brooksville. And that means Joanne has to deal with Amanda's rage all by herself.\n\n\"I want Daddy!\" Amanda sobs, climbing into her mother's arms.\n\nJoanne Martin sighs. \"Well, I want him too,\" she says wearily.\n\nAs Joanne Martin knows only too well, the war in Iraq hasn't just sent soldiers overseas; it has also created thousands of temporary single-parent families.\n\nAs soldiers are deployed, spouses used to living in two-parent families are finding themselves solely responsible for everything from child care and finances to home repair and car maintenance. And that's on top of the constant emotional stress of worrying about their spouses' safety.\n\n\"When you're part of a two-parent unit and all of a sudden half of that unit is gone, and . they're in harm's way, it's extraordinarily hard,\" said Kim Herndon, the family assistance coordinator for the National Guard's 1st Battalion of the 171st Regiment headquartered at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga.\n\n\"It's a very stressful, difficult position for many of these wives.\" More than 630,000 members of the armed services are parents, and there are about 1.2 million military children, according to the Military Family Resource Center in Arlington, Va.\n\nWhen one of those parents is called to duty, the burden of child care typically falls on the spouses, many of whom have little or no support from family members or friends.\n\n\"It was just hard. I had to drop my classes and come home,\" said Shelliann Atmore, a Lake Wales mother whose husband, Army Spc. Anthony Atmore, 24, is serving with the 57th Signal Battalion, 3rd Signal Brigade in Baghdad. \"I couldn't manage it on my own.\" The Atmores were living in Texas near Fort Hood Army Base when Anthony Atmore was called up in January. For five months, 23-year-old Shelliann Atmore tried to hold down a job, go to nursing school and take care of the couple's 18-month-old son, Elijah, by herself.\n\nIn May, she gave up and returned to Lake Wales, where she lives with her husband's parents, Johnnie and Anthony Atmore.\n\n\"I was trying to stay (in Texas), but I said it was too much for me to handle myself. I just came home,\" she said. \"I was always afraid . the fear of something happening to (Elijah) and not having somebody to help me.\"\n\nTaking on new role\n\nFor much of the Martins' 12-year marriage, Tom Martin has managed the family's finances, taken care of the house, yard and the couple's two cars, been the family cook, and helped Joanne Martin take care of their girls.\n\nNow, it's Joanne Martin who takes the family car in to get an oil change. She's the one paying the bills. And she's the one solely responsible for Amanda and 21/2year-old Emily.\n\n\"People say to me, 'Oh, it's just like being divorced,'\" said Joanne Martin, 37. \"It's not. In a divorce situation, you mutually agree to separate. But when you're married and you love each other and you're separated, it's very difficult.\" She copes by simply doing the best she can.\n\nShe avoids unnecessary complications -- she'll wait until Thomas gets home before she works on weaning Emily off her pacifier.\n\nShe sticks to easy meals, such as peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches and pizza.\n\nAnd she's learning the particulars of home maintenance largely by trial and error. She recently discovered that she hadn't changed the air filter in the family's air conditioning unit since December.\n\nBut if day-to-day responsibilities are a burden, out-of-the-ordinary events are simply overwhelming.\n\nLast year, the Smith family of Winter Haven started construction on a new house -- one that wasn't finished when Chief Warrant Officer David Smith, 40, of the Army National Guard's 1171st Aviation Battalion was called to serve in Iraq.\n\nThat meant his wife, Wendy Smith, had to close on their new house, sell their old house, supervise moving -- and provide for the couple's three teenage girls, Rebecca, 19, Georgia, 16, and Savanna, 14.\n\n\"We were in the process of having a new home built. Would we have done that, if we knew he wasn't going to be here? I don't know,\" said Wendy Smith, 43.\n\nThe Smith family is a military family -- David Smith has been in the National Guard for 22 years -- and they're used to handling things on their own. But this is the longest he's been away, and Wendy Smith says she finds herself praying that nothing major happens while he's gone.\n\n\"Every phone call, every single crisis, you just hope and pray that it's not a a major one,\" she said. \"People see you struggling and they say, 'Well, you knew this was going to happen. He volunteered.' You kind of get a cold shoulder sometimes.\" Still, she doesn't unload on her husband when he calls.\n\n\"We've had a few things that have happened that he doesn't know about yet. He doesn't need to worry about it,\" she said. \"He has a bigger mission to fulfill right now.\"\n\nHelp from the military\n\nThe military has many resources in place to help families cope while service members are overseas. There are chaplains and social workers readily available, counseling programs for parents and children, referral services, baby-sitting programs and other resources.\n\nThe people running these programs encourage military families to get in touch with each other and utilize these programs.\n\n\"People who have been involved in deployments longer can share some insight with spouses who are new at it,\" said Joyce Raezor, director of government relations for the National Military Family Association, a resource organization for military families in Alexandria, Va. \"You don't have to identify, you don't have to explain the problems, people know what you're going through.\" But most of those resources are primarily available through military bases, making it hard if the family lives off base.\n\nAnd even the most well-intentioned program can't do everything.\n\n\"They try, but there's never anything compared to having your husband being there with you,\" said Shelliann Atmore. \"Helping me is bringing my husband back home instead of having him stay there for a year.\" Some families have found ways to take advantage of available resources while living off base. Others seek the help of friends and family.\n\nOthers, like Joanne Martin, simply soldier on, finding strength they didn't know they had.\n\nDespite her difficulties, she is managing. She holds down a fulltime job at the North Lakeland Wal-Mart. She still shuttles her kids to school and day care and ballet lessons.\n\nAnd she is teaching them to be patriotic -- the girls helped her wrap the family's sycamore trees in wide yellow ribbon, and they track Tom Martin's location on a large wall map in their living room.\n\nJoanne Martin talks to them every day about why their dad is gone.\n\n\"Where's Daddy?\" she asks.\n\n\"He's in the desert,\" Amanda replies.\n\n\"What's he doing there?\" Joanne Martin prompts.\n\n\"He's fighting the bad guys,\" Amanda says solemnly.\n\nEvery night, she and her girls go outside and blow kisses to the moon. Joanne Martin taught them that the moon is the same moon their daddy sees in Kuwait, and they count on it to deliver their kisses to the other side of the world.\n\n\"When the moon comes out we say, 'Hello Daddy! Good night Daddy!'\" Amanda says, gesturing.\n\nAnd when they get up in the morning, the Martin girls are one day closer to their daddy's safe return."
