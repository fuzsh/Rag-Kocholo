        "text": "A magician accused of murdering a university lecturer went to counselling after the death to deal with his \"feelings\", a trial heard.\n\nMartyn Smith, 32, is accused of helping PhD student Benjamin Field, 28, in the murder of Peter Farquhar, 69, and conspiring to murder retired headmistress Ann Moore-Martin, 83.\n\nMr Farquhar was found dead at his home in Maids Moreton, Bucks in 2015.\n\nMr Smith said he went to counselling \"to process\" the death.\n\nMs Moore-Martin died from natural causes in 2017.\n\nThe prosecution at Oxford Crown Court alleges Mr Field gave Mr Farquhar alcohol and benzodiazepines, and if the combined effect did not kill him, then suffocating him with a pillow did.\n\nJurors heard the motive was \"financial gain\", and that Mr Smith was \"enthralled\" by Mr Field and became greedy while assisting him.\n\n'Daily counselling'\n\nMr Smith said he had left the bottle of alcohol in the home of Mr Farquhar - who was going through a period of not drinking - because it did not fit into his rucksack.\n\nAsked by Timothy Moloney QC if he felt guilty about leaving the bottle and if he blamed himself, Mr Smith said he did.\n\nMr Smith said he went to counselling on a daily basis for \"maybe a couple of weeks\" after the death.\n\n\"I felt I needed to talk to somebody,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr Field and Mr Smith, 32, deny charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and possession of an article for the use in fraud.\n\nMr Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, also denies an alternative charge of attempted murder, but has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary.\n\nIn addition, Mr Smith, of Penhalvean in Redruth, Cornwall, denies two charges of fraud and one of burglary.\n\n24-year-old Tom Field, Benjamin Field's brother, also of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies a single charge of fraud."
