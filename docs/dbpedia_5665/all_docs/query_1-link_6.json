        "text": "On the 24th August 1914 he was one of forty men who volunteered to help an artillery gun crew. Members of the Royal Field Artillery had been trapped by enemy gunfire at Elouges, in Mons, and many of their crew and horses had been injured or killed. The crew needed to move their guns but couldn’t do so without assistance, so forty volunteers from the 9th Queen’s Royal Lancers, including Smith, helped to move these guns out of range of enemy gunfire and save the lives of the surviving crew. Smith was Mentioned in Despatches for his bravery but sadly died of his woulds on the 10th September 1914.\n\nCreated by: , Harriet142532"
