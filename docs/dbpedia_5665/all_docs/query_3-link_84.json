Chapter 5 (“Helen and the Men in Her Life”) has a natural coherence, and Ridd accommodates his diverse materials, seeing past glib evaluations of Helen and Menelaus in Odyssey 4 as merely exemplary hosts, andexposing their brittle, passive-aggressive relationship. Vergil’s Helen balances her place as the instigator of the Trojan War against her problematic association with Venus in the Roman “grand narrative” (Vergil really has remarkably little to say about her character as such). Chapter 7 (“Communicating with the Dead”) explores a topic deeply rooted in all three poems; it would make a useful addition to an undergraduate reading list on ancient epic. It makes explicit a number of differences between the various encounters between the living and the dead in all three poems. I found myself wanting togothroughthe passages again—certainly agoodconsequence for any critical work.

Pp. 290. Hardback, $34.95.ISBN 9781473823181. The history of interpersonal violence is a topic that has garnered much scholarly attention, as the effects of violence can be perceived in many different categories of archaeological evidence ranging from the material to the biological. Smith’s bookfocuses on the latter since itaims toexplore whathuman remains can reveal about violent conflict.1 Using examples ranging from the Paleolithic period to the 1 For other recent scholarship on forensic anthropological and bioarchaeological approaches to interpersonalviolence, seeE. H. Kimmerle and J. P. Baraybar(eds.), SkeletalTrauma: Identification of Injuries Resulting from Human Rights Abuse and Armed Conflict (London, 2008); D. L. Martin, R. P. Harrod and V. R. Pérez (eds.), The Bioarchaeology of Violence (Gainesville, 2012); C. Knüsel and M. Smith (eds.), The Routledge Handbook of the Bioarchaeology of Human Conflict (London, 2013); D. L. Martin and C. P. Anderson (eds.), Bioarchaeological and Forensic Perspectives on Violence: How Violent Death is Interpreted from Skeletal Remains (Cambridge, 374 BOOKREVIEWS 19th century, special emphasis is placed on ritual violence, the treatment of prisoners of war and non-combatants, the role of war in social change and the demographyof war,among other subjects. The book is organizedinto12 chapters that are bookended by an introduction and a conclusion. The introduction, entitled “Introduction: ‘The Best Available Evidence,’” briefly discusses the archaeology of human conflict, states the author’s aims and summarizes the chapters that follow. The initial chapters are geared towards non-specialists: Chapter 1, “‘I See Dead People’: The Human Body as Archaeology,” serves as a primer on human skeletal analysis while Chapter 2, “The Fragile Body: Recognizing Injuries to the Skeleton,” describes the ways in whichskeletal injuries can be recognizedandinterpreted. The remaining chapters present chronological surveys of human violence, with Chapters 3 through 8 focusing on prehistoric material. Chapter 3, “The Earliest Times: Violence in the Deep Past,” describes the earliest extant evidence for hominid and human interpersonal conflict, which includes weapons (e.g., clubs and hafted spears) as well as incidences of skeletal trauma (e.g., blunt-force and sharp-force injuries). Chapter 4, “Rolling Back the Temporal Frontier: Modern Humans and the Origins of War?” argues that although group skirmishes were perhaps always an aspect of human existence, organized warfare likely has its origins in the Upper Paleolithic period (around 50,000 to 10,000 years ago). The next two chapters, Chapter 5, “Out from the Cold: Mesolithic Hostilities?” and Chapter 6, “‘The Children of Cain:’ Conflict in the Neolithic,” discuss skeletal evidence of violence dating to the Mesolithic Period (around 15,000 to 5,000 years ago) and Neolithic Period (around 4,500 to 2,000 years ago) respectively. In Chapter 7, “Cutting-Edge Technology: Violence in Bronze Age Europe,” the author explores an interesting paradox—while the invention of bronze in the Bronze Age (around 3200 to 600 BCE in Europe) revolutionized warfare andallowedfor the developmentof a“material culture of violence” (107) comprised of specialized weapons and defensive gear, the actual incidence of violent deaths does not appear to be..."
