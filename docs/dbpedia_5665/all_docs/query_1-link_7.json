        "text": "Abstract: Reflections on the Kachin Ceasefire: A Cycle of Hope and Disappointment\n\nThe cycle of hope and disappointment in Kachin ceasefire history is reflective of the deep challenges in national politics that have underpinned conflict and state failure in Burma/Myanmar since independence from Great Britain in 1948. Based upon the author’s experiences, this chapter seeks to outline the key trends in Kachin and national politics during the turbulent events of the past three decades – from the peace vision of the late KIO leader Maran Brang Seng, through the ceasefire years, to the return to armed conflict in June 2011.\n\nFollowing the 1994 ceasefire, civil society started to revive in many districts across the Kachin and northern Shan states, and there was an escalation in initiatives by faith-based and non-governmental organisations to rebuild communities and address the legacies of conflict. But, with the years passing by, frustrations grew as the ceasefire was widely seen to fail to deliver on promises of meaningful change. There were many contributory factors to the lack of progress and sense of deficiency. These included the failure to agree political reform; continued dominance by the military authorities; lack of unity among Kachin-based parties; changing regional geo-politics; the exploitation of natural resources by government, Chinese and vested interests; increased narcotics production; and the spread of HIV, poverty and other social crises among communities who saw no improvement in the quality of their lives.\n\nThe chapter argues that the eventual ceasefire breakdown was not for a want of trying to achieve peace. Rather, during a time of transitional crisis, it is important to understand how a diversity of Kachin and other national actors sought to embark on initiatives to end the enduring state of conflict and socio-political malaise within the country. As the struggle for peace and democracy continues in Burma today, the lessons from the ceasefire years are vital not only for ethnic inclusion and political reform within the country but they also have resonance for marginalised peoples and states in conflict around the world.\n\nAreas of policy relevance in this chapter\n\nCivil society\n\nConflict resolution\n\nEconomic policy\n\nEthnic identity\n\nHumanitarian issues\n\nPolitical development\n\nQuestions for further work ...\n\nWhat challenges in state formation have caused ethnic conflict in the Kachin region and Burma/Myanmar to become so protracted?\n\nHow did Kachin society change or evolve during the experiences of ceasefire and why did a pan-Kachin political movement not develop?\n\nIn economic terms, who were the real winners and losers during the years of ceasefire, and does this provide lessons for peace processes, economic planning and national development in the future?\n\nDuring the transition from the Than Shwe to Thein Sein administrations, what were the strategies by the central government with regards political, economic and military developments in the Kachin and northern Shan states? Were ceasefire breakdowns an inevitable consequence or a possibility that had been factored in?\n\nLooking back over Kachin ceasefire history, what conclusions need to be drawn for peace processes, national reconciliation and political reform in Burma/Myanmar in the future? When examining the experiences of the Kachins in Burma/Myanmar, is there any international resonance with other “ethnic\" conflicts elsewhere in the world?\n\nComments\n\nImages\n\nBelow are some of the author's photographs that help illustrate some issues in the chapter.\n\nResources"
