        "text": "Touching the common ground in each Tribe, as also the ouer-plus, you may finde that at large in the Booke of Surueyes amongst their Records.\n\nThe first Magazin. 1618.\n\nNow though the Countrey was small, yet they could not conueniently haue beene disposed and well setled, without a true description and a suruey of it; and againe, euery man being setled where he might constantly abide, they knew their businesse, and fitted their household accordingly: then they built no more Cabbens, but substantiall houses, they cleered their grounds, and planted not onely such things as would yeeld them their fruits in a few moneths, but also such as would affoord them profit within a few yeares, so that in a short time the Countrey began to aspire, and neerely approach vnto that happinesse and prosperitie, wherein now it flourisheth, &c.\n\nTwo exploits of desperate Fugitiues.\n\nBut to follow the History; vpon the best plot of ground could be found, the Gouernor preuailed so much with the generalitie, they built a faire house of Cedar, which being done, he appropriated it to himselfe, which occasioned exceeding much distaste. About this time arriued the Diana with a good supply of men and prouision, and the first Magazin euer seene in those Iles; which course is not so much commended here, as cursed and abhorred by reason of enhansements of all the lnhabitants there; six or seuen weeks this ship staied, then hauing towards her fraught thirtie thousand weight of Tobacco; which prouing good, and comming to a lucky Market, gaue great encouragement to the Aduenturers to goe lustily forward in their Plantation, and without such successe, there is nothing but grudging and repining. But about the appropriation of this new built house, many bad discontents grew betwixt the oppressed Colony and the Gouernor, especially betwixt him and the Minister, and Lewes, who would neither be feared with threats nor imprisonment, that their malice continued till they met in England, of which the Minister made the cause so plaine, hee very well and honestly it seemes, discharged himselfe.\n\nThe arriuall of the Blessing.\n\nNow in those times of these endlesse vnciuill broiles, two desperate men and a proper Gentlewoman got into a Boat, and thinking to make an escape to Virginia, as appeared by some Letters they left behinde them were neuer more heard on. The very next moneth after the like was attempted by six others, so desirous they were to be rid of their seruitude; but their plot being discouered by one of their societie, they were apprehended, arraigned, and condemned to be hanged: the next day being led with halters about their neckes to the place of execution, one was hanged, and the rest repriued.\n\nThe Diana arriuing well in England, for all the infinite numbers of complaints, the Tobacco did helpe to sweeten all manner of grieuances, yet it bred a distaste in the opinions of so many, they began to thinke of another Gouernor; but for that time it was so qualified by diuers of his friends, they dispatched away the Blessing, which arriued in the Somer Iles. Though their generall Letter was faire and courteous to the Gouernor, yet by the report of the Passengers and diuers particular letters from his friends, it was assured him his cruelty and couetousnesse, for all his paines and industry was much disliked, nor was he like to enjoy his\n\nPage 190\n\nhouse, and that land he had planted for himselfe, by the extreme oppression of the Comminalty. This caused so many ielousies to arise in his conceit, that at last he fully resolued to returne by this ship, that no sooner set saile from England, then they proceeded to the nomination of a new Gouernor. Many were presented according to the affections of those that were to giue in their voices, but it chiefely rested betwixt one Captaine Southwell, and one Mr Nathaniel Butler, where wee will leaue them a while to the consideration of the Court and Company. Now Captaine Tuckar hauing instituted Captaine Kendall one of the six Gouernors before spoken of for his substitute, returned with this ship directly for England, as well to excuse himselfe of those obiections he suspected, as to get assured him the house and land he had alotted for himselfe, lest it might otherwise be disposed of in his absence.\n\nCollected out of their Records by N. B. and the relations of M. Pollard, and diuers others.\n\nThe Gouernment of Captaine Miles Kendall, Deputy\n\nfor Captaine Tuckar.\n\nThe arriuall of two ships.\n\nTHE vnexpected returne of Captaine Tuckar, caused a demurre in the election of the new Gouernor; some perswading these oft changes were so troublesome, dangerous, and chargeable, it were best to continue Captaine Kendall; others againe stood for Captaine Tuckar, but during the time of these opinions, the Gilliflower was dispatched with a supply. Now I should haue remembred, Tuckar was no sooner out of the harbour, but he met Master Elfred in a ship called the Treasurer, sent from Virginia to trade: by her he writ to his Deputy Master Kendall, to haue a care of all things, and beware of too much acquaintance with this ship, which hee suspected was bound for the West Indies. Notwithstanding, Elfred receiued what kindnesse the Ile could afford; he promised to reuisit them at his returne; this done, because they would not be gouernlesse when his Deputiship was expired, there was a generall assembly, and by that Election Kendall was confirmed to succeed still Gouernor. Now they began to apply themselues to the finishing some plat-forme about Smiths Fort, and laying the foundation of a Church to be built of Cedar, till the Gillyflower arriued with some priuate letters to Kendall, how he was elected Gouernor of those Iles for three yeeres. During her stay they held their Assises, where for some few suspected facts three were condemned, and the better to terrifie the rest, led to the place of execution, but reprieued; diuers of the rest had their faults pardoned, and the Gilliflower set saile for New found land.\n\nCaptaine Butler chosen Gouernor.\n\nThe loue and kindnesse, honesty and industry of this Captaine Kendall, hath beene very much commended; by others, somewhat disliked: but an Angell in those imploiments cannot please all men, yet this consideration bred much ill bloud as well here as there, so that the Company directly concluded, Captaine Butler should with what expedition they could, goe to be their Gouernor: In the Interim they tooke the opportunitie of a ship, called the Sea-flower, bound for Virginia, and by her sent a Preacher and his Family, with diuers Passengers, and newes of a new Gouernor. This bred a great distaste amongst many, that still they should haue new officers and strangers for their Gouernors they neuer heard of, and themselues still kept there whether they would or no, without any preferment, no nor scarce any of them their inhabiting, to haue any land at all of their owne, but liue all as tenants, or as other mens poore seruants.\n\nAbout this time came in Captaine Kerby with a small Barke from the West-Indies, who hauing refreshed himselfe, was very kindly vsed by the Gouernor\n\nPage 191\n\nand so departed. Not long after a Dutch Frigot was cast away vpon the Westerne shore, yet by the helpe of the English they saued the men, though the ship perished amongst the Rocks. A little after one Ensigne Wood being about the loading of a peece, by thrusting a pike into the concauitie, grating vpon the shor, or somewhat about the powder, strucke fire within her and so discharged, but wounded him cruelly and blew him into the Sea, though hee was got out by some that stood by him, yet hee died of those wounds. Within two or three daies after, Captaine Elfred now comes in a second time: but of that we shall say more in the gouernment of Captaine Butler, who presently after arriued with a good supply, and was kindly entertained by Captaine Kendall and all the Colony.\n\nFrom a relation of Tho. Sparks, and diuers others.\n\nThe Gouernment of Captaine Nathaniel Butler.\n\nA plat-forme burnt, and much hurt by a Hericano. 1619.\n\nCAptaine Butler being arriued the twentieth of October, 1619. some mutterings there was how to maintaine their election of Captaine Kendall, but better remembring themselues, that conceit quickly dissolued. The next day, Kendall, the Ministers, and the Counsell went aboord to salute the new Gouernor, where after they had dined with the best entertainment he could giue them; they saw the Redout belonging to the Kings Castle by a mischance on fire, whither he repaired with all the meanes he could to quench it; but all the platforme and cariages were consumed before their faces, and they could not helpe it. Two daies after he went vp to the Towne, had his Commission publikely read, made a short speech to the Company, and so tooke vpon him the gouernment. Then presently he began to repaire the most necessary defects: The next moneth came in the Garland, sent from England six or seuen weekes before him; so that being seuenteene weeks in her voyage, it was so tedious and grieuous to diuers of the Fresh-water Passengers, that such a sicknesse bred amongst them, many died as well Sailers as Passengers. Hauing taken the best order he could for their releefe, passed through all the Tribes, and held his first Assise in Captaine Tuckars house at the ouer-plus. Towards the last of this moneth of Nouemb. there arose a most terrible storme or Hericano, that blew vp many great trees by the roots: the Warwick that brought the Gouernor was cast away, but the Garland rid by her, saued her selfe by cutting downe her Masts; and not long after a second storme, no lesse violent then the first, wherein the Mount which was a frame of wood built by Master More for a Watch-tower to looke out to Sea, was blowne vp by the roots, and all that Winter crop of corne blasted: And thus was the new Gouernor welcomed.\n\nThe refortifying the Kings Castle.\n\nAmber-greece found.\n\nWith the beginning of the new yeere he began his first peece of fortification, vpon a Rocke which flankers the Kings Castle, and finding the ship called the Treasurer starke rotten and vnseruiceable, hee tooke nine peeces of Ordinance from her to serue other vses. The Garland for want of meanes, could not make her voiage to Virginia as she was appointed; wherefore he entertained her to returne to England, with all the Tabacco they had in the Ile. It was Ianuary before she departed, in which time shee failed not much to haue beene twice cast away. But those strange and vnauoidable mischances, rather seemed to quicken the Gouernors industry then to dull it. Hauing finished the Church begun by Captaine Kendall, with an infinite toile and labour he got three peeces out of the wracke VVarwicke. Hauing an excellent Dutch Carpinter he entertained of them that were cast away in the Dutch Frigot; he imploied him in building of Boats, whereof they were in exceeding great want. In February they discouered a tall ship beating too and againe, as it seemed by her working, being ignorant of the Coast; some thought her a Spaniard to view their Forts, which stand most to\n\nPage 192\n\nthat part she so neerely approached; some, English; but the most, some Dutch man of Warre: The wind blew so high, they durst not send out a Boat, though they much doubted she would be foule of their Rocks, but at last she bore vp rommy for the Sea, and we heard of her no more. That euening, a lucky fellow it should seeme he was, that found a peece of Amber-greece of eight ounces, as he had twice before, which bringing to the Gouernor, he had ready money for the one halfe, after three pound an ounce, according to their order of Court, to encourage others to looke out for more, and preuent the mischiefe insueth by concealing of it.\n\nThe arriuall of two Dutch Frigots.\n\nWithin a few daies after, they descried two Frigots that came close to the shore, and sent a Letter to the Gouernor, writ in Italian, that they were Hollanders had beene in the West-Indies, and desired but to arriue, refresh themselues with wood and water, and so be gone. The Gouernor forthwith sent them to vnderstand, that being there vnder his Maiestie of England to command those Iles, he was to carrie himselfe a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies; if therefore he could shew a lawfull Commission for his being honestly and nobly emploied, he and his should be kindly welcome, otherwise they were to aduenture at their perills. But his Commission was so good, he staied there two moneths, and was so well fitted with Oile & Bacon, they were all glad and happy of this Dutch Captaine Scoutans arriuall, with many thanks to their old friend Captaine Powell that had conducted him thither: the Colony being exceedingly in great want and distresse, bought the most part of it at reasonable rates, so Captaine Scoutan returned to the West-Indies, and Captaine Powell for his part in the Low-Countries. Whilest these things were in action, the Aduenturers in England made many a long looke for their ships; at last the Garland brought them all the newes, but the Tobacco was so spoiled either in the leaking ship, or the making vp, it caused a great suspicion there could none was good come from those Iles; where (were they but perfit in the cure) questionlesse it would be much better then a great quantitie of that they sell for Verinas, and many a thousand of it in London hath beene bought and sold by that title.\n\nThe differences betwixt the Ministers.\n\nThe Gouernor being cleere of those distractions, falls vpon the restoring of the burnt Redoubt, where he cuts out a large new plat-forme, and mounts seuen great peece of Ordnance vpon new cariages of Cedar. Now amongst all those troubles, it was not the least to bring the two Ministers to subscribe to the Booke of Common Praier, which all the Bishops in England could not doe. Finding it high time to attempt some conformitie, bethought himselfe of the Liturgie of Garnsey and Iarse, wherein all those particulars they so much stumbled at, were omitted. No sooner was this propounded, but it was gladly imbraced by them both, whereupon the Gouernor translated it verbatim out of French into English, and caused the eldest Minister vpon Easter day to begin the vse thereof at S. Georges towne, where himselfe, most of the Councell, Officers and Auditorie receiued the Sacrament: the which forme they continued during the time of his gouernment.\n\nThe rebuilding the Mount.\n\nMuch about this time, in such a faire morning, that had inuited many Boats farre out to the Sea to fish, did rise such a Hericano that much indangered them all, so that one of them with two Boies were driuen to Sea and neuer more heard of. The Ministers thus agreed, a Proclamation was published for keeping of the Sabbath, and all the defectiue cariages he endeuoured to haue renewed, builded a small Boat of Cedar onely to goe with Ores, to be ready vpon any occasion to discouer any shipping, and tooke order euery Fort should haue the like: Also caused numbers of Cedars to be brought from diuers places in flotes, to rebuild the Mount, which with an vnspeakable toile, was raised seuen foot higher then before, and a Falcon mounted at the foot, to be alwaies discharged for a warning to all the Forts vpon the discouery of any shipping, and this he called Rich Mount. This exceeding toile and labour, hauing no Cattle but onely mens\n\nPage 193\n\nstrengths, caused many petitions to the Gouernour, that all those generall works might cease till they had reaped their haruests, in that they were in great distresse for victuall; which hee so well answered, their owne shames did cause them desist from that importunity, and voluntarily performe as much as hee required.\n\nThe Tombe of Sir George Summers.\n\nFinding accidentally a little crosse erected in a by place, amongst a many of bushes, vnderstanding there was buried the heart and intrailes of Sir George Summers, hee resolued to haue a better memory for so worthy a Souldier, then that. So finding also a great Marble stone brought out of England, hee caused it by Masons to bee wrought handsomely and laid ouer the place, which hee inuironed with a square wall of hewen stone, Tombe like; wherein hee caused to bee grauen this Epitaph he had composed, and fixed it vpon the Marble stone; and thus it was,\n\nIn the yeere 1 6 1 1,\n\nNoble Sir George Summers went hence to heauen;\n\nWhese well tri'd worth that held him still imploid,\n\nGaue him the knowledge of the world so wide.\n\nHence 't was by heauens decree, that to this place\n\nHe brought new guests, and name to mutuall grace.\n\nAt last his soule and body being to part,\n\nHe here bequeath'd his entrails and his heart.\n\nTheir manner of lawes reformed.\n\nVpon the sixt of Iune began the second Assise, that reduced them to the direct forme vsed in England. For besides the Gouernour and Councell, they haue the Bailiffes of the Tribes, in nature of the Deputy Lieutenants of the shires in England, for to them are all precepts and warrants directed, and accordingly answered and respected; they performe also the duties of Iustices of Peace, within their limits. The subordinate Officers to these in euery tribe, are the Constables, Head-borowes, and Church-wardens; these are the triers of the Tobacco, which if they allow not to be marchantable, is burnt: and these are the executioners of their ciuill and politicke causes.\n\nMartiall Officers.\n\nFor points of warre and martiall affaires, they haue the Gouernour for Lieutenant generall, the Sergeant maior, Master of Ordinance, Captaines of Companies, Captaines of Forts, with their seuerall officers, to traine and exercise those numbers vnder their charge, in martiall discipline.\n\nCiuill Officers and Courts.\n\nConcerning their Courts for decision of right and iustice, the first, though last in constitution, is their generall assembly; allowed by the state in England, in the nature of a Parliament, consisting of about forty persons; viz. the Gouernour, the Counsell, the Bailiffes of the tribes, and two Burgesses of each tribe chosen by voyces in the tribe, besides such of the Clergie as the Gouernour thinkes most fit, to be held once a yeere, as you shal heare more thereof hereafter. The next Court is the Assise or Iayles of deliuerie, held twice euery yeere, in Christmas, and Whitson weeke, for all criminall offenders, and ciuill causes betwixt party and party; as actions of debt, trespasse, battery, slander, and the like: and these are determined by a Iury of twelue men, and aboue them is also a grand Iury to examine matters of greater consequence. The last day of the Assise might also well be held a Court, for hearing the trangressions in matters of contempt, mis-behauiour towards any Magistrate, riots, seditious speakers, contemners of warrants, and such like: there are also as occasion shall require, many matters heard by the Gouernor, or his Officers, and oft iustice done in seuerall places, but those are but as daies of hearing, and as preparatiues against their Courts, &c.\n\nThe second Assise.\n\nAt this last Assize eighteene were arrained for criminall causes, a number very extraordinary considering the place; but now occasioned by reason of the hard yeere, and the store of ill chosen new commers; of these, some were censured to the whipping post, some burned in the hand, but two were condemned to die, yet the one was reprieued, the other hanged; this done, euery man returned to his home: many trials they made againe about the Warwicke, but to small purpose,\n\nPage 194\n\nher Ordnance being lashed so fast they could not be vnloosed, till the ropes and decks were rotten, yet some few buttes of beare being flotie they got, which though it had lien six moneths vnder water was verygood, notwithstanding the next yeere they recouered fiue peeces of Ordnance.\n\nA generall assemblie in manner a Parliament.\n\nVpon the first of August, according to the Companies instructions from England, began the generall assembly at the towne of Saint George, which was the first these Iles euer had; consisting as is said, of the Gouernour, Councell, Bailiffes, and Burgesses, and a Secretarie to whom all bils were presented, and by him openly read in the house, also a Clerke to record the Acts, being thirty two in all; fifteene of which being sent into England, were by a generall consent receiued and enacted, the titles where of are these following: as for all the reasons for them, they would be too tedious to recite.\n\nTheir Acts.\n\nThe first was against the vniust sale and letting of apprentises and other seruants, and this was especially for the righting the vndertakers in England. The second, concerning the disposing of aged, diseased, and impotent persons, for it being considered how carelesse many are in preferring their friends, or sending sometimes any they can procure to goe, such vnseruiceable people should be returned back at their charge that sent them, rather then be burden some to the poore Inhabitants in the Iles. The third, the necessary manning the Kings Castle, being the key of the Ile, that a garison of twelue able men should bee there alwaies resident: and 3000. eares of corne, and 1000. pounds of Tobacco payed them by the generality yeerely, as a pension. The fourth, against the making vnmarchantable Tobacco, and Officers sworne to make true trials, & burne that was naught. The fift, inioyned the erection of certaine publike bridges, and the maintenance of them. The sixt, for a continuall supply of victuall for all the Forts, to bee preserued, till some great occasion to vse it. The seuenth was, for two fixed dayes euery yeere for the Assises. The eight, commands the making of high-waies, and prohibiting the passage ouer mens grounds and planted fields, as well to preuent the spoyling of gardens, as conueniencie to answer any alarum. The ninth, for the preseruing young tortoises and birds, that were carelesly destroyed. The tenth, prouided against vagabonds, & prohibited the entertainement of other mens seruants. The eleuenth, compelled the setting of a due quantity of corne for euery family. The twelfth, the care corne being set, enioyned the keeping vp of their poultry till it was past their reaches. The thirteenth, for the preseruation of sufficient fences, & against the felling of marked trees appointed for bounds. The fourteenth, granted to a leuy for a thousand pound weight of Tobacco, towards the payment of publike workes, as the bridges and the mount. The fifteenth, for the enioyning an acknowledgement and acception of all resident Gouernours, and the warranting him to continue, though his time be expired, till the arriuall of a legitimate successor from England, to preuent all vnmeet and presumptuous elections, besides it was desired by petition in England, the new Gouernous should liue two months as a priuate man after his arriuall, if his predecessor did stay so long, the better to learne and obserue his course. And these are the contents of those fifteene Acts, applied as you may perceiue: which the lawes of England could not take notice of, because euery climate hath somewhat to it selfe in that kinde in particular; for otherwise as it is conceiued, it had beene a high impudency and presumption to haue medled with them, or indeed with any such as these lawes, that had with such great iudgement and iustice alwaies prouided for.\n\nThe arriuall of the Magazin ship.\n\n70000. weight of Tobacco.\n\nNo sooner was this businesse ouer, but the Magazin ship is discouered, and that night came into the Harbour, but in a very weake and sickly case, hauing cast ouer board twenty or thirty of her people, and so violent was the infection, that the most part of the sailers, as well as passengers, were so sicke, or dismaid, or both, that the Master confessed, had they stayed at the Sea but a weeke longer, they had all perished. There arriued with this ship diuers Gentlemen of good fashion, with their wiues and families; but many of them crasie by the tediousnesse of the voyage:\n\nPage 195\n\nhowsoeuer most of them, by the excellent salubrity of the aire, then which the world hath not a better, soone after recouered; yet some there were that died presently after they got ashore, it being certainly the quality of the place, either to kill, or cure quickly, as the bodies are more or lesse corrupted. By this ship the Company sent a supply of ten persons for the generality, but of such bad condition that it seemed they had picked the Males out of Newgate, the Females from Bridewell: As the Gouernour found it his best course, to grant out the women to such as were so greedy of wiues, and would needs haue them for better for worse; and the men hee placed in the Kings Castle for souldiers. But this bad, weake, sickly supply being dispersed for their best reliefe, by the much imployment of his boats in remoouing them, many of his owne men became infected, so that for some weekes, they were not able to doe him any seruice at all. Strict instructions also they brought for the planting of Sugar canes, for which the Iland being rockie and dry, is so vnproper, that few as yet haue beene seene to prosper: yet there are others hold the contrary opinion, that there is raine so ordinarily, the Iles are so moist, as produceth all their plants in such infinit abundance: there is no great reason to suspect this, were it rightly vsed, more then the rest. Seuenty thousand weight of Tobacco being prepared towards her fraught, she returned for England. No sooner was shee gone then came in another, sent by the Company and generalty, well conditioned, but shee failed not much to haue beene cast away amongst those dangerous & terrible rocks; by her came also expresse command, they should entertaine no other ships, then were directly sent from the Company: this caused much grudging, and indeed a generall distraction and exclamation among the Inhabitants, to be thus constrained to buy what they wanted, and sell what they had at what price the Magazin pleased, and to debarre true men from comming to them for trade or reliefe, that were daily receiued in all the harbours in England. So long this ship stayed going for fraught and wages, the Master not caring how long he lay at that rate in a good harbour, the Gouernour was ready to send her away by Proclamation. Thus ended the first yeere of the gouernment of C. Butler.\n\n1620. The building of three bridges and other works.\n\nWith the first of the second yeere were held the Assises, where all the Bailiffes were fined for not giuing a beginning to the building of the bridges; there was also an order to restraine the excessiue wages all hadicrafts men would haue: and that the Church-wardens should meet twice a yeere, to haue all their presentments made perfect against the Assises. The Assises done, all the ablest men were trained in their armes, and then departed to their owne homes. The towne thus cleered, he made certaine new carriages for some demy Culuerings, and a large new storehouse of Cedar for the yeerely Magazines goods; finished Warwicks Fort begun by Master More, and made a new platforme at Pagits Fort, also a faire house of lime and stone for the Townes-house. The three bridges appointed by the generall assembly, was followed with such diligence, though they were more then an hundred, or an hundred and twenty foot in length, hauing the foundation and arches in the Sea, were raised and accomplished, so that man or beast with facility might passe them.\n\nThe generall Assises, and the proceedings.\n\nAt Whitsonday was held the fourth generall Assise at Saint Georges, where were tryed twenty seuerall causes; foure or fiue were whipped or burnt in the hand, for breaking of houses: also an order was made, that the party cast in the triall of any cause, should pay to euery of the Iurours foure pence: moreouer, that not past ten leaues at the most should grow vpon a plant of Tobacco, and that also in the making it vp, a distinction should diligently be obserued of two kinds, a better and a worse: then they built a stronge stone house for the Captaine of the Kings Castle and corps du guard; and repaired what defects they could finde in the platformes and carriages.\n\nCaptaine Powell so oft mentioned, hauing beene in the West-Indies for the States of Holland, came to an anchor within shot of their Ordnance, desiring admittance for wood and water, of which hee had great need, but the Gouernor\n\nPage 196\n\nwould not permit him, so he weighed and departed, whereat the company were so madded, it was not possible to constraine them to cease their exclaimations against the Companies inhibition, till they were weary with exclaming: But still for their better defence, not thinking themselues sufficiently secure, hauing finished two new plat-formes more, arriued the Magazin ship, but her Master was dead, and many of the Passengers, the rest for most part very sicke; and withall, a strange and wonderfull report of much complaint made against the Gouernor to the Company in England, by some of them returned in the last yeeres shipping: but it was eight daies before she could get in by reason of ill weather, being forced againe to Sea; so that time, they kept euery night continually great fires, she might see the Ile as well by night as day; but at last she arriued, and he plainly vnderstood, he had more cause a great deale to looke for misconstruction of all his seruice then an acknowledgment, much lesse a recompence any better then his predecessors; but it is no new thing to requite the best desert with the most vildest of ingratitude.\n\nA strange deliuerance of a Spanish wracke.\n\nThe very next daies night after the arriuall of the Magazins ship, newes was brought the Gouernor by a dismaied Messenger from Sands his Tribe, that one hundred Spaniards were landed in that part, and diuers ships discouered at Sea, whereupon he presently manned the Forts, and instantly made thitherward in person with twentie men, determining as he found cause to draw together more strength by the way. Being got thither by the breake of the next day, in stead of an enemy which he expected, he met onely with a company of poore distressed Portugals and Spaniards, who in their passage from Carthagena in the West-Indies, in consort with the Spanish fleet of Plait; by the same storme that had indangered the Magazin ship, lost theirs vpon those terrible Rocks, being to the number of seuenty persons, were strangely preserued; and the manner was thus.\n\nAbout Sunne-set their ship beating amongst the Rocks, some twenty of the Sailers got into the Boat with what treasure they could, leauing the Captaine, the Master, and all the rest to the mercy of the Sea. But a Boy not past foureteene yeares of age that leaped after to haue got into the Boat, missing that hope, it pleased God he got vpon a Chest a drift by him, whereon they report he continued two daies, and was driuen neere to the cleane contrary part of the Ile, where he was taken vp neere dead, yet well recouered. All this night the ship sticking fast, the poore distressed in her the next day spying land, made a raft, and were those gaue the alarum first a shore about three of the clocke in the after noone. The morning after, about seuen of the clocke came in the Boat to a place called Mangroue Bay; and the same day their Carpenter was driuen a shore vpon a Planke neere Hog-Bay. There was a Gentlewoman that had stood wet vp to the middle vpon the raft from the ship to the shore, being big with childe; and although this was vpon the thirteenth of September, she tooke no hurt, and was safely deliuered of a Boy within three daies after. The best comfort could be giuen them in those extremities they had, although some of the baser sort had beene rifling some of them before the Gouernors arriuall: Also the Spanish Captaine and the chiefe with him, much complained of the treachery of his men to leaue him in that manner, yet had conueyed with them the most of the money they could come by, which he easily missed; whereupon hee suddenly caused all them he accused, to be searched, and recouered to the value of one hundred and fortie pounds starling, which he deliuered into the Captaines hands, to be imploied in a generall purse towards their generall charge: during their stay in the Iles, some of the better sort, nine or ten weeks dieted at his owne table, the rest were billited amongst the Inhabitants at foure shillings the weeke, till they found shipping for their passage, for which they paied no more then the English paied themselues; and for the passage of diuers of them, the Gouernor was glad to stand bound to the Master; some others that were not able to procure such friendship, were so constrained to stay in the Iles, till by their labours they had got\n\nPage 197\n\nso much as would transport them; and thus they were preserued, releeued, and deliuered.\n\nHow they solemnized the powder treason, and the arriuall of two ships.\n\nIn the moneth insuing arriued the second ship, and she also had lost her Master, and diuers of her Passengers; in her came two Virginian Women to be married to some would haue them, that after they were conuerted and had children, they might be sent to their Countrey and kindred to ciuilize them. Towards the end of this moneth came in the third ship with a small Magazin, hauing sold what she could, caried the rest to Virginia, and neuer did any of those Passengers complaine either of their good diet, or too good vsage at sea; but the cleane contrary still occasioned many of those extremities. The fift of Nouember the damnable plot of the powder treason was solemnized, with Praiers, Sermons, and a great Feast, whereto the Gouernor inuited the chiefe of the Spaniards, where drinking the Kings health, it was honored with a quicke volly of small shot, which was answered from the Forts with the great Ordnance, and then againe concluded with a second volley of small shot; neither was the afternoone without musicke and dancing, and at night many huge bone-fires of sweet wood.\n\nThe Spaniards returne, and in danger againe, 1621.\n\nThree English Murderers found in the Spanish wracke.\n\nThe Spaniards to expresse their thankfulnesse at their departure, made a deed of gift to the Gouernor of whatsoeuer he could recouer of the wracked ship; but the ships as they went out came so dangerously vpon a Rock, that the poore Spaniards were so dismaied, swearing this place was ominous vnto them, especially the women, that desired rather to goe a shore and die howsoeuer, than aduenture any further in such a labyrinth of dangers, but at last she got cleere without danger, and well to England; the other went to Virginia, wherein the Gouernor sent two great Chests filled with all such kinds and sorts of Fruits and Plants as their Ilands had; as Figs, Pomgranats, Oranges, Lemons, Sugar-canes, Plantanes, Potatoes, Papawes, Cassado roots, red Pepper, the Prickell Peare, and the like. The ships thus dispatched, hee goeth into the maine, and so out to sea to the Spanish wracke. He had beene there before presently after her ruine, for neuer had ship a more sudden death, being now split in peeces all vnder water. He found small hope to recouer anything, saue a Cable and an Anchor, and two good Sacars; but the wind was so high hee was forced to returne, being ten miles from the shore, onely with three Murderers, which were knowne to be the same Captaine Kendall had sold to Captaine Kerby, whose ship was taken by two men of warre of Carthagena, the most of his men slaine or hanged, and he being wounded, died in the woods. Now their Pilot being at this seruice, got thus those three Murderers to their ship, and their ship thus to the Bermudas, as the Spaniards remaining related to the Gouernor and others.\n\nTheir Assises, and other passages.\n\nHauing raised three small Bulwarkes at Southhamptons Fort, with two Curtaines, and two Rauilings, which indeed is onely the true absolute peece of fortification in the Iles; Christmas being come, and the prefixed day of the Assise; diuers were whipped and burnt in the hand, onely three young boyes for stealing were condemned, and at the very point of hanging repriued. The Gouernour then sent his Lieutenant all ouer the maine to distribute Armes to those were found most fit to vse them, & to giue order for their randezuous, which were hanged vp in the Church. About this time it chanced a pretty secret to be discouered to preserue their corne from the fly, or weauell, which did in a manner as much hurt as the rats. For the yeere before hauing made a Proclamation that all Corne should be gathered by a certaine day, because many lazy persons ranne so after the ships to get Beere and Aquavitæ, for which they will giue anything they haue, much had beene lost for want of gathering. This yeare hauing a very faire crop, some of the Inhabitants, none of the best husbands, hastily gathered it for feare of the penaltie, threw it in great heaps into their houses vnhusked, and so let it lie foure or fiue moneths, which was thought would haue spoiled it: where the good husbands husked it, and with much labour hung it vp, where the Flies did so blow on it, they increased to so many Weauels, they generally\n\nPage 198\n\ncomplained of great losse; but those good fellowes that neuer cared but from hand to mouth, made their boasts, that not a graine of theirs had beene touched nor hurt, there being no better way to preserue it then by letting it lie in its huske, and spare an infinite labour formerly had beene vsed. There were also very luckily about this time found out diuers places of fresh water, of which many of the Forts were very destitute, and the Church-wardens and Side-men were very busie in correcting the prophaners of the Sabbath, Drunkards, Gamesters, and such like. There came also from Virginia a small Barke with many thanks for the presents sent them; much Aquauitæ, Oile, Sacke and Bricks they brought in exchange of more Fruits and Plants, Ducks, Turkies and Limestone, of which she had plenty, and so returned during the aboad of the stay of this ship. The mariage of one of the Virginia maides was consummated with a husband fit for her, attended with more then one hundred guests, and all the dainties for their dinner could be prouided; they made also another triall to fish for Whales, but it tooke no more effect then the former: this was done by the Master of the Virginia ship that professed much skill that way, but hauing fraughted his ship with Limestone, with 20000. weight of Potatoes, and such things as he desired, returned for Virginia.\n\nA strange Sodomy.\n\nMore trialls about the wracks.\n\nAprill and May were spent in building a strong new Prison, and perfecting some of the Fortifications, and by the labour of twenty men in fourteene daies was got from the Spanish wracke foure excellent good Sacres, and mounted them at the Forts. Then began the generall Assize, where not fewer then fifty ciuill, or rather vnciuill actions were handled, and twenty criminall prisoners brought to the bar; such a multitude of such vild people were sent to this Plantation, that he thought himselfe happy his time was so neere expired: three of the fowlest acts were these: the first for the rape of a married woman, which was acquitted by a senselesse Iury; the second for buggering a Sow, and the third for Sodomy with a boy, for which they were hanged; during the time of the imprisonment of this Buggerer of the Sow, a Dung-hill Cocke belonging to the same man did continually haunt a Pigge of his also, and to the wonder of all them that saw it who were many, did so frequently tread the Pigge as if it had beene one of his Hens, that the Pigge languished and died within a while after, and then the Cocke resorted to the very same Sow (that this fellow was accused for) in the very same manner, and as an addition to all this, about the same time two Chickens were hatched, the one whereof had two heads, the other crowed very loud and lustily within twelve houres after it was out of the shell. A desperate fellow being to bee arraigned for stealing a Turky, rather then he would endure his triall, secretly conueighed himselfe to Sea in a little Boat, and neuer since was euer heard of, nor is he euer like to be, without an exceeding wonder, little lesse then a miracle. In Iune they made another triall about the Spanish wracke, and recouered another Sacre and a Murderer, also he caused to be hewed out of the maine Rocke a paire of large staires for the conuenient landing of goods and passengers, a worke much to the beauty and benefit of the towne. With twenty chosen men, and two excellent Divers, the Gouernour went himselfe to the wracke Warwick, but they could recouer but one Murderer, from thence he went to the Sea-aduenture, the wracke of Sir George Summers, the hull though two or three fathomes in the water, they found vnperished and with much a doe weighed a Sacre, her sheat Anchor, diuers barres of Iron and pigs of Lead, which stood the Plantation in very great stead. Towards the end of Iuly he went to seeke for a wracke they reported lay vnder water with her hatches spiked vp, but they could not finde her, but from the Spanish wracke lay there by they weighed three faire Sacres more, and so returned through the Tribes to Saint Georges: some were also imployed to seeke out beds of Oisters for Pearle, some they found, some seed Pearle they got, but out of one little shell aboue all the rest they got about 120, small Pearle, but somewhat defectiue in their colour.\n\nPage 199\n\nThe Planters complaints.\n\nThe time of Captain Butlers gouernment drawing neere an end, the Colony presented vnto him diuers grieuances, to intreat him to remember to the Lords and Company in England at his returne: also they appointed two to be ioyned with him, with letters of credence to solicit in their behalfe those grieuances following: First, they were defrauded of the food of their soules: for being not fewer then one thousand and fiue hundred people, dispersed in length twenty miles, they had at that present but one Minister, nor neuer had but two, and they so shortned of their promises, that but onely for meere pity they would haue forsaken them. Secondly, neglected in the safety of their lines by wants of all sorts of munition. Thirdly, they had beene censured contrary to his Maiesties Lawes, and not allowed them the benefit of their booke as they are in England, but by Captaine Butler. Fourthly, they were frustrated of many of their couenants, and most extremely pinched and vndone by the extortion of the Magazine, for although their Tobacco was stinted but at two shillings sixpence the pound, yet they pitched their commodities at what rate they pleased. Fifthly, their fatherlesse children are left in little better condition then slaues, for if their Parents die in debt, their children are made as bondmen till the debt be discharged: these things being perfected, there grew a great question of one Heriot for plotting of factions and abusing the Gouernour, for which he was condemned to lose his cares, yet he was vsed so fauourably he lost but the part of one in all.\n\nThe returne of Captaine Butler.\n\nBy this time it being growne past the wonted season of the comming in of ships from England, after a generall longing and expectation, especially of the Gouernour, whose Commission being neere vpon expiration, gaue him cause to wish for a meane of deliuerance from so troublesome and thanklesse an imploiment as he had hitherto found it; a saile is discouered, and long it was not before shee arriued in the Kings Castle-Harbour: this Barke was set out by two or three priuate men of the Company, and hauing landed her supplies, was to goe for Virginia; by her the Gouernour receiued certaine aduertisements of the carriage and behauiour of the Spaniards, which he had relieued as you haue heard the yeere before; that quite contrary both to his merit, their vow, and his owne expectation, they made clamours against him, the which being seconded by the Spanish Ambassadour, caused the State to fall in examination about it; whereupon hauing fully cleared their ingratefulnesse and impudency, and being assured of the choice of a successor that was to be expected within fiue or six weekes; hee was desirous to take the opportunity of this Barke, and to visit the Colony in Virginia in his returne for England: leauing the gouernment to Captaine Felgat, Captaine Stokes, Master Lewis Hewes, Master Nedom and Master Ginner, but now his time being fully expired, and the fortifications finished, viz. The Kings Castle wherein were mounted vpon sufficient Platformes sixteene peece of Ordnances: In Charles Fort two; In Southampton Fort fiue, betwixt which and the Castle passeth the Chanell into the Harbour, secured by three and twenty peeces of good artillery to play vpon it. In Cowpers Ile is Pembrocks Fort, where is two Peeces. The Chanell of Saint George is guarded by Smiths Fort, and Pagits Fort, in which is eleuen peece of Ordnance. Saint George towne is halfe a league within the Harbour, commanded by Warwicks Fort, where are three great Peeces, and on the Wharfe before the Gouernours house eight more, besides the warning Peece by the mount, and three in Saint Katharines; so that in all there are ten Fortresses and two and fifty peeces of Ordnance sufficient and seruiceable: their formes and situations you may see more plainlier described in the Map; and to defend those, he left one thousand fiue hundred persons with neere a hundred boats, and the Ile well replenished with store of such fruits, prouisions and Poultry, as is formerly related; yet for so departing and other occasions, much difference hath beene betwixt him and some of the Company, as any of his Predecessors, which I rather wish were reconciled, then to be a reporter of such vnprofitable dissentions.\n\nPage 200\n\nFor\n\nTill trechery and faction, and auarice be gone,\n\nTill envy and ambition, and backbiting be none,\n\nTill perjury and idlenesse, and iniury be out,\n\nAnd truly till that villany the worst of all that rout;\n\nUnlesse those vises banisht be, what euer Forts you haue,\n\nA hundred walls together put will not haue power to saue.\n\nMaster Iohn Barnard sent to be Gouernour.\n\n1622. The Lord Cauendish Treasurer. Master Nicholas Farrar Deputy.\n\nTO supply this place was sent by the noble aduenturers Iohn Bernard, a Gentleman both of good meanes and quality, who arriued within eight daies after Butlers departure with two ships, and about one hundred and forty passengers with armes and all sorts of munition and other prouisions sufficient. During the time of his life which was but six weekes in reforming all things he found defectiue, he shewed himselfe so iudiciall and industrious as gaue great satisfaction, and did generally promise vice was in great danger to be suppressed, and vertue and the Plantation much aduanced; but so it hapned that both he and his wife died in such short time they were both buried in one day and one graue, and Master Iohn Harrison chosen Gouernour till further order came from England.\n\nWhat hapned in the gouernment of Master Iohn Harrison.\n\n1623. Sir Edward Sackuil Treasurer. Master Gabriel Barber Deputy.\n\nTHey are still much troubled with a great short worme that deuours their Plants in the night, but all the day they lie hid in the ground, and though early in the morning they kill so many, they would thinke there were no more, yet the next morning you shall finde as many. The Caterpillers to their fruits are also as pernicious, and the land Crabs in some places are as thicke in their Borowes as Conies in a Warren, and doe much hurt; besides all this, there hapned this yeere a very heauy disaster, for a ship wherein there had beene much swearing and blaspheming vsed all the voyage, and landed what she had to leaue in those Iles, iouially froliking in their Cups and Tobacco, by accident fired the Powder, that at the very instant blew vp the great Cabin, and some one way and some another, it is a wonder to thinke how they could bee so blowne out of the gun-roome into the Sea, where some were taken vp liuing, so pitifully burned, their liues were worse then so many deaths, some died, some liued, but eighteene were lost at this fatall blast, the ship also immediatly sunke with threescore barrels of meale sent for Virginia, and all the other prouision in her was thus lost.\n\nNote.\n\nSir Thomas Smith Treasurer, and Master Edwards Deputy.\n\nNow to consider how the Spaniards, French, and Dutch, haue beene lost and preserued in those inuincible Iles, yet neuer regarded them but as monuments of miseries, though at this present they all desire them; How Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir George Summers being ready to sinke in the sea were saued, what an incredible abundance of victuall they found, how it was first planted by the English, the strange increase of Rats, and their sudden departure, the fiue men came from England in a boat, the escape of Hilliard, and the rest of those accidents there hapned, a man would thinke it a tabernacle of miracles, and the worlds wonder, that from such a Paradise of admiration who would thinke should spring such wonders of afflictions as are onely fit to be sacrificed vpon the highest altars of sorrow, thus to be set vpon the highest Pinacles of content, and presently throwne downe to the lowest degree of extremity, as you see haue beene the yeerely succeedings of those Plantations; the which to ouercome, as it is an incomparable honour, so it can be no dishonour if a man doe miscarry by vnfortunate accidents in such honourable actions, the which renowne and vertue to attaine hath\n\nPage 201\n\ncaused so many attempts by diuers Nations besides ours, euen to passe through the very amazement of aduentures. Vpon the relation of this newes the Company hath sent one Captaine Woodhouse, a Gentleman of good repute and great experience in the warres, and no lesse prouident then industrious and valiant: then returned report, all goeth well there. It is too true, in the absence of the noble Treasurer, Sir Edward Sackvill, now Earle of Dorset, there haue beene such complaints betwixt the Planters and the Company, that by command the Lords appointed Sir Thomas Smith againe Treasurer, that since then according to their order of Court he is also elected, where now we must leaue them all to their good fortune and successe, till we heare further of their fortunate proceedings.\n\nFINIS.\n\nTo his friend Captaine Smith, vpon his\n\ndescription of New-England.\n\nSIr; your Relations I haue read: which shew,\n\nTher's reason I should honour them and you:\n\nAnd if their meaning I haue vnderstood,\n\nI dare to censure thus: Your Proiect's good;\n\nAnd may (if follow'd) doubtlesse quit the paine,\n\nWith honour, pleasure and a trebble gaine;\n\nBeside the benefit that shall arise\n\nTo make more happy our Posterities.\n\nFor would we daigne to spare, though't were no more\n\nThen what ore-fils, and surfets vs in store,\n\nTo order Nature's fruit fulnesse a while\n\nIn that rude Garden, you New-England stile;\n\nWith present good, ther's hope in after-daies\n\nThence to repaire what Time and Pride decaies\n\nIn this rich Kingdome.

The second was appropriated to the Cities of Bristol, Exeter and Plimoth, &c. and the West parts of England, and all those that would aduenture and ioine with them, and they might make their choise any where betwixt the degrees of 38. and 44. prouided there should bee at least 100. miles distance betwixt these 2. Colonies, each of which had lawes, priuileges and authoritie, for the gouernment and aduancing their seuerall Plantations alike. Now this part of America hath formerly beene called Norumbega, Virginia, Nuskoncus, Penaquida, Cannada, and such other names as those that ranged the Coast pleased. But because it was so mountainous, rocky and full of Iles, few haue aduentured much to trouble it, but as is formerly related; notwithstanding, that honourable Patron of vertue, Sir Iohn Popham, Lord chiefe Iustice of England, in the yeere 1606, procured meanes and men to possesse it, and sent Captaine George Popham for President, Captaine Rawley Gilbert for Admirall, Captaine Edward Harlow master of the Ordnance, Captaine Robert Dauis Sargeant-Maior, Captaine Elis Best Marshall, Master Seaman Secretary, Captaine Iames Dauis to be Captaine of the Fort, Master Gome Carew chiefe Searcher: all those were of the Councell, who with some hundred more were to stay in the Country: they set saile from Plimoth the last of May, and fell with Monahigan the eleuenth of August. At Sagadahock 9. or 10. leagues southward, they planted themselues at the mouth of a faire nauigable Riuer, but the coast all thereabouts most extreme stony and rocky: that extreme frozen Winter was so cold they could not range nor search the Country, and their prouision so small, they were glad to send all but 45. of their company backe againe: their noble President Captaine Popham died, and not long after arriued two ships well prouided of all necessaries to supply them, and some small time after another, by whom vnderstanding of the\n\nPage 204\n\ndeath of the Lord chiefe Iustice, and also of Sir Iohn Gilbert, whose lands there the President Rawley Gilbert was to possesse according to the aduenturers directions, finding nothing but extreme extremities, they all returned for England in the yeere 1608. and thus this Plantation was begunne and ended in one yeere, and the Country esteemed as a cold, barren, mountainous, rocky Desart.\n\nNotwithstanding, the right Honourable Henry Earle of South-hampton and those of the Ile of Wight, imploied Captaine Edward Harlow to discouer an Ile supposed about Cape Cod, but they found their plots had much abused them, for falling with Monahigan, they found onely Cape Cod no Ile but the maine, there they detained three Saluages aboord them, called Pechmo, Monopet and Pekenimne, but Pechmo leapt ouer board, and got away; and not long after with his consorts cut their Boat from their sterne, got her on shore, and so filled her with sand, and guarded her with Bowes and Arrowes the English lost her: not farre from thence they had three men sorely wounded with Arrowes. Anchoring at the Ile of Nohono, the Saluages in their Canowes assaulted the Ship till the English Guns made them retire, yet here they tooke Sakaweston, that after he had liued many yeeres in England went a Souldier to the warres of Bohemia. At Capawe they tooke Coneconam and Epenow, but the people at Agawom vsed them kindly, so with fiue Saluages they returned for England, yet Sir Francis Popham sent diuers times one Captaine Williams to Monahigan onely to trade and make core fish, but for any Plantations there was no more speeches. For all this, as I liked Virginia well, though not their proceedings, so I desired also to see this country, and spend some time in trying what I could finde for all those ill rumors and disasters. From the relations of Captaine Edward Harlow and diuers others.\n\nMy first voyage to New-England. 1614.\n\nThe comõdities I got amounted to 1500. pounds.\n\nThe trechery of Master Hunt.\n\nIn the month of April 1614. at the charge of Capt.

George Langam, Mr. Iohn Buley and Mr. William Skelton, with two ships from London, I chanced to arriue at Monahigan an Ile of America, in 434. of Northerly latitude: out plot was there to take Whales, for which we had one Samuel Cramton and diuers others expert in that faculty, & also to make trialls of a Mine of gold & copper; if those failed, Fish and Furs were then our refuge to make our selues sauers howsoeuer: we found this Whale-fishing a costly conclusion, we saw many and spent much time in chasing them, but could not kill any. They being a kinde of Iubartes, and not the Whale that yeelds Fins and Oile as we expected; for our gold it was rather the Masters deuice to get a voyage that proiected it, then any knowledge he had at all of any such matter; Fish and Furs were now our guard, & by our late arriuall and long lingring about the Whale, the prime of both those seasons were past ere wee perceiued it, wee thinking that their seasons serued at all times, but we found it otherwise, for by the middest of Iune the fishing failed, yet in Iuly and August some were taken, but not sufficient to defray so great a charge as our stay required: of dry fish we made about forty thousand, of Cor-fish about seuen thousand. Whilest the Sailers fished, my selfe with eight others of them might best bee spared, ranging the Coast in a small Boat, we got for trifles neere eleuen thousand Beuer skinnes, one hundred Martins, as many Otters, and the most of them within the distance of twenty leagues: we ranged the Coast both East and West much further, but Eastward our commodities were not esteemed, they were so neere the French who afforded them better, with whom the Saluages had such commerce that only by trade they made exceeding great voyages, though they were without the limits of our precincts; during the time we tried those conclusions, not knowing the coast, nor Saluages habitations: with these Furres, the traine Oile and Cor-fish, I returned for England in the Barke, where within six moneths after our departure from the Downes, wee safely arriued backe; the best of this fish was sold for 5. li. the hundred, the rest by ill vsage betwixt three pounds and 50. shillings. The other ship stayed to fit her selfe for Spaine with the dry fish which was sold at Maligo at forty Rialls the Quintall, each hundred weighing two quintals and a halfe. But one Thomas Hunt\n\nPage 205\n\nthe Master of this ship (when I was gone) thinking to preuent that intent I had to make there a Plantation, thereby to keepe this abounding Countrey still in obscuritie, that onely he and some few Merchants more might enioy wholly the benefit of the Trade, and profit of this Countrey, betraied foure and twenty of those poore Saluages aboord his ship, and most dishonestly and inhumanely for their kinde vsage of me and all our men, caried them with him to Maligo, and there for a little priuate gaine sold those silly Saluages for Rials of eight; but this vilde act kept him euer after from any more imploiment to those parts. Now because at this time I had taken a draught of the Coast, and called it New England, yet so long he and his Consorts drowned that name with the Eccho of Cannaday, and some other ships from other parts also, that vpon this good returne the next, yeere went thither, that at last I presented this Discourse with the Map, to our most gracious Prince Charles, humbly intreating his Highnesse hee would please to change their barbarous names for such English, as posteritie might say Prince Charles was their God-father, which for your better vnderstanding both of this Discourse and the Map, peruse this Schedule, which will plainly shew you the correspondency of the old names to the new, as his Highnesse named them.\n\nHow Prince Charles called the most remarkable places in New England.\n\nThe old names. The new names. Cape Cod. Cape Iames. The Harbor at Cape Cod. Milforth hauen. Chawum. Barwick. Accomack. Plimoth. Sagoquas. Oxford. Massachusets Mount. Cheuit hills. Massachusits Riuer. Charles Riuer.

Barties Iles. Matinack. Willowbies Iles. Metinacus. Haughtons Iles.\n\nThe rest of the names in the Map, are places that had no names we did know.\n\nAspersions against New England.\n\nCaptaine Hobson his voiage to Capawuk.\n\nBut to continue the History succeedingly as neere with the day and yeere as may bee. Returning in the Barke as is said; it was my ill chance to put in at Plimoth, where imparting those my purposes to diuers I thought my friends, whom as I supposed were interested in the dead Patent of this vnregarded Countrey, I was so encouraged and assured to haue the managing their authoritie in those parts during my life, and such large promises, that I ingaged my selfe to vndertake it for them. Arriuing at London, though some malicious persons suggested there was no such matter to be had in that so bad abandoned Countrey, for if there had, other could haue found it so well as I; therefore it was to be suspected I had robbed the French men in New France or Cannada, and the Merchants set me forth seemed not to regard it, yet I found so many promised me such assistance, that I entertained Michael Cooper the Master of the Barke, that returned with me and others of the Company: how he dealt with others, or others with him, I know not; but my publike proceeding gaue such encouragement, that it became so well apprehended by some few of the Virginia Company, as those proiects\n\nPage 206\n\nfor fishing onely was so well liked, they furnished Couper with foure good ships to Sea, before they at Plimoth had made any prouision at all for me; but onely a small Barke set out by them of the lle of Wight. Some of Plimoth, and diuers Gentlemen of the West Countrey, a little before I returned from New England, in search for a Mine of Gold about an Ile called Capawuck, South-wards from the Shoules of Cape Iames, as they were informed by a Saluage called Epenew; that hauing deluded thẽ as it seems thus to get home, seeing they kept him as a prisoner in his owne Countrey, and before his friends, being a man of so great a stature, he was shewed vp and downe London for money as a wonder, and it seems of no lesse courage and authoritie, then of wit, strength, and proportion: for so well he had contriued his businesse, as many reported he intended to haue surprised the ship; but seeing it could not be effected to his liking, before them all he leaped ouer boord. Many shot they made at him, thinking they had slaine him, but so resolute they were to recouer his body, the master of the ship was wounded, and many of his company; And thus they lost him, & not knowing more what to do, returned againe to England with nothing, which so had discouraged all your West Countrey men, they neither regarded much their promises, and as little either me or the Countrey, till they saw the London ships gone and me in Plimoth according to my promise, as hereafter shall be related.\n\nThe Londoners send foure good ships to New England.\n\nI must confesse I was beholden to the setters forth of the foure ships that went with Couper, in that they offered me that imploiment if I would accept it; and I finde still my refusall incurred some of their displeasures, whose loue and fauour I exceedingly desired; and though they doe censure me opposite to their proceedings, they shall yet still in all my words and deeds finde, it is their error, not my fault that occasions their dislike: for hauing ingaged my selfe in this businesse to the West Countrey, I had beene very dishonest to haue broke my promise, nor will I spend more time in discouery or fishing, till I may goe with a Company for a Plantation; for I know my grounds, yet euery one to whom I tell them, or that reads this Booke, cannot put it in practise, though it may helpe any that hath seene or not seene to know much of those parts: And though they endeuour to worke me out of my owne designes, I will not much enuy their fortunes: but I would be sorry their intruding ignorance should by their defailments bring those certainties to doubtfulnesse. So that the businesse prosper I haue my desire, be it by whomsoeuer that are true subiects to our King and Countrey: the good of my Countrey is that I seeke, and there is more then enough for all, if they could be contented.\n\nThe situation of New England.\n\nNew England is that part of America in the Ocean Sea, opposite to Noua Albion in the South Sea, discouered by the most memorable Sir Francis Drake in his Voyage about the world, in regard whereof this is stiled New England, being in the same latitude New France of it is Northwards, Southwards is Virginia, and all the adioyning continent with new Granado, new Spaine, new Andolosia, and the West-Indies. Now because I haue beene so oft asked such strange questions of the goodnesse and greatnesse of those spatious Tracts of Land, how they can be thus long vnknowne, or not possessed by the Spaniards, and many such like demands; I intreat your pardons if I chance to be too plaine or tedious in relating my knowledge for plaine mens satisfaction.\n\nNotes of Florida.\n\nFlorida is the next adioyning to the Indies, which vnprosperously was attempted to be planted by the French, a Countrey farre bigger then England, Scotland, France and Ireland, yet little knowne to any Christian, but by the wonderfull endeuours of Ferdinando de Soto, a valiant Spaniard, whose writings in this age is the best guide knowne to search those parts.\n\nNotes of Virginia.\n\nVirginia is no lle as many doe imagine, but part of the Continent adioyning to Florida, whose bounds may be stretched to the magnitude thereof, without offence to any Christian Inhabitant, for from the degrees of thirtie to forty eight, his Maiesty hath now enlarged his Letters Patents. The Coast extending Southwest\n\nPage 207\n\nand North-east about sixteene or seuenteene hundred miles, but to follow it aboord the shore may well be three thousand miles at the least: of which twentie miles is the most giues entrance into the Bay of Chisapeacke, where is the London Plantation, within which is a Countrey, as you may perceiue by the Map, of that little I discouered, may well suffice three hundred thousand people to inhabit: but of it, and the discoueries of Sir Ralph Laine and Master Heriot, Captaine Gosnold, and Captaine Waymouth, they haue writ so largely, that posteritie may be bettered by the fruits of their labours. But for diuers others that haue ranged those parts since, especially this Countrey now called New England, within a kenning sometimes of the shore; some touching in one place, some in another; I must intreat them pardon me for omitting them, or if I offend in saying, that their true descriptions were concealed, or neuer were well obserued, or died with the Authors, so that the Coast is yet still but euen as a Coast vnknowne and vndiscouered. I haue had six or souen seuerall plots of those Northerne parts, so vnlike each to other, or resemblance of the Country, as they did me no more good then so much waste paper, though they cost me more, it may bee it was not my chance to see the best; but lest others may be deceiued as I was, or through dangerous ignorance hazard themselues as I did, I haue drawne a Map from point to point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour to Harbour, with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, and Land-markes, as I passed close aboord the shore in a little Boat; although there bee many things to bee obserued, which the haste of other affaires did cause me to omit: for being sent more to get present Commodities, then knowledge of any discoueries for any future good, I had not power to search as I would; yet it will serue to direct any shall goe that waies to safe Harbours and the Saluages habitations: what Merchandize and Commodities for their labours they may finde, this following discourse shall plainly demonstrate.\n\nObseruations for presumptuous ignorant directors.\n\nThus you may see of these three thousand miles, more then halfe is yet vnknowne to any purpose, no not so much as the borders of the Sea are yet certainly discouered: as for the goodnesse and true substance of the Land, we are for most part yet altogether ignorant of them, vnlesse it be those parts about the Bay of Chisapeack and Sagadahock, but onely here and there where we haue touched or seene a little, the edges of those large Dominions which doe stretch themselues into the maine, God doth know how many thousand miles, whereof we can yet no more iudge, then a stranger that saileth betwixt England and France, can describe the harbours and dangers by landing here or there in some Riuer or Bay, tell thereby the goodnesse and substance of Spaine, Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Hungaria, and the rest; nay, there are many haue liued fortie yeeres in London, and yet haue scarce beene ten miles out of the Citie: so are there many haue beene in Virginia many yeeres, and in New England many times, that doe know little more then the place they doe inhabit, or the Port where they fished, and when they come home, they will vndertake they know all Virginia and New England, as if they were but two Parishes or little Ilands. By this you may perceiue how much they erre, that thinke euery one that hath beene in Virginia or New England, vnderstandeth or knoweth what either of them are; Or that the Spaniards know one halfe quarter of those large Territories they possesse, no not so much as the true circumference of Terra incognita, whose large Dominions may equalize the goodnesse and greatnesse of America for any thing yet knowne. It is strange with what small power he doth range in the East-Indies, and few will vnderstand the truth of his strength in America: where hauing so much to keepe with such a pampered force, they need not greatly feare his fury in Sommer Iles, Virginia, or New England, beyond whose bounds America doth stretch many thousand miles. Into the frozen parts whereof, one Master Hutson an English Mariner, did make the greatest discouerie of any Christian I know, where hee vnfortunately was left by his cowardly Company, for his exceeding deserts, to end and die a most miserable death.\n\nPage 208\n\nFor Affrica, had not the industrious Portugals ranged her vnknowne parts, who would haue sought for wealth amongst those fried Regions of blacke brutish Negars, where notwithstanding all their wealth and admirable aduentures and endeuours more then one hundred and fortie yeeres, they know not one third part of those blacke habitations. But it is not a worke for euery one to manage such an affaire, as make a discouery and plant a Colony, it requires all the best parts of art, iudgement, courage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry, to doe but neere well; some are more proper for one thing then another, and therein best to be imploied: and nothing breeds more confusion then misplacing and misimploying men in their vndertakings. Columbus, Courtes, Pizara, Zoto, Magilanus, and the rest serued more then a Prentiship, to learne how to begin their most memorable attempts in the West-Indies, which to the wonder of all ages successefully they effected, when many hundreds of others farre aboue them in the worlds opinion, being instructed but by relation, came to shame and confusion in actions of small moment, who doubtlesse in other matters were both wise, discreet, generous and couragious. I say not this to detract any thing from their incomparable merits, but to answer those questionlesse questions, that keepe vs backe from imitating the worthinesse of their braue spirits, that aduanced themselues from poore Souldiers to great Captaines, their posterity to great Lords, their King to be one of the greatest Potentates on earth, and the fruits of their labours his greatest power, glory, and renowne.\n\nThe Description of New England.\n\nTHat part we call New England, is betwixt the degrees of fortie one and fortie fiue, the very meane betwixt the North pole and the line; but that part this Discourse speaketh of, stretcheth but from Penobscot to Cape Cod, some seuentie fiue leagues by a right line distant each from other; within which bounds I haue seene at least fortie seuerall habitations vpon the Sea Coast, and sounded about fiue and twentie excellent good Harbours, in many whereof there is anchorage for fiue hundred saile of ships of any burden; in some of them for one thousand, and more then two hundred Iles ouer-growne with good Timber of diuers sorts of wood, which doe make so many Harbours, as required a longer time then I had to be well obserued.\n\nThe principall Countries or gouernments.\n\nThe principall habitation Northward we were at, was Pennobscot: Southward along the Coast and vp the Riuers, we found Mecadacut, Segocket, Pemaquid, Nuscoucus, Sagadahock, Aumoughcowgen, and Kenebeke; and to those Countries belong the people of Segotago, Paghhuntanuck, Pocopassum, Taughtanakagnet, Warbigganus, Nassaque, Masherosqueck, Wawrigweck, Moshoquen, Wakcogo, Pasharanack, &c. To these are alied in confederacy, the Countries of Ancocisco, Accomynticus, Passataquack, Aggawom, and Naemkeck: All these for any thing I could perceiue, differ little in language, fashion, or gouernment, though most of them be Lords of themselues, yet they hold the Bashabes of Penobscot, the chiefe and greatest amongst them.\n\nThe next I can remember by name, are Mattahunts, two pleasant Iles of Groues, Gardens, and Corne fields a league in the Sea from the maine: Then Totant, Massachuset, Topent, Secassaw, Totheet, Nasnocomacack, Accomack, Chawum, Patuxet, Massasoyts, Pakanokick: then Cape Cod, by which is Pawmet and the Ile Nawset, of the language and aliance of them of Chawum; the others are called Massachusets, and differ somewhat in language, custome, and condition: for their Trade and Merchandize, to each of their principall families or habitations, they haue diuers Townes and people belonging, and by their relations and descriptions, more then twentie seuerall habitations and riuers that stretch themselues farre into the Countrey, euen to the Borders of diuers great Lakes, where they kill and take most of their Otters, from Pennobscot to Sagadahoc. This Coast\n\nPage 209\n\nis mountainous, and Iles of huge Rockes, but ouer-growne for most part, with most sorts of excellent good woods, for building Houses, Boats, Barks or Ships, with an incredible abundance of most sorts of Fish, much Fowle, and sundry sorts of good Fruits for mans vse.\n\nBetwixt Sagadahock, & Sawocatuck, there is but two or three Sandy Bayes, but betwixt that and Cape Iames very many: especially the Coast of the Massachusets is so indifferently mixed with high Clay or Sandy clifts in one place, and the tracts of large long ledges of diuers sorts, and Quaries of stones in other places, so strangely diuided with tinctured veines of diuers colours: as Free-stone for building, Slate for tyling, smooth stone to make Furnasses and Forges for Glasse and Iron, and Iron Ore sufficient conueniently to melt in them; but the most part so resembleth the Coast of Deuonshire, I thinke most of the clifts would make such Lime-stone: if they bee not of these qualities, they are so like they may deceiue a better iudgement then mine: all which are so neere adioyning to those other aduantages I obserued in these parts, that if the Ore proue as good Iron and Steele in those parts as I know it is within the bounds of the Countrey, I dare ingage my head (hauing but men skilfull to worke the Simples there growing) to haue all things belonging to the building and rigging of ships of any proportion and good Merchandise for their fraught, within a square of ten or foureteene leagues, and it were no hard matter to proue it within a lesse limitation.\n\nA proofe of an excellent clime.\n\nAnd surely by reason of those sandy clifts, and clifts of rocks, both which we saw so planted with Gardens and Corne fields, and so well inhabited with a goodly, strong, and well proportioned people, besides the greatnesse of the Timber growing on them, the greatnesse of the Fish, and the moderate temper of the aire (for of fiue and forty not a man was sicke, but two that were many yeares diseased before they went, notwithstanding our bad lodging and accidentall diet) who can but approue this a most excellent place, both for health and fertilitie: and of all the foure parts of the world I haue yet seene not inhabited, could I haue but means to transport a Colony, I would rather liue here then any where, and if it did not maintaine it selfe, were we but once indifferently well fitted, let vs starue.\n\nStaple Commodities present.\n\nObseruations of the Hollanders.\n\nThe maine staple from hence to bee extracted for the present, to produce the rest, is Fish, which howbeit may seeme a meane and a base Commoditie; yet who will but truly take the paines and consider the sequell, I thinke will allow it well worth the labour. It is strange to see, what great aduentures the hopes of setting forth men of warre to rob the industrious innocent would procure, or such massie promises in grosse, though more are choaked then well fed with such hastie hopes. But who doth not know that the poore Hollanders chiefely by fishing at a great charge and labour in all weathers in the open Sea, are made a people so hardy and industrious, and by the venting this poore Commoditie to the Easterlings for as meane, which is Wood, Flax, Pitch, Tarre, Rozen, Cordage, and such like; which they exchange againe to the French, Spaniards, Portugals, and English, &c. for what they want, are made so mighty, strong, and rich, as no state but Venice of twice their magnitude is so well furnished, with so many faire Cities, goodly Townes, strong Fortresses, and that abundance of shipping, and all sorts of Merchandize, as well of Gold, Siluer, Pearles, Diamonds, pretious Stones, Silkes, Veluets, and Cloth of Gold; as Fish, Pitch, Wood, or such grosse Commodities? What voiages and discoueries, East and West, North and South, yea about the world, make they? What an Army by Sea and Land haue they long maintained, in despight of one of the greatest Princes of the world, and neuer could the Spaniard with all his Mines of Gold and Siluer, pay his debts, his friends, and Army, halfe so truly as the Hollanders still haue done by this contemptible Trade of Fish. Diuers (I know) may alleage many other assistances; but this is the chiefest Mine, and\n\nPage 210\n\nthe Sea the source of those siluer streames of all their vertue, which hath made them now the very miracle of industry, the onely paterne of perfection for these affaires: and the benefit of fishing is that Primum Mobile that turnes all their spheares to this height, of plentie, strength, honor, and exceeding great admiration.\n\nNote.\n\nNote.\n\nHerring, Cod, and Ling, is that triplicitie, that makes their wealth and shippings multiplicitie such as it is: and from which (few would thinke it) they should draw so many millions yeerely as they doe, as more in particular in the trials of New England you may see; and such an incredible number of ships, that breeds them so many Sailers, Mariners, Souldiers, and Merchants, neuer to be wrought out of that Trade, and fit for any other. I will not deny but others may gaine as well as they that will vse it, though not so certainly, nor so much in quantitie, for want of experience: and this Herring they take vpon the Coast of England and Scotland, their Cod and Ling vpon the Coast of Izeland, and in the North seas, if wee consider what gaines the Hamburgans, the Biskinners, and French make by fishing; nay, but how many thousands this fiftie or sixty yeeres haue beene maintained by New found land, where they take nothing but small Cod, whereof the greatest they make Cor-fish, and the rest is hard dried, which we call Poore-Iohn, would amaze a man with wonder. If then from all those parts such paines is taken for this poore gaines of Fish, especially by the Hollanders, that hath but little of their owne, for building of ships and setting them to sea; but at the second, third, fourth, or fift hand, drawne from so many parts of the world ere they come together to be vsed in those voiages: If these (I say) can gaine, why should we more doubt then they; but doe much better, that may haue most of all those things at our doores for taking and making, and here are no hard Landlords to racke vs with high rents, or extorting fines, nor tedious pleas in Law to consume vs with their many yeeres disputation for Iustice; no multitudes to occasion such impediments to good orders as in popular States: so freely hath God and his Maiestie bestowed those blessings, on them will attempt to obtaine them, as here euery man may be master of his owne labour and land, or the greatest part (if his Maiesties royall meaning be not abused) and if he haue nothing but his hands, he may set vp his Trade; and by industry quickly grow rich, spending but halfe that time well, which in England we abuse in idlenesse, worse, or as ill. Here is ground as good as any lieth in the height of forty one, forty two, forty three, &c. which is as temperate, and as fruitfull as any other parallel in the world.\n\nExamples of the Altitude comparatiuely.\n\nIn Spaine.\n\nIn France.\n\nIn Greece.\n\nAs for example, on this side the line, West of it in the South Sea, is Noua Albion, discouered as is said by Sir Francis Drake: East from it is the most temperate part of Portugall, the ancient Kingdomes of Galizia, Bisky, Nauarre, Aragon, Cattilonia, Castillia the old, and the most moderatest of Castillia the new, & Valentia, which is the greatest part of Spaine; which if the Histories be true, in the Romans time abounded no lesse with gold & siluer Mines, then now the West-Indies, the Romans then vsing the Spaniards to worke in those Mines, as now the Spaniards doe the Indians. In France the Prouinces of Gascony, Langadocke, Auignon, Prouince, Dolphine, Pyamont, and Turyne, are in the same parallel, which are the best and richest parts of France. In Italy the Prouinces of Genua, Lumbardy, and Verona, with a great part of the most famous state of Venice, the Dukedomes of Bononia, Mantua, Ferrara, Rauenna, Bolognia, Florence, Pisa, Sienna, Vrbine, Ancona, and the ancient Citie and Countrey of Rome, with a great part of the Kingdome of Naples. In Slauonia, Istria, and Dalmatia, with the Kingdomes of Albania. In Grecia those famous Kingdomes of Macedonia, Bullulgaria, Thessalia, Thracia, or Romania, where is seated the most pleasant and plentifull Citie in Europe, Constantinople.\n\nIn Asia.\n\nBeyond the line.\n\nIn Asia in the same latitude, are the temperatest parts of Natolia, Armenia,\n\nPage 211\n\nPersia, and China; besides diuers other large Countries and Kingdomes in those most milde and temperate Regions of Asia. Southward in the same height is the richest of Gold Mines, Chily, and Baldinia, and the mouth of the great Riuer of Plate, &c. for all the rest of the world in that height is yet vnknowne. Besides these reasons, mine owne eies that haue seene a great part of those Cities and their Kingdomes (as well as it) can finde no aduantage they haue in Nature but this, they are beautified by the long labour and diligence of industrious people and art; This is onely as God made it when hee created the world: Therefore I conclude, if the heart and intrailes of those Regions were sought, if their Land were cultured, planted, and manured by men of industry, iudgement, and experience; what hope is there, or what need they doubt, hauing the aduantages of the Sea, but it might equalize any of these famous Kingdomes in all commodities, pleasures, and conditions, seeing euen the very hedges doe naturally affoord vs such plentie, as no ship need returne away emptie, and onely vse but the season of the Sea. Fish will returne an honest gaine, besides all other aduantages, her treasures hauing yet neuer beene opened, nor her originals wasted, consumed, nor abused.\n\nThe particular staple commodities that may be had by industry.\n\nAnd whereas it is said the Hollanders serue the Easterlings themselues, and other parts that want with Herring, Ling, and wet Cod: The Easterlings, a great part of Europe, with Sturgion and Cauiare, as the Blacke Sea doth Grecia, Podolia, Sagouia, Natolia, and the Hellespont. Cape Blanke, Spaine, Portugall, and the Leuant, with Mulit and Puttargo. New found land, the most part of the chiefe Southerne Ports in Europe, with a thin Poore-Iohn, which hath beene so long, so much ouer-laied with Fishers, as the fishing decaieth, so that many oft times are constrained to returne with a small fraught. Norway and Poland affoords Pitch and Tarre, Masts and Yards. Sweathland and Russia, Iron and Ropes. France and Spaine, Canuase, Wine, Steele, Iron, and Oile. Italy and Greece, Silkes and Fruits. I dare boldly say, because I haue seene naturally growing or breeding in those parts, the same materials that all these are made of, they may as well bee had here, or the most part of them within the distance of seuentie leagues for some few ages, as from all those parts, vsing but the same meanes to haue them that they doe; but surely in Virginia, their most tender and daintiest fruits or commodities, would be as perfit as theirs, by reason of the heat, if not in New England, and with all those aduantages.\n\nThe nature of the ground approued.\n\nFirst, the ground is so sertill, that questionlesse it is capable of producing any Graine, Fruits, or Seeds, you will sow or plant, growing in the Regions aforenamed: But it may be not to that perfection of delicacy, because the Summer is not so hot, and the Winter is more cold in those parts we haue yet tried neere the Sea side, then wee finde in the same height in Europe or Asia: yet I made a Garden vpon the top of a Rocky Ile in three and forty degrees and an halfe, foure league from the maine in May, that grew so well, as it serued vs for Sallers in Iune and Iuly. All sorts of Cattle may here be bred and fed in the Iles or Peninsulaes securely for nothing. In the Interim, till they increase (if need be) obseruing the seasons, I durst vndertake to haue Corne enough from the Saluages for three hundred men, for a few trifles; and if they should be vntowards, as it is most certaine they will, thirtie or fortie good men will be sufficient to bring them all in subiection, and make this prouision, if they vnderstand what to doe; two hundred whereof may eight or nine moneths in the yeere be imploied in helping the Fisher-men, till the rest prouide other necessaries, fit to furnish vs with other Commodities.\n\nThe seasons for fishing approued.\n\nImploiment for poore people and fatherlesse children.\n\nIn March, Aprill, May, and halfe Iune, heere is Cod in abundance; In May, Iune, Iuly, and August, Mullit and Sturgion, whose Roes doe make Cauiare and Puttargo; Herring, if any desire them: I haue taken many out of the bellies of Cods, some in nets; but the Saluages compare the store in the Sea with the haires of their heads: and surely there are an incredible abundance vpon this Coast.\n\nPage 212\n\nIn the end of August, September, October, and Nouember, you may haue Cod againe to make Core-fish or Poore-Iohn: Hake you may haue when the Cod failes in Summer, if you will fish in the night, which is better then Cod. Now each hundred you take here, is as good as two or three hundred in New found Land; so that halfe the labour in hooking, splitting and touring, is saued: And you may haue your fish at what market you will, before they haue any in New found land, where their fishing is chiefely but in Iune and Iuly, where it is here in March, Aprill, May, September, October and Nouember, as is said; so that by reason of this Plantation, the Merchants may haue their fraught both out and home, which yeelds an aduantage worth consideration. Your Core-fish you may in like manner transport as you see cause, to serue the Ports in Portugall, as Lisbone, Auera, Porta Port, and diuers others, (or what market you please) before your Ilanders returne. They being tied to the season in the open Sea, and you hauing a double season, and fishing before your doores, may euery night sleep quietly ashore with good cheere, and what fires you will, or when you please with your wiues and family: they onely and their ships in the maine Ocean, that must carie and containe all they vse, besides their fraught. The Mullits here are in that abundance, you may take them with nets sometimes by hundreds, where at Cape Blanke they hooke them; yet those are but a foot and a halfe in length; these two, three, or foure, as oft I haue measured, which makes me suspect they are some other kinde of fish, though they seeme the same, both in fashion and goodnesse. Much Salmon some haue found vp the Riuers as they haue passed, and here the aire is so temperate, as all these at any time may be preserued. Now, young Boies and Girles Saluages, or any other bee they neuer such idlers, may turne, carie or returne a fish, without either shame or any great paine: He is very idle that is past twelue yeeres of age and cannot doe so much, and she is very old that cannot spin a threed to make Engins to catch a fish.\n\nThe facilitie of the Plantation.\n\nFor their transportation, the ships that goe there to fish may transport the first: who for their passage will spare the charge of double manning their ships, which they must do in New found land to get their fraught; but one third part of that company are onely proper to serue a stage, carie a Barrow, and turne Poore-Iohn; notwithstanding, they must haue meat, drinke, clothes, & passage so well as the rest. Now all I desire is but this, That those that voluntarily will send shipping, should make here the best choice they can, or accept such as shall bee presented them to serue them at that rate: and their ships returning leaue such with me, with the value of that they should receiue comming home, in such prouisions and necessarie tooles, armes, bedding, apparell, salt, nets, hookes, lines, and such like, as they spare of the remainings; who till the next returne may keepe their Boats, and doe them many other profitable offices. Prouided, I haue men of abilitie to teach them their functions, and a company fit for Souldiers to be ready vpon any occasion, because of the abuses that haue beene offered the poore Saluages, and the libertie that both French and English, or any that will, haue to deale with them as they please; whose disorders will be hard to reforme, and the longer the worse: Now such order with facilitie might be taken, with euery Port, Towne, or Citie, with free power to conuert the benefit of their fraughts to what aduantage they please, and increase their numbers as they see occasion, who euer as they are able to subsist of themselues, may begin the new Townes in New England, in memory of their old: which freedome being confined but to the necessitie of the generall good, the euent (with Gods helpe) might produce an honest, a noble, and a profitable emulation.\n\nPresent Commodities.\n\nKermes.\n\nMusquasses.\n\nBeuers.\n\nMines.\n\nSalt vpon Salt may assuredly be made, if not at the first in ponds, yet till they be prouided this may be vsed: then the ships may transport Kine, Horse, Goats, course Cloth, and such Commodities as we want; by whose arriuall may be made that prouision of fish to fraught the ships that they stay not; and then if the Sailers goe for wages it matters not, it is hard if this returne defray not the charge:\n\nPage 213\n\nbut care must be had they arriue in the Spring, or else that prouision be made for them against winter. Of certaine red berries called Kermes, which is worth ten shillings the pound, but of these haue beene sold for thirty or forty shillings the pound, may yeerely be gathered a good quantity. Of the Muskrat may be well raised gaines worth their labour, that will endeuour to make triall of their goodnesse. Of Beuers, Otters and Martins, blacke Foxes, and Furres of price, may yeerely be had six or seuen thousand, and if the trade of the French were preuented, many more: 25000. this yeere were brought from those northerne parts into France, of which trade we may haue as good part as the French if we take good courses. Of Mines of Gold and Siluer, Copper, and probabilities of Lead, Crystall and Allum, I could say much if relations were good assurances; it is true indeed, I made many trialls according to the instructions I had, which doth perswade me I need not despaire but that there are metals in the Country: but I am no Alcumist, nor will promise more then I know: which is, who will vndertake the rectifying of an iron Forge, if those that buy meat and drinke, coles, ore, and all necessaries at a deare rate, gaine, where all these things are to be had for taking vp, in my opinion cannot lose.\n\nWoods.\n\nOf woods, seeing there is such plenty of all sorts, if those that build ships and boats, buy wood at so great a price, as it is in England, Spaine, France and Holland, and all other prouisions for the nourishment of mans life, liue well by their trade; when labour is all required to take these necessaries without any other tax, what hazard will be here but to doe much better, and what commodity in Europe doth more decay then wood? for the goodnesse of the ground, let vs take it fertill or barren, or as it is, seeing it is certaine it beares fruits to nourish and feed man & beast as well as England, and the Sea those seuerall sorts of fishes I haue related: thus seeing all good things for mans sustenance may with this facility be had by a little extraordinary labour, till that transported be increased, & all necessaries for shipping onely for labour, to which may added the assistance of the Saluages which may easily be had, if they be discreetly handled in their kinds, towards fishing, planting, and destroying woods, what gaines might be raised if this were followed (when there is but once men to fill your store houses dwelling there, you may serue all Europe better and farre cheaper then can the Iland Fishers, or the Hollanders, Cape-blanke, or Newfoundland, who must be at much more charge then you) may easily be coniectured by this example.\n\nAn example of the gaines vpon euery yeere or six moneths returne.\n\nTwo thousand will fit out a ship of 200. tunnes, & one of 100. tuns, if of the dry fish they both make fraught, that of 200. and goe for Spaine, sell it but at ten shillings a quintall, but commonly it giues fifteene or twenty, especially when it commeth first, which amounts to 3. or 4000. pound, but say but ten, which is the lowest, allowing the rest for waste, it amounts at that rate to 2000. which is the whole charge of your two ships and the equipage, then the returne of the mony and the fraught of the ship for the vintage or any other voyage is cleere gaine, with your ship of one hundred tunnes of traine Oile and Cor-fish, besides the Beuers and other commodities, and that you may haue at home within six moneths if God please to send but an ordinary passage; then sauing halfe this charge by the not staying of your ships, your victuall, ouerplus of men and wages, with her fraught thither with necessaries for the Planters, the Salt being there made, as also may the nets and lines within a short time; if nothing may be expected but this, it might in time equalize your Hollanders gaines, if not exceede them, hauing their fraughts alwaies ready against the arriuall of the ships, this would so increase our shipping and sailers, and so incourage and imploy a great part of our Idlers and others that want imployment fitting their qualities at home, where they shame to doe that they would doe abroad, that could they but once taste the sweet fruits of their owne labours, doubtlesse many thousands would be aduised by good discipline to take more pleasure in honest industry, then in their humors of dissolute idlenesse.\n\nPage 214\n\nA description of the Countrey in particular, and their situations.\n\nBut to returne a little more to the particulars of this Countrey, which I intermingle thus with my proiects and reasons, not being so sufficiently yet acquainted in those parts, to write fully the estate of the Sea, the Aire, the Land, the Fruits, their Rocks, the People, the Gouernment, Religion, Territories, Limitations, Friends and Foes: But as I gathered from their niggardly relations in a broken language, during the time I ranged those Countries, &c. the most Northerne part I was at, was the Bay of Pennobscot, which is East and West, North and South, more then ten leagues: but such were my occasions, I was constrained to be satisfied of them I found in the Bay, that the Riuer ranne farre vp into the Land, and was well inhabited with many people, but they were from their habirations, either fishing amongst the Iles, or hunti"
