        "text": "Hugh Martin Smith, 75, of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, husband of Kit Smith, entered into eternal rest Sunday, July 7th surrounded by his family following a courageous battle with cancer. His funeral service will be held Thursday, July 11, 2024 at Saint Andrew’s Church, 440 Whilden Street, Mount Pleasant, SC at 2:00 pm. Arrangements by J. Henry Stuhr, Inc., Mount Pleasant Chapel.\n\nHugh was born August 2, 1948 in Torrance, California, son of Willis and Lorraine Smith. He was a lifelong General Contractor who earned a reputation for his artistic talent for craftsmanship and design. He was an active member of Saint Andrew’s Church and was blessed to be a part of his “Higher Calling” Bible Study for many years. He was an avid car lover and was always looking for the next rare sports car. Hugh loved to travel and enjoyed the outdoors. He had an idyllic childhood spending many weekends at his family’s cabin in the Santa Anita Canyon. He was a proud veteran of the Vietnam War. Hugh’s greatest loves were his family, friends, and best friend (standard poodle) Louis. Hugh leaves a legacy of commitment, kindness, and courage to all who were lucky enough to be in his orbit.\n\nHugh is survived by his wife, Kit Smith, ex wife, Yvonne Gregory, children, Erica Smith, Willis Smith (Shiela) of Mount Pleasant, and Kitta Smith of Cambridge, Massachusetts, sisters, Dianne Ratner of Mount Pleasant, Laurel Smith of San Pedro, California, and many nieces and nephews. Hugh is also survived by his guardian angel, Rosie Frasier of Awendaw. The family would like to thank the wonderful caregivers from Lutheran Hospice for their Godly attention and kindness to our beloved Hugh.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to VFW Post 3137, P.O. Box 185, Isle of Palms, SC or Headforthecure.org in memory of Hugh Smith,https://headforthecure.org/memorials/hugh/ ."
