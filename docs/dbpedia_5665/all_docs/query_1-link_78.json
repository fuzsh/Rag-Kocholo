        "text": "Charles Martin Smith is an American film actor, writer, and director. His Disney roles include D.J. in Herbie Goes Bananas, Farley Mowat and Tyler in Never Cry Wolf, and Longnecker in No Deposit, No Return. He also directed Air Bud and contributed special thanks in Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy.\n\nSmith devoted almost three years to filming Never Cry Wolf and said, \"I was much more closely involved in that picture than I had been in any other film. Not only acting, but writing and the whole creative process.\" He also found the process difficult. \"During much of the two-year shooting schedule in Canada's Yukon and in Nome, Alaska, I was the only actor present. It was the loneliest film I've ever worked on,\" Smith said.\n\nCarroll Ballard, director of Never Cry Wolf, asked Smith to write much of the narration for the film. Smith also performed in a lengthy scene with wolves and caribou in which he was entirely naked.\n\nAs an actor, his other films credits include American Graffiti, The Buddy Holly Story, More American Graffiti, Starman, The Untouchables, and Left Behind: World at War. He also directed films, like Boris and Natasha, The Snow Walker, Stone of Destiny, Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2, and A Dog's Way Home."
