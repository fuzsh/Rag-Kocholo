        "text": "The Sixth Commandment, a new BBC crime drama concerning the deaths of Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin in the village of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire, in 2015 and 2017, aired the first of its four-part series on Monday evening (17 July).\n\nStarring Timothy Spall (Mr. Turner, Secrets and Lies, Hatton Garden) as retired university lecturer Peter Farquhar, Ann Reid as Ann Moore-Martin and Éanna Hardwicke as killer Ben Field, the series tells the real-life story of how Field preyed upon the pair in a bid to get them to change their will, before poisoning Mr Farquhar.\n\nThe show is said to highlight “the devastating effect of isolation and loneliness”.\n\nWhat is The Sixth Commandment about?\n\nThe new BBC drama series tells the true story of Peter Farquhar (Timothy Spall), a gay, retired university lecturer, teacher and novelist who struck up a close relationship with former student and village churchwarden, Ben Field, who was also training to be a vicar.\n\nThe relationship was fake, however. Field, who was also the son of a Baptist minister, proceeded to groom Mr Farquhar for months, convincing his friends and family he had dementia and an alcohol addiction, before steadily poisoning and killing him on 26 October 2015.\n\nField then turned his attention to Mr Farquhar’s neighbour, Ann Moore-Martin (Ann Reid), a deeply religious 83-year-old former headteacher.\n\nAgain, Field seduced her and she was delighted to have found “love” in later life.\n\nShe died of natural causes in 2017 and Field was accused of plotting to kill her but found not guilty.\n\nField was arrested in January 2018, and then found guilty of murdering Mr Farquhar (and acquitted of attempting to murder Miss Moore-Martin) in August 2019 after a jury trial.\n\nIn October 2019, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum period of 36 years.\n\nWhile he was found guilty, Mr Field denied any involvement in either Mr Field or Miss Moore-Martin’s deaths. But during his trial, he did admit to the fake relationships as being part of a plot to get their wills changed in his favour.\n\nDuring his trial, detectives described Mr Field to the court as a psychopath who would have posed an “ongoing danger to society” if he hadn’t been stopped.\n\nJustice Sweeney said Field was a “well-practised and able liar” and had “no doubt” he was a “dangerous offender”.\n\nWho is Martyn Smith?\n\nConor MacNeill (Industry, The Fall, No Offence) plays Martyn Smith in the BBC series.\n\nSmith was a friend of Ben Field and fellow student of Mr Farquhar’s at the University of Buckingham, where the pair befriended the teacher and lecturer.\n\nThe two young men told Mr Farquhar that they wanted to make a documentary about his life and reportedly set up a company devoted to “bringing his career to a wider audience”.\n\nAs well as Field pretending to fall in love with Mr Farquhar and moving in with him, he also orchestrated it so Smith also moved into the retired man’s home as a lodger and, later, Ann Moore-Martin’s and other potential victim, Liz Zettl’s homes, while planning to defraud them of their estates.\n\nAfter Field persuaded Mr Farquhar to change his will to leave him his estate, Smith also benefited, receiving £10,000 after his death.\n\nSmith also delivered 10 letters to Ann Moore-Martin on behalf of Field, while he was on holiday in France, which were part of a ruse to seduce her and groom her to change her will.\n\nText messages between the two men also revealed that Smith was aware of Ben Field’s mirror-writing campaign in which he wrote messages around Ms Moore-Martin’s house in a bid to convince the highly religious woman they were from God and to leave her house to Field.\n\nSmyth, who suffered from depression and anxiety, is portrayed in The Sixth Commandment as being enthralled by Field, but the extent to which he was fully aware of Field’s plans and actions is unknown.\n\nOriginally from Cornwall, Smith was charged alongside Field for the murder of Peter Farquhar and of conspiracy to murder Ann Moore-Martin, as well as multiple counts of fraud and one count of burglary, but was found not guilty of all charges.\n\nHow can I watch The Sixth Commandment?\n\nThe first episode of The Sixth Commandment is available to watch on BBC iPlayer, with the second, third and final episodes available to watch on Tuesday 18 July, 24 July and 25 July at 9pm on BBC One."
