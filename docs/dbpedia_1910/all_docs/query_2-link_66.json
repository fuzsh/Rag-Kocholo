        "text": "Selena’s music has endured over the years, and her ’90s classic Amor Prohibido is proof of that — with its remastered version blasting in at No. 1 on Billboard’s Vinyl Albums chart (dated July 20).\n\nHome to 11 tracks, including the timeless hits “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” “No Me Queda Más,” “Si Una Vez,” and the title track, Amor Prohibido was originally released March 22, 1994 under Capitol Latin/UMLE, and ultimately made history as the first Tejano album to hit No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart.\n\nNow, in honor of its 30th anniversary, the history-making album was released on CD, cassette, and for the first time, vinyl. A special remastered 2024 edition, released under Universal Music Latino, is also available on all streaming platforms.\n\nSelling 10,000 vinyl copies in the U.S. during the July 5-11 tracking week, according to Luminate, the album scores the Latin legend her second No. 1 on the 13-year-old Vinyl Albums tally, following her No. 1-peaking Ones, which spent one week in charge in 2020.\n\n“I’m excited about us even celebrating 30 years of this album of ours,” Suzette Quintanilla, Selena’s sister and Los Dinos drummer, previously said to Billboard. “Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that people would still be jamming to our music and dancing to our songs. I think my brother [A.B. Quintanilla III], Ricky Vela, and Pete Astudillo did an incredible job in writing these songs, and my brother arranging and producing them just shows a part of who we were growing up and what we listened to. It was a different [musical] vibe going on. There’s a little bit of everything mixed in that album—what we all used to listen to and it definitely comes across. It was also a time when our record company let us be us, and do what we wanted to do with our music and this album.”\n\nBelow, Billboard ranks all 10 songs on the remastered Amor Prohibido album:"
