        "text": "FREE SHOW!! BLUES AMBUSH + Animal Piss, It’s Everywhere\n\nA Saturday night free show! A sort of aftershow for the deep in the valley festival!\n\nSkuzzy choogle rock from Philly meets Western Mass twanged out freakazoids.\n\n”Philly’s Blues Ambush brings the swamp bottom bliss of boogie and blues and lets it ooze out of the speakers. Scraping the senses with an amp rattle seance of sludge n’ singe that sends the listener into a deep trance, the band’s latest for Radical Documents is a calculated killer. It’s a windows down, air out the house, shake out the neighborhood kinda platter. The band doesn’t tiptoe around the mission at hand, tearing into a groove” - RSTB\n\nThe country hits keep on coming today. Swinging the focus from cosmic covers to the rougher end of the ranch, the debut from Animal Piss, It’s Everywhere brings a heavy dose of hangover hummin’, cut with a good dose of humor. Though the name feels fit to front a ‘90s noise band, the Pioneer Valley vets aim for a kind of three-day bender country careen, rife with tales of cheap wine, naked barroom romps, late-night rumination, and more than one reckoning with the man on the cross. Filling out the ranks from a heavy bench of RSTB favorites, the band finds members of Pigeons, Wet Tuna, Stella Kola, Sunburned, and Weeping Bong Band on board. - RSTB\n\nView Event →\n\nKID CONGO POWERS & THE PINK MONKEY BIRDS\n\nTHIS SHOW IS SOLD OUT\n\nAn absolute legend in the tub tonight! Kid Congo played in The Cramps, The Gun Club, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. You know the drill here. Will rule.\n\nView Event →\n\nSLOW FAWN + JAMES CORRIGAN + BLACK CURRANT\n\nTICKETS DOORS 7 / MUSIC 8\n\nJames Corrigan has spent over 20 years in NYC composing, recording, and performing a wide range of music, such as free jazz, electronic, generative minimalist pieces as well as song-based work.\n\nWith the desire to dive into an exploration of earnest song writing, Corrigan assembled a live band called Take Time. Taking cues from some of his musical heroes such as J Spaceman and Sonic Boom, Brian Wilson, Lou Reed, Harry Nilsson, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Judee Sill, and The Zombies, he set out to write, perform, and record The Lord Don’t Run. Corrigan creates a pastiche of sounds and influences that tell stories of fictional archetypes both familiar and exotic.\n\nBlack Currant is the avant pop project of Kingston based artist Kelly Martin. They will be previewing new material in anticipation of the release of their first full length album, Fast Ceremony, out later this year. Black Currant builds alien worlds with eclectic sounds, multi-layered textures, pulsing dissonant rhythms. There are haunting vocals, mantra-like choruses, cut with tiny doses of controlled noise. Both familiar and strange, these new songs draw from the subconscious, from dreams, spirit walks, altered states.\n\nSlow Fawn is a collective band of collaborators centered around Sam Cohen (multi-instrumentalist and producer). Regular collaborators are Cochemea, Stuart Bogie, Oliver Hill, Photay and Makaya McCraven. Several albums are slated for release later this year.\n\nView Event →\n\nBATTLE AVE. + The Colorines\n\nTickets\n\nDOORS 7 / MUSIC 8\n\nView Event →\n\nBobby Previte’s Tubby’s Residency #2 - TWO DUOS (one with a third)\n\nBobby Previte’s Tubby’s Residency #2 - TWO DUOS (one with a third)\n\nPREVITE-CHANDLER\n\nBobby Previte: Drums/Knox Chandler: Guitar and electronics\n\nPrevite and Chandler (he of Grace Jones, Marianne Faithful, Natalie Merchant, Tricky, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cyndi Lauper and The Psychedelic Furs), circled each other for years in the New York scene and have now finally collaborated on the vast electro-futuristic PREVITE-CHANDLER.

Cruz Gallego’s pulverizing Sub Pop debut is to get burned down to ashes and burst forth, born anew. Grim Iconic…(Sadistic Mantra), the Tacoma-based artist’s second album, is driven by opposing forces: noisy abstractions and tightly structured beats, anguish and dissolution at the outside world and empowerment within, apathy and catharsis. Grim Iconic…(Sadistic Mantra) weds scouring electronics to hooky songs and Gallego’s powerful drumming in a way that feels visceral and new. It’s his most personal statement to date, at once playful and intent, driven and combustible, total fucking chaos mixed into glints of broken-glass beauty.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Stevenson Ranch Davidians + World Destroyers’ Pleasure Club + La Mirage + DJ Oakley Munson\n\nTickets\n\nDoors 7 / Music 8\n\nTon of stuff going on here and lots of notable names to drop.

Existing since 2006, this cult-like band reveals itself in shifting configurations; making music influenced by the timeless essence of ‘60s psych, folk and soul, woven with strands of early American roots music.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough for you we also have Oakley Munson from the Black Lips spinning tunes all night.\n\nDust off your leather vests for this one!

She creates melodic and experimental music under her own name and in collaboration with friends. Her recordings and live performances range from solo singing to noise improvisations. TJO has composed and performed music and sound for films, theater, and dance performances, and written large and small ensemble experimental architectures. O'Neil began her music career as the bass guitarist and vocalist for the influential Louisville, Kentucky post-rock group Rodan. After their breakup in 1994, she moved to New York, where she joined Retsin, Ida Retsin Family (a collaboration between Retsin and Ida), The Sonora Pine, and The Naysayer. She released her first solo record in 2000.\n\n\"The music of Little Mazarn is a cool float a few feet from the ground through a dimly lit, almost familiar forest. It is quieter than silence, big as everything, still but always moving.

Just don’t ask him to do it, because he won’t. He might do another show this year, but probably not.” Al’s regulars, howsoever biased, speak of his talent like a family secret – Seattle folklore. How many times, and for how many years, has Dean elusively replied to some variation of the question, “When will there be a record?”\n\nThe phrase “hidden gem” would seem appropriate here, but it’s a misnomer when talking about Dean Johnson. He shines bright, in plain sight, and it was only a matter of time before people stopped to take a look. Dean’s gentle and passionate approach to songwriting has inspired many, and his work provides the listener the opportunity to believe once more that a song can be more than the sum of its parts. If you catch even a phrase of his melodies or the sobering tone of his voice, it waltzes its way into your heart like a letter written, signed, sealed, and delivered just for you.\n\nView Event →\n\nDOUGIE POOLE\n\nTHIS SHOW IS SOLD OUT\n\nDoors 7 / Music 8\n\nDougie Poole is a musician and songwriter living in Los Angeles.

Wow. Carl Stone is one of the pioneers of live computer music. He studied composition at CalArts with Morton Subotnick and James Tenney and has composed electro-acoustic music almost exclusively since 1972. When New Music was exiting the loft scene of the 1970s and entering the more commercial realm of the 1980s, Stone guided his art through that transition period by fusing his compositional ambitions with systems of live performance that were simultaneously pop savvy, commercially suicidal, and technologically forward-thinking.\n\nHe moved away from pure electronic sound and was among the vanguard of artists incorporating turntables, early digital samplers, and personal computers into live electronic music composition. An adopter of the Max programming language while it was still in its earliest development at the IRCAM research center, Stone continues to use it as his primary instrument, both solo and in collaboration with other improvisers.\n\nSet times are loose and we are just gonna let the night happen as it happens. Joining in on the fun will be Booker Stardrum and Matt Sargent.

Her 2017 new wave-inspired debut album, Weighing of the Heart, led Pitchfork to hail her as “a songwriter of impressive emotional heft”. After a studio burglary and a trip to Pakistan to see her family, her new outlook on life formed the basis of its 2023 follow-up, DREAMER.\n\nView Event →\n\nPILE + OCEANATOR\n\nSOLD OUT ( SECOND NIGHT ADDED )\n\nDOORS 7 / MUSIC 8\n\nPile is an American indie rock band from Boston, Massachusetts.

Initiated when the producer created a synthesizer patch called “wind,” the nine-song cycle is under the spell of the titular weather element, its compositions touching upon the movement of air’s influence on human existence and emotional states, our hopes and dreams. Windswept, home-rave-ready and ghostly with its machines, brings together the various versions of Photay’s trademark sonic warmth and hardware pastoralism.\n\nLet's celebrate this new release that comes out on Mexican Summer in September.\n\nView Event →\n\nWicca Phase Springs Eternal + Pictureplane\n\nTickets\n\nDoors 7 // Music 8\n\nTubby’s Halloween Bash!\n\nView Event →\n\nCURSIVE + GLADIE\n\nClosed for Happy Hour today.

The original inspiration for the band came from wanting to merge the styles of finger-style acoustic guitar with more improvisational drone elements. A copy of Hans Peter Duerr’s Dreamtime book (a gift from Ben’s friend Rob Fisk) provided the early blueprint for the analogy of fingerstyle = civilization vs. noise = wilderness that was to dominate the first few releases. Early records were recorded on a Tascam 424 mkII four-track and self-released while Ben still lived in Humboldt County. A new record \"Time Is Glass\" is out on Drag City April 26th\n\nChasny is also a member of the psychedelic band Comets on Fire, and has working relationships with Badgerlore, Current 93, and Magik Markers.\n\nTashi Dorji is a Bhutanese guitarist and improvisational musician known for his avant-garde and experimental (read: deeply gnarly, finely arty) approach to music. Tashi’s idiosyncratic take on the instrument, one defined by movement and profound openness to technique, adds up to a post-colonial disembowelment of guitar traditions.\n\nView Event →\n\ngoth/post punk/darkwave/early industrial night\n\nTICKETS\n\nA goth/post punk/darkwave/early industrial event with silent horror visuals.\n\nNOIR, featuring vocalist Athan Maroulis (Spahn Ranch, Black Tape for a Blue Girl) Kai Irina Hahn and Jamie Parganos on live keyboards, NØIR debuted with 'Darkly Near,' (2013).

Citing Brigitte Fontaine, Nico, and Scandinavian choral music as provenance, her music bears the lineage of classic psychedelic folk and can sound, at once, persuasively vintage and strikingly new.\n\nYHWH NAILGUN\n\nThe quartet of Zack Borzone (vox), Jack Tobias (synth), Sam Pickard (drums), and Saguiv Rosenstock (guitar) display an innate ability to translate a primitive spirit into a modern form. Born during the lockdown as an experimental project between Borzone and Pickard in Philadelphia, the group expanded as the two moved to New York, adding Tobias for their debut self-titled EP, which was produced by Rosenstock, who was then integrated into the band. That first collection is one of self-discovery, of finding the tools necessary to make songs within the band’s own ecosystem. They honed in on their own world and their collaborative, close-knit writing process, discovering the essential structures and feelings that make YHWH Nailgun.\n\nView Event →\n\nTHE SHEAVES + CHRONOPHAGE + FAMOUS LOGS IN HISTORY\n\nTICKETS AT THE DOOR! $15!\n\nDOORS 7 / MUSIC 8\n\nTHE SHEAVES - Phoenix, AZ post-punks are touring for the first time in support of their new LP \"A Salve For Institution\" - they combine early 80s UK diy/post-punk with 90s lackadaisical, bedroom indie rock.

In wake of these releases, Editions Mego offshoot Spectrum Spools – run by old friend John Elliott of the band Emeralds – took the punt to release his debut LP, a collection of mutated Techno tracks simply titled ‘LP’. The record gained attention quickly in the Electronic music scene largely thanks to Schofield’s unique production style that separates him from forms of conventional dance music. Whilst the music of Container sits perfectly fine within the genre and is functional enough to blow apart the walls of any club, years on the US noise circuit have given Schofield’s brand of techno a rawness and direct intensity that stands out in the club and crosses over into other sub-sections of the underground.\n\nRuth Mascelli of New Orleans no wave/glam/industrial group Special Interest draws on techno, acid house, ambient, and esoteric lounge music.\n\nNew York, NY.
