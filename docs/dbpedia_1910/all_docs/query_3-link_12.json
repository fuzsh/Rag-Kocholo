        "text": "Downtown Kingston has to be the most influential piece of musical real estate in the world.\n\nPlease note I said Kingston and not Jamaica because the majority of music which exploded globally came from inner city Kingston and not the country at large. In fact, all Jamaican music you can think of, with the possible exception of mento, has its roots firmly planted Downtown.\n\nThe impact of their artists, Rastafarianism and weed use are well-known. However, I want to look at other things.\n\nSo here are 4 not so-straightforward ways Downtown Kingston has influenced the world.\n\n1. Showing Communities you can do it too – Reggae en Español\n\nMany dancehall and dub producers were NEVER professionally trained and by demonstrating that technical expertise does not limit expression, Kingstonians opened the door for all with tape recorders to immortalize themselves and their neighbourhoods.\n\nHere is a typical lo-fi example:\n\nReggae en Espanol from Panama*.\n\n2. Giving people not considered singers chances to perform.\n\nKingston’s music gave those without access to music education a chance to participate by opening up the aesthetics of music. By using devices such as speech rhythm, it allowed many people to perform who might have never had the chance to because they thought they couldn’t sing.\n\nHere is Rankin Taxi from Japan who clearly shows what I am talking about.\n\n3. You could look like anything once you are unique\n\nReggae and dancehall have all types performing within it. Unlike other popular music, you don’t have to have a look, you just need a UNIQUE voice. To show you what I mean take a look at some big Kingston stars below.\n\n4. Soundsystem\n\nThe biggest piece of technology that Kingston has given to the world is the soundsystem. This record player hooked up to speakers created a sense of belonging for so many neighbourhoods across the world and created billions. Here is an example of one in the Philippines which obviously took the soundsystem culture and ran with it.\n\nThe 4 influences here show how much of a sledgehammer Downtown Kingston music has been on world culture.\n\nThank you Kingston\n\nCan you think of anymore?"
