        "text": "The roots of Tejano music are as widespread and diverse as the traditions of the people that invented it. The main root of Tejano or Tex-Mex music is Mexico, where most Tejano artists originated from - but that is only half of the story. Tejano bands are also heavily influenced by the culture of their adopted homeland of South and Central Texas. While most Tejano singers hail from Mexico, it is in the United States where Tejano singers like Carlos Santana, Los Lonely Boys, and female Tejano singers like Selena, \"The Queen of Tejano\" developed their songs and became internationally known.\n\nThis list of the top tejano music bands in the world includes all musicians who have released recordings that have gotten distribution. In fact, these artists are truly the greatest and most famous tejano musicians of all time, with the order being decided and ranked by actual fans.\n\nAny complete list of Tejano bands must include names like ZZ Top, Carlos Santana, Ry Cooder, and Calexico. All important, significant and iconic names in tejano music history, both old school and new wave, deserve your votes; so make sure to choose wisely!\n\nNot only does this list include all new tejano music bands, but it also serves as an accurate compilation of the best examples of tejano music, as well as a good place to start if you're asking yourself, or friends, exactly how to get into tejano music music. Especially since the bands at the top of the list will at the very least be the best choices if you're looking for a list of good tejano music bands with which to start out. No point in listening to them if they aren't actually good or even half-way decent tejano music bands.\n\nThis list answers the questions \"who are the best tejano music bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest tejano music musician ever?\"\n\nIf you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the band's music instead of just voting for the most popular tejano music bands that you might've heard of, but not really listened to closely enough to cast an informed vote."
