        "text": "“¡Baila, baila, baila!”\n\nThis call to “dance, dance, dance!” forms the musical backbone of Latin America’s most famous and popular musical genre—cumbia.\n\nCumbia music is adored from Patagonia, Argentina to Tijuana, Mexico. Any visit to a Latin American country will no doubt be illuminated and accompanied by a background of cumbia music. Furthermore, a panoply of Latin influences makes cumbia music as varied as it is danceable, thanks to its double beat.\n\nLet’s explore this musical style by looking at the colorful history of cumbia and how it evolved through Latin countries.\n\nA Brief History of Cumbia Music\n\nLatin American music wouldn’t be the same without cumbia. This musical genre also tells the tale of the region’s history.\n\nIt was in 1492 that Christopher Columbus first landed in the area that would later be called the Americas. The indigenous cultures he and the Spanish conquistadors encountered were skilled instrument makers with unique music styles across the continent. Percussion, flutes, and trumpet-like instruments existed.\n\nThe Spanish brought their own musical instruments as their empire expanded, trumpets and violins, and vihuelas among them. Spain also brought enslaved Africans. Over the years and centuries, the indigenous, European, and African cultures fused, and new instruments began to appear.\n\nColombia is known as the cradle of cumbia music. The style emerged on Colombia’s Caribbean coast at the end of the 19th century, melding African, Amerindian, and European musical styles. Cumbia blended the Spanish fandango with African cumbé.\n\nWhat Are the Origins of Cumbia Dance?\n\nThe first written evidence of cumbia came in 1840. Enslaved Africans performed a dance at the feast of Our Lady of Candlemas (la Virgen de la Candelaria) where a man and woman performed a gentle courtship dance.\n\nA lady carried a candle to light the steps and keep her dancing partner at a respectable distance. She danced slowly, sliding her feet along the ground with occasional body sways and skirt flicks. Her male partner would sway his arms and “crown” her by putting his hat on her head. The female dancer would occasionally spin and pass the candle close to the man’s face to force him into evasive action.\n\nCumbia’s ever-evolving upbeat tempos and catchy melodies propelled it to a shimmering dance floor success.\n\nWhy Is Cumbia Important to Hispanic Culture?\n\nCumbia’s versatility meant it could be adapted to many dance forms in pairs, as individuals, or as a group. Dancers could stick to set dance routines or solo in the center of a group circle.\n\nThe simplicity of traditional cumbia dance moves and the ready availability of its core musical instruments helped boost its popularity. Cumbia also represents successful ethnic mixing in a joyous manner.\n\nA potent blend of styles within a folkloric context endeared it to millions and catapulted cumbia to the forefront of parties and social gatherings. Its working-class roots and disapproval from the ruling classes also helped cumbia reign throughout the 20th century until the rise of salsa.\n\nThe Colombian cumbia sound spread to neighboring countries in the early to mid-20th century. Mexico, Cuba, Chile, Argentina, Peru, and many more countries began to express their cultures through cumbia.\n\nHow Did Cumbia Music Evolve?\n\nsource\n\nBy the 1940s, cumbia’s reach extended to Cuba, Mexica, and North America. The following two decades saw it spread throughout Central America and South America. Panama, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina; no matter where you went, cumbia was around. And it came in many different styles.\n\nColombian cumbia singer Luis Carlos Meyer Castandet exported cumbia to Mexico. Here, the music blended with the mariachi culture and Caribbean influences. These coastal influences included vallenato, a north-Colombian genre meaning born in the valley, and upbeat folkloric merengue music.\n\nBy the 1960s, Mexican cumbia began to adopt a more electronic sound, making it very energetic. In contrast, Argentina went for a more rock-and-pop version, giving it a swing-type feel. The Peruvian version, often called chicha, had a psychedelic, surf-style sound. Check tracks from Los Wemblers de Iquitos for a cool journey of sound.\n\nGroups of this era, and still today, typically featured many musicians and dancers on stage simultaneously. Often, highly choreographed dance routines occur, usually involving as many members on stage as possible. Some performances see singers act out a love story.\n\nModern cumbia spans everything from country to hip-hop. There are even techno and electronic cumbia styles from groups like Copia Doble Systema. You’ll even find British-based groups releasing their versions of cumbia! The appeal of this rambunctious Latino music reaches far and wide.\n\nWhat Are the Traditional Instruments in a Cumbia Band?\n\nCumbia music’s origins on Colombia’s Caribbean coast made it a percussion-based form. It’s impossible to know the original setup of cumbia groups, but traditional cumbia ensembles usually feature:\n\nA large, double-headed drum played horizontally with sticks called a tambora.\n\nA small hand drum called a llamador, or the caller. This drum is often heard above the band thanks to its clear, open, and high-pitched sound.\n\nThe tambor alegre, or happy drum, has much in common with African musical styles. A tambor alegre drummer is usually quite busy punching out rhythms in cumbia music.\n\nFlutes called gaitas.\n\nThe classic of música Latina is the maracas, and cumbia is no different.\n\nA seed-filled tube called a gauche.\n\nVocals usually come from a solo singer, a solo singer with a chorus, or a chorus of singers taking turns to provide harmonies and melodies. Many early cumbia dances featured songs with no lyrics, but now they come in Spanish, African, and other languages.\n\nWhat Are the Instruments in a Modern Cumbia Band?\n\nModern cumbia styles are vast, and so is the instrumentation. The Peruvian, Argentinian, and Mexican influences on cumbia were strong.\n\nInstruments you may find in a modern cumbia band include accordions, guitars, pianos, and electric bass guitars. Pianists often play on the backbeat along with the llamador drum. Guitars could be acoustic, electric, or Spanish. Legend has it accordions were added after a German cargo ship and its cargo of accordions washed up on a beach in Colombia.\n\nThe percussion section could feature congas, bongos, metal drums called timbales, and even complete drum kits, as seen in Western rock music. Guacharacas provide a scratching rhythm and sound similar to a güiro. Brass is present, with saxophones, trumpets, and trombones often joining to spice up the tunes.\n\nWhat Is the Rhythm of Cumbia Music?\n\nsource\n\nTraditional cumbia’s clave, or rhythmic pattern, was a 2/4 duple. This time signature gives cumbia its driving “oom pah oom pah” upbeat rhythm.\n\nDifferent countries have various time signatures underpinning their cumbia style.\n\nColombia favors a 2/4 or 2/2 time sequence\n\nMexico generally sticks to a 2/2 rhythm structure\n\nPanama has more variety, with 2/4, 4/4, and 6/8 rhythms\n\nSome modern cumbia music includes offbeat rhythms and improvisation known as Latin Alegre, meaning joyful Latin music. The idea is to instill as much creativity and offbeat rhythm to make the piece even more exciting.\n\nThere’s also the slower tempo of cumbia rebajada, while cumbia sonidera brings the scraping beat of the guacharaca to the forefront. Modern cumbia fusions include cumbia-ska, cumbia-reggaeton, and cumbia-dub.\n\nWhat Are Some Classic Cumbia Groups and Songs?\n\nThe breadth of Latin American cumbia music marks this section as almost impossible in trying to please cumbia aficionados. For beginners, the following is a doorway to the wonderful world of cumbia. Many other groups perform their own versions of these hit tracks.\n\nIn no particular order, check these classic cumbia groups and songs:\n\nLa Sonora Dinamita was a Colombian group that helped popularize cumbia throughout Latin America in the 1960s. “Se Me Perdio La Cadenita” is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, and the group still performs today after several band changes and reformations.\n\nColombians dominate the list, with La Pollera Colora (The Red Skirt) by Los Inmortales an unmissable classic.\n\nLos Ángeles Azules formed in Mexico in the 1970s and continue playing today. They added synthesizers and accordions to give their music a modern sound. “Cómo Te Voy a Olvidar” is their worldwide smash hit.\n\nLuis Carlos Meyer Castandet’s hits include La Historia and La Cumbia Cienaguera. Both have that particular upbeat Mexican cumbia sound. In Peru, the classic track is “La Danza de Los Mirlos” by Los Mirlos.\n\nFor guacharaca fans, there’s Colombian Aniceto Molina Aguirre’s La Cumbia Sampuesana. For those searching for an original-sounding cumbia band, Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto, with their “Campo Alegre” hit, is a fantastic starter with its heavy gaita (flute) and vocals.\n\nWhat Are Some Modern Cumbia Songs?\n\nThere have been some worldwide cumbia smashes in the last few decades. Cuban singer Celia Cruz’s “La Vida es un Carnaval” shot to the world’s attention in the 1990s. Raymix’s “Oye Mujer” is a modern classic with almost one billion YouTube views, followed closely by Camilo’s recent “Vida de Rico” hit.\n\nFancy some cumbia with hip-hop? Solares with “La Cumbia del Hip Hop” should hit the spot. For newcomers to Latin American music, the super-smash hit Despacito is not cumbia. This cumbia version by Sonora Palacios can help your ear hear the difference.\n\nExplore this Top 100 cumbia song list for more.\n\nWhat’s the History of Mexican Cumbia?\n\nColombian singer Luis Carlos Meyer Castandet’s emigration to Mexico in the 1940s kickstarted Mexican cumbia. Rafael de Paz and Tony Camargo’s orchestras were vital to the Mexican cumbia uprising.\n\nThe 1960s saw Mexican cumbia shift to a more upbeat electronic sound. In the 1970s, Aniceto Molina moved to Mexico, further promoting cumbia. Popular recordings he released include “El Peluquero” (the barber) and “La Mariscada.”\n\nMexico developed two distinct regions. In the north, there was cumbia norteña with its slower, accordion-backed sound related to ranchera music. The south of Mexico’s cumbia had a quicker pace, with the accordion replaced by a piano or electronic synthesizer.\n\nModern times see Mexican sonideros (DJs) that play cumbia and feature “shout out” lyrics.\n\nIs Salsa and Cumbia Dance the Same?\n\nsource\n\nSalsa and cumbia are similar but, at the same time, very different.\n\nSalsa has a fast tempo and intricate footwork, with spins, turns, and embraces all mixed into a sometimes frenetic pace. On the other hand, cumbia is an easier dance for people to pick up. That’s not to say it’s easy; partners engage in fluid, circular movements while keeping the vibe slightly more relaxed than the technical salsa.\n\nCumbia tends to see the female dancer make shuffling steps while her male dancing partner zig-zags around her.\n\nWhat Three Cultures Does Cumbia Bring Together?\n\nCumbia unites indigenous, African, and European cultures, fused over several centuries. Its origin was the Caribbean coast of Colombia.\n\nWhat Are Two Facts About Cumbia?\n\nThe first fact about cumbia is it’s the national music of Colombia. Secondly, carnival performances are usually at night. They see women holding candles in colorful handkerchiefs in their right hand, perhaps a nod to cumbia’s early roots.\n\nDiscover the History of Cumbia and How It Evolved Through Latin Countries\n\nCumbia has made a long journey since its 19th-century inception, uniting the three cultures of the indigenous people of the Americas, Africa, and European settlers to strike out on its own. Initially frowned upon by the ruling classes, cumbia quickly became the go-to music for the working classes of Colombia.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, no Colombian celebration would have been complete without the persuasive percussion of cumbia-filling dance floors. The first half of the last century saw cumbia expand through Latin America, conquering Mexico, Argentina, and Peru in particular.\n\nBy the 1960s, cumbia was reaching international audiences. The sound had changed immeasurably from its roots, albeit with that same distinctive beat. Indeed, cumbia’s ability to reinvent itself while staying loyal to its heartbeat part explains its longevity.\n\nTraditional cumbia classics still fill the dance floors, while younger generations infuse cumbia with their influences. Listen to enough songs, and you’ll hear boleros, soul, techno, pop, and heart-wrenching ballads, among many other musical genres, all adding their musical dabs of color to the art of cumbia.\n\nIn short, Latin Americans found the cumbia beat to be the perfect blank canvas where they could express their version of the world. Is it any surprise that the history of cumbia and how it evolved through Latin countries resulted in a joyful, diverse, and inclusive art form?\n\n¡Baila, baila, baila!\n\nBrought to you by amigoenergy"
