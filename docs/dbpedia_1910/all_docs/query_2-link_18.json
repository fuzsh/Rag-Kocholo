        "text": "La Delio Valdez\n\nLa Delio Valdez, is a cumbia orchestra created in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2009. As a cooperative of musicians, they have developed their own style based on cumbia as a musical rhythm that unites Latin America as a common language.\n\nLDV takes up the great orchestral tradition of the continent. Its cooperative organization refers to the historical Argentinian Tango Orchestras; its theatricality on stage brings up the great Caribbean Orchestras, embracing powerful and overwhelming sound and dance as their main style feature.\n\nThe orchestra appropriate these traditions in its own way, taking a modern approach where the electric and the acoustic are combined. They have a diversified sound that combines resources from other styles (Andean music, salsa, rock, jazz and reggae) to create a sound that is both traditional and modern: an international and contemporary sound where the mestizo identities of the region are reflected.\n\nIn July 2021, the sixth and last album was released: “El Tiempo y la Serenata”.\n\nIn 2022, La Delio Valdez presents his new album on stage with a tour that includes Mexico (including shows in major festivals Vive Latino and Pa’l Norte), Chile, Uruguay, and 15 cities of Argentina (3 sold-out shows in the mythical Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires).\n\nFor the very first time in Europe during the fall of 2023!\n\nLa Delio Valdez has recorded and shared the stage with international acclaimed artists from the cumbia and Latin American folk music, such as Toto la Momposina, Celso Piña, Los Mirlos, Chico Trujillo, Frente Cumbiero, Pastor Lopez, Julieta Venegas, Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto and Chango Spasiuk.\n\nLa Delio Valdez is\n\n– 15 musicians\n\n– 6 albums\n\n– 553 million views on their youtube channel\n\n– 3.667.000 monthly listeners on spotify\n\n– 487.000 subscribers on youtube\n\n– 340.000 followers on facebook\n\n– 456.000 followers on instagram\n\nPao Barreto\n\nAfter having participated in many “French Latin” bands such as The Bongo Hop, Who’s the Cuban, Cumbia Ya! and Cumbia y Cardón, the Colombian Pao Barreto, settled in Paris for almost ten years, launched last year her solo career with a first album, “Spiralis”, released in spring 2021.\n\nHer compositions draw on a multitude of styles: festive Caribbean rhythms (porro, champeta, cumbia) rub shoulders with highly reverberated electronic sounds, with touches of soul, funk, swing and reggae.\n\nHer texts celebrate the themes which are dear to her: the connection to nature, the cyclical rhythm of everything and the capacity of each one to transform.\n\nLila Downs\n\nLila Downs is one of the most influential artists in Latin America. She has one of the world’s most singular voices, and is known for her charismatic performances. Her own compositions often combine genres and rhythms as diverse as Mexican rancheras and corridos, boleros, jazz standards, hip-hop, cumbia, and North American folk music. Her music often focuses on social justice, immigration, and women’s issues.\n\nShe grew up in both Minnesota and Oaxaca Mexico, her mother is from the Mixtec indigenous group, and her father was Scottish-American. Lila sings in Spanish, English, and varios Native American languages as Zapotec, Mixtec, Nahuatl, Maya, and Purepecha.\n\nShe has recorded duets with artists as diverse as Mercedes Sosa, Caetano Veloso, Juanes, Nora Jones, Juan Gabriel, Santana, The Chieftains, Diego La Cigala, Celso Piña and Toto La Momposina. Chavela Vargas “named” Lila her “sucessor”.\n\nLila has graced the stages of many of the world’s most prestigious festivals and venues including Jazz at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and the Hollywood Bowl. She was invited by Barack Obama to sing at the White House, and has performed at the Oscars for her participation in the film Frida.\n\nLila has recorded 15 studio albums and 2 lives. She has been nominated for nine Grammy Awards and has won six.\n\nLila Downs in numbers\n\nFacebook: 1.500.000 fans\n\nSpotify: 2.007.447 monthly listeners\n\nChaine Youtube: 303.879.650 views\n\nGrammy Awards: 6 (9 nominations)\n\n—\n\nThe Mexican American singer has a stunning voice, a confident multicultural vision grounded in her Mixtec Indian roots. Los Angeles Times\n\nMs. Downs has multiple voices, from an airborne near-falsetto down to a forthright alto and a sultry, emotive contralto. New York Times\n\nFew alternative artists have the dynamic power and range of this bilingual warrior-woman, who has recorded nine albums, earning a Grammy and four Latin Grammys along the way. NPR\n\nNortec Collective\n\nBOSTICH + FUSSIBLE emerged from the burgeoning electronic scene in Tijuana. In 1999 they invented a new style of music called Nortec – a fusion of Norteño (“from the North”) and Techno, founding as well the Nortec Collective.\n\nDocumenting the collision between electronic music characterized by heavy dance beats and traditional forms of Mexican music performed with live instrumentation, Nortec Collective paved the way for a new generation of producers and DJs that have reinvented electronic music from a global perspective.\n\nTheir last album “Motel Baja” was released in 2014 closing their Nortec trilogy with the Grammy nominees “Bulevar 2000” and “Tijuana Sound Machine”.\n\nThe duo has toured for the last 15 years around the globe from Europe to Australia, from South America to Japan and China, also performed in the most important festivals such as Bonnaroo and Coachella – all while still managing to find the time to become iconic artists in their home country of Mexico.\n\nSince 1999, the Nortec Collective musicians have toured throughout the United States, Mexico, Europe, Japan and Latin America. They have played at Central Park’s SummerStage and Irving Plaza in New York, as well as the Winter Music Conference in Miami, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and shows at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Elysée Montmartre in Paris.\n\nThey have done remixes for Beck, Calexico, Ennio Morricone, Kronos Quartet, Leigh Nash, Lenny Kravitz among others…\n\nThe song “Tijuana Makes Me Happy” was on the soundtrack of 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany, the video game by EA Sports, and is the title song of the feature film by the same name.\n\nIn 2016, Nortec collaborated on the production for the music for Cirque Du Soleil’s show, Luzia.\n\nSon Rompe Pera\n\nBorn and raised in the deep outskirts of Mexico City, the Gama brothers are keeping alive the rich legacy of marimba music running through their family with their latest project, Son Rompe Pera.\n\nWhile firmly rooted in the tradition of this historic instrument, their fresh take on this folk icon challenges its limits as never before, moving it into the garage/punk world of urban misfits and firmly planting it in the 21st century.\n\nOriginally performing alongside their father at local events since they were kids, they now find themselves at the forefront of the contemporary international cumbia scene with their sonic explorations of the classic marimba. Their absolute unique blend comes from a typical youthful rebellion, when as teenagers they left behind their upbringing on the marimba and began to play in various punk, rockabilly and ska bands.\n\nNow they’ve gone full circle with the marimba back leading the way, and mixing all of their influences together with their energetic take on the popular instrument, giving it a new twist never before seen in Mexican folk music.\n\nTheir live shows are a sweaty mess of dancing fans, and this garage-cumbia-marimba-punk band (the only band of its kind in the world) never disappoints on stage. Their authenticity shines through as they give their modern interpretation of Mexican, Peruvian, and Colombian classics, as well as their own original material and some surprise covers. The contrast of the traditional marimba with their youthful attitude and street sense connects the audience to the past while they dance into the future.\n\nTheir first album, Batuco, due out on the ZZK label imprint, AYA Records, in 2020, is named after their recently deceased father, and is a representation of everything he taught them growing up, plus their first steps into a new, international career.\n\nUNESCO inscribed the marimba on the 2015 list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nOFFICIAL SHOWCASE WOMEX 2022\n\nCarmelo Torres\n\nAccordion player and composer, Carmelo Torres is considered as one of the main protagonists in the story of Colombian Cumbia. He is the living legacy of Cumbia Sabanera, a rural accordion style of cumbia from San Jacinto, in the Caribbean region of Colombia, influenced by the traditional flutes.\n\nHe learned to play vallenato first, by himself, before he met the ‘King of Cumbia’, Andrés Landero who was his teacher since kid, and started to play cumbias.\n\nSince Landero passed away in 2000, Carmelo’s major concern’s been to carry on his teacher’s legacy, keeping the cumbia genre alive and teaching the youngest.\n\nCarmelo is now knowned as The Accordion Bible. In 2019, Carmelo Torres’ music still smells as the music of the countryside, the sabana is present when he sings about labour works, nature, life and love. Indeed, He lives this new century and the globalization of our world musics as cumbia and vallenato and his music can be danced in nightclubs making part of our generation, looking backwards and towards in the same song.\n\nWith his group, he has performed widely at home in Colombia at caribean festivals winning all the contests and at the prestigious Festival Colombia al Parque in Bogotá in 2013. Torres has also travelled extensively with his conjunto as far as Europe, Australia, South Korea, Morroco and throughout Latin America in México, Panamá, Perú, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brasil.\n\nWOMEX 2019 Official Selection\n\nCandeleros\n\nPsychedelic afro-caribbean Cumbia\n\nDrawing from influences like Cumbia, Merengue, Dub and afro-caribbean rhythms, Candeleros surrender to a sort of exorcism full of differents sounds in which they reach altered states of consciousness. All of this includes percussion sounds coming from the beyond, Andean echoes, cinematic atmospheres and tunes that seem to come from an old episode of The Twilight Zone. Candeleros music is like digging into a postmodernism hole to find the very pure of tropicalismo.\n\nCandeleros is a plurinacional group of six people that come from Colombia and Venezuela. They have their operational center in Madrid, from where they try to expand a multicoloured psychedelic sound to dance. “Echar una candela” is commonly known as the improvised reunion around the tobacco, fire and music. “La candela” also is the measurement for the lights units and their intensity. “Candela” and “fuego” are also used as metaphors for passion, hit and love.\n\nCandeleros goal is to unify the afro-caribbean sounds as a proof of identity, folklore and modernity. William, Fernando, Urko, Sergio, Alex and Andrés come from places where we can listen to rhythms like Cumbia and Son. They have mixed these rhythms alongside with percussion sounds and guitars to create a sort of psychedelic ritual.\n\nDuring their seven years of musical trajectory, Candeleros has performed in differents shows around Europe and United States. They have performed in important festivals such as Sonorama Ribera, Trans Musicales de Rennes (France), Sziget Festival (Budapest), BAM Festival (Barcelona), SXSW (Austin).\n\nIn addition to all of this, Candeleros music can be found in music platforms such as KEXP radio, FIP Radio, Radio Gladys Palmera and Sofar Sounds Madrid.\n\nThe Garifuna Collective\n\nFor more than 10 years The Garifuna Collective has pushed the boundaries of their dynamic, centuries-old musical traditions, breaking new ground with performances that show why UNESCO has proclaimed the language, dance, and music of the Garifuna people of Central America as a “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity”.\n\nThe Garifuna Collective has performed in over 25 countries has been part of the most celebrated Garifuna albums of all time, including the critically acclaimed Wátina, recipient of the WOMEX and BBC World Music Award and voted by Amazon as the Number One World Music Album of All Time.\n\nAfter an intense showcase performance that culminated with the first encore in 15 years at WOMEX, the band is extremely excited to be bringing their music and vibrant culture to the world stage in 2022.\n\nDamas Gratis\n\nDamas Gratis (Spanish for “Ladies’ Night”, literally “Ladies for Free”), creators of the “cumbia villera” (from the word villa, the Argentine equivalent of Brazilian favelas) is undoubtedly the most important cumbia band in Argentina.\n\nDebuting in 2000 in San Fernando on the northern outskirts of Buenos Aires at the hand of Pablo Lescano, Damas Gratis is considered by many Argentinians as the “Maradona of Cumbia” and is today one of the great names in Latin American cumbia; for its history, its trajectory and the popular craze at each gig.\n\nEight studio albums, three live albums, almost two million fans on Facebook, sold out concerts in the four corners of the continent and collaborations with the greatest Latin artists are amongst their achievements to date.\n\nDozens of groups have been inspired by this great band; commonly called “cumbia villera”, having spawned the diffusion of this undercurrent of cumbia, from Mexico to Patagonia, converting it as a standard bearer of the demands of the popular classes. This cumbiera villera, a soundtrack of Argentine ghettos, has for nearly two decades taken the place that the hip-hop movement occupies in our suburbs. Music has become the means of expression of the underprivileged classes.\n\nPablo Lescano is also the first cumbia artist to play in the famous River Plate stadium “El Monumental” in front of 80,000 people, invited by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs in 2008.\n\nLos Mirlos\n\nNamed after a black bird in their native jungle, Los Mirlos are the uncrowned kings of tropical Peruvian Cumbia, or Cumbia Amazonica. The band came together in Lima during the oil boom of the 70s and created a uniquely new and powerful party music inspired by the Anglophone psychedelic rock and surf music of the time.\n\nFast-forward some 40 years, and Los Mirlos have travelled and performed in almost every Latin American country, and are still considered essential for the culture of Amazonian Cumbia, not in the last place because of popular compilations such as “Roots of Chicha”, “Back To Peru”, and “Cumbia Beat Vol. 1”.\n\nSongs like ‘La Danza de Los Mirlos’, ‘Sonido Amazónico’, ‘Lamento en la Selva’, ‘Muchachita del Oriente’, and ‘Chinito en Onda’ are kept in the memory of many people worldwide, who all danced to them at one point of their life.\n\nThe iconic band is well known for the incredible productions of psychedelic Peruvian Cumbia that they have produced since the 70’s. Widely known as the mastermind of the Peruvian-Amazonian Cumbia, they are back to the musical scene to share with the world the Peruvian musical history and the value of it.\n\nMusicians\n\nJorge Rodríguez Grández – Lead Voice/Director\n\nDanny Fardy Jhonston López – Lead Guitar\n\nJorge L. Rodríguez – Second Guitar & Keyboards\n\nUrbano Melitón Ramírez Rojas – Bass\n\nLuis Ramos Gómez – Choirs\n\nCarlos Fernando Rengifo Rodríguez – Conga\n\nGenderson Pinedo Vargas – Drums/Timbales\n\nLa Dame Blanche\n\nLa Dame Blanche intertwines her native Afro-Cuban influences with hip-hop, trap, reggae, dancehall and reggaeton beats. The musical project of the singer and flutist Yaite Ramos Rodríguez recognizes her on stage as a revelation of rap in Spanish, with an energetic performance that mixes the Latin and the urban, the fierce and the sensual.\n\nBorn in a family of musicians, Yaite was raised by sons, rumbas and boleros and began to explore, from the classical flute, the creation of her own musical language. Life took her to perform on stages around the world, collaborating for the first time with Latin jazz, reggae and cumbia artists. These experiences converged in the appearance of La Dame Blanche. From port to port, this mystical character embarks on a ritual that rescues silenced stories from everyday life, and intertwines them with powerful beats that spontaneously dialogue with the feminine company of the flute. Since “Pirata”, her first album release, La Dame Blanche navigates with ease the explosive lyrics of Cuban urban hip hop.\n\nLa Dame Blanche has five albums to her credit as well as numerous collaborations with artists from around the world. For more than a decade, their songs have sought to humbly enter homes as an irreverent shout that empowers and soothes with joy the true things in life.\n\nCumbia All Stars\n\nThey come from the legendary bands of Peruvian Cumbia and, after 40 years, they meet again to play finally together the music they participated in creating !\n\nThis musical wave was a phenomenon that could only take place during the sixties in Peru. A product of the effervescent environment of a decade of rediscovered freedoms, it takes roots in remote cities of Amazonia, and among children of immigrants who gave birth to a musical genre that is now an integral part of the Peruvian identity: Cumbia Huaracha, Amazonian Cumbia or simply Cumbia Peruana.\n\nThe Cumbia All Stars are among the creators of Peruvian Cumbia and they interpret, during their concerts, the most emblematic songs and the forgotten treasures of the repertory.\n\n2013 is definitely the beginning of international achievements. In July 2013, they travel for the first time to Europe, on a successful tour of 18 dates in 10 different countries, among the most famous festivals of european summer, such as Festival Polé Polé (BE), the WasserMusik Festival (DE), the Amsterdam Roots Festival (NL), La Mar de Musicas (SP)…\n\nBack to Lima in August, they start to work on the preparation of their first album, which will be released in January 2014 in Peru. In the meantime, they are invited by the Womex 13 Official Showcase Selection to represent the best of Peruvian Cumbia in Cardiff in October and announce their second European tour in less than 4 months!\n\nBand members :\n\n– Luis Carrillo – Singer\n\n– Lucho Reyes – Lead Guitar\n\n– Cesar Nicho – Rhythmic Guitar\n\n– Manuel Pecho – Bass\n\n– Ernesto Cadenas – Congas\n\n– Hector “Chiquito” Mattos – Bongo / Campana\n\n– Dante Reyes – Drums & Timbales\n\nCollaboration SELVAMONOS PROD"
