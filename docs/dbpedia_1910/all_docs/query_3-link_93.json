        "text": "Alsion Wilson, Consul General, General Consulate of Jamaica in New York: Thank you so much, Mr. Master of Ceremonies. I'm not that short. Mayor Eric Adams, of course, our fantastic commissioner, Edward Mermelstein. I don't see our borough president here yet, but councilwoman, assemblymen and women, my fellow consul generals, of course, the hardest working staff, the staff of the Consulate General of Jamaica in New York, the clergy members present here this morning, Bishop Riley, members of the Jamaican diaspora, ladies and gentlemen, a pleasant good morning.\n\nI know we haven't had the Ackee and saltfish yet, but I'm going to say that one more time. Ladies and gentlemen, a pleasant good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much. I hope we have some Ackee and saltfish back at the consulate. Today, as we gathered to hoist the black, green, and gold, we commemorate not just a date, but the resolute spirit of our people. August 6th, 1962, was more than Jamaica's independence. It was the world's introduction to a nation built on resilience, creativity, and an unwavering belief in the power of one love.\n\nThis year's theme, One Love to the World, is a testament to the influence Jamaica, a small island nation, has had on the world. From the rhythms of reggae music, through the global airwaves, to the unmistakable draw of our dialect, Jamaican culture has become an integral part of the world's fabric. In the United States, our music, fashion, and food have left a permanent mark on our true reflection of the power of one love.\n\nAs we celebrate, let us not forget the journey that has brought us here. Since gaining independence, Jamaica has made tremendous strides. Our economy has grown, education has improved and infrastructure has developed. Yet we acknowledge that there's still work to be done. The progress of a nation is never ever ever truly finished. This annual flag raising is more than a ceremony. It is a symbol of our unwavering commitment to our homeland. It is a reminder of the words of the national pledge.\n\nBefore God and all mankind, I pledged the love and loyalty of my heart, the wisdom and courage of my mind, the strength and vigor of my body in the service of my fellow citizens. I promise to stand up for justice, brotherhood and peace, to work diligently and creatively to think generously and honestly so that Jamaica may, under God, increase in beauty, fellowship and prosperity and play her part in advancing the welfare of the whole human race. Today we recommit ourselves to those ideals.\n\nAs we stand here today, we are part of a larger vision. Jamaicaâ€™s Vision 2030 of a nation where Jamaicans are empowered to reach their fullest potential and that the Jamaican society in place of choice is the place of choice to live, work, raise families, and do business in this world. The vision is within our grasp if we remain true to the principles of one love.\n\nTo the members of the diaspora I say to you you never, ever, ever forget your roots, especially in times of need, as we saw following the hurricane burial where our diaspora members, our mayor, our commissioner, our deputy commissioner, and the consul generals of our neighboring Caribbean islands gathered in support of not only Jamaica, but Grenada and St. Vincent and Barbados. We are the descendants of heroes, men and women who fought for freedom we enjoy today.\n\nAs Marcus Garvey said, a people without the knowledge of their past history, original culture is like a tree without its roots. Let us honor our roots as we build our future. Our national motto, out of many, one people, is the embodiment of one love. We are a tapestry woven from threads of diverse heritage, united in our love for Jamaica and our fellow countrymen. Today, let us celebrate that unity.\n\nThe Jamaican government, under the steadfast leadership of Prime Minister Andrew Holness, remains committed to the advancement of our people. Together, we will build a Jamaica where all can prosper, a Jamaica that is the living embodiment of one love to the world. So as we raise our flag, let it be a symbol of our unwavering dedication to our nation. Let us be a beacon of hope, shining bright for all to see, a reminder of the power of one love. Let us let the world know, Jamaica stands strong. Jamaica stands united. And Jamaica will forever be a nation built on one love. Thank you.\n\nChris Benjamin, Community Relations Officer, General Consulate of Jamaica in New York: Thank you, Consul General Wilson. And I'd like to now invite to the podium Ms. Lamona Worrell, who will introduce the mayor.\n\nLamona Worrell, Assistant Commissioner and Senior Community Advisor, Community Affairs Unit: Good morning again. And the mayor needs no introduction. Let us bring forward the Honorable Mayor Eric L. Adams.\n\nMayor Eric Adams: Thank you. Thank you so much. I think the consul general's words really pierce our understanding of the role that Jamaica has played, not only on the beautiful island of Jamaica, but here in the City of New York.\n\nThis weekend, I had the opportunity to see for the first time the film on Bob Marley and just see what this brother has done and how his words continue to cascade throughout our entire globe, on how he was willing to use the sound of music in his songs to really have us take a self-reflection on who we are as a people. And as the consul general stated, one love. One love, and that's what these flag raisings are about.\n\nBeing the mayor is not only substantive, I must make sure our streets are safe, our children are educated and our businesses continue to grow and thrive, but it's also a symbolism. And the symbolism is to make sure that we show that as diverse as this city is, that we're all part of the city. And this city and this country, it allows you to love your motherland and at the same time embrace your adopted land. You are not told to disband or to turn away your motherland, your spirit, your culture, to see the diversity of what this city has to offer, how we all come together to produce this qualitative product of how we move our city forward.\n\nAnd we need each other, particularly the various immigrant groups that came here to pursue the American Dream. Just reflect on COVID. And as you do so, as I walked the streets and went into my hospitals, I saw the various Caribbean diaspora, India, South, Central America, when you saw how food was continuing to be produced for families, you saw the diversity of those who had come to this country and embraced what this country is all about. Not only did you hum and sing the song of one love, you lived out one love.\n\nWe are who we are because of the contribution of Jamaica and the other Caribbean diasporas and other groups that have come here to say we want to be part of this American Dream and this American experience. I am just so proud to lift the flag here today and watch many of you come here and celebrate your independence. During your independence it was a rise across the entire Caribbean diaspora of no longer being subjugated by the colonial mindset of those who think we cannot have self-determination and willing to be resilient to fight for what we believe is right.\n\nNo greater level of dignity is when a man or woman could determine their own destiny. And you brought that spirit here. And it was not always well taken. You go back in time, when you came from the Caribbean, because of your dialect or because of your way of life, you were demonized and you were looked down upon. You were treated unfairly. But you remained resilient. You showed that you, too, had a right to be in the footprint of America. And because of that, you have been celebrated over and over again. And we're seeing that someone from the Caribbean diaspora is now running to be the president of the United States. That says a lot about your resiliency. And it's the American story. It's the American Dream. And it's the American experience.\n\nOne of the most disappointing days of my life, I say over and over again, is when I was told because I lived in Jamaica, Queens, I was not Jamaican. But we'll be accepting of that. And I want to thank you for coming here today. And the symbol of your acceptance, the symbol of your accountability is right here to the left of me. The men and women of the New York City Police Department, Department of Corrections, department of other public services, they are willing to put their sacrifices so we can all sit under the tree of freedom that they water with their blood and their commitment.\n\nAnd that blue uniform is more than an attire that you wear as you carry out your daily duties. It is a reflection and a symbol of public safety and is a prerequisite to our prosperity and their ability to be sworn members of our department and the Police Department, just as you have joined the armed services to defend what this country stands for. I say thank you to them, and I say thank you to the community. Let's continue to live one love. And today, we raise the flag of Jamaican independence. Congratulations to you, and God be with you all. God bless Jamaica. God bless New York. God bless America. Thank you."
