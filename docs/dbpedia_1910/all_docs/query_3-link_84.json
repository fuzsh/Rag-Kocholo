        "text": "The New Castle Trails Committee is gearing up for the seventh annual New Castle Rides and Reggae and a Little Grass Festival, an event that combines exciting mountain bike races with vibrant reggae and bluegrass music. The festival, set for this weekend, aims to raise funds for local trail development through a series of races and concerts.\n\nThe festival kicks off 2 p.m. Friday with a bluegrass theme, featuring performances from The Lil Smokies, Wood Belly and Them Coulee Boys, setting the stage for a vibrant start to the weekend. The New Castle Dirty Dozen Trail Running Race, a 10k course with approximately 1,100 feet of climbing, will take place at 6 p.m.\n\nSaturday shifts gears to reggae, with a lineup of popular and emerging bands. The day will kick off at 7 a.m. with the New Castle Dirty Dozen Mountain Bike Race, a 20-mile course with approximately 3,800 feet of climbing. Following the race, The well-known band Passafire headlines the day, accompanied by Surfer Girl, Through The Roots, Tomorro’s Bad Seeds, E.N Young and Imperial Sound and Just A Feeling, for a day filled with energetic music.\n\nTrails Committee Chairman Adam Cornely said the festival has become an essential fixture in the community over its seven-year span.\n\n“It started as just a more of a community celebration, fairly small, with bands and more of a group ride kind of atmosphere,” he said. “We realized that it could be used as a way to raise funds to build more trails and its grown into something special. We have nationally-known bands coming out to play this weekend.”\n\nThe festival now draws considerable support from local businesses, with sponsorship support ranging from Grand Junction to Aspen to Eagle.\n\n“It really brings the community and the businesses together for a common goal of raising money for trails,” he said.\n\nRacers can look forward to a variety of competitions during the festival.\n\n“We give out cash prizes for the top finishers, male and female for the 10k trail running race and the bike races,” he said.\n\nThanks to the festival’s success, over 30 miles of trails have been constructed in New Castle, including last year’s notable addition.\n\n“Last year was a key year where we needed the revenue from the event to finish our new trail, which is the Burning Mountain Trail,” Cornely added.\n\nThe Burning Mountain Trail, which opened in 2023, has been a main beneficiary of the festival."
