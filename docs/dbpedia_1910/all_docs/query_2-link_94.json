        "text": "As a country that spans 4,270 km from north to south, Chile has a diverse and interesting culture that is reflected as much in its music as in its national traditions. From traditional “cumbia” music to reggaeton and rock, the music of Chile offers a range of different styles and beats. Many popular artists have become international names on the global stage with their unique take on traditional sounds.\n\nHere is Chile Today’s top 10 Chilean bands from over the years:\n\nLa Ley\n\nLa Ley is one of Chile’s most popular rock bands. A combination of pop and rock, the band has won a Grammy Award and two Latin Grammy Awards. Formed in 1987, La Ley has released eight albums, the most recent in 2016. The band’s second album, “Doble Opuesto,” in 1991 made them stars across Chile, Mexico, and Argentina.\n\nMakiza\n\nMakiza is a hip-hop band featuring lead rapper Ana Tijoux. The group formed in 1997 and released its first album, “Vida Salvaje,” which enjoyed great success. Tijoux helped bring the band into the spotlight with her reputation as an artist who uses music to comment on the social injustice in Chile. As a daughter of parents who were exiled from Chile during the dictatorship, her songs are a way of exploring the sensitive matters of society, which Makiza has continued to do through its lyrics.\n\nGondwana\n\nGondwana is a Chilean reggae band that has enjoyed widespread success across the United States and Jamaica, both popular locations for reggae. The group formed in 1987 and found inspiration from groups such as The Police. Gondwana is still an active and popular group with nine albums to its name and is currently completing a tour of the United States.\n\nGepe\n\nDaniel Sepulveda, also known as Gepe, combines the traditional music of Chilean folk with a unique electropop sound. He has released five solo albums and one as a member of the band Taller Dejao, a techno band which formed in 2002. Gepe has been described as “the new guru of Chilean folk” and is widely popular across Chile.\n\nVilla Cariño\n\nThe music of Villa Cariño belongs to the “New Chilean cumbia” scene which combines a mix of cumbia, salsa, timba, and funk styles. Cumbia originates from Colombia as an expression of African, European, and Indigenous cultures. The band formed in 2001 and has released four albums that have achieved wide success across Latin America.\n\nRead more\n\nHistory Repeats Itself in Chile\n\nLos Tetas\n\nLos Tetas is a Chilean Funk band which formed in 1994 and enjoyed huge success in their early years. The group disbanded in 2004 after multiple changes to the group’s brand and artists, and then reformed later in 2009 with the original four artists. The group’s 1997 album “La Medicina” is widely recognized as one of the best Latin American funk albums of all time.\n\nLos Bunkers\n\nThis Chilean rock band took inspiration from famous bands popular in the 1960s, such as The Beatles. Formed in 1999 by two brothers from Concepción, known as the “cradle of Chilean rock,” their music combines popular rock with traditional Chilean folk. The name “Los Bunkers” pays tribute to their biggest idols – The Beatles, The Kinks, Los Jokers, and Los Sonnys.\n\nChico Trujillo\n\nChico Trujillo is a “New Cumbia” band with a combination of cumbia, ska, reggae and rock. The group frequent performs at the Lollapalooza music festival and has become popular for its easy dance music which pairs perfectly with a Piscola.\n\nMoral Distraída\n\nA similar vibe to Chico Trujillo, Moral Distraída is a band that incorporates Cuban and Uruguayan salsa with a mix of hip-hop and reggaeton. Known for body-positive songs and impressive dancing, the band released its first single in 2010.\n\nNewen Afrobeat"
