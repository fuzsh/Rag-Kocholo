        "text": "The Reggae music style emerged in Jamaica in the late 1960s and became the dominant style there for many years. By the 1970s, it had become an international style that was particularly popular in Britain, the United States, and Africa. It was a voice for oppression.\n\nThe Dictionary of Jamaican English (1980) defines reggae as a form of music based on ska, with a heavy four-beat rhythm driven by drums, bass guitar, and electric guitar. The \"scraper,\" rubbed with a plain stick, adds to the beat. Dub, instrumental music introduced later, is built on the foundation of this drum and bass combination. To heighten the emotional content of their songs rejecting \"white-man\" culture, musicians employ a chunking sound at the end of measures—known as skengay—which resembles gunshots bouncing off the walls in Kingston's ghettos. Skeng, meaning \"gun\" or \"ratchet knife,\" is an apt description of the sound and the tensions associated with ghetto life that reggae encapsulated in its lyrics and rhythms. Hence it became identified with its originators: the \"rude boys\" – would-be gangsters.\n\nRelated:\n\nRas Haitrm: A Musical Connection between Mozambique and Jamaica\n\nDespite the trauma of war, poverty and a generally negative public image, this south-eastern African country boasts positivity through a son of reggae music. Read More »\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Jamaican musicians under the direction of producers such as Duke Reid and Coxsone Dodd dramatically slowed the pace of ska, whose energetic rhythms reflected the optimism that had heralded Jamaica's independence from Britain in 1962. Rock steady, the musical style that emerged was short-lived but paved the way for such performers as the Heptones and Alton Ellis to become famous.\n\nReggae music originated from its roots with an even more profound emphasis on lyrics against social and economic inequality. The genre's new sound, accompanied by a faster beat driven by the bass, was pioneered by influentials such as Toots and the Maytals, whose hit \"54-46 (That's My Number)\" was released in 1968. Other iconic reggae musicians included Bob Marley, Perry, and Jimmy Cliff, whose star performance in the movie The Harder They Come (1972) helped lift reggae onto a global platform. This Jamaican film highlighted how music became a pivotal outlet for oppressed populations to express their grievances; it further celebrated the human resistance to subjugation through its empowering soundtrack.\n\nDuring the formative era of reggae, there was a link established between this genre and the Rastafarian movement. This movement encourages African individuals to return to their homeland, highly regards the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I (otherwise known as Ras Tafari), and approves the spiritual utilization of marijuana. It emphasizes justice and fairness, taking influence from the mystical notions of Kumina; an earlier Jamaican ritual focused on talking to past generations. Reggae artists such as Bob Marley & The Wailers, Burning Spear (mainly Winston Rodney), Big Youth, Black Uhuru, and Culture were part of this mélange. Another popular reggae subgenre was \"Lover's Rock,\" which emphasized passionate love. Musicians like Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, and Maxi Priest from Britain further propagated this style.\n\nRelated:\n\nGhana and Jamaica: What Connects the Two?\n\nNestled within the eastern section of the Blue and John Crow Mountains, in the parish of Portland, Jamaica is a Maroon Town called Moore Town.

This led to the emergence of notable artists such as Aswad, Steel Pulse, UB40, and Linton Kwesi Johnson. Additionally, Marley's influence played an integral role in helping it take off in the United States; Eric Clapton's well-known cover version of Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" was crucial. Bob Marley benefited from his rock market fans' curiosity about marijuana-inspired music. His international success paved the way for fusion with other genres once reggae began to be taken over by multinational entertainment companies.\n\nIn the 1980s and '90s, dancehall deejays refined the practice of rapping over instrumental tracks, effectively carrying on the politicization of music through reggae. This development ultimately led to the emergence of hip-hop music in the United States and a growing appreciation for reggae among African Americans. As we began the 21st century, many members of the urban poor continued to use reggae as their \"lyrical gun,\" a term coined by performer Shabba Ranks, to gain respect in their communities.\n\nRelated:\n\nHaiti-US and Jamaica-US Relations, and a Case for Reparations: Examining Relations Between the US and Formerly Enslaved Nations Part III\n\nWe explore relations between the US and the Afro-Caribbean nations of Jamaica and Haiti, including Marcus Garvey’s Back to Africa movement, Haitian Migration to the US during and after th...
