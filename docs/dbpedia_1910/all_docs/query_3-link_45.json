        "text": "Reggae is a music genre that began in Jamaica in the late 1960s. Most music from Jamaica comes from the reggae style.\n\nThe music has regular chops on the back beat (off-beat). These are called “skank”, and are played by a rhythm guitarist. The bass drum hits on the second and fourth beat of each measure (each bar). These are called the “drop”. Reggae bands also use a bass, a keyboard or organ, and horns.\n\nReggae music is often used by Rastafarian groups. They are usually songs about religion, love and social problems. Bob Marley (1945-1981) was a famous reggae artist.\n\nFamous instruments in reggae music are drums, guitar, saxophone, trumpet and trombone.\n\nReggae was started in 1960 but became famous in the 1970s.\n\nReggae songs often have lots of backing singers.\n\nRapper Snoop Dogg released an album of reggae music in 2013.\n\nSome recent songs, like Cheerleader and Rude are reggae.\n\nReggae is related to ska.\n\nImages for kids\n\nJimmy Cliff\n\nPeter Tosh with Robbie Shakespeare, 1978\n\nTanya Stephens in 2014 at a German Reggae festival\n\nSkank guitar rhythm often considered \"'the' reggae beat\" or .\n\n\"One drop\" sixteenth-note drum pattern\n\nSly Dunbar\n\nRobbie Shakespeare in 1978\n\nIn this typical reggae bass line, the roots of the chords are emphasized, with musical interest created by going from the root down to the fifth of the chord. A dotted quarter note and eighth note rhythm is used repeatedly.\n\nAl Anderson\n\nUB40's former frontman Ali Campbell performing in 2009.\n\nToots and the Maytals performing at the 2017 Coachella festival\n\nUB40 perform in Birmingham, 2010\n\nSee also"
