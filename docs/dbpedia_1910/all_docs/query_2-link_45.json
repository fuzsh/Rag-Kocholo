        "text": "In the second half of the 1980s, a mutant genre took Venezuela by storm. As a Caribbean country, merengue was everywhere, but in 1987, Rhapsodia, a pop rock sextet hailing from the small town of Bejuma, took a bold step and blended it with their popular synth-heavy sound, giving birth to “Nuestro amor.” Tecnomerengue was born, and with it came a new wave of artists who gave people both inside and outside of the Venezuelan borders fresh new dance hits in the years to come.\n\nBut “Nuestro amor” was just the seed; tecnomerengue blossomed by the turn of the decade, and ironically enough, the key figure behind its popularization wasn’t actually Venezuelan. Luis Alva Lescano was born in Peru, and it was there where he developed his craft as a musician, composer, and arranger. He was part of several renowned pop, rock, and go-go bands in his home country, like Los Zodiac, Los Madison’s, and Los Alfiles. He also served as head honcho of Sono Radio, once known as Peru’s most important record label, where he really grew as a producer.\n\nHe arrived in Venezuela in 1978, in search of greater opportunities, and quickly found his way into the local music business. While working with Los Melódicos, the country’s biggest tropical orchestra, he came to realize how to get young audiences into merengue. In the same fashion as Rhapsodia, he grabbed elements of techno pop, like synthesizers and drum machines, and mixed them with the Dominican-born genre, also throwing some Colombian cumbia and Brazilian lambada into the mix. Thanks to his vision, tecnomerengue became the new pop."
