        "text": "I'm not sure if this has already been discussed on this forum, but I was wondering what your feelings were regarding Reggaeton. Most salsa clubs in Portland, OR (my current home town) play Reggaeton and most people either hate it or love it. I actually enjoy it - but not when I'm out salsa dancing. Seriously, when I go salsa dancing I want to dance SALSA - not reggaeton. However, in my car or chilling at home I'll put on some Reggaeton. Some of the artists I like are Kumbia all-starz (really more of a techno cumbia than reggaeton), Angel & Khriz, Rakim y Ken-Y and Daddy Yankee (just a short few).\n\nTHere is good music in almost any genre and then there is bad. Take merengue, for instance, which maybe more people can relate to.... One can have techno merengue where the most important thing is fast drumbeat...crap!! Same with reggaeton. While I don't particularly favor it I particular detest the choice of songs played. If I want to have sex/grind I'll take a girl home... I just don't bother to listen to it anymore. The moment a club starts a reggaeton song I'm out of the door, or to the rest room, or the bar....\n\nwhy spoil the purity of salsa by playing other genres, like reggaeton (or cumbia or bachata or merengue or cha-cha..)?\n\nHmm, cha-cha I would leave off of the list. Since it can be danced on2 it usually gets mixed into the DJ's playlist along with the occasional (2 song limit) merengue.\n\nI've been seeing some of the more \"hardcore salsa dura\" DJ's throwing in one or two bachatas in an otherwise 100% salsa/chacha playlist and at other venues they'll play one reggaeton song at the end of the night after the last salsa has played just for fun.\n\nReggaeton is Not Salsa\n\nFriggin' right!! Reggaeton is not salsa!\n\nIf I want reggaeton, and I don't, I'll go to what is billed in Canada as a Latin night in the nightclubs. That's when the guys in the baggy clothes, 'do rags, screwed up baseball caps, weird finger gestures and oversized sneakers grind into some willing women and do their thing.\n\nThe music mix listed from most to least is Reggaeton, Cumbia, Merengue, Salsa. There are fights as there is a lot more drinking and posturing with knots of gansta posers and there are nasty bouncers at the door searching the guys before they go in... Not my idea of a fun evening.\n\nIf I want salsa, and I do, I'll go to what is usually billed as a Salsa night. No baggy clothes, or baseball caps thank you. The music mix is salsa, with a bit of merengue, bachata, cumbia and cha cha. Very few fights, bouncers are a little nicer, atmosphere is a lot more relaxed. No posturing from the baggy clothes set either.\n\nLike one of the previous posters, I don't have any use for racing music merengue or speeded up/chipmunked bachata. I've had words with the DJs on that too. The only thing I can think of when they play it is they want to wear the crowd down and drive them to the bar.\n\nI've also had words with DJs and promoters who start slipping reggaeton into the salsa nights and have walked out. Don't waste my time on a salsa night with reggaeton.\n\nSome places on a Friday or a Saturday night - especially the night clubs - will pack the place and play reggaeton as they make money off the bar. Fine, just don't advertise it as a salsa night. At least I can then choose a place that is running 80-90% salsa and get what I've paid for.\n\n:lol: I have to laugh. I love reggaeton! I don't care for the 'bump and grind' or the 'in your face' rauchiness of it. But, I have seen Cubans dancing it and it is amazing. I think my very first exposure was at a club on the continent with a lots of Dominicans there. I didn't know where to look and some of the girls were wearing very short, flared skirts! :shock: Then I saw some Cubans dancing it and was blown away - not literally of course, as I am still here! lol!\n\nIn some recent salsa songs, I hear the reggaeton rhythm and will use some of the reggaeton moves, just as I sometimes hear samba and use those. (I have also heared tango but my tango isn't as strong, lol!)\n\nI think it comes down to what you have seen/what moves you know. For me, reggaeton isn't only bump & grind but some wonderful isolations. But then again, some people (non salsa dancers) think that salsa is a very sexy dance and for me, it is just a wonderful dance!\n\nAventura do a song called Ella y Yo and I love it! I also like Don Omar and a couple of the Daddy Yankee ones. :banana: (No smart Alec to tell me that Ella y Yo and ones like that are Reggaeton 'Romantica' please lol)\n\nI know that some (a lot?!?) of the lyrics in general can be explicit but, that is where I thank my lucky stars that my knowledge of spanish almost zilch!\n\nI like variety in the music. And dancing socially for me is FUN!\n\nDoing multiple spins every darn Salsa song is not!\n\nDancing is supposed to bring people together and make them feel good, no?\n\nSometimes I enjoy listening to Romanian traditional music at the end of a good party. Gosh, we have some fast and tiring dances!\n\nMy idea of a perfect Salsa night is 70% Salsa and the rest a mix of Bachata, Merengue, Reggaeton, Cha Cha Cha and \"Latino\" hits (like Shakira).\n\nI usually stay for the whole party and get really bored if the music is not varied.\n\nWhen we organise the party, it is mostly Salsa (about 90%) and the rest bachata. I don't like it, especially if I have to listen to the same Salsa beat all night long (sometimes it's hard to say when the next song starts as they are all the same). Of course, the mix depends on the people who come, but most of them expect a lot of Salsa. Maybe because our regular club plays so few...\n\nBecause it's boring to listen to the same kind of music all night long?\n\nUmm...not for me! There are so many different types of salsa and cha-cha that I can dance it all night. And I hate reggaeton--it has the same beat over and over and over. Drives me nuts. I can take one song but that's it! Bahchata I only like dancing with a very skilled dancer or the person I'm dating ..\n\nI do agree with TT that clubs cannot survive on salsa alone, as much as we would like them to!\n\nI'm not sure if this has already been discussed on this forum, but I was wondering what your feelings were regarding Reggaeton. Most salsa clubs in Portland, OR (my current home town) play Reggaeton and most people either hate it or love it. I actually enjoy it - but not when I'm out salsa dancing. Seriously, when I go salsa dancing I want to dance SALSA - not reggaeton. However, in my car or chilling at home I'll put on some Reggaeton. Some of the artists I like are Kumbia all-starz (really more of a techno cumbia than reggaeton), Angel & Khriz, Rakim y Ken-Y and Daddy Yankee (just a short few).\n\nI think reggaeton is a tool that dj's use to get all the girls on the dance floor, similar to that Shakira song. I only like dancing reggaeton with one group of friends who speak Spanish, and who seem to have a lot of fun singing along with the song, and who are really shameless on the dance floor. Their shameless brings my shameless out of me ."
