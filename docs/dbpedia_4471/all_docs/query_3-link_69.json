        "text": "Juelich is a town in the district of Duren, in the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Juelich is well known as location of a world famous research centre, the Forschungszentrum Juelich and as shortwave transmission site of Deutsche Welle. As a border region between the competing powers in the Lower Rhine and Meuse areas, the town and the Duchy of Juelich played a historic role from the Middle Ages up to the 17th century. Juelich is first mentioned in Roman times, along an important road through the Rur Valley. Today, Juelich is mainly known for its world famous research centre and the satellite campus of the Fachhochschule Aachen.\n\nTop Attractions Within Juelich\n\nThe Elisa Fountain in Aachen, located near Juelich, is a classical building by the architects Johann Peter Cremer and Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The venue was named after Princess Elizabeth Ludovica of Bavaria. The architecture of this 266 foot long drinking fountain consisted of a central rotunda, two lateral portico wings as a promenade. There is a music room, a snack room and a kitchen. The palace is a wonderful place to visit, that must not be missed.\n\nSuermondt Ludwig Museum in Aachen, near Juelich was founded in 1883 and its names was given after its first major donor, the steel entrepreneur, banker and art patron Barthold Suermontdt. The collection of the museum is quite impressive with wonderful 12th to 20th century tapestries, large stained glass windows dating back to the Middle Ages, drawings, and paintings by Goya, Durer and Rembrandt.
