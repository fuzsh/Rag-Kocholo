This is yet another important addition to the CODART website in our aim to be the best guide to Dutch and Flemish art in museums worldwide. In each synopsis you can read about the size of the collection, the main highlights, and artists, and which media are represented from which periods. All texts were written by curators of the collection in question.\n\nThe descriptions show the breadth and density of museums in Germany. Among the represented museums are state collections, city museums, and historic houses. From well-known museums such as the Städel Museum Frankfurt, the Gemäldegalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin and the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum. But one can also read about the many regional museums, palaces and cultural associations for example the Schleswig-Holsteinisches Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf, Kurpfälzisches Museum der Stadt Heidelberg or the Kulturstiftung Dessau-Wörlitz.\n\nInformation about these museums with significant collections of Dutch and Flemish art and their new collection texts is available in our museums section. Unfortunately, not all museums have a synopsis yet. We aim to provide a text for these collections as well in the near future. Are you a curator of a German museum that does not yet have a description on the CODART website, then please contact us.\n\nThe CODART website currently includes circa 150 texts for various collections in the USA, Canada and Central Europe. We aim to publish collection texts for many more collections in its database. By doing so, the CODART platform strives to provide easy access to Dutch and Flemish art in museums worldwide, including many smaller and lesser-known collections that hold artworks of exceptional importance but are not well known.\n\nUnited Kingdom"
