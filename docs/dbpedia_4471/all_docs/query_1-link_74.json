        "text": "\"Re-Fashioning Flânerie: the Urban Flâneuse & Women’s Experiences of the Modern City\" This paper will revisit Janet Wolff’s argument, made in “The Invisible Flâneuse: Women and the Literature of Modernity,” that the Flâneur can only be understood as a pre-20th century male figure and Flânerie limited to urban experiences of the male observer-writer. In light of recent scholarship that finds Wolff’s argument outdated and limited (and that begins where Deborah Parson’s work in Streetwalking the Metropolis ends), I will offer a reading of several works of late-19th and early 20th century literature—bookended by Baudelaire’s “A Une Passante” and Storm Jameson’s “A Day Off” and including novels by Collette, Dreiser, and Rhys—that chronicle the experiences of women engaged in urban practices typically gendered feminine that are not merely characteristic of what we might call female flânerie, but that also arguably created the conditions for the emergence of the urban Flâneuse. Such practices include, but are not limited to: various types of “street-walking”; window-shopping and other forms of sartorial observation and appraisal; female consumerism; the homelessness and vagrancy of the urban “kept woman”; and the paradoxical tension between the commodification of female identity and the two-way female gaze that both internalizes and critiques capitalist commodity culture and masculinist economies of exchange that oppress women. The central threads weaving together feminine experiences of the city include fashion, sartorial and commodity, and urban exchange economies that paradoxically and simultaneously include and exclude women from their circulations, as either producers or consumers. The observations and experiences of women living in cities—women who not only walked through and worked in the city, but who also observed urban spectacle and participated in the same aesthetic and social critique of the Flâneur—offer both a narrative and a critique of feminine experience of the modern city from women’s point of view.\n\nDiscussions of the conception of that exemplar of the late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth century urban modernity, the flâneur, have focused on both critique of the figure’s masculinity and more radical and nuanced conceptions of women’s flânerie. This article considers both the re-gendering and ungendering of flânerie in the character of three flâneuses in fiction published in the 1870s, 1880s and 1910s: Madame Sidonie, Henrietta Stackpole, and Elsie Bengough, and related dissonances and synergies in the career and work of London actress and cartoonist Marie Duval, active 1869-1885. It will argue that changes in types of reading supervened upon the boom in the production and distribution of serial publications, during this period, resulting in the embodiment of new female professional identities, relative to both changing experiences of urban life and changing experiences of reading. The article makes a distinction between new ideas of these types of urban professional woman and the development of the identity of the New Woman after 1894. It examines the historic comprehensibility of the fictional flâneuses to readers of Zola, James, and Onions, according to the new opportunities and prohibitions that constituted lived experiences of the developing urban entertainments industry of the period, in Duval’s comic strips and vignettes in the weekly London magazine Judy, or The London Serio-Comic Journal.\n\nThe flâneur is well-known for being the most emblematic nineteenth-century observer of urban life. Critics have often compared the flâneur to a camera eye which records everything and insisted on the predominance of sight over other senses in the cognitive process. I would like to lay emphasis on the embodiedness of the flâneur’s vision, which is an experience of all the senses. I would like to envisage the whole of the flâneur’s body as a surface on which the city leaves its imprint. The city is a space whose sights, sounds and smells are constantly changing and mutating. The city space can be envisaged as a ‘metabolic space,’ in which ‘the links between background and figures are very unstable’ (Augoyard). The moving body of the flâneur, which can adapt to this changing space, seems to be in an ideal position to apprehend the metabolic body of the city. The flâneur’s whole body is a perceptive surface which allows things in. He makes his way through the sounds, smells, tastes and textures of the city as well as through its sights. The flâneur is not only ‘an eye impaled on a stake’ (Wittgenstein), he is ‘a living eye’ which communicates with all the other senses and captures the whole experience of moving through the city. His body might be compared to a seismograph that not only registers all kinds of sensory impressions but also translates and transmits them. By looking at texts by Balzac, Baudelaire, Dickens and Charlotte Brontë, I will demonstrate that flânerie is a sensory activity that shapes our perception of the city as much as the city shapes our own flâneries by transforming our bodies into scribes who write the ‘thicks and thins of the urban text.’ (De Certeau)\n\nIn this article the flâneur is imagined as a woman, a radical shift from the nineteenth-century conception of the flâneur who merely consorted with prostitutes and shopgirls, never seeing them as equals or as having a rightful ‘place’ in the public arena of the city. The concept of the flâneuse is investigated to ascertain the possibility of her existence and presence in the city. The article thus questions the gender of the flâneur and suggests that flâneuse does not have the same freedom to stroll the streets as her male counterpart as a result of the intricate connection women have with consumerism, specifically by being an object sa well as a subject of consumerism. On this account women’s position in consumer society is explored from the position of the prostitute and being the object of male gaze and desire."
