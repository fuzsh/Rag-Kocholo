The Centre’s publications provide an insight into lively diversity and continuing relevance of the Dutch Golden Age. They offer original studies on a wide variety of topics, ranging from Rembrandt to Vondel, from Beeldenstorm (iconoclastic fury) to Ware Vrijheid (True Freedom) and from Batavia to New Amsterdam. Politics, religion, culture, economics, expansion and warfare all come together in the Centre’s interdisciplinary setting. Editorial control is in the hands of international scholars specialized in seventeenth-century history, art and literature.

These terse acknowledgements can only begin to express the depths of my gratitude. My study of Hals and his paintings began as my doctoral dissertation under the watchful eye of Mariët Westermann at Rutgers University. Her unflinching support and provocative commentaries have propelled this project, as well as my understanding of northern European art, more generally. Most formatively, she offered the advice that sticks in my mind every time I sit before my computer – write so that readers see what I see. Perry Chapman, Sarah McHam, and Catherine Puglisi all provided rigorous and thoughtful feedback to my dissertation that pushed my interpretations in new directions. I hope that they recognize my answers to their questions in what follows. While at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Ronni Baer stood as my model for her exacting attention to detail and thoroughness. She also helped me learn important lessons about how to balance one’s professional and personal lives. She has taught me more, about more, than she will ever know. The Netherland-America Foundation, The Graduate School of Rutgers University, and several Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York Research Awards funded opportunities to conduct research in the Netherlands and examine paintings by Hals in European collections. While undertaking this research, several individuals deserve special thanks. At the Stichting Restauratie Limburg, through the Amsterdam-Maastricht Summer University, René Hoppenbrouwers and his staff helped teach me how painters paint. My dear friends Tico and Iris Seifert proved the most hospitable of hosts first in Berlin, and later in Edinburgh, and did wonders connecting me with colleagues throughout Germany. Especially during our shared time abroad, Adriaan Waiboer served as my sounding board over many, many lunches at the RKD and excursions to local watering holes. Cécile Tainturier shared her office with me many years ago in Leiden, supplying all manner of advice in the process, and, more recently, facilitated research in Paris. In Haarlem, Pieter Biesboer shared then unpublished research, and offered advice and inspiration to a younger scholar. I also wish to thank others who have contributed to this project directly, or to my intellectual growth, more broadly: Susan Anderson, Matthew Baigell, David Bergeron, Myra Berman, Marten Jan Bok, Peter van den Brink, Edwin Buijsen, Marietta Cambereri, Bill Clark, Marcus Dekiert, Laurel Dial, Blaise Ducos, Charles Dumas, Martin Eidelberg, Frima Fox Hofrichter,\n\n7\n\nacknowledgments\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nPeter Hecht, Dagmar Hirschfelder, Julie Hochstrasser, Frederick Ilchman, Natasha and Narayan Khandekar, Elmer Kolfin, Gerbrand Kotting, Barbara Lane, Walter Liedtke, Bernd Lindemann, Rhona MacBeth, Mirielle de Mareveld, Kevin Murphy, Uta Neidhardt, Petria Noble, Andrea Norris, Saander Paarlberg, Jim Saslow, Gero Seelig, Suzanna Simor, Eleanor Skolnik, Seymour Slive, Eric Jan Sluijter, Sara Smith, Linda Stone Ferrier, Annette Stott, Judy Sund, Anna Tummers, Lisa Vergara, Ulrike Villwock, Dennis Weller, Ernst van de Wetering, Arthur Wheelock, Joanna Woodall, and Michael Zell.

At Amsterdam University Press, first Maaike Groot and later Anniek Meinders led me through the process of transforming my manuscript into a book. One could not ask for better, more attentive guides. Inge van der Bijl served as a tireless editor who shepherded the text through the production phase with the most attentive of gazes. At various intervals, Christine Waslander offered invaluable contributions. During the review process, both Frans Grijzenhout and Hans Vlieghe made salient suggestions for strengthening my arguments. Thanks, too, to Eric Jan Sluijter for undertaking the crucial colorproofing so that readers can see Hals's mastery for themselves. Publishing a book as well-illustrated as this one is an expensive undertaking. Financial support for this publication has been supplied by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds, the Netherland-America Foundation, the Historians of Netherlandish Art Research Fellowship, and a Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York Research Award. With unparalleled aplomb, Otto Naumann identified and secured crucial contributions from private individuals. I thank in particular Mr. and Mrs. Thomas A. Saunders III and an anonymous donor for their generosity. At Queens College, Barbara Lane advocated for financial support on my behalf and Dean Tamara Evans generously allocated much-needed funds. Finally, I would like to thank my family. My mother and father long ago taught me invaluable lessons about hard work, perseverance, and the joys that come with stimulating the mind. As my role model, I have always benefited from chasing my sister’s examples. My stepparents and every member of the extended Matt family have offered all manner of encouragement. My son Oliver has brought immeasurable joy and wonder, providing frequent relief from the rigors of scholarship. My wife, Sharon, has lived with this book as long as I have. I cannot begin to express my boundless gratitude for her patience, and empathy. She variously supplied a critical eye, a supportive ear, and an open heart at all the most opportune moments. None of what follows could have been possible without her.\n\n8\n\nI n Tr o du CTIon\n\nI n Tr o du CTIon\n\nTwo formative experiences I had with paintings by Frans Hals inspired and shaped this project. In my first semester of graduate school I stood before the portrait of Claes Duyst van Voorhout (fig. 92) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There, I confronted the image of a robust Dutch burgher who seemed to be brimming with confidence and vitality. Rather than poring over costume details or paraphernalia, though, I was struck by an overriding sense of technical brilliance in the execution. I marveled at the painter’s graceful touches of the brush – short jabs at the elbow, broad sweeps at the contours of the shoulder, daubed highlights at the cheek and nose. To put it differently, I was engrossed not with the “what,” but with the “how.” While this way of viewing might be natural for an artist, it was an epiphany for me, as I came to the discipline as a student of cultural history. A few years later, I made my maiden trek to the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem. About halfway through the galleries, I turned the corner to see Hals’s late group portraits of the regents of the Old Men’s Almshouse (figs. 59 and 60). As soon as my eyes met the portraits I stopped in my tracks. Standing a good fifteen meters or more from the canvases, I could clearly see Hals’s bold brushwork. To take but one passage, the knee and calf of the seated figure at the far right read as bold handling of the type more common to the 1950s New York School. I found it hard not to imagine how anyone could have seen Hals’s patchwork of red, white, and black as anything other than strokes of paint. Perhaps inspired by the setting – the museum is the Old Men’s Almshouse – and certainly influenced by my art history studies, I began to wonder how Hals’s original audiences experienced the pictures and to ponder the unmistakable facture employed to craft them. To excavate how seventeenth-century viewers saw the paintings I turned to early written characterizations of Hals and his art. Theodorus Schrevelius’s 1648 characterization of Hals’s art illuminates some of the ways the painter’s work was understood in his lifetime: “Nor can I let this pass in mute silence, Frans and Dirck Hals, brothers, of whom one excels almost everyone with the superb and uncommon manner of painting which is uniquely his. His paintings are imbued with such force and vitality that they seem to breathe and live.”1 Squarely focusing on the way that Hals painted, Schrevelius’s brief characterization succinctly captures the three-fold impact of the artist’s handling: it was lively, unique, and masterful. Similarly, the first biography of Hals, published in 1718 by Arnold Houbraken, described the painter’s process as follows: “They say that it was his custom to lay his portraits on thick and wet, only applying the brushstrokes later with\n\n11\n\nintroduction\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nthe words: ‘Now to give it the master’s touch.’”2 Houbraken’s labeling of Hals’s ultimate strokes as the self-consciously applied “master’s touch” emphasizes the painter’s artistry, subjectivity, and agency. The responses of Schrevelius, Houbraken, and others variously refute and/or problematize longstanding opinions about Hals’s manner. While these early accounts address the vitality of his method, scholars have considered that Hals used his vigorous brushwork merely to activate his subjects, ignoring other ways in which it functioned. At the same time, none have explored why Hals would have sought to enliven his subjects through his brushwork and the selection of momentary gestures and expressions, or why seventeenth-century audiences would have appreciated and cultivated such an artistic approach. Since the late nineteenth century, criticism also has oriented Hals in relation to later artistic movements.3 While Hals’s influence on later painters has had a significant impact on the history of Western art, considering his art almost exclusively in relation to the art it inspired rather than from its sources and contemporaries essentially jettisons it from the temporal and cultural contexts of its production. As recently as 1990, for example, Claus Grimm described Hals’s rough manner as a “peculiar quirk” in seventeenth-century Holland.4 Indeed, until Pieter Biesboer unequivocally demonstrated that the artist’s sitters and clients were members of the economic and cultural elite in Haarlem, Hals and his paintings were widely believed to have been misunderstood and unappreciated by the painter’s contemporaries.5 To date, no study has attempted to build upon Biesboer’s findings by exploring why Hals’s rough manner appealed to the painter’s clients. This book is the first to explore how, why, and to what ends Hals consciously cultivated his technique, style, and aesthetic. I approach the topic from different angles in each chapter – seventeenth-century art theory, economic and market forces, the workshop and early modern notions of authorship, relationships to high-end contemporary Flemish painting, and active selffashioning programs by the artist and his clients, among others. The various conclusions offered by each chapter complement one another and yield an understanding of the multiple levels on which Hals’s manner of painting operated for himself, his contemporaries, and later viewers.\n\nPainting and Style Frans Hals was a painter. We can classify Hals’s contributions as art and label him an artist, but he produced paintings exclusively. This is in contrast to contemporary figures such as Hendrick Goltzius and Rembrandt who successfully worked in a variety of media. Even more unusually, not a single drawing by Hals – preparatory or otherwise – is known to exist. He surely must have struck pen to paper at some point, at least during his studies, but the complete lack of surviving drawings indicates how central painting was to Hals. Hals has frequently been lauded as a “painter’s painter.” I understand this designation to mean that Hals was not only a master painter but also that his works take full advantage of the medium. Put differently, Hals’s pictures operate as paintings in an almost Greenbergian sense.\n\n12\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nintroduction\n\nTake the iconic Jolly Toper as an example (fig. 36). At the most basic level, the viewer encounters an image of a solitary male figure gesturing outward with a half-full glass of beer. Hals has rendered the figure naturalistically with an animated gesture and a convivial facial expression. The nondescript backdrop, near monochrome palette, flattened passages such as the broad brim of the hat, and the unblended brushwork that punctuates areas like his left sleeve, however, disrupt the sense of pictorial illusionism. The painting is neither an Albertian window nor a mirror of reality, strictly speaking. Instead, at even the earliest moments of engagement, the viewer’s experience of the represented subject is self-consciously mediated through paint. One almost immediately understands the image to be not an illusion of the subject, but a painting of that subject – a two dimensional figure rendered on a flat support with paint. In other words, Hals crafted paintings that look like paintings, and look like they were painted. Painting can be a verb and noun, describing both the act of applying pigment to a support and the resulting product of that act. Early sources corroborate this dualism. Writers insistently characterized Hals’s pictures as made objects. In their reading of Hals’s manner of execution, both Schrevelius and Houbraken, for instance, convey a keen awareness of the pictures as painted matter. Concurrently, each author emphasized Hals’s working methods and the act of creation. Doing so cast individual paintings as products of Hals’s actions and stressed the artist’s agency. More so, the texts relay that personal factors such as personality, ability, and taste shaped the image’s final appearance. In the process, the writings of Schrevelius and Houbraken raise the specter of style. As Meyer Schapiro noted, the distinct and distinguishing formal elements that result from an artist’s direct personal, if not personalized, intervention are the very definition of style.6 Style, however, has a complicated history in the study of Dutch art. Variously, the search for attributions and the untangling of iconography have held scholars’ attention more raptly. Even Svetlana Alpers, who offered alternative interpretative modes to iconological approaches by rooting images in scientific observation rather than textual amplification, derided discussions of style.7 As Walter Liedtke has argued, the naturalism, seeming or otherwise, of much early modern northern European art seems to have distracted from the study of style.8 Scholars too frequently have taken the means of representation for granted in their search for meaning exactly because the pictures appear so natural. As Liedtke has cogently put forth, though, naturalism, regardless of other attendant issues, is in fact a style. Rather than a default mode of representation, it is a cultivated aesthetic that differs from other visual forms. Recent poststructuralist critiques have also surely contributed to the diminished status granted to style in art historical studies more generally. Fear of devolving into simplistic formal analysis has held considerable sway. As this book argues, though, analysis of style need not be equated with formalism or structuralism. Explorations of style enable us to approach how early modern artists and audiences saw and comprehended visual material. This is because formal concerns were fundamental to these viewers. Philip Sohm has articulated how discussions of style were rampant in early modern Italy.9 Though Sohm found that innumerable definitions of style existed, nearly all art literature from the period invoked or grappled with elements that we can classify as stylistic. Though many of the specific relations still need to be disentangled, much northern European art theory is either\n\n13\n\nintroduction\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nrooted in or a response to Italian aesthetics, art literature, or both. To invoke but one example, Karel van Mander, whose 1604 Het Schilderboek set the course for verbal engagements with Dutch art, based his book on Vasari’s Vite after an extended period of living and working in Italy. As a rejoinder to the debate on iconological and emblematic interpretations of Dutch paintings, Eric Jan Sluijter advocated turning to seventeenth-century art literature to see what features interested period audiences.10 As Sluijter found, these sources largely ignore analysis of subject matter. Rather, as Sohm identified in Italian art literature, Dutch texts generally demonstrate intense engagement with the appearance and quality of specific objects. This is certainly true for contemporary accounts of Hals and his paintings as each of these texts focuses almost exclusively on aesthetic appearance, form, and manner. As a result, I understand the meaning of Hals’s art, at least in seventeenth-century terms, to rest in matters of style. As Ernst van de Wetering has argued in relation to the work of Rembrandt, style and process are interdependent.11 The way an artist paints dictates how a picture will look. If an artist wishes to produce a painting in a particular style, a corresponding method must be selected in order to achieve the desired appearance. Consideration of a painter’s style, therefore, necessarily requires deliberation on the artist’s method. Firsthand examinations of a large sample of Hals’s autograph works from all periods of his career, combined with the results of valuable pre-existing technical examinations of his paintings, have provided a measure of access to the painter’s process.12 Thanks to existing technical studies of other artists in Hals’s milieu, particularly Johannes Verspronck (1606/9-1662) and Jan van Goyen (1596-1656), it has been possible to compare several methods employed in Haarlem in the first half of the seventeenth century in order to posit which features were common in the city and which were unique to Hals.13\n\nSubjectivity Hals’s stylistic trajectory reveals his intentionality. Initially, Hals worked in two divergent modes – one smooth and refined for portraiture, and one rough and unblended for generic types. Hals maintained this stylistic differentiation for nearly twenty years before transferring his painterly manner to portraiture in the 1630s, the same time he stopped producing genre pictures. Focusing exclusively on portraiture for the next thirty years, Hals gradually but consistently accentuated a sketchy aesthetic. For example, though surface-level wet-in-wet passages connote the speed of execution that often accompanies a sketch, scientific examination proves that Hals layered paint atop dry layers and carefully worked up his images over several sessions. In this way, Hals did not dash off painted sketches, but he encouraged viewers to think that he had.14 This brief outline of Hals’s production exposes several key points. One, Hals was capable of working in more than one style, at the same time. Two, Hals could and did consciously decide when to work in each of these different fashions. Three, the abandonment of fine detail and the increasing looseness of his paintings must be understood as deliberate and intentional. In other words, Hals intentionally selected, constructed, and employed his style.\n\n14\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nintroduction\n\nHals’s chosen manner was distinctive and highly personalized, if not unique. Schrevelius made the point most explicitly when calling Hals’s style “the superb and uncommon manner of painting which is uniquely his.”15 For Schrevelius, Hals’s mastery rested on a highly individualized and imminently discernable aesthetic. Indeed, Hals’s paintings differ significantly from those of his contemporaries in the Dutch Republic, especially those in his local environment in Haarlem. It does not take a connoisseur to distinguish a painting by Hals from those of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Verspronck, or Jan de Bray. Each artist produced highly divergent visual forms even though their paintings are figural and naturalistic. What distinguishes Hals most is his sketchy manner of representation. Increasing the roughness and degree to which his strokes were unblended placed a greater premium on those features that make his art different. Even more so, Hals seems to have deliberately emphasized the individualized elements of his paintings not only through calligraphic handling wherein individual strokes stand as the artist’s trace, but also by working ever looser. Hals’s rough manner operated as a signature style. My definition of this term derives from Richard Wolheim’s articulations of the concepts of individual style and signature. Wollheim posited that individual style is personal and intentional, while signature elements are distinctive items that reveal authorship but are not necessarily employed intentionally.16 As such, these two features are rarely one and the same, but as Wollheim acknowledged, a particular artist may intentionally employ the distinctive pictorial elements that constitute his or her individual style for the purpose of making his or her authorship known. I call the confluence of Wollheim’s concepts “signature style.” As Schrevelius’s estimation signals, the painterly aesthetic that dominates Hals’s creations has repeatedly been considered to be intrinsically distinctive so that one can convincingly argue that Hals’s authorship is readily apparent. Conceiving of Hals’s rough manner as his signature style illuminates the interconnections between subjectivity and style. Stephen Greenblatt’s seminal book Renaissance Self-Fashioning thrust subjectivity – the property of being a subject – into scholarly discourse on early modernity.17 Focusing on the writings of the sixteenth-century English authors Sir Thomas More, William Tyndale, Sir Thomas Wyatt, Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare, Greenblatt probed how these individuals recognized their individuality, and in the process became active subjects rather than passive objects. As an active subject, the individual then fashioned or shaped his or her identity based on accepted social conventions in an effort to improve or enhance his or her station. Myriad texts produced across Europe such as Machiavelli’s The Prince, Castiglione’s The Courtier, and Montaigne’s Essays suggest the breadth of the phenomenon and, in turn, the preponderance of interest in self-reflexive subjectivity. Descartes’s famous proclamation “I think therefore I am” provides the most succinct statement of this phenomenon. Descartes wrote and published these words in 1637 during the twenty years he lived in the Dutch Republic. Perhaps not coincidentally, Hals painted a portrait of Descartes in the late 1640s.18 Following Greenblatt, artistic motivations have often been investigated in relation to the projection and production of early modern subjectivity, especially in the Dutch Republic. Perry\n\n15\n\nintroduction\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nChapman successfully applied Greenblatt’s formulations to her study of Rembrandt’s self-portraits.19 Chapman argued that Rembrandt’s evolving attempts to understand and shape his own persona are registered in his self-portraits. On somewhat different terms, Alpers treated Rembrandt as a self-aware artist who, through his manipulation of paint, crafted a market identity for himself, which in turn established a high value for his art.20 Several succeeding studies, most notably the catalogues that accompanied the exhibitions Rembrandt by Himself and Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt, continued to consider the ways in which the artist fashioned his personal and artistic identities, sometimes in ways that limit or critique the very possibility of such identifying mechanisms in painting.21 In the 1990s, Chapman, Mariët Westermann, and Celeste Brusati considered how other painters such as Jan Steen (1626-1679) and Samuel van Hoogstraten (16271678) also pursued self-fashioning programs in their art.22 As a result of these important studies, it has become widely understood that artists actively attempted to craft artistic and market images for themselves and that they did so through their pictorial methods. Still, these studies have tended to focus on self-portraiture, including embedding the artist’s face within larger compositions, rather than on matters of style or execution. Hals rarely painted his own visage. Instead, he fashioned his artistic persona through brushwork and paint. His brushstrokes recall not only the act of painting but Hals as the maker of the marks and the creator of the picture. As in modern connoisseurship wherein discerning viewers divine attribution from distinctive features and personalized representational features, Hals communicated his authorship through inimitable marks that differ from those of other artists. As a result, stylistic elements stand as signs for and of the artist, or his artistic and market personae, within the work of art. In early modern terms, as Georges-Louis le Clerc, Comte du Buffon wrote in 1753, “style is the man.”23 And, stylistic elements are the means of fabricating and communicating that persona. To put it simply, Hals embedded his subjectivity in his paintings through his signature style.\n\nThe Market Early modern notions of subjectivity were, and are, frequently conceived in market terms. To take perhaps the most famous and most succinct example, John Locke explored individualism through the metaphor of property. In his 1689 Second Treatise of Government, Locke wrote: “every Man has a Property in his own Person. This no Body has any Right to but himself. The Labour of his body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are properly his.”24 C.B. Macpherson influentially labeled Locke’s ideas, and those of the sources that inspired him, as “possessive individualism.”25 As Macpherson interpreted Locke, the individual is the sole proprietor of the self and, being an individual – being a subject – constituted self-ownership. For Locke, ownership of one’s self also meant possession of one’s labor, and the fruits of that labor. From this position, Locke continued to argue that personal labor transformed communal property into private property because the individual had acted upon it. In contemporary phrasing, property becomes personal once an individual embeds his or her own subjectivity in it. Importantly, Jerrold Siegel has demonstrated how Locke conceived and formulated his ideas away from court culture and in direct\n\n16\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nintroduction\n\nresponse to contemporary commercialism rampant in the urban centers of the time.26 As the example of Locke suggests, early modern notions of subjectivity were increasingly understood in commercial terms and were shaped by experiences with the various markets that individuals encountered daily. Like Locke, while Hals maintained and cultivated a considerable degree of agency, his signature style and the subjectivity embedded therein were shaped, at least in part, by market forces. As he was a professional painter, it would be naïve to think that economic concerns did not affect him. Likewise, one should not forget that while Hals and his contemporaries considered painting to be an art, it was also a business. Hals’s self-consciously individualized artistic means and products developed as personal responses to economic features of the art market in which he worked. The art market in the seventeenth-century northern Netherlands was varied. Works of art changed hands through indirect sales outlets to an unprecedented degree rather than solely through direct patronage. In addition to making sales from their studios, artists sold their wares through dealers, auctions, and lotteries, among other venues. In so doing, they often worked on spec not knowing whom, if anyone, would purchase a work of art. This is not to say, however, that commissions were wholly absent. Portraiture depended on direct means of exchange. As both a painter of portraits and of genre scenes, Hals participated in each facet of the market. Numerous studies, especially those of John Michael Montias, have begun to elucidate with greater clarity that the Dutch art market – both in terms of commissions and indirect sales outlets – was intricate, sophisticated, and highly competitive.27 The art market in the Dutch Republic also rested largely on the exchange of paintings. This was certainly true in Haarlem where Hals worked almost exclusively. The population of Haarlem was 39,455 in 1622. Between 1615 and 1625 twenty-five artists joined the guild.28 Between 1625 and 1635 another fifty joined, so that by 1635 there were eighty-four artists registered.29 Not only is the ratio of artists to citizens high, but the number of active artists increased dramatically. Many of these figures, though not all, specialized in one or two genres, but even still there were several artists who worked in each genre. Take portraiture, Hals’s primary line of production, for example. Cornelis van Haarlem (1562-1638) and Frans Pietersz. de Grebber (1573-1643), who were both a generation older than Hals, frequently ventured into the genre. Pieter de Grebber (ca. 1600-ca. 1653), Salomon de Bray (1597-1664), Johannes Verspronck (1606/9-1662), and Pieter Soutman (ca. 1580-1657), along with Hals, constituted a second wave of portraitists. The younger painter Jan de Bray (ca. 1627- 97) entered the market in the later decades of Hals’s career. Specialization by subject matter was not enough to carve a niche in the market, as there was always competition for commissions. Painters needed to differentiate themselves and their products even further. Stylistic differentiation and specialization emerged as a means of creating a unique market identity and therefore of achieving a competitive advantage. Hals’s rough manner was advantageous because it carried the potential for numerous positive associations. His painting roughly elicited comparison to valued current and historical master painters like Titian, Rubens, and Van Dyck who worked with broad, unblended strokes.\n\n17\n\nintroduction\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nVenetian and Flemish artists also frequently utilized a sketch aesthetic that enabled sophisticated viewers to imagine the painter at work and marvel at the virtuosity of his individual touches. Working in an analogous manner, Hals was able to offer clients a related aesthetic experience. A sketchy mode also enabled Hals to showcase his virtuoso handling and mark his paintings as high-quality works of art. In addition to offering evidence that contemporaries valued Hals in this way, this book probes how these aesthetics and concomitant notions of quality operated in the early modern art market and how they participated in defining monetary value. As a result, one can see how Hals’s distinctive manner helped the artist craft an image as a virtuoso of the highest rank with a concurrent financial advantage. To invoke contemporary parlance, Hals used style to create a brand – a collection of perceptions or associations embodied in an object. In this way it is possible to posit that the intersections of style and subjectivity developed not only alongside the market economy, but most likely because of it.\n\nEarly Modernity Hals developed his signature style during the period that scholars recently have begun to describe as early modernity. More traditionally, at least in art historical terms, the seventeenth century has been defined as the Baroque, a temporality distinct from the earlier Renaissance. No one in the seventeenth century used the word Baroque to define themselves or their time. Rather, Baroque – or, as a stylistic rather than temporal term, baroque – is a later appellation that describes the theatrical exuberance of much Italian art of the period. While the art of Hals and Rembrandt often displays related aesthetics of movement and theatrical lighting, baroque does not adequately describe Dutch aesthetics or the cultures of the Dutch Republic. Alternatively, early modernity identifies art and culture as antecedents of and precedents for the modern eras of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Of course, the term early modernity presupposes that elements of modernity were already active, or at least in development, during the seventeenth century and earlier. As Ann Adams has recently delineated, many of the writings on subjectivity that mark the onset of early modernity and the philosophical debates that surrounded them frequently appeared in the seventeenth-century Netherlands.30 They are worth repeating here. Montaigne’s Essays first published in Paris in 1588 were reissued in Leiden in 1602.31 Consequently, Montaigne directly impacted Dutch writers like Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert, Hendrik Laurensz Spiegel, and Pieter Cornelisz Hooft.32 During his twenty-year tenure in the Dutch Republic, Descartes published the first edition of Discours de la Méthode in 1637 in Leiden and a second edition of Meditationes de prima philosophia in 1642 in Amsterdam, just one year after it appeared in Paris.33 Like Montaigne, Descartes and his writings influenced many Dutch intellectuals like Constantijn Huygens who engaged Descartes in a lengthy correspondence.34 John Locke reworked his Essay Concerning Human Understanding in 1683-4 while he was in Holland and published a resumé of it in 1688 in Amsterdam before returning to England later that year.35 These instances and the debates that followed them in the universities of Leiden and Utrecht begin to illuminate\n\n18\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nintroduction\n\nthe centrality of the northern Netherlands in the discourses that have come to signal the modern era, or at least its dawn. Likewise, both the Dutch economy at large in the seventeenth century, and the subset of the art market, displayed modern characteristics. Jan de Vries and Ad van der Woude claim that the Dutch Republic was “the first modern economy.”36 They base their assessment on the conscious efforts to maximize economic well-being (by individuals, corporations, and political bodies), and dynamic and innovative social processes that improved the efficiency of production and distribution (urbanization, education, mobility, and monetization). A market economy that relies on the production and consumption of commodities is widely understood as one of the leading conditions of modernity.37 Most simply, commodities are items created expressly for exchange.38 One can rightly claim that paintings functioned as commodities in this sense for Hals and his contemporaries, as they were most frequently produced with the explicit intent of being sold for money. In turn, we can begin to perceive the commodification of art and culture that, in part, also signals the modern era.39 Style and formalism are modern concerns in their own right. Numerous examples abound in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Gautier and Ruskin’s promotion of “art for art’s sake” depend on these twinned features, Matisse and Picasso’s experimentations that took pictorial form as their point of inspiration, and the writings of Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg attend primarily to stylistic matters, to list but three. The early modern era was also highly engaged with issues of style. In 1673, Giovanni Battista Passeri wrote that “today it is fashionable for painters to do nothing but squabble among themselves about manner, taste, and style.”40 Passeri’s point of reference was Italy, but his assessment succinctly frames the point for Hals and his contemporaries as well. The stylistic features of facture, technical achievement, compositional variety, and other formal characteristics were highly prized features in seventeenth-century aesthetics, perhaps especially Dutch ones. Peter Hecht has even suggested that Dutch painters and viewers valued the form of paintings to the point that the concept of art for art’s sake may have already been current in Hals’s lifetime.41 Indeed, though the art produced in the northern Netherlands shared a largely naturalistic bent, the diversity of representation and execution suggests that personalized and subjective creation was valued, too. Even the primacy of painting may be considered a modern typology. Though the exact process and the reasons behind its occurrence have yet to be adequately explained, painting has been granted privileged status in formulations of modern art and its histories. One need only scan art historical survey texts to see how many more paintings are treated than are examples from other media. With notable exceptions, of course, most figures included in the Western art historical canon were exclusively, or at least primarily, painters – Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Matisse, Kandinsky, O’Keeffe, and Pollock, to name but a few. Perhaps painting could more completely undertake the self-critical examination of the nature and forms of art, as Greenberg argued.42 Or perhaps painting has become aligned with modernity due to its perceived lack in antiquity. It has long been known that painting was an important art in ancient Greece and Rome, but much of that knowledge has come from ekphrastic descriptions of works that are no longer extant. Rather,\n\n19\n\nintroduction\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nthe primary records of the visual arts of antiquity are sculpture and architecture. The same can be said of medieval art, with the exception of manuscript illuminations. Thus, painting might have been associated with a more recent time. Whatever the reason, it is worth noting that painting also took pride of place in the art of the Dutch Golden Age. To be sure, individuals worked in the full range of media then available, but far and away the most common and best regarded approach was painting. One might be able to argue, therefore, that the prevalence of painting was yet another typology of modernity already active in the Dutch Republic. Though Hals’s fame has fluctuated with changing tastes, nearly every posthumous response to Hals and his paintings belongs to discourses on modernity in art. Most explicitly, a Belgian art journal proclaimed in 1883, “Frans Hals c’est un moderne.”43 While Frances Suzman Jowell has studied the revival of interest in Hals in the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly Thoré-Bürger’s role in inspiring this resurrection, the continued characterization of Hals’s art as modern from the eighteenth century to the present has thus far not been examined.44 Understanding modern as a stylistic rather than a temporal term, though the term “modern” was not applied to Hals until the late nineteenth century, the concepts embodied by the word were associated with the artist from at least the earliest extended analysis of his work published in 1718. Through critical review of the posthumous responses – verbal and visual – to Hals’s manner, it becomes clear that the multifaceted features of Hals’s style – roughness, sketchiness, liveliness, seeming spontaneity, virtuosity, calligraphic handling, self-referentiality, and materiality – all came to be signs of modern painting. As the combination of these elements, Hals’s signature style came to be designated as modern in its own right. This early perception of his rough manner eventually led to critical neglect in academic circles in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and likewise may have led to Thoré-Bürger’s resurrection of Hals and the painter’s subsequent ascension to the heights of the artistic pantheon in the late nineteenth century. In other words, Hals’s modernity is not a nineteenth-century construction. One must ask, therefore, if he is inextricably interwoven into the discourse on the modern and into the modern aesthetic itself. Or, as the contemporary British painter Lucian Freud put it, is Hals “fated always to look modern.”45 Recognizing his manner as inextricably modern, Hals’s work also signifies the pronounced modernity of the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century and perhaps the art produced therein. Understanding the modernity, or at least proto-modernity, of both Hals’s art and aspects of the Dutch Republic begins the process of reintegrating the artist into his social and cultural contexts. That Hals grappled with style and form in highly innovative ways that influenced legions of self-proclaimed modern painters like Manet and Van Gogh places him at the fore of the modern Western tradition. Yet, developing an original aesthetic does not put Hals ahead of his time. To the contrary, as this book re-envisions, Hals was very much a man of his time. Through the representative medium of painting, Hals’s art engaged contemporary aesthetic discourses. His paintings also registered and produced his personal and artistic subjectivity in an era when these concerns were central. In turn, each of these processes and agendas were supported, enabled, and encouraged by seventeenth-century market conditions and practices. In other words,\n\n20\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nintroduction\n\nHals may be symptomatic of his time, cultural context, and emerging projects of modernity exactly because of his signature style of painting that is, in so many ways, modern.\n\n21\n\nCha p te r 1\n\na livelineSS uniquely hiS\n\nC h a p Te r 1\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nNor can I let this pass in mute silence, Frans and Dirck Hals, brothers, of whom one excels almost everyone with the superb and uncommon manner of painting which is uniquely his. His paintings are imbued with such force and vitality that he seems to surpass nature herself with his brush. This is seen in all his portraits, so numerous as to pass belief, which are colored in such a way that they seem to breathe and live.1 —Theodorus Schrevelius, 1648\n\nSchrevelius’s brief characterization indicates that Hals’s contemporaries found his manner of painting lively and unique.2 As naturalism in its various forms was the dominant mode of representation in the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century, praise for an artist’s ability to create a “living image” was a standard trope for many writers, but Schrevelius’s description differs from common literary adulation by addressing both the effect of vitality that Hals was able to achieve and the means by which he crafted it.3 Indeed, with Schrevelius’s words in mind, we see more readily how different Hals’s vivacity was from that of both his predecessors and his contemporaries, especially in portraiture. This chapter explores the vitality of Hals’s imagery, the techniques he developed to render his subjects as lively, and the ways in which Hals’s conception and execution differ from the representational strategies of his contemporaries, especially those of other portraitists in Haarlem. Since it has always been taken as a given that Hals worked spontaneously and directly, none have systematically considered why he sought to craft lively imagery or how exactly he created the illusion of spontaneity in a multi-stage process. I will describe how Hals used broad, unblended strokes and stark contours to convey a sitter’s energy, animation, and temporality, which in turn rendered his subjects as distinct individuals. This approach distinguished his paintings from those of others. While Hals was not the only painter striving for naturalism, his manner was as unique as Schrevelius described.\n\n25\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nFig. 1.

Private Collection.\n\nLively Paintings/Painting Liveliness The pendants of Stephanus Geraerdts (fig. 1) and Isabella Coijmans (fig. 2), both from about 1650-52, introduce how Hals employed temporal signs to craft extremely lively figures. Cocking his head to his right, Geraerdts stands casually with his left arm akimbo. His left hand dangles a glove as he extends his right hand across his body towards the portrait of his wife that originally hung immediately to his left. With her body torqued at the neck and shoulders, Coijmans turns slightly to offer her husband the rose that rests across the barely closed fingers of her right hand. The two figures reach out to each other, unifying the canvases and creating a play across the space that separates them. Like the gap between the hands of God and Adam in Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel fresco, the tension between the outstretched limbs captures the act of reaching, simultaneously suggesting the prior extension and subsequent meeting of their hands. The reaching gesture that connects the two figures most likely derives from Anthony van Dyck’s engaged pendants of Peeter Stevens (fig. 4) and Anna Wake (fig. 3) from 1627 and 1628, respectively, which were produced during the Flemish artist’s second period in Antwerp. Also like Van Dyck, Hals staged a transitory moment through each sitter’s facial expression. Mirroring their gestures, they turn their heads and lock their eyes on one another. Coijmans has turned up the corners of her mouth into a smile, forcing her rouged cheeks close to her glimmering eyes. Though more\n\n26\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nFig. 3.

The dramatic lighting illuminates the connection between the couple and partially cloaks the exterior fringe of the two paintings. As a result of these features, viewers seem to encounter a fleeting moment. Executed late in his career, in many ways these two portraits constitute the culmination of Hals’s distinctive approach. In the first ten years of his career, Hals’s portraits only hinted at the vivacity of those of Geraerdts and Coijmans. In the Portrait of a Man in Birmingham (fig. 5) and its companion now in Chatsworth (fig. 6), both from about 1611-12, each figure turns and gestures slightly toward the other, but their overall appearances are considerably more still.4 Rooted in Mannerist gesticulation, the man’s cradling of the skull, like his outward gaze, engages the viewer rather than his pendant wife. Instead of implying movement, each figure holds a static pose that stabilizes, but also inactivates, their appearance. Hals’s portrait of a man holding a miniature in the Brooklyn Museum presents a slightly more vivacious figure (fig. 7). While setting the man within a fictitious oval frame, a common conceit at the time, the right hand overlaps the frame to create the impression that he occupies the viewer’s space as much as he does that of the picture. At the same time, the elbow lies parallel to the picture plane so that any projection is subtle. Likewise, while the cheeks appear somewhat flushed, the eyes, mouth, and other features stand immobile, at rest. Not long after, in 1616, Hals painted Pieter van den Morsch (fig. 8) with considerably more verve as a result of the cocked head and squinting eye. Such touches of increased activity begin to impart more vitality to the sitters. Some four years later, Catherina Hooft and Her Nurse from\n\n27\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nFig. 5.

Both figures smile, somewhat mischievously. Their cheeks appear ruddy and flushed with life; their eyes glimmer in the light. Each and every detail of their faces aims to give the impression of living figures. Furthermore, the child steadies herself against her nurse’s chest with a tiny outstretched arm, the first momentary activity in Hals’s portraiture. Hals’s visualization of transitoriness derives from his early occupation with genre painting and group portraiture. In his earliest genre picture, the Shrovetide Revelers from about 1615-16 (fig. 10), Hals depicted a raucous crowd celebrating a last chance at frivolity before Lent.5 The stock carnivalesque character Hans Worst, identifiable by his sausage adornments, beams at the viewer as he crowds the young maiden in front of him. She too takes an active stance – gesturing either to give her male companion pause or to keep time to music – as she looks away to some other element of the merriment that encircles them. Though not as brightly painted, fellow celebrants fan out from the comically mismatched pair of the older man and younger woman.6 Each of the fringe figures wields a toothy grin, an open-mouthed howl, or a sly smirk to indicate their amusement. Animated subjects populated early seventeenth-century Dutch genre painting, especially in Haarlem. Vrolijke gezelschappen, or merry companies, dominated non-narrative figurative art\n\n28\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nFig. 7.

The immigration of David Vinckboons (1576-1638) from Flanders to Amsterdam introduced this new type of painting from the Southern Netherlands to the Dutch Republic.7 Scenes such as Banquet with Dancers from about 1614 in the Rijksmuseum (fig. 11) represent a specific moment during a festive occasion. To the left, Vinckboons pictured an elegant young couple dancing. The man leans back as he extends his left leg forward above the ground. Similarly, the L-bend of the skirt of the woman’s dress indicates that she is in the process of moving forward towards her companion. At the lower right, another young man reclines against the lap of a woman, gestures outward with his arm, and opens his mouth, perhaps indicating that he is singing along to the tune strung by the lute players at the center of the composition. An even more explicit indicator of the temporality of the scene is the young page who dramatically pours a beverage from the pitcher held high above the glass in his left hand. In Haarlem, Willem Buytewech (ca. 1591-1624) began to produce numerous merry companies almost immediately after entering the guild in 1612. In paintings such as Merry Company from about 1616-17 (fig. 12), Buytewech created the effect of capturing a transitory moment through the inclusion of details like the glowing embers of the pipe and gentle trail of smoke seeping from the mouth of the slouched figure in black. Merry company painters active in the 1620s and 1630s, including Hals’s brother Dirck, continued the practice initiated by Vinckboons and Buytewech by staging their own scenes of youthful frivolity as occurring at a particular time.8 In his single-figure genre paintings, Hals combined the temporal conventions cemented\n\n29\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nFig. 8.

Shortly after Dirck van Baburen (1594/5-1624), Gerrit van Honthorst (1592-1646), and Hendrick ter Brugghen (1588-1629) returned from Italy in the mid-1620s, Hals, like many painters throughout Holland, began producing images of solitary figures in a Caravaggesque mode. Many of Hals’s figures appropriate specific types and gestures. As did their compatriots in Haarlem, the Utrecht painters often pictured temporal specificity. Honthorst’s Merry Fiddler (fig. 13) flashes a broad, open-mouthed smile as he extends his arm upwards as if in a toast. The smile reverberates across his face as his dimples punctuate his cheeks, his drawn-back lips push those ruddy cheeks upward, his eyes squint, and his brow furrows in merriment. Even the slight head tilt and upraised fiddle communicate a sense of a particular moment. The moment must be short-lived, as one cannot maintain such a pose indefinitely, and certainly not with such gaiety. The outward thrust of the right arm, accentuated by its projection from the casement window, and the straightforward gaze create the effect that the figure is engaging the viewer directly. In turn, the fiddler occupies the viewer’s space and exists in the same time as the viewer. Though not as effusive and in a more restrained color palette, it is easy to see how Hals appropriated much of Honthorst’s schema in his so-called Jolly Toper (fig. 36). The paired lozenge panels now in a New York private collection exemplify Hals’s conception (figs. 14 and 15). Here, a girl sings and a boy plays a violin. Hals choreographed every element\n\nFig. 13.

The bow touches the strings of the violin while the boy’s mouth opens. He looks upward as if he may be projecting his voice to accompany the sounds of his instrument. The girl stares intently at the music book with lips slightly parted. Her right hand is just above the book, in a casual, perhaps involuntary, gesture. The upper-most page at right flitters above the others, failing to lie flat. Strands of her hair spill out in almost every direction. Though static images, both figures are presented as if the artist has captured a single instant in the singing of their songs. Musical subjects are particularly apt for conveying the momentary, as music is perhaps the most transitory of art forms. Hals drew upon local practice to imbue his group portraits with an innovative animated temporality similar to that found in his genre paintings. Hals’s first group portrait, Banquet of the St. George Civic Guard from 1616 (fig. 16), bustles with activity. At least three different conversations seem to be taking place around the table. Two figures gingerly hold their beverages as if having just taken a sip. In the center of the composition, the man on the far side daintily grasps the roast just before slicing himself a portion. To the right, an officer has doffed his hat while the standard bearer gazes out towards the viewer. The movement of glances in multiple directions across the painting’s surface accentuates the sense of vitality by decentralizing the viewer’s focus. Although the bustle was carefully choreographed, the resulting image initially strikes the modern viewer as being as unstaged as a photographic snapshot. Despite the seeming naturalism that stems from the heightened activity and sense of the momentary, Hals’s group portraits are heavily steeped in pictorial precedent in Haarlem. In his seminal study of Dutch group portraiture, Alois Riegl noted that Hals borrowed the composition of Banquet of the St. George Civic Guard of 1583 (fig. 17) by Cornelis van Haarlem\n\nFig. 16.

To unite a small number of figures, Cornelis turned his subjects toward each other and provided them with gestures that established relationships and interactions. Ensuing portraitists in Haarlem followed Cornelis’s innovations as they forged some degree of interior engagement between figures, even if nearly every officer faces the viewer frontally.11 In the process, it became convention not only to group figures though gestures, but also to picture civic guard banquets as active scenes. As Riegl noted, however, Hals revised local pictorial tradition by centering subgroups around a specific activity, such as carving meat or serving drinks. What has not been fully appreciated is that by providing an active focus for his figural subgroups, Hals introduced a sense of transitoriness that increased the naturalism of his group portraits. Riegl attributed much of Hals’s innovations to his engagement with genre painting. Indeed, Hals’s group portraits share numerous similarities with merry companies like those painted by his brother Dirck. In his group portraits, Hals presents viewers with the impression not only of the representation of a feast, but also of a single instant during the event.12 Hals heightened the level of animation by activating his sitters’ expressions. Cornelis and others animated the bodies of the officers they portrayed through unfocused gesture, but the faces of their figures remained wooden. Their cheeks are still as their eyes peer out evenly\n\nFig. 17. Cornelis van Haarlem, Banquet of the St. George Civic Guard, 1583. Oil on panel, 135 x 233 cm.

Similarly, their mouths have been drawn straight across so that they lack the perceptible pulse of Hals’s imagery. Not only did Hals vary mouth positions, but he also pictured the push and pull of flesh across the underlying cheekbone as a result of the movements of facial muscles. The ruddy pinks that flush the cheeks with color further breathe life into the subjects. Similarly, Hals articulated his figures’ interactions through expressive eyes and eyebrows. In total, these details complement the figures’ animated gestures and create a coherent sensation of catching the officers in a transitory moment. This effect is all the more remarkable as Hals and his contemporaries had never seen true stop-action imagery like snapshots produced by photographic cameras. Harry Berger recently has coined this type of stop-action portrayal “posing as if not posing.”13 Berger derived his terminology from his claim that portraits are not so much images of individuals in reality as they are images of sitters posing. In other words, portrayal is a performative act. Sitters play roles or take on stage-constructed identities. The artist then registers that performance and that pose in the portrait. As such, a portrait presents an event – the act of posing – that happened at some exact point in the past. Though Berger does not make the case, this mode of “posing as if not posing” and the representation of a sitter as occurring at a particular moment were revolutionary in Holland in the early seventeenth century. Ann Adams, for example, has explored how static, sober portrayals like those produced by Thomas de Keyser (1596/71667) which convey the stoic ideal of tranquility were imminently popular well into the 1630s.14 Focusing on Rembrandt, Berger de-emphasized Hals’s crucial role in fueling, if not introducing, such a new pictorial mode into the Dutch Republic. Berger also does not contextualize the underlying assumptions of in-the-moment portrayals in their historical and cultural particularities. Berger’s “posing as if not posing” or the snapshot effect seen in Hals’s work may be rooted, in part, in new theories of vision and time. Svetlana Alpers has suggested that seventeenthcentury pictorial modes that emphasize illusory and ephemeral effects mirror Johannes Kepler’s (1571-1630) novel understanding of vision.15 Kepler posited that seeing creates and imprints an image on the retina and that the process of seeing is really that of interpreting a sequence of still images. Kepler’s formulation of vision has much in common with the growing recognition of time and temporality in the Dutch scientific community. The influential Leiden professor Franco Burgersdijk (1590-1635), for example, postulated time as successive, proceeding from one movement and one moment to the next.16 Analogous to Kepler’s conception of retinal imagery, Burgersdijk theorized a moment as a single, static point or, to invoke a twenty-first century analogy, a frozen frame. Susan Kuretsky has recently argued that the seventeenth-century Dutch populace was well-versed, if not enthralled, by issues of time and duration such as those formulated by Burgersdijk and, later, Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), René Descartes (1596-1650), and Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677).17 Indeed, while no evidence indicates that Hals studied science, Kepler’s and Burgersdijk’s formulations that were circulating at the beginning of the seventeenth century do seem akin to the strategy of active representation that Hals first staged in his genre pictures and group portraits. The lively, in-the-moment qualities of Hals’s group portraits and genre paintings eventu-\n\n38\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nally informed similar mechanisms in his individual portraits. Although Hals continued to produce relatively stiff portraits through the mid-1620s, such as that of Jacob Pietersz. Olycan (fig. 77), he began to picture greater vitality and momentary temporality in pictures like his seemingly transitory portrait of Isaac Massa dated 1626 (fig. 18). Seated, Massa hangs his right elbow off the chair back while holding his forearm out and across his chest. A branch of holly dangles from his two-finger grip. He turns his head to the right, nearly in line with his right shoulder. His pose replicates that of Nicolaes van der Meer in Hals’s portrayal of the St. George company officers from ten years earlier (fig. 16). In the middle, Van der Meer twists his head to the right so that his face engages the viewer although the rest of his body is perpendicular to the picture plane. While Massa actually holds the same pose as Van der Meer, Hals rotated Massa one quarter\n\nFig. 18. Frans Hals, Isaac Massa, 1626. Oil on canvas, 79.5 x 65 cm. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto.

Rather than focusing outwards to the viewer, Massa’s pupils sit in the right corners of his eyes as if they are following something occurring to his right. The overall composition creates the impression that Massa has not been placed in this pose by the artist, but that he has turned to address someone standing outside the boundary of the picture. Even his mouth appears open as if in mid-speech. Though not showing any teeth, Hals divided Massa’s lips with a thick dark line suggesting an open mouth. Isaac Massa also owes much to Hals’s genre images of young musicians. Though far more boisterous, the Merry Lute Player from about 1625 (fig. 19) strikes a remarkably similar pose. Like Massa, the youth’s shoulders recede back to the left while his head turns to the right as his eyes dart up and out to the right. The two figures share an elusive gaze in which their pupils sit in\n\nFig. 19. Frans Hals, Merry Lute Player, c. 1625. Oil on panel, 90 x 75 cm. Harold Samuel Collection, Mansion House.

Although it is difficult to determine whether the genre painting preceded the portrait, the sideways glance and the ensuing sense of the momentary indicate an early convergence of genre and portrait conceptions in Hals’s works.18 Paintings like the Merry Lute Player owe much to the work of Ter Brugghen, Baburen, and Honthorst that introduced Caravaggesque fashions current in seventeenth-century Italian religious and genre painting to the northern Netherlands.19 To put it differently, Hals’s genre pictures relate to contemporary Italian modes. Hals’s animated aesthetic also shares certain affinities with portraits produced in Rome in the early seventeenth century. As has been long noted, Bernini’s desire to study his subjects in an animated state, if not conversation, appears in his 1632 sketch of Cardinal Scipione Borghese (fig. 20).20 Summarily drafted in profile, Bernini portrayed Borghese with parted lips and open mouth that may suggest that he is speaking.21 While adding other signs of the active moment such as rumpled fabric and precariously closed buttons, Bernini repeated the open-mouth expression in his marble bust of Borghese of the same year. In the parted lips, diverted gaze, and aura of casualness, Bernini’s portraits bear a striking similarity to paintings like Hals’s Isaac Massa (fig. 18), despite the differences in media.22 While Bernini’s efforts postdate Hals’s, in many ways they continue a longer Italian tradition. As Andrea Bacchi and Catherine Hess have recently posited, Bernini’s informal busts closely follow the model of Ottavio Leoni (1578-1630).23 Active in Rome at the very beginning of\n\nFig. 20. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Portrait of Cardinal Borghese. The Morgan Library & Museum.\n\n41\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nthe seventeenth century, Leoni specialized in portraiture of the local aristocracy and ecclesiastical elite. Best known today are Leoni’s drawn portraits that were collected by Scipione Borghese, his great patron. In his portrayal of the painter Tommaso Salini (ca. 1575-1625), Leoni depicted his subject’s face in profile but his torso frontally, as if Salini had turned dramatically to his right (fig. 21). Salini’s relaxed face seems not yet to have registered who or what has diverted his attention. The soft lines and subtle coloring of the cheek combine with these other features to lend an air of immediacy to the representation despite, or precisely because of, the sketchy rendering of other features. Ann Sutherland Harris has posited Simon Vouet (1590-1649) as another source for Bernini and another proponent of active portrayal in the first decades of the seventeenth century.24 Vouet painted several seemingly immediate portraits when he was in Rome from 1614 to 1627. Vouet’s self-portrait from about 1615 stands as a representative example of the artist at his liveliest (fig. 22). Here, Vouet turns to face the viewer. His lips part almost breathlessly, wide enough to see the teeth beyond. His hair appears tousled as it falls irregularly across his head and shoulders. The sense of immediacy that results from these features does seem to anticipate Bernini’s portraits of Scipione Borghese, even if Leoni’s work also must have been formative. The\n\nFig. 21.

In conception, tone, color, and even execution, Vouet’s self-portrait also resembles paintings by Hals like Youth with a Flute (fig. 88).25 The formal relationships between the portraits of Bernini, Leoni, and Vouet, and those of Hals are leading, but it remains unclear how or if Hals came to know any of these artists’ works. As far as we know, Hals never traveled any further south than Antwerp. Rembrandt famously proclaimed that he had no need to travel to Italy because there was plenty of Italian art in the northern Netherlands. Despite this assertion, the record of what was available locally to Dutch artists is incomplete. Leoni’s work is the most likely to have been found in the north, as he worked in the highly transportable media of drawings and prints. Leoni crafted prints after many of his portraits, including that of Salini. Alternatively, Baburen, Ter Brugghen, and Honthorst may have introduced more than just the art of Caravaggio to the northern Netherlands. Though none of the three artists are known to have executed portraits in the manner then in vogue in Rome, they surely must have been familiar with the full range of contemporary Roman painting, including immediate portrayals.26 Despite the formal correspondences, the lack of evidence makes it impossible to claim that Hals followed Roman prototypes directly. More cautiously,\n\nFig. 22. Simon Vouet, Self-Portrait, c. 1615. Oil on canvas, 64 x 48 cm. Musée Réattu, Arles.\n\n43\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nFig. 23. Frans Hals, Paulus van Beresteyn, 162[0]. Oil on canvas, 137.1 x 104 cm. Musée du Louvre, Paris.\n\nit is worth considering whether awareness of the lively, temporally specific methods of artists like Vouet and Leoni, as well as new formulations of vision and time, helped encourage Hals to transfer the mode he had already developed and practiced in his genre painting to portraiture. A heightened liveliness pervades even Hals’s more conventionally posed portraits from the late 1620s and after.27 A comparison of Paulus van Beresteyn (fig. 23) from about 1620 in the Louvre and Portrait of a Man dated 1630 (fig. 24) shows how much livelier the portraits from the end of the decade are. The paintings share a nearly identical three-quarter length composition wherein a figure rotates his shoulders back and to the left while turning his head to the right. The vitality of the later portrait, however, far exceeds that of the earlier painting in the Louvre. Though not entirely without liveliness, Van Beresteyn stares out with an even gaze and masked expression. His unblemished, porcelain-like skin rests rigidly still. In contrast, beneath a slightly\n\n44\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nFig. 24. Frans Hals, Portrait of a Man, 1630. Oil on canvas, 115 x 89.5 cm.

In a related movement, the lids squeeze together ever so slightly. These features, combined with the aqueous treatment of the eyes, create the impression that the sitter is locking his gaze on the viewer. Hals built the cheeks and lips from ruddy pinks that show through lighter surface layers to imbue the flesh with vitality and plasticity. The close-cropped hair falls imperfectly around the face. At the upper left, for example, seven short wisps reach down rather than across. The sitter’s pose enhances the naturalism of the face. Standing with a certain air of nonchalance, he casually grasps his doffed hat in his left hand. His right hand dangles his gloves. The image reminds one of Schrevelius’s estimation that Hals’s portraits breathe with life. Similarly, Hals’s portrait of the\n\nFig. 25. Frans Hals, Pieter Jacobsz. Olycan, c. 1639.

Olycan appears to be scrutinizing the artist or the viewer with narrowed eyes and a cocked right eyebrow. His forehead is a tapestry of furrows as a result of his serious expression and, characteristically, his lips are separated and his lower lip juts forward. As a result, the figure seems to have existed not only in space but also in time, as if the portrait records Olycan’s visage as it appeared during a single instant. Mariët Westermann has argued that Hals’s liveliness and temporality, like that of Jan Steen (1626-1679), appealed to patrons and consumers because these features enabled the artists to render their sitters more naturally and distinctly.28 Westermann focused on Hals’s genre-like portraits such as the Laughing Cavalier, but her argument holds for his more conventional portraits as well. In contrast to conceptions of the self as unflinchingly stable in preceding centuries, she cited several sources that indicate an emerging understanding of it as being in constant flux.29 For example, Johan de Brune the Younger wrote, after Montaigne, that “we are never properly what we were, or will be; each step changes us into a very different nature.”30 Westermann linked De Brune’s sentiments to Aristotelian rhetoric where successful arguments were believed to be made with ener’gia (visual vigor) and en’argia (distinctness).31 In this schema, the most natural – and therefore best – portraits could be believed to be those that captured the distinctness of the sitter’s identity and character through a lively and energized representation.32 The rhetoric of liveliness in seventeenth-century Holland could have informed the appreciation of the paintings by Hals and Steen even if, as Westermann rightly suggests, artists did not consider their works in these terms. Numerous sources indicate, in less rhetorical language, that there was a longstanding awareness among early modern artists of the interrelationships between movement, vitality, and distinctness.33 The Florentine sculptor and architect Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) was perhaps the first to articulate such thinking when he wrote: “The body is said to live when it has certain voluntary movements…Therefore the painter wishing to express life in things, will make every part in motion.”34 Hals’s teacher Karel van Mander, who was steeped in Italian art theory, advocated a similar practice of conveying identity and character through a figure’s movement. In his didactic poem Den Grondt der edel vry schilderconst, Van Mander suggested how to differentiate figural types through represented movement and bearing: Especially men of strong constitution should move and stand powerfully. But youths, who know no hardships, must be more lively, with relaxed limbs, entirely free and loose. Now the position of old men: they should hold onto something with their hands in order to support their weak, failing bodies on their tired legs which are inclined to bow. In sum, by the strength and nature of the character should then all figures be recognized, and also by their activity, as should be well understood: because a swordsman will conduct himself differently, more wildly, in pose and movement than a philosopher, by whose gestures it will be seen that he is answering difficult questions of judgment; all this one must distinguish to the best of one’s ability.35\n\n47\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nFig. 26.

Oil on canvas, 75 x 64 cm. bpk Berlin / Gemäldegalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Jörg P. Anders.\n\nFor Van Mander, as for all Renaissance art theorists versed in the rhetoric of decorum, diverse types of individuals carried themselves differently. Age, profession, and even character could be read from one’s movement. Van Mander related pictorial individuality to a figure’s distinctive activity. Though Alberti and Van Mander both addressed figural representation generally, others, like Bernini, spoke similarly about portraiture. Bernini proclaimed, “If a man stands still and immobile, he is never as much like himself as when he moves about. His movement reveals all those personal qualities that are his and his alone.”36 Similar conceptions can be found in Dutch in the treatises of the Latin scholar Franciscus Junius and the painter-writer Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-1678). Both authors supported portraitists who rendered “the movements of the soul” because doing so imbued their painted figures\n\n49\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nwith a sense of liveliness.37 Junius’s and Van Hoogstraten’s positions recall those of Pliny when he wrote that Polygnotus of Thasos “first contributed many improvements to the art of painting, as he introduced showing the mouth wide open and displaying the teeth and giving expression to the countenance in place of primitive rigidity.”38 As Ann Adams has noted, psychological movement, like physical activity, cannot be maintained constantly, so that it also implies a degree of temporality.39 In this way, all of these artists and writers communicated a perceived relationship between activity, liveliness, and portraying a sitter as distinct. Furthermore, each seems to have concurred that the distinctness of the individual – the fundamental concern of portraiture – can be relayed best in a representation of the figure at one particular moment.40 In light of these wide-ranging sources, including his own teacher, it seems highly likely that Hals would have been aware of this perception of the distinctive moment even if his visualization of the concept was highly innovative.\n\nA Lively Method Though Schrevelius noted that Hals’s vitality was rooted in his manner of painting, the relation between Hals’s method of execution and his sense of the momentary has never been accurately treated. Following nineteenth-century estimations that Hals worked swiftly from his models to craft proto-impressionistic works, his technique was long considered to be an immediate one. Scientific examination of Hals’s paintings resolutely rejects this view, as it has shown that Hals worked in stages over some time. In the wake of these studies, there has been no attempt to reconcile the duration of his process and the impression of transitoriness and spontaneity put forth in his finished paintings. This section explores not only how Hals created his paintings, but also how he consciously cultivated a method that accentuated the illusion of a distinctive moment that was fundamental to his approach to portraiture. A significant number of Hals’s paintings have been subject to scientific examinations in recent years. In the 1980s, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks analyzed the group portraits by Hals in the Frans Hals Museum in preparation for their restoration of these pictures. Groen and Hendriks also studied twenty-five paintings by Hals prior to Slive’s monumental monographic exhibition shown in Washington, London, and Haarlem from 1989 to 1990. Groen and Hendriks published their results in the catalogue that accompanied the exhibition. In the same volume, Martin Bijl presented what he had learned from his restoration of the so-called Meagre Company painted by Hals and Amsterdam artist Pieter Codde (1599-1678). During the run of the exhibition in Haarlem, conservators at the Frans Hals Museum conducted a more systematic study of fifty-nine of the eighty-six paintings on display.41 Hendriks and Koos Levy-van Halm recorded the results of the examinations conducted prior to and during the exhibition in an unpublished report which synthesizes technical studies of eighty-five of the 220 paintings that Slive attributed to Hals.42 More recently, the five paintings by Hals in the Mauritshuis were studied as part of the museum’s cataloguing of portraits in the Dutch royal collection.43 From these significant examinations of a sizable percentage of Hals’s known oeuvre, it is possible to make several general observations about Hals’s materials and procedure.\n\n50\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nFig. 28. Frans Hals, cross-section Claes Duyst van Voorhout, c. 1638. Oil on canvas, 80.7 x 66 cm. bpk, Berlin / The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nNeither the supports nor the materials that Hals applied to them differ much from those of his contemporaries. As did many painters in the period, Hals gradually transitioned from panel to canvas. Of the works Slive published as autograph paintings, fifty-seven are on panel while 157 are on canvas. In fact, most of Hals’s works that can be dated after 1620 are on canvas. After being introduced in the sixteenth century, cloth supports quickly eclipsed wood as the medium of choice throughout Europe, as they were less expensive, easier to transport, and simpler to prepare. Some of these advantages were negated in small-scale works that were already quite portable and relatively cost efficient, so it is not surprising to find that Hals did execute some small works on wood planks during the later portion of his career.44 As for his works on canvas, one finds a variety of canvas grades in Hals’s paintings, although the width and coarseness of the fabrics are typical of those used in Haarlem in the seventeenth century.45 As Hals employed different grades in works close in date, he probably selected his canvas from a stash of bolts on hand.46 It is also quite possible that Hals was aware of the effects of various weaves on the final appearance of the painting and made his selections accordingly.47 Hals most frequently primed his supports with lead white as was common practice, but he also used the slightly archaic chalk glue grounds for several works.48 As for the paint, Hals tended to employ a limited palette in individual works, although he varied his tonal schemes from painting to painting. In the 1620s and early 1630s, for example, browns and yellows dominate while in the 1640s and 1650s the gray spectrum is more prevalent. Hals never used rare and expensive colors like lapis lazuli or gold\n\n51\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\nleaf.49 Like his supports, his pigments and binding mediums were all readily available and typical for the period.50 What distinguishes Hals’s works is not what they were made from, but how he employed his materials. Contrary to longstanding assumptions, technical examinations have unequivocally proven that Hals did not craft his paintings entirely alla prima.51 In works such as Malle Babbe (figs. 26 and 27), one can see from the seemingly smeared passages of flesh tones like those at her jaw line and those cascading down her nose that Hals worked the uppermost surface of his canvas wet-in-wet. From such examples, it has been believed that he crafted the entirety of his paintings in a single sitting in a flurry of inspiration.52 Paint samples reveal, however, that even the most dashingly painted works were executed in a series of layers. For example, samples from the\n\nFig. 29. Frans Hals, Jolly Toper (detail), c. 1628-1630. Oil on canvas, 81 x 66.5 cm. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\n\n52\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\nfluid coat of Claes Duyst van Voorhout (fig. 28) show clearly defined layers that could only result from applying paint atop an already dried stratum of paint. If Hals had not let the underlying layers dry, the samples would have shown the colors to be less rigidly differentiated. Likewise, one can see Hals’s use of dried layers in the right sleeve of the Jolly Toper (fig. 29). Here, trickles of paint solvent have washed away the yellowish surface to reveal a darker, umber layer beneath. Although Hals, like most other artists in the seventeenth century, employed far fewer layers than did painters in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, he could not have quickly dashed off an individual work, since oil-based paints can take several days to dry depending on the properties of the mixture. Instead, each of his paintings resulted from a multi-staged process. Hals began each work by applying a uniform coat of paint across a primed support. This ground layer served as the tonal foundation for the entire work. Generally light, Hals’s grounds range from white to yellowish ochre to light grays to reddish browns. Applying other colors over this type of base created more complex shades and tones than would a solid white ground. As Van Gogh noted with unbridled admiration, “Frans Hals had no less than twenty-seven blacks.”53 Rather than mixing his paints differently to achieve this effect, Hals applied thin layers of lamp black over the ground and various undertones, so that he indeed could create the appearance of multiple blacks.54 For example, a cross section of a paint sample taken from Man in a Slouch Hat in Kassel (fig. 30) shows that Hals applied deep lamp black over a double ground of ruddy red and cool gray to craft the depth of color in the figure’s garment. While undertones built from the\n\nFig. 30. Frans Hals, cross-section Man in a Slouch Hat, c. 1660-6. Oil on canvas, 7.5 x 66.5 cm.

This was especially true for paintings made with Hals’s open technique of the late 1620s and 1630s. Like several painters in Haarlem, Hals did not entirely cover the ground with paint but instead left portions exposed, applying lighter and darker shades of the same color only in passages.55 In Youth with a Flute (fig. 88), Hals used a bluish, gray ground that he barely washed over with light browns in the background. While informing all parts of the picture, the ground also peeks through thinly brushed passages at the white cuff of the youth’s sleeve and at his hairline. Through this exposure and by applying this same shade atop the white at the inside corner of the flutist’s left eye, Hals was able to unify the tonalities of the picture. The variety of colors used for the grounds, even for works close in date, indicates sensitivity to the impact of this initial stage on the final appearance of his works.56 Atop the ground, Hals sketched a rudimentary design with heavy, dark strokes of paint.57 Evidence of this underdrawing occasionally can be seen through the surface layers as in the Family Portrait in Cincinnati (fig. 31), where the marks at the husband’s and wife’s chins and at the transitions from their collars to garments show the painter’s initial designs for the composition. Unlike the detailed underdrawings common in earlier Northern art, this sketch consisted of a basic silhouette of shapes that provided only a cursory guide for working up the surface of the painting.58 From this schematic guide, Hals blocked in tonal values with wide passages of unmodulated color, or “dead-coloring.” For the faces of his subjects, for example, Hals employed gray, pink, and reddish underpaint below pinkish tones to craft a variety of complexions. In the Cincinnati group, the warmer brownish red of the man’s face and the cooler gray of the woman’s visage are the result of the use of different modeling tones. Next, Hals began to model his forms with local touches of color to define the underlying structures of the face, hands, and costumes.59 At the lower left of the woman’s dress, near the man’s right foot, one can see how Hals applied swatches of dark black atop a thinner, gray-black midtone to mark the structure of the crinkled folds. He then covered the modulated underpaint with another layer or two of paint that set the ultimate features of an image. In Family Portrait, Hals used the unblended strokes of dark black that signal the recesses of the garment and the sweeps of whites and grays to indicate the crests of its folds. As such, he built his paintings from patches of tones in different values rather than from line drawing. In two to three layers, he was able to modulate his basic shapes and forms to create depth and volume from color rather than from line. Though working in layers, Hals did not build up the surfaces of his paintings uniformly, but rather worked from back to front.60 He progressed from those elements that were to appear furthest from the viewer forward. For instance, he generally completed the body of a garment before the collared ruff worn over it. Similarly, highlights that are by definition those areas closest to a light source are actually placed atop all other layers of paint. In this way, Hals’s paintings do project from the support out into the viewer’s space, even if slightly. Thus, Hals not only crafted an illusion of depth and volume, he also enhanced the three-dimensional presence of the image.

While the technical analyses of Hals’s paintings fail to provide an answer, Hals’s commission for The Meagre Company (fig. 32) offers some insight. In 1633, the St. George Civic Guard of Amsterdam under Captain Reynier Real and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz. Blaeuw commissioned Hals to paint a group portrait of the militia’s officers. A series of notarized letters written between March 19, 1636 and July 16, 1636 document a dispute between the officers and Hals over the completion of the picture.61 By March 1636, Hals had finished only a portion of the painting, leaving the remainder incomplete. According to Bijl, Hals sketched the initial composition for the entire work and began working left to right, building up and finishing only a few of the individual figures.62 In response to demands by Real and Blaeuw, Hals corresponded that despite several expensive trips to Amsterdam, he had been unable to progress further due to difficulties in assembling the militia group for sittings. Hals claimed that he had agreed to sketch the officers’ heads in Amsterdam and would then finish the painting in Haarlem. As he had been unsuccessful in gathering the men in Amsterdam, Hals suggested that the officers travel to Haarlem to sit for him. Real and Blaeuw steadfastly refused, stating that the original agreement called for Hals to paint all of the heads in Amsterdam, presumably in their entirety, and render the details and unify the painting in Haarlem. Furthermore, they demanded that Hals travel to Amsterdam immediately to fulfill his part of the contract. In turn, Hals offered to reverse his working process. Instead of beginning with the heads, he offered to complete the figures’ garments and then paint the faces – once the officers agreed to come to Haarlem. As the officers eventually turned to Codde to finalize the portraits, Hals and the militia group obviously could not reach an agreement and parted ways. While these documents give only a cursory picture of Hals’s interactions with his sitters, it is clear that Hals required the sitters’ presence, or at least their faces, for multiple stages. Not only did he need the\n\n56\n\nthe signature style of frans hals\n\na liveliness uniquely his\n\ngroup fully assembled to sketch the composition, but he also needed to work from individual models in both the working-up and finishing stages of his extended process. Several sources affirm that seventeenth-century Northern artists required multiple extended sittings with their models in individual portraits as well. In his manuscript memoir from 1629-31, Constantijn Huygens described posing for a portrait by Jan Lievens (1607-74) in The Hague.63 According to Huygens: “It being winter and the days drawing in, and my own affairs leaving me little time to pose, he was content to paint my clothes and my bare hands (a task of which he acquitted himself most tastefully) and to postpone the portrayal of my face until the advent of spring.”64 Even though all but the face could be crafted without Huygens’s presence, this account suggests that Lievens not only needed multiple sittings, he also required that they last for a duration longer than the winter hours could afford. In about 1646, the English painter and calligrapher Edward Norgate (1580s-1650) provided extensive instructions to aspiring portraitists in Miniatura; or the Art of Limning. Making no distinction between the painting of the face and the body, he advocated a schedule of three sittings with the model.65 In the first stage, which could take two to four hours, the artist was to draft an outline of the composition and lay in preliminary shadows. In the second, the painter would need three to four hours to "
