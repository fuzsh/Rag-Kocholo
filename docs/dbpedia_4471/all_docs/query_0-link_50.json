Despite the disembodying facilities of electronic mail, I think of the friends and colleagues who have contributed so much as located in speciﬁc places. The project was devised at the University of Melbourne, where Margaret Manion, Margaret Riddle, Chris McAuli¤e, and the late John Pigot gave initial encouragement and advice. It became a reality thanks to the award of a J. Paul Getty Postdoctoral Fellowship, which took me to Baltimore, New York, and Paris. My work at Johns Hopkins was facilitated by Charles Dempsey, while Maria Gough, Judith Butler and Yve-Alain Bois were valued interlocutors. A visit to the University of Texas at Austin gave me the beneﬁt of Richard Shi¤’s guidance and support. In New York the discovery at the Frick Art Reference Library of the catalogues of the Society of French Orientalist Painters shaped my research in unforeseeable ways. My colleagues Christopher Robinson, the regretté Robert Boardingham, Fred Bohrer, John Klein, and Elizabeth Childs were the source of excellent research clues. Two summer months in London provided some serendipitous acquaintances, including Perry and Benedict Anderson, Gill Perry, Kathy Adler, and John House. In France the Getty funds supported work at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and the Musée National des Arts d’Afrique et d’Océanie, and an all too brief journey to Tangier, Fez, and Meknès. Robert Simon, Laurie Monahan, Barbara Comte, and Hélène Hourmat were most helpful, as were\n\nix\n\nMichael Enright and François Frey in Aix-en-Provence, where the Centre des Archives d’OutreMer are a Mecca for research on the French colonies. My major debt in Paris is to Lynne Thornton, the doyenne of Orientalist studies. Her books and sale catalogues have been largely responsible for recovering the enormous corpus of Orientalist art. Lynne has been remarkably generous in answering queries and providing materials. I also want to acknowledge the precious contribution of my research assistants, particularly Peter Rudd for his two long stints in Paris and, more recently, Lara Smith and Natalie Adamson. Their work, as well as much of the material of scholarship, was funded by generous grants from the Australian Research Council. I have grateful memories of my hosts at the Musée National des Beaux-Arts in Algiers, who were extraordinarily kind to a stranger at a time when it was becoming difﬁcult for foreigners to travel there: Malika Bouabdellah, then director of the museum; my hosts Samia and Djafaar Boulharouf; and my guide in the city, Nouredine Ferroukhi. They have often been in my thoughts during the turmoil of their country. Two major exhibitions gave a scholarly ﬁllip to my research. I thank Caroline Turner and Doug Hall of the Queensland Art Gallery for the exhibition Matisse, which gave me the opportunity to revisit his Moroccan phase. Edmund Capon’s commission to curate Orientalism: Delacroix to Klee facilitated my work in all kinds of unexpected ways. His colleagues at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in particular Anne Flanagan and Ursula Prunster, were most helpful, as were Brahim Alaoui, Mounira Khemir, Caroline Mathieu, Geneviève Lacambre, Dominique Tafﬁn, and Jean-François Heim in Paris. I have fond memories of working with Brian McDermott of the Mathaf Gallery, of Tayeb Zahzah and Maître Si-Ali Tiar. The specialist booksellers of Paris, particularly Michèle Dhennequin, must be thanked. François Pouillon’s brilliant scholarship in Orientalist art has been matched by his generous friendship. Along the way I have been the fortunate recipient of advice from Peter Kohane, David Brand, Timothy J. Clark, Aimée Brown Price, Phillip Goad, Terry Smith, Thomas Crow, Karen Esielonis, Paul Duro, Emily Apter, Richard Pennell, Zeynep Çelik, and Peter Hulme. The students in my seminar on Orientalist visual culture at Melbourne University challenged my intellectual stasis, while former students Mary Roberts, Caroline Jordan, Lara Smith, and Luke Gartlan have been most enriching interlocutors. The librarians of Ormond and Trinity Colleges in Melbourne graciously provided me with places to write. The book was ﬁnalized at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research at the Australian National University, Canberra. I am profoundly grateful to its foundation director, Nicholas Thomas, for providing the luxury of a research fellowship in this uniquely stimulating environment. Thanks also to the ever-supportive Iain McCalman, Howard Morphy, and Caroline Turner, and those able administrators Anne-Maree O’Brien and Julie Gorrell. Anne McGrath, Hollis Clayson, David MacDougall, Lynne Thornton, and François Pouillon read chapter drafts at this time, while CCR col-\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nleagues, including Christopher Pinney, Klaus Neumann, Greg Dening, and above all Nicholas Thomas o¤ered fruitful conversations. Chaitanya Sambrani and Natalie Adamson helped order illustrations, while Neal McCracken and Stuart Hay proved to be the nec plus ultra of black-and-white photography. At the University of California Press, I want to o¤er my commissioning editor, Deborah Kirshman, and her assistants Kim Darwin and Jennie Sutton my thanks for their faith in this project and the gift of their patience. The Press’s three external readers offered extremely productive suggestions and advice. My editor, Stephanie Fay, improved my expression in a way I no longer believed was possible and, with Fronia Simpson, brought the manuscript to a new level of consistency and rigor. Finally to Kate Sands, my wife, I owe an inestimable debt—for her calming encouragement and advice, for her skillful reading of drafts, and her sustaining ways over months and years. Our children, Sophia and Stuart, were born and have grown alongside this book; they have shown me that satisfaction in a task completed is a primal pleasure that should never be deferred too long. Author’s note: In the interests of accessibility, I have translated all French texts (unless another translator is acknowledged). I have used English versions of names for museums and organizations except where convention demands it (e.g. Ecole des Beaux-Arts). Titles of paintings are given in both English and French, books and articles in French only. For the orthography of Arabic names I have used the French rather than the English model.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nIllustrations\n\nAbbreviations ADAGP Société des Auteurs Dans les Arts Graphiques et Plastiques, Paris ANU Australian National University, Canberra RMN Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Paris\n\nMap of North Africa circa 1900 (opposite page 1)\n\nPlates (following page 104) 1.

It is bright, airy, and well-appointed, high up in the crumbling art deco building made to celebrate one hundred years of the French occupation of Algeria. The collection is not strange: this is a serious scholarly library on European (and to a lesser extent, Islamic) art, formed between 1930 and 1962, the year when over one million French abandoned the North African colony. The library as I found it in early 1993, however, was all but deserted. The young librarian graciously allowed me to photocopy, but because of a lack of toner the machine made almost illegible prints. The breezy silence was sometimes broken by the chanting of young Islamist cadres, demonstrating on the former Champ de Manoeuvres (French military parade grounds) nearby. Like the museum and its collections, the library had changed function, all but lost its brief. A colonial cultural institution, it nowadays speaks to but a fraction of the people. Yet what treasures it contains for the seeker after Orientalist and French art! The Algerian sta¤ were rightly proud of the nineteenth-century pictures, by major French artists from Gustave Courbet to Edouard Vuillard. They were doubly proud of the national heritage represented by the rooms devoted to the miniaturist Mohammed Racim and more recent works by Algerian abstract painters. Yet the then director and her sta¤ knew little of their museum’s history. The French, I was told, had repatriated both the old records and the paintings. Although most of the pictures were later re-\n\n1\n\nturned to Algiers, the papers remained in France. I had seen them in the colonial archives at Aix-enProvence. The founding of the Algiers museum is the subject of the ﬁnal chapter of this book. One sees the circuitous byways of knowledge by which a foreigner—in my case, an Australian trained in America and traveling via Paris—with no claims other than intellectual curiosity and moral sympathy, can construct a history of someone else ’s heritage. They are byways where ﬁrst world privilege opens borders, as when I cruised through the customs barrier at Nice airport while French ofﬁcials held back family groups of Algerian workers. Borders, as sites of conﬂict and constraint, can embody long-standing tensions. In my work on this project, my being neither French nor Algerian, nor indeed American, may have given me a clearer view of cultural trafﬁc in the Mediterranean during an earlier era. It is a view as if from a spy satellite looking down on the region—an appropriate metaphor perhaps for the right of inﬁnite purview that the Western way of knowing arrogates to itself. The camera eye in the satellite receives a mass of undi¤erentiated information that has to be interpreted. Channels for information have to be formed, data made to tell a story. Such a process involves selection, hypotheses, prejudices. I am mindful of the morass of information I have confronted in excavating this history of Orientalism. Forging channels and constructing stories have been the hardest parts of the exercise, given the relative dearth of scholarship on such images and texts. As the camera eye of the satellite responds to the commands of the controlling power, so my historical construction serves a set of scholarly protocols, moral or ideological biases, aesthetic aversions and preferences, even publishing imperatives. The discipline of art history has helped guide me, although I feel this book is as much an informal contribution to the sociology of art or of colonial culture as, say, a history of style. My aversions have not been to kinds of painting—my admiration for cultural studies enables me to regard the sea of Orientalist “kitsch” as material worthy of study. My preferences for the modernism of the French masters has nevertheless ensured that modernism remains a vector in this history. As for guiding moral biases, they will be too explicit for some, too feebly expressed for others. Although not in itself a contribution to Theory, this book is built on my responses to the intellectual climate of postcolonial theory, in particular the work of Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Homi Bhabha, profound critics of colonialism. In Australia I have lived with the actuality of a settler culture coming to terms with its indigenous past and present. My own passion for both Aboriginal art and the politics of its interpretation has been the screen through which I have, semiconsciously, viewed questions about settler and indigenous cultures and political relations in North Africa. The cultural heritage I study in this book is by no means my own. Who has the greatest claim on Orientalist painting, it is hard to say. It is only marginally the heritage of the Algerians, many of whom must have but a tangential interest in the visual arts of their colonial past. At the struggling museum, closed soon after my visit because of explicit threats from the fundamentalists, there were\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nmore pressing issues than museum history. And indeed the museum, with its gross sculptures that contradict the Hadith (or deeds of the Prophet) and its lubricious subjects in painting, had never spoken to orthodox Islam. It had been built by the French, for the French and a minority of Europeanized évolués (indigenous who had “evolved” toward the colonialists’ culture) who savored the visual arts. Its renewed relevance in decolonized Algeria did not extend to the celebration of colonial origins. As for the French, they too are divided in their claims on this art, although French men and women were its main exponents. Very few French art historians or curators have visited the Algiers museum— some curators were astonished when I stated my intention of visiting. But they were the custodians of modernism, and the relation of modernism to the colonial sphere has always been uneasy. Elsewhere in France there is a lively interest in art colonial (to use the current French term), fueled by colonial nostalgia and the art market’s search for new sensations, both complex. Colonial nostalgia, the sentiment of loss experienced by French people driven by political circumstances from a country where they had struggled to make a home, has its validity. The pieds-noirs (Algerian-born French people) may be as close as one gets to the owners of the culture I am studying. But the scholarship emerging from such nostalgia can be partial to a fault.1 The new market for Orientalism involves a considerable clientele of non-Western buyers, Muslims who are coming to see in the sometimes unlovely products of French ethnographic painting indices of their own premodern past.2 My own interest in the French painting of North Africa is rooted in allegiance to the modernist tradition. All my postgraduate work in the United States dealt with Henri Matisse. Regrettably my initial master’s paper on Matisse ’s Moroccan paintings had been written with a sense of ignorance regarding the cultural context of such exoticist moments. I conceived this book a decade later to answer the question, what was Orientalist art in the time of its historical emergence? How was it thought about, written up, reviewed? Under what conditions was it produced, exhibited, collected? The answer entails a careful historical account of Orientalist art and its relations with colonial culture, one that considers the politics of representation driving postcolonial theory and retains a sense of connection to the problematics of modernism, if only to view them obliquely, in the light of histories whose existence modernist historiographers have forgotten. What does it mean to attach PierreAuguste Renoir to the Orientalist tradition, and see his impressionism as a secondary matter? To learn that some critics argued the innovations of impressionism were enabled by prior experiences of travelers to the East? How would it skew the image of Henri Matisse to see him as a fellow traveler in the caravan of colonial art tourists, whose work was made possible by the annexation of Morocco? To accept the aesthetic riddle of his seeking inspiration in Islamic art yet turn the tables on avantgardist histories and see that quest as the spin-o¤ of colonial policies of government support for Islamic artisanal traditions? It amounts to recontextualizing modernism from the periphery: considering how Renoir and Matisse looked from colonial Algiers and Tangier, on the one hand, and from the perspective of the now marginalized belle époque academicism, on the other.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nThe many imagined claimants on such a history of Orientalism, from art-loving Saudi sheikhs to pied-noir families, from French museum professionals to American art history students, indicate that it is eminently cross-cultural. Orientalist painting is an art of the interstices, often made literally on the move. In its primary state, images made “before the motif ” in places distant from France, it visually translates cultural misunderstanding, limited or absolute, across borders. The Orientalist view or photograph retains, as it were, the skin of the scene, but little of its inwardness. Among the few traveling artists—they are a special focus of this book—who took the time to learn their way into indigenous cultures, absorbing language, religion, and customs or living with the people they painted, was Etienne Dinet, alias Nasr’Edine Dinet (to give him his Algerian name). In his case, resocializing the self made it possible to transform the meaning of Orientalist paintings, even if it provided little in the way of aesthetic revelation. On the other side of such a cross-cultural exchange is the work of the few indigenous artists who took up painting. They are rare indeed compared with the myriad Europeans, Americans, even Australians who traveled in search of subjects to the countries of the Maghreb (the Arabic word for the setting sun that designates the cultural and geographic bloc comprising the three large states of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco). The future artists Racim and the landscapist Azouoau Mammeri, as children of the indigenous elite in Algeria, had little choice whether to imbibe French language and cultural knowledge alongside the mother tongue and the Koran. For them, to be socialized by Francophone culture was a way forward. In adulthood, however, their decision to pursue painting in the face of local tradition was a distinct expression of will. To reconsider Orientalist art in the hands of “oriental” subjects is to break free of the interpretative vise applied to painting by admirers of Edward Said’s great study of European literary Orientalism.3 Orientalism is no longer a one-way journey, a stream of visions frozen by European travelers and carted home for consumption, without reference to the responses of those objectiﬁed in the process. A visual technology like painting, implanted in a colonial situation, becomes available to users other than those who imported it. Like language, it can talk back to the colonizer, in strophes appreciated for their visual poetry even if their potential to restate meaning goes unperceived at the time (as in Racim’s case). The forms of painting shift and are riven in the exchange, and non-European currents—such as the Persian miniatures that are Racim’s primary reference—may be incorporated into the mix, stressing cultural fealties outside the local, agonistic range. Better tools for describing such relations are available since Homi Bhabha suggested how indigenous people in colonial situations could live their mental life, strategically mimicking the Other to retain a space for the self.4 Even if such mimicry means splitting that self, this revised estimate of colonial situations recognizes the possibilities for indigenous agency. The recognition needs to be extended from the study of individuals to colonialism as a system. Colonial systems, stretching back to the Roman imperium, can be thought of as the most ancient instance of the supracommunal struc-\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ntures now called globalizing. The best models for analyzing them stress precisely the endless mutual inﬂection of participants, even in situations of unequal power. As Nicholas Thomas observes: “the dynamics of colonialism cannot be understood if it is assumed that some unitary representation is extended from the metropole and cast across passive spaces, unmediated by perceptions or encounters. Colonial projects are construed, misconstrued, adapted and enacted by actors whose subjectivities are fractured—half here, half there, sometimes disloyal, sometimes almost ‘on the side ’ of the people they patronize and dominate, and against the interests of some metropolitan ofﬁce.”5 At the same time, given such a necessary correction to unidirectional, condemnatory discourses, one needs a realistic assessment of power in the colonial relation. In this book of ten chapters, just two treat the activity of indigenous artists, and one of these involves a subaltern relation of anonymous decorative artisans organized by French colonial bureaucrats. The in-between men like Dinet, Mammeri, and Racim remain remarkable exceptions. Their unusual status is the result of many things, including the cultural disinclination among Maghrebians to make ﬁgurative images and the prevalence of painting skills (since vanished) among the French middle classes. But their exceptionalism also results from the extrinsic limitations, both institutional and personal, of my project, which have to be acknowledged. The museums, archives, and libraries where I have worked were assembled largely by the French, and my linguistic skills (I do not know Arabic) mean that the overwhelming voice, when it comes to painting in North Africa, is a “French” one, as I have translated it. When other histories of such material are written, scholars with di¤erent language skills and vantage points may complete what is here only a partial movement toward reassessing indigenous agency in Orientalist art. My treatment of the visual and textual materials out of which I write has two main axes: arttheoretical and institutional. The ten chapters broadly alternate between these axes—between conditions of production and conditions of reception. The one informs the other: the cognitive and critical understanding of Orientalist painting modiﬁed the personal and governmental strategies that brought the paintings about, and vice versa. The institutional approach, it seems to me, has the virtue of dispensing with the minute intensive scrutiny of enlightened individuals that is the bane (and the joy) of conventional art history. It allows broad patterns for the Orientalist phenomenon to emerge— the role of exhibiting societies, of events like colonial expositions, of travel scholarships administered by the state, of art museums. In particular, this emphasis on institutions allows the ﬁrst art-historical test of a provocative part of Said’s thesis, his Foucauldian insight that the links between colonial governance and aesthetic production were more than just benign and circumstantial, that they were constitutive in fundamental ways. My research corroborates this part of Said’s case. Not only was the French colonial presence in the Maghreb a precondition of Orientalist art there, but Orientalist precepts also harmonized with thinking about the Other in contemporary colonial theory. The danger in dealing with institutions is the loss of the human face, and in a book on art, of the\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\naesthetic dimension. My second emphasis—on Orientalist aesthetics and artists—gives me the chance to people the account with vivid personalities and signal pictures. Some of the artists are familiar names in less-than-familiar guises (like Renoir or Matisse, each given a chapter). Others (like Mammeri or Racim) are unfamiliar names whose claim on the attention of Euro-American art lovers I want to press here. Writing chapters on individual artists compels an engagement with mainstream art history—largely the history of the avant-garde. But earlier arguments on the Orientalism of the past have been based on incomplete art-historical information. A major aim of this book is to inject further information into the discussion. I have taken pains to seek out forgotten primary texts on Orientalism—and they, like the artists themselves, are remarkably numerous. Some, by major art critics like Eugène Fromentin or Léonce Bénédite, merit close attention, for they articulate an aesthetics of Orientalism that is co-extensive with the painting. Others, such as the numberless reviews of exhibitions of Orientalist art, give a sense of the conceptual range in which the French public and critics thought about pictures made in colonies or protectorates overseas. The alternating accounts of institutions and speciﬁc identities take the reader through a series of microstudies of speciﬁc institutions, works, and actors. I intend with this approach to underscore the connectedness of colonial personalities, art world organizers, artists, and works in a historically grounded theater of colonial activity, looking both out and back from the metropole (roughly, the home country). Long-lived, energetic critics and bureaucrats, intent on carving out power bases from which to advance their personal and colonial agendas, shaped the world of French colonial culture to a signiﬁcant degree. Again and again in Parisian Orientalist a¤airs one comes across these gatekeepers, such as Léonce Bénédite, art scholar and curator of the Luxembourg Museum in Paris, who shuttled between that city and Algiers; Armand Dayot, the administrator of traveling scholarships who founded the journal Art et les Artistes; or Gaston Bernheim, the famous dealer who helped run the Colonial Society of French Artists. In the Maghreb their counterparts were the more elusive Prosper Ricard, an expert in Algerian and Moroccan indigenous art; Jean Alazard, curator of the National Museum of Fine Arts of Algiers; and Victor Barrucand, the lapsed symbolist newspaperman and patron of the writer Isabelle Eberhardt. Among the artists only Etienne Dinet had a comparable ubiquity of action in shaping the emerging ﬁeld of European art in dialogue with indigenous sites and traditions. From the patterns of their inﬂuence, something like a sociology of the colonial art world emerges. Speciﬁc institutions associated with such ﬁgures are woven into the historical account. It is worth considering those institutions as collectivities generating Orientalism: large entities that (like the modern corporation or nongovernmental organization) shift men about and (unlike it) produce artworks. The ﬁrst of the institutions is the Society of French Orientalist Painters, set up around 1893 by Dinet and Bénédite, its president, whose aesthetic platform was modeled partly on the ideas of the critic-\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\npainter Fromentin. The society was like a visual propaganda-development wing of the Ministry of the Colonies, which helped fund its annual Salons and, with the governments of the bigger colonies, established scholarships for young artists from the metropole to work in the French colonial empire from Morocco to Indochina. The society, ﬁrst envisaged at the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition, thereafter contributed easel pictures and panoramic paintings to almost every universal and colonial exhibition in France. Dioramas and panoramas (see Chapter 5) mediated colonial imagery for the mass audience of the great expositions. The French Ministry of the Colonies commissioned the society’s artists and made the exotic both a paying attraction and a form of propaganda. Indeed the globe-trotting painter Louis Dumoulin proved himself a versatile showman in his grandiose panoramic installation of 1900, the Tour du Monde. Traveling scholarships have a cross-institutional character, fertilizing Orientalist art by bringing individual painters, sculptors, and architects into the broader machine of the French colonial empire. My study of the scholarships descends to the quotidian, telling how young and often insecure artists coped with life on government stipends in remote desert locations. Their expressions of enthusiasm or bewilderment are held against the visual record of their pictures, and the challenge of landscapes and peoples well beyond their previous experience. The Algerian government’s scholars at the Villa Abd-et-Tif, who were designated by Bénédite in Paris, gave a speciﬁc visual proﬁle to colonial painting in the 1920s—the so-called School of Algiers. That group in turn had a formative impact on the National Museum of Fine Arts of Algiers, set up in 1930 by Jean Alazard. A study like this,which aims at grounded cultural history rather than investigates visual typologies, needs temporal and geographic limits. The half century from about 1880 to 1930 that I have chosen to study involves the period when French colonial expansion was at its apogee, and when the art movements of modernism complicate the aesthetic tableau. Because many of the critical issues raised by Orientalist art were present in romantic and realist criticism between 1850 and 1880, Chapter 1 sketches that earlier critical discourse. My own account becomes more detailed at the point when standard accounts of Orientalism say the movement went into decline. I argue on the contrary that Renoir’s Algerian impressionism and Gustave Guillaumet’s and Dinet’s desert naturalism mark an entirely new phase, the least known and most interesting of all. The period after 1880 also marks the new imperialism, as France acquired colonies or protectorates—in Indochina, Tunisia, West Africa, Madagascar, and Morocco—in the years leading up to World War I. The many artists issuing from France in this period were a cultural by-product of this engine house of colonial expansion under the Third Republic. The book’s main focus is the high modernist era bounded by the exposition of 1900 and two expositions of the early 1930s that make a logical terminus: the Centenary of French Algeria in 1930 and the International Colonial Exposition at Vincennes in 1931. The National Museum of Fine Arts\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nof Algiers was built for the little-known centenary, for the visual was crucial to centenary symbolism: paintings, posters, stamps, photographs, museum and military displays—all had a place in this grand fete of colonialism. If the signs of colonial resistance were largely suppressed in Algeria, in Paris two counter-expositions showed the anticolonial currents nascent among metropolitan and indigenous radicals. The book closes with them, but only in the 1950s did a chain reaction of political crises and wars bring about the almost complete dismemberment of the French colonial empire. I want to explain my geographic focus on North Africa in view of my remarks on colonialism as a global system. Historical ideas on Orientalism have always been closely tied to geopolitical conceptions of space. For the painter-writer Ary Renan (son of the great historian), the Orient was a “vague word deﬁned quite clearly by the frontiers of the ancient Muslim conquests”; that is also my general rule of thumb.6 In a century of warfare France, England, and to a lesser extent Italy had replaced the Turks as the main military and trading forces in much of the Ottoman Empire. Although I accept the French sense of the term “Orient,” I focus on relations between the metropole and the western part of that Orient—the Maghreb—for several reasons. Algeria was much the oldest French possession in North Africa, and the only one that became a thoroughgoing settler colony. Its history was permanently entwined with the visual arts—from the popular woodblocks that recorded the landing of French troops at Sidi-Ferruch in 1830 and Eugène Delacroix’s monumental Women of Algiers of 1834 forward. As will be seen in Chapter 1, Algeria long remained the setting most popular for Salon pictures of Eastern subjects. A variety of conditions— travel infrastructure, relative security, francophony—abetted the raw appeal of the exotic that appeared so abundant in the mountains and oases of that country. The smaller nation of Tunisia, declared a French protectorate (governed jointly with the beys of Tunis) in 1881, also became a popular destination for artist travelers (the most celebrated of whom was the Swiss Paul Klee). Except for the part it plays in my discussion of the art nouveau designer Victor Prouvé, who went there on a traveling scholarship, Tunisia is less a focus of my account than Morocco, which succeeded Algeria as the favored destination of French artists after it was made a protectorate in 1912. For the French, Morocco, never an Ottoman possession, represented an ancient and inaccessible Moorish culture. Its symbolic status had been established by Delacroix’s watercolors and canvases, images later revised by rare visitors like Benjamin Constant and Henri Regnault. After the annexation of 1912 Matisse was among the ﬁrst to arrive there in what became a veritable ﬂood of painters. But protectorate Morocco is equally interesting for its experiments in fostering the indigenous decorative arts under the guidance of Marshal Hubert-Gonzalve Lyautey. Lyautey, a career soldier and administrator with experience in Indochina, Madagascar, Algeria, and Morocco, is a crossover ﬁgure who exempliﬁes colonialism as a transnational system. His progressive ideas about associating the colonial government with native hierarchies, adopted in all four colonial theaters, bore fruit in his cultural policies for Morocco. He encouraged the indigenous painter Mam-\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nmeri and placed heritage issues, such as “reviving” the extensive Moroccan arts industries, in the hands of French artists working alongside indigenous craftsmen and -women. Orientalist artist bureaucrats like Dumoulin or Joseph de la Nézière (whom Lyautey hired) were similarly creatures of global colonialism. But their peregrinations to Indochina, Japan, or Senegal are beyond the scope of this book. This study, unlike Gwendolyn Wright’s admirable work on French urbanism in Morocco, Madagascar, and Indochina, is not a deliberately comparative project.7 French painting in other colonial theaters must await further study. I hope instead to gain strength from my spatial focus on the axis from Paris to Algiers, with lines of cross-reference to Tangier and Tunis, Granada and Marseille. The North African component of this ancient Mediterranean littoral was a byway of Roman, Punic, and Berber cultures in antiquity and of Arab, Berber, and European cultures in modern times. Part of the French covetousness of the nearby Orient drew on perceptions of the imaginative and historical richness of the Maghreb as a location for culture. It is a commonplace that the national imagining of France was deﬁned in part by what (or whom) it excluded—those people who were outreRhin or outre-Manche, or Belgian or Spanish. The Maghreb is curious in that the French imperial will required its integration into the idea of the French nation. The easy way, conceptually, was to adopt a hierarchical model of inferior colonial dependencies that enriched, but did not impinge on, the metropole. Much Orientalist painting of Maghrebian people and places observes that separation. The more difﬁcult and interesting (if equally problematic) option was to rethink the French nation as encompassing and embracing North Africa, culturally and politically. The antique Latin connection— Frenchmen asserting that they were the new Romans come to reclaim their inheritance—went some distance but violently negated the Arab and Berber presence. The concept of cross-cultural fusion with current North African culture remains fascinating. That idea advanced further in art and letters than in politics. It animates the most interesting moments of Orientalism—when French painters “went native,” Algerians “went modern,” and European avant-gardists and conservatives alike opened up to the promptings of aesthetic traditions not their own. Political history called a violent halt to the process on the ground, but in the rareﬁed realm of the aesthetic, the rather beautiful idea of such a merging has by no means had its day.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\n1 Orient or France?\n\nNineteenth-Century Debates\n\nRomantic Critics before a Desert Street I myself am su¤ering to some extent from a nostalgia which drags me towards the sun; for I ﬁnd an intoxicating mist arising from these luminous canvases, which soon condenses into desires and regrets. I catch myself envying the lot of those men who are lying outstretched amid their azure shades, and whose eyes, neither waking nor sleeping, express, if anything at all, only love of repose and a feeling of blissful happiness inspired by an immensity of light. – c h a r l e s b a u d e l a i r e , “The Salon of 1859” (translated by Jonathan Mayne)\n\nFew writers did more to suggest a psychology for European exoticism than Charles Baudelaire. The desire for expatriation is strong in his contemplation of an oil painting, nostalgia for a sun so absent in a wet Paris spring, envy for the lot of men understood as creatures entirely given over to their senses. Baudelaire looks to the East as a place to repair the deﬁciencies of life in modern France, a\n\n11\n\nmentality continued in his poems of longing for distant climes. In his “Parfum exotique,” “La chevelure,” and the celebrated “Invitation au voyage” from his book Les ﬂeurs du mal of 1857, imaginative escape is conjured by meditations on the poet’s Creole lover, Jeanne Duval. Images of ports and ships, of half-glimpsed tropical foliage, abundant fruit, and warm seas arose as he contemplated the body of his sleeping mistress and her origins elsewhere.1 They entered the French imaginary in a powerful way, suggesting subjects for many a painter, sculptor, and later writer on Orientalist art. The picture that inspired Baudelaire’s reverie in the epigraph to this chapter was Eugène Fromentin’s Bab-el-Gharbi Street in Laghouat (La rue bab-el-Gharbi à Laghouat) (1859; see Plate 1). Fromentin had a way of presenting the physical intensity of color, the direct fall of African light on sun-warmed buildings so that viewers of the painting, in the ﬁltered light of the Paris Salon, were momentarily transported down there, to a land of altered existence. Théophile Gautier also stopped in front of this painting. A leading romantic novelist, travel writer, and poet whom Baudelaire admired, Gautier was probably the most inﬂuential art critic of the Second Empire (Fig. 1).2 In a characteristic witticism he confronts regimented European modernity with haphazard African life: “The Street at Laghouat will never please lovers of progress, who demand for each town in the world the same footpaths, tarmac, street alignment, gas lamps, and enamel house numbers.” The street itself is “as jumbled as the bed of a dry watercourse,” while in the deep shadow cast by the wall of crumbling mud brick, the critic discerns a row of “practical philosophers,” lying as inert as “cadavers enveloped in their shrouds.” 3 These words resound today, ﬁrst, for predicting French colonial urbanism and, second, for alluding to the sack of Laghouat by the French army some years before the painting was made. Not that Gautier, though a seasoned traveler, necessarily knew of the oasis town’s tragic history. Early in a series of journeys to Spain, Turkey, Egypt, and Russia, he spent three months in Algeria in 1845, ﬁfteen years after the French capture of Algiers, the corsair capital, and just two after the ﬁrst long war of colonial paciﬁcation, which crushed the Emir Abd-el-Kader’s jihad, or holy war. The siege and sack of Laghouat did not take place until 1852, as a response to one of the sporadic rebellions in the region. Gautier’s early visit to Algiers had alerted him to an aspect of French colonization that he was one of the earliest writers to regret: the modernization of the ancient corsair city (captured in elegiac mode by Emile Lessore and William Wyld, Fig. 2). Although echoing his friend Gérard de Nerval, perpetually disappointed as he traveled through the Near East encountering peoples and visiting sites that failed to live up to his expectations,4 Gautier varies the theme. His disenchantments resulted from the depredations of Europeans. Orientalist paintings—like those of William Wyld, who had painted View of Bab-Azoun Street (Vue de la rue Bab-Azoun) in 1833—were the visual documents that allowed Gautier to judge the depressing march of civilization: “Having seen [Bab-Azoun Street] recently, I can say that it has not gained from our civilizing presence. . . . So varied, so picturesque, so interesting in former times, [it] will soon be nothing more than a prolongation of the Rue de Rivoli. . . . That abominably ﬁne road, which cannot stretch past the Louvre, has jumped the Mediterranean and toppled\n\n12\n\nOrient or France?\n\nfigure 1 Eugène Giraud, Théophile Gautier Smoking His Chibouk, watercolor, 1862.\n\nthe elegant Moorish buildings so as to continue its frightful arcades.” 5 As if in a prelude to the arguments over Baron Haussmann’s demolition of old quarters of Paris to make way for the great boulevards in the 1860s, Gautier in 1849 regretted the passing of old Algiers. The most glaring act of destruction there was the razing of the Turkish Palace of the Deys to open up the vast Place du Gouvernement (soon ringed with Haussmannesque buildings).6 Adrien Dauzats was one of the early artists to depict this much-painted center of public life in Algiers (Fig. 3). The recently erected statue of the duc d’Orléans (a leader in the war against Abd-elKader) and the masts of ships beyond contrast the French presence with the Mosquée de la Pêcherie, with its stately domes and soaring minaret. The motley crowd—French soldiers, civilian men and\n\nOrient or France?\n\n13\n\nfigure 2 Emile Lessore and William Wyld, View of Algiers, Seen from the Faubourg Bab-Azoun, lithograph, 1835.\n\nfigure 3 Adrien Dauzats, The Place du Gouvernement at Algiers, oil on canvas, 1849.\n\n14\n\nfigure 4 Riding Camels, wood engraving, 1869.\n\nwomen, Turks, biskris (members of the guild of porters, originally from the town of Biskra), Bedouin (nomadic Arabs), and Berbers in full costume—gives a sense of the polyglot city ignored by most artists. In 1846 in his account of the city, Alger extra-muros, Gautier lamented the incongruity of the new French buildings (encroaching at far left in Dauzat’s painting) and the loss of historic buildings like the forbidding fortress Bab-Azoun.7 Thus in viewing the Street at Laghouat Gautier rejoices in what o¤ends those “lovers of progress” the French colonists, who were settling the temperate hinterlands of Algeria. Gautier did not oppose modernization as such: he lauded the new steam technologies that powered the passenger boats, enabling rapid scheduled crossings of the Mediterranean. “Steam-power, so often belittled as bourgeois and prosaic, has carried o¤ [artists] with the spin of a propeller or a wheel, with more speed than the legendary hippogri¤. Today the Sahara is dotted with as many landscapists’ parasols as the Forest of Fontainebleau in days gone by.”8 European modernity, preceded (as Gautier conceded) by military conquest, had done much to enlarge the horizons of art by giving artists new subjects. But the march of modernity itself in the Algerian colony was generally not a valid subject for serious art (Fig. 4). The romantic critic expected paintings to image otherness—architectural, ethnographic, or climatic. Insofar as Gautier and the traveling Salon artists he applauded were tourists, that requirement of the cultural tour has changed little in a century and a half. In the Fromentin painting, the shadow where the sleeping Arabs lie is, metaphorically, the shadow of a violent past of which the artist was well aware. Fromentin was the ﬁrst major artist to sojourn in Algeria for extended periods after the war with Abd-el-Kader. Most of Dauzats’s or Horace Vernet’s paintings in the earlier 1840s had been commissioned to celebrate the campaigns of the duc d’Or-\n\nOrient or France?\n\n15\n\nfigure 5 Eugène Delacroix, Arabs Traveling, oil on canvas, 1855.\n\nléans, the duc d’Aumale, and Field Marshal Bugeaud—Vernet produced huge military canvases of a kind execrated by Baudelaire.9 Fromentin, traveling as a private individual, instead imaged a more peaceable Algeria, its landscapes and above all its Bedouin people of the plains. But France ’s paciﬁcation was provisional: there was intermittent military action in the Saharan zone and, later in the century, in the populous mountains of Kabylia and the Aurès, in particular the great Kabyle Insurrection of 1871 and its aftershocks. The Siege of Laghouat of 1852 was such an action, with bloody repression following the taking of the town. Like most of the French campaigns it was depicted in now largely forgotten military paintings.10 In his travel book Un été dans le Sahara Fromentin noted the devastation of the desert town, put to the sword by the French just months before his arrival there in 1853. Fromentin gave no sense that he thought the French were wrong in their massacre of inhabitants, carried out with the collusion of tribes “friendly” to the French. To do so would have been impolitic, given his own reliance on the French military presence for his security. Traveling with a small armed entourage, he could have journeyed to the Sahara only with the permission of the military ofﬁcers of the Bureaux arabes who administered the Algerian territories. In his apparently timeless image of Laghouat peace\n\n16\n\nOrient or France?\n\nis restored, and the age-old afternoon siesta resumes, allowing a concentration on such aesthetic issues as the opposition between the intensely blue sky and the parched mud-coated desert buildings. Fromentin’s material vision made the romanticized Moroccan landscapes of Delacroix (Fig. 5) seem dated and presaged the early impressionists’ experiments with light in the next decade.11\n\nFromentin and the Aesthetics of Travel\n\nBetween his debut in 1847 and his painting Bab-el-Gharbi Street at Laghouat of 1859 Fromentin became the ﬁgure around whom debates on the merits of the Orientalist genre crystallized. While his paintings gave rise to passionate discussions, his writings on Algeria essayed an aesthetic of Orientalist practice. By the time his novel Dominique was published in 1862, Fromentin had established a unique reputation, being recognized equally as a writer and a painter. He is best remembered by art historians for Les maîtres d’autrefois (1876), a work on the seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish schools that Meyer Schapiro called “a masterpiece of criticism which may be read beside Baudelaire’s.”12 Of his two travel books, Un été dans le Sahara (1857; Sahara hereafter) and Une année dans le Sahel (1859; Sahel hereafter),13 the ﬁrst received eloquent reviews from George Sand and from Gautier, who quipped that Fromentin as a writer “has become a master without ever being a student.”14 Fromentin’s role as a theorist of Orientalism has yet to be given its due. If the studies of Léonce Bénédite at the turn of the twentieth century are any guide, Fromentin was the most inﬂuential voice on this issue in the nineteenth century. Delacroix, who preceded him as a painter and writer who traveled to North Africa, o¤ered no systematic discussion of the problems of painting in the East. Whereas Fromentin published two travel narratives that are as complete as novels, Delacroix attempted nothing more than private letters home, fascinating though they are, and artist’s notes published posthumously as part of his Journal. In his pages on what he calls “la peinture orientale” Fromentin systematically explores the parameters of the category. He had journeyed to Algiers and Blida in the spring of 1846 with Armand du Mesnil, returning to make his Salon debut with two Algerian landscapes. He went back to Algeria for the 1847–48 winter, traveling farther south with the painter and early photographer Auguste Salzmann to the near Saharan oasis of Biskra (about which see Chapter 7).15 His last and longest stay, of 1852–53—in the company of his wife, Marie Cavallet de Beaumont, who remained in the temperate Sahel while Fromentin ventured south to Laghouat—became the basis for his Sahara. He wrote Sahel, however, ﬁve years after leaving Algeria, in the form of letters backdated to the time of his travels to give immediacy to his text. Elisabeth Cardonne emphasizes Sahel as “the fruit of a profound work of memory, which draws the data of experience into mental compositions of exceptional acuity”—a mnemonic feat much admired by the Goncourts and others.16 Although Fromentin traveled to Algeria primarily to paint, he recounts very little of that activity in his books,\n\nOrient or France?\n\n17\n\nmoving about the country, once he has left Algiers, less as a purposeful traveler than a ﬂâneur of the open spaces whose aims are not revealed. Key passages, however, address the problems of painting the Orient. The most important of them, in Sahel, begins: “The Orient . . . has the fault of being unknown and new, and of evoking at ﬁrst a feeling foreign to art—dangerous to it—that I would like to forbid: a feeling of curiosity.” Curiosity in this now dated sense is the attraction of the new and peculiar and involves a quickening aroused by novelty that might seem trivial in the grand scheme of art. For the Orient, Fromentin continues, “is exceptional, and history shows us that nothing beautiful or durable has been made with exceptions. It escapes general laws, the only ones worth following. . . . Even when it is very beautiful, it retains a certain modicum . . . of exaggeration, of violence that renders it excessive. This is an order of beauty that, having no precedents in either ancient literature or art, strikes us initially as bizarre.”17 Fromentin’s skepticism about the project of painting the East is surprising. He gains his conviction from measuring the task against a familiar system: the academic tradition he had imbibed in the painting studio of Louis Cabat. He responds to scenes that “escape general laws” and “have no precedent in either ancient literature or art” with an alarm similar to that of classicist and neoclassicist critics confronting an excess of brute, vulgar detail (whether in the paintings of Caravaggio in the seventeenth century or in the realism of Fromentin’s contemporary Courbet). The task of painting, in this academic tradition, was not merely to copy nature in all its unselected, chaotic form, but to assimilate the visible to ideas of the beautiful, le beau idéal, by selectively adjusting natural elements.18 Classicist criticism rates academic precedent and the active forming of material above any truth inassimilable to the tradition it represented. Fromentin nevertheless had the resources to go beyond academic tradition, and in treating the new class of subject, he generated a critique of “documentary” painting of the exotic. In the 1850s Fromentin had argued forcefully against an ethnographic approach to painting. He thought it dangerous to present to the European viewer aspects of life in the Orient so bizarre as to be inassimilable to the art of painting. Displaying something without precedent in the history of European representation would risk revealing “de périlleuses nouveautés”—dangerous novelties (a phrase later taken up by Léonce Bénédite). As Fromentin argued, the public might come to expect of painters information proper to travel diaries, “pictures composed like an inventory, [so that] the taste for ethnography will end up being confused with the feeling for beauty.” 19 Fromentin called the manifestations of the taste for ethnography documents, meaning “the visual signal for a country . . . the exact type of its inhabitants . . . their foreign and strange costumes, their attitudes, their postures, their customs, their duties, which are not ours.” 20 Clearly, Fromentin had little tolerance for the scientiﬁc image making that for well over a century had been part of the task of exploration in the Paciﬁc and elsewhere. In that attitude he di¤ered from Gautier, who proclaimed that the old national schools of Europe must be succeeded by a universal school, in which all types\n\n18\n\nOrient or France?\n\nof humanity will be represented, the “monotony of the European type” being varied by “the exotic charms of Hindu beauty, Arab beauty, Turkish beauty, Chinese beauty.” 21 The disciplines of ethnography and ethnology, understood as writing or describing the characteristics of peoples, had ﬁrst emerged as a science in Western Europe in the late eighteenth century. French and British voyages of exploration in the Paciﬁc and even Russian scientiﬁc expeditions sta¤ed by German scholars to newly conquered Siberian territories typically impelled such study.22 By the 1820s and 1830s in France ethnologists began to integrate diverse racial, geographic, linguistic, and historical elements, so that the ﬁrst Ethnological Society, founded in Paris in 1839, dedicated itself to pursuing “the physical organization, the intellectual and moral character, the languages and historical traditions” of speciﬁc peoples.23 The concept of ethnography was widely di¤used enough for Gautier and Fromentin to take it up in the late 1850s, and Jean-Léon Gérôme to be labeled a producer of “ethnographic canvases” on account of his “remarkable aptitude for seizing and rendering the typical characteristics of diverse peoples.” 24 The broad sense of “ethnography” was gradually displaced, and by the turn of the century it was considered descriptive, “the scientiﬁc mapping out of di¤erent racial regions, nations and tribes.” 25 As Patricia Lorcin has shown, Algeria was the great French testing ground for ethnographic data and theories of race.26 Fromentin’s books make up for the avoidance of ethnographic detail in his paintings. His travelogues contain copious descriptions of the North African scene, the landscape and vegetation, the towns, the oases and their activity, and the people he met and occasionally befriended. In Sahel he gives a detailed picture of Mustapha, the hamlet where he lived just outside the walls of Algiers, and includes vignettes of his favorite corner café in the Algiers Casbah (the “Carrefour de Fromentin”). Further sites include that focus of women’s public social life, the cemetery of Bab-Azoun. Such texts correspond to an iconography of Algerian subjects selected by Orientalist painters and lithographers like Wyld and Théodore Frère but largely neglected in Fromentin’s own painting. His awareness of the local discomfort with the painter’s prying eyes led him to suggest a protocol he largely followed, one that appears radical in the context of later Orientalist practice: “It might have been possible for me to enter the mosque, but I did not try. To penetrate further into Arab life than is permitted seems to me misplaced curiosity. This people must be seen from the distance at which it chooses to reveal itself: men close up, women from afar. To describe a women’s apartment or to paint the ceremonies of the Arabs’ religion is in my opinion graver than fraud: it is to commit, in the matter of art, an error of point of view.” 27 Fromentin’s own art looked, not to the iconography of town and city, but to the great open spaces of Bedouin nomadic life. He painted distant views of their encampments under rolling clouds and innumerable scenes of horsemanship and the hunt on the open plains of the Sahel (Fig. 6). While squarely in the tradition of Delacroix’s and Théodore Chassériau’s more violent mounted duels and lion hunts (Fig. 7), such images correspond closely to the milieu evoked in the second half of Sahel.\n\nOrient or France?\n\n19\n\nfigure 6 Eugène Fromentin, Arab Falconer, oil on canvas, 1863.\n\n20\n\nfigure 7 Théodore Chassériau, Arab Chiefs Challenging Each Other to Single Combat under the Ramparts of a City, oil on canvas, 1852.\n\nThere Fromentin details a falconry hunt at Lake Haououa and a fatal fantasia (a display of riding and skill in arms by a mass of galloping horsemen) that followed. In the latter a key character in the narrative, a Mozabite (town-dwelling desert Berber) beauty friendly to the narrator, named Haoua, is crushed by a horse ridden by her jealous husband. The drama of both the fantasia and the accident is absent from Fromentin’s painting, however, as are the scenes of harsh desert life in the Sahara volume (with the notable exception of the Land of Thirst (Pays du soif ).28 Fromentin admitted he was emotionally drawn to the glamour of the exotic yet rationally repelled by it. That incompatibility of responses can be linked to his technical limitations as a painter, which he himself lamented. (He felt, for example, that Delacroix was the only artist skilled enough to represent adequately that great image of Maghrebian horsemanship, the fantasia.)29 But the broader problem was to communicate with a European public lacking the wherewithal to appreciate the exotic scene, because the Oriental landscape, for Fromentin, “escapes every convention; it is outside any discipline; it transposes, it inverts everything.”30 Such classicizing biases impinge on one last aspect of Fromentin’s travel books: his sense of the East as biblical. Presuppositions shared by Delacroix, Gautier, and many other travelers to the East in the nineteenth century led them to compare the Oriental scene to ancient Rome and Palestine. Fro-\n\nOrient or France?\n\n21\n\nmentin pushed the biblical analogies further than most.31 In Sahara, for example, his encounter with a tribe on a march evoked the migrations of ancient Israel. Painter colleagues in Paris had recently argued that the old masters “had disﬁgured the Bible by painting it,” and the only way to revive its spirit was to go to the Orient and contemplate its “living efﬁgy.”32 In theology the correlate of this argument was Ernst Renan’s Vie de Jésus Christ of 1861, a controversial ethnographic reconstruction of Christ’s life that had the e¤ect of querying his divinity. Against such modernism Fromentin sided with the old masters, reinforcing the biblical character of the Arab people of the Sahara, who possessed “real grandeur,” achieving “without being nude, . . . that almost complete stripping back of exterior form that the masters conceived in the simplicity of their great souls.” 33 Fromentin was not pleading here for painters to use Bedouin sitters to give local color to biblical paintings. For him that approach was doomed: “To costume the Bible is to destroy it.” Such conversations about race and ethnicity continually animate Fromentin’s narratives. His observations treat not just Arab people but also categories like “Moors” and “Negroes,” whom he had trouble deﬁning, and the mercantile classes of Jews, who were ancient immigrants, and Mozabites, who were autochthonous people. Fromentin wrote almost nothing, however, about the various southern Mediterranean peoples—Italians, Maltese, Corsicans, and Spanish, who, with the Provençals, Alsatians, and other French, made up a good proportion of the colonials arriving in North Africa in the nineteenth century. Such exercises in ethnographic classiﬁcation typify the writings of French visitors to, and settlers in, the colony, starting with the military observers of the Bureaux arabes who had ﬁrst begun to categorize the peoples with whom they had either to negotiate or to ﬁght. As Patricia Lorcin has admirably demonstrated, such writings propagated the Kabyle myth, which argued for the racial separateness of the Berber peoples of Algeria (primarily the Kabyle, Chaouia, and Mozabite groups) from the Arabs. The Berbers were considered autochthonous Algerians who had resisted the waves of Arab conquest by retreating to the Atlas Mountains of Kabylia and the Aurès. They lived in villages and farmed, unlike the nomadic Arabs, and thus had developed characteristics and social institutions that brought them far closer to Europeans than the Arabs would ever come. The Berbers’ conversion to Islam had only ever been partial, unlike that of the “fanatic” Arabs. According to the racial scale most Europeans accepted in the nineteenth century, the Berbers were well above the Arabs, if below the Europeans. Arabs were generally denigrated for their immorality (their practice of polygamy), their irrationality (their acceptance of Koranic religion), their lack of productivity (their failure to either farm or pursue a trade), and a general duplicity.34 Fromentin’s observations contradict the conclusions of the Kabyle myth while preserving its structure and its contrast between nomadic and sedentary peoples. He idolized the Arabs, writing of the heroism of their nomadic life, their moral toughness, their simplicity. In Sahel he spends pages deﬁning\n\n22\n\nOrient or France?\n\nthe Bedouin peoples of the plain against the sedentary Moors, city dwellers of Turkish heritage and commercial disposition. Kabyle farmers scarcely appear in his account, perhaps because he rarely encountered them. Such racial preferences underwrite the imagery of his painting, so wholly given over to the people of the plains and arid zones. As for indigenous perceptions of the French, Fromentin had few illusions. Indeed, in a politically precocious passage he describes the Arab hatred of the French. But he defends his countrymen as much better rulers than the Turks, even as he details the estrangement of a colonized people in their own land because of the abhorrent presence of an invader: “What [the Arabs] detest in us . . . is not our administration, more equitable than that of the Turks; our less venial legal system; our religion, which is tolerant of theirs. . . . What they detest is our proximity, that is to say, ourselves: our style, our habits, our character, our genius. They fear our very kindness. Not being able to exterminate us, they endure us; unable to ﬂee us, they avoid us. Their principle, their maxim, is to be silent, to disappear, and to have us forget them.” 35\n\nThe Realist Critique of Orientalism: Castagnary and Duranty\n\nIt is not far from Fromentin’s ambivalence about the French presence in the Orient to outright opposition, both to colonialism and the more specialized art it engendered. It is not surprising that when an intellectually sustained critique of Orientalist painting challenged the unmitigated approbation of Gautier and Baudelaire and the equivocation of Fromentin, it came from the realists. Members of that camp were both opponents of the academic order and critics of the social order. Baudelaire’s distaste for military painting and all it stood for was shared by authors on the French Left, but as the century advanced, their perception of the problems of the colonial enterprise became more far-reaching. The socialist position—that capitalists in the international framework had as little right to exploit workers in foreign climes as they did the European proletariat—was articulated well before the turn of the century. Charles-Robert Ageron has shown that leftists had no monopoly on anticolonial sentiment.36 They were joined, for di¤ering reasons, by French royalists and by republicans such as Georges Clémenceau, who felt that after the defeat of 1871 France should muster all its military resources to face the threat on the border with Germany, rather than spread them thin across territories outside Europe. Argument also raged (and has continued to rage) over the economic beneﬁt of the colonies to France—whether they cost more to run than they returned, thus draining the nation’s resources in the name of national pride and in the desire that France hold a position commensurate with that of her European rivals, England in particular. Such arguments only occasionally ﬁltered through to discussions of art. More often writers on the visual arts justiﬁed French colonialism on cultural grounds. Because, they argued, colonialism is a civilizing enterprise, bringing to African and East Asian countries the “beneﬁts” of a modern social\n\nOrient or France?\n\n23\n\norder, trade, communications, literacy, and—perhaps above all—religion, it was an indisputable good. The argument against modernization also found its place early on in art criticism, with Gautier, as we have seen, leading the way. He valued the East for its di¤erence from modernizing Europe and feared European urbanism, imported from across the Mediterranean, as a destructive force. Realist writers such as Champﬂeury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and above all Antoine Castagnary seldom dismissed Orientalist art on explicitly political grounds, instead relying on aesthetic arguments. Yet there is a logical congruence between rejecting European colonial hegemony and the realists’ call for French artists to occupy themselves with the problems of the national school on French soil, to prefer France to the Orient. Castagnary developed a critique and sustained it over two decades, from 1857 (when as a young law clerk he published his ﬁrst Salon review) to 1876, when he e¤ectively declared Orientalism dead and buried.37 He may be credited with introducing the term “Orientalism” to deﬁne a tendency in art, as often happens, in a pejorative sense, isolating and decrying what he considered a negative development. Gautier, an ebullient but unsystematic critic, had written positively of “Africanist” and then of “ethnographic” painting but let both rubrics quickly fall into disuse. Castagnary realized the advantages of being consistent in his negativity. In his “Salon of 1857” he refused to describe exoticist painting in detail, considering it a waste of space he could devote to the contemporary French school of landscape, led by his hero Gustave Courbet, which was making important advances. He classed exponents of exotic scenes among the inferior landscapists, who “go far o¤ to search in the Orient, deep in the desert, for a nature that is extraordinary and lacks any relation to our ideas and our temperament. . . . In vain do they . . . reproduce e¤ects that we, as men of the Occident, are unable to judge, as these e¤ects ﬁnd no harmony in ourselves.” 38 These arguments have a familiar ring. Fromentin had appealed to concepts of “le beau” in claiming that the African landscape stretched the limits of representation. Castagnary appeals, not to such elite values, but rather to the psychology of the broad public, whose faculty of judgment is seemingly limited to afﬁrming the veracity of what it knows by experience. Courbet put that view of painting in his famous letter to his students of 1861, a manifesto of realism thought to have been ghostwritten by his friend Castagnary. The letter argued that painting was an essentially concrete art that should be concerned only with real and existing things, and that judgments about beauty and truth were always relative, dependent on an individual’s faculty of understanding.39 It follows for Castagnary that painting the local French scene makes the best sense in art: “I love the nature that surrounds me because, being born into it, used to seeing it, I and such a nature are in intimate correlation. It has, as it were, entered into the development of my ideas, participated in the formation of my personality, and wherever I go, I carry it with me. Now your desert, your palm trees, your camels may astonish my intelligence, but they will never produce the sweet and peaceful emotion given me by\n\n24\n\nOrient or France?\n\nthe sight of cows in a meadow edged with poplars.” 40 That afﬁrmation of place and European identity is almost xenophobic. In describing some archetypal Barbizon landscape replete with cows, meadows, and poplars, Castagnary excludes any image of the nation made outside the hexagon of true France. The French colonial empire—what came to be called greater France or France overseas— did not qualify as a subject for painting. Fromentin’s growing reputation caused Castagnary to make a few concessions. It is not clear when he ﬁrst read Fromentin’s Sahara, but in his next major Salon review Castagnary betrayed a sneaking admiration for Fromentin, an amateur writer envied by professionals, a lawyer and artist unanimously considered preeminent among painters of the Orient. Nevertheless for Castagnary, Fromentin remained too much the romantic, interested in the “picturesque point of view,” always searching for “the joujou, the pretty touch that ﬁts in well.” But the critic continued to hope Fromentin would take a more naturalist turn, and again paint French subjects, French identity.41 The term “Orientalist” ﬁrst appears in Castagnary’s writing when he returns to the attack in his “Salon of 1864.” There is nothing remarkable about the term itself, which, as Said has shown, was regularly used to describe nineteenth-century scholars, in particular linguists, philologists, and historians of the Near and Middle East. Indeed in 1873 the International Congress of Orientalists was founded in France to promote such studies.42 Castagnary sought reason to ﬁnd the painters he called Orientalists (such as Léon Belly and Narcisse Berchère) unpatriotic, guilty of a failure to believe in the beauty of France and its people. Orientalists, consumed by a hatred of the here and now, have but one desire, to “ﬂee Paris, to abscond from the world around them, to escape the obsession with the real and the present. There is nothing they would not prefer to what is.” 43 It is not surprising to ﬁnd the realist associating escapism not only with place but also with time. That imaginative transposition includes both mythological subjects and the painters of distant ages, like Lawrence Alma-Tadema, in his Egyptians of the Eighteenth Dynasty (Egyptiens de la dix-huitième dynastie). Jean-Léon Gérôme, an exponent of the neo-Greek taste, was one of the most prominent contemporary Orientalists who traveled regularly (Fig. 8). Castagnary was scathing about Gérôme ’s selling o¤ the studies he had made during his voyage to the Orient: “His Almeh is a note he should have kept in the portfolio. It is of a coldly calculating indecency, and I recoil from describing it. Petit métier, in any case, mean, unpleasant, boring in the extreme.”44 Escapism, lack of patriotism, abhorrence of social realities, technical conservatism—such were the insults the realist critic threw at Orientalism in the year following the Salon des Refusés. Before the end of the decade little had occurred to counter the decadence of the genre for Castagnary.45 Then the young Henri Regnault burst onto the scene. His Spanish work, the Portrait of General Prim (Portrait du Général Prim) and his Salomé of 1870, attracted considerable attention from the many artists and critics who still had faith in the Salon as the location of important new art. Regnault was an elite convert to Orientalism: winner of the Prix de Rome, he had defected from the academic main-\n\nOrient or France?\n\n25\n\nfigure 8 Jean-Léon Gérôme, The Almeh (Arab Girl in a Doorway), oil on canvas, 1873.\n\nstream by giving up his scholarship and residency at the Villa Medici (the base in Rome for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, often called the Rome School) to travel to Granada. There, in the company of his friend Benjamin Constant, he made a series of magniﬁcent watercolor studies of the Alhambra Palace. The two men then set up a studio at Tangier (on the Moroccan coast opposite Gibraltar), where Regnault intended to undertake a series of ambitious canvases on life under the Moorish caliphs of Granada. Few were painted: Regnault’s Summary Execution under the Moorish Kings of Granada (Exécution sans jugement sous les rois maures de Grenade) is by far the most famous. The little-known Execution of a Janissary (L’Exécution d’un janissaire), its setting modern Egypt under Sultan Mahmoud II (who suppressed that elite armed force in 1826), was also produced in Tangier.46 Regnault, returning to France in a patriotic fervor in 1870, was killed by a stray bullet while on defensive patrol against the besieging Prussian army on the outskirts of Paris.\n\n26\n\nOrient or France?\n\nCastagnary admired Regnault, although he mistrusted the bravura of the General Prim and considered the Salomé (which he failed to categorize as an Orientalist work at the Salon of 1870) as an exercise in painting colored accessories. Castagnary was doubtless aware of the Summary Execution, which, after the restoration of order, spread the shock waves of its theatrical violence through the Musée du Luxembourg (as through the Musée d’Orsay today). Regnault’s more intimate masterpieces, including the watercolors Hassan and Namouna (Hassan et Namouna) (named for a tale from the Thousand and One Nights; see Plate 2) and Haoua (named for the tragic heroine of Fromentin’s Sahel ), had been painted in a Parisian studio during the Siege of Paris. They were shown in a posthumous exhibition of Regnault’s work at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1872 and praised by an aged Gautier.47 After the successive catastrophes of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune of 1871, Castagnary, a staunch republican, was able to return to his reviewing. From 1873 to 1879 he came to occupy an increasingly signiﬁcant position as a political commentator and ofﬁcial, and in 1887 (the year before his death) he was named to the peak administrative position of director of ﬁne arts.48 The year 1876 marked the final battle of his campaign against Orientalism. He orchestrated all his previous critiques into an expanded text that culminated in the coup de grâce of declaring the movement dead and buried. He wrote the most cogent historiography of the movement yet to appear, detailing its initial development, stimulated by the Greek War of Independence, and its progression during the war for Algeria, when “"
