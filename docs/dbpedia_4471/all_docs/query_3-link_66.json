        "text": "Collection of essays on the art market and connoisseurship in the Netherlands of the 17th century, edited by Anna Tummers and Koenraad Jonckheere\n\nThis article deals with the topic of erroneous attributions within Rembrandt's oeuvre, including the problem of certificates of authenticity written by well-known Rembrandt scholars at the turn of the 20th century and later.\n\nAccompanying the related exhibition, Leiden circa 1630: Rembrandt Emerges illuminates the early career of Rembrandt and his peers. Essays explore the artists in broader contexts, including Leiden’s historical and cultural profile, process and novelty in printmaking, the city’s art market and the history of collecting paintings by the master in Canada. The four essays, accompanied by entries on the works featured in the exhibition, offer profound insight into the motivations, aspirations and achievements of an extraordinary group of artists."
