Inscribed verso, below, in graphite: “369.874. S” [the last character unclear] and on the brown backing card, lower right: “Sc”\n\n180 x 147. Watermark: none visible; chain lines: horizontal (distance apart uncertain).\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing may once have belonged to the album of studies of women and children recorded in Jan van de Capelle’s collection in 1680 (see under Benesch 0194).\n\nReading the drawing from left to right, the old woman seems to hold a coin, then to reach for her bag and finally to secure it there. The way the veil is drawn in the upper version of the figure shows that it was created last.[1] At the upper left another group is sketched, with a woman and child (seen from behind) apparently approaching a second woman, who seems to be leaning on a half- door or balustrade. More lightly sketched, this group has more in common with the style of Benesch 0194, 0226 and 0228, while the contrast in the thickness of the lines is reminiscent of Benesch 0235.\n\nAs with many iron-gall ink drawings by Rembrandt (for which see under Benesch 0157), the lines have ‘spread’ because of the acidic action on the paper. To judge from old black and white photographs (one included here), the condition has continued to deteriorate in the last century. Nevertheless, the drawing’s attribution does not appear problematic when compared with the documentary works in the same medium, such as Benesch 0161 and 0168; it also helps secure Benesch 0381 for Rembrandt.\n\nBenesch noted the old woman’s resemblance to a Rembrandt school painting in Braunschweig, also known through an etching of 1755 by Johann Anton Riedel (see reproduction).[2]\n\nThe verso, first published in 2022, might well show again one of the female models on the upper left of the recto.[3] She could have been the nurse holding the child on the recto. Comparable figures appear in Rembrandt’s paintings, prints and drawings as a repoussoir figure at the lower left of his biblical and historical compositions, including in the documentary drawing Benesch 0168 (recto and verso) and the etching of Joseph Telling his Dreams of 1638 related to it.\n\nCondition: the iron-gall ink has eaten into the paper (see further above); some foxing.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1638-39.\n\nCOLLECTION: D Weimar, Goethe-Nationalmuseum (inv. Schuch, I, 874/0004).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Schuchardt, 1848, I, p.309, no.874; Neumann, 1918, no.11, repr.; Benesch, 1935, p.23; Benesch, 2, 1954/73, no.301. repr.

Before 14 January 2023, when this entry was updated to take the verso into account, it was noted that the drawing was “laid down but a sketch of a head seems to show through the paper.”\n\n[1] This reverses the reading given in Exh. Amsterdam, 1999.\n\n[2] The painting after Rembrandt in Braunschweig is repr. – also using the Riedel etching – by Bode and Hofstede de Groot, 8, p.156, no.6.\n\n[3] As noted by Ketelsen, 2022. He compares figures seen from the same angle in Benesch 0228 and Benesch 0391.\n\nFirst posted 11 November 2016. Updated to take account of the newly revealed verso 14 January 2023.\n\nBenesch 0302\n\nSubject: Two Studies of a Woman with a Child\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink, rubbed with the finger. Inscribed verso, upper left, in black chalk: “244”\n\n176 x 119. Watermark: none; chain lines: 23-24v.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing, which is much faded, belongs in style with Benesch 0258-9, with looser, less rigorous penwork than one would expect from Rembrandt himself. Indeed, even in comparison with these two drawings, the forms appear slack – note the hands, which may be compared with Benesch 0261 – and the characterisations seem yet further from Rembrandt’s mark. None of the documentary drawings provides support for an attribution to Rembrandt and the sketch was probably made by a pupil, perhaps in the early-to-mid-1640s but possibly later (cf. Benesch 0408), emulating Rembrandt’s own studies of women and children, and for style, his more liquid drawings of c.1635-42 (cf. Benesch 0292, 0482 recto and 0188). These qualities are reminiscent of drawings attributed to Ferdinand Bol (cf. Benesch 0475, Sumowski 93x) although as yet I hesitate to place the drawing under his name.\n\nCondition: much faded and also foxed.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1645-53?\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum (L. 2228; inv.RP-T-1930-52)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Lippmann, III, 43; Exh.

(L. 2170); probably his sale, London, Langford, 5 February and following days, 1772, part of lot 2 (individual drawings not described); Sir John Charles Robinson (L.1433; the mark has been largely erased); from whom purchased as by Rembrandt with seven other drawings through the dealer Agnew’s of London, by Dr Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, 1901 (Hofstede de Groot notes, Royal Library, The Hague) by whom presented to the present repository in 1906 but with usufruct; transferred in 1930.\n\nFirst posted 12 November 2016.\n\nBenesch 0303\n\nSubject: Mother and Child Seated in a Chair, the mother in profile to right\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink with brown wash, probably also rubbed with the finger, on paper tinted brown; some fine but hesitant touches of pen and dark grey ink (in the child’s face), by a later hand; ruled framing lines in pen and brown ink.\n\n117 x 127. Watermark: none visible (laid down).\n\nCOMMENTS: The current consensus appears to reject this drawing, but in the light of a comparison with Benesch 0382, I am more than a little inclined to accept it. The hatching and the penwork in general seem close in style. However, comparisons are more difficult with any of the documentary drawings, although the manner in which the brush is used resembles the wash in Benesch 0164 of 1638. That date seems plausible if the drawing is indeed genuine, as I believe it probably is.\n\nIf so, it may have featured in the album of drawings of women and children mentioned under Benesch 0194.\n\nCondition: light foxing; later touches as noted under medium above.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt (?)\n\nDate: c.1638?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin, Staatliche Museen Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett (inv.

(notes later touches; states the drawing was likely owned by Jan van de Cappelle as a Rembrandt, yet a work of Rembrandt’s school, c.1646; too schematic for Rembrandt; inspired by Benesch 0482 or a similar drawing; Benesch 0410 thought by the same hand; further compares Benesch 0302, 0304 and Benesch 0425); [Not in Schatborn, 2019].\n\nPROVENANCE: Acquired by the present repository before 1878.[1]\n\n[1] See under Benesch 0314 for the possibility that this drawing may be a fragment of one formerly in the Valerius Röver collection, described as including “een slapend vroúwtje met een kindtje aan de borst van Dezelve”.\n\nFirst posted 14 November 2016.\n\nBenesch 0304\n\nSubject: Two Women with a Baby\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink; ruled framing lines in pen and brown ink.\n\n130 x 110. Watermark: a crowned shield (cut)\n\nCOMMENTS: Superficially the drawing might appear acceptable on the basis of Benesch 0303, but overall the attribution seems much more suspect: barely a line gets a grip on the form, the structure falls apart and the hand is generally hesitant. A comparison with the secondary sketch in the background of Benesch 0301 is instructive in this regard. The drawing may have been partly inspired by Benesch 0382 and the supplementary figure behind is the least prepossessing passage of the composition. The fragmentary sketch at the top seems unlike Rembrandt himself and the main drawing has been compared with Benesch 0258-59; [1] a closer analogy for the lower lines, where the ink is somewhat paler, would appear to be Benesch 0261, yet even here the present work seems less fluent and coherent. Overall, the style approaches the work of Ferdinand Bol more closely (cf. the kneeling Magdalene in Benesch 0537).\n\nCondition: faded; trimmed at the top.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt (Ferdinand Bol??)\n\nDate: c.1640?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Dresden, Kupferstich-Kabinett (L.1647; inv.

Paris, 2006.\n\nFirst posted 16 November 2016.\n\nBenesch 0305\n\nSubject: Two Orientals Standing in Discussion\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink with brown wash; ruled framing line in pen and brown ink.\n\n170 x 115.\n\nCOMMENTS: Despite the presence of two dubious collectors’ marks, the drawing could well be a genuine Rembrandt school work. There are links with the style and iconography of drawings such as Benesch 0209 and it may have been made at around the same time, although in this case an attribution to Rembrandt himself is not even remotely likely (and the ink is certainly not iron-gall). The right hand figure resembles his counterpart in Benesch 0665a, and also the figure second from the left in the etching of c.1639, The Presentation in the Temple (Bartsch 49; NH 184). The left figure resmbles that in Benesch 0211. Benesch’s comparison with the style of Benesch 0412 is reasonable – see especially the broad outlines and the dots for the eyes.\n\nCondition: generally good, some minor spotting and staining.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1640-45?\n\nCOLLECTION: whereabouts unknown (since 1978).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Exh. Frankfurt, 1926, no.360; Benesch, 2, 1954/73, no.305, repr. (c.1636; compares Benesch 0412); Exh. London, 1978, p.73, n.1 (style of Rembrandt; forged Reynolds mark); Konstam, 1978, p.32, n.3 (based on mirror image of same figure); [Not in Schatborn, 2019].\n\nPROVENANCE: Joshua Reynolds (dubious version of L.2364); another mark, a cross (not otherwise recorded, probably also fake);[1] E. Calando (L.837 – if the mark is genuine); Robert von Hirsch, Basel; his sale, London, Sotheby’s, 20 June, 1978, lot 47, sold for £3,500.\n\n[1] I am grateful to Peter Fuhring and through him to Donato Esposito for their opinions on the marks. The latter notes that the Reynolds mark closely copies the illustration in Phillips’ March 1798 sale of the artist’s collection (correspondence in late November 2016). It does seem odd to go to the trouble of producing the ‘fake’ stamp, only to use it once. Could it be that in fact the drawing was in Reynolds’s collection?\n\nFirst posted 17 November 2016.\n\nBenesch 0306\n\nSubject: A Man Reclining, Apparently Ill\n\nVerso: Head of a Man in a Wide Fur Hat [1]\n\nMedium: Pen and (dark) brown ink, perhaps retouched with the reed pen, with some brown wash (mostly above); verso: pen and brown (iron-gall?) ink.\n\n75 x 123.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing belongs in style and iconography with Benesch 0307 (qv), which reveals that the figure is recumbent in bed. The rather thin, spindly pen style is reminiscent of Benesch 0163 of c.1638 and is likely to be by the same hand. Rembrandt himself used such thin lines in the slightly earlier Christ Carrying the Cross, Benesch 0097. In Benesch 0306-7 there is a certain amount of wash, plus in the present case the area above, perhaps a trial of the brush. The verso only adds ammunition to the idea that the drawing is not by Rembrandt himself, though it resembles Benesch 0377.[1]\n\nCondition: generally good, though trimmed from a larger sheet.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt/Rembrandt??\n\nDate: c.1638-39\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin, Kupfersichkabinett (inv.3012a; 113-1885)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Amtliche Berichte, VII, 1887, col.VII; Michel, 1893, p.574; Hofstede de Groot, 1906, no.144 (early; shows Man Taking off his Shoes); Freise, Lilienfeld and Wichmann, 1914, no.136 (probably middle period); Exh.

However, in this case the formulation of the hands resembles that of the recumbent Christ in Benesch 0100 recto, a reason why an attribution to Rembrandt himself, though unlikely, is not completely impossible for these two drawings.\n\nCondition: some foxing and other stains, mostly near the periphery.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt/Rembrandt??\n\nDate: c.1638-39\n\nCOLLECTION: F Paris, Louvre (L.1886a; inv.

Watermark: none visible; chain lines: 26h.\n\nCOMMENTS: Although in red rather than black chalk, the style seems close to Benesch 0277 and Benesch 0280a and the drawing is likely to date from c.1636-37.[2] Like them it may have belonged to the album of drawings of women and children mentioned under Benesch 0194.

It is presumably a French drawing of the eighteenth century” (see Literature below).\n\nThese remarks are of considerable interest – one might say that the drawing appears almost “too good to be true” – and they require refutation if the drawing is to be retained for Rembrandt. As Hofstede de Groot wrote, the chalk colour is less warm than in most of Rembrandt’s other red chalk studies and comparable in tone to a kind of sanguine sometimes employed by eighteenth-century French artists (like Hubert Robert, Greuze and Ango); also, while the scale and the composition echo Rembrandt’s studies of old men from the Leiden period, the chalk is here handled with the greater breadth of the years from around 1635-45, or even later. The whole conception of the forms is extraordinarily bold, with broad ‘zones’, one for the head, another for the torso and the third for drapery-covered legs. The combination of such definite outlines with soft parallel shading is characteristic of the above-named, and other, French eighteenth-century draughtsmen. In addition, the chair and the figure compare quite closely with a painted portrait of 1654 in the Hermitage, a work now usually assigned to Rembrandt’s school,[1] and this led Sumowski tentatively to advance an attribution to Nicolaes Maes (see Literature below). But might the drawing have inspired the pupil? Or is the drawing, in fact, from the 1650s?\n\nThus the drawing poses the usual two questions: 1. is it by Rembrandt? 2. when was it made?\n\nComparisons with the documentary drawings do not resolve these questions clearly. In red chalk, apart from the Leiden period studies of old men, especially Benesch 0037, Benesch 0040 (which has some comparably broadly handled passages below) and Benesch 0041 (note the similarly clasped hands), all of which seem less regular and smooth in their outlines and general execution, there are few analogous figure drawings.[2] The Studies of St John the Baptist (Benesch 0142a recto) despite having, on the left, some comparable pentimenti in the profile to those seen in the old woman’s left arm, are more tentative and searching. The Portrait of Cornelis Claesz. Anslo of 1640 (Benesch 0758) again seems more searching and much less fluent.\n\nMore convincing analogies were remarked on by Starcky,[3] who drew attention in particular to Benesch 0254 (for the way the detail peters out below), Benesch 0196 (for the smooth shading of the skirt, though it must be earlier) and Benesch 0376 (for the drapery); for the dress and character type he noted the similarity to the woman below the Baptist in the grisaille now in Berlin of the mid-1630s (Bredius 555; Corpus A106, vol.VI, no.110). To these comparisons may be added the hatching in the drapery to the right of Benesch 0421, a drawing in which the figures, albeit smaller, are also conceived in the same structurally broad terms. This approach is also encountered in Benesch 0357. Another characteristic Rembrandt touch is the sharp loops seen at the extreme left of the drawing, where the sitter’s drapery re-emerges from under the arm of the chair, and again at the lower right of the drawing. For the rather mechanical-looking juncture of the arm and hand at the wrist, compare Benesch 0280a and 0280e (in the former of which the modelling of the lower face is also somewhat comparable). Finally the stronger, more emphatic strokes of the chalk seen in the most important outlines, correcting and clarifying the underlying work, are a feature of many Rembrandt drawings in all media, seen in parts of Benesch 0137, where the drapery again has points of similarity, as does the use of strong outlines (in the head).\n\nIn the light of these similarities it seems prudent to date the drawing, albeit tentatively, in the later 1630s, and to accept that its exceptional fluency anticipates qualities that were embraced by French artists in the eighteenth century, including Fragonard. If in some respects the drawing ‘stands out’ in Rembrandt’s oeuvre, it can only be that, unusually, it is a ‘set piece’, a drawing made more as an end in itself than as a sketch or study towards another work of art.[4]\n\nIt has been suggested that the drawing is a portrait of the artist’s mother, but the identification is far from convincing.[5] But as noted above, the figure does resemble, especially in her attire, the model used for the woman below the Baptist in the Berlin grisaille. Her headdress also compares well with Benesch 0152 and 0154.\n\nA somewhat harsh copy was in the collection of the late E.

Watermark: none visible; chain lines: 24-25v.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing was long associated with a painting in Darmstadt, now given to the school of Rembrandt, depicting the Flagellation of Christ (Bredius 593). It is dated but the inscription, originally read as 1668, is now thought to read 1658.[1] Although the match with the figure on the left is not a really close one, it conveys a sense of the potential purpose of the youth in the drawing, posed like a garzone in an Italian Renaissance workshop. But in the drawing his youthful, optimistic appearance seems geared towards a more positive raison d’être.[2]\n\nThere are two distinct campaigns of work in different styles: first came the flickering penwork, most visible in the head and upper arm, which gives a lively impression, though not one that can easily be compared with anything by Rembrandt himself. Benesch 0263 has something of the same quality, though the lines are there kept under slightly tighter control, at least in the head and hands. Benesch 0267 is also comparable and includes some work with the brush which, although emphasising some outlines, stands apart in style from what we see here.\n\nIndeed, the wash and the lines made with the tip of the brush, which belong to the ‘second campaign’, seem to belong to a much later era, and it is therefore not surprising to find that past writers have hovered between dating the drawing to the mid-1630s, as suggested by the penwork, and the 1650s or ‘60s, as is argued by the work with the brush (and also by the supposed date of the Darmstadt Flagellation, mentioned above). In the use of the brush, there are technical and stylistic elements in common with Rembrandt’s drawing of Hendrickje Stoffels in the British Museum of around 1654 (Benesch 1103). But where Rembrandt conveys a sense of the weight and placement of the figure, the present artist was less successful and overall the execution appears more heavy-handed; nor do we experience the tension created by the rope in the arm, or as it winds its way around the body.\n\nAre these strictures too severe? The similarities with Rembrandt’s work may be only generic, but they seem as close as any to be found among the works of Rembrandt’s followers, and a date in the 1650s seems probable. Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, whom we associate with the above-mentioned pen drawings (Benesch 0263 and 0267), was also a practised and proficient draughtsman with the brush, but his style seems rather different in character.[3] Carel Fabritius has been invoked,[4] but on the basis of the core drawings attributed to him, such as Benesch 0500 and 0506, the penwork is far removed from what we see there. Only the heavy outlining and the generosity of the wash make any connection, but in the present work the outlines are applied with the tip of the brush rather than a pen and the way the brush is manipulated is not echoed in Fabritius’ paintings. Closer is Benesch 0709, also recently associated with Fabritius and in which the outlines are applied with the brush once more, but the links between that drawing with Fabritius are also insecure, limited to the comparability of the heavy penwork with the underpaint of Fabritius’s paintings as revealed by X-radiography. So for the time being the drawing is here catalogued as anonymous but also as ‘associated with’ Carel Fabritius; and the possibility that the drawing belongs with Benesch 1101-1103 also remains in contention – an example of a drawing that may not easily ‘fit’ in Rembrandt’s oeuvre, but could nonetheless be his work, as discussed in the introduction.\n\nA drawing of a figure similar to the one here, but on a ship hoisting a bale on board is in Berlin.[5]\n\nCondition: generally good; lightly foxed.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt (Carel Fabritius??)/Rembrandt?\n\nDate: c.1646-54\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum (L. 2228; inv.

The harsh formulation of the left hand, which resembles a scroll or even a book, is only truly paralleled in Rembrandt’s work by the child’s feet in Benesch 0313![3] Compare also the drawing, formerly attributed to Rembrandt (though not in Benesch), of a Woman in a Rich Costume, now in the Ulmer Museum.[4]\n\nWhether the man is an actor or not is open to debate. The drawing was generally believed to belong with Rembrandt’s depictions of figures from Joost van den Vondel’s tragedy, “Gijsbrecht van Amstel”, although this has been questioned (see under Benesch 0120).[5] It may be that the figure is simply decked out in mid-sixteenth-century clothes from Rembrandt’s own wardrobe of vintage clothing.\n\nCondition: some foxing, more severe on the verso than the recto.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1636-40.\n\nCOLLECTION: GB London, Victoria and Albert Museum (L.1957; L.153b; inv.

Watermark: none.\n\nCOMMENTS: This highly-regarded drawing was long thought to represent Saskia with one of her and Rembrandt’s children. But the child looks to be too old for any of Rembrandt’s children of the 1630s, who all died within weeks of their births, while the style of the drawing belongs so clearly to the mid-1630s that it cannot represent Titus, who was born in 1641. Various plausible but speculative alternative identifications have been suggested, including the children of Saskia’s sister, Hiskia, or those of Saskia’s cousin, Hendrick Uylenburgh.[1] The woman looks almost too young to be the mother.\n\nThe date is confirmed by analogies with several drawings. Among the documentary drawings, the lilt of the drapery resembles the figure at the lower right of Benesch 0141 but in its breadth, also in the wash, it compares better with the yet bolder Benesch 0092 of 1635 and Benesch 0095 probably of a year or two later. Its analogies with the work of Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, as seen in Benesch 0113, which seems notably less spirited and confident, and in Benesch 0316 – the drawing chosen for comparison by by Benesch – show how closely the pupil could emulate his teacher. The heavier lines in the cap, and the underlying lines describing the back of the head, suggest that the cap was an afterthought.\n\nFor the paraphe at lower right, see under Benesch 0113. The drawing may have come from the album of drawings of the life of women with children discussed under Benesch 0194.\n\nCondition: generally very good ; some slight discolouration especially near the extreme edges and the fragmentary framing lines suggest a minor amount of trimming.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1635-37.\n\nCOLLECTION: USA New York, The Pierpont Morgan Library (inv.I, 191)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Fairfax Murray, 1905-12, I, no.191, repr.; Bode and Valentiner, 1906, p.83, repr.

The character of the penwork is more mincing, almost like needlework, than Rembrandt’s when he draws comparable works in the late 1630s or later – cf. Benesch 0440; Benesch A10 – the period to which this seems to belong.[1] Compare also Rembrandt’s own drawings executed with a fine nib, such as Benesch 0360 and Benesch 0687.\n\nIt may be that the draughtsman, surely one of his own pupils, drew inspiration from Rembrandt’s etchings of c.1634-38, in which he employed fine lines and ‘dots’ in a manner that seems to be emulated here – cf., for example, the Portrait of Saskia with a String of Pearls in her Hair of c.1634 (Bartsch 347; NH 136), the Studies of the Head of Saskia and Others of 1636 (Bartsch 365; NH 157), Three Women’s Heads, one Sleeping, of 1637 (Bartsch 368; NH 161), and the Small Jewish Bride – Saskia as St Catherine, of 1638 (Bartsch 342; NH 169). In Barstch 365/NH157 especially, we also encounter the same detailed treatment of the eyes and the fine, near vertical parallel hatching on the chest. Among Rembrandt’s drawings, the ‘small dots’ technique appears to such an extent only in drawings that are among his earliest, such as the documentary study of Two Studies of the Head of an Old Man, of c.1626 (not in Benesch; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, inv.83.GA.264) or the Self-Portrait, of c.1628-29 in the Rijksmuseum (Benesch 0054).\n\nFurthermore, the drawing of the thumb and two fingers on the child’s shoulder do not resemble Rembrandt’s own depictions of hands; neither does the hatching either side of the neck reflect his own chararcteristic practice. The subsidiary study below is difficult to ‘read’, whether as the arm of the child or an independent sketch, perhaps a head supported by an arm.\n\nThe verso must have been begun in a comparable style to the recto – the fine lines of the underdrawing are still visible in places. A broader-nibbed pen was then used to correct and define the forms more firmly, but in their unvaried harshness (especially around the chin and cheeks; the vertical zigzag shading below; the profile of the far arm) the drawing seems distant from Rembrandt himself. A number of drawings survive that appear to be pupils’ derivations from Rembrandt’s studies of Saskia in bed and this must be yet another.\n\nCondition: a fragment, with some stains and surface dirt, otherwise good.\n\nSummary attribution: School of Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1640?\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Amsterdam, Museum het Rembrandthuis.\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Benesch, II, 1954/73, no.313a, repr.

Inscribed verso, centre, in graphite: “798” and lower left: “300”; in pen and black ink, lower left: “9/7”; in red ink: “N2924”; in pen and brown ink below, in Esdaile’s hand: “Rembrandt 1835 WE”\n\n130 x 78. Watermark: none; chain lines: 28h.\n\nCOMMENTS: To judge from the description in the Röver inventory (given under Provenance, qv), this drawing could be a fragment of a sheet that originally also showed a sleeping woman with a small child at her breast.\n\nThe figure has been variously described as seated or standing behind a table, and in north or south (Zeeland) Dutch national costume. In fact the costume is from Waterland, an area around 20 miles north (and slightly east) of Amsterdam and including Monnickendam.[1] In a second study in Haarlem (Benesch 0315), what appears to be the same figure is seen from behind wearing the same costume and adopting a comparable pose, again standing near a table.[2] Although on other occasions (see, for example, Benesch 0710) such a repetition has led to the retention of only one version as an authentic work by Rembrandt, the other as by a pupil in the same room, in the present instance both drawings seem to be autograph – in style they cannot be separated, although the impression made by the British Museum drawing (Benesch 0314) is slightly undermined by what appear to be later touches in the face (especially be the eyes and mouth), rework that also extends to the window indicated in the upper background. Otherwise the handling of the pen is everywhere similar, with simple thin outlines in most parts, though with heavier touches under the figure’s right arm, the same treatment of the fur and the ruff of the collar, the same horizontal pleats and shading in the arms and the same sensitive toning with brown wash.The sparing treatment of the face in Benesch 0314 is comparable to Benesch 0286, which suggests that the date could be slightly earlier than 1638, the date I have hitherto preferred.\n\nThe model is described on the verso of the Haarlem drawing as ‘De minne moer van Titus, soon van Rembra […]’ (‘the wet-nurse of Titus, Rembrandt’s son’) in a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century inscription. Titus van Rijn, the artist’s son, was baptised on 22 September, 1641.[3] It has often been suggested that the model was therefore Geertje Dircx, but there are two objections to this idea: first, she is specifically recorded as Titus’s ‘dry’ nurse in a document of October, 1649;[4] secondly, the style of both the Haarlem and the present drawing, as already noted, suggests an earlier date, c.1636-38, several years before Geertje Dircx is known to have had any contact with Rembrandt. One might possibly also argue that the model also looks rather too old. For the style, comparison may be made between them and two documentary drawings of this period: the ‘Studies of a Woman reading and an Oriental’ in the Kramarsky collection, New York (Benesch 0168 of c.1638), which although executed in iron-gall ink resembles them in the rendering of detail and in the application of the wash; and the study in Leiden for the 1638 etching of Adam and Eve (Benesch 0164), in which the group on the right is realised in a similar shorthand to the seated figure in the Haarlem drawing (Benesch 0315). Whether or not the inscription on the latter is reliable, the name of the model remains uncertain.\n\nCondition: generally good; probably trimmed (see also the description in the Röver inventory) and retouched (see above); slightly faded; small repair upper left edge and repaired tear upper right edge; small restored patch under the figure’s right breast.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt\n\nDate: c.1636-38\n\nCOLLECTION: GB London, British Museum (inv.1895,0915.1270)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Vosmaer, 1868/77, p.517/601 (see note 5); Robinson, 1869/76, no.779/798 (said to be nurse of Titus); Exh.

Berlin-Amsterdam-London, 1991-2, p.352) and confirmed by De Winkel, 2006 (see Literature).\n\n[2] Without denying the similarity of the pose in the two drawings, the ingenious theory that a mirror was used and the figure drawn twice from a single vantage-point, proposed by Konstam, 1977/78, p.92/28, seems to go too far and is contradicted by the position of the table in the present sheet (which, if it were a reflection, should be on the spectator’s left), of the sitter’s right hand and left arm (the hand of which would p[robably be visible; only the cloth is in the correct hand), by the position of the artist seen beyond the table in the Haarlem sheet and of the shadow behind the figure in the British Museum’s drawing. Objections have already been raised by Borssum Buisman, 1984. The dress is not necessarily the same one (or if it is, then probably not worn at the same sitting) because in the British Museum drawing the collar seems to be wider and the fur travels over the outer edge of the shoulders rather than the inner part; the cap also seems to be lower. When the two drawings were exhibited together (in Exh. Edinburgh-London, 2001, nos.80 and 81), the Haarlem drawing looked browner overall in the paper, while the ink looked somewhat warmer and less dark (sadly the illustration of Benesch 0314 came out much too warm, so that in the catalogue they look more similar).\n\n[3] Strauss and van der Meulen, 1979, p.209, no.1641/4.

As there stated, there are objections to identifying the model as Geertje Dircx, who was the dry-nurse of Titus rather than the ‘wet-nurse’ (“minnemoer”) mentioned in the inscription on the verso. The drawing was traditionally often dated in the 1640s in order to accommodate the idea that Geertje Dircx was the model, as she was unlikely to have entered Rembrandt’s household until after Titus’ birth in 1641, and perhaps not until after Saskia’s death in 1642. This idea still has its appeal – and its hold – on the imaginations of the drawing’s cataloguers, but as argued under Benesch 0314, stylistically the drawing appears to be rather earlier and the identification, therefore, falls aside.[1]\n\nThe posed model by the table is here joined by a second figure beyond, probably another artist sketching the figure, wearing a flat cap, looking back (seated not far from the position from which Benesch 0314 was drawn). Thus it appears that a life-drawing class has been assembled, although one which left no further traces than these two drawings. The delineation of the torso and arms of the woman in both drawings is more detailed than in most of Rembrandt’s pen sketches and this is instructive when assessing other works in which he scrutinised his model in depth. At the same time, the loose indications of part of an archway in pen and with the tip of the brush in the present drawing reveal Rembrandt at his most cursory.\n\nTwo copies of the drawing are known.[2]\n\nCondition: generally good; a small repaired hole upper right; some general staining and discolouration of the sheet and perhaps some fading of the ink (see remarks under Benesch 0314, end of n.2).\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt.\n\nDate: c.1636-38\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Haarlem, Teyler Museum (inv.O* 51, formerly O* 76 a [added]).\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Exh.

Watermark: the top of a shield, with three circles in the curved upper rim as commonly seen in watermarks with a Strasburg Lily.\n\nCOMMENTS: This elaborately costumed woman with a Phrygian hat resembles Rembrandt’s own studies of figures from the theatre (see under Benesch 0120).[1] Yet in style she could have stepped out of Benesch 0147, which makes an attribution to Gerbrand van den Eeckhout highly likely. Rebecca’s costume in that drawing is also similar, though viewed from behind. Compare also the penwork in Benesch 0294 and Benesch 0204a. Also characteristic of Van den Eeckout is the ‘tramline’ nose (see Benesch 0108, though this is not unknown in Rembrandt) and the simple division of the oval of the face – as all the old drawing manuals show – with a line across for the eyebrows bisected by another delineating the nose. Finally, the soft brushwork for the features in the right background (a child varying the woman’s train near a balustrade?) is another passage typical of Van den Eeckhout. It is instructive to compare the drawing of a Seated Old Man, to right, of c.1638-39 now in the Lugt Collection (Not in Benesch): executed in the same technique, Rembrandt’s style seems less jagged, drawn with less haste (though perhaps similar speed) and the tip of the brush is more decisively descriptive.\n\nThe closest Rembrandt drawing to the present work is perhaps Benesch 0313 but there are significant differences in the variety of touch, in the hatching, the overall sense of structure and the use of wash, whether within the figure – where in Benesch 0316 it seems merely to fill in the outlines – or in the background. Further costume studies of this type have been justifiably attributed to Van den Eeckhout, including Benesch 0122, 0123, 0312, 0318 and 0319.\n\nCondition: Good.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1638-40.\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin, Staatliche Museen Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett (inv.

Inscribed lower left: “Rt:” (compare Laurentz’s etching after Benesch 0273a)\n\n90 x 78.\n\nCOMMENTS: Benesch considered that this etching, by Johann Daniel Laurentz (1729-1810), copied a lost drawing by Rembrandt, relating it to Benesch 0316-18. The original drawing resurfaced in 2018 and might be by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. That it was Laurentz’s model is clear, as the etcher tried to imitate the later touches of wash on the cheek and nose in the drawing. The graphite underdrawing (hard to discern but visible to the right of the head) is of a type commonly found on copies after Rembrandt, which could also be the case here.\n\nSummary attribution: etching by Johann Daniel Laurentz after Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?? possibly after Rembrandt??\n\nDate: c.1638-40.\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Benesch, II, 1954/73, no.316a (vide supra); [Not in Schatborn, 2019].\n\n[1] Koller, 23 March 2018, lot 3429, repr.; 81 x 70mm; pen and brown ink over graphite, with touches of later wash in the nose and cheek.\n\nFirst posted 7 April 2017.\n\nBenesch 0317\n\nSubject: Young Woman in Rich Costume with an Oriental Headdress, full-length, turned to right\n\nMedium: Pen and brown ink, touched with brown wash lower right and also with white bodycolour.\n\n139 x 95.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing has been taken to represent an actress (or an actor in a female role) which, while possible, is not necessarily the case as the costume could have originated in Rembrandt’s collection of exotica (see also under Benesch 0316).[1] If the figure is an actor, it remains uncertain whether she is Badeloch, from Joost van den Vondel’s play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, as has been suggested (see Literature below).\n\nIn style the penwork closely resembles that of Benesch 0316, now generally ascribed to Gerbrand van den Eeckhout: the sense of haste alongside boldness; the rather jagged outlines, the less fully grasped drapery around the feet; the somewhat even, undifferentiated thickness of the outlines; the delineation of the hands, etc.. Yet there are also links with Benesch 0129, particularly in the zigzag hatching and the wash, although the structure of the figure in Benesch 0317 seems more secure and nearer Van den Eeckhout’s work.[2]\n\nRembrandt’s style at this period (cf. the documentary drawing, Benesch 0292, or Benesch 0293 recto and verso, a figure study by Rembrandt at his most zestful) is in most of these respects wholly distinct.\n\nCondition: Some stains in corners and at top but generally good.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1638-40.\n\nCOLLECTION: D Berlin, Staatliche Museen Berlin (inv.2685)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Amtliche Berichte, 1886,p.vii; Michel, 1893, p.573; Von Seidlitz, 1900, p.488; Hofstede de Groot, 1906, no.130 (c.1634); Lippmann, II, 38B; Saxl, 1908, p.338 (perhaps same woman as in Schoolmaster etching, Bartsch 128; NH 191); Freise, Lilienfeld and Wichmann, 1914, no.117 (De Gelder?); Lilienfeld, 1918-19, p.134 (De Gelder) Benesch, 1923, p.2 (school work, later 1630s; perhaps same hand as Benesch 0293); Van Dyke, 1927, p.82, repr. pl.xviii.71 (De Gelder); Berlin, 1930, p.233, inv.2685 (uncertain if by Rembrandt); Lugt, 1931, p.59 (compares Benesch 0316); Benesch, 1935, p.23; Benesch, II, 1954/73, no.317, repr.

Watermark: none.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing belongs to the group of figure studies that have been associated with actors performing in Joost van den Vondel’s play, Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (see under Benesch 0120 and Literature below). However, the connection with the play is far from certain, as there is insufficient action in the image to connect with its narrative. (The character would have been played by a man, which is perhaps not impossible in the case of the present drawing.) Benesch 0319 and a drawing formerly in the Strölin collection and now in the Ulmer Museum show the same or similar costumes.[2]\n\nThe style seems close to Benesch 0122, although here the figure is isolated and wash has been added. Yet, for example, in the details of the patterned drapery, as well as in the hands and the too-short arms, the two drawings have much in common, as also in the lack of certainty in the area around the feet. There are links with Benesch 0312 as well as with the style of the above-mentioned Benesch 0319 and, especially in the wash, with the drawing of a Woman in a Rich Costume, now in the Ulmer Museum.[2] All these works have been ascribed to Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, although there seems to my eye to be some doubt, here expressed by a question mark, not least because of the stylistic deviation from drawings such as Benesch 0316, with its generally more vigorous, bolder approach to outline.\n\nIt is instructive to compare – and especially to contrast – the style of Benesch 0217 and 0217a, which could have inspired Benesch 0318 to some degree; but the style seems quite distinct, especially in the outlines, proportions and lack of “fuss” over details.\n\nA copy after the drawing was made by Andreas van Rijmsdijk (d.1786), the son of the collector who owned the drawing, Jan van Rijmsdijk.[3] Interestingly, it includes the later additions in grey ink in the original, which must therefore be earlier in date.\n\nCondition: good.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1638-40.\n\nCOLLECTION: USA, New York, Morgan Library (inv.

It is also worth comparing Benesch 0321, which again shows a figure from behind in a comparably rich costume; but the style there is more economical, whether in the use of the pen or the brush.\n\nLike Benesch 0318, the identification of the figure as an actor in a play is uncertain although probable (see also under Benesch 0120). If so, it remains uncertain whether she is Badeloch, from Vondel’s play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, as has been suggested (see Literature below).\n\nThe minor retouchings noted under Medium above have not generally been remarked before; there is also a pentimento in the left hand, which had a thumb, subsequently erased.\n\nCondition: a tear near right edge; some stains and minor discolouration.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1638-40\n\nCOLLECTION: D Dresden, Kupferstich-Kabinett (L.1647; inv.

Watermark: uncertain, but with letters “WR”\n\nCOMMENTS: The costume is similar to that in Benesch 0316 and the drawing seems to belong to the same group. In style, too, there are analogies in the bold wash and the zigzag hatching in the sleeve to the drawings of actors now thought to be by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout (see Benesch 0316-19 and under Benesch 120). However, the wash here tends sometimes to flatten rather than enhance the underlying forms. When in the Koenigs collection the drawing was ascribed to Nicolaes Maes and first attributed to Rembrandt by Benesch. Govert Flinck has also been suggested as its author, not unreasonably.[1]\n\nThe drawings may depict an actor in a female role, but it remains uncertain whether she is Badeloch, from Vondel’s play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, as has been suggested (see Literature below). The gesture with the kerchief resembles the woman in Rembrandt’s – perhaps later – painting of Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, of 1644, now in the National Gallery, London.[2]\n\nCondition: generally good; some foxing or spotting upper right.\n\nSummary attribution: Gerbrand van den Eeckhout?\n\nDate: c.1638-40\n\nCOLLECTION: NL Rotterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (inv.

Chain lines vertical.\n\nCOMMENTS: The drawing has long been associated with the many drawings of actors and with Joost van den Vondel’s play, Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (see under Benesch 0120 and Literature below) but considerable uncertainty remains about the identification. The costume differs from the others that are likewise often thought to represent the character of Badeloch (see Benesch 0317, 0318, 0319 and 0320). If of an actor, which seems probable, the model would have been male.\n\nThe attribution to Rembrandt seems more convincing than in the other cases enumerated above. Among the documentary drawings, there are links with the iron-gall ink drawings of c.1638-38 (cf. Benesch 0157, 0161 recto, and 0423 recto and verso), as well as with the study for the 1638 etching of Adam and Eve, especially in the handling of the wash (Benesch 0164). Compare also, for example, Benesch 0239, Benesch 0250, Benesch 0296 and Benesch 0314-15, which similarly combine clarity and subtlety of penmanship with lively yet delicate brushwork.\n\nCondition: Mediocre, with overall fading and discolouration of both the ink and the paper; small repaired tears top left and centre left edge; small nicks down right edge; an original horizontal paper crease across the bottom.\n\nSummary attribution: Rembrandt\n\nDate: c.1638?\n\nCOLLECTION: D Leipzig, Museum der bildenden Künste (L.1669; inv.

Yet the facial characterisation here is far more incisive, convincing and securely drawn, comparable to Benesch 0273 in this regard, and appears to suggest a male actor in female garb.[1]\n\nHowever, apart from the face, the drawing has many points in common with figure drawings that include drapery by Govert Flinck, such as Benesch 0069, 0119 and 0124. In the clothes, the line seems unusually even-tempered for Rembrandt as also somewhat hesitant or confused in the rendition of the details, not least the hands. For this reason the attribution to Flinck should be preferred to that to Rembrandt. But as noted elsewhere, the master and his pupils almost certainly drew such figures together and at the same time, and on this occasion the pupil succeeded in emulating his master more closely than usual.\n\nCondition: presumably trimmed from a larger sheet; some surface discolouration.\n\nSummary attribution: Govert Flinck?\n\nDate: c.1638\n\nCOLLECTION: CH, Geneva, Private Collection (Jean Bonna)\n\nFURTHER LITERATURE/REMARKS: Robinson, 1869, no.780; Gathorne-Hardy, 1902, no.98; Hofstede de Groot, 1906, no.981 (1635-40); Benesch, II, 1956/73, no.322, repr.

The somewhat loose modelling and the even pressure of the pen seem wholly characteristic of Flinck. The kneeling woman was probably intended for a biblical illustration from the Old Testament.\n\nThe drawing was originally mounted together with four other drawings when it entered the Louvre in 1796 (inventory numbers 22962A-D, which include Benesch 0268, 0269, 0333 and what is clearly a school work, Paris, 1933, no.1324).\n\nCondition:"
