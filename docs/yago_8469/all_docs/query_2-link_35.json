        "text": "The Cast of Private Practice Says Farewell After Six Seasons\n\nAfter six seasons, 111 episodes, a backdoor pilot and a revolving door of men, Private Practice will go off the air Tuesday at 10/9c on ABC with Addison finally getting her happy ending: She's getting married to someone she loves &mdash; and won't cheat on. (Sorry, Derek!) Private Practice's series finale to feature Addison's wedding Addison Forbes Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is set to wed Jake Reilly (Benjamin Bratt), and actually will make it down the aisle. There will be no last-minute change-ups, snafus or curveballs as executive producer Shonda Rhimes has liked to throw at Private fans over the years.

Addison then went out with a stranger from the supermarket, with whom she shared a kiss and was enticed by his offer to run away to Fiji. Ultimately, she stood him up at the airport and went back to Sam, still intent on having a child, even though he doesn't. What's Next? Addison is...\n\nVIDEO: Private Practice Star Calls Charlotte a Pistol, Says Playing Her Is Cathartic\n\nAlthough much of ABC's Private Practice is serious and somber, star KaDee Strickland says there are tons of levity to come on-screen &mdash; and that the cast has plenty of fun off-screen. \"The beauty of what Shonda [Rhimes] creates for us over at Private Practice is that for every terrible thing that happens, somehow we rise,\" Strickland says."
