I hope this is true because I was so in love with the script when I read it.\n\nwww.contactmusic.com/story/hugh-jackman-can-t-wait-to-get-back-in-the-saddle-for-western-adventure_3836492\n\nHugh Jackman - Hugh Jackman Can't Wait To Get Back In The Saddle For Western Adventure\n\nby WENN | 26 August 2013\n\nHugh Jackman has signed on to star in Madeleine Stowe's directorial debut because he's keen to saddle up and play an all-American cowboy.\n\nThe movie star studied horseback riding for his roles in Kate & Leopold and Australia but now he's planning to get serious for The Last of the Mohicans star's new project Unbound Captives.\n\nJackman will play a frontiersman who comes to the aid of a woman kidnapped by the Comanche Indians, who kill her husband. Rachel Weisz is in talks for the female lead in the film, which Stowe has also co-written with her husband Brian Benben.\n\nJackman tells Cowboys & Indians magazine that his 13-year-old son can't wait for filming to start: \"He knows all about this project and keeps asking me, 'When are we going to go and live with the American Indians?' He knows all the nuances - who the tribes are and where they lived. It's fascinating to me.\"\n\nAnd the actor admits he has a very personal reason to get back on a horse, adding, \"When you come to riding as an adult as I did... I really learned how to work with a horse in my 30s and was much more cautious than if I'd ridden as a boy or young man.\n\n\"But when you ride cutting horses every day for months, like I did in Australia, even falling off a few of them, I discovered that I genuinely loved being on a horse and now have to find a reason to get back out to the West and ride again.\"\n\nContactmusic\n\nAt first I thought it was an old story resurrected as we've seen before but the quotes are recent!\n\nSue\n\nPost by birchie on\n\nHere's the cover page for COWBOYS AND INDIANS --\n\nAs to the rumor about Unbound Captives -- I think what kept holding it up was the issue of funding ( which could also likely be related to the issue of Madeleine Stowe handling the directorial job). Maybe there is an update on the film being greenlighted?\n\nUp to when is Rachel committed on Broadway for BETRAYAL?\n\nDoes anyone still have a copy of the script?\n\nJo\n\nThat's a lovely picture of him! smiley-love067\n\nI have the script here: decided to take down the link and moved it to the private Special Treats area.\n\nSue\n\nPost by birchie on\n\nsmiley-signs101\n\nWill enjoy re-reading it, Sue!\n\nJo\n\nI'm going to read it again too! When I was a girl I was a huge fan of Western novels...probably read every Zane Grey novel I could get my hands on. Later on I loved Larry McMurtry. More recently I was obsessed with Tony Hillerman and read all of his books. They are more modern, mostly Navaho, stories and would be classified as detective stories rather than westerns. Probably why I liked them so well since they combined western motifs with mystery. Mystery, suspense, thriller novels are my favorite genre.\n\nI was wondering how did you get that cover picture? It's not even on their website www.cowboysindians.com/ Good detective work for you! <cool>\n\nI'm also very glad that RP is too old to play the son. I never thought he was right for it. There are several young up & coming actors that might be good so I'm anxious to see if they actually start casting for this soon.\n\nSue\n\nPost by Kelly on\n\nwww.contactmusic.com/story/hugh-jackman-can-t-wait-to-get-back-in-the-saddle-for-western-adventure_3836492\n\nHugh Jackman - Hugh Jackman Can't Wait To Get Back In The Saddle For Western Adventure\n\nby WENN | 26 August 2013\n\nI so hope this is true! Apparently being on the cover of Cowboys was the first clue that something was up. Assuming he will take the reins before Houdini? First Prisoners, now this...absolutely thrilled to see him break away from Wolverine for a while. A boost for his career.\n\nSpeaking of boost, ONO in LA isn't going to hurt. Does anyone have a single ticket available to purchase?\n\nPost by birchie on\n\nLOL - can't even trace back where I found it. I think I was trying to check out whether the \"update\" on Unbound Captives was actually a current story...and must have come across a link which fortunately had that photo image.\n\nHe does look good\n\nJo\n\nLooking at their website they're currently promoting the August issue and that cover photo that you found says October 2013 so I guess we'll see more on their site later...I guess they don't like to get ahead of themselves. All the more amazing that you got that picture Jo! smiley-happy096 <cheer>\n\nSue"
