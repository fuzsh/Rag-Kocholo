        "text": "Got a scoop request? An anonymous tip you’re dying to share? Just want to say hi? Send any/all of the above to askausiello@tvline.com\n\nQuestion: Any scoop on Grey’s Anatomy? Will the premiere pick up right where they left off (the doctors still stranded), or will they do a time jump? Will Meredith and Derek stay in Seattle? — Barbara\n\nAusiello: No clue, but we can tell you that Shonda Rhimes is staffing up in the wake of last season’s literal killing spree. Two of the new hires: Dr. Parker, a top-of-his-game physician in his 40s or 50s, and Dr. Mel Barnett, who’s slightly younger. Seattle Grace is also looking for two medical professionals, a man and a woman, who are “smart” and “not Hollywood handsome/pretty.” Finally, Mister Scooch has a shot!\n\nQuestion: Please send me any spoilers you have about Parenthood. —Margaret\n\nAusiello: The Braverman family will be down one member next season — sort of. With Haddie heading off to college, Sarah Ramos will no longer be a series regular. But she will be around, maintains exec producer Jason Katims. “I’m approaching it in a similar way as I did in Friday Night Lights,” he says. “When people graduated, we figured out a way to keep them around but also to make it realistic. She will be on the show this season, but she won’t be in every episode.”\n\nQuestion: Any chance we’ll see Victoria in the next Season of Revenge? Possibly alive? —Giovanni\n\nAusiello: Like there was any question about that! If you think they’d kill off Madeleine Stowe, I’ve got a lovely bridge I think would be perfect for you. Vicky’s very safe; in fact, I snuck a peek at the show’s Season 2 cast list (series regulars only), and all the principals will be back, including the aforementioned Stowe, Emily Van Camp (Emily), Henry Czerny (Conrad), Ashley Madekwe (Ashley), Nick Wechsler (Jack), Gabriel Mann (Nolan), Connor Paolo (Declan), Christa B. Allen (Charlotte) and Joshua Bowman (Daniel).\n\nQuestion: Any word on the casting of Emily’s mom on Revenge? —Kevin\n\nAusiello: No, but I can tell you about another new character: Hideo Kita, a brilliant and imposing Japanese business owner in his 40s or 50s. He’ll help Emily, but he’s got secrets of his own. Sounds a lot like Takeda, no? Could the addition of this Japanese/English bilingual guest star mean that Em’s mentor might not be as supportive of her this season as he has been in the past? Hit the comments with your thoughts on the matter!\n\nQuestion: I just checked the Comic-Con listing, and Darren Criss is still not listed. It was updated this afternoon. Any ideas why? I’m taking my daughter who is a huge fan and don’t want her disappointed. —Eric\n\nAusiello: No clue. But he’ll be there. Trust me! And TVLine will be there, too, covering all of the action and giving you all of the behind-the-scenes scoop you crave. From Thursday through Sunday, we’ll have complete coverage of all the panels, press rooms and parties. And TVLine’s interview suite — which has a few new bells and whistles this year (more on that Thursday) — will churn out exclusive video Q&As with your favorite actors and casts (see the video below for highlights from 2011).\n\nQuestion: I got into your Aushole party at Comic-Con! Woo-hoo! Will all guests be given one of those fancy t-shirts you mentioned? —Amy\n\nAusiello: Yes, every guest will get a shirt. And then you must wear it everyday throughout the Con — even if you start to smell. (Being a hard-core fan requires sacrifice, people.) I’ll have more details on the Ausome tee – including a first look and info on why it’s in your best interests to wear the thing as much as possible — tomorrow on Twitter. In related news, you must check out the winning entries in our Finale Photo Contest. Some stunning artistry there.\n\nQuestion: Help! I want to plan a trip up to Virginia so I can watch the Castle season premiere with my best friend, but they haven’t released the premiere date yet. And flights aren’t getting any cheaper. I know it’s probably going to be Sept. 17 or 24. Do you have any insider intel or maybe just a hunch as to what day it will be? —Savannah\n\nAusiello: First, this is Ask Ausiello, not Travelocity. That said, have you considered the particular joy of a nice, multiple-hour bus ride? You meet some of the cleanest, most well-adjusted people on interstate coaches. My suggestion: Set up a phone date with your pal. I’ll even give you a topic to discuss: the show’s two new characters — Senator Randall Stinson and Vice President Russell — who I’m guessing will figure into the conspiracy surrounding Beckett’s mother’s murder. Note their titles. Yep, this cover-up goes all the way to the top.\n\nQuestion: Any news on a premiere date for American Horror Story Season 2? —Jacob\n\nAusiello: All we know at this point is that it’s set for the fall and that the cast will be ginormous. In addition to the nearly dozen new roles that already have been cast, Ryan Murphy & Co. are also looking for Wendy, a lesbian hippie chick in her 30s; Abigail, a 1960s prostitute; Frank McGuire, an authoritative Bostonian and chief of security at a hospital (perhaps the one run by Jessica Lange’s nun?); Mother Superior Claudia, who’ll be Lange’s character’s boss; Father Malechi, an Irish priest; Morley Potter, a “salt of the earth” farmer; Barb and Lois, more lesbians; and Carl, a former military man who’s an orderly at the hospital.\n\nQuestion: Last week, you tweeted that the USA Network’s Political Animals premiere was even better than you thought it would be. Care to expand on that thought? I’m really intrigued – can’t wait to see it Sunday! – Amy\n\nAusiello: I can tell you that you won’t be disappointed, that Sigourney Weaver’s secretary of state character sleeps with someone you don’t expect her to, that all of the main characters are keeping some kind of secret and that I was pleasantly surprised by a reveal in the last few minutes of the episode. That should hold you for the rest of the week.\n\nQuestion: America’s Next Top Model is still my guilty pleasure, so how about some scoop? —Denise\n\nAusiello: I hear that the fashion destination for this upcoming all-star season, which kicks off August 24 (8/7c, The CW), is Jamaica. This just in: There’ll also be lots of crying, bitchery and smizing.\n\nQuestion: It’s maybe a little too early to ask this, but do you know whether vampire-Elena will be taking some kind of revenge on Rebekah for causing her death when The Vampire Diaries returns? —Gabriela\n\nAusiello: I’m going to assume Elena has her hands full completing her transition to vampire. One person who does have revenge on the brain is Damon, who blames poor Matt for Elena’s little predicament.\n\nQuestion: Any Hot in Cleveland scoop? —Jessica\n\nAusiello: Yep. The show’s looking for a big-ish guest star to play William, a guy in his 40s or 50s who’ll recur as a love interest for Valerie Bertinelli’s Melanie. I hear that William could be in as few as three or as many as 12 episodes in Season 4.\n\nQuestion: Can you pretty please give me any scoop on Suits? I must say that they have (hands down) the hottest two main characters on TV! —Melissa\n\nAusiello: How about this: At a funeral, we’ll meet a 20-something beauty who shares a long – like, back to childhood — history with Mike, and she shows up exactly when he really needs her. We hear if things work out, this character could be part of a recurring arc.\n\nQuestion: So excited my favorite actor (Patrick Wilson) will be on Girls next season. What else you got about Season 2? —Katie\n\nAusiello: Howzabout two new faces? Hannah and the ladies will be joined by Maggie, a young Manhattan urbanite editor with Midwestern roots, and Eladonna, a gun-carrying Staten Island teen who’s dating a small-time cocaine dealer 20 years her senior and whose family life is – to say the least – terribly complicated. Sounds like they’ll fit right in.\n\nQuestion: Any new news on Dexter’s upcoming season? —Pete\n\nAusiello: As if our favorite butcher didn’t already have enough on his plate, now he’s got to deal with Jason Price, an investigative author of books about murders. The charming Mr. Price will first appear in the sixth episode of the upcoming season.\n\nQuestion: Can you clear something up about White Collar? Previously you told us that Hilarie Burton would be in four episodes this season, but Matt Bomer now says three. Who is right? –Andie\n\nAusiello: I’ll defer to the other Matt — Mitovich — our resident expert in all things Hilarie Burton (restraining order notwithstanding), and he has it on “extremely good authority” that Hil is booked for a total of four episodes, two of which she has thus far shot."
