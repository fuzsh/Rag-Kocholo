        "text": "Another wonderful season full of twists. I know a lot of people ship Jen and Judy, and I do too, I wasn’t at first because this show was a perfect example of queerbating, but thanks to tumblr (my handle is movieskeepmealive), I now am. Even my dad ships them to be honest, in episode 4 when they get rid of the body and spend the night in that hotel, he said they should just get together already. In season two we learn that one of the girls is bisexual and is seeing a girl for three episodes. In the last episode when Jen forgives Judy and they hug, my dad threw ‘And they’re not a couple?’, which made me feel extremely proud. I definitely haven’t rated another show this high this season, it was perfect. I watched all episodes the minute they were released and then rewatched them again a couple days later with my family. Here are my notes and quotes I’ve written down during my marathon.\n\nDead to Me 2.01\n\nWe learn that Jen didn’t shoot Steve, she killed him with a wooden bird that belongs to her younger son. Noisy neighbor is still noisy and almost exposes Jen by accident. Jen is also seen cleaning up blood.\n\nJudy is back!\n\nIt killed itself.\n\nBut you do have somewhere to stay? You do have people?\n\nTotally.\n\nYou snuck up on me like a fucking Prius.\n\nI was fucking a grown man last night.\n\nWell, you don’t know how I fuck.\n\nYou should see the resolution on our street camera.\n\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\n\nThere’s something stuck in your drain.\n\nYour hair smells so good.\n\nHe can’t fucking hear you.\n\nDon’t fucking curse at me.\n\nDon’t ever tell a woman that she’s overreacting, because most of the time women are underreacting.\n\nIs Judy coming back?\n\nThey broke up again.\n\nSome of your crystals wouldn’t take the hint.\n\n10/10\n\nDead to Me 2.02\n\nSteve has a twin brother and at first I was very disappointed with the twin twist, but it grew on me. Body’s in the fridge.\n\nWho the fuck is Ben?\n\nAm I dead? Did I die?\n\nNobody’s dead.\n\nThat’s just my face. I have an upset face.\n\nSteve’s missing.\n\nHe calls his mom every day.\n\nI didn’t know you had other friends.\n\nThey’re semi-identical.\n\nThey’re the same fucking person!\n\nI’ve turned him in for money laundering.\n\nWherever you go, fucking chaos follows.\n\nYou think I’m gonna leave my kids to you?\n\nStay the fuck out of it.\n\nWhere did you get this?\n\nI truly can’t remember.\n\nMust be good shit then.\n\nI said I don’t fucking know I’ll be able to.\n\nI gained 10 pounds over summer.\n\nYou look beautiful.\n\nJudy’s got it.\n\n9.5/10\n\nDead to Me 2.03\n\nThere were already 6 rats underneath the fridge? I can’t lie, when Jen lost it and told her son and his creepy friend to get the fuck out, I thought this is exactly how I would be with my children if they annoyed me if I had children. Jen goes to the store and buys a lot of lye to dissolve rats in. As per her son’s creepy friend’s advice, girls decide to bury the body in a local forrest.\n\nNo need to Six Senth me into a heart attack.\n\nThey’ll Shawshank their teeth through everything.\n\nHe dumped you after 5 miscarriages.\n\nI never thought he would get angry enough to try to kill you.\n\nI teach a painting class.\n\nShe’s an art critic.\n\nThe Dark Web.\n\nHow to get rid of a dead body.\n\nHer heart will go on and on.\n\nI just need you to get the fuck out of here.\n\nOpen the freezer.\n\nI’m freaking the fuck out here!\n\nNothing was fine.\n\nI may have a new plan.\n\nI forgive you.\n\nYes, you’re really fucking scary.\n\n10/10\n\nDead to Me 2.04\n\nGirls learn that Karen’s husband is cheating on her with a man. I loved the scenes in the bar where the girls pretend to be related to the bride to get free drinks, get hit on, just so Jen can throw in the fantastic line about getting one more jig in before throwing themselves off the bridge and another one liner about singing Hallelujah! Judy did get to sing eventually when Jen’s son’s bird died, she ended up singinhg Dream a Little Dream of Me. Jen’s older son Charlie finds Steve’s car and thinks it’s his birthday gift.\n\nWe’re middle aged women in a Mercedes.\n\nWas it worth it? You commited a crime.\n\nWhat was so important you had to look at your phone?\n\nI just wanted to sing a song for Steve.\n\nI’m sorry if I got a little rigid at the fact that we couldn’t stop and sing Halle – Fucking – Lujah.\n\nWe’re not in fucking Snow White, we’re in Scarface.\n\nWhy don’t you go for a walk and say ‘fuck’ outside.\n\nThank you for mansplaining to me why you are the most affected by climate change.\n\nWill you be my person?\n\nThe bride is my second cousin.\n\nDoes it look like my friend wants to fucking dance?\n\nThose girls look like they want to kill themselves, maybe they wanna get a nice jig in before they jump off the bridge.\n\nHow have we not talked about Jeff?\n\nThose guys are joined at the dick.\n\nYou owe me 83 dollars.\n\nThe dog did it.\n\nSometimes people need a friend more than the truth.\n\nHoly shit, fuck yeah, Mom!\n\n10/10\n\nDead to Me 2.05\n\nJudy grabs some food with this girl that’s been hitting on her all season and re-adjusts her bra when the girl isn’t looking, which means she clearly likes her. Jen finds out her son found the car and to dispose of evidence sge decides to set it on fire.\n\nThere’s been an energetic shift.\n\nI hope so, cause momma needs a fucking break!\n\nDo you really need 8 bottles of wine?\n\nI’m sorry, are you the wine sheriff? Because I am the dick Police and you have the right to remain fucking silent!\n\nYou’re my fucking problem. I’m not paying for that.\n\nWhat were you thinking, you’re over 50.\n\nNo I’m not.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYour personality is offputting.\n\nMaybe later after my chiropractor leaves.\n\nI saw you on my steet cam.\n\nShut up, it’s not him, you don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re drunk.\n\nDid that loosen something up?\n\nNo one can ever know what happened.\n\nJust help me and get them out of here.\n\n8/10\n\nDead to Me 2.06\n\nJudy gives Charlie the sex talk. If they ever charge Judy with Steve’s murder, she has the perfect excuse, he threatened to kill her. We learn that Judy is in fact bi and her new girlfriend’s ex that lives with her is the cop who hates Judy.\n\nYou’re in so much fucking trouble.\n\nWhat were you doing sitting in a car for 5h? Oh God.\n\nYou just lost your bedroom door.\n\nHappy?\n\nFucking ecstatic.\n\nMother fuck…\n\nI lost my virginity in a car, it was wonderful.\n\n100 dollars.\n\nThat’s not a lot of money anymore.\n\nFuck you…\n\nWhat are you drawing?\n\nSeriously? It’s a check.\n\nWhat the fuck Judy? You fucking bitch! I know you see me calling bitch. I’m gonna fucking kill you. You’re fucking dead.\n\nYou like her.\n\nI do. She makes me feel really good.\n\nYou deserve that.\n\nProtect yourself and always get consent.\n\n10/10\n\nDead to Me 2.07\n\nJudy’s already in love with her new girlfiend. Jen volunteers herself and Judy to throw a vigil for Steve and we learn that they’ve cast Frances Conroy as Steve and Ben’s mom! Charlie attends the vigil and sees pictures of Steve in his car with his baseball cap on, the very same one his girlfriend wore in the pictures they took.\n\nI love you.\n\nOh Hell no.\n\nPushing your enormous head out of my vagina was a lot of work.\n\nI’m a middle aged woman in high heels with a bad back.\n\nIt’s a sweet gesture, if you didn’t kill the person the vigil is for.\n\nNah, fuck that.\n\nOf all the lesbians in Laguna.\n\nI cannot have you fucking her girlfriend on the other side of the wall.\n\nThat’s not the layout of the house.\n\nI’m sorry you had to do that.\n\nShitm I want to go missing.\n\nBetter taste in women.\n\nYou’d be surprised how often perpertrators show up to something like this.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jen and Judy.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nGod sees everything and sooner or later he’ll bring the truth to light.\n\nIf there’s silver lining in all this, it’s me and you.\n\n10/10\n\nDead To Me 2.08\n\nBen’s parents turn out to be crazy rich and are thinking of selling their mansion. Charlie’s first girlfriend vandalises their garage and then sends incriminating pictures to the police as a revenge on Charlie for dumping her. Judy wants to become a baby cuddler, but is told that the person has to have a clear Police record.\n\nWhy did you have Steve Wood’s car?\n\nPeople are a fucking mess.\n\nCrazier things have happened.\n\nLiterally they have not.\n\nI want you to have whatever you want.\n\nYou think an Arts and Crafts teacher is a better suspect than the Greek mafia?\n\nI’m gonna pretend you didn’t say Maid’s Chambers.\n\nFuck those girls, they don’t deserve you.\n\nScars show you went through something hard and you survived and it’s your story.\n\nJesus Christ, it won’t go away.\n\nI know what you did.\n\nI’ve wanted to do it all this time.\n\n10/10\n\nDead to Me 2.09\n\nKatey Segal aka Peggy Bundy, as in Christina Applegate’s mom from Married With Children plays Judy’s mom! In this episode Jen tells Judy the truth about Steve’s death and she doesn’t take it well. Judy wants to confess to the crime, but Jen ends up confessing herself. She leaves an ‘In Case of Emergency’ binder and writes three letters, to Judy and each of her sons.\n\nI got here and it was like I could finally exhale.\n\nI’ve waited my whole life to meet someone like you.\n\nOnce you go in, they make it almost impossible for you not to come back.\n\nYou were a kid, they shouldn’t have made you testify.\n\nIf I had a lawyer that didn’t get his degree at Costco.\n\nLast thing I needed was to be molested.\n\nYou’re my mother. Aren’t we supposed to look out for each other?\n\nI’m gonna take the blame for it.\n\nThe night Steve died, I was going to kill myself, but then you called me and you saved me. And maybe you saved me for a reason, so I could do this for you now.\n\nHe was walking away, he didn’t attack me. I attacked him.\n\nBut you said he was strangling you.\n\nI lied.\n\nWhat did he say to you?\n\nIt doesn’t matter.\n\nClearly it matters because you fucking killed him. What did he fucking say?!\n\nHe said he wanted to die because of me.\n\nI don’t hate you.\n\nYou’d stick around for anybody.\n\nI’m not like you.\n\nStop it. Just fucking stop it!\n\nThere’s something I need to confess.\n\n10/10\n\nDead To Me 2.10\n\nJen turns herself in and leaves the kids to Judy.\n\nI killed Steve Hale.\n\nAnd be their legal guardian.\n\nWe’re going back to the car, before our bodies are never found.\n\nShe’s the fucking angel on Earth.\n\nShe sees the good in people even when it isn’t there.\n\nI guess I thought I’d get what I deserved.\n\nThat will carry it’s way in the court room.\n\nShe was murdered. She was trying to protect me from my stepfather.\n\nBut you’re gonna go home and we’re never gonna talk about what we didn’t find here.\n\nSometimes justice works itself out.\n\nWe love you too.\n\nI don’t want to carry around any more pain. I’m tired of feeling sad and hurt. And resenting you would just be punishing myself.\n\nI’m glad you decided to come back.\n\nIt would help if you wrote a a letter to the parol office.\n\nNo. Because you haven’t changed.\n\nI can reframe it.\n\nI’m buying you out.\n\nAre you about to kill yourself?\n\nJen, wake up!\n\nWhat happened.\n\nWe got hit.\n\n10/10\n\nOverall rating: 9.75/10\n\nI think I liked this season more than the first one. Like I said, this show is fantastic and I really hope it is renewed for a third season!\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nJoanne\n\nModern Family has ended, more on the finale, below. I’ve got 4 days left until my holiday, which I’ll spend in my living room staring at the TV. I’ve had the watchlist ready for weeks. Yesterday I’ve started watching 911: Lone Star and my parents and I are hooked on it. It’s not as good as 911, but It’s interesting enough. I’m not a fan of Rob Lowe’s, but we did love Brothers and Sisters, and I did watch The Leftovers. Both 911 and 911 Texas have been renewed for new seasons. My dad and I watched the new season of Ozark two weeks ago, and honestly, I liked the 3rd season so much, it’s all I can think about. That and the Blackfish documentary I watched on Netflix 4 days ago. Ozark returned after over a year and a half, and I really hope there’s a 4th season. I’ll post much more often once my holiday starts, even though I do feel I’ve been consistent this year. I’m writing this post while watching Madhouse starring Vincent Price. I just love all these dark, gothic, Poesque horrors with Price. Once lockdown finished TV studios including Netflix will need to re-think their scheduling and prioritise TV shows. Dead to Me is back in 3 weeks, but Younger normally returns in June and The Handmaid’s Tale soon after. The Society hasn’t filmed much, but should be back in May too, and 13 Reasons Why is a summer show too. Not sure how much has been shot though, but all shows, including the Fall season ones could come back even 6 months late. Let’s say the lockdown is lifted in July, won’t actors complain that they haven’t had a proper holiday, even though they would have been off for 3 months at that point? We’ll see.\n\nGreys 16.19\n\nWe learn that Teddy is bisexual and the girl she was seeing and was in love with, died in one of the Twin Towers. We learn that Teddy named her daughter after her. I don’t know why they spend so much time on Maggie, we don’t want to know anything more about her. I’m just happy Richard is not leaving, after Karev’s disappointing exit, I’m not ready to get to know anyone new.\n\nDo you miss her?\n\nEvery day of every week of every year of my life.\n\nYou were the last person she was trying to call.\n\nYes, Alison loved me, but she also loved you.\n\n6/10\n\nSVU 21.17\n\nBallerinas are recorded having sex with male ballet dancers, and then they’re forced to sleeping with producers and choreographers. I really liked the Norma Rae reference coming from a millenial. It’s like the Riverdale references to 40s films no 17 year old would know of, like Gaslight. I guess I should just be happy I know them.\n\nHe would watch the videos like the girls were auditioning for him.\n\nHe pressured you, he extorted you, that’s rape.\n\nRape culture is such a big part of this company, they don’t see it anymore.\n\nThis isn’t just balet, churches, news organisations, movie sets, when your boss is a predator, people are afraid.\n\nYou want me to be the Norma Rae of the National Ballet?\n\nYou want this life, you pay the price.\n\n4/10\n\nModern Family 11.16\n\nMitchell, that was your last eye roll in this house.\n\nThese are the kids’ grandparents.\n\nMitch is struggling to say goodbye to the house.\n\nThat’s elder abuse!\n\nYou messed with the wrong Gamma.\n\n2.5/10\n\nModern Family 11.17/18\n\nI usually cry uncontrolably during series finales, and yet I didn’t get emotional once. All kids have moved out with Alex moving to Switzerland, Luke to Oregon for college and Mitch, Cam, Lily and the baby move to Missouri.\n\n5/10\n\nSchooled 2.18\n\nRick convinces Lanie to find her mother, who walked out on her and her dad 15 years prior, back when Lanie was a teenager.\n\nYou’re sure you’re right handed?\n\nMy shower is gonna look like the scene from Psycho, but Smurf.\n\nDid I just think of a perfect movie pitch?\n\nWow, 15 years.\n\nOh my god, I’m dating Barry Goldberg.\n\nNow I’m a music teacher at William Penn.\n\nRick Mellar, friend and co-worker.\n\n5 years sober.\n\n5/10\n\nThe Goldbergs 7.18\n\nIn that direction, pass the trees.\n\nWe’re not Hansel and Gretel.\n\nYou watch a lot of Lifetime movies, don’t you?\n\nHe slipped through the chimney like a turtleneck Santa.\n\n2/10\n\nThe Goldbergs 7.19\n\nBarry and Erika go on a Spring Break and Adam learns he doesn’t have the grades to get into NYU and we learn that the real Adam Goldberg got into NYU for submitting a great play he wrote.\n\nI just wanna make movies.\n\nYou were talking about film school since you were in kindergarten.\n\nWe’re gonna wow NYU so hard they’re gonna have to accept you.\n\nAdam, this play is incredible.\n\n4/10\n\nOne Day at a Time 4.01\n\nRay Romano guest stars, they should have done everything in their power to keep him. After getting cancelled by Netflix last year and being picked up by Pop, the writers throw a diss at Netflix in the very first minute of the season. The Everybody Loves Raymond reference made my day.\n\nIt’s like there’s nothing good on Netflix anymore.\n\nAt this point, I would rather be murdered.\n\nAnd now we know all the different ways in which I’m single.\n\nThere’s no box for happy.\n\nI’m all 3, do I win something?\n\nSo this must be your husband?\n\nGod no.\n\nOh yes, they taught us this, it’s nice to meet…You?\n\nI’m gay.\n\nRight now I don’t wanna be me.\n\nAnd Papito is single.\n\nRight, because he’s a child.\n\nPut down that my grandmother and I are just friends.\n\nPrivleged but woke.\n\nThey will all be saying ‘Everybody Loves Brian’.\n\nYeah, doesn’t sound right.\n\nA Lifetime movie. I just love watching rich people in trouble.\n\nShe didn’t give an F.\n\nStep one, start liking women.\n\nStep two, turn to your right.\n\nDiscuss.\n\nAll that stupid small talk. Where’d you go to high school, how many siblings do you have.\n\n9.5/10\n\nOne Day at a Time 4.02\n\nI didn’t like this episode one bit.\n\nI speak Spanish.\n\nI’m young.\n\n1.5/10\n\nOne Day at A Time 4.03\n\nThat’s better. Penelope and abuelita argue over female masturbation, after Penelope’s son walks in on her and her toy.\n\n4/10\n\nThis year I’ve given up a few shows. I was struggling to find time to watch them, I wasn’t head over heels about the characters, so I’ve made an executive decision to cut down my loses. Shows I followed last year, but don’t anymore: The Rookie, Seal Team, The Good Doctor and Mr. Mercedes.\n\nTo see my review of 2018, click on the following link: https://joanneholly.com/2018/12/30/tv-shows-of-2018/\n\nLast year I followed 41 shows, this year, 50.\n\nBelow are the 50 TV shows I followed this year:\n\n1. Grey’s Anatomy\n\nI am still sad about Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew being written off. I have mixed feelings about the show allegedly ending after season 17. Greys hasn’t been ‘Greys good’ since Season 9 and yet it’s still my favourite and it will always stay that way. Season 16 so far focuses on the crime Meredith commited last season, the insurance fraud. It’s quite surprising how this storyline mirrors the Varsity Blues scandal. Mer has done a lot of community hours and has spent a night in jail. From the looks of the midseason finale, that’s all behind us now. They have sent Betty away at the end of season 15 and she hasn’t been back to visit since. I am glad Teddy is back and I hope she never leaves. Avery is slowly becoming the most annoying character, changing his mind when it comes to relationships. Still no development on Helm and her crush on Meredith, we’ll see where they go with this. Is Helm going to be with Karina by the end of the season? I am not a fan of splitting the staff between Grey Sloan and the second hospital, but I’m guessing Grey Sloan will buy the new undeveloped one and then merge the two?\n\n2. SVU\n\nSeason 21 and we’re making history! I just love this show. Carissi is now an ADA, and we have a new detective I’m not fond off. Fall season ended on a cliffhanger featuring Amanda and I can’t wait to see what happens next.\n\n3. Shameless\n\nShameless started quite late this year, and without Emmy Rossum. Ian is back and the show is still the same, and still as exciting as ever. I’m really disappointed with how Debbie is spending the 50 grand she got from Fiona and how Frank messed it all up for her. I really thought she would ensure the money lasts them a year or two. I’m happy with how the rest of the Gallagher’s lifes are going, including the fact that Lip is now a dad!\n\n4. Fuller House\n\nI’m sad it’s the show’s last season. The nostalgia Fuller House brought in 2014, was something I never thought I needed. 2019 wasn’t a good year for this Full House fan. If I wasn’t a Full House fan, I wouldn’t be going through a heartbreak this year. Aunt Becky was why I got so invested in the show. Season 1 wasn’t really a family show, the three main characters kept sleeping around and other than two or three episodes, the show was boring. From the minute Aunt Becky showed up, the show got interesting. Years later, as a teenager, I watched The New Kids, and became a Lori Loughlin fan and followed every single one of her projects.\n\n5. Carol’s Second Act\n\nPatricia Heaton is back on my TV screen, so everything’s going to be okay. I miss The Middle, and I think my mum misses it even more. It also stars Twin Peak’s Kyle MacLachlan. Carol’s Second Act is a sitcom, and even though it’s nowhere near as good as The Middle, or Everybody Loves Raymond, it’s still a funny show and a great way to spend the 20 minutes a week.\n\n6. American Horror Story\n\nSarah Paulson wasn’t back for this awful season, at least she’s shooting another two Ryan Murphy shows, Ratched and season 3 of American Crime Story, so at least there’s something to look out for. American Horror Story used to be one of my favourite shows, but sadly this season is extremely weak, everyone was dead by episode 5 and everyone was a ghost by episode 5 as well! I liked the aerobic sequences in the very first episode. I really thought it would be a Friday the 13th type of slasher like the promos suggested.\n\n7. Crikey it’s the Irwins\n\nThis show is a delight! Nothing will stop me from revisiting Australia Zoo every time I go to Australia on a holiday. As a vegan of 9 years, I should stand against all zoos, but this series proves all the good zoos do for animal conservation. Even though guests visit, Australia Zoo is really a giant sanctuary. In the second season the Irwins are preparing for Australia Zoo’s 50th anniversary, by renovating the croc enclousure. In order to get the contractors in, they need to move all the crocs, including the biggest and the most aggressive crocs in the zoo. A beloved zebra from season 1 needs to be put down, and Terri goes back to her hometown Oregon to visit a wildlife sanctuary were her cougar Malina spent her final years. Bindi gets engaged and I just hope they show us the wedding when the show comes back for season 3. I also wish there were more episodes in the season.\n\n8. Orange is the New Black\n\nIt ended and there will never be a show so raw and brilliant. I cannot even begin to explain what an important place this show has in my heart. Every time I hear someone say they don’t like the show because it mainly has women in it or when they say they’re not going to watch the show because of all the gay characters, I feel personally offended. I am still tearing up thinking of Dockett’s tragic end. I also hate what they’ve done to Red, Lorna and Maritza. Some pars of the ending made me happy though, for example the fact that Alex is back with her crew. I still wish they had shown us more of Big Boo and other original characters.\n\n9. When Calls the Heart\n\nI will never get over the fact that Abigail is not coming back. And Cody, the Culkin lookalike was taken off the show because of the Lori Loughlin scandal too. I will keep watching as long as Rosemary is there. I’ve watched 2 episodes of When the Heart Calls, the web series spin off about the orphanage a few towns from Hope Valley, but I didn’t like it at all. I’ve gotten used to the two new male characters. I doubt Netflix will add the new season to its selection, as they’ve always done it around October time.\n\n10. Station 19\n\nSeason two was alright, but season 3 was delayed until 2020. The show’s creator left to pursue something else, which is quite odd as she’s only done 2 seasons, so from next year the show will be ran by Krista Vernoff who has been running Grey’s Anatomy, after Shonda Rhimes’s departure. One of the characters is now a quest star on Greys.\n\n11. The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nI even got my mom into this show! And Christopher Meloni was in 2 or 3 episodes, playing a role completely opposite from his SVU’s Elliott Stabler, a rapist! Alexis Bledel’s character got a satisfying ending, and the scene where Canadian border police officers ask her whether she’s going to be in danger if she was to be sent back to her country and she says yes, this is simply my favourite scene of the entire 2019.\n\n12. One Day At a Time\n\nAfter a quite boring season 3, and Netflix’s cancellation, the show was saved by POP and will be returning in 2020! I am still not a fan of the annoying girlfriend, but everything this shows says about immigration, PTSD and LGTBQ issues is on point.\n\n13. The Insatiable\n\nSeason 2 differed from season 1 in the most important way, it focused on the main character, Patty’s binge eating disorder. Patty joins Overeaters Anonymous and learns the cause of her addiction to food. Yes, it’s still crazy when it comes to her psychotic behaviour resulting in murdering people, but most of the season is about her BED, and that makes it interesting.\n\n14. The Unbelievable\n\nA TV show about a girl who thinks she’s been raped, comes forward, and then revokes her statement, 5 times. Then two lady cops try to solve a series of rapes and eventually come across the main character’s statement. Netflix’s best show of 2019, it’s just amazing and Short Term 12 and Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever delivers a beautiful performance.\n\n15. Big Little Lies\n\nThe show came back after 2 years, to finish what it started, it was better than season 1 because we didn’t have to sit through hours of sex and abuse.\n\n16. Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath\n\nThis show was a hit for me. I’ve only learned about it in February, and watched all 3 seasons in two weeks. I’ve since read Leah Remini’s book ‘Troublemaker’. I am really sad to see this show go, it’s extremely informative and brings hope to victims of Scientology. It’s my favourite discovery of 2019.\n\n17. The Goldbergs\n\nIt’s still good, but it feels like they have run out of nostalgic 80s memorbilia last season.\n\n18. Schooled\n\nLanie’s spin off is now in its second season. It’s not as good as The Goldbergs, but It’s only 20 minutes a week, which makes it watchable. AJ and Aly Michalka released a single last summer, that was undoubtedly my song of summer 2019. It’s called Church and it’s amazing.\n\n19. How to Get Away with Murder\n\nThank goodness it’s the last season. The first 3 seasons were great, but anything from season 4 has been bad. Someone’s killed Annalise? What was the point of the series then?\n\n20.Killing Eve\n\nI still haven’t caught up with season 2 fully, but I’ve been a fan of Jodie Colmer since ‘Thirteen’.\n\n21. Ozark\n\nMy dad’s favourite show. Julia Garner is killing it every single episode. Where’s season 3?\n\n22. Good Girls\n\nBeth and the dealer hooked up, and Season 2 was quite different, but still entertaining.\n\n23. Thirteen Reasons Why\n\nI loved the first 2 seasons, but this was a mess. Why introduce a new character, and give them ALL screen time?\n\n24. This is Us\n\n3 more seasons yes please! I am just not okay with the writers telling us about Rebecca’s death so early in the series.\n\n25. 911\n\nNever disappoints with the drama, I mean the freaking tsunami blew my mind!\n\n26. The Resident\n\nI think I am okay with whom they killed off in the first episode, but this season introduced us to a new doctor that’s an even more arrogant copy of the new doctor they introduced last season.\n\n27. Modern Family\n\nFinal season is here and it’s just as mediocre as everything else after season 3.\n\n28. For the People\n\nSadly this Shondaland show starring Britt Robertson has been cancelled. I feel like I was the only one watching it.\n\n29. Chernobyl\n\nA mini docuseries from HBO everyone loves, and rightfully so.\n\n30. Riverdale\n\nI’m just not into it anymore. I liked season 1 and that’s it. I liked the Luke Perry tribute, but I haven’t had the time to watch all of it.\n\n31. The Simpsons\n\nAwesome as always. Sixty seasons should be enough for me.\n\n32. The Good Fight\n\nI still haven’t caught up.\n\n33. The Good Place\n\nThey keep resetting the afterlife and it’s all the same at this point.\n\n34. Veronica Mars\n\nI’m just happy they didn’t kill Keith Mars, and I like the noir aspects of this season.\n\n35. Absentia\n\nI still haven’t fully caught up, I will update once I do.\n\n36. F For Family\n\nIt’s a funny show and I cannot wait for season 4. I wish the main character still worked at the airport, all this vending machine business wasn’t very entertaining.\n\n37. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n\nI like it when it’s darker, but I just cannot stand Kiernan’s wig.\n\n38. Divorce\n\nThe Sarah Jessica Parker show has ended and the ending surprised me. I will miss the dark humour.\n\n39. Younger\n\nThe secret is out, Liza’s secret was exposed and she no longer has to hide. I’m a fan of Liza and Charles, but this wasn’t a good season. Kelsey makes a dumb social media mistake and gets demoted from publisher back to editor. Diana gets married. The Irish girlfriend’s baby storyline doesn’t give immigrants a good rep.\n\n40. When They See Us\n\nI watched it for Vera Farmiga and I knew about this case from Law and Order: Special Vicitms Unit.\n\n41. Looking For Alaska\n\nI used to know this girl who was obssesed with this book and always said Looking For Alaska is John Green’s best work. I haven’t read the book, so I can just rate the story for what the show is. As a child of immigrants, who don’t speak the language, I related to one of the characters. Sometimes the pressure of your family’s livelihood depending on you is too much. I know it’s got to me a few times when I had to figure out what to do in stressful situations I wouldn’t have been in had i known my family was safe and happy among their own. Acting as a translator for your family can have damaging effects on you, when your family’s health andlivelihood is at stake.\n\n42. Dead to Me\n\n‘Married With Children’ ‘s Christina Applegate and ‘Freaks and Geek’s Linda Cardelini return to TV in this dramedy about a woman who befriends her hit and run victim’s wife. Great acting from both, I’m really sad Linda didn’t get a Golden Globe nomination for her prformance.\n\n43. Soundtrack\n\nMadeleine Stowe is back! I remember when she retired back in the early 2000s and I kept checking up on her non existent projects while she was retired on her Texas ranch. Thankfully she returned to acting and starred in Revenge, portraying one of the best characters on television. When Revenge ended in 2015 I thought, well that’s it, she’s gonna go back to her retirement, but she didn’t! She just took a 4 year break and now she’s back! It looks like Madeleine’s husband, Dream On and Private Practice’s Brian Benben is currently on a break himself. Anyway, I’m a huge fan, and could talk about Madeleine’s filmography for hours.\n\nSoundtrack, originally called Mixtape, is a new Netflix show about stars Madeleine Stowe, Jenna Dewan (is this why she left The Resident?) and Gradfathered’s Christina Millian.\n\nThe pilot episode has a depressing ‘This is Us’ twist. Jenna Dewan’s character’s name is Joanna (heck yes!) and she’s a dancer. Above I mention how watching season 2 of The Resident made me think of Step Up every single episode. To see Jenna’s character’s dance audition sequence to a Kelly Clarkson song of all artists, satisfied my 2006 Step Up obsession, and she dances in this show, a lot. The show features a lot of cool mash ups, and includes songs from Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Duffy, Demi Lovato to so many different genres and I will be rewatching the dance sequences a lot. I was really looking forward to seeing Marcia Cross when I noticed this title was added to her filmography on IMDB, but she only lends her voice to a character that’s a supporting’s character’s mother and only has one short conversation with that character, over the phone.\n\nThere’s going to be a similar show starting next month, called Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist starring Jane Levy and Lauren Graham, that I just cannot wait to start watching.\n\n‘Every song is a love song’.\n\n‘This is breathtaking, why would you ever give this up?’\n\n44. The Politician\n\nYou know I’ll watch anything from the Murphy/Falchuk duo. It’s an average show, my least favourite from them, even lower on my list than Scream Queens. I don’t like how they used a porodied version of Gypsy Blanchard’s story in the show. We’ve seen in in The Act this year and The Act is not only an incredible mini series, but it’s also respectful and true to the story. The Politician’s secret weapon is, same as with American Horror Story, the marvelous Jessica Lange, so you know I’m gonna watch it. Speaking of the Murphy/Falchuk universe, I cannot believe we need to wait until September 2020 for American Crime Story to return.\n\n45. The Act\n\nA beautiful mini series about the tragic Gypsy Blanchard story with incredible performances from Joey King and Patricia Arquette. It’s my second favourite mini series of the year and eagerly waited for next episode every week.\n\n46. The Morning Show\n\nThis Apple show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston focuses on a made up news show, and the behind the scenes sexual harassment. It’s clearly inspired by the Fox scandal, but it’s different from The Loudest Voice. In the last episode Jennifer’s character loses it and exposes everything, it’s a superb episode I’m happy there’s going to be season 2.\n\n47. The Society\n\nA modern Lord of the Flies meets Lost. I enjoyed this show the minute Kathryn Newton’s character executed one of the other characters.\n\n48. Light as a Feather\n\nI have been following Liana Liberato’s career since ‘Trust’. It’s not a good series, but it’s eight 20 minute episodes, and there are worse ways to spend your weekend.\n\n49. Grace and Frankie\n\nA brilliant show from the creators of Friends. I’ve been watching it since it came out back in 2016 and can’t get enough of it! Can’t wait for January when the show’s back!\n\n50. The Loudest Voice\n\nNo way Bombshell is going to be half this good. Best friends Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts ended up playing the same character this year, Gretchen Carlson. Showtime’s The Loudest Voice is a 7 episode series about the Fox News sexual harassment.\n\nShows I need to catch up on (to some extent):\n\nHow to Get Away With Murder\n\nKilling Eve\n\nThis is Us\n\nRiverdale\n\nAbsentia\n\nThe Good Fight\n\nGentleman Jack\n\nI Am the Night\n\nI think Hollywood Darlings has been cancelled? There’s no news online, but there were no episodes released this year and Jodie Sweetin is now doing this podcast I don’t listen to.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post. One of my resolutions for 2020 is to go back to reviewing TV shows on a weekly basis, because I’ve caught myself a few times trying to remember the episode something happened in and had to google it every time. Had I stuck to reviewing episodes week by week, I would have quickly looked it up here.\n\nHave a wonderful 2020!\n\nJo"
