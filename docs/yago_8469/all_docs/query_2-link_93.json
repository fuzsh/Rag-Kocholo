        "text": "(ran GB edition)\n\nIn fact, her 3-year-old daughter, May, brought the actor a new perspective on life. A booming film career fell into line behind new priorities, and Stowe even pulled out of a lifelong shyness.\n\nActor Madeleine Stowe was agonizingly shy in high school.\n\n\"My adolescence was a nightmare,\" she says, rolling her olive-black eyes and perching on the edge of a muted green club chair.\n\n\"I had no idea how to communicate with the girls at all. I never learned how to be a \"girls' girl.' I felt very uninteresting in anything I had to say to them. I was opinionated and being shy and being opinionated is a really bad quality.\"\n\nIt has just been recently, since she had her daughter, May (who was 3 at the end of June), that Stowe has been able to overcome her timidity.\n\nShe remembers with embarrassment, \"I was a junior-varsity yell leader only because four girls ran and three got on the squad. And the fourth girl was so heavy-set so she was belittled by it. I would go out there _ the other girls would show up when the varsity team would start to show up _ and I was out there alone giving the cheers. It was so mortifying. That was about the most mainstream thing I did in high school,\" she laughs.\n\nThose who've enjoyed the 40-year-old beauty in movies such as The Last of the Mohicans, The Proposition and Unlawful Entry may be surprised by her latest, The General's Daughter.\n\nShe plays a no-nonsense criminal investigator allied with an old flame (John Travolta) in trying to solve a particularly heinous murder.\n\nStowe, who's married to actor-comedian Brian Benben (TV's Dream On), says she started to change when her daughter was born.\n\n\"When I had my child, at first I didn't know how to talk to her the way I thought would be interesting. I felt myself being censored. And afterward you sort of let go of all that, and it's okay.\"\n\nThough Stowe's career had been cruising in overdrive, and she'd just finished 12 Monkeys with Bruce Willis, she felt uneasy.\n\n\"There was something just not altogether right in my life,\" she says. \"I felt I'd been going from one movie to another. I thought, \"How long can I keep doing this?' And my husband and I decided to have a child.\"\n\nAfterward, she figured she could pick things up where she left off.\n\n\"I'd done a film when she was just 3 months old, and they were very nice people and everything, but it was a terrible mistake because it was really time I should've spent with her _ although she was with me all the time, she came on set. I didn't have the energy nor the heart for it for a long time.\n\n\"Basically, I think a lot of my drive completely diminished and my focus was really so on May.\"\n\nTo be successful in films you must maintain that burning zeal, Stowe believes.\n\n\"I have moments when I have sporadic feelings of strong ambition, but they're not every day. They might be a couple of times a week,\" she laughs, a deep hearty laugh. \"That's about the extent of it.\"\n\nWhen she met Benben, he was able to overcome her innate reticence with his outrageous antics. \"He's a wild man,\" she smiles, dimples digging into her cheeks.\n\n\"I was totally turned on to that because I was this little mouse, and I couldn't understand why somebody this vibrant would pay any attention to me. He was constantly doing things to get my attention, and that's the most flattering thing in the world.\"\n\nHe was not only insistent, he was inventive.\n\n\"He would try anything. He told me that he was one of the Carnegie family at first, which didn't do anything for me but he thought it did. It was the way he had of teasing all the time. When I'd come around the corner he'd jump out and grab me; frighten me all the time. He's very puckish.\"\n\nStowe, the oldest of three, never intended to be an actor. Most of her life her father suffered from multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's. And she was often her mother's helper.\n\nShe loved to watch movies and adored playing the piano, but when she was discovered by a well-known Hollywood agent she had no design on show business.\n\n\"I never consciously said it, but I loved film so much I thought about filmmaking or film criticism. I was going back and forth between them. Then I got discovered. It was out of the blue.\"\n\nShe and Benben live on a ranch in the hill country of Texas. It was her idea to move to the wide-open spaces, where they raise horses, cattle, hay, oats and fruit. \"It's so easy to be in this profession and just go, go, go,\" she shrugs. \"And go to all the meetings and all the things you're supposed to go to _ ultimately that's what the change was when I had my child _ that's not enough.\"\n\nWhile Benben sports a keen sense of humor, she claims she has none. She tends to be untidy and so does he. She says she has no idea what makes marriage work.\n\n\"I think it's something that doesn't bear analysis. I think not looking at it, not scrutinizing it is important. There's just not a person in the world I'd rather spend time with. I love being in his presence. We fight like cats and dogs . . . but we work it out.\""
