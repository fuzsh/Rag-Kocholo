        "text": "The relationship and compatibility of Leo and Gemini.\n\nSummary[]\n\nLeo and Gemini are compatible. A good-natured relationship, based on happiness, optimism, humor and entertainment, a genuine warmth and closeliness is in between Leo and Gemini; both signs' nature is Yang and a taste for entertainment and dramatism.\n\nBoth are social signs, producing a fruitful relationship that is surrounded by many friends and contacts of mutual benefit. Leo and Gemini compatibility means that both partners share similar ambitions. What makes these signs so compatible is that the two are linked by sufficient similarities to allow them to function harmoniously together, yet at the same time there are enough differences to provide an alternative perspective and create that all important spark of excitement.\n\nLeo, the mythological Royal, wants and needs to be adored. Fortunately, Gemini, the archetypal Communicator, excels at flattery and can make Leo feel like the most special person on the planet. Leo reciprocates, being enchanted by Gemini’s wit and energy – the perfect audience a Gemini have. It’s certainly a relationship of high spirits and boundless energy.\n\nThis is a fire/air combination and these elements normally mix well. As fire needs air to burn, so Leo needs Gemini’s attention and mental energy in order to flourish.\n\nThere are not relationships without problems. There will undoubtedly be times when the Leo is frustrated by the Gemini’s characteristic changeability and unwillingness to make a firm commitment. Or when Leo's stubbornness, rigidity and distaste for too much ‘intellectual’ activity leaves Gemini feeling short-changed. But in the grand order of things, these are minor compatibility challenges which shouldn’t detract from the ability of these two signs to get along well in a love relationship.\n\nRelationships []"
