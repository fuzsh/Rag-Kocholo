        "text": "Whatever Madeleine Stowe's secret is, it's clearly working. In the flesh, she is without a doubt the most beautiful 50-something woman I have ever seen. The skin is as smooth as porcelain, the hair long, glossy and thick. All combined, the effect is breath-taking.\n\nShe's a lady of such gentle manners, that it would seem abrasive to demand outright to know exactly how she does it. She's said before she thinks plastic surgery is fine, so perhaps it's that. But she doesn't look remotely stretched or puffed up by fillers, just still blooming, still sensual, a woman in her prime decades after she first hit movie screens.\n\n\"I'm rather shy, socially, as everyone knows,\" Stowe protests when she first appears, fashionably late, in front of a gaggle of journalists at a press day in a London hotel. But then despite this declared reserve, she insists on giving extra time in our interview. \"I'm cool, whatever Julia needs,\" she says, contradicting the PR who breaks in to wrap things up.\n\nIt's hard not to be won over by this graciousness. There's something old-fashioned about Stowe's considered gentility. It's a contrast too, to her current on-screen character.\n\nHer rendering of the viperous Victoria Grayson, the matriarchal character in the American drama series Revenge is so ice-cool that it's earned her an Golden Globe nomination and sprung her into people's hearts as TV's newest shrew in a little black dress.\n\n\"I've been so surprised at the affection people have in terms of how they love to hate her,\" she says. \"I really just thought I would hate her. I think it has to do with the fact that we all have these areas that we'd love to act out, but many of us are more civilised than that. And she's not, she has the patina of being very civilised while being a complete animal.\"\n\nRevenge, for the uninitiated is a super-glossy, soapy drama currently rolling out on RTE2. It's concerned with the adventures of central character Emily (played by Emily Vancamp) who plots to bring down prominent Hamptons family the Graysons as revenge for their part in the destruction of her own childhood happiness.\n\nIt's all good fun, diverting entertainment; rich people behaving badly sort of stuff, but Stowe insists it resonates on a deeper level too.\n\n\"The show is playing right now to that idea of the 'one per centers', and a kind of collective anger and rage that the rest of the population has -- they feel taken advantage of. People are unsettled and fearful, so they are vicariously watching this hyper-real world and I think identifying and wanting to see them get their comeuppance.\"\n\nWhether Victoria Grayson will get her comeuppance remains to be seen, but at the moment, she represents for Madeleine a rare professional renaissance at a tricky stage in her career. But Madeleine being who she is, she seems to feel conflicted about it. \"Acting is a very vainglorious pursuit. That's how I feel about it\" she says.\n\n\"I've never been one to go out publicly a whole lot. I haven't altered the way I live so much. I have to tell you, the awareness of what's buzzing around you is there. But it's important for me not to delve too much in it or read about it. I think it's important, if you are going to stay on track in any way, to stay as removed from that as possible.\n\n\"It's nice to have a minimal amount of awareness and to be glad when people enjoy what you are doing, because that is gratifying and that is why we're here, but to take on all the other stuff, it becomes a very unhealthy parade I think.\"\n\nShe's grateful that she got her start when she did, relatively late, at the age of 29, in Stakeout, rather than having to make her way as a Hollywood ingenue today.\n\n\"It's so odd because when I came up, you weren't expected to really have a career until you were 29 or 30. You could develop as a human being. The 20s are a very odd time -- they're not the best time in life, the 30s are an incredible time. Now I think the pressure is on, and things have become so youth-oriented that if someone is not doing well by 21 or 22 they feel as if they are a failure.\n\n\"Unless you take time away, your whole life experience is going to be based upon what you've done in front of the camera. And to form yourself that way, there are perils that come with it.\"\n\nShe made a conscious decision not to define herself by what she had done in front of the camera. At the peak of her career, having become a leading lady through her most prominent role opposite Daniel Day Lewis in Last of the Mohicans and clocking up a string of hits including critically acclaimed performances in Shortcuts and Twelve Monkeys, she decided out of the blue to jack it all in.\n\nPregnant with her first child, she quit Hollywood and went to live on a ranch in Texas. She has a taste for the remote, which perhaps explains her affection for Ireland. \"It's just about my favourite place on earth,\" she says. \"Oh, I love Ireland so much.\n\n\"When I made the decision to have my daughter, I had been going at a very steady clip, and pretty much what I thought about was work and my relationship with my husband. (She's married to actor/writer Brian Benben.) But when I had my daughter there was an entire sea-shift for me, and every decision was predicated on \"how does this affect her life?'\"\n\nEven though her daughter is a teenager now, she still feels some lingering ambivalence at being back under the spotlight. Despite her efforts to keep the industry at arms length, and the fresh acclaim she's won from her work, she struggles to feel satisfied. Instead, she finds distance from the \"unhealthy parade\" by getting stuck into projects that bring her a sense of a deeper kind of meaning.\n\nShe's been actively involved in lobbying and field work in Haiti since long before the 2010 earthquake struck, having been introduced to the work of a visionary doctor/priest Father Richard Frechette there, by the filmmaker Paul Haggis.\n\nRecently, she's also been campaigning to preserve women's reproductive rights in America.\n\n\"I was just having a long email exchange with a friend,\" she remembers, when we touch on her natural inclination towards self-questioning and doubt in her vocation.\n\n\"I was going through a really empty period, and feeling as if I didn't have enough to offer as a human being in this life, and I felt very unaccomplished, very unhappy in a sense with what I've achieved,\" she says.\n\n\"Without being pretentious, because I don't mean to be pretentious, but you always think about what you bring into the world, right? And I look at the accomplishments of others, (of Father Rick) who moves mountains in Haiti and I look at that and I just feel that this isn't it. I love this business, but this isn't it.\n\n\"My friend wrote back, the fact that a person questions brings to the work a kind of layer and texture. And I don't know that I have that. He was really trying to make me feel better, but I hope that if I challenge myself in that way and have these enormous doubts, I hope that somewhere it filters through on the screen.\"\n\nMadeleine, who is of Costa Rican descent, grew up in a working class neighbourhood in Los Angeles and almost became a concert pianist. She was a shy and solitary child, raised mostly by her mother, as her father was chronically debilitated by multiple sclerosis. Her piano teacher became something of a surrogate father figure to her. \"I had an extraordinary teacher who was a bit of a legend. I don't know why he took me on, but he did. Because I really don't feel I was that good. I didn't really have a father, even though he lived in the house.\"\n\nWhen her teacher died, she quit. \"I had banned it at 18, completely, never touched the piano again,\" she says, when I ask her if she ever plays now.\n\nA few years ago, however, something led her \"on this hunt for a piano that would replicate as closely as possible the sound that he was trying to get me to produce. It was a kind of clarity and resonance. And I found the piano, Italian-made; at the time, I think they only crafted 80 pianos a year. And it was wonderful.\"\n\nBut the experience of reconnecting with her past threatened to become an unhealthy obsession.\n\n\"I sat down to play and I noticed something happening, I started to think in obsessive rhythms. I was driven to repeat things until I could try to get them to where I was happy with it, it was almost like going over a loop in my head. And that would carry on outside of the playing, and so I had to stop. It was a really interesting connection that I made to the music and a particular period of difficulty early on. And I had to stop. If I can come to it in a way where I can stop those feelings from happening, it would be wonderful and very releasing. But I haven't touched it again.\"\n\nNow, she brings that early lesson in discipline and commitment to her work as an actress, leaving the piano-playing to her daughter, who is teaching herself.\n\nFor the attendant pressures and strains, there are earthly consolations. \"I like a bourbon now and then after work,\" she jokes, before adding more seriously, \"but I can't, you have to be disciplined. It's an endless cycle. It's a wonderful occupation, you are paid very well, but it's 14-16 hours a day, and when you are a woman there are attendant pressures.\n\n\"They want you to look good and they want you to physically be in shape. And you want to be, too. We're shooting on high definition, which is very brutal on actresses. So that's as much as a strain as anything else, because you can't entirely free yourself to the performance that easily.\n\n\"But,\" she concludes with a wry smile, \"all is vanity, right?\"\n\nRevenge continues on RTE2, Tuesdays at 9pm"
