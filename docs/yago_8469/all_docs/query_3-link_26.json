        "text": "Bio:\n\nMadeleine Stowe (born Madeleine Marie Stowe Mora in Los Angeles, CA on August 18, 1958) is an American actress most famous for her role as Victoria Grayson in the hit ABC show Revenge. Madeleine has amassed over 40 television and film credits throughout her career. Her big break came in 1987, when she was cast in the film Stakeout. Madeleine has gone on to make a lasting mark in Hollywood, and has been cast in such projects as The Last of the Mohicans and Blink\n\nBest Known For:\n\nMadeleine is best known for her role as the vindictive and manipulative Victoria Grayson in the show Revenge, which lasted for four seasons on ABC.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nShe has been married to husband, and fellow actor, Brian Benben since 1982. The couple has one daughter together named May Theodora, and the family currently resides in Texas. The couple also owns a cattle ranch together. Madeleine also helped found Artists For Peace and Justice.\n\nEmily was desperate to find her mother, Kara Clarke, this week — and no one was going to stand in her way!\n\nBecause Victoria (Madeleine Stowe) was the only person who knew Kara’s whereabouts, Emily (Emily VanCamp) sent Amanda (Margarita Levieva) on a mission to uncover more information on the Oct. 21 episode of Revenge. In exchange for David Clarke’s journal, Amanda — with Emily in her ear, as usual — demanded that Victoria give her details about Emily’s mother. Little did Victoria know, Emily wrote in the journal herself, hoping her entires would would make Victoria crack.\n\nGeez, is anyone faithful on TV anymore? I guess if they were, there’d be no need for ‘Revenge!’ (See what I did there?)\n\nEmily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) threw a major curveball at us on the Oct. 5 episode of ABC’s Revenge when she sent everyone a mass “forgivesies” text and moved away from the Hamptons. JK! She continued to ruin the lives of all the people around her, this week targeting Senator Tom Kingsley (Yancey Arias), the man who prosecuted her father. So how did she do it? I’ve got three words for you, friends: Baby. Mama. Drama."
