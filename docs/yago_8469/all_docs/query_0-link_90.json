        "text": "I think this thread is about actors who used to be omnipresent but then \"disappeared\". I don't think someone who appeared in 2 movies 19 years ago - and had a bit part in one of them - really counts...\n\nNo big secret though...she married Kevin Kline and retired from show biz 30 years ago to raise kids and run an antique store. Voluntarily left the stage.\n\nPoint taken. It's not like he vanished in 1988-but the guy always played such vibrant characters that it was easy for me to overlook this...\n\nFichtner does a lot of TV, if you never saw the ABC series \"Invasion\" in which he stars I highly recommend it, it was released on DVD. Paxton also does TV (\"Big Love\"), he's the star of the new CBS series \"Training Day\" based on the film. It's slated as a mid-season replacement show for late 2016 or early 2017.\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was on the CBS series \"Hostages\" a couple of years ago, she played the First Lady to James McNaughton's President.\n\nOh you mean Mrs. Kevin Kline?, wife and mother, and not acting any more.\n\nStowe had vanished for ages by was a star of the ABC series \"Revenge\". Her husband Brian Ben Ben known for the early HBO series \"Dream On' had vanished along with her, but I recently saw him on Cameron Crowe's \"Roadies' series on Showtime.\n\nIf you are a fan of hers she was wonderful in the movie Georgia. Everyone was....Ted Levine, Mare Winningham...it's a wonderful film. Jennifer's mom produced it. I think her choice to do smaller films was very wise. She can select parts perfectly suited for her. But I was thrilled to see her in a big film and I think she played her character perfectly.\n\nDennis Franz and Jimmy Smits were presenters at the Emmys less than 2 weeks ago. He looked the same.\n\nBrian Benben was a regular on the ABC series \" Private Practice\" after \"Dream On\".\n\nThat's too bad... I always kinda liked her. Good actress, and a damn fine-looking woman. The number of films of hers that I've seen is actually quite small, though... only 6 by my count: After Hours, Dogma, Jade, The Last Seduction, Men in Black, and Unforgettable."
