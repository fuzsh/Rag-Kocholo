        "text": "Brian Benben portrayed the character Leonard Carnehan in season four episode \"An Innocent Man\" of Scandal.\n\nAbout[]\n\nBrian Edward Benben is an American actor, best known for his role as Martin Tupper in the HBO comedy television series Dream On, and also known as Dr. Sheldon Wallace on ABC medical drama Private Practice.\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn 1983, he appeared in the Broadway production of John Byrne's play Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Val Kilmer and Jackie Earle Haley. The play ran on Broadway for 48 performances. Although his first national exposure was in the 1981 NBC miniseries-then-series The Gangster Chronicles, Benben is perhaps best known for his leading role in the 1990â€“96 HBO television series, Dream On.\n\nHe played a \"by the book\" FBI agent in the 1990 film Dark Angel (known in the U.S. as I Come in Peace). He had a starring role in the 1994 film Radioland Murders playing Mary Stuart Masterson's estranged husband.\n\nIn September 1998, he starred in an eponymous primetime CBS sitcom, The Brian Benben Show, which lasted only one month on the air. In the 2000s, he played Dr. Sheldon Wallace on Shonda Rhimes' Private Practice. His character was first introduced in December 2008, later became a recurring character, and finally a series regular. In 2014, he appeared in the television series Scandal, also produced by Rhimes.\n\nIn 2015, he played the character Charlie in Grace and Frankie. In 2017, he appeared in the television show Imposters where he plays a main character Max.\n\n[]"
