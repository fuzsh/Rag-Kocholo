        "text": "By AMY LONGSDORF; Times Leader Correspondent\n\nSunday, June 13, 1999 Page: 1G\n\nNEW YORK- Madeleine Stowe’s fondest childhood memory explains a lot about\n\nwhy she decided to end her four-year hiatus from Hollywood movies with the new\n\nJohn Travolta military thriller “The General’s Daughter”\n\n“I used to live for `Welcome Back, Kotter,” says the actress. “It was my\n\nfavorite TV show. I not only wrote John fan letters, I actually pretended to\n\nbe a journalist when I was 16 so I could interview him on the set. It didn’t\n\nwork out, but I got as far as getting his publicist on the phone, which seemed\n\npretty thrilling at the time.”\n\nThings were even more thrilling on the set of “The General’s Daughter,” a\n\nmurder mystery in which Stowe plays an Army investigator teaming up with\n\nTravolta to solve a slaying. (The movie opens Friday in area theaters.) In\n\nbetween discovering high-level cover-ups and top-secret videotapes, the pair\n\nmanage to find time to generate oodles of sexual tension.\n\nOriginally, the movie, which is based on a Nelson DeMille bestseller,\n\nfeatured an even more explicit Travolta/Stowe relationship. But in the editing\n\nroom, director Simon West (“Con Air”) decided the complicated connection kept\n\ngetting in the way of the enfolding mystery.\n\n“The love affair between John and me belonged in a different movie.\n\nIt began to upstage the drama of the story, but take my word for it, we\n\nshot some great love scenes,” raves Stowe. Exactly how great? “Just remember\n\nthat (Travolta’s wife) Kelly Preston was originally cast in my role, and she\n\nand John requested them.”\n\nEven when they weren’t shooting love scenes, Stowe had a terrific time\n\nworking with Travolta on the movie’s Savannah set. Temperatures regularly\n\nsoared above 100 degrees, but the former Sweathog never lost his cool.\n\n“John was so nice to every single person on the set that one day I said to\n\nhim, `God, why don’t you just knock it off! No one is that nice!’ ” says Stowe\n\nduring an interview in New York’s Parker Meridian Hotel. “But he is that nice.\n\nHe was nice every single day for four months. I was very suspicious at first.\n\nBut I’ve learned you can’t hide your real self that long.”\n\nIt was Travolta who hand-picked the actress for the role after Preston\n\ndropped out. Watching “Last of the Mohicans” and “Blink” back-to-back\n\nconvinced him to go with Stowe.\n\n“Besides being gorgeous, Madeleine has the intensity of a Meryl Streep and\n\nthe ability as an artist to think in character,” says Travolta.\n\n“She can find the truth in any line of dialogue. It’s remarkable to watch\n\nher work.”\n\nLately, work has been the last thing on Stowe’s mind. Ever since she and\n\nactor-husband Brian Benben (TV’s “Dream On”) bought a 400-acre ranch in the\n\nhill country outside San Antonio, the actress has been reluctant to leave her\n\nhome on the range. Besides roles in the little-seen “Playing By Heart” and\n\n“The Proposition,” she hasn’t been on screen since co-starring opposite Bruce\n\nWillis in “12 Monkeys.”\n\n“It’s hard to leave home when you’re so happy there,” she says. “The ranch\n\nis so great. It’s a big operation with cattle, horses and sheep.”\n\nDoes the actress actually get up at the crack of dawn to do chores? “I ride\n\nevery morning,” she replies. “I work the land. OK, not really. Just make up\n\nwhatever you want. Just make me sound good.”\n\nStowe might not work the land, but she does keep busy. Three years ago, she\n\ngave birth to her first child, a daughter named May, who has inherited her\n\nmother’s feisty personality.\n\n“She’s hilarious,” says Stowe, 40. “The other day, I snapped at my husband\n\nbecause I was pulling off some boots of mine that were too small and somehow\n\nit was his fault. My daughter snapped back at me, `Mommy, Daddy is sad. Leave\n\nhim alone.’\n\n“She took his side! She’s only 3, but the other day she told me, `Mommy, if\n\nyou yell at Daddy again I’m gonna kick your ass.’ I didn’t know where it came\n\nfrom and then I realized she was watching too much TV.”\n\nGrowing up in Eagle Rock, Calif., the daughter of a civil service engineer\n\nfather an a Costa-Rican housewife mom, Stowe was something of a television\n\nfanatic. When her dad contracted multiple sclerosis, the actress found herself\n\nwithdrawing even further into a fantasy world of TV and movies.\n\n“I couldn’t bring kids to the house anymore because suddenly my father had\n\na violent temper,” she says.\n\nEven though she found success as a performer almost immediately, it wasn’t\n\nuntil she met her future husband on the set of TV’s “The Gangster Chronicles”\n\nthat Stowe believes she came out of her shell.\n\n“I was 22, and I only dated one person prior to Brian and that was, believe\n\nit or not, Dennis Quaid. You know, my husband was the second person I ever had\n\nsex with, and the first one was a lot older than me so I don’t consider him a\n\ndate.\n\n“When I met Brian, he was just wild. He’d do anything. Say anything. I\n\ndidn’t know how to talk, so his freedom was so sexy to me. I was so shy, and\n\nhe brought me out of my shell. He had no choice. I couldn’t go any deeper into\n\nmy shell. I had to come out.\n\n“It’s funny. Brian remembers when he first met me that he turned to the\n\nshow’s director and said, `What is her problem?’ I was so quiet that he\n\nthought I had an attitude or something.”\n\nStowe isn’t as quiet these days. One of Hollywood’s most outspoken stars,\n\nshe clashed with director Jonathan Kaplan about the ending of “Unlawful\n\nEntry,” tussled with 20th Century Fox over the firing of “Bad Girls” director\n\nTamra Davis and is now embroiled in a small battle with Miramax over the fate\n\nof her next film, “Impostor,” which was originally designated as one-third of\n\na trilogy.\n\n“At the moment, they’re trying to turn `Impostor’ into a full-length film,”\n\nshe says. “It began as part of a movie called `Alien Love Triangle.’ Danny\n\nBoyle did the first film, and then Gary Fleder did the second one, which is\n\ncalled `Impostor.’ And Miramax is so in love with it, they’re trying to push\n\nus all into a movie version of it this fall. But unless it’s the right script,\n\nI say why mess with something that’s perfect.”\n\nAt least Stowe’s life in Texas remains on an even keel. Most of the time.\n\n“To this day I can’t wait to see Brian again,” she says. “I go out for\n\ngroceries thinking, `I can’t wait to get home to see my husband.’ Of course,\n\nsometimes I’m really mean and nasty to him, but he still loves me.”\n\nStowe’s career has a way of working itself out too. Since making her film\n\ndebut in “Stakeout,” the actress has managed to hold her own with some of\n\nHollywood’s heaviest hitters, including Jack Nicholson (“The Two Jacks”),\n\nKevin Costner (“Revenge”), Tim Robbins (“Short Cuts”), Bruce Willis (“12\n\nMonkeys”) and Daniel Day-Lewis (“The Last of the Mohicans”).\n\nStowe stops short of naming her favorite co-star but Day-Lewis ranks near\n\nthe top of the list.\n\n“Do you remember the waterfall love scene Daniel and I had in `Mohicans’?”\n\nasks Stowe. “We did it once and I asked to do it again. I said, `I don’t think\n\nit went well.’ And they believed me! So we shot it a couple more times. Yes, I\n\nknow. I am a very lucky woman.”"
