        "text": "Byline: Louise Farr\n\nLos Angeles — “This is so…femme,” says Madeleine Stowe.\n\nShe’s looking around the Peninsula Hotel lounge area, where Beverly Hills women in tweedy suits sit on overstuffed sofas indulging in cream cakes and pots of tea.\n\nNot that the 40-year-old Stowe isn’t plenty femme herself, with her long tousled hair, dark troubled eyes and sheer lavender Marc Jacobs dress. (“It’s last season’s,” she apologizes.) In her career, though — in which she’s played opposite Daniel Day Lewis, Kevin Costner, Bruce Willis and Jack Nicholson in “The Last of the Mohicans,” “Revenge,” “12 Monkeys” and “The Two Jakes,” respectively — she’s more of a man’s woman: fiery, sexy and too often victimized for her passions, even by the occasional reviewer.\n\n“Madeleine Stowe gives good body,” one said, dismissing her first film, 1987’s “Stakeout.”\n\n“I haven’t taken my clothes off for a long time,” Stowe says in her own defense. “I don’t think you have to, at all. Nor have I ever felt coerced into it.”\n\nIn fact, she turned down the Julianne Moore role in Robert Altman’s “Short Cuts” because she didn’t want to appear nude — and ended up winning a best supporting actress award from the National Society of Film Critics for playing wife to an unfaithful Tim Robbins in the same movie.\n\nIn “The General’s Daughter,” which opened three weeks ago, she doesn’t have any sex scenes — and she’s nobody’s victim.\n\n“She takes no prisoners,” Stowe says about her character, an army investigator assigned with her former lover, John Travolta, to look into the rape-murder of a well-known general’s daughter. She and Travolta, who had co-star approval, bicker their way through the dark mystery, based on Nelson DeMille’s bestseller.\n\nIn a scenario that makes studio heads feel smug, the film has already grossed $67.4 million — despite sneers from critics. It’s expected to top $90 million domestically, making it Stowe’s biggest box-office hit to date.\n\nNot that landing the movie was easy. Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, was originally slated for the role. When Preston dropped out of the running, Stowe met with producers and director Simon West — then heard nothing for months. She had actually given up on the project when her agent called and told her the part was hers if she wanted it.\n\nWithin weeks, she was shooting in the steamy summer heat of Savannah, Ga., which she insists she liked because of the dewy look the humidity gave her complexion.\n\nOthers also liked what they saw.\n\n“You can stick a camera an inch from her face and she still looks gorgeous,” gushes producer Mace Neufeld, who wanted the leading lady to be in Travolta’s age range.\n\nThe director also found Stowe to be a consummate pro — with a twist.\n\n“She looks very serene, but she has a wild side to her,” says West. “She surprised me with some of her comments. They were almost obscene.”\n\nHer unabashed sensuality shows as she gleefully spoons a glob of Devonshire cream onto a heap of fragrant strawberries.\n\n“John would love this,” she says. “He would be so happy. He used to say, ‘Madeleine, if you could have any ice cream, what would it be? Ooh, ooh, what would you put on it?’ Then the next day he’d have an ice cream social in his trailer — for the girls only.”\n\nStowe says she and Travolta didn’t need to discuss their work on the set.\n\n“Things were just happening,” she says. “You get to see a part of the other person that you would never otherwise know, that doesn’t exist, but you create it for that particular moment. Then it goes away and only lives in memory. You understand it may not exist outside that arena. It’s when you think that it can, that’s when you get into a lot of emotional trouble. I think a lot of actors go through a lot of relationships because of that.”\n\nAs a child growing up in the Los Angeles suburb of Eagle Rock, social isolation was more Stowe’s M.O. When she was six, her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She escaped by studying classical piano, using it as an excuse for her withdrawal.\n\n“I’ve never really known how to talk about it,” she says of her father’s illness. “I feel sometimes people use tragedy as a calling card.”\n\nWhen she realized she wasn’t gifted enough for a music career, Stowe’s life opened up. Studying journalism and theater at USC, she was discovered by Richard Dreyfuss’s agent, Meyer Mishkin, while working backstage.\n\n“It was flukey the way he found me. He was like a daddy to me,” she says. “I was a driven person, but I didn’t have direction. It could have been quite disastrous.”\n\nFive years ago, finding Los Angeles “discombobulated,” she moved with her husband, actor Brian Benben, to a Texas cattle ranch.\n\n“I always felt that I ran on adrenaline,” she says. “The idea of seeking the next movie was enchanting to me, and it ceased to be.”\n\nAfter her rollercoaster ride in the the film business, Stowe has found the peace and quiet of the countryside rejuvenating.\n\n“It’s more familial,” she says about life on the ranch. “You get up in the morning, and you’re dealing with the animals and the land and the color of the landscape. It’s a far more sensual experience, and that inspires you to be creative.”\n\nAll the same, these days Stowe sounds suspiciously ready to return to the Hollywood whirl. Since the birth of her daughter, May, now 2 1/2, she has played unfaithful wives in “Playing by Heart” and “The Proposition,” and she’s in the early stages of developing her own movie projects: historical dramas with strong women at the center.\n\nSometimes, she admits, she actually covets that spotlight she’s taken such pains to avoid.\n\n“I enjoy it when it’s on me,” she says, her hand in front of her mouth as if she doesn’t want to let the words out. “I want more than I have, but I really don’t know how to get it.”"
