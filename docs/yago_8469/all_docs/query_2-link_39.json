If not how can he possibly be 5ft 6?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nIn heels she can look 2 or 3 inches taller than him, maybe she's the stronger 5ft 6 range\n\nTall In The Saddle said on 9/Apr/21\n\nI just read this guy has been married to Madeleine Stowe since 1982 (bites knuckle!). Didn't have to DREAM ON there, did he?\n\nMadeleine still looks great at age 62 yo. Sure, it looks as though she's has some work done but it's very good work. She actually still looks like Madeleine Stowe. It only gets creepy when they don't know when to stop having surgery. I haven't seen either of these guys in anything for a long time. DREAM ON was actually a very clever, entertaining series.\n\nRising - 174 cm said on 31/Jan/18\n\nDolph looks absolutely enormous with him and really in the whole film. Easily a head taller or more and Dolph has at least a 10\" head.\n\nArch Stanton said on 15/Nov/12\n\nIn Dark Angel they frequently film Dolph and Benben at an angle to reduce the height difference appearance!!\n\nArch Stanton said on 15/Nov/12\n\nI get a 5'5 range impression, 5'6\" and change in shoes maybe.\n\nArch Stanton said on 15/Nov/12\n\nWatching Dark Angel right now, Dolph looked almost a foot taller. Tiny guy.\n\nleonari said on 27/Sep/12\n\nThanks Rob: I appreciate it!\n\nleonari said on 26/Sep/12\n\nThis is Off Rob. I just went through hundreds of pics. He looks shorter. 167 max. Can you take a look at him? Do me this favor. Thanks.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nnot sure about 167 but the 'change' bit might be a bit he's thrown, I'll put him flat 168.\n\nMr. R said on 29/Jul/08\n\nsaw him in The Dodger Stadium bathroom. This is pretty close.\n\npatrick said on 13/Nov/07\n\nI always found he looked less than 5'7 but it is probable he is. He looks short as if his jacket was always too long!\n\nI find it's a shame his talent has only been recognized in \"his\" show \"dream on\". He is very good and \"has the touch\". Many vulgar much less able to act and be funny are abnormally more known than him. Stupid time!\n\nFranco said on 30/Sep/07\n\ni love his surname....BENBEN looooool :D\n\nhe is a weak 5'6.5 though, he is 168cm at most\n\nHeight Tracker said on 3/Nov/05\n\nDid anyone see that movie he made with Dolph Lundgren? It was called \"I come in Peace\" or \"Dark Angel\" depending on where you bought it. In that movie, 6'5\" Lundgren absolutely towered over Benben. 5'7\" looks about right."
