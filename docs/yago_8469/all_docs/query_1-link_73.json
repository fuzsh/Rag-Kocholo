        "text": "BIRTHDAY GAL: Actress Madeleine Stowe was born in Los Angeles on this date in 1958. This birthday gal is known for her work in films such as “We Were Soldiers,” “Twelve Monkeys,” and “The Last of the Mohicans.” Recently, she starred in the short-lived series “Raines” and in the 2009 TV movie “The Christmas Hope.” Stowe has been married to actor Brian Benben since 1982 and the couple have two children.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Keep good manners in good repair. Remember to say the right thing at the most appropriate time, but even more important, know when to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the most tempting moment.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Cold, hard facts cut through the fog. Balance the checkbook or perform other detail-oriented tasks. Remain centered on routines and be sure to maintain a good grasp of the financial situation.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): A word from the nerd might be more useful than a word from the wise. It could seem as though the wise people you know are much too softhearted when more practical solutions are called for.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): The facts might require you to look at the results of a photo finish. Memories can be faulty and sympathies misplaced, so be sure to have concrete proof on hand. Sticking to the rules might be to your advantage.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Let the seeds of dissension and distrust fall on rocky ground. Refuse to sign a contract and avoid making a promise under these stars. A brief period of fussy thinking can lead you to form false assumptions.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Intellectually, you prefer to appear as the hardnosed, classic conservative. Gentle tugs on your heartstrings may make you wish you could make an exception or were bound by far fewer constraints.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22.): Lovers should pay attention to their lessons. Listen with both ears and a faithful heart to understand the essential message being submitted. You may be wiser to show your affection than to discuss it.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Throw the dog a bone, but be sure it doesn’t become a bone of contention. You can be generous and considerate to a fault. If you make someone feel they are helpless they might resent your input.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Championing the underdog may become an obstacle that impedes your progress like cholesterol clogs arteries. If you have developed a habit of being thrifty, don’t change your habits now.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Stop overbooking your life. You might be running on an already overly tight schedule and tend to crowd too much into a day. You must learn to say that you would if you could — but that you can’t, so you shan’t.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Read between the lines. Intuitive communication is necessary to strengthen ties and enhance the bonds of affection. A significant other might not speak out loud the words you yearn to hear.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-Mar. 20): Being materialistic isn’t all bad. Keep the mind focused on the three-dimensional things that you can contact through your senses. Don’t let your imagination or sympathies control your actions.\n\nIF AUGUST 18 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: In the month ahead, your experience and expertise will help you achieve your ambitions. Because you are inspired to reach for more than usual, you can gain more than usual. This doesn’t mean you are all work and no play, as it is an excellent time to go off on a romantic holiday or weekend getaway with a special someone. In November, keep your nose to the grindstone and don’t allow fantasies to have the upper hand. You will be much less gullible in late December, so you should examine closely any opportunity that comes your way. Next April and May, however, are the best months to make important decisions about your career, job or relationships.\n\n(C) 2010 TRIBUNE MEDIA SERVICES, INC."
