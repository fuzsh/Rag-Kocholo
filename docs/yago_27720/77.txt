(1880–1969), English writer, editor, journalist, and political activist. With his wife, Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf founded Hogarth Press, a company that published Virginia’s books, and together the Woolfs were the nucleus of the Bloomsbury group, a London literary group that included many important thinkers of the day.

Leonard Woolf was born in London on Nov. 25, 1880. He attended the University of Cambridge and worked as a civil servant in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) from 1904 to 1911. He and Virginia Stephen were married in 1912. Virginia’s first novel, The Voyage Out, was published in 1915, to critical approval. The Woolfs founded Hogarth Press in 1917, reissuing her first book and publishing others.

The Bloomsbury group consisted loosely of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, novelist E.M. Forster, economist John Maynard Keynes, and the Bells. Vanessa Bell was Virginia’s sister, and her husband Clive Bell was a noted art critic.

Virginia suffered from prolonged periods of depression, and during one such period in 1941, following the publication of her book Between the Acts, she committed suicide by drowning herself near her home in Sussex. Leonard Woolf edited and published excerpts from his wife’s diaries in A Writer’s Diary (1953); this book was considered a valuable and revealing look at the famous writer’s philosophy, problems, and methods of working. Leonard’s own books include Sowing (1960); Growing (1961); Beginning Again (1964); Down Hill All the Way (1967); and The Journey, Not the Arrival Matters (1969)—all autobiographical. Leonard Woolf died on Aug. 14, 1969, in Rodmell, Sussex, England.
